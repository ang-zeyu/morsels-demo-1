That was what really mattered--the  manner was a detail; and it is impossible to suppose that he meant to  let his annoyance stand in the way of his high purpose.[14]  Themistocles, to whom the Cretan statesman bears some affinity, it will  be remembered, forced the Greeks to fight at Salamis by a similar  stratagem.    This, of course, does not exculpate the Allies.  Their conduct merits  at least the appellation of irregular.  But when foreign diplomats and  native politicians become fused into a happy family, it would be  strange, indeed, if irregularities did not occur.  The whole of the  Greek story is so thoroughly permeated with the spirit of old-fashioned  melodrama that no incident, however startling, seems out of place.    What follows is something of an anticlimax.  Next day, the French  Minister--from this point onwards France takes the lead and England  recedes into the second place--had the honour to announce to his  Excellency the Greek Premier the arrival at Salonica of a first  detachment of troops, declaring at the same time that the Entente  Powers sent it to assist their ally Servia, and that they counted on  Greece, who had already given them so many proofs of friendship, not to  oppose measures taken in the interest of a country to which she also  was allied.[15]    {62}    In reply, the Greek Premier had the honour to declare to his Excellency  the French Minister that, being neutral, Greece could not authorize  measures which violated her neutrality.  The Hellenic Government was  therefore obliged to protest against the passage of foreign troops  through Greek territory.  The circumstance that those troops were  destined solely to the assistance of Servia, who was Greece's ally,  nowise altered the case; for, before the _casus faederis_ was realized,  the neutrality of Greece could not be affected by the danger which  menaced Servia.[16]    To return from formalities to realities.  On the same day (2 Oct.), the  Bulgarian forces began to mass on the Servian frontier, while the  Austro-German battalions were fighting their way across the Danube; and  on the 4th Russia launched her ultimatum on Bulgaria.  This rapid  fulfilment of their own prognostications roused the Greeks to the  highest pitch of excitement.  But all faith in the Entente had not yet  been extinguished.  On the very day on which the Petrograd Government  delivered its tardy and ineffectual ultimatum at Sofia, at Athens the  Chamber held a historic debate, in which M. Venizelos for the first  time proclaimed that the Graeco-Servian Treaty imposed an absolute  obligation upon Greece to make war on Bulgaria and Turkey; adding--in  answer to a question, what he would do if on going to Servia's  assistance he met the German and Austrian armies--that Germany and  Austria must be fought as well, if necessary, and backing his thesis  with those appeals to honour which, whether pertinent or not, seldom  fail to move a popular audience.  The debate lasted till four o'clock  in the morning and ended with a vote of confidence in M. Venizelos's  military policy--a policy which M. Venizelos, a civilian, expounded to  an assembly of civilians as a settled plan, without waiting for the  consent of the King and in defiance of the technical advice of the  General Staff.  In fairness to the Chamber, it should be added that the  motion was carried on the assumption that the King was in agreement.[17]    {63}    But we know King Constantine's attitude; and if M. Venizelos hoped by  these tactics to force his hand, he was speedily undeceived.  No sooner  was the debate over than the King summoned his Prime Minister and asked  him to modify his policy or to resign.  Faced by such a dilemma, M.  Venizelos did the only thing he could do--he resigned; and his country  shrank back on to the solid ground of neutrality.    It was a narrow escape--how narrow became evident a few hours later.  The Allies had promised to send 150,000 combatants.  Even if this  promise had been kept, the Allied force would not have been, in any  strategical sense, an adequate substitute for the Servian contingent.  For it was not in place for covering purposes or subsequent offensive  action; it was not trained to Balkan fighting; it was not equipped for  mountain warfare; and, coming to the same ports as the Greeks, it would  have delayed the process of concentration.  But, be that as it may, the  promise was not kept.  What is more, it could not possibly have been  kept.  Politicians casting about for arguments wherewith to back their  views may leave their hearers to imagine that Great Powers keep armies  ready to be planked down at any point at a moment's notice; but the  fact is that an army, even if it can be spared from other tasks, is a  cumbrous affair to move about, requiring all sorts of tiresome  things--food, arms, ammunition--the provision of which requires, in its  turn, complicated processes, before the army is potentially effective  for the role assigned to it in the creative mind of an excited orator.  Something of the sort had, indeed, been intimated to the Hellenic  Government by the Entente Powers themselves when they wished both  Greeks and Serbs to avert Bulgarian hostility by territorial  concessions--namely, that, as after the commitment of troops to  Gallipoli, none remained to rescue Servia, there was nothing for it but  to conciliate Bulgaria.  Of course, it may be asked, such being the  facts, what value had the promise of 150,000 men?  This {64} is a  question which M. Venizelos would have done well to ponder, as King  Constantine and his military advisers pondered it.  As it was, when  that afternoon the Allied forces turned up at Salonica, the Greek  people had the mortification to find that they amounted to 20,000.  Nor  did they approach the stipulated figure for months after.    The arguments which had prevailed with many some hours before were  suddenly exploded, and to the feeling of confidence which had prompted  the Chamber's vote immediately succeeded a feeling of panic.  What!  cried everybody at Athens, are we to stake our liberty--our national  existence--on such a chance: 150,000 Greeks, _plus_ 200,000  half-exhausted Serbs, _plus_ 20,000 Allies, against 200,000  Austro-Germans, _plus_ 300,000 Bulgars, _plus_ 100,000 Turks?  Nay, if  the French and the English love gambling, we don't: we cannot afford  the luxury.  Venizelos has allowed himself to be duped, said some;  others, Venizelos has tried to dupe us.    Such were the circumstances under which the Allies landed at Salonica.  Their action has been pronounced immoral and perfidious by some English  and even by some French critics; and as it was attended with ill  success, it brought double shame upon the contrivers.[18]  Certainly,  it will not bear investigation from the standpoint of political tact:  it was the first of the many performances which little by little  alienated a friendly nation from them and discredited M. Venizelos with  his countrymen.        [1] M. Venizelos in the _Nea Hellas_, 22 March (O.S.), 1915.    [2] _Ibid._    [3] Deville, p. 174.

[7] This utterance, for the exactness of which we have to rely entirely  on M. Venizelos's memory, was the origin of the charge henceforth  brought against King Constantine that he claimed to reign by Divine  Right.    [8] According to another and ampler version of these events, it had  been agreed between the King and M. Venizelos that, while the latter  opened conversations with the British and French Ministers about the  possibility of sending 150,000 combatants, the former should  simultaneously open conversations with the German Emperor relating the  steps taken in regard to the Entente, and asking what Germany would  give for Greek neutrality.  But when M. Venizelos returned to Athens,  he sent a letter to the King informing him that he had changed his mind  and that, as a responsible Minister, he could not sanction the  projected negotiations with Germany.  Whereupon the King forwarded by  M. Mercati a reply that, in such a case, he retracted the permission to  approach the Entente with regard to reinforcements.  See the _Balkan  Review_, Dec., 1920, pp. 387-8.  Yet another version supplies some  additional details: M. Venizelos assured M. Mercati that his _demarche_  was of a strictly personal character and did not commit the State in  the least; next day he repeated this assurance to the King himself and,  at the King's instance, promised to cancel the _demarche_; and two days  afterwards the French Minister, M. Guillemin, formally declared to the  King that M. Venizelos's _demarche_ was considered as null and  void--_nulle et non avenue_.--See S. Cosmin's _Diplomatic et Presse  dans l'Affaire Grecque_ (Paris, 1921), pp. 123-4.    [9] The Greek Ministers abroad had for some time been informing their  Government of a contemplated occupation by Allied troops of the  territories which were to be ceded to Bulgaria; and the suspicion that  a dispatch of Entente Forces to Salonica might have for its object  \"really to occupy for Bulgaria, until the conclusion of peace, the  territories coveted by her,\" has been expressed even by a French  diplomat.--See Deville, p. 129, n. 1.    [10] I venture to borrow this little scene from S. Cosmin, p. 125.  M.  Venizelos at this stage of the proceedings is more eloquent than  coherent.  He tells us (_Orations_, p. 139), that on informing the King  that the Allied troops were on their way to Salonica, his Majesty said:  \"That's all right.

In contrast with these we have to array the models of  Rembrandt's painting-room--fat burgomasters, florid in complexion and  common in feature; Jews and attornies; shipbuilders, and hard  harsh-featured master mechanics. Independent of the models themselves,  there is a congenial feeling created in the artist who associates with  and has to represent them; we imperceptibly imbibe the manners of those  we are in contact with, either advantageously or injuriously. From these  few remarks we may perceive that the dignified attitude, the broad  general tone of the countenance, though deep, yet rendered bright  and luminous by the jetty blackness of the hair and beard, were all  conducive to the creation of the style of Titian--a style that swallows  up the varieties of minute tints in a general breadth. So in Reynolds,  the absence of everything strong in expression or harsh in colour gave  a refinement to the heads of his men, and a beauty to the faces of his  females; and to this treatment all his sitters were subjected--so that  even those heads, however deficient in the originals, came off his  easel ladies and gentlemen. A subdued delicacy of expression and  colour removes them from the common look of familiar life. Now, on  the contrary, the very character and colour of Rembrandt's heads  are pronounced with the strong stamp of flesh and blood--an exact  representation of nature in an unsophisticated state. His handling, his  manner of leaving the various tints, and the marking of minute parts,  all conspire to give his works that appearance of truth unfettered  with the attempt to elevate the general character at the expense of  individuality.    The peculiarity of Titian's portraits, independent of the high character  and simple and dignified attitude of the figure, is a careful and  distinct modelling of the features, with the half-shadows, though  not dark, yet never slurred over--which in other hands would produce  heaviness; but Titian counteracts this by the intense darkness of his  dresses and backgrounds, so that the features, often modelled with  the firmness of sculpture, are rendered comparatively gentle by the  treatment of the other parts of the picture. The portraits of Sir Joshua  have this peculiarity, that however loaded and enriched in every part of  the work, the head is kept smooth, and often thinly painted. The  whole-length of \"The Marquis of Granby,\" and \"The Portrait of Mrs.  Siddons,\" two of his finest pictures, are examples of this mode of  treating the head. This has given rise to an anecdote, that Mrs.  Siddons, looking at the picture when unfinished, begged Sir Joshua not  to touch the head any more--and having promised her, he refrained,  notwithstanding the richness and depth of the fearless glazings would  seem to demand a corresponding force in the head. The truth is, that  Reynolds seems always to have depended upon the small dark shadows  to give solidity to his heads, without clogging them with colour or  dark half-tints. The importance of thus refining upon the head may be  perceived in the portrait of himself, painted _con amore_, and presented  to the Dilettante Society, of which he was a member. The features, and,  indeed, the whole head, depend upon the extreme darks; the judicious  arrangement of these shadows not only gives a pictorial dignity to the  work, from the stamp of science, but also, where the features in nature  are either blunt or mean in themselves, draws off the attention of the  spectator to higher qualities. Shadows are never mean, but are the  stamps of truth rendered beautiful by taste and feeling. Independent  of the advantage of dark touches giving delicacy to the features that  produce them, there is a motion and life given by the vivacity and  freedom of the handling, which cannot with safety be taken with the  features themselves. This quality seems very early to have been Sir  Joshua's greatest anxiety to acquire. In a remark respecting the  pictures of a rival, John Stephen Liotard, whose only merit was a  strong likeness, with great neatness of finish, Reynolds says--\"The  high-finished manner of painting would be chosen if it were possible  with it to have that spirit and expression which infallibly fly off when  the artist labours; but there are transient beauties which last less  than a moment, and must be painted in as little time; besides, in poring  long the imagination is fatigued, and loses its vigour. You will find  nature in the first manner--but it will be nature stupid, and without  action. The portraits of Holbein are of this high-finished manner; and  for colouring and similitude what was ever beyond them? But then you see  fixed countenances, and all the features seem to remain immoveable.\"    Northcote observes, \"Of mere likeness in portraiture Reynolds thought  very little, and used to say that he could instruct any boy that chance  might throw in his way to paint a likeness in a portrait in half a  year's time; but to give an impressive and a just expression and  character to a picture, or paint it like Velasquez, was another thing.  What we are all,\" he said, \"attempting to do with great labour, he does  at once.\"    Barry, speaking of Reynolds as a portrait painter, mentions the wretched  state the art was in before his time, and how elevated it became from  the manner Sir Joshua treated it. In continuation, he says--\"In many of  Titian's portraits the head and hands are mere staring, lightish spots,  unconnected with either the drapery or background, which are sometimes  too dark, and mere obscure nothings; and in Lely, and even in Vandyke,  we sometimes meet with the other extreme of too little solidity, too  much flickering and washiness. Sir Joshua's object appears to have been  to obtain the vigour and solidity of the one, with the bustle and spirit  of the other, without the excess of either; and in by far the greatest  number of his portraits he has admirably succeeded. His portrait of  Mrs. Siddons is, both for the ideal and the executive, the finest  portrait of the kind perhaps in the world; indeed, it is something more  than a portrait, and may serve to give an excellent idea of what an  enthusiastic mind is apt to conceive of those pictures of confined  history for which Apelles was so celebrated by the ancient writers.  But this picture of 'Mrs. Siddons, or the Tragic Muse,' was painted not  long since, when much of his attention had been turned to history; and  it is highly probable that the picture of Lord Heathfield, the glorious  defender of Gibraltar, would have been of equal importance, had it been  a whole length; but even as it is--only a bust--there is great animation  and spirit, happily adapted to the indications of the tremendous scene  around him; and to the admirable circumstance of the key of the  fortress, firmly grasped in his hand, than which imagination cannot  conceive anything more ingenious and heroically characteristic. It  is, perhaps, owing to the Academy, and to his situation in it, to  the discourses which he biennially made to the pupils upon the great  principles of historical art, and the generous ardour of his own mind  to realize what he advised, that we are indebted for a few expansive  efforts of colouring and chiaro-scuro which would do honour to the first  names in the records of art.\" And speaking of the large historical work  he painted for the Empress of Russia, he adds--\"Nothing can exceed the  brilliancy of light--the force and vigorous effect of his picture of  'The Infant Hercules strangling the Serpent;' it possesses all that we  look for and are accustomed to admire in the works of Rembrandt, united  to beautiful forms and an elevation of mind to which Rembrandt had no  pretensions. The prophetical agitation of Tiresias and Juno, enveloped  in clouds, hanging over the scene like a black pestilence, can never be  too much admired, and are, indeed, truly sublime.\"    After such commendations, and from so high an authority, we might feel  a diffidence in bringing forward the great founder of the Dutch school  in competition with such artists as Titian and Reynolds, did we not  know that the qualities of the chiaro-scuro and colour of Reynolds are  founded on the deep tones of Rembrandt, who, as a colourist, takes his  proper place between the two heads of the Venetian and English schools.  How far Rembrandt was indebted for his principles of colour to the works  of Titian, it is impossible to say; but many of his pictures bear a  greater affinity to the last style of this great colourist than to any  other painter. We perceive by the catalogue of his effects, that folios  containing drawings by Titian, also prints after him, were in his  possession. The luminous, rich tones of his flesh are more like Titian  than Rubens or Vandyke, whose works he must have been familiar with;  and while his backgrounds are less black and inky than those in the  portraits of Titian and Tintoret, they are also more broken, both in  colour and execution, which prevents heaviness. His handling--which  conveys from its dexterity and touch so lifelike an appearance--is not  unlike that of Frank Hals, of whom Reynolds speaks so highly:--\"In the  works of Frank Hals, the portrait painter may observe the composition of  a face, the features well put together, as the painters express it, from  whence proceeds that strong, marked character of individual nature,  which is so remarkable in his portraits, and is not found in an equal  degree in any other painter. If he had joined to this most difficult  part of the art a patience in finishing what he so correctly planned,  he might justly have claimed the place which Vandyke, all things  considered, so justly holds, as the first of portrait painters.\" There  is, however, this difference in their works--independent of the flesh  of Rembrandt's being much richer in tone, it is produced by glazing and"]]]
