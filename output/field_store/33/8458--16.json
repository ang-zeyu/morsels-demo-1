One of the friends should also disguise himself as an  astrologer and declare the future good fortune and wealth of his friend  by showing the existence of all the lucky omens[43] and signs,[44] the  good influence of planets, the auspicious entrance of the sun into a  sign of the Zodiac, propitious stars and fortunate marks on his body.  Others again should rouse the jealousy of the girl's mother by telling  her that their friend has a chance of getting from some other quarter  even a better girl than hers.    A girl should be taken as a wife, as also given in marriage, when  fortune, signs, omens, and the words[45] of others are favourable, for,  says Ghotakamukha, a man should not marry at any time he likes. A girl  who is asleep, crying, or gone out of the house when sought in marriage,  or who is betrothed to another, should not be married. The following  also should be avoided:       One who is kept concealed.     One who has an ill-sounding name.     One who has her nose depressed.     One who has her nostril turned up.     One who is formed like a male.     One who is bent down.     One who has crooked thighs.     One who has a projecting forehead.     One who has a bald head.     One who does not like purity.     One who has been polluted by another.     One who is afflicted with the Gulma.[46]     One who is disfigured in any way.     One who has fully arrived at puberty.     One who is a friend.     One who is a younger sister.     One who is a Varshakari.[47]    In the same way a girl who is called by the name of one of the  twenty-seven stars, or by the name of a tree, or of a river, is  considered worthless, as also a girl whose name ends in \"r\" or \"l.\" But  some authors say that prosperity is gained only by marrying that girl to  whom one becomes attached, and that therefore no other girl but the one  who is loved should be married by anyone.    When a girl becomes marriageable her parents should dress her smartly,  and should place her where she can be easily seen by all. Every  afternoon, having dressed her and decorated her in a becoming manner,  they should send her with her female companions to sports, sacrifices,  and marriage ceremonies, and thus show her to advantage in society,  because she is a kind of merchandise. They should also receive with kind  words and signs of friendliness those of an auspicious appearance who  may come accompanied by their friends and relations for the purpose of  marrying their daughter, and under some pretext or other having first  dressed her becomingly, should then present her to them. After this they  should await the pleasure of fortune, and with this object should  appoint a future day on which a determination could be come to with  regard to their daughter's marriage. On this occasion when the persons  have come, the parents of the girl should ask them to bathe and dine,  and should say, \"Everything will take place at the proper time,\" and  should not then comply with the request, but should settle the matter  later.    When a girl is thus acquired, either according to the custom of the  country, or according to his own desire, the man should marry her in  accordance with the precepts of the Holy Writ, according to one of the  four kinds of marriage.    Thus ends marriage.    There are also some verses on the subject as follows:--    Amusement in society, such as completing verses begun by others,  marriages, and auspicious ceremonies should be carried on neither with  superiors, nor inferiors, but with our equals. That should be known as a  high connection when a man, after marrying a girl, has to serve her and  her relations afterwards like a servant, and such a connection is  censured by the good. On the other hand, that reproachable connection,  where a man, together with his relations, lords it over his wife, is  called a low connection by the wise. But when both the man and the woman  afford mutual pleasure to each other, and when the relatives on both  sides pay respect to one another, such is called a connection in the  proper sense of the word. Therefore a man should contract neither a high  connection by which he is obliged to bow down afterwards to his kinsmen,  nor a low connection, which is universally reprehended by all.

OF CREATING CONFIDENCE IN THE GIRL.      For the first three days after marriage, the girl and her husband should  sleep on the floor, abstain from sexual pleasures, and eat their food  without seasoning it either with alkali or salt. For the next seven days  they should bathe amidst the sounds of auspicious musical instruments,  should decorate themselves, dine together, and pay attention to their  relations as well as to those who may have come to witness their  marriage. This is applicable to persons of all castes. On the night of  the tenth day the man should begin in a lonely place with soft words,  and thus create confidence in the girl. Some authors say that for the  purpose of winning her over he should not speak to her for three days,  but the followers of Babhravya are of opinion that if the man does not  speak with her for three days, the girl may be discouraged by seeing him  spiritless like a pillar, and, becoming dejected, she may begin to  despise him as an eunuch. Vatsyayana says that the man should begin to  win her over, and to create confidence in her, but should abstain at  first from sexual pleasures. Women being of a tender nature, want tender  beginnings, and when they are forcibly approached by men with whom they  are but slightly acquainted, they sometimes suddenly become haters of  sexual connection, and sometimes even haters of the male sex. The man  should therefore approach the girl according to her liking, and should  make use of those devices by which he may be able to establish himself  more and more into her confidence. These devices are as follows:--    He should embrace her first of all in a way she likes most, because it  does not last for a long time.    He should embrace her with the upper part of his body because that is  easier and simpler. If the girl is grown up, or if the man has known  her for some time, he may embrace her by the light of a lamp, but if he  is not well acquainted with her, or if she is a young girl, he should  then embrace her in darkness.    When the girl accepts the embrace, the man should put a \"tambula\" or  screw of betel nut and betel leaves in her mouth, and if she will not  take it, he should induce her to do so by conciliatory words,  entreaties, oaths, and kneeling at her feet, for it is an universal rule  that however bashful or angry a woman may be, she never disregards a man  kneeling at her feet. At the time of giving this \"tambula\" he should  kiss her mouth softly and gracefully without making any sound. When she  is gained over in this respect he should then make her talk, and so that  she may be induced to talk he should ask her questions about things of  which he knows or pretends to know nothing, and which can be answered in  a few words. If she does not speak to him, he should not frighten her,  but should ask her the same thing again and again in a conciliatory  manner. If she does not then speak he should urge her to give a reply,  because as Ghotakamukha says, \"all girls hear everything said to them by  men, but do not themselves sometimes say a single word.\" When she is  thus importuned, the girl should give replies by shakes of the head, but  if she quarrelled with the man she should not even do that. When she is  asked by the man whether she wishes for him, and whether she likes him,  she should remain silent for a long time, and when at last importuned to  reply, should give him a favourable answer by a nod of the head. If the  man is previously acquainted with the girl he should converse with her  by means of a female friend, who may be favourable to him, and in the  confidence of both, and carry on the conversation on both sides. On such  an occasion the girl should smile with her head bent down, and if the  female friend say more on her part than she was desired to do, she  should chide her and dispute with her. The female friend should say in  jest even what she is not desired to say by the girl, and add, \"she says  so,\" on which the girl should say indistinctly and prettily, \"O no! I  did not say so,\" and she should then smile and throw an occasional  glance towards the man.    If the girl is familiar with the man, she should place near him,  without saying anything, the tambula, the ointment, or the garland that  he may have asked for, or she may tie them up in his upper garment.  While she is engaged in this, the man should touch her young breasts in  the sounding way of pressing with the nails, and if she prevents him  doing this he should say to her, \"I will not do it again if you will  embrace me,\" and should in this way cause her to embrace him. While he  is being embraced by her he should pass his hand repeatedly over and  about her body.

Meseems we are ever destined to discuss amiable matters,  in an amiable spirit.... A glass of punch, Monsieur... er... Chauvelin?\"    \"I must ask you, Sir Percy,\" rejoined Chauvelin sternly, \"to view this  matter with becoming seriousness.\"    \"Seriousness is never becoming, sir,\" said Blakeney, politely smothering  a slight yawn, \"and it is vastly unbecoming in the presence of ladies.\"    \"Am I to understand then, Sir Percy,\" said Chauvelin, \"that you are  prepared to apologize to Mademoiselle Candeille for this insult offered  to her by Lady Blakeney?\"    Sir Percy again tried to smother that tiresome little yawn, which seemed  most distressing, when he desired to be most polite. Then he flicked  off a grain of dust from his immaculate lace ruffle and buried his long,  slender hands in the capacious pockets of his white satin breeches;  finally he said with the most good-natured of smiles:    \"Sir, have you seen the latest fashion in cravats? I would wish to  draw your attention to the novel way in which we in England tie a  Mechlin-edged bow.\"    \"Sir Percy,\" retorted Chauvelin firmly, \"since you will not offer  Mademoiselle Candeille the apology which she has the right to expect  from you, are you prepared that you and I should cross swords like  honourable gentlemen?\"    Blakeney laughed his usual pleasant, somewhat shy laugh, shook his  powerful frame and looked from his altitude of six feet three inches  down on the small, sable-clad figure of ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.    \"The question is, sir,\" he said slowly, \"should we then be two  honourable gentlemen crossing swords?\"    \"Sir Percy...\"    \"Sir?\"    Chauvelin, who for one moment had seemed ready to lose his temper,  now made a sudden effort to resume a calm and easy attitude and said  quietly:    \"Of course, if one of us is coward enough to shirk the contest...\"    He did not complete the sentence, but shrugged his shoulders expressive  of contempt. The other side of the curtained doorway a little crowd had  gradually assembled, attracted hither by the loud and angry voices which  came from that small boudoir. Host and hostess had been missed from the  reception rooms for some time, His Royal Highness, too, had not been  seen for the quarter of an hour: like flies attracted by the light, one  by one, or in small isolated groups, some of Lady Blakeney's quests had  found their way to the room adjoining the royal presence.    As His Highness was standing in the doorway itself, no one could of  course cross the threshold, but everyone could see into the room, and  could take stock of the various actors in the little comedy. They were  witnessing a quarrel between the French envoy and Sir Percy Blakeney  wherein the former was evidently in deadly earnest and the latter merely  politely bored. Amused comments flew to and fro: laughter and a babel of  irresponsible chatter made an incessant chirruping accompaniment to the  duologue between the two men.    But at this stage, the Prince of Wales, who hitherto had seemingly kept  aloof from the quarrel, suddenly stepped forward and abruptly interposed  the weight of his authority and of his social position between the  bickering adversaries.    \"Tush, man!\" he said impatiently, turning more especially towards  Chauvelin, \"you talk at random. Sir Percy Blakeney is an English  gentleman, and the laws of this country do not admit of duelling, as you  understand it in France; and I for one certainly could not allow...\"    \"Pardon, your Royal Highness,\" interrupted Sir Percy with irresistible  bonhomie, \"your Highness does not understand the situation. My engaging  friend here does not propose that I should transgress the laws of this  country, but that I should go over to France with him, and fight him  there, where duelling and... er... other little matters of that sort are  allowed.\"    \"Yes! quite so!\" rejoined the Prince, \"I understand M. Chauvelin's  desire. ... But what about you, Blakeney?\"    \"Oh!\" replied Sir Percy lightly, \"I have accepted his challenge, of  course!\"          Chapter XII: Time--Place--Conditions        It would be very difficult indeed to say why--at Blakeney's lightly  spoken words--an immediate silence should have fallen upon all those  present. All the actors in the little drawing-room drama, who had played  their respective parts so unerringly up to now, had paused a while, just  as if an invisible curtain had come down, marking the end of a scene,  and the interval during which the players might recover strength and  energy to resume their roles. The Prince of Wales as foremost spectator  said nothing for the moment, and beyond the doorway, the audience there  assembled seemed suddenly to be holding its breath, waiting--eager,  expectant, palpitation--for what would follow now.    Only here and there the gentle frou-frou of a silk skirt, the rhythmic  flutter of a fan, broke those few seconds' deadly, stony silence.    Yet it was all simple enough. A fracas between two ladies, the gentlemen  interposing, a few words of angry expostulation, then the inevitable  suggestion of Belgium or of some other country where the childish and  barbarous custom of settling such matters with a couple of swords had  not been as yet systematically stamped out.    The whole scene--with but slight variations--had occurred scores of  times in London drawing-rooms, English gentlemen had scores of times  crossed the Channel for the purpose of settling similar quarrels in  continental fashion.    Why should the present situation appear so abnormal? Sir Percy  Blakeney--an accomplished gentleman--was past master in the art of  fence, and looked more than a match in strength and dexterity for the  meagre, sable-clad little opponent who had so summarily challenged him  to cross over to France, in order to fight a duel.    But somehow everyone had a feeling at this moment that this proposed  duel would be unlike any other combat every fought between two  antagonists. Perhaps it was the white, absolutely stony and unexpressive  face of Marguerite which suggested a latent tragedy: perhaps it was the  look of unmistakable horror in Juliette's eyes, or that of triumph  in those of Chauvelin, or even that certain something in His Royal  Highness' face, which seemed to imply that the Prince, careless man of  the world as he was, would have given much to prevent this particular  meeting from taking place.    Be that as it may, there is no doubt that a certain wave of electrical  excitement swept over the little crowd assembled there, the while  the chief actor in the little drama, the inimitable dandy, Sir Percy  Blakeney himself, appeared deeply engrossed in removing a speck of  powder from the wide black satin ribbon which held his gold-rimmed  eyeglass.    \"Gentlemen!\" said His Royal Highness suddenly, \"we are forgetting the  ladies. My lord Hastings,\" he added, turning to one of the gentlemen  who stood close to him, \"I pray you to remedy this unpardonable neglect.  Men's quarrels are not fit for ladies' dainty ears.\"    Sir Percy looked up from his absorbing occupation. His eyes met those  of his wife; she was like a marble statue, hardly conscious of what was  going on round her. But he, who knew every emotion which swayed that  ardent and passionate nature, guessed that beneath that stony calm there  lay a mad, almost unconquerable impulse: and that was to shout to all  these puppets here, the truth, the awful, the unanswerable truth, to  tell them what this challenge really meant; a trap wherein one man  consumed with hatred and desire for revenge hoped to entice a brave and  fearless foe into a death-dealing snare.    Full well did Percy Blakeney guess that for the space of one second  his most cherished secret hovered upon his wife's lips, one turn of  the balance of Fate, one breath from the mouth of an unseen sprite, and  Marguerite was ready to shout:    \"Do not allow this monstrous thing to be! The Scarlet Pimpernel, whom  you all admire for his bravery, and love for his daring, stands before  you now, face to face with his deadliest enemy, who is here to lure him  to his doom!\"    For that momentous second therefore Percy Blakeney held his wife's  gaze with the magnetism of his own; all there was in him of love, of  entreaty, of trust, and of command went out to her through that look  with which he kept her eyes riveted upon his face.    Then he saw the rigidity of her attitude relax. She closed her eyes in  order to shut out the whole world from her suffering soul. She seemed  to be gathering all the mental force of which her brain was capable, for  one great effort of self-control. Then she took Juliette's hand in hers,  and turned to go out of the room; the gentlemen bowed as she swept past  them, her rich silken gown making a soft hush-sh-sh as she went. She  nodded to some, curtseyed to the Prince, and had at the last moment  the supreme courage and pride to turn her head once more towards her  husband, in order to reassure him finally that his secret was as safe  with her now, in this hour of danger, as it had been in the time of  triumph.    She smiled and passed out of his sight, preceded by Desiree Candeille,  who, escorted by one of the gentlemen, had become singularly silent and  subdued.    In the little room now there only remained a few men. Sir Andrew  Ffoulkes had taken the precaution of closing the door after the ladies  had gone.    Then His Royal Highness turned once more to Monsieur Chauvelin and said  with an obvious show of indifference:    \"Faith, Monsieur! meseems we are all enacting a farce, which can have  no final act. I vow that I cannot allow my friend Blakeney to go over to  France at your bidding. Your government now will not allow my father's  subjects to land on your shores without a special passport, and then  only for a specific purpose.\"    \"La, your Royal Highness,\" interposed Sir Percy, \"I pray you have no  fear"]]]
