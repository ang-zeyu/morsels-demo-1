Even now, we can hear it  whispering the doubt whether that can be a good path, which thus sets  \"mind\" at defiance.    If this, then, be the most vital and fundamental part of the teaching,  should it not stand at the very beginning? It may seem so at first; but  had it stood there, we should not have comprehended it. For he who  would know the doctrine must lead the life, doing the will of his Father  which is in Heaven.        BOOK IV    1. Psychic and spiritual powers may be inborn, or they may be gained  by the use of drugs, or by incantations, or by fervour, or by  Meditation.    Spiritual powers have been enumerated and described in the preceding  sections. They are the normal powers of the spiritual man, the  antetype, the divine edition, of the powers of the natural man.  Through these powers, the spiritual man stands, sees, hears, speaks,  in the spiritual world, as the physical man stands, sees, hears, speaks  in the natural world.    There is a counterfeit presentment of the spiritual man, in the world  of dreams, a shadow lord of shadows, who has his own dreamy  powers of vision, of hearing, of movement; he has left the natural  without reaching the spiritual. He has set forth from the shore, but has  not gained the further verge of the river. He is borne along by the  stream, with no foothold on either shore. Leaving the actual, he has  fallen short of the real, caught in the limbo of vanities and delusions.  The cause of this aberrant phantasm is always the worship of a false,  vain self, the lord of dreams, within one's own breast. This is the  psychic man, lord of delusive and bewildering psychic powers.    Spiritual powers, like intellectual or artistic gifts, may be inborn: the  fruit, that is, of seeds planted and reared with toil in a former birth. So  also the powers of the psychic man may be inborn, a delusive harvest  from seeds of delusion.    Psychical powers may be gained by drugs, as poverty, shame,  debasement may be gained by the self-same drugs. In their action, they  are baneful, cutting the man off from consciousness of the restraining  power of his divine nature, so that his forces break forth exuberant,  like the laughter of drunkards, and he sees and hears things delusive.  While sinking, he believes that he has risen; growing weaker, he thinks  himself full of strength; beholding illusions, he takes them to be true.  Such are the powers gained by drugs; they are wholly psychic, since  the real powers, the spiritual, can never be so gained.    Incantations are affirmations of half-truths concerning spirit and  matter, what is and what is not, which work upon the mind and slowly  build up a wraith of powers and a delusive well-being. These, too, are  of the psychic realm of dreams.    Lastly, there are the true powers of the spiritual man, built up and  realized in Meditation, through reverent obedience to spiritual law, to  the pure conditions of being, in the divine realm.    2. The transfer of powers from one venture to another comes through  the flow of the natural creative forces.    Here, if we can perceive it, is the whole secret of spiritual birth,  growth and life Spiritual being, like all being, is but an expression of  the Self, of the inherent power and being of Atma. Inherent in the Self  are consciousness and will, which have, as their lordly heritage, the  wide sweep of the universe throughout eternity, for the Self is one  with the Eternal. And the consciousness of the Self may make itself  manifest as seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling, or whatsoever perceptive  powers there may be, just as the white sunlight may divide into  many-coloured rays. So may the will of the Self manifest itself in the  uttering of words, or in handling, or in moving, and whatever powers  of action there are throughout the seven worlds. Where the Self is,  there will its powers be. It is but a question of the vesture through  which these powers shall shine forth. And wherever the consciousness  and desire of the ever-creative Self are fixed, there will a vesture be  built up; where the heart is, there will the treasure be also.    Since through ages the desire of the Self has been toward the natural  world, wherein the Self sought to mirror himself that he might know  himself, therefore a vesture of natural elements came into being,  through which blossomed forth the Self's powers of perceiving and of  will: the power to see, to hear, to speak, to walk, to handle; and when  the Self, thus come to self-consciousness, and, with it, to a knowledge  of his imprisonment, shall set his desire on the divine and real world,  and raise his consciousness thereto, the spiritual vesture shall be built  up for him there, with its expression of his inherent powers. Nor will  migration thither be difficult for the Self, since the divine is no strange  or foreign land for him, but the house of his home, where he dwells  from everlasting.    3. The apparent, immediate cause is not the true cause of the creative  nature-powers; but, like the husbandman in his field, it takes obstacles  away.    The husbandman tills his field, breaking up the clods of earth into fine  mould, penetrable to air and rain; he sows his seed, carefully covering  it, for fear of birds and the wind; he waters the seed-laden earth,  turning the little rills from the irrigation tank now this way and that,  removing obstacles from the channels, until the even How of water  vitalizes the whole field. And so the plants germinate and grow, first  the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. But it is not the  husbandman who makes them grow. It is, first, the miraculous plasmic  power in the grain of seed, which brings forth after its kind; then the  alchemy of sunlight which, in presence of the green colouring matter  of the leaves, gathers hydrogen from the water and carbon from the  gases in the air, and mingles them in the hydro-carbons of plant  growth; and, finally, the wholly occult vital powers of the plant itself,  stored up through ages, and flowing down from the primal sources of  life. The husbandman but removes the obstacles. He plants and  waters, but God gives the increase.    So with the finer husbandman of diviner fields. He tills and sows, but  the growth of the spiritual man comes through the surge and flow of  divine, creative forces and powers. Here, again, God gives the  increase. The divine Self puts forth, for the manifestation of its  powers, a new and finer vesture, the body of the spiritual man.    4. Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the  Boston of the feeling of selfhood.    The Self, says a great Teacher, in turn attaches itself to three  vestures: first, to the physical body, then to the finer body, and  thirdly to the causal body. Finally it stands forth radiant, luminous,  joyous, as the Self.    When the Self attributes itself to the physical body, there arise the  states of bodily consciousness, built up about the physical self.    When the Self, breaking through this first illusion, begins to see and  feel itself in the finer body, to find selfhood there, then the states of  consciousness of the finer body come into being; or, to speak exactly,  the finer body and its states of consciousness arise and grow together.    But the Self must not dwell permanently there. It must learn to find  itself in the causal body, to build up the wide and luminous fields of  consciousness that belong to that.    Nor must it dwell forever there, for there remains the fourth state, the  divine, with its own splendour and everlastingness.    It is all a question of the states of consciousness; all a question of  raising the sense of selfhood, until it dwells forever in the Eternal.    5. In the different fields of manifestation, the Consciousness, though  one, is the elective cause of many states of consciousness.    Here is the splendid teaching of oneness that lies at the heart of the  Eastern wisdom. Consciousness is ultimately One, everywhere and  forever. The Eternal, the Father, is the One Self of All Beings. And so,  in each individual who is but a facet of that Self, Consciousness is  One. Whether it breaks through as the dull fire of physical life, or the  murky flame of the psychic and passional, or the radiance of the  spiritual man, or the full glory of the Divine, it is ever the Light,  naught but the Light. The one Consciousness is the effective cause of  all states of consciousness, on every plane.    6. Among states of consciousness, that which is born of  Contemplation is free from the seed of future sorrow.     Where the consciousness breaks forth in the physical body, and the  full play of bodily life begins, its progression carries with it inevitable  limitations. Birth involves death. Meetings have their partings. Hunger  alternates with satiety. Age follows on the heels of youth. So do the  states of consciousness run along the circle of birth and death.    With the psychic, the alternation between prize and penalty is swifter.  Hope has its shadow of fear, or it is no hope. Exclusive love is  tortured by jealousy. Pleasure passes through deadness into pain.  Pain's surcease brings pleasure back again. So here, too, the states of  consciousness run their circle. In all psychic states there is egotism,  which, indeed, is the very essence of the psychic; and where there is  egotism there is ever the seed of future sorrow. Desire carries  bondage in its womb.    But where the pure spiritual consciousness begins, free from self and  stain, the ancient law of retaliation ceases; the penalty of sorrow  lapses and is no more imposed. The soul now passes, no longer from  sorrow to sorrow, but from glory to glory. Its growth and splendour  have no limit. The good passes to better, best.    7.

He tells us that the  coal duty, which was on sea-borne coal, was 1s. 6d. per chaldron,  whereof four-fifths went to St. Paul's. The age of Indulgences was  over, and, unlike the cathedrals of the Middle Ages, the cost of  building St. Paul's was chiefly defrayed by a public impost; and this  cost may be estimated in round numbers at about three-quarters of a  million for the actual building, with an additional hundred thousand  for incidental expenses.      FOOTNOTES:    [52] This village, near Salisbury, is called East Knoyle, Knoyle  Magna, and Bishop-Knoyle. The entry of baptism runs: \"Christopher (2nd  sic.) sonne of Christopher Wren Doctor in Divinitie and Rector now.\"  The rector placed this entry, dated only \"10th,\" before March, 1632/31  in a vacant place. Hence the statement that the surveyor was born in  1631, but both the rector and Christopher himself dated the birth  October 20, 1632. My thanks are due to the Rev. Canon Milford, Rector  of East Knoyle, for the above, and also to his copy of Miss Lucy  Phillimore's \"Life.\"    [53] \"Parentalia,\" p. 227 and elsewhere, gives details of his  extensive knowledge of anatomy in its various branches.    [54] His inaugural address at Gresham College, in Latin, when he was  twenty-five (1657) fills eight folios in the \"Parentalia,\" and is  given in facsimile of his handwriting.    [55] The humorous letter of Sprat to Wren says: \"I endeavoured to  persuade him [the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford] that the drawing of Lines  in Sir Harry Savill's School was not altogether of so great a  Concernment for the Benefit of Christendom, as the rebuilding of St.  Paul's or the fortifying of Tangier: (for I understood those were the  great Works in which that extraordinary genius of yours was judg'd  necessary to be employed)\" (\"Parentalia,\" p. 260).    [56] As it seems to have been ignored how carefully Wren studied  cathedrals and other buildings, the following may be of interest:  \"These Surveys [of Salisbury with elaborate report for the Bishop,  Seth Ward] and other occasional Inspections of the most noted  cathedral Churches and Chapels in _England_ and foreign Parts\"  (\"Parentalia,\" p. 306). He never saw, we may assume, his three  favourite buildings at Rome--the Pantheon, the Basilica of Maxentius,  and St. Peter's.

The archaeological  remains disinterred have been already mentioned, pp. 3 and 4.    [59] Mr. Longman seems to think that the cathedral rests on the loam.  The following shows that the strata are irregular, and that in some  places the loam is very thin. Edward Strong the younger \"also repaired  all the blemishes and fractures in the several legs and arches of the  dome, occasioned by the great weight of the said dome pressing upon  the foundation; the earth under the same being of an unequal temper  the loamy part thereof gave more way to the great weights than that  which was of gravel; so that the south-west quarter of the dome, and  the six smaller legs of the other quarters of the dome, having less  superficies, sunk into the thinner part of the loamy ground, an inch  in some places, in others two inches, and in other places something  more; and the other quarters of the dome, being on the thicker part of  the loamy ground and gravel, it did not give so much way to the great  weights as the other did, which occasioned the fractures and blemishes  in the several arches and legs of the dome.\" (Clutterbuck, \"History of  Hertfordshire,\" vol. i., pp. 167-168; quoted in Dugdale, note, p. 173)  Clutterbuck has a great deal to say about the Strongs, father and son,  and their family.    [60] \"Parentalia,\" pp. 298, 304, _et seq._ Wren did not approve of,  though he used, the term \"Gothic.\" \"The Goths were rather destroyers  than builders; I think it [the Gothic] should with more reason be  called the _Saracen_ style\" (Ibid., p. 297). \"The Saracenick  Architecture refined by the Christians\" (Ibid., p. 306). _Cf._  Freeman, _Fortnightly Review_, October, 1872.    [61] Wren estimated that a preacher of average voice might be heard  fifty feet in front, twenty behind, and thirty on either side,  provided he did not drop his voice at the end of the sentence. He  contended that the French preachers were heard further than the  English, because they raised their voices at the end of the sentence,  just where the words often required particular emphasis to express the  meaning. The omission of this was a fault even of capable preachers,  was \"insufferable,\" and ought to be corrected at school. After two  centuries his criticism still holds good (\"Parentalia,\" p. 320). His  remarks upon architecture ought to be reprinted from the \"Parentalia,\"  and made compulsory for every student and candidate.    [62] \"Parentalia,\" pp. 281-282, shows how questions of finance entered  into Wren's conception of his famous First Design.    [63] \"Parentalia,\" p. 282.    [64] Wren's numerous designs and drawings are undated, and the  \"Parentalia\" is anything but clear. In consequence there has been a  certain amount of confusion as to the identity both of the First  Design and of the approved Warrant Design.    [65] Some say by the Bishop Humphrey Henchman, who died in the October  following; some by the surveyor, and others by the master-mason,  Strong. There seems to have been no religious service or great  ceremony.    [66] Macaulay, followed by others, speaks merely of the \"opening\"; the  prayer I have quoted from Dugdale shows that the opening was a  consecration service. I am unaware that the rest of the cathedral has  ever been consecrated; and if not, it resembles Lincoln and many  another mediaeval church (Freeman's \"Wells,\" p. 77).

PAUL'S._       [Illustration: ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL, FROM THE WEST.]          CHAPTER V.    NEW ST. PAUL'S.      EXTERIOR.    \"It would be difficult to find two works of Art designed more  essentially on the same principle than Milton's 'Paradise Lost' and  Wren's St. Paul's Cathedral. The Bible narrative transposed into the  forms of a Greek epic, required the genius of a Milton to make it  tolerable; but the splendour of even his powers does not make us less  regret that he had not poured forth the poetry with which his heart  was swelling in some form that would have freed him from the trammels  which the pedantry of his age imposed upon him. What the Iliad and the  AEneid were to Milton, the Pantheon and the Temple of Peace were to  Wren. It was necessary he should try to conceal his Christian Church  in the guise of a Roman Temple. Still the idea of the Christian  cathedral is always present, and reappears in every form, but so, too,  does that of the Heathen temple--two conflicting elements in  contact--neither subduing the other, but making their discord so  apparent as to destroy to a very considerable extent the beauty either  would possess if separate.\"[69]    I give this quotation at length, not because I by any means agree with  one half of the fault-finding, but because it helps to explain the  architecture. St. Paul's is often called \"Classical,\" or \"Roman,\" or  \"Italian\"; it is not one of these three: it is English Renaissance. It  was, too, a distinctly happy thought of Fergusson to suggest that the  Cathedral takes a like place in English architecture to that which the  immortal \"Paradise Lost\" does in English literature. The ground-plan  suggests the Gothic; the pilasters and entablature the Greek and  Roman; the round arch is found in both Roman and Romanesque, and that  commanding feature, the Dome, is the common property of many styles  and many ages. The general plan resembles the long or Latin Cross,  with transepts of greater breadth than length; and the uniformity is  broken by an apse at the east, and the two chapels at the west end.    The best views are, perhaps, the two oblique ones approaching from  Ludgate Hill and from Cannon Street. The upward view from the  churchyard on the south side by the angle of nave and transept gives  the proportions of the lower stages of the dome effectively; and those  who care to make the weary ascent of one of the Crystal Palace towers,  will be rewarded by the aspect of the dome emerging above the pall of  surrounding smoke, and appearing to preside like a watchful and  protecting deity over the destinies of the city at its feet.    The dimensions are as follows, in feet:--Length, 513, which may thus  be divided: nave and"]]]
