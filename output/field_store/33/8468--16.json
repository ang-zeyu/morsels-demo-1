If a certain amount of heat has been stored up in the  calorimeter chamber or has been abstracted from it, there should be  corrections made for the variations in the temperature of the chamber.  Such corrections are impossible unless a proper determination of the  hydrothermal equivalent has been made. A number of experiments to  determine this hydrothermal equivalent have been made and the results  are recorded beyond, together with a discussion of the nature of the  experiments. As a result of these experiments it has been possible to  make correction for the slight temperature changes in the calorimeter.    It is interesting to note that these fluctuations are small and there  may therefore be a considerable error in the determination of the  hydrothermal equivalent without particularly affecting the corrections  applied in the ordinary electrical check-test. The greatest difficulty  experienced with the calorimeter as a means of measuring heat has been  to secure the average temperature of the ingoing water. The temperature  difference between the mass of water flowing through the pipes and the  outer wall of the pipe is at best considerable. The use of the  vacuum-jacketed glass tubes has minimized the loss of heat through this  tube considerably, but it is advisable that the bulb of the thermometer  be placed exactly in the center of the water-tube, as otherwise too high  a temperature-reading will be secured. When the proper precautions are  taken to secure the correct temperature-reading, the results are most  satisfactory.    In testing both calorimeters a large number of electrical check  experiments have led to the conclusion that discrepancies in results  were invariably due, not to the loss of heat through the walls of the  calorimeter, but to erroneous measurement of the temperature of the  water-current.      DETERMINATION OF THE HYDROTHERMAL EQUIVALENT OF THE CALORIMETER.    While the temperature control of the calorimeter is such that in general  the average temperature varies but a few hundredths of a degree between  the beginning and the end of an experimental period, in extremely  accurate work it is necessary to know the amount of heat which is  absorbed with any increase in temperature. In other words, the  determination of the hydrothermal equivalent is essential.    The large majority of the methods for determining the hydrothermal  equivalent of materials are at once eliminated when the nature of the  calorimeter here used is taken into consideration. Obviously, in warming  up the chamber there are two sources of heat: first, the heat inside of  the chamber; second, the heat in the outer walls. As has been previously  described, the zinc wall is arbitrarily heated so that its temperature  fluctuations will follow exactly those of the inner wall, hence it is  impossible to compute from the weight of the metal the hydrothermal  equivalent. By means of the electrical check experiments, however, a  method for determining the hydrothermal equivalent is at hand. The  general scheme is as follows.    During an electrical check experiment, when thermal equilibrium has been  thoroughly established and the heat brought away by the water-current  exactly counterbalances the heat generated in the resistance-coil inside  the chamber, the temperature of the calorimeter is allowed to rise  slowly by raising the temperature of the ingoing water and thus bringing  away less heat. At the same time the utmost pains are taken to maintain  the adiabatic condition of the metal walls. Since the temperature is  rising during this period, it is necessary to warm the air in the outer  spaces by the electric current. By this method it is possible to raise  the temperature of the calorimeter 1 degree or more in 2 hours and  establish thermal equilibrium at the higher level. The experiment is  then continued for 2 hours at this level, and the next 2 hours the  temperature is gradually allowed to fall by lowering the temperature of  the ingoing water so that more heat is brought away than is generated,  care being taken likewise to keep the walls adiabatic. Under these  conditions the heat brought away by the water-current during the period  of rising temperature is considerably less than that actually developed  by the electric current and the difference represents the amount of heat  absorbed by the calorimeter in the period of the temperature rise.  Conversely, during the period when the temperature is falling, there is  a considerable increase in the amount of heat brought away by the  water-current over that generated in the resistance-coil and the  difference represents exactly the amount of heat given up by the  calorimeter during the fall in temperature. It is thus possible to  measure the capacity of the calorimeter for absorbing heat during a rise  in temperature and the amount of heat lost by it during cooling. A  number of such experiments have been made with both calorimeters and it  has been found that the hydrothermal equivalent of the bed calorimeter  is not far from 21 kilograms. For the chair calorimeter a somewhat lower  figure has been found, _i. e._, 19.5 kilograms.      GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF RESPIRATION APPARATUS.    This apparatus is designed much after the principle of the  Regnault-Reiset apparatus, in that there is a confined volume of air in  which the subject lives and which is purified by its passage through  vessels containing absorbents for water and carbon dioxide. Fresh oxygen  is added to this current of air and it is then returned to the chamber  to be respired. This principle, in order to be accurate for oxygen  determinations, necessitates an absolutely air-tight system and  consequently special precautions have been taken in the construction of  the chamber and accessories.      TESTING THE CHAMBER FOR TIGHTNESS.    As already suggested, the walls are constructed of the largest possible  sheets of copper with a minimum number of seams and opportunities for  leakage. In testing the apparatus for leaks, the greatest precaution is  taken. A small air-pressure is applied and the variations in height of a  delicate manometer noted. In cases of apparent leakage, all possible  sources of leak are gone over with soapsuds when there is a slight  pressure on the chamber. As a last resort, which has ultimately proven  to be the best method of testing, an assistant goes inside of the  chamber, it is then hermetically sealed, and a slight diminished  pressure is produced. Ether is then poured about the walls of the  chamber and the odor of ether soon becomes apparent inside of the  chamber if there is a leakage. Many leaks that could not be found by  soapsuds can be readily detected by this method.      VENTILATION OF THE CHAMBER.    The special features of the respiration chamber are the ventilating-pipe  system and openings for supplementary apparatus for absorption of water  and carbon dioxide. The air entering the chamber is absolutely dry and  is directed into the top of the chamber immediately above the head of  the subject. The moisture given off from the lungs and skin and the  expired gases all tend to mix readily with this dry air as it descends,  and the final mixture of gases is withdrawn through an opening near the  bottom of the chamber at the front. Under these conditions, therefore,  we believe we have a maximum intermingling of the gases. However, even  with this system of ventilation, we do not feel that there is  theoretically the best mixture of gases, and an electric fan is used  inside of the chamber. In experiments where there is considerable  regularity in the carbon-dioxide production and oxygen consumption, the  system very quickly attains a state of equilibrium, and while the  analysis of the outcoming air does not necessarily represent fairly the  actual composition of the air inside of the chamber, it evidently  represents to the same degree from hour to hour the state of equilibrium  that is usually maintained through the whole of a 6-hour experiment.    The interior of the chamber and all appliances are constructed of metal  except the chair in which the subject sits. This is of hard wood, well  shellacked, and consequently non-porous. With this calorimeter it is  desired to make studies regarding the moisture elimination, and  consequently it is necessary to avoid the use of all material of a  hygroscopic nature. Although the chair can be weighed from time to time  with great accuracy and its changes in weight obtained, it is obviously  impossible, in any type of experiment thus far made, to differentiate  between the water vaporized from the lungs and skin of the man and that  from his clothes. Subsequent experiments with a metal chair, with  minimum clothing, with cloth of different textures, without clothing,  with an oiled skin, and various other modifications affecting the  vaporization of water from the body of the man will doubtless throw more  definite light upon the question of the water elimination through the  skin. At present, however, we resort to the use of a wooden chair,  relying upon its changes in weight as noted by the balance to aid us in  apportioning the water vaporized between the man and his clothing and  the chair.    The walls of the chamber are semi-rigid. Owing to the calorimetric  features of this apparatus, it is impracticable to use heavy  boiler-plate or heavy metal walls, as the sluggishness of the changes in  temperature, the mass of metal, and its relatively large hydrothermal  equivalent would interfere seriously with the sensitiveness of the  apparatus as a calorimeter. Hence we use copper walls, with a fair  degree of rigidity, attached to a substantial structural-steel support;  and for all practical purposes the apparatus can be considered as of  constant volume. Particularly is this the case when it is considered  that the pressure inside of the chamber during an experiment never  varies from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28233"],[0,"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (#15)"],[1,"in figura prima;  hæc recta translata tanget lineam curvam in figura nova: & contra.
