The document was admirably adapted to  throw dust into the eyes of those who had expressed doubts and  misgivings; but it did not deceive Saltonstall. He saw that it would be  regarded by the other Judges, and the public in general, as an  encouragement to continue the trials; and that, under the phraseology of  what had the aspect of caution, justification would be found for the  introduction, to an extent that would control the trials, of spectral  evidence. The day after its date, he left his seat at the Council Board,  withdrew from the Court, and washed his hands of the whole matter.    The course of events demonstrates that the _Advice_ was interpreted, by  all concerned, as applauding what had been done at the first trial, and  earnestly urging that the work, thus begun, should be speedily and  vigorously prosecuted. Upon the Ministers, therefore, rests the stigma  for all that followed.    There may have been, at that time, as there was not long afterward, some  difference of opinion among the Ministers; and the paper may have had  the character of a compromise--always dangerous and vicious, bringing  some or all parties into a false position. Samuel Willard may have held,  then, the opinion expressed in a pamphlet ascribed to him, published,  probably, towards the close of the trials, that spectral evidence ought  only to be allowed where it bore upon persons of bad reputation. The  _fourth_ Section conciliated his assent to the document. This might have  been the view of Increase Mather, who, after the trials by the Special  Court were over, indicated an opinion, that time for further diligent  \"search\" ought to have been allowed, before proceeding to \"the execution  of the most capital offenders;\" and declared the very excellent  sentiment, that \"it becomes those of his profession to be very tender in  the shedding of blood.\" The expressions, \"exceeding tenderness,\" in the  _fourth_ Section, and \"the first inquiry,\" in the _fifth_--the latter  conveying the idea of repeated investigations with intervals of  time--were well adapted to gain his support of the whole instrument. If  they were led to concur in the _Advice_, by such inducements, they were  soon undeceived. \"Unblemished reputation\" was no protection; and the  proceedings at the trials were swift, summary, and conclusive.    It may be proper, at this point, to inquire what was meant by the  peculiar phraseology of the _third_, _fifth_, _seventh_, and latter part  of the _fourth_, Sections. It is difficult, writing as Cotton Mather  often did, and had great skill in doing, in what Calef calls \"the  ambidexter\" style, to ascertain his ideas. After the reaction had taken  effect in the public mind, and he was put upon the defensive, he had  much to say about some difference between him and the Judges. It clearly  had nothing to do with the \"admission\" of spectral evidence; for that  was the point on which the opinion of the Ministers was asked, and on  which he voluntarily proffered remarks in his letter to one of the  Judges, Richards. If he had been opposed to its \"admission,\" nothing  would have been easier, safer, or more demanded by the truth and his own  honor, than for him to have said so. Indeed, his writings everywhere  show that he was almost a _one idea_ man, on the subject of spectres;  and, in some way or form, deemed their evidence indispensable and  reliable. He, evidently, had some favorite plan or scheme, as to the  method in which that kind of evidence was to be handled; and it was  because he could not get it carried into effect, and for this reason  alone, so far as we can discover, that he disapproved of the methods  actually pursued by the Court. He never disclosed his plan, but shrunk  from explaining it at length, \"as too Icarian and presumptuous\" a task  for him to undertake. Let us see if we can glean his ideas from his  writings.    I call attention, in the first place, to the following clause, in his  letter to Richards: \"If, upon the bare supposal of a poor creature's  being represented by a spectre, too great a progress be made by the  authority, in ruining a poor neighbour so represented, it may be that a  door may be thereby opened for the Devils to obtain from the Courts, in  the invisible world, a license to proceed unto most hideous desolations  upon the repute and repose of such as have been kept from the great  transgression.\"    \"Too great a progress\" conveys the suggestion that, upon the  introduction of spectral evidence, there should be a delay in the  proceedings of the Court, for some intermediate steps to be taken,  before going on with the trial.    We gather other intimations, to this effect, from other passages, as  follows: \"Now, in my visiting of the miserable, I was always of this  opinion, that we were ignorant of what power the Devils might have, to  do their mischiefs in the shapes of some that had never been explicitly  engaged in diabolical confederacies, and that therefore, though many  witchcrafts had been fairly detected on enquiries provoked and begun by  spectral exhibitions, yet we could not easily be too jealous of the  snares laid for us in the device of Satan. The world knows how many  pages I have composed and published, and particular gentlemen in the  Government know how many letters I have written, to prevent the  excessive credit of spectral accusations; wherefore I have still charged  the afflicted that they should cry out of nobody for afflicting them;  but that, if this might be any advantage, they might privately tell  their minds to some one person of discretion enough to make no ill use  of their communications; accordingly there has been this effect of it,  that the name of no one good person in the world ever came under any  blemish by means of an afflicted person that fell under my particular  cognizance; yea, no one man, woman, or child ever came into any trouble,  for the sake of any that were afflicted, after I had once begun to look  after them. How often have I had this thrown into my dish, 'that many  years ago I had an opportunity to have brought forth such people as  have, in the late storm of witchcraft, been complained of, but that I  smothered it all'; and after that storm was raised at Salem, I did  myself offer to provide meat, drink, and lodging for no less than six of  the afflicted, that so an experiment might be made, whether prayer, with  fasting, upon the removal of the distressed, might not put a period to  the trouble then rising, without giving the civil authority the trouble  of prosecuting those things, which nothing but a conscientious regard  unto the cries of miserable families could have overcome the reluctance  of the honorable Judges to meddle with. In short, I do humbly but freely  affirm it, there is not a man living in this world who has been more  desirous, than the poor man I, to shelter my neighbors from the  inconveniences of spectral outcries; yea, I am very jealous I have done  so much that way, as to sin in what I have done; such have been the  cowardice and fearfulness where unto my regard to the dissatisfaction of  other people has precipitated me. I know a man in the world, who has  thought he has been able to convict some such witches as ought to die;  but his respect unto the public peace has caused him rather to try  whether he could not renew them by repentance.\"--_Calef_, 11.    The careful reader will notice that \"six of the afflicted,\" at Salem  Village, would have included nearly the whole circle of the accusing  girls there. If he had been allowed to take them into his exclusive  keeping, he would have had the whole thing in his own hands.    In his account of \"the afflictions of Margaret Rule,\" printed by Calef,  in his book, and from which the foregoing extracts have been made  speaking of the \"eight cursed spectres\" with which she was assaulted, in  the fall of 1693, Mather says: \"She was very careful of my reiterated  charges, _to forbear blazing their names_, lest any good person should  come to suffer any blast of reputation, through the cunning malice of  the great accuser; nevertheless, having since privately named them to  myself, I will venture to say this of them, that they are a sort of  wretches who, for these many years, have gone under as violent  presumptions of witchcraft as, perhaps, any creatures yet living upon  earth; although I am far from thinking that the visions of this young  woman were evidence enough to prove them so.\"--_Calef_, 4.    The following is from his _Wonders of the Invisible World_, 12: \"If once  a witch do ingeniously confess among us, no more spectres do, in their  shapes, after this, trouble the vicinage; if any guilty creatures will  accordingly, to so good purpose, confess their crime to any Minister of  God, and get out of the snare of the Devil, as no Minister will discover  such a conscientious confession, so, I believe, none in the authority  will press him to discover it, but rejoice in a soul saved from death.\"    In his _Life of Phips_, he says: \"In fine, the country was in a dreadful  ferment, and wise men foresaw a long train of dismal and bloody  consequences. Hereupon they first advised, that the _afflicted_ might be  kept asunder, in the closest privacy; and one particular person (whom I  have cause to know), in pursuance of this advice, offered himself singly  to provide accommodations for any six of them, that so the success of  more than ordinary prayer, with fasting, might, with patience, be  experienced, before any other courses were taken.\"--_Magnalia_, Book  II., p. 62.    Hutchinson gives an extract from a letter, written by John Allyn,  Secretary of Connecticut, dated, \"HARTFORD, March 18, 1693,\" to Increase  Mather, as follows: \"As to what you mention, concerning that poor  creature in your town that is afflicted, and mentioned my name to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26981"],[0,"Pan-Islam (#15)"],[1,"concentrated on finance and commerce, being also persecuted  until they perfected their defensive organisation. The consequence is  that they are individually formidable in those activities and  collectively invincible. Similarly the Turks harried the Armenians to  their own undoing with even less excuse, for those ill-used people were  certainly not interlopers, and so far from ameliorating their condition  in the course of time, as we have done with the Jews, the Turks went  from bad to worse till they culminated in atrocities which no  provocation can palliate or humanity condone.    But to return to Asia Minor; there the Armenians were first on the  ground, and yet the Moslems of Armenia outnumber them by three to one.  Any sound form of government would have to give equal rights, but it  would have to be strong and farseeing to prevent the greedy exploitation  and savage reprisals which such conditions would otherwise evolve.    On entering Asia we shall find a somewhat similar problem confronting  the administration in Syria and Palestine. Here we have several mixed  races and at least three distinct creeds--Christianity, Islam, and  Judaism.    The Zionist movement looks promising, everyone concerned seems to be in  accord, and a Jew millennium looms large in the offing, but----. In  Palestine there are normally about 700,000 Moslems and Christians (the  latter a very small minority) to 150,000 Jews. The lure of the Promised  Land will presumably increase the Jewish population enormously, but they  will still be very much in the minority unless the country is  over-populated. The Zionist organisation will naturally try to select  for emigration agriculturists, mechanics, and craftsmen generally to  develop the resources of the country, but that is easier said than done.  If Palestine, in addition to the sentimental aspect, is to be a refuge  and asylum for the downtrodden and persecuted Jews of Eastern Europe,  there would be very few farmers among _that_ lot--except tax-farmers.  Even in England, where he labours under no landowning disability, the  Jew thinks that farming for a living is a mug's game and confines his  agricultural activities to week-ends in the autumn with a \"hammerless  ejector\" and a knickerbocker suit. As for mechanics and skilled labour  generally, such Jews as take to it usually excel in such work and do  very well where they are. The bulk of the immigrant population--unless  Palestine is going to be artificially colonised without regard for the  necessitous claims of the very people who should be drawn off  there--will be indigent artisans, small shopkeepers, shop assistants,  weedy unemployables, and a sprinkling of shrewd operators on the  look-out for prey. If the scheme is going to be run entirely on  philanthropic lines (and there are ample resources and charity at the  back of it to do so) the Zionists will be all right, and will, perhaps,  improve immensely in the next generation under the influence of an  open-air life--if they adopt it; but the resident majority of Moslems  and Christians will not take too kindly to their new compatriots, while  the Palestine Jews are already carping at the idea of so many trade  rivals and accusing them of not being orthodox. None of this ill-feeling  need matter in the long run with a firm but benevolent government, but  the authorities will have to evolve some legislation to check  profiteering and over-exploitation, or there will be trouble. It is not  only the new-comers who will want curbing, but the present population.  During the War the flagrant profiteering of Jew and Christian operators  in Palestine and Syria did much to accentuate the appalling distress and  was the more disgraceful compared with the magnificent efforts of the  American and Anglican Churches to relieve the situation. The Jews nearly  incurred a pogrom by their operations, which were only checked by a  wealthy Syrian in Egypt starting a co-operative venture of low-priced  foodstuffs and necessities with the support of the British authorities.  As for the local Syrians, some of them were even worse. French and  British officers speak of wealthy Syrians (presumably Christian,  certainly not Moslem) giving many and sumptuous balls at Beyrout, at  which they lapped Austrian champagne while their wives, blazing in  diamonds, whirled with Hunnish officers in the high-pressure,  double-action German waltz. And this with thousands of their compatriots  starving in the streets and little naked children banding together to  drive pariah dogs with stones from the street offal they were worrying,  if perchance it might yield a meal. Meanwhile decent Anglo-Saxon  Christendom was battling in that very town under adverse conditions to  succour human destitution which had been largely caused by the callous  operations of these soulless parasites. The Christians of Syria have no  monopoly of such scandals. Yet there are otherwise intelligent people  who speak of modern Christianity as an automatic promoter of ethics, and  have the effrontery to try to thrust it on the East as a moral panacea.  It is human ideals which make or mar a soul when once the seed of any  sound religion has been sown, and they depend upon environment and  climate more than our spiritual pastors admit; otherwise, why this  missionary activity among oriental Christians? If you try to grow garden  flowers in the rich, rank irrigation soil of the Nile valley they  flourish luxuriantly, but soon develop a marked tendency to revert to  their wild type, and it is permissible to suppose that human character  is even more sensitive to its mental and physical surroundings. Any  observant teacher of oriental youth will tell you that the promise of  their precocious ability is seldom fulfilled by their maturity. Even the  \"country-born\" children of British parents are considered precocious at  their preparatory school in England, and, if not sent home to be  educated, are apt to fall short of their parents' intellectual and  moral standard in later years. The Mamelukes knew what they were about  when they kidnapped hardy Albanian youths to carry on their rule in  Egypt and passed over their own progeny. Kingsley has shown us in  \"Hypatia\" what the Nile valley did for the Christian Church.    It is not a question of Jew, Christian, or Moslem that the  administrative authorities in Syria and Palestine will have to consider  beyond ensuring that each shall follow his religion unmolested. They  will have to defend the many from the machinations of the few and the  few from the violent reprisals of the many. It is statecraft that is  wanted, not politics or religious dogma.    In Mesopotamia there has not been much missionary effort hitherto, and  there is not a good case for exploiting it as a missionary field beyond  certain limits. The riparian townsfolk are respectable people of some  education and grasp of their own affairs, and the country-folk are a  harum-scarum set of scallywags who used to attack Turks or British  indifferently, whichever happened to be in difficulties for the moment.  They are best left to the secular arm for some time to come. Medical  missions, staffed by both sexes, could do good work at urban centres,  and a few river steamers, or even launches, would extend their efforts  considerably.    We now come to Arabia itself, \"the Peninsula of the Arabs,\" where  orthodox Islam has its strongholds and missionary enterprise is not  encouraged.    Geographers differ somewhat as to what constitutes Arabia proper, but  for the purposes of modern practical politics it may be considered as  all the peninsula south of a line from the head of the Gulf of Akaba to  the head of the Persian Gulf, and consisting of Nejd, the Hejaz,[C]  Asir, Yamen, Aden protectorate, Hadhramaut and Oman. Each of these  divisions should be dealt with separately in considering Arabian  politics nowadays, and it will be well for the \"mandatories\" concerned  if further sub-divisions do not complicate matters; I omit the  sub-province of Hasa (once a dependency of the Turkish _pashalik_ at  Bussora) because, since the Nejdi _coup d'etat_ in 1912, the Emir ibn  Saoud will probably control its policy _vis-a-vis_ of missionaries and  Europeans generally, though the Sheikh of Koweit may expect to be  consulted.    Nejd comes first as we move southward: impinging as it does on Syria,  Mesopotamia, and the Hejaz, its politics are involved in theirs to a  certain extent and its affairs require careful handling. It is certainly  no field for unrestrained missionary effort, but there is no reason why  a medical mission should not be posted at Riadh if the Emir is willing.  There are two rival houses in Nejd--the ibn Saoud and ibn Rashid, the  former pro-British and the latter (hitherto) pro-Turk; Emir Saoud held  ascendancy before the War and should be able to maintain it now that  Turco-German influence is a thing of the past. He is an enlightened,  energetic man and was a close friend of our gallant \"political,\" the  late Captain Shakespeare, who was killed there early in the War during  an engagement between the two rival houses. The question of missionary  enterprise in Nejd could well be put before the Emir for consideration  on its merits. Such procedure may seem weak to an out-and-out  missionary, but even he would hesitate to keep poultry in another man's  garden, even for economic purposes, without consulting him. Fowls and  missionaries are useful and even desirable in a suitable environment,  otherwise they can be a nuisance.    Next in order as we travel is the Hejaz, where Islam started on its  mission to harry exotic creeds and nations, until its conquering  progress was checked decisively by reinvigorated Christendom. In  missionary parlance, Arabia generally is referred to as \"a Gibraltar of  fanaticism and pride which shuts out the messenger of Christ,\" and it  must be admitted that the Hejaz has hitherto"]]]
