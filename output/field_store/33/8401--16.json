It was  getting near the end of her vacation and she had only two weeks more.  They were sitting down to rest on the side of the road when she  mentioned this fact inconsequently. The professor prodded the harmless  dust with his cane. Well, he supposed she would find a return to work  pleasant and would doubtless be glad to see her Riverton friends  again.    \"I'm dying to see Edith,\" said Katherine.    \"And Ned?\" suggested Professor Keith.    \"Oh yes. Ned, of course,\" assented Katherine without enthusiasm. There  didn't seem to be anything more to say. One cannot talk everlastingly  about ferns, so they got up and went home.    Katherine wrote a particularly affectionate letter to Ned that night.  Then she went to bed and cried.    When Professor Keith came up to bid Miss Rangely good-bye on the eve  of her departure from Harbour Hill, he looked like a man who was being  led to execution without benefit of clergy. But he kept himself well  in hand and talked calmly on impersonal subjects. After all, it was  Katherine who made the first break when she got up to say good-bye.  She was in the middle of some conventional sentence when she suddenly  stopped short, and her voice trailed off in a babyish quiver.    The professor put out his arm and drew her close to him. His hat  dropped under their feet and was trampled on, but I doubt if Professor  Keith knows the difference to this day, for he was fully absorbed in  kissing Katherine's hair. When she became cognizant of this fact, she  drew herself away.    \"Oh, Sidney, don't!--think of Edith! I feel like a traitor.\"    \"Do you think she would care very much if I--if you--if we--\"  hesitated the professor.    \"Oh, it would break her heart,\" cried Katherine with convincing  earnestness. \"I know it would--and Ned's too. They must never know.\"    The professor stooped and began hunting for his maltreated hat. He was  a long time finding it, and when he did he went softly to the door.  With his hand on the knob, he paused and looked back.    \"Good-bye, Miss Rangely,\" he said softly.    But Katherine, whose face was buried in the cushions of the lounge,  did not hear him and when she looked up he was gone.           *       *       *       *       *    Katharine felt that life was stale, flat and unprofitable when she  alighted at Riverton station in the dusk of the next evening. She was  not expected until a later train and there was no one to meet her. She  walked drearily through the streets to her boarding house and entered  her room unannounced. Edith, who was lying on the bed, sprang up with  a surprised greeting. It was too dark to be sure, but Katherine had an  uncomfortable suspicion that her friend had been crying, and her heart  quaked guiltily. Could Edith have suspected anything?    \"Why, we didn't think you'd be up till the 8:30 train, and Ned and I  were going to meet you.\"    \"I found I could catch an earlier train, so I took it,\" said  Katherine, as she dropped listlessly into a chair. \"I am tired to  death and I have such a headache. I can't see anyone tonight, not even  Ned.\"    \"You poor dear,\" said Edith sympathetically, beginning a search for  the cologne. \"Lie down on the bed and I'll bathe your poor head. Did  you have a good time at Harbour Hill? And how did you leave Sid? Did  he say anything about coming up?\"    \"Oh, he was quite well,\" said Katherine wearily. \"I didn't hear him  say if he intended to come up or not. There, thanks--that will do  nicely.\"    After Edith had gone down, Katherine tossed about restlessly. She knew  Ned had come and she did not want to see him. But, after all, it was  only putting off the evil day, and it was treating him rather  shabbily. She would go down for a minute.    There were two doors to the parlour, and Katherine went by way of the  library one, over which a portiere was hanging. Her hand was lifted to  draw it back when she heard something that arrested the movement.    A woman was crying in the room beyond. It was Edith--and what was she  saying?    \"Oh, Ned, it is all perfectly dreadful! I couldn't look Catherine in  the face when she came home. I'm so ashamed of myself and I never  meant to be so false. We must never let her suspect for a minute.\"    \"It's pretty rough on a fellow,\" said another voice--Ned's voice--in a  choked sort of a way. \"Upon my word, Edith, I don't see how I'm going  to keep it up.\"    \"You must,\" sobbed Edith. \"It would break her heart--and Sidney's too.  We must just make up our minds to forget each other, Ned, and you must  marry Katherine.\"    Just at this point Katherine became aware that she was eavesdropping  and she went away noiselessly. She did not look in the least like a  person who has received a mortal blow, and she had forgotten her  headache altogether.    When Edith came up half an hour later, she found the worn-out invalid  sitting up and reading a novel.    \"How is your headache, dear?\" she asked, carefully keeping her face  turned away from Katherine.    \"Oh, it's all gone,\" said Miss Rangely cheerfully.    \"Why didn't you come down then? Ned was here.\"    \"Well, Ede, I did go down, but I thought I wasn't particularly wanted,  so I came back.\"    Edith faced her friend in dismay, forgetful of swollen lids and  tear-stained cheeks.    \"Katherine!\"    \"Don't look so conscience stricken, my dear child. There is no harm  done.\"    \"You heard--\"    \"Some surprising speeches. So you and Ned have gone and fallen in love  with one another?\"    \"Oh, Katherine,\" sobbed Edith, \"we--we--couldn't help it--but it's all  over. Oh, don't be angry with me!\"    \"Angry? My dear, I'm delighted.\"    \"Delighted?\"    \"Yes, you dear goose. Can't you guess, or must I tell you? Sidney and  I did the very same, and had just such a melancholy parting last night  as I suspect you and Ned had tonight.\"    \"Katherine!\"    \"Yes, it's quite true. And of course we made up our minds to sacrifice  ourselves on the altar of duty and all that. But now, thank goodness,  there is no need of such wholesale immolation. So just let's forgive  each other.\"    \"Oh,\" sighed Edith happily, \"it is almost too good to be true.\"    \"It is really providentially ordered, isn't it?\" said Katherine. \"Ned  and I would never have got on together in the world, and you and  Sidney would have bored each other to death. As it is, there will be  four perfectly happy people instead of four miserable ones. I'll tell  Ned so tomorrow.\"          Four Winds      Alan Douglas threw down his pen with an impatient exclamation. It was  high time his next Sunday's sermon was written, but he could not  concentrate his thoughts on his chosen text. For one thing he did not  like it and had selected it only because Elder Trewin, in his call of  the evening before, had hinted that it was time for a good stiff  doctrinal discourse, such as his predecessor in Rexton, the Rev. Jabez  Strong, had delighted in. Alan hated doctrines--\"the soul's  staylaces,\" he called them--but Elder Trewin was a man to be reckoned  with and Alan preached an occasional sermon to please him.    \"It's no use,\" he said wearily. \"I could have written a sermon in  keeping with that text in November or midwinter, but now, when the  whole world is reawakening in a miracle of beauty and love, I can't do  it. If a northeast rainstorm doesn't set in before next Sunday, Mr.  Trewin will not have his sermon. I shall take as my text instead,  'The flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of birds has  come.'\"    He rose and went to his study window, outside of which a young vine  was glowing in soft tender green tints, its small dainty leaves  casting quivering shadows on the opposite wall where the portrait of  Alan's mother hung. She had a fine, strong, sweet face; the same face,  cast in a masculine mould, was repeated in her son, and the  resemblance was striking as he stood in the searching evening  sunshine. The black hair grew around his forehead in the same way; his  eyes were steel blue, like hers, with a similar expression, half  brooding, half tender, in their depths. He had the mobile, smiling  mouth of the picture, but his chin was deeper and squarer, dented with  a dimple which, combined with a certain occasional whimsicality of  opinion and glance, had caused Elder Trewin some qualms of doubt  regarding the fitness of this young man for his high and holy  vocation. The Rev. Jabez Strong had never indulged in dimples or  jokes; but then, as Elder Trewin, being a just man, had to admit, the  Rev. Jabez Strong had preached many a time and oft to more empty pews  than full ones, while now the church was crowded to its utmost  capacity on Sundays and people came to hear Mr. Douglas who had not  darkened a church door for years. All things considered, Elder Trewin  decided to overlook the dimple. There was sure to be some drawback in  every minister.    Alan from his study looked down on all the length of the Rexton  valley, at the head of which the manse was situated, and thought that  Eden might have looked so in its innocence, for all the orchards were  abloom and the distant hills were tremulous and aerial in springtime  gauzes of pale purple and pearl. But in any garden, despite its  beauty, is an element of tameness and domesticity, and Alan's eyes,  after a moment's delighted gazing, strayed wistfully off to the north  where the hills broke away into a long sloping lowland of pine and  fir. Beyond it stretched the wide expanse of the lake, flashing in the  molten gold and crimson of evening. Its lure was irresistible. Alan  had been born and bred beside a faraway sea and the love of it was  strong in his heart--so strong that he knew he must go back to it  sometime. Meanwhile, the great lake, mimicking the sea in its vast  expanse and the storms that often swept over it, was his comfort and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24878"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1909 to 1922 (#15)"],[1," given his useless  little life for Bessie, and thenceforth the time he was not devising  mischief he spent in bringing little pleasures into her life. It was  Tommy's delight to bring that smile to her pale little face and a look  of pleasure into her big, patient blue eyes. The other boys on the  street tried to tease Bessie at first and shouted \"Cripple!\" after her  when she limped out. But they soon stopped it. Tommy thrashed them  all one after another for it, and Bessie was left in peace. She would  have had a very lonely life if it had not been for Tommy, for she  could not play with the other children. But Tommy was as good as a  dozen playmates, and Bessie thought him the best boy in the world.  Tommy, whatever he might be with others, was very careful to be good  when he was with Bessie. He never said a rude word in her hearing, and  he treated her as if she were a little princess. Miss Octavia would  have been amazed beyond measure if she had seen how tender and  thoughtful and kind and chivalrous that neglected urchin of a Tommy  could be when he tried.    Tommy found Bessie sitting by the kitchen window, looking dreamily out  of it. For just a moment Tommy thought uneasily that Bessie was  looking very pale and thin this spring.    \"Bessie, come for a walk up to Mr. Blacklock's store,\" he said  eagerly. \"There is something there I want to show you.\"    \"What is it?\" Bessie wanted to know. But Tommy only winked  mysteriously.    \"Ah, I ain't going to tell you. But it's something awful pretty. Just  you wait.\"    Bessie reached for her crutch and the two went up to the store, Tommy  carefully suiting his steps to Bessie's slow ones. Just before they  reached the store he made her shut her eyes and led her to the window.    \"Now--look!\" he commanded dramatically.    Bessie looked and Tommy was rewarded. She flushed pinkly with delight  and clasped her hands in ecstasy.    \"Oh, Tommy, isn't she perfectly beautiful?\" she breathed. \"Oh, she's  the very loveliest dolly I ever saw. Oh, Tommy!\"    \"I thought you'd like her,\" said Tommy exultantly. \"Don't you wish you  had a doll like that of your very own, Bessie?\"    Bessie looked almost rebuking, as if Tommy had asked her if she  wouldn't like a golden crown or a queen's palace.    \"Of course I could never have a dolly like that,\" she said. \"She must  cost an awful lot. But it's enough just to look at her. Tommy, will  you bring me up here every day just to look at her?\"    \"'Course,\" said Tommy.    Bessie talked about the blue-silk doll all the way home and dreamed of  her every night. \"I'm going to call her Roselle Geraldine,\" she said.  After that she went up to see Roselle Geraldine every day, gazing at  her for long moments in silent rapture. Tommy almost grew jealous of  her; he thought Bessie liked the doll better than she did him.    \"But it don't matter a bit if she does,\" he thought loyally, crushing  down the jealousy. \"If she likes to like it better than me, it's all  right.\"    Sometimes, though, Tommy felt uneasy. It was plain to be seen that  Bessie had set her heart on that doll. And what would she do when the  doll was sold, as would probably happen soon? Tommy thought Bessie  would feel awful sad, and he would be responsible for it.    What Tommy feared came to pass. One afternoon, when they went up to  Mr. Blacklock's store, the doll was not in the window.    \"Oh,\" cried Bessie, bursting into tears, \"she's gone--Roselle  Geraldine is gone.\"    \"Perhaps she isn't sold,\" said Tommy comfortingly. \"Maybe they only  took her out of the window 'cause the blue silk would fade. I'll go in  and ask.\"    A minute later Tommy came out looking sober.    \"Yes, she's sold, Bessie,\" he said. \"Mr. Blacklock sold her to a lady  yesterday. Don't cry, Bessie--maybe they'll put another in the window  'fore long.\"    \"It won't be mine,\" sobbed Bessie. \"It won't be Roselle Geraldine. It  won't have a blue silk hat and such cunning brown eyes.\"    Bessie cried quietly all the way home, and Tommy could not comfort  her. He wished he had never shown her the doll in the window.    From that day Bessie drooped, and Tommy watched her in agony. She grew  paler and thinner. She was too tired to go out walking, and too tired  to do the little household tasks she had delighted in. She never spoke  about Roselle Geraldine, but Tommy knew she was fretting about her.  Mrs. Knox could not think what ailed the child.    \"She don't take a bit of interest in nothing,\" she complained to Mrs.  Puffer. \"She don't eat enough for a bird. The doctor, he says there  ain't nothing the matter with her as he can find out, but she's just  pining away.\"    Tommy heard this, and a queer, big lump came up in his throat. He had  a horrible fear that he, Tommy Puffer, was going to cry. To prevent it  he began to whistle loudly. But the whistle was a failure, very unlike  the real Tommy-whistle. Bessie was sick--and it was all his fault,  Tommy believed. If he had never taken her to see that hateful,  blue-silk doll, she would never have got so fond of it as to be  breaking her heart because it was sold.    \"If I was only rich,\" said Tommy miserably, \"I'd buy her a cartload of  dolls, all dressed in blue silk and all with brown eyes. But I can't  do nothing.\"    By this time Tommy had reached the paling in front of Miss Octavia's  lawn, and from force of habit he stopped to look over it. But there  was not much to see this time, only the little green rows and circles  in the brown, well-weeded beds, and the long curves of dahlia plants,  which Miss Octavia had set out a few days before. All the geraniums  were carried in, and the blinds were down. Tommy knew Miss Octavia was  away. He had seen her depart on the train that morning, and heard her  tell a friend that she was going down to Chelton to visit her  brother's folks and wouldn't be back until the next day.    Tommy was still leaning moodily against the paling when Mrs. Jenkins  and Mrs. Reid came by, and they too paused to look at the garden.    \"Dear me, how cold it is!\" shivered Mrs. Reid. \"There's going to be a  hard frost tonight. Octavia's flowers will be nipped as sure as  anything. It's a wonder she'd stay away from them overnight when her  heart's so set on them.\"    \"Her brother's wife is sick,\" said Mrs. Jenkins. \"We haven't had any  frost this spring, and I suppose Octavia never thought of such a  thing. She'll feel awful bad if her flowers get frosted, especially  them dahlias. Octavia sets such store by her dahlias.\"    Mrs. Jenkins and Mrs. Reid moved away, leaving Tommy by the paling. It  was cold--there was going to be a hard frost--and Miss Octavia's  plants and flowers would certainly be spoiled. Tommy thought he ought  to be glad, but he wasn't. He was sorry--not for Miss Octavia, but for  her flowers. Tommy had a queer, passionate love for flowers in his  twisted little soul. It was a shame that they should be nipped--that  all the glory of crimson and purple and gold hidden away in those  little green rows and circles should never have a chance to blossom  out royally. Tommy could never have put this thought into words, but  it was there in his heart. He wished he could save the flowers. And  couldn't he? Newspapers spread over the beds and tied around the  dahlias would save them, Tommy knew. He had seen Miss Octavia doing it  other springs. And he knew there was a big box of newspapers in a  little shed in her backyard. Ned Williams had told him there was, and  that the shed was never locked.    Tommy hurried home as quickly as he could and got a ball of twine out  of his few treasures. Then he went back to Miss Octavia's garden.    The next forenoon Miss Octavia got off the train at the Arundel  station with a very grim face. There had been an unusually severe  frost for the time of year. All along the road Miss Octavia had seen  gardens frosted and spoiled. She knew what she should see when she got  to her own--the dahlia stalks drooping and black and limp, the  nasturtiums and balsams and poppies and pansies all withered and  ruined.    But she didn't. Instead she saw every dahlia carefully tied up in a  newspaper, and over all the beds newspapers spread out and held neatly  in place with pebbles. Miss Octavia flew into her garden with a  radiant face. Everything was safe--nothing was spoiled.    But who could have done it? Miss Octavia was puzzled. On one side of  her lived Mrs. Kennedy, who had just moved in and, being a total  stranger, would not be likely to think of Miss Octavia's flowers. On  the other lived Miss Matheson, who was a \"shut-in\" and spent all her  time on the sofa. But to Miss Matheson Miss Octavia went.    \"Rachel, do you know who covered my plants up last night?\"    Miss Matheson nodded. \"Yes, it was Tommy Puffer. I saw him working  away there with papers and twine. I thought you'd told him to do it.\"    \"For the land's sake!\" ejaculated Miss Octavia. \"Tommy Puffer! Well,  wonders will never cease.\"    Miss Octavia went back to her house feeling rather ashamed of herself  when she remembered how she had always treated Tommy Puffer.    \"But there must be some good in the child, or he wouldn't have done  this,\" she said to herself. \"I've been real mean, but I'll make it up  to him.\"    Miss Octavia did not see Tommy that day, but when he passed the next  morning she ran to the door and called him.    \"Tommy, Tommy Puffer, come in here!\"    Tommy came reluctantly. He didn't like Miss Octavia any better than he  had, and he didn't know what she wanted of him. But Miss Octavia soon  informed him without loss of words.    \"Tommy, Miss Matheson tells me that it was you who saved my flowers  from the frost the other night. I'm very much obliged to you indeed.  Whatever made you think of doing it?\"    \"I hated to see the flowers spoiled,\" muttered Tommy, who was feeling  more uncomfortable than he had ever felt in his life.    \"Well, it was real thoughtful of you. I'm sorry I've been so hard"]]]
