[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22606"],[0,"The Booklover and His Books (#15)"],[1," true alphabets, which are representations of sound, have  been derived from such primitive ideograms or pictures of ideas. What  was the process?    The rebus is the bridge from the writing of thoughts to the writing of  sounds, and it came into use through the necessity of writing proper  names. Every ancient name, like many modern ones, had a meaning. A  king's name might be Wolf, and it would be indicated by the picture of a  wolf. Ordinarily the picture would be named by everyone who saw it  according to his language; he might call it \"wolf,\" or \"lupus,\" or  \"lykos\"; but when it meant a man's name he must call it Wolf, whatever  his own language. So such names as Long Knife and Strong Arm would be  represented, and these pictures would thus be associated with the sound  rather than the thing. By and by it was found convenient, where the word  had several syllables, to use its picture to represent the sound of only  the first syllable, and, still later, of only the first sound or letter.  Thus the Egyptian symbol for F was originally a picture of the horned  asp, later it stood for the Egyptian name of this venomous creature, and  finally for the first sound in the name, being used as the letter F  itself; and the reason why we have the barred cross-piece in the F, the  two horns in U, V, and Y, and the four in W (VV) is because the Egyptian  asp had two horns, as may be seen from the illustration in the Century  Dictionary under the word cerastes; and every time that we write one of  these letters we are making a faded copy of the old picture. We find  systems of writing in all the stages from pure pictures to the phonetic  alphabet; in Egyptian hieroglyphics we find a mixture of all the stages.  So much for the background of the book as the bringer of a message to  the eye, but the outward form or wrapping of that message has also a  long and interesting history.    No objects could be much more unlike than a Babylonian tablet, an  Egyptian papyrus roll, and a Mexican book. They are as different as a  brick, a narrow window-shade, and a lady's fan; they have nothing common  in their development, yet they were used for the same purpose and might  bring identically the same message to the mind. Inwardly, as regards  writing or printing, all books have a parallel development; but  outwardly, in their material and its form, they are the results of local  conditions. In Babylonia, which was a fertile river-bottom, bricks were  the only building material, and clay was therefore a familiar substance.  Nothing was more natural than that the Babylonian should scratch his  record or message on a little pat of clay, which he could afterwards  bake and render permanent. Some day all other books in the world will  have crumbled into dust, their records being saved only when reproduced;  but at that remote time there will still exist Babylonian books, even  now five thousand years old, apparently no nearer destruction than when  they were first made.    The Babylonian book carried its message all on the outside; the Egyptian  book went to the opposite extreme, and we should find our chief  objection to it in the difficulty of getting readily at its contents.  There flourished on the banks of the Nile a stout reed, six feet high,  called by the Egyptians \"p-apa\" and by the Greeks \"papyros\" or \"byblos.\"  It was the great source of raw material for Egyptian manufactures. Its  tufted head was used for garlands; its woody root for various purposes;  its tough rind for ropes, shoes, and similar articles--the basket of  Moses, for instance; and its cellular pith for a surface to write on. As  the stem was jointed, the pith came in lengths, the best from eight to  ten inches. These lengths were sliced through from top to bottom, and  the thin slices laid side by side. Another layer was pasted crosswise  above these, the whole pressed, dried in the sun, and rubbed smooth,  thus giving a single sheet of papyrus. As the grain ran differently on  the two surfaces of the papyrus sheet, only one side was written on.  Other sheets were added to this by pasting them edge to edge until  enough for a roll had been made, usually twenty, a roller being fastened  to the last edge and a protecting strip of wood to the front. The  manuscript was unrolled by the right hand and rolled up by the left. It  is obvious that a book of reference in this form would be subjected to  great wear. In our dictionaries it is as easy to find Z as A; but in a  papyrus book, to find the end meant to unroll the whole. The Latin word  for roll was \"volumen,\" hence our \"volume.\" A long work could obviously  not be produced conveniently in a single roll, therefore Homer's \"Iliad\"  and \"Odyssey,\" for instance, were each divided into twenty-four books,  and that is why the divisions of an epic poem are still called books,  though they are really chapters. The rolls composing a single work were  kept together in a case something like a bandbox. The roll was the book  form of the Greek and Roman as well as the Egyptian world, but it left  no descendants. Our book form was derived from a different source, which  we will now consider.    Just as we speak of Russia leather, so the ancients spoke of Pergamum  skins, or parchment. The story is that Eumenes II, King of Pergamum, a  city of Asia Minor, tried to build up a library rivaling that of  Alexandria, and the Ptolemies, seeking to thwart him, forbade the export  of papyrus from Egypt. Eumenes, however, developed the manufacture of  Pergamum skin, or parchment, or vellum, which not only enabled him to  go on with his library, but also incidentally changed the whole  character of the book for future ages. This material is not only much  more serviceable than the fragile papyrus, but, being tough enough to  stand folding and sewing, permitted the book to be made in its present  or codex form, the original codex being two or three Roman waxed tablets  of wood, fastened together like hinged slates, and thus opening very  crudely in the manner of our books. This development of parchment  occurred in the first half of the second century before Christ. The new  material and book form gradually made their way into favor and came to  constitute the book of the early Christian and medieval world. Though  paper was introduced into Europe soon after the year seven hundred, it  did not displace parchment until the invention of printing called for a  material of its cheaper and more adaptable character.    But, though we have traced the origin of our present book form, we have  not yet filled in the background of its history. Several other notable  types of the book deserve our attention; first of all that of China, one  of the most attractive of all book forms, to which we devote our next  chapter. Though it superficially resembles our own books, it is really  the product of a different line of evolution. When we examine it  closely, we find that in many respects it is the exact reverse of our  practice. It is printed on only one side of the paper; it is trimmed at  the back and folded on the fore edge; its wide margin is at the top; its  running headline is on the folded fore edge; its sewing is on the  outside; its binding is limp; its lines run up and down the page; and  its pages, according to Western ideas, open from the back towards the  front. Yet it is a thing of beauty, and let us hope that nothing in the  modern reorganization of China will change its character to prevent it  from remaining a joy forever.    Just as Chinese paper is made from bamboo, which plays an even greater  part in China than papyrus did in Egypt, so the book of India utilizes  the leaves of that important tropical tree, the palm. The sheets of the  book before me are strips of palm-leaf two inches wide and two feet  long. They are written on both sides and, following the run of the  grain, lengthwise. This makes an inordinate length of line, but, owing  to the small number of lines on the page, the confusion of the eye is  less than might be expected. The leaves composing the book are clamped  between two boards of their own size, the block thus formed is pierced  with two holes, through which pins are thrust, and the whole is wound  with a cord. The dimensions vary, some books being larger and some much  smaller. I have also before me a Burmese booklet in which the leaves are  one inch wide and six inches long. Sometimes the sheets are of brass,  beautifully lacquered, and the writing heavy and highly decorative.  These books also vary greatly in size, some forming truly massive and  sumptuous volumes. Birch bark was also employed as a book material in  India, being used in what we should call quarto sheets, and in Farther  India a peculiar roll is in use, made of Chinese paper, folded at the  side, sewed at the top, and rolled up like a manifold banner in a cover  of orange-colored or brown cotton cloth.    We do not ordinarily associate books with pre-Columbian America; yet one  of the most interesting of all book forms was current in Mexico before  the Conquest. As in the case of the Chinese book, it looks superficially  like ours; we think it is a tiny quarto until we see that its measure is  rather that of an oblong twenty-fourmo; that is, its dimensions are just  scant of five inches high and six inches wide. It has thin wooden covers  and is, over all, an inch thick; but between these covers is a strip of  deerskin twenty-nine feet long and, of course, nearly five inches wide.  This is folded in screen or fan fashion, the first and last leaves being  pasted to the inside of the covers. This attachment is really the only  binding; the whole strip is capable of being opened up to its full  length. It is read--by those who can read its vividly colored  hieroglyphics--by holding it like a modern book, turning the leaves  until what seems the end is reached, and then turning the cover for the  next leaf, and continuing to turn until the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22607"],[0,"The Book-Hunter in London (#15)"],[1,"reserving, however,  some of his choicest books, pictures, and curiosities. In the following  year the whole collection was dispersed by Phillips, the auctioneer, the  sale occupying thirty-seven days. With the money he received from  Farquhar, Beckford purchased annuities and land near Bath. He united two  houses in the Royal Crescent by a flying gallery extending over the  road, and his dwelling became one vast library. He added to his  collection up to his last days, and obtained many books at Charles  Nodier's sale. Beckford was one of the greatest book-enthusiasts that  ever lived. His passion was more particularly for Aldines, and other  early books bearing the insignia of celebrities, such as Frances I.,  Henri et Diane, and De Thou, and especially of choice old morocco  bindings by Desseuil, Padeloup, and Derome. He was especially strong in  old French and Italian books, generically classified as _facetiae_.  Beckford would read for days and weeks at a stretch, with no more  recreation than an occasional ride. That he read his books there is  ample testimony, for at his sale one lot comprised seven folio volumes  of transcripts from the autograph notes written by him on the fly-leaves  of the various works in his library. For example, to the copy of Peter  Beckford's 'Familiar Letters from Italy,' 1805, he concludes five pages  of notes with, 'This book has at least some merit. The language is  simple; an ill-natured person might add, and the thoughts not less so.'  In Brasbridge's 'Fruits of Experience,' 1824, he writes: 'They who like  hog-wash--and there are amateurs for anything--will not turn away  disappointed or disgusted with this book, but relish the stale, trashy  anecdotes it contains, and gobble them up with avidity.' After  Beckford's death, Henry G. Bohn offered L30,000 for the whole library;  but Beckford's second daughter, who married the Duke of Hamilton,  refused to sanction the sale. It, however, came under the hammer at  Sotheby's, 1881-1884, in four parts of twelve days each, the net result  being L73,551 18s.    The tenth Duke of Hamilton was one of the most distinguished  bibliophiles of his time, and commenced purchasing whilst yet Marquis of  Douglas. A large portion of his library was collected in Italy and  various parts of the Continent, whilst the collection of Greek and Latin  manuscripts which he obtained when on a diplomatic mission to Russia  formed an unrivalled series of monuments of early art. In 1810 he  married Susanna Beckford, and at her father's death the whole of his  splendid library came into his possession. The two collections, however,  were kept quite distinct. The Hamilton collection of printed books was  sold at Sotheby's in May, 1884, the eight days realizing L12,892 12s.  6d. The most important feature of the library, however, was the  magnificent collection of MSS. which the Prussian Government secured by  private treaty--through the intermediary, it is understood, of the  Empress Frederick--for L70,000. In May, 1889, those which the  authorities decided not to retain for the Royal Museum at Berlin were  transferred to Messrs. Sotheby's, and ninety-one lots realized the total  of L15,189 15s. 6d. The gems of the collection were a magnificent volume  of the Golden Gospels in Latin of the eighth century, formerly a gift to  Henry VIII., which sold for L1,500--a London bookseller once offered  L5,000 for this book--and a magnificent MS. of Boccaccio, 'Les Illustres  Malheureux,' on vellum, 321 leaves, decorated with eighty-four exquisite  miniatures, which sold for L1,700. It may be mentioned that a large  number of the Beckford and Hamilton books were purchased through the  late H. G. Bohn.    [Illustration: _George John, Earl Spencer._]    The Althorp Library, now in the possession of Mrs. Rylands, of  Manchester, was formed by George John, Earl Spencer (1758-1834),  between 1790 and 1820. Until its recent removal from Althorp it was the  finest private library in existence. In 1790 Lord Spencer acquired the  very fine and select library of Count Rewiczki, the Emperor Joseph's  Ambassador in London, for about L2,500, and for the next thirty years  the Earl was continually hunting after books in the sale-rooms and  booksellers' shops. The story of the Althorp Library has been so  repeatedly told, from the time of its first librarian, the devil-hunting  Thomas Frognall Dibdin--whose flatulent and sycophantic records are not  to be taken as mirroring the infinitely superior intellect and taste of  his employer--down to the present day, that any further description is  almost superfluous. Besides this, the library is one which will soon be  open to all. We may, however, mention a point which is of great  interest in the study of books as an investment. It may reasonably be  doubted whether the Althorp Library cost its founder much over L100,000;  it is generally understood that the price paid for it in 1892 was not  far short of L250,000.    [Illustration: _John, Duke of Roxburghe, Book-collector._]    Contemporaneously with the formation of the Althorp Collection, the Duke  of Roxburghe built a library, which was one of the finest and most  perfect ever got together. The Duke turned book-hunter through a love  affair, it is said. He was to have been married to the eldest daughter  of the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz; but when this lady's sister was  selected as a wife for George III., the proposed marriage was deemed  impolitic, and consequently the Duke remained single. The Duke himself  is said to have traced his passion for books to the famous dinner given  by his father, the second Duke, at which Lords Oxford and Sunderland  were present, and at which the celebrated copy of the Valdarfer  Boccaccio was produced. The history of this incident is told in our  chapter on Book-sales, and need not be here more specifically referred  to. The Duke was a mighty hunter, not only of books, but of deer and  wild swans. So far as books are concerned, his great specialities were  Old English literature, Italian poetry, and romances of the Round Table;  and as the first and last of these have increased in value as years have  gone by, it will be seen that the Duke was wise in his generation.  Indeed, we have it on the best authority that the aggregate outlay on  the Roxburghe Library did not exceed L4,000, whilst in the course of  little more than twenty years it produced over L23,397, the sale taking  place in June, 1812. The Duke of Roxburghe and Lord Spencer were not  averse to a little understanding of the nature of a 'knock-out,' for in  one of the Althorp Caxtons Lord Spencer has written: 'The Duke and I had  agreed not to oppose one another at the [George Mason] sale, but after  the book [a Caxton] was bought, to toss up who should win it, when I  lost it. I bought it at the Roxburghe sale on the 17 of June, 1812, for  L215 5s.'    [Illustration: _A corner in the Althorp Library._]    Yet another distinguished book-collector of the same period calls for  notice. George III. formed a splendid library out of his own private  purse and at a cost of L130,000. This library is now a part of the  British Museum. A library such as that of George III. gives very little  idea of a man's real tastes for books. The King availed himself of the  accumulated wisdom, not only of Barnard (who was his librarian for  nearly half a century), but of three or four other experts, among whom  was Dr. Johnson. The King's everyday tastes, however, may be gathered  from the subjoined list of books, which he wished to have on his visit  to Weymouth in 1795. He desired what he called 'a closet library' for a  watering-place; he wrote to his bookseller for the following works: the  Bible; the 'Whole Duty of Man'; the 'Annual Register,' 25 volumes;  Rapin's 'History of England,' 21 volumes, 1757; Millot's 'Elemens de  l'Histoire de France,' 1770; Voltaire's 'Siecles' of Louis XIV. and  Louis XV.; Blackstone's 'Commentaries,' 4 volumes; R. Burn's 'Justice of  Peace and Parish Officer,' 4 volumes; an abridgment of Dr. Johnson's  Dictionary; Boyer's 'Dictionnaire Francois et Anglais'; Johnson's  'Poets,' 68 volumes; Dodsley's 'Poems,' 11 volumes; Nichols' 'Poems,' 8  volumes; Steevens' 'Shakespeare'; 'Oeuvres' of Destouches, 5 volumes;  and the 'Works' of Sir William Temple, 4 volumes; of Addison, 4 volumes,  and Swift, 24 volumes. These books can scarcely be regarded as light  literature, and, if anything, calculated to add to the deadly dulness of  a seaside retreat at the end of the last century. However, the selection  is George III.'s, and must be respected as such.    The number of men who were prowling about London during the middle and  latter part of the last century after books is only less great than the  variety of tastes which they evinced. We have, for example, two such  turbulent spirits as John Horne Tooke and John Wilkes, M.P. Parson  Horne's (he subsequently assumed the name of his patron, William Tooke)  collection did not, as Dibdin has observed, contain a single edition of  the Bible; but it included seven examples of Wynkyn de Worde's press and  many other rare books. Eight hundred and thirteen lots realized the then  high amount of L1,250 when sold at King and Lochee's in 1813. John  Wilkes' books were sold at Sotheby's in 1802. If less notorious, many  equally enthusiastic book-collectors were hunting the highways and  byways of London. Here, for example, is a little anecdote relative to  one of these:    When the splendid folio edition of Caesar's 'Commentaries,' by Clarke,  published for the express purpose of being presented to the great Duke  of Marlborough, came under the hammer at the sale (in 1781) of Topham  Beauclerk's library for L44, it was accompanied by an anecdote relating  to the method in which it had been acquired. Upon the death of an  officer to whom the book belonged, his mother, being informed that it  was of some value, wished to dispose of"]]]
