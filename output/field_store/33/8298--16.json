When the princess gained her room she cried  as if her heart would break. The long day passed slowly, and the night  came, but brought no sleep to Eileen, and in the gray light of the  morning she rose and opened the window, and looked about in every  direction to see if there were any chance of escape. But the window was  ever so high above the ground, and below were the hungry and ever  watchful hounds. With a heavy heart she was about to close the window  when she thought she saw the branches of the tree that was nearest to  it moving. She looked again, and she saw a little white cat creeping  along one of the branches.    \"Mew!\" cried the cat.    \"Poor little pussy,\" said the princess. \"Come to me, pussy.\"    \"Stand back from the window,\" said the cat, \"and I will.\"    The princess stepped back, and the little white cat jumped into the  room. The princess took the little cat on her lap and stroked him with  her hand, and the cat raised up its back and began to purr.    \"Where do you come from, and what is your name?\" asked the princess.    \"No matter where I come from or what's my name,\" said the cat. \"I am a  friend of yours, and I come to help you.\"    \"I never wanted help worse,\" said the princess.    \"I know that,\" said the cat; \"and now listen to me. When the giant comes  back from battle and asks you to marry him, say to him you will marry  him.\"    \"But I will never marry him,\" said the princess.    \"Do what I tell you,\" said the cat. \"When he asks you to marry him, say  to him you will if his dwarfs will wind for you three balls from the  fairy dew that lies on the bushes on a misty morning as big as these,\"  said the cat, putting his right forefoot into his ear and taking out  three balls--one yellow, one red, and one blue.    \"They are very small,\" said the princess. \"They are not much bigger than  peas, and the dwarfs will not be long at their work.\"    \"Won't they,\" said the cat. \"It will take them a month and a day to make  one, so that it will take three months and three days before the balls  are wound; but the giant, like you, will think they can be made in a few  days, and so he will readily promise to do what you ask. He will soon  find out his mistake, but he will keep his word, and will not press you  to marry him until the balls are wound.\"    \"When will the giant come back?\" asked Eileen.    \"He will return to-morrow afternoon,\" said the cat.    \"Will you stay with me until then?\" said the princess. \"I am very  lonely.\"    \"I cannot stay,\" said the cat. \"I have to go away to my palace on the  island on which no man ever placed his foot, and where no man but one  shall ever come.\"    \"And where is that island?\" asked the princess, \"and who is the man?\"    \"The island is in the far-off seas where vessel never sailed; the man  you will see before many days are over; and if all goes well, he will  one day slay the giant Trencoss, and free you from his power.\"    \"Ah!\" sighed the princess, \"that can never be, for no weapon can wound  the hundred hounds that guard the castle, and no sword can kill the  giant Trencoss.\"    \"There is a sword that will kill him,\" said the cat; \"but I must go  now. Remember what you are to say to the giant when he comes home, and  every morning watch the tree on which you saw me, and if you see in the  branches anyone you like better than yourself,\" said the cat, winking  at the princess, \"throw him these three balls and leave the rest to me;  but take care not to speak a single word to him, for if you do all will  be lost.\"    \"Shall I ever see you again?\" asked the princess.    \"Time will tell,\" answered the cat, and, without saying so much as  good-by, he jumped through the window on to the tree, and in a second  was out of sight.    The morrow afternoon came, and the giant Trencoss returned from battle.  Eileen knew of his coming by the furious barking of the hounds, and her  heart sank, for she knew that in a few moments she would be summoned to  his presence. Indeed, he had hardly entered the castle when he sent for  her, and told her to get ready for the wedding. The princess tried to  look cheerful, as she answered:    \"I will be ready as soon as you wish; but you must first promise me  something.\"    \"Ask anything you like, little princess,\" said Trencoss.    \"Well, then,\" said Eileen, \"before I marry you, you must make your  dwarfs wind three balls as big as these from the fairy dew that lies on  the bushes on a misty morning in summer.\"    \"Is that all?\" said Trencoss, laughing. \"I shall give the dwarfs orders  at once, and by this time to-morrow the balls will be wound, and our  wedding can take place in the evening.\"    \"And will you leave me to myself until then?\"    \"I will,\" said Trencoss.    \"On your honor as a giant?\" said Eileen.    \"On my honor as a giant,\" replied Trencoss.    The princess returned to her rooms, and the giant summoned all his  dwarfs, and he ordered them to go forth in the dawning of the morn  and to gather all the fairy dew lying on the bushes, and to wind three  balls--one yellow, one red, and one blue. The next morning, and the  next, and the next, the dwarfs went out into the fields and searched  all the hedgerows, but they could gather only as much fairy dew as would  make a thread as long as a wee girl's eyelash; and so they had to go out  morning after morning, and the giant fumed and threatened, but all to  no purpose. He was very angry with the princess, and he was vexed with  himself that she was so much cleverer than he was, and, moreover, he saw  now that the wedding could not take place as soon as he expected.    When the little white cat went away from the castle he ran as fast as  he could up hill and down dale, and never stopped until he came to the  Prince of the Silver River. The prince was alone, and very sad and  sorrowful he was, for he was thinking of the Princess Eileen, and  wondering where she could be.    \"Mew,\" said the cat, as he sprang softly into the room; but the prince  did not heed him. \"Mew,\" again said the cat; but again the prince did  not heed him. \"Mew,\" said the cat the third time, and he jumped up on  the prince's knee.    \"Where do you come from, and what do you want?\" asked the prince.    \"I come from where you would like to be,\" said the cat.    \"And where is that?\" said the prince.    \"Oh, where is that, indeed! as if I didn't know what you are thinking  of, and of whom you are thinking,\" said the cat; \"and it would be far  better for you to try and save her.\"    \"I would give my life a thousand times over for her,\" said the prince.    \"For whom?\" said the cat, with a wink. \"I named no name, your highness,\"  said he.    \"You know very well who she is,\" said the prince, \"if you knew what I  was thinking of; but do you know where she is?\"    \"She is in danger,\" said the cat. \"She is in the castle of the giant  Trencoss, in the valley beyond the mountains.\"    \"I will set out there at once,\" said the prince, \"and I will challenge  the giant to battle, and will slay him.\"    \"Easier said than done,\" said the cat. \"There is no sword made by the  hands of man can kill him, and even if you could kill him, his hundred  hounds, with tongues of fire and claws of iron, would tear you to  pieces.\"    \"Then, what am I to do?\" asked the prince.    \"Be said by me,\" said the cat. \"Go to the wood that surrounds the  giant's castle, and climb the high tree that's nearest to the window  that looks towards the sunset, and shake the branches, and you will see  what you will see. Then hold out your hat with the silver plumes, and  three balls--one yellow, one red, and one blue--will be thrown into it.  And then come back here as fast as you can; but speak no word, for if  you utter a single word the hounds will hear you, and you shall be torn  to pieces.\"    Well, the prince set off at once, and after two days' journey he came to  the wood around the castle, and he climbed the tree that was nearest to  the window that looked towards the sunset, and he shook the branches.  As soon as he did so, the window opened and he saw the Princess Eileen,  looking lovelier than ever. He was going to call out her name, but she  placed her fingers on her lips, and he remembered what the cat had told  him, that he was to speak no word. In silence he held out the hat with  the silver plumes, and the princess threw into it the three balls, one  after another, and, blowing him a kiss, she shut the window. And well  it was she did so, for at that very moment she heard the voice of the  giant, who was coming back from hunting.    The prince waited until the giant had entered the castle before he  descended the tree. He set off as fast as he could. He went up hill and  down dale, and never stopped until he arrived at his own palace, and  there waiting for him was the little white cat.    \"Have you brought the three balls?\" said he.    \"I have,\" said the prince.    \"Then follow me,\" said the cat.    On they went until they left the palace far behind and came to the edge  of the sea.    \"Now,\" said the cat, \"unravel a thread of the red ball, hold the thread  in your right hand, drop the ball into the water, and you shall see what  you shall see.\"    The prince did as he was told, and the ball floated out to sea,  unraveling as it went, and it went on until it was out of sight.    \"Pull now,\" said the cat.    The prince pulled, and, as he did, he saw far away something on the sea  shining like silver. It came nearer and nearer, and he saw it was a  little silver boat. At last it touched the strand.    \"Now,\" said the cat, \"step into this boat and it will bear you to the  palace on the island on which no man has ever placed his foot--the  island in the unknown seas that were never sailed by vessels made of  human hands. In that palace there is a sword with a diamond hilt, and  by that sword alone the giant Trencoss can be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22169"],[0,"The Story of the Barbary Corsairs (#15)"],[1,"the art of piracy from the  Barbary coast. Dragut (properly Torgh[=u]d) worked measureless  mischief in the Archipelago and Adriatic, seized Venetian galleys and  laid waste the shores of Italy, till he was caught by Giannettino  Doria, nephew of the great admiral, while unsuspectingly engaged in  dividing his spoils on the Sardinian coast (1540). Incensed to find  his vast empire perpetually harassed by foes so lawless and in  numbers so puny, Charles the Emperor resolved to put down the  Corsairs' trade once and for ever. He had subdued Tunis in 1535, but  piracy still went on. Now he would grapple the head and front of the  offence, and conquer Algiers.    He had no fears of the result; the Corsair city would fall at the mere  sight of his immense flotilla; and in this vainglorious assurance he  set out in October, 1541. He even took Spanish ladies on board to view  his triumph. The season for a descent on the African coast was over,  and every one knew that the chance of effecting anything before the  winter storms should guard the coast from any floating enemy was more  than doubtful; but \"the Spaniards commonly move with gravity\"; and  besides, Charles had been delayed during a busy summer by his troubles  in Germany and Flanders, and could not get away before.    Now at last he was free; and, in spite of the earnest remonstrances of  Doria and the entreaties of the Pope, to Algiers he would go.  Everything had long been prepared--a month, he believed, at the  outside would finish the matter--in short, go he would. At Spezzia he  embarked on Doria's flagship; the Duke of Alva, of sanguinary memory,  commanded the troops, many of whom had been brought by the Emperor  himself from the German highlands. Ill-luck attended them from the  outset: a storm, no unusual phenomenon with November coming on, drove  the ships back into shelter at Corsica. At length the seas subsided,  and the fleet, picking up allies as it went along, cautiously hugged  the land as far as Minorca, where the mistral, the terror of seamen,  rushed down upon the huge armada--masts strained, yards cracked, sails  were torn to rags, and there was nothing for it but to row--row for  their lives and for Charles. They were but seven miles from Port  Mahon, yet it took half the night to win there--an endless night which  the panting crews never forgot.    In the bay of Palma, at Majorca, the fleet was assembled. There were  the Emperor's hundred sailing vessels carrying the German and Italian  troops, commanded by such historic names as Colonna and Spinosa; there  were Fernando Gonzago's Sicilian galleys, and a hundred and fifty  transports from Naples and Palermo; there were the fifty galleys of  Bernadino de Mendoza, conveying two hundred transports with the arms  and artillery, and carrying the corps of gentlemen adventurers,  mustered from the chivalry of Spain, and including one only who had  climbed up from the ranks--but that one was Cortes, the conqueror of  Mexico. Over five hundred sail, manned by twelve thousand men, and  carrying a land force of twenty-four thousand soldiers, entered the  roads of Algiers on October 19, 1541.    [Illustration: SIEGE OF ALGIERS, 1541.    (_From a map in the British Museum._)]    At last the great Emperor set eyes upon the metropolis of piracy. On  the rocky promontory which forms the western crest of the crescent  bay, high up the amphitheatre of hills, tier upon tier, in their  narrow overshadowed lanes, the houses of the Corsairs basked in the  autumn sun, crowned by the fortress which had known the imperious  rule of two Barbarossas. On the right was the mole which Spanish  slaves had built out of the ruins of the Spanish fort. Two gates  fronted the south and north, the Bab Az[=u]n and Bab-el-W[=e]d.    Avoiding the promontory of Cashina, the galleys, with furled sails,  drew up before the low strand, backed by stretches of luxuriant  verdure, south of the city, and out of range, at the spot which is  still called the \"Jardin d'essai.\" A heavy swell prevented their  landing for three days, but on the 23rd, in beautiful weather, the  troops disembarked. The Berbers and Arabs, who had lined the shore and  defied the invaders, hastily retired before the guns of the galleys,  and the Spaniards landed unopposed. The next day they began the march  to the city some few miles off. The Spaniards formed the left wing on  the hill side; the Emperor and the Duke of Alva with the German troops  composed the centre; the Italians and one hundred and fifty knights of  Malta marched on the right by the seashore. Driving back the  straggling bands of mounted Arabs, who ambushed among the rocks and  ravines, and picked off many of the Christians, the invaders pushed  steadily on, till Algiers was invested on all sides save the north.  Its fate appeared sealed. A brief bombardment from Charles's heavy  cannon, and the Spaniards would rush the breach and storm the citadel.  Hasan Aga, within, with only eight hundred Turks, and perhaps five  thousand Arabs and Moors, must almost have regretted the proud reply  he had just made to the Emperor's summons to surrender.    Then, when the end seemed close at hand, the forces of Nature came to  the rescue. The stars in their courses fought for Algiers: the rains  descended and the winds blew and beat upon that army, till the  wretched soldiers, with neither tents nor cloaks, with barely  food--for the landing of the stores had hardly begun--standing all  night knee-deep in slush in that pinguid soil, soaked to the skin,  frozen by the driving rain and bitter wind, were ready to drop with  exhaustion and misery. When morning dawned they could scarcely bear up  against the blustering gale; their powder was wet; and a sudden sally  of the Turks spread a panic in the sodden ranks which needed all the  courage and coolness of the Knights of Malta to compose. At last the  enemy was driven out of the trenches and pursued, skirmishing all the  way, to the Bab Az[=u]n. It looked as though pursuers and pursued  would enter together; but the gate was instantly shut, and a daring  Knight of Malta had barely struck his dagger in the gate to defy the  garrison, when the Christians found themselves under so heavy a fire  from the battlements, that they were forced to beat a retreat: the  Knights of Malta, last of all, their scarlet doublets shining like a  fresh wound, and their faces to the foe, covered the retreat.    Hasan then led out his best horsemen from the gate, and driving their  heels into their horses' flanks, the cloud of Moslems poured down the  hill. The Knights of Malta bore the shock with their iron firmness,  though they lost heavily. The Italians ran for their lives. The  Germans whom Charles hurriedly despatched to the rescue came back at  the double without drawing a sword. The Emperor himself put on his  armour, spurred his charger into the midst of the fugitives, sword in  hand, and with vehement reproaches succeeded in shaming them into  fight. \"Come, gentlemen,\" then said he to the nobles around,  \"forwards!\" And thus he led his dispirited troops once more to the  field; this time the panic alarm of the rank and file was controlled  and banished by the cool courage of the cavaliers, and the Turks were  driven back into the town. The skirmish had cost him three hundred men  and a dozen Knights of Malta. All that day the Emperor and his  officers, great signiors all, stood at arms in the pouring rain, with  the water oozing from their boots, vigilantly alert.    Had Charles now run his ships ashore at all hazard, and dragged up his  heavy siege train and stores and tents and ammunition, all might yet  have been won. But several precious days were wasted, and on the  morning of the 25th such a storm sprang up as mortal mariner rarely  encountered even off such a coast--a violent north-easterly  hurricane--still known in Algiers as \"Charles's gale\"--such as few  vessels cared to ride off a lee shore. The immense flotilla in the bay  was within an ace of total destruction. Anchors and cables were  powerless to hold the crowded, jostling ships. One after the other  they broke loose, and keeled over to the tempest till their decks were  drowned in the seas. Planks gaped; broadside to broadside the helpless  hulks crashed together. Many of the crews threw themselves madly on  shore. In six hours one hundred and fifty ships sank. The rowers of  the galleys, worn out with toiling at the oar, at last succumbed, and  fifteen of the vessels ran on shore, only to be received by the  Berbers of the hills, who ran their spears through the miserable  shipwrecked sailors as soon as they gained the land.    The worst day must come to an end: on the morrow the storm was over,  and Doria, who had succeeded in taking the greater part of the fleet  out to sea, came back to see what new folly was in hand. He was  indignant with the Emperor for having rejected his advice and so led  the fleet and army into such peril; he was disgusted with his  captains, who had completely lost their coolness in the hurricane, and  wanted to run their vessels ashore, with the certainty of wreck,  sooner than ride out the storm--and yet called themselves sailors!    He found Charles fully aware of the necessity for a temporary retreat,  till the army should be revictualled and reclothed. The camp was  struck: the Emperor himself watched the operation, standing at the  door of his tent in a long white cassock, murmuring quietly the  Christian's consolation: \"Thy will be done\"--_Fiat voluntas Tua!_  Baggage and ordnance were abandoned; the horses of the field artillery  were devoured by the hungry troops; and then the march began.    To retreat at all is humiliation, but to retreat as this luckless army  did was agony. Deep mud clogged their weary feet; when a halt was  called they could but rest on their halberts, to lie down was to be  suffocated in filth; mountain torrents swollen breast-high had to"]]]
