No amount of courage and devotion in troops can make up for  an inadequate supply of artillery, machine guns, shells, and shrapnel,  or for the lack of ample means of rapid transportation. Only in a  rough country without good roads, like the United States in 1861-65,  or Serbia or Russia now, can the rifle, light artillery, and horse or  ox wagons win any considerable success; and in such a country the  trench method can bring about a stalemate, if the combatants are well  matched in strength, diligence, and courage.    The changes in naval warfare are almost equally remarkable. Mines and  submarines can make the offensive operation of dreadnoughts and  cruisers near ports practically impossible, and can inflict great  damage on an enemy's commerce. Hence important modifications in the  rules concerning effective blockade. In squadron actions victory will  probably go to the side which has the gun of longest range  well-manned. Defeated war vessels sink as a rule with almost all on  board. Commercial vessels can seldom be taken into port as prizes, and  must therefore be sunk to make their capture effective. There have  been no actions between large fleets; but the indications are that a  defeated fleet would be sunk for the most part, the only vessels to  escape being some of the speedier sort. Crews would go down with their  vessels. Shore batteries of long-range guns can keep at a distance a  considerable fleet, and can sink vessels that come too near. Mines and  shore batteries together can prevent the passage of war vessels  through straits ten to fifteen miles wide, no matter how powerful the  vessel's batteries may be. Every war vessel is now filled with  machinery of various sorts, much of which is delicate or easily  disabled. Hence a single shell exploding violently in a sensitive spot  may render a large ship unmanageable, and therefore an easy victim. A  crippled ship will probably be sunk, unless a port is near.    To build and keep in perfect condition a modern fleet requires  dockyards and machine shops of large capacity, and great metallurgical  industries always in operation within the country which maintains the  fleet. No small nation can create a powerful fleet; and no nation  which lives chiefly by agriculture can maintain one. A great naval  power must be a mining, manufacturing, and commercial power, with a  sound banking system available all over the world.    The war has proved that it is possible for a combination of strong  naval powers to sweep off the ocean in a few months all the warships  of any single great power, except submarines, and all its commerce.  Germany has already suffered that fate, and incidentally the loss of  all her colonies, except portions of German East Africa and Kamerun,  both of which remnants are vigorously assailed and will soon be lost.  Nevertheless, she still exports and imports through neutral countries,  though to a small amount in comparison with the volume of her normal  trade. Here is another illustration of the general truth that colonies  are never so good to trade with as independent and prosperous nations.    Again the war has proved that it is not possible in a normal year to  reduce by blockade or non-intercourse the food supply of a large  nation to the point of starvation, or even of great distress, although  the nation has been in the habit of importing a considerable fraction  of its food supply. An intelligent population will make many economies  in its food, abstain from superfluities, raise more food from its  soil, use grains for food instead of drinks, and buy food from neutral  countries so long as its hard money holds out. Any large country which  has a long seaboard or neutral neighbors can probably prevent its  noncombatant population from suffering severely from want of food or  clothing while at war. This would not be true of the districts in  which actual fighting takes place or over which armies pass; for in  the regions of actual battle modern warfare is terribly  destructive--as Belgium, Northern France, Poland, and Serbia know.    A manufacturing people whose commercial vessels are driven off the  seas will, of course, suffer the loss of such raw materials of its  industries as habitually came to it over seas in its own bottoms--a  loss mitigated, however, by the receipt of some raw materials from or  through neutral countries. This abridgment of its productive  industries will, in the long run, greatly diminish its powers of  resistance in war; but much time may be needed for the full  development of this serious disability.    Because of the great costliness of the artillery, munitions of war,  and means of transportation used in the present war, the borrowings of  all the combatant nations are heavy beyond any precedent; so that  already all the nations involved have been compelled to raise the  rates of interest on the immense loans they have put upon the market.  The burdens thus being prepared for the coming generations in the  belligerent nations will involve very high rates of taxation in all  the countries now at war. If these burdens continue to accumulate for  two or three years more, no financier, however experienced and  far-seeing, can imagine today how the resulting loans are to be paid  or how the burden of taxation necessary to pay the interest on them  can be borne or how the indemnities probably to be exacted can be paid  within any reasonable period by the defeated nation or nations.    It follows from these established facts that a small nation--a nation  of not more than fifteen millions, for example--can have no  independent existence in Europe except as a member of a federation of  States having similar habits, tendencies, and hopes, and united in an  offensive and defensive alliance, or under guarantees given by a group  of strong and trustworthy nations. The firm establishment of several  such federations, or the giving of such guarantees by a group of  powerful and faith-keeping nations ought to be one of the outcomes of  the war of 1914-15. Unless some such arrangement is reached, no small  State will be safe from conquest and absorption by any strong,  aggressive military power which covets it--not even if its people live  chiefly by mining and manufacturing as the Belgians did.    The small States, being very determined to exist and to obtain their  natural or historical racial boundaries, the problem of permanent or  any durable peace in Europe resolves itself into this: How can the  small or smaller nations be protected from attack by some larger  nation which believes that might makes right and is mighty in  industries, commerce, finance, and the military and naval arts? The  experience gained during the past year proves that there is but one  effective protection against such a power, namely, a firm league of  other powers--not necessarily numerous--which together are stronger in  industries, commerce, finance, and the military and naval arts than  the aggressive and ambitious nation which heartily believes in its own  invincibility and cherishes the ambition to conquer and possess.    Such a league is the present combination of Great Britain, France,  Russia, Italy, and Japan against the aggressive Central Monarchies and  Turkey; but this combination was not formed deliberately and with  conscious purpose to protect small States, to satisfy natural  national aspirations, and to make durable peace possible by removing  both fear of invasion and fear of the cutting off of overseas food and  raw materials. In spite of the lack of an explicit and comprehensive  purpose to attain these wise and precious ends, the solidity of the  alliance during a year of stupendous efforts to resist military  aggression on the part of Germany and Austria-Hungary certainly  affords good promise of success for a somewhat larger league in which  all the European nations--some, like the Scandinavian and the Balkans,  by representation in groups--and the United States should be included.  Such a league would have to act through a distinct and permanent  council or commission which would not serve arbitrary power, or any  peculiar national interest, and would not in the least resemble the  \"Concert of Europe,\" or any of the disastrous special conferences of  diplomatists and Ministers for Foreign Affairs, called after wars  since that of 1870-71 to \"settle\" the questions the wars raised.    The experience of the past twelve months proves that such a league  could prevent any nation which disobeyed its orders from making use of  the oceans and from occupying the territory of any other nation.  Reduction of armaments, diminution of taxation, and durable peace  would ensue as soon as general confidence was established that the  league would fairly administer international justice, and that its  military and naval forces were ready and effective. Its function would  be limited to the prevention and punishment of violation of  international agreements, or, in other words, to the enforcement of  treaty obligations, until new treaties were made.    The present alliance is of good promise in three important  respects--its members refuse to make any separate peace, they  co-operate cordially and efficiently in military measures, and the  richer members help the poorer financially. These policies have been  hastily devised and adopted in the midst of strenuous fighting on an  immense scale. If deliberately planned and perfected in times of  peace, they could be made in the highest degree effective toward  durable peace.    The war has demonstrated that the international agreements for the  mitigation of the horrors of war, made by treaties, conferences, and  conventions in times of peace, may go for nothing in time of war;  because they have no sanction, or, in other words, lack penalties  capable of systematic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22483"],[0,"Across Unknown South America (#15)"],[1,"had not disturbed his efforts. He  had taken no notice whatever of us. Dinner was prepared--it took a long  time--the musician all the time delighting his admiring family with the  two monotonous chords.    \"It is a pity,\" said his delighted mother to me, \"that we cannot send him  to school. He is a genius; he would astonish the world.\"    \"Yes,\" I hastily agreed, \"it _is_ a pity you cannot send him ...  somewhere!\"    \"Can you not take him with you?\"    I explained to the poor woman that it required very civilized people to  appreciate her son's music. Among the wild Indians I expected to find,  later on in my journey, I was sure that with music like that, we should  all be killed; they were such savages!    After two solid hours--and the two chords still continuing, with no signs  whatever of relenting--I asked the musical genius if he could treat me to  a different tune. Alas! he knew no other, but as he saw that I was so  fond of music he would again, with the greatest pleasure, go on playing  the same air--he called it an air.    \"_Muito obrigado!_ (Thank you very much!)\" I moaned, with a sickly smile  on my lips and a violent internal wish to smash guitar and guitarist.    \"_No hai de que!_ (Do not mention it!)\" and here recommenced the  repetition of the two chords.    \"I should like to go to sleep now; thank you very much again for the  lovely music,\" I next plaintively added, in my most approved Brazilian  politeness.    \"Oh, not at all: I shall go on playing while you are sleeping. It will  give you pleasant dreams!\"    It was too pathetic. Nothing short of murder could have stopped his  enthusiasm. Being a traveller of years' experience, I was not to be  outwitted. As he would not stop the music, I stopped hearing it by  stuffing my ears tight with cotton-wool. So I slept soundly enough,  notwithstanding the orchestral entertainment. At sunrise, when I opened  my eyes again, the boy was still at it. I removed the cotton from my ears  ... yes, indeed, the identical two chords!    The boy and the guitar will perhaps never know what a narrow escape they  both had! In despair I gave orders to get the mules ready at once in  order to depart immediately.    Those halts in farmhouses were dreary beyond words. The Brazilians of the  interior--quite unlike those of the big towns in or near the coast--were  sullen people, with no conversation--or else too much--no interest in  anything, no art, no imagination. They were timid and vain to an  incredible degree, suspicious, avaricious, and easily offended, so that  the greatest tact had to be used with them. They were ignorant of  everything even in their own immediate neighbourhood. Yet, mind you, with  all that, extraordinarily kind and ultra-polite of speech. They all  seemed turned out of the same mould. When you had seen one you had seen  them all. There were, of course, a few exceptions--Brazilians of recent  German, French, Italian or Spanish origin--but these exceptions were  indeed very rare in the interior.    Ill-fed, his blood corrupted and impoverished to the utmost degree--his  health, therefore, never in a normal condition--his finances at the  lowest ebb, the Brazilian of the interior had little indeed to make him  happy. His home at best was as miserable and dirty as possible. The room  generally given to an honoured guest--the best in the house--was the  granary. More than once was my camp-bed perched on a mound of Indian  corn. And the furniture? A wooden bench of the roughest  description--really an instrument of torture rather than an article of  comfort; a few wooden pegs in the wall for hanging rifles or other  things; an occasional wooden bedstead; seldom, very seldom, a stool or a  chair--in any case, never a comfortable one such as you invariably find  with peasants and old-established colonists of most other countries. They  cared not for comfort. Their beds, a mass of rags, were shared by masters  and hens and dogs. Everything was in an abandoned state, everything had  fallen to rack and ruin. All looked as if they were tired of life, too  indolent to move. They seldom saluted when you met them on the trail, nor  when you entered their houses; if they did, they rapidly touched their  dilapidated hats as if afraid to spoil them. Never did you perceive a  smile upon their long-drawn countenances. When they greeted one another  they laid their bodies close together as if about to dance the _tango_,  and patted each other repeatedly on the shoulder-blades, turning their  heads away as if to avoid their reciprocal evil odour. It is not the  fashion in any part of Brazil to shake hands. Some say it is because of  the unpleasant feeling of touching sweating hands; others suggest that it  is to prevent the contagion of the many skin complaints from which  people suffer. When they do shake hands--with a stranger, for  instance--one might as well be grasping the very dead hand of a very dead  man; it is done in so heartless a manner.    For a consideration they reluctantly gave a stranger what little they  possessed, but they had not the remotest idea of the value of things. In  one farmhouse you were charged the equivalent of a few pence for an egg  or a chicken; in the next farm a small fortune was demanded for similar  articles of convenience. Men, women, children, dogs, pigs and fowls, all  lived--not happily, but most unhappily--together.    No sooner were we able to saddle the animals and pack the baggage and pay  our hostess, than we tried to make our escape from that musical farm. But  luck was hard on me that day. One mule was lost, a second received a  terrible gash in his hind quarters from a powerful kick from another  mule.    We went on among low, fairly grassy hills to the west, W.N.W. and to the  east of us. We still had before us the Serra de Callos--a flat-topped  tableland some 12 kil. in diameter on the summit, where it was almost  circular. Its deeply grooved sides showed clearly the great work of  erosion which had occurred and was still taking place in those regions.  With the exception of two spurs, which projected on the west and east  sides of the plateau, its sky-line was quite clean and flat.    After rising to an elevation of 2,600 ft., then descending to 2,450 ft.,  we crossed two streamlets which afterwards joined a fairly important  torrent. One was called the Rio Boa Vista. We gradually then rose to  2,750 ft. on another flat tableland to the east of the Serra de Callos,  with its sides eroded in two distinct terraces, the higher one being  almost a straight wall from two-thirds up the side of the range. In the  lower portion a number of rounded mounds were to be observed, which, with  a stretch of the imagination and for the sake of comparison, resembled,  perhaps, elephants' heads.    North-east of the Serra stood a thickly-wooded, detached mound, while to  the north as we went along there was displayed before us a magnificent  view of the flat valley into which we were about to descend.    Where the country was wooded many trees and plants were to be found,  useful for their tanning, medicinal, oliferous or lactiferous qualities:  such as the Dedal, a yellowish-leafed shrub from which a yellow dye can  be obtained; the tall thin Arariba Amarelho, or Amarelhino (_Centrolobium  robustum_), a great number of Lobelia trees, with their elongated light  green leaves and clean barked stems, which eject, from incisions, a  caustic and poisonous juice. The tallest of all the trees in that region  was perhaps the Jacaranda, with its tiny leaves.... There were four kinds  of Jacaranda--the Jacaranda _cabiuna_, _rosa_, _tan_ and _violeta_,  technically known as _Dalbergia nigra_, _Machaerium incorruptibile_,  _Machaerium cencopterum_, _Machaerium Alemanni_, Benth. The three latter  have a specific gravity higher than that of most woods in Brazil, except  the Pao de ferro (_Caesalpina ferrea_), the very plentiful Barbatimao  (_Stryphnodendron barbatimao_), a mimosa-like tree, and the Vinhatico  amarello (_Echyrosperum Balthazarii_), the last of which has the highest  specific gravity of all.    Then we found plenty of Sambaiba, an excellent wood, and Imuliana, a wood  of great resistance, much used in certain parts of Brazil for  constructing fences.    A peculiar tree with concave leaves shaped like a cup was locally called  Ariticun or Articun. It produced a large fruit, quite good to eat.    Much botanical variety was indeed everywhere around us.... There was the  _terra da folha miuta_, which, as its name tells, possessed minute shiny  leaves; then the tall Faveiro (_Pterodon pubescens_), producing a bean,  and having dark leaves not unlike those of mimosas. Then, many were the  kinds of acacias we noticed as we went along.    [Illustration: Picturesque Ox-carts of Goyaz.]    Still descending, we arrived at the little town of Caldas de Goyaz--so  called because there were three hot springs of water of different  temperatures. I visited the three springs. The water tasted slightly of  iron, was beautifully clear and quite good to drink. Two springs were  found in a depression some 150 ft. lower than the village--viz., at an  elevation of 2,450 ft., whereas the village itself was at 2,600 ft. These  two springs were only 20 ft. away from a stream of cold water. A short  distance from the cold stream was another stream of hot water emerging  from the rocks.    Small rectangular tanks had been made at the two higher springs, which  were said to possess wonderful curing qualities for eczema and other  cutaneous troubles; also for rheumatism and blood complaints of all  kinds. Whether those waters were really beneficial or not, it was not  possible to ascertain on a passing visit. I drank some of the water and  it did me no harm, so if it does no good neither is it injurious.    The village of Caldas showed signs of having seen better days. It was  clean-looking, but like all other villages of Goyaz it was dreary "]]]
