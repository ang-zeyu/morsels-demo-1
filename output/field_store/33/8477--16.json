[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2850"],[0,"The Wars of the Jews; Or, The History of the Destruction of Jerusalem (#15)"],[1,"battle, and the  entire Roman cohorts were destroyed; for these cohorts were new-raised  men, gathered out of Syria, and here was no mixture of those called  veteran soldiers among them, who might have supported those that were  unskillful in war.    2. This victory was not sufficient for Antigonus; but he proceeded to  that degree of rage, as to treat the dead body of Joseph barbarously;  for when he had got possession of the bodies of those that were slain,  he cut off his head, although his brother Pheroras would have given  fifty talents as a price of redemption for it. And now the affairs of  Galilee were put in such disorder after this victory of Antigonus's,  that those of Antigonus's party brought the principal men that were  on Herod's side to the lake, and there drowned them. There was a great  change made also in Idumea, where Machaerus was building a wall about  one of the fortresses, which was called Gittha. But Herod had not yet  been informed of these things; for after the taking of Samosata, and  when Antony had set Sosius over the affairs of Syria, and had given him  orders to assist Herod against Antigonus, he departed into Egypt; but  Sosius sent two legions before him into Judea to assist Herod, and  followed himself soon after with the rest of his army.    3. Now when Herod was at Daphne, by Antioch, he had some dreams which  clearly foreboded his brother's death; and as he leaped out of his bed  in a disturbed manner, there came messengers that acquainted him with  that calamity. So when he had lamented this misfortune for a while, he  put off the main part of his mourning, and made haste to march against  his enemies; and when he had performed a march that was above his  strength, and was gone as far as Libanus, he got him eight hundred men  of those that lived near to that mountain as his assistants, and joined  with them one Roman legion, with which, before it was day, he made an  irruption into Galilee, and met his enemies, and drove them back to  the place which they had left. He also made an immediate and continual  attack upon the fortress. Yet was he forced by a most terrible storm to  pitch his camp in the neighboring villages before he could take it. But  when, after a few days' time, the second legion, that came from Antony,  joined themselves to him, the enemy were affrighted at his power, and  left their fortifications in the night time.    4. After this he marched through Jericho, as making what haste he  could to be avenged on his brother's murderers; where happened to him  a providential sign, out of which, when he had unexpectedly escaped,  he had the reputation of being very dear to God; for that evening there  feasted with him many of the principal men; and after that feast was  over, and all the guests were gone out, the house fell down immediately.  And as he judged this to be a common signal of what dangers he should  undergo, and how he should escape them in the war that he was going  about, he, in the morning, set forward with his army, when about six  thousand of his enemies came running down from the mountains, and began  to fight with those in his forefront; yet durst they not be so very bold  as to engage the Romans hand to hand, but threw stones and darts at them  at a distance; by which means they wounded a considerable number; in  which action Herod's own side was wounded with a dart.    5. Now as Antigonus had a mind to appear to exceed Herod, not only in  the courage, but in the number of his men, he sent Pappus, one of his  companions, with an army against Samaria, whose fortune it was to oppose  Machaerus; but Herod overran the enemy's country, and demolished five  little cities, and destroyed two thousand men that were in them,  and burned their houses, and then returned to his camp; but his  head-quarters were at the village called Cana.    6. Now a great multitude of Jews resorted to him every day, both out of  Jericho and the other parts of the country. Some were moved so to do  out of their hatred to Antigonus, and some out of regard to the glorious  actions Herod had done; but others were led on by an unreasonable desire  of change; so he fell upon them immediately. As for Pappus and his  party, they were not terrified either at their number or at their zeal,  but marched out with great alacrity to fight them; and it came to a  close fight. Now other parts of their army made resistance for a while;  but Herod, running the utmost hazard, out of the rage he was in at the  murder of his brother, that he might be avenged on those that had been  the authors of it, soon beat those that opposed him; and after he had  beaten them, he always turned his force against those that stood to it  still, and pursued them all; so that a great slaughter was made, while  some were forced back into that village whence they came out; he also  pressed hard upon the hindermost, and slew a vast number of them; he  also fell into the village with the enemy, where every house was filled  with armed men, and the upper rooms were crowded above with soldiers for  their defense; and when he had beaten those that were on the outside,  he pulled the houses to pieces, and plucked out those that were within;  upon many he had the roofs shaken down, whereby they perished by heaps;  and as for those that fled out of the ruins, the soldiers received them  with their swords in their hands; and the multitude of those slain and  lying on heaps was so great, that the conquerors could not pass along  the roads. Now the enemy could not bear this blow, so that when the  multitude of them which was gathered together saw that those in the  village were slain, they dispersed themselves, and fled away; upon the  confidence of which victory, Herod had marched immediately to Jerusalem,  unless he tad been hindered by the depth of winter's [coming on]. This  was the impediment that lay in the way of this his entire glorious  progress, and was what hindered Antigonus from being now conquered, who  was already disposed to forsake the city.    7. Now when at the evening Herod had already dismissed his friends to  refresh themselves after their fatigue, and when he was gone himself,  while he was still hot in his armor, like a common soldier, to bathe  himself, and had but one servant that attended him, and before he was  gotten into the bath, one of the enemies met him in the face with a  sword in his hand, and then a second, and then a third, and after that  more of them; these were men who had run away out of the battle into  the bath in their armor, and they had lain there for some time in, great  terror, and in privacy; and when they saw the king, they trembled for  fear, and ran by him in a flight, although he was naked, and endeavored  to get off into the public road. Now there was by chance nobody else at  hand that might seize upon these men; and for Herod, he was contented to  have come to no harm himself, so that they all got away in safety.    8. But on the next day Herod had Pappus's head cut off, who was the  general for Antigonus, and was slain in the battle, and sent it to his  brother Pheroras, by way of punishment for their slain brother; for he  was the man that slew Joseph. Now as winter was going off, Herod marched  to Jerusalem, and brought his army to the wall of it; this was the third  year since he had been made king at Rome; so he pitched his camp before  the temple, for on that side it might be besieged, and there it was  that Pompey took the city. So he parted the work among the army, and  demolished the suburbs, end raised three banks, and gave orders to  have towers built upon those banks, and left the most laborious of his  acquaintance at the works. But he went himself to Samaria, to take the  daughter of Alexander, the son of Aristobulus, to wife, who had  been betrothed to him before, as we have already said; and thus he  accomplished this by the by, during the siege of the city, for he had  his enemies in great contempt already.    9. When he had thus married Mariamne, he came back to Jerusalem with a  greater army. Sosius also joined him with a large army, both of horsemen  and footmen, which he sent before him through the midland parts, while  he marched himself along Phoenicia; and when the whole army was gotten  together, which were eleven regiments of footmen, and six thousand  horsemen, besides the Syrian auxiliaries, which were no small part  of the army, they pitched their camp near to the north wall. Herod's  dependence was upon the decree of the senate, by which he was made king;  and Sosius relied upon Antony, who sent the army that was under him to  Herod's assistance.              CHAPTER 18.           How Herod And Sosius Took Jerusalem By Force; And What Death       Antigonus Came To. Also Concerning Cleopatra's Avaricious       Temper.    1. Now the multitude of the Jews that were in the city were divided into  several factions; for the people that crowded about the temple, being  the weaker part of them, gave it out that, as the times were, he was the  happiest and most religious man who should die first. But as to the  more bold and hardy men, they got together in bodies, and fell a robbing  others after various manners, and these particularly plundered the  places that were about the city, and this because there was no food left  either for the horses or the men; yet some of the warlike men, who were  used to fight regularly, were appointed to defend the city during the  siege, and these drove those that raised the banks away from the  wall; and these were always inventing some engine or another to be a  hinderance to the engines of the enemy; nor had they so much success any  way as in the mines under ground.    2. Now as for the robberies which were committed, the king contrived  that ambushes should be so laid, that they might restrain their  excursions; and as for the want of provisions, he provided that they  should be brought to them from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2853"],[0,"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero (#15)"],[1,"had never seen them before; then he raised his two  hands, which were like cushions, and said in a hoarse voice,--\"The ring  of a knight has fallen from my finger, and it was inherited from my  father.\"    \"Who was a tailor,\" added Nero.    But Vitelius burst forth again in unexpected laughter, and began to  search for his ring in the peplus of Calvia Crispinilla.    Hereupon Vestinius fell to imitating the cries of a frightened woman.  Nigidia, a friend of Calvia,--a young widow with the face of a child  and the eyes of a wanton,--said aloud,--\"He is seeking what he has not  lost.\"    \"And which will be useless to him if he finds it,\" finished the poet  Lucan.    The feast grew more animated. Crowds of slaves bore around successive  courses; from great vases filled with snow and garlanded with  ivy, smaller vessels with various kinds of wine were brought forth  unceasingly. All drank freely. On the guests, roses fell from the  ceiling at intervals.    Petronius entreated Nero to dignify the feast with his song before the  guests drank too deeply. A chorus of voices supported his words, but  Nero refused at first. It was not a question of courage alone, he said,  though that failed him always. The gods knew what efforts every success  cost him. He did not avoid them, however, for it was needful to do  something for art; and besides, if Apollo had gifted him with a certain  voice, it was not proper to let divine gifts be wasted. He understood,  even, that it was his duty to the State not to let them be wasted. But  that day he was really hoarse. In the night he had placed leaden weights  on his chest, but that had not helped in any way. He was thinking even  to go to Antium, to breathe the sea air.    Lucan implored him in the name of art and humanity. All knew that the  divine poet and singer had composed a new hymn to Venus, compared with  which Lucretius's hymn was as the howl of a yearling wolf. Let that  feast be a genuine feast. So kind a ruler should not cause such tortures  to his subjects. \"Be not cruel, O Caesar!\"    \"Be not cruel!\" repeated all who were sitting near.    Nero spread his hands in sign that he had to yield. All faces assumed  then an expression of gratitude, and all eyes were turned to him; but he  gave command first to announce to Poppaea that he would sing; he informed  those present that she had not come to the feast, because she did not  feel in good health; but since no medicine gave her such relief as his  singing, he would be sorry to deprive her of this opportunity.    In fact, Poppaea came soon. Hitherto she had ruled Nero as if he had  been her subject, but she knew that when his vanity as a singer, a  charioteer, or a poet was involved, there was danger in provoking it.  She came in therefore, beautiful as a divinity, arrayed, like Nero,  in robes of amethyst color, and wearing a necklace of immense pearls,  stolen on a time from Massinissa; she was golden-haired, sweet, and  though divorced from two husbands she had the face and the look of a  virgin.    She was greeted with shouts, and the appellation \"Divine Augusta.\" Lygia  had never seen any one so beautiful, and she could not believe her own  eyes, for she knew that Poppaea Sabina was one of the vilest women on  earth. She knew from Pomponia that she had brought Caesar to murder his  mother and his wife; she knew her from accounts given by Aulus's guests  and the servants; she had heard that statues to her had been thrown  down at night in the city; she had heard of inscriptions, the writers  of which had been condemned to severest punishment, but which still  appeared on the city walls every morning. Yet at sight of the notorious  Poppaea, considered by the confessors of Christ as crime and evil  incarnate, it seemed to her that angels or spirits of heaven might look  like her. She was unable simply to take her eyes from Poppaea; and from  her lips was wrested involuntarily the question,--\"Ah, Marcus, can it be  possible?\"    But he, roused by wine, and as it were impatient that so many things  had scattered her attention, and taken her from him and his words,  said,--\"Yes, she is beautiful, but thou art a hundred times more  beautiful. Thou dost not know thyself, or thou wouldst be in love with  thyself, as Narcissus was; she bathes in asses' milk, but Venus bathed  thee in her own milk. Thou dost not know thyself, Ocelle mi! Look not at  her. Turn thy eyes to me, Ocelle mi! Touch this goblet of wine with thy  lips, and I will put mine on the same place.\"    And he pushed up nearer and nearer, and she began to withdraw toward  Acte. But at that moment silence was enjoined because Caesar had risen.  The singer Diodorus had given him a lute of the kind called delta;  another singer named Terpnos, who had to accompany him in playing,  approached with an instrument called the nablium. Nero, resting the  delta on the table, raised his eyes; and for a moment silence reigned in  the triclinium, broken only by a rustle, as roses fell from the ceiling.    Then he began to chant, or rather to declaim, singingly and  rhythmically, to the accompaniment of the two lutes, his own hymn to  Venus. Neither the voice, though somewhat injured, nor the verses were  bad, so that reproaches of conscience took possession of Lygia again;  for the hymn, though glorifying the impure pagan Venus, seemed to her  more than beautiful, and Caesar himself, with a laurel crown on his head  and uplifted eyes, nobler, much less terrible, and less repulsive than  at the beginning of the feast.    The guests answered with a thunder of applause. Cries of, \"Oh, heavenly  voice!\" were heard round about; some of the women raised their hands,  and held them thus, as a sign of delight, even after the end of the  hymn; others wiped their tearful eyes; the whole hall was seething as in  a beehive. Poppaea, bending her golden-haired head, raised Nero's hand  to her lips, and held it long in silence. Pythagoras, a young Greek  of marvellous beauty,--the same to whom later the half-insane Nero  commanded the flamens to marry him, with the observance of all  rites,--knelt now at his feet.    But Nero looked carefully at Petronius, whose praises were desired by  him always before every other, and who said,--\"If it is a question of  music, Orpheus must at this moment be as yellow from envy as Lucan,  who is here present; and as to the verses, I am sorry that they are not  worse; if they were I might find proper words to praise them.\"    Lucan did not take the mention of envy evil of him; on the contrary, he  looked at Petronius with gratitude, and, affecting ill-humor, began to  murmur,--\"Cursed fate, which commanded me to live contemporary with such  a poet. One might have a place in the memory of man, and on Parnassus;  but now one will quench, as a candle in sunlight.\"    Petronius, who had an amazing memory, began to repeat extracts from  the hymn and cite single verses, exalt, and analyze the more beautiful  expressions. Lucan, forgetting as it were his envy before the charm of  the poetry, joined his ecstasy to Petronius's words. On Nero's face were  reflected delight and fathomless vanity, not only nearing stupidity, but  reaching it perfectly. He indicated to them verses which he considered  the most beautiful; and finally he began to comfort Lucan, and tell him  not to lose heart, for though whatever a man is born that he is,  the honor which people give Jove does not exclude respect for other  divinities.    Then he rose to conduct Poppaea, who, being really in ill health, wished  to withdraw. But he commanded the guests who remained to occupy their  places anew, and promised to return, In fact, he returned a little  later, to stupefy himself with the smoke of incense, and gaze at further  spectacles which he himself, Petronius, or Tigellinus had prepared for  the feast.    Again verses were read or dialogues listened to in which extravagance  took the place of wit. After that Paris, the celebrated mime,  represented the adventures of Io, the daughter of Inachus. To the  guests, and especially to Lygia, unaccustomed to such scenes, it seemed  that they were gazing at miracles and enchantment. Paris, with motions  of his hands and body, was able to express things apparently impossible  in a dance. His hands dimmed the air, creating a cloud, bright, living,  quivering, voluptuous, surrounding the half-fainting form of a maiden  shaken by a spasm of delight. That was a picture, not a dance; an  expressive picture, disclosing the secrets of love, bewitching and  shameless; and when at the end of it Corybantes rushed in and began  a bacchic dance with girls of Syria to the sounds of cithara, lutes,  drums, and cymbals,--a dance filled with wild shouts and still wilder  license,--it seemed to Lygia that living fire was burning her, and that  a thunderbolt ought to strike that house, or the ceiling fall on the  heads of those feasting there.    But from the golden net fastened to the ceiling only roses fell, and  the now half-drunken Vinicius said to her,--\"I saw thee in the house of  Aulus, at the fountain. It was daylight, and thou didst think that  no one saw thee; but I saw thee. And I see thee thus yet, though that  peplus hides thee. Cast aside the peplus, like Crispinilla. See, gods  and men seek love. There is nothing in the world but love. Lay thy head  on my breast and close thy eyes.\"    The pulse beat oppressively in Lygia's hands and temples. A feeling  seized her that she was flying into some abyss, and that Vinicius, who  before had seemed so near and so trustworthy, instead of saving was  drawing her toward it. And she felt sorry for him. She began again to  dread the feast and him and herself. Some voice, like that of Pomponia,  was calling yet in her soul, \"O Lygia, save thyself!\" But something  told her also that it was too late; that the one whom such a flame had  embraced as that which had embraced her, the one who had seen what was  done"]]]
