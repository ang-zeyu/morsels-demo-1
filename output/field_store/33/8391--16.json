They are not so gross as other writings of the time, and this is  Marguerite's true defence; to laugh at the immoralities of monks and  priests was a tradition in literature which neither the spirit of  the Renaissance nor that of the Reformation condemned. A company of  ladies and gentlemen, detained by floods on their return from the  Pyrenean baths, beguile the time by telling these tales, and the pious  widow Dame Oisille gives excellent assistance in showing how they  tend to a moral purpose. The series, designed to equal in number the  tales of the Decameron, is incomplete. Possibly Marguerite was aided  by some one or more of the authors of whom she was the patroness and  protector; but no sufficient evidence exists for the ascription of  the _Heptameron_ to Bonaventure des Periers.    Among the poets whom Marguerite received with favour at her court  was CLEMENT MAROT, the versifier, as characterised by Boileau, of  \"elegant badinage.\" His predecessors and early contemporaries in the  opening years of the sixteenth century continued the manner of the  so-called _rhetoriqueurs_, who endeavoured to maintain allegory, now  decrepit or effete, with the aid of ingenuities of versification and  pedantry of diction; or else they carried on something of the more  living tradition of Villon or of Coquillard. Among the former, Jean  le Maire de Belges deserves to be remembered less for his verse than  for his prose work, _Illustrations de Gaule et Singularitez de Troie_,  in which the Trojan origin of the French people is set forth with  some feeling for beauty and a mass of crude erudition. Clement Marot,  born at Cahors in 1495 or 1496, a poet's son, was for a time in the  service of Francis I. as _valet de chambre_, and accompanied his  master to the battle of Pavia, where he was wounded and made prisoner.  Pursued by the Catholics as a heretic, and afterwards by the Genevan  Calvinists as a libertine, he was protected as long as was possible  by the King and by his sister. He died at Turin, a refugee to Italy,  in 1544.    In his literary origins Marot belongs to the Middle Ages; he edited  the _Roman de la Rose_ and the works of Villon; his immediate masters  were the _grands rhetoriqueurs_; but the spirit of the Renaissance  and his own genius delivered him from the oppression of their  authority, and his intellect was attracted by the revolt and the  promise of freedom found in the Reforming party. A light and  pleasure-loving nature, a temper which made the prudent conduct of  life impossible, exposed him to risks, over which, aided by protectors  whom he knew how to flatter with a delicate grace, he glided without  fatal mishap. He did not bring to poetry depth of passion or solidity  of thought; he brought what was needed--a bright intelligence, a sense  of measure and proportion, grace, gaiety, _esprit_. Escaping, after  his early _Temple de Cupido_, from the allegorising style, he learned  to express his personal sentiments, and something of the gay,  bourgeois spirit of France, with aristocratic distinction. His  poetry of the court and of occasion has lost its savour; but when  he writes familiarly (as in the _Epitre au Roi pour avoir ete derobe_),  or tells a short tale (like the fable of the rat and the lion), he  is charmingly bright and natural. None of his poems--elegies,  epistles, satires, songs, epigrams, rondeaux, pastorals,  ballades--overwhelm us by their length; he was not a writer of vast  imaginative ambitions. His best epigrams are masterpieces in their  kind, with happy turns of thought and expression in which art seems  to have the ease of nature. The satirical epistle supposed to be sent,  not by Marot, but by his valet, to Marot's adversary, Sagon, is  spirited in its insolence. _L'Enfer_ is a satiric outbreak of  indignation suggested by his imprisonment in the Chatelet on the  charge of heresy. His versified translation of forty-nine Psalms  added to his glory, and brought him the honour of personal danger  from the hostility of the Sorbonne; but to attempt such a translation  is to aim at what is impossible. His gift to French poetry is  especially a gift of finer art--firm and delicate expression,  felicity in rendering a thought or a feeling, certainty and grace  in poetic evolution, skill in handling the decasyllabic line. A great  poet Marot was not, and could not be; but, coming at a fortunate moment,  his work served literature in important ways; it was a return from  laboured rhetoric to nature. In the classical age his merit was  recognised by La Bruyere, and the author of the _Fables_ and the  _Contes_--in some respects a kindred spirit--acknowledged a debt to  Marot.    From Marot as a poet much was learned by Marguerite of Navarre. Of  his contemporaries, who were also disciples, the most distinguished  was MELIN DE SAINT-GELAIS, and on the master's death Melin passed  for an eminent poet. We can regard him now more justly, as one who  in slender work sought for elegance, and fell into a mannered  prettiness. While preserving something of the French spirit, he  suffered from the frigid ingenuities which an imitation of Italian  models suggested to him; but it cannot be forgotten that Saint-Gelais  brought the sonnet from Italy into French poetry. The school of Marot,  ambitious in little things, affected much the _blason_, which  celebrates an eyebrow, a lip, a bosom, a jewel, a flower, a precious  stone; lyrical inspiration was slender, but clearness and grace were  worth attaining, and the conception of poetry as a fine art served  to lead the way towards Ronsard and the Pleiade.    The most powerful personality in literature of the first half of the  sixteenth century was not a poet, though he wrote verses, but a great  creator in imaginative prose, great partly by virtue of his native  genius, partly because the sap of the new age of enthusiasm for science  and learning was thronging in his veins--FRANCOIS RABELAIS. Born  about 1490 or 1495, at Chinon, in Touraine, of parents in a modest  station, he received his education in the village of Seuille and at  the convent of La Baumette. He revolted against the routine of the  schools, and longed for some nutriment more succulent and savoury.  For fifteen years he lived as a Franciscan monk in the cell and  cloisters of the monastery at Fontenay-le-Comte. In books, but not  those of a monastic library, he found salvation; mathematics,  astronomy, law, Latin, Greek consoled him during his period of  uncongenial seclusion. His criminal companions--books which might  be suspected of heresy--were sequestrated. The young Bishop of  Maillezais--his friend Geoffroy d'Estissac, who had aided his  studies--and the great scholar Bude came to his rescue, and passing  first, by favour of the Pope, to the Benedictine abbey of Maillezais,  before long he quitted the cloister, and, as a secular priest, began  his wanderings of a scholar in search of universal knowledge. In  1530-31 he was at Montpellier, studying medicine and lecturing on  medical works of Hippocrates and Galen; next year, at Lyons, one of  the learned group gathered around the great printers of that city,  he practised his art of physic in the public hospital, and was known  as a scientific author. Towards the close of 1532 he re-edited the  popular romance _Chroniques Gargantuines_, which tells the  adventures of the \"enormous giant Gargantua.\" It was eagerly read,  and brought laughter to the lips of Master Rabelais' patients.  Learning, he held, was good, but few things in this world are  wholesomer than laughter. The success of the _Chroniques_ seems to  have moved him to write a continuation, and in 1533 appeared  _Pantagruel_, the story of the deeds and prowess of Gargantua's giant  son, newly composed by Alcofribas Nasier, an anagram which concealed  the name of Francois Rabelais. It forms the second of the five books  which make up its author's famous work. A recast or rather a new  creation of the Chronicles of Gargantua, replacing the original  _Chroniques_, followed in 1535. It was not until 1546 and 1552 that  the second and--in its complete form--the third books of _Pantagruel_  appeared, and the authorship was acknowledged. The last book was  posthumous (1562 in part, 1564 in full), and the inferiority of style,  together with the more bitter spirit of its satire, have led many  critics to the opinion that it is only in part from the hand of the  great and wise humourist.    Rabelais was in Rome in 1534, and again in 1535, as physician to the  French ambassador, Jean du Bellay, Bishop of Paris. He pursued his  scientific studies in medicine and botany, took lessons in Arabic,  and had all a savant's intelligent curiosity for the remains of  antiquity. Some years of his life were passed in wandering from one  French university to another. Fearing the hostility of the Sorbonne,  during the last illness of his protector Francis I., he fled to the  imperial city of Metz. He was once again in Rome with Cardinal du  Bellay, in 1549. Next year the author of _Pantagruel_ was appointed  cure of Meudon, near Paris, but, perhaps as a concession to public  opinion, he resigned his clerical charges on the eve of the  publication of his fourth book. Rabelais died probably in 1552 or  1553, aged about sixty years.    On his death it might well have been said that the gaiety of nations  was eclipsed; but to his contemporaries Rabelais appeared less as  the enormous humourist, the buffoon Homer, than as a great scholar  and man of science, whose bright temper and mirthful conversation  were in no way inconsistent with good sense, sound judgment, and even  a habit of moderation. It is thus that he should still be regarded.  Below his laughter lay wisdom; below his orgy of grossness lay a noble  ideality; below the extravagances of his imagination lay the  equilibrium of a spirit sane and strong. The life "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24708"],[0,"The Biology, Physiology and Sociology of Reproduction (#15)"],[1,"and  to cause a sufficient fatigue of the muscular system so that rest is  sought and may be followed by dreamless, recuperative sleep.    It might at first seem paradoxical that to build up strong muscles we  must first fatigue them, but that seems to be Nature's plan. The only  way to build up a strong physique is to use that physique and use it  to its maximum capacity.    If one exercises thus freely and eats abstemiously he ought not to lay  on fat. If he does lay on fat, he may know that he is eating more than  he needs and he should make his diet more temperate. The youth of  eighteen or nineteen who is tall and rather spare, and whose muscular  system has not reached its full development would, of course, increase  his weight incident to the growth of his muscular system. This  increase in weight must not be confused with increase of weight  through fat deposit. The latter should be avoided--the former should  be encouraged.    Not by any means the least important thing accomplished by physical  exercise is the association with his fellows incident to his exercise.  The courage, nerve control, quick judgment, agility and strength  required on the foot-ball field make no small part of the young man's  equipment to fight the battles of life. The conditions of these games  give frequent opportunities for the young man to cultivate the spirit  of honesty and fair play--the spirit, without which, no man can reach  his highest success in the real contests of life.      4. THE HYGIENIC REQUIREMENTS OF SLEEP.    The personal hygiene of sleep is by no means an unimportant topic,  though it may be briefly treated.    The amount of sleep that each individual requires and should take can  only be determined by the individual. Some seem to require ten hours,  others eight, others six, while rarely individuals are found who seem  to thrive on even so little as five hours of sleep out of twenty-four.  The average requirement seems to be about eight hours. If one has by  experience or experiment determined the amount of sleep which he  requires, he should so plan his daily regime that he can secure that  amount of sleep. While a brief departure from this regime may be  without serious results, any prolonged departure from it will  certainly bring its natural retribution. So, the young man having  determined how much sleep he needs, should adopt a daily program that  will provide for just that many hours in bed, and he should early  establish the habit of going to sleep at once upon retiring, and of  arising at once upon awakening. Dallying in bed has led many a young  man to lapse into habits of thought and of action that are in a high  degree deleterious, morally and physically.    So far as one may choose the equipment of his sleeping apartment, he  should choose a hard bed and a cover as light as possible and yet be  comfortable.    One should never retire with cold feet. A most effective way to warm  the feet is to dip them for a moment in cold water and then rub them  vigorously with a coarse towel until they glow with warmth.  Furthermore, no more effective remedy for habitual cold feet could be  devised than this nightly tonic bath.    One will add greatly to his comfort and decrease largely the danger of  taking cold if he provides himself with a pair of warm bed room  slippers, which should always be worn during one's excursions to the  bath room, and during his tonic sponge bath.    As to posture in bed, the experience of men in general is, that the  most comfortable posture and the most hygienic one is to lie upon the  side. The right side is to be preferred to the left because in this  position, the heart being on the upper side, is not embarrassed in its  free movement by the superincumbent lung tissue. Furthermore, this  position facilitates the passage of digesting foods from the stomach.  To maintain comfortably this side position, requires that the knees  be at least moderately drawn up. This posture when asleep is  practically identical with that of nearly all higher animals, and is  unquestionably the most hygienic one for man. No animal but man ever  lies upon its back unless it is dead. Furthermore, the dorsal position  puts tendons, nerves and muscles on a stretch, while the flexed  lateral position puts these in a more or less relaxed position, which  is most favorable to rest.    It goes without saying that sleeping rooms should always be thoroughly  ventilated. The occupant should take care that he does not lie in a  direct draught from a window or door, because it has been found by  experience that one is less likely to catch cold if he sleeps out of  doors than he is if he sleeps in a direct draught from a window or  door. Just why this is has not been satisfactorily accounted for, but  the fact remains. So if you must sleep in the house, secure perfect  ventilation without direct draughts.      5. THE CONTROL OF THE THOUGHTS.    There is no more effective safeguard for the man who wishes to lead a  continent life than the control of the thoughts. It goes without  saying that the man who thinks about sexual matters, especially the  one whose imagination runs wild upon all kinds of sexually  stimulating images, is only inviting temptation to relax his  continence. If he controls his thoughts during those times when he is  less amenable to temptation, he is far more likely to be able to  control his acts at those times when his physical condition makes him  most amenable to temptation.    The most effective way to control the thoughts is so to plan one's  work as to insure the complete occupation of the mind with affairs  that are wholly independent of sexual experiences or considerations.  One should set a mark for himself so high above his present position  that he is compelled to put forth strenuous and unremitting efforts in  order to accomplish his aim. The old saying that, \"Satan finds work  for idle hands to do\" is all too true. Anyone may observe the  influence of idleness or even the influence of a partially occupied  program upon the habits of the youth and young man. Beard and  Rockwell, in their valuable work on this subject say: \"Go to work;  develop your muscles and brain; resolve to become at least useful if  not famous. The activity which will be necessary in carrying out these  ambitions will divert the mind from imaginary evils, if they are  imaginary, and will be one of the best means to cure the real ones.\"          CHAPTER VI.    DEVELOPMENT.          DEVELOPMENT.      The development of the child within the uterus of the mother  represents a chapter in the life history of every individual so  important in its relations to maternity and paternity that every young  man should be acquainted with at least its general features.    As stated in the chapter on Reproduction, every living organism begins  life as a single cell, or globule of protoplasm. In the case of the  human subject, the cell from which each child begins its development  is formed by the fusion of two cells or globules of protoplasm, one  furnished by the mother, and called the ovum, or egg; the other  furnished by the father, and called the spermatozoon. The egg is very  much larger than the spermatozoon, and contains enough yolk material  to afford nourishment for the embryo for a number of days.    When the ovum reaches the finished state, which is called \"maturity,\"  it leaves the ovary, and is carried along the fallopian tube (see  accompanying figure) into the uterus, where it usually finds a  lodgment in the upper part, as shown in Figure I. Once the minute ovum  has been caught in the projections of the velvety inner surface of the  uterus, this thick velvety lining of the uterus in the neighborhood of  the ovum begins a rapid growth, gradually enveloping the rapidly  expanding ovum, as shown in Figures I and II of the accompanying  plate.    Within the ovum there are taking place some of the most marvelous  changes in the whole life history of the individual. The nucleus of  the fertilized egg, and the protoplasm which surrounds it, divide into  two cells, then into four, eight, sixteen, etc. These divisions follow  each other in such rapid succession that there are many hundreds of  cells by the end of the first twenty-four hours. These cells soon  begin to arrange themselves into layers and groups, which, step by  step, develop the different tissues and organs of the body.    By the end of thirty days the little embryo, about as large as one  inch of the end of a lead pencil, would be recognized as the embryo of  some mammalian animal, but it would be quite impossible to say whether  it would develop into a human being or some other animal, if it were  seen quite apart from its immediate surroundings. By the end of  another thirty days, however, the little embryo has multiplied its  size several times, and has reached a form instantly recognizable as  the young of the human kind, as shown in Figure IV. It still, however,  retains the vestige of a little tail, which within the next thirty  days will have been completely absorbed.        [Illustration: THE FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION]    Note that the little two months embryo has projecting from its abdomen  a large structure which is labeled \"cord.\" This cord is a part of what  is called the umbilical cord, and it is this that joins the embryo  to the mother. Note in Figure III the large stalk of this cord passing  upward from the body of the embryo and merging into the structures in  the top of the uterus. Note further that there are little branching  structures passing from the base of this stalk up into the base of the  uterus. These branching structures are loops of blood-vessels, and  they form part of the placenta, or \"afterbirth.\" Through this cord the  embryo receives its nourishment from the mother. The blood of the  mother bathes these loops of blood-vessels, and the embryo absorbs  from the mother's blood the nourishment which builds"]]]
