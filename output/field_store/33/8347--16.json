Unknown, yet well-known to the eye of faith!        Ah, I have heard that wail far, far away        In distant lands, by many a sheltered bay,      When slumbered in his cave the water-wraith        And the waves gently kissed the classic shore      Of France or Italy, beneath the moon,      When earth lay tranced in a dreamless swoon:        And every time the music rose,--before      Mine inner vision rose a form sublime,      Thy form, O Tree, as in my happy prime      I saw thee, in my own loved native clime.        Therefore I fain would consecrate a lay        Unto thy honour, Tree, beloved of those        Who now in blessed sleep, for aye, repose,      Dearer than life to me, alas! were they!        Mayst thou be numbered when my days are done      With deathless trees--like those in Borrowdale,      Under whose awful branches lingered pale        \"Fear, trembling Hope, and Death, the skeleton,      And Time the shadow;\" and though weak the verse      That would thy beauty fain, oh fain rehearse,      May Love defend thee from Oblivion's curse.

[Illustration: FASTENING RODS TO BACK WITH IRON SQUARES.]    Sometimes the hair will be found missing in one or more places on a  finished animal and in such case \"Old Dr. Le Page's Liquid Hair  Restorer\" is the only remedy. The place to be covered is coated with  glue and a small tuft of hair from the same or another skin grasped with  a forceps, the base touched with glue and carefully placed. The hair is  arranged with a setting needle before the glue hardens, and though a  tedious operation it may be performed so well as to defy detection.    Another way where the hair or fur is of some length is to procure a  patch of the right size with hair matching that surrounding, shaving the  hide thin, coating the back with glue and pinning on the bare spot.          CHAPTER XVI.    MOUNTING HEADS OF SMALL ANIMALS, BIRDS AND FISH.      One of the most interesting collections which the average nature lover  can make is of the heads of small game. The expense is smaller than  where the entire subject is preserved, they occupy but little room, and  are easily kept in good order.    [Illustration: WILD CAT HEAD MOUNTED ON SHIELD.]    Heads of small fur bearers are all mounted in about the same way. In  skinning split down the back of neck from between the ears to base of  neck, cut around neck in front of shoulders and turn the scalp wrong  side out over the head, put it through the usual pickling, paring,  cleaning and poisoning. If ears are pocketed and lips split before  pickling it may prevent the loss of hair and epidermis, in warm weather  especially. Clean the skull if the head is to be mounted with open  mouth. If the skull is not to be had, the teeth are broken, or you are  in a great hurry, use an artificial form with the interior of the mouth  already modelled.    Enlarge the opening at the back of skull and insert a piece of board not  wider than the depth of neck from top to bottom. Drill a hole in top of  skull and drive a screw into the board into the board inside skull  cavity, prop the lower jaw open the desired distance and fill around its  articulations and the base of skull around neck board with freshly mixed  plaster of paris.    [Illustration: FOX HEAD SKINNED AND ON NECK STANDARD.]    When this hardens the skull with open jaws is firmly fixed on end of  neck board. Fasten neck board in vise and mark where to saw off,  allowing for a piece of 1/2 inch board shaped like a cross section of  the neck. If an artificial form is used, screw it to the neck board and  treat the same otherwise.    Make the neck short rather than long with the nose lower than the eyes  in most cases. Build up neck and head by winding on tow. Mount and  finish the head as directed in rug work.    [Illustration: LEOPARD HEAD, ARTIFICIAL.]    The skin may be fastened at the end of neck by pins or brads driven all  around the neck. Trim off any surplus with a knife, cutting from inside  the skin to prevent cutting off ends of fur.    If a skin has been ripped up the front to the chin careful sewing will  make it presentable, though such seams are hard to conceal.    [Illustration: HAWK HEAD.]    The heads of birds of prey and the larger game birds show up well  mounted and need no special treatment from that generally given. The  neck only is made up on a wire, one end of which is sharpened to thrust  through the skull while the other is stapled or clinched to a bit of  board round or oval shape. The skin of the base of neck is fastened to  this by sewing back and forth across the back. Heads of fish like bass  and pike are prepared by cutting off just back of the gills and cleaning  from the back all brains and flesh.    After poisoning, fill them with tow or cotton, bracing the mouth open if  wanted so and keep in the desired position until dry. Then the fibrous  filling is removed and they are filled permanently with plaster or paper  pulp and a piece of board fastened in the back of head to furnish a hold  for screws from the back of the shield or panel.    The inside of the mouth will need remodelling with wax and the whole  given a coat of white varnish. Any bright colors which may have faded  should be retouched with oil colors before varnishing.    Suitable mounts for small heads are in the regular shield and round and  oval shapes, and rustic panels of natural wood. A number of small heads  may be mounted on one long panel.          CHAPTER XVII.    MOUNTING HEADS OF LARGE GAME.      Mounting heads, of horned game especially, is a branch of taxidermy  which suffers no diminution in popularity. Such work is turned out at  the present time in far better shape than it was years ago, but many  fine heads still remain that were gathered in days of abundance of  buffalo, elk and mountain sheep.    [Illustration: SHEEP HEAD.]    In skinning horned heads never open the skin up the front of the neck;  not only are such seams difficult to hide but the skull with antlers  cannot be entirely removed from the skin as it should be.    To do this open the skin down the center of the back of the neck from  just back of the horns to the shoulders or at least half that distance.  A neck of medium length is preferable and many a fine head has been  ruined by being cut off just back of the ears.    Connect the upper end of the opening cut with the base of each horn or  antler by a short branch making the whole opening of a Y or T shape.  Turn the neck skin inside out down over the head, which in case of a  deer may rest on the antlers, until the ears are reached, cut these off  not too close to the head and the horns are next met with.    [Illustration: SKINNING HORNED HEADS. CUT ON HEAVY LINES.]    Work the skin from around the base of these with a dull knife or a small  screwdriver blade. With the same tool pry the thick skin away from the  frontal bone. When the eyes are reached have a care not to cut their  lids, working closer to the bone than the skin. Use the screwdriver  again to scoop up the skin from the so-called tear pits in front of the  eyes.    Let all the dark colored skin on the inside of the lips remain attached  to them. The skin of the neck is the thickest on the whole animal and  must be reduced by shaving. The skin of the whole head and neck should  not only be freed from all flesh and muscle but shaved to about one-half  its original thickness. For this purpose work on it with a sharp knife  or draw shave on a half rounded beam.    [Illustration: HORNED HEADS--ANTELOPE, DEER.]    Split the lips and remove their fleshy interior, split the nose  cartilage and separate it from the outer skin. With some blunt tool pry  the skin of the back of the ear from the cartilage and turn the ears  wrong side out to their tips. Give the scalp at least 24 hours' pickling  or it will be liable to excessive shrinkage on drying.    Many a fine head mounted green, without thinning or pickling, has shrunk  and continued to shrink for months, until all stitches gave way and it  cracked and shriveled to an inglorious end. If a paper head form is to  be used, the top of the skull at the base of the antlers is sawn off and  the balance of the skull discarded, the more common method will require  the cleaning of the skull with antlers remaining on it. A little boiling  will expedite this and by chopping an opening (1-1/2 inches wide in case  of a deer) into the lower part of the brain cavity the brain is removed.  This opening will also receive the end of a wooden neck standard of  plank three inches wide.    [Illustration: DEER SKULL ON STANDARD.]    A nail through the top of skull will hold it temporarily till the lower  jaw bones are placed and the whole held solid by packing the base of  skull and jaws in a mass of soft plaster which will harden in a few  minutes. This neck standard should be at right angles to the greatest  length of the head.    Measuring the neck skin where cut off gives the circumference of an  egg-shaped board, representing a cross section of the neck at that point  in a vertical line. The neck standard is sawed off at the proper place  and angle and made fast to the board by nails and screws. With a very  short neck it will be necessary to depress the nose considerably that  the antlers may not come in contact with the wall. This should all be  calculated before fixing the skull permanently on the neck standard. The  standard can be held in the vise and a little measuring will indicate  the point of attachment and angle needed to clear the wall.    [Illustration: NECK BOARD.]    Now wind excelsior on the neck standard and skull until the skinned head  and neck are roughly reproduced. Try the skin on occasionally to guide  in this.    Do not put any excelsior on the upper part of the skull and face as no  amount of flesh was removed there. Give the cheeks a natural fullness  and remember the neck was not round like a stove pipe. By sewing from  side to side the shape of the gullet and wind pipe can be molded. When  the skin is still not quite filled give the head and neck a coating of  potter's (or modelling) clay and then several coats of well pasted paper  as directed for covering manikins for large animals.    When this has completely dried out remove skin from pickle, clean and  poison it and after placing the ear forms it will be ready to cover the  head and neck. I prefer good cardboard forms for the ears though some  use only metal. Lead is too clumsy and heavy, copper and wire cloth  corrode, pure sheet tin works nicely but is expensive.    The form should receive a couple coats of liquid glue before the skin is  put on to stay. Fasten the skin in front of the eyes with a brad and  draw into place about the base of the antlers. Use a heavy needle and  waxed linen cord for this sewing. Heavy gilling twine doubled will do.    Sew up from first one and then the other antler to the central cut down  the back of the neck, tie "]]]
