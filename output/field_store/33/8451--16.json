However, Afghanistan remains extremely poor, landlocked,    and highly dependent on foreign aid, farming, and trade with    neighboring countries. It will probably take the remainder of the    decade and continuing donor aid and attention to raise Afghanistan's    living standards up from its current status among the lowest in the    world. Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of    housing, clean water, electricity, medical care, and jobs, but the    Afghan government and international donors remain committed to    improving access to these basic necessities by prioritizing    infrastructure development, education, housing development, jobs    programs, and economic reform over the next year. Growing political    stability and continued international commitment to Afghan    reconstruction create an optimistic outlook for maintaining    improvements to the Afghan economy in 2004. The replacement of the    opium trade - which may account for one-third of GDP - is one of    several potential spoilers for the economy over the long term.

Then her face worked  convulsively, and crouching down, as though she would bury her feet in  the earth, she addressed the doctor in words both plaintive and wild:  \"Is it possible that, after what is now happening, M. de Brinvilliers  can endure to go on living?\"    \"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"when our Lord was about to leave His  disciples, He did not ask God to remove them from this earth, but to  preserve them from all sin. 'My Father,' He said, 'I ask not that You  take them from the world, but keep them safe from evil.' If, madame, you  pray for M. de Brinvilliers, let it be only that he may be kept in  grace, if he has it, and may attain to it if he has it not.\"    But the words were useless: at that moment the humiliation was too great  and too public; her face contracted, her eyebrows knit, flames darted  from her eyes, her mouth was all twisted. Her whole appearance was  horrible; the devil was once more in possession. During this paroxysm,  which lasted nearly a quarter of an hour, Lebrun, who stood near, got  such a vivid impression of her face that the following night he could  not sleep, and with the sight of it ever before his eyes made the fine  drawing which--is now in the Louvre, giving to the figure the head of a  tiger, in order to show that the principal features were the same, and  the whole resemblance very striking.    The delay in progress was caused by the immense crowd blocking the  court, only pushed aside by archers on horseback, who separated the  people. The marquise now went out, and the doctor, lest the sight of the  people should completely distract her, put a crucifix in her hand,  bidding her fix her gaze upon it. This advice she followed till they  gained the gate into the street where the tumbril was waiting; then she  lifted her eyes to see the shameful object. It was one of the smallest  of carts, still splashed with mud and marked by the stones it had  carried, with no seat, only a little straw at the bottom. It was drawn  by a wretched horse, well matching the disgraceful conveyance.    The executioner bade her get in first, which she did very rapidly, as if  to escape observation. There she crouched like a wild beast, in the left  corner, on the straw, riding backwards. The doctor sat beside her on the  right. Then the executioner got in, shutting the door behind him, and  sat opposite her, stretching his legs between the doctor's. His man,  whose business it was to guide the horse, sat on the front, back to back  with the doctor and the marquise, his feet stuck out on the shafts. Thus  it is easy to understand how Madame de Sevigne, who was on the Pont  Notre-Dame, could see nothing but the headdress of the marquise as she  was driven to Notre-Dame.    The cortege had only gone a few steps, when the face of the marquise,  for a time a little calmer, was again convulsed. From her eyes, fixed  constantly on the crucifix, there darted a flaming glance, then came a  troubled and frenzied look which terrified the doctor. He knew she must  have been struck by something she saw, and, wishing to calm her, asked  what it was.    \"Nothing, nothing,\" she replied quickly, looking towards him; \"it was  nothing.\"    \"But, madame,\" said he, \"you cannot give the lie to your own eyes; and a  minute ago I saw a fire very different from the fire of love, which only  some displeasing sight can have provoked. What may this be? Tell me,  pray; for you promised to tell me of any sort of temptation that might  assail you.\"    \"Sir,\" she said, \"I will do so, but it is nothing.\" Then, looking  towards the executioner, who, as we know, sat facing the doctor, she  said, \"Put me in front of you, please; hide that man from me.\" And she  stretched out her hands towards a man who was following the tumbril on  horseback, and so dropped the torch, which the doctor took, and the  crucifix, which fell on the floor. The executioner looked back, and then  turned sideways as she wished, nodding and saying, \"Oh yes, I  understand.\" The doctor pressed to know what it meant, and she said, \"It  is nothing worth telling you, and it is a weakness in me not to be able  to bear the sight of a man who has ill-used me. The man who touched the  back of the tumbril is Desgrais, who arrested me at Liege, and treated  me so badly all along the road. When I saw him, I could not control  myself, as you noticed.\"    \"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"I have heard of him, and you yourself spoke  of him in confession; but the man was sent to arrest you, and was in a  responsible position, so that he had to guard you closely and  rigorously; even if he had been more severe, he would only have been  carrying out his orders. Jesus Christ, madame, could but have regarded  His executioners as ministers of iniquity, servants of injustice, who  added of their own accord every indignity they could think of; yet all  along the way He looked on them with patience and more than patience,  and in His death He prayed for them.\"    In the heart of the marquise a hard struggle was passing, and this was  reflected on her face; but it was only for a moment, and after a last  convulsive shudder she was again calm and serene; then she said:--    \"Sir, you are right, and I am very wrong to feel such a fancy as this:  may God forgive me; and pray remember this fault on the scaffold, when  you give me the absolution you promise, that this too may be pardoned  me.\" Then she turned to the executioner and said, \"Please sit where you  were before, that I may see M. Desgrais.\" The man hesitated, but on a  sign from the doctor obeyed. The marquise looked fully at Desgrais for  some time, praying for him; then, fixing her eyes on the crucifix, began  to pray for herself: this incident occurred in front of the church of  Sainte-Genevieve des Ardents.    But, slowly as it moved, the tumbril steadily advanced, and at last  reached the place of Notre-Dame. The archers drove back the crowding  people, and the tumbril went up to the steps, and there stopped. The  executioner got down, removed the board at the back, held out his arms  to the marquise, and set her down on the pavement. The doctor then got  down, his legs quite numb from the cramped position he had been in since  they left the Conciergerie. He mounted the church steps and stood behind  the marquise, who herself stood on the square, with the registrar on her  right, the executioner on her left, and a great crowd of people behind  her, inside the church, all the doors being thrown open. She was made to  kneel, and in her hands was placed the lighted torch, which up to that  time the doctor had helped to carry. Then the registrar read the 'amende  honorable' from a written paper, and she began to say it after him, but  in so low a voice that the executioner said loudly, \"Speak out as he  does; repeat every word. Louder, louder!\" Then she raised her voice, and  loudly and firmly recited the following apology.    \"I confess that, wickedly and for revenge, I poisoned my father and my  brothers, and attempted to poison my sister, to obtain possession of  their goods, and I ask pardon of God, of the king, and of my country's  laws.\"    The 'amende honorable' over, the executioner again carried her to the  tumbril, not giving her the torch any more: the doctor sat beside her:  all was just as before, and the tumbril went on towards La Greve. From  that moment, until she arrived at the scaffold, she never took her eyes  off the crucifix, which the doctor held before her the whole time,  exhorting her with religious words, trying to divert her attention from  the terrible noise which the people made around the car, a murmur  mingled with curses.    When they reached the Place de Greve, the tumbril stopped at a little  distance from the scaffold. Then the registrar M. Drouet, came up on  horseback, and, addressing the marquise, said, \"Madame, have you nothing  more to say? If you wish to make any declaration, the twelve  commissaries are here at hand, ready to receive it.\"    \"You see, madame,\" said the doctor, \"we are now at the end of our  journey, and, thank God, you have not lost your power of endurance on  the road; do not destroy the effect of all you have suffered and all you  have yet to suffer by concealing what you know, if perchance you do know  more than you have hitherto said.\"    \"I have told all I know,\" said the marquise, \"and there is no more I can  say.\"    \"Repeat these words in a loud voice,\" said the doctor, \"so that  everybody may hear.\"    Then in her loudest voice the marquise repeated--    \"I have told all I know, and there is no more I can say.\"    After this declaration, they were going to drive the tumbril nearer to  the scaffold, but the crowd was so dense that the assistant could not  force a way through, though he struck out on every side with his whip.  So they had to stop a few paces short. The executioner had already got  down, and was adjusting the ladder. In this terrible moment of waiting,  the marquise looked calmly and gratefully at the doctor, and when she  felt that the tumbril had stopped, said, \"Sir, it is not here we part:  you promised not to leave me till my head is cut off. I trust you will  keep your word.\"    \"To be sure I will,\" the doctor replied; \"we shall not be separated  before the moment of your death: be not troubled about that, for I will  never forsake you.\"    \"I looked for this kindness,\" she said, \"and your promise was too solemn  for you to think for one moment of failing me. Please be on the scaffold  and be near me. And now, sir, I would anticipate the final  farewell,--for all the things I shall have to do on the scaffold may  distract me,--so let me thank you here. If I am prepared to suffer the  sentence of my earthly judge, and to hear that of my heavenly judge, I  owe it to your care for me, and I am deeply grateful. I can only ask  your forgiveness for the trouble I have given you.\" Tears choked the  doctor's speech, and he could"]]]
