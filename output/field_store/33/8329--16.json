It would be foolish, for example, for  the man whose reading hitherto has consisted entirely of the modern  novels of a circulating library, to turn at once to the Paradise Lost,  Bacon's Essays, or the poems of Wordsworth. He would probably acquire a  distaste for good literature which might never be overcome.    It is like everything else that counts: we set the greatest store by  those things that we have come by through difficulties. The longer the  journey and the more beautiful the scenes we pass through, the greater  our pleasure and subsequent recollection of it. Let us begin our  systematic reading by turning at first to those books which we shall  appreciate immediately. Have novels been our reading hitherto? Then let  us turn at once to some of the greater novelists, both living and dead.  Here the field is wide, and we may quickly find writers to our taste.  Thus we shall gradually work up to some name or names in the list of the  immortals. In the same way we shall approach, step by step, the  essayists, the moralists, the dramatists and (lastly) the poets.    It cannot be emphasised too strongly that Time above all other  considerations decides what we shall read. Moreover, there are passages  in many of the greatest writers that appeal to a man before he has really  arrived at the time of their understanding. So that, reading some such  passage (_e.g._ Addison's description of the Widows' Club in the  'Spectator') as this, and finding the remainder not to his taste, he  concludes that he has discovered the kernel and that the rest can be cast  aside. Practice alone makes perfect: _macte nova virtute, puer, sic itur  ad astra_.    With regard to editions, it were needless to specify them; the great  books of the world are reprinted and re-edited every few years. But our  editions should be _good_ ones. 'A good edition should be a complete  edition, ungarbled and unabridged.'[28] Perchance you may prefer to have  them, if it be possible, in the original editions? If so, you will be  wise in your generation, but your purse will need to be a long one  indeed.    Remember that the first edition is not necessarily the best. It  may be, but in the great majority of cases it is not. In addition to the  inevitable clerical mistakes and printer's errors which are almost always  corrected in the second and subsequent editions, the author or editor  frequently interpolates matter which the publication _de ipso_ has  brought to his notice by reviews or correspondence. This is notably the  case in large and important works. 'Scott's Last Expedition,' published  in two large octavo volumes in 1914, rapidly passed through five editions  the same year, corrections being incorporated in each successive edition  (thereby distinguishing them from mere 'impressions'); so that the fifth  edition remains the best, being the most correct. On the other hand, in  the second edition an author sometimes omits passages or makes drastic  emendations from prudential reasons. Then it is that the first edition is  to be sought for in preference to all others, for this alone contains the  author's true opinions on certain subjects. Such instances the  book-lover gradually learns in his journey through the world of books.    But I repeat that, apart from this question of first or later issue, our  editions should be good ones. Good editions are not merely luxuries. The  better the type and paper, the greater our ease in reading, and--most  important of all--the consequent safeguarding of our eyesight.    It is not only type and paper, however, that constitute a good edition.  In addition to these requisites it must contain the recognised text  complete, it must be in a seemly and convenient shape, neither  extravagant nor blatant, and it must not contain a long list of errata.  Of the many qualities that go to make up a good edition, after paper and  print, these are perhaps the most important. But there is another  immediate consideration: _shall it have notes?_ And this raises such a  momentous point that I almost hesitate to approach it. The answer must be  qualified. Provided always that the edition has been superintended (I use  the word advisedly) by a _recognised_ scholar, and that the notes are  few, short, and concise, it is well. But who has not suffered under the  tedious and tiresome verbosity of editors? The writer possesses an  edition of Pope in which page after page contains two lines of the poet  and thirty-four lines of editor. Reed's Shakespeare (1813) frequently  contains a solitary line of text with forty of notes. Fortunately,  however, such things are now numbered with the past.    As to our editions of the Greek and Latin Classics, whether we can read  them in the original tongue or whether we must have recourse to  translations, we have already debated. But without wishing to discourage  the book-lover in any possible way from making (or renewing, as the case  may be) acquaintance with these great writers, it must be borne in mind  that few indeed are the translations from any language that are wholly in  the spirit of the original. In recommending the following translations of  some of the greater world-classics, literary and animate qualities have  been had in view no less than scholarly translation.    Aeschylus and Sophocles have been admirably rendered in English verse by  Mr. E. D. A. Morshead. Of the first, 'The House of Atreus' (being the  'Agamemnon,' 'Libation-Bearers,' and 'Furies') was first published by him  in 1881, an octavo volume which was reprinted in 1890 and 1901. 'The  Suppliant Maidens,' 'The Persians,' 'The Seven against Thebes,' and  'Prometheus Bound' were collected in one octavo volume in 1908. His  version of Sophocles' 'Oedipus the King' was published in 1885, while the  'Ajax' and 'Electra' were printed in prose, 1895.    The Plays of Aristophanes are, perhaps, best known to English readers by  Hookham Frere's excellent translations. His first volume, containing the  'Acharnians,' the 'Knights,' and the 'Birds,' was originally printed at  Malta in 1839, in which year a similar quarto volume containing the  'Frogs' was also issued. But there are several later editions of both  these volumes, and almost any bookseller can provide one. In addition to  these plays, the 'Clouds' and the 'Wasps' were included in Thomas  Mitchell's version first published in two octavo volumes dated 1820 and  1822. But we may have a complete set of the eleven plays which have come  down to us, in Mr. B. B. Rogers' scholarly translation in verse. This  beautiful edition in eleven small quarto volumes was published by Messrs.  George Bell and Sons between 1902 and 1916, and has the Greek and English  on opposite pages. For the plays of Euripides we must turn to the  metrical versions of Professor Gilbert Murray, published by Mr. George  Allen between 1905 and 1915. Perhaps it is not too much to say that this  great scholar-poet has done more than any other to bring the Greeks of  old before those to whom a classical education has been denied.    Needless to say, the translation into English of the immortal Homeric  cycle has tempted many pens. Among the best known versions are those of  Pope, Chapman, and Cowper. But this matter has been so thoroughly  debated by Mr. Frederic Harrison in his delightful volume 'The Choice of  Books,' that I will refrain from poaching upon his preserve, and will  content myself by remarking that the recommendations of this excellent  judge are the 'Iliad' of Lord Derby and the 'Odyssey' of Philip Worsley.  This last is a beautiful translation in the Spenserian stanza, of which a  second edition appeared in 1868, in two octavo volumes. But if you are  not already acquainted with Mr. Harrison's work you will do well to  obtain it, and to read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest all that he has  to say therein upon 'The Poets of the Old World.'    With regard to the Latin classics, if we are unacquainted with the  language there is greater difficulty; for it is next to impossible to  render in English the light and vivacious lilt of the Italian poets. Our  translations may be fine, scholarly, dignified and the rest of it, but  they bear little semblance to the originals. Dryden's version of the  'Aeneid' may be read, not as a translation but as an epic in the English  of a great poet; and to those who are masters of sufficient Latin to  explore the ancients by the help of commentaries, Conington's translation  will be of assistance. Horace is utterly untranslatable, and prose  translations afford little clue to the music of his songs.    Perhaps it goes without saying that in reading these ancient classics we  shall necessarily lose much of their sentiment and allusion unless our  memory has retained that atmosphere of classic times which we obtained by  constant intercourse with these ancients during our years at school. We  may refresh our memory, however, and at the same time glean the most  modern thought upon those times, by having recourse to certain useful  volumes, companions to our study of these classic writers.    J. A. St. John's 'Manners and Customs of Ancient Greece,' three octavo  volumes which appeared in 1842, is a perfect encyclopaedia in itself. Of  Mr. Leonard Whibley's 'Companion to Greek Studies' a third edition, with  more than 200 illustrations and maps, was published by the Cambridge  University Press in 1916. The fellow volume is by Sir J. E. Sandys, and  is entitled 'A Companion to Latin Studies.' The second edition, very  fully illustrated, appeared in 1913--a large octavo also published at a  guinea by the same press. Professor Mahaffy's 'Social Life in Greece from  Homer to Menander' has gone through a number of editions. For the theatre  of the Greeks we must turn to 'The Attic Theatre' by A. E. Haigh. The  third edition, edited by Mr. A. W. Pickard-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22718"],[0,"Cathedrals and Cloisters of the South of France, Volume 1 (#15)"],[1,"were swept away. Thus  ended the temporal power of the Papacy in France, planned for worldly  profit and carried out with many sordid compromises;--a residency  unnoted for great deeds or noble intentions and whose close marked the  \"Great Schism.\"    To-day papal Avignon is become French Avignon, a pleasant city where the  Provencal sun is hot and where the Mistral whistles merrily. Above the  banks of the Rhone the simple Cathedral stands, with its priests still  garbed in papal red, its Host still carried under the white papal  panoply. Here also is the great Palace of the Popes, \"which is indeed,\"  says Froissart, \"the strongest and most magnificent house in the world.\"  And yet its grim walls suggest neither peace nor rest; and to him who  recalls, this great, impressive pile tells neither of glories nor of  triumphs. Bands of unbelieving Pastoureaux marched toward it; soldiers  of the \"White Companies\" and soldiers of du Guesclin gazed mockingly at  it; it was the prison of Rienzi, and the home of the harassed Popes who  had ever before them, just across the river, the menacing tower of that  \"fair king\" who had led them into \"Babylonish captivity.\"      [Sidenote: Vaison.]    On the banks of a pleasant little river among the Provencal hills is  Vaison, one of the ancient Gallic towns which became entirely romanised;  and many illustrious families of the Empire had summer villas there as  at Arles and Orange. Barbarians of one epoch or another have devastated  Vaison of all her antique treasures, except the remains of an  Amphitheatre on the Puymin Hill. Germanic tribes who swooped down in  early centuries destroyed her villas and her greater buildings; and  vandals of a later day have scattered her sculptures and her tablets  here and there. Some are in the galleries of Avignon; a Belus, the only  one found in France, was sent to the Museum of Saint-Germain; and in the  multitude of treasures in the British Museum, the most beautiful of all  her statues, a Diadumenus, is artistically lost. In the days when it  still adorned the city, during the reign of the Emperor Gallienus,  Vaison was christianised by Saint Ruf, her Bishopric was founded, and in  337 the first General Council of the Church held in Gaul assembled here.  Another Council in the V century, and still another in the VI, are proof  of her continued importance.    [Illustration: \"ON THE BANKS OF A PLEASANT LITTLE RIVER IS VAISON.\"]    [Illustration: \"THE RUINED CASTLE OF THE COUNTS OF TOULOUSE.\"--VAISON.]    Among the first of Gallo-Roman cities, she was also among the first to  suffer. Chrocus and his horde who sacked Orange, seized her Bishop and  murdered him; and Alains, Vandals, and Burgundians, following in their  wake, brought disaster after disaster to the cities lying near the  Rhone. Vaison, by miracle, did not lose her prestige. In the X and XI  centuries she built her fine Cathedral with its Cloisters, and in 1179  she was still great enough to excite the covetousness of Raymond VI,  Count of Toulouse. This magnificent and ambitious prince built a castle  on a height above the city, and as he had before terrorised my Lord  Bishop of Carpentras, so now he seized the anointed person of Berenger  de Reilhane, who was not only Vaison's Bishop, but her temporal prince  as well. Berenger was a sufficiently powerful personage to make an  outcry which re-echoed throughout Christendom; the Pope and the Emperor  came to his aid; and in the Abbey Church of Saint-Gilles-du-Gard,  Raymond VI did solemn penance, and, before receiving absolution, was  publicly struck by the Papal Legate with a bundle of birch rods. Above  the Bishop's Palace the great castle still loomed in menace, but on that  day Berenger de Reilhane triumphed and Vaison was at peace.    It was a peace which presaged her quiet, uneventful downfall. For other  interests were growing stronger in the country, other cities grew where  she stood still, and in the XIV century, when Avignon became the seat of  papal power, Vaison had passed from the world's history. Her Bishopric  endured till 1801, but her doings are worthy only of provincial  chronicles and to-day she is but a little country town, served by the  stage-coach. She still lies on both banks of the river; the \"high city,\"  with long rows of deserted houses, climbs the side of the steep hill and  is dominated by the ruins of the great castle, which Richelieu  destroyed. The \"lower city,\" which is the busier of the two, lies on the  opposite bank; and on its outskirts, in a little garden-close, almost  surrounded by the fields, is the Cathedral,--solitary, lonely, and old.    [Illustration: \"THE WHOLE APSE-END.\"--VAISON.]    [Illustration: \"THE SOUTH WALL WHICH IS CLEARLY SEEN FROM THE  ROAD.\"--VAISON.]    The decoration of the exterior is slight, a dentiled cornice and a  graceful foliated frieze extend along the top of the side-walls, which  although most plainly built, are far from being severely angular or  gaunt and have a quaint and pleasing harmony of line. The west front is  so featureless that it scarcely deserves the title of facade. The south  wall, which is clearly seen from the road, has a small portal and plain  buttresses that slope at the top. The central apse is rectangular and  heavy, the little southern apse is short and round, and that of the  north is tall and thin as a pepper-box. Behind them rise the pointed  roof of the nave and the heavy tower. The whole apse-end is constructed  in most picturesque irregularity, and the new red of the roof-tiles and  sombre grey of the old stone add greatly to its charm.    Unlike many churches of its period Notre-Dame of Vaison is three-aisled.  Slender, narrow naves, whose tunnel vaults are not extremely lofty, end  in small circular apses. The nave is a short one of three irregular  bays, and over the last, which precedes the choir, is the little  eight-sided dome, which instead of projecting above the roof is  curiously placed a little lower than the tunnel vaulting of the other  bays. The High Altar, which originally belonged to an older church, is  well placed in the simple choir; for it belongs in style, if not in  actual fact, to the first centuries of the Faith; and in the  semi-darkness behind the altar, the old episcopal throne still stands  against the apse's wall, in memory of the custom of the Church's early  days. The low arches of the aisles, the dim lighting of the church, its  simple ornaments of classic bands and little capitals, its slight  irregularities of form and carvings, make an interior of fine and strong  antique simplicity.    A little door in the north wall leads to the Cloisters, which are  happily in a state of complete restoration, and not as a modern writer  has described them, \"practically a ruin.\" The wall which overlooks them  has an inscription that adjures the Canons to \"bear with patience the  north aspect of their cells.\" The short walks have tunnel vaults with  cross-vaults in the corners and in parts of the north aisle. Great piers  and small, firm columns support the outer arches; and on the exterior of  the Cloister the little arches of the columns are enclosed in a large  round arch. Many of the capitals are uncarved, some of the piers have  applied columns, but many are ornamented in straight cut lines. On one  side, two bays open to the ground, forming an entrance-way into the  pretty close, where the bushy tops of a few tall trees cast flickering  shadows on the surrounding walls and the little grassy square.    [Illustration: \"TWO BAYS OPEN TO THE GROUND.\"--VAISON.]    [Illustration: \"THE GREAT PIERS AND SMALL FIRM COLUMNS.\"--VAISON.]    The Cloister is small and simple in its rather heavy grace. Noise and  unrest seem far from it, and underneath its solid rounded vault is peace  and shelter from the world. And in its firm solidity of architecture  there is the spirit of a perfect quiet, a tranquil charm which must  insensibly have calmed many a restless spirit that chafed beneath the  churchly frock, and fled within its walls for refuge and for helpful  meditation.    Few Provencal Cathedrals have the interest of Vaison and its Cloister.  Lying in the forgotten valley of the Ouveze, in an old-fashioned town,  all its surroundings speak of the past and its atmosphere is quite  unspoiled. The church itself has been spared degenerating restorations;  and although it has no sumptuousness as at Marseilles, no grandeur as at  Arles, no stirring history as the churches that lay near the sea,  although it is one of the smallest and most venerable of them all, no  Cathedral of the Southland has so great an architectural dignity and  merit with so ancient and so quaint a charm.      [Sidenote: Arles.]    In the midst of the wealth of antique ruins, near the Theatre, the  Coliseum, and the Forum of this \"little Rome of the Gauls,\" stands a  noble monument of the ruder ages of Christianity, the Cathedral,  Saint-Trophime. Here Saint Augustine, apostle to England, was  consecrated; here three General Councils of the Church were held, here  the Donatists were doomed to everlasting fire, and here the Emperor  Constantine, from his summer palace on the Rhone, must have come to  \"assist\" at Mass. The building in which these solemn scenes of the early  Church were enacted soon disappeared and was replaced by the present one  whose older walls Revoil attributes to the IX century. The present  Cathedral's first documentary date is 1152, in the era of the Republic  of Arles. The name of Saint-Etienne was changed, and the body of  Saint-Trophime, carried in state from the ruined Church of the  Aliscamps, was buried under a new altar and he was solemnly proclaimed  the Patron of the richest and most majestic church in all Provence.
