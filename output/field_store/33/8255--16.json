S.    _Vasantasena._ [_With a smile._] His excitement is a little out of  place.    _Sharvilaka._ Yes!        Those men are fools, it seems to me,        Who trust to women or to gold;      For gold and girls, 'tis plain to see.        Are false as virgin snakes and cold.                       12        Love not a woman; if you ever do,        She mocks at you, and plays the gay deceiver:      Yet if she loves you, you may love her too;        But if she doesn't, leave her.                             13    Too true it is that        A courtezan will laugh and cry for gold;        She trusts you not, but waits your trustful hour.      If virtue and a name are yours, then hold!        Avoid her as you would a graveyard flower.                 14    And again:        As fickle as the billows of the sea,        Glowing no longer than the evening sky,      A woman takes your gold, then leaves you free;        You're worthless, like cosmetics, when you're dry.         15    Yes, women are indeed fickle.        One man perhaps may hold her heart in trust,        She lures another with coquettish eyes,      Sports with another in unseemly lust,        Another yet her body satisfies.                            16    As some one has well said:        On mountain-tops no lotuses are grown;        The horse's yoke no ass will ever bear;      Rice never springs from seeds of barley sown;        A courtezan is not an honest fair.                         17    Accursed Charudatta, you shall not live! [_He takes a few steps._]    P. 107.11]    _Madanika._ [_Seizing the hem of his garment._] O you foolish man!  Your anger is so ridiculous.    _Sharvilaka._ Ridiculous? how so?    _Madanika._ Because these jewels belong to my mistress.    _Sharvilaka._ And what then?    _Madanika._ And she left them with that gentleman.    _Sharvilaka._ What for?    _Madanika._ [_Whispers._] That's why.    _Sharvilaka._ [_Sheepishly._] Confound it!        The sun was hot one summer day;      I sought the shadow, there to stay:      Poor fool! the kindly branch to pay,      I stole its sheltering leaves away.                          18    _Vasantasena._ How sorry he seems. Surely, he did this thing in  ignorance.    _Sharvilaka._ What is to be done now, Madanika?    _Madanika._ Your own wit should tell you that.    _Sharvilaka._ No. For you must remember,        Nature herself gives women wit;      Men learn from books a little bit.                           19    _Madanika._ Sharvilaka, if you will take my advice, restore the  jewels to that righteous man.    _Sharvilaka._ But Madanika, what if he should prosecute me?    _Madanika._ No cruel heat comes from the moon.    _Vasantasena._ Good, Madanika, good!    _Sharvilaka._ Madanika,        For what I did, I feel no grief nor fear:        Why tell me of this good man's virtues high?      Shame for my baseness touches me more near;        What can this king do to such rogues as I?                 20    Nevertheless, your suggestion is inconsistent with prudence. You  must discover some other plan.    [64.16. S.    _Madanika._ Yes, there is another plan.    _Vasantasena._ I wonder what it will be.    _Madanika._ Pretend to be a servant of that gentleman, and give  the jewels to my mistress.    _Sharvilaka._ And what then?    _Madanika._ Then you are no thief, Charudatta has discharged his  obligation, and my mistress has her jewels.    _Sharvilaka._ But isn't this course too reckless?    _Madanika._ I tell you, give them to her. Any other course is too  reckless.    _Vasantasena._ Good, Madanika, good! Spoken like a free woman.    _Sharvilaka._        Risen at last is wisdom's light.        Because I followed after you;      When clouds obscure the moon by night,        'Tis hard to find a guide so true.                         21    _Madanika._ Then you must wait here a moment in Kama's shrine,  while I tell my mistress that you have come.    _Sharvilaka._ I will.    _Madanika._ [_Approaches Vasantasena._] Mistress, a Brahman has  come from Charudatta to see you.    _Vasantasena._ But girl, how do you know that he comes from  Charudatta?    _Madanika._ Should I not know my own, mistress?    _Vasantasena._ [_Shaking her head and smiling. Aside._] Splendid!  [_Aloud._] Bid him enter.    _Madanika._ Yes, mistress. [_Approaching Sharvilaka._] Enter, Sharvilaka.    _Sharvilaka._ [_Approaches. With some embarrassment._] My greetings  to you.    P. 110.8]    _Vasantasena._ I salute you, sir. Pray be seated.    _Sharvilaka._ The merchant sends this message: \"My house is so  old that it is hard to keep this casket safe. Pray take it back.\"  [_He gives it to Madanika, and starts to leave._]    _Vasantasena._ Sir, will you undertake a return commission of mine?    _Sharvilaka._ [_Aside._] Who will carry it? [_Aloud._] And this commission  is--    _Vasantasena._ You will be good enough to accept Madanika.    _Sharvilaka._ Madam, I do not quite understand.    _Vasantasena._ But I do.    _Sharvilaka._ How so?    _Vasantasena._ Charudatta told me that I was to give Madanika to  the man who should return these jewels. You are therefore to  understand that he makes you a present of her.    _Sharvilaka._ [_Aside._] Ah, she sees through me. [_Aloud._] Good,  Charudatta, good!        On virtue only set your heart's desire;        The righteous poor attain to heights whereto      The wicked wealthy never may aspire.                         22    And again:        On virtue let the human heart be set;      To virtue nothing serves as check or let      The moon, attaining unattainable, is led      By virtue to her seat on Shiva's head.                       23    _Vasantasena._ Is my driver there? [_Enter a servant with a  bullock-cart._]    _Servant._ Mistress, the cart is ready.    _Vasantasena._ Madanika girl, you must show me a happy face.  You are free. Enter the bullock-cart. But do not forget me.    _Madanika._ [_Weeping._] My mistress drives me away. [_She falls at  her feet._]    _Vasantasena._ You are now the one to whom honor should be  paid.[52] Go then, enter the cart. But do not forget me.    [66.17. S.    _Sharvilaka._ Heaven bless you! and you, Madanika,        Turn upon her a happy face,      And hail with bended head the grace      That gives you now the name of wife.      As a veil to keep you safe through life.                     24    [_He enters the bullock-cart with Madanika, and starts away._]    _A voice behind the scenes._ Men! Men! We have the following  orders from the chief of police: \"A soothsayer has declared that  a young herdsman named Aryaka is to become king. Trusting to  this prophecy, and alarmed thereat, King Palaka has taken him  from his hamlet, and thrown him into strict confinement. Therefore  be watchful, and every man at his post.\"    _Sharvilaka._ [_Listening._] What! King Palaka has imprisoned my  good friend Aryaka? And here I am, a married man. Confound it!  But no,        Two things alone--his friend, his wife--        Deserve man's love below;      A hundred brides may forfeit life        Ere he should suffer so.                                   25    Good! I will get out [_He does so._]    _Madanika._ [_Folding her hands. Tearfully._] My lord, if you must,  at least bring me first to your parents.    _Sharvilaka._ Yes, my love. I will. I had the same thought in mind.  [_To the servant._] My good fellow, do you know the house of the  merchant Rebhila?    _Servant._ Certainly.    _Sharvilaka._ Bring my wife thither.    _Servant._ Yes, sir.    _Madanika_. If you desire it, dear. But dear, you must be very  careful.                                         [_Exit._    P. 113.6]    _Sharvilaka._ Now as for me,        I'll rouse my kin, the kitchen cabinet.        Those high in fame by strength of good right arm,      And those who with the king's contempt have met,        And royal slaves, to save my friend from harm:          Like old Yaugandharayana          For the good king Udayana.                               26    And again:        My friend has causeless been confined      By wicked foes of timid kind;      I fly, I fly to free him soon,      Like the eclipse-oppressed moon.                [_Exit._]    27    _Maid._ [_Entering._] Mistress, I congratulate you. A Brahman has  come with a message from Charudatta.    _Vasantasena._ Ah, this is a joyful day. Show him every mark of  respect, girl, and have him conducted hither by one of the pages.    _Maid._ Yes, mistress.                               [_Exit._           *       *       *       *       *    [_Enter Maitreya with a page._]    _Maitreya._ Well! Ravana, the king of the demons, travels with his  chariot that they call the \"Blossom.\" He earned it by his penances.  Now I am a Brahman, and though I never performed any penances,  I travel with another sort of a blossom--a woman of the town.    _Maid._ Sir, will you inspect our gateway.    _Maitreya._ [_Gazes admiringly._] It has just been sprinkled and  cleaned and received a coat of green. The threshold of it is pretty  as a picture with the offerings of all sorts of fragrant flowers. It  stretches up its head as if it wanted to peep into the sky. It is  adorned with strings of jasmine garlands that hang down and toss  about like the trunk of the heavenly elephant. It shines with its  high ivory portal. It is lovely with any number of holiday banners  that gleam red as great rubies and wave their coquettish fingers as  they flutter in the breeze and seem to invite me to enter.

But then I was jealous.  There was no more Cicero for Charlie that day.  He was almost as ridiculous, though not so rough, with his new treasure  as he had been with me.  He turned me out of my pocket to make room for  it; and then half a dozen times a minute pulled it out and gloated over  it.  At night he put us both under his pillow, little dreaming of the  sorrow and disappointment that filled my breast.    Where were all the old days now?  Who would admire or value _me_, a  poor, commonplace silver drudge, now that this grand, showy rival had  come and taken my place?  In my anger and excitement my heart beat fast  and loud, so loud that presently I heard a voice beside me saying,--    \"Gently, there, if you please; no one can hear himself speak with that  noise.\"    \"I've more right to be here than you,\" I growled.    \"That is as our mutual master decides; but surely I have heard your  voice before!  Let me look at you.\"    And he edged himself up, so as to get a peep at my shabby face.    \"To be sure--my young friend the three-guinea silver watch?  How do you  do, my little man?\"    This patronage was intolerable, and I had no words to reply.    \"Ah! you find it difficult to converse.  You must indeed be almost worn  out after the work you have had.  I am indeed astonished to see you  alive at all.  I am sure, in my master's name, I may be allowed to thank  you for your praiseworthy exertions in his service.  We are both much  obliged to you, and hope we shall show ourselves not unmindful of  your--\"    \"Brute!\" was all I could shriek, so mad was I, Whether my rival would  have pursued his discourse I cannot say, but at that instant a hand came  fumbling under the pillow.  It passed me by, and sought the repeater,  and next moment the tinkling chimes sounded half-past eleven.    It was as much as I could endure to be thus slighted and triumphed over.    \"Contemptible creature!\"  I exclaimed; \"you may think you've a fine  voice, but, like a simpering schoolgirl, you can't sing till you're  pressed!\"  I had him there, surely!    \"Better that than having no voice at all, like some people, or using it  when no one wants to hear it, like others.\"  I suppose he thought he had  me there, the puppy!    He went on chiming at intervals during the night, and of course my  master had very little rest in consequence.    The next day Charlie and Jim had a solemn confabulation as to the  disposal of me.    \"It's no use wasting it, you know,\" said Jim.  \"Pity you haven't got a  young brother to pass it on to.\"    \"Suppose you take it,\" said the generous Charlie.    \"No, old man, I don't want it.  I'm not so mad about tickers as you.  But, I tell you what, Charlie, you might like Tom to have it.  He's  leaving, you know, and it would be a nice reminder of Randlebury.\"    \"Just what I thought directly the new one came,\" exclaimed Charlie,  \"only then I remembered we had a row about this very watch three years  ago, and I'm afraid he wouldn't like it.\"    \"Try.  Old Tom would be quite set up with a watch.\"    Charlie proceeded that same day in quest of Tom, whom he found packing  up his books and chemicals in a large trunk.    To him my master exhibited his new treasure, greatly to Drift's delight.    \"Why, Charlie,\" he said, \"I don't know much about watches, but I'm  certain that's worth twenty pounds.\"    \"No!\" exclaimed Charlie; \"you don't mean that.\"    \"Yes, I do; but, for all that, I'll back your old turnip to keep as good  time as it.\"    \"It's always gone well, the old one.  I'm glad you like it, Tom.\"    \"I always liked it, you know.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Well, I've known it as long as I've known you, and if it hadn't been  for it things might have been different.\"    \"Yes,\" said Charlie, \"it was the cause of all the row three years ago.\"    \"And if it hadn't been for that row I should have gone to the bad long  ago.  That was a lucky row for me, Charlie, thanks to you.\"    \"Don't say that, old man, because it's a cram.\"    \"I say, Tom,\" added Charlie nervously, coming to his point, \"will you do  me a favour?\"    \"Anything in the world.  What is it?\"    \"Take my old watch, Tom.  It's not worth much, you know, but it may be  useful, and it will help to remind you of old days.  Will you, Tom?\"    Tom's lips quivered as he took me from Charlie's outstretched hand.    \"Old boy,\" said he, \"I'd sooner have this than anything else in the  world.  Somehow I feel I can't go wrong as long as I have it.\"    Charlie was beyond measure delighted to find his present accepted with  so little difficulty.    \"Oh, Tom,\" he said, \"I am glad to think you'll have it, and I know  you'll think of me when you use it.\"    \"Won't I?\" said Tom.  \"I say, Charlie, I wish you were coming to London  with me.\"    \"So do I.  Never mind, we'll often write, and you'll promise to let me  know how you are getting on, won't you?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And you'll call and see my father pretty often, won't you?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And you'll keep yourself free for a week's jaunt at Easter?\"    \"Yes.\"    They had much more talk that evening, which lasted till late.  What they  talked about it is not for me to repeat, and if it were it would  probably not interest my reader.  He would perhaps be disappointed to  find that a considerable part of it related to a new suit of Tom's, just  arrived from the tailor's, and that another part had reference to Tom's  intention to prevail on his landlady in London to allow him to support a  bull-dog puppy on her premises.  These subjects, deeply interesting to  the two friends, would not improve with repetition; and neither would  the rest of their talk, which was chiefly a going over of old times, and  a laying of many a wondrous scheme for the future.  Suffice it to say,  on this last evening the two boys unbosomed themselves to one another,  and if Tom Drift went off to bed in a sober and serious frame of mind,  it was because he and Charlie both had thought and felt a great deal  more than they had spoken during the interview.  The packing went on at  the same time as the talk, and then the two friends separated, only to  meet once more on the morrow for a hurried farewell.    \"Let's have a last look at him,\" said Charlie, as Tom was getting into  the cab to go.    Tom took me out and handed me to him.  Long and tenderly my dear young  master looked at me, then, patting me gently with his hand as if I were  a child, he said,--    \"Good-bye, and be good to Tom Drift; do you hear?\"    If a tick could express anything, my reply at that moment must have  satisfied him his parting wish would not be forgotten.  Then returning  me to my new master, he said,--    \"Good-bye, old boy; joy go with you.  We'll hear of you at the head of  your profession before Jim and I have left school.\"    \"Not quite so soon,\" replied Tom, laughing.    Then came a last good-bye, and the cab drove off.  As it turned the  corner of the drive Tom leaned out of the window and held me out in his  hand.    Long shall I remember that parting glimpse.  He was standing on the  steps with Jim waving his hands.  The sun shone full on him, lighting up  his bright face and curly head.  I thought as I looked, \"Where could one  find his equal?\"--_Sans peur et sans reproche_--\"matchless for  gentleness, honesty, and courage,\" and felt, as the vision faded from  me, that I should never see another like him.  And I never did.    Little, however, did I dream in what strange way I was next to meet  Charlie Newcome.        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    HOW TOM DRIFT MADE ONE START IN LONDON, AND PREPARED TO MAKE ANOTHER.    The two months that followed my departure from Randlebury were  melancholy and tedious.    It was hard for me, after the boisterous surroundings of a public  school, to settle down to the heavy monotony of a dull lodging in a back  street of London; and it was harder still, after being the pride and  favourite of a boy like Charlie Newcome, to find myself the property of  Tom Drift.    Not that Tom used me badly at first.  He wound me up regularly, and for  the sake of his absent friend honoured me with a considerable share of  his affection.    Indeed, for the first week or so he was quite gushing, scarcely letting  me out of his sight, and sometimes even dropping a tear over me.  And I,  remembering Charlie's last words, \"Be good to Tom Drift,\" felt glad to  be able to remind my new master of old times, and keep fresh the hopes  and resolutions with which Charlie had done so much to inspire him.  But  Tom Drift, I could not help feeling, was not a safe man.    There was something lacking in him, and that something was ballast.  No  one, perhaps, ever had a greater theoretical desire to be all that was  right and good, but that was not in itself enough.    In quiet, easy times, and with a guiding friend to help him, Tom Drift  did well enough; but left to himself amid currents and storms he could  hardly fail to come to grief, as we shall presently see.    For the first two months he stuck hard to his work he was regular at  lectures, and attentive when there; he spent his spare time well in  study bearing upon the profession for which he was preparing; he wrote  and heard once a week from Charlie; he kept clear of the more rackety of  his fellow-students; he spent his Sundays at Mr Newcome's house, and he  took plenty of healthy exercise both for body and mind.    With many examples about him of industry and success he determined to  make the most of his time as a student, and spoke of the life and sphere  of a country doctor, for which he was training, with the enthusiasm of  one whose heart is in his work.    \"The more I think of it,\" he once wrote to his mother, who was residing  abroad for her health, \"the more I take to it.  A good doctor is the  best-liked man in his parish.  Everybody comes to him in their"]]]
