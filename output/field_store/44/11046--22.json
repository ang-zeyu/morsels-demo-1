Expenditures for power transmission and distribution facilities by the  Bonneville Power Administration are expected to increase from 12 million  dollars in the fiscal year 1946 to 15 million dollars in the next fiscal  year. In addition, the Southwestern Power Administration will undertake a  new program involving expenditures of about 16 million dollars in the  fiscal year 1947. The Rural Electrification Administration will require  expenditures during the current fiscal year estimated at 156 million  dollars; in the fiscal year 1947, at 241 million dollars.    The TVA program includes completion of major multiple-purpose  projects--navigation, flood control, and power facilities--and additions to  chemical plants and related facilities. Expenditures for these capital  improvement programs are estimated at 30 million dollars in the fiscal year  1946 and 39 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947.    Expenditures for construction of roads and other developmental works in the  national forests, parks, and other public lands, and for capital outlays  for fish and wildlife development will increase from below 9 million  dollars in the fiscal year 1946 to 24 million dollars in the fiscal year  1947.    6. SOCIAL SECURITY AND HEALTH    Benefit payments out of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust fund  during 1947 are estimated at 407 million dollars, while withdrawals by the  States from the Unemployment Trust fund for compensation payments are  expected to total 1 billion dollars. These disbursements are financed out  of social security contributions.    The appropriations from general and special accounts for the social  security program, which cover Federal administrative expenses and grants to  States for assistance programs, are estimated at 593 million dollars for  the fiscal year 1947, an increase of 57 million dollars over the current  year. The increase anticipates greater administrative workload and higher  grants to match increasing State payments. The social security program does  not include all the Federal health services under existing legislation. For  the other health services classified under general government and national  defense, appropriations are estimated at 102 million dollars for the fiscal  year 1947.    Some expansion in peacetime medical research and other programs of the  Public Health Service is provided for in the appropriation estimates for  these purposes totaling approximately 87 million dollars for the fiscal  year 1947 which are submitted under provisions of existing law. Part of  this will be provided through the social security appropriations, the  remainder through other appropriations. About 28 million dollars is  recommended for maternity care and health services for children under  existing law, mainly under the emergency provision for the wives and  infants of servicemen. While we should avoid duplication of maternity and  child health services which will be provided through the proposed general  system of prepaid medical care, legislation is needed to supplement such  services. For medical education, I have recommended legislation authorizing  grants-in-aid to public and nonprofit institutions. The existing sources of  support for medical schools require supplementation to sustain the  expansion that is needed.    Hospitals, sanitation works, and additional facilities at medical schools  will be required for an adequate national health program. Legislation is  now pending in the Congress to authorize grants for the construction of  hospitals and health centers and grants and loans for water-pollution  control. I hope the Congress will act favorably on generous authorizing  legislation.    7. RESEARCH AND EDUCATION    The Budget provides for continuation and desirable expansion of the  research activities that are carried on throughout the Federal  establishment and through previously authorized grants to the States.  Additional appropriations will be required for the proposed central Federal  research agency which I recommended last September 6. That agency will  coordinate existing research activities and administer funds for new  research activities wherever they are needed; it will not itself conduct  research. The plan contemplates expenditures through the new research  agency of approximately 40 million dollars for the first year.    These amounts are small in relation to the important contribution they can  make to the national income, the welfare of our people, and the common  defense. Expenditures must be limited for the time being by the capacity of  research agencies to make wise use of funds. The maintenance of our  position as a nation, however, will require more emphasis on research  expenditures in the future than in the past.    Educational expenditures will require a significant share of the national  income in the fiscal year 1947. State, local, and private expenditures for  the current support of elementary, secondary, and higher education are  expected to be substantially above 3 billion dollars in that year. These  nonfederal expenditures will be supplemented by Federal expenditures  estimated at 625 million dollars in the present Budget. Of this amount, the  estimate for veterans' education, as previously mentioned, is 535 million  dollars. Other amounts include 21 million dollars for the support of  vocational education in public schools, 5 million dollars for the  land-grant colleges, 50 million dollars for the present school-lunch and  milk program, 1 million dollars for the Office of Education, and  approximately 13 million dollars for various other items. In view of the  major policy issues which are still under study by the Congress and the  Administration, no specific amount has been determined for the Federal  grants, previously recommended in this Message, which would assist the  States generally in assuring more nearly equal opportunities for a good  education.    Notwithstanding the urgent need for additional school and college  buildings, careful planning will be required for the expenditures to be  made under the proposed legislation to aid the States in providing  educational facilities. A major share of the grants for the first year  would be for surveys and plans.    I have already outlined the broad objectives of our foreign economic  policy. In the present section I shall indicate the Federal outlays which  the execution of these programs may require in the fiscal years 1946 and  1947.    (a) On the termination of lend-lease, the lend-lease countries were  required to pay for goods in the lend-lease pipe line either in cash or by  borrowing from the United States or by supplying goods and services to the  United States. Credits for this purpose have already been extended to  Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium amounting to 675 million  dollars. The settlement credit of 650 million dollars to the United Kingdom  includes an amount preliminarily fixed at 118 million dollars which  represents the excess of purchases by the United Kingdom from the pipe line  over goods and services supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States  since VJ-day and the balance of various claims by one government against  the other.    Credits are also being negotiated with lend-lease countries to finance the  disposition of lend-lease inventories and installations and property  declared to be surplus. For instance, 532 million dollars of the settlement  credit to the United Kingdom is for this purpose. These credits will  involve no new expenditures by this Government, since they merely provide  for deferred repayment by other governments for good: services which have  been financed from war appropriations.    (b) Expenditures from the appropriations to United Nations Relief and  Rehabilitation Administration, which were discarded under war expenditures  above, are estimated to be 1.3 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1946 and  1.2 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1947.    (c) To assist other countries in the restoration of their economies the  Export-Import Bank has already negotiated loans in the fiscal year 1946  amounting in total to about 1,010 million dollars and an additional 195  million dollars will probably be committed shortly. The Bank is also  granting loans to carry out its original purpose of directly expanding the  foreign trade of the United States. In this connection the Bank has  established a fund of 100 million dollars to finance the export of cotton  from the United States. The Export-Import Bank has thus loaned or committed  approximately 1,300 million dollars during the current fiscal year and it  is expected that demands on its resources will increase in the last 6  months of the fiscal year 1946. Requests for loans are constantly being  received by the Bank from countries desiring to secure goods and services  in this country for the reconstruction or development of their economies.  On July 31, 1945, the lending authority of the Expert-Import Bank was  increased to a total of 3,500 million dollars. I anticipate that during the  period covered by this Budget the Bank will reach this limit. The bulk of  the expenditures from the loans already granted will fall in the fiscal  year 1946 while the bulk of the expenditures from loans yet to be  negotiated will fall in the fiscal year 1947. In view of the urgent need  for the Bank's credit, I may find it necessary to request a further  increase in its lending authority at a later date.    (d) The proposed line of credit of 3,750 million dollars to the United  Kingdom will be available up to the end of 1951 and will be used to assist  the United Kingdom in financing the deficit in its balance of payments  during the transition period. The rate at which the United Kingdom will  draw on the credit will depend on the rapidity with which it can reconvert  its economy and adapt its trade to the postwar"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50535"],[0,"Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural Marriage: A Discussion (#17)"],[1," May, 1843, by Elder William Clayton. The Prophet was then living with  his first wife, Emma Smith, and I know that she gave her consent to the  marriage of at least four women to her husband as plural wives, and she  was well aware that he associated and cohabited with them as wives. The  names of these women are Eliza and Emily Partridge, and Maria and Sarah  Lawrence, all of whom knew that I too was his wife.    When the Prophet Joseph Smith mentioned the principle of plural  marriage to me I felt indignant, and so expressed myself to him,  because my feelings and education were averse to anything of that  nature. But he assured me that this doctrine had been revealed to him  of the Lord, and that I was entitled to receive a testimony of its  divine origin for myself. He counseled me to pray to the Lord, which  I did, and thereupon received from Him a powerful and irresistible  testimony of the truthfulness and divinity of plural marriage, which  testimony has abided with me ever since.    On the 8th day of February, 1845, I was married for _time_ to President  Heber C. Kimball, and bore to him nine children. And in this connection  allow me to say to his everlasting credit that during the whole of my  married life with him he never failed to regard me as the wife for  eternity of his devoted friend, the Prophet Joseph Smith.

AFFIDAVIT OF CATHERINE PHILLIPS SMITH    United States of America,    State of Utah.    County of Salt Lake.    Catherine Phillips Smith,[2] being first sworn, says:    I am the daughter of Thomas Denner and Sarah Godshall Phillips, and  was born in Philadelphia, State of Pennsylvania, on the first day of  August, 1819. My present residence is East Jordan, Salt Lake County,  Utah.    I was married to Hyrum Smith, brother of the Prophet Joseph Smith,  as his plural wife, and lived with him as his wife. The sealing was  performed by the Prophet Joseph Smith himself, in Nauvoo, State of  Illinois, in August, 1843, in the brick office belonging to my husband,  and occupied at the time as a dwelling by Brother and Sister Robert  and Julia Stone, and was witnessed by my mother, Sister Stone and her  daughter Hettie.    In consequence of the strong feeling manifested at the time against  plural marriage and those suspected of having entered into it, I, with  my mother, moved to St. Louis near the close of the year, where I was  living when the Prophet Joseph and my husband were martyred.    The purpose of this affidavit is that my testimony to the truthfulness  and divinity of plural marriage may live after I shall have passed  away; and in this spirit I commend it to all to whom it may come.                                             Catherine Phillips Smith.    Subscribed and sworn to before me, this 28th day of January, 1903.    [Seal]                                          L. John Nuttall, Notary Public.      AFFIDAVIT OF ALMIRA W. JOHNSON SMITH BARTON    Territory of Utah, County of Iron. ss.    Be it remembered on this first day of August A.D. 1883, personally  appeared before me John W. Brown a notary public in and for said  county, Almira W. Johnson Smith Barton, who was by me sworn in due  form of law, and upon her oath says: I am a citizen in the Territory  of Utah, over the age of twenty-one years, and I am the daughter of  Ezekiel Johnson and Julia Hills Johnson his wife; that I was born at  Westford, in the State of Vermont on the 22nd day of October A.D. 1813;  that I had nine brothers who were named respectfully Joel H., Seth,  David, Benjamin F., Joseph E., Elmer, George W., William D., and Amos;  and six sisters named respectfully Nancy, Dulcena, Julia, Susan, Mary  and Esther, all of whom, with myself, were baptized into the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with the exception of Elmer, who died  in infancy.    Deponent further says, that in the years 1842 and 1843, I resided most  of the time at Macedonia, in the County of Hancock, State of Illinois,  sometimes with my sister who was the wife of Almon W. Babbitt, and  sometimes with my brother Benjamin F. Johnson. During that time the  Prophet Joseph Smith taught me the principle of celestial marriage  including plurality of wives and asked me to become his wife. He first  spoke to me on this subject at the house of my brother Benjamin F. I  also lived a portion of the time at Brother Joseph Smith's in Nauvoo,  when many conversations passed between him and myself on this subject.  On a certain occasion in the spring of the year 1843, the exact date of  which I do not now recollect, I went from Macedonia to Nauvoo to visit  another of my sisters, the one who was the widow of Lyman R. Sherman,  deceased, at which time I was sealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith. At  the time this took place Hyrum Smith, Joseph's brother, came to me and  said I need not be afraid. I had been fearing and doubting about the  principle and so had he, but he now knew it was true. After this time  I lived with the Prophet Joseph as his wife, and he visited me at the  home of my brother Benjamin F. at Macedonia.    Deponent further says that I had many conversations with Eliza Beaman  who was also a wife of Joseph Smith, and who was present when I was  sealed to him, on the subject of plurality of wives, both before and  after the performance of that ceremony. And also that since the death  of the Prophet Joseph Smith I was married for time to Reuben Barton of  Nauvoo, Hancock Co., Ill., by whom I have had five daughters, one only  of whom is now living.
