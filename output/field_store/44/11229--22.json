Military law has been proclaimed. Any hour may bring    with it the outbreak of the world war. Thereby the severest trials    will be imposed upon, not only our nation, but upon the whole of our    continent.      \"Up till the last minute the internationalists have done their duty,    and on the other side of our frontiers every nerve is being strained    to preserve peace and to make war impossible.      \"If our earnest protests, our repeated endeavours have been without    success, it is because the conditions under which we live have once    again proved stronger than our will, and the will of our workmen    brothers. Hence, whatever comes, we must now face it with firmness.      \"The horrible self-laceration of the European peoples, is the cruel    confirmation of our warnings to the ruling classes for more than a    generation; we have spoken admonishingly and in vain.      \"_Parteigenossen_ (comrades), we shall not live through coming events    in fatalistic indifference; we shall remain true to our cause; we    shall hold firmly together, permeated by the sublime greatness of our    cultural mission.      \"The women, on whom the burden of events presses two and threefold,    have above all, in these serious times, the task of working in the    spirit of Socialism for the high ideals of humanity, so that a    repetition of this dreadful catastrophe may be averted, and this war    may be the last.      \"The stern regulations of martial law strike the workmen's movement    with terrible force. Imprudent actions, useless and falsely-conceived    sacrifices, damage in this moment not only the individual, but also    our cause.      \"Comrades, we appeal to you to persevere in the unshakable confidence    that the future belongs, in spite of all, to nation-binding Socialism,    to justice and humanity.          \"DER PARTEIVORSTAND.        (The leaders of the party.)      \"Berlin, July 3ist, 1914.\"    With these words, millions of German Socialists, represented by four and  a quarter million voters and a hundred and eleven members of the  Reichstag, tacitly denied their previous protestations, that Austrian  Imperialism was letting loose the war-fury on Europe. There are rumours  of a secret consultation with the German Chancellor, but that is of  little import in this place. The leaders of this huge party proclaimed  on July 25th that Austria was the blood-guilty power and maintained this  attitude in spite of bloodshed till 11 p.m. on July 28th. By what  lightning-change Austria's original guilt was transferred to Russia by  July 31st is not recorded.    With regard to the text of the above proclamation, there are variations  to be noted. In the _Vorwaerts_ it runs \"within and without our  frontiers\" in the second paragraph; the text as I have given it is taken  from the _Leipziger Volkszeitung_. In the fifth paragraph the Nuremberg  _Fraenkische Tagespost_ gives \"capitalistic\" for \"fatalistic.\"    A few extracts from Socialist newspapers will suffice to illustrate the  complete change of front which happened in three days:    \"We Social Democrats in this solemn hour are at one with the whole  German nation, without distinction of party or creed, in accepting the  fight forced upon us by Russian barbarism, and we are ready to fight  till the last drop of blood for Germany's national independence, fame  and greatness.\" _Der Folksfreund_ (Karlsruhe), August 1st.    \"We desired peace and we have done everything humanly possible to secure  that end. But when war is forced upon us by Russian Czarism, then,  whatever the final decision may be, we must drop all class distinctions  and differences of every kind, to form a single, determined people,  prepared to defend Germany's independence and greatness against the  enemy--even to the last drop of blood.\" _Volksstimme_ (Mannheim), July  31st.    \"A defeat would mean collapse, annihilation and horrors most dreadful  for all of us.[72] Our imaginations revolt at such a possibility. Our  representatives in the Reichstag have unanimously declared on  innumerable occasions that the Social Democrats could not leave their  Fatherland in the lurch when the hour of destiny strikes; the workmen  will now redeem the promise given by their representatives. The  'Fatherlandless fellows'[73] will do their duty, and in doing it, will  allow themselves to be surpassed in no wise by the patriots,\" _Muenchener  Post_, August 1st.    [Footnote 72: These sentiments did not occur to this journalist when  Germany began a ruthless war of invasion on Belgium.--Author.]    [Footnote 73: A phrase of contempt employed by the Kaiser when speaking  of the Social Democrats in 1889, and which became proverbial.]    \"Whatever our opponents have done to us, at this moment we all feel the  duty to fight against Russian knout-rule. Our women and children shall  not be sacrificed to Russian bestiality, nor the German people become a  booty for the Cossacks.\" _Die Volksstimme_ (Chemnitz), August 2nd.    It is possible that even at the end of the war no explanation will be  forthcoming for this astounding change of attitude. Some have suggested  that the Russian or Slavonic danger caused it. Yet just these journals,  and this party, had maintained, so long as any degree of free speech was  permitted, that Austria had provoked the danger, and they were fully  aware that the German Government had from first to last approved of and  openly assisted in provoking, nay challenging, Russia on a question  which involved the latter's prestige and diplomatic existence.    Bethmann-Hollweg gave the alleged Russian mobilization as the immediate  cause of the war, but doubtless the Social Democrats knew full well that  for several days before Russia's mobilization was announced, Germany had  been secretly mobilizing her army. From July 26th till July 30th German  papers contained many reports that Russia was mobilizing; they may have  been true or not, but the diplomatic correspondence published by Austria  and discussed on page 63 shows conclusively that the Central Powers were  baiting Russia into taking that step, and when the greatest Slavonic  power had made the desired move, Germany replied with an ultimatum which  brought about the war, so ardently desired by the great majority of  Germany's warlike tribes.    Britishers who sympathize with German Social Democracy may advance the  plea: If Germany's military preparations were secret, how could the  Social Democrats know of these proceedings? The answer is direct and  simple: Every individual Social Democrat--and men, women, and children,  they number some twenty millions--has for years past been a spy and  informer in the interests of the _Umsturzpartei_ (overthrow-party). All  the happenings of the workshop, barracks, farmyard, shop and office have  been systematically reported to the local Press, and local committees of  the Democratic Party; the ammunitions thus obtained have been just as  systematically employed to fire insidious paragraphs and Press articles  at governments, local authorities, employers, officers, and even the  employers of servant-girls. Of late years it has been dangerous to have  a difference even with a maid-servant; a few days later the inevitable  insidious, anonymous attack would certainly appear in one or other of  the S.D. journals.    One instance will suffice to illustrate the everyday routine of the  class-war (_Klassenkampf_) in which the whole energies of the Social  Democrats have been absorbed for a quarter of a century. An acquaintance  of the author's, Major Schub, in the 19th Infantry Regiment, stationed  in Erlangen, dared some years ago to send his orderly with a she-goat to  a peasant in the district who kept the indispensable he-goat. Two days  later he was pilloried in a Furth paper for calling upon a private  soldier to fulfil such a degrading office. German workmen do not read  the _Vorwaerts_ (its circulation is well under 100,000), but they read  one or other of the seventy purveyors of filth and class hatred which  form the stock-in-trade of the Social Democratic Party.    The author of this work, knew as early as July 25th, that reserve  officers had been warned to hold themselves in readiness; on succeeding  days he saw tangible evidence that mobilization was proceeding  stealthily, and it would be ridiculous for him to claim greater  knowledge than the hundred and eleven S.D. members of the Reichstag, and  the seventy-seven editors of their party papers--especially when these  have an army of millions of spies at their command.    In order to obtain a correct judgment of the motives which actuated  German Social Democrats in their complete support of the German  Government it is necessary to consult the works published by them during  the war. Karl Kautsky writes:[74] \"That which under these circumstances,  was most immediate and pressing in determining the attitude to war, not  only for the masses, but also many of our leaders, was the fear of a  hostile invasion, the urgent necessity to keep the enemy out of our  territory, no matter what the causes, object or results of the war may  be. This fear was never greater and more justified than on this  occasion; never have the devastating results of invasion been more  terrible. Belgium and East Prussia speak plainly.    [Footnote 74: \"Die Internationalitaet und der Krieg.\" Berlin, 1915; p.  32.]    \"The increased size of the armies greatly extends the unavoidable  desolation of war, and in addition to this a second strongly-working  popular motive decides the attitude of a nation to war, viz., the  interest of the entire people in the fate of an army in which every  family is represented.\"    It thus becomes evident that no motives of justice, right or wrong, or  politics played any part in the decision arrived at, but merely a great  fear which impelled the Social Democrats to consider first and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10201"],[0,"The Desert of Wheat (#18)"],[1,". Hall preferred to  sit outdoors on the porch. He threw off hat and coat, and, taking an  easy chair, he produced some cigars.    \"Will you smoke?\" he asked, offering one.    Kurt declined with thanks. He was aware of this man's penetrating, yet  kindly scrutiny of him, and he had begun to wonder. This was no ordinary  visitor.    \"Have you been drafted?\" abruptly queried Mr. Hall.    \"Yes, sir. Mine was the first number,\" replied Kurt, with a little  pride.    \"Do you want exemption?\" swiftly came the second query.    It shocked Dorn, then stung him.    \"No,\" he said, forcibly.    \"Your father's sympathy is with Germany, I understand.\"    \"Well, sir, I don't know how you understand that, but it's true--to my  regret and shame.\"    \"You want to fight?\" went on the official.    \"I hate the idea of war. But I--I guess I want to fight. Maybe that's  because I'm feeling scrappy over these I.W.W. tricks.\"    \"Dorn, the I.W.W. is only one of the many phases of war that we must  meet,\" returned Mr. Hall, and then for a moment he thoughtfully drew  upon his cigar.    \"Young man, I like your talk. And I'll tell you a secret. My name's not  Hall. Never mind my name. For you it's Uncle Sam!\"    Whereupon, with a winning and fascinating manner that seemed to Kurt at  once intimate and flattering, he began to talk fluently of the meaning  of his visit, and of its cardinal importance. The government was looking  far ahead, preparing for a tremendous, and perhaps a lengthy, war. The  food of the country must be conserved. Wheat was one of the most vital  things in the whole world, and the wheat of America was incalculably  precious--only the government knew how precious. If the war was short a  wheat famine would come afterward; if it was long, the famine would come  before the war ended. But it was inevitable. The very outcome of the war  itself depended upon wheat.    The government expected a nation-wide propaganda by the German interests  which would be carried on secretly and boldly, in every conceivable way,  to alienate the labor organizations, to bribe or menace the harvesters,  to despoil crops, and particularly to put obstacles in the way of the  raising and harvesting, the transporting and storing of wheat. It would  take an army to protect the nation's grain.    Dorn was earnestly besought by this official to compass his district, to  find out who could be depended upon by the United States and who was  antagonistic, to impress upon the minds of all his neighbors the  exceeding need of greater and more persistent cultivation of wheat.    \"I accept. I'll do my best,\" replied Kurt, grimly. \"I'll be going some  the next two weeks.\"    \"It's deplorable that most of the wheat in this section is a failure,\"  said the official. \"But we must make up for that next year. I see you  have one magnificent wheat-field. But, fact is, I heard of that long  before I got here.\"    \"Yes? Where?\" ejaculated Kurt, quick to catch a significance in the  other's words.    \"I've motored direct from Wheatly. And I'm sorry to say that what I have  now to tell you is not pleasant.... Your father sold this wheat for  eighty thousand dollars in cash. The money was seen to be paid over by a  mill-operator of Spokane.... And your father is reported to be  suspiciously interested in the I.W.W. men now at Wheatly.\"    \"Oh, that's awful!\" exclaimed Kurt, with a groan. \"How did you learn  that?\"    \"From American farmers--men that I had been instructed to approach, the  same as in your case. The information came quite by accident, however,  and through my inquiring about the I.W.W.\"    \"Father has not been rational since the President declared war. He's  very old. I've had trouble with him. He might do anything.\"    \"My boy, there are multitudes of irrational men nowadays and the number  is growing.... I advise you to go at once to Wheatly and bring your  father home. It was openly said that he was taking risks with that large  sum of money.\"    \"Risks! Why, I can't understand that. The wheat's not harvested yet, let  alone hauled to town. And to-day I learned the I.W.W. are working a  trick with cakes of phosphorus, to burn the wheat.\"    Kurt produced the cake of phosphorus and explained its significance to  the curious official.    \"Cunning devils! Who but a German would ever have thought of that?\" he  exclaimed. \"German science! To such ends the Germans put their supreme  knowledge!\"    \"I wonder what my father will say about this phosphorus trick. I just  wonder. He loves the wheat. His wheat has taken prizes at three world's  fairs. Maybe to see our wheat burn would untwist that twist in his brain  and make him American.\"    \"I doubt it. Only death changes the state of a real German, physical,  moral, and spiritual. Come, ride back to Glencoe with me. I'll drop you  there. You can hire a car and make Wheatly before dark.\"    Kurt ran indoors, thinking hard as he changed clothes. He told the  housekeeper to tell Jerry he was called away and would be back next day.  Putting money and a revolver in his pocket, he started out, but  hesitated and halted. He happened to think that he was a poor shot with  a revolver and a fine one with a rifle. So he went back for his rifle, a  small high-power, repeating gun that he could take apart and hide under  his coat. When he reached the porch the official glanced from the weapon  to Kurt's face and said, with a flash of spirit:    \"It appears that you are in earnest!\"    \"I am. Something told me to take this,\" responded Kurt, as he dismounted  the rifle. \"I've already had one run-in with an I.W.W. I know tough  customers when I see them. These foreigners are the kind I don't want  near me. And if I see one trying to fire the wheat I'll shoot his leg  off.\"    \"I'm inclined to think that Uncle Sam would not deplore your shooting a  little higher.... Dorn, you're fine! You're all I heard you were! Shake  hands!\"    Kurt tingled all over as he followed the official out to the car and  took the seat given him beside the driver. \"Back to Glencoe,\" was the  order. And then, even if conversation had been in order, it would  scarcely have been possible. That driver could drive! He had no fear and  he knew his car. Kurt could drive himself, but he thought that if he had  been as good as this fellow he would have chosen one of two magnificent  services for the army--an ambulance-driver at the front or an aeroplane  scout.    On the way to Glencoe several squads of idling and marching men were  passed, all of whom bore the earmarks of the I.W.W. Sight of them made  Kurt hug his gun and wonder at himself. Never had he been a coward, but  neither had he been one to seek a fight. This suave, distinguished  government official, by his own significant metaphor, Uncle Sam gone  abroad to find true hearts, had wrought powerfully upon Kurt's temper.  He sensed events. He revolved in mind the need for him to be cool and  decisive when facing the circumstances that were sure to arise.    At Glencoe, which was reached so speedily that Kurt could scarcely  credit his eyes, the official said; \"You'll hear from me. Good-by and  good luck!\"    Kurt hired a young man he knew to drive him over to Wheatly. All the way  Kurt brooded about his father's strange action. The old man had left  home before the rain-storm. How did he know he could guarantee so many  bushels of wheat as the selling-price indicated? Kurt divined that his  father had acted upon one of his strange weather prophecies. For he must  have been absolutely sure of rain to save the wheat.    Darkness had settled down when Kurt reached Wheatly and left the car at  the railroad station. Wheatly was a fairly good-sized little town. There  seemed to be an unusual number of men on the dark streets. Dim lights  showed here and there. Kurt passed several times near groups of  conversing men, but he did not hear any significant talk.    Most of the stores were open and well filled with men, but to Kurt's  sharp eyes there appeared to be much more gossip going on than business.  The town was not as slow and quiet as was usual with Bend towns. He  listened for war talk, and heard none. Two out of every three men who  spoke in his hearing did not use the English language. Kurt went into  the office of the first hotel he found. There was no one present. He  glanced at an old register lying on the desk. No guests had registered  for several days.    Then Kurt went out and accosted a man leaning against a hitching-rail.    \"What's going on in this town?\"    The man stood rather indistinctly in the uncertain light. Kurt, however,  made out his eyes and they were regarding him suspiciously.    \"Nothin' onusual,\" was the reply.    \"Has harvesting begun in these parts?\"    \"Some barley cut, but no wheat. Next week, I reckon.\"    \"How's the wheat?\"    \"Some bad an' some good.\"    \"Is this town a headquarters for the I.W.W.?\"    \"No. But there's a big camp of I.W.W.'s near here. Reckon you're one of  them union fellers?\"    \"I am not,\" declared Kurt, bluntly.    \"Reckon you sure look like one, with thet gun under your coat.\"    \"Are you going to hire I.W.W. men?\" asked Kurt, ignoring the other's  observation.    \"I'm only a farm-hand,\" was the sullen reply. \"An' I tell you I won't  join no I.W.W.\"    Kurt spared himself a moment to give this fellow a few strong proofs of  the fact that any farm-hand was wise to take such a stand against the  labor organization. Leaving the fellow gaping and staring after him,  Kurt crossed the street to enter another hotel. It was more pretentious  than the first, with a large, well lighted office. There were loungers  at the tables. Kurt walked to the desk. A man leaned upon his elbows. He  asked Kurt if he wanted a room. This man, evidently the proprietor, was  a German, though he spoke English.    \"I'm not sure,\" replied Kurt. \"Will you let me look at the register?\"    The man shoved the book around. Kurt did not find the name he sought.    \"My"]]]
