The  circumference of a circle is approximately 3.1416 times the diameter  because he made it so. The wonderful calculations by logarithms,  whether by the common system with a base of 10, or the Napierian  system with a base of 2.718+ a decimal that never terminates, are  possible and reliable only because God made them so.  Think what great  intelligence is required by the Napierian system, to raise a decimal  that never terminates, to a decimal power that never terminates, in  order to produce an integral number. Yet God has computed  instantaneously every table of logarithms, and every other  mathematical table,--no matter how difficult. Thus we have positive  proof of the presence everywhere of a great intelligent Being, and we  catch a glimpse of that mind that must be infinite. He created the  whole system of mathematics, vast beyond our comprehension, at once. A  part could not exist without the whole. No growth; no change; no  evolution; no improvement, because the whole system was perfect from  the first. Reasoning from analogy, is it not reasonable to say that  the God who flashed upon the whole universe, the limitless system of  mathematics in an instant, also created man as Moses said?  Analogy  supports the doctrine of the special creation of man in a day.    The great system of mathematics which could not exist without a  creator, is so extensive that 40 units are taught in a single  university. New subjects are added, new text books written, new  formulas devised, new principles demonstrated,--and the subject is by  no means exhausted.  He, by whose will this fathomless science came  into existence, knows more than all the mathematicians of the past,  present and future, and possibly all the evolutionists of the world.    2. PHYSICAL LAWS.--All physical laws, prevailing throughout the  universe, came into being by the will of God, in an instant of  time. No growth, no change, no development, no evolution. The  presumption is that God created all things in a similar way. If it was  wisest and best to bring into being the great science of mathematics  and fix all physical laws,--all in a moment of time, why should he  consume 60,000,000 or 500,000,000 years in bringing man into  existence? Evolution is all out of harmony with God's other methods of  work.    Gravitation was complete from the first. No growth; no evolution. The  laws of light, heat, electricity, etc., remain unchanged. Light  travels with the same unvarying velocity, as when, 60,000 years ago,  it started from the distant star-cloud. Some estimate our universe to  be 1,000,000 light years across. Yet in all these limitless reaches,  the same perfect and complete laws prevail, touching light, heat,  electricity, gravitation, etc. God makes no mistakes and no evolution  is needed. Does not this furnish a presumption that God could and did  create man complete and full grown with a wonderful body, and a soul  in his own image?    In this discussion, we have spoken of the \"laws\" of nature, after  common usage. But laws are only a record of God's acts. An  unchangeable God makes unchangeable laws. There is a rigid fixity  written over the face of nature. Every law and principle is complete  and perfect and finished, and there is no room for evolution.    Matter did not create itself, nor evolute nor grow. It must have been  created instantaneously by the power of God, whether in a nebulous  condition or not. So enchanting is their theory, that many profess to  believe that not only were all species of animals and plants evolved  from a single germ, but that even matter itself was evolved out of  nothing. This theory of evolution as wide as the universe, as  ponderous as the stars, is supported only by the weak stork legs of  wistful possibility.        26. DESPERATE ARGUMENTS      Many arguments gravely given in support of evolution, reveal a great  poverty of facts and logic. An instantaneous photograph of an \"infant,  three weeks old, supporting its own weight for over two minutes,\" is  given by Romanes as a proof that man is descended from a simian  (ape-like) ancestor. As this same picture is widely copied in  evolution text books, they must have failed to get the picture of any  other infant performing a like feat. Just how this affords any  convincing proof that man is a monkey, we leave the reader to figure  out.  Our attention is called to the way this child and another child,  whose picture is likewise generally copied, hold their feet (like  monkeys climbing trees) showing they are little monkeys. Though we  fail to see the force of this argument, it must be among their best  from the emphasis they give it. Prof. H. H. Newman, of Chicago  University, a leading evolutionist actually writes as follows,  (Readings): \"The common cotton-tail rabbit raises its white tail when  it runs. This is interpreted [by whom, evolutionists or rabbits?] as a  signal of danger to other rabbits.\"    The following absurd speculation, by a lecturer in the \"University  Extension Course,\" was printed in the Philadelphia Bulletin: \"Evidence  that early man climbed trees with their feet lies in the way we wear  the heels of our shoes,--more at the outside. A baby can wiggle its  big toe without wiggling its other toes,--an indication that it once  used its big toe in climbing trees. We often dream of falling. Those  who fell out of the trees some 50,000 years ago and were killed, of  course, had no descendants (?) So those who fell and were not hurt, of  course, lived, and so we are never hurt in our dreams of falling\"!  While we read these feeble arguments, which the newspapers would call  piffle, how can we escape the conviction that evolution is in  desperate need of argument?  Imagine the Copernican theory relying on  such piffle for support. Is there a freak idea without a freak  professor to support it?        27. TWENTY OBJECTIONS ADMITTED        Evolutionists themselves, even including Darwin, admit as many as 20  objections to his theory. Darwin states the first four and  Prof. V. L. Kellogg sums up the remaining 16 on pp. 247-52 of  \"Readings in Evolution.\"  Among them are:--    1. There must have been innumerable transitional forms in the  formation of new species. No convincing evidence of these missing  links exists.    2. Natural selection can not account for the instinct of animals such  as that of the honey bee, \"which has practically anticipated the  discoveries of profound mathematicians.\"    4. The offspring of such nearly related species as can be crossed are  sterile, showing that nature discourages and in no wise encourages the  formation of new species.    5. The changes resulting from the use and disuse of organs are not  inherited.    6. Since Darwinism eliminates design, it is only the exploded ancient  heathen doctrine of chance.    7. Variation is so slight as to be imperceptible, and, therefore,  cannot account for the \"survival of the fittest.\"  If the same  progressive changes do not occur generally, if not universally, in the  numbers of the same species in the same period, no new species can  arise. Such general changes do not occur.    8. Natural selection could not make use of initial slight  changes. \"What would be the advantage of the first few hairs of a  mammal, or the first steps toward feathers in a bird, when these  creatures were beginning to diverge from their reptilian ancestors?\"    9. Even if Darwinism should explain the _survival_ of the  fittest, it does not explain the _arrival_ of the fittest, which  is far more important.    10. Darwin says, \"I am convinced that natural selection has been the  most important but not the exclusive means of modification.\" Many  scientists think it of very little importance, and that it is not  true.    11. \"The fluctuating variations of Darwinism are _quantitative_,  or plus and minus variations; whereas, the differences between species  are _qualitative_.\" Growth and development in one species does  not produce a new species, which must be of a different kind. Miles  Darden, of Tenn., was 90 inches tall, and weighed 1000 pounds, but  remained a member of the human species, though he was as high and  heavy as a horse. So did the giant Posius, over 10 feet tall, who  lived in the days of Augustus.    12. \"There is a growing skepticism on the part of biologists as to the  extreme fierceness of the struggle for existence and of the consequent  rigor of selection.\" Overproduction and shortage of space and food  might sometime be a factor of importance, but has it been so in the  past? Has it affected the human race?    13. Darwin proposed the theory of gemmules. Prof.  H. H. Newman says,  \"This theory was not satisfactory even to Darwin and is now only of  historical interest.\"    14. Darwin's subsidiary theory of sexual selection has also been  rejected by scientists as worthless.    In view of these and other objections, is it any wonder that Darwin's  theory has been so largely rejected by the scientific world?    And is it not amazing that self-styled \"scientists\" hold on to their  precious theory of evolution, as if these objections had no weight?  They can not save evolution even by rejecting Darwinism.        28. SCIENTISTS CONDEMN EVOLUTION      Dr. Etheridge, famous fossilologist of the British Museum, one of the  highest authorities in the world, said:--\"Nine-tenths of the talk of  evolutionists is sheer nonsense, not founded on observation and wholly  unsupported by facts. This museum is full of proofs of the utter  falsity of their views. In all this great museum, there is not a  particle of evidence of the transmutation of species.\" Is a man in  that position not a credible witness?    Prof. Beale, of King's College, London, a distinguished physiologist,  said: \"There is no evidence that man has descended from, or is, or  was, in any way specially related to, any other organism in nature,  through evolution, or by any other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/852"],[0,"Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education (#17)"],[1," and acts (largely mathematical) stand for the Absolute  Whole which is in process of unfolding. According to Hegel, existing  institutions are its effective actual representatives. Emphasis upon  symbols and institutions tends to divert perception from the direct  growth of experience in richness of meaning. Another influential but  defective theory is that which conceives that mind has, at birth,  certain mental faculties or powers, such as perceiving, remembering,  willing, judging, generalizing, attending, etc., and that education is  the training of these faculties through repeated exercise. This theory  treats subject matter as comparatively external and indifferent, its  value residing simply in the fact that it may occasion exercise of  the general powers. Criticism was directed upon this separation of the  alleged powers from one another and from the material upon which they  act. The outcome of the theory in practice was shown to be an undue  emphasis upon the training of narrow specialized modes of skill at the  expense of initiative, inventiveness, and readaptability--qualities  which depend upon the broad and consecutive interaction of specific  activities with one another. 1 As matter of fact, the interconnection is  so great, there are so many paths of construction, that every stimulus  brings about some change in all of the organs of response. We are  accustomed however to ignore most of these modifications of the total  organic activity, concentrating upon that one which is most specifically  adapted to the most urgent stimulus of the moment. 2 This statement  should be compared with what was said earlier about the sequential  ordering of responses (p. 25). It is merely a more explicit statement of  the way in which that consecutive arrangement occurs.          Chapter Six: Education as Conservative and Progressive    1. Education as Formation. We now come to a type of theory which denies  the existence of faculties and emphasizes the unique role of subject  matter in the development of mental and moral disposition. According to  it, education is neither a process of unfolding from within nor is it  a training of faculties resident in mind itself. It is rather the  formation of mind by setting up certain associations or connections of  content by means of a subject matter presented from without. Education  proceeds by instruction taken in a strictly literal sense, a building  into the mind from without. That education is formative of mind is not  questioned; it is the conception already propounded. But formation here  has a technical meaning dependent upon the idea of something operating  from without. Herbart is the best historical representative of this type  of theory. He denies absolutely the existence of innate faculties. The  mind is simply endowed with the power of producing various qualities in  reaction to the various realities which act upon it. These qualitatively  different reactions are called presentations (Vorstellungen). Every  presentation once called into being persists; it may be driven below the  \"threshold\" of consciousness by new and stronger presentations, produced  by the reaction of the soul to new material, but its activity continues  by its own inherent momentum, below the surface of consciousness. What  are termed faculties--attention, memory, thinking, perception, even the  sentiments, are arrangements, associations, and complications, formed  by the interaction of these submerged presentations with one another and  with new presentations. Perception, for example, is the complication of  presentations which result from the rise of old presentations to greet  and combine with new ones; memory is the evoking of an old presentation  above the threshold of consciousness by getting entangled with another  presentation, etc. Pleasure is the result of reinforcement among the  independent activities of presentations; pain of their pulling different  ways, etc.    The concrete character of mind consists, then, wholly of the various  arrangements formed by the various presentations in their different  qualities. The \"furniture\" of the mind is the mind. Mind is wholly a  matter of \"contents.\" The educational implications of this doctrine are  threefold.    (1) This or that kind of mind is formed by the use of objects which  evoke this or that kind of reaction and which produce this or that  arrangement among the reactions called out. The formation of mind is  wholly a matter of the presentation of the proper educational materials.    (2) Since the earlier presentations constitute the \"apperceiving organs\"  which control the assimilation of new presentations, their character is  all important. The effect of new presentations is to reinforce groupings  previously formed. The business of the educator is, first, to select the  proper material in order to fix the nature of the original reactions,  and, secondly, to arrange the sequence of subsequent presentations  on the basis of the store of ideas secured by prior transactions. The  control is from behind, from the past, instead of, as in the unfolding  conception, in the ultimate goal.    (3) Certain formal steps of all method in teaching may be laid down.  Presentation of new subject matter is obviously the central thing,  but since knowing consists in the way in which this interacts with the  contents already submerged below consciousness, the first thing is  the step of \"preparation,\"--that is, calling into special activity and  getting above the floor of consciousness those older presentations which  are to assimilate the new one. Then after the presentation, follow the  processes of interaction of new and old; then comes the application of  the newly formed content to the performance of some task. Everything  must go through this course; consequently there is a perfectly uniform  method in instruction in all subjects for all pupils of all ages.    Herbart's great service lay in taking the work of teaching out of  the region of routine and accident. He brought it into the sphere of  conscious method; it became a conscious business with a definite aim  and procedure, instead of being a compound of casual inspiration  and subservience to tradition. Moreover, everything in teaching and  discipline could be specified, instead of our having to be content with  vague and more or less mystic generalities about ultimate ideals and  speculative spiritual symbols. He abolished the notion of ready-made  faculties, which might be trained by exercise upon any sort of  material, and made attention to concrete subject matter, to the content,  all-important. Herbart undoubtedly has had a greater influence in  bringing to the front questions connected with the material of study  than any other educational philosopher. He stated problems of method  from the standpoint of their connection with subject matter: method  having to do with the manner and sequence of presenting new subject  matter to insure its proper interaction with old.    The fundamental theoretical defect of this view lies in ignoring the  existence in a living being of active and specific functions which are  developed in the redirection and combination which occur as they are  occupied with their environment. The theory represents the Schoolmaster  come to his own. This fact expresses at once its strength and its  weakness. The conception that the mind consists of what has been  taught, and that the importance of what has been taught consists in  its availability for further teaching, reflects the pedagogue's view  of life. The philosophy is eloquent about the duty of the teacher in  instructing pupils; it is almost silent regarding his privilege of  learning. It emphasizes the influence of intellectual environment  upon the mind; it slurs over the fact that the environment involves a  personal sharing in common experiences. It exaggerates beyond reason  the possibilities of consciously formulated and used methods, and  underestimates the role of vital, unconscious, attitudes. It insists  upon the old, the past, and passes lightly over the operation of the  genuinely novel and unforeseeable. It takes, in brief, everything  educational into account save its essence,--vital energy seeking  opportunity for effective exercise. All education forms character,  mental and moral, but formation consists in the selection and  coordination of native activities so that they may utilize the subject  matter of the social environment. Moreover, the formation is not only a  formation of native activities, but it takes place through them. It is a  process of reconstruction, reorganization.    2. Education as Recapitulation and Retrospection. A peculiar combination  of the ideas of development and formation from without has given rise  to the recapitulation theory of education, biological and cultural. The  individual develops, but his proper development consists in repeating in  orderly stages the past evolution of animal life and human history. The  former recapitulation occurs physiologically; the latter should be made  to occur by means of education. The alleged biological truth that the  individual in his growth from the simple embryo to maturity repeats the  history of the evolution of animal life in the progress of forms  from the simplest to the most complex (or expressed technically, that  ontogenesis parallels phylogenesis) does not concern us, save as it is  supposed to afford scientific foundation for cultural recapitulation  of the past. Cultural recapitulation says, first, that children at a  certain age are in the mental and moral condition of savagery; their  instincts are vagrant and predatory because their ancestors at one time  lived such a life. Consequently (so it is concluded) the proper subject  matter of their education at this time is the material--especially the  literary material of myths, folk-tale, and song--produced by humanity  in the analogous stage.
