Well, and even  highly developed, in a few instances,--I allude especially to the  Iroquois,--with respect to certain points of material concernment, the  mind of the Indian in other respects was and is almost hopelessly  stagnant. The very traits that raise him above the servile races are  hostile to the kind and degree of civilization which those races so  easily attain. His intractable spirit of independence, and the pride  which forbids him to be an imitator, reinforce but too strongly that  savage lethargy of mind from which it is so hard to rouse him. No race,  perhaps, ever offered greater difficulties to those laboring for its  improvement.    To sum up the results of this examination, the primitive Indian was as  savage in his religion as in his life. He was divided between  fetich-worship and that next degree of religious development which  consists in the worship of deities embodied in the human form. His  conception of their attributes was such as might have been expected. His  gods were no whit better than himself. Even when he borrows from  Christianity the idea of a Supreme and Universal Spirit, his tendency is  to reduce Him to a local habitation and a bodily shape; and this  tendency disappears only in tribes that have been long in contact with  civilized white men. The primitive Indian, yielding his untutored homage  to One All-pervading and Omnipotent Spirit, is a dream of poets,  rhetoricians, and sentimentalists.          CHAPTER I.  1634.    NOTRE-DAME DES ANGES.    Quebec in 1634 â¢ Father Le Jeune â¢ The Mission-House â¢ Its Domestic  Economy â¢ The Jesuits and their Designs    Opposite Quebec lies the tongue of land called Point Levi. One who, in  the summer of the year 1634, stood on its margin and looked northward,  across the St. Lawrence, would have seen, at the distance of a mile or  more, a range of lofty cliffs, rising on the left into the bold heights  of Cape Diamond, and on the right sinking abruptly to the bed of the  tributary river St. Charles. Beneath these cliffs, at the brink of the  St. Lawrence, he would have descried a cluster of warehouses, sheds, and  wooden tenements. Immediately above, along the verge of the precipice,  he could have traced the outlines of a fortified work, with a flagstaff,  and a few small cannon to command the river; while, at the only point  where Nature had made the heights accessible, a zigzag path connected  the warehouses and the fort.    Now, embarked in the canoe of some Montagnais Indian, let him cross the  St. Lawrence, land at the pier, and, passing the cluster of buildings,  climb the pathway up the cliff. Pausing for rest and breath, he might  see, ascending and descending, the tenants of this outpost of the  wilderness: a soldier of the fort, or an officer in slouched hat and  plume; a factor of the fur company, owner and sovereign lord of all  Canada; a party of Indians; a trader from the upper country, one of the  precursors of that hardy race of coureurs de bois, destined to form a  conspicuous and striking feature of the Canadian population: next,  perhaps, would appear a figure widely different. The close, black  cassock, the rosary hanging from the waist, and the wide, black hat,  looped up at the sides, proclaimed the Jesuit,--Father Le Jeune,  Superior of the Residence of Quebec.    And now, that we may better know the aspect and condition of the infant  colony and incipient mission, we will follow the priest on his way.  Mounting the steep path, he reached the top of the cliff, some two  hundred feet above the river and the warehouses. On the left lay the  fort built by Champlain, covering a part of the ground now forming  Durham Terrace and the Place d'Armes. Its ramparts were of logs and  earth, and within was a turreted building of stone, used as a barrack,  as officers' quarters, and for other purposes. [1] Near the fort stood a  small chapel, newly built. The surrounding country was cleared and  partially cultivated; yet only one dwelling-house worthy the name  appeared. It was a substantial cottage, where lived Madame HÃ©bert, widow  of the first settler of Canada, with her daughter, her son-in-law  Couillard, and their children, good Catholics all, who, two years  before, when Quebec was evacuated by the English, [2] wept for joy at  beholding Le Jeune, and his brother Jesuit, De NouÃ«, crossing their  threshold to offer beneath their roof the long-forbidden sacrifice of  the Mass. There were inclosures with cattle near at hand; and the house,  with its surroundings, betokened industry and thrift.    [1] Compare the various notices in Champlain (1632) with that of Du  Creux, Historia Canadensis, 204.  [2] See \"Pioneers of France in the New World.\" HÃ©bert's cottage seems to  have stood between Ste.-Famille and Couillard Streets, as appears by a  contract of 1634, cited by M. Ferland.    Thence Le Jeune walked on, across the site of the modern market-place,  and still onward, near the line of the cliffs which sank abruptly on his  right. Beneath lay the mouth of the St. Charles; and, beyond, the  wilderness shore of Beauport swept in a wide curve eastward, to where,  far in the distance, the Gulf of Montmorenci yawned on the great river.  [3] The priest soon passed the clearings, and entered the woods which  covered the site of the present suburb of St. John. Thence he descended  to a lower plateau, where now lies the suburb of St. Roch, and, still  advancing, reached a pleasant spot at the extremity of the  Pointe-aux-LiÃ¨vres, a tract of meadow land nearly inclosed by a sudden  bend of the St. Charles. Here lay a canoe or skiff; and, paddling across  the narrow stream, Le Jeune saw on the meadow, two hundred yards from  the bank, a square inclosure formed of palisades, like a modern picket  fort of the Indian frontier. [4] Within this inclosure were two  buildings, one of which had been half burned by the English, and was not  yet repaired. It served as storehouse, stable, workshop, and bakery.  Opposite stood the principal building, a structure of planks, plastered  with mud, and thatched with long grass from the meadows. It consisted of  one story, a garret, and a cellar, and contained four principal rooms,  of which one served as chapel, another as refectory, another as kitchen,  and the fourth as a lodging for workmen. The furniture of all was plain  in the extreme. Until the preceding year, the chapel had had no other  ornament than a sheet on which were glued two coarse engravings; but the  priests had now decorated their altar with an image of a dove  representing the Holy Ghost, an image of Loyola, another of Xavier, and  three images of the Virgin. Four cells opened from the refectory, the  largest of which was eight feet square. In these lodged six priests,  while two lay brothers found shelter in the garret. The house had been  hastily built, eight years before, and now leaked in all parts. Such was  the Residence of Notre-Dame des Anges. Here was nourished the germ of a  vast enterprise, and this was the cradle of the great mission of New  France. [5]    [3] The settlement of Beauport was begun this year, or the year  following, by the Sieur Giffard, to whom a large tract had been granted  here--Langevin, Notes sur les Archives de N. D. de Beauport, 5.  [4] This must have been very near the point where the streamlet called  the River Lairet enters the St. Charles. The place has a triple historic  interest. The wintering-place of Cartier in 1535-6 (see \"Pioneers of  France\") seems to have been here. Here, too, in 1759, Montcalm's bridge  of boats crossed the St. Charles; and in a large intrenchment, which  probably included the site of the Jesuit mission-house, the remnants of  his shattered army rallied, after their defeat on the Plains of  Abraham.--See the very curious Narrative of the Chevalier Johnstone,  published by the Historical Society of Quebec.  [5] The above particulars are gathered from the Relations of 1626  (Lalemant), and 1632, 1633, 1634, 1635 (Le Jeune), but chiefly from a  long letter of the Father Superior to the Provincial of the Jesuits at  Paris, containing a curiously minute report of the state of the mission.  It was sent from Quebec by the returning ships in the summer of 1634,  and will be found in Carayon, PremiÃ¨re Mission des JÃ©suites au Canada,  122. The original is in the archives of the Order at Rome.    Of the six Jesuits gathered in the refectory for the evening meal, one  was conspicuous among the rest,--a tall, strong man, with features that  seemed carved by Nature for a soldier, but which the mental habits of  years had stamped with the visible impress of the priesthood. This was  Jean de BrÃ©beuf, descendant of a noble family of Normandy, and one of  the ablest and most devoted zealots whose names stand on the missionary  rolls of his Order. His companions were Masse, Daniel, Davost, De NouÃ«,  and the Father Superior, Le Jeune. Masse was the same priest who had  been the companion of Father Biard in the abortive mission of Acadia.  [6] By reason of his useful qualities, Le Jeune nicknamed him \"le PÃ¨re  Utile.\" At present, his special function was the care of the pigs and  cows, which he kept in the inclosure around the buildings, lest they  should ravage the neighboring fields of rye, barley, wheat, and maize.  [7] De NouÃ« had charge of the eight or ten workmen employed by the  mission, who gave him at times no little trouble by their repinings and  complaints. [8] They were forced to hear mass every morning and prayers  every evening, besides an exhortation on Sunday. Some of them were for  returning home, while two or three, of a different complexion, wished to  be Jesuits themselves. The Fathers, in their intervals of leisure,  worked with their men, spade in hand. For the rest, they were busied in  preaching, singing vespers, saying mass and hearing confessions at the  fort of Quebec, catechizing a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6934"],[0,"The Radio Amateur's Hand Book (#17)"],[1,"ier_;  however, two, three or more, amplifying tubes can be connected up by  means of an equal number of radio frequency transformers when you will  get wonderful results. Where a six step amplifier, that is, where six  amplifying tubes are connected together, or in _cascade_, the first  three are usually coupled up with radio frequency transformers and the  last three with audio frequency transformers. A radio frequency  transformer is shown at B and costs $6 to $7.    An Audio Frequency Transformer Amplifying Receiving Set.--Where audio  frequency transformers are used for stepping up the voltage of the  current of the detector and amplifier tubes, the radio frequency  current does not get into the plate circuit of the detector at all for  the reason that the iron core of the transformer chokes them off,  hence, the succeeding amplifiers operate at audio frequencies. An  audio frequency transformer is shown at A in Fig. 46 and a wiring  diagram showing how the tubes are connected in _cascade_ with the  transformers is shown at B; it is therefore a two-step audio frequency  receiving set.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 46.--Audio Frequency Transformer.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 46--Wiring Diagram for an Audio Frequency  Transformer Amplifying Receiving Set. (With Vacuum Tube Detector and  Two Step Amplifier Tubes.)]    A Six Step Amplifier Receiving Set With a Loop Aerial.--By using a  receiving set having a three step radio frequency and a three step  audio frequency, that is, a set in which there are coupled three  amplifying tubes with radio frequency transformers and three  amplifying tubes with audio frequency transformers as described under  the caption _A Radio Frequency Transformer Receiving Set_, you can use  a _loop aerial_ in your room thus getting around the difficulties--if  such there be--in erecting an out-door aerial. You can easily make a  loop aerial by winding 10 turns of _No. 14_ or _16_ copper wire about  1/16 inch apart on a wooden frame two feet on the side as shown in  Fig. 47. With this six step amplifier set and loop aerial you can  receive wave lengths of 150 to 600 meters from various high power  stations which are at considerable distances away.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 47.--Six Step Amplifier with Loop Aerial.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 47.--Efficient Regenerative Receiving Set.  (With Three Coil Loose Coupler Tuner.)]    How to Prevent Howling.--Where radio frequency or audio frequency  amplifiers are used to couple your amplifier tubes in cascade you must  take particular pains to shield them from one another in order to  prevent the _feed back_ of the currents through them, which makes the  head phones or loud speaker _howl_. To shield them from each other the  tubes should be enclosed in metal boxes and placed at least 6 inches  apart while the transformers should be set so that their cores are at  right angles to each other and these also should be not less than six  inches apart.          CHAPTER X    REGENERATIVE AMPLIFICATION RECEIVING SETS      While a vacuum tube detector has an amplifying action of its own, and  this accounts for its great sensitiveness, its amplifying action can  be further increased to an enormous extent by making the radio  frequency currents that are set up in the oscillation circuits react  on the detector.    Such currents are called _feed-back_ or _regenerative_ currents and  when circuits are so arranged as to cause the currents to flow back  through the detector tube the amplification keeps on increasing until  the capacity of the tube itself is reached. It is like using steam  over and over again in a steam turbine until there is no more energy  left in it. A system of circuits which will cause this regenerative  action to take place is known as the _Armstrong circuits_ and is so  called after the young man who discovered it.    Since the regenerative action of the radio frequency currents is  produced by the detector tube itself and which sets up an amplifying  effect without the addition of an amplifying tube, this type of  receiving set has found great favor with amateurs, while in  combination with amplifying tubes it multiplies their power  proportionately and it is in consequence used in one form or another  in all the better sets.    There are many different kinds of circuits which can be used to  produce the regenerative amplification effect while the various kinds  of tuning coils will serve for coupling them; for instance a two or  three slide single tuning coil will answer the purpose but as it does  not give good results it is not advisable to spend either time or  money on it. A better scheme is to use a loose coupler formed of two  or three honeycomb or other compact coils, while a _variocoupler_ or a  _variometer_ or two will produce the maximum regenerative action.    The Simplest Type of Regenerative Receiving Set. With Loose Coupled  Tuning Coil.--While this regenerative set is the simplest that will  give anything like fair results it is here described not on account of  its desirability, but because it will serve to give you the  fundamental idea of how the _feed-back_ circuit is formed.    For this set you need: (1) a _loose-coupled tuning coil_ such as  described in Chapter III, (2) a _variable condenser_ of _.001 mfd._  (microfarad) capacitance; (3) one _fixed condenser_ of _.001 mfd._;  (4) one _fixed condenser_ for the grid leak circuit of _.00025 mfd._;  (5) a _grid leak_ of 1/2 to 2 megohms resistance; (6) a _vacuum tube  detector_; (7) an _A 6 volt battery_; (8) a _rheostat_; (9) a _B 22  1/2 volt battery_; and (10) a pair of _2000 ohm head phones_.    Connecting Up the Parts.--Begin by connecting the leading-in wire of  the aerial with the binding post end of the primary coil of the loose  coupler as shown in the wiring diagram Fig. 48 and then connect the  sliding contact with the water pipe or other ground. Connect the  binding post end of the primary coil with one post of the variable  condenser, connect the other post of this with one of the posts of the  _.00025 mfd._ condenser and the other end of this with the grid of the  detector tube; then around this condenser shunt the grid leak  resistance.    [Illustration: Fig. 48.--Simple Regenerative Receiving Set. (With  Loose Coupler Tuner.)]    Next connect the sliding contact of the primary coil with the other  post of the variable condenser and from this lead a wire on over to  one of the terminals of the filament of the vacuum tube; to the other  terminal of the filament connect one of the posts of the rheostat and  connect the other post to the - or negative electrode of the A  battery and then connect the + or positive electrode of it to the  other terminal of the filament.    Connect the + or positive electrode of the A battery with one post of  the .001 mfd. fixed condenser and connect the other post of this to  one of the ends of the secondary coil of the tuning coil and which is  now known as the _tickler coil_; then connect the other end of the  secondary, or tickler coil to the plate of the vacuum tube. In the  wiring diagram the secondary, or tickler coil is shown above and in a  line with the primary coil but this is only for the sake of making the  connections clear; in reality the secondary, or tickler coil slides to  and fro in the primary coil as shown and described in Chapter III.  Finally connect the _negative_, or zinc pole of the _B battery_ to one  side of the fixed condenser, the _positive_, or carbon, pole to one of  the terminals of the head phones and the other terminal of this to the  other post of the fixed condenser when your regenerative set is  complete.    An Efficient Regenerative Receiving Set. With Three Coil Loose  Coupler.--To construct a really good regenerative set you must use a  loose coupled tuner that has three coils, namely a _primary_, a  _secondary_ and a _tickler coil_. A tuner of this kind is made like an  ordinary loose coupled tuning coil but it has a _third_ coil as shown  at A and B in Fig. 49. The middle coil, which is the _secondary_, is  fixed to the base, and the large outside coil, which is the _primary_,  is movable, that is it slides to and fro over the middle coil, while  the small inside coil, which is the _tickler_, is also movable and can  slide in or out of the middle _coil_. None of these coils is variable;  all are wound to receive waves up to 360 meters in length when used  with a variable condenser of _.001 mfd_. capacitance. In other words  you slide the coils in and out to get the right amount of coupling and  you tune by adjusting the variable condenser to get the exact wave  length you want.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 49.--Diagram of a Three Coil Coupler.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 49.--Three Coil Loose Coupler Tuner.]    With Compact Coils.--Compact coil tuners are formed of three fixed  inductances wound in flat coils, and these are pivoted in a mounting  so that the distance between them and, therefore, the coupling, can be  varied, as shown at A in Fig. 50. These coils are wound up by the  makers for various wave lengths ranging from a small one that will  receive waves of any length up to 360 meters to a large one that has a  maximum of 24,000 meters. For an amateur set get three of the smallest  coils when you can not only hear amateur stations that send on a 200  meter wave but broadcasting stations that send on a 360 meter wave.    [Illustration: Fig. 50.--Honeycomb Inductance Coil.]    These three coils are mounted with panel plugs which latter fit into a  stand, or mounting, so that the middle coil is fixed, that is,  stationary, while the two outside coils can be swung to and fro like a  door; this scheme permits small variations of coupling to be had  between the coils and this can be done either by handles or by means  of knobs on a panel board. While I have suggested the use of the  smallest size coils, you can get and use those wound for any wave  length you want to"]]]
