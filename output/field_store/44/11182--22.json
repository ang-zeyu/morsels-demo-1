Such are the Sibyls  of Gueroino; the eye is overfull of expression, dilated and lustrous;  it seems to have drawn the whole being into it.    Sickness is the frequent result of this overcharged existence. To this  region, however misunderstood, or interpreted with presumptuous  carelessness, belong the phenomena of magnetism, or mesmerism, as it  is now often called, where the trance of the Ecstatica purports to be  produced by the agency of one human being on another, instead of, as  in her case, direct from the spirit.    The worldling has his sneer at this as at the services of religion.  \"The churches can always be filled with women\"--\"Show me a man in one  of your magnetic states, and I will believe.\"    Women are, indeed, the easy victims both of priestcraft and  self-delusion; but this would not be, if the intellect was developed  in proportion to the other powers. They would then have a regulator,  and be more in equipoise, yet must retain the same nervous  susceptibility while their physical structure is such as it is.    It is with just that hope that we welcome everything that tends to  strengthen the fibre and develop the nature on more sides. When the  intellect and affections are in harmony; when intellectual  consciousness is calm and deep; inspiration will not be confounded  with fancy.      Then, \"she who advances      With rapturous, lyrical glances,    Singing the song of the earth, singing      Its hymn to the Gods,\"      will not be pitied as a mad-woman, nor shrunk from as unnatural.    The Greeks, who saw everything in forms, which we are trying to  ascertain as law, and classify as cause, embodied all this in the form  of Cassandra. Cassandra was only unfortunate in receiving her gift too  soon. The remarks, however, that the world still makes in such cases,  are well expressed by the Greek dramatist.    In the Trojan dames there are fine touches of nature with regard to  Cassandra. Hecuba shows that mixture of shame and reverence that  prosaic kindred always do toward the inspired child, the poet, the  elected sufferer for the race.    When the herald announces that Cassandra is chosen to be the mistress  of Agamemnon, Hecuba answers, with indignation, betraying the pride  and faith she involuntarily felt in this daughter.      \"_Hec_. The maiden of Phoebus, to whom the golden-haired         Gave as a privilege a virgin life!      _Tal_. Love of the inspired maiden hath pierced him.      _Hec_. Then cast away, my child, the sacred keys, and from thy person         The consecrated garlands which thou wearest.\"      Yet, when, a moment after, Cassandra appears, singing, wildly, her  inspired song, Hecuba calls her, \"My _frantic_ child.\"    Yet how graceful she is in her tragic _raptus_, the chorus shows.      \"_Chorus_. How sweetly at thy house's ills thou smil'st,           Chanting what, haply, thou wilt not show true.\"      If Hecuba dares not trust her highest instinct about her daughter,  still less can the vulgar mind of the herald Talthybius, a man not  without feeling, but with no princely, no poetic blood, abide the  wild, prophetic mood which insults all his prejudices.      \"_Tal_. The venerable, and that accounted wise,        Is nothing better than that of no repute;        For the greatest king of all the Greeks,        The dear son of Atreus, a possessed with the love        Of this mad-Woman. I, indeed, am poor;        Yet I would not receive her to my bed.\"      The royal Agamemnon could see the beauty of Cassandra; _he_ was  not afraid of her prophetic gifts.    The best topic for a chapter on this subject, in the present day,  would be the history of the Seeress of Prevorst, the best observed  subject of magnetism in our present times, and who, like her  ancestresses of Delphos, was roused to ecstasy or phrensy by the touch  of the laurel.    I observe in her case, and in one known to me here, that what might  have been a gradual and gentle disclosure of remarkable powers was  broken and jarred into disease by an unsuitable marriage. Both these  persons were unfortunate in not understanding what was involved in  this relation, but acted ignorantly, as their friends desired. They  thought that this was the inevitable destiny of Woman. But when  engaged in the false position, it was impossible for them to endure  its dissonances, as those of less delicate perceptions can; and the  fine flow of life was checked and sullied. They grew sick; but, even  so, learned and disclosed more than those in health are wont to do.    In such cases, worldlings sneer; but reverent men learn wondrous news,  either from the person observed, or by thoughts caused in themselves  by the observation. Fenelon learns from Guyon, Kerner from his  Seeress, what we fain would know. But to appreciate such disclosures  one must be a child; and here the phrase, \"women and children,\" may,  perhaps, be interpreted aright, that only little children shall enter  into the kingdom of heaven.    All these motions of the time, tides that betoken a waxing moon,  overflow upon our land. The world at large is readier to let Woman  learn and manifest the capacities of her nature than it ever was  before, and here is a less encumbered field and freer air than  anywhere else. And it ought to be so; we ought to pay for Isabella's  jewels.    The names of nations are feminine--Religion, Virtue and Victory are  feminine. To those who have a superstition, as to outward reigns, it  is not without significance that the name of the queen of our  motherland should at this crisis be Victoria,--Victoria the First.  Perhaps to us it may be given to disclose the era thus outwardly  presaged.    Another Isabella too at this time ascends the throne. Might she open a  new world to her sex! But, probably, these poor little women are,  least of any, educated to serve as examples or inspirers for the rest.  The Spanish queen is younger; we know of her that she sprained her  foot the other day, dancing in her private apartments; of Victoria,  that she reads aloud, in a distinct voice and agreeable manner, her  addresses to Parliament on certain solemn days, and, yearly, that she  presents to the nation some new prop of royalty. These ladies have,  very likely, been trained more completely to the puppet life than any  other. The queens, who have been queens indeed, were trained by  adverse circumstances to know the world around them and their own  powers.    It is moving, while amusing, to read of the Scottish peasant measuring  the print left by the queen's foot as she walks, and priding himself  on its beauty. It is so natural to wish to find what is fair and  precious in high places,--so astonishing to find the Bourbon a  glutton, or the Guelph a dullard or gossip.    In our own country, women are, in many respects, better situated than  men. Good books are allowed, with more time to read them. They are not  so early forced into the bustle of life, nor so weighed down by  demands for outward success. The perpetual changes, incident to our  society, make the blood circulate freely through the body politic,  and, if not favorable at present to the grace and bloom of life, they  are so to activity, resource, and would be to reflection, but for a  low materialist tendency, from which the women are generally exempt in  themselves, though its existence, among the men, has a tendency to  repress their impulses and make them doubt their instincts, thus often  paralyzing their action during the best years.    But they have time to think, and no traditions chain them, and few  conventionalities, compared with what must be met in other nations.  There is no reason why they should not discover that the secrets of  nature are open, the revelations of the spirit waiting, for whoever  will seek them. When the mind is once awakened to this consciousness,  it will not be restrained by the habits of the past, but fly to seek  the seeds of a heavenly future.    Their employments are more favorable to meditation than those of men.    Woman is not addressed religiously here more than elsewhere. She is  told that she should be worthy to be the mother of a Washington, or  the companion of some good man.' But in many, many instances, she has  already learned that all bribes have the same flaw; that truth and  good are to be sought solely for their own sakes. And, already, an  ideal sweetness floats over many forms, shines in many eyes.    Already deep questions are put by young girls on the great theme: What  shall I do to enter upon the eternal life?    Men are very courteous to them. They praise them often, check them  seldom. There is chivalry in the feeling toward \"the ladies,\" which  gives them the best seats in the stage-coach, frequent admission, not  only to lectures of all sorts, but to courts of justice, halls of  legislature, reform conventions. The newspaper editor \"would be better  pleased that the Lady's Book should be filled up exclusively by  ladies. It would then, indeed, be a true gem, worthy, to be presented  by young men to the, mistress of their affections.\" Can gallantry go  further?    In this country is venerated, wherever seen, the character which  Goethe spoke of as an Ideal, which he saw actualized in his friend and  patroness, the Grand Duchess Amelia: \"The excellent woman is she, who,  if the husband dies, can be a father to the children.\" And this, if  read aright, tells a great deal.    Women who speak in public, if they have a moral power, such as has  been felt from Angelina Grimke and Abby Kelly,--that is, if they speak  for conscience' sake, to serve a cause which they hold sacred,--invariably  subdue the prejudices of their hearers, and excite an interest  proportionate to the aversion with which it had been the purpose to  regard them.    A passage in a private letter so happily illustrates this, that it  must be inserted here.

The flying column had taken three  days' rations with it, and there be few things nastier than government  rations--especially when government is experimenting with German toys.  Erbsenwurst, tinned beef of surpassing tinniness, compressed vegetables,  and meat-biscuits may be nourishing, but what Thomas Atkins needs is bulk  in his inside. The major, assisted by his brother officers, purchased  goats for the camp and so made the experiment of no effect. Long before  the fatigue-party sent to collect brushwood had returned, the men were  settled down by their valises, kettles and pots had appeared from the  surrounding country and were dangling over fires as the kid and the  compressed vegetable bubbled together; there rose a cheerful clinking of  mess-tins; outrageous demands for \"a little more stuffin' with that there  liver-wing;\" and gust on gust of chaff as pointed as a bayonet and as  delicate as a gun-butt.    \"The boys are in a good temper,\" said the major. \"They'll be singing  presently. Well, a night like this is enough to keep them happy.\"    Over our heads burned the wonderful Indian stars, which are not all  pricked in on one plane, but, preserving an orderly perspective, draw the  eye through the velvet darkness of the void up to the barred doors of  heaven itself. The earth was a grey shadow more unreal than the sky. We  could hear her breathing lightly in the pauses between the howling of the  jackals, the movement of the wind in the tamarisks, and the fitful mutter  of musketry-fire leagues away to the left. A native woman from some unseen  hut began to sing, the mail-train thundered past on its way to Delhi, and  a roosting crow cawed drowsily. Then there was a belt-loosening silence  about the fires, and the even breathing of the crowded earth took up the  story.    The men, full fed, turned to tobacco and song,--their officers with them.  The subaltern is happy who can win the approval of the musical critics in  his regiment, and is honored among the more intricate step-dancers. By  him, as by him who plays cricket cleverly, Thomas Atkins will stand in  time of need, when he will let a better officer go on alone. The ruined  tombs of forgotten Mussulman saints heard the ballad of _Agra Town, The  Buffalo Battery, Marching to Kabul, The long, long Indian Day, The Place  where the Punkah-coolie died_, and that crashing chorus which announces,      Youth's daring spirit, manhood's fire,       Firm hand and eagle eye,     Must he acquire who would aspire       To see the grey boar die.    To-day, of all those jovial thieves who appropriated my commissariat and  lay and laughed round that waterproof sheet, not one remains. They went to  camps that were not of exercise and battles without umpires. Burmah, the  Soudan, and the frontier,--fever and fight,--took them in their time.    I drifted across to the men's fires in search of Mulvaney, whom I found  strategically greasing his feet by the blaze. There is nothing  particularly lovely in the sight of a private thus engaged after a long  day's march, but when you reflect on the exact proportion of the \"might,  majesty, dominion, and power\" of the British Empire which stands on those  feet you take an interest in the proceedings.    \"There's a blister, bad luck to ut, on the heel,\" said Mulvaney. \"I can't  touch ut. Prick ut out, little man,\"    Ortheris took out his house-wife, eased the trouble with a needle, stabbed  Mulvaney in the calf with the same weapon, and was swiftly kicked into the  fire.    \"I've bruk the best av my toes over you, ye grinnin' child av disruption,\"  said Mulvaney, sitting cross-legged and nursing his feet; then seeing me,  \"Oh, ut's you, sorr! Be welkim, an' take that maraudin' scutt's place,  Jock, hold him down on the cindhers for a bit.\"    But Ortheris escaped and went elsewhere, as I took possession of the  hollow he had scraped for himself and lined with his greatcoat. Learoyd on  the other side of the fire grinned affably and in a minute fell fast  asleep.    \"There's the height av politeness for you,\" said Mulvaney, lighting his  pipe with a flaming branch. \"But Jock's eaten half a box av your sardines  at wan gulp, an' I think the tin too. What's the best wid you, sorr, an'  how did you happen to be on the losin' side this day whin we captured  you?\"    \"The Army of the South is winning all along the line,\" I said.    \"Then that line's the hangman's rope, savin' your presence. You'll learn  to-morrow how we rethreated to dhraw thim on before we made thim trouble,  an' that's what a woman does. By the same tokin, we'll be attacked before  the dawnin' an' ut would be betther not to slip your boots. How do I know  that? By the light av pure reason. Here are three companies av us ever so  far inside av the enemy's flank an' a crowd av roarin', tarin', squealin'  cavalry gone on just to turn out the whole hornet's nest av them. Av  course the enemy will pursue, by brigades like as not, an' thin we'll have  to run for ut. Mark my words. I am av the opinion av Polonius whin he  said, 'Don't fight wid ivry scutt for the pure joy av fightin', but if you  do, knock the nose av him first an' frequint.'. We ought to ha' gone on  an' helped the Ghoorkhas.\"    \"But what do you know about Polonius?\" I demanded. This was a new side of  Mulvaney's character.    \"All that Shakespeare iver wrote an' a dale more that the gallery  shouted,\" said the man of war, carefully lacing his boots. \"Did I not tell  you av Silver's theatre in Dublin, whin I was younger than I am now an' a  patron av the drama? Ould Silver wud never pay actor-man or woman their  just dues, an' by consequince his comp'nies was collapsible at the last  minut. Thin the bhoys wud clamor to take a part, an' oft as not ould  Silver made them pay for the fun. Faith, I've seen Hamlut played wid a new  black eye an' the queen as full as a cornucopia. I remimber wanst Hogin  that 'listed in the Black Tyrone an' was shot in South Africa, he sejuced  ould Silver into givin' him Hamlut's part instid av me that had a fine  fancy for rhetoric in those days. Av course I wint into the gallery an'  began to fill the pit wid other people's hats, an' I passed the time av  day to Hogin walkin' through Denmark like a hamstrung mule wid a pall on  his back, 'Hamlut,' sez I, 'there's a hole in your heel. Pull up your  shtockin's, Hamlut,' sez I, 'Hamlut, Hamlut, for the love av decincy dhrop  that skull an' pull up your shtockin's.' The whole house begun to tell him  that. He stopped his soliloquishms mid-between. 'My shtockin's may be  comin' down or they may not,' sez he, screwin' his eye into the gallery,  for well he knew who I was. 'But afther this performince is over me an'  the Ghost 'll trample the tripes out av you, Terence, wid your ass's  bray!' An' that's how I come to know about Hamlut. Eyah! Those days, those  days! Did you iver have onendin' devilmint an' nothin' to pay for it in  your life, sorr?\"    \"Never, without having to pay,\" I said.    \"That's thrue! 'Tis mane whin you considher on ut; but ut's the same wid  horse or fut. A headache if you dhrink, an' a belly-ache if you eat too  much, an' a heart-ache to kape all down. Faith, the beast only gets the  colic, an' he's the lucky man.\"    He dropped his head and stared into the fire, fingering his moustache the  while. From the far side of the bivouac the voice of Corbet-Nolan, senior  subaltern of B Company, uplifted itself in an ancient and much appreciated  song of sentiment, the men moaning melodiously behind him.       The north wind blew coldly, she dropped from that hour,     My own little Kathleen, my sweet little Kathleen,     Kathleen, my Kathleen, Kathleen O'Moore!    With forty-five O's in the last word: even at that distance you might have  cut the soft South Irish accent with a shovel.    \"For all we take we must pay, but the price is cruel high,\" murmured  Mulvaney when the chorus had ceased.    \"What's the trouble?\" I said gently, for I knew that he was a man of an  inextinguishable sorrow.    \"Hear now,\" said he. \"Ye know what I am now. _I_ know what I mint to be at  the beginnin' av my service. I've tould you time an' again, an' what I  have not Dinah Shadd has. An' what am I? Oh, Mary Mother av Hiven, an ould  dhrunken, untrustable baste av a privit that has seen the reg'ment change  out from colonel to drummer-boy, not wanst or twice, but scores av times!  Ay, scores! An' me not so near gettin' promotion as in the first! An' me  livin' on an' kapin' clear av clink, not by my own good conduck, but the  kindness av some orf'cer-bhoy young enough to be son to me! Do I not know  ut? Can I not tell whin I'm passed over at p'rade, tho' I'm rockin' full  av liquor an' ready to fall all in wan piece, such as even a suckin' child  might see, bekaze, 'Oh, 'tis only ould Mulvaney!' An' whin I'm let off in  ord'ly-room through some thrick of the tongue an' a ready answer an' the  ould man's mercy, is ut smilin' I feel whin I fall away an' go back to  Dinah Shadd, thryin' to carry ut all off as a joke? Not I! 'Tis hell to  me, dumb hell through ut all; an' next time whin the fit comes I will be  as bad again. Good cause the reg'ment has to know me for the best soldier  in ut. Better cause have I to know mesilf for the worst man. I'm only fit  to tache the new drafts what I'll niver learn mesilf; an' I am sure, as  tho' I heard ut, that the minut wan av these pink-eyed recruities gets  away from my 'Mind ye now,' an' 'Listen to this, Jim, bhoy,'--sure I am  that the sergint houlds me up to him for a warnin'. So I tache, as they  say at musketry-instruction, by direct and ricochet fire. Lord be good to  me, for I have stud some throuble!\"    \"Lie down and go to sleep,\" said I, not being able to comfort or advise.  \"You're the best man in the regiment, and, next to Ortheris, the biggest  fool. Lie down and wait till we're attacked. What force will they turn  out? Guns, think you?\"    \"Try that wid"]]]
