Further ministerial instructions will settle the application of      this decree.        \"7. The President of the War Cabinet, the Secretary of War, and the      Foreign Secretary are charged each in his own sphere to bring into      effect the present decree, which will be published in the _Bulletin des      Lois_ and inserted in the _Journal Officiel de la Republique      Francaise_.\"    In a covering letter, dated December 16, 1917, and addressed to M.  Poincare, the French Premier and the Foreign Secretary declared:        \"France has always supported by all means in her power the national      aspirations of the Czecho-Slovaks. The number of volunteers of this      nationality who at the outbreak of the war enlisted to fight under the      French flag was considerable; the gaps created in their ranks prove      unquestionably the ardour with which they fought against our enemies.        \"Certain Allied governments, especially the Russian Provisional      Government, did not hesitate to authorise the formation on our front of      units composed of Czecho-Slovaks who had escaped from the oppression of      their enemy.        \"It is only just that this nationality should be given means of      defending, under their own flag and side by side with us, the cause of      right and liberty of peoples, and it will be in accord with French      traditions to assist the organisation of an autonomous Czecho-Slovak      army.\"    Needless to say, the joy over this recognition was very great in Bohemia,  while the German papers were furious. The _Neue Freie Presse_ of December  28 devoted its leading article to the Czecho-Slovak army on the Western  front, and concluded with the following remarks:        \"Although the strength of this new army is estimated at 120,000 men,      the Czecho-Slovak army will not have a decisive influence on the      military operations. Nevertheless, it may do us considerable harm in      case we should transfer troops to the Western front. However, the      greatest harm is in the moral effect which this act of wholesale      treachery of the Czechs will have on the military power of the      monarchy. In any case the co-operation of the Czecho-Slovak army on the      side of the Entente will only strengthen the Allies' belief that right      is on their side.\"    Soon afterwards Italy also generously allowed an expeditionary corps of the  Czecho-Slovak army to be formed from the Czecho-Slovak prisoners of war who  surrendered to her. On May 23, 1918, the Czecho-Slovak troops welcomed the  Prince of Wales to Rome, and soon afterwards they distinguished themselves  on the Piave and were mentioned in one of General Diaz's dispatches and  also in the official Italian _communique_ of September 22, 1918.    From the recognition of the Czecho-Slovak army followed the full  recognition which the National Council obtained from the Allies.    4. While the general secretariat was actively working for these concessions  in the West, Professor Masaryk, after devoting his attention to the  education of public opinion in Great Britain on the importance of Bohemia,  by means of private memoranda and various articles in the _New Europe,  Weekly Dispatch_ and elsewhere, decided in May, 1917, to go to Russia.    In Russia, Professor Masaryk succeeded admirably in uniting and  strengthening all Czecho-Slovak forces, and in organising a regular army of  the many thousands of Czecho-Slovak prisoners there. As we have already  pointed out elsewhere, before the Revolution these efforts of the National  Council and the Czech prisoners, who were always eager to fight for the  Allies, were rendered immensely difficult by the obstacles inherent in the  geographic conditions of Russia and by obstacles placed in their way by the  old Russian regime.    Unfortunately now, when the Czecho-Slovaks had at last succeeded after much  work in realising their plans, the Czecho-Slovak army became powerless  owing to the collapse of Russia. Without ammunition, without support from  anywhere, the Czecho-Slovaks thought they could no more render very  effective service to the Allies in the East. They decided, therefore, to go  over to join their compatriots in France.    The position of our army was as follows: After the offensive of July, 1917,  the Czechs retreated to Kieff where they continued to concentrate fresh  forces. At that time they numbered about 60,000, and this number had  gradually increased to 80,000 by the end of 1917. They always observed  strict neutrality in Russia's internal affairs on the advice of their  venerable leader, Professor Masaryk. It was necessary to counsel this  neutrality for the sake of our army itself, since it contained partisans of  different creeds and parties disagreement among whom might have led to its  dissolution. On the whole, the Czecho-Slovaks, who are an advanced nation,  fully conscious of their national aspirations, remained unaffected by the  misleading Bolshevist theories. The Czechs abstained throughout from  interfering with Russian affairs, yet they did not wish to leave Russia as  long as there was any chance for them to assist her. It was not until the  shameful peace of Brest-Litovsk in February, 1918, that Professor Masaryk  decided that the Czecho-Slovak army should leave Russia _via_ Siberia and  join the Czecho-Slovak army in France. The Bolsheviks granted them free  passage to Vladivostok.    This journey of some 5000 miles was not, however, an easy task for an army  to accomplish. The troops had to move in small echelons or detachments, and  concentration at the stations was prohibited. They had to procure their  trains and their provisions, and they had constant trouble with the  Bolsheviks, because in every district there was a practically independent  Soviet Government with whom the Czechs had to negotiate. The first  detachments with the generalissimo of the army, General Diderichs, at the  head arrived in Vladivostok at the end of April, 1918. But the other  detachments were constantly held up by the Bolsheviks and had great trouble  in passing through.    They moved from Kieff _via_ Kursk, Tambov, Penza and Samara. The two  last-named towns lie on the line between Moscow and Tcheliabinsk at the  foot of the Urals, whence a direct line runs across Siberia to Vladivostok.    As we have already pointed out, the Bolsheviks agreed in principle to allow  our troops to leave Russia. Their commander-in-chief, General Muraviev,  allowed the Czechs free passage to France on February 16. The same  concession had been granted by the Moscow Soviet. On the whole the Czechs  were on tolerably good terms with the Bolsheviks. Professor Masaryk  rejected every plan directed against the Bolsheviks submitted to him even  by such of their political adversaries as could not justly be called  counter-revolutionaries. The Czecho-Slovak troops went still further; they  actually complied with the request of the Bolsheviks and partially  disarmed. The trouble only began in May, 1918, when the Bolsheviks yielded  to German intrigues and resolved to destroy our army.    Already at the beginning of May the Czechs had begun to feel embittered  against the Bolsheviks, because in defiance of the agreement their troops  were constantly being held up by local Soviets. At Tambov, for instance,  they were held up for a whole month. At Tcheliabinsk the Czechs had a  serious scuffle with Magyar ex-prisoners on May 26, and the Bolsheviks  sided entirely with the Magyars, even arresting some Czecho-Slovak  delegates. The Czechs simply occupied the city, liberated their comrades,  and at a congress held by them at Tcheliabinsk on May 28 it was decided to  refuse to surrender any more arms and ammunition and to continue transports  to Vladivostok, if necessary with arms in their hands. This was a reply to  Trotsky's telegram that the Czecho-Slovaks should be completely disarmed,  which the Czecho-Slovaks defied as they knew that another order had been  issued by Trotsky simultaneously, no doubt on the instigation of Count  Mirbach, saying that the Czecho-Slovak troops must be dissolved at all  costs and interned as prisoners of war. The Bolsheviks now arrested  prominent members of the Moscow branch of the Czecho-Slovak National  Council on the ground that they were \"anti-revolutionaries.\" They alleged  also that they had no guarantee that ships would be provided for the Czechs  to be transported to France, and that the Czechs were holding up food  supplies from Siberia. The Bolsheviks deliberately broke their word, and  Trotsky issued an order to \"all troops fighting against the  anti-revolutionary Czecho-Slovak brigades\" in which he said:        \"The concentration of our troops is complete. Our army being aware that      the Czecho-Slovaks are direct allies of the anti-revolution and of the      capitalists, fights them well. The Czecho-Slovaks are retreating along      the railway. Obviously they would like to enter into negotiations with      the Soviets. We issued an order that their delegates should be      received. We demand in the first place that they should be disarmed.      _Those who do not do so voluntarily will be shot on the spot._ Warlike      operations on the railway line hinder food transports. Energetic steps      must be taken to do away with this state of affairs.\"    The Czecho-Slovaks were greatly handicapped, since they were not only  almost unarmed, but were also dispersed along the trans-Siberian line in  small detachments which had considerable difficulty in keeping in touch  with each other. Nevertheless the fates were favourable to them. They were  victorious almost everywhere, thanks to their wonderful spirit and  discipline.

I grant it possible to find some actions, which seem to have no  regular connexion with any known motives, and are exceptions to all the  measures of conduct which have ever been established for the government  of men. But if we would willingly know what judgement should be formed  of such irregular and extraordinary actions, we may consider the  sentiments commonly entertained with regard to those irregular events  which appear in the course of nature, and the operations of external  objects. All causes are not conjoined to their usual effects with like  uniformity. An artificer, who handles only dead matter, may be  disappointed of his aim, as well as the politician, who directs the  conduct of sensible and intelligent agents.    The vulgar, who take things according to their first appearance,  attribute the uncertainty of events to such an uncertainty in the causes  as makes the latter often fail of their usual influence; though they  meet with no impediment in their operation. But philosophers, observing  that, almost in every part of nature, there is contained a vast variety  of springs and principles, which are hid, by reason of their minuteness  or remoteness, find, that it is at least possible the contrariety of  events may not proceed from any contingency in the cause, but from the  secret operation of contrary causes. This possibility is converted into  certainty by farther observation, when they remark that, upon an exact  scrutiny, a contrariety of effects always betrays a contrariety of  causes, and proceeds from their mutual opposition. A peasant can give no  better reason for the stopping of any clock or watch than to say that it  does not commonly go right: But an artist easily perceives that the same  force in the spring or pendulum has always the same influence on the  wheels; but fails of its usual effect, perhaps by reason of a grain of  dust, which puts a stop to the whole movement. From the observation of  several parallel instances, philosophers form a maxim that the connexion  between all causes and effects is equally necessary, and that its  seeming uncertainty in some instances proceeds from the secret  opposition of contrary causes.    Thus, for instance, in the human body, when the usual symptoms of health  or sickness disappoint our expectation; when medicines operate not with  their wonted powers; when irregular events follow from any particular  cause; the philosopher and physician are not surprised at the matter,  nor are ever tempted to deny, in general, the necessity and uniformity  of those principles by which the animal economy is conducted. They know  that a human body is a mighty complicated machine: That many secret  powers lurk in it, which are altogether beyond our comprehension: That  to us it must often appear very uncertain in its operations: And that  therefore the irregular events, which outwardly discover themselves, can  be no proof that the laws of nature are not observed with the greatest  regularity in its internal operations and government.    68. The philosopher, if he be consistent, must apply the same reasoning  to the actions and volitions of intelligent agents. The most irregular  and unexpected resolutions of men may frequently be accounted for by  those who know every particular circumstance of their character and  situation. A person of an obliging disposition gives a peevish answer:  But he has the toothache, or has not dined. A stupid fellow discovers an  uncommon alacrity in his carriage: But he has met with a sudden piece of  good fortune. Or even when an action, as sometimes happens, cannot be  particularly accounted for, either by the person himself or by others;  we know, in general, that the characters of men are, to a certain  degree, inconstant and irregular. This is, in a manner, the constant  character of human nature; though it be applicable, in a more particular  manner, to some persons who have no fixed rule for their conduct, but  proceed in a continued course of caprice and inconstancy. The internal  principles and motives may operate in a uniform manner, notwithstanding  these seeming irregularities; in the same manner as the winds, rain,  clouds, and other variations of the weather are supposed to be governed  by steady principles; though not easily discoverable by human sagacity  and enquiry.    69. Thus it appears, not only that the conjunction between motives and  voluntary actions is as regular and uniform as that between the cause  and effect in any part of nature; but also that this regular conjunction  has been universally acknowledged among mankind, and has never been the  subject of dispute, either in philosophy or common life. Now, as it is  from past experience that we draw all inferences concerning the future,  and as we conclude that objects will always be conjoined together which  we find to have always been conjoined; it may seem superfluous to prove  that this experienced uniformity in human actions is a source whence we  draw _inferences_ concerning them. But in order to throw the argument  into a greater variety of lights we shall also insist, though briefly,  on this latter topic.    The mutual dependence of men is so great in all societies that scarce  any human action is entirely complete in itself, or is performed without  some reference to the actions of others, which are requisite to make it  answer fully the intention of the agent. The poorest artificer, who  labours alone, expects at least the protection of the magistrate, to  ensure him the enjoyment of the fruits of his labour. He also expects  that, when he carries his goods to market, and offers them at a  reasonable price, he shall find purchasers, and shall be able, by the  money he acquires, to engage others to supply him with those commodities  which are requisite for his subsistence. In proportion as men extend  their dealings, and render their intercourse with others more  complicated, they always comprehend, in their schemes of life, a greater  variety of voluntary actions, which they expect, from the proper  motives, to co-operate with their own. In all these conclusions they  take their measures from past experience, in the same manner as in their  reasonings concerning external objects; and firmly believe that men, as  well as all the elements, are to continue, in their operations, the same  that they have ever found them. A manufacturer reckons upon the labour  of his servants for the execution of any work as much as upon the tools  which he employs, and would be equally surprised were his expectations  disappointed. In short, this experimental inference and reasoning  concerning the actions of others enters so much into human life that no  man, while awake, is ever a moment without employing it. Have we not  reason, therefore, to affirm that all mankind have always agreed in the  doctrine of necessity according to the foregoing definition and  explication of it?    70. Nor have philosophers ever entertained a different opinion from the  people in this particular. For, not to mention that almost every action  of their life supposes that opinion, there are even few of the  speculative parts of learning to which it is not essential. What would  become of _history,_ had we not a dependence on the veracity of the  historian according to the experience which we have had of mankind? How  could _politics_ be a science, if laws and forms of goverment had not a  uniform influence upon society? Where would be the foundation of  _morals,_ if particular characters had no certain or determinate power  to produce particular sentiments, and if these sentiments had no  constant operation on actions? And with what pretence could we employ  our _criticism_ upon any poet or polite author, if we could not  pronounce the conduct and sentiments of his actors either natural or  unnatural to such characters, and in such circumstances? It seems almost  impossible, therefore, to engage either in science or action of any kind  without acknowledging the doctrine of necessity, and this _inference_  from motive to voluntary actions, from characters to conduct.    And indeed, when we consider how aptly _natural_ and _moral_ evidence  link together, and form only one chain of argument, we shall make no  scruple to allow that they are of the same nature, and derived from the  same principles. A prisoner who has neither money nor interest,  discovers the impossibility of his escape, as well when he considers the  obstinacy of the gaoler, as the walls and bars with which he is  surrounded; and, in all attempts for his freedom, chooses rather to work  upon the stone and iron of the one, than upon the inflexible nature of  the other. The same prisoner, when conducted to the scaffold, foresees  his death as certainly from the constancy and fidelity of his guards, as  from the operation of the axe or wheel. His mind runs along a certain  train of ideas: The refusal of the soldiers to consent to his escape;  the action of the executioner; the separation of the head and body;  bleeding, convulsive motions, and death. Here is a connected chain of  natural causes and voluntary actions; but the mind feels no difference  between them in passing from one link to another: Nor is less certain of  the future event than if it were connected with the objects present to  the memory or senses, by a train of causes, cemented together by what we  are pleased to call a _physical_ necessity. The same experienced union  has the same effect on the mind, whether the united objects be motives,  volition, and actions; or figure and motion. We may change the name of  things; but their nature and their operation on the understanding  never change.    Were a man,"]]]
