There are dead soldiers in the ditches, Mexican  non-combatants lying dead in the streets--and buzzards everywhere! It's  reported that Campo, the rebel leader, is on the way up from Sinaloa,  and Huerta, a federal general, is coming to relieve the garrison. I  don't take much stock in reports.  But there's hell in Casita, all  right.\"    \"Do you think we'll have trouble out here?\" asked Dick, excitedly.    \"Sure.  Some kind of trouble sooner or later,\" replied Belding,  gloomily.  \"Why, you can stand on my ranch and step over into Mexico.  Laddy says we'll lose horses and other stock in night raids. Jim Lash  doesn't look for any worse.  But Jim isn't as well acquainted with  Greasers as I am.  Anyway, my boy, as soon as you can hold a bridle and  a gun you'll be on the job, don't mistake me.\"    \"With Laddy and Jim?\" asked Dick, trying to be cool.    \"Sure.  With them and me, and by yourself.\"    Dick drew a deep breath, and even after Belding had departed he forgot  for a moment about the letter in his hand.  Then he unfolded the paper  and read:      Dear Dick,--You've more than saved my life.  To the end of my days  you'll be the one man to whom I owe everything.  Words fail to express  my feelings.    This must be a brief note.  Belding is waiting, and I used up most of  the time writing to Mercedes.  I like Belding.  He was not unknown to  me, though I never met or saw him before.  You'll be interested to  learn that he's the unadulterated article, the real Western goods.  I've heard of some of his stunts, and they made my hair curl.  Dick,  your luck is staggering.  The way Belding spoke of you was great.  But  you deserve it, old man.    I'm leaving Mercedes in your charge, subject, of course, to advice from  Belding.  Take care of her, Dick, for my life is wrapped up in her.  By  all means keep her from being seen by Mexicans.  We are sitting tight  here--nothing doing.  If some action doesn't come soon, it'll be darned  strange.  Things are centering this way. There's scrapping right along,  and people have begun to move. We're still patrolling the line eastward  of Casita.  It'll be impossible to keep any tab on the line west of  Casita, for it's too rough.  That cactus desert is awful. Cowboys or  rangers with desert-bred horses might keep raiders and smugglers from  crossing. But if cavalrymen could stand that waterless wilderness,  which I doubt much, their horses would drop under them.    If things do quiet down before my commission expires, I'll get leave of  absence, run out to Forlorn River, marry my beautiful Spanish princess,  and take her to a civilized country, where, I opine, every son of a gun  who sees her will lose his head, and drive me mad.  It's my great luck,  old pal, that you are a fellow who never seemed to care about pretty  girls.  So you won't give me the double cross and run off with  Mercedes--carry her off, like the villain in the play, I mean.    That reminds me of Rojas.  Oh, Dick, it was glorious!  You didn't do  anything to the Dandy Rebel!  Not at all!  You merely caressed  him--gently moved him to one side.  Dick, harken to these glad words:  Rojas is in the hospital.  I was interested to inquire. He had a  smashed finger, a dislocated collar bone, three broken ribs, and a  fearful gash on his face.  He'll be in the hospital for a month.  Dick,  when I meet that pig-headed dad of yours I'm going to give him the  surprise of his life.    Send me a line whenever any one comes in from F. R., and inclose  Mercedes's letter in yours.  Take care of her, Dick, and may the future  hold in store for you some of the sweetness I know now!    Faithfully yours, Thorne.      Dick reread the letter, then folded it and placed it under his pillow.    \"Never cared for pretty girls, huh?\" he soliloquized.  \"George, I never  saw any till I struck Southern Arizona! Guess I'd better make up for  lost time.\"    While he was eating his supper, with appetite rapidly returning to  normal, Ladd and Jim came in, bowing their tall heads to enter the  door.  Their friendly advances were singularly welcome to Gale, but he  was still backward.  He allowed himself to show that he was glad to see  them, and he listened.  Jim Lash had heard from Belding the result of  the mauling given to Rojas by Dick.  And Jim talked about what a grand  thing that was.  Ladd had a good deal to say about Belding's horses.  It took no keen judge of human nature to see that horses constituted  Ladd's ruling passion.    \"I've had wimmen go back on me, but never no hoss!\" declared Ladd, and  manifestly that was a controlling truth with him.    \"Shore it's a cinch Beldin' is agoin' to lose some of them hosses,\" he  said.  \"You can search me if I don't think there'll be more doin' on  the border here than along the Rio Grande.  We're just the same as on  Greaser soil.  Mebbe we don't stand no such chance of bein' shot up as  we would across the line.  But who's goin' to give up his hosses  without a fight?  Half the time when Beldin's stock is out of the  alfalfa it's grazin' over the line.  He thinks he's careful about them  hosses, but he ain't.\"    \"Look a-here, Laddy; you cain't believe all you hear,\" replied Jim,  seriously.  \"I reckon we mightn't have any trouble.\"    \"Back up, Jim.  Shore you're standin' on your bridle.  I ain't goin'  much on reports.  Remember that American we met in Casita, the  prospector who'd just gotten out of Sonora?  He had some story, he had.  Swore he'd killed seventeen Greasers breakin' through the rebel line  round the mine where he an' other Americans were corralled.  The next  day when I met him again, he was drunk, an' then he told me he'd shot  thirty Greasers.  The chances are he did kill some.  But reports are  exaggerated.  There are miners fightin' for life down in Sonora, you  can gamble on that.  An' the truth is bad enough.  Take Rojas's  harryin' of the Senorita, for instance.  Can you beat that?  Shore,  Jim, there's more doin' than the raidin' of a few hosses.  An' Forlorn  River is goin' to get hers!\"    Another dawn found Gale so much recovered that he arose and looked  after himself, not, however, without considerable difficulty and rather  disheartening twinges of pain.    Some time during the morning he heard the girls in the patio and called  to ask if he might join them.  He received one response, a mellow, \"Si,  Senor.\"  It was not as much as he wanted, but considering that it was  enough, he went out.  He had not as yet visited the patio, and surprise  and delight were in store for him.  He found himself lost in a  labyrinth of green and rose-bordered walks.  He strolled around,  discovering that the patio was a courtyard, open at an end; but he  failed to discover the young ladies.  So he called again.  The answer  came from the center of the square.  After stooping to get under shrubs  and wading through bushes he entered an open sandy circle, full of  magnificent and murderous cactus plants, strange to him.  On the other  side, in the shade of a beautiful tree, he found the girls. Mercedes  sitting in a hammock, Nell upon a blanket.    \"What a beautiful tree!\" he exclaimed.  \"I never saw one like that.  What is it?\"    \"Palo verde,\" replied Nell.    \"Senor, palo verde means 'green tree,'\" added Mercedes.    This desert tree, which had struck Dick as so new and strange and  beautiful, was not striking on account of size, for it was small,  scarcely reaching higher than the roof; but rather because of its  exquisite color of green, trunk and branch alike, and owing to the odd  fact that it seemed not to possess leaves.  All the tree from ground to  tiny flat twigs was a soft polished green.  It bore no thorns.    Right then and there began Dick's education in desert growths; and he  felt that even if he had not had such charming teachers he would still  have been absorbed.  For the patio was full of desert wonders.  A  twisting-trunked tree with full foliage of small gray leaves Nell  called a mesquite.  Then Dick remembered the name, and now he saw where  the desert got its pale-gray color. A huge, lofty, fluted column of  green was a saguaro, or giant cactus.  Another oddshaped cactus,  resembling the legs of an inverted devil-fish, bore the name ocatillo.  Each branch rose high and symmetrical, furnished with sharp blades that  seemed to be at once leaves and thorns.  Yet another cactus interested  Gale, and it looked like a huge, low barrel covered with green-ribbed  cloth and long thorns.  This was the bisnaga, or barrel cactus.  According to Nell and Mercedes, this plant was a happy exception to its  desert neighbors, for it secreted water which had many times saved the  lives of men.  Last of the cacti to attract Gale, and the one to make  him shiver, was a low plant, consisting of stem and many rounded  protuberances of a frosty, steely white, and covered with long  murderous spikes. From this plant the desert got its frosty glitter.  It was as stiff, as unyielding as steel, and bore the name choya.    Dick's enthusiasm was contagious, and his earnest desire to learn was  flattering to his teachers.  When it came to assimilating Spanish,  however, he did not appear to be so apt a pupil.  He managed, after  many trials, to acquire \"buenos dias\" and \"buenos tardes,\" and  \"senorita\" and \"gracias,\" and a few other short terms. Dick was indeed  eager to get a little smattering of Spanish, and perhaps he was not  really quite so stupid as he pretended to be. It was delightful to be  taught by a beautiful Spaniard who was so gracious and intense and  magnetic of personality, and by a sweet American girl who moment by  moment forgot her shyness.  Gale wished to prolong the lessons.    So that was the beginning of many afternoons in which he learned desert  lore and Spanish verbs, and something else that he dared not name.    Nell Burton had never shown to Gale that daring side of her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/503"],[0,"The Blue Fairy Book (#17)"],[1,"the Princess rose earlier than she had done since she had  been carried into Africa by the magician, whose company she was forced  to endure once a day. She, however, treated him so harshly that he dared  not live there altogether. As she was dressing, one of her women looked  out and saw Aladdin. The Princess ran and opened the window, and at the  noise she made Aladdin looked up. She called to him to come to her, and  great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again. After he  had kissed her Aladdin said: \"I beg of you, Princess, in God's name,  before we speak of anything else, for your own sake and mine, tell me  that has become of an old lamp I left on the cornice in the hall of  four-and-twenty windows, when I went a-hunting.\" \"Alas!\" she said, \"I am  the innocent cause of our sorrows,\" and told him of the exchange of the  lamp. \"Now I know,\" cried Aladdin, \"that we have to thank the African  magician for this! Where is the lamp?\" \"He carries it about with him,\"  said the Princess. \"I know, for he pulled it out of his breast to show  me. He wishes me to break my faith with you and marry him, saying that  you were beheaded by my father's command. He is for ever speaking ill of  you but I only reply by my tears. If I persist, I doubt not but he  will use violence.\" Aladdin comforted her, and left her for a while.  He changed clothes with the first person he met in the town, and having  bought a certain powder, returned to the Princess, who let him in by  a little side door. \"Put on your most beautiful dress,\" he said to her  \"and receive the magician with smiles, leading him to believe that you  have forgotten me. Invite him to sup with you, and say you wish to taste  the wine of his country. He will go for some and while he is gone I will  tell you what to do.\" She listened carefully to Aladdin and when he left  she arrayed herself gaily for the first time since she left China. She  put on a girdle and head-dress of diamonds, and, seeing in a glass that  she was more beautiful than ever, received the magician, saying, to his  great amazement: \"I have made up my mind that Aladdin is dead, and that  all my tears will not bring him back to me, so I am resolved to mourn no  more, and have therefore invited you to sup with me; but I am tired of  the wines of China, and would fain taste those of Africa.\" The magician  flew to his cellar, and the Princess put the powder Aladdin had given  her in her cup. When he returned she asked him to drink her health in  the wine of Africa, handing him her cup in exchange for his, as a sign  she was reconciled to him. Before drinking the magician made her a  speech in praise of her beauty, but the Princess cut him short, saying:  \"Let us drink first, and you shall say what you will afterward.\" She set  her cup to her lips and kept it there, while the magician drained his to  the dregs and fell back lifeless. The Princess then opened the door to  Aladdin, and flung her arms round his neck; but Aladdin put her away,  bidding her leave him, as he had more to do. He then went to the dead  magician, took the lamp out of his vest, and bade the genie carry the  palace and all in it back to China. This was done, and the Princess in  her chamber only felt two little shocks, and little thought she was at  home again.    The Sultan, who was sitting in his closet, mourning for his lost  daughter, happened to look up, and rubbed his eyes, for there stood the  palace as before! He hastened thither, and Aladdin received him in the  hall of the four-and-twenty windows, with the Princess at his side.  Aladdin told him what had happened, and showed him the dead body of the  magician, that he might believe. A ten days' feast was proclaimed, and  it seemed as if Aladdin might now live the rest of his life in peace;  but it was not to be.    The African magician had a younger brother, who was, if possible, more  wicked and more cunning than himself. He traveled to China to avenge his  brother's death, and went to visit a pious woman called Fatima, thinking  she might be of use to him. He entered her cell and clapped a dagger to  her breast, telling her to rise and do his bidding on pain of death. He  changed clothes with her, colored his face like hers, put on her veil,  and murdered her, that she might tell no tales. Then he went toward the  palace of Aladdin, and all the people, thinking he was the holy woman,  gathered round him, kissing his hands and begging his blessing. When  he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round him that  the Princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask what was the  matter. The slave said it was the holy woman, curing people by her touch  of their ailments, whereupon the Princess, who had long desired to see  Fatima, sent for her. On coming to the Princess the magician offered up  a prayer for her health and prosperity. When he had done the Princess  made him sit by her, and begged him to stay with her always. The false  Fatima, who wished for nothing better, consented, but kept his veil down  for fear of discovery. The Princess showed him the hall, and asked him  what he thought of it. \"It is truly beautiful,\" said the false Fatima.  \"In my mind it wants but one thing.\" \"And what is that?\" said the  Princess. \"If only a roc's egg,\" replied he, \"were hung up from the  middle of this dome, it would be the wonder of the world.\"    After this the Princess could think of nothing but the roc's egg, and  when Aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a very ill humor. He  begged to know what was amiss, and she told him that all her pleasure in  the hall was spoiled for the want of a roc's egg hanging from the dome.  \"If that is all,\" replied Aladdin, \"you shall soon be happy.\" He left  her and rubbed the lamp, and when the genie appeared commanded him to  bring a roc's egg. The genie gave such a loud and terrible shriek that  the hall shook. \"Wretch!\" he cried, \"is it not enough that I have done  everything for you, but you must command me to bring my master and hang  him up in the midst of this dome? You and your wife and your palace  deserve to be burnt to ashes, but that this request does not come from  you, but from the brother of the African magician, whom you destroyed.  He is now in your palace disguised as the holy woman--whom he murdered.  He it was who put that wish into your wife's head. Take care of  yourself, for he means to kill you.\" So saying, the genie disappeared.    Aladdin went back to the Princess, saying his head ached, and requesting  that the holy Fatima should be fetched to lay her hands on it. But when  the magician came near, Aladdin, seizing his dagger, pierced him to the  heart. \"What have you done?\" cried the Princess. \"You have killed the  holy woman!\" \"Not so,\" replied Aladdin, \"but a wicked magician,\" and  told her of how she had been deceived.    After this Aladdin and his wife lived in peace. He succeeded the Sultan  when he died, and reigned for many years, leaving behind him a long line  of kings.(1)      (1) Arabian Nights.          THE TALE OF A YOUTH WHO SET OUT TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS      A father had two sons, of whom the eldest was clever and bright, and  always knew what he was about; but the youngest was stupid, and  couldn't learn or understand anything. So much so that those who saw him  exclaimed: \"What a burden he'll be to his father!\" Now when there was  anything to be done, the eldest had always to do it; but if something  was required later or in the night-time, and the way led through the  churchyard or some such ghostly place, he always replied: \"Oh! no,  father: nothing will induce me to go there, it makes me shudder!\" for  he was afraid. Or, when they sat of an evening around the fire telling  stories which made one's flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said:  \"Oh! it makes one shudder,\" the youngest sat in a corner, heard the  exclamation, and could not understand what it meant. \"They are always  saying it makes one shudder! it makes one shudder! Nothing makes me  shudder. It's probably an art quite beyond me.\"    Now it happened that his father said to him one day: \"Hearken, you there  in the corner; you are growing big and strong, and you must learn to  earn your own bread. Look at your brother, what pains he takes; but  all the money I've spent on your education is thrown away.\" \"My dear  father,\" he replied, \"I will gladly learn--in fact, if it were possible  I should like to learn to shudder; I don't understand that a bit yet.\"  The eldest laughed when he heard this, and thought to himself: \"Good  heavens! what a ninny my brother is! he'll never come to any good;  as the twig is bent, so is the tree inclined.\" The father sighed, and  answered him: \"You'll soon learn to shudder; but that won't help you to  make a living.\"    Shortly after this, when the sexton came to pay them a visit, the father  broke out to him, and told him what a bad hand his youngest son was at  everything: he knew nothing and learned nothing. \"Only think! when I  asked him how he purposed gaining a livelihood, he actually asked to be  taught to shudder.\" \"If that's all he wants,\" said the sexton, \"I can  teach him that; just you send him to me, I'll soon polish him up.\" The  father was quite pleased with the proposal, because he thought: \"It will  be a good discipline for the youth.\" And so the sexton took him into his  house, and his duty was to toll the bell. After a few days he woke him  at midnight, and bade him rise and climb into the tower and toll.  \"Now, my friend, I'll teach you to shudder,\" thought he. He stole forth  secretly in front, and when the youth was up above, and had turned  round to grasp the bell-rope, he saw, standing opposite the hole of the  belfry, a white figure. \"Who's there?\" he called out, but the figure  gave no answer, and neither stirred nor moved. \"Answer,\" cried the  youth, \"or begone; you have no business here at this hour of the night.\"  But the sexton "]]]
