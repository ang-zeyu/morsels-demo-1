And yet there were two  cabs, and a quantity of luggage. Did they not come?\"    Georgie gave a respectably accurate account of all that had happened,  omitting the fact of his terror when first he awoke, for that was not  really a happening, and had had no effect on his subsequent  proceedings. He also omitted the adventure about his hair, for that was  quite extraneous, and said what fun they had all had over their supper  at half past two this morning.    \"I think you were marvellously brave, Georgie,\" said she, \"and most  good natured. You must have been sending out love, and so were full of  it yourself, and that casts out fear.\"    She spread the music open.    \"Anything else?\" she asked.    Georgie took his seat and put his rings on the candle-bracket.    \"Oh yes,\" he said, \"Olga Bracely, the prima-donna, you know, and her  husband are arriving at the Ambermere Arms this afternoon for a couple  of days.\"    The old fire kindled.    \"No!\" exclaimed Lucia. \"Then they'll be here for my party tomorrow.  Fancy if she would come and sing for us! I shall certainly leave cards  today, and write later in the evening, asking her.\"    \"I have been asked to go and see her,\" said Georgie, not proudly.    The music rest fell down with a loud slap, but Lucia paid no attention.    \"Let us go together then,\" she said. \"Who asked you to call on her?\"    \"Lady Ambermere,\" said he.    \"When she was in here yesterday? She never mentioned it to me. But she  would certainly think it very odd of me not to call on friends of hers,  and be polite to them. What time shall we go?\"    Georgie made up his mind that wild horses should not drag from him the  fact that Olga's husband's name was Shuttleworth, for here was Lucia  grabbing at his discovery, just as she had grabbed at Daisy's discovery  who was now \"her Guru.\" She should call him Mr Bracely then.    \"Somewhere about six, do you think?\" said he, inwardly raging.    He looked up and distinctly saw that sharp foxy expression cross  Lucia's face, which from long knowledge of her he knew to betoken that  she had thought of some new plan. But she did not choose to reveal it  and re-erected the music-rest.    \"That will do beautifully,\" she said. \"And now for our heavenly Mozart.  You must be patient with me, Georgie, for you know how badly I read.  _Caro!_ How difficult it looks. I am frightened! Lucia never saw  such a dwefful thing to read!\"    And it had been those very bars, which Georgie had heard through the  open window just now.    \"Georgie's is much more dwefful!\" he said, remembering the double sharp  that came in the second bar. \"Georgie fwightened too at reading it.  O-o-h,\" and he gave a little scream. \"Cattivo Mozart to wite anything  so dwefful diffy!\"    It was quite clear at the class this morning that though the pupils  were quite interested in the abstract messages of love which they were  to shoot out in all directions, and in the atmosphere of peace with  which they were to surround themselves, the branch of the subject which  thrilled them to the marrow was the breathing exercises and contortions  which, if persevered in, would give them youth and activity, faultless  digestions and indefatigable energy. They all sat on the floor, and  stopped up alternate nostrils, and held their breath till Mrs Quantock  got purple in the face, and Georgie and Lucia red, and expelled their  breath again with sudden puffs that set the rushes on the floor  quivering, or with long quiet exhalations. Then there were certain  postures to be learned, in one of which, entailing the bending of the  body backwards, two of Georgie's trouser-buttons came off with a sharp  snap and he felt the corresponding member of his braces, thus violently  released, spring up to his shoulder. Various other embarrassing noises  issued from Lucia and Daisy that sounded like the bursting of strings  and tapes, but everybody pretended to hear nothing at all, or covered  up the report of those explosions with coughings and clearings of the  throat. But apart from these discordances, everything was fairly  harmonious indeed, so far from Daisy introducing discords, she wore a  fixed smile, which it would have been purely cynical to call superior,  when Lucia asked some amazingly simple question with regard to Om. She  sighed too, at intervals, but these sighs were expressive of nothing  but patience and resignation, till Lucia's ignorance of the most  elementary doctrines was enlightened, and though she rather pointedly  looked in any direction but hers, and appeared completely unaware of  her presence, she had not, after all, come here to look at Lucia, but  to listen to her own (whatever Lucia might say) Guru.    At the end Lucia, with her far-away look, emerged, you might say, in a  dazed condition from hearing about the fastness of Thibet, where the  Guru had been in commune with the Guides, whose wisdom he interpreted  to them.    \"I feel such a difference already,\" she said dreamily. \"I feel as if I  could never be hasty or worried any more at all. Don't you experience  that, dear Daisy?\"    \"Yes, dear,\" said she. \"I went through all that at my first lesson.  Didn't I, Guru dear?\"    \"I felt it too,\" said Georgie, unwilling not to share in these  benefits, and surreptitiously tightening his trouser-strap to  compensate for the loss of buttons. \"And am I to do that swaying  exercise before every meal?\"    \"Yes, Georgie,\" said Lucia, saving her Guru from the trouble of  answering. \"Five times to the right and five times to the left and then  five times backwards and forwards. I felt so young and light just now  when we did it that I thought I was rising into the air. Didn't you,  Daisy?\"    Daisy smiled kindly.    \"No, dear, that is levitation,\" she said, \"and comes a very long way  on.\"    She turned briskly towards her Guru.    \"Will you tell them about that time when you levitated at Paddington  Station?\" she said. \"Or will you keep that for when Mrs Lucas gets  rather further on? You must be patient, dear Lucia; we all have to go  through the early stages, before we get to that.\"    Mrs Quantock spoke as if she was in the habit of levitating herself,  and it was but reasonable, in spite of the love that was swirling about  them all, that Lucia should protest against such an attitude. Humility,  after all, was the first essential to progress on the Way.    \"Yes, dear,\" she said. \"We will tread these early stages together, and  encourage each other.\"    Georgie went home, feeling also unusually light and hungry, for he had  paid special attention to the exercise that enabled him to have his  liver and digestive organs in complete control, but that did not  prevent him from devoting his mind to arriving at that which had made  Lucia look so sharp and foxy during their conversation about Olga  Bracely. He felt sure that she was meaning to steal a march on him, and  she was planning to draw first blood with the prima-donna, and, as  likely as not, claim her for her own, with the same odious greed as she  was already exhibiting with regard to the Guru. All these years Georgie  had been her faithful servant and coadjutor; now for the first time the  spirit of independence had begun to seethe within him. The scales were  falling from his eyes, and just as he turned into shelter of his  mulberry-tree, he put on his spectacles to see how Riseholme was  getting on without him to assist at the morning parliament. His absence  and Mrs Quantock's would be sure to evoke comment, and since the Yoga  classes were always to take place at half-past twelve, the fact that  they would never be there, would soon rise to the level of a  first-class mystery. It would, of course, begin to leak out that  they and Lucia were having a course of Eastern philosophy that made  its pupils young and light and energetic, and there was a sensation!    Like all great discoveries, the solution of Lucia's foxy look broke on  him with the suddenness of a lightning-flash, and since it had been  settled that she should call for him at six, he stationed himself in  the window of his bathroom, which commanded a perfect view of the  village green and the entrance to the Ambermere Arms at five. He had  brought up with him a pair of opera-glasses, with the intention of  taking them to bits, so he had informed Foljambe, and washing their  lenses, but he did not at once proceed about this, merely holding them  ready to hand for use. Hermy and Ursy had gone back to their golf again  after lunch, and so callers would be told that they were all out. Thus  he could wash the lenses, when he chose to do so, uninterrupted.    The minutes passed on pleasantly enough, for there was plenty going on.  The two Miss Antrobuses frisked about the green, jumping over the  stocks in their playful way, and running round the duck-pond in the  eternal hope of attracting Colonel Boucher's attention to their pretty  nimble movements. For many years past, they had tried to gain Georgie's  serious attention, without any result, and lately they had turned to  Colonel Boucher. There was Mrs Antrobus there, too, with her ham-like  face and her ear-trumpet, and Mrs Weston was being pushed round and  round the asphalt path below the elms in her bath-chair. She hated  going slow, and her gardener and his boy took turns with her during her  hour's carriage exercise, and propelled her, amid streams of  perspiration, at a steady four miles an hour. As she passed Mrs  Antrobus she shouted something at her, and Mrs Antrobus returned her  reply, when next she came round.    Suddenly all these interesting objects vanished completely from  Georgie's ken, for his dark suspicions were confirmed, and there was  Lucia in her \"Hightum\" hat and her \"Hightum\" gown making her gracious  way across the green. She had distinctly been wearing one of the  \"Scrub\" this morning at the class, so she "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6841"],[0,"Mosaics of Grecian History (#17)"],[1,"e.      And I remember how Antaeus heard,    Deep in great oak-woods, the mysterious word    Which said, \"Go forth across the unshaven leas    To meet unconquerable Hercules.\"    Leaving his cavern by the cedar-glen,    This Titan of the primal race of men,    Whom the swart lions feared, and who could tear    Huge oaks asunder, to the combat bare    Courage undaunted. Full of giant grace,    Built up, as 'twere, from earth's own granite base.    Colossal, iron-sinewed, firm he trod    The lawns. How vain against a demi-god!    Oh, sorrow of defeat! He plunges far    Into his forests, where deep shadows are,    And the wind's murmur comes not, and the gloom    Of pine and cedar seems to make a tomb    For fallen ambition. Prone the mortal lies    Who dared mad warfare with the unpitying skies,    But lo! as buried in the waving ferns,    The baffled giant for oblivion yearns,    Cursing his human feebleness, he feels    A sudden impulse of new strength, which heals    His angry wounds; his vigor he regains--    His blood is dancing gayly through his veins.    Fresh power, fresh life is his who lay at rest    On bounteous Hertha's kind creative breast.    [Footnote: Hertha, a goddess of the ancient Germans,    the same as Terra, or the Earth. Her favorite retreat    was a sacred grove in an island of the ocean.]      Even so, O poet, by the world subdued,    Regain thy health 'mid perfect solitude.    In noisy cities, far from hills and trees,    The brawling demi-god, harsh Hercules,    Has power to hurt thy placid spirit--power    To crush thy joyous instincts every hour,    To weary thee with woes for mortals stored,    Red gold (coined hatred) and the tyrant's sword.      Then--then, O sad Antaeus, wilt thou yearn    For dense green woodlands and the fragrant fern;    Then stretch thy form upon the sward, and rest    From worldly toil on Hertha's gracious breast;    Plunge in the foaming river, or divide    With happy arms gray ocean's murmuring tide,    And drinking thence each solitary hour    Immortal beauty and immortal power,    Thou may'st the buffets of the world efface    And live a Titan of earth's earliest race.      --MORTIMER COLLINS.      THE ARGONAUTIC EXPEDITION.    From what was probably a maritime adventure that plundered some  wealthy country at a period when navigation was in its infancy  among the Greeks, we get the fable of the Argonautic Expedition.  The generally accepted story of this expedition is as follows:  Pe'lias, a descendant of AE'o-lus, the mystic progenitor of the  Great AEol'ic race, had deprived his half-brother AE'son of the  kingdom of Iol'cus in Thessaly. When Jason, son of AEson, had  attained to manhood, he appeared before his uncle and demanded  the throne. Pelias consented only on condition that Jason should  first capture and bring to him the golden fleece of the ram which  had carried Phrix'us and Hel'le when they fled from their stepmother  I'no. Helle dropped into the sea between Sigae'um and the  Cher'sonese, which was named from her Hellespon'tus; but Phrixus  succeeded in reaching Col'chis, a country at the eastern extremity  of the Euxine, or Black Sea. Here he sacrificed the ram, and  nailed the fleece to an oak in the grove of Mars, where it was  guarded by a sleepless dragon.    Joined by the principal heroes of Greece, Hercules among the  number, Jason set sail from Iolcus in the ship Argo, after first  invoking the favor of Jupiter, the winds, and the waves, for the  success of the expedition. The ceremony on this occasion, as  descried by the poets, reads like an account of the \"christening  of the ship\" in modern times, but we seem to have lost the full  significance of the act.      And soon as by the vessel's bow    The anchor was hung up,    Then took the leader on the prow    In hands a golden cup,    And on great father Jove did call;    And on the winds and waters all    Swept by the hurrying blast,    And on the nights, and ocean ways,    And on the fair auspicious days,    And sweet return at last.      From out the clouds, in answer kind,    A voice of thunder came,    And, shook in glistening beams around,    Burst out the lightning flame.    The chiefs breathed free, and, at the sign,    Trusted in the power divine.    Hinting sweet hopes, the seer cried    Forthwith their oars to ply,    And swift went backward from rough hands    The rowing ceaselessly.      --PINDAR. Trans. by Rev. H. F. CARY.    After many adventures Jason reached Col'chis, where, by the aid  of magic and supernatural arts, and through the favor of Me-de'a,  daughter of the King of Colchis, he succeeded in capturing the  fleece. After four months of continued danger and innumerable  hardships, Jason returned to Iolcus with the prize, accompanied  by Medea, whom he afterward deserted, and whose subsequent history  is told by the poet Euripides in his celebrated tragedy entitled  Medea.    Growing out of the Argonautic legend is one concerning the youth  Hy'las, a member of the expedition, and a son of the King of  Mys'ia, a country of Asia Minor. Hylas was greatly beloved by  Hercules. On the coast of Mysia the Argonauts stopped to obtain  a supply of water, and Hylas, having gone from the vessel alone  with an urn for the same purpose, takes the opportunity to bathe  in the river Scaman'der, under the shadows of Mount Ida. He throws  his purple chlamys, or cloak, over the urn, and passes down into  the water, where he is seized by the nymphs of the stream, and, in  spite of his struggles and entreaties, he is borne by them \"down  from the noonday brightness to their dark caves in the depths  below.\" Hercules went in search of Hylas, and the ship sailed  from its anchorage without him. We have a faithful and beautiful  reproduction of this Greek legend, both in theme and spirit, in  a poem by BAYARD TAYLOR, from which the following extracts are  taken:      Hylas.      Storm-wearied Argo slept upon the water.    No cloud was seen: on blue and craggy Ida    The hot noon lay, and on the plains enamel;    Cool in his bed, alone, the swift Scamander.    \"Why should I haste?\" said young and rosy Hylas;    The seas are rough, and long the way from Colchis.    Beneath the snow-white awning slumbers Jason,    Pillowed upon his tame Thessalian panther;    The shields are piled, the listless oars suspended    On the black thwarts, and all the hairy bondsmen    Doze on the benches. They may wait for water    Till I have bathed in mountain-born Scamander.\"      He saw his glorious limbs reversely mirrored    In the still wave, and stretched his foot to press it    On the smooth sole that answered at the surface:    Alas! the shape dissolved in glittering fragments.    Then, timidly at first, he dipped, and catching    Quick breath, with tingling shudder, as the waters    Swirled round his limbs, and deeper, slowly deeper,    Till on his breast the river's cheek was pillowed;    And deeper still, till every shoreward ripple    Talked in his ear, and like a cygnet's bosom    His white, round shoulder shed the dripping crystal.      There, as he floated with a rapturous motion,    The lucid coolness folding close around him,    The lily-cradling ripples murmured, \"Hylas!\"    He shook from off his ears the hyacinthine    Curls that had lain unwet upon the water,    And still the ripples murmured, \"Hylas! Hylas!\"    He thought--\"The voices are but ear-born music.    Pan dwells not here, and Echo still is calling    From some high cliff that tops a Thracian valley;    So long mine ears, on tumbling Hellespontus,    Have heard the sea-waves hammer Argo's forehead,    That I misdeem the fluting of this current    For some lost nymph\"--again the murmur, \"Hylas!\"    The sound that seemed to come from the lilies was the voice of  the sea-nymphs, calling to him to go with them where they wander--      \"Down beneath the green translucent ceiling--    Where, on the sandy bed of old Scamander,    With cool white buds we braid our purple tresses,    Lulled by the bubbling waves around us stealing.\"    To all their entreaties Hylas exclaims:                                  \"Leave me, naiads!    Leave me!\" he cried. \"The day to me is dearer    Than all your caves deep-spread in ocean's quiet.    I would not change this flexile, warm existence,    Though swept by storms, and shocked by Jove's dread thunder,    To be a king beneath the dark-green waters.    Let me return! the wind comes down from Ida,    And soon the galley, stirring from her slumber,    Will fret to ride where Pelion's twilight shadow    Falls o'er the towers of Jason's sea-girt city.    I am not yours--I cannot braid the lilies    In your wet hair, nor on your argent bosoms    Close my drowsed eyes to hear your rippling voices.    Hateful to me your sweet, cold, crystal being--    Your world of watery quiet. Help, Apollo!\"    But the remonstrances and struggles of Hylas unavailing:      The boy's blue eyes, upturned, looked through the water    Pleading for help; but heaven's immortal archer;    Was swathed in cloud. The ripples hid his forehead;    And last, the thick, bright curls a moment floated,    So warm and silky that the stream upbore them,    Closing reluctant as he sank forever.    The sunset died behind the crags of Imbros.    Argo was tugging at her chain; for freshly    Blew the swift breeze, and leaped the restless billows.    The voice of Jason roused the dozing sailors,    And up the mast was heaved the snowy canvas.    But mighty Hercules, the Jove-begotten,    Unmindful stood beside the cool Scamander,    Leaning upon his club. A purple chlamys    Tossed o'er an urn was all that lay before him;    And when he called, expectant, \"Hylas! Hylas!\"    The empty echoes made him answer--\"Hylas!\"      THE TROJAN WAR.
