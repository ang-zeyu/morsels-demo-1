However, I was really  very glad to hear this news, and congratulated her with genuine  feeling.    The knowledge that she was a promised woman quite altered my feelings  towards her, and before I quite meant to, I had told her a considerable  amount about Zoe. It gave me much relief to be able to unburden myself,  and confide my difficulties elsewhere than in the pages of this  journal.    I have asked the girl to tea to-morrow.           *       *       *       *       *    A vile air raid last night. British machines, of course. They seemed  determined to get over the town, and from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. relays of  machines (of which not _one_ was shot down) attacked us. The din was  tremendous, and all sleep was out of the question.    Morning revealed surprisingly little damage, as is often the case in  these big raids, whereas a few bombs from a chance machine often work  havoc. I was down at 50 B.C. aerodrome this morning, and heard that as  soon as the moon suits we are going to make Dunkirk sit up as  retaliation for last night's efforts. There were also rumours of big  attacks impending on London as soon as the new type of Gothas are  delivered. That will shake the smug security of those cursed islanders.    Rosa came to tea, and afterwards I told her more about Zoe, and as I  expect any day to be appointed to the periscope school at Kiel, I asked  Rosa to try and effect an introduction to Zoe, and do what she could  for me. Rosa gave me the impression that she was somewhat surprised  that I should have had any difficulty with Zoe (of course I had not  told her of the shooting-box scene). Rosa evidently thinks any woman  ought to be honoured....    Perhaps I was not so far wrong in my surmises as to Rosa's previous  inclinations--I wonder; at any rate she will undoubtedly make Baumer a  good wife, and she will probably be very fruitful and grow still fatter  and housewifely. She is of a type of woman appointed by God in his  foresight as breeders. Zoe, my adorable one, will probably not take  kindly to babies.           *       *       *       *       *    I am ordered to report myself at Kiel by next Monday.    I am terribly tempted to ring up Zoe on the telephone before I leave:  it seems dreadful to leave her without a word; but at the same time I  feel that she would interpret this as a sign of weakness on my part--as  indeed it would be. I must be firm, for strength of mind pays with  women, even more than with men.          _At Kiel_.      I left Bruges without a word either to or from my obstinate darling.    It is torture being away from her. I had thought that when I was here  and not exposed to the temptation of going round and seeing her, that  it would be easier; it is not. I long to write, and how I wonder  whether she is feeling it as I do.    I have read somewhere that a woman's passion once aroused is more  ungovernable than a man's. That her whole being cries aloud for me  cannot be doubted, and if the above statement is true what  inflexibility of will she must be showing--it almost makes me fear--but  no, I will defeat her in this strange contest, and she shall be my  wife.    The work here is strenuous, and the grass does not grow under one's  feet. The course for commanding officers lasts four weeks, and  terminates in an exceedingly practical but rather fearsome test--i.e.,  they have six steamers here camouflaged after the English fashion with  dazzle painting, and these six steamers, protected by launches and  harbour defence craft, steam across Kiel Bay in the manner of a convoy.  The officer being examined has to attack this group of ships in one of  the instructional submarines, and in three attacks he must score at  least two hits, or else, in theory, he is returned to general service  in the Fleet.    Fortunately at the moment I hear that owing to recent losses they are  distinctly on the short side where submarine officers are concerned, so  they'll probably make it easy when I do my test.           *       *       *       *       *    I see I have written nothing here for a fortnight; this is due to two  causes: Firstly, I have been so extraordinarily busy, and, secondly, I  have been most depressed through a letter I received from Fritz. It  contained two items of bad news.    In the first place, I heard for the first time of the tragedy of  Heinrich Baumer's boat, and to my astonishment Fritz tells me that Rosa  and another girl were in her when she was lost!    It appears that she was to go out for a couple of hours' diving off the  port as a matter of routine after her two months' overhaul. She went  out at 10 a.m., and was sighted from the signal station at the end of  the mole at 11.30, when almost immediately afterwards there was an  explosion and she disappeared. Motor-boats were quickly on the scene,  but only debris came to the surface. Divers were sent down, and  reported that she was in ten metres of water completely shattered. It  is assumed, for lack of other explanation, that she struck a chance  drifting mine which was moving down the coast on the tide.    Meanwhile Rosa and another sister were missing from the hospital, and  after forty-eight hours someone put two and two together and started  investigations. It has been ascertained that Baumer motored down from  Bruges after breakfast, and that in the car were two figures taken to  be sailors, as they were muffled up in oilskins. This fact was noted by  the control sentries, as, though the day was showery, it was not  raining hard. Other scraps of evidence unite in showing that these were  the two girls who had apparently induced Baumer to take them out for a  dive as a treat.    What a tragedy! However, it must have been quite instantaneous. Poor  Rosa, with all her vanities about war work, to think that the war would  claim her like that! [1]    [Footnote 1: It is known that a boat with women on board was lost  whilst exercising off Zeebrugge in the Spring of 1917. This would  appear to be the boat in question.--ETIENNE.]    Fritz added that old Max is almost off his head with rage over the  whole business, and it is difficult to say whether he is more angry  over Baumer and the boat being lost, or over the fact that Baumer being  dead he is unable to administer those \"disciplinary actions\" in which  he delights.           *       *       *       *       *    Great excitement here, as the day after to-morrow His Imperial Majesty  the Kaiser and Hindenburg are due to pay Kiel a surprise visit. We are  to be inspected and addressed. Tremendous preparations are going on.           *       *       *       *       *    His Majesty, accompanied by the great Field-Marshal, inspected us this  morning, and made a fine speech, of which we have been given printed  copies. I shall frame mine and hang it in my boat, if I get a command.    I transcribe it:    \"Officers and men of the U-boat service:    \"In the midst of the anxious moments in which we live I have determined  to make time to come and witness in my own person the labours of those  on whom I and the Fatherland rely. Fresh from the great battles on the  West which are gnawing at the vitals of our hereditary enemies, I come  to those whose glorious mission it will be to strike relentlessly at  our most deadly and cunning enemy--cursed Britain. God is on our side  and will protect you at sea for, in the striking at the nation which  openly boasts that it aims at starving our women and children, you are  engaged on a mission of undoubted holiness.    \"You must sink and destroy even as of old the Israelites smote and  destroyed the alien races.    \"To the officers I would particularly say, my person is your honour,  and I am your supreme chief. From my hands you will receive honour, and  from my hands will proceed just punishment for the unhappy ones who  fail in their duty.    \"To the men I would say, trust and obey your officers as you would your  God. Officers and men! In you, your Kaiser and Fatherland place their  trust--let neither be disappointed!\"    After his address, His Majesty graciously spoke a few words to  individuals, of whom I had the signal honour of being one. I felt that  I was in the presence of an Emperor. His gestures, his eyes, his voice,  impressed me as belonging to a man born to command and to fill high  places. The Field-Marshal never opened his mouth. I understand from his  A.D.C. that he rarely speaks in public.           *       *       *       *       *    The Colonel is KILLED! When I think about it, I am so excited I can  hardly write!    I heard the great news last night, quite by accident. I was sitting in  the Mess after dinner, and picked up _Die Woche_, and glancing at the  pictures, I suddenly saw the portrait of Colonel Stein, of the  Brandenburgers, killed on the 7th instant near Ypres. I recognized the  ugly and bloated face immediately from the photograph of him which she  had once shown me.    My first impulse was to send her a wire, but, on thinking matters over,  I decided that it would be difficult to put all my thoughts into the  curt sentences of a telegram, and, further, that as all wires are  doubtless examined at the Main Post Office at Bruges, it might lead to  trouble, so I wrote her a letter.    This, in a way, has been an exhibition of weakness on my part, as I had  promised myself that I would not take the first step in reopening  communication; but I feel that the fortunate death of Stein has  completely altered the case. I told her in the letter that I realized  that I had made mistakes, but that if she still loved me with half the  strength that I loved her, then a telegram to me would make me the  happiest of men.    I wrote that yesterday, but have had no wire. Perhaps, like me, she  distrusts telegrams and prefers letters.           *       *       *       *       *    A long letter from Zoe: an accursed fetter--an abominable letter--a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7959"],[0,"The Reign of Tiberius, Out of the First Six Annals of Tacitus; (#17)"],[1,"axes, and the Roman toga. To other nations  who know not the Roman domination, executions and tributes are also  unknown; evils which we too have cast off, in spite of that Augustus now  dead and enrolled with the Deities; in spite too of Tiberius, his  chosen successor: let us not after this dread a mutinous army, and a boy  without experience, their commander; but if you love your country, your  kindred, your ancient liberty and laws, better than tyrants and new  colonies, let Arminius rather lead you to liberty and glory, than the  wicked Segestes to the infamy of bondage.\"    By these stimulations, not the Cheruscans only were roused, but all the  neighbouring nations; and into the confederacy was drawn Inguiomerus,  paternal uncle to Arminius, a man long since in high credit with the  Romans: hence a new source of fear to Germanicus, who, to avoid the  shock of their whole forces, and to divert the enemy, sent Caecina with  forty Roman cohorts to the river Amisia, [Footnote: Ems.] through the  territories of the Bructerans. Pedo the Prefect led the cavalry by the  confines of the Frisians: he himself, on the lake, [Footnote: The Zuyder  Zee.] embarked four legions; and upon the bank of the said river the  whole body met, foot, horse, and fleet. The Chaucians, upon offering  their assistance, were taken into the service; but the Bructerans,  setting fire to their effects and dwellings, were routed by Stertinius,  by Germanicus despatched against them with a band lightly armed. As this  party were engaged between slaughter and plunder, he found the Eagle of  the nineteenth legion lost in the overthrow of Varus. The army marched  next to the farthest borders of the Bructerans, and the whole country  between the rivers Amisia and Luppia [Footnote: Lippe.] was laid waste.  Not far hence lay the forest of Teutoburgium, and in it the bones of  Varus and the legions, by report still unburied.    Hence Germanicus became inspired with a tender passion to pay the  last offices to the legions and their leader; the like tenderness also  affected the whole army. They were moved with compassion, some for  the fate of their friends, others for that of their relations here  tragically slain; they were struck with the doleful casualties of war,  and the sad lot of humanity. Caecina was sent before to examine the  gloomy recesses of the forest; to lay bridges over the pools; and upon  the deceitful marshes, causeways. The army entered the doleful solitude,  hideous to sight, hideous to memory. First they saw the camp of Varus,  wide in circumference; and the three distinct spaces, allotted to the  different Eagles, showed the number of the legions. Further, they  beheld the ruinous entrenchment, and the ditch nigh choked up: in it the  remains of the army were supposed to have made their last effort, and  in it to have found their graves. In the open fields lay their bones  all bleached and bare, some separate, some on heaps; just as they had  happened to fall, flying for their lives, or resisting unto death. Here  were scattered the limbs of horses, there pieces of broken javelins; and  the trunks of trees bore the skulls of men. In the adjacent groves were  the savage altars; where, of the tribunes and principal centurions,  the barbarians had made a horrible immolation. Those who survived the  slaughter, having escaped from captivity and the sword, related the sad  particulars to the rest: \"Here the commanders of the legions were slain;  there we lost the Eagles; here Varus had his first wound; there he gave  himself another, and perished by his own unhappy hand. In that place,  too, stood the tribunal whence Arminius harangued; in this quarter, for  the execution of his captives, he erected so many gibbets; in that such  a number of funeral trenches were digged; and with these circumstances  of pride and despite he insulted the ensigns and Eagles.\"    Thus the Roman army buried the bones of the three legions, six years  after the slaughter: nor could any one distinguish whether he gathered  the particular remains of a stranger, or those of a kinsman; but all  considered the whole as their friends, the whole as their relations;  with heightened resentments against the foe, at once sad and revengeful.  In this pious office, so acceptable to the dead, Germanicus was a  partner in the woe of the living; and upon the common tomb laid the  first sod: a proceeding not liked by Tiberius; whether it were that upon  every action of Germanicus he put a perverse meaning, or believed that  the affecting spectacle of the unburied slain would sink the spirit  of the army, and heighten their terror of the enemy; as also that \"a  general vested, as Augur, with the intendency of religious rites, became  defiled by touching the solemnities of the dead.\"    Arminius, retiring into desert and pathless places, was pursued by  Germanicus; who, as soon as he reached him, commanded the horse to  advance, and dislodge the enemy from the post they had possessed.  Arminius, having directed his men to keep close together, and draw near  to the woods, wheeled suddenly about, and to those whom he had hid in  the forest gave the signal to rush out: the Roman horse, now engaged  by a new army, became disordered, and to their relief some cohorts were  sent, but likewise broken by the press of those that fled; and great  was the consternation so many ways increased. The enemy too were already  pushing them into the morass, a place well known to the pursuers, as to  the unapprised Romans it had proved pernicious, had not Germanicus drawn  out the legions in order of battle. Hence the enemy became terrified,  our men reassured, and both retired with equal loss and advantage.  Germanicus presently after returning with the army to the river Amisia,  reconducted the legions, as he had brought them, in the fleet: part  of the horse were ordered to march along the sea-shore to the Rhine.  Caecina, who led his own men, was warned, that though he was to return  through unknown roads, yet he should with all speed pass the causeway  called the long bridges: it is a narrow track this, between vast  marshes, and formerly raised by Lucius Domitius. The marshes themselves  are of an uncertain soil, here full of mud, there of heavy sticking  clay, or traversed with various currents. Round about are woods which  rise gently from the plain, and were already filled with soldiers by  Arminius; who, by shorter ways and a running march, had arrived there  before our men, who were loaded with arms and baggage. Caecina, who was  perplexed how at once to repair the causeway decayed by time, and to  repulse the foe, resolved at last to encamp in the place, that whilst  some were employed in the work, others might maintain the fight.    The Barbarians strove violently to break our station, and to fall upon  the entrenchers: they harassed our men, assaulted the works, changed  their attacks, and pushed everywhere. With the shouts of the assailants,  the cries of the workmen were confusedly mixed; and all things equally  combined to distress the Romans: the place deep with ooze sinking under  those who stood, slippery to such as advanced; their armour heavy;  the waters deep, nor could they in them launch their javelins. The  Cheruscans, on the contrary, were inured to encounters in the bogs;  their persons tall, their spears long, such as could wound at a  distance. At last the legions, already yielding, were by night redeemed  from an unequal combat; but night interrupted not the activity of the  Germans, become by success indefatigable. Without refreshing themselves  with sleep, they diverted all the courses of the springs which rise in  the neighbouring mountains, and turned them into the plains: thus  the Roman camp was flooded, the work, as far as they had carried it,  overturned, and the labour of the poor soldiers renewed and doubled. To  Caecina this year proved the fortieth of his sustaining as officer or  soldier the functions of arms; a man in all the vicissitudes of war,  prosperous or disastrous, well experienced and thence undaunted.  Weighing, therefore, with himself all probable events and expedients, he  could devise no other than that of restraining the enemy to the woods,  till he had sent forward the wounded men and baggage; for, from the  mountains to the marshes there stretched a plain fit only to hold a  little army: to this purpose the legions were thus appointed; the fifth  had the right wing, and the one-and-twentieth the left; the first led  the van; the twentieth defended the rear.    A restless night it was to both armies, but in different ways; the  Barbarians feasted and caroused, and with songs of triumph, or with  horrid and threatening cries, filled all the plain and echoing woods.  Amongst the Romans were feeble fires, sad silence, or broken words;  they leaned drooping here and there against the pales, or wandered  disconsolately about the tents, like men without sleep, but not quite  awake. A frightful dream too terrified the General; he thought he heard  and saw Quinctilius Varus, rising out of the marsh all besmeared with  blood, stretching forth his hand, and calling upon him; but that he  rejected the call and pushed him away. At break of day, the legions  posted on the wings, through contumacy or affright, deserted their  stations, and took sudden possession of a field beyond the bogs. Neither  did Arminius fall straight upon them, however open they lay to his  assault; but, when he perceived the baggage set fast in mire and  ditches, the soldiers above it disorderly and embarrassed, the ranks and  ensigns in confusion, and, as usual in a time of distress, every one in  haste to save himself, but slow to obey his officer, he then commanded  his Germans to break in, \"Behold,\" he vehemently cried; \"behold again  Varus and his legions subdued by the same fate.\" Thus he cried, and  instantly with a select body broke quite through our"]]]
