It is enough  to kill one with laughing to look at these gentlemen. The second at  the organ is like a child trying to lift a millstone. You can see his  anguish in his face. The first wears spectacles. I stood beside him at  the organ and watched him with the intention of learning something from  him; at each note he lifts his hands entirely off the keys. What he  believes to be his forte is to play in six parts, but he mostly makes  fifths and octaves. He often chooses to dispense altogether with his  right hand when there is not the slightest need to do so, and plays with  the left alone; in short, he fancies that he can do as he will, and that  he is a thorough master of his organ.    Mamma sends her love to you all; she cannot possibly write, for she has  still to say her officium. We came home very late from the grand opera  rehearsal. I must go to-morrow after high mass to the illustrious  Electress; she is resolved absolument to teach me to knit filee. I am  very eager about this, as she and the Elector wish that I should knit in  public next Thursday at the great gala concert. The young Princess here,  who is a child compared with the Electress, knits very prettily.  The Zweenbruck and his Zwobrucken (Deux Ponts) arrived here at eight  o'clock. A propos, mamma and I earnestly beg you, dear papa, to send  our charming cousin a souvenir; we both regretted so much having nothing  with us, but we promised to write to you to send her something. We wish  two things to be sent--a double neckerchief in mamma's name, like the  one she wears, and in mine some ornament; a box, or etui, or anything  you like, only it must be pretty, for she deserves it. [FOOTNOTE: The  father was still in possession of many of the ornaments and jewels  presented to these children during their artistic tours.] She and her  father took a great deal of trouble on our account, and wasted much time  on us. My cousin took the receipts for me at my concert. Addio!        72.    Mannheim, Nov. 5, 1777.    My dear Coz--Buzz,--    I have safely received your precious epistle--thistle, and from it  I perceive--achieve, that my aunt--gaunt, and you--shoe, are quite  well--bell. I have to-day a letter--setter, from my papa--ah-ha, safe in  my hands--sands. I hope you also got--trot, my Mannheim letter--setter.  Now for a little sense--pence. The prelate's seizure--leisure, grieves  me much--touch, but he will, I hope, get well--sell. You write--blight,  you will keep--cheap, your promise to write to me--he-he, to Augsburg  soon--spoon. Well, I shall be very glad--mad. You further write, indeed  you declare, you pretend, you hint, you vow, you explain, you distinctly  say, you long, you wish, you desire, you choose, command, and point  out, you let me know and inform me that I must send you my portrait  soon--moon. Eh, bien! you shall have it before long--song. Now I wish  you good night--tight.    The 5th.--Yesterday I conversed with the illustrious Electress; and  to-morrow, the 6th, I am to play in the gala concert, and afterwards, by  desire of the Princess, in their private apartments. Now for something  rational! I beg of you--why not?--I beg of you, my very dear cousin--why  not?--when you write to Madame Tavernier in Munich, to convey a message  from me to the two Demoiselles Freysinger--why not? odd enough! but why  not?--and I humbly ask pardon of Madlle. Josepha--I mean the youngest,  and pray why not? why should I not ask her pardon? strange! but I don't  know why I should not, so I do ask her pardon very humbly--for not  having yet sent the sonata I promised her, but I mean to do so as  soon as possible. Why not? I don't know why not. I can now write no  more--which makes my heart sore. To all my kind friends much love--dove.  Addio! Your old young, till death--breath,    WOLFGANG AMADE ROSENCRANZ.    Miennham, eht ht5 rebotoc, 7771.        73.    Mannheim, Nov. 8, 1777.    This forenoon, at Herr Cannabich's, I wrote the Rondo of the sonata for  his daughter; so they would not let me leave them all day. The Elector  and the Electress, and the whole court, are very much pleased with me.  Both times I played at the concert, the Elector and she stood close  beside me at the piano. After the music was at an end, Cannabich managed  that I should be noticed by the court. I kissed the Elector's hand, who  said, \"I think it is now fifteen years since you were here?\" \"Yes,  your Highness, it is fifteen years since I had that honor.\" \"You play  inimitably.\" The Princess, when I kissed her hand, said, \"Monsieur, je  vous assure, on ne peut pas jouer mieux.\"    Yesterday I went with Cannabich to pay the visit mamma already wrote to  you about [to Duke Carl Theodor's children], and there I conversed with  the Elector as if he had been some kind friend. He is a most gracious  and good Prince. He said to me, \"I hear you wrote an opera at Munich\"  [\"La finta Giardiniera\"]? \"Yes, your Highness, and, with your gracious  permission, my most anxious wish is to write an opera here; I entreat  you will not quite forget me. I could also write a German one, God be  praised!\" said I, smiling. \"That may easily be arranged.\" He has one  son and three daughters, the eldest of whom and the young Count play the  piano. The Elector questioned me confidentially about his children.  I spoke quite honestly, but without detracting from their master.  Cannabich was entirely of my opinion. The Elector, on going away, took  leave of me with much courtesy.    After dinner to-day I went, at two o'clock, with Cannabich to  Wendling's, the flute-player, where they were all complaisance. The  daughter, who was formerly the Elector's favorite, plays the piano very  prettily; afterwards I played. I cannot describe to you the happy mood I  was in. I played extempore, and then three duets with the violin, which  I had never in my life seen, nor do I now know the name of the author.  They were all so delighted that I--was desired to embrace the ladies. No  hard task with the daughter, for she is very pretty.    We then went again to the Elector's children; I played three times, and  from my heart too,--the Elector himself each time asking me to play. He  seated himself each time close to me and never stirred. I also asked a  certain Professor there to give me a theme for a fugue, and worked it  out.    Now for my congratulations!    My very dearest papa,--I cannot write poetically, for I am no poet. I  cannot make fine artistic phrases that cast light and shadow, for I am  no painter; I can neither by signs nor by pantomime express my thoughts  and feelings, for I am no dancer; but I can by tones, for I am  a musician. So to-morrow, at Cannabich's, I intend to play my  congratulations both for your name-day and birthday. Mon tres-cher pere,  I can only on this day wish for you, what from my whole heart I wish for  you every day and every night--health, long life, and a cheerful spirit.  I would fain hope, too, that you have now less annoyance than when I was  in Salzburg; for I must admit that I was the chief cause of this. They  treated me badly, which I did not deserve, and you naturally took my  part, only too lovingly. I can tell you this was indeed one of the  principal and most urgent reasons for my leaving Salzburg in such haste.  I hope, therefore, that my wish is fulfilled. I must now close by a  musical congratulation. I wish that you may live as many years as must  elapse before no more new music can be composed. Farewell! I earnestly  beg you to go on loving me a little, and, in the mean time, to excuse  these very poor congratulations till I open new shelves in my small and  confined knowledge-box, where I can stow away the good sense which I  have every intention to acquire.        74.    Mannheim, Nov. 13, 1777.    We received your last two letters, and now I must answer them in  detail. Your letter desiring me to inquire about Becke's parents [in  Wallerstein, No. 68] I did not get till I had gone to Mannheim, so too  late to comply with your wish; but it never would have occurred to me  to do so, for, in truth, I care very little about him. Would you like  to know how I was received by him? Well and civilly; that is, he asked  where I was going. I said, most probably to Paris. He then gave me a  vast deal of advice, saying he had recently been there, and adding, \"You  will make a great deal by giving lessons, for the piano is highly prized  in Paris.\" He also arranged that I should dine at the officers'  table, and promised to put me in the way of speaking to the Prince.  He regretted very much having at that moment a sore throat, (which  was indeed quite true,) so that he could not go out with me himself to  procure me some amusement. He was also sorry that he could have no music  in honor of me, because most of the musical people had gone that very  day on some pedestrian excursion to--Heaven knows where! At his  request I tried his piano, which is very good. He often said Bravo! I  extemporized, and also played the sonatas in B and D. In short, he was  very polite, and I was also polite, but grave. We conversed on a variety  of topics--among others, about Vienna, and more particularly that the  Emperor [Joseph II.] was no great lover of music. He said, \"It is true  he has some knowledge of composition, but of nothing else. I can still  recall (and he rubbed his forehead) that when I was to play before him  I had no idea what to play; so I began with some fugues and trifles of  that kind, which in my own mind I only laughed at.\" I could scarcely  resist saying, \"I can quite fancy your laughing, but scarcely so loud  as I must have done had I heard you!\" He further said (what is the fact)  that the music in the Emperor's private apartments is enough to frighten  the crows. I replied, that whenever I heard such music, if I did not  quickly leave the room it gave me a headache. \"Oh! no; it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5308"],[0,"The Paradise Mystery (#17)"],[1,"before the body was discovered,  Dr. Ransford was seen--seen, mind you!--leaving the west porch of the  Cathedral, looking as if he had just been very much upset. Two persons  saw this.\"    \"Who are they?\" asked Mary.    \"That I'm not allowed to tell you,\" said Bryce, who had no intention of  informing her that one person was himself and the other imaginary. \"But  I can assure you that I am certain--absolutely certain!--that their  story is true. The fact is--I can corroborate it.\"    \"You!\" she exclaimed.    \"I!\" replied Bryce. \"I will tell you something that I have never told  anybody--up to now. I shan't ask you to respect my confidence--I've  sufficient trust in you to know that you will, without any asking.  Listen!--on that morning, Dr. Ransford went out of the surgery in the  direction of the Deanery, leaving me alone there. A few minutes later, a  tap came at the door. I opened it--and found--a man standing outside!\"    \"Not--that man?\" asked Mary fearfully.    \"That man--Braden,\" replied Bryce. \"He asked for Dr. Ransford. I said  he was out--would the caller leave his name? He said no--he had called  because he had once known a Dr. Ransford, years before. He added  something about calling again, and he went away--across the Close  towards the Cathedral. I saw him again--not very long afterwards--lying  in the corner of Paradise--dead!\"    Mary Bewery was by this time pale and trembling--and Bryce continued to  watch her steadily. She stole a furtive look at him.    \"Why didn't you tell all this at the inquest?\" she asked in a whisper.    \"Because I knew how damning it would be to--Ransford,\" replied Bryce  promptly. \"It would have excited suspicion. I was certain that no one  but myself knew that Braden had been to the surgery door--therefore, I  thought that if I kept silence, his calling there would never be known.  But--I have since found that I was mistaken. Braden was seen--going away  from Dr. Ransford's.\"    \"By--whom?\" asked Mary.    \"Mrs. Deramore--at the next house,\" answered Bryce. \"She happened to  be looking out of an upstairs window. She saw him go away and cross the  Close.\"    \"Did she tell you that?\" demanded Mary, who knew Mrs. Deramore for a  gossip.    \"Between ourselves,\" said Bryce, \"she did not! She told Mrs.  Folliot--Mrs. Folliot told me.\"    \"So--it is talked about!\" exclaimed Mary.    \"I said so,\" assented Bryce. \"You know what Mrs. Folliot's tongue is.\"    \"Then Dr. Ransford will get to hear of it,\" said Mary.    \"He will be the last person to get to hear of it,\" affirmed Bryce.  \"These things are talked of, hole-and-corner fashion, a long time before  they reach the ears of the person chiefly concerned.\"    Mary hesitated a moment before she asked her next question.    \"Why have you told me all this?\" she demanded at last.    \"Because I didn't want you to be suddenly surprised,\" answered Bryce.  \"This--whatever it is--may come to a sudden head--of an unpleasant sort.  These rumours spread--and the police are still keen about finding out  things concerning this dead man. If they once get it into their heads  that Dr. Ransford knew him--\"    Mary laid her hand on the gate between them--and Bryce, who had done  all he wished to do at that time, instantly opened it, and she passed  through.    \"I am much obliged to you,\" she said. \"I don't know what it all  means--but it is Dr. Ransford's affair--if there is any affair, which I  doubt. Will you let me go now, please?\"    Bryce stood aside and lifted his hat, and Mary, with no more than a nod,  walked on towards the golf club-house across the Common, while Bryce  turned off to the town, highly elated with his morning's work. He had  sown the seeds of uneasiness and suspicion broadcast--some of them, he  knew, would mature.    Mary Bewery played no golf that morning. In fact, she only went on to  the club-house to rid herself of Bryce, and presently she returned home,  thinking. And indeed, she said to herself, she had abundant food for  thought. Naturally candid and honest, she did not at that moment doubt  Bryce's good faith; much as she disliked him in most ways she knew that  he had certain commendable qualities, and she was inclined to believe  him when he said that he had kept silence in order to ward off  consequences which might indirectly be unpleasant for her. But of him  and his news she thought little--what occupied her mind was the possible  connection between the stranger who had come so suddenly and disappeared  so suddenly--and for ever!--and Mark Ransford. Was it possible--really  possible--that there had been some meeting between them in or about the  Cathedral precincts that morning? She knew, after a moment's reflection,  that it was very possible--why not? And from that her thoughts followed  a natural trend--was the mystery surrounding this man connected in any  way with the mystery about herself and her brother?--that mystery  of which (as it seemed to her) Ransford was so shy of speaking. And  again--and for the hundredth time--she asked herself why he was so  reticent, so evidently full of dislike of the subject, why he could not  tell her and Dick whatever there was to tell, once for all?    She had to pass the Folliots' house in the far corner of the Close on  her way home--a fine old mansion set in well-wooded grounds, enclosed by  a high wall of old red brick. A door in that wall stood open, and inside  it, talking to one of his gardeners, was Mr. Folliot--the vistas behind  him were gay with flowers and rich with the roses which he passed all  his days in cultivating. He caught sight of Mary as she passed the open  doorway and called her back.    \"Come in and have a look at some new roses I've got,\" he said.  \"Beauties! I'll give you a handful to carry home.\"    Mary rather liked Mr. Folliot. He was a big, half-asleep sort of man,  who had few words and could talk about little else than his hobby. But  he was a passionate lover of flowers and plants, and had a positive  genius for rose-culture, and was at all times highly delighted to take  flower-lovers round his garden. She turned at once and walked in, and  Folliot led her away down the scented paths.    \"It's an experiment I've been trying,\" he said, leading her up to a  cluster of blooms of a colour and size which she had never seen before.  \"What do you think of the results?\"    \"Magnificent!\" exclaimed Mary. \"I never saw anything so fine!\"    \"No!\" agreed Folliot, with a quiet chuckle. \"Nor anybody else--because  there's no such rose in England. I shall have to go to some of these  learned parsons in the Close to invent me a Latin name for this--it's  the result of careful experiments in grafting--took me three years to  get at it. And see how it blooms,--scores on one standard.\"    He pulled out a knife and began to select a handful of the finest  blooms, which he presently pressed into Mary's hand.    \"By the by,\" he remarked as she thanked him and they turned away along  the path, \"I wanted to have a word with you--or with Ransford. Do you  know--does he know--that that confounded silly woman who lives near  to your house--Mrs. Deramore--has been saying some things--or a  thing--which--to put it plainly--might make some unpleasantness for  him?\"    Mary kept a firm hand on her wits--and gave him an answer which was true  enough, so far as she was aware.    \"I'm sure he knows nothing,\" she said. \"What is it, Mr. Folliot?\"    \"Why, you know what happened last week,\" continued Folliot, glancing  knowingly at her. \"The accident to that stranger. This Mrs. Deramore,  who's nothing but an old chatterer, has been saying, here and there,  that it's a very queer thing Dr. Ransford doesn't know anything about  him, and can't say anything, for she herself, she says, saw the very man  going away from Dr. Ransford's house not so long before the accident.\"    \"I am not aware that he ever called at Dr. Ransford's,\" said Mary. \"I  never saw him--and I was in the garden, about that very time, with your  stepson, Mr. Folliot.\"    \"So Sackville told me,\" remarked Folliot. \"He was present--and so was  I--when Mrs. Deramore was tattling about it in our house yesterday. He  said, then, that he'd never seen the man go to your house. You never  heard your servants make any remark about it?\"    \"Never!\" answered Mary.    \"I told Mrs. Deramore she'd far better hold her tongue,\" continued  Folliot. \"Tittle-tattle of that sort is apt to lead to unpleasantness.  And when it came to it, it turned out that all she had seen was this  stranger strolling across the Close as if he'd just left your house.  If--there's always some if! But I'll tell you why I mentioned it to  you,\" he continued, nudging Mary's elbow and glancing covertly first at  her and then at his house on the far side of the garden. \"Ladies that  are--getting on a bit in years, you know--like my wife, are apt to let  their tongues wag, and between you and me, I shouldn't wonder if Mrs.  Folliot has repeated what Mrs. Deramore said--eh? And I don't want the  doctor to think that--if he hears anything, you know, which he may, and,  again, he might--to think that it originated here. So, if he should ever  mention it to you, you can say it sprang from his next-door neighbour.  Bah!--they're a lot of old gossips, these Close ladies!\"    \"Thank you,\" said Mary. \"But--supposing this man had been to our  house--what difference would that make? He might have been for half a  dozen reasons.\"    Folliot looked at her out of his half-shut eyes.    \"Some people would want to know why Ransford didn't tell that--at the  inquest,\" he answered. \"That's all. When there's a bit of mystery, you  know--eh?\"    He nodded--as if reassuringly--and went off to rejoin his gardener, and  Mary walked home with her roses, more thoughtful than ever. Mystery?--a  bit of mystery? There was a vast and heavy cloud of mystery, and she  knew she could have no peace until it was lifted.          CHAPTER XI. THE BACK ROOM      In the"]]]
