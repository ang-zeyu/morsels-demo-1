I don't know  what to do!\" and the lady burst into tears.            CHAPTER XVIII    ANOTHER CALL      Tom Swift, for the moment, did not know what to do. It was a  strange situation, and one he had never thought of. What did the  mysterious message mean? He must think it all out, and plan some  line of action. Clearly Mrs. Damon was not able to do so.    \"Now let's get at this in some kind of order,\" suggested the  youth, when Mrs. Damon had calmed herself. It was his habit to  have a method about doing things. \"And don't worry,\" he advised.  \"I am certain some good will come of this. It proves one thing,  that's sure.\"    \"What is it, Tom?\"    \"That Mr. Damon is alive and well. Otherwise the message would not  have said he would be 'released.' It wasn't from anyone you know;  was it?\"    \"No, I'm sure I never heard the voice before.\"    Tom paused a moment to think how useful his photo telephone and  phonograph arrangement might have been in this case.    \"How did the telephone call come in?\" inquired the young inventor.    \"In the usual way,\" answered Mrs. Damon. \"The bell rang, and, as I  happened to be near the instrument, I answered it, as I often do,  when the maid is busy. A voice asked if I was Mrs. Damon, and of  course I said I was. Then I heard this: 'Sign the land papers, and  send them to us, and your husband will be released.'\"    \"Was that all?\" Tom asked.    \"I think so--I made a note of it at the time.\" Mrs. Damon looked  into a small red book. \"No, that wasn't all,\" she said, quickly.  \"I was so astonished, at hearing those strange words about my  husband, that I didn't know what to say. Before I could ask any  questions the voice went on to say, rather abruptly: 'We will call  you again.'\"    \"That's good!\" cried Tom. \"I only hope they do it while I am here.  Perhaps I can get some clue as to who it was called you. But was  this all you heard?\"    \"Yes, I'm sure that was all. I had forgotten about the last words,  but I see I have them written down in my note book.\"    \"Did you ask any questions?\" inquired Tom.    \"Oh, indeed I did! As soon as I got over being stunned by what I  heard, I asked all sorts of questions. I demanded to know who was  speaking, what they meant, where they were, and all that. I begged  them to tell me something of my husband.\"    \"And what did they say?\"    \"Not a thing. There wasn't a sound in the telephone. The receiver  was hung up, breaking the connection after that message to me--that  mysterious message.\"    \"Yes, it was mysterious,\" agreed Tom, thoughtfully. \"I can't  understand it. But didn't you try to learn from the central  operator where the call had come from?\"    \"Oh, yes, indeed, Tom! As soon as I found out the person speaking  to me had rung off, I got the girl in the exchange.\"    \"And what did she say?\"    \"That the call came from an automatic pay station in a drug store  in town. I have the address. It was one of those telephones where  you put your money for the call in a slot.\"    \"I see. Well, the first thing to do is for me to go to that drug  store and find out, if I can, who used the telephone about that  time. It's a slim chance, but we'll have to take it. Was it a  man's voice, or a woman's?\"    \"Oh, a man's, I'm sure. It was very deep and heavy. No woman could  speak like that.\"    \"So much is settled, anyhow. Now about the land papers--what was  meant?\"    \"I'll tell you,\" said Mrs. Damon. \"You know part of our  property--considerable land and some buildings--is in my name. Mr. Damon  had it fixed so a number of years ago, in order to protect me. No one  could get this property, and land, unless I signed the deeds, or  agreed to sign them. Now all of Mr. Damon's fortune is tied up in  some of Mr. Peters's companies. That is why my husband has  disappeared.\"    \"He didn't disappear--he was taken away against his will; I'm  positive of that!\" exclaimed Tom.    \"Perhaps so,\" agreed Mrs. Damon, sadly. \"But those are the papers  referred to, I'm sure.\"    \"Probably,\" assented Tom. \"The rascals want to get control of  everything--even your possessions. Not satisfied with ruining Mr.  Damon, they want to make you a beggar, too. So they are playing on  your fears. They promise to release your husband if you will give  them the land.\"    \"Yes, that must be it, Tom. What would you advise me to do? I am  so frightened over this!\"    \"Do? Don't you do anything!\" cried Tom. \"We'll fool these rascals  yet. If they got those papers they might release Mr. Damon, or  they might not--fearing he would cause their arrest later. But  we'll have him released anyhow, and we'll save what is left of  your fortune. Put those land papers in a safe-deposit box, and let  me do the rest. I'm going to catch those fellows!\"    \"But how, Tom? You don't know who they are. And a mere message  over a telephone won't give you a clue to where they are.\"    \"Perhaps not an ordinary message,\" agreed Tom. \"But I'm going to  try some of my new inventions. You said they told you they were  going to call again?\"    \"That's what they said, Tom.\"    \"Well, when they do, I want to be here. I want to listen to that  message. If you will allow me, I'll take up my residence here for  a while, Mrs. Damon.\"    \"Allow you? I'll be only too glad if you will, Tom. But I thought  you were going to try to get some clue from the drug store where  the mysterious message came from.\"    \"I'll let Ned Newton do that. I want to stay here.\"    Tom telephoned to Ned to meet him at Mrs. Damon's house, and also  to bring with him certain things from the laboratory. And when Ned  arrived in an auto, with various bits of apparatus, Tom put in  some busy hours.    Meanwhile Ned was sent to the drug store, to see if any clues  could be obtained there as to who had sent the message. As Tom had  feared, nothing could be learned. There were several automatic  'phones in the place, and they were used very often during the day  by the public. The drug clerks took little or no notice of the  persons entering or leaving the booths, since the dropping of a  coin in the slot was all that was necessary to be connected with  central.    \"Well, we've got to wait for the second call here,\" said Tom, who  had been busy during Ned's absence. He had fitted to Mrs. Damon's  telephone a recording wax phonograph cylinder, to get a record of  the speaker's voice. And he had also put in an extension  telephone, so that he could listen while Mrs. Damon talked to the  unknown.    \"There, I guess we're ready for them,\" said Tom, late that  afternoon. But no queer call came in that day. It was the next  morning, about ten o'clock, after Mrs. Damon had passed a restless  night, that the telephone bell rang. Tom, who was on the alert,  was at his auxiliary instrument in a flash. He motioned to Mrs.  Damon to answer on the main wire.    \"Hello,\" she spoke into the transmitter. \"Who is this?\"    \"Are you Mrs. Damon?\" Tom heard come over the wire in a deep  voice, and by the manner in which Mrs. Damon signalled the young  inventor knew that, at the other end of the line, was the  mysterious man who had spoken before.            CHAPTER XIX    THE BUZZING SOUND      \"Are you Mrs. Damon?\" came the question again--rather more  impatiently this time, Tom thought.    \"Yes,\" answered the lady, glancing over at Tom. The extension  telephone was in the same room. Softly Tom switched on the  phonograph attachment. The little wax cylinder began to revolve  noiselessly, ready to record the faintest word that came over the  wire.    \"You got a message from me yesterday,\" went on the hoarse voice.  In vain Tom tried to recall whether or not he had heard it before.  He could not place it.    \"Who are you?\" asked Mrs. Damon. She and Tom had previously agreed  on a line of talk. \"Tell me your name, please.\"    \"There's no need for any names to be used,\" went on the unknown at  the other end of the wire. \"You heard what I said yesterday. Are  you willing to send me those land title papers, if we release your  husband?\"    \"But where shall I send them?\" asked Mrs. Damon, to gain time.    \"You'll be told where. And listen--no tricks! You needn't try to  find out who I am, nor where I am. Just send those papers if you  want to see your husband again.\"    \"Oh, how is he? Tell me about him! You are cruel to keep him a  prisoner like this! I demand that you release him!\"    Tom had not told Mrs. Damon to say this. It came out of her own  heart--she could not prevent the agonized outburst.    \"Never mind about that, now,\" came the gruff voice over the wire.  \"Are you willing to send the papers?\"    Mrs. Damon looked over to Tom for silent instructions. He nodded  his head in assent.    \"Yes, I--I will send them if you tell me where to get them to you--if  you will release Mr. Damon,\" said the anxious wife. \"But tell  me who you are--and where you are!\" she begged.    \"None of that! I'm not looking to be arrested. You get the papers  ready, and I'll let you know to-morrow, about this time, where to  send them.\"    \"Wait a minute!\" called Mrs. Damon, to gain more time. \"I must  know just what papers you want.\"    \"All right, I'll tell you,\" and he began to describe the different  ones.    It took a little time for the unknown to give this information to  Mrs. Damon. The man was very particular about the papers. There  were trust deeds, among other things, and he probably thought that  once he had possession of them, with Mrs. Damon's signature, even  though it had been obtained under a threat, he could claim the  property. Later it was learned that such was not the case, for  Mrs. Damon, with Tom's aid, could have proved the fraud, had the  scoundrels tried to get the remainder of the Damon fortune.    But at the time it seemed to the helpless woman that everything  she owned would be taken from her. Though she said she did not  care, as long as Mr. Damon was restored to her.    As I have said, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4544"],[0,"The Cell of Self-Knowledge : seven early English mystical treatises printed (#17)"],[1,"which that it will. The receipt of the soul is the  consent of the same soul. A new thought and a stirring to any sin,  the which thou hast forsaken before in thy shrift, what is it else  but the speech of one of the three spirits the which are thine  enemies (touched before), proffering to write on thy soul the same  sin again? The speech of thyself, is it not; for why, there is no  such thing written in thy soul, for all it is wasted away before in  thy shrift, and thy soul left naked and bare; nothing left  thereupon, but a frail and a free consent, more inclining to the  evil, for custom therein, than it is to the good, but more able to  the good than to the evil, for cleanness of the soul and virtue of  the sacrament of shrift; but, of itself, it hath nought then, where  through it may think or stir itself to good or to evil; and,  therefore, it followeth that what thought that cometh then in it,  whether that it be good or evil, it is not of itself, but the  consent to the good or to the evil, whether that it be, that is ever  more the work of the same soul.    And all after the worthiness and the wretchedness of this consent,  thereafter it deserveth pain or bliss. If this consent be to evil,  then as fast it hath, by cumbrance of sin, the office of that same  spirit that first made him suggestion of that same sin; and if it be  to the good, then as fast it hath, by grace, the office of that same  spirit that first made him stirring[313] to that same good. For as  oft as any healful thought cometh in our mind, as of chastity, of  soberness, of despising of the world, of wilful poverty, of  patience, of meekness, and of charity, without doubt it is the  spirit of God that speaketh, either by Himself or else by some of  His angels--that is to say, either His angels of this life, the  which are true teachers, or else His angels of His bliss, the which  are true stirrers and inspirers of good. And as it is said of the  other three evil spirits, that a soul, for long use and customable  consenting unto them, may be made so fleshly, so worldly, and so  malicious, that it taketh upon it the office of them all; right so  it is againward[314] that a soul, for long use and custom in  goodness, may be made so ghostly by cleanness of living and devotion  of spirit against the spirit of the flesh, and so heavenly against  the spirit of the world, and so godly by peace and by charity, and  by restfulness of heart, against the spirit of malice, of wrath, and  of wickedness, that it hath them now of office all such good  thoughts to think when him list, without forgetting, in as great  perfection as the frailty of this life will suffer. And thus it may  be seen how that each thought that smiteth on our hearts, whether  that it be good or evil, it is not evermore the speech of our own  spirit, but the consent to the thought, what so ever it be, that is  ever of our own spirit. Jesu grant us His grace, to consent to the  good and againstand the evil. Amen.    FINIS.
