The Council of State contained most of  the notable statesmen of the Parliamentary party, and had before it  a vast task in reorganizing the administration of England, in the  conduct of an actual war in Ireland, a possible war in Scotland, and  in the maintenance of the honour of the republic in its relations with  foreign princes.    The Council of State prepared the business for its consideration  through special committees for special departments of the public  service. The Committee for Foreign Affairs consisted of Whitelocke,  Vane, Lord Lisle, Lord Denbigh, Mr. Marten, Mr. Lisle. A secretary was  required to translate despatches, both those which were sent out, and  those which were received. Nothing seems more natural than that the  author of the _Tenure of Kings and Magistrates_, who was at once a  staunch Parliamentarian, an accomplished Latin scholar, and conversant  with more than one of the spoken languages of the Continent, should be  thought of for the office. Yet so little was Milton personally known,  living as he did the life of a retired student, that it was the  accident of his having the acquaintance of one of the new Council to  which he owed the appointment.    The post was offered him, but would he accept it? He had never ceased  to revolve in his mind subjects capable of poetical treatment, and  to cherish his own vocation as the classical poet of the English  language. Peace had come, and leisure was within his reach. He was  poor, but his wants were simple, and he had enough wherewith to meet  them. Already, in 1649, unmistakable symptoms threatened his sight,  and warned him of the necessity of the most rigid economy in the  use of the eyes. The duties that he was now asked to undertake were  indefinite already in amount, and would doubtless extend themselves if  zealously discharged.    But the temptation was strong, and he did not resist it. The increase  of income was, doubtless, to Milton the smallest among the inducements  now offered him. He had thought it a sufficient and an honourable  employment to serve his country with his pen as a volunteer. Here was  an offer to become her official, authorised servant, and to bear a  part, though a humble part, in the great work of reorganisation which  was now to be attempted. Above all other allurements to a retired  student, unversed in men, and ready to idealise character, was the  opportunity of becoming at once personally acquainted with all the  great men of the patriotic party, whom his ardent imagination had  invested with heroic qualities. The very names of Fairfax, Vane, and  Cromwell, called up in him emotions for which prose was an inadequate  vehicle. Nor was it only that in the Council itself he would be  in daily intercourse with such men as Henry Marten, Hutchinson,  Whitelocke, Harrington, St. John, Ludlow, but his position would  introduce him at once to all the members of the House who were worth  knowing. It was not merely a new world; it was _the_ world which was  here opened for the first time to Milton. And we must remember that,  all scholar as he was, Milton was well convinced of the truth that  there are other sources of knowledge besides books. He had himself  spent \"many studious and contemplative years in the search of  religious and civil knowledge,\" yet he knew that, for a mind large  enough to \"take in a general survey of humane things,\" it was  necessary to know--        The world,... her glory,      Empires and monarchs, and their radiant courts,      Best school of best experience.        _P.R._ iii. 237.    He had repeatedly, as if excusing his political interludes, renewed  his pledge to devote all his powers to poetry as soon, as they  should be fully ripe. To complete his education as a poet, he wanted  initiation into affairs. Here was an opening far beyond any he had  ever dreamed of. The sacrifice of time and precious eyesight which he  was to make was costly, but it was not pure waste; it would be partly  returned to him in a ripened experience in this                                         Insight      In all things to greatest actions lead,    He accepted the post at once without hesitation. On March 13, 1649,  the Committee for Foreign Affairs was directed to make the offer to  him; on March 15, he attended at Whitehall to be admitted to office.  Well would it have been both for his genius and his fame if he had  declined it. His genius might have reverted to its proper course,  while he was in the flower of age, with eyesight still available, and  a spirit exalted by the triumph of the good cause. His fame would  have been saved from the degrading incidents of the contention with  Salmasius and Morus, and from being tarnished by the obloquy of the  faction which he fought, and which conquered him. No man can with  impunity insult and trample upon his fellow-man, even in the best  of causes. Especially if he be an artist, he makes it impossible to  obtain equitable appreciation of his work.    So far as Milton reckoned upon a gain in experience from his  secretaryship, he doubtless reaped it. Such a probation could not be  passed without solidifying the judgment, and correcting its tendency  to error. And this school of affairs, which is indispensable for  the historian, may also be available for the poet. Yet it would be  difficult to point in Milton's subsequent poetry to any element which  the poet can be thought to have imbibed from the foreign secretary.  Where, as in Milton's two epics, and _Samson Agonistes_, the  personages are all supernatural or heroic, there is no room for the  employment of knowledge of the world. Had Milton written comedy, like  Molière, he might have said with Molière after he had been introduced  at court, \"Je n'ai plus que faire d'étudier Plaute et Terence; je n'ai  qu'à étudier le monde.\"    The office into which Milton was now inducted is called in the Council  books that of \"Secretary for foreign tongues.\" Its duties were chiefly  the translation of despatches from, and to, foreign governments. The  degree of estimation in which the Latin secretary was held, may be  measured by the amount of salary assigned him. For while the English  chief Secretary had a salary of 730 l. (= 2200 l. of our day), the  Latin Secretary was paid only 288 l. 13s. 6d. (= 900 l.). For this,  not very liberal pay, he was told that all his time was to be at the  disposal of the government. Lincoln's Inn Fields was too far off for a  servant of the Council who might have to attend meetings at seven in  the morning. He accordingly migrated to Charing Cross, now become  again Charing without the cross, this work of art having been an early  (1647) victim of religious barbarism. In November he was accommodated  with chambers in Whitehall. But from these he was soon ousted by  claimants more considerable or more importunate, and in 1651 he  removed to \"a pretty garden-house\" in Petty France, in Westminster,  next door to the Lord Scudamore's, and opening into St. James's Park.  The house was extant till 1877, when it disappeared, the last of  Milton's many London residences. It had long ceased to look into St.  James's Park, more than one row of houses, encroachments upon the  public park, having grown up between. The garden-house had become a  mere ordinary street house in York-street, only distinguished from the  squalid houses on either side of it by a tablet affixed by Bentham,  inscribed \"sacred to Milton, prince of poets.\" Petty France lost its  designation in the French Revolution, in obedience to the childish  petulance which obliterates the name of any one who may displease you  at the moment, and became one of the seventeen York-streets of the  metropolis. Soon after the re-baptism of the street, Milton's house  was occupied by William Hazlitt, who rented it of Bentham. Milton had  lived in it for nine years, from 1651 till a few weeks before the  Restoration. Its nearness to Whitehall where the Council sat, was less  a convenience than a necessity.    For Milton's life now became one of close attention, and busy service.  As Latin secretary, and Weckherlin's successor, indeed, his proper  duties were only those of a clerk or translator. But his aptitude  for business of a literary kind soon drew on him a great variety of  employment. The demand for a Latin translation of a despatch was not  one of frequent occurrence. The Letters of the Parliament, and of  Oliver and Richard, Protectors, which are, intrusively, printed among  Milton's works, are but one hundred and thirty-seven in all. This  number is spread over ten years, being at the rate of about fourteen  per year; most of them are very short. For the purposes of a biography  of Milton, it is sufficient to observe, that the dignified attitude  which the Commonwealth took up towards foreign powers lost none of its  elevation in being conveyed in Miltonic Latin. Whether satisfaction  for the murder of an envoy is to be extorted from the arrogant court  of Madrid, or an apology is to be offered to a humble count of  Oldenburg for delay in issuing a salva-guardia which had been  promised, the same equable dignity of expression is maintained,  equally remote from crouching before the strong, and hectoring the  weak.    His translations were not all the duties of the new secretary. He must  often serve as interpreter at audiences of foreign envoys. He must  superintend the semi-official organ, the _Mercurius Politicus_.  He must answer the manifesto of the Presbyterians of Ireland. The  _Observations_ on the peace of Kilkenny are Milton's composition, but  from instructions. By the peace the Irish had obtained home rule in  its widest extent, release from the oath of supremacy, and the right  to tie their ploughs to the tail of the horse. The same peace also  conceded to them the militia, a trust which Charles I. had said he  would not devolve on the Parliament of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8771"],[0,"Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice (#17)"],[1,"wavering white blur in the dark corridor. She came to talk with him  where they would not be bothered with interruptions: but she came  delightfully perfumed, in her night-shift, and in nothing else.  Jurgen wondered at the way of these women even as his arms went  about her in the gloom. He remembered always the feel of that warm  and slender and yielding body, naked under the thin fabric of the  shift, as his arms first went about her: of all their moments  together that last breathless minute before either of them had  spoken stayed in his memory as the most perfect.    And yet what followed was pleasant enough, for now it was to the  wide and softly cushioned throne of a king, no less, that Guenevere  and Jurgen resorted, so as to talk where they would not be bothered  with interruptions. The throne of Gogyrvan was perfectly dark, under  its canopy, in the unlighted hall, and in the dark nobody can see  what happens.    Thereafter these two contrived to talk together nightly upon the  throne of Glathion: but what remained in Jurgen's memory was that  last moment behind the door, and the six tall windows upon the east  side of the hall, those windows which were of commingled blue and  silver, but were all an opulent glitter, throughout that time in the  night when the moon was clear of the tree-tops and had not yet risen  high enough to be shut off by the eaves. For that was all which  Jurgen really saw in the Hall of Judgment. There would be a brief  period wherein upon the floor beneath each window would show a  narrow quadrangle of moonlight: but the windows were set in a wall  so deep that this soon passed. On the west side were six windows  also, but about these was a porch; so no light ever came from the  west.    Thus in the dark they would laugh and talk with lowered voices.  Jurgen came to these encounters well primed with wine, and in  consequence, as he quite comprehended, talked like an angel, without  confining himself exclusively to celestial topics. He was often  delighted by his own brilliance, and it seemed to him a pity there  was no one handy to take it down: so much of his talking was  necessarily just a little over the head of any girl, however  beautiful and adorable.    And Guenevere, he found, talked infinitely better at night. It was  not altogether the wine which made him think that, either: the girl  displayed a side she veiled in the day time. A girl, far less a  princess, is not supposed to know more than agrees with a man's  notion of maidenly ignorance, she contended.    \"Nobody ever told me anything about so many interesting matters.  Why, I remember--\" And Guenevere narrated a quaintly pathetic little  story, here irrelevant, of what had befallen her some three or four  years earlier. \"My mother was living then: but she had never said a  word about such things, and frightened as I was, I did not go to  her.\"    Jurgen asked questions.    \"Why, yes. There was nothing else to do. I cannot talk freely with  my maids and ladies even now. I cannot question them, that is: of  course I can listen as they talk among themselves. For me to do more  would be unbecoming in a princess. And I wonder quietly about so  many things!\" She educed instances. \"After that I used to notice the  animals and the poultry. So I worked out problems for myself, after  a fashion. But nobody ever told me anything directly.\"    \"Yet I dare say that Thragnar--well, the Troll King, being very  wise, must have made zoology much clearer.\"    \"Thragnar was a skilled enchanter,\" says a demure voice in the dark;  \"and through the potency of his abominable arts, I can remember  nothing whatever about Thragnar.\"    Jurgen laughed, ruefully. Still, he was tolerably sure about  Thragnar now.    So they talked: and Jurgen marvelled, as millions of men had done  aforetime, and have done since, at the girl's eagerness, now that  barriers were down, to discuss in considerable detail all such  matters as etiquette had previously compelled them to ignore. About  her ladies in waiting, for example, she afforded him some very  curious data: and concerning men in general she asked innumerable  questions that Jurgen found delicious.    Such innocence combined--upon the whole--with a certain moral  obtuseness, seemed inconceivable. For to Jurgen it now appeared that  Guenevere was behaving with not quite the decorum which might fairly  be expected of a princess. Contrition, at least, one might have  looked for, over this hole and corner business: whereas it worried  him to note that Guenevere was coming to accept affairs almost as a  matter of course. Certainly she did not seem to think at all of any  wickedness anywhere: the utmost she suggested was the necessity of  being very careful. And while she never contradicted him in these  private conversations, and submitted in everything to his judgment,  her motive now appeared to be hardly more than a wish to please him.  It was almost as though she were humoring him in his foolishness.  And all this within six weeks! reflected Jurgen: and he nibbled his  finger-nails, with a mental side-glance toward the opinions of King  Gogyrvan Gawr.    But in daylight the Princess remained unchanged. In daylight Jurgen  adored her, but with no feeling of intimacy. Very rarely did  occasion serve for them to be actually alone in the day time. Once  or twice, though, he kissed her in open sunlight: and then her eyes  were melting but wary, and the whole affair was rather flat. She did  not repulse him: but she stayed a princess, appreciative of her  station, and seemed not at all the invisible person who talked with  him at night in the Hall of Judgment.    Presently, by common consent, they began to avoid each other by  daylight. Indeed, the time of the Princess was now pre-occupied: for  now had come into Glathion a ship with saffron colored sails, and  having for its figure-head a dragon that was painted with thirty  colors. Such was the ship which brought Messire Merlin Ambrosius and  Dame Anaitis, the Lady of the Lake, with a great retinue, to fetch  young Guenevere to London, where she was to be married to King  Arthur.    First there was a week of feasting and tourneys and high mirth of  every kind. Now the trumpets blared, and upon a scaffolding that was  gay with pennons and smart tapestries King Gogyrvan sat nodding and  blinking in his brightest raiment, to judge who did the best: and  into the field came joyously a press of dukes and earls and barons  and many famous knights, to contend for honor and a trumpery chaplet  of pearls.    Jurgen shrugged, and honored custom. The Duke of Logreus acquitted  himself with credit in the opening tournament, unhorsing Sir Dodinas  le Sauvage, Earl Roth of Meliot, Sir Epinogris, and Sir Hector de  Maris: then Earl Damas of Listenise smote like a whirlwind, and  Jurgen slid contentedly down the tail of his fine horse. His part in  the tournament was ended, and he was heartily glad of it. He  preferred to contemplate rather than share in such festivities: and  he now followed his bent with a most exquisite misery, because he  considered that never had any other poet occupied a situation more  picturesque.    By day he was the Duke of Logreus, which in itself was a notable  advance upon pawnbroking: after nightfall he discounted the peculiar  privileges of a king. It was the secrecy, the deluding of everybody,  which he especially enjoyed: and in the thought of what a monstrous  clever fellow was Jurgen, he almost lost sight of the fact that he  was miserable over the impending marriage of the lady he loved.    Once or twice he caught the tail-end of a glance from Gogyrvan's  bright old eye. Jurgen by this time abhorred Gogyrvan, as a person  of abominably unjust dealings.    \"To take no better care of his own daughter,\" Jurgen considered, \"is  infamous. The man is neglecting his duties as a father, and to do  that is not fair.\"          16.    Divers Imbroglios of King Smoit      Now it befell that for three nights in succession the Princess  Guenevere was unable to converse with Jurgen in the Hall of  Judgment. So upon one of these disengaged evenings Duke Jurgen held  a carouse with Aribert and Urien, two of Gogyrvan's barons, who had  just returned from Pengwaed-Gir, and had queer tales to narrate of  the Trooping Fairies who garrison that place.    All three were seasoned topers, so Jurgen went to bed prepared for  anything. Later he sat up in bed, and found it was much as he had  suspected. The room was haunted, and at the foot of his couch were  two ghosts: one an impudent-looking leering phantom, in a suit of  old-fashioned armor, and the other a beautiful pale lady, in the  customary flowing white draperies.    \"Good-morning to you both,\" says Jurgen, \"and sorry am I that I  cannot truthfully observe I am glad to see you. Though you are  welcome enough if you can manage to haunt the room quietly.\" Then,  seeing that both phantoms looked puzzled, Jurgen proceeded to  explain. \"Last year, when I was traveling upon business in  Westphalia, it was my grief to spend a night in the haunted castle  of Neuedesberg, for I could not get any sleep at all in that place.  There was a ghost in charge who persisted in rattling very large  iron chains and in groaning dismally throughout the night. Then  toward morning he took the form of a monstrous cat, and climbed upon  the foot of my bed: and there he squatted yowling until daybreak.  And as I am ignorant of German, I was not able to convey to him any  idea of my disapproval of his conduct. Now I trust that as  compatriots, or as I might say with more exactness, as former  compatriots, you will appreciate that such behavior is out of all  reason.\"    \"Messire,\" says the male ghost, and he oozed to his full height,  \"you are guilty of impertinence in harboring such a suspicion. I can  only hope it proceeds from ignorance.\"    \"For I am sure,\" put in the lady, \"that I always disliked cats, and  we"]]]
