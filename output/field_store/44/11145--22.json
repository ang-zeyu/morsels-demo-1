In the evening, I stationed myself  close to the tree, and presently had the satisfaction of seeing the  mother return, flying straight to the spot where I had taken her, and in  a few moments she was away again and over the trees with her twins.    Assuming that these two young bats had, before I found them, existed  like parasites clinging to the parent, their adroit actions when  liberated, and their angry demonstrations at my approach, were very  astonishing; for in all other mammals born in a perfectly helpless  state, like rodents, weasels, edentates, and even marsupials, the  instincts of self-preservation are gradually developed after the period  of activity begins, when the mother leads them out, and they play with  her and Avith each other. In the bat the instincts must ripen to  perfection without exercise or training, and while the animal exists as  passively as a fruit on its stem.    I have observed that the helpless young of some of the mammals I have  just mentioned seem at first to have no instinctive understanding of the  language of alarm and fear in the parent, as all young-birds have, even  before their eyes are open. Nor is it necessary that they should have  such an instinct, since, in most cases, they are well concealed in  kennels or other safe places; but when, through some accident, they are  exposed, the want of such an instinct makes the task of protecting them  doubly hard for the parent. I once surprised a weasel (Galictis barbara)  in the act of removing her young, or conducting them, rather; and when  she was forced to quit them, although still keeping close by, and  uttering the most piercing cries of anger and solicitude, the young  continued piteously crying out in their shrill voices and moving about  in circles, without making the slightest attempt to escape, or to  conceal themselves, as young birds do.    Some field mice breed on the surface of the ground in ill-constructed  nests, and their young are certainly the most helpless things in nature.  It is possible that where this dangerous habit exists, the parent has  some admirable complex instincts to safeguard her young, in addition to  the ordinary instincts of most animals of this kind. This idea was  suggested to me by the action of a female mouse which I witnessed by  chance. While walking in a field of stubble one day in autumn, near  Buenos Ayres, I suddenly heard, issuing from near my feet, a chorus of  shrill squealing voices--the familiar excessively sharp little needles  of sound emitted by young, blind and naked mice, when they are disturbed  or in pain. Looking down, I saw close to my foot a nest of them--there  were nine in all, wriggling about and squealing; for the parent,  frightened at my step, had just sprung from them, overturning in her  hurry to escape the slight loosely-felted dome of fine grass and  thistledown which had covered them. I saw her running away, but after  going six or seven yards she stopped, and, turning partly round so as to  watch me, waited in fear and trembling. I remained perfectly  motionless--a sure way to allay fear and suspicion in any wild  creature,--and in a few moments she returned, but with the utmost  caution, frequently pausing to start and tremble, and masking her  approach with corn stumps and little inequalities in the surface of the  ground, until, reaching the nest, she took one of the young in her  mouth, and ran rapidly away to a distance of eight or nine yards and  concealed it in a tuft of dry grass.    Leaving it, she returned a second time, in the same cautious manner, and  taking another, ran with it to the same spot, and concealed it along  with the first. It was curious that the first young mouse had continued  squealing after being hidden by the mother, for I could hear it  distinctly, the air being very still, but when the second mouse had been  placed with it, the squealing ceased. A third time the old mouse came,  and then instead of going to the same spot, as I had expected, she ran  off in an opposite direction and disappeared among the dry weeds; a  fourth was carried to the same place as the third; and in this way they  were all removed to a distance of some yards from the nest, and placed  in couples, until the last and odd one remained. In due time she came  for it, and ran away with it in a new direction, and was soon out of  sight; and although I waited fully ten minutes, she did not return; nor  could I afterwards find any of the young mice when I looked for them, or  even hear them squeal.    I have frequently observed newly-born lambs on the pampas, and have  never failed to be surprised at the extreme imbecility they display in  their actions; although this may be due partly to inherited degeneracy  caused by domestication. This imbecile condition continues for two,  sometimes for three days, during which time the lamb apparently acts  purely from instincts, which are far from perfect; but after that,  experience and its dam teach it a better way. When born its first  impulse is to struggle up on to its feet; its second to suck, but here  it does not discriminate like the newly-hatched bird that picks up its  proper food, or it does not know what to suck. It will take into its  mouth whatever comes near, in most cases a tuft of wool on its dam's  neck; and at this it will continue sucking for an indefinite time. It is  highly probable that the strong-smelling secretion of the sheep's udder  attracts the lamb at length to that part; and that without something of  the kind to guide it, in many cases it would actually starve without  finding the teats. I have often seen lambs many hours after birth still  confining their attention to the most accessible locks of wool on the  neck or fore legs of the dams, and believe that in such cases the long  time it took them to find the source of nourishment arose from a  defective sense of smell. Its next important instinct, which comes into  play from the moment it can stand on its feet, impels it to follow after  any object receding from it, and, on the other hand, to run from  anything approaching it. If the dam turns round and approaches it from  even a very short distance, it will start back and run from her in fear,  and will not understand her voice when she bleats to it: at the same  time it will confidently follow after a man, dog, horse, or any other  animal moving from it. A very common experience on the pampas, in the  sheep-country, is to see a lamb start up from sleep and follow the  rider, running along close to the heels of the horse. This is  distressing to a merciful man, tor he cannot shake the little simpleton  off, and if he rides on, no matter how fast, it will keep up him, or  keep him in sight, for half a mile or a mile, and never recover its dam.  The gaucho, who is not merciful, frequently saves himself all trouble  and delay by knocking it senseless with a blow of his whip-handle, and  without checking his horse. I have seen a lamb, about two days old,  start up from sleep, and immediately start off in pursuit of a puff ball  about as big as a man's head, carried past it over the smooth turf by  the wind, and chase it for a distance of five hundred yards, until the  dry ball was brought to a stop by a tuft of coarse grass. This  blundering instiuct is quickly laid aside when the lamb has learned to  distinguish its dam from other objects, and its dam's voice from other  sounds. When four or five days old it will start from sleep, but instead  of rushing blindly away after any receding object, it first looks about  it, and will then recognize and run to its dam.    I have often been struck with the superiority of the pampa or  creolla--the old native breed of sheep--in the greater vigour of the  young when born over the improved European varieties. The pampa descends  to us from the first sheep introduced into La Plata about three  centuries ago, and is a tall, gaunt bony animal, with lean dry flesh,  like venison, and long straight wool, like goats' hair. In their  struggle for existence in a country subject to sudden great changes of  temperature, to drought, and failure of grass, they have in a great  measure lost the qualities which make the sheep valuable to man as a  food and wool-producing animal; but on the other hand they have to some  extent recovered the vigour of a wild animal, being hardy enough to  exist without any shelter, and requiring from their master man only  protection from the larger carnivores. They are keen-scented, swift of  foot and Wonderfully active, and thrive where other breeds would quickly  starve. I have often seen a lamb dropped on the frosty ground in  bitterly cold windy weather in midwinter, and in less than five seconds  struggle to its feet, and seem as vigorous as any day-old lamb of other  breeds. The dam, impatient at the short delay, and not waiting to give  it suck, has then started off at a brisk trot after the flock, scattered  and galloping before the wind like huanacos rather than sheep, with the  lamb, scarcely a minute in the world, running freely at her side.  Notwithstanding its great vigour it has been proved that the pampa sheep  has not so far outgrown the domestic taint as to be able to maintain its  own existence when left entirely to itself. During the first half of  this century, when cattle-breeding began to be profitable, and wool was  not worth the trouble of shearing, and the gaucho workman would not eat  mutton when beef was to be had, some of the estancieros on the southern  pampas determined to get rid of their sheep, which were of no value to  them; and many flocks were driven a distance out and lost in the wilds.  Out of many thousands thus turned loose to shift for themselves, not one  pair survived to propagate a new race of feral sheep; in a short time  pumas, wild dogs, and other beasts of prey, had destroyed them all. The  sterling qualities of the pampa sheep"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7450"],[0,"Terre Napoleón; a History of French Explorations and Projects in Australia (#17)"],[1,"troubled waters\" is not inaptly associated with that boil of  sea.\"*    (* \"Loud-voiced and reckless as the wild tide-race  That whips our harbour mouth,\"    wrote Mr. Rudyard Kipling (\"Song of the English\") of the people of  Melbourne. It is believed that he meant to be complimentary.)    The south and west of Kangaroo Island were, however, first charted by  Baudin, and his names survive there. Flinders had marked these shores  with a dotted line on his chart, to signify that he had not surveyed  them. He intended to complete this bit of work on his return, but he was  \"caught in the clutch of circumstance,\" and was never permitted to  return. Such names as Cape Borda, Cape Linois, Maupertuis Bay, Cape  Gautheaume, Bougainville Bay, and a few others, preserve the memory of  the French expedition on Kangaroo Island. A rock, known as Frenchman's  Rock, upon which a record of the visit was cut, also survives there.    A few months after the publication of the Terre Napoleon charts in 1807,  the truth about the matter became known. Sir Joseph Banks, who had been  kept well informed by Flinders about the work which he had performed, and  who had done all that was possible to obtain his release from Mauritius,  was influential in scientific circles throughout Europe. Fortunately, he  had ample material at his disposal. Flinders had sent home some finished  charts from Sydney, and during his imprisonment he wrote up a manuscript  journal which he succeeded in getting conveyed to England. It was this  manuscript which the Admiralty permitted to be perused by the writer of  the powerful Quarterly Review article of August 1810. The feeling of  indignation evoked by the treatment which the navigator received was  intensified when the publication of his Voyage and his charts in 1814  showed the measure of his shining merits--his thoroughness, his accuracy,  his diligence, the beauty of his drawings, the vast extent of the  entirely new work which he had done, and the manliness, gentleness,  courage, and fairness of his personal character.    In addition to the discredit, of which he had to bear his full share,  Freycinet was involved in perplexities of another kind. It was a  convenient piece of flattery to name the two great gulfs after Napoleon  and Josephine when they were Emperor and Empress; but the courtier-like  compliment was embarrassing when Josephine was supplanted by Marie  Louise, and it became offensive when Napoleon himself was overthrown and  a Bourbon once more occupied the throne of France. Many of the other  names, too, were those of men no longer in favour. Yet the earlier  volumes of the Voyage de Decouvertes had referred in the text to the  names on the French charts as though they formed a final system of  nomenclature. What was poor Freycinet to do in completing the work? Here,  indeed, was a sailor hoist to his own yard-arm with his own halyard. The  work could not be dropped, since faith had to be kept with purchasers. In  the event, the old names were employed in the text of the completed book,  but a fresh atlas was issued (1817) with the name Terre Napoleon wiped  off the principal chart, most of the names changed to those given by  Flinders and Grant, and a neat note in the corner taking the place of the  former eagle--which was moulting; no longer the screaming fowl it used to  be--announcing that \"this map of New Holland is an exact reduction of  that contained in the first edition.\"* (* \"Cette carte de la  Nouvelle-Hollande est une reduction exacte de celle contenue dans la  premiere edition du Voyage aux Terres Australes.\") The announcement was  not quite true. It was not \"une reduction exacte.\" The imperial bird had  flown, and the names had undergone systematic revision. The Bonaparte  family were pitilessly evicted. It was a new and smaller map, with a new  allocation of names. Freycinet's name appeared upon it, and he probably  wrote the inscription in the corner.      CHAPTER 5. DID THE FRENCH USE FLINDERS' CHARTS?    Assertions commonly made as to French plagiarism of Flinders' charts.  Lack of evidence to support the charges.  General Decaen and his career.  The facts as to Flinders' charts.  The sealed trunks.  The third log-book and its contents; detention of it by Decaen, and the  reasons for his conduct.  Restoration of Flinders' papers, except the log-book and despatches.  Do Freycinet's charts show evidence of the use of Flinders' material?  How did the French obtain their chart of Port Phillip?  Peron's report to Decaen as to British intentions in the Pacific and  Indian Oceans, and the effect on his mind.  Liberation of Flinders.  Capture of Mauritius by the British.  English naval officers and the governor.  Later career of Decaen.    Flinders, in the decrepit little Cumberland, put into Port Louis,  Mauritius, on December 16, 1803. He was not permitted to sail out again  till July 1810; and then he was a broken man, smitten with diseases, the  painful product of exposure, shipwreck, confinement in a tropical  climate, anxiety, and bitter years of heart-sickness and weary  disappointment; yet a brave man still, with some hope nobly burning in  the true hero's heart of him; but with less vitality than hope, so that  he could do no more than write his big book of travel, and then lie down  to die.    Many loose statements have been written about the use which the French  made of Flinders' charts while he was held in captivity. It has been too  often taken for granted that the evidence of plagiarism is beyond  dispute. Not only popular writers, but historians with claims to be  considered scientific, are substantially in agreement on this point. Two  examples will indicate what is meant. Messrs. Becke and Jeffery, in their  Naval Pioneers of Australia (page 216), assert that \"among other  indignities he suffered, he found that the charts taken from him by  Decaen had been appropriated to Baudin's exploring expedition.\" Again, to  take a work appealing to a different section of readers, the Cambridge  Modern History also charges the French with \"the use of his papers to  appropriate for their ships the credit of his discoveries.\"* (* Volume 9  page 739 (Professor Egerton). Two more examples may be cited. Thus,  Laurie, Story of Australasia (1896) page 86. \"He found that his journals  and charts had been stolen by the French governor of the Mauritius and  transferred to Paris, where the fullest advantage was taken of them by M.  Peron.\" Again, Jose, Australasia (1901) page 21: \"His maps were taken to  France to be published there with French names as the work of French  explorers.\")    The charge is, it will be observed, that not only did the French governor  of Mauritius imprison the English navigator despite his passport,  detaining him years after the other members of the Cumberland's company  had been liberated, but that Flinders' charts and papers were improperly  used in the preparation of the history of Baudin's expedition. Indeed,  the accusation is equivalent to one of garrotting: that General Decaen  seized and bound his victim, robbed him, and enabled Freycinet and Peron  to use his work as their own.    So widely has this view been diffused, that probably few will be prepared  for the assurance that there is no evidence to support it. On the  contrary, as will be shown, neither Peron nor Freycinet ever saw any  chart or journal taken from Flinders. Use was made, it is believed, of  one British chart which may possibly have been his--that embodying a  drawing of Port Phillip--but reasons will be given for the opinion that  this, whether it was Flinders' chart or Murray's, was seen by the French  before Baudin's ships left Sydney, and was certainly not copied at  Mauritius.    Before proving these statements, it will be convenient to make the reader  acquainted with the Captain-General or Military-Governor of Mauritius,  Charles Decaen. He was a rough, dogged, somewhat brutal type of soldier,  who had attained to eminence during the revolutionary wars. Born at Caen  in Normandy in 1769, he served during his youth for three years in the  artillery, and then entered a lawyer's office in his native town; but  during the wars of the Revolution, when France was pressed by enemies on  all sides, he threw aside quills and parchments, and, in his twenty-third  year, entered upon his strenuous fighting career. Thenceforth, until  after the signing of the Treaty of Luneville in 1801, he was almost  constantly engaged in military operations. He had risen from the ranks,  and won commendation for stubborn valour from such commanders as Desaix,  Kleber, Hoche, Westermann, and Moreau. He participated in the cruel war  of La Vendee, won fresh laurels during the campaign of the Rhine (1796),  and fought with a furious lust for battle under the noble Moreau at  Hohenlinden. By that time (1800) he had become a general of division, and  on the eve of the battle, when he brought up his force and made his  appearance at a council of war, Moreau greeted him with the flattering  remark, \"Ah! here is Decaen; the battle will be ours to-morrow.\" He was  recognised as a strong-willed general, not brilliant, but very  determined, and as also a thoroughly capable and honest administrator.  Napoleon, in 1803, selected him for Indian service, and stationed him at  the Isle of France (Mauritius), in the hope that if all went well a heavy  blow might some day be struck at British power in India. Decaen was not a  courtier, nor a scholar, nor a man of sentiment, but a plain, coarse,  downright soldier; a true Norman, and a thorough son of the Revolution.  He was not the kind of man to be interested in navigation, discovery, or  the expansion of human knowledge; and appeals made to him on these  grounds on behalf of Flinders were futile. Yet we must do justice to the  admirable side of Decaen's character, by observing that he bore a  reputation for generosity among his fellow-soldiers; and he was"]]]
