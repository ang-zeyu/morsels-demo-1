They believe the      \"Mormon\" community to have as few such as any other association,      religious or political. Within {29} the above period the \"Mormons\"      continued to increase in wealth and numbers, until in the fall of      the year 1838 they numbered about fifteen thousand souls.        They purchased of the Government, or of the citizens, or held      by pre-emption, almost all the lands in the county of Caldwell,      and a portion of the lands in Daviess and Carroll. The county of      Caldwell was settled almost entirely by \"Mormons,\" and \"Mormons\"      were rapidly filling up the counties of Daviess and Caldwell. When      they first commenced settling in those counties, there were but      few settlements made there; the lands were wild and uncultivated.      In the fall of 1838 large farms had been made, well improved and      stocked. Lands had risen in value, and sold for from ten dollars to      twenty-five dollars [per acre]. The improvement and settlement had      been such that it was a common remark that the county of Caldwell      would soon be the wealthiest in the state.        Thus stood their affairs in the fall of 1838, when the storm of      persecution again raged over the heads of the \"Mormons,\" and the      fierce demon of the mob drove them forth houseless and homeless,      and penniless, upon the charities of the world, which to them,      thank God! have been like angels' visits, but not few, or far      between. This last persecution began at an election, which was held      in Daviess county on the first Monday of August, 1838. A \"Mormon\"      went to the polls to vote. One of the mob standing by, opposed his      voting, contending that a \"Mormon\" had no more right to vote than      a negro; one angry word brought on another, and blows followed.      They are, however, happy to state that the \"Mormon\" was not the      aggressor, but was on the defensive: others interfered, not one      alone, but many assailed the \"Mormon.\" His brethren, seeing him      thus assailed by numbers, rushed to the rescue; then came others      of the mob, until finally a general row commenced. The \"Mormons\"      were victorious. The next day, a rumor reached the \"Mormons\" of      Caldwell, that two of their brethren had been killed in this fight,      and a refusal had been made to surrender their bodies for burial.      Not knowing at the time that this rumor was false, they became much      excited, and several of them started for Daviess county, where      they arrived next morning, with a view of giving the brethren,      whom they supposed to have been killed, a decent interment. Among      the citizens this fight produced a great excitement. They held a      public meeting and resolved to drive the \"Mormons\" from the county.      Individuals began also to threaten the \"Mormons\" as a body, and      swear that they should leave the county in three days. When the      \"Mormons\" who had gone from Caldwell to Daviess, aforesaid, arrived      there, they found this state of excitement to exist. They also      heard that a large mob was collecting against them, headed by Adam      Black one of the judges of the county court of Daviess county.        {30} Under these circumstances, and with a view to allay the      excitement, they called on Mr. Black, and inquired of him whether      the reports they had heard in relation to him were true. Upon      his denying them to be true, they then requested him to give      that denial in writing, which he freely did. This writing they      published with a view of calming the public mind, and allaying      the excitement. Having done this, they rested in quiet for some      time after, hoping that their efforts would produce the desired      effect. Their surprise can, under these circumstances, be easily      imagined, when a short time after, they learned that said Black had      gone before Judge King, and made oath that he was forced to sign      the instrument, by armed \"Mormons,\" and procured a warrant for the      arrest of Joseph Smith, Jun., and Lyman Wight, which was placed      in the hands of the sheriff. It was also reported that the said      individuals had refused to surrender themselves, and that an armed      force was collecting to come and take them.        Your Memoralists aver that the sheriff had never made any efforts      to serve the writ, and that the said Smith and Wight, so far from      making any resistance, did not know that such a writ had been      issued, until they learned it first by report as above related. In      the meantime the rumor had run over the whole country, that the      \"Mormons\" were compelling individuals to sign certain instruments      in writing, and that they were resisting the process of the      law. The public mind became much inflamed, and the mob began to      collect from all quarters and in large numbers, with pretensions      of assisting the sheriff to serve the process; and here let it      be observed in passing, that Adam Black had sold the improvement      and pre-emption claim on which he then resided, to the \"Mormons,\"      received his pay for the same, and that through his instrumentality      the \"Mormons\" were driven off, and he now retains both their money      and the improvement.        As soon as the above reports reached the ears of the said Smith      and Wight, they determined immediately upon the course they ought      to pursue, which was to submit to the laws. They both surrendered      themselves up to Judge King, underwent a trial, and in the absence      of all sufficient testimony they were discharged. They hoped      that this voluntary submission of theirs to the law, and their      triumphant vindication of the charge, would allay the excitement      of the community. But not so; the long-desired opportunity had      arrived when the oppression and extermination of the \"Mormons\"      might be made to assume the form of legal proceeding. The mob that      had assembled for the pretended purpose of assisting the officers      in the execution of process, did not disperse upon the acquittal      of Smith and Wight, but continued embodied with the encampments      and forms of a military force, and committing depredations upon      \"Mormon\" property. The \"Mormons\" in this extremity {31} called upon      the laws of the land, and the officers of the law, for protection.      After much delay, the militia under Generals Atchison, Doniphan,      and Parks, were sent to their relief. They arrived on the 13th of      September, and encamped between the \"Mormons\" and the mob.        The above officers made no attempt to disperse the mob, excusing      themselves by saying, \"that their own men had sympathies with      the mob.\" After remaining there for several days, those officers      adopted the following expedient of settling the difficulties--they      mustered the mob, and enrolled them with their own troops, and      then disbanded the whole, with orders to seek their several homes.      The officers went home, excepting Parks, who remained for their      protection, with his men.        The \"Mormons\" made an agreement with the citizens of Daviess,      to buy out their lands and pre-emption rights, and appointed a      committee to make the purchase, and to go on buying till they had      purchased to the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars. While      these purchases were going on, the citizens were heard to say, that      as soon as they had sold out to the \"Mormons\" and received their      pay, they would drive the \"Mormons\" off, and keep both their lands      and the money.        The mob, when disbanded in Daviess by the generals as aforesaid,      instead of repairing to their homes as commanded, proceeded in      a body to the adjoining county of Carroll, and encamped around      Dewitt, a village built and inhabited by \"Mormons;\" while thus      encamped around Dewitt, they sent to the county of Jackson, and      procured a cannon. They invested the place so closely, that no      person could leave the town in safety; when they did so, they were      fired upon by the mob. The horses of the \"Mormons\" were stolen,      and their cattle killed. The citizens of Dewitt, amounting to      about seventy families, were in great extremity, and worn out by      want and sickness. In their extremity they made application to      Governor Boggs for protection and relief; but no protection, no      relief was granted them. When reduced to the last extremity, no      alternative was left them, but to seek protection by flight, and      the abandonment of their homes. Accordingly, on the evening of the      11th of October, 1838, they retreated from Dewitt, and made their      way to the counties of Daviess and Caldwell, leaving many of their      effects in the possession of the mob.        Your Memorialists will not detail the horrors and sufferings of      such a flight, when shared with women and children. They might      detail many. One lady, who had given birth to a child just before      the flight commenced, died on the road and was buried without a      coffin. Many others, sick, worn out, starved, deprived of medical      aid, died upon the road. The remnant of \"Mormons\" from Dewitt      arrived in Daviess and Caldwell, and found a short relief and      supply of their wants from their friends and brethren there.        {32} After the abandonment of Dewitt, and the flight of the      \"Mormons\" from Carroll, one Sashiel Woods addressed the mob,      advising them to take their cannon and march to the county of      Daviess, and drive the \"Mormons\" from that county, and seize upon      their lands and other property, saying that the \"Mormons\" could      get no benefit of the law, as they had recently seen. They then      commenced their march from Carroll to Daviess, carrying with them      the cannon which they had received from Jackson.

How oft have wise men and women sought to      dictate Brother Joseph by saying, \"O, if I were Brother Joseph, I      would do this and that;\" but if they were in Brother Joseph's shoes      they would find that men or women could not be compelled into the      kingdom of God, but must be dealt with in long-suffering, and at      last we shall save them. The way to keep all the Saints together,      and keep the work rolling, is to wait with all long-suffering, till      God shall bring such characters to justice. There should be no      license for sin, but mercy should go hand in hand with reproof.        Sisters of the society, shall there be strife among you? I will      not have it. You must repent, and get the love of God. Away with      self-righteousness. The best measure or principle to bring the poor      to repentance {25} is to administer to their wants. The Ladies'      Relief Society is not only to relieve the poor, but to save souls.        President Smith then said that he would give a lot of land to the      society by deeding to the treasurer, that the society may build      houses for the poor. He also said he would give a house, frame not      finished, and that Brother Cahoon will move it on to the aforesaid      lot, and the society can pay him by giving orders on the store;      that it was a good plan to set those to work who are owing widows,      and thus make an offset, &c.    _Friday, 10_.--Went to Brother Hibbard's with my clerk, to purchase  some land.    _Saturday, 11_.--Presided in city council. Council resolved to publish  the city charter, ordinances of the city council, and Nauvoo Legion,  before the first day of next July. Also resolved that the bond given by  William Marks, binding him to make a deed for the land purchased of him  for a burying ground, for the use of the city, be put on record in the  office for the registry of deeds in the city of Nauvoo.    Riots and mobs are multiplying in the land.    _Sunday, 12_.--Mostly at home. Called at the printing office for some  papers.    [Sidenote: Conditions of English Saints in Nauvoo.]    _Monday, 13_.--Attended a general council in the lodge room to devise  ways and means to furnish the poor with labor. Many of the English  Saints have gathered to Nauvoo, most of whom are unacquainted with any  kind of labor, except spinning, weaving, &c.; and having no factories  in this place, they are troubled to know what to do. Those who have  funds have more generally neglected to gather, and left the poor to  build up the city and the kingdom of God in these last days.    _Tuesday, 14_.--Rode to the big mound on the La Harpe road, accompanied  by Emma, Hiram Kimball, and Dr. Richards, and purchased a three-quarter  section of land of Kimball, including the mound.

Voted that Hiram Clark go immediately to England, take  a letter to gather means of the churches to go on his journey and take  charge of the emigration in England, instead of Amos Fielding; also  collect means for building the Temple, purchase goods, &c., and that  letters be given him to Brother Parley P. Pratt to this effect. Voted  that Brother Fielding come immediately to this place with his family  after his return from England.    John C. Bennett's defense of the proceedings at Nauvoo, &c., may be  seen on the 37th, 38th, and 39th pages of the _Wasp_.    _Wednesday, 15_.--Visited at different places in the city, and my farm  on the prairie, accompanied by my clerk and Orrin Porter Rockwell, and  supped at Hiram Kimball's.    Issued an editorial on the Gift of the Holy Ghost, as follows:--    _The Gift of the Holy Ghost_.        Various and conflicting are the opinions of men in regard to      the gift of the Holy Ghost. Some people have been in the habit      of calling every supernatural manifestation the effects of the      Spirit of God, whilst there are others that think there is no      manifestation connected with it at all; and that it is nothing but      a mere impulse of the mind, or an inward feeling, impression, or      secret testimony or evidence, which men possess, and that there is      no such a thing as an outward manifestation.        It is not to be wondered at that men should be ignorant, in a great      measure, of the principles of salvation, and more especially of      the nature, office, power, influence, gifts, and blessings of the      gift of the Holy Ghost; when we consider that the human family have      been enveloped in gross darkness and ignorance for many centuries      past, without revelation, or any just criterion [by which] to      arrive at a knowledge of the things of God, which can only be known      by the Spirit of God. Hence it not infrequently occurs, that when      the Elders of this Church preach to the inhabitants of the world,      that if they obey the Gospel they shall {27} receive the gift      of the Holy Ghost, that the people expect to see some wonderful      manifestation, some great display of power, or some extraordinary      miracle performed; and it is often the case that young members of      this Church for want of better information, carry along with them      their old notions of things, and sometimes fall into egregious      errors. We have lately had some information concerning a few      members that are in this dilemma, and for their information make a      few remarks upon the subject.        We believe in the gift of the Holy Ghost being enjoyed now, as      much as it was in the Apostles' days; we believe that it [the      gift of the Holy Ghost] is necessary to make and to organize the      Priesthood, that no man can be called to fill any office in the      ministry without it; we also believe in prophecy, in tongues, in      visions, and in revelations, in gifts, and in healings; and that      these things cannot be enjoyed without the gift of the Holy Ghost.      We believe that the holy men of old spake as they were moved by      the Holy Ghost, and that holy men in these days speak by the same      principle; we believe in its being a comforter and a witness      bearer, that it brings things past to our remembrance, leads us      into all truth, and shows us of things to come; be believe that \"no      man can know that Jesus is the Christ, but by the Holy Ghost.\" We      believe in it [this gift of the Holy Ghost] in all its fullness,      and power, and greatness, and glory; but whilst we do this, we      believe in it rationally, consistently, and scripturally, and not      according to the wild vagaries, foolish notions and traditions of      men.        The human family are very apt to run to extremes, especially in      religious matters, and hence people in general, either want some      miraculous display, or they will not believe in the gift of the      Holy Ghost at all. If an Elder lays his hands upon a person, it is      thought by many that the person must immediately rise and speak in      tongues and prophesy; this idea is gathered from the circumstance      of Paul laying his hands upon certain individuals who had been      previously (as they stated) baptized unto John's baptism; which      when he had done, they \"spake in tongues and prophesied.\" Phillip      also, when he had preached the Gospel to the inhabitants of the      city of Samaria, sent for Peter and John, who when they came laid      their hands upon them for the gift of the Holy Ghost; for as yet      he was fallen upon none of them; and when Simon Magus saw that      through the laying on of the Apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was      given, he offered them money that he might possess the same power.      (Acts viii.) These passages are considered by many as affording      sufficient evidence for some miraculous, visible manifestation,      whenever hands are laid on for the gift of the Holy Ghost.        We believe that the Holy Ghost is imparted by the laying on of      hands of those in authority, and that the gift of tongues, and also      the gift of {28} prophecy are gifts of the Spirit, and are obtained      through that medium; but then to say that men always prophesied      and spoke in tongues when they had the imposition of hands, would      be to state that which is untrue, contrary to the practice of the      Apostles, and at variance with holy writ; for Paul says, \"To one      is given the gift of tongues, to another the gift of prophecy, and      to another the gift of healing;\" and again: \"Do all prophesy? do      all speak with tongues? do all interpret?\" evidently showing that      all did not possess these several gifts; but that one received one      gift, and another received another gift--all did not prophesy,      all did not speak in tongues, all did not work miracles; but all      did receive the gift of the Holy Ghost; sometimes they spake in      tongues and prophesied in the Apostles' days, and sometimes they      did not. The same is the case with us also in our administrations,      while more frequently there is no manifestation at all; that is      visible to the surrounding multitude; this will appear plain      when we consult the writings of the Apostles, and notice their      proceedings in relation to this matter. Paul, in 1st Cor. xii,      says, \"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have      you ignorant;\" it is evident from this, that some of them were      ignorant in relation to these matters, or they would not need      instruction.        Again, in chapter xiv, he says, \"Follow after charity and desire      spiritual"]]]
