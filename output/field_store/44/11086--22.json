When she went to  sleep, Rebecca chose that one to dream about.    At four o'clock, on such a roseate summer's morning as even made Great  Gaunt Street look cheerful, the faithful Tinker, having wakened her  bedfellow, and bid her prepare for departure, unbarred and unbolted the  great hall door (the clanging and clapping whereof startled the  sleeping echoes in the street), and taking her way into Oxford Street,  summoned a coach from a stand there.  It is needless to particularize  the number of the vehicle, or to state that the driver was stationed  thus early in the neighbourhood of Swallow Street, in hopes that some  young buck, reeling homeward from the tavern, might need the aid of his  vehicle, and pay him with the generosity of intoxication.    It is likewise needless to say that the driver, if he had any such  hopes as those above stated, was grossly disappointed; and that the  worthy Baronet whom he drove to the City did not give him one single  penny more than his fare.  It was in vain that Jehu appealed and  stormed; that he flung down Miss Sharp's bandboxes in the gutter at the  'Necks, and swore he would take the law of his fare.    \"You'd better not,\" said one of the ostlers; \"it's Sir Pitt Crawley.\"    \"So it is, Joe,\" cried the Baronet, approvingly; \"and I'd like to see  the man can do me.\"    \"So should oi,\" said Joe, grinning sulkily, and mounting the Baronet's  baggage on the roof of the coach.    \"Keep the box for me, Leader,\" exclaims the Member of Parliament to the  coachman; who replied, \"Yes, Sir Pitt,\" with a touch of his hat, and  rage in his soul (for he had promised the box to a young gentleman from  Cambridge, who would have given a crown to a certainty), and Miss Sharp  was accommodated with a back seat inside the carriage, which might be  said to be carrying her into the wide world.    How the young man from Cambridge sulkily put his five great-coats in  front; but was reconciled when little Miss Sharp was made to quit the  carriage, and mount up beside him--when he covered her up in one of his  Benjamins, and became perfectly good-humoured--how the asthmatic  gentleman, the prim lady, who declared upon her sacred honour she had  never travelled in a public carriage before (there is always such a  lady in a coach--Alas! was; for the coaches, where are they?), and the  fat widow with the brandy-bottle, took their places inside--how the  porter asked them all for money, and got sixpence from the gentleman  and five greasy halfpence from the fat widow--and how the carriage at  length drove away--now threading the dark lanes of Aldersgate, anon  clattering by the Blue Cupola of St. Paul's, jingling rapidly by the  strangers' entry of Fleet-Market, which, with Exeter 'Change, has now  departed to the world of shadows--how they passed the White Bear in  Piccadilly, and saw the dew rising up from the market-gardens of  Knightsbridge--how Turnhamgreen, Brentwood, Bagshot, were passed--need  not be told here. But the writer of these pages, who has pursued in  former days, and in the same bright weather, the same remarkable  journey, cannot but think of it with a sweet and tender regret.  Where  is the road now, and its merry incidents of life? Is there no Chelsea  or Greenwich for the old honest pimple-nosed coachmen?  I wonder where  are they, those good fellows? Is old Weller alive or dead? and the  waiters, yea, and the inns at which they waited, and the cold rounds of  beef inside, and the stunted ostler, with his blue nose and clinking  pail, where is he, and where is his generation?  To those great  geniuses now in petticoats, who shall write novels for the beloved  reader's children, these men and things will be as much legend and  history as Nineveh, or Coeur de Lion, or Jack Sheppard.  For them  stage-coaches will have become romances--a team of four bays as  fabulous as Bucephalus or Black Bess.  Ah, how their coats shone, as  the stable-men pulled their clothes off, and away they went--ah, how  their tails shook, as with smoking sides at the stage's end they  demurely walked away into the inn-yard.  Alas!  we shall never hear the  horn sing at midnight, or see the pike-gates fly open any more.  Whither, however, is the light four-inside Trafalgar coach carrying us?  Let us be set down at Queen's Crawley without further divagation, and  see how Miss Rebecca Sharp speeds there.        CHAPTER VIII    Private and Confidential    Miss Rebecca Sharp to Miss Amelia Sedley, Russell Square, London.  (Free.--Pitt Crawley.)    MY DEAREST, SWEETEST AMELIA,    With what mingled joy and sorrow do I take up the pen to write to my  dearest friend!  Oh, what a change between to-day and yesterday! Now I  am friendless and alone; yesterday I was at home, in the sweet company  of a sister, whom I shall ever, ever cherish!    I will not tell you in what tears and sadness I passed the fatal night  in which I separated from you.  YOU went on Tuesday to joy and  happiness, with your mother and YOUR DEVOTED YOUNG SOLDIER by your  side; and I thought of you all night, dancing at the Perkins's, the  prettiest, I am sure, of all the young ladies at the Ball.  I was  brought by the groom in the old carriage to Sir Pitt Crawley's town  house, where, after John the groom had behaved most rudely and  insolently to me (alas! 'twas safe to insult poverty and misfortune!),  I was given over to Sir P.'s care, and made to pass the night in an old  gloomy bed, and by the side of a horrid gloomy old charwoman, who keeps  the house.  I did not sleep one single wink the whole night.    Sir Pitt is not what we silly girls, when we used to read Cecilia at  Chiswick, imagined a baronet must have been.  Anything, indeed, less  like Lord Orville cannot be imagined.  Fancy an old, stumpy, short,  vulgar, and very dirty man, in old clothes and shabby old gaiters, who  smokes a horrid pipe, and cooks his own horrid supper in a saucepan.  He speaks with a country accent, and swore a great deal at the old  charwoman, at the hackney coachman who drove us to the inn where the  coach went from, and on which I made the journey OUTSIDE FOR THE  GREATER PART OF THE WAY.    I was awakened at daybreak by the charwoman, and having arrived at the  inn, was at first placed inside the coach.  But, when we got to a place  called Leakington, where the rain began to fall very heavily--will you  believe it?--I was forced to come outside; for Sir Pitt is a proprietor  of the coach, and as a passenger came at Mudbury, who wanted an inside  place, I was obliged to go outside in the rain, where, however, a young  gentleman from Cambridge College sheltered me very kindly in one of his  several great coats.    This gentleman and the guard seemed to know Sir Pitt very well, and  laughed at him a great deal.  They both agreed in calling him an old  screw; which means a very stingy, avaricious person.  He never gives  any money to anybody, they said (and this meanness I hate); and the  young gentleman made me remark that we drove very slow for the last two  stages on the road, because Sir Pitt was on the box, and because he is  proprietor of the horses for this part of the journey.  \"But won't I  flog 'em on to Squashmore, when I take the ribbons?\" said the young  Cantab.  \"And sarve 'em right, Master Jack,\" said the guard.  When I  comprehended the meaning of this phrase, and that Master Jack intended  to drive the rest of the way, and revenge himself on Sir Pitt's horses,  of course I laughed too.    A carriage and four splendid horses, covered with armorial bearings,  however, awaited us at Mudbury, four miles from Queen's Crawley, and we  made our entrance to the baronet's park in state.  There is a fine  avenue of a mile long leading to the house, and the woman at the  lodge-gate (over the pillars of which are a serpent and a dove, the  supporters of the Crawley arms), made us a number of curtsies as she  flung open the old iron carved doors, which are something like those at  odious Chiswick.    \"There's an avenue,\" said Sir Pitt, \"a mile long. There's six thousand  pound of timber in them there trees.  Do you call that nothing?\" He  pronounced avenue--EVENUE, and nothing--NOTHINK, so droll; and he had a  Mr. Hodson, his hind from Mudbury, into the carriage with him, and they  talked about distraining, and selling up, and draining and subsoiling,  and a great deal about tenants and farming--much more than I could  understand.  Sam Miles had been caught poaching, and Peter Bailey had  gone to the workhouse at last. \"Serve him right,\" said Sir Pitt; \"him  and his family has been cheating me on that farm these hundred and  fifty years.\" Some old tenant, I suppose, who could not pay his rent.  Sir Pitt might have said \"he and his family,\" to be sure; but rich  baronets do not need to be careful about grammar, as poor governesses  must be.    As we passed, I remarked a beautiful church-spire rising above some old  elms in the park; and before them, in the midst of a lawn, and some  outhouses, an old red house with tall chimneys covered with ivy, and  the windows shining in the sun.  \"Is that your church, sir?\" I said.    \"Yes, hang it,\" (said Sir Pitt, only he used, dear, A MUCH WICKEDER  WORD); \"how's Buty, Hodson? Buty's my brother Bute, my dear--my brother  the parson.  Buty and the Beast I call him, ha, ha!\"    Hodson laughed too, and then looking more grave and nodding his head,  said, \"I'm afraid he's better, Sir Pitt.  He was out on his pony  yesterday, looking at our corn.\"    \"Looking after his tithes, hang'un (only he used the same wicked word).  Will brandy and water never kill him? He's as tough as old  whatdyecallum--old Methusalem.\"    Mr. Hodson laughed again.  \"The young men is home from college. They've  whopped John Scroggins till he's well nigh dead.\"  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#17)"],[1,"hour's change in the wind might  have brought a heavy fall of snow, or a sharp frost, or a; deluge of  rain down upon the uncovered and defenceless heads of our live stock.  The poor dear sheep, the source of our income, were after all the least  well-cared for creatures on the Station. A well grassed and watered  run, with sunny vallies for winter feeding, and green hills for summer  pasturage, had been provided by antipodean Nature for them, and to  these advantages we only added some twenty or twenty-five miles of  wire fencing, and then they were left to themselves, with a couple of  shepherds to look after fifteen thousand sheep all the year round.    But yet, busy as we were, we found time to look up a congregation. The  very first Sunday afternoon, whilst we were still in the midst of a  chaos of chips and big boxes and straw and empty china-barrels, our own  shepherds came over, by invitation, and the only very near neighbours we  had--a Scotch head-shepherd and his charming young wife,--and we held a  Service in the half-furnished drawing room. After it was ended we had a  long talk with the men, and they confessed that they had enjoyed it  very much, and would like to come regularly. When questioned as to  the feasibility of inducing others to join, they said that it might  be suggested to more than one distant, lonely hill-shepherd, but his  uncontrollable shyness would probably prevent his attendance.    \"Jim Salter, and Joe Bennett, and a lot more on 'em, would be glad enow  to come, if so be they could feel as how they was truly wellcombe,\" said  our shepherd, Pepper, who prided himself on the elegance and correctness  of his phraseology. He added, after a reflective pause, turning  bashfully away, \"If so be as the lady would just look round and give 'em  a call, they'd be to be persuaded belike.\"    So the scheme was Pepper's after all, you see. But this \"looking round,\"  to which he alluded so airily, meant scrambling rides, varying from ten  to twenty-eight miles in length, over break-neck country, and this  on the slender chance of finding the men in-doors. Now a New Zealand  shepherd almost lives out on the hills, so the prospect of finding  any of our congregation at home was slight indeed. However, as I said  before, F---- stood by me, and although we neither of us could well  spare the time, we agreed to devote two afternoons every week, so long  as the fine open autumn weather, lasted, to making excursions in search  of back-country huts. There are no roads or finger posts or guides of  any sort in those distant places. When we inquired what was the name of  \"Mills\" shepherd (the masters are always plain Smith or Jones, and the  shepherds Mr.----, in the colonies) the answer was generally very vague.  \"Wiry Bill, we mostly calls 'im; but I think I've heerd say his rightful  name was Mr. Pellet, mum. He's a little chap, as strong as the 'ouse,\"  explained Pepper, who was an incorrigible cockney, \"and he lives over  there,\" pointing with his thumb to a mountain range behind us. \"He's in  one of them blind gullies. You go along the gorge of the river till you  come to a saddle all over fern, and you drop down that, and follow the  best o' three or four tracts till you come to a swamp.\"    Here Pepper paused, in consideration of my face of horror; for if there  was one thing I dreaded more than another in those early days, it was a  swamp. Steep hill sides, wide creeks, honey-combed flats, all came in,  the day's ride,--but a swamp! Ugh! the horrible treacherous thing, so  green and innocent looking, with here and there a quicksand or a peaty  morass, in which, without a moment's warning, your horse sank up to his  withers! It was dreadful, and when we came to such a place Helen used to  stop dead short, prick her pretty ears well forward, and, trembling with  fear and excitement, put her nose close to the ground, smelling every  inch, before she would place her fore foot down on it, jumping off it  like a goat if it proved insecure. Generally she crossed a swamp, by a  series of bounds in and out of flax bushes; and hopeless indeed would a  morass be without those green cities of refuge!    Horrible as a large swamp is however to a timid horsewoman, it is dear  to the heart of a cockatoo. He gladly buys a freehold of fifty acres  in the midst of one, burns it, makes a sod fence, sown with gorse seed  a-top, all round his section, drains it in a rough and ready fashion,  and then the splendid fertile soil which has been waiting for so many  thousand years, \"brings forth fruit abundantly.\" Such enormous fields of  wheat and oats and barley as you come upon sometimes,--with, alas, never  a market near enough to enable the plenteous crop to return sevenfold  into its master's bosom!    I shall not inflict upon you a description of all our rides in search of  members for our congregation. Two, in widely differing directions,  will serve as specimens of such excursions. In consideration of my  new-chumishness, F---- selected a comparatively easy track for our  first ride. And yet, \"bad was the best,\" might surely be said of that  breakneck path. What would an English horse, or an English lady say,  to riding for miles over a slippery winding ledge on a rocky hill side,  where a wall of solid mountain rose up perpendicularly on the right  hand, and on the left a very respectable sized river hurried over its  boulders far beneath the aerial path; yet this was comparatively a  safe track, and presented but one serious obstacle, over which I was  ruthlessly taken. It is perhaps needless to say we were riding in  single file, and equally unnecessary to state that I was the last; for  certainly we should never have made much progress otherwise. Helen, my  bay mare, would follow her stable companion, on which F---- was mounted,  so that was the way we got on at all.    A sudden sharp turn showed me what appeared to be a low stone wall  running own the spur of the mountain, right across our track, and I had  already begun to disquiet myself about the possibility of turning back  on such a narrow ledge, when I saw F----'s powerful black horse, with  his ears well forward, and his reins, lying loose on his neck, make a  sort of rush at the obstacle, climb up it as a cat would, stand for  an instant, exactly like a performing goat, with all four legs drawn  closely together under him, and then with a spring disappear on the  other side. \"This wall\", I thought, \"must be but loosely built, for  _Leo_ has displaced some of the stones from its coping.\" Helen, pretty  dear, hurried after her friend and leader; and before I had time to  realize what she was going to do, she was balancing herself on the  crumbling summit of this stone wall (which was only the freak of a  landslip), and as it proved impossible to remain there, perched like  a bird on a very insecure branch, nothing remained except to gather  herself well together and jump off. But what a jump! the ground fell  sheer away at the foot of the wall, and left a chasm many feet wide,  which the horse could not see until it had climbed to the top of the  wall, and as turning back was out of the question, the only alternative  was to give a vigorous bound on to the narrow ledge beyond. Terrified as  I felt, I luckily refrained from jerking Helen's head, or attempting to  guide her in any way. The only chance of safety over New Zealand tracks,  or New Zealand creeks, is to leave your horse _entirely_ to itself. I  have seen men who were reckoned good riders in England, get the most  ignominious tumbles from a disregard of this advice. An up-country horse  knows perfectly well the only sound spots in a swamp; or the only sound  part of a creek's banks. If his rider persists in taking him over the  latter, where he himself thinks it narrowest and safest, he is pretty  sure to find the earth rotten and crumbling, and to pay for his  obstinacy by a wetting; whilst in the case of a swamp the consequences  are even more serious, and the horse often gets badly strained in  floundering out of a quagmire.    But it was not all danger and difficulty, and the many varieties of  scene in the course of a long ride constituted some of its chief charms.  At first, perhaps, after we had left our own fair valley behind, the  track would wind through the gorge of a river, with lofty mountains  rising sheer up from the water side. All here was sad and grey, and very  solemn in its eternal silence, only made more intense by the ceaseless  monotonous roar of the ever-rushing water. Then we would emerge on acres  and acres of softly rolling downs, higher than the hillocks we call by  that name at home, but still marvellously beautiful in their swelling  curves all folding so softly into each other, and dotted with mobs of  sheep, making pastoral music to a flock-owner's ear. Over this sort of  ground we could canter gaily along, with \"Hector,\" F----'s pet colley,  keeping close to the heels of his master's horse,--for it is the worst  of bad manners in a colley to look at a neighbour's sheep. The etiquette  in passing through a strange run is for the dog to go on the off side of  his master's horse, so that the sheep shall not even see him; and this  piece of courtly politeness Hector always practised of his own accord.    A wire fence always proved a very tiresome obstacle, for horses have  a great dread of them, and will not be induced to jump them on any  account. If we could find out where the gate was, well and good; but as  it might be half a dozen miles off, on one side or the other, we seldom  lost time or patience in seeking it. When there was no help for it, and  such a fence had to be crossed, the proceedings were, always the same.  F----dismounted, and unfastened one of his stirrup leathers; with this  he strapped the wires as firmly as possible together, but if the fence  had been lately fresh-strained, it was sometimes a difficult task.  Still he generally made"]]]
