She's going to be married to a clergyman.\"    \"How did you find out?\"    \"Why, it's the most curious thing.  You know my blue lawn, which Miss  James is making.  This morning I went to try it on, Miss Barnes with  me of course, and while Miss James was fitting the waist Mrs. Seccomb  came in and sat down on the sofa by Miss Barnes.  They began to talk,  and pretty soon Mrs. Seccomb said, 'What day does Mrs. Florence go?\"    \"'Thursday week,' said Miss Barnes.  She sort of mumbled it, and  looked to see if I were listening.  I wasn't; but of course after  that I did,--as hard as I could.    \"'And where does the important event take place?' asked Mrs. Seccomb.  She's so funny with her little bit of a mouth and her long words.  She always looks as if each of them was a big pill, and she wanted  to swallow it and couldn't.    \"'In Lewisberg, at her sister's house,' said Miss Barnes.  She mumbled  more than ever, but I heard.    \"'What a deplorable loss she will be to our limited circle!' said Mrs.  Seccomb.  I couldn't imagine what they meant.  But don't you think,  when I got home there was this letter from Sylvia, and she says, 'Your  adored Mrs. Florence is going to be married.  I'm afraid you'll all  break your hearts about it.  Mother met the gentleman at a party the  other night.  She says he looks clever, but isn't at all handsome,  which is a pity, for Mrs. Florence is a raving beauty in my opinion.  He's an excellent preacher, we hear; and won't she manage the parish  to perfection?  How shall you like being left to the tender mercies  of Mrs. Nipson?'  Now did you ever hear any thing so droll in your  life?\" went on Rose, folding up her letter.  \"Just think of those two  things coming together the same day!  It's like a sum in arithmetic,  with an answer which 'proves' the sum, isn't it?\"    Rose had counted on producing an effect, and she certainly was not  disappointed.  The girls could think and talk of nothing else for  the remainder of that afternoon.    It was a singular fact that before two days were over every scholar  in the school knew that Mrs. Florence was going to be married!  How  the secret got out, nobody could guess.  Rose protested that it  wasn't her fault,--she had been a miracle of discretion, a perfect  sphinx; but there was a guilty laugh in her eyes, and Katy suspected  that the sphinx had unbent a little.  Nothing so exciting had ever  happened at the Nunnery before.  Some of the older scholars were  quite inconsolable.  They bemoaned themselves, and got together in  corners to enjoy the luxury of woe.  Nothing comforted them but the  project of getting up a \"testimonial\" for Mrs. Florence.    What this testimonial should be caused great discussion in the school.  Everybody had a different idea, and everybody was sure that her idea  was better than anybody's else.  All the school contributed.  The  money collected amounted to nearly forty dollars, and the question  was, What should be bought?    Every sort of thing was proposed.  Lilly Page insisted that nothing  could possibly be so appropriate as a bouquet of wax flowers and a  glass shade to put over it.  There was a strong party in favor of  spoons.  Annie Silsbie suggested \"a statue;\" somebody else a clock.  Rose Red was for a cabinet piano, and Katy had some trouble in  convincing her that forty dollars would not buy one.  Bella demanded  that they should get \"an organ.\"    \"You can go along with it as monkey,\" said Rose, which remark made  Bella caper with indignation.    At last, after long discussion and some quarelling, a cake-basket was  fixed upon.  Sylvia Redding happened to be making a visit in Boston,  and Rose was commissioned to write and ask her to select the gift  and send it up by express.  The girls could hardly wait till it came.    \"I do hope it will be pretty, don't you?\" they said over and over  again.  When the box arrived, they all gathered to see it opened.  Esther Dearborn took out the nails, half a dozen hands lifted the  lid, and Rose unwrapped the tissue paper and displayed the basket  up to general view.    \"Oh, what a beauty!\" cried everybody.  It was woven of twisted silver  wire.  Two figures of children with wings and garlands supported the  handle on either side.  In the middle of the handle were a pair of  silver doves, billing and cooing in the most affectionate way, over  a tiny shield, on which were engraved Mrs. Florence's initials.    \"I never saw one like it!\"  \"Doesn't it look heavy?\" cried a chorus  of voices, as Rose, highly gratified, held up the basket.    \"Who shall present it?\" asked Louisa Agnew.    \"Rose Red,\" said some of the girls.    \"No, indeed, I'm not tall enough,\" protested Rose, \"it must be somebody  who'd kind of sweep into the room and be impressive.  I vote for Katy.\"    \"Oh, no!\" said Katy, shrinking back, \"I shouldn't do it well at all.  Suppose we put it to a vote.\"    Ellen Gray cut some slips of paper, and each girl wrote a name and  dropped it into the box.  When the votes were counted, Katy's name  appeared on all but three.    \"I propose that we make this vote unanimous,\" said Rose, highly  delighted.  The girls agreed; and Rose, jumping on a chair, exclaimed,  \"Three cheers for Katy Carr! keep time, girls,--one, two, hip, hip,  hurrah!\"    The hurrahs were given with enthusiasm, for Katy, almost without  knowing it, had become popular.  She was too much touched and  pleased to speak at first.  When she did, it was to protest against  her election.    \"Esther would do it beautifully,\" she said, \"and I think Mrs. Florence  would like the basket better if she gave it.  You know ever since\"--  she stopped.  Even now she could not refer with composure to the  affair of the note.    \"Oh!\" cried Louisa, \"she's thinking of that ridiculous note Mrs.  Florence made such a fuss about.  As if anybody supposed you wrote  it, Katy!  I don't believe even Miss Jane is such a goose as that.  Any way, if she is, that's one reason more why you should present  the basket, to show that we don't think so.\"  She gave Katy a kiss  by way of period.    \"Yes, indeed, you're chosen, and you must give it,\" cried the others.    \"Very well,\" said Katy, extremely gratified, \"what am I to say?\"    \"We'll compose a speech for you,\" replied Rose, \"sugar your voice,  Katy, and, whatever you do, stand up straight.  Don't crook over,  as if you thought you were tall.  It's a bad trick you have, child,  and I'm always sorry to see it,\" concluded Rose, with the air of a  wise mamma giving a lecture.    It is droll how much can go on in a school unseen and unsuspected by  its teachers.  Mrs. Florence never dreamed that the girls had guessed  her secret.  Her plan was to go away as if for a visit, and leave Mrs.  Nipson to explain at her leisure.  She was therefore quite unprepared  for the appearance of Katy, holding the beautiful basket, which was  full of fresh roses, crimson, white, and pink.  I am afraid the rules  of the S. S. U. C. had been slightly relaxed to allow of Rose Red's  getting these flowers; certainly they grew nowhere in Hillsover except  in Professor Seccomb's garden!    \"The girls wanted me to give you this, with a great deal of love from  us all,\" said Katy, feeling strangely embarrassed, and hardly venturing  to raise her eyes.  She set the basket on the table.  \"We hope that  you will be happy,\" she added in a low voice, and moved toward the  door.  Mrs. Florence had been to much surprised to speak, but now  she called, \"Wait!  Come back a moment.\"    Katy came back.  Mrs. Florence's cheeks were flushed.  She looked very  handsome.  Katy almost thought there were tears in her eyes.    \"Tell the girls that I thank them very much.  Their present is  beautiful.  I shall always value it.\"  She blushed as she spoke, and  Katy blushed too.  It made her shy to see the usually composed Mrs.  Florence so confused.    \"What did she say?  What did she say?\" demanded the others, who were  collected in groups round the school-room door to hear a report of  the interview.    Katy repeated her message.  Some of the girls were disappointed.    \"Is that all?\" they said.  \"We thought she would stand up and make a  speech.\"    \"Or a short poem,\" put in Rose Red,--\"a few stanzas thrown off on the  spur of the moment; like this, for instance:--                         \"Thank you, kindly, for your basket,                      Which I didn't mean to ask it;                      But I'll very gladly take it,                      And when 'tis full of cake, it                      Will frequently remind me                      Of the girls I left behind me!      There was a universal giggle, which brought Miss Jane out of the  school-room.    \"Order!\" she said, ringing the bell.  \"Young ladies, what are you  about?  Study hour has begun.\"    \"We're so sorry Mrs. Florence is going away,\" said some of the girls.    \"How did you know that she is going?\" demanded Miss Jane, sharply.  Nobody answered.    Next day Mrs. Florence left.  Katy saw her go with a secret regret.    \"If only she would have said that she didn't believe I wrote that  note!\" she told Clover.    \"I don't care what she believes!  She's a stupid, unjust woman!\"  replied independent little Clover.    Mrs. Nipson was now in sole charge of the establishment.  She had  never tried school-keeping before, and had various pet plans and  theories of her own, which she had only been waiting for Mrs.  Florence's departure to put into practice.    One of these was that the school was to dine three times a week on  pudding and bread and butter.  Mrs. Nipson had a theory,--very  convenient and economical for herself, but highly distasteful to her  scholars,--that it was injurious for young people to eat meat every  day in hot weather.    The puddings were made of batter, with a sprinkling of blackberries  or raisins.

Though no detailed summary of airship activities is possible now, it is  no secret that, just as in the last war, the submarines avoided attack  upon convoys where airships were on guard. The German high command  tacitly admitted that this was one type that the U-boats did not want to  meet, an enemy immune to its torpedoes, whose presence the sub's  under-water detectors did not reveal, and which might appear overhead  without warning. Admiral Doenitz, commanding the German submarine force,  testified in a press interview to their respect for our blimps.    The battle against the submarines will be long and difficult, and ships  will still go down and men will be lost, but the chase will be  relentless as long as the menace exists. Airships, non-rigid, have taken  their place in that phase of America's war effort.

Rosendahl's, \"What About the Airship?\"  (Scribner's), and \"Up Ship\" (Dodd Mead); Captain Ernst Lehmann's  \"Zeppelin\" (Longman's) and Captain J. A. Sinclair's \"Airships in Peace  and War\" (Rich & Cowan, London).
