She is very bonny, but  it may not do her any good to know it.\"    \"It won't harm her,\" said Eric confidently. \"When a belief in her  ugliness hasn't spoiled a girl a belief in her beauty won't.\"    But Janet did not understand epigrams. She carefully removed a little  dust from the polished surface, and frowned meditatively at the by no  means beautiful reflection she saw therein.    \"I cannot think what made Kilmeny suppose she was ugly, Master.\"    \"Her mother told her she was,\" said Eric, rather bitterly.    \"Ah!\" Janet shot a quick glance at the picture of her sister. \"Was that  it? Margaret was a strange woman, Master. I suppose she thought her own  beauty had been a snare to her. She WAS bonny. That picture doesn't do  her justice. I never liked it. It was taken before she was--before she  met Ronald Fraser. We none of us thought it very like her at the time.  But, Master, three years later it was like her--oh, it was like her  then! That very look came in her face.\"    \"Kilmeny doesn't resemble her mother,\" remarked Eric, glancing at the  picture with the same feeling of mingled fascination and distaste with  which he always regarded it. \"Does she look like her father?\"    \"No, not a great deal, though some of her ways are very like his. She  looks like her grandmother--Margaret's mother, Master. Her name was  Kilmeny too, and she was a handsome, sweet woman. I was very fond of my  stepmother, Master. When she died she gave her baby to me, and asked me  to be a mother to it. Ah well, I tried; but I couldn't fence the sorrow  out of Margaret's life, and it sometimes comes to my mind that maybe  I'll not be able to fence it out of Kilmeny's either.\"    \"That will be my task,\" said Eric.    \"You'll do your best, I do not doubt. But maybe it will be through you  that sorrow will come to her after all.\"    \"Not through any fault of mine, Aunt Janet.\"    \"No, no, I'm not saying it will be your fault. But my heart misgives me  at times. Oh, I dare say I am only a foolish old woman, Master. Go your  ways and bring your lass here to look at your plaything when you like.  I'll not make or meddle with it.\"    Janet betook herself to the kitchen and Eric went to look for Kilmeny.  She was not in the orchard and it was not until he had searched for some  time that he found her. She was standing under a beech tree in a field  beyond the orchard, leaning on the longer fence, with her hands clasped  against her cheek. In them she held a white Mary-lily from the orchard.  She did not run to meet him while he was crossing the pasture, as she  would once have done. She waited motionless until he was close to her.  Eric began, half laughingly, half tenderly, to quote some lines from her  namesake ballad:        \"'Kilmeny, Kilmeny, where have you been?      Long hae we sought baith holt and den,--      By linn, by ford, and greenwood tree!      Yet you are halesome and fair to see.      Where got you that joup o' the lily sheen?      That bonny snood o' the birk sae green,      And those roses, the fairest that ever was seen?      Kilmeny, Kilmeny, where have you been?'    \"Only it's a lily and not a rose you are carrying. I might go on and  quote the next couplet too--        \"'Kilmeny looked up with a lovely grace,      But there was nae smile on Kilmeny's face.'    \"Why are you looking so sober?\"    Kilmeny did not have her slate with her and could not answer; but Eric  guessed from something in her eyes that she was bitterly contrasting the  beauty of the ballad's heroine with her own supposed ugliness.    \"Come down to the house, Kilmeny. I have something there to show  you--something lovelier than you have ever seen before,\" he said, with  boyish pleasure shining in his eyes. \"I want you to go and put on that  muslin dress you wore last Sunday evening, and pin up your hair the same  way you did then. Run along--don't wait for me. But you are not to go  into the parlour until I come. I want to pick some of those Mary-lilies  up in the orchard.\"    When Eric returned to the house with an armful of the long stemmed,  white Madonna lilies that bloomed in the orchard Kilmeny was just coming  down the steep, narrow staircase with its striped carpeting of homespun  drugget. Her marvelous loveliness was brought out into brilliant relief  by the dark wood work and shadows of the dim old hall.    She wore a trailing, clinging dress of some creamy tinted fabric that  had been her mother's. It had not been altered in any respect, for  fashion held no sway at the Gordon homestead, and Kilmeny thought  that the dress left nothing to be desired. Its quaint style suited  her admirably; the neck was slightly cut away to show the round white  throat, and the sleeves were long, full \"bishops,\" out of which her  beautiful, slender hands slipped like flowers from their sheaths. She  had crossed her long braids at the back and pinned them about her head  like a coronet; a late white rose was fastened low down on the left  side.        \"'A man had given all other bliss      And all his worldly wealth for this--      To waste his whole heart in one kiss      Upon her perfect lips,'\"    quoted Eric in a whisper as he watched her descend. Aloud he said,    \"Take these lilies on your arm, letting their bloom fall against your  shoulder--so. Now, give me your hand and shut your eyes. Don't open them  until I say you may.\"    He led her into the parlour and up to the mirror.    \"Look,\" he cried, gaily.    Kilmeny opened her eyes and looked straight into the mirror where, like  a lovely picture in a golden frame, she saw herself reflected. For a  moment she was bewildered. Then she realized what it meant. The lilies  fell from her arm to the floor and she turned pale. With a little low,  involuntary cry she put her hands over her face.    Eric pulled them boyishly away.    \"Kilmeny, do you think you are ugly now? This is a truer mirror than  Aunt Janet's silver sugar bowl! Look--look--look! Did you ever imagine  anything fairer than yourself, dainty Kilmeny?\"    She was blushing now, and stealing shy radiant glances at the mirror.  With a smile she took her slate and wrote naively,    \"I think I am pleasant to look upon. I cannot tell you how glad I am.  It is so dreadful to believe one is ugly. You can get used to everything  else, but you never get used to that. It hurts just the same every time  you remember it. But why did mother tell me I was ugly? Could she really  have thought so? Perhaps I have become better looking since I grew up.\"    \"I think perhaps your mother had found that beauty is not always  a blessing, Kilmeny, and thought it wiser not to let you know you  possessed it. Come, let us go back to the orchard now. We mustn't waste  this rare evening in the house. There is going to be a sunset that we  shall remember all our lives. The mirror will hang here. It is yours.  Don't look into it too often, though, or Aunt Janet will disapprove. She  is afraid it will make you vain.\"    Kilmeny gave one of her rare, musical laughs, which Eric never heard  without a recurrence of the old wonder that she could laugh so when she  could not speak. She blew an airy little kiss at her mirrored face and  turned from it, smiling happily.    On their way to the orchard they met Neil. He went by them with an  averted face, but Kilmeny shivered and involuntarily drew nearer to  Eric.    \"I don't understand Neil at all now,\" she wrote nervously. \"He is not  nice, as he used to be, and sometimes he will not answer when I speak  to him. And he looks so strangely at me, too. Besides, he is surly and  impertinent to Uncle and Aunt.\"    \"Don't mind Neil,\" said Eric lightly. \"He is probably sulky because of  some things I said to him when I found he had spied on us.\"    That night before she went up stairs Kilmeny stole into the parlour for  another glimpse of herself in that wonderful mirror by the light of a  dim little candle she carried. She was still lingering there dreamily  when Aunt Janet's grim face appeared in the shadows of the doorway.    \"Are you thinking about your own good looks, lassie? Ay, but  remember that handsome is as handsome does,\" she said, with grudging  admiration--for the girl with her flushed cheeks and shining eyes was  something that even dour Janet Gordon could not look upon unmoved.    Kilmeny smiled softly.    \"I'll try to remember,\" she wrote, \"but oh, Aunt Janet, I am so glad I  am not ugly. It is not wrong to be glad of that, is it?\"    The older woman's face softened.    \"No, I don't suppose it is, lassie,\" she conceded. \"A comely face is  something to be thankful for--as none know better than those who have  never possessed it. I remember well when I was a girl--but that is  neither here nor there. The Master thinks you are wonderful bonny,  Kilmeny,\" she added, looking keenly at the girl.    Kilmeny started and a scarlet blush scorched her face. That, and the  expression that flashed into her eyes, told Janet Gordon all she wished  to know. With a stifled sigh she bade her niece good night and went  away.    Kilmeny ran fleetly up the stairs to her dim little room, that looked  out into the spruces, and flung herself on her bed, burying her burning  face in the pillow. Her aunt's words had revealed to her the hidden  secret of her heart. She knew that she loved Eric Marshall--and the  knowledge brought with it a strange anguish. For was she not dumb? All  night she lay staring wide-eyed through the darkness till the dawn.        CHAPTER XIV. IN HER SELFLESS MOOD    Eric noticed a change in Kilmeny at their next meeting--a change that  troubled him. She seemed aloof, abstracted, almost ill at ease. When he  proposed an excursion to the orchard he thought she was reluctant to go.  The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53416"],[0,"Only a Girl's Love (#17)"],[1,"d.    Mr. Etheridge painted on, deaf to both of them.    \"No,\" he said, looking at the picture with a cold smile. \"It is like  him, but it--honors him. It endows him with a poetry which he does not  possess.\"    \"You know him?\" said Stella.    \"Who does not?\" he answered, and his thin lips curled with a smiling  sneer.    A faint color came into Stella's face, and she raised her eyes for a  moment.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean that Lord Leycester has made himself too famous--I was going to  say infamous--\"    A vivid crimson rushed to her face, and left it pale again the next  instant.    \"Do not,\" she said, then added quickly, \"I mean do not forget that he  is not here to defend himself.\"    He looked at her with a sinister scrutiny.    \"I beg your pardon. I did not know he was a friend of yours,\" he said.    She raised her eyes and looked at him steadily.    \"Lord Leycester is no friend of mine,\" she said, quietly.    \"I am glad of it,\" he responded.    Stella's eyes darkened and deepened in a way peculiar to her, and her  color came. It was true that Lord Leycester was no friend of hers, she  had but seen and spoken with him by chance, and for a few moments; but  who was this Mr. Adelstone that he should presume to be glad or sorry  on her account?    He was quick to see that he had made a slip, and quick to recover  himself.    \"Pray forgive me if I have presumed too far upon our slight  acquaintance, but I was only thinking at that moment that you had been  so short a time in England as to be ignorant of people who are well  known to us with whom they have lived, and that you would not know Lord  Leycester's real character.\"    Stella inclined her head gravely. Something within her stirred her to  take up arms in the absent man's defense; the one word \"infamous,\"  stuck and rankled in her mind.    \"You said that Lord Leycester was 'infamous,'\" she said, with a grave  smile. \"Surely that is too strong a word.\"    He thought a moment, his eyes resting on her face keenly.    \"Perhaps, but I am not sure. I certainly used it as a play upon the  word 'famous,' but I don't think even then that I did him an injustice.  A man whose name is known all over the country--whose name is familiar  as a household word--must be notorious either for good or evil, for  wisdom or folly. Lord Leycester is not famous for virtue or wisdom. I  cannot say any more.\"    Stella turned aside, a faint crimson dyeing her face, a strange thrill  of pity, ay, and of impatience, at her heart. Why should he be so  wicked, so mad and reckless--so notorious that even this self-satisfied  young gentleman could safely moralize about him and warn her against  making his acquaintance! \"Oh, the pity of it--the pity of it!\" as  Shakespeare has it--that one with such a beautiful, god-look face,  should be so bad.    There was a few moments' silence. Jasper Adelstone still stood with  the picture in his hand, but glancing at Stella's face with covert  watchfulness. For all his outward calmness, his heart was beating  quickly. Stella's was the sort of beauty to make a man's heart beat  quickly, or not at all; those who came to offer at her shrine would  offer no half-measured oblations. As he watched her his heart beat  wildly, and his small, bright eyes glittered. He had thought her  beautiful at the party last night, where she had outshone all the other  girls of the village as a star outshines a rushlight; but this morning  her loveliness revealed itself in all its fresh purity, and he--Jasper  Adelstone, the critical man of the world, the man whose opinion about  women was looked upon by his companions in Lincoln's-inn and the  bachelors' haunts at the West-end as worth having--felt his heart  slipping from him. He put the picture down and approached her.    \"You have no idea how beautiful and fresh the meadows are. Will you  stroll down to the river with me?\" he said, resolving to take her by  surprise and capture her.    But he did not know Stella. She was only a school-girl--innocent and  ignorant of the ways of men and the world; but, perhaps, because  of that--because she had not learnt the usual hackneyed words of  evasion--the ordinary elementary tactics of flirtation, she was not to  be taken by surprise.    With a smile she turned her eyes upon him and shook her head.    \"Thank you; no, that is impossible. I have all my household duties  to perform, and that\"--pointing to the sun with her white slim  hand--\"reminds me that it is time I set about them.\"    He took up his hat instantly, turning to hide the frown that knitted  his brow and spoiled his face, and went up to the painter to say  \"good-morning.\"    Mr. Etheridge started and stared at him; he had quite forgotten his  presence.    \"Good-morning, good-morning--going? I beg your pardon. Won't you stop  and take some tea with us?\"    \"Mr. Adelstone would like some dinner first, uncle,\" said Stella.    Then she gave him her hand.    \"Good-morning,\" she said, \"and thank you very much for the flowers.\"    He held her hand as long as he dared, then passed out.    Stella, perhaps unconsciously, gave a sigh of relief.    \"Very nice young fellow, my dear,\" said Mr. Etheridge, without taking  his eyes from the canvas. \"Very clever, too. I remember him quite a  little boy, and always said he would make his way. They say that he has  done so. I am not surprised. Jasper----\"    \"Jasper!\" said Stella. \"What a horrible name.\"    \"Eh? Horrible? I don't know--I don't know.\"    \"But I do,\" said Stella, laughing. \"Well, what were you going to say?\"    \"That Jasper Adelstone is the sort of man to insist upon having  anything he sets his heart upon.\"    \"I am glad to hear it,\" said Stella, as she opened the door, \"for his  sake; and I hope, also for his sake, that he won't set his mind upon  the sun or the moon!\" and with a laugh she ran away.    In the kitchen Mrs. Penford was awaiting her with unconcealed  impatience. Upon the white scrubbed table stood the preparations for  the making of pastry, an art which Stella, who had insisted upon making  herself useful, had coaxed Mrs. Penfold into teaching her. At first  that good woman had insisted that Stella should do nothing in the  little household. She had announced with terrible gravity that such  things weren't becoming to a young lady like Miss Stella, and that she  had always done for Mr. Etheridge, and she always would; but before  the second day had passed Stella had won the battle. As Mrs. Penfold  said, there was no resisting the girl, who mingled willfulness with  bewitching firmness and persuasion, and Mrs. Penfold had given in.  \"You'll cover yourself with flour, Miss Stella, and give your uncle the  indigestion, miss, that you will,\" she remonstrated.    \"But the flour will brush off, and uncle needn't eat pies and puddings  for a little while; I'll eat them, I don't mind indigestion,\" Stella  declared, and she made a delightfully piquant little apron, which  completed Mrs. Penfold's conquest.    With a song upon her lips she burst into the kitchen and caught up the  rolling pin.    \"Am I not awfully late?\" she exclaimed. \"I was afraid you would have  done it all before I came, but you wouldn't be so mean as to take an  advantage, would you?\"    Mrs. Penfold grunted.    \"It's all nonsense, Miss Stella, there's no occasion for it.\"    Stella, with her hand in the flour, elevated the rolling-pin in heroic  style.    \"Mrs. Penfold!\" she exclaimed, with the air of a princess, \"the woman,  be her station what it may, who cannot make a jam roley-poley or an  apple tart is unworthy the name of an Englishwoman. Give me the jam;  stop though, don't you think rhubarb would be very nice for a change?\"    \"I wish you'd go and play the organ, Miss Stella, and leave the rhubarb  alone.\"    \"Man cannot live on music,\" retorted Stella; \"his soul craves for  puddings. I wonder whether uncle's soul craves for jam or rhubarb. I  think I'll go and ask him,\" and dropping the rolling-pin--which Mrs.  Penfold succeeded in catching before it fell on the floor--she wiped  her hand of a fifteenth part of the floor and ran into the studio.    \"Uncle! I have come to lay before you the rival claims of rhubarb  and strawberry jam. The one is sweet and luscious to the taste, but  somewhat cloying; the other is fresh and young, but somewhat sour----\"    \"Good Heavens! What are you talking about?\" exclaimed the bewildered  painter, staring at her.    \"Rhubarb or jam. Now, noble Roman, speak or die!\" she exclaimed with  upraised arm, her eyes dancing, her lips apart with rippling laughter.    Mr. Etheridge stared at her with all an artist's admiration in his eyes.    \"Oh! the pudding,\" he said, then he suddenly stopped, and stared beyond  her.          CHAPTER VI.      Stella heard a step on the threshold of the window, and turning to  follow the direction of his eyes, saw the stalwart form of Lord  Leycester standing in the window.    He was dressed in a suit of brown velveteen, with tight-fitting  breeches and stockings, and carried a whip in his hand with which he  barred the entrance against a couple of colleys, a huge mastiff, and a  Skye terrier, the last barking with furious indignation at being kept  outside.    Even at the moment of surprise, Stella was conscious of a sudden  reluctant thrill of admiration for the graceful figure in the  close-fitting velvet, and the handsome face with its dark eyes  regarding her with a grave, respectful intenseness.    \"Back dogs!\" he said. \"Go back, Vix!\" then as they drew back, the big  ones throwing themselves down on the path with patient obedience, he  came into the room.    \"I beg your pardon,\" he said, standing before Stella, his head bent. \"I  thought Mr. Etheridge was alone, or I should not have entered in this  rough fashion.\"    As he spoke in the lane, so now it was no meaningless excuse, but  with a tone of most reverential respect and proud humility, Stella,  girl-like, noticed that he did not even venture"]]]
