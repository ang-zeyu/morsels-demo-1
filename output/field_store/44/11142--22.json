[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7353"],[0,"Birds in Town & Village (#17)"],[1,"  all this is so sharp that, compared with it, the creeping coldness in  his blood is nothing more than a slight discomfort, and is scarcely  felt. By and by he is overcome by drowsiness, and ceases to struggle;  the torturing visions fade from his mind, and his only thought is to lie  down and sleep. And when he sleeps he passes away; very easily, very  painlessly, for the pain was of the mind, and was over long before death  ensued.    The bird, however hard the frost may be, flies briskly to its customary  roosting-place, and with beak tucked into its wing, falls asleep. It has  no apprehensions; only the hot blood grows colder and colder, the pulse  feebler as it sleeps, and at midnight, or in the early morning, it drops  from its perch--dead.    Yesterday he lived and moved, responsible to a thousand external  influences, reflecting earth and sky in his small brilliant brain as in  a looking-glass; also he had a various language, the inherited knowledge  of his race, and the faculty of flight, by means of which he could  shoot, meteor-like, across the sky, and pass swiftly from place to  place, and with it such perfect control over all his organs, such  marvellous certitude in all his motions, as to be able to drop himself  plumb down from the tallest tree-top or out of the void air, on to a  slender spray, and scarcely cause its leaves to tremble. Now, on this  morning, he lies stiff and motionless; if you were to take him up and  drop him from your hand, he would fall to the ground like a stone or a  lump of clay--so easy and swift is the passage from life to death in  wild nature! But he was never miserable.    Those of my readers who have seen much of animals in a state of nature,  will agree that death from decay, or old age, is very rare among them.  In that state the fullest vigour, with brightness of all the faculties,  is so important that probably in ninety-nine cases in a hundred any  falling-off in strength, or decay of any sense, results in some fatal  accident. Death by misadventure, as we call it, is Nature's ordinance,  the end designed for a very large majority of her children.  Nevertheless, animals do sometimes live on without accident to the very  end of their term, to fade peacefully away at the last. I have myself  witnessed such cases in mammals and birds; and one such case, which  profoundly impressed me, and is vividly remembered, I will describe.    One morning in the late summer, while walking in the fields at my home  in South America, I noticed a few purple martins, large, beautiful  swallows common in that region, engaged, at a considerable height, in  the aerial exercises in which they pass so much of their time each day.  By and by, one of the birds separated itself from the others, and,  circling slowly downward, finally alighted on the ground not far from  me. I walked on: but the action of the bird had struck me as unusual and  strange, and before going far, I turned and walked back to the spot  where it continued sitting on the ground, quite motionless. It made no  movement when I approached to within four yards of it; and after I had  stood still at that distance for a minute or so, attentively regarding  it, I saw it put out one wing and turn over on its side. I at once took  it up in my hand, and found that it was already quite dead. It was a  large example of its species, and its size, together with a something of  dimness in the glossy purple colour of the upper plumage, seemed to show  that it was an old bird. But it was uninjured, and when I dissected it  no trace of disease was discernible. I concluded that it was an old bird  that had died solely from natural failure of the life-energy.    But how wonderful, how almost incredible, that the healthy vigour and  joy of life should have continued in this individual bird down to within  so short a period of the end; that it should have been not only strong  enough to find its food, but to rush and wheel about for long intervals  in purely sportive exercises, when the brief twilight of decline and  final extinction were so near! It becomes credible--we can even believe  that most of the individuals that cease to exist only when the vital  fire has burnt itself out, fall on death in this swift, easy  manner--when we recall the fact that even in the life-history of men  such a thing is not unknown. Probably there is not one among my readers  who will not be able to recall some such incident in his own circle--the  case of someone who lived, perhaps, long past the term usually allotted  to man, and who finally passed away without a struggle, without a pang,  so that those who were with him found it hard to believe that the spirit  had indeed gone. In such cases, the subject has invariably been healthy,  although it is hard to believe that, in the conditions we exist in, any  man can have the perfect health that all wild creatures enjoy.          X      After my long talk with the bird-catcher on June 24, and two more talks  equally long on the two following days, I found that something of the  charm the common had had for me was gone. It was not quite the same as  formerly; even the sunshine had a something of conscious sadness in it  which was like a shadow. Those merry little brown twitterers that  frequently shot across the sky, looking small as insects in the wide  blue expanse, and ever and anon dropped swiftly down like showers of  aerolites, to lose themselves in the grass and herbage, or perch singing  on the topmost dead twigs of a bush, now existed in constant imminent  danger--not of that quick merciful destruction which Nature has for her  weaklings, and for all that fail to reach her high standard; but of a  worse fate, the prison life which is not Nature's ordinance, but one of  the cunning larger Ape's abhorred inventions. Instead of taking my usual  long strolls about the common I loitered once more in the village lanes  and had my reward.    On the morning of June 27 I was out sauntering very indolently, thinking  of nothing at all; for it was a surpassingly brilliant day, and the  sunshine produced the effect of a warm, lucent, buoyant fluid, in which  I seemed to float rather than walk--a celestial water, which, like the  more ponderable and common sort, may sometimes be both felt and seen.  The sensation of feeling it is somewhat similar to that experienced by a  bather standing breast-deep in a dear, green, warm tropical sea, so  charged with salt that it lifts him up; but to distinguish it with the  eye, you must look away to a distance of some yards in an open unshaded  place, when it will become visible as fine glinting lines, quivering and  serpentining upwards, fountain-wise, from the surface. All at once I was  startled by hearing the loud importunate hunger-call of a young cuckoo  quite close to me. Moving softly up to the low hedge and peering over, I  saw the bird perched on a long cross-stick, which had been put up in a  cottage garden to hang clothes on; he was not more than three to four  yards from me, a fine young cuckoo in perfect plumage, his barred  under-surface facing me. Although seeing me as plainly as I saw him, he  exhibited no fear, and did not stir. Why should he, since I had not come  there to feed him, and, to his inexperienced avian mind, was only one of  the huge terrestrial creatures of various forms, with horns and manes on  their heads, that move heavily about in roads and pastures, and are  nothing to birds? But his foster parent, a hedge-sparrow, was  suspicious, and kept at some distance with food in her bill; then  excited by his imperative note, she flitted shyly to him, and deposited  a minute caterpillar in his great gaping yellow mouth. It was like  dropping a bun into the monstrous mouth of the hippopotamus of the  Zoological Gardens. But the hedge-sparrow was off and back again with a  second morsel in a very few moments; and again and again she darted away  in quest of food and returned successful, while the lazy, beautiful  giant sat sunning himself on his cross-stick and hungrily cried for  more.    This is one of those exceptional sights in nature which, however often  seen, never become altogether familiar, never fail to re-excite the old  feelings of wonder and admiration which were experienced on first  witnessing them. I can safely say, I think, that no man has observed so  many parasitical young birds (individuals) being fed by their  foster-parents as myself, yet the interest such a sight inspired in me  is just as fresh now as in boyhood.  And probably in no parasitical  species does the strangeness of the spectacle strike the mind so sharply  as in this British bird, since the differences in size and colouring  between the foster-parent and its false offspring are so much greater in  its case. Here nature's unnaturalness in such an instinct--a close union  of the beautiful and the monstrous--is seen in its extreme form. The  hawk-like figure and markings of the cuckoo serve only to accentuate the  disparity, which is perhaps greatest when the parent is the  hedge-sparrow--so plainly-coloured a bird, so shy and secretive in its  habits. One never ceases to be amazed at the blindness of the parental  instinct in so intelligent a creature as a bird in a case of this kind.  Some idea of how blind it is may be formed by imagining a case in widely  separated types of our own species, which would be a parallel to that of  the cuckoo and hedge-sparrow. Let us imagine that some malicious Arabian  Night's genius had snatched up the infant male child of a Scandinavian  couple--the largest of their nation; and flying away to Africa with it,  to the heart of the great Aruwhimi forest had laid it on the breast of a  little coffee-coloured, woolly-headed, spindle-shanked, pot-bellied,  pigmy mother, taking away at the same time her own newly-born babe; that  she had tenderly nursed the substituted child, and reared and protected  it, ministering, according to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7401"],[0,"A Crystal Age (#17)"],[1,"your waist to pull you back when you try to  rush off in that mad fashion. You have knocked all the wind out of me;  and yet I was in pretty good trim.\"    She laughed, and jumping to the ground, sat down at my side on the  grass.    I caught her hand and held it tight. \"Now you shall not escape and run  away again,\" said I.    \"You may keep my hand,\" she replied; \"it has nothing to do up here.\"    \"May I put it to some useful purpose--may I do what I like with it?\"    \"Yes, you may,\" then she added with a smile: \"There is no thorn in it  now.\"    I kissed it many times on the back, the palm, the wrist then bestowed a  separate caress on each finger-tip.    \"Why do you kiss my hand?\" she asked.    \"Do you not know--can you not guess? Because it is the sweetest thing I  can kiss, except one other thing. Shall I tell you----\"    \"My face? And why do you not kiss that?\"    \"Oh, may I?\" said I, and drawing her to me I kissed her soft cheek. \"May  I kiss the other cheek now?\" I asked. She turned it to me, and when I  had kissed it rapturously, I gazed into her eyes, which looked back,  bright and unabashed, into mine. \"I think--I think I made a slight  mistake, Yoletta,\" I said. \"What I meant to ask was, will you let me  kiss you where I like--on your chin, for instance, or just where I  like?\"    \"Yes; but you are keeping me too long. Kiss me as many times as you  like, and then let us admire the prospect.\"    I drew her closer and kissed her mouth, not once nor twice, but clinging  to it with all the ardor of passion, as if my lips had become glued to  hers.    Suddenly she disengaged herself from me. \"Why do you kiss my mouth in  that violent way?\" she exclaimed, her eyes sparkling, her cheeks  flushed. \"You seem like some hungry animal that wanted to devour me.\"    That was, oddly enough, just how I felt. \"Do you not not know, sweetest,  why I kiss you in that way? Because I love you.\"    \"I know you do, Smith. I can understand and appreciate your love without  having my lips bruised.\"    \"And do you love me, Yoletta?\"    \"Yes, certainly--did you not know that?\"    \"And is it not sweet to kiss when you love? Do you know what love is,  darling? Do you love me a thousand times more than any one else in the  world?\"    \"How extravagantly you talk!\" she replied. \"What strange things you  say!\"    \"Yes, dear, because love is strange--the strangest, sweetest thing in  life. It comes once only to the heart, and the one person loved is  infinitely more than all others. Do you not understand that?\"    \"Oh no; what do you mean, Smith?\"    \"Is there any other person dearer to your heart than I am?\"    \"I love every one in the house, some more than others. Those that are  closely related to me I love most.\"    \"Oh, please say no more! You love your people with one kind of love, but  me with a different love--is it not so?\"    \"There is only one kind of love,\" said she.    \"Ah, you say that because you are a child yet, and do not know. You are  even younger than I thought, perhaps. How old are you, dear?\"    \"Thirty-one years old,\" she replied, with the utmost gravity.    \"Oh, Yoletta, what an awful cram! I mean--oh, I beg your pardon for  being so rude! But--but don't you think you can draw it mild?  Thirty-one--what a joke! Why, I'm an old fellow compared with you, and  I'm not twenty-two yet. Do tell me what you mean, Yoletta?\"    She was not listening to me, I saw: she had risen from the grass and  seated herself again on the stone. For only answer to my question she  pointed to the west with her hand, saying: \"Look there, Smith.\"    I stood up and looked. The sun was near the horizon now, and partially  concealed by low clouds, which were beginning to form--gray, and tinged  with purple and red; but their misty edges burned with an intense yellow  flame. Above, the sky was clear as blue glass, barred with pale-yellow  rays, shot forth by the sinking sun, and resembling the spokes of an  immense celestial wheel reaching to the zenith. The billowy earth, with  its forests in deep green and many-colored, autumnal foliage, stretched  far before us, here in shadow, and there flushed with rich light; while  the mountain range, looming near and stupendous on our right, had  changed its color from dark blue to violet.    The doubts and fears agitating my heart made me indifferent to the  surpassing beauty of the scene: I turned impatiently from it to gaze  again on her graceful figure, girlish still in its slim proportions; but  her face, flushed with sunlight, and crowned with its dark, shining  hair, seemed to me like the face of one of the immortals. The expression  of rapt devotion on it made me silent, for it seemed as if she too had  been touched by nature's magic, like earth and sky, and been  transfigured; and waiting for the mood to pass, I stood by her side,  resting my hand on her knee. By-and-by she looked down and smiled, and  then I returned to the subject of her age.    \"Surely, Yoletta,\" said I, \"you were only poking fun at me--I mean,  amusing yourself at my expense. You can't possibly be more than about  fifteen, or sixteen at the very outside.\"    She smiled again and shook her head.    \"Oh, I know, I can solve the riddle now. Your years are different, of  course, like everything else in this latitude. A month is called a year  with you, and that would make you, let me see--how much is twelve times  thirty-one? Oh, hang it, nearly five hundred, I should think. Why am I  such a duffer at mental arithmetic! It is just the contrary--how many  twelves in thirty-one? About two and a half in round numbers, and that's  absurd, as you are not a baby. Oh, I have it: your seasons are called  years, of course--why didn't I see it before! No, that would make you  only seven and a half. Ah, yes, I see it now: a year means two years, or  two of your years--summer and winter--mean a year; and that just makes  you sixteen, exactly what I had imagined. Is it not so, Yoletta?\"    \"I do not know what you are talking about, Smith; and I am not  listening.\"    \"Well, listen for one moment, and tell me how long does a year last?\"    \"It lasts from the time the leaves fall in the autumn until they fall  again; and it lasts from the time the swallows come in spring until they  come again.\"    \"And seriously, honestly, you are thirty-one years old?\"    \"Did I not tell you so? Yes, I am thirty-one years old.\"    \"Well, I never heard anything to equal this! Good heavens, what does it  mean? I know it is awfully rude to inquire a lady's age, but what am I  to do? Will you kindly tell me Edra's age?\"    \"Edra? I forget. Oh yes; she is sixty-three.\"    \"Sixty-three! I'll be shot if she's a day more than twenty-eight! Idiot  that I am, why can't I keep calm! But, Yoletta, how you distress me! It  almost frightens me to ask another question, but do tell me how old your  father is?\"    \"He is nearly two hundred years old--a hundred and ninety-eight, I  think,\" she replied.    \"Heavens on earth--I shall go stark, staring mad!\" But I could say no  more; leaving her side I sat down on a low stone at some distance, with  a stunned feeling in my brain, and something like despair in my heart.  That she had told me the truth I could no longer doubt for one moment:  it was impossible for her crystal nature to be anything but truthful.  The number of her years mattered nothing to me; the virgin sweetness of  girlhood was on her lips, the freshness and glory of early youth on her  forehead; the misery was that she had lived thirty-one years in the  world and did not understand the words I had spoken to her--did not know  what love, or passion, was! Would it always be so--would my heart  consume itself to ashes, and kindle no fire in hers?    Then, as I sat there, filled with these despairing thoughts, she came  down from her perch, and, dropping on her knees before me, put her arms  about my neck and gazed steadily into my face. \"Why are you troubled,  Smith-have I said anything to hurt you?\" said she. \"And do you not know  that you have offended me?\"    \"Have I? Tell me how, dearest Yoletta.\"    \"By asking questions, and saying wild, meaningless things while I sat  there watching the setting sun. It troubled me and spoiled my pleasure;  but I will forgive you, Smith, because I love you. Do you not think I  love you enough? You are very dear to me--dearer every day.\" And drawing  down my face she kissed my lips.    \"Darling, you make me happy again,\" I returned, \"for if your love  increases every day, the time will perhaps come when you will understand  me, and be all I wish to me.\"    \"What is it that you wish?\" she questioned.    \"That you should be mine--mine alone, wholly mine--and give yourself to  me, body and soul.\"    She continued gazing up into my eyes. \"In a sense we do, I suppose, give  ourselves, body and soul, to those we love,\" she said. \"And if you are  not yet satisfied that I have given myself to you in that way, you must  wait patiently, saying and doing nothing willfully to alienate my heart,  until the time arrives when my love will be equal to your desire. Come,\"  she added, and, rising, pulled me up by the hand.    Silently, and somewhat pensively, we started hand in hand on our walk  down the hill. Presently she dropped on her knees, and opening the grass  with her hands, displayed a small, slender bud, on a round, smooth stem,  springing without leaves from the soil. \"Do you see!\" she said, looking  up at me with a bright smile.    \"Yes, dear, I see a bud; but I do not know anything more about it.\"    \"Oh, Smith, do you not know that it is a rainbow lily!\" And rising, she  took my hand and walked on again.    \"What is the rainbow lily?\"    \"By-and-by, in a few days, it will be in fullest bloom, and the earth  will be covered with its glory.\"    \"It is so late in the season, Yoletta! Spring is the time to see the  earth covered with the glory of flowers.\"    \"There is nothing to equal the rainbow lily, which comes when"]]]
