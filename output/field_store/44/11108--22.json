Then Sir Morgadour bethought him of another wile. The Soudan had sworn  to kill every Christian found in his camp, without regard to flag of  truce or ambassage. So Sir Morgadour persuaded Ernis to send Sir Guy to  the Soudan saying, that, since the war seemed likely to come to no  speedy issue, it should be settled by single combat between two  champions chosen from the Christian and the Saracen hosts. The counsel  seemed good to Ernis, but yet he liked not to risk his son-in-law's  life; wherefore he called his Parliament together and asked for some  bold knight to go and bear this message. When all the others held their  peace, Sir Guy demanded to be sent upon the business, neither could the  prayers and entreaties of Ernis cause him to forego the enterprise. He  clad himself in iron hose and a trusty hauberk, set a helm of steel,  gold-circled, on his head, and having girt his sword about him, leapt on  his steed without so much as touching stirrup, and rode up to the  Soudan's pavilion. He well knew it from the rest, since on the top  thereof flashed a great carbuncle stone.    There were feasting the Soudan, ten kings, and many barons, when Sir Guy  walked into the pavilion and delivered his message with great roughness  of speech. \"Seize him and slay him!\" cried the Soudan. But Sir Guy cut  his way through his assailants and rushing on the Soudan cut off his  head; and while he stooped to pick up the trophy with his left hand,  with his right he slew six Saracens, then fought his passage past them  all to the tent door, and leapt upon his horse. But the whole Saracen  host being roused he never would have got back for all his bravery, but  that Heraud within the city saw in a dream the danger he was in, and  assembling the Greek army and Sir Guy's knights, came to his rescue and  put the Saracens to flight. Then after the battle, Sir Guy came in  triumph to Constantinople and laid the Soudan's head at the feet of the  Emperor Ernis.    Ernis now, being at peace from his enemies, would take Sir Guy through  his realms. On their way they saw a dragon fighting a lion, and the lion  having much the worst of the combat, Sir Guy must needs go and fight the  dragon. After a hard battle he laid the monster dead at his feet, and  the lion came and licked the hands of his deliverer, and would in no  wise depart from his side.    Soon afterward the Emperor Ernis gathered a great company of princes,  dukes, earls, barons, bishops, abbots, and priors to the wedding feast,  and in presence of them all he gave Sir Guy to be ruler over half the  kingdom, and led forth the Princess Loret to be his bride.    But when Sir Guy saw the wedding-ring, his old love came to his mind,  and he bethought him of Felice. \"Alas!\" he cried, \"Felice the bright and  beautiful, my heart misgives me of forgetting thee. None other maid  shall ever have my love.\" Then he fell into a swoon and when he came to  himself he pleaded sudden sickness. So the marriage was put off, to the  great distress of Ernis and his daughter Loret, and Sir Guy gat him to  an Inn. Heraud tended him there, and learned how it was for the sake of  Felice that Guy renounced so fair a bride, dowered with so rich a  kingdom. But after a fortnight, when he could no longer feign illness  because of the watchfullness of the Emperor and the Princess after his  health, he was forced to return to court, and delay his marriage from  day to day by one excuse and another, until at length fortune delivered  him from the strait. The lion which Sir Guy had tamed was used to roam  about the palace, and grew so gentle that none feared him and none  sought him harm. But Sir Morgadour, being sore vexed to think that all  his plans against Sir Guy had failed, determined to wreak his spite upon  the lion. He therefore watched until he found the lion asleep within an  arbour, and then wounded him to death with his sword. The faithful beast  dragged himself so far as Sir Guy's chamber, licked his master's hands,  and fell dead at his feet. But a little maid which had espied Sir  Morgadour told Sir Guy who had slain his lion. Then Sir Guy went forth  in quest of Sir Morgadour, and fought with him and slew him. He had  forgiven the wrongs against himself, since he outwitted them; but he was  fain to avenge his faithful favourite. Now Sir Morgadour was steward to  the German Emperor Regnier. So Sir Guy showed Ernis that if he remained  longer at his court, Regnier would surely make war on Greece to avenge  his steward's death. Wherefore with this excuse he took his departure  and set sail with Heraud in the first ship he could find. They landed in  Germany, and visited the Emperor Regnier without telling anything about  his steward's death. Then they came to Lorraine.    As Sir Guy took his way alone through a forest, having sent his servants  on to prepare a place for him at an inn, he heard the groaning of a man  in pain, and turning his horse that way, found a knight sore wounded,  and like to die. This knight was named Sir Thierry, and served the Duke  of Lorraine. He told how he was riding through the wood with his lady,  Osile, when fifteen armed men beset him, and forcibly carried off the  lady to take her to Duke Otho of Pavia, his rival Then said Sir Guy, \"I  also have a score to settle with Otho, the felon duke.\" Then he took Sir  Thierry's arms and armour, and went in pursuit of the ravishers whom he  soon overtook, and having slain every one, he set the lady on his steed  and returned to the place where he had left the wounded knight. But now  Sir Thierry was gone; for four knights of Duke Otho's band had come and  carried him off. So Sir Guy set down the lady, and started to find the  four knights. Having fought and vanquished them, he set Sir Thierry on  his horse and returned. But now Osile was gone. He searched for many  hours to find her, but in vain. So as nightfall drew on he took Sir  Thierry to the inn. There by good fortune they found the lady, Sir Guy's  servants having met her in the wood and brought her with them to await  his coming. A leech soon came and dressed Sir Thierry's wounds, and by  the careful tending of Osile and Sir Guy, he got well Then Sir Guy and  Sir Thierry swore brotherhood in arms.    Soon there came a messenger, saying that Duke Otho, hotly wroth at  losing the fair Osile, had gone to lay waste the lands of Aubry, Sir  Thierry's father; the Duke of Lorraine was likewise helping him.  Thereupon Sir Guy equipped five hundred knights and came with Sir  Thierry to the city of Gurmoise where Aubry dwelt. It was a well  ramparted city, and after being beaten in two battles with Sir Guy, Duke  Otho found, despite the larger numbers of his host, that he could not  stand against the courage of the little army and the valour of its  leader. Thinking therefore to gain Osile by treachery, he sent an  archbishop to Aubry, offering peace and pledging himself to confirm the  marriage of Sir Thierry and Osile, provided only that the lovers would  go and kneel in homage to their sovereign Duke of Lorraine. Thereon Sir  Thierry and his bride, together with Sir Guy and Sir Heraud, set out  unarmed, and after wending a day's journey out of Gurmoise, they met the  Duke of Lorraine, who embraced and kissed them in token of peace. But  Otho coming forward as if to do the like, made a sign to a band of men  whom he had in waiting to seize them. These quickly surrounded Sir  Heraud and Sir Thierry and carried them off; but Sir Guy with only his  fists slew many of his assailants, and broke away to where a countryman  stood with a staff in his hand. Snatching this for a weapon, Sir Guy  beat down the quickest of his pursuers, and made his escape. Duke Otho  cast Sir Thierry into a deep dungeon in Pavia, and meanwhile gave Osile  a respite of forty days wherein to consent to be his bride. But the Duke  of Lorraine carried off Sir Heraud.    Weary and hungered, and vexed at the loss of his friends, Sir Guy came  to a castle where he sought harbour for the night. Sir Amys of the  Mountain, who dwelt there, welcomed him with a good will, and hearing  his adventures, offered to raise an army of fifteen hundred men to help  him against Duke Otho. But to this Sir Guy said nay, because it would  take too long. So, after a day or two, having hit upon a plan, he  disguised, himself by staining his face and darkening his hair and beard  and eyebrows; and setting out alone, came to Duke Otho with a present of  a war-horse of great price, and said, \"You have in your keeping a  dastard knight by name Sir Thierry, who has done me much despite, and I  would fain be avenged upon him.\" Then Duke Otho, falling into the trap,  appointed him jailor of Sir Thierry.    The dungeon wherein Sir Thierry was prisoned was a pit of forty fathoms  deep, and very soon Sir Guy spake from the pit's mouth bidding him be of  good cheer, for he would certainly deliver him. But a false Lombard  overheard these words, and thereby knowing that it was Sir Guy, ran off  straightway to tell Duke Otho. Sir Guy followed quickly and sought to  bribe the man with money to hold his peace, but without avail, for he  would go into the palace where the Duke was, and opened his mouth to  tell the tale. Then with one blow Sir Guy slew him at Duke Otho's feet.  But Otho, very wroth, would have killed Sir Guy then and there, only  that he averred that this was a certain traitor whom he found carrying  food to the prisoner. Thus having appeased the Duke's anger, he gat away  secretly to Osile, and bade her change her manner to Duke Otho, and make  as though she was willing to have his love. The night before the day  fixed for the wedding, Sir Guy let down a rope to Thierry in his pit,  and having drawn him up, the two made all speed to the castle of Sir  Amys. There, getting equipped with arms and armour, they leaped to horse  on the morrow, and riding back to Pavia, met "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6628"],[0,"The Life, Crime, and Capture of John Wilkes Booth (#17)"],[1,"of some burglar's crib,  talking robbery between their cups; its dining-room is dark and  tumble-down, and the _cuisine_ bears traces of Caffir origin; a barbecue  is nothing to a dinner there. The Court House of Port Tobacco is the  most superflous house in the place, except the church. It stands in the  center of the town in a square, and the dwellings lie about it closely,  as if to throttle justice. Five hundred people exist in Port Tobacco;  life there reminds me, in connection with the slimy river and the  adjacent swamps, of the great reptile period of the world, when  iguanadons and pterodactyls and pleosauri ate each other.    Into this abstract of Gomorrah the few detectives went like angels who  visited Lot. They pretended to be enquiring for friends, or to have  business designs, and the first people they heard of were Harold and  Atzerott. The latter had visited Port Tobacco three weeks before the  murder, and intimated at that time his design of fleeing the country.  But everybody denied having seen him subsequent to the crime.    Atzerott had been in town just prior to the crime. He had been living  with a widow woman named Mrs. Wheeler, by whom he had several children,  and she was immediately called upon by Major O'Bierne. He did not tell  her what Atzerott had done, but vaguely hinted that he had committed  some terrible crime, and that since he had done her wrong, she could  vindicate both herself and justice by telling his whereabouts. The woman  admitted that Atzerott had been her bane, but she loved him, and refused  to betray him.    His trunk was found in her garret, and in it the key to his paint shop  in Port Tobacco. The latter was fruitlessly searched, but the probable  whereabouts of Atzerott in Mongomery county obtained, and Major O'Bierne  telegraphing there immediately, the desperate fellow was found and  locked up. A man named Crangle who had succeeded Atzerott in Mrs.  Wheeler's pliable affections, was arrested at once and put in jail. A  number of disloyal people were indicated or \"spotted\" as in no wise  angry at the President's taking off, and for all such a provost prison  was established.    [Illustration: Maryland.]    A few miles from Port Tobacco dwelt a solitary woman, who, when  questioned, said that for many nights she had heard, after she had  retired to bed, a man enter her cellar and lie there all night,  departing before dawn. Major O'Bierne and the detectives ordered her to  place a lamp in her window the next night she heard him enter, and at  dark they established a cordon of armed officers around the place. At  midnight punctually she exhibited the light, when the officers broke  into the house and thoroughly searched it, without result. Yet the woman  positively asserted that she had heard the man enter.    It was afterward found that she was of diseased mind.    By this time the military had come up in considerable numbers, and Major  O'Bierne was enabled to confer with Major Wait, of the Eighth Illinois.    The major had pushed on Monday night to Leonardstown, and pretty well  overhauled that locality.    It was at this time that preparations were made to hunt the swamps  around Chapmantown, Beantown, and Allen's Fresh. Booth had been entirely  lost since his departure from Mudd's house, and it was believed that he  had either pushed on for the Potomac or taken to the swamps. The  officers sagaciously determined to follow him to the one and to explore  the other.    The swamps tributary to the various branches of the Wicomico river, of  which the chief feeder is Allen's creek, bear various names, such as  Jordan's swamp, Atchall's swamp, and Scrub swamp. There are dense  growths of dogwood, gum, and beech, planted in sluices of water and bog;  and their width varies from a half mile to four miles, while their  length is upwards of sixteen miles. Frequent deep ponds dot this  wilderness place, with here and there a stretch of dry soil, but no  human being inhabits the malarious extent; even a hunted murderer would  shrink from hiding there. Serpents and slimy lizards are the only  denizens; sometimes the coon takes refuge in this desert from the  hounds, and in the soil mud a thousand odorous muskrats delve, with now  and then a tremorous otter. But not even the hunted negro dares to  fathom the treacherous clay, nor make himself a fellow of the slimy  reptiles which reign absolute in this terrible solitude. Here the  soldiers prepared to seek for the President's assassin, and no search of  the kind has ever been so thorough and patient. The Shawnee, in his  strong hold of despair in the heart of Okeefeuokee, would scarcely have  changed homes with Wilkes Booth and David Harold, hiding in this inhuman  country.    The military forces deputed to pursue the fugitives were seven hundred  men of the Eighth Illinois cavalry, six hundred men of the Twenty-second  Colored troops, and one hundred men of the Sixteenth New York. These  swept the swamps by detachments, the mass of them dismounted, with  cavalry at the belts of clearing, interspersed with detectives at  frequent intervals in the rear. They first formed a strong picket cordon  entirely around the swamps, and then, drawn up in two orders of battle,  advanced boldly into the bogs by two lines of march. One party swept the  swamps longitudinally, the other pushed straight across their smallest  diameter.    A similar march has not been made during the war; the soldiers were only  a few paces apart, and in steady order they took the ground as it came,  now plunging to their arm-pits in foul sluices of gangrened water, now  hopelessly submerged in slime, now attacked by Regions of wood ticks,  now tempting some unfaithful log or greenishly solid morass, and  plunging to the tip of the skull in poison stagnation; the tree boughs  rent their uniforms; they came out upon dry land, many of them without a  rag of garment scratched, and gashed, and spent, repugnant to  themselves, and disgusting to those who saw them; but not one trace of  Booth or Harold was any where found. Wherever they might be, the swamps  did not contain them.    While all this was going on, a force started from Point Lookout, and  swept the narrow necks of Saint Mary's quite up to Medley's Neck. To  complete the search in this part of the country, Colonel Wells and Major  O'Bierne started with a force of cavalry and infantry for Chappel Point;  they took the entire peninsula as before, and marched in close skirmish  line across it, but without finding anything of note. The matter of  inclosing a house was by cavalry advances, which held all the avenues  till mounted detectives came up. Many strange and ludicrous adventures  occured on each of these expeditions. While the forces were going up  Cobb's neck, there was a counter force coming down from Allen's Fresh.    Major O'Bierne started for Leonardstown with his detective force, and  played off Laverty as Booth, and Hoey as Harold. These two advanced to  farm-houses and gave their assumed names, asking at the same time for  assistance and shelter. They were generally avoided, except by one man  named Claggert, who told them they might hide in the woods behind his  house. When Claggert was arrested, however he stated that he meant to  hide them only to give them up. While on this adventure, a man who had  heard of the reward came very near shooting Laverty. The ruse now became  hazardous and the detectives resumed their real characters.    I have not time to go into the detail of this long and excellent hunt.  My letter of yesterday described how the detectives of Mr. Young and  Marshal Murray examined the negro Swan, and traced Booth to the house of  Sam Coxe, the richest rebel in Charles county. There is a gap in the  evidence between the arrival of Booth at this place and his crossing the  Potomac above Swan Point, in a stolen or purposely-provided canoe. But  as Coxe's house is only ten miles from the river, it is possible that he  made the passage of the intermediate country undiscovered.    One Mills, a rebel mail-carrier, also arrested, saw Booth and Harold  lurking along the river bank on Friday; he referred Major O'Bierne to  one Claggert, a rebel, as having seen them also; but Claggert held his  tongue, and went to jail. On Saturday night, Major O'Bierne, thus  assured, also crossed the Potomac with his detectives to Boon's farm,  where the fugitives had landed. While collecting information here a  gunboat swung up the stream, and threatened to fire on the party.    It was now night, and all the party worn to the ground with long travel  and want of sleep. Lieutenant Laverty's men went a short distance down  the country and gave up, but Major O'Bierne, with a single man, pushed  all night to King George's court-house, and next day, Sunday,  re-embarked for Chappell's Point. Hence he telegraphed his information,  and asked permission to pursue, promising to catch the assassins before  they reached Port Royal.    This the department refused. Colonel Baker's men were delegated to make  the pursuit with the able Lieutenant Doherty, and. O'Bierne, who was the  most active and successful spirit in the chase, returned to Washington,  cheerful and contented.    At Mrs. Burratt's Washington house, at the Pennsylvania Hotel,  Washington, and at Surrattsville, the Booth plot was almost entirely  arranged. These three places will be relics of conspiracy forever.    Harold said to Lieutenant Doherty, after the latter had dragged him from  the barn.    \"Who's that man in there? It can't be Booth; he told me his name was  Loyd.\"    He further said that he had begged food for Booth from house to house  while the latter hid in the woods.    The confederate captain, Willie Jett, who had given Booth a lift behind  his saddle from Port Royal to Garrett's farm, was then courting a Miss  Goldmann at Bowling Green; his traveling companions were Lieutenants  Ruggles and Burbridge.
