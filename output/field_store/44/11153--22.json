And Gwen says the same. Oh, here  she is! I was looking for you, Gwen! Here are the Ramsays, and Talland.\"    The Gwen who advanced to shake hands was so different from their old  acquaintance that the girls felt they scarcely would have recognised her.  She did her hair in a new fashion, and was wonderfully grown-up, and even  more patronising than formerly. She said a languid \"How d'you do,\" then  left Babbie to entertain them, which the latter did with enthusiasm, for  she was fond of Mavis and Merle.    \"I expect you're thinking of all the improvements you'll make here when  you come of age?\" said Mrs. Glyn Williams, trying to be pleasant to Bevis  over the tea-cups. \"It's a nice place, and will really look very well  when it's been redecorated. You'll have to do it up for your bride, won't  you?\"    At which joke Bevis blushed crimson and dropped his cake on the carpet,  to his own confusion and the delight of the fox-terrier Jim, who thought  it was done for his especial benefit, and promptly swallowed the piece,  icing and all.    \"I don't want to hurry you to turn out,\" protested Bevis shyly.    \"Oh, we shall have Bodoran Hall ready by that time. We were there last  week looking at the new building. The workmen are really beginning to get  on with it at last.\"    \"You'll have to build fresh stables here, Talland, if you mean to do any  decent hunting,\" advised Tudor airily. \"If I were you I'd get those  lawyers to start them at once, then they'd be ready when you want them. I  suppose you _will_ hunt?\"    \"I'm not sure yet what I mean to do,\" replied Bevis guardedly.    He did not like so much catechism about his future plans. In the old days  of his poverty he had never admired the Glyn Williams' ideals of life,  and he had no wish to mould himself upon their standards. The sporting  landlord, with a horizon bounded by the local meet or a county ball, was  a type that did not appeal to him, and he saw no reason why he should be  forced by a spurious public opinion into lines that were uncongenial.  Though on the surface he and Tudor were friends, at bottom the old  antagonism existed as in the days when they had quarrelled on the cliffs  near Blackthorn Bower.    It was only to please Mavis and Merle that he had accepted this  invitation to The Warren, where he found himself in the peculiar position  of being patronised in his own house.    With Bevis rather gloomy and restrained, Tudor slightly aggressive, and  Gwen too fashionable to trouble to entertain her old friends, matters  were not as exhilarating as they might have been, and everybody seemed  relieved when it was time to walk down to the Institute.    \"I suppose I shall have to go!\" yawned Gwen. \"These village concerts of  Mother's are _such_ a nuisance! Why can't the people get up their  own instead of always expecting her to bother with them! _I_ don't  want to hear Miss Smith and Miss Brown and Miss Robinson! It bores me  stiff.\"    \"Not very polite of her when _we_ are going to act!\" whispered  Merle to Mavis as they put on their hats.    \"It certainly isn't! But Gwen's always like this. I vote we try not to  mind,\" returned Mavis heroically.    The entertainment was to be given in the local Institute, which was  fitted with a platform and curtain, but otherwise held no great  facilities for theatricals. A large and very unruly crowd of young people  were outside waiting for admission, and through these our party had to  push their way to a side entrance. At the back of the platform great  confusion raged. The whole of the Castleton family seemed to be trying to  dress one another among a rich jumble of costumes, while Mr. Castleton,  altering the poses in his tableaux at the eleventh hour, kept sending  messengers home to his studio for articles which he had forgotten.    \"The pantry's the only place for the Ladies' Dressing-Room, and it's full  of tea-cups!\" said Beata, kneeling on the floor to button Lilith into a  mediaeval robe that reached to her toes.    \"Tea-cups or no tea-cups, I'll have to use it!\" said Merle. \"Come with  us, Romola, and mount guard over the door while we change. I'm not going  to have all the parish popping in. How sublime you look!\"    \"Very hot and uncomfortable!\" sighed Romola. \"I'd put on the blue costume  and then Dad suddenly altered the whole tableau and made me get into this  instead. Wasn't it tiresome of him? Now he's fussing about and I know we  shall be late! We always are!\"    \"So shall we be if we don't hurry up. Have you got the right bag, Mavis?  Oh, here are some of Bevis's things! I must rush out and give them to him  before we begin.\"    Dressing in a pantry full of tea-cups, by the aid of candles and a hand-  mirror, was not at all an easy performance, but the girls did their best  for one another and were pleased with the result. As soon as they were  ready they went to help Bevis and Clive, who needed much assistance, and  were beginning to suffer from stage-fright.    \"I was a silly owl to let myself in for it!\" groaned the former. \"I  expect I'll forget every word I ought to say and disgrace myself!\"    \"You'll do nothing of the sort!\" declared Merle firmly. \"If you could act  it last night you can act it to-night, so don't be ridiculous. You've  just _got_ to--there!\"    \"All right, Soeurette! Don't get baity! I won't let you down if I can  help it!\"    The audience by this time had been admitted, and had surged into the room  and struggled for seats, slightly restrained by the boy scouts, who were  acting as stewards, and who vigorously turned out the rank and file if  they invaded the reserved benches. The noise was tremendous, everybody  was talking, and rough lads at the back were indulging in whistling and  an occasional cat-call.    \"The tickets have gone well, at any rate,\" said Nan Colville, who was  helping in one of the tableaux. \"It's something to have the room full,  Dad says! But just listen to them! Aren't they rowdy?\"    \"If everybody's ready we really _must_ begin!\" declared the Vicar,  making a hurried visit behind the scenes. \"I don't think they'll wait any  longer.\"    Furious stamping from the audience endorsed his words, so Mr. Castleton,  who had contemplated yet another alteration, was obliged to be content  and allow the curtain to go up. The scene was 'the first meeting of Dante  and Beatrice,' and was a charming presentment of mediaeval Italy.  Constable, robed in pale green velvet with a Florentine cap on his  picturesque curls, made a very glorified representation of the youthful  poet, while Lilith, in the traditional red dress described in the _Vita  Nuova_, looked ethereal enough to inspire a lifelong devotion and  whole volumes of poems.    The rest of the Castleton family, and a few friends, were grouped as  relations and nobles, in some of the richest dresses of the studio, and  made a very brave show, evoking much applause. It was years since the  villagers had seen 'Living Pictures,' and this was superior to anything  of the sort given before. Without the Castletons the entertainment would  have been almost non-existent. They provided the greater half of the  programme. They were so accustomed to posing as models that they took  most graceful positions in the tableaux, and preserved their postures  admirably without moving so much as a finger. They included Babbie in a  scene from _The Vicar of Wakefield_, and she made a dear little  'Sophia' in muslin dress and mob cap, hugely to her mother's  satisfaction.    Morland, who was at home for Christmas, gave two piano solos, and though  his beautiful artistic playing was much above the heads of most of the  audience, there were some who were musical enough to enjoy it. Everybody  appreciated Claudia's songs. Her voice was of a rare quality, and even  the rough lads at the back of the room stopped 'ragging' and listened in  silence. It was very highly trained singing, but held that divine throb  of passion which uses art as the instrument of nature, and united the  correctness of a musician with the spontaneous carolling of a bird. With  youth and so pretty a face added to her talent it was no wonder that  Claudia had an ovation.    \"I'm not supposed to sing anywhere in public till I've finished with the  college,\" she announced behind the scenes. \"Signor Arezzo would be simply  furious if he knew. He's a terrible Turk about it. I don't see how he's  going to get to hear about it though! I shan't tell him myself, you may  be sure.\"    Fay, who had considerable skill at elocution, gave a most amusing  recitation, to which Morland played a very soft and subdued accompaniment  on the piano, and for the encore that followed she repeated some quaint  poems of American child-life, which were such a success that the Vicar  mentally voted her a discovery, and decided to ask her to help the  programme on future occasions.    It was now the turn of our party from Durracombe, who were trying to keep  up one another's spirits behind the scenes. The audience, owing to long  sitting still, was growing a little obstreperous. The chairman had to  keep constantly ringing a bell and reminding people to be quiet. The  noise at the back waxed so violent that his voice could hardly be heard,  and the occupants of the front seats had to turn round and shout,  'Order!' 'You'll be turned out!' before the delinquents preserved a  decent hush. The little piece evolved by Mavis and Merle was entitled:    _A Rich Relation._    The first scene disclosed Mrs. Hardup, a widow lady, lamenting her lack  of means, and regretting that her son, Augustus, should have engaged  himself to Isabella, a charming but utterly impecunious damsel. She  cheered up, however, when the young people came in bearing a letter; for  it was from Uncle Cashbags, their rich relation, announcing that he was  coming that very day to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7836"],[0,"Jewish History : An Essay in the Philosophy of History (#17)"],[1,"is no fear of their  uniting, they run parallel with each other. The Jewish genius is  versatile. Without hurt to itself it can be active in all sorts of  careers: in politics and in civil life, in parliament and on the  lecture platform, in all branches of science and departments of  literature, in every one of the chambers of mankind's intellectual  laboratory. At the same time it has its domestic hearth, its national  sanctuary; it has its sphere of original work and its self-consciousness,  its national interests and spiritual ideals rooted in the past of the Jew.  By the side of a Lassalle, a Lasker, and a Marx towers a Riesser, a  Geiger, a Graetz. The leveling process unavoidably connected with  widespread culture, so far from causing spiritual desolation in  German Judaism, has, on the contrary, furnished redundant proof  that even under present conditions, so unfavorable to what is  individual and original, the Jewish people has preserved its vitality  to the full.    An analogous movement stirred the other countries of Western  Europe--France, Italy, and England. The political emancipation of the  Jews was accomplished earlier in them than in Germany. The  reconstruction of the inner life, too, proceeded more quietly and  regularly, without leaps and bounds, and religious reform established  itself by degrees. Yet even here, where the Jewish contingent was  insignificant, the spiritual physiognomy of the Jews maintained its  typical character. In these countries, as in Germany, the Jew  assimilated European culture with all its advantages and its  drawbacks. He was active on diplomatic fields, he devoted himself to  economic investigations, he produced intellectual creations of all  kinds--first and last he felt himself to be a citizen of his country.  None the less he was a loyal son of the Jewish people considered as a  spiritual people with an appointed task. Cremieux, Beaconsfield,  Luzzatti are counterbalanced by Salvador, Frank, Munk, Reggio, and  Montefiore. All the good qualities and the shortcomings distinctive of  the civilization of modern times adhere to the Jew. But at its worst  modern civilization has not succeeded in extinguishing the national  spirit in Jewry. The national spirit continues to live in the people,  and it is this spirit that quickens the people. The genius of Jewish  history, as in centuries gone by, holds watch over the sons of the  \"eternal people\" scattered to all ends of the earth. West-European  Jewry may say of itself, without presumption: _Cogito ergo sum_.    Russian Jewry, the Jewry that had been Polish, and that is counted by  the millions, might, if necessary, prove its existence by even more  tangible marks than Occidental Jewry. To begin with, the centre of  gravity of the Jewish nation lies in Russia, whose Jews not only  outnumber those of the rest of Europe, but continue to live in a  compact mass. Besides, they have preserved the original Jewish culture  and their traditional physiognomy to a higher degree than the Jews of  other countries. The development of the Russian Jews took a course  very different from that of the Jews of the West. This difference was  conditioned by the tremendous contrast between Russian culture and  West-European culture, and by the change which the external  circumstances of Jews outside of Russia underwent during the modern  period. The admission of the Polish provinces into the Russian Empire  at the end of the eighteenth century found the numerous Jewish  population in an almost medieval condition, the same condition in  which the non-Jewish population of Russian Poland was at that time.  The Polish regime, as we saw above, had isolated the Jews alike in  civil and spiritual relations. The new order did not break down the  barriers. The masses of Jews cooped up in the \"Pale of Settlement\"  were strong only by reason of their inner unity, their firmly  established patriarchal organization. The bulwark of Rabbinism and the  citadel of Chassidism protected them against alien influences. They  guarded their isolation jealously. True to the law of inertia, they  would not allow the privilege of isolation to be wrested from them.  They did not care to step beyond the ramparts. Why, indeed, should the  Jews have quitted their fortress, if outside of their walls they could  expect nothing but scorn and blows? The unfortunates encaged in the  sinister Pale of Settlement could have been lured out of their  exclusive position only by complete civil emancipation combined with a  higher degree of culture than had been attained by Russian society, an  impossible set of circumstances in the first half of the nineteenth  century. The legislative measures of the time, in so far as they  relate to the Jews, breathe the spirit of police surveillance rather  than of enlightenment and humanity. To civilizing and intellectual  influences from without the way was equally barred. Yet all this  watchfulness was of no avail. Nothing could prevent the liberty  principles espoused by the Jews of Western Europe from being smuggled  into the Pale, to leaven the sad, serried masses. A sluggish process  of fermentation set in, and culminated in the literary activity of  Isaac Beer Levinsohn and of the Wilna reformers of the second and  fourth decades of the nineteenth century. They were the harbingers of  approaching spring.    When spring finally came (after 1855), and the sun sent down his  genial rays upon the wretched Jewry of Russia, life and activity began  to appear at once, especially in the upper strata. As in Germany, so  in Russia spiritual emancipation preceded political emancipation.  Still shorn almost entirely of the elementary rights of citizens, the  Russian Jews nevertheless followed their ideal promptings, and  participated enthusiastically in the movement for enlightenment which  at that time held the noblest of the Russians enthralled. In a  considerable portion of the Russian Jewish community a process of  culture regeneration began, an eager throwing off of outworn forms of  life and thought, a swift adoption of humane principles. Jewish young  men crowded into the secular schools, in which they came in close  contact with their Christian contemporaries. Influenced by their new  companions, they gave themselves up to Russian national movements,  often at the cost of renunciation of self. Some of them, indeed, in  one-sided aspiration strove to become, not Russians, but men. The  influence exercised by literature was more moderate than that of the  schools. Rabbinic and Chassidistic literature, on the point of dying  out as it was, abandoned the field to the literature of enlightenment  in the Hebrew language, a literature of somewhat primitive character.  It consisted chiefly of naive novels and of didactic writings of  publicists, and lacked the solid scientific and historical element  that forms the crown of Western Jewish literature. It is indisputable,  however, that it exerted an educational influence. Besides, it  possesses the merit of having resuscitated one of the most valuable of  Jewish national possessions, the Hebrew language in its purity, which  in Russia alone has become a pliant instrument of literary expression.  A still greater field was reserved for the Jewish-Russian literature  that arose in the \"sixties.\" It was called into being in order to  present a vivid and true picture of the social and spiritual interests  of the Jews. Proceeding from discussions of current political topics,  this literature gradually widened its limits so as to include Jewish  history, Jewish science, and the portrayal of Jewish life, and more  and more approached the character of a normal European literature. All  this was in the making, and the most important work had not yet begun.  The lower strata of the people had not been touched by the fresh air.  In time, if all had gone well, they, too, would have had their day.  And if the minority of the Jewish people in the West in a short span  of time brought forth so many notable workers in so many departments  of life and thought, how much superior would be the culture  achievements of the Eastern majority! How vigorously the mighty mental  forces latent in Russian Jewry would develop when their advance was no  longer obstructed by all sorts of obstacles, and they could be applied  to every sphere of political, social, and intellectual life!    Nothing of all this came to pass; exactly the opposite happened. Not  only were the barriers in the way of a prosperous, free development of  Jewry not removed, but fresh hindrances without number were  multiplied. Some spectre of the middle ages, some power of darkness,  put brakes upon the wheel of history. It first appeared in the West,  under the name anti-Semitism, among the dregs of European society. But  in its earliest abode it was and is still met with an abrupt rebuff on  the part of the most intelligent circles, those whom even the present  age of decadence has not succeeded in robbing of belief in lofty moral  ideals. Anti-Semitism in the West is in _anima vili_. Its cult is  confined to a certain party, which enjoys a rather scandalous  reputation. But there are countries in which this power of darkness,  in the coarser form of Judophobia[13], has cast its baleful spell upon  the most influential members of society and upon the press. There it  has ripened noxious fruit. Mocking at the exalted ideals and the  ethical traditions of religious and thinking mankind, Judophobia  shamelessly professes the dogma of misanthropy. Its propaganda is  bringing about the moral ruin of an immature society, not yet  confirmed in ethical or truly religious principles. Upon its victims,  the Jews, it has the same effect as the misfortunes of the middle  ages, which were meted out to our hoary people with overflowing  measure, and against which it learnt to assume an armor of steel. The  recent severe trials are having the same result as the"]]]
