And I bear far  away the pink and white petals of the apple-blossom's youth when the  laborious time comes for his work in the world and for the bearing  of apples.  And I am robed each day and every night anew with the  beauty of heaven, and I make lovely visions of the trees.  But Man!  What is Man? In the ancient parliament of the elder hills, when the  grey ones speak together, they say nought of Man, but concern  themselves only with their brethren the stars.  Or when they wrap  themselves in purple cloaks at evening, they lament some old  irreparable wrong, or, uttering some mountain hymn, all mourn the  set of sun.'    'Your beauty,' said the road, 'and the beauty of the sky, and of the  rhododendron blossom and of spring, live only in the mind of Man,  and except in the mind of Man the mountains have no voices.  Nothing  is beautiful that has not been seen by Man's eye.  Or if your  rhododendron blossom was beautiful for a moment, it soon withered  and was drowned, and spring soon passes away; beauty can only live  on in the mind of Man.  I bring thought into the mind of Man swiftly  from distant places every day.  I know the Telegraph--I know him  well; he and I have walked for hundreds of miles together.  There is  no work in the world except for Man and the making of his cities.  I  take wares to and fro from city to city.'    'My little stream in the field there,' said the river, 'used to make  wares in that house for awhile once.'    'Ah,' said the road, 'I remember, but I brought cheaper ones from  distant cities.  Nothing is of any importance but making cities for  Man.'    'I know so little about him,' said the river, 'but I have a great  deal of work to do--I have all this water to send down to the sea;  and then tomorrow or next day all the leaves of Autumn will be  coming this way.  It will be very beautiful.  The sea is a very, very  wonderful place.  I know all about it; I have heard shepherd boys  singing of it, and sometimes before a storm the gulls come up.  It is  a place all blue and shining and full of pearls, and has in it coral  islands and isles of spice, and storms and galleons and the bones of  Drake.  The sea is much greater than Man.  When I come to the sea, he  will know that I have worked well for him.  But I must hurry, for I  have much to do.  This bridge delays me a little; some day I will  carry it away.'    'Oh, you must not do that,' said the road.    'Oh, not for a long time,' said the river.  'Some centuries  perhaps--and I have much to do besides.  There is my song to sing, for  instance, and that alone is more beautiful than any noise that Man  makes.'    'All work is for Man,' said the road, 'and for the building of  cities.  There is no beauty or romance or mystery in the sea except  for the men that sail abroad upon it, and for those that stay at  home and dream of them.  As for your song, it rings night and  morning, year in, year out, in the ears of men that are born in  Wrellisford; at night it is part of their dreams, at morning it is  the voice of day, and so it becomes part of their souls.  But the  song is not beautiful in itself.  I take these men with your song in  their souls up over the edge of the valley and a long way off  beyond, and I am a strong and dusty road up there, and they go with  your song in their souls and turn it into music and gladden cities.  But nothing is the Work of the World except work for Man.'    'I wish I was quite sure about the Work of the World,' said the  stream; 'I wish I knew for certain for whom we work.  I feel almost  sure that it is for the sea.  He is very great and beautiful.  I think  that there can be no greater master than the sea.  I think that some  day he may be so full of romance and mystery and sound of sheep  bells and murmur of mist-hidden hills, which we streams shall have  brought him, that there will be no more music or beauty left in the  world, and all the world will end; and perhaps the streams shall  gather at the last, we all together, to the sea.  Or perhaps the sea  will give us at the last unto each one his own again, giving back  all that he has garnered in the years--the little petals of the  apple-blossom and the mourned ones of the rhododendron, and our old  visions of the trees and sky; so many memories have left the hills.  But who may say? For who knows the tides of the sea?'    'Be sure that it is all for Man,' said the road.  'For Man and the  making of cities.'    Something had come near on utterly silent feet.    'Peace, peace!' it said.  'You disturb the queenly night, who, having  come into this valley, is a guest in my dark halls.  Let us have an  end to this discussion.'    It was the spider who spoke.    'The Work of the World is the making of cities and palaces.  But it  is not for Man.  What is Man? He only prepares my cities for me, and  mellows them.  All his works are ugly, his richest tapestries are  coarse and clumsy.  He is a noisy idler.  He only protects me from  mine enemy the wind; and the beautiful work in my cities, the  curving outlines and the delicate weavings, is all mine.  Ten years  to a hundred it takes to build a city, for five or six hundred more  it mellows, and is prepared for me; then I inhabit it, and hide away  all that is ugly, and draw beautiful lines about it to and fro.  There is nothing so beautiful as cities and palaces; they are the  loveliest places in the world, because they are the stillest, and so  most like the stars.  They are noisy at first, for a little, before I  come to them; they have ugly corners not yet rounded off, and coarse  tapestries, and then they become ready for me and my exquisite work,  and are quite silent and beautiful.  And there I entertain the regal  nights when they come there jewelled with stars, and all their train  of silence, and regale them with costly dust.  Already nods, in a  city that I wot of, a lonely sentinel whose lords are dead, who  grows too old and sleepy to drive away the gathering silence that  infests the streets; tomorrow I go to see if he be still at his  post.  For me Babylon was built, and rocky Tyre; and still men build  my cities!  All the Work of the World is the making of cities, and  all of them I inherit.'          The Doom of La Traviata    Evening stole up out of mysterious lands and came down on the  streets of Paris, and the things of the day withdrew themselves and  hid away, and the beautiful city was strangely altered, and with it  the hearts of men.  And with lights and music, and in silence and in  the dark, the other life arose, the life that knows the night, and  dark cats crept from the houses and moved to silent places, and dim  streets became haunted with dusk shapes.  At this hour in a mean  house, near to the Moulin Rouge, La Traviata died; and her death was  brought to her by her own sins, and not by the years of God.  But the  soul of La Traviata drifted blindly about the streets where she had  sinned till it struck against the wall of Notre Dame de Paris.  Thence it rushed upwards, as the sea mist when it beats against a  cliff, and streamed away to Paradise, and was there judged.  And it  seemed to me, as I watched from my place of dreaming, when La  Traviata came and stood before the seat of judgment, that clouds  came rushing up from the far Paradisal hills and gathered together  over the head of God, and became one black cloud; and the clouds  moved swiftly as shadows of the night when a lantern is swung in the  hand, and more and more clouds rushed up, and ever more and more,  and, as they gathered, the cloud a little above the head of God  became no larger, but only grew blacker and blacker.  And the halos  of the saints settled lower upon their heads and narrowed and became  pale, and the singing of the choirs of the seraphim faltered and  sunk low, and the converse of the blessed suddenly ceased.  Then a  stern look came into the face of God, so that the seraphim turned  away and left Him, and the saints.  Then God commanded, and seven  great angels rose up slowly through the clouds that carpet Paradise,  and there was pity on their faces, and their eyes were closed.  Then  God pronounced judgment, and the lights of Paradise went out, and  the azure crystal windows that look towards the world, and the  windows rouge and verd, became dark and colourless, and I saw no  more.  Presently the seven great angels came out by one of Heaven's  gates and set their faces Hellwards, and four of them carried the  young soul of La Traviata, and one of them went on before and one of  them followed behind.  These six trod with mighty strides the long and  dusty road that is named the Way of the Damned.  But the seventh flew  above them all the way, and the light of the fires of Hell that was  hidden from the six by the dust of that dreadful road flared on the  feathers of his breast.    Presently the seven angels, as they swept Hellwards, uttered speech.    'She is very young,' they said; and 'She is very beautiful,' they  said; and they looked long at the soul of La Traviata, looking not  at the stains of sin, but at that portion of her soul wherewith she  had loved her sister a long while dead, who flitted now about an  orchard on one of Heaven's hills with a low sunlight ever on her  face, who communed daily with the saints when they passed that way  going to bless the dead from Heaven's utmost edge.  And as they  looked long at the beauty of all that remained beautiful in her soul  they said: 'It is but a young soul;' and they would have taken her  to one of Heaven's hills, and would there have given her a cymbal  and a dulcimer, but they knew that the Paradisal gates were clamped  and barred against La Traviata.  And they would have taken her to a  valley in the world where there were a great many flowers and a loud  sound of streams, where birds were singing always and church bells  rang on Sabbaths, only this they durst not do.

No faltaban, sin embargo,  algunos que, mas avisados o maliciosos, creyeron sorprender en la  asiduidad del solicito mancebo algunos Senales de mal disimulado amor.    Si en efecto era asi, el oculto carino de Garces tenia mas que sobrada  disculpa en la incomparable hermosura de Constanza. Hubierase  necesitado un pecho de roca y un corazon de hielo para permanecer  impasible un dia y otro al lado de aquella mujer singular por su  belleza y sus raros atractivos.    La Azucena _del Moncayo_[1] llamabanla en veinte leguas a la redonda,  y bien merecia este sobrenombre, porque era tan airosa, tan blanca y  tan rubia que, como a las azucenas, parecia que Dios la habia hecho de  nieve y oro.      [Footnote 1: Moncayo. See p. 8, note 1]    Y sin embargo, entre los senores comarcanos murmurabase que la hermosa  castellana de Veraton[1] no era tan limpia de sangre como bella, y que  a pesar de sus trenzas rubias y su tez de alabastro, habia tenido por  madre una gitana. Lo de cierto que pudiera haber en estas  murmuraciones, nadie pudo nunca decirlo, porque la verdad era que don  Dionis tuvo una vida bastante azarosa en su juventud, y despues de  combatir largo tiempo bajo la conducta del monarca aragones,[2] del  cual recabo entre otras mercedes el feudo del Moncayo,[3] marchose a  Palestina,[4] en donde anduvo errante algunos anos, para volver por  ultimo a encerrarse en su castillo de Veraton,[5] con una hija  pequena, nacida sin duda en aquellos paises remotos. El unico que  hubiera podido decir algo acerca del misterioso origen de Constanza,  pues acompano a don Dionis en sus lejanas peregrinaciones, era el  padre de Garces, y este habia ya muerto hacia bastante tiempo, sin  decir una sola palabra sobre el asunto ni a su propio hijo, que varias  veces y con muestras de grande interes, se lo habia preguntado.      [Footnote 1: Veraton. See p. 25, note 1.]      [Footnote 2: monarca aragones. See p. 25, note 3.]      [Footnote 3: Moncayo. See p. 8, note 1]      [Footnote 4: Palestina = 'Palestine.' A territory in the southern    part of Syria. Chief city Jerusalem. \"It passed under Mohammedan    rule about 636, was held by the Christians temporarily during the    Crusades [seventh and last under St. Louis 1270-1272], and since    1516 has been in the possession of the Turkish government.\" _Century    Dict._]      [Footnote 5: Veraton. See p. 25, note 1.]    El caracter, tan pronto retraido y melancolico como bullicioso y  alegre de Constanza, la extrana exaltacion de sus ideas, sus  extravagantes caprichos, sus nunca vistas costumbres, hasta la  particularidad de tener los ojos y las cejas negras como la noche,  siendo blanca y rubia como el oro, habian contribuido a dar pabulo a  las hablillas de sus convecinos, y aun el mismo Garces, que tan  intimamente la trataba, habia llegado a persuadirse que su senora era  algo especial y no se parecia a las demas mujeres.    Presente a la relacion de Esteban, como los otros monteros, Garces fue  acaso el unico que oyo con verdadera curiosidad los pormenores de su  increible aventura, y si bien no pudo menos de sonreir cuando el zagal  repitio las palabras de la corza blanca, desde que abandono el soto en  que habian sesteado comenzo a revolver en su mente las mas absurdas  imaginaciones.    No cabe duda que todo eso del hablar las corzas es pura aprension de  Esteban, que es un completo mentecato, decia entre si el joven  montero, mientras que jinete en un poderoso alazan, seguia paso a paso  el palafren de Constanza, la cual tambien parecia mostrarse un tanto  distraida y silenciosa, y retirada del tropel de los cazadores, apenas  tomaba parte en la fiesta. ?Pero quien dice que en lo que refiere ese  simple no existira algo de verdad? prosiguio pensando el mancebo.  Cosas mas extranas hemos visto en el mundo, y una corza blanca bien  puede haberla, puesto que si se ha de dar credito a las cantigas del  pais, San Huberto,[1] patron de los cazadores, tenia una. iOh, si yo  pudiese coger viva una corza blanca para ofrecersela a mi senora!      [Footnote 1: San Huberto = 'St. Hubert.' The patron saint of    hunters; died about 727. His memory is celebrated by the church    November 3. Legend says that he was the son of a nobleman of    Aquitaine, and a keen hunter; and that once when he was engaged in    the chase on Good Friday, in the forest of Ardennes, a stag appeared    to him having a shining crucifix between its antlers. He heard a    warning voice and was converted, entered the chnrch, and became    bishop of Maestricht and Liege. See the _Encyclopedia Americano_.      The role of the deer in mythology, however, is not usually so    beneficent, and \"the antelope, the gazelle, and the stag generally,    instead of helping the hero, involve him rather in perplexity and    peril. This mythical subject is amplified in numerous Hindoo    legends.\" See de Gubernatis, _Zooelogical Mythology_, London, 1872,    vol. ii, p. 84 and following.      La Biche au Bois_ (The Hind of the Woods) of Mme. d'Aulnoy is a    story that offers some striking resemblances to _La Corza Blanca_ of    Becquer. A beautiful princess is transformed by a wicked fairy into    a white hind, which form she is allowed to quit at certain hours of    the day. One day, while still in the form of the hind, she is    pursued by her lover and wounded by an arrow. However, a release    from the enchantment and a happy marriage end the sufferings of the    heroine. In this Spanish tale the transformation is voluntary, which    fact gives to Constanza the traits of a witch.      In Wordsworth's beautiful poem _The White Doe of Rylstone_ we find    the doe divested of all the elements of witchcraft, and in its    solicitude for the gentle and bereft Lady Emily it is likened    symbolically        To the grief of her soul that doth come and go      In the beautiful form of this innocent Doe:      Which, though seemingly doomed in its breast to sustain      A softened remembrance of sorrow and pain,      Is spotless, and holy, and gentle, and bright;      And glides o'er the earth like an angel of light.]    Asi pensando y discurriendo paso Garces la tarde, y cuando ya el sol  comenzo a esconderse por detras de las vecinas lomas y don Dionis  mando volver grupas a su gente para tornar al castillo, separose sin  ser notado de la comitiva y echo en busca del zagal por lo mas espeso  e intrincado del monte.    La noche habia cerrado casi por completo cuando don Dionis llegaba a  las puertas de su castillo. Acto continuo dispusieronle una frugal  colacion, y sentose con su hija a la mesa.    --Y Garces ?donde esta? pregunto Constanza notando que su montero no  se encontraba alli para servirla como tenia de costumbre.    --No sabemos, se apresuraron a contestar los otros servidores;  desaparecio de entre nosotros cerca de la canada, y esta es la hora en  que todavia no le hemos visto.    En este punto llego Garces todo sofocado, cubierta aun de sudor la  frente, pero con la cara mas regocijada y satisfecha que pudiera  imaginarse.    --Perdonadme, senora, exclamo, dirigiendose a Constanza; perdonadme si  he faltado un momento a mi obligacion; pero alla de donde vengo a todo  el correr de mi caballo, como aqui, solo me, ocupaba en serviros.    --?En servirme? repitio Constanza; no comprendo lo que quieres decir.    --Si, senora; en serviros, repitio el joven, pues he averiguado que es  verdad que la corza blanca existe. A mas de Esteban, lo dan por seguro  otros varios pastores, que juran haberla visto mas de una vez, y con  ayuda de los cuales espero en Dios y en mi patron San Huberto que  antes de tres dias, viva o muerta, os la traere al castillo.    --iBah!... iBah!... exclamo Constanza con aire de zumba, mientras  hacian coro a sus palabras las risas mas o menos disimuladas de los  circunstantes; dejate de cacerias nocturnas y de corzas blancas: mira  que el diablo ha dado en la flor de tentar a los simples, y si te  empenas en andarle a los talones, va a dar que reir contigo como con  el pobre Esteban.    --Senora, interrumpio Garces con voz entrecortada y disimulando en lo  posible la colera que le producia el burlon regocijo de sus  companeros, yo no me he visto nunca con el diablo, y por consiguiente,  no se todavia como las gasta; pero conmigo os juro que todo podra  hacer menos dar que reir, porque el uso de ese privilegio solo en vos  se tolerarlo.    Constanza conocio el efecto que su burla habia producido en el  enamorado joven; pero deseando apurar su paciencia hasta lo ultimo,  torno a decir en el mismo tono:    --?Y si al dispararla te saluda con alguna risa del genero de la que  oyo Esteban, o se te rie en la nariz, y al escuchar sus sobrenaturales  carcajadas se te cae la ballesta de las manos, y antes de reponerte  del susto ya ha desaparecido la corza blanca mas ligera que un  relampago?    --iOh! exclamo Garces, en cuanto a eso estad segura que como yo la  topase a tiro de ballesta, aunque me hiciese mas monos que un juglar,  aunque me hablara, no ya en romance, sino en latin como el abad de  Munilla,[1] no se iba[2] sin un arpon en el cuerpo.      [Footnote 1: Munilla. A town of 1170 inhabitants situated in the    province of Logrono to the west of the town of Arnedillo on the    Cidacos. Munilla was a place of considerable importance at the time    in which the events of this story are supposed to have occurred.]      [Footnote 2: no se iba = 'it would not escape.' See p. 108, note 3]    En este punto del dialogo, tercio don Dionis, y con una desesperante  gravedad a traves de la que se adivinaba toda la ironia de sus  palabras, comenzo a darle al ya asendereado mozo los consejos mas  originales del mundo, para el caso de que se encontrase de manos a  boca con el demonio convertido en corza blanca.    A cada nueva ocurrencia de su padre, Constanza fijaba sus ojos en el  atribulado Garces y rompia a reir como una loca, en tanto que los  otros servidores"]]]
