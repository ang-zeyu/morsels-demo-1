I am going to get a  cargo from the bed nearest to the railroad and get the company to freight  it for me to the seaboard.\"    \"Then I shall see you occasionally, Jack.\"    \"Oh, yes. I shall not be far away.\"    Jack was as good as his word, and the following day Plum Plucky proudly  took his place as engineer, with a new fireman to help him.    Jack then began to carry out his scheme of getting a cargo of nitrate to  his native land.    This time he obtained his supply of nitrate from a bed less than ten miles  from the railroad, drawing it to the station with ox teams. With his  better knowledge of the country he met with success in this part of the  undertaking, and then the train carried it to the sea-coast for him at  moderate rates.    Before this had been done he had bargained with a Peruvian captain of a  merchantman to carry the cargo to Philadelphia.    This had proved the most difficult part of his arrangements, for with the  existing war between the countries it was sometime before he could find a  man willing to do it.    But he found one at last and the nitrate was eventually loaded on the  vessel.    It was a proud, and yet an anxious, moment for Jack when he found  everything in readiness to leave the harbor.    The captain had declared his intention of setting sail under cover of  darkness, so as to escape an attack from a Chilian ship should one offer  to dispute his passage.    That afternoon Jack saw Plum to bid him goodbye, feeling sorry to part  with his honest friend.    The latter actually cried.    \"Hang it, Jack! I've a mind to go with you. Think of me in this heathenish  country and you among friends and rolling in wealth.\"    \"All but the wealth, Plum. But I shall be glad to have you go with me.\"    \"I thank you, Jack, but I mustn't. I must stay here long enough to get the  money to pay up the mortgage on dad's farm, when I shall skip by the light  of the moon. You may not find me here when you come back, Jack, but I wish  you well.\"    A little after sunset the Peruvian ship moved slowly out of the harbor of  San Maceo, Jack watching the land as it receded from sight with a peculiar  interest, and his mind ran swiftly back over the eventful time he had  passed in that faraway land.    He had given the captain the last pistole he possessed, as he had been  obliged to pay him in advance to get him to undertake the task, so he was  again penniless. But he had no doubt he would have money enough as soon as  he could get home and dispose of his cargo. Over and again he had figured  out his profit, if it should prove saleable at the moderate price he had  fixed upon it. Is it a wonder his thoughts were in a tumult? Is it strange  that he found it difficult to make himself believe that at last after that  long waiting, he was really homeward bound?    \"How glad they will be to see me!\" he thought. \"And Jenny! She will not be  expecting me. It has been so long since I left. Some of them may be--\"    He was interrupted in his meditations by the report of a gun in the  distance, and, glancing to the port, he discovered a ship coming up  rapidly.    That there was something wrong in the appearance of the stranger was  evident from the bustle and excitement which had suddenly sprung up among  officers and crew, not one of whom spoke anything but Spanish.    All sail had been crowded on that the ship could possibly carry; but  heavily loaded and at best a poor sailer, the new-comer continued to  overhaul them at a startling rate.    Coming alongside of Jack finally, the captain said:    \"We are lost, senor! I ought to lose my head for undertaking such a mad  project.\"    \"It may not be as bad as you seem to think, senor capitan,\" replied Jack,  hoping to encourage the commander.    But all that he could say was in vain.    The Chilian warship, as the stranger really was, continued to keep up its  firing, though the Peruvian vessel had not fired a gun.    Jack anxiously watched the approach of their pursuer, feeling that his  fortune, if not his life, was at stake.    It is possible if the Peruvian had laid to and allowed the other to come  up without the show of running away, that it might have been permitted to  continue its course unmolested. And again it may not have been so.    At any rate the Peruvian captain held to his flight as his only hope of  salvation, until at last a shot, better directed than the random firing so  long kept up, struck the doomed merchantman fairly amidship.    The craft instantly lurched and trembled from bow to stern.    \"She is sinking!\" shrieked the captain. \"Quick--to the boats!\"        Chapter XXI    A Panic on Shipboard        A scene of the wildest description followed the frantic captain's  announcement and order. The sailors were panic stricken, and more than  half of them plunged headlong into the sea.    The captain was scarcely less distracted than his men, and he only added  to the helplessness of the situation by his words and actions.    Jack tried to pacify him by saying:    \"Pardon me, senor capitan, but the ship will not sink at once if at all.  You have plenty of time in which to save your lives.\"    \"But the Chilian! We shall be made prisoners of war. Heaven protect me! I  was a fool to listen to you, Senor North.\"    \"It is too late to think of that now. It is your duty to see if something  cannot be done to stop the ship's leak.\"    It was useless to try to reason with the Peruvian captain. He was sure the  ship was going to sink, and seemed determined that she should.    Meanwhile the Chilian continued to draw nearer, though it had nearly  stopped firing.    The trumpet-like tone of the commander rang over the water just as the  terrified Peruvians lowered a boat and leaped headlong into it, that is,  those who had not previously jumped into the sea.    Finding himself alone on the sinking vessel, which was going down fast,  Jack answered the Chilian's challenge:    \"Ship ahoy! what do you want?\"    \"What ship is that?\"    \"The merchant ship, _Santa Clara_, Senor Captain, now sinking from  the effects of your shot.\"    \"Lay to and I'll come aboard.\"    This command was not obeyed.    The doomed vessel was now lurching fearfully, and Jack knew that he could  not leave it any too soon for his own safety of life. Fortunately the  shore was not so far away but he believed he could reach it, and throwing  off his outer garments, he leaped into the water.    The Peruvians were struggling in every direction, the boat having been  upset by them in their mad endeavors to save themselves. Jack knew that  the farther he got away from them and the quicker he did it, the better it  would be for him. He left them in their furious, but futile, efforts to  escape or drown, as their attempts for life deserved.    After swimming a short distance he looked back to find that he was just in  season to witness the fate of the ship. He saw her make a sudden lurch  forward, and then she seemed to right herself for a moment, but it was her  death struggle, for with the next breath she went downward, quickly  disappearing from sight forever.    \"Another plan gone wrong,\" thought Jack, \"and again I am where I began.\"    A less courageous youth than Jack North must have given up then, but with  the stern determination of his nature not to give up, he resumed his  swimming, reaching the land half an hour later.    \"This is worse than before,\" he said ruefully, as he viewed his drenched  figure, \"for I did save my coat then. Yes, and my cargo of nitrate is  still on the mountain waiting for me. I think I will toss up a cent to see  what I shall do next. No! come to think of it, I haven't got the cent to  do that!\"    His first thought was to return to the machine shop in Tocopilla, but as  De la Pama was nearer he decided to go there in the morning. \"It is  useless for me to remain here,\" he reasoned, \"I wonder how many of the  Peruvians have escaped? They were a set of cowards anyway, and the captain  the biggest fool of them all. I hope he will make good use of my money.\"    Jack laid down supperless that night under the green blanket of a Peruvian  forest, and he went on toward De la Pama the next morning breakfastless,  thinking:    \"There is one thing certain, I will not take Plum's job from him. If he  has no fireman, and will accept me, I will go as his helper.\"    Though he did not seek immediately his friend, almost the first person he  saw in town was Plum. It would be difficult to say which was the more  surprised.    \"What! not gone to the States, Jack?\"    \"No, Plum.\"    \"Something gone wrong, Jack, again?\"    \"About my usual luck, Plum. I am where I began--without a cent in my  pocket,\" and he quickly told the other what had befallen him since they  had parted.    \"It's too bad, Jack, but I'll tell you what I'll do. I have what amounts  to three hundred dollars that I've saved and every dollar of it is yours  till you can pay it back.\"    \"I could not think of taking your hard earnings, Plum, for it is uncertain  if I should ever be able to pay it back.    \"I thank you from the bottom of my heart, but must look for work again.\"    \"Then you shall have my job, Jack. I had rather fire anyway; honest,  Jack.\"    \"Thank you again, Plum, and it's just like your generosity, but I cannot  rob you of your situation. How does your fireman do?\"    \"Tip-top, I am sorry to say. To tell the truth, Jack, he does so well I am  afraid he will get my job away from me. I wish you would take the lever  again, Jack, and let me fire. I never had so good a time in my life as I  did then.\"    This was a little past noon, and a few minutes later Jack would be obliged  to part with Plum, who must start on his return to St. Resa.    \"There is one favor you can do me, Plum. If you will lend me money enough  to buy a pair of oxen I will begin to team a cargo of nitrate down myself.  I do not feel you will "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#17)"],[1,"delay.\"  \"I thank you,\" said K. as soon as Miss Montag had  finished.  He stood slowly up, looked at her, then across the table,  then out the window - the house opposite stood there in the sun - and  went to the door.  Miss Montag followed him a few paces, as if she did  not quite trust him.  At the door, however, both of them had to step  back as it opened and Captain Lanz entered.  This was the first time  that K. had seen him close up.  He was a large man of about forty with a  tanned, fleshy face.  He bowed slightly, intending it also for K., and  then went over to Miss Montag and deferentially kissed her hand.  He was  very elegant in the way he moved. The courtesy he showed towards Miss  Montag made a striking contrast with the way she had been treated by K.  Nonetheless, Miss Montag did not seem to be cross with K. as it even  seemed to him that she wanted to introduce the captain.  K. however, did  not want to be introduced, he would not have been able to show any sort  of friendliness either to Miss Montag or to the captain, the kiss on the  hand had, for K., bound them into a group which would keep him at a  distance from Miss Buerstner whilst at the same time seeming to be  totally harmless and unselfish.  K. thought, however, that he saw more  than that, he thought he also saw that Miss Montag had chosen a means of  doing it that was good, but two-edged.  She exaggerated the importance  of the relationship between K. and Miss Buerstner, and above all she  exaggerated the importance of asking to speak with her and she tried at  the same time to make out that K. was exaggerating everything.  She  would be disappointed, K. did not want to exaggerate anything, he was  aware that Miss Buerstner was a little typist who would not offer him  much resistance for long.  In doing so he deliberately took no account  of what Mrs. Grubach had told him about Miss Buerstner.  All these things  were going through his mind as he left the room with hardly a polite  word.  He wanted to go straight to his room, but a little laugh from  Miss Montag that he heard from the dining room behind him brought him to  the idea that he might prepare a  surprise for the two of them, the  captain and Miss Montag.  He looked round and listened to find out if  there might be any disturbance from any of the surrounding rooms,  everywhere was quiet, the only thing to be heard was the conversation  from the dining room and Mrs. Grubach's voice from the passage leading  to the kitchen.  This seemed an opportune time, K. went to Miss  Buerstner's room and knocked gently.  There was no sound so he knocked  again but there was still no answer in reply.  Was she asleep?  Or was  she really unwell?  Or was she just pretending as she realised it could  only be K. knocking so gently?  K. assumed she was pretending and  knocked harder, eventually, when the knocking brought no result, he  carefully opened the door with the sense of doing something that was not  only improper but also pointless.  In the room there was no-one.  What's  more, it looked hardly at all like the room K. had known before.  Against the wall there were now two beds behind one another, there were  clothes piled up on three chairs near the door, a wardrobe stood open.  Miss Buerstner must have gone out while Miss Montag was speaking to him  in the dining room.  K. was not greatly bothered by this, he had hardly  expected to be able to find Miss Buerstner so easily and had made this  attempt for little more reason than to spite Miss Montag.  But that made  it all the more embarrassing for him when, as he was closing the door  again, he saw Miss Montag and the captain talking in the open doorway of  the dining room.  They had probably been standing there ever since K.  had opened the door, they avoided seeming to observe K. but chatted  lightly and followed his movements with glances, the absent minded  glances to the side such as you make during a conversation.  But these  glances were heavy for K., and he rushed alongside the wall back into  his own room.          Chapter Five  The whip-man            One evening, a few days later, K. was walking along one of the  corridors that separated his office from the main stairway - he was  nearly the last one to leave for home that evening, there remained only  a couple of workers in the light of a single bulb in the dispatch  department - when he heard a sigh from behind a door which he had  himself never opened but which he had always thought just led into a  junk room.  He stood in amazement and listened again to establish  whether he might not be mistaken.  For a while there was silence, but  then came some more sighs.  His first thought was to fetch one of the  servitors, it might well have been worth having a witness present, but  then he was taken by an uncontrollable curiosity that make him simply  yank the door open.  It was, as he had thought, a junk room.  Old,  unusable forms, empty stone ink-bottles lay scattered behind the  entrance.  But in the cupboard-like room itself stood three men,  crouching under the low ceiling.  A candle fixed on a shelf gave them  light.  \"What are you doing here?\" asked K. quietly, but crossly and  without thinking.  One of the men was clearly in charge, and attracted  attention by being dressed in a kind of dark leather costume which left  his neck and chest and his arms exposed.  He did not answer.  But the  other two called out, \"Mr. K.!  We're to be beaten because you made a  complaint about us to the examining judge.\"  And now, K. finally  realised that it was actually the two policemen, Franz and Willem, and  that the third man held a cane in his hand with which to beat them.  \"Well,\" said K., staring at them, \"I didn't make any complaint, I only  said what took place in my home.  And your behaviour was not entirely  unobjectionable, after all.\"  \"Mr. K.,\" said Willem, while Franz clearly  tried to shelter behind him as protection from the third man, \"if you  knew how badly we get paid you wouldn't think so badly of us.  I've got  a family to feed, and Franz here wanted to get married, you just have to  get more money where you can, you can't do it just by working hard, not  however hard you try.  I was sorely tempted by your fine clothes,  policemen aren't allowed to do that sort of thing, course they aren't,  and it wasn't right of us, but it's tradition that the clothes go to the  officers, that's how it's always been, believe me; and it's  understandable too, isn't it, what can things like that mean for anyone  unlucky enough to be arrested?  But if he starts talking about it openly  then the punishment has to follow.\"  \"I didn't know about any of this  that you've been telling me, and I made no sort of request that you be  punished, I was simply acting on principle.\"  \"Franz,\" said Willem,  turning to the other policeman, \"didn't I tell you that the gentleman  didn't say he wanted us to be punished?  Now you can hear for yourself,  he didn't even know we'd have to be punished.\"  \"Don't you let them  persuade you, talking like that,\" said the third man to K., \"this  punishment is both just and unavoidable.\"  \"Don't listen to him,\" said  Willem, interrupting himself only to quickly bring his hand to his mouth  when it had received a stroke of the cane, \"we're only being punished  because you made a complaint against us.  Nothing would have happened to  us otherwise, not even if they'd found out what we'd done.  Can you call  that justice?  Both of us, me especially, we'd proved our worth as good  police officers over a long period - you've got to admit yourself that  as far as official work was concerned we did the job well - things  looked good for us, we had prospects, it's quite certain that we  would've been made whip-men too, like this one, only he had the luck not  to have anyone make a complaint about him, as you really don't get many  complaints like that.  Only that's all finished now, Mr. K., our careers  are at an end, we're going to have to do work now that's far inferior to  police work and besides all this we're going to get this terrible,  painful beating.\"  \"Can the cane really cause so much pain, then?\" asked  K., testing the cane that the whip-man swang in front of him.  \"We're  going to have to strip off totally naked,\" said Willem.  \"Oh, I see,\"  said K., looking straight at the whip-man, his skin was burned brown  like a sailor's, and his face showed health and vigour.  \"Is there  then no possibility of sparing these two their beating?\" he asked him.  \"No,\" said the whip-man, shaking his head with a laugh.  \"Get  undressed!\" he ordered the policemen.  And to K. he said, \"You shouldn't  believe everything they tell you, it's the fear of being beaten, it's  already made them a bit weak in the head.  This one here, for instance,\"  he pointed at Willem, \"all that he told you about his career prospects,  it's just ridiculous.  Look at him, look how fat he is - the first  strokes of the cane will just get lost in all that fat.   Do you know  what it is that's made him so fat?  He's in the habit of, everyone that  gets arrested by him, he eats their breakfast.  Didn't he eat up your  breakfast?  Yeah, I thought as much.  But a man with a belly like that  can't be made into a whip-man and never will be, that is quite out of  the question.\"  \"There are whip-men like that,\" Willem insisted, who had  just released the belt of this trousers.  \"No,\" said the whip-man,  striking him such a blow with the cane on his neck that it made him  wince, \"you shouldn't be listening to this, just get undressed.\"  \"I  would make it well worth your while if you would let them go,\" said K.,  and without looking at the whip-man again - as such matters are best  carried on with both pairs of eyes turned down - he pulled out his  wallet.  \"And then you'd try and put in a complaint against me, too,\"  said the whip-man, \"and get me flogged.  No, no!\"  \"Now, do be  reasonable,\" said K., \"i"]]]
