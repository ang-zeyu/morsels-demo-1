[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423"],[0,"Mike (#17)"],[1,"passage near the junior day-room left the latter  rather limp and exceedingly meek. For the moment all the jauntiness  and exuberance had been drained out of him. He was a punctured  balloon. Reflection, and the distinctly discouraging replies of those  experts in school law to whom he had put the question, \"What d'you  think he'll do?\" had induced a very chastened frame of mind.    He perceived that he had walked very nearly into a hornets' nest, and  the realisation of his escape made him agree readily to all the  conditions imposed. The apology to the Gazeka was made without  reserve, and the offensively forgiving, say-no-more-about-it-but-take  care-in-future air of the head of the house roused no spark of  resentment in him, so subdued was his fighting spirit. All he wanted  was to get the thing done with. He was not inclined to be critical.    And, most of all, he felt grateful to Bob. Firby-Smith, in the course  of his address, had not omitted to lay stress on the importance of  Bob's intervention. But for Bob, he gave him to understand, he, Mike,  would have been prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law. Mike  came away with a confused picture in his mind of a horde of furious  prefects bent on his slaughter, after the manner of a stage \"excited  crowd,\" and Bob waving them back. He realised that Bob had done him a  good turn. He wished he could find some way of repaying him.    Curiously enough, it was an enemy of Bob's who suggested the  way--Burton, of Donaldson's. Burton was a slippery young gentleman,  fourteen years of age, who had frequently come into contact with  Bob in the house, and owed him many grudges. With Mike he had always  tried to form an alliance, though without success.    He happened to meet Mike going to school next morning, and unburdened  his soul to him. It chanced that Bob and he had had another small  encounter immediately after breakfast, and Burton felt revengeful.    \"I say,\" said Burton, \"I'm jolly glad you're playing for the first  against Geddington.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Mike.    \"I'm specially glad for one reason.\"    \"What's that?\" inquired Mike, without interest.    \"Because your beast of a brother has been chucked out. He'd have been  playing but for you.\"    At any other time Mike would have heard Bob called a beast without  active protest. He would have felt that it was no business of his to  fight his brother's battles for him. But on this occasion he deviated  from his rule.    He kicked Burton. Not once or twice, but several times, so that  Burton, retiring hurriedly, came to the conclusion that it must be  something in the Jackson blood, some taint, as it were. They were  _all_ beasts.           *       *       *       *       *    Mike walked on, weighing this remark, and gradually made up his mind.  It must be remembered that he was in a confused mental condition, and  that the only thing he realised clearly was that Bob had pulled him  out of an uncommonly nasty hole. It seemed to him that it was  necessary to repay Bob. He thought the thing over more fully during  school, and his decision remained unaltered.    On the evening before the Geddington match, just before lock-up, Mike  tapped at Burgess's study door. He tapped with his right hand, for his  left was in a sling.    \"Come in!\" yelled the captain. \"Hullo!\"    \"I'm awfully sorry, Burgess,\" said Mike. \"I've crocked my wrist a  bit.\"    \"How did you do that? You were all right at the nets?\"    \"Slipped as I was changing,\" said Mike stolidly.    \"Is it bad?\"    \"Nothing much. I'm afraid I shan't be able to play to-morrow.\"    \"I say, that's bad luck. Beastly bad luck. We wanted your batting,  too. Be all right, though, in a day or two, I suppose?\"    \"Oh, yes, rather.\"    \"Hope so, anyway.\"    \"Thanks. Good-night.\"    \"Good-night.\"    And Burgess, with the comfortable feeling that he had managed to  combine duty and pleasure after all, wrote a note to Bob at  Donaldson's, telling him to be ready to start with the team for  Geddington by the 8.54 next morning.          CHAPTER XVI    AN EXPERT EXAMINATION      Mike's Uncle John was a wanderer on the face of the earth. He had been  an army surgeon in the days of his youth, and, after an adventurous  career, mainly in Afghanistan, had inherited enough money to keep him  in comfort for the rest of his life. He had thereupon left the  service, and now spent most of his time flitting from one spot of  Europe to another. He had been dashing up to Scotland on the day when  Mike first became a Wrykynian, but a few weeks in an uncomfortable  hotel in Skye and a few days in a comfortable one in Edinburgh had  left him with the impression that he had now seen all that there was  to be seen in North Britain and might reasonably shift his camp again.    Coming south, he had looked in on Mike's people for a brief space,  and, at the request of Mike's mother, took the early express to Wrykyn  in order to pay a visit of inspection.    His telegram arrived during morning school. Mike went down to the  station to meet him after lunch.    Uncle John took command of the situation at once.    \"School playing anybody to-day, Mike? I want to see a match.\"    \"They're playing Geddington. Only it's away. There's a second match  on.\"    \"Why aren't you--Hullo, I didn't see. What have you been doing to  yourself?\"    \"Crocked my wrist a bit. It's nothing much.\"    \"How did you do that?\"    \"Slipped while I was changing after cricket.\"    \"Hurt?\"    \"Not much, thanks.\"    \"Doctor seen it?\"    \"No. But it's really nothing. Be all right by Monday.\"    \"H'm. Somebody ought to look at it. I'll have a look later on.\"    Mike did not appear to relish this prospect.    \"It isn't anything, Uncle John, really. It doesn't matter a bit.\"    \"Never mind. It won't do any harm having somebody examine it who knows  a bit about these things. Now, what shall we do. Go on the river?\"    \"I shouldn't be able to steer.\"    \"I could manage about that. Still, I think I should like to see the  place first. Your mother's sure to ask me if you showed me round. It's  like going over the stables when you're stopping at a country-house.  Got to be done, and better do it as soon as possible.\"    It is never very interesting playing the part of showman at school.  Both Mike and his uncle were inclined to scamp the business. Mike  pointed out the various landmarks without much enthusiasm--it is only  after one has left a few years that the school buildings take to  themselves romance--and Uncle John said, \"Ah yes, I see. Very nice,\"  two or three times in an absent voice; and they passed on to the  cricket field, where the second eleven were playing a neighbouring  engineering school. It was a glorious day. The sun had never seemed to  Mike so bright or the grass so green. It was one of those days when  the ball looks like a large vermilion-coloured football as it leaves  the bowler's hand. If ever there was a day when it seemed to Mike that  a century would have been a certainty, it was this Saturday. A sudden,  bitter realisation of all he had given up swept over him, but he  choked the feeling down. The thing was done, and it was no good  brooding over the might-have-beens now. Still--And the Geddington  ground was supposed to be one of the easiest scoring grounds of all  the public schools!    \"Well hit, by George!\" remarked Uncle John, as Trevor, who had gone in  first wicket for the second eleven, swept a half-volley to leg round  to the bank where they were sitting.    \"That's Trevor,\" said Mike. \"Chap in Donaldson's. The fellow at the  other end is Wilkins. He's in the School House. They look as if they  were getting set. By Jove,\" he said enviously, \"pretty good fun  batting on a day like this.\"    Uncle John detected the envious note.    \"I suppose you would have been playing here but for your wrist?\"    \"No, I was playing for the first.\"    \"For the first? For the school! My word, Mike, I didn't know that. No  wonder you're feeling badly treated. Of course, I remember your father  saying you had played once for the school, and done well; but I  thought that was only as a substitute. I didn't know you were a  regular member of the team. What bad luck. Will you get another  chance?\"    \"Depends on Bob.\"    \"Has Bob got your place?\"    Mike nodded.    \"If he does well to-day, they'll probably keep him in.\"    \"Isn't there room for both of you?\"    \"Such a lot of old colours. There are only three vacancies, and  Henfrey got one of those a week ago. I expect they'll give one of the  other two to a bowler, Neville-Smith, I should think, if he does well  against Geddington. Then there'll be only the last place left.\"    \"Rather awkward, that.\"    \"Still, it's Bob's last year. I've got plenty of time. But I wish I  could get in this year.\"    After they had watched the match for an hour, Uncle John's restless  nature asserted itself.    \"Suppose we go for a pull on the river now?\" he suggested.    They got up.    \"Let's just call at the shop,\" said Mike. \"There ought to be a  telegram from Geddington by this time. I wonder how Bob's got on.\"    Apparently Bob had not had a chance yet of distinguishing himself. The  telegram read, \"Geddington 151 for four. Lunch.\"    \"Not bad that,\" said Mike. \"But I believe they're weak in bowling.\"    They walked down the road towards the school landing-stage.    \"The worst of a school,\" said Uncle John, as he pulled up-stream with  strong, unskilful stroke, \"is that one isn't allowed to smoke on the  grounds. I badly want a pipe. The next piece of shade that you see,  sing out, and we'll put in there.\"    \"Pull your left,\" said Mike. \"That willow's what you want.\"    Uncle John looked over his shoulder, caught a crab, recovered himself,  and steered the boat in under the shade of the branches.    \"Put the rope over that stump. Can you manage with one hand? Here, let  me--Done it? Good. A-ah!\"    He blew a great cloud of smoke into the air, and sighed contentedly.

I wonder how that fairy  knew I sat on the damp grass. I'm so sorry; for I did want a pony, and  might have had it if I'd only minded,\" said May, angry with herself for  spoiling all her fun.    It _was_ spoilt; for she had such a cold next day she couldn't go out  at all, but had to take medicine and keep by the fire, while the other  children had a lovely picnic.    \"I won't wish for anything to-night; I don't deserve a present, I was  so disobedient. But I _have_ tried to be patient,\" said May, feeling for  the box.    The fairy had not forgotten her, and there was a beautiful picture-book,  full of new, nice stories printed in colored ink.    \"How splendid to read to-morrow while I'm shut up!\" she said, and went  to sleep very happily.    All the next day she enjoyed the pretty pictures and funny tales, and  never complained or fretted at all, but was so much better the doctor  said she could go out to-morrow, if it was fine.    \"Now I will wish for the pony,\" said May, in her bed. But there was  nothing in the box except a little red-silk rope, like a halter. She did  not know what to do with it that night, but she did the next morning;  for just as she was dressed her brother called from the garden,--    \"May, look out and see what we found in the stable. None of us can catch  him, so do come and see if you can; your name is on the card tied to his  mane.\"    May looked, and there was a snow-white pony racing about the yard as if  he was having a fine frolic. Then she knew the halter was for him, and  ran down to catch him. The minute she appeared, the pony went to her and  put his nose in her hand, neighing, as if he said,--    \"This is my little mistress; I will mind her and serve her well.\"    May was delighted, and very proud when the pony let her put on the  saddle and bridle that lay in the barn all ready to use. She jumped up  and rode gayly down the road; and Will and mamma and all the maids and  Floss and Snowdrop ran to see the pretty sight. The children at school  were much excited when she came trotting up, and all wanted to ride  Prince. He was very gentle, and every one had a ride; but May had the  best fun, for she could go every day for long trots by the carriage when  mamma and Will drove out. A blue habit and a hat with a long feather  were bought that afternoon; and May was so happy and contented at night  that she said to herself as she lay in bed,--    \"I'll wish for something for Will now, and see if I get it. I don't want  any more presents yet; I've had my share, and I'd love to give away to  other people who have no fairy box.\"    So she wished for a nice boat, and in the box lay a key with the name  \"Water Lily\" on it. She guessed what it meant, and in the morning told  her brother to come to the river and see what she had for him. There lay  a pretty green and white boat, with cushioned seats, a sail all spread,  and at the mast-head a little flag flying in the wind, with the words  \"Water Lily\" on it in gold letters.    Will was so surprised and pleased to find that it was his, he turned  heels over head on the grass, kissed May, and skipped into his boat,  crying, \"All aboard!\" as if eager to try it at once.    May followed, and they sailed away down the lovely river, white with  real lilies, while the blackbirds sang in the green meadows on either  side, and boys and girls stopped on the bridges to see them pass.    After that May kept on trying to be good, and wishing for things for  herself and other people, till she forgot how to be naughty, and was the  sweetest little girl in the world. Then there was no need of fairies to  help her; and one night the box was not under the pillow.    \"Well, I've had my share of pretty things, and must learn to do without.  I'm glad I tried; for now it is easy to be good, and I don't need to  be rewarded,\" said May, as she fell asleep, quite happy and contented,  though she did wish she could have seen the fairy just once.    Next morning the first thing she saw was a beautiful bracelet, shining  on the table; and while she stood admiring it, she heard the little  voice sing,--      \"Here is the bracelet      For good little May    To wear on her arm      By night and by day.    When it shines like the sun,      All's going well;    But when you are bad,      A sharp prick will tell.    Farewell, little girl,      For now we must part.    Make a fairy-box, dear,      Of your own happy heart;    And take out for all      Sweet gifts every day,    Till all the year round      Is like beautiful May.\"    As the last words were sung, right before her eyes she saw a tiny  creature swinging on the rose that stood there in a vase,--a lovely elf,  with wings like a butterfly, a gauzy dress, and a star on her forehead.  She smiled, and waved her hand as she slowly rose and fluttered away  into the sunshine, till she vanished from sight, leaving May with the  magic bracelet on her arm, and the happy thought that at last she had  _really_ seen a fairy.      [Illustration: Johnny leaned forward to enjoy the long-desired \"peek.\"]          IX.    A HOLE IN THE WALL.    PART I.      If any one had asked Johnny Morris who were his best friends, he would  have answered,--    \"The sun and the wind, next to mother.\"    Johnny lived in a little court that led off from one of the busiest  streets in the city,--a noisy street, where horse-car bells tinkled  and omnibuses rumbled all day long, going and coming from several great  depots near by. The court was a dull place, with only two or three  shabby houses in it, and a high blank wall at the end.    The people who hurried by were too busy to do more than to glance at  the lame boy who sat in the sunshine against the wall, or to guess that  there was a picture-gallery and a circulating-library in the court. But  Johnny had both, and took such comfort in them that he never could be  grateful enough to the wind that brought him his books and pictures, nor  to the sun that made it possible for him to enjoy them in the open air,  far more than richer folk enjoy their fine galleries and libraries.    A bad fall, some months before the time this story begins, did something  to Johnny's back which made his poor legs nearly useless, and changed  the lively, rosy boy into a pale cripple. His mother took in fine  washing, and worked hard to pay doctors' bills and feed and clothe her  boy, who could no longer run errands, help with the heavy tubs, or go to  school. He could only pick out laces for her to iron, lie on his bed in  pain for hours, and, each fair day, hobble out to sit in a little old  chair between the water-butt and the leaky tin boiler in which he kept  his library.    But he was a happy boy, in spite of poverty and pain; and the day a  great gust came blowing fragments of a gay placard and a dusty newspaper  down the court to his feet, was the beginning of good fortune for  patient Johnny. There was a theatre in the street beyond, and other  pictured bits found their way to him; for the frolicsome wind liked to  whisk the papers around the corner, and chase them here and there till  they settled under the chair or flew wildly over the wall.    Faces, animals, people, and big letters, all came to cheer the boy, who  was never tired of collecting these waifs and strays; cutting out the  big pictures to paste on the wall with the leavings of mother's starch,  and the smaller in the scrap-book he made out of stout brown wrappers  or newspapers, when he had read the latter carefully. Soon it was a  very gay wall; for mother helped, standing on a chair, to put the large  pictures up, when Johnny had covered all the space he could reach.  The books were laid carefully away in the boiler, after being smoothly  ironed out and named to suit Johnny's fancy by pasting letters on the  back. This was the circulating library; for not only did the papers  whisk about the court to begin with, but the books they afterward made  went the rounds among the neighbors till they were worn out.    The old cobbler next door enjoyed reading the anecdotes on Sunday when  he could not work; the pale seamstress upstairs liked to look over  advertisements of the fine things which she longed for; and Patsey  Flynn, the newsboy, who went by each day to sell his papers at the  station, often paused to look at the play-bills,--for he adored the  theatre, and entertained Johnny with descriptions of the splendors there  to be beheld, till he felt as if he had really been, and had known all  the famous actors, from Humpty Dumpty to the great Salvini.    Now and then a flock of dirty children would stray into the court and  ask to see the \"pretty picters.\" Then Johnny was a proud and happy  boy; for, armed with a clothes-pole, he pointed out and explained the  beauties of his gallery, feeling that he was a public benefactor when  the poor babies thanked him warmly, and promised to come again and bring  all the nice papers they could pick up.    These were Johnny's pleasures: but he had two sorrows,--one, a very real  one, his aching back; and the other, a boyish longing to climb the wall  and see what was on the other side, for it seemed a most wonderful and  delightful place to the poor child, shut up in that dismal court, with  no playmates and few comforts.    He amused himself with imagining how it looked over there, and nearly  every night added some new charm to this unseen country, when his mother  told him fairy tales to get him to sleep. He peopled it with the dear  old characters all children know and love. The white cat that sat on  the wall was Puss in Boots to him, or Whittington's good friend.  Blue-beard's wives were hidden in the house of whose upper windows the  boy could just catch glimpses. Red Riding-hood met the wolf in the grove  of chestnuts that rustled over there; and Jack's Beanstalk grew up just  such a wall as that, he"]]]
