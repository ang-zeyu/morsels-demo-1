It is  just such a work, in short, as some wicked enemy of that, school might be  supposed to have devised, on purpose to make it ridiculous.\"    Lord Byron, on the publication of an early volume, is counselled \"that he  do forthwith abandon poetry ... the mere rhyming of the final syllable,  even when accompanied by the presence of a certain number of feet ... is  not the whole art of poetry. We would entreat him to believe,\" continued  the reviewer, \"that a certain portion of liveliness, somewhat of fancy, is  necessary to constitute a poem; and that a poem in the present day, to  be read, must contain at least one thought....\" It was this attack that  brought forth Byron's \"English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.\"    As long as Jeffrey hoped to enlist Southey to write for the Edinburgh  Review, he treated him with some favor. But Southey took up with the  Quarterly. \"The Laureate,\" says the Edinburgh presently, \"has now been  out of song for a long time: But we had comforted ourselves with the  supposition that he was only growing fat and lazy.... The strain, however,  of this publication, and indeed of some that went before it, makes us  apprehensive that a worse thing has befallen him ... that the worthy  inditer of epics is falling gently into dotage.\"    Now for the Quarterly Review, if by chance it can show an equal spleen!    There lived in the early days of the nineteenth century a woman by the name  of Lady Morgan, who was the author of several novels and books of travel.  Although her record in intelligence and morals is good, John Croker,  who regularly reviewed her books, accuses her works of licentiousness,  profligacy, irreverence, blasphemy, libertinism, disloyalty and atheism.  There are twenty-six pages of this in one review only, and any paragraph  would be worth the quoting for its ferocity. After this attack it was  Macaulay who said he hated Croker like \"cold boiled veal.\"    The Quarterly reviewed Keats' \"Endymion,\" although the writer naively  states at the outset that he has not read the poem. \"Not that we have been  wanting in our duty,\" he writes, \"far from it--indeed, we have made efforts  almost as superhuman as the story itself appears to be, to get through it;  but with the fullest stretch of our perseverance we are forced to confess  that we have not been able to struggle beyond the first of the four  books....\" Finally he questions whether Keats is the author's name, for  he doubts \"that any man in his senses would put his real name to such a  rhapsody.\"    Leigh Hunt's \"Rimini\" the Quarterly finds to be an \"ungrammatical,  unauthorized, chaotic jargon, such as we believe was never before spoken,  much less written.... We never,\" concludes the reviewer, \"in so few lines  saw so many clear marks of the vulgar impatience of a low man, conscious  and ashamed of his wretched vanity, and labouring, with coarse flippancy,  to scramble over the bounds of birth and education, and fidget himself into  the stout-heartedness of being familiar with a Lord.\" In a later review,  Hunt is a propounder of atheism. \"Henceforth,\" says the reviewer, \"... he  may slander a few more eminent characters, he may go on to deride venerable  and holy institutions, he may stir up more discontent and sedition, but he  will have no peace of mind within ... he will live and die unhonoured  in his own generation, and, for his own sake it is to be hoped, moulder  unknown in those which are to follow.\"    Hazlitt belongs to a \"class of men by whom literature is more than at any  period disgraced.\" His style is suited for washerwomen, a \"class of  females with whom ... he and his friend Mr. Hunt particularly delight to  associate.\"    Shelley, writes the Quarterly, \"is one of that industrious knot of authors,  the tendency of whose works we have in our late Numbers exposed to the  caution of our readers ... for with perfect deliberation and the steadiest  perseverance he perverts all the gifts of his nature, and does all the  injury, both public and private, which his faculties enable him to  perpetrate.\" His \"poetry is in general a mere jumble of words and  heterogeneous ideas.\" \"The Cloud\" is \"simple nonsense.\" \"Prometheus  Unbound\" is a \"great storehouse of the obscure and unintelligible.\" In the  \"Sensitive Plant\" there is \"no meaning.\" And for Shelley himself, he is  guilty of a great many terrible things, including verbiage, impiety,  immorality and absurdity.    Of Blackwood's Magazine the special victims were Keats and Hunt and  Coleridge. \"Mr. Coleridge,\" says the reviewer, \"... seems to believe that  every tongue is wagging in his praise--that every ear is open to imbibe the  oracular breathings of his inspiration ... no sound is so sweet to him as  that of his own voice ... he seems to consider the mighty universe itself  as nothing better than a mirror in which, with a grinning and idiot  self-complacency, he may contemplate the physiognomy of Samuel Taylor  Coleridge.... Yet insignificant as he assuredly is, he cannot put pen to  paper without a feeling that millions of eyes are fixed upon him....\"    Leigh Hunt, says Blackwood, \"is a man of extravagant pretensions ...  exquisitely bad taste and extremely vulgar modes of thinking.\" His  \"Rimini\" \"is so wretchedly written that one feels disgust at its pretense,  affectation and gaudiness, ignorance, vulgarity, irreverence, quackery,  glittering and rancid obscenities.\"    Blackwood's wrote of the \"calm, settled, imperturbable, drivelling idiocy  of Endymion,\" and elsewhere of Keats' \"prurient and vulgar lines, evidently  meant for some young lady east of Temple Bar.... It is a better and a wiser  thing,\" it commented, \"to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet; so  back to the shop, Mr. John, back to 'plasters, pills and ointment  boxes.'\" And even when Shelley wrote his \"Adonais\" on the death of Keats,  Blackwood's met it with a contemptible parody:    \"Weep for my Tom cat! all ye Tabbies weep!\"    Perhaps I have quoted enough. This is the parentage of our silken and  flattering criticism.    The pages of these old reviews rest yellow on the shelves. From them there  comes a smell of rotting leather, as though the infection spreads. The hour  grows late. Like the ghost of the elder Hamlet, I detect the morning to be  near.          The Pursuit of Fire      Reader, if by chance you have the habit of writing--whether they be sermons  to hurl across your pews, or sonnets in the Spring--doubtless you have  moments when you sit at your desk bare of thoughts. Mother Hubbard's  cupboard when she went to seek the bone was not more empty. In such plight  you chew your pencil as though it were stuff to feed your brain. Or if you  are of delicate taste, you fall upon your fingers. Or in the hope that  exercise will stir your wits, you pace up and down the room and press your  nose upon the window if perhaps the grocer's boy shall rouse you. Some  persons draw pictures on their pads or put pot-hooks on their letters--for  talent varies--or they roughen up their hair. I knew one gifted fellow  whose shoes presently would cramp him until he kicked them off, when at  once the juices of his intellect would flow. Genius, I am told, sometimes  locks its door and, if unrestrained, peels its outer wrappings. Or, in your  poverty, you run through the pages of a favorite volume, with a notebook  for a sly theft to start you off. In what dejection you have fallen! It is  best that you put on your hat and take your stupid self abroad.    Or maybe you think that your creative fire will blaze, if instead of  throwing in your wet raw thoughts, you feed it a few seasoned bits. You  open, therefore, the drawer of your desk where you keep your rejected and  broken fragments--for your past has not been prosperous--hopeful against  experience that you can recast one of these to your present mood. This  is mournful business. Certain paragraphs that came from you hot are now  patched and shivery. Their finer meaning has run out between the lines as  though these spaces were sluices for the proper drainage of the page. You  had best put on your hat. You will get no comfort from these stale papers.    One evening lately, being in this plight, I spread out before me certain  odds and ends. I had dug deeper than usual in the drawer and had brought up  a yellow stratum of a considerable age. I was poring upon these papers and  was wondering whether I could fit them to a newer measure, when I heard a  slight noise behind me. I glanced around and saw that a man had entered the  room and was now seated in a chair before the fire. In the common nature  of things this should have been startling, for the hour was late--twelve  o'clock had struck across the way--and I had thought that I was quite  alone. But there was something so friendly and easy in his attitude--he  was a young man, little more than a lanky boy--that instead of being  frightened, I swung calmly around for a better look. He sat with his legs  stretched before him and with his chin resting in his hand, as though in  thought. By the light that fell on him from the fire, I saw that he wore a  brown checked suit and that he was clean and respectable in appearance. His  face was in shadow.    \"Good evening,\" I said, \"you startled me.\"    \"I am sorry,\" he replied. \"I beg your pardon. I was going by and I saw your  light. I wished to make your acquaintance. But I saw at once that I was  intruding, so I sat here. You were quite absorbed. Would you mind if I  mended the fire?\"    Without waiting for an answer, he took the poker and dealt the logs several  blows. It didn't greatly help the flame, but he poked with such enjoyment  that I smiled. I have myself rather a liking for stirring a fire. He set  another log in place. Then he drew from his pocket a handful of dried  orange peel. \"I love to see it burn,\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10027"],[0,"The Triple Alliance, Its Trials and Triumphs (#18)"],[1," Diggory; \"I didn't  think he'd let us off so easily.\"    \"He's all right as long as you don't cross him,\" answered Carton.  \"He used to be pretty strict, but he doesn't seem to care now what  fellows do.  He's very thick with Fletcher's brother--that's one reason  why he didn't do anything just now; but I can tell you he's a nasty chap  to deal with when he's in a wax.\"    The prefect locked the empty building, and turning on his heel caught  sight of our three friends, who were standing close by waiting for  \"Rats.\"    \"Hullo, you new kids! what are you called?\"    The usual answer was given, and Thurston passed on, little thinking what  good cause he would have before the end of the year for remembering the  names of the trio, and altogether unaware of the prominent part which  the Triple Alliance was destined to play in his own private affairs as  well as in the fortunes of Ronleigh College.        CHAPTER IX.      A HOLIDAY ADVENTURE.    The weeks slipped away, and the Triple Alliance soon got over their  new-boy trials, and began to enjoy all the rights and privileges of  Ronleigh College boys.  They wrote letters to Miss Eleanor and to their  former schoolfellows, and received in reply the latest news from The  Birches.    \"The Philistines are quite friendly now,\" wrote Acton.  \"We had a match  against them last week on their ground, and they gave us tea after.  It's awfully slow; I almost wish that chap Noaks was back.\"    \"So do I,\" added Diggory, as he finished the sentence; \"we could very  well spare him.\"    \"Oh, he's all right,\" answered Jack Vance; \"that row's blown over now.  As long as we leave him alone he won't interfere with us.\"    \"Won't he!\" returned the other; \"you take my word for it, he hasn't  forgotten what you said about his father, and he's only waiting for a  chance to pay us out.  Whenever I go near him he looks as black as ink.\"    It was customary at Ronleigh to have what was called a half-term  holiday.  This was usually given on a Monday, to enable those boys who  lived within a short distance of the school to spend the week end  at home; while, in the winter or spring terms, the boarders who remained  at the school usually devoted the greater portion of the day to a  paper-chase.    \"I shall go home,\" said Jack Vance to his two chums; \"Todderton's only  about half an hour's ride from here on the railway.  And, I say, I've  got a grand idea: I'm going to write and get my mater to invite you  fellows to come too!  It would be jolly to have a meeting there of the  Triple Alliance, and I'm sure old Denson would let you go if we came  back on Monday night.\"    Both Mugford and Diggory were charmed with the idea.  \"But d'you really  think your mater would have us?\" they asked.    \"Of course she will, if I ask her,\" answered Jack, and straightway sat  down to write the letter.    By Wednesday evening everything, including the formal invitation and the  doctors permission to accept the same, had been obtained, and for the  two following days the Triple Alliance could talk or think of little  else besides their projected excursion.  At length Saturday came, and as  soon as morning school was over they rushed upstairs to change into  their best clothes; and having crammed their night-shirts, brushes and  combs, etc., into a hand-bag, hurried off to the railway station, in  order that they might, as Jack put it, \"be home in time for dinner.\"    Just as they were getting into the train, who should come out of the  booking-office but young Noaks.    \"Hullo!\" said Jack.  \"He must be going home too; I hope he won't come in  here.\"    The new-comer, however, had no intention of making another attempt to  force his society on the Triple Alliance; he passed them with a surly  nod, and entered a compartment at the other end of the train.    Jack Vance lived in the suburbs of Todderton, about twenty minutes' walk  from the railway; but for all that he managed to carry out his intention  of being home in time for dinner; and the three boys, after receiving a  hearty welcome, were soon seated down to a repast which came very  acceptable after seven weeks of school fare.    \"Jack,\" said Mr. Vance, \"you know that house that was to let just on the  other side of The Hermitage?  Who d'you think's taken it?\"    \"I don't know, father.\"    \"Why, that man Simpson, the uncle of your friend what's-his-name.\"    \"He isn't my friend,\" answered Jack.  \"You mean Noaks.  Fancy his coming  to live so near to us as that! We saw him in the train just now.  He's here for the holiday.\"    \"I ought to tell you,\" continued Mr. Vance, turning to Diggory, \"that  our next-door neighbour is called 'The Hermit.'  He's a queer old  fellow, who lives by himself, and never makes friends or speaks to any  one.  He's supposed to be very clever, and I've heard it said that he's  got a very valuable collection of coins, and is quite an authority on  the subject; it's one of his hobbies.\"    \"I suppose,\" said Mugford thoughtfully, \"that as he's a hermit that's  why his place is called The Hermitage.\"    \"Well done, Mug!\" said Jack, speaking with his mouth pretty full;  \"you're getting quite sharp.\"    \"Yes, that's it,\" continued Mr. Vance, laughing.  \"The old man's away  from home just now; he was suffering from rheumatism very badly, and the  doctor ordered him to a course of treatment at some baths.\"    The conversation turned on other topics, and when at length they rose  from the table, Jack proposed a stroll round the garden.    There were many things to see--some pet rabbits, a swing, and an old  summer-house, which Jack, being, we should say, of a decidedly nautical  turn of mind, had turned into a sort of miniature shipbuilding yard  for the construction of model vessels; though at present the chief use  to which the place seemed to have been put was the production of a great  amount of chips and shavings.    \"I say,\" exclaimed the owner, after he and his friends had amused  themselves for some time boring holes in the door with a brace, \"I know  what we'll do: let's go over and explore The Hermitage!\"    Anything with a spice of excitement in it was meat and drink to Diggory.  He immediately seconded the proposition, and Mugford, after a moment's  hesitation, agreed to join his companions in the enterprise.    They strolled off down the path, and soon reached a long stretch of  brick wall, the top of which was thickly covered with fragments of  broken bottles.    \"There's a place down at the other end where we can get over,\" said  Jack.  \"I smashed the glass with a hammer, because I lost a ball and had  to climb over and get it, one day last holidays.\"    The Hermitage was surrounded on all sides by a thick mass of shrubs and  trees, through which a moment later the Triple Alliance were cautiously  threading their way.  Emerging from the bushes, they found themselves  standing on a gravel path, green with moss and weeds, which ran round  the house--a queer, dilapidated-looking building, which seemed sadly in  want of repair: the plaster was cracked and discoloured, while the doors  and windows had long stood in need of a fresh coating of paint.    \"I say,\" whispered Mugford, \"hadn't we better go back? what if the old  chap's at home!\"    \"Oh, it's all right; there's nobody about,\" answered Jack.  \"Let's go on  and see what the place is really like.\"    They tip-toed round the building.  It was evidently unoccupied, though  the delightful sense of uncertainty that at any moment some one might  pounce out upon them or walk down the drive made the questionable  adventure very charming.    \"Have you ever been inside?\" asked Diggory.    \"No, rather not; I don't think any one has except the doctor, and an old  woman who comes in to do the house-work.\"    \"Well, then, I'm going in,\" answered Diggory, with a twinkle in his eye.    \"Go on!  Why, you might be had up for house-breaking!\"    \"Rubbish! I'm not going to steal anything.--Here, Mug, lend me your  knife a minute.\"    \"I don't believe this one's fastened,\" he continued, walking up to one  of the windows.  \"No, it isn't.  Bother!  I'm awfully sorry, Mugford.\"    Using the big blade of the clasp-knife as a lever, Diggory had just  succeeded in raising the sash the fraction of an inch, when the steel  suddenly snapped off short at the handle.    \"Oh, never mind,\" said the owner; \"let's go back now.  What if we're  seen!\"    \"Oh, there's no fear of that,\" answered Jack, who was always infected  with the adventurous spirit of his chum.--\"Go on, Diggy; I'll come  too.\"    By inserting their fingers in the aperture, the boys soon raised the  sash, and a few seconds later Diggory mounted the ledge and scrambled  through the window \"Come on,\" he said; \"the coast's all clear.\"    Jack Vance joined him immediately, and Mugford, not wishing to be left  alone outside, was not long in making up his mind to follow his  companions.    The room in which the three boys found themselves was evidently a  library or study.  Book-shelves, and cupboards with glass doors,  containing geological and other specimens, occupied much of the wall  space; while in the centre of the floor stood a large writing-table,  covered with a miscellaneous collection of pens, ink-pots, bundles of  papers, and a polished mahogany box which could easily be recognized as  a microscope-case.    The intruders stood for a few moments gazing round in silence.  The place did not look very interesting, and smelt rather damp and  mouldy.    \"I say,\" exclaimed Jack Vance, \"look there: he don't seem very careful  how he leaves his things when he goes away.\"    As he spoke he pointed across to the opposite side of the room, where,  between two bookcases, an iron safe had been let into the wall.  The heavy door was standing half open, while the floor beneath was  strewn with a quantity of shallow wooden trays lined with green baize.    \"Old bachelors are always untidy,\" remarked Diggory.  \"Let's see where  this door leads to.\""]]]
