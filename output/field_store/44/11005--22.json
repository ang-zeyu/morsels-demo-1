This plan of attack was the more readily  embraced by the Belgae, as the nature of the locality favoured its  execution. The Nervii, in fact, always weak in cavalry (their whole  force was composed of infantry), were accustomed, in order to impede  more easily the cavalry of their neighbours, to notch and bend  horizontally young trees, the numerous branches of which, interlaced and  mingled with brambles and brushwood, formed thick hedges, a veritable  wall which nothing could pass through, impenetrable even to the  eye.[260] As this kind of obstacle was very embarrassing to the march of  the Roman army, the Nervii resolved to hide themselves in the woods  which then covered the heights of Haumont, to watch there the moment  when it would debouch on the opposite heights of the Sambre, to wait  till they perceived the file of baggage, and then immediately to rush  upon the troops which preceded.[261] (_See Plate 10._)      [Sidenote: Battle on the Sambre.]    VII. The centurions sent to reconnoitre had selected for the  establishment of the camp the heights of Neuf-Mesnil. These descend in a  uniform slope to the very banks of the river. Those of Boussieres, to  which they join, end, on the contrary, at the Sambre, in sufficiently  bold escarpments, the elevation of which varies from five to fifteen  metres, and which, inaccessible near Boussieres, may be climbed a little  lower, opposite the wood of Quesnoy. The Sambre, in all this extent, was  no more than about three feet deep. On the right bank, the heights of  Haumont, opposite those of Neuf-Mesnil, descend on all sides in gentle  and regular slopes to the level of the river. In the lower part, they  were bare for a breadth of about 200 Roman paces (300 metres), reckoning  from the Sambre; and then the woods began, which covered the upper  parts. It was in these woods, impenetrable to the sight, that the Belgae  remained concealed. They were there drawn up in order of battle: on the  right, the Atrebates; in the centre, the Veromandui; on the left, the  Nervii; these latter facing the escarpments of the Sambre. On the open  part, along the river, they had placed some posts of cavalry. (_See  Plate 10._)    Caesar, ignorant of the exact position where the Belgae were encamped,  directed his march towards the heights of Neuf-Mesnil. His cavalry  preceded him, but the order of march was different from that which had  been communicated to the Nervii by the deserters; as he approached the  enemy, he had, according to his custom, united six legions, and placed  the baggage in the tail of the column, under the guard of the two  legions recently raised, who closed the march.    The cavalry, slingers, and archers passed the Sambre and engaged the  cavalry of the enemy, who at one moment took refuge in the woods, and at  another resumed the offensive, nor were ever pursued beyond the open  ground. Meanwhile, the six legions debouched. Arrived on the place  chosen for the camp, they began to retrench, and shared the labour among  them. Some proceeded to dig the fosses, while others spread themselves  over the country in search of timber and turf. They had hardly begun  their work, when the Belgae, perceiving the first portion of the baggage  (which was the moment fixed for the attack), suddenly issue from the  forest with all their forces, in the order of battle they had adopted,  rush upon the cavalry and put it to rout, and run towards the Sambre  with such incredible rapidity that they seem to be everywhere at  once--at the edge of the wood, in the river, and in the midst of the  Roman troops; then, with the same celerity, climbing the hill, they rush  towards the camp, where the soldiers are at work at the retrenchments.  The Roman army is taken off its guard.    Caesar had to provide against everything at the same time. It was  necessary to raise the purple standard as the signal for hastening to  arms,[262] to sound the trumpets to recall the soldiers employed in the  works, to bring in those who were at a distance, form the lines,  harangue the troops, give the word of order.[263] In this critical  situation, the experience of the soldiers, acquired in so many combats,  and the presence of the lieutenants with each legion, helped to supply  the place of the general, and to enable each to take, by his own  impulse, the dispositions he thought best. The impetuosity of the enemy  is such that the soldiers have time neither to put on the ensigns,[264]  nor to take the covering from their bucklers, nor even to put on their  helmets. Each, abandoning his labours, runs to range himself in the  utmost haste under the first standard which presents itself.    The army, constrained by necessity, was drawn up on the slope of the  hill, much more in obedience to the nature of the ground and the  exigencies of the moment than according to military rules. The legions,  separated from one another by thick hedges, which intercepted their  view, could not lend each other mutual succour; they formed an irregular  and interrupted line: the 9th and 10th legions were placed on the left  of the camp, the 8th and 11th in the centre, the 7th and 12th on the  right. In this general confusion, in which it became as difficult to  carry succour to the points threatened as to obey one single command,  everything was ruled by accident.    Caesar, after taking the measures most urgent, rushes towards the troops  which chance presents first to him, takes them as he finds them in his  way, harangues them, and, when he comes to the 10th legion, he recalls  to its memory, in a few words, its ancient valour. As the enemy was  already within reach of the missiles, he orders the attack; then,  proceeding towards another point to encourage his troops, he finds them  already engaged.    The soldiers of the 9th and 10th legions throw the _pilum_, and fall,  sword in hand, upon the Atrebates, who, fatigued by their rapid advance,  out of breath, and pierced with wounds, are soon driven back from the  hill they have just climbed. These two legions, led no doubt by  Labienus, drive them into the Sambre, slay a great number, cross the  river at their heels, and pursue them up the slopes of the right bank.  The enemy, then thinking to take advantage of the commanding position,  form again, and renew the combat; but the Romans repulse them anew, and,  continuing their victorious march, take possession of the Gaulish camp.  In the centre, the 8th and 11th legions, attacked by the Veromandui, had  driven them back upon the banks of the Sambre, to the foot of the  heights, where the combat still continued.    While on the left and in the centre victory declared for the Romans, on  the right wing, the 7th and 12th legions were in danger of being  overwhelmed under the efforts of the whole army of the Nervii, composed  of 60,000 men. These intrepid warriors, led by their chief, Boduognatus,  had dashed across the Sambre in face of the escarpments of the left  bank; they had boldly climbed these, and thrown themselves, in close  rank, upon the two legions of the right wing. These legions were placed  in a position the more critical, as the victorious movements of the left  and centre, by stripping almost entirely of troops that part of the  field of battle, had left them without support. The Nervii take  advantage of these circumstances: some move towards the summit of the  heights to seize the camp, others outflank the two legions on the right  wing (_aperto latere_).    As chance would have it, at this same moment, the cavalry and  light-armed foot, who had been repulsed at the first attack, regained  pell-mell the camp; finding themselves unexpectedly in face of the  enemy, they are confounded, and take to flight again in another  direction. The valets of the army, who, from the Decuman gate and the  summit of the hill, had seen the Romans cross the river victoriously,  and had issued forth in hope of plunder, look back; perceiving the  Nervii in the camp, they fly precipitately. The tumult is further  increased by the cries of the baggage-drivers, who rush about in terror.  Among the auxiliaries in the Roman army, there was a body of Treviran  cavalry, who enjoyed among the Gauls a reputation for valour. When they  saw the camp invaded, the legions pressed and almost surrounded, the  valets, the cavalry, the slingers, the Numidians, separated, dispersed,  and flying on all sides, they believed that all was lost, took the road  for their own country, and proclaimed everywhere in their march that the  Roman army was destroyed.    Caesar had repaired from the left wing to the other points of the line.  When he arrived at the right wing, he had found the 7th and 12th legions  hotly engaged, the ensigns of the cohorts of the 12th legion collected  on the same point, the soldiers pressed together and mutually  embarrassing each other, all the centurions of the 4th cohort and the  standard-bearer killed; the standard lost; in the other cohorts most of  the centurions were either killed or wounded, and among the latter was  the primipilus Sextius Baculus, a man of rare bravery, who was destined  soon afterwards to save the legion of Galba in the Valais. The soldiers  who still resisted were exhausted, and those of the last ranks were  quitting the ranks to avoid the missiles; new troops of enemies  continually climbed the hill, some advancing to the front against the  Romans, the others turning them on the two wings. In this extreme  danger, Caesar judges that he can hope for succour only from himself:  having arrived without buckler, he seizes that of a legionary of the  last ranks and rushes to the first line; there,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45542"],[0,"Eighteen Months in the War Zone (#17)"],[1,"odd mixture of slush where the rain  beats in, and almost concrete mud where the trampling is worst. It has  been found necessary to put up a barrier by the \"counter,\" which is  made of empty packing-cases, but often, where the crowd is greatest, it  literally gets rooted up.    It is hard to say which is the more impressive sight: to arrive at  dawn and watch the shivering figures emerge from their tents, wrapped  in those fine new blankets of theirs, and cluster round our quarters,  held back by the stern arm of the military policeman until six o'clock  announces that we are prepared--or nominally so--for the rush; or to  watch them march off at night.    On Sunday there was a service. The men came running to the tents and  called for their favourite hymns. There were two oil lamps in the  centre, and someone secured a candle for my counter. Never can I  forget that scene--averted eyes, tense set mouths, and rugged faces  with the tears rolling down. Men who had never prayed before prayed  then, for they had the Unknown to face and they knew it. They lifted  the tent with their voices. Then, seeing I was the last English girl  many of them would ever set eyes on, a number came up to shake hands  and say good-bye and \"Thank you.\" Heaven knows for what!    Then we watched them march off. The camp gleamed white in the  moonlight. A crescent moon was over the silver sea, across which the  lights of England were plainly discernible.    By the flare of one great lamp they came up out of the dark, and,  company after company, like a phantom army, passed into the night.    It seemed like a dream. The receding tramp, tramp, tramp, the distant  sound of drums, the deserted tents. And only the lazy flap of the  canvas in the breeze remained to remind us of those heroes who have  gone up to \"carry on\" the great game.      _April 24th, Sick Ward 21._ What a very beautiful place hospital can  be, viewed from the standpoint of a patient! What matter that legs  are too weak to walk or heads to think? What matter that one's old  vulcanite pen feels like cast iron and runs on by itself?    Here are ministering angels who were once mere nurses. Here are friends  armed with many good things, with irises and kingcups from the fields  and carnations from the south--and newspapers. Yet, alas! the news is  not good. In spite of the Allied landing in Gallipoli that raises our  expectation of a speedy termination of things, the situation on the  Western front is bad. We are now falling back, and the Germans have  started an effective offensive at Ypres. It is dreadful to be able to  do nothing but listen all night long to the tramp of the newly arrived  troops, the sickening sound of the creeping \"stretcher cases,\" to  listen and to pray that all will be well.      _April 29th, Hardelot._ If one were asked to award the palm for good  work during the war, one would not hesitate to say that it was due to  those whose energies are devoted to the sick nurses.    There is none of the glory, none of the kudos, none of the  laurel-wreath interest that rewards those working amongst the men.    Just the steady, dullish daily duties of caring for and tending an  ever-changing stream of weary women! Yet what work can have more  far-reaching influence on the wounded and sick than the fact that the  nursing sisters are strong and fit to cope with their strenuous work?    Here, in the far-away forest of Hardelot, in the beautiful yet simple  house lent by the Duke of Argyll, that, with its distempered white  walls, old oak furniture and bright chintzes, seems a veritable bit of  England, the Red Cross have opened a home where worn-out nurses may  rest and recuperate.    It is like an oasis in this arid land. Lying in the woods on a bank of  luscious pine-needles and green moss, while the birds sing, it seems to  unaccustomed ears almost perfect; and the calm pines lift their stately  heads to the clear blue sky, swaying rhythmically, contentedly, in the  breeze. It is intoxicating.          CHAPTER VIII    May, 1915      _May 2nd._ This morning we attended Church Parade at the veterinary  camp hard by. The chaplain, who had brought out a recently formed brass  band, conducted the service in a large sand-pit from which most of the  horses had been removed to the sides. A few tents were dotted about, a  few sick animals still rolled in the sand as the men came on parade,  whilst a narrow path winding up to the dark pine woods above made us  feel for all the world like part of a Wild West Buffalo Bill show.    How the French peasants stared, open-mouthed, as the service proceeded,  wondering at our madness as we stood there in the sand-pit, with a  misty rain enveloping everything, singing at the top of our voices.  Many of the men recognised nurses who had been at clearing stations,  as we wended our way amongst the sick and wounded horses, the foals,  the \"prisoner\" animals, and glanced at the well-equipped but  insufficiently stocked dispensary.    The now famous Pre Catalan farm supplied us with tea, and I could not  help recalling how just a year ago we had been lounging in a punt  on the Ranelagh lake listening to a band--under somewhat different  circumstances! No doubt, somewhere at home, people are still punting  on the river, or enjoying a Sunday afternoon nap under the trees, or,  being energetically inclined, a round of golf or game of tennis, in  surroundings very similar to these. Only as we wandered home past the  famous Hill 243, through woods blue with hyacinths, fragrant with wild  orchids, primroses, kingcups, violets and every perfect flower one  could desire or dream of, and every perfect woodland perfume one could  experience, and every perfect colour the eye could imagine, the sound  of guns booming heavily and not very far away greeted us ominously.      _May 4th._ In an erstwhile hotel facing the sea the Secunderabad  General Hospital is situated. Not only are the wards often overcrowded,  but rows and rows of beds in the spacious hall, neighbouring villas and  auxiliary tents help to cope with the numbers. An all-pervading smell  of \"ghi,\" or melted butter, makes one think that Little Black Sambo and  all the tigers must have been put in the melting-pot.    Odd black figures, with unfathomable eyes and strange turbans, move  about their business stealthily, whilst in the little duty-room two  kindly theatre sisters dispense tea to any visitors who call on an  uneventful day between the fashionable hours of four and five.    Such is Hardelot. For, apart from the hospital, the Claims Commission,  the one shop, hotel and post office, every building is shut up and  barred.    A convoy of some fifty ambulances on the road tells its own tale.  Sauntering into the one and only shop, I secured the last bottle of ink  (which proved to be red), and betaking myself to the sand-dunes, set to  work on my diary. Across the vast, untrodden expanse of sand the sun  cast long shadows; little fishing boats, bathed in the glow, glided  slowly homewards.    Hardelot is said to be an inspiring place. Was not the \"Tale of Two  Cities\" penned here? Was not many an historical drama enacted, verse  inspired, music created?     [Illustration: HOSPITAL SHIPS IN THE HARBOUR]    Yet France in war-time to anyone incapacitated is wellnigh unbearable.    Again and again unpleasant scenes come up (and when humour flags is  life worth living?). The subaltern so unnerved by the sight of his  batman (only slightly hit) who was drowned in the mud, that he could  do nothing but reiterate, with staring eyes, \"And, for all I know,  he is there still.\" Tales of healthy bits of land where, if you ask  your way to a certain reserve trench, the direction will be: \"First on  the left, and past the dead Frenchman on the ant-heap,\" half-humorous  reminiscences of trench-digging where other things--no need to  specify--besides caps and boots are turned up, haunt one incessantly,  and Morpheus refuses to be wooed.    All day long one notes the veering wind with beating heart, conscious  that the prevailing west wind is all-propitious to the German's latest  invention of the Devil, the poison-gas; conscious of the long nights in  which one has lain awake as the sound of the receding sea was replaced  by the ghastly choking of the ward of gassed cases opposite (a sound  comparable only to a roomful of panting dogs), or the cough of the man  dying with a bullet through his lungs.      _May 14th._ At home there are strikes and rumours of strikes,  instigated, no doubt, by German emissaries, but none the less shameful  for that; and one and all, as the men come down from that \"hell with  the lid off,\" where, inch by inch, the Germans are regaining that for  which so many lives were sacrificed, their cry is for ammunition.    \"We could have held our lines but for the lack of ammunition of the  _right kind_,\" they say--for it seems that ordinary shells are useless  when pitted against high explosives and gas.    No one who has not heard that appeal direct from dying lips (for dying  men don't lie) can know how great is the longing to tell about it at  home--to let the slackers know that for each shell not forthcoming  ten valuable lives are lost, ten homes needlessly bereaved. It is  intolerably unjust that the man who refuses to do his duty out here is  promptly shot, whilst the man who strikes at home is merely bribed with  offers of higher wages.    After all, it is a war not only of men, but of arms and ammunition, and  it lies in the hands of those at home as much as those out here to see  the thing through.      _May 16th._ At a certain canteen recently a splendid, strapping fellow  has been much in evidence. A fine all-round sportsman of good breeding,  always ready to lend a hand where required, he made himself beloved by  men and canteen-workers alike. In particular he endeared himself to the  man in charge of the canteen, to whom he would talk of his wife and"]]]
