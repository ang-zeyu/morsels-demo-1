One of the  Penderels was at the White Ladies'. He let the fugitives in, tired,  exhausted, and hungry as they were, with the fatigue of marching nearly  all the night. They sent immediately for Richard Penderel, who lived  in a farm house nearby, and for another brother, who was at Boscobel.  They took the king into an inner room, and immediately commenced the  work of effectually disguising him.    They gave him clothes belonging to some of the servants of the family,  and destroyed his own. The king had about his person a watch and some  costly decorations, such as orders of knighthood set in jewels, which  would betray his rank if found in his possession. These the king  distributed among his friends, intrusting them to the charge of such  as he judged most likely to effect their escape. They then cut off his  hair short all over, thus making him a Roundhead instead of a Cavalier.  They rubbed soot from the fire place over his face, to change the  expression of his features and complexion. They gave him thus, in all  respects, as nearly as possible, the guise of a squalid peasant and  laborer of the humblest class, accustomed to the privations and to the  habits of poverty.    In the mean time Richard Penderel arrived. Perhaps an intimation had  been given him of the wishes of the king to be relieved of his company  of followers; at any rate, he urged the whole retinue, as soon as he  came to the house to press forward without any delay, as there was a  detachment of Cromwell's forces, he said, at three miles' distance,  who might be expected at any moment to come in pursuit of them Giffard  brought Penderel then into the inner room to which the king had retired.  \"This is the king,\" said he. \"I commit him to your charge. Take care  of him.\"    Richard undertook the trust. He told the king that he must immediately  leave that place, and he conducted him secretly, all disguised as he  was, out of a postern door, without making known his design to any of  his followers, except the two or three who were in immediate attendance  upon him. He led him away about half a mile into a wood, and, concealing  him there, left him alone, saying he would go and see what intelligence  he could obtain, and presently return again. The troop of followers,  in the mean time, from whom the king had been so desirous to get free,  when they found that he was gone, mounted their horses and rode away,  to escape the danger with which Richard had threatened them. But, alas  for the unhappy fugitives, they did not get far in their flight; they  were overtaken, attacked, conquered, captured, and treated as traitors.  Some were shot, one was beheaded, and others were shut up in prisons,  where they pined in hopeless privation and suffering for many years.  There was, however, one of the king's followers who did not go away  with the rest. It was Lord Wilmot, an influential nobleman, who  concealed himself in the vicinity, and kept near the king in all his  subsequent wanderings.    But we must return to the king in the wood. It was about sunrise when  he was left there, the morning after the battle. It rained. The king  tried in vain to find a shelter under the trees of the forest. The  trees themselves were soon thoroughly saturated, and they received the  driving rain from the skies only to let the water fall in heavier drops  upon the poor fugitive's defenseless head. Richard borrowed a blanket  at a cottage near, thinking that it would afford some protection, and  brought it to his charge. The king folded it up to make a cushion to  sit upon; for, worn out as he was with hard fighting all the day before,  and hard riding all the night, he could not stand; so he chose to use  his blanket as a protection from the wet ground beneath him, and to  take the rain upon his head as it fell.    Richard sent a peasant's wife to him presently with some food. Charles,  who never had any great respect for the female sex, was alarmed to  find that a woman had been entrusted with such a secret.    \"My good woman,\" said he, \"can you be faithful to a distressed  Cavalier?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said she; \"I will die rather than betray you.\"    Charles had, in fact, no occasion to fear. Woman is, indeed,  communicative and confiding, and often, in unguarded hours, reveals  indiscreetly what it would have been better to have withheld; but in  all cases where real and important trusts are committed to her keeping,  there is no human fidelity which can be more safely relied upon than  hers.    Charles remained in the wood all the day, exposed to the pelting of  the storm. There was a road in sight, a sort of by-way leading across  the country, and the monarch beguiled the weary hours as well as he  could by watching this road from under the trees, to see if any soldiers  came along. There was one troop that appeared, but it passed directly  by, marching heavily through the mud and rain, the men intent,  apparently, only on reaching their journey's end. When night came on,  Richard Penderel returned, approaching cautiously, and, finding all  safe, took the king into the house with him. They brought him to the  fire, changed and dried his clothes, and gave him supper. The homeless  monarch once more enjoyed the luxuries of warmth and shelter.    During all the day, while he had been alone in the wood, he had been  revolving in his mind the strange circumstances of his situation,  vainly endeavoring, for many hours, to realize what seemed at first  like a dreadful dream. Could it be really true that he, the monarch  of three kingdoms, so recently at the head of a victorious army, and  surrounded by generals and officers of state, was now a friendless and  solitary fugitive, without even a place to hide his head from the cold  autumnal storm? It seemed at first a dream; but it soon became a  reality, and he began to ponder, in every form, the question what he  should do. He looked east, west, north, and south, but could not see,  in any quarter, any hope of succor, or any reasonable prospect of  escape. He, however, arrived at the conclusion, before night came on,  that it would be, on the whole, the best plan for him to attempt to  escape into Wales.    He was very near the frontier of that country. There was no difficulty  to be apprehended on the road thither, excepting in the crossing of  the Severn, which, as has already been remarked, flows from north to  south not far from the line of the frontier. He thought, too, that if  he could once succeed in getting into Wales, he could find secure  retreats among the mountains there until he should be able to make his  way to some sea-port on the coast trading with France, and so find his  way back across the Channel. He proposed this plan to Richard in the  evening, and asked him to accompany him as his guide. Richard readily  consented, and the arrangements for the journey were made. They adjusted  the king's dress again to complete his disguise, and Richard gave him  a bill-hook--a sort of woodman's tool--to carry in his hand. It was  agreed, also, that his name should be Will Jones so far as there should  be any necessity for designating him by a name in the progress of the  journey.    They set out at nine o'clock that same night, in the darkness and rain.  They wished to get to Madely, a town near the river, before the morning.  Richard knew a Mr. Woolf there, a friend of the Royalist cause, who  he thought would shelter them, and aid them in getting across the  river. They went on very well for some time, until they came to a  stream, a branch of the Severn, where there was a bridge, and on the  other side a mill. The miller happened to be watching that night at  his door. At such times everybody is on the alert, suspecting mischief  or danger in every unusual sight or sound.    Hearing the footsteps, he called out, \"Who goes there?\"    \"Neighbors,\" replied Richard. The king was silent. He had been  previously charged by Richard not to speak, except when it could not  possibly be avoided, as he had not the accent of the country.    \"Stop, then,\" said the miller, \"if you be neighbors.\" The travelers  only pressed forward the faster for this challenge. \"Stop!\" repeated  the miller, \"if you be neighbors, or I will knock you down;\" and he  ran out in pursuit of them, armed apparently with the means of executing  his threat. Richard fled, the king closely following him. They turned  into a lane, and ran a long distance, the way being in many places so  dark that the king, in following Richard, was guided only by the sound  of his footsteps, and the creaking of the leather dress which such  peasants were accustomed in those days to wear. They crept along,  however, as silently, and yet as rapidly as possible, until at length  Richard turned suddenly aside, leaped over a sort of gap in the hedge,  and crouched down in the trench on the other side. Here they remained  for some time, listening to ascertain whether they were pursued. When  they found that all was still, they crept forth from their hiding  places, regained the road, and went on their way.    At length they arrived at the town. Richard left the king concealed  in an obscure corner of the street, while he went to the house of Mr.  Woolf to see if he could obtain admission. All was dark and still. He  knocked till he had aroused some of the family, and finally brought  Mr. Woolf to the door.    He told Mr. Woolf that he came to ask shelter for a gentleman who was  wishing to get into Wales, and who could not safely travel by day. Mr.  Woolf hesitated, and began to ask for further information in respect  to the stranger. Richard said that he was an officer who had made his  escape from the battle of Worcester, \"Then,\" said Mr. Woolf, \"I should  hazard my life by concealing him, which I should not be willing to do  for any body, unless it were the king.\" Richard then told him that it  _was_ his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6675"],[0,"The Loss of the S. S. Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#17)"],[1,"smacks to  which they belong and row away for miles; sometimes even being lost  and wandering about among icebergs, and even not being found again. In  these circumstances, rockets are part of a fishing smack's equipment,  and are sent up to indicate to the small boats how to return. Is it  conceivable that the Californian thought our rockets were such  signals, and therefore paid no attention to them?    Incidentally, this engineer did not hesitate to add that it is  doubtful if a big liner would stop to help a small fishing-boat  sending off distress signals, or even would turn about to help one  which she herself had cut down as it lay in her path without a light.  He was strong in his affirmation that such things were commonly known  to all officers in the trans-Atlantic service.    With regard to the other vessels in wireless communication, the Mount  Temple was the only one near enough from the point of distance to have  arrived in time to be of help, but between her and the Titanic lay the  enormous ice-floe, and icebergs were near her in addition.    The seven ships which caught the message started at once to her help  but were all stopped on the way (except the Birma) by the Carpathia's  wireless announcing the fate of the Titanic and the people aboard her.  The message must have affected the captains of these ships very  deeply: they would understand far better than the travelling public  what it meant to lose such a beautiful ship on her first voyage.    The only thing now left to be done was to get the lifeboats away as  quickly as possible, and to this task the other officers were in the  meantime devoting all their endeavours. Mr. Lightoller sent away boat  after boat: in one he had put twenty-four women and children, in  another thirty, in another thirty-five; and then, running short of  seamen to man the boats he sent Major Peuchen, an expert yachtsman, in  the next, to help with its navigation. By the time these had been  filled, he had difficulty in finding women for the fifth and sixth  boats for the reasons already stated. All this time the passengers  remained--to use his own expression--\"as quiet as if in church.\" To  man and supervise the loading of six boats must have taken him nearly  up to the time of the Titanic's sinking, taking an average of some  twenty minutes to a boat. Still at work to the end, he remained on the  ship till she sank and went down with her. His evidence before the  United States Committee was as follows: \"Did you leave the ship?\" \"No,  sir.\" \"Did the ship leave you?\" \"Yes, sir.\"    It was a piece of work well and cleanly done, and his escape from the  ship, one of the most wonderful of all, seems almost a reward for his  devotion to duty.    Captain Smith, Officers Wilde and Murdock were similarly engaged in  other parts of the ship, urging women to get in the boats, in some  cases directing junior officers to go down in some of them,--Officers  Pitman, Boxhall, and Lowe were sent in this way,--in others placing  members of the crew in charge. As the boats were lowered, orders were  shouted to them where to make for: some were told to stand by and wait  for further instructions, others to row for the light of the  disappearing steamer.    It is a pitiful thing to recall the effects of sending down the first  boats half full. In some cases men in the company of their wives had  actually taken seats in the boats--young men, married only a few weeks  and on their wedding trip--and had done so only because no more women  could then be found; but the strict interpretation by the particular  officer in charge there of the rule of \"Women and children only,\"  compelled them to get out again. Some of these boats were lowered and  reached the Carpathia with many vacant seats. The anguish of the young  wives in such circumstances can only be imagined. In other parts of  the ship, however, a different interpretation was placed on the rule,  and men were allowed and even invited by officers to get in--not only  to form part of the crew, but even as passengers. This, of course, in  the first boats and when no more women could be found.    The varied understanding of this rule was a frequent subject of  discussion on the Carpathia--in fact, the rule itself was debated with  much heart-searching. There were not wanting many who doubted the  justice of its rigid enforcement, who could not think it well that a  husband should be separated from his wife and family, leaving them  penniless, or a young bridegroom from his wife of a few short weeks,  while ladies with few relatives, with no one dependent upon them, and  few responsibilities of any kind, were saved. It was mostly these  ladies who pressed this view, and even men seemed to think there was a  good deal to be said for it. Perhaps there is, theoretically, but it  would be impossible, I think, in practice. To quote Mr. Lightoller  again in his evidence before the United States Senate Committee,--when  asked if it was a rule of the sea that women and children be saved  first, he replied, \"No, it is a rule of human nature.\" That is no  doubt the real reason for its existence.    But the selective process of circumstances brought about results that  were very bitter to some. It was heartrending for ladies who had lost  all they held dearest in the world to hear that in one boat was a  stoker picked up out of the sea so drunk that he stood up and  brandished his arms about, and had to be thrown down by ladies and sat  upon to keep him quiet. If comparisons can be drawn, it did seem  better that an educated, refined man should be saved than one who had  flown to drink as his refuge in time of danger.    These discussions turned sometimes to the old enquiry--\"What is the  purpose of all this? Why the disaster? Why this man saved and that man  lost? Who has arranged that my husband should live a few short happy  years in the world, and the happiest days in those years with me these  last few weeks, and then be taken from me?\" I heard no one attribute  all this to a Divine Power who ordains and arranges the lives of men,  and as part of a definite scheme sends such calamity and misery in  order to purify, to teach, to spiritualize. I do not say there were  not people who thought and said they saw Divine Wisdom in it all,--so  inscrutable that we in our ignorance saw it not; but I did not hear it  expressed, and this book is intended to be no more than a partial  chronicle of the many different experiences and convictions.    There were those, on the other hand, who did not fail to say  emphatically that indifference to the rights and feelings of others,  blindness to duty towards our fellow men and women, was in the last  analysis the cause of most of the human misery in the world. And it  should undoubtedly appeal more to our sense of justice to attribute  these things to our own lack of consideration for others than to shift  the responsibility on to a Power whom we first postulate as being  All-wise and All-loving.    All the boats were lowered and sent away by about 2 A.M., and by this  time the ship was very low in the water, the forecastle deck  completely submerged, and the sea creeping steadily up to the bridge  and probably only a few yards away.    No one on the ship can have had any doubt now as to her ultimate fate,  and yet the fifteen hundred passengers and crew on board made no  demonstration, and not a sound came from them as they stood quietly on  the decks or went about their duties below. It seems incredible, and  yet if it was a continuation of the same feeling that existed on deck  before the boats left,--and I have no doubt it was,--the explanation  is straightforward and reasonable in its simplicity. An attempt is  made in the last chapter to show why the attitude of the crowd was so  quietly courageous. There are accounts which picture excited crowds  running about the deck in terror, fighting and struggling, but two of  the most accurate observers, Colonel Gracie and Mr. Lightoller, affirm  that this was not so, that absolute order and quietness prevailed. The  band still played to cheer the hearts of all near; the engineers and  their crew--I have never heard any one speak of a single engineer  being seen on deck--still worked at the electric light engines, far  away below, keeping them going until no human being could do so a  second longer, right until the ship tilted on end and the engines  broke loose and fell down. The light failed then only because the  engines were no longer there to produce light, not because the men who  worked them were not standing by them to do their duty. To be down in  the bowels of the ship, far away from the deck where at any rate there  was a chance of a dive and a swim and a possible rescue; to know that  when the ship went--as they knew it must soon--there could be no  possible hope of climbing up in time to reach the sea; to know all  these things and yet to keep the engines going that the decks might be  lighted to the last moment, required sublime courage.    But this courage is required of every engineer and it is not called by  that name: it is called \"duty.\" To stand by his engines to the last  possible moment is his duty. There could be no better example of the  supremest courage being but duty well done than to remember the  engineers of the Titanic still at work as she heeled over and flung  them with their engines down the length of the ship. The simple  statement that the lights kept on to the last is really their epitaph,  but Lowell's words would seem to apply to them with peculiar force--        \"The longer on this earth we live    And weigh the various qualities of men--    The more we feel the high, stern-featured beauty    Of plain devotedness to duty.    Steadfast and still, nor paid with mortal praise,    But finding amplest recompense    For life's ungarlanded expense    In work done squarely and unwasted days.\"    For some time before she"]]]
