When any man is departed his lyfe, all his niere friendes and kindesfolke,  throwing dirte vpon their heades, go wieping and wailing rounde about the  citie vntle the Corps be buried. And in the meane season they neyther  bathe, ne drincke wine, or eate any meate, but that that is most base and  vile, ne weare any apparell that is gorgeous or faire. They haue thre  sortes of Sepulchres, Sumptuous, meane, and basse. In the firste sorte they  bestowe a talente of siluer. Aboute the seconde, twenty Markes, and aboute  the thirde litle or nothing. There be certaine Pheretrers, [Footnote:  Query, _ferretrers_, carriers.] whose facultie it is to sette forthe  burialles, whiche learne it of their fathers and teache it their children.  These when a funeral happeneth, make vnto him that is doer for the deade,  an estimate of the exequies in writing, whiche the doer may at his pleasure  enlarge or make lesse. When thei are ones fallen at appoyncte, the bodye is  deliuered to the Pheretrer to bee enterred accordyng to the rate that they  agreed vpon. Then the bodie beyng laied foorthe, commeth the Phereters  chiefe cutter, and he appoincteth his vndrecutter a place on the side  haulfe of the paunche, wher to make incision, and how large. Then he with a  sharpe stone (whiche of the country fro whence it commeth, they call  Ethiopicus) openeth the left side as farre as the lawe permitteth. And  streight with all spiede ronneth his way from the company standing by,  which curse him and reuile him and throwe many stones aftre him. For they  thincke there yet remaineth a certeine hatred due vnto him that woundeth  the body of their frinde. Those that are the seasoners and embalmers of the  body (whome they calle poulderers) they haue in greate honour and  estimacion, for that they haue familiarite with the priestes, and entre the  temples together with them. The bodye nowe commen to their handes, one  emong all (the reste standing by) vnlaceth the entrailes, and draweth them  out at the foresaid incision, all sauing the kidneis, and the harte. These  entrailes are taken by another at his hande, and wasshed in wine of the  country Phenicea, wherin are enfused many soote [Footnote: Sweet. \"They  dauncen deftly, and singen soote, / In their merriment.\" _Spenser's  Hobbinol's Dittie_, _Sheph. Kal._, Apr. iii.] odours and drugges. Then  enoincte they the whole bodye ouer, firste with Cedre and then with other  oynctementes, xxx. daies and aboue. Then do thei ceare it ouer with Mirrhe  and Cinamome and suche other thinges as wil not onely preserue it to  continuaunce, but also make it soote smelling. The Corps thus being  trimmed, is deliuered to the kindesfolke of the deade, euery parte of it  kepte so whole (not an heare of his browes or eye liddes being hurte) that  it raither lieth like one being in sliepe then like a dead corpse. Before  the body be enterred, the kindesfolke of the deade signifie to the iudges,  and the friendes of this passed, the day of the burial. Whiche (according  to the maner then vsed) thei terme the deades passaige ouer the mere. The  maner wherof is this.    The iudges, aboue xl. in nomber, sittinge on the farther side of the mere,  on a compassed benche wheling haulfe rounds and the people standing about  them: The bodie is put into a litle boate made for the nones, and drawen  ouer to the iudges by a chorde. The body then standing before the iudges in  the sight of the people, before it be cofred, if ther be any manne that  haue aught to saye against the dead, he is permitted by the lawe. Yf any be  proued to haue liued euyll, the iudges geue sentence that the bodye shall  not be buried. And who so is founde vniustelye to haue accused, suffreth  greate punyshemente therfore. When no manne wyll accuse, or he that accused  is knowen to haue slaunderously done it, the kinsfolke endyng their  mournyng: tourne them selues now to the prayse of the dead, nothing aftre  the maner of the Grecians, for that the Egiptians thinke themselues all to  be gentlemen alike. But beginnyng at his childehode, in the whiche thei  reherse his bringing vp, nourtering and scholyng, thei passe to his mannes  age, their commending his godlines, his iustice, his temperaunce, and the  residewe of his vertues. And calling vpon the vndre earthe, goddes, they  beseche them to place him emonge the godlye and good. To the which wordes  all the whole multitude crieth Amen: showtyng oute, and magnifieng the  glorye of the deade, as thoughe they shoulde be with the vnder earth  goddes, among the blessed for euer. This done euery man burieth his dead,  some in Sepulchres made for the purpose, and other that haue no suche  preparacion, in their strongest wall at home in their house, setting vp the  cofre ther tabernacle wyse. But they that for some offence, or debte of  enterest, or suche like, are denied their bewriall, are sette vp at home  without any cofre, vntle their successours growyng to abilite canne  dischardge their debtes and offences, and honourably bewrie them.    There is a maner emong them, sometyme to borowe money vpon their parentes  corpses, deliueryng the bodies to the creditours in pledge. And who so  redemeth theim not, ronneth into vtter infamie, and is at his death, denied  his bewriall. A manne (not altogether causeles) mighte merueile, that thei  could not be contente to constitute lawes for the framyng of the maners of  those that are onliue, but also put ordre for the exequies, and Hearses of  the deade. But the cause why thei bent them selues so much hervnto, was for  that thei thought ther was no better waie possible, to driue men to  honestie of life. The Grekes, which haue set furthe so many thynges in  fained tales, and fables of Poetes (farre aboue credite) concernyng the  rewarde of the good, and punishment of the euill: could not with all their  deuices, drawe men to vertue, and withdrawe them from vices. But rather  contrariwise, haue with them that be leudely disposed: broughte all  together in contempte and derision. But emong the Egiptians, the  punishemente due vnto the wicked and lewed, and the praise of the godlie  and good, not heard by tales of a tubbe, [Footnote: Swift took the title of  his well-known book from this old expression. It appears in Bale's \"Comedye  Concerning Three Laws,\" compiled in 1538: \"Ye say they follow your law, /  And vary not a shaw, / Which is a tale of a tub.\"] but sene daiely at the  eye: putteth both partes in remembraunce what behoueth in this life, and  what fame and opinion thei shall leaue of them selues, to their posteritie.  And hervppon it riseth, that euery man gladly emong them, ensueth good  ordre of life. And to make an ende of Thegiptians, me siemeth those Lawes  are of very righte to be compted the beste, whiche regarde not so muche to  make the people riche, as to aduance them to honestie and wisedome, where  riches of necessitie must folowe.      ¶ The vj.

Among  all these forms, as stated by different observers, the substance of  the Iroquois law of hospitality is plainly found, namely: If a man  entered an Indian house, whether a villager, a tribesman, or a  stranger, and at whatever hour of the day, it was the duty of the  women of the house to set food before him. An omission to do this  would have been a discourtesy amounting to an affront. If hungry, he  ate, if not hungry, courtesy required that he should taste the food  and thank the giver. It is seen to have been a usage running through  three ethnic conditions of the Indian race, becoming stronger as the  means of subsistence increased in variety and amount, and attaining  its highest development among the Village Indians in the Middle  Status of barbarism. It was an active, well-established custom of  Indian society, practiced among themselves and among strangers from  other tribes, and very naturally extended to Europeans when they  made their first appearance among them. Considering the number of  the Spaniards often in military companies, and another fact which  the aborigines were quick to notice, namely, that a white man  consumed and wasted five times as much as an Indian required, their  hospitality in many cases must have been grievously overtaxed.  [Footnote: \"The appetite of the Spaniards appeared to the American  inhabitants voracious; and they affirmed that one Spaniard devoured  more food in a day than was sufficient for ten Americans.\"--  (Robertson's History of America, Lond. ed., 1856, i, p. 72.)]    Attention has been called to this law of hospitality, and to its  universality, for two reasons: firstly, because it implies the  existence of common stores, which supplied the means for its practice;  and secondly, because, wherever found, it implies communistic living  in large households. It must be evident that this hospitality could  not have been habitually practiced by the Iroquois and other  northern tribes, and much less by the Village Indians of Mexico,  Central and South America, with such uniformity, if the custom in  each case had depended upon the voluntary contributions of single  families. In that event it would have failed oftener than it would  have succeeded. The law of hospitality, as administered by the  American aborigines, indicates a plan of life among them which has  not been carefully studied, nor have its effects been fully  appreciated. Its explanation must be sought in the ownership of  lands in common, the distribution of their products to households  consisting of a number of families, and the practice of communism in  living in the household. Common stores for large households, and  possibly for the village, with which to maintain village hospitality,  are necessary to explain the custom. It could have been maintained  on such a basis, and it is difficult to see how it could have been  maintained on any other. The common and substantially universal  practice of this custom, among the American Indian Tribes, at the  period of their discovery, among whom the procurement of subsistence  was their vital need, must be regarded as evidence of a generous  disposition, and as exhibiting a trait of character highly  creditable to the race.

We are now to consider the remaining usages and customs named in the  last chapter.      THEIR COMMUNISM IN LIVING.    Communism in living had its origin in the necessities of the family,  which, prior to the Later Period of barbarism, was too weak an  organization to face alone the struggle of life. In savagery and in  the Older and the Middle Period of barbarism the family was in the  syndyasmian or pairing form into which it had passed from a previous  lower form. [Footnote: Ancient Society, p. 459.]    Wherever the gentile organization prevailed, several families,  related by kin, united as a rule in a common household and made a  common stock of the provisions acquired by fishing and hunting, and  by the cultivation of maize and plants. They erected joint tenement  houses large enough to accommodate several families, so that,  instead of a single family in the exclusive occupation of a single  house, large households as a rule existed in all parts of America in  the aboriginal period. This community of provisions was limited to  the household; but a final equalization of the means of subsistence  was in some measure affected by the law of hospitality. To a very  great extent communism in living was a necessary result of the  condition of the Indian tribes. It entered into their plan of life  and determined the character of their houses. In effect it was a  union of effort to procure subsistence, which was the vital and  commanding concern of life. The desire for individual accumulation  had not been aroused in their minds to any sensible extent. It is  made evident by a comparison of the conditions of barbarous tribes  on different continents that communism has widely prevailed among  them, and that the influence of this ancient practice had not  entirely disappeared among the more advanced tribes when  civilization finally appeared. The common meal-bin of the ancient  and the common tables of the later Greeks seem to be survivals of an  older communism in living. This practice, though never investigated  as a specialty, may be shown by the known customs of a number of  Indian tribes, and may be confirmed by an examination of the plans  of their houses.    Our first illustration will be taken from the usages of the Iroquois.  In their villages they constructed houses, consisting of frames of  poles covered with bark, thirty, fifty, eighty, and a hundred feet  in length, with a passage-way through the center, a door at each end,  and with the interior partitioned off at intervals of about seven  feet. Each apartment or stall thus formed was open for its entire  width upon the passage-way. These houses would accommodate five, ten,  and twenty families, according to the number of apartments, one  being usually allotted to a family. Each household was made up on  the principle of kin. The married women, usually sisters, own or  collateral, were of the same gens or clan, the symbol or totem of  which was often painted upon the house, while their husbands and  the wives of their sons belong to several other gentes. The  children were of the gens of their mother. While husband and  wife belonged to different gentes, the preponderating number  in each household would be of the same gens, namely, that of  their mothers. As a rule the sons brought home their wives, and  in some cases the husbands of the daughters were admitted to  the maternal house. Thus each household was composed of a  mixture of persons of different gentes; but this would not  prevent the numerical ascendency of the particular gens to  whom the house belonged. In a village of one hundred and twenty  houses, as the Seneca village of Tiotohatton described by  Mr. Greenbalgh i n 1677, there would be several such houses  belonging to each gens. It presented a general picture of Indian  life in all parts of America at the epoch of European discovery.  [Footnote: Documentary History of New York, i, 13.]    Whatever was gained by any member of the household on hunting or  fishing expeditions, or was raised by cultivation, was made a common  stock. Within the house they lived from common stores. Each house  had several fires, usually one for each four apartments, which was  placed in the middle of the passage-way and without a chimney. Every  household was organized under a matron who supervised its domestic  economy. After the single daily meal was cooked at the several fires  the matron was summoned, and it was her duty to divide the food,  from the kettle, to the several families according to their  respective needs. What remained was placed in the custody of another  person until it was required by the matron."]]]
