The tears actually came into their eyes when I  talked of the happiness it would be to see a little church and school in  their midst; and the almost invariable remark was, \"Ah, but it'll be a  far day first.\" And so I fear it will--a very far day; but I have often  heard it said, that if you propose one definite object to yourself as  the serious purpose of your life, you will accomplish it some day.  Well, the purpose of my life henceforward is to raise money somehow or  somewhere to build a little wooden school-room (licensed for service, to  be held whenever a missionary clergyman comes by), and to pay the salary  of a schoolmaster and mistress, so that the poor Cockatoo need not  be charged more than threepence a week for each child. The Board of  Education will give a third of the sum required, when two-thirds have  been already raised; but it is difficult to collect subscriptions, or  indeed to induce the squatters to listen to any plan for improving the  condition of the small farmers, and every year which slips away and  leaves these swarms of children in ignorance adds to the difficulty of  training them. [Note: Since this was written, a school-house, also used  as a church, has been built in this district by private subscription  and Government aid. A clergyman, who lives some twenty-five miles away,  rides over and holds service once a month.]          Letter XVI: A sailing excursion on Lake Coleridge.      Lake Coleridge, February 1867. A violent storm of wind and rain from the  south-west keeps us all indoors to-day, and gives me time to write  my letter for the Panama mail, which will be made up to-morrow. The  post-office is ten miles off, and rejoices in the appropriate name of  \"Wind-whistle;\" it stands at the mouth of a deep mountain gorge, and  there never was such a temple of the winds.    This bad weather comes after a long spell of lovely bright summer days,  and is very welcome to fill up the failing creeks in the lower ranges  of hills. I must tell you how much we have been enjoying our visit here.  F---- knows this part of the country well, but it is quite new to me,  and a great contrast to the other scenery I have described to you We had  long talked of paying Mr. C. H---- a visit at his bachelor cottage on  his station far back among the high ranges of hills, but no time was  fixed, so I was rather taken by surprise when last week he drove up to  Broomielaw in a light American waggon with a pair of stout horses, and  announced that he had come to take us to his place next day. There was  no reason against this plan, and we agreed at once; the next morning  saw us on the road, after an early breakfast. We had to drive about  thirty-five miles round, whereas it would have been only twenty miles  riding across the hills; but our kind host thought that it would be much  more comfortable for me to be able to take a carpet-bag in the carriage  instead of the usual system of saddle-bags one is obliged to adopt  travelling on horseback. We made our first stage at the ever-hospitable  station of the C----'s, on the Horarata, but we could not remain to  luncheon, as they wished, having to push on further; and, as it turned  out, it was most fortunate we took advantage of the first part of the  day to get over the ground between us and our destination, for the  gentle breeze which had been blowing since we started gradually  freshened into a tremendous \"nor'-wester,\" right in our teeth all the  rest of our way. The poor horses bent their heads as low as possible  and pulled bravely at their collars, up hill the whole time. Among the  mountains the wind rushed with redoubled fury down the narrow gorges,  and became icily cold as we neared the snowy ranges. It was impossible  to see the hills for the thick mist, though I knew we must have a  magnificent view before us. We took refuge for an hour just to rest the  horses, at Windwhistle, and I certainly expected the house to come down  whilst we were there. I can hardly tell you anything of the rest of the  drive, for I was really frightened at my first experience of a \"howling  nor'-wester\" out of doors, and Mr. H---- made me sit down at the bottom  of the carriage and heaped over me all the cloaks and shawls we had  brought. It was delightful to find ourselves under shelter at last in  a pretty bright snug room, with lots of books and arm-chairs, and a  blazing fire; _this_, you must remember, in midsummer.    The next morning was perfectly calm, and the lake as serene as if no  storm had been dashing its water in huge breakers against the beach  only a few hours before. The view from the sitting-room was lovely: just  beneath the window there was a little lawn, as green as possible from  the spray with which the lake had washed it yesterday; beyond this a low  hedge, an open meadow, a fringe of white pebbly beach, and then a wide  expanse of water within one little wooded island, and shut in gradually  from our view by spurs of hills running down to the shore, sometimes in  bold steep cliffs, and again in gentle declivities, with little strips  of bush or scrub growing in the steep gullies between them. The lake  extends some way beyond where we lose sight of it, being twelve miles  long and four miles broad. A few yards from the beach it is over six  hundred feet deep. Nothing but a painting could give you any idea of the  blue of sky and water that morning; the violent wind of yesterday seemed  to have blown every cloud below the horizon, for I could not see the  least white film anywhere. Behind the lower hills which surround the  lake rises a splendid snowy range; altogether, you cannot imagine a more  enchanting prospect than the one I stood and looked at; it made me think  of Miss Procter's lines--                   \"My eyes grow dim,            As still I gaze and gaze       Upon that mountain pass,            That leads--or so it seems--     To some far happy land            Known in a world of dreams.\"    All this time, whilst I was looking out of the window in most unusual  idleness, Mr. H---- and F---- were making constant journeys between the  boat-house and the store-room, and at last I was entreated to go and put  on my hat. While doing this I heard cupboards being opened, and a great  bustle; so when I reached the shore I was not so much surprised as they  expected, to see in the pretty little sailing-boat (which was moored to  a primitive sort of jetty made out of a broken old punt) the materials  for at least two substantial meals, in case of being kept out by a  sudden head-wind. I was especially glad to notice a little kettle among  the _impedimenta_, and there were cloaks and wraps of all kinds to  provide against the worst. Four gentlemen and I made up the crew and  passengers, and a very merry set we were, behaving extremely like  children out for a holiday. The wind was a trifle light for sailing, so  the gentlemen pulled, but very lazily and not at all in good \"form,\"  as the object of each oarsman seemed to be to do as little work as  possible. However, we got on somehow, a light puff helping us now and  then, but our progress was hardly perceptible. I had been for a long  time gazing down into the clear blue depth of water, every now and then  seeing a flash of the white sand shining at the bottom, when I was half  startled by our host standing suddenly up in the bow of the boat;  and then I found that we were a couple of miles away from our  starting-point, and that we had turned a corner formed by a steep spur,  and were running right into what appeared a grove of rata-trees growing  at the water's edge. The rata only grows in the hills and near water; it  is a species of broad-leaf myrtle, with a flower exactly like a myrtle  in character, but of a brilliant deep scarlet colour, and twice as  large.    When the bowsprit touched the rata-branches, which drooped like a  curtain into the water, Mr. H---- made a signal to lower the mast, and  parting the thick, blossom-covered foliage before us, with both hands,  the way the boat had on her sent us gently through the screen of scarlet  flowers and glossy green leaves into such a lovely fairy cove! Before us  was a little white beach of fine sparkling sand, against which the water  broke in tiny wavelets, and all around a perfect bower of every variety  of fern and moss, kept green by streams no thicker than a silver thread  trickling down here and there with a subdued tinkling sound. We all  sat quite silent, the boat kept back just inside the entrance by the  steersman holding on to a branch. It was a sudden contrast from the  sparkling sunshine and brightness outside, all life and colour and  warmth, to the tender, green, profound shade and quiet in this \"Mossy  Hum,\" as the people about here call it. Do not fancy anything damp or  chilly. No; it was like a natural temple--perfect repose and refreshment  to the eyes dazzled with the brilliant outside colouring. Centuries ago  there must have been a great landslip here, for the side of the mountain  is quite hollowed out, and Nature has gradually covered the ugly brown  rent with the thickest tapestry of her most delicate handiwork. I  noticed two varieties of the maiden-hair, its slender black stem making  the most exquisite tracery among the vivid greens. There was no tint  of colour except green when once we passed the red-fringed curtain of  rata-branches, only the white and shining fairy beach and the gleaming  threads of water. As we sat there, perfectly still, and entranced,  a sort of delicious mesmeric feeling stole over me; I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#17)"],[1,".    Colin was deeply suspicious and followed his heels growling, but he  never turned his head.    'The day is warm, father,' I said in Kaffir.  'Do you go far?'    He slackened his pace till he was at my elbow.  'But a short way,  Baas,' he replied in English; 'I go to the store yonder.'    'Well met, then,' said I, 'for I am the storekeeper.  You will find  little in it, for it is newly built and not yet stocked.  I have ridden  over to see to it.'    He turned his face to me.  'That is bad news.  I had hoped for food and  drink yonder.  I have travelled far, and in the chill nights I desire a  cover for my head.  Will the Baas allow me to sleep the night in an  outhouse?'    By this time I had recovered my nerve, and was ready to play the part I  had determined on.  'Willingly,' I said.  'You may sleep in the  storeroom if you care.  You will find sacks for bedding, and the place  is snug enough on a cold night.'    He thanked me with a grave dignity which I had never seen in any  Kaffir.  As my eye fell on his splendid proportions I forgot all else  in my admiration of the man.  In his minister's clothes he had looked  only a heavily built native, but now in his savage dress I saw how  noble a figure he made.  He must have been at least six feet and a  half, but his chest was so deep and his shoulders so massive that one  did not remark his height.  He put a hand on my saddle, and I remember  noting how slim and fine it was, more like a high-bred woman's than a  man's.  Curiously enough he filled me with a certain confidence.    'I do not think you will cut my throat,' I said to myself. 'Your game  is too big for common murder.'    The store at Umvelos' stood as I had left it.  There was the sjambok I  had forgotten still lying on the window sill.  I unlocked the door, and  a stifling smell of new paint came out to meet me.  Inside there was  nothing but the chairs and benches, and in a corner the pots and pans I  had left against my next visit.  I unlocked the cupboard and got out a  few stores, opened the windows of the bedroom next door, and flung my  kaross on the cartel which did duty as bed.  Then I went out to find  Laputa standing patiently in the sunshine.    I showed him the outhouse where I had said he might sleep. It was the  largest room in the store, but wholly unfurnished. A pile of barrels  and packing-cases stood in the corner, and there was enough sacking to  make a sort of bed.    'I am going to make tea,' I said.  'If you have come far you would  maybe like a cup?'    He thanked me, and I made a fire in the grate and put on the kettle to  boil.  Then I set on the table biscuits, and sardines, and a pot of  jam.  It was my business now to play the fool, and I believe I  succeeded to admiration in the part.  I blush to-day to think of the  stuff I talked.  First I made him sit on a chair opposite me, a thing  no white man in the country would have done.  Then I told him  affectionately that I liked natives, that they were fine fellows and  better men than the dirty whites round about.  I explained that I was  fresh from England, and believed in equal rights for all men, white or  coloured.  God forgive me, but I think I said I hoped to see the day  when Africa would belong once more to its rightful masters.    He heard me with an impassive face, his grave eyes studying every line  of me.  I am bound to add that he made a hearty meal, and drank three  cups of strong tea of my brewing.  I gave him a cigar, one of a lot I  had got from a Dutch farmer who was experimenting with their  manufacture--and all the while I babbled of myself and my opinions.  He  must have thought me half-witted, and indeed before long I began to be  of the same opinion myself.  I told him that I meant to sleep the night  here, and go back in the morning to Blaauwildebeestefontein, and then  to Pietersdorp for stores.  By-and-by I could see that he had ceased to  pay any attention to what I said.  I was clearly set down in his mind  as a fool.  Instead he kept looking at Colin, who was lying blinking in  the doorway, one wary eye cocked on the stranger.    'You have a fine dog,' he observed.    'Yes,' I agreed, with one final effort of mendacity, 'he's fine to look  at, but he has no grit in him.  Any mongrel from a kraal can make him  turn tail.  Besides, he is a born fool and can't find his way home.  I'm thinking of getting rid of him.'    Laputa rose and his eye fell on the dog's back.  I could see that he  saw the lie of his coat, and that he did not agree with me.    'The food was welcome, Baas,' he said.  'If you will listen to me I can  repay hospitality with advice.  You are a stranger here.  Trouble  comes, and if you are wise you will go back to the Berg.'    'I don't know what you mean,' I said, with an air of cheerful idiocy.  'But back to the Berg I go the first thing in the morning.  I hate  these stinking plains.'    'It were wise to go to-night,' he said, with a touch of menace in his  tone.    'I can't,' I said, and began to sing the chorus of a ridiculous  music-hall song--         'There's no place like home--but       I'm afraid to go home in the dark.'    Laputa shrugged his shoulders, stepped over the bristling Colin, and  went out.  When I looked after him two minutes later he had disappeared.      [1] The circlet into which, with the aid of gum, Zulu warriors weave  their hair.        CHAPTER IX    THE STORE AT UMVELOS'    I sat down on a chair and laboured to collect my thoughts. Laputa had  gone, and would return sooner or later with Henriques.  If I was to  remain alive till morning, both of them must be convinced that I was  harmless.  Laputa was probably of that opinion, but Henriques would  recognize me, and I had no wish to have that yellow miscreant  investigating my character. There was only one way out of it--I must be  incapably drunk.  There was not a drop of liquor in the store, but I  found an old whisky bottle half full of methylated spirits.  With this  I thought I might raise an atmosphere of bad whisky, and for the rest I  must trust to my meagre gifts as an actor.    Supposing I escaped suspicion, Laputa and Henriques would meet in the  outhouse, and I must find some means of overhearing them.  Here I was  fairly baffled.  There was no window in the outhouse save in the roof,  and they were sure to shut and bolt the door.  I might conceal myself  among the barrels inside; but apart from the fact that they were likely  to search them before beginning their conference, it was quite certain  that they would satisfy themselves that I was safe in the other end of  the building before going to the outhouse.    Suddenly I thought of the cellar which we had built below the store.  There was an entrance by a trap-door behind the counter, and another in  the outhouse.  I had forgotten the details, but my hope was that the  second was among the barrels.  I shut the outer door, prised up the  trap, and dropped into the vault, which had been floored roughly with  green bricks.  Lighting match after match, I crawled to the other end  and tried to lift the door.  It would not stir, so I guessed that the  barrels were on the top of it.  Back to the outhouse I went, and found  that sure enough a heavy packing-case was standing on a corner.  I  fixed it slightly open, so as to let me hear, and so arranged the odds  and ends round about it that no one looking from the floor of the  outhouse would guess at its existence.  It occurred to me that the  conspirators would want seats, so I placed two cases at the edge of the  heap, that they might not be tempted to forage in the interior.    This done, I went back to the store and proceeded to rig myself out for  my part.  The cellar had made me pretty dirty, and I added some new  daubs to my face.  My hair had grown longish, and I ran my hands  through it till it stood up like a cockatoo's crest.  Then I cunningly  disposed the methylated spirits in the places most likely to smell.  I  burned a little on the floor, I spilt some on the counter and on my  hands, and I let it dribble over my coat.  In five minutes I had made  the room stink like a shebeen.  I loosened the collar of my shirt, and  when I looked at myself in the cover of my watch I saw a specimen of  debauchery which would have done credit to a Saturday night's police  cell.    By this time the sun had gone down, but I thought it better to kindle  no light.  It was the night of the full moon--for which reason, I  supposed, Laputa had selected it--and in an hour or two the world would  be lit with that ghostly radiance.  I sat on the counter while the  minutes passed, and I confess I found the time of waiting very trying  for my courage.  I had got over my worst nervousness by having  something to do, but whenever I was idle my fears returned.  Laputa had  a big night's work before him, and must begin soon.  My vigil, I told  myself, could not be long.    My pony was stalled in a rough shed we had built opposite the store.  I  could hear him shaking his head and stamping the ground above the  croaking of the frogs by the Labongo. Presently it seemed to me that  another sound came from behind the store--the sound of horses' feet and  the rattle of bridles.  It was hushed for a moment, and then I heard  human voices.  The riders had tied up their horses to a tree and were  coming nearer.    I sprawled gracefully on the counter, the empty bottle in my hand, and  my eyes fixed anxiously on the square of the door, which was filled  with the blue glimmer of the late twilight. The square darkened, and  two men peered in.  Colin growled from below the counter, but with one  hand I held the scruff of his neck.    'Hullo,' I said, 'ish that my black friend?  Awfly shorry, old man, but  I've f'nish'd th' whisky.  The bo-o-ottle shempty,' and I waved it  upside down with an imbecile giggle.    Laputa said something which I did not catch.  Henriques laughed an ugly  laugh.    'We had better make "]]]
