Coming so  soon after the exertion and strain of the mile, this shock made him  feel sick and dizzy.    When he had gone, the Head turned to Mr Thompson with a worried look on  his face. 'I feel as certain as I do of anything,' he said  thoughtfully, 'that that boy is telling the truth. If he had been  guilty, he would not have behaved like that. I feel sure of it.'    Mr Thompson looked equally thoughtful. 'The circumstances are certainly  very suspicious,' he said, echoing the Head's own words. 'I wish I  could think he was innocent, but I am bound to say I do not. I regard  the evidence as conclusive.'    'Circumstantial evidence is proverbially uncertain, Mr Thompson. That  is principally the reason why I was so bent on making him confess if he  had anything to confess. I can't expel a boy and ruin his whole career  on mere suspicion. The matter must be proved, doubly proved, and even  then I should feel uneasy until he owned himself guilty. It is a most  unpleasant affair, a terrible affair.'    'Most,' agreed Mr Thompson.    And exactly the same thing was occurring at that moment to Jim, as he  sat on his bed in his dormitory, and pondered hopelessly on this new  complication that had presented itself so unexpectedly. He was getting  very near to the end of his tether, was J. Thomson of Merevale's. It  seemed to him, indeed, that he had reached it already. Possibly if he  had had a clearer conscience and a larger experience, he might have  recognized that the evidence which Mr Thompson had described as  conclusive, was in reality not strong enough to hang a cat on.  Unfortunately, he did not enjoy those advantages.          [13]    SIR ALFRED SCORES      Soon after Jim had taken his departure, Mr Thompson, after waiting a  few minutes in case the Headmaster had anything more to say, drifted  silently out of the room. The Head, like the gentleman in the ballad,  continued to wear a worried look. The more he examined the matter, the  less did he know what to make of it. He believed, as he had said to Mr  Thompson, that Jim was entirely innocent. It was an incredible thing,  he thought, that a public school boy, a School-prefect, too, into the  bargain, should break out of his House and into a cricket pavilion,  however great a crisis his finances might be undergoing. And then to  steal two of the prizes for the Sports. Impossible. Against this,  however, must be placed the theft of the two pounds. It might occur to  a boy, as indeed Mr Thompson had suggested, to steal the cups in order  to give the impression that a practised burglar had been at work. There  was certainly something to be said in favour of this view. But he would  never believe such a thing. He was a good judge of character--a  headmaster generally is--and he thought he could tell when a boy was  speaking the truth and when he was not.    His reflections were interrupted by a knock at the door. The butler  entered with a card on a tray. 'Sir Alfred Venner, M.P., Badgwick  Hall,' said--almost shouted--the card. He read the words without any  apparent pleasure.    'Is Sir Alfred here himself, Parker?' he said.    'He is, sir.'    The Headmaster sighed inaudibly but very wearily. He was feeling  worried already, and he knew from experience that a _tete-a-tete_  with Sir Alfred Venner, M.P., of Badgwick Hall, would worry him still  more.    The Head was a man who tried his very hardest to like each and all of  his fellow-creatures, but he felt bound to admit that he liked most  people a great, a very great, deal better than he liked the gentleman  who had just sent in his card. Sir Alfred's manner always jarred upon  him. It was so exactly the antithesis of his own. He was quiet and  dignified, and addressed everybody alike, courteously. Sir Alfred was  restless and fussy. His manner was always dictatorial and generally  rude. When he had risen in the House to make his maiden speech, calling  the attention of the Speaker to what he described as 'a thorough  draught', he had addressed himself with such severity to that official,  that a party of Siamese noblemen, who, though not knowing a word of  English, had come to listen to the debate, had gone away with the  impression that he was the prime minister. No wonder the Headmaster  sighed.    'Show him in, Parker,' said he resignedly.    'Yessir.'    Parker retired, leaving the Head to wonder what his visitor's grievance  might be this time. Sir Alfred rarely called without a grievance,  generally connected with the trespassing of the School on his land.    'Good evening, Sir Alfred,' he said, as his visitor whirled into the  room.    'O-o-o, this sort of thing won't do, you know, Mr Perceval,' said Sir  Alfred fussily, adjusting a pair of gold pince-nez on his nose. The  Head's name, which has not before been mentioned, was the Reverend  Herbert Perceval, M.A. He had shivered at the sound of the 'O-o-o'  which had preceded Sir Alfred's remark. He knew, as did other  unfortunate people, that the great man was at his worst when he said  'O-o-o'. In moments of comparative calm he said 'Er'.    'I can't put up with it, you know, Mr Perceval. It's too much. A great  deal too much.'    'You refer to--?' suggested the Head, with a patience that did him  credit.    'This eternal trespassing and tramping in and out of my grounds all  day.'    'You have been misinformed, I fear, Sir Alfred. I have not trespassed  in your grounds for--ah--a considerable time.' The Head could not  resist this thrust. In his unregenerate 'Varsity days he had been a  power at the Union, where many a foeman had exposed himself to a verbal  counter from him with disastrous results. Now the fencing must be done  with buttons on the foils.    'You--what--I don't follow you, Mr Perceval.'    'I understand you to reproach me for trespassing and--ah--tramping in  and out of your grounds all day. Was that not your meaning?'    Sir Alfred almost danced with impatience.    'No, no, no. You misunderstand me. You don't follow my drift.'    'In that case, I beg your pardon. I gathered from the extreme severity  of your attitude towards me that I was the person to whom you  referred.'    'No, no, no. I've come here to complain of your boys.'    It occurred to the Head to ask if the complaint embraced the entire six  hundred of them, or merely referred to one of them. But he reflected  that the longer he fenced, the longer his visitor would stay. And he  decided, in spite of the illicit pleasure to be derived from the  exercise, that it was not worth while.    'Ah,' he said.    'Yes,' continued Sir Alfred, 'my keepers tell me the woods were full of  them, sir.'    The Head suggested that possibly the keepers had exaggerated.    'Possibly. Possibly they may have exaggerated. But that is not the  point. The nuisance is becoming intolerable, Mr Perceval, perfectly  intolerable. It is time to take steps.'    'I have already done all that can be done. I have placed your land out  of bounds, considerably out of bounds indeed. And I inflict the  severest penalties when a breach of the rule is reported to me.'    'It's not enough. It's not nearly enough.'    'I can scarcely do more, I fear, Sir Alfred. There are more than six  hundred boys at St Austin's, and it is not within my power to place  them all under my personal supervision.'    Here the Head, who had an eye to the humorous, conjured up a picture of  six hundred Austinians going for walks, two and two, the staff posted  at intervals down the procession, and himself bringing up the rear. He  made a mental mem. to laugh when his visitor had retired.    'H'm,' said the baffled M.P. thoughtfully, adjusting his pince-nez once  more. ''M no. No, perhaps not. But'--here he brightened up--'you can  punish them when they do trespass.'    'That is so, Sir Alfred. I can and invariably do.'    'Then punish that what's-his-name, Plinkett, Plunkett--I've got the  name down somewhere. Yes, Plunkett. I thought so. Punish Plunkett.'    'Plunkett!' said the Head, taken completely by surprise. He, in common  with the rest of the world, had imagined Plunkett to be a perfect  pattern of what should be. A headmaster, like other judges of  character, has his failures.    'Plunkett. Yes, that is the name. Boy with spectacles. Good gracious,  Mr Perceval, don't tell me the boy gave me a false name.'    'No. His name is Plunkett. Am I to understand that he was trespassing  on your land? Surely there is some mistake? The boy's a  School-prefect.'    Here it suddenly flashed upon his mind that he had used that expression  before in the course of the day, on the occasion when Mr Thompson first  told him of his suspicions in connection with Jim. 'Why, Mr Thompson,  the boy's a School-prefect,' had been his exact words. School-prefects  had been in his eyes above suspicion. It is a bad day for a school when  they are not so. Had that day arrived for St Austin's? he asked  himself.    'He may be a School-prefect, Mr Perceval, but the fact remains that he  is a trespasser, and ought from your point of view to be punished for  breaking bounds.'    The Head suddenly looked almost cheerful again.    'Of course,' he said, 'of course. I thought that there must be an  explanation. The rules respecting bounds, Sir Alfred, do not apply to  School-prefects, only to the rest of the School.'    'Indeed?' said Sir Alfred. His tone should have warned the Head that  something more was coming, but it did not. He continued.    'Of course it was very wrong of him to trespass on your land, but I  have no doubt that he did it quite unintentionally. I will speak to  him, and I think I can guarantee that he will not do it again.'    'Oh,' said his visitor. 'That is very gratifying, I am sure. Might I  ask, Mr Perceval, if School-prefects at St Austin's have any other  privileges?'    The Head began to look puzzled. There was something in his visitor'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6985"],[0,"A Prefect's Uncle (#17)"],[1,"they were not resenting it now, the obvious conclusion  was that something was going on which ought to cease.    The Bishop opened the door. Etiquette did not compel the head of the  House to knock, the rule being that you knocked only at the doors of  those senior to you in the House. He was consequently enabled to  witness a tableau which, if warning had been received of his coming,  would possibly have broken up before he entered. In the centre of the  group was Wilson, leaning over the study table, not so much as if he  liked so leaning as because he was held in that position by Danvers. In  the background stood Monk, armed with a walking-stick. Round the walls  were various ornaments of the senior day-room in attitudes of expectant  attention, being evidently content to play the part of 'friends and  retainers', leaving the leading parts in the hands of Monk and his  colleague.    'Hullo,' said the Bishop, 'what's going on?'    'It's all right, old chap,' said Monk, grinning genially, 'we're only  having an execution.'    'What's the row?' said the Bishop. 'What's Wilson been doing?'    'Nothing,' broke in that youth, who had wriggled free from Danvers's  clutches. 'I haven't done a thing, Gethryn. These beasts lugged me out  of the junior day-room without saying what for or anything.'    The Bishop began to look dangerous. This had all the outward aspect of  a case of bullying. Under Reynolds's leadership Leicester's had gone in  rather extensively for bullying, and the Bishop had waited hungrily for  a chance of catching somebody actively engaged in the sport, so that he  might drop heavily on that person and make life unpleasant for him.    'Well?' he said, turning to Monk, 'let's have it. What was it all  about, and what have you got to do with it?'    Monk began to shuffle.    'Oh, it was nothing much,' he said.    'Then what are you doing with the stick?' pursued the Bishop  relentlessly.    'Young Wilson cheeked Perkins,' said Monk.    Murmurs of approval from the senior day-room. Perkins was one of the  ornaments referred to above.    'How?' asked Gethryn.    Wilson dashed into the conversation again.    'Perkins told me to go and get him some grub from the shop. I was doing  some work, so I couldn't. Besides, I'm not his fag. If Perkins wants to  go for me, why doesn't he do it himself, and not get about a hundred  fellows to help him?'    'Exactly,' said the Bishop. 'A very sensible suggestion. Perkins, fall  upon Wilson and slay him. I'll see fair play. Go ahead.'    'Er--no,' said Perkins uneasily. He was a small, weedy-looking youth,  not built for fighting except by proxy, and he remembered the episode  of Wilson and Skinner.    'Then the thing's finished,' said Gethryn. 'Wilson walks over. We  needn't detain you, Wilson.'    Wilson departed with all the honours of war, and the Bishop turned to  Monk.    'Now perhaps you'll tell me,' he said, 'what the deuce you and Danvers  are doing here?'    'Well, hang it all, old chap--'    The Bishop begged that Monk would not call him 'old chap'.    'I'll call you \"sir\", if you like,' said Monk.    A gleam of hope appeared in the Bishop's eye. Monk was going to give  him the opportunity he had long sighed for. In cold blood he could  attack no one, not even Monk, but if he was going to be rude, that  altered matters.    'What business have you in the day-room?' he said. 'You've got studies  of your own.'    'If it comes to that,' said Monk, 'so have you. We've got as much  business here as you. What the deuce are you doing here?'    Taken by itself, taken neat, as it were, this repartee might have been  insufficient to act as a _casus belli_, but by a merciful  dispensation of Providence the senior day-room elected to laugh at the  remark, and to laugh loudly. Monk also laughed. Not, however, for long.  The next moment the Bishop had darted in, knocked his feet from under  him, and dragged him to the door. Captain Kettle himself could not have  done it more neatly.    'Now,' said the Bishop, 'we can discuss the point.'    Monk got up, looking greener than usual, and began to dust his clothes.    'Don't talk rot,' he said, 'I can't fight a prefect.'    This, of course, the Bishop had known all along. What he had intended  to do if Monk had kept up his end he had not decided when he embarked  upon the engagement. The head of a House cannot fight by-battles with  his inferiors without the loss of a good deal of his painfully acquired  dignity. But Gethryn knew Monk, and he had felt justified in risking  it. He improved the shining hour with an excursus on the subject of  bullying, dispensed a few general threats, and left the room.    Monk had--perhaps not unnaturally--not forgotten the incident, and now  that public opinion ran strongly against Gethryn on account of his  M.C.C. match manoeuvres, he acted. A mass meeting of the Mob was called  in his study, and it was unanimously voted that field-outs in the  morning were undesirable, and that it would be judicious if the team  were to strike. Now, as the Mob included in their numbers eight of the  House Eleven, their opinions on the subject carried weight.    'Look here,' said Waterford, struck with a brilliant idea, 'I tell you  what we'll do. Let's sign a round-robin refusing to play in the House  matches unless Gethryn resigns the captaincy and the field-outs stop.'    'We may as well sign in alphabetical order,' said Monk prudently.  'It'll make it safer.'    The idea took the Mob's fancy. The round-robin was drawn up and signed.    'Now, if we could only get Reece,' suggested Danvers. 'It's no good  asking Marriott, but Reece might sign.'    'Let's have a shot at any rate,' said Monk.    And a deputation, consisting of Danvers, Waterford, and Monk, duly  waited upon Reece in his study, and broached the project to him.          [13]    LEICESTER'S HOUSE TEAM GOES INTO A SECOND EDITION      Reece was working when the deputation entered. He looked up  enquiringly, but if he was pleased to see his visitors he managed to  conceal the fact.    'Oh, I say, Reece,' began Monk, who had constituted himself spokesman  to the expedition, 'are you busy?'    'Yes,' said Reece simply, going on with his writing.    This might have discouraged some people, but Nature had equipped Monk  with a tough skin, which hints never pierced. He dropped into a chair,  crossed his legs, and coughed. Danvers and Waterford leaned in  picturesque attitudes against the door and mantelpiece. There was a  silence for a minute, during which Reece continued to write unmoved.    'Take a seat, Monk,' he said at last, without looking up.    'Oh, er, thanks, I have,' said Monk. 'I say, Reece, we wanted to speak  to you.'    'Go ahead then,' said Reece. 'I can listen and write at the same time.  I'm doing this prose against time.'    'It's about Gethryn.'    'What's Gethryn been doing?'    'Oh, I don't know. Nothing special. It's about his being captain of the  House team. The chaps seem to think he ought to resign.'    'Which chaps?' enquired Reece, laying down his pen and turning round in  his chair.    'The rest of the team, you know.'    'Why don't they think he ought to be captain? The head of the House is  always captain of the House team unless he's too bad to be in it at  all. Don't the chaps think Gethryn's good at cricket?'    'Oh, he's good enough,' said Monk. 'It's more about this M.C.C. match  business, you know. His cutting off like that in the middle of the  match. The chaps think the House ought to take some notice of it.  Express its disapproval, and that sort of thing.'    'And what do the chaps think of doing about it?'    Monk inserted a hand in his breast-pocket, and drew forth the  round-robin. He straightened it out, and passed it over to Reece.    'We've drawn up this notice,' he said, 'and we came to see if you'd  sign it. Nearly all the other chaps in the team have.'    Reece perused the document gravely. Then he handed it back to its  owner.    'What rot,' said he.    'I don't think so at all,' said Monk.    'Nor do I,' broke in Danvers, speaking for the first time. 'What else  can we do? We can't let a chap like Gethryn stick to the captaincy.'    'Why not?'    'A cad like that!'    'That's a matter of opinion. I don't suppose everyone thinks him a cad.  I don't, personally.'    'Well, anyway,' asked Waterford, 'are you going to sign?'    'My good man, of course I'm not. Do you mean to say you seriously  intend to hand in that piffle to Gethryn?'    'Rather,' said Monk.    'Then you'll be making fools of yourselves. I'll tell you exactly  what'll happen, if you care to know. Gethryn will read this rot, and  simply cut everybody whose name appears on the list out of the House  team. I don't know if you're aware of it, but there are several other  fellows besides you in the House. And if you come to think of it, you  aren't so awfully good. You three are in the Second. The other five  haven't got colours at all.'    'Anyhow, we're all in the House team,' said Monk.    'Don't let that worry you,' said Reece, 'you won't be long, if you show  Gethryn that interesting document. Anything else I can do for you?'    'No, thanks,' said Monk. And the deputation retired.    When they had gone, Reece made his way to the Bishop's study. It was  not likely that the deputation would deliver their ultimatum until late  at night, when the study would be empty. From what Reece knew of Monk,  he judged that it would be pleasanter to him to leave the document  where the Bishop could find it in the morning, rather than run the  risks that might attend a personal interview. There was time,  therefore, to let Gethryn know what was going to happen, so that he  might not be surprised into doing anything rash, such as resigning the  captaincy, for example. Not that Reece thought it likely that he would,  but it was better to take no risks.    Both Marriott and Gethryn were in the study when he arrived.    'Hullo, Reece,' said"]]]
