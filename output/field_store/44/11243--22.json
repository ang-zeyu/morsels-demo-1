Of Ariosto's four brothers, one became a courtier at Naples, another a  clergyman, another an envoy to the Emperor Charles the Fifth; and the  fourth, who was a cripple and a scholar, lived with Lodovico, and  celebrated his memory. His two sons, whose names were Virginio and  Gianbattista, and who were illegitimate (the reader is always to bear  in mind the more indulgent customs of Italy in matters of this nature,  especially in the poet's time), became, the first a canon in the  cathedral of Ferrara, and the other an officer in the army. It does not  appear that he had any other children.    Ariosto's renown is wholly founded on the _Orlando Furioso_, though he  wrote satires, comedies, and a good deal of miscellaneous poetry, all  occasionally exhibiting a master-hand. The comedies, however, were  unfortunately modelled on those of the ancients; and the constant  termination of the verse with trisyllables contributes to render them  tedious. What comedies might he not have written, had he given himself up  to existing times and manners[42]!    The satires are rather good-natured epistles to his friends, written with  a charming ease and straightforwardness, and containing much exquisite  sense and interesting autobiography.    On his lyrical poetry he set little value; and his Latin verse is not of  the best order. Critics have expressed their surprise at its inferiority  to that of contemporaries inferior to him in genius; but the reason lay  in the very circumstance. I mean, that his large and liberal inspiration  could only find its proper vent in his own language; he could not be  content with potting up little delicacies in old-fashioned vessels.    The _Orlando Furioso_ is, literally, a continuation of the _Orlando  Innamorato_; so much so, that the story is not thoroughly intelligible  without it. This was probably the reason of a circumstance that would be  otherwise unaccountable, and that was ridiculously charged against him as  a proof of despairing envy by the despairing envy of Sperone; namely, his  never having once mentioned the name of his predecessor. If Ariosto had  despaired of equalling Boiardo, he must have been hopeless of reaching  posterity, in which case his silence must have been useless; and, in  any case, it is clear that he looked on himself as the continuator of  another's narration. But Boiardo was so popular when he wrote, that  the very silence shews he must have thought the mention of his name  superfluous. Still it is curious that he never should have alluded to it  in the course of the poem. It could not have been from any dislike to the  name itself, or the family; for in his Latin poems he has eulogised the  hospitality of the house of Boiardo[43].    The _Furioso_ continued not only what Boiardo did, but what he intended  to do; for as its subject is Orlando's love, and knight-errantry in  general, so its object was to extol the house of Este, and deduce it from  its fabulous ancestor Ruggiero. Orlando is the open, Ruggiero the covert  hero; and almost all the incidents of this supposed irregular poem,  which, as Panizzi has shewn, is one of the most regular in the world, go  to crown with triumph and wedlock the originator of that unworthy race.  This is done on the old groundwork of Charlemagne and his Paladins, of  the treacheries of the house of Gan of Maganza, and of the wars of the  Saracens against Christendom. Bradamante, the Amazonian _intended_ of  Ruggiero, is of the same race as Orlando, and a great overthrower of  infidels. Ruggiero begins with being an infidel himself, and is kept from  the wars, like a second Achilles, by the devices of an anxious guardian,  but ultimately fights, is converted, and marries; and Orlando all the  while slays his thousands, as of old, loves, goes mad for jealousy, is  the foolishest and wisest of mankind (somewhat like the poet himself);  and crowns the glory of Ruggiero, not only by being present at his  marriage, but putting on his spurs with his own hand when he goes forth  to conclude the war by the death of the king of Algiers.    The great charm, however, of the _Orlando Furioso_ is not in its  knight-errantry, or its main plot, or the cunning interweavement of its  minor ones, but in its endless variety, truth, force, and animal spirits;  in its fidelity to actual nature while it keeps within the bounds of the  probable, and its no less enchanting verisimilitude during its wildest  sallies of imagination. At one moment we are in the midst of flesh and  blood like ourselves; at the next with fairies and goblins; at the next  in a tremendous battle or tempest; then in one of the loveliest of  solitudes; then hearing a tragedy, then a comedy; then mystified in some  enchanted palace; then riding, dancing, dining, looking at pictures; then  again descending to the depths of the earth, or soaring to the moon, or  seeing lovers in a glade, or witnessing the extravagances of the great  jealous hero Orlando; and the music of an enchanting style perpetually  attends us, and the sweet face of Angelica glances here and there like  a bud: and there are gallantries of all kinds, and stories endless, and  honest tears, and joyous bursts of laughter, and beardings for all base  opinions, and no bigotry, and reverence for whatsoever is venerable,  and candour exquisite, and the happy interwoven names of \"Angelica and  Medoro,\" young for ever.    But so great a work is not to be dismissed with a mere rhapsody of  panegyric. Ariosto is inferior, in some remarkable respects, to his  predecessors Pulci and Boiardo. His characters, for the most part, do not  interest us as much as theirs by their variety and good fellowship; he  invented none as Boiardo did, with the exception, indeed, of Orlando's,  as modified by jealousy; and he has no passage, I thick, equal in pathos  to that of the struggle at Roncesvalles; for though Orlando's jealousy  is pathetic, as well as appalling, the effects of it are confined to one  person, and disputed by his excessive strength. Ariosto has taken all  tenderness out of Angelica, except that of a kind of boarding-school  first love (which, however, as here-after intimated, may have simplified  and improved her general effect), and he has omitted all that was amusing  in the character of Astolfo. Knight-errantry has fallen off a little  in his hands from its first youthful and trusting freshness; more  sophisticate times are opening upon us; and satire more frequently and  bitterly interferes. The licentious passages (though never gross in  words, like those of his contemporaries,) are not redeemed by sentiment  as in Boiardo; and it seems to me, that Ariosto hardly improved so much  as he might have done Upon his predecessor's imitations of the classics.  I cannot help thinking that, upon the whole, he had better have left them  alone, and depended entirely on himself. Shelley says, he has too much  fighting and \"revenge,\"[44]--which is true; but the revenge was only  among his knights. He was himself (like my admirable friend) one of the  most forgiving of men; and the fighting was the taste of the age, in  which chivalry was still flourishing in the shape of such men as Bayard,  and ferocity in men like Gaston de Foix. Ariosto certainly did not  anticipate, any more than Shakspeare did, that spirit of human  amelioration which has ennobled the present age. He thought only of  reflecting nature as he found it. He is sometimes even as uninteresting  as he found other people; but the tiresome passages, thank God, all  belong to the house of Este! His panegyrics of Ippolito and his ancestors  recoiled on the poet with a retributive dulness.    But in all the rest there is a wonderful invigoration and enlargement.  The genius of romance has increased to an extraordinary degree in power,  if not in simplicity. Its shoulders have grown broader, its voice louder  and more sustained; and if it has lost a little on the sentimental side,  it has gained prodigiously, not only in animal vigour, but, above all, in  knowledge of human nature, and a brave and joyous candour in shewing it.  The poet takes a universal, an acute, and, upon the whole, a cheerful  view, like the sun itself, of all which the sun looks on; and readers are  charmed to see a knowledge at once so keen and so happy. Herein lies the  secret of Ariosto's greatness; which is great, not because it has the  intensity of Dante, or the incessant thought and passion of Shakspeare,  or the dignified imagination of Milton, to all of whom he is far inferior  in sustained excellence,--but because he is like very Nature herself.  Whether great, small, serious, pleasureable, or even indifferent, he  still has the life, ease, and beauty of the operations of the daily  planet. Even where he seems dull and common-place, his brightness and  originality at other times make it look like a good-natured condescension  to our own common habits of thought and discourse; as though he did it  but on purpose to leave nothing unsaid that could bring him within the  category of ourselves. His charming manner intimates that, instead of  taking thought, he chooses to take pleasure with us, and compare old  notes; and we are delighted that he does us so much honour, and makes, as  it were, Ariostos of us all. He is Shakspearian in going all lengths with  Nature as he found her, not blinking the fact of evil, yet finding a  \"soul of goodness\" in it, and, at the same time, never compromising the  worth of noble and generous qualities. His young and handsome Medoro is a  pitiless slayer of his enemies; but they were his master's enemies, and  he would have lost his life, even to preserve his dead body. His Orlando,  for all his wisdom and greatness, runs mad for love of a coquette, who  triumphs over warriors and kings, only to fall in love herself with an  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10657"],[0,"\"De Bello Gallico\" and Other Commentaries (#18)"],[1,"the Germans (who were said to have been summoned by the Belgae  to their aid) if they attempted to cross the river by force in their  ships. He orders P. Crassus to proceed into Aquitania with twelve  legionary cohorts and a great number of the cavalry, lest auxiliaries  should be sent into Gaul by these states, and such great nations be  united. He sends Q. Titurius Sabinus, his lieutenant, with three  legions, among the Unelli, the Curiosolitae, and the Lexovii, to take  care that their forces should be kept separate from the rest. He  appoints D. Brutus, a young man, over the fleet and those Gallic vessels  which he had ordered to be furnished by the Pictones and the Santoni,  and the other provinces which remained at peace; and commands him to  proceed towards the Veneti, as soon as he could. He himself hastens  thither with the land forces.    XII.--The sites of their towns were generally such that, being placed on  extreme points [of land] and on promontories, they neither had an  approach by land when the tide had rushed in from the main ocean, which  always happens twice in the space of twelve hours; nor by ships,  because, upon the tide ebbing again, the ships were likely to be dashed  upon the shoals. Thus, by either circumstance, was the storming of their  towns rendered difficult; and if at any time perchance the Veneti,  overpowered by the greatness of our works (the sea having been excluded  by a mound and large dams, and the latter being made almost equal in  height to the walls of the town), had begun to despair of their  fortunes, bringing up a large number of ships, of which they had a very  great quantity, they carried off all their property and betook  themselves to the nearest towns; there they again defended themselves by  the same advantages of situation. They did this the more easily during a  great part of the summer, because our ships were kept back by storms,  and the difficulty of sailing was very great in that vast and open sea,  with its strong tides and its harbours far apart and exceedingly few in  number.    XIII.--For their ships were built and equipped after this manner. The  keels were somewhat flatter than those of our ships, whereby they could  more easily encounter the shallows and the ebbing of the tide: the prows  were raised very high, and in like manner the sterns were adapted to the  force of the waves and storms [which they were formed to sustain]. The  ships were built wholly of oak, and designed to endure any force and  violence whatever; the benches, which were made of planks a foot in  breadth, were fastened by iron spikes of the thickness of a man's thumb;  the anchors were secured fast by iron chains instead of cables, and for  sails they used skins and thin dressed leather. These [were used] either  through their want of canvas and their ignorance of its application, or  for this reason, which is more probable, that they thought that such  storms of the ocean, and such violent gales of wind could not be  resisted by sails, nor ships of such great burden be conveniently enough  managed by them. The encounter of our fleet with these ships was of such  a nature that our fleet excelled in speed alone, and the plying of the  oars; other things, considering the nature of the place [and] the  violence of the storms, were more suitable and better adapted on their  side; for neither could our ships injure theirs with their beaks (so  great was their strength), nor on account of their height was a weapon  easily cast up to them; and for the same reason they were less readily  locked in by rocks. To this was added, that whenever a storm began to  rage and they ran before the wind, they both could weather the storm  more easily and heave to securely in the shallows, and when left by the  tide feared nothing from rocks and shelves: the risk of all which things  was much to be dreaded by our ships.    XIV.--Caesar, after taking many of their towns, perceiving that so much  labour was spent in vain and that the flight of the enemy could not be  prevented on the capture of their towns, and that injury could not be  done them, he determined to wait for his fleet. As soon as it came up  and was first seen by the enemy, about 220 of their ships, fully  equipped and appointed with every kind of [naval] implement, sailed  forth from the harbour, and drew up opposite to ours; nor did it appear  clear to Brutus, who commanded the fleet, or to the tribunes of the  soldiers and the centurions, to whom the several ships were assigned,  what to do, or what system of tactics to adopt; for they knew that  damage could not be done by their beaks; and that, although turrets were  built [on their decks], yet the height of the stems of the barbarian  ships exceeded these; so that weapons could not be cast up from [our]  lower position with sufficient effect, and those cast by the Gauls fell  the more forcibly upon us. One thing provided by our men was of great  service, [viz.] sharp hooks inserted into and fastened upon poles, of a  form not unlike the hooks used in attacking town walls. When the ropes  which fastened the sail-yards to the masts were caught by them and  pulled, and our vessel vigorously impelled with the oars, they [the  ropes] were severed; and when they were cut away, the yards necessarily  fell down; so that as all the hope of the Gallic vessels depended on  their sails and rigging, upon these being cut away, the entire  management of the ships was taken from them at the same time. The rest  of the contest depended on courage; in which our men decidedly had the  advantage; and the more so because the whole action was carried on in  the sight of Caesar and the entire army; so that no act, a little more  valiant than ordinary, could pass unobserved, for all the hills and  higher grounds, from which there was a near prospect of the sea, were  occupied by our army.    XV.--The sail-yards [of the enemy], as we have said, being brought down,  although two and [in some cases] three ships [of theirs] surrounded each  one [of ours], the soldiers strove with the greatest energy to board the  ships of the enemy: and, after the barbarians observed this taking  place, as a great many of their ships were beaten, and as no relief for  that evil could be discovered, they hastened to seek safety in flight.  And, having now turned their vessels to that quarter in which the wind  blew, so great a calm and lull suddenly arose, that they could not move  out of their place, which circumstance, truly, was exceedingly opportune  for finishing the business; for our men gave chase and took them one by  one, so that very few out of all the number, [and those] by the  intervention of night, arrived at the land, after the battle had lasted  almost from the fourth hour till sunset.    XVI.--By this battle the war with the Veneti and the whole of the sea  coast was finished; for both all the youth, and all, too, of more  advanced age, in whom there was any discretion or rank, had assembled in  that battle; and they had collected in that one place whatever naval  forces they had anywhere; and when these were lost, the survivors had no  place to retreat to, nor means of defending their towns. They  accordingly surrendered themselves and all their possessions to Caesar,  on whom Caesar thought that punishment should be inflicted the more  severely, in order that for the future the rights of ambassadors might  be more carefully respected, by barbarians: having, therefore, put to  death all their senate, he sold the rest for slaves.    XVII.--While these things are going on amongst the Veneti, Q. Titurius  Sabinus with those troops which he had received from Caesar, arrives in  the territories of the Unelli. Over these people Viridovix ruled, and  held the chief command of all those states which had revolted: from  which he had collected a large and powerful army. And in those few days,  the Aulerci and the Sexovii, having slain their senate because they  would not consent to be promoters of the war, shut their gates [against  us] and united themselves to Viridovix; a great multitude besides of  desperate men and robbers assembled out of Gaul from all quarters, whom  the hope of plundering and the love of fighting had called away from  husbandry and their daily labour. Sabinus kept himself within his camp,  which was in a position convenient for everything; while Viridovix  encamped over against him at a distance of two miles, and daily bringing  out his forces, gave him an opportunity of fighting; so that Sabinus had  now not only come into contempt with the enemy, but also was somewhat  taunted by the speeches of our soldiers; and furnished so great a  suspicion of his cowardice that the enemy presumed to approach even to  the very rampart of our camp. He adopted this conduct for the following  reason: because he did not think that a lieutenant ought to engage in  battle with so great a force, especially while he who held the chief  command was absent, except on advantageous ground or some favourable  circumstance presented itself.    XVIII.--After having established this suspicion of his cowardice, he  selected a certain suitable and crafty Gaul, who was one of those whom  he had with him as auxiliaries. He induces him by great gifts and  promises to go over to the enemy; and informs [him] of what he wished to  be done. Who, when he arrives amongst them as a deserter, lays before  them the fears of the Romans; and informs them by what difficulties  Caesar himself was harassed, and that the matter was not far removed  from this--that Sabinus would the next night privately draw off his army  out of the camp and set forth to Caesar, for the purpose of carrying  [him] assistance, which, when they heard, they all cry out together that  an opportunity of successfully conducting their enterprise ought not to  be thrown away; that they ought to go to the [Roman] camp. Many things  persuaded the Gauls to this "]]]
