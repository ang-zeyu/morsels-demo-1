In the same way Shirreff's oats were discovered in a single plant in a  field where it was isolated in order to be brought into commerce after  multiplication. It has won the surname of \"Make-him-rich.\" Nothing is on  record about the details of its origin.    Four valuable new varieties of wheat and oats were obtained in this way  in less than forty years. Then Shirreff changed his ideas and his method  of working. Striking specimens appeared to be too rare, and the  expectation of a profitable result too small. Therefore he began work on  a larger scale. He sought and selected during the summer of 1857 seventy  heads of wheat, each from a single plant showing some marked and  presumably favorable peculiarity. These were not gathered on one field,  but were brought together from all the fields to which he had access in  his vicinity. The grains of each of these selected heads were [114] sown  separately, and the lots compared during their whole life-period and  chiefly at harvest time. Three of the lots were judged of high  excellence, and they alone were propagated, and proving to be constant  new varieties from the outset were given to the trade under the names of  \"Shirreff's bearded white,\" \"Shirreff's bearded red,\" and \"Pringle's  wheat.\" They have found wide acceptance, and the first two of them are  still considered by Vilmorin as belonging to the best wheats of France.    This second method of Shirreff evidently is quite analogous to the  principle of Lagasca and Le Couteur. The previous assumption that new  varieties with striking features were being produced by nature from time  to time, was abandoned, and a systematic inquiry into the worth of all  the divergent constituents of the fields was begun. Every single ear at  once proved to belong to a constant and pure race, but most of these  were only of average value. Some few however, excelled to a degree,  which made them worth multiplying, and to be introduced into trade as  separate varieties.    Once started, this new method of comparison, selection and isolated  multiplication was of course capable of many improvements. The culture  in the experiment-field was improved, so as to insure a fuller and more  rapid growth.    [115] The ripe heads had to be measured and counted and compared with  respect to their size and the number of their kernels. Qualities of  grain and of meal had to be considered, and the influence of climate and  soil could not be overlooked.    Concerning the real origin of his new types Shirreff seems never to have  been very inquisitive. He remarks that only the best cultivated  varieties have a chance to yield still better types, and that it is  useless to select and sow the best heads of minor sorts. He further  remarks that it is not probable that he found a new sport every time; on  the contrary he assumes that his selections had been present in the  field before, and during a series of succeeding generations. How many  years old they were, was of course impossible to determine. But there is  no reason to believe that the conditions in the fields of Scotland were  different from those observed on the Isle of Jersey by Le Couteur.    In the year 1862 Shirreff devoted himself to the selection of oats,  searching for the best panicles from the whole country, and comparing  their offspring in his experimental garden. \"Early Fellow,\" \"Fine  Fellow,\" \"Longfellow\" and \"Early Angus\" are very notable varieties  introduced into trade in this way.    [116] Some years later Patrick Shirreff described his experiments and  results in a paper entitled, \"On the improvement of cereals,\" but the  descriptions are very short, and give few details of systematic value.  The leading principle, however, is clearly indicated, and anyone who  studies with care his method of working, may confidently attempt to  improve the varieties of his own locality in the same way.    This great principle of \"variety-testing,\" as it has been founded by Le  Couteur and Patrick Shirreff, has increased in importance ever since.  Two main features are to be considered here. One is the production of  local races, the other the choice of the best starting-point for  hybridizing experiments, as is shown in California by the work of Luther  Burbank in crossing different elementary species of _Lilium pardalinum_  and others.    Every region and locality has its own conditions of climate and soil.  Any ordinary mixed race will contain some elementary forms which are  better adapted to a given district, while others are more suitable to  divergent conditions. Hence it can readily be inferred that the choice  cannot be the same for different regions. Every region should select its  own type from among the various forms, and variety testing therefore  becomes a task which every [117] one must undertake under his own  conditions. Some varieties will prove, after isolation, to be profitable  for large districts and perhaps for whole states. Others will be found  to be of more local value, but in such localities to excel all others.    As an example we may take one of the varieties of wheat originated by  the Minnesota Experiment Station. Hays described it as follows. It was  originated from a single plant. From among 400 plants of \"Blue stem\"  several of the best were chosen, each growing separately, a foot apart  in every direction. Each of the selected plants yielded 500 or more  grains of wheat, weighing 10 or more grams. The seeds from these  selected plants were raised for a few years until sufficient was  obtained to sow a plot. Then for several years the new strains were  grown in a field beside the parent-variety. One of them was so much  superior that all others were discarded. It was the one named \"Minnesota  No. 169.\" For a large area of Minnesota this wheat seems capable of  yielding at least 1 or 2 bushels more grain per acre than its parent  variety, which is the best kind commonly and almost universally found on  the farms in southern and central Minnesota.    It would be quite superfluous for our present purpose to give more  instances. The fact of [118] the compound nature of so-called species of  cultivated plants seems to be beyond all doubt, and its practical  importance is quite obvious.    Acclimatization is another process, which is largely dependent on the  choice of adequate varieties. This is shown on a large scale by the slow  and gradual dispersion of the varieties of corn in this country. The  largest types are limited to temperate and subtropical regions, while  the varieties capable of cultivation in more northern latitudes are  smaller in size and stature and require a smaller number of days to  reach their full development from seed to seed. Northern varieties are  small and short lived, but the \"Forty-day-corn\" or \"Quarantino maize\" is  recorded to have existed in tropical America at the time of Columbus. In  preference, or rather to the entire exclusion of taller varieties, it  has thriven on the northern boundaries of the corn-growing states of  Europe since the very beginning of its cultivation.    According to Naudin, the same rule prevails with melons, cucumbers and  gherkins, and other instances could easily be given.    Referring now to the inferences that may be drawn from the experience of  the breeders in order to elucidate the natural processes, we will return  to the whitlow-grasses and pansies.    [119] Nature has constituted them as groups of slightly different  constant forms, quite in the same way as wheat and oats and corn.  Assuming that this happened ages ago somewhere in central Europe, it is  of course probable that the same differences in respect to the influence  of climatic conditions will have prevailed as with cereals. Subsequent  to the period which has produced the numerous elementary species of the  whitlow-grass came a period of widespread distribution. The process must  have been wholly comparable with that of acclimatization. Some species  must have been more adapted to northern climates, others to the soils of  western or eastern regions and so on. These qualities must have decided  the general lines of the distribution, and the species must have been  segregated according to their respective climatic qualities, and their  adaptability to soil and weather. A struggle for life and a natural  selection must have accompanied and guided the distribution, but there  is no reason to assume that the various forms were changed by this  process, and that we see them now endowed with other qualities than they  had at the outset.    Natural selection must have played, in this and in a large number of  other cases, quite the same part as the artificial method of variety  testing.    [120] Indeed it may be surmised that this has been its chief and  prominent function. Taking up again our metaphor of the sieve we can  assert that in such cases climate and soil exercise sifting action and  in this way the application of the metaphor becomes more definite. Of  course, next to the climate and soil in importance, come ecological  conditions, the vegetable and animal enemies of the plants and other  influences of the same nature.    In conclusion it is to be pointed out that this side of the problem of  natural selection and the struggle for life appears to offer the best  prospects for experimental, or for continued statistical inquiry. Direct  observations are possible and any comparison of numerical proportions of  species in succeeding years affords clear proof of the part it plays.  And above all, such observations can be made quite independently of  doubtful theoretical considerations about presumed changes of character.    The fact of natural selection is plain and it should be studied in its  most simple conditions.      [121]  C.

On the thirty-first,  _Kriegsgefahrzustand_ or \"condition of danger of war\" was  proclaimed at seven P. M., and at seven P. M. the demand was made  by Germany that Russia should demobilise within twelve hours. On  the thirtieth, I had a talk with Baron Beyens, the Minister of  Belgium, and Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador, in the garden  of the French Embassy in the afternoon. They both agreed that  nothing could prevent war except the intervention of America.    Both Ambassador Cambon and Minister Beyens were very sad and  depressed. After leaving them I met Sir Edward Grey upon the  street and had a short conversation with him. He also was very  depressed.    Acting on my own responsibility, I sent the following letter to  the Chancellor:      \"Your Excellency:      Is there nothing that my country can do? Nothing that I can    do towards stopping this dreadful war?      I am sure that the President would approve any act of mine    looking towards peace.                   Yours ever,        (Signed) JAMES W. GERARD.\"    To this letter I never had any reply.    On the first of August at five P. M. the order for mobilisation  was given, and at seven-ten P. M. war was declared by Germany on  Russia, the Kaiser proclaiming from the balcony of the palace  that \"he knew no parties more.\"    Of course, during these days the population of Berlin was greatly  excited. Every night great crowds of people paraded the streets  singing \"Deutschland Ueber Alles\" and demanding war. Extras,  distributed free, were issued at frequent intervals by the  newspapers, and there was a general feeling among the Germans  that their years of preparation would now bear fruit, that Germany  would conquer the world and impose its _Kultur_ upon all nations.    On the second of August, I called in the morning to say good-bye  to the Russian Ambassador. His Embassy was filled with unfortunate  Russians who had gone there to seek protection and help. Right  and left, men and women were weeping and the whole atmosphere  seemed that of despair.    On the day the Russian Ambassador left, I sent him my automobile  to take him to the station. The chauffeur and footman reported to  me that the police protection was inadequate, that the automobile  was nearly overturned by the crowd, and that men jumped on the  running board and struck the Ambassador and the ladies with him  in the face with sticks. His train was due to leave at one-fifteen  P. M. At about ten minutes of one, while I was standing in my  room in the Embassy surrounded by a crowd of Americans, Mrs.  James, wife of the Senator from Kentucky and Mrs. Post Wheeler,  wife of our Secretary to the Embassy in Japan, came to me and  said that they were anxious to get through to Japan via Siberia  and did not know what to do. I immediately scribbled a note to  the Russian Ambassador asking him to take them on the train with  him. This, and the ladies, I confided to the care of a red-headed  page boy of the Embassy who spoke German. By some miracle he  managed to get them to the railroad station before the Ambassador's  train left, the Ambassador kindly agreeing to take them with  him. His train, however, instead of going to Russia, was headed  for Denmark; and from there the two ladies crossed to Sweden,  thence to England, and so home, it being perhaps as well for them  that they did not have an opportunity to attempt the Siberian  journey during this period of mobilisation.    The Russian Ambassador reciprocated by confiding to me a Russian  Princess who had intended to go out with him but who, intimidated,  perhaps, by the scenes on the way to the station, had lost her  nerve at the railway station and refused to depart with the  Ambassador. She remained for a while in Berlin, and after some  weeks recovered sufficient courage to make the trip to Denmark.    On the morning of August fourth, having received an invitation  the day before, I \"attended\" at the Palace in Berlin. In the room  where the court balls had been held in peace times, a certain  number of the members of the Reichstag were assembled. The diplomats  were in a gallery on the west side of the room. Soon the Emperor,  dressed in field grey uniform and attended by several members of  his staff and a number of ladies, entered the room. He walked  with a martial stride and glanced toward the gallery where the  diplomats were assembled, as if to see how many were there. Taking  his place upon the throne and standing, he read an address to  the members of the Reichstag. The members cheered him and then  adjourned to the Reichstag where the Chancellor addressed them,  making his famous declaration about Belgium, stating that \"necessity  knew no law,\" and that the German troops were perhaps at that  moment crossing the Belgian frontier. Certain laws which had  been prepared with reference to the government of the country,  and which I will give in more detail in another place, as well as  the war credit, were voted upon by the Reichstag. The Socialists  had not been present in the Palace, but joined now in voting the  necessary credits.    On the afternoon of August fourth, I went to see von Jagow to  try and pick up any news. The British Ambassador sat in the  waiting-room of the Foreign Office. Sir Edward told me that he  was there for the purpose of asking for his passports. He spoke  in English, of course, and I am sure that he was overheard by a  man sitting in the room who looked to me like a German newspaper  man, so that I was not surprised when, late in the afternoon,  extra sheets appeared upon the street announcing that the British  Ambassador had asked for his passports and that Great Britain  had declared war.    At this news the rage of the population of Berlin was indescribable.  The Foreign Office had believed, and this belief had percolated  through all classes in the capital, that the English were so  occupied with the Ulster rebellion and unrest in Ireland that  they would not declare war.    [Illustration: CROWDS IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY AWAITING BULLETINS,  AUGUST, 1914.]    [Illustration: THE AMERICAN EMBASSY WAS THE CENTRE OF INTEREST  TO MANY IN THOSE EARLY DAYS OF THE WAR.]    After dinner I went to the station to say good bye to the French  Ambassador, Jules Cambon. The route from the French Embassy by  the Branderburg Thor to the Lehrter railway station was lined  with troops and police, so that no accident whatever occurred.  There was no one at the station except a very inferior official  from the German Foreign Office. Cambon was in excellent spirits  and kept his nerve and composure admirably. His family, luckily,  were not in Berlin at the time of the outbreak of the war. Cambon  instead of being sent out by way of Switzerland, whence of course  the road to France was easy, was sent North to Denmark. He was  very badly treated on the train, and payment for the special  train, in gold, was exacted from him by the German government.    Then I went for a walk about Berlin, soon becoming involved in  the great crowd in front of the British Embassy on the Wilhelm  Strasse. The crowd threw stones, etc., and managed to break all  the windows of the Embassy. The Germans charged afterwards that  people in the Embassy had infuriated the crowd by throwing pennies  to them. I did not see any occurrences of this kind. As the Unter  den Linden and the Wilhelm Platz are paved with asphalt the crowd  must have brought with them the missiles which they used, with  the premeditated design of smashing the Embassy windows. A few  mounted police made their appearance but were at no time in  sufficient numbers to hold the crowd in check.    Afterwards I went around to the Unter den Linden where there was  a great crowd in front of the Hotel Adlon. A man standing on the  outskirts of the crowd begged me not to go into the hotel, as he  said the people were looking for English newspaper correspondents.    So threatening was the crowd towards the English correspondents  that Wile rang up the porter of the Embassy after we had gone  to bed and, not wishing to disturb us, he occupied the lounge in  the porter's rooms.    Believing that possibly the British Embassy might be in such  a condition that Sir Edward Goschen, the British Ambassador,  might not care to spend the night there, I ordered an automobile  and went up through the crowd which still choked the Wilhelm  Strasse, with Holand Harvey, the Second Secretary to the British  Embassy. Sir Edward and his secretaries were perfectly calm and  politely declined the refuge which I offered them in our Embassy.  I chatted with them for a while, and, as I was starting to leave, a  servant told me that the crowds in the street had greatly increased  and were watching my automobile. I sent out word by the servant  to open the automobile, as it was a landau, and to tell the  chauffeur, when I got in, to drive very slowly.    I drove slowly through the crowd, assailed only by the peculiar  hissing word that the Germans use when they are especially angry  and which is supposed to convey the utmost contempt. This word  is \"_Pfui_\" and has a peculiar effect when hissed out from  thousands of Teutonic throats.    As we left the outskirts of the crowd, a man of respectable  appearance jumped on the running board of the automobile, spit  at me, saying \"_Pfui_,\" and struck Harvey in the face with  his hat. I stopped the automobile, jumped out and chased this man  down the street and caught him. My German footman came running  up and explained that I was the American Ambassador and not an  Englishman. The man who struck Harvey thereupon apologised and  gave his card. He was a Berlin lawyer who came to the Embassy  next morning and apologised again for his \"mistake.\"    The following day, August fifth, I spent part of the time taking  over from Sir Edward the British interests.
