He fought, not for Helen, but for his oath's sake. The dispute waxes  hot; the calm dignity of Teucer easily discomfits the Spartan braggart,  who departs to bring aid. Meanwhile Tecmessa returns with the child whom  Teucer in a scene of consummate pathos bids kneel at his father's side,  holding in his hand a triple lock of hair--Teucer's, his mother's, his  own; this sacred symbol, if violated, would bring a curse on any who  dared outrage him. While the Chorus sing a song full of longings for  home, Agamemnon advances to the place, followed by Teucer. The King is  deliberately insolent, reviling Teucer for the stain on his birth. In  reply the latter in a great speech reminds him that there was a time  when the flames licked the Greek ships and there was none to save them  but Ajax, who had faced Hector single-handed. With kindling passion he  hurls the taunt of a stained birth back on Agamemnon and plainly tells  him that Ajax shall be buried and that the King will rue any attempt at  violence. Odysseus comes in to hear the quarrel. He admits that he  had once been the foe of the dead man, who yet had no equal in bravery  except Achilles. For all that, enmity in men should end where death  begins. Astonished at this defence of a foe, Agamemnon argues a little  with Odysseus, who gently reminds him that one day he too will need  burial. This human appeal obtains the necessary permission; Odysseus,  left alone with Teucer, offers him friendship. Too much overcome by  surprise and joy to say many words, Teucer accepts his friendship and  the play ends with a ray of sunlight after storm and gloom.    Once more Sophocles has filled every inch of his canvas. The plot never  flags and has no diminuendo after the death of Ajax. The cause of the  tragedy is not plainly indicated at the outset; with a skill which is  masterly, Sophocles represents in the opening scene Athena and Odysseus  as beings purely odious, mocking a great man's fall. With the progress  of the action these two characters recover their dignity; Athena has  just cause for her anger, while Odysseus obtains for the dead his right  of burial. We should notice further how the pathos of this fine play is  heightened by the conception of the \"one day\" which brought ruin to a  noble warrior. Had he been kept within his tent that one day--had this  fatal day been known, the ruin need not have happened. \"The pity of it\",  the needless waste of human life, what a theme is there for a tragedy!    The _Ajax_ has never exercised an acknowledged influence on literature.  It was a favourite with the Greeks, but modern writers have strangely  overlooked it. For us it has a good lesson. Here was a hero, born in an  island, who unaided saved a fleet when his allies were forced back  on their trenches and beyond them to the sea. His reward was such as  Wordsworth tells of:--      Alas! the gratitude of men    Has oftener left me mourning.    We remember many a long month of agony during which another island kept  destruction from a fleet and saved her allies withal. In some quarters  this island has received the gratitude which Ajax had; her friends  asked, \"What has England done in the war, anyhow?\" If it befits anybody  to answer, it must be England's Teucer, who has built another Salamis  overseas, just as he did. Our kindred across the oceans will give us the  reward of praise; for us the chastisement of Ajax may serve to reinforce  the warning which is to be found on the lips of not the least of our own  poets:--      \"For frantic boast and foolish word    Thy mercy on Thy people, Lord.\"    The _Electra_ is Sophocles' version of the revenge of Orestes which  Aeschylus described in the _Choephori_ and is useful as affording a  comparison between the methods of the two masters. An aged tutor at  early dawn enters the scene with Orestes to whom he shows his father's  palace and then departs with him to offer libations at the dead king's  tomb. Electra with a Chorus of Argive girls comes forward, the former  describing the insolent conduct of Clytemnestra who holds high revelry  on the anniversary of her husband's death and curses Electra for saving  Orestes. Chrysothemis, another daughter, comes out to talk with Electra;  she is of a different mould, gentle and timid like Ismene, and warns  Electra that in consequence of her obstinacy in revering her father's  memory Aegisthus intends to shut her up in a rocky cavern as soon as he  returns. She advises her to use good counsel, then departs to pour on  Agamemnon's tomb some libations which Clytemnestra offers in consequence  of a dream.    The Queen finds Electra ranging abroad as usual in the absence of  Aegisthus. She defends the murder of her husband, but is easily refuted  by Electra who points out that, if it is right to exact a life for a  life, she ought to suffer death herself. Clytemnestra prays to Apollo  to avert the omen of her dream, her prayer seemingly being answered  immediately by the entry of the old tutor who comes to inform her of  the death of Orestes, killed at Delphi in a chariot race which he  brilliantly describes. Torn by her emotions, Clytemnestra can be neither  glad nor sorry.        \"Shall I call this happy news, or dreadful but profitable? Hapless      am I, if I save my life at the cost of my own miseries. Strong is      the tie of motherhood; no parent hates a child even if outraged by      him. Yet, now that he is gone, I shall have rest and peace from his      threats.\"    Hearing so circumstantial a proof of her brother's death, Electra is  plunged into the depths of misery.    But soon Chrysothemis returns in a state of high excitement. She has  found a lock of Orestes' hair and some offerings at the tomb. Electra  quickly informs her that her elation is groundless, for their brother  is dead; she suggests that they two should strike the murderers, but  Chrysothemis recoils in horror from the plot. Then Orestes enters with  a casket in his hand; this he gives to Electra, saying it contains the  mortal remains of the dead prince. In utter hopelessness Electra takes  it and soliloquises over it. Seeing her misery, Orestes cannot refrain;  gently taking the casket from her he gradually reveals himself. The  tutor enters and recalls him to their immediate business. Electra asks  who the stranger is and learns that it is the very man to whom she  gave the infant boy her brother. The three advance to the palace which  Orestes enters to dispatch his mother, Electra bidding him smite with  double force, wishing only that Aegisthus were with her mother.    The end of Aegisthus himself is contrived with Sophoclean art. He comes  in hurriedly to find the two strangers who have proof of Orestes' death.    Electra tells him they are in the palace; they have not only told her of  the dead Orestes, but have shown him to her; Aegisthus himself can see  the unenviable sight; he can rejoice at it, if there is any joy in it.  Exulting, he sings a note of triumph at the removal of his fears and  threatens to chastise all who try henceforth to thwart his will. He  dashes open the door, and there sees the Queen lying dead. Orestes bids  him enter the palace, to be slain on the very spot where his father was  murdered.    Fortune has been kind in preserving us this play. The great difference  between the art of Sophocles and that of Aeschylus is here apparent.  Only one man has ventured to paint for us Aeschylus' Clytemnestra;  Leighton has revealed her, stern as Nature herself, remorseless, armed  with a sword to smite first, then argue if she can find time to do so.  Sophocles' Clytemnestra is a woman, lost as soon as she begins to reason  out her misdeeds. She prays to Apollo in secret, for fear lest Electra  may overhear her prayer and make it void. But the crudity of Aeschylus'  resources did not satisfy Sophocles, whose taste demanded a contrast to  heighten the character of his heroine and found one in the Homeric story  that Agamemnon had a second daughter. Aeschylus' stern nature did not  shrink from the sight of a meeting between mother and son; Sophocles  closed the doors upon the act of vengeance, though he represents Electra  as encouraging her brother from outside the palace. The Aegisthus  incident maintains the interest to the end in the masterly Sophoclean  style of refined and searching irony. The tone of the play is singular;  from misery it at first sinks to hopelessness, then to despair, and  finally it soars to triumphant joy. Such a dangerous venture was  unattempted before.    The most lovable woman in Greek literature is the heroine of the next  play, the _Trachiniae_, produced at an uncertain date. Deianeira had  been won and wed by Heracles; after a brief spell of happiness she found  herself left more and more alone as her husband's labours called him  away from her. For fifteen months she had heard no news of him. Her  nurse suggests that she should send her eldest son to Euboea to seek him  out, a rumour being abroad that he has reached that island. The mother  in her loneliness is comforted by a band of girls of Trachis, the  scene of the action. But her uneasiness is too great to be cheered; she  describes the strange curse of womanhood:--        \"When it is young it groweth in a clime of its own, plagued by no      heat of the sun nor rain nor wind; in careless gaiety it builds up      its days till it is no longer maid, but wife; then in the night it      hath its meed of cares, terrified for lord or children. Only such a      one can know from the sight of her own sorrows what is my burden      of grief.\"    But there is a deeper cause for anxiety; Heracles had said that if he  did not return in fifteen months he would either die or be rid for ever  of his labours; that very hour had come.

Nothing in the somber forest stirred or made any sound.    Tired men do not dream of war. When morning came over the gleaming fields  a company that had set out from Arn discovered the discovered the  camping-place of the warriors, and brought pavilions and provender. And  the warriors feasted, and the birds in the forest sang, and the  inspiration of Arleon awoke.    Then they rose, and following Arleon, entered the forest, and marched away  to the South. And many a woman of Arn sent her thoughts with them as they  played alone some old monotonous tune, but their own thoughts were far  before them, skimming over the bath through whose deeps the river tumbles  in marble Carcassonne.    When butterflies were dancing on the air, and the sun neared the zenith,  pavilions were pitched, and all the warriors rested; and then they feasted  again, and then played knightly games, and late in the afternoon marched  on once more, singing of Carcassonne.    And night came down with its mystery on the forest, and gave their  demoniac look again to the trees, and rolled up out of misty hollows a  huge and yellow moon.    And the men of Arn lit fires, and sudden shadows arose and leaped  fantastically away. And the night-wind blew, arising like a ghost, and  passed between the tree trunks, and slipped down shimmering glades, and  waked the prowling beasts still dreaming of day, and drifted nocturnal  birds afield to menace timorous things, and beat the roses of the  befriending night, and wafted to the ears of wandering men the sound of a  maiden's song, and gave a glamour to the lutanist's tune played in his  loneliness on distant hills; and the deep eyes of moths glowed like a  galleon's lamps, and they spread their wings and sailed their familiar  sea. Upon this night-wind also the dreams of Camorak's men floated to  Carcassonne.    All the next morning they marched, and all the evening, and knew they were  nearing now the deeps of the forest. And the citizens of Arn kept close  together and close behind the warriors. For the deeps of the forest were  all unknown to travellers, but not unknown to those tales of fear that men  tell at evening to their friends, in the comfort and the safety of their  hearths. Then night appeared, and an enormous moon. And the men of Camorak  slept. Sometimes they woke, and went to sleep again; and those that stayed  awake for long and listened heard heavy two-footed creatures pad through  the night on paws.    As soon as it was light the unarmed men of Arn began to slip away, and  went back by bands through the forest. When darkness came they did not  stop to sleep, but continued their flight straight on until they came to  Arn, and added there by the tales they told to the terror of the forest.    But the warriors feasted, and afterwards Arleon rose, and played his harp,  and led them on again; and a few faithful servants stayed with them still.  And they marched all day through a gloom that was as old as night, but  Arleon's inspiration burned in his mind like a star. And he led them till  the birds began to drop into the treetops, and it was evening and they all  encamped. They had only one pavilion left to them now, and near it they  lit a fire, and Camorak posted a sentry with drawn sword just beyond the  glow of the firelight. Some of the warriors slept in the pavilion and  others round about it.    When dawn came something terrible had killed and eaten the sentry. But the  splendour of the rumours of Carcassonne and Fate's decree that they should  never come there, and the inspiration of Arleon and his harp, all urged  the warriors on; and they marched deeper and deeper all day into the  forest.    Once they saw a dragon that had caught a bear and was playing with it,  letting it run a little way and overtaking it with a paw.    They came at last to a clear space in the forest just before nightfall. An  odour of flowers arose from it like a mist, and every drop of dew  interpreted heaven unto itself.    It was the hour when twilight kisses Earth.    It was the hour when a meaning comes into senseless things, and trees  out-majesty the pomp of monarchs, and the timid creatures steal abroad to  feed, and as yet the beasts of prey harmlessly dream, and Earth utters a  sigh, and it is night.    In the midst of the wide clearing Camorak's warriors camped, and rejoiced  to see stars again appearing one by one.    That night they ate the last of their provisions, and slept unmolested by  the prowling things that haunt the gloom of the forest.    On the next day some of the warriors hunted stags, and others lay in  rushes by a neighbouring lake and shot arrows at water-fowl. One stag was  killed, and some geese, and several teal.    Here the adventurers stayed, breathing the pure wild air that cities know  not; by day they hunted, and lit fires by night, and sang and feasted, and  forgot Carcassonne. The terrible denizens of the gloom never molested  them, venison was plentiful, and all manner of water-fowl: they loved the  chase by day, and by night their favourite songs. Thus day after day went  by, thus week after week. Time flung over this encampment a handful of  moons, the gold and silver moons that waste the year away; Autumn and  Winter passed, and Spring appeared; and still the warriors hunted and  feasted there.    One night of the springtide they were feasting about a fire and telling  tales of the chase, and the soft moths came out of the dark and flaunted  their colours in the firelight, and went out grey into the dark again; and  the night wind was cool upon the warriors' necks, and the camp-fire was  warm in their faces, and a silence had settled among them after some song,  and Arleon all at once rose suddenly up, remembering Carcassonne. And his  hand swept over the strings of his harp, awaking the deeper chords, like  the sound of a nimble people dancing their steps on bronze, and the music  rolled away into the night's own silence, and the voice of Arleon rose:    \"When there is blood in the bath she knows there is war in the mountains  and longs for the battle-shout of kingly men.\"    And suddenly all shouted, \"Carcassonne!\" And at that word their idleness  was gone as a dream is gone from a dreamer waked with a shout. And soon  the great march began that faltered no more nor wavered. Unchecked by  battles, undaunted in lonesome spaces, ever unwearied by the vulturous  years, the warriors of Camorak held on; and Arleon's inspiration led them  still. They cleft with the music of Arleon's harp the gloom of ancient  silences; they went singing into battles with terrible wild men, and came  out singing, but with fewer voices; they came to villages in valleys full  of the music of bells, or saw the lights at dusk of cottages sheltering  others.    They became a proverb for wandering, and a legend arose of strange,  disconsolate men. Folks spoke of them at nightfall when the fire was warm  and rain slipped down the eaves; and when the wind was high small children  feared the Men Who Would Not Rest were going clattering past. Strange  tales were told of men in old grey armour moving at twilight along the  tops of the hills and never asking shelter; and mothers told their boys  who grew impatient of home that the grey wanderers were once so impatient  and were now hopeless of rest, and were driven along with the rain  whenever the wind was angry.    But the wanderers were cheered in their wandering by the hope of coming to  Carcassonne, and later on by anger against Fate, and at last they marched  on still because it seemed better to march on than to think.    For many years they had wandered and had fought with many tribes; often  they gathered legends in villages and listened to idle singers singing  songs; and all the rumours of Carcassonne still came from the South.    And then one day they came to a hilly land with a legend in it that only  three valleys away a man might see, on clear days, Carcassonne. Tired  though they were and few, and worn with the years which had all brought  them wars, they pushed on instantly, led still by Arleon's inspiration  which dwindled in his age, though he made music with his old harp still.    All day they climbed down into the first valley and for two days ascended,  and came to the Town That May Not Be Taken In War below the top of the  mountain, and its gates were shut against them, and there was no way  round. To left and right steep precipices stood for as far as eye could  see or legend tell of, and the pass lay through the city. Therefore  Camorak drew up his remaining warriors in line of battle to wage their  last war, and they stepped forward over the crisp bones of old, unburied  armies.    No sentinel defied them in the gate, no arrow flew from any tower of war.  One citizen climbed alone to the mountain's top, and the rest hid  themselves in sheltered places.    Now, in the top of the mountain was a deep, bowl-like cavern in the rock,  in which fires bubbled softly. But if any cast a boulder into the fires,  as it was the custom for one of those citizens to do when enemies  approached them, the mountain hurled up intermittent rocks for three days,  and the rocks fell flaming all over the town and all round about it. And  just as Camorak's men began to batter the gate they heard a crash on the  mountain, and a great rock fell beyond them and rolled into the valley.  The next two fell in front of them on the iron roofs of the town. Just as  they entered the town a rock found them crowded in a narrow street, and  shattered two of them. The mountain smoked and panted; with every pant a  rock plunged into the streets or bounced along the heavy iron roof, and  the smoke went slowly up, and up, and up.    When they had come through the long town's empty streets to the locked  gate at the end, only fifteen were left. When they had broken"]]]
