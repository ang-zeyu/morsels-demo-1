And we of Uri, do we still endure  Upon our native soil the tyrant's keep?  Are we the last to strike for liberty?    MASTER MASON.  Shall the yoke stand that was to bow our necks?  Up! Tear it to the ground!    ALL.                 Down, down with it!    RUODI.  Where is the Stier of Uri?    URI.                 Here. What would ye?    RUODI.  Up to your tower, and wind us such a blast,  As shall resound afar, from hill to hill;  Rousing the echoes of each peak and glen,  And call the mountain men in haste together!       [Exit STIER OF URI--enter WALTER FURST.    FURST.  Stay, stay, my friends! As yet we have not learned  What has been done in Unterwald and Schwytz.  Let's wait till we receive intelligence!    RUODI.  Wait, wait for what? The accursed tyrant's dead,  And the bright day of liberty has dawned!    MASTER MASON.  How! Do these flaming signals not suffice,  That blaze on every mountain top around?    RUODI.  Come all, fall to--come, men and women, all!  Destroy the scaffold! Tear the arches down!  Down with the walls; let not a stone remain.    MASTER MASON.  Come, comrades, come! We built it, and we know  How best to hurl it down.    ALL.                Come! Down with it!       [They fall upon the building at every side.    FURST.  The floodgate's burst. They're not to be restrained.       [Enter MELCHTHAL and BAUMGARTEN.    MELCHTHAL.  What! Stands the fortress still, when Sarnen lies  In ashes, and when Rossberg is a ruin?    FURST.  You, Melchthal, here? D'ye bring us liberty?  Say, have you freed the country of the foe?    MELCHTHAL.  We've swept them from the soil. Rejoice, my friend;  Now, at this very moment, while we speak,  There's not a tyrant left in Switzerland!    FURST.  How did you get the forts into your power?    MELCHTHAL.  Rudenz it was who with a gallant arm,  And manly daring, took the keep at Sarnen.  The Rossberg I had stormed the night before.  But hear what chanced. Scarce had we driven the foe  Forth from the keep, and given it to the flames,  That now rose crackling upwards to the skies,  When from the blaze rushed Diethelm, Gessler's page,  Exclaiming, \"Lady Bertha will be burnt!\"    FURST.  Good heavens!       [The beams of the scaffold are heard falling.    MELCHTHAL.          'Twas she herself. Here had she been  Immured in secret by the viceroy's orders.  Rudenz sprang up in frenzy. For we heard  The beams and massive pillars crashing down,  And through the volumed smoke the piteous shrieks  Of the unhappy lady.    FURST.             Is she saved?    MELCHTHAL.  Here was a time for promptness and decision!  Had he been nothing but our baron, then  We should have been most chary of our lives;  But he was our confederate, and Bertha  Honored the people. So without a thought,  We risked the worst, and rushed into the flames.    FURST.  But is she saved?    MELCHTHAL.            She is. Rudenz and I  Bore her between us from the blazing pile,  With crashing timbers toppling all around.  And when she had revived, the danger past,  And raised her eyes to meet the light of heaven,  The baron fell upon my breast; and then  A silent vow of friendship passed between us--  A vow that, tempered in yon furnace heat,  Will last through every shock of time and fate.    FURST.  Where is the Landenberg?    MELCHTHAL.               Across the Bruenig.  No fault of mine it was, that he, who quenched  My father's eyesight, should go hence unharmed.  He fled--I followed--overtook and seized him,  And dragged him to my father's feet. The sword  Already quivered o'er the caitiff's head,  When at the entreaty of the blind old man,  I spared the life for which he basely prayed.  He swore Urphede [26], never to return:  He'll keep his oath, for he has felt our arm.    FURST.  Thank God, our victory's unstained by blood!    CHILDREN (running across the stage with fragments of wood).  Liberty! Liberty! Hurrah, we're free!    FURST.  Oh! what a joyous scene! These children will,  E'en to their latest day, remember it.       [Girls bring in the cap upon a pole. The whole stage     is filled with people.    RUODI.  Here is the cap, to which we were to bow!    BAUMGARTEN.  Command us, how we shall dispose of it.    FURST.  Heavens! 'Twas beneath this cap my grandson stood!    SEVERAL VOICES.  Destroy the emblem of the tyrant's power!  Let it burn!    FURST.          No. Rather be preserved!  'Twas once the instrument of despots--now  'Twill be a lasting symbol of our freedom.       [Peasants, men, women, and children, some standing,     others sitting upon the beams of the shattered scaffold,     all picturesquely grouped, in a large semicircle.    MELCHTHAL.  Thus now, my friends, with light and merry hearts,  We stand upon the wreck of tyranny;  And gallantly have we fulfilled the oath,  Which we at Rootli swore, confederates!    FURST.  The work is but begun. We must be firm.  For, be assured, the king will make all speed,  To avenge his viceroy's death, and reinstate,  By force of arms, the tyrant we've expelled.    MELCHTHAL.  Why, let him come, with all his armaments!  The foe within has fled before our arms;  We'll give him welcome warmly from without!    RUODI.  The passes to the country are but few;  And these we'll boldly cover with our bodies.    BAUMGARTEN.  We are bound by an indissoluble league,  And all his armies shall not make us quail.       [Enter ROSSELMANN and STAUFFACHER.    ROSSELMANN (speaking as he enters).  These are the awful judgments of the lord!    PEASANT.  What is the matter?    ROSSELMANN.             In what times we live!    FURST.  Say on, what is't? Ha, Werner, is it you?  What tidings?    PEASANT.          What's the matter?    ROSSELMANN.                    Hear and wonder.    STAUFFACHER.  We are released from one great cause of dread.    ROSSELMANN.  The emperor is murdered.    FURST.               Gracious heaven!       [PEASANTS rise up and throng round STAUFFACHER.    ALL.  Murdered! the emperor? What! The emperor! Hear!    MELCHTHAL.  Impossible! How came you by the news?    STAUFFACHER.  'Tis true! Near Bruck, by the assassin's hand,  King Albert fell. A most trustworthy man,  John Mueller, from Schaffhausen, brought the news.    FURST.  Who dared commit so horrible a deed?    STAUFFACHER.  The doer makes the deed more dreadful still;  It was his nephew, his own brother's child,  Duke John of Austria, who struck the blow.    MELCHTHAL.  What drove him to so dire a parricide?    STAUFFACHER.  The emperor kept his patrimony back,  Despite his urgent importunities;  'Twas said, indeed, he never meant to give it,  But with a mitre to appease the duke.  However this may be, the duke gave ear,  To the ill counsel of his friends in arms;  And with the noble lords, von Eschenbach,  Von Tegerfeld, von Wart, and Palm, resolved,  Since his demands for justice were despised,  With his own hands to take revenge at least.    FURST.  But say, how compassed he the dreadful deed?    STAUFFACHER.  The king was riding down from Stein to Baden,  Upon his way to join the court at Rheinfeld,--  With him a train of high-born gentlemen,  And the young princes, John and Leopold.  And when they reached the ferry of the Reuss,  The assassins forced their way into the boat,  To separate the emperor from his suite.  His highness landed, and was riding on  Across a fresh-ploughed field--where once, they say,  A mighty city stood in Pagan times--  With Hapsburg's ancient turrets full in sight,  Where all the grandeur of his line had birth--  When Duke John plunged a dagger in his throat,  Palm ran him through the body with his lance,  Eschenbach cleft his skull at one fell blow,  And down he sank, all weltering in his blood,  On his own soil, by his own kinsmen slain.  Those on the opposite bank, who saw the deed,  Being parted by the stream, could only raise  An unavailing cry of loud lament.  But a poor woman, sitting by the way,  Raised him, and on her breast he bled to death.    MELCHTHAL.  Thus has he dug his own untimely grave,  Who sought insatiably to grasp at all.    STAUFFACHER.  The country round is filled with dire alarm.  The mountain passes are blockaded all,  And sentinels on every frontier set;  E'en ancient Zurich barricades her gates,  That for these thirty years have open stood,  Dreading the murderers, and the avengers more,  For cruel Agnes comes, the Hungarian queen,  To all her sex's tenderness a stranger,  Armed with the thunders of the church to wreak  Dire vengeance for her parent's royal blood,  On the whole race of those that murdered him,--  Upon their servants, children, children's children,--  Nay on the stones that build their castle walls.  Deep has she sworn a vow to immolate  Whole generations on her father's tomb,  And bathe in blood as in the dew of May.    MELCHTHAL.  Know you which way the murderers have fled?    STAUFFACHER.  No sooner had they done the deed than they  Took flight, each following a different route,  And parted, ne'er to see each other more.  Duke John must still be wandering in the mountains.    FURST.  And thus their crime has yielded them no fruits.  Revenge is barren. Of itself it makes  The dreadful food it feeds on; its delight  Is murder--its satiety despair.    STAUFFACHER.  The assassins reap no profit by their crime;  But we shall pluck with unpolluted hands  The teeming fruits of their most bloody deed,  For we are ransomed from our heaviest fear;  The direst foe of liberty has fallen,  And, 'tis reported, that the crown will pass  From Hapsburg's house into another line.  The empire is determined to assert  Its old prerogative of choice, I hear.    FURST and several others.  Has any one been named to you?    STAUFFACHER.                   The Count  Of Luxembourg is widely named already.    FURST.  'Tis well we stood so stanchly by the empire!  Now we may hope for justice, and with cause."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6791"],[0,"Mary Stuart: A Tragedy (#17)"],[1,"on.    BURLEIGH.  You give this counsel? You?    LEICESTER.                 Howe'er it wound  My feelings to be forced to this extreme,  Yet now I see most clearly, now I feel  That the queen's welfare asks this bloody victim.  'Tis my proposal, therefore, that the writ  Be drawn at once to fix the execution.    BURLEIGH (to the QUEEN).  Since, then, his lordship shows such earnest zeal,  Such loyalty, 'twere well were he appointed  To see the execution of the sentence.    LEICESTER.  Who? I?    BURLEIGH.       Yes, you; you surely ne'er could find  A better means to shake off the suspicion  Which rests upon you still, than to command  Her, whom 'tis said you love, to be beheaded.    ELIZABETH (looking steadfastly at LEICESTER).  My lord advises well. So be it, then.    LEICESTER.  It were but fit that my exalted rank  Should free me from so mournful a commission,  Which would indeed, in every sense, become  A Burleigh better than the Earl of Leicester.  The man who stands so near the royal person  Should have no knowledge of such fatal scenes:  But yet to prove my zeal, to satisfy  My queen, I waive my charge's privilege,  And take upon myself this hateful duty.    ELIZABETH.  Lord Burleigh shall partake this duty with you.       [To BURLEIGH.    So be the warrant instantly prepared.       [BURLEIGH withdraws; a tumult heard without.        SCENE VII.       The QUEEN, the EARL OF KENT.    ELIZABETH.  How now, my Lord of Kent? What uproar's this  I hear without?    KENT.           My queen, it is thy people,  Who, round the palace ranged, impatiently  Demand to see their sovereign.    ELIZABETH.                   What's their wish?    KENT.  A panic terror has already spread  Through London, that thy life has been attempted;  That murderers commissioned from the pope  Beset thee; that the Catholics have sworn  To rescue from her prison Mary Stuart,  And to proclaim her queen. Thy loyal people  Believe it, and are mad; her head alone  Can quiet them; this day must be her last.    ELIZABETH.  How! Will they force me, then?    KENT.                   They are resolved----        SCENE VIII.       Enter BURLEIGH and DAVISON, with a paper.    ELIZABETH.  Well, Davison?    DAVISON (approaches earnestly).          Your orders are obeyed,  My queen----    ELIZABETH.        What orders, sir?       [As she is about to take the paper, she shudders, and starts back.                    Oh, God!    BURLEIGH.                       Obey  Thy people's voice; it is the voice of God.    ELIZABETH (irresolute, as if in contest with herself)  Oh, my good lord, who will assure me now  That what I hear is my whole people's voice,  The voice of all the world! Ah! much I fear,  That, if I now should listen to the wish  Of the wild multitude, a different voice  Might soon be heard;--and that the very men,  Who now by force oblige me to this step,  May, when 'tis taken, heavily condemn me!        SCENE IX.       Enter the EARL OF SHREWSBURY (who enters with great emotion).    SHREWSBURY.  Hold fast, my queen, they wish to hurry thee;       [Seeing DAVISON with the paper.    Be firm--or is it then decided?--is it  Indeed decided? I behold a paper  Of ominous appearance in his hand;  Let it not at this moment meet thy eyes,  My queen!----    ELIZABETH.        Good Shrewsbury! I am constrained----    SHREWSBURY.  Who can constrain thee? Thou art Queen of England,  Here must thy majesty assert its rights:  Command those savage voices to be silent,  Who take upon themselves to put constraint  Upon thy royal will, to rule thy judgment.  Fear only, blind conjecture, moves thy people;  Thou art thyself beside thyself; thy wrath  Is grievously provoked: thou art but mortal,  And canst not thus ascend the judgment seat.    BURLEIGH.  Judgment has long been past. It is not now  The time to speak but execute the sentence.    KENT (who upon SHREWSBURY'S entry had retired, comes back).  The tumult gains apace; there are no means  To moderate the people.    ELIZABETH (to SHREWSBURY).               See, my lord,  How they press on.    SHREWSBURY.            I only ask a respite;  A single word traced by thy hand decides  The peace, the happiness of all thy life!  Thou hast for years considered, let not then  A moment ruled by passion hurry thee--  But a short respite--recollect thyself!  Wait for a moment of tranquillity.    BURLEIGH (violently).  Wait for it--pause--delay--till flames of fire  Consume the realm; until the fifth attempt  Of murder be successful! God, indeed,  Hath thrice delivered thee; thy late escape  Was marvellous, and to expect again  A miracle would be to tempt thy God!    SHREWSBURY.  That God, whose potent hand hath thrice preserved thee,  Who lent my aged feeble arm its strength  To overcome the madman:--he deserves  Thy confidence. I will not raise the voice  Of justice now, for now is not the time;  Thou canst not hear it in this storm of passion.  Yet listen but to this! Thou tremblest now  Before this living Mary--tremble rather  Before the murdered, the beheaded Mary.  She will arise, and quit her grave, will range  A fiend of discord, an avenging ghost,  Around thy realm, and turn thy people's hearts  From their allegiance. For as yet the Britons  Hate her, because they fear her; but most surely  Will they avenge her when she is no more.  They will no more behold the enemy  Of their belief, they will but see in her  The much-lamented issue of their kings  A sacrifice to jealousy and hate.  Then quickly shalt thou see the sudden change  When thou hast done the bloody deed; then go  Through London, seek thy people, which till now  Around thee swarmed delighted; thou shalt see  Another England, and another people;  For then no more the godlike dignity  Of justice, which subdued thy subjects' hearts,  Will beam around thee. Fear, the dread ally  Of tyranny, will shuddering march before thee,  And make a wilderness in every street--  The last, extremest crime thou hast committed.  What head is safe, if the anointed fall?    ELIZABETH.  Ah! Shrewsbury, you saved my life, you turned  The murderous steel aside; why let you not  The dagger take its course? then all these broils  Would have been ended; then, released from doubt,  And free from blame, I should be now at rest  In my still, peaceful grave. In very sooth  I'm weary of my life, and of my crown.  If Heaven decree that one of us two queens  Must perish, to secure the other's life--  And sure it must be so--why should not I  Be she who yields? My people must decide;  I give them back the sovereignty they gave.  God is my witness that I have not lived  For my own sake, but for my people's welfare.  If they expect from this false, fawning Stuart,  The younger sovereign, more happy days,  I will descend with pleasure from the throne,  Again repair to Woodstock's quiet bowers,  Where once I spent my unambitious youth;  Where far removed from all the vanities  Of earthly power, I found within myself  True majesty. I am not made to rule--  A ruler should be made of sterner stuff:  My heart is soft and tender. I have governed  These many years this kingdom happily,  But then I only needed to make happy:  Now, comes my first important regal duty,  And now I feel how weak a thing I am.    BURLEIGH.  Now by mine honor, when I hear my queen,  My royal liege, speak such unroyal words,  I should betray my office, should betray  My country, were I longer to be silent.  You say you love your people 'bove yourself,  Now prove it. Choose not peace for your own heart,  And leave your kingdom to the storms of discord.  Think on the church. Shall, with this papist queen  The ancient superstition be renewed?  The monk resume his sway, the Roman legate  In pomp march hither; lock our churches up,  Dethrone our monarchs? I demand of you  The souls of all your subjects--as you now  Shall act, they all are saved, or all are lost!  Here is no time for mercy;--to promote  Your people's welfare is your highest duty.  If Shrewsbury has saved your life, then I  Will save both you and England--that is more!    ELIZABETH.  I would be left alone. No consolation,  No counsel can be drawn from human aid  In this conjecture:--I will lay my doubts  Before the Judge of all:--I am resolved  To act as He shall teach. Withdraw, my lords.       [To DAVISON, who lays the paper on the table.    You, sir, remain in waiting--close at hand.       [The lords withdraw, SHREWSBURY alone stands     for a few moments before the QUEEN, regards her     significantly, then withdraws slowly, and with     an expression of the deepest anguish.        SCENE X.       ELIZABETH alone.    Oh! servitude of popularity!  Disgraceful slavery! How weary am I  Of flattering this idol, which my soul  Despises in its inmost depth! Oh! when  Shall I once more be free upon this throne?  I must respect the people's voice, and strive  To win the favor of the multitude,  And please the fancies of a mob, whom naught  But jugglers' tricks delight. O call not him  A king who needs must please the world: 'tis he  Alone, who in his actions does not heed  The fickle approbation of mankind.  Have I then practised justice, all my life  Shunned each despotic deed; have I done this  Only to bind my hands against this first,  This necessary act of violence?  My own example now condemns myself!  Had I but been a tyrant, like my sister,  My predecessor, I could fearless then  Have shed this royal blood:--but am I now  Just by my own free choice? No--I was forced  By stern necessity to use this virtue;  Necessity, which binds e'en monarch's wills.  Surrounded by my foes, my people's love  Alone supports me on my envied throne.  All Europe's powers confederate to destroy me;  The pope's inveterate decree declares me  Accursed and excommunicated. France  Betrays me with a kiss, and Spain prepares  At sea a fierce exterminating war;  Thus stand I, in contention with the world,  A poor defenceless woman: I must seek  To veil the spot in my imperial birth,  By"]]]
