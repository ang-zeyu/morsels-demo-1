They did not know, but they soon found out how tiresome it  was to pose. They must hold their paws up, down, sideways or behind,  according as they were told. They must stand or kneel, for a long time,  in awkward positions. They must stick out their tongues to full length,  walk on their hind legs, twist their necks, to one side or the other,  look forward or backward, and in many tiresome ways do just as they were  ordered. They must also make of their tails every sort of use, whether  to wrap around posts or bundles, to stick out of their cage, or put  between their legs, as they ran away, or to whisk them around, as they  roared; or hoist them up high when rampant.    In some cases, they were expected, even, to put on spectacles, and  pretend to be reading, to hold in their paws books and scrolls, or town  arms, or shop signs. They must pose, not only as companions of Daniel,  in the lions' den at Babylon, which was proper; but also to sit, as  companion of St. Mark, and even to stand on their legs on the top of a  high column, without falling off.    In a word, this artist belonged to the college of heralds, and he  introduced the king of beasts into Dutch heraldry.    So from that day forth, the life of that family of African lions, from  the daddy to the youngest cub, was made a burden. When at home in the  jungle and even in the cage, the father lion's favorite position was  that of lolling on one side, with his paws stretched out, and half  asleep and all day, until he went out, towards dark, to hunt. Now, he  must stand up, nearly all day. Daddy lion had to do most of the posing,  until the poor beast's front legs and paws were weary with standing so  long. Moreover, the hair was all worn off his body at the place where he  had to sit on the hard wooden floor. He must do all this, on penalty of  being punched with a red hot poker, if he refused. A charcoal furnace  and long andirons were kept near by, and these were attended to by a  Dutch boy. Or, it might be that the whole family of lions were not  allowed to have any dinner till Daddy obeyed and did what he was told,  though often with a snarl or a roar.    First, Leo must rise upon his hind legs and look in front of him. This  posture was not hard, for in his native jungle, he had often thus  obtained a breakfast of venison for his wife and family. But oh, to  stand a half hour on two legs only, when he had four, and would gladly  have used all of them, was hard. Yet this was the position, called \"the  lion rampant,\" which kings liked best.    But the king's uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins, and his wife's  relations generally, every one of them, wanted a lion on his or her  stationery and pocket handkerchiefs, as well as on their shields and  flags. So the old lion was tortured--the hot poker being always in  sight--and he was made to take a great variety of positions. The artist  called out to Leo, just as a driver says to his cart horse, \"whoa,\" \"get  up,\" \"golong,\" etc. When he yelled in this fashion, the lion had to  obey.    Pretty soon lions in heraldry, on flags, armor, town arms, family crests  and city seals became all the fashion. The whole country went lion-mad.  There were lions carved in stone, wood and iron, and every sort and  kind, possible or impossible. Some of them seemed to be engaged in a  variety of tricks, as if they belonged to a circus, or were having a  holiday. They laughed, giggled, yawned, stuck out their tongues, held  boards for hotels, bundles for the shopkeepers, or barrels for beer  halls, and made excellent shop signs, which the boys and girls enjoyed  looking at.    Mrs. Leo was not in much demand, for Mr. Leo did not approve of his  wife's appearing in public. She was kept busy in taking care of her  cubs. Daddy Lion had to do multiple work for his family, until the cubs  were grown. Yet long before this time had come, their Dad had died and  been stuffed for a museum. How this first king of beasts in the  Netherlands came to his untimely end was on this wise.    Not satisfied with posing Leo in every posture, and with all possible  gestures, his master, the artist, wanted him to look \"heraldical\"; that  is, like some of the mythical beasts that were combinations of any and  all creatures having fins, fur, feathers, or scales, such as the dragon  or griffin. One day, he attempted to make out of a live lion a fanciful  creature of curlicues and curliewurlies. So he strapped the lion down,  and used a curling iron on his mane until he looked like a bearded bull  of Babylon. Then he combed out, and, with curl papers, twisted the long  line of hair, which is seen in front of Leo's stomach. In like manner,  he treated the bunches of hair that grow over the animal's kneepans and  elbows. Last of all, he took a hair brush, and smoothed out the tuft, at  the end of the animal's long tail. Then the artist made a picture of him  in this condition, all curled and rich in ringlets, like a dandy.    By this time, the father of the lion family looked as if he had come out  fresh from a hairdresser's parlor. Indeed, Mrs. Leo was so struck with  her husband's appearance, that she immediately licked her cubs all over,  until their fur shone, so they should look like their father. Then,  having used her tongue as a comb, to make her own skin smooth and  glossy, she completed the job by using the nail in her tail, to do the  finishing work. Altogether, this was the curliest family of lions ever  seen, and Daddy Leo appeared to be the funniest curly-headed and  curly-bodied lion ever seen. In fact he was all curls, from head to  tail.    Notwithstanding all his pains, the artist was not yet satisfied with his  job. He wanted a circle of long hair to grow in the middle of the lion's  tail. His curly lion should beat all creation, and in this way he  proceeded.    His own daughter, being a young lady and having some trouble of the  throat, the doctor had ordered medicine for the girl, charging her not  to spill any drops of the liquid on her face, or clothes.    But, in giving the dose, either the mother, or the daughter, was  careless. At that very moment the cat ran across the room, after the  mouse, and just as she held the spoon to her mouth, Puss got twisted in  her skirts. So most of the medicine splashed upon her upper lip and then  ran down to her chin, on either side of her mouth. She laughed over the  spill, wiped off the liquid, and thought no more of the matter.    But a week later, she was astonished. On waking, she looked in the  glass, only to shrink back in horror. On her face had grown both  moustaches and a beard. True, both were rather downy, but still they  were black; and, until the barber came, and shaved off the growth, she  was a bearded woman. Yet, strange to tell, after one or two shaves by  the barber, no more hair grew again on her face, which was smooth again.    \"By Saint Servatus! I'll make a fortune on this,\" cried the artist, when  he saw his daughter's hairy face.    So, he sold his secret to a druggist, and this man made an ointment,  giving it a Chinese name, meaning \"beard-grower.\" This wonderful  medicine, as his sign declared, would \"force the growth of luxuriant  moustaches and a beard, on the smoothest face of any young man,\" who  should buy and apply it.    Soon the whole town rang with the news of the wonderful discovery. The  druggist sold out his stock, in two days, to happy purchasers. Other  young fellows, that wanted to outrival their companions, had to wait a  fortnight for the new medicine to be made. By that time, a full crop of  downy hair had come out on the cheeks and chin and upper lip of many a  youth. Some, who had been trying for years to raise moustaches, in order  duly to impress the girls, to whom they were making love, were now  jubilant. In several cases, a lover was able to cut out his rival and  win the maid he wanted. Several courtings were hastened and became  genuine matches, because a face, long very smooth, and like a desert as  to hair, bore a promising crop. Beard and cheeks had at last met  together. So the new medicine was called a \"match-maker.\"    The artist rubbed his hands in glee, at the prospect of a fortune. He  argued that if the wonderful ointment made beards for men, it must be  good for lions also. So again, Daddy Lion was coerced by the threat of  the hot poker. Then his tail was seized, and, by means of a rope, tied  to a post on one side of the cage, he was held fast. Then the artist  anointed about six inches of the middle of the smooth tail with the  magic liquid. For fear the lion might lick it off, the poor beast was  held in this tiresome position for a whole week, so that he could not  turn round, and he nearly died of fatigue.    But it happened to the lion's tail, as it did with the young men's  chins, cheeks and upper lips. A beard did indeed grow, but once shaved  off--and many did shave, thinking to promote greater growth--no more  hair ever appeared again. The ointment forced a downy growth but it  killed the roots of the hair.    A worse fate befell the lion. A crop of hair, perhaps an inch longer  than common, grew out. But this time, the bad medicine, which had  deceived men, and was unfit for lions, struck in.    From this cause, added to nervous prostration, old Leo fell dead. As  lion fathers go, he was a good one, and his widow and children mourned  for him. He had never once, however hungry, tried to eat up his cubs,  which was something in his favor.    Soon after these exploits, the old artist died also. His son, hearing  there was still a demand, among kings, for lions, and those especially  with centre curls in their tails, took the most promising of the whelps  and petted and fed him well. In the seventh year, when his mane and  elbow and knee hair had grown out, this cub was mated to a young lioness  of like promise."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7882"],[0,"The Life of Kit Carson: Hunter, Trapper, Guide, Indian Agent and Colonel U.S.A. (#17)"],[1,"weather  was suffocatingly hot. Fierce storms of wind and gusts of rain swept  the country, while the bisons were everywhere. They literally numbered  hundreds of thousands, and, look in whatsoever direction the men chose,  they were sure to see the huge creatures cropping the grass or lumbering  across the prairie.    On the fourth day a band of three hundred mounted Indians suddenly  appeared. The chief proved to be an old acquaintance of Maxwell and  showed genuine pleasure in meeting him. They shook hands and the sachem  conducted the little party to his village, where they received most  hospitable treatment.    Resuming their journey, they encamped in a cottonwood grove in a chilly  drizzling rain. The next morning dawned bright and clear, and they  caught their first glimpse of the Rocky Mountains. They gazed long on  the snowy peaks outlined in the far distance like fleecy clouds against  the blue sky.    St. Vrain's Fort was reached on the tenth day. They were made welcome  by Mr. St. Vrain, who was much interested in the expedition westward and  did everything he could to assist Lieutenant Fremont in the enterprise.  The needed horses and mules were secured, and three men were hired to  accompany them across the country to Fort Laramie.    This station was a hundred and twenty-five miles distant, and the new  hands engaged, as a matter of course, were so familiar with it, that  there was no possibility of going astray. The journey was resumed on  the second day after reaching the fort, and without meeting with any  particular incident they arrived at their destination, three days later.    Fort Laramie, at that time, was one of the most important posts of the  far west. It had large bastions at the corners, and its high walls were  whitewashed and picketed.    Several lodges of Sioux Indians were pitched close by, and the division  under charge of Kit Carson having arrived several days before, had also  gone into camp with the appearance of the commander of the expedition.        CHAPTER XX       Alarming News--Fremont Presses Forward and is Not Molested--Arrival at   South Pass--Fremont's Account of the Ascent of the Highest Peak of   the Rocky Mountains--The Return to Fort Laramie--Carson Starts for New   Mexico--End of Fremont's First Exploring Expedition.    Alarming news awaited Fremont at Fort Laramie. A number of trappers  informed them that the Sioux, through whose country their route lay,  were excited to exasperation by several recent conflicts with hunters  in which the red men were worsted. The Sioux warriors were gathered in  large numbers and would attack any white men who ventured beyond the  fort. They had already massacred a number and it was impossible for  Fremont and his party to get through without a battle in which they were  likely to be overwhelmed.    Carson looked upon the situation as so serious that he made his will and  left it at the fort. When consulted by Fremont, he said he considered  the prospect full of peril, but he was ready to go the moment required.  The commander was confident the danger was greatly exaggerated, and,  without much misgiving, he resumed his journey westward, following up  the north fork of the Platte. Game and water were found, and, at the end  of three weeks, they arrived at the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains  without having exchanged a shot with a red man on the way.    They had now reached their destination and Lieutenant Fremont at once  began his observations. When they were concluded he undertook the  ascent of the highest mountain peak. The situation was anything but  encouraging: they were in the country of the hostile Blackfeet, some of  whom were observed hovering in the vicinity; men and animals were worn  out and it was hard to procure game. But the ascent was begun, Fremont  taking fourteen men with him. Those who were left in camp erected a rude  but strong fort, behind which they were confident they could sustain  themselves against any force the Indians were likely to muster.    The ascent of the mountain was laborious in the extreme. Kit Carson  climbed to one of the loftiest peaks from which he gained a full view of  the very highest elevation. The next day Fremont sent Carson and several  of the men back. He unquestionably intended that no one should share  with him the honor of climbing the most elevated point. This exploit is  worthy of description at the hands of the Pathfinder himself.    \"At intervals we reached places where a number of springs gushed from  the rocks, and about 1,800 feet above the lakes came to the snow line.  From this point our progress was uninterrupted climbing. Hitherto, I had  worn a pair of thick moccasins, with soles of parfleche but here I put  on a light thin pair, which I had brought for the purpose, as now the  use of our toes became necessary to a further advance. I availed myself  of a sort of comb of the mountain, which stood against the wall like  a buttress, and which the wind and solar radiation, joined to the  steepness of the smooth rock, had kept almost entirely free from snow.  Up this I made my way rapidly. Our cautious method of advancing in  the outset had spared my strength; and, with the exception of a slight  disposition to headache, I felt no remains of yesterday's illness. In a  few minutes we reached a point where the buttress was overhanging, and  there was no other way of surmounting the difficulty than by passing  around one side of it, which was the face of a vertical precipice of  several hundred feet.\"    Parfleche is the name given to buffalo hide. The Indian women prepare it  by scraping and drying. It is exceedingly tough and hard, and receives  its name from the circumstance that it cannot be pierced by arrows or  spears.    The entire dress of Fremont and his party, on their ascent to the \"top  of America,\" consisted of a blue flannel shirt, free and open at the  neck, the collar turning down over a black silk handkerchief tied  loosely, blue cloth pantaloons, a slouched broad brimmed hat, and  moccasins as above described. It was well adapted to climbing, quite  light, and at the same time warm, and every way comfortable.    \"Putting hands and feet in the crevices between the blocks, I succeeded  in getting over it, and when I reached the top, found my companions in a  small valley below. Descending to them, we continued climbing, and in a  short time reached the crest. I sprang upon the summit and another step  would have precipitated me into an immense snow field five hundred feet  below. To the edge of this field was a sheer icy precipice; and then,  with a gradual fall, the field sloped off for about a mile, until it  struck the foot of another lower ridge. I stood on a narrow crest about  three feet in width, with an inclination of about 20 degrees N. 51  degrees E. As soon as I had gratified the first feelings of curiosity I  descended, and each man ascended in turn, for I would only allow one  at a time to mount the unstable and precarious slab, which it seemed a  breath would hurl into the abyss below. We mounted the barometer in  the snow of the summit, and, fixing a ramrod in a crevice, unfurled the  national flag, to wave in the breeze, where never flag waved before.  During our morning's ascent, we met no sign of animal life, except a  small bird having the appearance of a sparrow. A stillness the most  profound, and a terrible solitude forced themselves constantly on the  mind as the great features of the place. Here, on the summit, where  the stillness was absolute, unbroken by any sound, and the solitude  complete, we thought ourselves beyond the region of animated life; but  while we were sitting on the rock, a solitary bee (bombus terrestris,  the humble bee) came winging his flight from the eastern valley, and lit  on the knee of one of the men.    \"Around us the whole scene had one main striking feature, which was that  of terrible convulsion. Parallel to its length, the ridge was split  into chasms and fissures, between which rose the thin, lofty walls,  terminated with slender minarets and columns, which are correctly  represented in the view from the camp on Island Lake. According to the  barometer, the little crest of the wall on which we stood was three  thousand five hundred and seventy feet above that place, and two  thousand seven hundred and eighty feet above the little lakes at the  bottom, immediately at our feet.    \"Our camp at the Two Hills (an astronomical station) bore south 30 east,  which, with a bearing afterward obtained from a fixed position, enabled  us to locate the peak. The bearing of the Trois Tetons was north 50  degrees west, and the direction of the central ridge of the Wind River  Mountains south 39 degrees east. The summit rock was gneiss. Sienite  and feldspar succeeded in our descent to the snow line, where we found  a felspathic granite. I had remarked that the noise produced by the  explosion of our pistols had the usual degree of loudness, but was not  in the least prolonged, expiring almost instantaneously. Having now made  what observations our means afforded, we proceeded to descend. We had  accomplished an object of laudable ambition, and beyond the strict  order of our instructions. We had climbed the loftiest peak of the Rocky  Mountains and looked down upon the snow a thousand feet below, and,  standing where human foot had never stood before, felt the exultation of  first explorers. It was about two o'clock when we left the summit; and  when we reached the bottom the sun had already sunk behind the wall, and  the day was drawing to a close. It would have been pleasant to linger  here and on the summit longer; but we hurried away as rapidly as the  ground would permit, for it was an object to regain our party as soon as  possible, not knowing what accident the next hour might bring forth.\"    This mountain which bears the name of Fremont's Peak, in honor of the  great Pathfinder, was found to"]]]
