The mean of the three is 32  degrees 14 minutes 55 seconds. And again at 7 hours 12 minutes 52  seconds, per sun and moon, 32 degrees 10 minutes 4 seconds; and at 7  hours 19 minutes 42 seconds, per sun and moon, 32 degrees 15 minutes 20  seconds. The mean of these two is 32 degrees 12 minutes 42 seconds, and  the mean of the whole is 32 degrees 13 minutes 43 seconds West from  Greenwich, which is less by a whole Degree than that by account, which is  a Considerable Error to be made in 5 Days in these low Latitudes. One  would think from this that we must have had a Current setting to the  Eastward, which is not likely that it should set against the settled  trade wind. The 3 first of these Observations were made by Mr. Green, and  the 2 last by myself. Wind East-South-East, South; course South by West;  distance 132 miles; latitude 12 degrees 48 minutes South, longitude 32  degrees 20 minutes West per Observation.    Thursday, 3rd. A Fresh Trade wind and fair weather. Variation per Azimuth  this Evening 0 degrees 47 minutes East, and at a little past 9 a.m.  longitude in per sun and moon 33 degrees 0 minutes West of Greenwich.  Wind East by South-East; course South 15 degrees West; distance 128  miles; latitude 14 degrees 51 minutes South, longitude 33 degrees 7  minutes West.    Friday, 4th. A Steady Gale and fair weather. P.M. Variation per Azimuth 1  degree 29 minutes West, ditto 1 degree 28 minutes West, and by the  Amplitude 1 degree 12 minutes West; mean 1 degree 23 minutes West, by  which it appears that we have again Crossed the Line of no Variation. At  1/2 past 9 a.m. the longitude of the Ship, per Observation of the sun and  moon, 33 degrees 26 minutes 30 seconds. Wind East by South; course South  19 degrees 30 minutes West; distance 125 miles; latitude 16 degrees 49  minutes South, longitude 33 degrees 37 minutes West.    Saturday, 5th. Fine pleasant weather. Variation per Azimuth this morning  3 degrees 21 minutes East, which makes me Doubtful of the Variation found  yesterday, tho' at the time I had not the least room to doubt of the  Accuracy of the Observations. Longitude per Observation 34 degrees 43  minutes 30 seconds West. Wind East to North-East; course South 30 degrees  35 minutes West; distance 109 miles; latitude 18 degrees 22 minutes  South, longitude 34 degrees 50 minutes West.    Sunday, 6th. First and Latter part squally, with heavy Showers of rain;  middle moderate and fair. I now determined to put into Rio de Janeiro in  preferance to any other port in Brazil or Falkland Islands, for at this  place I knew we could recruit our Stock of Provisions, several Articles  of which I found we should in time be in want of, and at the same time  procure Live Stock and refreshment for the People; and from the reception  former Ships had met with here I doubted not but we should be well  received. Wind North-North-East, variable, South; course South 55 degrees  West; distance 74 miles; latitude 19 degrees 3 minutes South, longitude  35 degrees 50 minutes West.    Monday, 7th. Moderate breezes and Clear weather. P.M. found the Variation  to be 4 degrees 49 minutes East. At 6 Sounded and had 32 fathoms Water;  the Bottom Coral Rocks, fine Sand and Shells, which Soundings we carried  upon a South-West 1/2 West Course 9 or 10 leagues, and then had no ground  with 100 fathom. We were by our account and per run afterwards 54 Leagues  East from the Coast of Brazil and to the Southward of the Shoals called  Abrollos, as they are laid down in Most Charts. Wind South-East to  North-East; course South 58 degrees West; distance 68 miles; latitude 19  degrees 46 minutes South, longitude 36 degrees 50 minutes West.    Tuesday, 8th. Fresh breezes and Cloudy weather. P.M. variation by the  Mean of 12 Azimuths 5 degrees 26 minutes East, and by an Amplitude in the  Morning 7 degrees 52 minutes. At 6 a.m. saw the Land of Brazil bearing  North-West 1/2 North, distance 8 or 10 leagues. At 8 Sounded, had 37  fathoms, Coarse Sand, broken Shells, and Coral Rocks. At 9 brought too  and Spoke with a Fishing Boat, who informed us that the land in sight lay  to the Southward of Santo Espiritu. It appears high and Mountainous; the  drawing Number (3) exhibits a View of this Land as it appeared from the  Ship (A), being near to Santo Espiritu, and a remarkable hill (B) bore  North-West 1/2 North, distance 7 or 8 leagues. Made Sail in Shore, the  wind being Southerly. Had from the above Depth to 14 fathoms the same  sort of Bottom. Found the Ship at Noon by Observation 10 Miles to the  Southward of account, which I suppose to be occasioned by a Current  setting between the South and West. Wind North-North-East, North by West,  South-South-West to South by West; course South 50 degrees West; distance  140 miles; latitude 21 degrees 16 minutes South, longitude 37 degrees 35  minutes West.    Wednesday, 9th. First and Latter part Hazey, with a Moderate Breeze;  Middle, fresh Gales, with Thunder, Lightning, and rain. At 3 p.m. tack't  in 16 fathoms, distance from the Shore 5 Leagues, the land Extending from  the North-West by West to North-East. At 5 took the 2nd Reef in the  Topsails and got down Topgallant Yards, stood to the South-East until  Midnight, then tack'd, Sounding from 16 to 55 fathoms. At 8 a.m. Loosed  the Reefs out of the Topsails and got Topgallant Yards a Cross; unstowed  the Anchors and bent the Cables. At Noon Latitude Observed 21 degrees 29  minutes South, the Land Extending from South-West by South to  North-North-West, distance 4 leagues, Soundings from 55 to 10 fathoms.  Wind South-South-East, South-South-West, South; course South 62 degrees  15 minutes West; distance 28 miles; latitude 21 degrees 29 minutes South.    [Nearing Rio Janeiro.]    Thursday, 10th. Moderate breezes and Hazey upon the Land. Stood in for  the Shore South-West 1/2 West. Depth of water from 10 to 9 fathoms and  from 9 to 16 fathoms, being then 4 Leagues from the Land. From 16 fathoms  it shoalded gradually to 5 fathoms; then we tacked, being about 1 1/2  Leagues from the Shore. The extreams of the Land to the Southward, which  we took for Cape St. Thomas, bore South 3/4 West, distance 4 leagues. The  Land from Cape St. Thomas to the Northward lies North by East 1/2 East.  Along the Shore is low land covered with Wood and Sandy Beaches, but  inland are very high Mountains, the greatest part of them being hid in  the Clouds. Stood off until 5 in the Morning East and East by South.  Depth of Water 10, 20, 16, 23, and 30 fathoms. At Noon Latitude Observed  21 degrees 30 minutes; Depth of Water 14 fathoms; Grey sand with black  Specks. Extreams of the Land from South-West by West to North-North-West;  distance 12 or 14 leagues. Wind South-South-East, South-East by South,  South by East; course East 1/4 South; distance 17 miles; latitude 21  degrees 30 minutes South, longitude 37 degrees 43 minutes West per  account.    Friday, 11th. First and Latter parts, moderate breezes and fair, but  Cloudy and Hazey over the Land; middle, a fresh breeze and Cloudy. At 8  tack'd and Stood to the North-East. Extream of the Land to the southward,  which we took for Cape St. Thomas, South-West 1/2 South; distance 5 or 6  leagues; Depth of Water 13 fathoms, Grey sand. At 11 a.m. tack'd in 14  fathoms and Stood to the South-South-East, and at 3 a.m. Stood over a  Shoal or Bank of 6 fathoms, afterwards the Depth increased to 30 fathoms,  at Noon in 36 fathoms. Latitude Observed 22 degrees 37 minutes South,  which is 10 miles to the Southward of the Log. No Land in sight. Wind  South-East to East; course South 5 degrees West; distance 67 miles;  latitude 23 degrees 37 minutes South, longitude 37 degrees 49 minutes  West.    Saturday, 12th. Genteel breezes and fine Clear weather. At 2 p.m.  Sounded, but had no ground with 38 fathoms, and soon after sounded and  had none at 50 fathoms, from which it appears that we are to the  Southward of the Bank we have been upon this 2 days past. It Extends off  from the Land between the Latitude 21 degrees and 22 degrees nor less  than 18 or 20 Leagues, How much farther I know not. Standing in from Sea,  the Depth of Water very soon diminisheth from 30 to 20 and 17 fathoms,  afterwards gradually from 9, 8 and even to 6 fathoms; but between this  Shoal Water and the Main, which is 6 or 7 leagues, you will have 10, 12  and even 16 fathoms, till you come within 2 or 3 leagues of the Shore.  The Bottom is of Various kinds, sometimes Coral Rocks, Coral Rocks and  broken Shells, Coarse sand and broken Shells, Small Stones and at other  times fine Sand varying at almost every Cast of the Lead. At 5 p.m. saw  the Land bearing North-West by West 1/2 West, distance 10 or 12 leagues,  which proved to be the Island of Cape Frio; it appeared in two Hillocks,  and from the Deck looked like two Islands. Took several Azimuth of the  Sun, which gave the Variation 6 degrees 40 minutes East. At 8 a.m. the  Isle of Cape Frio bore West by North 4 leagues. This Island is situated  in the Latitude of 23 degrees 2 minutes South, and according to our  Reckoning in the Longitude of 38 degrees 45 minutes West from Greenwich,  but from many Circumstances I have good reason to think that our  reckoning is wrong and that it lies in the Longitude 41 degrees 10  minutes West. It is not of a Large Circuit, but Tolerable high, with a  hollow in the Middle, which makes it look like 2 Islands when it first  makes its appearance out of the Water. It lays not far from the Main,  which with the Island forms a right Angle, one side trending North and  the other West. To the northward of the Island and between it and the  Main there appears to lay several smaller Islands near each other. The  Main land on the Sea Coast appears to be low, but inland are high  Mountains."]]]
