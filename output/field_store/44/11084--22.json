Stevenson felt it and     confessed it about the _Ebb-Tide_, and Huish, the cockney hero and     villain; but the sense of healthy disgust, even at the vile Huish, is     not emphasised in the book as it would have demanded to be for the     stage--the audience would not have stood it, and the more mixed and     varied, the less would it have stood it--not at all; and his relief of     style and fine or finished speeches would not _there_ in the least     have told.  This is demanded of the drama--that at once it satisfies a     certain crude something subsisting under all outward glosses and     veneers that might be in some a lively sense of right and wrong--the     uprisal of a conscience, in fact, or in others a vague instinct of     proper reward or punishment, which will even cover and sanction     certain kinds of revenge or retaliation.  The one feeling will emerge     most among the cultured, and the other among the ruder and more     ignorant; but both meet immediately on beholding action and the limits     of action on the demand for some clear leading to what may be called     Providential equity--each man undoubtedly rewarded or punished,     roughly, according to his deserts, if not outwardly then certainly in     the inner torments that so often lead to confessions.  There it is--a     radical fact of human nature--as radical as any reading of trait or     determination of character presented--seen in the Greek drama as well     as in Shakespeare and the great Elizabethan dramatists, and in the     drama-transpontine and others of to-day.  R. L. Stevenson was all too     casuistical (though not in the exclusively bad sense) for this; and so     he was not dramatic, though _Weir of Hermiston_ promised something     like an advance to it, and _St Ives_ did, in my idea, yet more.\"    The one essential of a _dramatic_ piece is that, by the interaction of  character and incident (one or other may be preponderating, according to  the type and intention of the writer) all naturally leads up to a crisis  in which the moral motives, appealed to or awakened by the presentation  of the play, are justified.  Where this is wanting the true leading and  the definite justification are wanting.  Goethe failed in this in his  _Faust_, resourceful and far-seeing though he was--he failed because a  certain sympathy is awakened for Mephistopheles in being, so to say,  chivied out of his bargain, when he had complied with the terms of the  contract by Faust; and Gounod in his opera does exactly for \"immediate  dramatic effect,\" what we hold it would be necessary to do for R. L.  Stevenson.  Goethe, with his casuistries which led him to allegory and  all manner of overdone symbolisms and perversions in the Second Part, is  set aside and a true crisis and close is found by Gounod through simply  sending Marguerite above and Faust below, as, indeed, Faust had agreed by  solemn compact with Mephistopheles that it should be.  And to come to  another illustration from our own times, Mr Bernard Shaw's very clever  and all too ingenious and over-subtle _Man and Superman_ would, in my  idea, and for much the same reason, be an utterly ineffective and weak  piece on the stage, however carefully handled and however clever the  setting--the reason lying in the egotistic upsetting of the \"personal  equation\" and the theory of life that lies behind all--tinting it with  strange and even _outre_ colours.  Much the same has to be said of most  of what are problem-plays--several of Ibsen's among the rest.    Those who remember the Fairy opera of _Hansel and Gretel_ on the stage in  London, will not have forgotten in the witching memory of all the charms  of scenery and setting, how the scene where the witch of the wood, who  was planning out the baking of the little hero and heroine in her oven,  having \"fatted\" them up well, to make sweet her eating of them, was by  the coolness and cleverness of the heroine locked in her own oven and  baked there, literally brought down the house.  She received exactly what  she had planned to give those children, whom their own cruel parents had  unwittingly, by losing the children in the wood, put into her hands.  Quaint, naive, half-grotesque it was in conception, yet the truth of all  drama was there actively exhibited, and all casuistic pleading of excuses  of some sort, even of justification for the witch (that it was her  nature; heredity in her aworking, etc., etc.) would have not only been  out of place, but hotly resented by that audience.  Now, Stevenson, if he  could have made up his mind to have the witch locked in her own oven,  would most assuredly have tried some device to get her out by some fairy  witch-device or magic slide at the far end of it, and have proceeded to  paint for us the changed character that she was after she had been so  outwitted by a child, and her witchdom proved after all of little effect.  He would have put probably some of the most effective moralities into her  mouth if indeed he would not after all have made the witch a triumph on  his early principle of bad-heartedness being strength.  If this is the  sort of falsification which the play demands, and is of all tastes the  most ungrateful, then, it is clear, that for full effect of the drama it  is essential to it; but what is primary in it is the direct answering to  certain immediate and instinctive demands in common human nature, the  doing of which is far more effective than no end of deep philosophy to  show how much better human nature would be if it were not just quite thus  constituted.  \"Concentration,\" says Mr Pinero, \"is first, second, and  last in it,\" and he goes on thus, as reported in the _Scotsman_, to show  Stevenson's defect and mistake and, as is not, of course, unnatural, to  magnify the greatness and grandeur of the style of work in which he has  himself been so successful.       \"If Stevenson had ever mastered that art--and I do not question that     if he had properly conceived it he had it in him to master it--he     might have found the stage a gold mine, but he would have found, too,     that it is a gold mine which cannot be worked in a smiling, sportive,     half-contemptuous spirit, but only in the sweat of the brain, and with     every mental nerve and sinew strained to its uttermost.  He would have     known that no ingots are to be got out of this mine, save after     sleepless nights, days of gloom and discouragement, and other days,     again, of feverish toil, the result of which proves in the end to be     misapplied and has to be thrown to the winds. . . . When you take up a     play-book (if ever you do take one up) it strikes you as being a very     trifling thing--a mere insubstantial pamphlet beside the imposing bulk     of the latest six-shilling novel.  Little do you guess that every page     of the play has cost more care, severer mental tension, if not more     actual manual labour, than any chapter of a novel, though it be fifty     pages long.  It is the height of the author's art, according to the     old maxim, that the ordinary spectator should never be clearly     conscious of the skill and travail that have gone to the making of the     finished product.  But the artist who would achieve a like feat must     realise its difficulties, or what are his chances of success?\"    But what I should, in little, be inclined to say, in answer to the  \"concentration\" idea is that, unless you have first some firm hold on the  broad bed-rock facts of human nature specially appealed to or called  forth by the drama, you may concentrate as much as you please, but you  will not write a successful acting drama, not to speak of a great one.  Mr  Pinero's magnifications of the immense effort demanded from him must in  the end come to mean that he himself does not instinctively and with  natural ease and spontaneity secure this, but secures it only after great  conscious effort; and hence, perhaps, it is that he as well as so many  other modern playwrights fall so far behind alike in the amount turned  out, and also in its quality as compared with the products of many  playwrights in the past.    The problem drama, in every phase and turn of it, endeavours to dispense  with these fundamental demands implied in the common and instinctive  sense or consciousness of the mass of men and women, and to substitute  for that interest something which will artificially supersede it, or, at  any rate, take its place.  The interest is transferred from the crises  necessarily worked up to in the one case, with all of situation and  dialogue directed to it, and without which it would not be strictly  explicable, to something abnormal, odd, artificial or inverted, or  exceptional in the characters themselves.  Having thus, instead of  natural process and sequence, if we may put it so, the problem dramatist  has a double task--he must gain what unity he can, and reach such crises  as he may by artificial aids and inventions which the more he uses the  more makes natural simplicity unattainable; and next he must reduce and  hide as far as he can the abnormality he has, after all, in the long run,  created and presented.  He cannot maintain it to the full, else his work  would become a mere medical or psychological treatise under the poorest  of disguises; and the very necessity for the action and reaction of  characters upon each other is a further element against him.  In a word  no one character can stand alone, and cannot escape influencing others,  and also the action.  Thus it is that he cannot isolate as a doctor does  his patient for scientific examination.  The healthy and normal must come  in to modify on all sides what is presented of unhealthy and abnormal,  and by its very presence expose the other, while at the same time it, by  its very presence, ministers improvement, exactly as the sunlight"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5921"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 1, Complete (#17)"],[1,"warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in  which he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the  carriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels  already mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him  kneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating  some devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand and  gave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a smart  slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth as if he  was saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of the ladies  to gird on his sword, which she did with great self-possession and  gravity, and not a little was required to prevent a burst of laughter at  each stage of the ceremony; but what they had already seen of the novice  knight's prowess kept their laughter within bounds. On girding him with  the sword the worthy lady said to him, \"May God make your worship a very  fortunate knight, and grant you success in battle.\" Don Quixote asked her  name in order that he might from that time forward know to whom he was  beholden for the favour he had received, as he meant to confer upon her  some portion of the honour he acquired by the might of his arm. She  answered with great humility that she was called La Tolosa, and that she  was the daughter of a cobbler of Toledo who lived in the stalls of  Sanchobienaya, and that wherever she might be she would serve and esteem  him as her lord. Don Quixote said in reply that she would do him a favour  if thenceforward she assumed the \"Don\" and called herself Dona Tolosa.  She promised she would, and then the other buckled on his spur, and with  her followed almost the same conversation as with the lady of the sword.  He asked her name, and she said it was La Molinera, and that she was the  daughter of a respectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don  Quixote requested that she would adopt the \"Don\" and call herself Dona  Molinera, making offers to her further services and favours.    Having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these  never-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he saw  himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddling  Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he returned  thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in language so  extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it.  The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoric  though with shorter words, and without calling upon him to pay the  reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.          CHAPTER IV.    OF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT THE INN      Day was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, so  exhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his joy was like  to burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of his host as  to the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring  to money and shirts, he determined to go home and provide himself with  all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing a  farm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very  well qualified for the office of squire to a knight. With this object he  turned his horse's head towards his village, and Rocinante, thus reminded  of his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly seemed to  tread the earth.    He had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to  come feeble cries as of some one in distress, and the instant he heard  them he exclaimed, \"Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me,  that it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I  have undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries, no  doubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing my aid  and protection;\" and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction  whence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces into the  wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and  stripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age,  from whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer  was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings  and commands, repeating, \"Your mouth shut and your eyes open!\" while the  youth made answer, \"I won't do it again, master mine; by God's passion I  won't do it again, and I'll take more care of the flock another time.\"    Seeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice,  \"Discourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defend  himself; mount your steed and take your lance\" (for there was a lance  leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), \"and I will make you  know that you are behaving as a coward.\" The farmer, seeing before him  this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his head, gave  himself up for dead, and made answer meekly, \"Sir Knight, this youth that  I am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watch a flock of sheep  that I have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose one every day, and  when I punish him for his carelessness and knavery he says I do it out of  niggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I owe him, and before God,  and on my soul, he lies.\"    \"Lies before me, base clown!\" said Don Quixote. \"By the sun that shines  on us I have a mind to run you through with this lance. Pay him at once  without another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an end  of you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly.\"          The farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of whom  Don Quixote asked how much his master owed him.    He replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it up,  found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay it  down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.    The trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had sworn  (though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there were to be  taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him,  and a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.    \"All that is very well,\" said Don Quixote; \"but let the shoes and the  blood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him  without any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid  for, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood from  him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on that  score he owes you nothing.\"    \"The difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andres  come home with me, and I will pay him all, real by real.\"    \"I go with him!\" said the youth. \"Nay, God forbid! No, senor, not for the  world; for once alone with me, he would ray me like a Saint Bartholomew.\"    \"He will do nothing of the kind,\" said Don Quixote; \"I have only to  command, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order of  knighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee the  payment.\"    \"Consider what you are saying, senor,\" said the youth; \"this master of  mine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for he  is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.\"    \"That matters little,\" replied Don Quixote; \"there may be Haldudos  knights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works.\"    \"That is true,\" said Andres; \"but this master of mine--of what works is  he the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?\"    \"I do not refuse, brother Andres,\" said the farmer, \"be good enough to  come along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there are  in the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and perfumed.\"    \"For the perfumery I excuse you,\" said Don Quixote; \"give it to him in  reals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn;  if not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and punish  you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard. And  if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you, that you be  more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous Don Quixote of  La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so, God be with you,  and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn under those penalties  that have been already declared to you.\"    So saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The  farmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared  the wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and  said, \"Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that  undoer of wrongs has commanded me.\"    \"My oath on it,\" said Andres, \"your worship will be well advised to obey  the command of that good knight--may he live a thousand years--for, as he  is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he will come  back and do as he said.\"    \"My oath on it, too,\" said the farmer; \"but as I have a strong affection  for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment;\" and  seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave him such a  flogging that he left him for dead.    \"Now, Master Andres,\" said the farmer, \"call on the undoer of wrongs; you  will find he won't undo that, though I am not sure that I have quite done  with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.\" But at last he  untied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put  the sentence pronounced into execution.    Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look  for the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what had  happened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for all  that, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.    Thus did "]]]
