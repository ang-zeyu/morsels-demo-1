Their fellow-rebels were less fortunate. Roger surrendered himself to be  tried by the king's court, and was condemned \"according to the Norman  law,\" we are told, to the forfeiture of his estates and to imprisonment  at the king's pleasure. From this he was never released. The family of  William's devoted guardian, Osbern, and of his no less devoted friend,  William Fitz Osbern, disappears from English history with the fall of  this imprudent representative, but not from the country. It has been  reserved for modern scholarship co prove the interesting fact of the  continuance for generations of the male line of this house, though in  minor rank and position, through the marriage of the son of Earl Roger,  with the heiress of Abergavenny in Wales.[12] The fate of Waltheof was  even more pathetic because less deserved. He had no part in the actual  rebellion. Whatever he may have sworn to do, under the influence of the  earls of stronger character, he speedily repented and made confession to  Lanfranc as to his spiritual adviser. Lanfranc urged him to cross at once  to Normandy and make his confession to the king himself. William received  him kindly, showed no disposition to regard the fault as a serious one,  and apparently promised him his forgiveness. Why, on his return to  England, he should have arrested him, and after two trials before his  court should have allowed him to be executed, \"according to English law,\"  we do not surely know. The hatred of his wife Judith, the king's niece,  is plainly implied, but is hardly enough to account for so radical a  departure from William's usual practice in this the only instance of a  political execution in his reign. English sympathy plainly took the side  of the earl. The monks of the abbey at Crowland, which he had favoured in  his lifetime, were allowed the possession of his body. Soon miracles were  wrought there, and he became, in the minds of monks and people, an  unquestioned martyr and saint.    This was the end of William's troubles in England which have any real  connexion with the Conquest. Malcolm of Scotland invaded Northumberland  once more, and harried that long-suffering region, but without result;  and an army of English barons, led by the king's son Robert, which  returned the invasion soon after, was easily able to force the king of  the Scots to renew his acknowledgment of subjection to England. The  failure of Walcher, Bishop of Durham, to keep his own subordinates in  order, led to a local riot, in which the bishop and many of his officers  and clergy were murdered, and which was avenged in his usual pitiless  style by the king's brother Odo. William himself invaded Wales with a  large force; received submissions, and opened the way for the extension  of the English settlements in that country. The great ambition of Bishop  Odo, and the increase of wealth and power which had come to him through  the generosity of his brother, led him to hope for still higher things,  and he dreamed of becoming pope. This was not agreeable to William, and  may even have seemed dangerous to him when the bishop began to collect  his friends and vassals for an expedition to Italy. Archbishop Lanfranc,  who had not found his brother prelate a comfortable neighbour in Kent,  suggested to the king, we are told, the exercise of his feudal rights  against him as his baron. The scene must have been a dramatic one, when  in a session of the curia regis William ordered his brother's arrest, and  when no one ventured to execute the order laid hands upon him himself,  exclaiming that he arrested, not the Bishop of Bayeux, but the Earl of  Kent. William must have had some strong reason for this action, for he  refused to consent to the release of his brother as long as he lived. At  one time what seemed like a great danger threatened from Denmark, in the  plans of King Canute to invade England with a vast host and deliver the  country from the foreigner. William brought over from Normandy a great  army of mercenaries to meet this danger, and laid waste the country  along the eastern coast that the enemy might find no supplies on landing;  but this Danish threat amounted to even less than the earlier ones, for  the fleet never so much as appeared off the coast. All these events are  but the minor incidents which might occur in any reign; the Conquest had  long been finished, and England had accepted in good faith her new  dynasty.    Much more of the last ten years of William's life was spent in Normandy  than in England. Revolts of unruly barons, attacks on border towns or  castles, disputes with the king of France, were constantly occupying him  with vexatious details, though with nothing of serious import. Most  vexatious of all was the conduct of his son Robert. With the eldest son  of William opens in English history a long line of the sons and brothers  of kings, in a few cases of kings themselves, who are gifted with popular  qualities, who make friends easily, but who are weak in character, who  cannot control men or refuse favours, passionate and selfish, hardly  strong enough to be violently wicked as others of the line are, but  causes of constant evil to themselves and their friends, and sometimes to  the state. And with him opens also the long series of quarrels in the  royal family, of which the French kings were quick to take advantage, and  from which they were in the end to gain so much. The ground of Robert's  rebellion was the common one of dissatisfaction with his position and his  father's refusal to part with any of his power in his favour. Robert was  not able to excite any real insurrection in Normandy, but with the aid of  his friends and of the French king he maintained a border war for some  time, and defended castles with success against the king. He is said  even, in one encounter, to have wounded and been on the point of slaying  his father. For some time he wandered in exile in the Rhine valley,  supported by gifts sent him by his mother, in spite of the prohibition of  her husband. Once he was reconciled with his father, only to begin his  rebellion again. When the end came, William left him Normandy, but people  thought at least that he did it unwillingly, foreseeing the evil which  his character was likely to bring on any land over which he ruled.    The year 1086 is remarkable for the formation of one of the most unique  monuments of William's genius as a ruler, and one of the most instructive  sources of information which we have of the condition of England during  his reign. At the Christmas meeting of the court, in 1085, it was  decided, apparently after much debate and probably with special reference  to the general land-tax, called the Danegeld, to form by means of  inquiries, officially made in each locality, a complete register of the  occupied lands of the kingdom, of their holders, and of their values. The  book in which the results of this survey of England were recorded was  carefully preserved in the royal treasury, and soon came to be regarded  as conclusive evidence in disputed questions which its entries would  concern. Not very long after the record was made it came to be popularly  known as the Domesday Book, and a hundred years later the writer on the  English financial system of the twelfth century, the author of the  \"Dialogue concerning the Exchequer,\"[13] explained the name as meaning  that the sentences derived from it were final, and without appeal, like  those of the last great day.    An especially interesting feature of this survey is the method which was  employed to make it. Two institutions which were brought into England by  the Conquest, the king's missi and the inquest, the forerunners of the  circuit judge and of the jury, were set in motion for this work; and the  organization of the survey is a very interesting foreshadowing of the  organization which a century later William's great-grandson was to give  to our judicial system in features which still characterize it, not  merely in England but throughout great continents of which William never  dreamed. Royal commissioners, or missi, were sent into each county. No  doubt the same body of commissioners went throughout a circuit of  counties. In each the county court was summoned to meet the  commissioners, just as later it was summoned to meet the king's justice  on his circuit. The whole \"county\" was present to be appealed to on  questions of particular importance or difficulty if it seemed necessary,  but the business of the survey as a rule was not done by the county  court. Each hundred was present by its sworn jury, exactly as in the  later itinerant justice court, and it was this jury which answered on  oath the questions submitted to it by the commissioners, exactly again as  in the later practice. Their knowledge might be reinforced, or their  report modified, by evidence of the men of the vill, or other smaller  sub-division of the county, who probably attended as in the older county  courts, and occasionally by the testimony of the whole shire; but in  general the information on which the survey was made up was derived from  the reports of the hundred juries. The questions which were submitted to  these juries show both the object of the survey and its thorough  character. They were required to tell the name of each manor and the name  of its holder in the time of King Edward and at the time of the inquiry;  the number of hides it contained; the number of ploughs employed in the  cultivation of the lord's domain land, and the number so used on the  lands held by the lord's men,--a rough way of determining the amount of  land under cultivation. Then the population of the manor was to be given  in classes: freemen and sokemen; villeins, cotters, and serfs; the amount  of forest and meadow; the number of pastures, mills, and fish-ponds; and  what the value of the manor was in the time "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8559"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 360, November 25, 1882 (#17)"],[1,"gives account is the  increase in the number of farms. The number has virtually doubled within  twenty years. The population of the country has not increased in like  proportion. A large part of the increase in number of farms has been due  to the division of great estates. Nor has this occurred, as some may  imagine, exclusively in the Southern States and the States to which  immigration and migration have recently been directed. It is an  important fact that the multiplication of farms has continued even in  the older Northern States, though the change has not been as great in  these as in States of the far West or the South. In New York there has  been an increase of 25,000, or 11.5 per cent, in the number of farms  since 1870; in New Jersey the increase has been 12.2 per cent., and in  Pennsylvania 22.7 per cent., though the increase in population, and  doubtless in the number of persons engaged in farming, has been much  smaller. Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois also, have been considered fully  settled States for years, at least in an agricultural point of view, and  yet the number of farms has increased 26.1 per cent, in ten years in  Ohio, 20.3 percent, in Indiana, and 26.1 per cent, in Illinois. The  obvious explanation is that the growth of many cities and towns has  created a market for a far greater supply of those products which may be  most advantageously grown upon farms of moderate size; but even if this  fully accounts for the phenomenon, the change must be recognized as one  of the highest importance industrially, socially, and politically. The  man who owns or rents and cultivates a farm stands on a very different  footing from the laborer who works for wages. It is not a small matter  that, in these six States alone, there are 205,000 more owners or  managers of farms than there were only a decade ago.    As we go further toward the border, west or north, the influence of the  settlement of new land is more distinctly felt. Even in Michigan, where  new railroads have opened new regions to settlement, the increase in  number of farms has been over 55 per cent. In Wisconsin, though the  increase in railroad mileage has been about the same as in Michigan, the  reported increase in number of farms has been only 28 per cent., but in  Iowa it rises to 60 per cent., and in Minnesota to nearly 100 per cent.  In Kansas the number of farms is 138,561, against 38,202 in 1870; in  Nebraska 63,387, against 12,301; and in Dakota 17,435, against 1,720. In  these regions the process is one of creation of new States rather than a  change in the social and industrial condition of the population.    Some Southern States have gained largely, but the increase in these,  though very great, is less surprising than the new States of the  Northwest. The prevailing tendency of Southern agriculture to large  farms and the employment of many hands is especially felt in States  where land is still abundant. The greatest increase is in Texas, where  174,184 farms are reported, against 61,125 in 1870; in Florida, with  23,438 farms, against 10,241 in 1870; and in Arkansas, with 94,433  farms, against 49,424 in 1870. In Missouri 215,575 farms are reported,  against 148,228 in 1870. In these States, though social changes have  been great, the increase in number of farms has been largely due to new  settlements, as in the States of the far Northwest. But the change in  the older Southern States is of a different character.    Virginia, for example, has long been settled, and had 77,000 farms  thirty years ago. But the increase in number within the past ten years  has been 44,668, or 60.5 per cent. Contrasting this with the increase in  New York, a remarkable difference appears. West Virginia had few more  farms ten years ago than New Jersey; now it has nearly twice as many,  and has gained in number nearly 60 per cent. North Carolina, too, has  increased 78 per cent. in number of farms since 1870, and South Carolina  80 per cent. In Georgia the increase has been still greater--from 69,956  to 138,626, or nearly 100 per cent. In Alabama there are 135,864  farms, against 67,382 in 1870, an increase of over 100 per cent. These  proportions, contrasted with those for the older Northern States, reveal  a change that is nothing less than an industrial revolution. But the  force of this tendency to division of estates has been greatest in the  States named. Whereas the ratio of increase in number of farms becomes  greater in Northern States as we go from the East toward the Mississippi  River, at the South it is much smaller in Kentucky, Tennessee,  Mississippi, and Louisiana than in the older States on the Atlantic  coast. Thus in Louisiana the increase has been from 28,481 to 48,292  farms, or 70 per cent., and in Mississippi from 68,023 to 101,772 farms,  or less than 50 per cent., against 100 in Alabama and Georgia. In  Kentucky the increase has been from 118,422 to 166,453 farms, or 40 per  cent., and in Tennessee from 118,141 to 165,650 farms, or 40 per cent.,  against 60 in Virginia and West Virginia, and 78 in North Carolina.  Thus, while the tendency to division is far greater than in the Northern  States of corresponding age, it is found in full force only in six of  the older Southern States, Alabama, West Virginia, and four on the  Atlantic coast. In these, the revolution already effected foreshadows  and will almost certainly bring about important political changes within  a few years. In these six States there 310,795 more farm owners or  occupants than there were ten years ago.--_N.Y. Tribune_.           *       *       *       *       *          A FARMER'S LIME KILN.      For information about burning lime we republish the following article  furnished by a correspondent of the _Country Gentleman_ several years  ago:    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Fig. 2. Fig. 3. A (Fig. 1), Railway Track--B B B,  Iron Rods running through Kiln--C, Capstone over Arch--D, Arch--E, Well  without brick or ash lining.]    I send you a description and sketch of a lime-kiln put up on my premises  about five years ago. The dimensions of this kiln are 13 feet square by  25 feet high from foundation, and its capacity 100 bushels in 24 hours.  It was constructed of the limestone quarried on the spot. It has round  iron rods (shown in sketch) passing through, with iron plates fastened  to the ends as clamps to make it more firm; the pair nearest the top  should be not less than 2 feet from that point, the others interspersed  about 2 feet apart--the greatest strain being near the top. The arch  should be 7 feet high by 51/2 wide in front, with a gather on the top  and sides of about 1 foot, with plank floor; and if this has a little  incline it will facilitate shoveling the lime when drawn. The arch  should have a strong capstone; also one immediately under the well of  the kiln, with a hole 2 feet in diameter to draw the lime through; or  two may be used with semicircle cut in each. Iron bars 2 inches wide by  1/8 inch thick are used in this kiln for closing it, working in slots  fastened to capstone. These slots must be put in before the caps  are laid. When it is desired to draw lime, these bars may be  pushed laterally in the slots, or drawn out entirely, according to  circumstances; 3 bars will be enough. The slots are made of iron bars  11/2 inches wide, with ends rounded and turned up, and inserted in holes  drilled through capstone and keyed above.    The well of the kiln is lined with fire-brick one course thick, with a  stratum of coal ashes three inches thick tamped in between the brick  and wall, which proves a great protection to the wall. About 2,000  fire-bricks were used. The proprietors of this kiln say about one-half  the lower part of the well might have been lined with a first quality of  common brick and saved some expense and been just as good. The form of  the well shown in Fig. 3 is 7 feet in diameter in the bilge, exclusive  of the lining of brick and ashes. Experiments in this vicinity have  proved this to be the best, this contraction toward the top being  absolutely necessary, the expansion of the stone by the heat is so  great that the lime cannot be drawn from perpendicular walls, as was  demonstrated in one instance near here, where a kiln was built on that  principle. The kiln, of course, is for coal, and our stone requires  about three-quarters of a ton per 100 bushels of lime, but this, I am  told, varies according to quality, some requiring more than others; the  quantity can best be determined by experimenting; also the regulation of  the heat--if too great it will cause the stones to melt or run together  as it were, or, if too little, they will not be properly burned. The  business requires skill and judgment to run it successfully.    This kiln is located at the foot of a steep bluff, the top about level  with the top of the kiln, with railway track built of wooden sleepers,  with light iron bars, running from the bluff to the top of the kiln, and  a hand-car makes it very convenient filling the kiln. Such a location  should be had if possible. Your inquirer may perhaps get some ideas  of the principles of a kiln for using _coal_. The dimensions may be  reduced, if desired. If for _wood_, the arch would have to be formed for  that, and the height of kiln reduced.           *       *       *       *       *          THE MANUFACTURE OF APPLE JELLY.    [Footnote: From the report of the New York Agricultural Society.]      Within the county of Oswego, New York, Dewitt C. Peck reports there are  five apple jelly factories in operation. The failure of the apple crop,  for some singular and unexplained reason, does not extend in great  degree to the natural or ungrafted fruit. Though not so many as common,  even of these apples, there are yet enough to keep these five mills and  the numerous cider mills pretty well employed.
