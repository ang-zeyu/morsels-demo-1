Eighty, ninety, hundred,    Altogether dundred!'      The goblins fell back a little when he began, and made horrible  grimaces all through the rhyme, as if eating something so disagreeable  that it set their teeth on edge and gave them the creeps; but whether  it was that the rhyming words were most of them no words at all, for, a  new rhyme being considered the more efficacious, Curdie had made it on  the spur of the moment, or whether it was that the presence of the king  and queen gave them courage, I cannot tell; but the moment the rhyme  was over they crowded on him again, and out shot a hundred long arms,  with a multitude of thick nailless fingers at the ends of them, to lay  hold upon him.  Then Curdie heaved up his axe.  But being as gentle as  courageous and not wishing to kill any of them, he turned the end which  was square and blunt like a hammer, and with that came down a great  blow on the head of the goblin nearest him.  Hard as the heads of all  goblins are, he thought he must feel that.  And so he did, no doubt;  but he only gave a horrible cry, and sprung at Curdie's throat.  Curdie, however, drew back in time, and just at that critical moment  remembered the vulnerable part of the goblin body.  He made a sudden  rush at the king and stamped with all his might on His Majesty's feet.  The king gave a most unkingly howl and almost fell into the fire.  Curdie then rushed into the crowd, stamping right and left.  The  goblins drew back, howling on every side as he approached, but they  were so crowded that few of those he attacked could escape his tread;  and the shrieking and roaring that filled the cave would have appalled  Curdie but for the good hope it gave him.  They were tumbling over each  other in heaps in their eagerness to rush from the cave, when a new  assailant suddenly faced him--the queen, with flaming eyes and expanded  nostrils, her hair standing half up from her head, rushed at him. She  trusted in her shoes: they were of granite--hollowed like French  sabots.  Curdie would have endured much rather than hurt a woman, even  if she was a goblin; but here was an affair of life and death:  forgetting her shoes, he made a great stamp on one of her feet.  But  she instantly returned it with very different effect, causing him  frightful pain, and almost disabling him.  His only chance with her  would have been to attack the granite shoes with his pickaxe, but  before he could think of that she had caught him up in her arms and was  rushing with him across the cave.  She dashed him into a hole in the  wall, with a force that almost stunned him.  But although he could not  move, he was not too far gone to hear her great cry, and the rush of  multitudes of soft feet, followed by the sounds of something heaved up  against the rock; after which came a multitudinous patter of stones  falling near him.  The last had not ceased when he grew very faint, for  his head had been badly cut, and at last insensible.    When he came to himself there was perfect silence about him, and utter  darkness, but for the merest glimmer in one tiny spot.  He crawled to  it, and found that they had heaved a slab against the mouth of the  hole, past the edge of which a poor little gleam found its way from the  fire.  He could not move it a hairbreadth, for they had piled a great  heap of stones against it.  He crawled back to where he had been lying,  in the faint hope of finding his pickaxe, But after a vain search he  was at last compelled to acknowledge himself in an evil plight.  He sat  down and tried to think, but soon fell fast asleep.        CHAPTER 19    Goblin Counsels    He must have slept a long time, for when he awoke he felt wonderfully  restored--indeed almost well--and very hungry.  There were voices in  the outer cave.    Once more, then, it was night; for the goblins slept during the day and  went about their affairs during the night.    In the universal and constant darkness of their dwelling they had no  reason to prefer the one arrangement to the other; but from aversion to  the sun-people they chose to be busy when there was least chance of  their being met either by the miners below, when they were burrowing,  or by the people of the mountain above, when they were feeding their  sheep or catching their goats.  And indeed it was only when the sun was  away that the outside of the mountain was sufficiently like their own  dismal regions to be endurable to their mole eyes, so thoroughly had  they become unaccustomed to any light beyond that of their own fires  and torches.    Curdie listened, and soon found that they were talking of himself.    'How long will it take?' asked Harelip.    'Not many days, I should think,' answered the king.  'They are poor  feeble creatures, those sun-people, and want to be always eating. We  can go a week at a time without food, and be all the better for it; but  I've been told they eat two or three times every day!  Can you believe  it?  They must be quite hollow inside--not at all like us, nine-tenths  of whose bulk is solid flesh and bone.  Yes--I judge a week of  starvation will do for him.'    'If I may be allowed a word,' interposed the queen,--'and I think I  ought to have some voice in the matter--'    'The wretch is entirely at your disposal, my spouse,' interrupted the  king.  'He is your property.  You caught him yourself.  We should never  have done it.'    The queen laughed.  She seemed in far better humour than the night  before.    'I was about to say,' she resumed, 'that it does seem a pity to waste  so much fresh meat.'    'What are you thinking of, my love?' said the king.  'The very notion  of starving him implies that we are not going to give him any meat,  either salt or fresh.'    'I'm not such a stupid as that comes to,' returned Her Majesty. 'What I  mean is that by the time he is starved there will hardly be a picking  upon his bones.'    The king gave a great laugh.    'Well, my spouse, you may have him when you like,' he said.  'I don't  fancy him for my part.  I am pretty sure he is tough eating.'    'That would be to honour instead of punish his insolence,' returned the  queen.  'But why should our poor creatures be deprived of so much  nourishment?  Our little dogs and cats and pigs and small bears would  enjoy him very much.'    'You are the best of housekeepers, my lovely queen!' said her husband.  'Let it be so by all means.  Let us have our people in, and get him out  and kill him at once.  He deserves it.  The mischief he might have  brought upon us, now that he had penetrated so far as our most retired  citadel, is incalculable.  Or rather let us tie him hand and foot, and  have the pleasure of seeing him torn to pieces by full torchlight in  the great hall.'    'Better and better!' cried the queen and the prince together, both of  them clapping their hands.  And the prince made an ugly noise with his  hare-lip, just as if he had intended to be one at the feast.    'But,' added the queen, bethinking herself, 'he is so troublesome. For  poor creatures as they are, there is something about those sun-people  that is very troublesome.  I cannot imagine how it is that with such  superior strength and skill and understanding as ours, we permit them  to exist at all.  Why do we not destroy them entirely, and use their  cattle and grazing lands at our pleasure? Of course we don't want to  live in their horrid country!  It is far too glaring for our quieter  and more refined tastes.  But we might use it as a sort of outhouse,  you know.  Even our creatures' eyes might get used to it, and if they  did grow blind that would be of no consequence, provided they grew fat  as well.  But we might even keep their great cows and other creatures,  and then we should have a few more luxuries, such as cream and cheese,  which at present we only taste occasionally, when our brave men have  succeeded in carrying some off from their farms.'    'It is worth thinking of,' said the king; 'and I don't know why you  should be the first to suggest it, except that you have a positive  genius for conquest.  But still, as you say, there is something very  troublesome about them; and it would be better, as I understand you to  suggest, that we should starve him for a day or two first, so that he  may be a little less frisky when we take him out.'        'Once there was a goblin    Living in a hole;    Busy he was cobblin'    A shoe without a sole.      'By came a birdie:    \"Goblin, what do you do?\"    \"Cobble at a sturdie    Upper leather shoe.\"      '\"What's the good o' that, Sir?\"    Said the little bird.    \"Why it's very Pat, Sir--    Plain without a word.      '\"Where 'tis all a hole, Sir,    Never can be holes:    Why should their shoes have soles, Sir,    When they've got no souls?\"'      'What's that horrible noise?' cried the queen, shuddering from  pot-metal head to granite shoes.    'I declare,' said the king with solemn indignation, 'it's the  sun-creature in the hole!'    'Stop that disgusting noise!' cried the crown prince valiantly, getting  up and standing in front of the heap of stones, with his face towards  Curdie's prison.  'Do now, or I'll break your head.'    'Break away,' shouted Curdie, and began singing again:        'Once there was a goblin,    Living in a hole--'      'I really cannot bear it,' said the queen.  'If I could only get at his  horrid toes with my slippers again!'    'I think we had better go to bed,' said the king.    'It's not time to go to bed,' said the queen.    'I would if I was you,' said Curdie.    'Impertinent wretch!' said the queen, with the utmost scorn in her  voice.    'An impossible if,' said His Majesty with dignity.    'Quite,' returned Curdie, and began singing again:        'Go to bed,    Goblin, do.    Help the queen    Take off her shoe.

If I am to go to jail, all  right--take me; but whoever heard of a man walking there of his own  accord?\" and he whittled away at the stick in his hand feeling that he  was master of the situation. Being remanded until the next day, to keep  up some semblance of proper procedure, he went away quite contentedly,  only to return the next day and the next to repeat the same farce. At last  both magistrate and constable began to look rather tired, while the  prisoner, on the contrary, was quite at his ease. The wire was down between  us and Winnipeg, and no advice could be obtained. So at last the constable,  agreeing to forfeit his share of the fine, and the magistrate to take a  time-bill on the contractor for the next section of the railway for the  remaining twenty-five dollars, they let the man go, neither of them, I am  sure, seeing him depart with regret.    The next whisky seizure that occurred in the neighbourhood was a small  two-gallon keg, found in the middle of a barrel of sugar. The load was  owned by one man and driven by another, whose consternation at finding he  was a holder of contraband goods was so genuine that the authorities  thought emptying the whisky on the snow was sufficient punishment,  and--possibly dreading a repetition of the last trial--let the man go.    Soon afterwards several kegs of whisky were found on an island in the  Lake of the Woods. The owner gave himself up, and entered the service of  the contractor as especial whisky detective, and such was his vigilance,  that no whisky ever passed him. He was quite impartial, not letting even  our mail bags go unquestioned, and so was not disliked. During his term  the line was quiet and orderly; but, unfortunately, he went into Winnipeg  on leave, shot a youth belonging to one of the river steamers in a  drunken frolic, and was convicted of the murder.    One day, hearing a very peremptory-sounding knock at the door--a knock at  any time being an event--I opened it in haste, to see a short,  jaunty-looking man, red-haired and red-faced, clad in long stockings drawn  well over his trousers and mocassins, a short skin coat tied round his  waist with a red sash, and on his head a long red _toque_.    \"Good mornin', miss,\" said this odd apparition. \"I'm come for Mr. K----'s  legs.\" Seeing that I had not the faintest idea of what he meant, he  touched his forehead again. \"Please, 'm, Mr. K---- sent me for his legs.  He said I'd find them in the office;\" and the little fellow, who seemed  all on springs, craned his neck round to see into the room. Fairly  puzzled, I stood aside to let him pass; so in he went, returning  instantly with a tripod on his shoulder.    \"Here they are, miss,\" he said cheerfully. \"Much obliged. Fine day,  miss;\" and was off to the lake before I had recovered my surprise at his  amazing request and his general absurdity.          CHAPTER XII.    Birds of Passage--An Independent Swede--By Sleigh to Ostersund--A Son of  the Forest--Burnt out--A Brave Canadian Girl--Roughing it in the  Shanty--The Kitchen-tent--Blasting the Rock--The Perils of  Nitro-glycerine--Bitter Jests.      We had plenty of strange visitors; almost every day men passing along  the line came in, either to inquire the distance to the next shanty, or  to ask for a meal or drink of milk. Some showed a friendly disposition,  and would entertain us with their full family history. Others, with many  professions of gratitude for our kindness, would eat enough to last them  a week, one would suppose, and go on their way. Others, more taciturn and  independent, took their refreshment in silence, and offered to pay for  what they received. One in particular, a tall, slight man, rather  advanced in years, came in one morning, and made us understand by signs  that he was hungry. When a meal was put before him, he sat down, took his  hat off--this was something unusual--and upon every offer of more edibles  bowed his thanks with much dignity. He could speak neither English nor  French, and looked like a Swede. When his repast was finished, he offered  by signs to mend shoes as payment. Thinking that he was begging for  shoes, we screamed, as every one so oddly does to foreigners--as if it  made our language any more intelligible to them--that we had none for  him. Seeing we did not understand him, he sat down and went through the  pantomime of mending shoes. Still shaking our heads, as we had no shoes  to be mended, he, after fumbling in his pockets, produced a quarter,  which he pressed us all in turn to take. In vain we tried to make him  understand that his breakfast was a gift; going away a step or two, he  came back again and again, still offering the quarter. At last, out of  all patience, Mr. C---- ordered him off the premises. The stranger went  up the hill, but lingered until the coast was clear, to put the quarter  on the ice at the door. Then, thinking perhaps that it might not be seen  there by the right people, he stuck it into a crevice between two logs in  the shed, and went away whistling merrily, his pride relieved of his  obligation, as well as his pocket of his money.    Towards the end of the winter, the sleighing being a little better on the  portages, we drove to Ostersund, the nearest house east of us. It was  Sunday, the 3rd of March, and a bright, clear, cold day. Our conveyance  was a sort of combination arrangement of a long, low platform, with one  seat, on two bob-sleighs, which platform turned on a pivot independent of  the sleighs. This was supposed to be an invention that lessened the bumps  and swings experienced by the traveller, who was jolted over the hills  and hollows of the rough roads. Rough, indeed, they were--up and down  steep hills, among and over huge boulders thrown out by the blasts in  adjacent cuttings, along the edge of narrow rocks, where Carrière had to  hold on to the sleigh on one side, to keep it from swinging round, and  down the face of the jagged cliff, into such deep gullies, that it was a  wonder we were not tipped over on the horse's back, or left behind, when  he went up the ascent. The problem that chiefly occupied me during this  wild huntsman-like ride was: If the combination sleigh were indeed a  success, what would my sensations have been without it?    On the lakes the road was smooth and delightful, and our old broken-down  steed supplied by the Government, derisively dubbed \"Pegasus\" by Mrs.  C----, achieved something approaching a trot. Poor thing! its hide had  become so hardened by former cruel treatment, that there was no spot on  which the whip had the least effect. We were accompanied by the usual  number of dogs, who ran yelping after the rabbits in all directions. On  one of the portages we passed an old Indian, clad in a long blue blanket  coat, with a red sash round his waist, and beaded leggings, and  mocassins; his long hair was tied back, and a red silk handkerchief was  loosely knotted round his brow. He leant upon his old brown gun, and the  tall trees, through whose leafless branches the sunshine fell in long  streaks on the snow and moss, formed a fitting background for his gaunt  figure. Unheeding the hoarse barking of the dogs, he replied to  Carrière's \"Bon jour\" with a guttural \"Bon jour, nitchee;\" but until we  were out of sight remained in the same attitude.    On the 26th of March, an event happened which startled us all out of the  even tenor of our lives. Between ten and eleven in the morning, the roof  of our house caught fire from the kitchen chimney, and having no engine  or fire-extinguisher about the premises, we were houseless, with scarcely  anything to call our own, in half an hour. The moment we discovered the  fire, we ran to the nearest cutting, where there were twenty men, to ask  their assistance. After vainly attempting to get at the fire by chopping  away the roof, they could do nothing but save as much property as  possible. Mrs. C---- was at Kalmar, and being too excited to remain  inactive, I deposited the children in the contractor's shanty, persuading  them to stay there until I returned, and went back to the house to save  what I could. I had plenty of assistance. Never did men work better. I  have seen many a fire in crowded cities, where engines and hundreds of  people were at hand, without half the proportionate amount of goods being  saved; and what was rescued from the flames was not destroyed by rough  handling.    The house was built of logs, the crevices being stuffed with moss, and  lined with thick brown paper, the seams of the latter covered with a  narrow beading of pine. The roof was lined with tar-paper, which made a  dense and blinding smoke. It had been built a year, and was so dry that  it burnt like a tinder-box.    The cook, a bright, pretty Canadian girl, in her anxiety to save her  kitchen utensils, was caught by the flames, getting her eyebrows and hair  singed while making a final dash for the boiler; and in the long weeks  that followed before it could be replaced she never ceased to lament her  failure. She was worth ten men, and saved many things which we did not  think of at the time, but should have found it difficult to do without  afterwards.    We were a motley group, sitting and standing on the hill above the creek  to watch our house burn to the ground. Navvies of every nation; tall,  brawny Scotchmen; jolly-looking Irishmen, their faces a mixture of pity  for our misfortune and enjoyment of the \"fun;\" stumpy little French  Canadians; solemn, stupid-looking Icelanders and Mennonites. Carrière was  there on his crutches. Poor fellow! standing knee-deep in the lake to cut  ice out had brought on such a severe attack of rheumatism, that it was  with difficulty he moved about at all. We were surrounded by a  heterogeneous mass of household goods: here a pile of bedding, surmounted  by a looking-gla"]]]
