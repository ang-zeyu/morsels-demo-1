I lost no time in getting a connection and I was told to report at the  Wilhelmstrasse at 10.30 that night.  I was to hold myself ready for  instant service.  I must come prepared possibly for a long journey.    I gave orders for my boy to have me dressed by ten o'clock.  I decided  to take a nap, for I knew that midnight interviews with the gentleman  at the Wilhelmstrasse often led to some mighty unexpected and  protracted traveling.  Before going to sleep, however, I went over the  European situation.  What had loomed big?  I hoped it was something  big, for while a Secret Service agent doesn't get blasÃ©, he likes to  work when thrones or the boundaries of empires are involved.    I reflected that June--it was in 1911--had been a decidedly strenuous  month for more than one cabinet in Europe.  Germany and France were  snapping and snarling.  France was going around with its chest stuck  out; its attitude decidedly belligerent.  Of course, this cockiness  was due to the fat fingers of honest John Bull; indeed, England had  more than ten fingers in this pie that was baking.  I knew that the  air was full of Morocco and war talk.  I knew that there was a certain  faction in Germany that was trying to push the Kaiser into a war.  This clique, composed of army and navy men and the junker, the \"Jingo\"  party, the big gun interests, backed by public opinion, were trying  their utmost to urge war with France.  What was the latest at the  Wilhelmstrasse?    On the stroke of 10.30 I was there.  I handed my number to the  commissaire.  This number is important.  All German secret agents are  known by number, all carry little cards and a photograph of mine is  published between these covers.    Presently the commissaire returned and showed me into the chambers of  Graf von Wedel, Privy Councilor to the German Emperor.  With another  man in evening dress, I was told to wait in an antechamber.  We bowed,  and although we took pretty good stock of each other, neither spoke.  It is an unwritten law not to hold unnecessary conversation in the  Imperial Secret Service.  After about half an hour's wait, we were  shown into the Count's private room.  This rather astonished me, for  the usual rule at the Wilhelmstrasse is to interview only one man at a  time.  Clearly something out of the ordinary was in the air.  After  the Count greeted us, he inquired if we were known to each other.  Receiving a negative, he introduced us.  My companion was a Herr von  Senden, ex-officer of the Zweite Gaarde Dragona.    \"You will both be taken at half-past eleven to a certain room,\" said  the Count.  \"You will advance to the middle, wheel to your right, face  the portiÃ¨re and stand at attention.  You will answer all questions,  but make no comments or queries yourself.  I need not enjoin you to  total silence.  You understand?\"    We bowed.  Just then a gong boomed somewhere below us.  A last word  from the Count, \"Be ready!\"  He left us.  Reappearing almost  immediately, he beckoned us to follow him.  We noticed that he seemed  even more grave than usual.  Down a flight of stairs along a great  corridor we made our way, no one speaking a word.  At the end of the  corridor we saw two sentries; then, a big solid oak door, guarded by  an attendant in the livery of the Royal Household.  At a sign from the  Count we halted; he knocked.  The door was opened by an officer of the  Erste Gaarde du Corps and, remembering our instructions, we entered  and came to attention in the middle of a large room, facing an  adjoining chamber, the portiÃ¨res to which were divided.  The room in  which we stood was brilliantly lighted, but the other was dark, save  for a green glow that came from a shaded reading lamp on a big writing  desk.  Senden looked at the desk and gave a sort of gasp.    Then I quite understood his emotion.  For seated behind that heavy,  old-fashioned desk, was Wilhelm II, Emperor of Germany.    We stood at a rigid attention, absolutely silent, for full five  minutes.  The dimly lit, solitary figure at the desk made no sign but  went on writing.  I am not a timid or a nervous man, the sort of work  I was doing seasons one pretty thoroughly.  But this began to get on  my nerves.  Drawn up in front of the Emperor and waiting, waiting.  Contact with the great ones of the earth, especially through Secret  Service, can take some almighty queer turns and a short circuit is  confoundedly unhealthy for the negative wire.  The more I looked at  that silent, lonely figure, War Lord of Europe, the more I began to  feel a great big longing for the African Veldt, a thousand miles north  of Port Natal, preferably.    Suddenly the Emperor made a move, and there came a sharp, rather high  pitched voice, saying, \"Wedel, I will see the doctor.\"    At once Herr Senden was shown from the room; obviously the mission,  whatever it was, was not for him.  I never saw him again.    I was bidden to step to within three paces of the Emperor; the officer  who escorted Herr von Senden from the room attempted to return, but  was waved out.  There were just the three of us: Count Wedel, standing  at the corner of the desk on the right, the Kaiser and myself.  I had  seen the Emperor on many occasions, but never so close before.  He  appeared to be lost in some document.  He looked well but older than  any of his portraits.  Tanned, almost dark, his rather lean face bore  a striking likeness to Frederick the Great; more so than ever, for he  is getting gray.  I realized that none of his portraits do his eyes  justice.  Of a bluish-steel gray, they have an icy, impersonal,  weighing look in them.  It is hard to define.  It struck me in that  moment that Lord Kitchener, Teufick Pasha, Cecil Rhodes, and Li Hung  Chang had exactly those same eyes--the eyes of men who feel it in them  to master the world.    Presently His Majesty looked up, and in that same, rather shrill  voice, asked:    \"How long are you in the Service?\"    \"Three years, sir.\"    \"You know Morocco?\"    Morocco!  So that was it.  France and Germany quarreling over the  bone, at the point of war!  I replied:    \"Yes, sir!\"    \"How long were you in Morocco?\" continued the Emperor.    \"About twelve months, sir.\"    On this he seemed to hesitate.  Frankly, I was nervous, so instead of  thinking about Morocco, I noticed that the Kaiser wore the undress  uniform of a Colonel of the Grenadier Guard with the star of the Order  Pour le Merite, dangling from his coat button.  As if making up his  mind, he turned again on me those gray eyes.    \"You know Kaid MacLean?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"How did you get to know him?\"    \"I happened to be of assistance to Sir Harry Kaid MacLean who was at  that time Commander-in-Chief and Man-of-Affairs to the Sultan of  Morocco.\"    My answer seemed to please the Emperor, for his eyes gleamed.    \"Any likelihood of his remembering your services?\"    I hesitated, then said:    \"I cannot vouch for another man's memory, sire.  Besides, I do not  care to put the Kaid to the test.\"    The Emperor looked at me queerly, but, evidently satisfied with my  answer, he turned to Count Wedel, saying:    \"He will do.  Have the dispatches ready.\"    At once the Count hurried noiselessly into an adjoining room.  The  Kaiser, making one of his characteristic sudden movements, flung  himself back into the chair, looked steadily at me, and added:    \"Besides the official dispatches you will memorize these commands, for  the Captain of the warship _Panther_.\"  He handed me a note, which I  did not immediately look at, for he continued: \"Outside of Count  Wedel, no one is to know anything of your mission.  No one is to know  that you are carrying a verbal message from me to the Captain of the  warship _Panther_.  Understand?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    The Emperor as abruptly drew himself forward, and propping his head  with his hands, fell into a deep study, gazing fixedly at nothing.  He  seemed in that moment to be considerably older.  His face, even for  the tan, had that grayish look of a man who is carrying some  tremendous responsibility.  It came to me swiftly, the popular clamor  for war, _Panther_!--the _Panther_ was lying off Spain ready to steam  across the Mediterranean to Morocco.  And I was to bear secret orders  from the Emperor to the _Panther's_ captain.    Then I opened the note that the Emperor had given me, and began to  memorize its contents.  Amazement must have shown on my face.  A blow  with a feather would have knocked me down.  So wonder Wilhelm II was  staring blankly, no wonder this message had to be delivered verbally.  Hurriedly I began to memorize it.  Presently, I saw Count Wedel come  in and he and the Kaiser began to talk in whispers.  Then Wilhelm  looked up and said:    \"Have you memorized it?\"    \"Yes, sir!\"  Taking the note from me, he at once struck a match and  held it under the paper until it was reduced to ashes.  Then making a  curt gesture of dismissal, Wedel gave me a signal to retire and we  backed toward the door.  I was in possession of a secret known only to  the Emperor himself and which at that moment the cabinets of France  and England and the financiers of the world would have given hundreds  of thousands of dollars to possess.  Out into the hall we backed,  always being careful never to commit the discourtesy of turning our  faces away from the Emperor, and the last I saw of him, was that  lonely figure seated at his desk, the greenish light playing over him,  around and beyond him darkness and his face illuminated against that  background, grayish, old.  There he was, at his desk at midnight, in  an underground chamber of the Foreign Office, the Emperor of Germany,  working in solitude, while most of his subjects slept, tirelessly  mapping out a policy the trend of which he dared discuss with no man  save Wedel and possibly his oldest son.    Bowing, we were out in the hall; the big oaken door closed.  Wedel led  the way to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6952"],[0,"By Pike and Dyke: a Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic (#17)"],[1,"whether  they had or not--seeing that Captain Martin was looking for his  wife, and that the mistress was anxious to be off--it might have  led to trouble when I got back again.    \"By the afternoon we had got some thirty tons of goods on board,  and although that is but a third of what she would carry, I was well  content that we had done so much. After the new sails had come on  board I had put a gang to work to bend them, and had all ready and  the anchor up just as the tide turned. We had not dropped down many  hundred yards when the boat with Mistress Martin and your sisters  came alongside; and thankful I was when it came on dark and we  were slipping down the river with a light southwesterly wind, for  I had been on thorns all the afternoon lest some messenger might  arrive from the council with orders for me to attend there. I did  not speak much to your mother that evening, for it needs all a  man's attention to work down the river at night.    \"The next morning I had my breakfast brought up on deck instead  of going down, for, as you may guess, I did not want to have your  mother questioning me; but presently your sister came up with a  message to me that Mistress Martin would be glad to have a quarter  of an hour's conversation with me as soon as duty would permit me  to leave deck. So after awhile I braced myself up and went below,  but I tell you that I would rather have gone into action again with  the Don Pedro. She began at once, without parley or courtesies, by  firing a broadside right into me.    \"'I don't think, Master Peters, that you have told me yet all there  is to be told.'    \"That took me between wind and water, you see. However, I made a  shift to bear up.    \"'Well, Mistress Martin,' says I, 'I don't say as I have given you  all particulars. I don't know as I mentioned to you as Joe Wiggins  was struck down by a splinter from the longboat and was dazed for  full two hours, but he came round again all right, and was fit for  duty next day.'    \"Mrs. Martin heard me quietly, and then she said:    \"'That will not do, John Peters; you know well what I mean. You  need not fear to tell me the news; I have long been fearing it.  My husband is not one to talk loosely in the streets and to bring  upon himself the anger of the Spaniards. He must have had good  cause before he said words that spoken there would place his life  in peril. What has happened at Vordwyk?\"    \"Well, Master Ned, I stood there as one struck stupid. What was there  to say? I am a truthful man, but I would have told a lie if I had  thought it would have been any good. But there she was, looking  quietly at me, and I knew as she would see in a moment whether  I was speaking truth or not. She waited quiet ever so long and at  last I said:    \"'The matter is in this wise, Mistress Martin. My orders was I was  to hold my tongue about all business not touching the captain or  the affairs of this ship. When you sees the captain it's for you  to ask him questions, and for him to answer if he sees right and  good to do so.'    \"She put her hand over her face and sat quiet for some time, and  when she looked up again her eyes were full of tears and her cheeks  wet; then she said in a low tone:    \"'All, Peters,--are they all gone?'    \"Well, Master Ned, I was swabbing my own eyes; for it ain't in a  man's nature to see a woman suffering like that, and so quiet and  brave, without feeling somehow as if all the manliness had gone out  of him. I could not say nothing. What could I say, knowing what the  truth was? Then she burst out a-crying and a-sobbing, and I steals  off without a word, and goes on deck and sets the men a-hauling at  the sheets and trimming the sails, till I know there was not one  of them but cussed me in his heart and wished that the captain was  back again.    \"Mistress Martin did not say no word about it afterwards. She came  up on deck a few times, and asked me more about the captain, and  how he looked, and what he was doing when he got his wound. And  of course I told her all about it, full and particular, and how he  had made every one else lie down, and stood there at the tiller as  we went under the stern of the Spaniard, and that none of us knew  he was hit until it was all over; and how we had peppered them with  our four carronades, and all about it. But mostly she stopped down  below till we hauled our wind and headed up the Zuider Zee towards  Enkhuizen.\"    \"Well, now it is all over, Peters,\" Ned said, \"there is no doubt  that it is better she should have heard the news from you instead  of my father having to tell her.\"    \"I don't deny that that may be so, Master Ned, now that it is all  over and done; but never again will John Peters undertake a job  where he is got to keep his mouth shut when a woman wants to get  something out of him. Lor' bless you, lad, they just see right  through you; and you feel that, twist and turn as you will, they  will get it out of you sooner or later. There, I started with  my mind quite made up that orders was to be obeyed, and that your  mother was to be kept in the dark about it till she got here; and  I had considered with myself that in such a case as this it would  be no great weight upon my conscience if I had to make up some kind  of a yarn that would satisfy her; and yet in three minutes after  she got me into that cabin she was at the bottom of it all.\"    \"You see, she has been already very uneasy at not hearing for so  long from her father and brothers, Peters; and that and the fact  that my father had spoken openly against the Spanish authorities  set her upon the track, and enabled her to put the questions  straightforwardly to you.\"    \"I suppose that was it, sir. And now, has the captain said anything  about what is going to be done with the ship till he gets well?\"    \"Nothing whatever, Peters. He has spoken very little upon any  subject. I know he has been extremely anxious for my mother to  arrive, though he has said but little about it. I fancy that for  the last few days he has not thought that he should recover. But the  doctor told me I must not be uneasy upon that ground, for that he  was now extremely weak, and men, even the bravest and most resolute  when in health, are apt to take a gloomy view when utterly weak and  prostrate. His opinion was that my mother's coming would probably  cheer him up and enable him to rally.    \"I think, too, that he has been dreading having to tell her the  terrible news about her father and brothers; and now he knows that  she is aware of that it will be a load off his mind. Besides, I  know that for his sake she will be cheerful and bright, and with  her and the girls with him, he will feel as if at home. The doctor  told me that the mind has a great influence over the body, and  that a man with cheerful surroundings had five chances to one as  against one amongst strangers, and with no one to brighten him up.  I have no doubt that as soon as he gets a little stronger he will  arrange what is to be done with the brig, but I am sure it will be  a long time before he can take the command again himself.\"    \"Ay, I fear it will be,\" Peters agreed. \"It is a pity you are not  four or five years older, Master Ned. I do not say that I couldn't  bring the ship into any port in Holland; for, having been sailing  backwards and forwards here, man and boy, for over thirty years, I  could do so pretty nigh blindfold. But what is the good of bringing  a ship to a port if you have not got the head to see about getting  a cargo for her, and cannot read the bills of lading, or as much  as sign your name to a customs list.    \"No, Master Ned, I am not fit for a captain, that is quite certain.  But though I would not mind serving under another till your father  is fit to take charge again, I could not work on board the Venture  under another for good. I have got a little money saved up, and  would rather buy a share in a small coaster and be my own master  there. After serving under your father for nigh twenty years, I  know I should not get on with another skipper nohow.\"    \"Well, Peters, it is no use talking it over now, because I have  no idea what my father's decision will be. I hope above all things  that he will be able to take command again, but I have great doubts  in my own mind whether he will ever do so. If he had lost the leg  below the knee it would not so much have mattered; but as it is,  with the whole leg stiff, he would have great difficulty in getting  about, especially if the ship was rolling in a heavy sea.\"    John Peters shook his head gravely, for this was the very thing  he had turned in his mind over and over again during the voyage to  and from England.    \"Your cargo is not all for this place, I suppose, Peters?\"    \"No, sir. Only two or three tons which are down in the forehold  together are for Enkhuizen, the rest are for Leyden and the Hague.  I told the merchants that if they put their goods on board I must  sail past the ports and make straight on to Enkhuizen; for that  first of all I must bring Mistress Martin to the captain, but that  I would go round and discharge their goods as soon as I had brought  her here. It was only on these terms I agreed to take the cargo.\"    \"That will do very well, Peters. I will go on board with you at  once, and see to whom your goods are consigned here, and warn them  to receive them at once. You will get them on shore by tonight,  and then tomorrow I will sail with you to Leyden and the Hague,  and aid you in getting your cargo into the right hands there. Now  that my mother and the girls are here my father will be able to  spare me. We can be back here again in four or five days, and by  that time I hope he will be so far recovered as to be able to think  matters over, and come to some decision as to the future management  of the brig. Of course if he wishes me to stay on board her I shall  obey his orders, whether you or another are the captain.\" "]]]
