Procopius mentions a Phoenecian inscription near the city of Tingis in  Mauritania, the sense of which in Greek was: \"We are those who fled  before the face of Joshua the robber, the son of Nun.\" Again Suidas  says: \"We are the Canaanites whom Joshua the robber persecuted.\" In a  letter of Shaubech, king of Armenia Minor, in the Samaritan book of  Joshua (chapter 26), styles Joshua \"the murderous wolf; or, according  to another reading, \"the evening wolf.\" (Condensed from Kitto's  Biblical Literature, Vol. II, p. 154.)    4. _Authorship of the Book of Joshua:_ \"Viewing all the circumstances  together, we consider it highly probable that the whole book of  Joshua was composed by himself up to the twenty-eighth verse of the  last chapter; to which a friendly hand subjoined some brief notices,  contained in verses 29-33, concerning the death, age, and burial  of Joshua; the continuance of his influence upon the people; the  interment, in Shechem, of the bones of Joseph, which the children of  Israel had brought from Egypt; and the death and burial of Eleazar, the  son of Aaron, whom his son Phinehas interred in his allotment on Mount  Ephraim.\" (Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature, Kitto, Vol. II, p. 156.)    5. _Roman Catholic View of Authorship:_ \"This book is called Josue,  because it contains the history of what passed under him, and according  to the common opinion was written by him. The Greeks call him Jesus;  for Josue and Jesus in the Hebrew are the same name, and have the same  signification, viz., a savior.\" (Introduction to the Book of Josue.)    6. _Character of Joshua:_ \"So Joshua, when he had thus discoursed to  them [upon their obligations and duty to God], died, having lived a  hundred and ten years; forty of which he lived with Moses, in order  to learn what might be for his advantage afterward. He also became  their commander after his death for twenty-five years. He was a man  that wanted not wisdom nor eloquence to declare his intentions to the  people, but very eminent on both accounts. He was of great courage and  magnanimity, in action and in dangers; and very sagacious in procuring  the peace of the people, and of great virtue at all proper seasons. He  was buried in the city of Timnah, of the tribe of Ephraim. About the  same time died Eleazar, the high priest, leaving the high priesthood  to his son Phineas. His monument also and sepulchre are in the city of  Gabbatha.\" (Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, p. 104.)    7. _Literature of Power:_ By \"literature of power\" is here meant that  class of utterance that rests upon its own inherent strength for its  influence or acceptance as truth. An American popular writer (Hubbard)  in giving an illustration of this class of literature quoted this  passage from the Bible:    \"The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before  him.\"    Explanation, comment upon such a passage, he argues, would but mar it.  One feels a force, a strength in it that admits of no doubt about its  power, or truth. A still better example of the literature of power is  Psalms xix, also Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. lxxxiv: 99-102. It is  such a passage in Joshua that the student is directed to find.    7. _Book of Ruth:_ \"The Book is called Ruth, from the name of the  person, whose history is here recorded: who being a Gentile, became a  convert to the true faith, and marrying Boaz, the great-grandfather  of David, was one of those from whom Christ sprung, according to  the flesh, and an illustrious figure of the Gentile church. It is  thought this book was written by the prophet Samuel.\" (Douay Bible,  Introduction to the Book of Ruth, p. 303.)    Footnotes    1. The Pentateuch Historically has already been considered in Lesson  III of Part II; and its historical character considered under  subdivision II. (a) Anti-diluvian History. (b) Postdiluvian History,  bringing its historical events down to the death of Moses. It is here  written into the analysis only that the student may be reminded that  the Pentateuch is recognized as being classed with the historical books  of the Bible.

Authorship and Literary Character.    _SPECIAL TEXT: \"And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in  burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord?  Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat  of rams.\"--I. Samuel xv: 22._    _NOTES._    1. _The Historic Period Covered by the Books of Samuel:_ \"The story  embraces a period of over one hundred years, and extends from the end  of the time of the Judges to the close of the reign of David, 1015 B.  C., the connecting link being found in the civil judgeship of Eli and  Samuel. The object of the narrative is to exhibit the kingdom as it  realized itself in view of a divine ideal; and the prominence given  to the lives of Samuel and David would seem to be due to a design to  portray the one as the type of the prophetic, and the other as the type  of the kingly character--the king's counselor, in this case, selecting  the king, and not, as was the rule afterwards, the king his counselor.\"  (Cambridge Teacher's Bible Helps, p. 19.)    2. _Books of Samuel, I and II. Protestant View:_ \"The two were, by the  ancient Jews, conjoined, so as to make one book, and in that form could  be called the Book of Samuel with more propriety than now, the second  being wholly occupied with the relation of transactions that did not  take place till after the death of that eminent judge. Accordingly,  in the Septuagint and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6052"],[0,"The Minds and Manners of Wild Animals: A Book of Personal Observations (#17)"],[1,"the latter, the  offending party must look out for himself, or he may be roughly  handled.    The voice of the chimpanzee is strong, clear, and in captivity it  is very much in evidence. Two of its moderate tones are almost  musical. It is heard when the animal says, coaxingly, \"Who'-oe!  Who'-oe!\" A dozen times a day, our large specimens indulge in  spells of loud yelling, purely for their own amusement. Their  strident cry sounds like \"Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! _Wah'_-hoo!  _Wah'_-hoo! Hoo'-hoo! _Wah_-h-h-h! _Wah_-h-h!\" The  second combination, \"Wah-hoo,\" consists of two sounds, four notes  apart.    It is with their voices that chimpanzees first manifest their  pleasure at seeing cherished friends of the human species, or  their anger. Their recognition, and their exuberant joy on such  occasions, is quite as apparent to every observer as are the  manifestations of welcome of demonstrative human beings.    Like all other groups of species, the apes of various genera now  living vary widely in their mentalities. The chimpanzee has the  most alert and human-like mind but with less speed the orang-utan  is a good second. The average captive gorilla, if judged by  existing standards for ape mentality, is a poor third in the  anthropoid scale, below the chimp and orang; but since the rise of  Major Penny's family-pet gorilla, named John, we must revise all  our former views of that species, and concede exceptions.    In studying the mental status of the primates I attach great  importance to the work and results of the professional trainers  who educate animals for stage performances. If the trainer does  not know which are the brightest species of apes, baboons and  monkeys, then who does? Their own fortunes depend upon their  estimate of comparative mentality in the primates.  Fortunately for  our purposes, the minds of the most intelligent and capable apes,  baboons, and monkeys have been partially developed and exploited  by stage trainers, and to a far less extent by keepers in zoological  parks. Some wonderful results have been achieved, and the best of  these have been seen by the public in theatres, in traveling shows  and in zoological parks. All these performances have greatly  interested me, because they go so far as measures of mental  capacity. I wish to make it clear that I take them very seriously.    [Illustration  with caption: PORTRAIT OF A HIGH-CASTE CHIMPANZEE \"Baldy\" was an  animal of fine intelligence and originality in thought. He was a  natural comedian]    While many of the acts of trained animals are due to their power  of mimicry and are produced by imitation rather than by original  thought, even their imitative work reveals a breadth of  intelligence, a range of memory and of activity and precision in  thought and in energy which no logical mind can ignore. To say  that a chimpanzee who can swing through thirty or forty different  acts \"does not think\" and \"does not reason,\" is to deny the  evidence of the human senses, and fall outside the bounds of human  reason.    Training Apes for Performances. As will appear in its own chapter,  there is nothing at all mysterious in the training of apes. The  subject must be young, and pliant in mind, and of cheerful and  kind disposition. The poor subjects are left for cage life. The  trainer must possess intelligence of good quality, infinite  patience and tireless industry. Furthermore, the stage properties  must be ample. An outfit of this kind can train any ape that is  mentally and physically a good subject. Of course in every animal  species, wild or domestic, there are individuals so dull and  stupid that it is inexpedient to try to educate them.    The chimpanzee Suzette who came to us direct from the vaudeville  stage performed every summer in her open-air \"arena cage,\" until  she entered motherhood, which put an end to her stage work. She  was a brilliant \"trick\" bicycle rider. She could stand upright on  a huge wooden ball, and by expert balancing and foot-work roll it  up a steep incline, down a flight of stairs, and land it safely  upon the stage, without once losing her balance or her control.  She was entirely at home on roller skates, and when taken out upon  the pavement of Baird Court she would go wildly careering around  the large grass plat at high speed.    All the above acts were acrobatic feats that called for original  thought and action, and were such as no dull mind and body could  exert. All the training skill in the world could not take a  machine and teach it to ride a bicycle through a collection of  bottles, and an intelligent ape is a million years from being a  \"machine in fur and feathers.\"    More than once I have been astounded by the performances of apes  on the stage. Mr. J. S. Edwards' orang-utan Joe was a very capable  animal, and his performances were wonderful. He could use a  hammer in driving nails, and a screwdriver in inserting and  extracting screws, with wonderful dexterity.    The most remarkable chimpanzee performance that I ever saw was  given in a New York theatre in 1909. The star actor was a fine  male animal about six years old, called Peter. I made a complete  record of his various acts, and the program was as follows    PERFORMANCE OF PETER, A CHIMPANZEE    Stage properties: a suit of clothes, shoes, chair, table, bed,  bureau, hatrack, candle, cigarette, match, cuspidor, roller  skates, bottles, flag, inclined plane and steps; plate, napkin,  cup, spoon, teapot.    As Peter entered, he bowed to the audience, took off his cap and  hung it upon a hatrack. He went to the table, seated himself in  the chair, unfolded and put on a napkin, and with a string  fastened it in place under his chin. With a fork he speared some  slices of banana and ate them. Into his tumbler he poured liquid  from a bottle, drank, then corked the bottle. Next, he poured  tea into a cup, put in sugar and cream, took tea from the spoon,  then drank from the cup. After that he took a toothpick and used  it elaborately.    Striking a match he lit a cigarette, and smoked. In perfect man-  fashion he took the cigarette between his fingers, gave his keeper  a light, smoked again, and blew puffs of smoke first from one  corner of his mouth and then the other. Then he elaborately spat  into the cuspidor.    Next in order he went to the bureau, cleaned his teeth with a  tooth-brush, brushed his hair on both sides, looked into the  mirror and powdered his face.    Finally he bit a coin and put it on the keeper's plate as a tip.    He pulled off his coat, took off his cuffs and vest, and thus half  undressed he joyously danced about, beating a tambourine. Then he  removed his shirt, trousers, shoes, garters and socks. Lighting  his candle he walked to his bed, blew out the candle and went to  bed.    Very soon he rose, put on his trousers and a pair of roller skates  and playfully pursued a young woman who ran before him. His use of  the roller skates was excellent.    The stage was cleared of furniture, and a bicycle was brought out.  He mounted it and started off, at the first trial, and swiftly  rode around the stage about fifteen times. While riding he took  off his cap and waved it. He rode up an inclined plane and down  four steps without falling off, repeating for an encore,--but  here he became peeved about something.    Five bottles were set in a figure 8, and he rode between them  several times. At last he took up a bottle and drank out of it.  Then he drank out of a tumbler, all while riding. After much flag-  waving and swift riding, Peter stopped at the center of the stage,  dismounted, bowed, clapped his hands vigorously and retired.    Peter's performance was remarkable because of the great length of  it, the absolute skill and precision of it, and the animal's easy  mastery of every situation. There was a notable absence of  hesitations and mistakes, and of visible direction. The trainer  seemed to do nothing save to assist with the stage properties,  just as an assistant helps any acrobat through the property  business of his act. If any commands or signs were given, the  audience was not aware of it. Later on I learned that sometimes  Peter did not perform with such spirit, and required some urging  to be prompt. The trainer was kept hustling to keep up with his  own duties. The animal seemed to remember, and I believe he did  remember, the sequence of a performance of _fifty-six separate  acts!_    When I witnessed Peter's performance in New York, saw the length  of it and noted the immense amount of nervous energy that each  performance used up, I made the prediction that he could not for  one year endure such a strain. It was reported to me that he died  nine months from that time.    In October, 1909, when Peter went to Philadelphia, he was  frequently and closely studied and observed by Dr. Lightner  Witmer, professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania,  and his mentality was tested at the laboratory of the University.  Dr. Witmer's conclusions, as set forth in a paper in the December  (1909) issue of the _Psychological Clinic,_ are of very great  interest. He approached Peter's first performance in a skeptical  frame of mind. I gladly waive the opportunity to express my own  views regarding Peter in order to put upon the stand a more  competent witness. Hear Dr. Witmer:    \"As I entered the theatre,\" he says, \"my feelings were commingled  interest and doubt. My doubts were bred from knowledge of the  difficulty of judging the intelligence of an animal from a stage  performance. So-called educated horses and even educated seals and  fleas have made their appeal in large number to the credulity of  the public. Can any animal below man be educated in the proper  sense of the word? Or is the animal mind susceptible of nothing  more than a mechanical training, and only given the specious  counterfeit of an educated intelligence when under the direct  control of the trainer?    \"Since that day I"]]]
