Who have you there wife?\" \"Eh,\" said the wife, \"it's three poor lassies  cold and hungry, and they will go away. Ye won't touch 'em, man.\" He  said nothing, but ate up a big supper, and ordered them to stay all  night. Now he had three lassies of his own, and they were to sleep in  the same bed with the three strangers.    The youngest of the three strange lassies was called Molly Whuppie, and  she was very clever. She noticed that before they went to bed the giant  put straw ropes round her neck and her sisters', and round his own  lassies' necks he put gold chains. So Molly took care and did not fall  asleep, but waited till she was sure every one was sleeping sound. Then  she slipped out of the bed, and took the straw ropes off her own and her  sisters' necks, and took the gold chains off the giant's lassies. She  then put the straw ropes on the giant's lassies and the gold on herself  and her sisters, and lay down.    And in the middle of the night up rose the giant, armed with a great  club, and felt for the necks with the straw. It was dark. He took his  own lassies out of bed on to the floor, and battered them until they  were dead, and then lay down again, thinking he had managed fine. Molly  thought it time she and her sisters were out of that, so she wakened  them and told them to be quiet, and they slipped out of the house. They  all got out safe, and they ran and ran, and never stopped until morning,  when they saw a grand house before them. It turned out to be a king's  house: so Molly went in, and told her story to the king. He said: \"Well,  Molly, you are a clever girl, and you have managed well; but, if you  would manage better, and go back, and steal the giant's sword that hangs  on the back of his bed, I would give your eldest sister my eldest son to  marry.\" Molly said she would try.    So she went back, and managed to slip into the giant's house, and crept  in below the bed. The giant came home, and ate up a great supper, and  went to bed. Molly waited until he was snoring, and she crept out, and  reached over the giant and got down the sword; but just as she got it  out over the bed it gave a rattle, and up jumped the giant, and Molly  ran out at the door and the sword with her; and she ran, and he ran,  till they came to the \"Bridge of one hair\"; and she got over, but he  couldn't, and he says, \"Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie! never ye come  again.\" And she says \"Twice yet, carle,\" quoth she, \"I'll come to  Spain.\" So Molly took the sword to the king, and her sister was married  to his son.    Well, the king he says: \"Ye've managed well, Molly; but if ye would  manage better, and steal the purse that lies below the giant's pillow,  I would marry your second sister to my second son.\" And Molly said she  would try. So she set out for the giant's house, and slipped in, and hid  again below the bed, and waited till the giant had eaten his supper, and  was snoring sound asleep. She slipped out, and slipped her hand below  the pillow, and got out the purse; but just as she was going out the  giant wakened, and ran after her; and she ran, and he ran, till they  came to the \"Bridge of one hair,\" and she got over, but he couldn't, and  he said, \"Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie! never you come again.\" \"Once yet,  carle,\" quoth she, \"I'll come to Spain.\" So Molly took the purse to the  king, and her second sister was married to the king's second son.    After that the king says to Molly: \"Molly, you are a clever girl, but if  you would do better yet, and steal the giant's ring that he wears on his  finger, I will give you my youngest son for yourself.\" Molly said she  would try. So back she goes to the giant's house, and hides herself  below the bed. The giant wasn't long ere he came home, and, after he had  eaten a great big supper, he went to his bed, and shortly was snoring  loud. Molly crept out and reached over the bed, and got hold of the  giant's hand, and she pulled and she pulled until she got off the ring;  but just as she got it off the giant got up, and gripped her by the  hand, and he says: \"Now I have catcht you, Molly Whuppie, and, if I had  done as much ill to you as ye have done to me, what would ye do to me?\"    Molly says: \"I would put you into a sack, and I'd put the cat inside  with you, and the dog aside you, and a needle and thread and a shears,  and I'd hang you up upon the wall, and I'd go to the wood, and choose  the thickest stick I could get, and I would come home, and take you  down, and bang you till you were dead.\"    \"Well, Molly,\" says the giant, \"I'll just do that to you.\"    So he gets a sack, and puts Molly into it, and the cat and the dog  beside her, and a needle and thread and shears, and hangs her up upon  the wall, and goes to the wood to choose a stick.    Molly she sings out: \"Oh, if ye saw what I see.\"    \"Oh,\" says the giant's wife, \"what do ye see, Molly?\"    But Molly never said a word but, \"Oh, if ye saw what I see!\"    The giant's wife begged that Molly would take her up into the sack till  she would see what Molly saw. So Molly took the shears and cut a hole in  the sack, and took out the needle and thread with her, and jumped down  and helped, the giant's wife up into the sack, and sewed up the hole.    The giant's wife saw nothing, and began to ask to get down again; but  Molly never minded, but hid herself at the back of the door. Home came  the giant, and a great big tree in his hand, and he took down the sack,  and began to batter it. His wife cried, \"It's me, man;\" but the dog  barked and the cat mewed, and he did not know his wife's voice. But  Molly came out from the back of the door, and the giant saw her, and he  after her; and he ran and she ran, till they came to the \"Bridge of one  hair,\" and she got over but he couldn't; and he said, \"Woe worth you,  Molly Whuppie! never you come again.\" \"Never more, carle,\" quoth she,  \"will I come again to Spain.\"    So Molly took the ring to the king, and she was married to his youngest  son, and she never saw the giant again.          THE RED ETTIN    There was once a widow that lived on a small bit of ground, which she  rented from a farmer. And she had two sons; and by-and-by it was time  for the wife to send them away to seek their fortune. So she told her  eldest son one day to take a can and bring her water from the well, that  she might bake a cake for him; and however much or however little water  he might bring, the cake would be great or small accordingly, and that  cake was to be all that she could give him when he went on his travels.    The lad went away with the can to the well, and filled it with water,  and then came away home again; but the can being broken, the most part  of the water had run out before he got back. So his cake was very small;  yet small as it was, his mother asked him if he was willing to take the  half of it with her blessing, telling him that, if he chose rather to  take the whole, he would only get it with her curse. The young man,  thinking he might have to travel a far way, and not knowing when or  how he might get other provisions, said he would like to have the whole  cake, come of his mother's malison what like; so she gave him the whole  cake, and her malison along with it. Then he took his brother aside, and  gave him a knife to keep till he should come back, desiring him to look  at it every morning, and as long as it continued to be clear, then he  might be sure that the owner of it was well; but if it grew dim and  rusty, then for certain some ill had befallen him.    So the young man went to seek his fortune. And he went all that day, and  all the next day; and on the third day, in the afternoon, he came up to  where a shepherd was sitting with a flock of sheep. And he went up to  the shepherd and asked him who the sheep belonged to; and he answered:      \"The Red Ettin of Ireland      Once lived in Ballygan,    And stole King Malcolm's daughter      The king of fair Scotland.      He beats her, he binds her,      He lays her on a band;    And every day he strikes her      With a bright silver wand.    Like Julian the Roman,    He's one that fears no man.      It's said there's one predestinate      To be his mortal foe;    But that man is yet unborn,      And long may it be so.\"    This shepherd also told him to beware of the beasts he should next meet,  for they were of a very different kind from any he had yet seen.    So the young man went on, and by-and-by he saw a multitude of very  dreadful beasts, with two heads, and on every head four horns. And he  was sore frightened, and ran away from them as fast as he could; and  glad was he when he came to a castle that stood on a hillock, with the  door standing wide open to the wall. And he went into the castle for  shelter, and there he saw an old wife sitting beside the kitchen fire.  He asked the wife if he might stay for the night, as he was tired with  a long journey; and the wife said he might, but it was not a good  place for him to be in, as it belonged to the Red Ettin, who was a very  terrible beast, with three heads, that spared no living man it could get  hold of. The young man would have gone away, but he was afraid of the  beasts on the outside of the castle; so he beseeched the old woman to  hide him as best she could, and not tell the Ettin he was there. He  thought, if he could put over the night, he might get away in the  morning, without meeting with the beasts, and so escape. But he had not  been long in his hiding-hole, before the awful Ettin came in; and no  sooner was he in, than he was heard crying:      \"Snouk but and snouk ben,    I find the smell of an earthly man,    Be he living, or be he dead,    His heart this night shall kitchen my bread."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7440"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#17)"],[1,"him by their  persecutions to seek refuge elsewhere, and to take up arms against them in his  own defence, he had perhaps continued a private person, and contented himself  with the veneration and respect due to his prophetical office; but being once  got at the head of a little army, and encouraged by success, it is no wonder  if he raised his thoughts to attempt what had never before entered his  imagination.     That Mohammed was, as the Arabs are by complexion,1 a great lover of women,  we are assured by his own confession; and he is constantly upbraided with it  by the controversial writers, who fail not to urge the number of women with  whom he had to do, as a demonstrative argument of his sensuality, which they  think sufficiently proves him to have been a wicked man, and consequently an  impostor.  But it must be considered that polygamy, though it be forbidden by  the Christian religion, was in Mohammed's time frequently practised in Arabia  and other parts of the east, and was not counted an immorality, nor was a man  worse esteemed on that account; for which reason Mohammed permitted the  plurality of wives, with certain limitations, among his own followers, who  argue for the lawfulness of it from several reasons, and particularly from the  examples of persons allowed on all hands to have been good men; some of  whom  have been honoured with the divine correspondence.  The several laws relating  to marriages and divorces, and the peculiar privileges granted to Mohammed in  his Korân, were almost all taken by him from the Jewish decisions, as will  appear hereafter; and therefore he might think those    1  Ammian.  Marcell. l. 14, c. 4.          institutions the more just and reasonable, as he found them practised or  approved by the professors of a religion which was confessedly of divine  original.     But whatever were his motives, Mohammed had certainly the personal  qualifications which were necessary to accomplish his undertaking.  The  Mohammedan authors are excessive in their commendations of him, and speak much  of his religious and moral virtues; as his piety, veracity, justice,  liberality, clemency, humility, and abstinence.  His charity, in particular,  they say, was so conspicuous, that he had seldom any money in his house,  keeping no more for his own use than was just sufficient to maintain his  family; and he frequently spared even some part of his own provisions to  supply the necessities of the poor; so that before the year's end he had  generally little or nothing left:1 \"GOD,\" says al Bokhâri, \"offered him the  keys of the treasures of the earth, but he would not accept them.\"  Though the  eulogies of these writers are justly to be suspected of partiality, yet thus  much, I think, may be inferred from thence, that for an Arab who had been  educated in Paganism, and had but a very imperfect knowledge of his duty, he  was a man of at least tolerable morals, and not such a monster of wickedness  as he is usually represented.  And indeed it is scarce possible to conceive,  that a wretch of so profligate a character should ever have succeeded in an  enterprise of this nature; a little hypocrisy and saving of appearances, at  least, must have been absolutely necessary; and the sincerity of his  intentions is what I pretend not to inquire into.     He had indisputably a very piercing and sagacious wit, and was thoroughly  versed in all the arts of insinuation.2  The eastern historians describe him  to have been a man of an excellent judgment, and a happy memory; and these  natural parts were improved by a great experience and knowledge of men, and  the observations he had made in his travels.  They say he was a person of few  words, of an equal cheerful temper, pleasant and familiar in conversation, of  inoffensive behaviour towards his friends, and of great condescension towards  his inferiors.3  To all which were joined a comely agreeable person, and a  polite address; accomplishments of no small service in preventing those in his  favour whom he attempted to persuade.     As to acquired learning, it is confessed he had none at all; having had no  other education than what was customary in his tribe, who neglected, and  perhaps despised, what we call literature; esteeming no language in comparison  with their own, their skill in which they gained by use and not by books, and  contenting themselves with improving their private experience by committing to  memory such passages of their poets as they judged might be of use to them in  life.  This defect was so far from being prejudicial or putting a stop to his  design, that he made the greatest use of it; insisting that the writings which  he produced as revelations from GOD, could not possibly be a forgery of his  own; because it was not conceivable that a person who could neither write nor  read should be able to compose a book of such excellent doctrine, and in so  elegant a style; and thereby obviating       1  Vide Abulfeda Vit. Moham. p. 144, &c.  2  Vide Prid. Life of  Mahomet, p. 105.   3  Vide Abulfed. ubi sup.        an objection that might have carried a great deal of weight.1  And for this  reason his followers, instead of being ashamed of their master's ignorance,  glory in it, as an evident proof of his divine mission, and scruple not to  call him (as he is indeed called in the Korân itself2) the \"illiterate  prophet.\"     The scheme of religion which Mohammed framed, and the design and artful  contrivance of those written revelations (as he pretended them to be) which  compose his Korân, shall be the subject of the following sections: I shall  therefore in the remainder of this relate, as briefly as possible, the steps  he took towards the effecting of his enterprise, and the accidents which  concurred to his success therein.     Before he made any attempt abroad, he rightly judged that it was necessary  for him to begin by the conversion of his own household.  Having therefore  retired with his family, as he had done several times before, to the above-  mentioned cave in Mount Hara, he there opened the secret of his mission to his  wife Khadîjah; and acquainted her that the angel Gabriel had just before  appeared to him, and told him that he was appointed the apostle of GOD: he  also repeated to her a passage3 which he pretended had been revealed to him by  the ministry of the angel, with those other circumstances of his first  appearance, which are related by the Mohammedan writers.  Khadîjah received  the news with great joy,1 swearing by him in whose hands her soul was, that  she trusted he would be the prophet of his nation, and immediately  communicated what she had heard to her cousin, Warakah Ebn Nawfal, who, being  a Christian, could write in the Hebrew character, and was tolerably well  versed in the scriptures;2 and he as readily came into her opinion, assuring  her that the same angel who had formerly appeared unto Moses was now sent to  Mohammed.3  This first overture the prophet made in the month of Ramadân, in  the fortieth year of his age, which is therefore usually called the year of  his mission.     Encouraged by so good a beginning, he resolved to proceed, and try for some  time what he could do by private persuasion, not daring to hazard the whole  affair by exposing it too suddenly to the public.  He soon made proselytes of  those under his own roof, viz., his wife Khadîjah, his servant Zeid Ebn  Hâretha (to whom he gave his freedom4 on that occasion, which afterwards  became a rule to his followers), and his cousin and pupil Ali, the son of Abu  Tâleb, though then very young: but this last, making no account of the other  two, used to style himself the \"first of believers.\"  The next person Mohammed  applied to was Abdallah Ebn Abi Kohâfa, surnamed Abu Becr, a man of great  authority among the Koreish, and one whose interest he well knew would be of  great service to him, as it soon appeared, for Abu Becr being gained over,  prevailed also on Othmân Ebn Affân, Abd'alrahmân Ebn Awf, Saad Ebn Abi Wakkâs,  al Zobeir Ebn al Awâm, and Telha Ebn Obeid'allah, all principal men in Mecca,  to follow his example.       1  See Kor. c. 29.  Prid. Life of Mahomet, p. 28, &c.  2  Chap. 7.   3  This passage is generally agreed to be the first five verses of the  96th chapter.   1  I do not remember to have read in any eastern  author, that Khadîjah ever rejected her husband's pretences as delusions, or  suspected him of any imposture.  Yet see Prideaux's Life of Mahomet, p. 11,  &c.  2  Vide Poc. Spec. p. 157.   3  Vide Abulfed.  Vit.  Moham. p. 16, where the learned translator has mistaken the meaning of this  passage.  4  For he was his purchased slave, as Abulfeda expressly  tells us, and not his cousin-german, as M. de Boulainvill. asserts (Vie de  Mah. p. 273).            These men were the six chief companions, who, with a few more, were converted  in the space of three years, at the end of which, Mohammed having, as he  hoped, a sufficient interest to support him, made his mission no longer a  secret, but gave out that GOD had commanded him to admonish his near  relations;5 and in order to do it with more convenience and prospect of  success, he directed Ali to prepare an entertainment, and invite the sons and  descendants of Abd'almotalleb, intending then to open his mind to them; this  was done, and about forty of them came; but Abu Laheb, one of his uncles,  making the company break up before Mohammed had an opportunity of speaking,  obliged him to give them a second invitation the next day; and when they were  come, he made them the following speech: \"I know no man in all Arabia who can  offer his kindred a more excellent thing than I now do you.  I offer you  happiness, both in this life and in that which is to come.  GOD Almighty hath  commanded me to call you unto him; who therefore among you will be assisting  to me herein, and become my brother and my vicegerent?\"  All of them  hesitating,"]]]
