Everyone  else sat on benches at trestle tables, which could be folded up,  e.g. at night. Over the main door were the family arms. On the  upper parts of the walls could be foxskins and perhaps a polecat  skin, and keepers' and huntsmen's poles. There were often hawk  perches overhead. At the midday dinner, courses were ceremonially  brought in to music, and ritual bows were made to the lord. The  food at the head table was often tasted first by a servant as a  precaution against poison. Hounds, spaniels, and terriers lay near  the hearth and cats, often with litters, nestled nearby. They  might share in dinner, but the lord may keep a short stick near  him to defend morsels he meant for himself. Hunting, dove cotes,  and carp pools provided fresh meat. Fish was compulsory eating on  Fridays, on fast days, and during Lent. Cooking was done outside  on an open fire, roasting on spits and boiling in pots. Some spits  were mechanized with a cogged wheel and a weight at the end of a  string. Other spits were turned by a small boy shielded from the  heat by a wet blanket, or by dogs on a treadmill, or by a long  handle. Underneath the spit was a dripping pan to hold the falling  juices and fat. Mutton fat was used for candles. Bread, pies, and  pastry dishes were baked in an oven: a hole in a fireproof stone  wall fitted with an iron door, in which wood was first burnt to  heat the oven walls. It could also be used for drying fruit or  melting tallow. Fruits were also preserved in honey. Salt was  stored in a niche in the wall near the hearth and put on the table  in a salt cellar which became more elaborate over the years. Salt  was very valuable and gave rise to the praise of a man as the salt  of the earth. Costly imported spices such as cinnamon, cloves,  nutmeg, ginger, pepper, and a small quantity of sugar were kept in  chests. Pepper was always on the table to disguise the taste of  tainted meat. Drinks included wine, ale, cider from apples, perry  from pears, and mead. People carried and used their own knives.  There were no forks. Spoons were of silver or wood. People also  ate with their fingers and washed their hands before and after  meals. It was impolite to dig into the salt bowl with a knife not  previously wiped on bread or napkin, which was linen. It was  unmannerly to wipe one's knife or one's greasy fingers on the  tablecloth or, to use the tablecloth to blow one's nose. Feasts  were stately occasions with costly tables and splendid apparel.  There were practical jokes, innocent frolics, and witty verbal  debating with repartee. They played chess, checkers, and various  games with cards and dice. Most people could sing and some could  play the lute.    Lighting of the hall at night was by oil lamps or candles on  stands or on wall fixtures. For outside activities, a lantern [a  candle shielded by a metal cage with panels of finely shaved horn:  lant horn] was used. The residence of the lord's family and guests  was at a screened off area at the extreme end of the hall or on a  higher floor. Chests stored garments and jewels. Iron keys and  locks were used for chests and doors. The great bed had a wooden  frame and springs made of interlaced rope or strips of leather. It  was covered with a feather mattress, sheets, quilts, fur covers,  and pillows. Drapery around the bed kept out cold drafts and  provided privacy. There was a water bowl for washing in the  morning. A chamber pot was kept under the bed for nighttime use.  Hay was used as toilet-paper. The lord's personal servants slept  nearby on benches or trundle beds. Most of the gentlemen servants  slept communially in a \"knight's chamber\". The floor of the hall  was strewn with straw, on which common folk could sleep at night.  There were stools on which to sit. Cup boards (boards on which to  store cups) and chests stored spices and plate. One-piece iron  shears were available to cut cloth. Hand-held spindles were used  for weaving; one hand held the spindle [a small stick weighted at  one end] while the other hand alternately formed the thread and  wound it around the spindle. On the roofs there were rampart walks  for sentry patrols and parapets from which to shoot arrows or  throw things at besiegers. Each tenant of the demesne of the king  where he had a castle had to perform a certain amount of castle-  guard duty for its continuing defense. These knights performing  castle-guard duty slept at their posts. Bathing was done in a  wooden tub located in the garden in the summer and indoors near  the fire in winter. The great bed and tub for bathing were taken  on trips with the lord. The entire household was of men, except  for the lord's lady with a few lady companions; otherwise the  entire household was of men. The ladies rode pillion [on a cushion  behind the saddle] or in litters suspended between two horses.    Markets grew up outside castle walls. Any trade on a lord's land  was subject to \"passage\", a payment on goods passing through,  \"stallage\", a payment for setting up a stall or booth in a market,  and \"pontage\", a payment for taking goods across a bridge.    The Norman man was clean-shaven on his face and around his ears  and at the nape of the neck. His hair was short. He wore a long-  sleeved under-tunic of linen or wool that reached to his ankles.  Over this the Norman noble wore a tunic without sleeves, open at  the sides, and fastened with a belt. Over one shoulder was his  cloak, which was fastened on the opposite shoulder by being drawn  through a ring brooch and knotted. He wore tight thick cloth  stockings to protect him from the mud and leather shoes. Common  men wore durable, but drab, wool tunics to the knee so as not to  impede them in their work. They could roll up their stockings when  working in the fields. A lady also wore a high-necked, long-  sleeved linen or wool tunic fitted at the waist and laced at the  side, but full in the skirt, which reached to her toes. She wore a  jeweled belt, passed twice around her waist and knotted in front.  Her hair was often in two long braids, and her head and ears  covered with a white round cloth held in place by a metal circlet  like a small crown. Its ends were wound around her neck. In  winter, she wore over her tunic a cloak edged or lined with fur  and fastened at the front with a cord. Clothes of both men and  ladies were brightly colored by dyes or embroidery. The Norman  knight wore an over-tunic of leather or heavy linen on which were  sewn flat rings of iron and a conical iron helmet with nose cover.  He wore a sword at his waist and a metal shield on his back, or he  wore his sword and his accompanying retainers carried spear and  shield.    Norman customs were adopted by the nation. As a whole, Anglo-Saxon  men shaved their beards and whiskers from their faces, but they  kept their custom of long hair flowing from their heads. But a few  kept their whiskers and beards in protest of the Normans. Everyone  had a permanent surname indicating parentage, place of birth, or  residence, such as Field, Pitt, Lane, Bridge, Ford, Stone, Burn,  Church, Hill, Brook, Green. Other names came from occupations such  as Shepherd, Carter, Parker, Fowler, Hunter, Forester, Smith.  Still other came from personal characteristics such as Black,  Brown, and White, Short, Round, and Long. Some took their names  from animals such as Wolf, Fox, Lamb, Bull, Hogg, Sparrow, Crow,  and Swan. Others were called after the men they served, such as  King, Bishop, Abbot, Prior, Knight. A man's surname was passed on  to his son.    Those few coerls whose land was not taken by a baron remained free  and held their land \"in socage\" and became known as sokemen. They  were not fighting men, and did not give homage, but might give  fealty, i.e. fidelity. Many free sokemen were caught up in the  subjugation by baron landlords and were reduced almost to the  condition of the unfree villein. The services they performed for  their lords were often indistinguishable. They might also hold  their land by villein tenure, although free as a person with the  legal rights of a freeman. The freeman still had a place in court  proceedings which the unfree villein did not.    Great stone cathedrals were built in fortified towns for the  Conquerer's Norman bishops, who replaced the English bishops. Most  of the existing and new monasteries functioned as training grounds  for scholars, bishops, and statesmen rather than as retreats from  the world's problems to the security of religious observance. The  number of monks grew as the best minds were recruited into the  monasteries.    The Conquerer made the church subordinate to him. Bishops were  elected only subject to the King's consent. The bishops had to  accept the status of barons. Homage was exacted from them before  they were consecrated, and fealty and an oath afterward. The  Conquerer imposed knight's service on bishoprics, abbeys, and  monasteries, which was usually commuted to a monetary amount.  Bishops had to attend the King's court. Bishops could not leave  the realm without the King's consent. No royal tenant or royal  servant could be excommunicated, nor his lands be placed under  interdict, without the King's consent. Interdict could demand, for  instance, that the church be closed and the dead buried in  unconsecrated ground. No church rules could be made without his  agreement to their terms. No letters from the pope could be  received without the King's permission. The Archbishop of  Canterbury was still recognized as a primary advisor to the king.  Over the years, the selection for this office frequently became a  source of contention among king, pope, and clergy.    Men continued to give land to the church for their souls, such as  this grant which started the town of Sandwich: \"William, King of  the English, to Lanfranc the Archbishop and Hugoni de Montfort and  Richard son of Earl"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6615"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Our Own Land — Complete (#17)"],[1," and needless massacre took place at Whale's Neck. So angry was  the Great Spirit at this act of cruelty and treachery that he caused  blood to ooze from the soil, as he had made water leap for his thirsting  children, and never again would grass grow on the spot where the murder  had been done.          THE CRUMBLING SILVER    There is a clay bank on Little Neck, Long Island, where metallic nodules  are now and then exposed by rain. Rustics declare them to be silver, and  account for their crumbling on the theory that the metal is under a  curse. A century ago the Montauks mined it, digging over enough soil to  unearth these pellets now and again, and exchanging them at the nearest  settlements for tobacco and rum. The seeming abundance of these lumps of  silver aroused the cupidity of one Gardiner, a dweller in the central  wilderness of the island, but none of the Indians would reveal the source  of their treasure. One day Gardiner succeeded in getting an old chief so  tipsy that, without realizing what he was doing, he led the white man to  the clay bed and showed him the metallic spots glittering in the sun.  With a cry of delight Gardiner sprang forward and tore at the earth with  his fingers, while the Indian stood by laughing at his eagerness.    Presently a shade crossed the white man's face, for he thought that this  vast treasure would have to be shared by others. It was too much to  endure. He wanted all. He would be the richest man on earth. Stealing  behind the Indian as he stood swaying and chuckling, he wrenched the  hatchet from his belt and clove his skull at a blow. Then, dragging the  body to a thicket and hiding it under stones and leaves, he hurried to  his house for cart and pick and shovel, and returning with speed he dug  out a half ton of the silver before sunset. The cart was loaded, and he  set homeward, trembling with excitement and conjuring bright visions for  his future, when a wailing sound from a thicket made him halt and turn  pale. Noiselessly a figure glided from the bush. It was the Indian he had  killed. The form approached the treasure, flung up its arm, uttered a few  guttural words; then a rising wind seemed to lift it from the ground and  it drifted toward the Sound, fading like a cloud as it receded.    Full of misgiving, Gardiner drove to his home, and, by light of a  lantern, transferred his treasure to his cellar. Was it the dulness of  the candle that made the metal look so black? After a night of feverish  tossing on his bed he arose and went to the cellar to gloat upon his  wealth. The light of dawn fell on a heap of gray dust, a few brassy  looking particles showing here and there. The curse of the ghost had been  of power and the silver was silver no more. Mineralogists say that the  nodules are iron pyrites. Perhaps so; but old residents know that they  used to be silver.          THE CORTELYOU ELOPEMENT    In the Bath district of Brooklyn stands Cortelyou manor, built one  hundred and fifty years ago, and a place of defence during the Revolution  when the British made sallies from their camp in Flatbush and worried the  neighborhood. It was in one of these forays on pigs and chickens that a  gallant officer of red-coats met a pretty lass in the fields of  Cortelyou. He stilled her alarm by aiding her to gather wild-flowers, and  it came about that the girl often went into the fields and came back with  prodigious bouquets of daisies. The elder Cortelyou had no inkling of  this adventure until one of his sons saw her tryst with the red-coat at a  distance. Be sure the whole family joined him in remonstrance. As the  girl declared that she would not forego the meetings with her lover, the  father swore that she should never leave his roof again, and he tried to  be as good, or bad, as his word. The damsel took her imprisonment as any  girl of spirit would, but was unable to effect her escape until one  evening, as she sat at her window, watching the moon go down and paint  the harbor with a path of light. A tap at the pane, as of a pebble thrown  against it, roused her from her revery. It was her lover on the lawn.    At her eager signal he ran forward with a light ladder, planted it  against the window-sill, and in less than a minute the twain were running  toward the beach; but the creak of the ladder had been heard, and  grasping their muskets two of the men hurried out. In the track of the  moon the pursuers descried a moving form, and, without waiting to  challenge, they levelled the guns and fired. A woman's cry followed the  report; then a dip of oars was heard that fast grew fainter until it  faded from hearing. On returning to the house they found the girl's room  empty, and next morning her slipper was brought in from the mud at the  landing. Nobody inside of the American lines ever learned what that shot  had done, but if it failed to take a life it robbed Cortelyou of his  mind. He spent the rest of his days in a single room, chained to a staple  in the floor, tramping around and around, muttering and gesturing, and  sometimes startling the passer-by as he showed his white face and ragged  beard at the window.          VAN WEMPEL'S GOOSE    Allow us to introduce Nicholas Van Wempel, of Flatbush: fat, phlegmatic,  rich, and henpecked. He would like to be drunk because he is henpecked,  but the wife holds the purse-strings and only doles out money to him when  she wants groceries or he needs clothes. It was New Year's eve, the eve  of 1739, when Vrouw Van Wempel gave to her lord ten English shillings and  bade him hasten to Dr. Beck's for the fat goose that had been bespoken.  \"And mind you do not stop at the tavern,\" she screamed after him in her  shrillest tone. But poor Nicholas! As he went waddling down the road,  snapping through an ice-crust at every step, a roguish wind--or perhaps  it was one of the bugaboos that were known to haunt the shores of  Gravesend Bay--snatched off his hat and rolled it into the very doorway  of the tavern that he had been warned, under terrible penalties, to  avoid.    As he bent to pick it up the door fell ajar, and a pungency of schnapps  and tobacco went into his nostrils. His resolution, if he had one,  vanished. He ordered one glass of schnapps; friends came in and treated  him to another; he was bound to do as much for them; shilling by shilling  the goose money passed into the till of the landlord. Nicholas was heard  to make a muttered assertion that it was his own money anyhow, and that  while he lived he would be the head of his own house; then the mutterings  grew faint and merged into snores. When he awoke it was at the low sound  of voices in the next room, and drowsily turning his head he saw there  two strangers,--sailors, he thought, from their leather jackets, black  beards, and the rings in their ears. What was that they said? Gold? On  the marshes? At the old Flatlands tide-mill? The talkers had gone before  his slow and foggy brain could grasp it all, but when the idea had fairly  eaten its way into his intellect, he arose with the nearest approach to  alacrity that he had exhibited in years, and left the place. He crunched  back to his home, and seeing nobody astir went softly into his shed,  where he secured a shovel and lantern, and thence continued with all  consistent speed to the tumbledown tide-mill on the marsh,--a trying  journey for his fat legs on a sharp night, but hope and schnapps impelled  him.    He reached the mill, and, hastening to the cellar, began to probe in the  soft, unfrozen earth. Presently his spade struck something, and he dug  and dug until he had uncovered the top of a canvas bag,--the sort that  sailors call a \"round stern-chest.\" It took all his strength to lug it  out, and as he did so a seam burst, letting a shower of gold pieces over  the ground. He loosed the band of his breeches, and was filling the legs  thereof with coin, when a tread of feet sounded overhead and four men  came down the stair. Two of them he recognized as the fellows of the  tavern. They saw the bag, the lantern, then Nicholas. Laden though he was  with gold until he could hardly budge, these pirates, for such they were,  got him up-stairs, forced him to drink hot Hollands to the success of  their flag, then shot him through the window into the creek. As he was  about to make this unceremonious exit he clutched something to save  himself, and it proved to be a plucked goose that the pirates had stolen  from a neighboring farm and were going to sup on when they had scraped  their gold together. He felt the water and mud close over him; he  struggled desperately; he was conscious of breathing more freely and of  staggering off at a vigorous gait; then the power of all the schnapps  seemed to get into his head, and he remembered no more until he heard his  wife shrilling in his ears, when he sat up and found himself in a  snow-bank close to his house, with a featherless goose tight in his  grasp.    Vrouw Van Wempel cared less about the state of her spouse when she saw  that he had secured the bird, and whenever he told his tale of the  pirates she turned a deaf ear to him, for if he had found the gold why  did he not manage to bring home a few pieces of it? He, in answer, asked  how, as he had none of his own money, she could have come by the goose?  He often told his tale to sympathetic ears, and would point to the old  mill to prove that it was true.          THE WEARY WATCHER    Before the opening of the great bridge sent commerce rattling up  Washington Street in Brooklyn that thoroughfare was a shaded and  beautiful avenue, and among the houses that attested its respectability  was one, between Tillary and Concord Streets, that was long declared to  be haunted. A man and his wife dwelt there who seemed to be fondly  attached to each other, and whose love should have been the stronger  because of their three children none grew to years. A mutual sorrow is as  close a tie as a common"]]]
