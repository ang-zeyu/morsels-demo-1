Now you know what an important personage the  Sawhorse is, and if some one--perhaps yourself--will tell me your name,  your rank and station, and your history, it will give me pleasure to  relate them to the Sawhorse. This will lead to mutual respect and  friendship.\"    The Woozy was somewhat abashed by this speech and did not know how to  reply. But Ojo said:    \"This square beast is called the Woozy, and he isn't of much importance  except that he has three hairs growing on the tip of his tail.\"    The Scarecrow looked and saw that this was true.    \"But,\" said he, in a puzzled way, \"what makes those three hairs  important? The Shaggy Man has thousands of hairs, but no one has ever  accused him of being important.\"    So Ojo related the sad story of Unc Nunkie's transformation into a  marble statue, and told how he had set out to find the things the  Crooked Magician wanted, in order to make a charm that would restore  his uncle to life. One of the requirements was three hairs from a  Woozy's tail, but not being able to pull out the hairs they had been  obliged to take the Woozy with them.    The Scarecrow looked grave as he listened and he shook his head several  times, as if in disapproval.    \"We must see Ozma about this matter,\" he said. \"That Crooked Magician  is breaking the Law by practicing magic without a license, and I'm not  sure Ozma will allow him to restore your uncle to life.\"    \"Already I have warned the boy of that,\" declared the Shaggy Man.    At this Ojo began to cry. \"I want my Unc Nunkie!\" he exclaimed. \"I know  how he can be restored to life, and I'm going to do it--Ozma or no  Ozma! What right has this girl Ruler to keep my Unc Nunkie a statue  forever?\"    \"Don't worry about that just now,\" advised the Scarecrow. \"Go on to the  Emerald City, and when you reach it have the Shaggy Man take you to see  Dorothy. Tell her your story and I'm sure she will help you. Dorothy is  Ozma's best friend, and if you can win her to your side your uncle is  pretty safe to live again.\" Then he turned to the Woozy and said: \"I'm  afraid you are not important enough to be introduced to the Sawhorse,  after all.\"    \"I'm a better beast than he is,\" retorted the Woozy, indignantly. \"My  eyes can flash fire, and his can't.\"    \"Is this true?\" inquired the Scarecrow, turning to the Munchkin boy.    \"Yes,\" said Ojo, and told how the Woozy had set fire to the fence.    \"Have you any other accomplishments?\" asked the Scarecrow.    \"I have a most terrible growl--that is, sometimes,\" said the Woozy, as  Scraps laughed merrily and the Shaggy Man smiled. But the Patchwork  Girl's laugh made the Scarecrow forget all about the Woozy. He said to  her:    \"What an admirable young lady you are, and what jolly good company! We  must be better acquainted, for never before have I met a girl with such  exquisite coloring or such natural, artless manners.\"    \"No wonder they call you the Wise Scarecrow,\" replied Scraps.    \"When you arrive at the Emerald City I will see you again,\" continued  the Scarecrow. \"Just now I am going to call upon an old friend--an  ordinary young lady named Jinjur--who has promised to repaint my left  ear for me. You may have noticed that the paint on my left ear has  peeled off and faded, which affects my hearing on that side. Jinjur  always fixes me up when I get weather-worn.\"    \"When do you expect to return to the Emerald City?\" asked the Shaggy  Man.    \"I'll be there this evening, for I'm anxious to have a long talk with  Miss Scraps. How is it, Sawhorse; are you equal to a swift run?\"    \"Anything that suits you suits me,\" returned the wooden horse.    So the Scarecrow mounted to the jeweled saddle and waved his hat, when  the Sawhorse darted away so swiftly that they were out of sight in an  instant.          Chapter Fourteen    Ojo Breaks the Law      \"What a queer man,\" remarked the Munchkin boy, when the party had  resumed its journey.    \"And so nice and polite,\" added Scraps, bobbing her head. \"I think he  is the handsomest man I've seen since I came to life.\"    \"Handsome is as handsome does,\" quoted the Shaggy Man; \"but we must  admit that no living scarecrow is handsomer. The chief merit of my  friend is that he is a great thinker, and in Oz it is considered good  policy to follow his advice.\"    \"I didn't notice any brains in his head,\" observed the Glass Cat.    \"You can't see 'em work, but they're there, all right,\" declared the  Shaggy Man. \"I hadn't much confidence in his brains myself, when first  I came to Oz, for a humbug Wizard gave them to him; but I was soon  convinced that the Scarecrow is really wise; and, unless his brains  make him so, such wisdom is unaccountable.\"    \"Is the Wizard of Oz a humbug?\" asked Ojo.    \"Not now. He was once, but he has reformed and now assists Glinda the  Good, who is the Royal Sorceress of Oz and the only one licensed to  practice magic or sorcery. Glinda has taught our old Wizard a good many  clever things, so he is no longer a humbug.\"    They walked a little while in silence and then Ojo said:    \"If Ozma forbids the Crooked Magician to restore Unc Nunkie to life,  what shall I do?\"    The Shaggy Man shook his head.    \"In that case you can't do anything,\" he said. \"But don't be  discouraged yet. We will go to Princess Dorothy and tell her your  troubles, and then we will let her talk to Ozma. Dorothy has the  kindest little heart in the world, and she has been through so many  troubles herself that she is sure to sympathize with you.\"    \"Is Dorothy the little girl who came here from Kansas?\" asked the boy.    \"Yes. In Kansas she was Dorothy Gale. I used to know her there, and she  brought me to the Land of Oz. But now Ozma has made her a Princess, and  Dorothy's Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are here, too.\" Here the Shaggy Man  uttered a long sigh, and then he continued: \"It's a queer country, this  Land of Oz; but I like it, nevertheless.\"    \"What is queer about it?\" asked Scraps.    \"You, for instance,\" said he.    \"Did you see no girls as beautiful as I am in your own country?\" she  inquired.    \"None with the same gorgeous, variegated beauty,\" he confessed. \"In  America a girl stuffed with cotton wouldn't be alive, nor would anyone  think of making a girl out of a patchwork quilt.\"    \"What a queer country America must be!\" she exclaimed in great  surprise. \"The Scarecrow, whom you say is wise, told me I am the most  beautiful creature he has ever seen.\"    \"I know; and perhaps you are--from a scarecrow point of view,\" replied  the Shaggy Man; but why he smiled as he said it Scraps could not  imagine.    As they drew nearer to the Emerald City the travelers were filled with  admiration for the splendid scenery they beheld. Handsome houses stood  on both sides of the road and each had a green lawn before it as well  as a pretty flower garden.    \"In another hour,\" said the Shaggy Man, \"we shall come in sight of the  walls of the Royal City.\"    He was walking ahead, with Scraps, and behind them came the Woozy and  the Glass Cat. Ojo had lagged behind, for in spite of the warnings he  had received the boy's eyes were fastened on the clover that bordered  the road of yellow bricks and he was eager to discover if such a thing  as a six-leaved clover really existed.    Suddenly he stopped short and bent over to examine the ground more  closely. Yes; here at last was a clover with six spreading leaves. He  counted them carefully, to make sure. In an instant his heart leaped  with joy, for this was one of the important things he had come for--one  of the things that would restore dear Unc Nunkie to life.    He glanced ahead and saw that none of his companions was looking back.  Neither were any other people about, for it was midway between two  houses. The temptation was too strong to be resisted.    \"I might search for weeks and weeks, and never find another six-leaved  clover,\" he told himself, and quickly plucking the stem from the plant  he placed the prized clover in his basket, covering it with the other  things he carried there. Then, trying to look as if nothing had  happened, he hurried forward and overtook his comrades.    The Emerald City, which is the most splendid as well as the most  beautiful city in any fairyland, is surrounded by a high, thick wall of  green marble, polished smooth and set with glistening emeralds. There  are four gates, one facing the Munchkin Country, one facing the Country  of the Winkies, one facing the Country of the Quadlings and one facing  the Country of the Gillikins. The Emerald City lies directly in the  center of these four important countries of Oz. The gates had bars of  pure gold, and on either side of each gateway were built high towers,  from which floated gay banners. Other towers were set at distances  along the walls, which were broad enough for four people to walk  abreast upon.    This enclosure, all green and gold and glittering with precious gems,  was indeed a wonderful sight to greet our travelers, who first observed  it from the top of a little hill; but beyond the wall was the vast city  it surrounded, and hundreds of jeweled spires, domes and minarets,  flaunting flags and banners, reared their crests far above the towers  of the gateways. In the center of the city our friends could see the  tops of many magnificent trees, some nearly as tall as the spires of  the buildings, and the Shaggy Man told them that these trees were in  the royal gardens of Princess Ozma.    They stood a long time on the hilltop, feasting their eyes on the  splendor of the Emerald City.    \"Whee!\" exclaimed Scraps, clasping her padded hands in ecstacy,  \"that'll do for me to live in, all right. No more of the Munchkin  Country for these patches--and no more of the Crooked Magician!\"    \"Why, you belong to Dr. Pipt,\" replied Ojo, looking at her in  amazement. \"You were made for a servant, Scraps,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#17)"],[1,"the officers tumbled off their seats when Quox struck the  ground, but most of the dragon's passengers only felt a slight jar. All  were glad to be on solid earth again and they at once dismounted and  began to look about them. Queerly enough, as soon as they had left the  dragon, the seats that were strapped to the monster's back disappeared,  and this probably happened because there was no further use for them  and because Quox looked far more dignified in just his silver scales.  Of course he still wore the forty yards of ribbon around his neck, as  well as the great locket, but these only made him look \"dressed up,\" as  Betsy remarked.    Now the army of nomes had gathered thickly around the mouth of the  Tube, in order to be ready to capture the band of invaders as soon as  they popped out. There were, indeed, hundreds of nomes assembled, and  they were led by Guph, their most famous General. But they did not  expect the dragon to fly so high, and he shot out of the Tube so  suddenly that it took them by surprise. When the nomes had rubbed the  astonishment out of their eyes and regained their wits, they discovered  the dragon quietly seated on the mountainside far above their heads,  while the other strangers were standing in a group and calmly looking  down upon them.    General Guph was very angry at the escape, which was no one's fault but  his own.    \"Come down here and be captured!\" he shouted, waving his sword at them.    \"Come up here and capture us--if you dare!\" replied Queen Ann, who was  winding up the clockwork of her Private Soldier, so he could fight more  briskly.    Guph's first answer was a roar of rage at the defiance; then he turned  and issued a command to his nomes. These were all armed with sharp  spears and with one accord they raised these spears and threw them  straight at their foes, so that they rushed through the air in a  perfect cloud of flying weapons.    Some damage might have been done had not the dragon quickly crawled  before the others, his body being so big that it shielded every one of  them, including Hank. The spears rattled against the silver scales of  Quox and then fell harmlessly to the ground. They were magic spears, of  course, and all straightway bounded back into the hands of those who  had thrown them, but even Guph could see that it was useless to repeat  the attack.    It was now Queen Ann's turn to attack, so the Generals yelled  \"For--ward march!\" and the Colonels and Majors and Captains repeated  the command and the valiant Army of Oogaboo, which seemed to be  composed mainly of Tik-Tok, marched forward in single column toward the  nomes, while Betsy and Polychrome cheered and Hank gave a loud  \"Hee-haw!\" and Shaggy shouted \"Hooray!\" and Queen Ann screamed: \"At  'em, Tik-Tok--at 'em!\"    The nomes did not await the Clockwork Man's attack but in a twinkling  disappeared into the underground caverns. They made a great mistake in  being so hasty, for Tik-Tok had not taken a dozen steps before he  stubbed his copper toe on a rock and fell flat to the ground, where he  cried: \"Pick me up! Pick me up! Pick me up!\" until Shaggy and Files ran  forward and raised him to his feet again.    The dragon chuckled softly to himself as he scratched his left ear with  his hind claw, but no one was paying much attention to Quox just then.    It was evident to Ann and her officers that there could be no fighting  unless the enemy was present, and in order to find the enemy they must  boldly enter the underground Kingdom of the nomes. So bold a step  demanded a council of war.    \"Don't you think I'd better drop in on Ruggedo and obey the orders of  the Jinjin?\" asked Quox.    \"By no means!\" returned Queen Ann. \"We have already put the army of  nomes to flight and all that yet remains is to force our way into those  caverns, and conquer the Nome King and all his people.\"    \"That seems to me something of a job,\" said the dragon, closing his  eyes sleepily. \"But go ahead, if you like, and I'll wait here for you.  Don't be in any hurry on my account. To one who lives thousands of  years the delay of a few days means nothing at all, and I shall  probably sleep until the time comes for me to act.\"    Ann was provoked at this speech.    \"You may as well go back to Tititi-Hoochoo now,\" she said, \"for the  Nome King is as good as conquered already.\"    But Quox shook his head. \"No,\" said he; \"I'll wait.\"          Chapter Sixteen    The Naughty Nome      Shaggy Man had said nothing during the conversation between Queen Ann  and Quox, for the simple reason that he did not consider the matter  worth an argument. Safe within his pocket reposed the Love Magnet,  which had never failed to win every heart. The nomes, he knew, were not  like the heartless Roses and therefore could be won to his side as soon  as he exhibited the magic talisman.    Shaggy's chief anxiety had been to reach Ruggedo's Kingdom and now that  the entrance lay before him he was confident he would be able to rescue  his lost brother. Let Ann and the dragon quarrel as to who should  conquer the nomes, if they liked; Shaggy would let them try, and if  they failed he had the means of conquest in his own pocket.    But Ann was positive she could not fail, for she thought her Army could  do anything. So she called the officers together and told them how to  act, and she also instructed Tik-Tok what to do and what to say.    \"Please do not shoot your gun except as a last resort,\" she added, \"for  I do not wish to be cruel or to shed any blood--unless it is absolutely  necessary.\"    \"All right,\" replied Tik-Tok; \"but I do not think Rug-ge-do would bleed  if I filled him full of holes and put him in a ci-der press.\"    Then the officers fell in line, the four Generals abreast and then the  four Colonels and the four Majors and the four Captains. They drew  their glittering swords and commanded Tik-Tok to march, which he did.  Twice he fell down, being tripped by the rough rocks, but when he  struck the smooth path he got along better. Into the gloomy mouth of  the cavern entrance he stepped without hesitation, and after him  proudly pranced the officers and Queen Ann. The others held back a  little, waiting to see what would happen.    Of course the Nome King knew they were coming and was prepared to  receive them. Just within the rocky passage that led to the jeweled  throne-room was a deep pit, which was usually covered. Ruggedo had  ordered the cover removed and it now stood open, scarcely visible in  the gloom.    The pit was so large around that it nearly filled the passage and there  was barely room for one to walk around it by pressing close to the rock  walls. This Tik-Tok did, for his copper eyes saw the pit clearly and he  avoided it; but the officers marched straight into the hole and tumbled  in a heap on the bottom. An instant later Queen Ann also walked into  the pit, for she had her chin in the air and was careless where she  placed her feet. Then one of the nomes pulled a lever which replaced  the cover on the pit and made the officers of Oogaboo and their Queen  fast prisoners.    As for Tik-Tok, he kept straight on to the cavern where Ruggedo sat in  his throne and there he faced the Nome King and said:    \"I here-by con-quer you in the name of Queen Ann So-forth of Oo-ga-boo,  whose Ar-my I am, and I de-clare that you are her pris-on-er!\"    Ruggedo laughed at him.    \"Where is this famous Queen?\" he asked.    \"She'll be here in a min-ute,\" said Tik-Tok. \"Per-haps she stopped to  tie her shoe-string.\"    \"Now, see here, Tik-Tok,\" began the Nome King, in a stern voice, \"I've  had enough of this nonsense. Your Queen and her officers are all  prisoners, having fallen into my power, so perhaps you'll tell me what  you mean to do.\"    \"My or-ders were to con-quer you,\" replied Tik-Tok, \"and my  ma-chin-er-y has done the best it knows how to car-ry out those  or-ders.\"    Ruggedo pounded on his gong and Kaliko appeared, followed closely by  General Guph.    \"Take this copper man into the shops and set him to work hammering  gold,\" commanded the King. \"Being run by machinery he ought to be a  steady worker. He ought never to have been made, but since he exists I  shall hereafter put him to good use.\"    \"If you try to cap-ture me,\" said Tik-Tok, \"I shall fight.\"    \"Don't do that!\" exclaimed General Guph, earnestly, \"for it will be  useless to resist and you might hurt some one.\"    But Tik-Tok raised his gun and took aim and not knowing what damage the  gun might do the nomes were afraid to face it.    While he was thus defying the Nome King and his high officials, Betsy  Bobbin rode calmly into the royal cavern, seated upon the back of Hank  the mule. The little girl had grown tired of waiting for \"something to  happen\" and so had come to see if Ruggedo had been conquered.    \"Nails and nuggets!\" roared the King; \"how dare you bring that beast  here and enter my presence unannounced?\"    \"There wasn't anybody to announce me,\" replied Betsy. \"I guess your  folks were all busy. Are you conquered yet?\"    \"No!\" shouted the King, almost beside himself with rage.    \"Then please give me something to eat, for I'm awful hungry,\" said the  girl. \"You see, this conquering business is a good deal like waiting  for a circus parade; it takes a long time to get around and don't  amount to much anyhow.\"    The nomes were so much astonished at this speech that for a time they  could only glare at her silently, not finding words to reply. The King  finally recovered the use of his tongue and said:    \"Earth-crawler! this insolence to my majesty shall be your  death-warrant. You are an ordinary mortal, and to stop a mortal from  living is so easy a thing to do that I will not keep you waiting half  so long as you did for my conquest.\"    \"I'd rather you wouldn't stop me from living,\" remarked Betsy, getting  off Hank's back and standing beside him. \"And it would be a pretty  cheap King who killed a visitor while she"]]]
