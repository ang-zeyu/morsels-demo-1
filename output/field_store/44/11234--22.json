Many Bakwains  perished too. Their old men, who could have told us ancient stories,  perished in these flights. An intelligent Mokwain related to me how the  Bushmen effectually balked a party of his tribe which lighted on their  village in a state of burning thirst. Believing, as he said, that  nothing human could subsist without water, they demanded some, but were  coolly told by these Bushmen that they had none, and never drank any.  Expecting to find them out, they resolved to watch them night and day.  They persevered for some days, thinking that at last the water must  come forth; but, notwithstanding their watchfulness, kept alive by most  tormenting thirst, the Bakwains were compelled to exclaim, \"Yak! yak!  these are not men; let us go.\" Probably the Bushmen had been subsisting  on a store hidden under ground, which had eluded the vigilance of their  visitors.

Such was the desert which we were now preparing to cross--a region  formerly of terror to the Bechuanas from the numbers of serpents which  infested it and fed on the different kinds of mice, and from the intense  thirst which these people often endured when their water-vessels were  insufficient for the distances to be traveled over before reaching the  wells.    Just before the arrival of my companions, a party of the people of the  lake came to Kolobeng, stating that they were sent by Lechulatebe,  the chief, to ask me to visit that country. They brought such flaming  accounts of the quantities of ivory to be found there (cattle-pens  made of elephants' tusks of enormous size, &c.), that the guides of the  Bakwains were quite as eager to succeed in reaching the lake as any one  of us could desire. This was fortunate, as we knew the way the strangers  had come was impassable for wagons.    Messrs. Oswell and Murray came at the end of May, and we all made a  fair start for the unknown region on the 1st of June, 1849. Proceeding  northward, and passing through a range of tree-covered hills to  Shokuane, formerly the residence of the Bakwains, we soon after entered  on the high road to the Bamangwato, which lies generally in the bed of  an ancient river or wady that must formerly have flowed N. to S. The  adjacent country is perfectly flat, but covered with open forest and  bush, with abundance of grass; the trees generally are a kind of acacia  called \"Monato\", which appears a little to the south of this region, and  is common as far as Angola. A large caterpillar, called \"Nato\", feeds by  night on the leaves of these trees, and comes down by day to bury itself  at the root in the sand, in order to escape the piercing rays of the  sun. The people dig for it there, and are fond of it when roasted, on  account of its pleasant vegetable taste. When about to pass into the  chrysalis state, it buries itself in the soil, and is sometimes  sought for as food even then. If left undisturbed, it comes forth as a  beautiful butterfly: the transmutation was sometimes employed by me with  good effect when speaking with the natives, as an illustration of our  own great change and resurrection.    The soil is sandy, and there are here and there indications that at  spots which now afford no water whatever there were formerly wells and  cattle stations.    Boatlanama, our next station, is a lovely spot in the otherwise dry  region. The wells from which we had to lift out the water for our cattle  are deep, but they were well filled. A few villages of Bakalahari were  found near them, and great numbers of pallahs, springbucks, Guinea-fowl,  and small monkeys.    Lopepe came next. This place afforded another proof of the desiccation  of the country. The first time I passed it, Lopepe was a large pool with  a stream flowing out of it to the south; now it was with difficulty we  could get our cattle watered by digging down in the bottom of a well.    At Mashue--where we found a never-failing supply of pure water in a  sandstone rocky hollow--we left the road to the Bamangwato hills, and  struck away to the north into the Desert. Having watered the cattle at  a well called Lobotani, about N.W. of Bamangwato, we next proceeded to  a real Kalahari fountain, called Serotli. The country around is covered  with bushes and trees of a kind of leguminosae, with lilac flowers. The  soil is soft white sand, very trying to the strength of the oxen, as  the wheels sink into it over the felloes and drag heavily. At Serotli we  found only a few hollows like those made by the buffalo and rhinoceros  when they roll themselves in the mud. In a corner of one of these there  appeared water, which would have been quickly lapped up by our dogs, had  we not driven them away. And yet this was all the apparent supply for  some eighty oxen, twenty horses, and about a score of men. Our guide,  Ramotobi, who had spent his youth in the Desert, declared that, though  appearances were against us, there was plenty of water at hand. We  had our misgivings, for the spades were soon produced; but our guides,  despising such new-fangled aid, began in good earnest to scrape out the  sand with their hands. The only water we had any promise of for the next  seventy miles--that is, for a journey of three days with the wagons--was  to be got here. By the aid of both spades and fingers two of the holes  were cleared out, so as to form pits six feet deep and about as many  broad. Our guides were especially earnest in their injunctions to us not  to break through the hard stratum of sand at the bottom, because they  knew, if it were broken through, \"the water would go away.\" They are  quite correct, for the water seems to lie on this flooring of incipient  sandstone. The value of the advice was proved in the case of an  Englishman whose wits were none of the brightest, who, disregarding  it, dug through the sandy stratum in the wells at Mohotluani: the water  immediately flowed away downward, and the well became useless. When  we came to the stratum, we found that the water flowed in on all sides  close to the line where the soft sand came in contact with it. Allowing  it to collect, we had enough for the horses that evening; but as there  was not sufficient for the oxen, we sent them back to Lobotani, where,  after thirsting four full days (ninety-six hours), they got a good  supply. The horses were kept by us as necessary to procure game for the  sustenance of our numerous party. Next morning we found the water  had flowed in faster than at first, as it invariably does in these  reservoirs, owing to the passages widening by the flow. Large quantities  of the sand come into the well with the water, and in the course of a  few days the supply, which may be equal to the wants of a few men  only, becomes sufficient for oxen as well. In these sucking-places the  Bakalahari get their supplies; and as they are generally in the hollows  of ancient river-beds, they are probably the deposits from rains  gravitating thither; in some cases they may be the actual fountains,  which, though formerly supplying the river's flow, now no longer rise to  the surface.    Here, though the water was perfectly inaccessible to elands, large  numbers of these fine animals fed around us; and, when killed, they  were not only in good condition, but their stomachs actually contained  considerable quantities of water.    I examined carefully the whole alimentary canal, in order to see if  there were any peculiarity which might account for the fact that this  animal can subsist for months together without drinking, but found  nothing. Other animals, such as the duiker ('Cephalopus mergens')  or puti (of the Bechuanas), the steinbuck ('Tragulus rupestris') or  puruhuru, the gemsbuck ('Oryx capensis') or kukama, and the porcupine  ('Hystrix cristata'), are all able to subsist without water for many  months at a time by living on bulbs and tubers containing moisture. They  have sharp-pointed hoofs well adapted for digging, and there is little  difficulty in comprehending their mode of subsistence. Some animals,  on the other hand, are never seen but in the vicinity of water. The  presence of the rhinoceros, of the buffalo and gnu ('Catoblepas gnu'),  of the giraffe, the zebra, and pallah ('Antilope melampus'), is always  a certain indication of water being within a distance of seven or  eight miles; but one may see hundreds of elands ('Boselaphus oreas'),  gemsbuck, the tolo or koodoo ('Strepsiceros capensis'), also springbucks  ('Gazella euchore') and ostriches, without being warranted thereby in  inferring the presence of water within thirty or forty miles. Indeed,  the sleek, fat condition of the eland in such circumstances would not  remove the apprehension of perishing by thirst from the mind of even a  native. I believe, however, that these animals can subsist only where  there is some moisture in the vegetation on which they feed; for in one  year of unusual drought we saw herds of elands and flocks of ostriches  crowding to the Zouga from the Desert, and very many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10430"],[0,"Trips to the Moon (#18)"],[1,"reason that the Athenians have left off sacrificing to  me for so many years? do they think of building up the Olympian  temple again? are the thieves taken that robbed the Dodonaean?\"  When I had answered all these, \"Pray, Menippus,\" said he, \"what does  mankind really think of me?\"  \"How should they think of you,\" said  I, \"but with the utmost veneration, that you are the great sovereign  of the gods.\"  \"There you jest,\" said he, \"I am sure; I know well  enough how fond they are of novelty, though you will not own it.  There was a time, indeed, when I was held in some estimation, when I  was the great physician, when I was everything, in short--         \"When streets, and lanes, and all was full of Jove.\" {183a}    Pisa {183b} and Dodona {183c} were distinguished above every place,  and I could not see for the smoke of sacrifices; but, since Apollo  has set up his oracle at Delphi, and AEsculapius practises physic at  Pergamus; since temples have been erected to Bendis {183d} at  Thrace, to Anubis in Egypt, and to Diana at Ephesus, everybody runs  after them; with them they feast, to them they offer up their  hecatombs, and think it honour enough for a worn-out god, as I am,  if they sacrifice once in six years at Olympia; whilst my altars are  as cold and neglected as Plato's laws, {184} or the syllogisms of  Chrysippus.\"    With this and such-like chat we passed away the time, till we came  to the place where the petitions were to be heard.  Here we found  several holes, with covers to them, and close to every one was  placed a golden chair.  Jupiter sat down in the first he came to,  and lifting up the lid, listened to the prayers, which, as you may  suppose, were of various kinds.  I stooped down and heard several of  them myself, such as, \"O Jupiter, grant me a large empire!\"  \"O  Jupiter, may my leeks and onions flourish and increase!\"  \"Grant  Jupiter, that my father may die soon!\"  \"Grant I may survive my  wife!\"  \"Grant I may not be discovered, whilst I lay wait for my  brother!\"  \"Grant that I may get my cause!\"  \"Grant that I may be  crowned at Olympia!\"  One sailor asked for a north wind, another for  a south; the husbandman prayed for rain, and the fuller for  sunshine.  Jupiter heard them all, but did not promise everybody--                        \"--some the just request,       He heard propitious, and denied the rest.\" {185a}    Those prayers which he thought right and proper he let up through  the hole, and blew the wicked and foolish ones back, that they might  not rise to heaven.  One petition, indeed, puzzled him a little; two  men asking favours of him directly contrary to each other, at the  same time, and promising the same sacrifice; he was at a loss which  to oblige; he became immediately a perfect Academic, and like  Pyrrho, {185b} was held in suspense between them.  When he had done  with the prayers, he sat down upon the next chair, over another  hole, and listened to those who were swearing and making vows.  When  he had finished this business, and destroyed Hermodorus, the  Epicurean, for perjury, he removed to the next seat, and gave  audience to the auguries, oracles, and divinations; which having  despatched, he proceeded to the hole that brought up the fume of the  victims, together with the name of the sacrificer.  Then he gave out  his orders to the winds and storms:  \"Let there be rain to-day in  Scythia, lightning in Africa, and snow in Greece; do you, Boreas,  blow in Lydia, and whilst Notus lies still, let the north wind raise  the waves of the Adriatic, and about a thousand measures of hail be  sprinkled over Cappadocia.\"    When Jupiter had done all his business we repaired to the feast, for  it was now supper-time, and Mercury bade me sit down by Pan, the  Corybantes, Attis, and Sabazius, a kind of demi-gods who are  admitted as visitors there.  Ceres served us with bread, and Bacchus  with wine; Hercules handed about the flesh, Venus scattered myrtles,  and Neptune brought us fish; not to mention that I got slyly a  little nectar and ambrosia, for my friend Ganymede, out of good-  nature, if he saw Jove looking another way, would frequently throw  me in a cup or two.  The greater gods, as Homer tells us {187a}  (who, I suppose, had seen them as well as myself,) never taste meat  or wine, but feed upon ambrosia and get drunk with nectar, at the  same time their greatest luxury is, instead of victuals, to suck in  the fumes that rise from the victims, and the blood of the  sacrifices that are offered up to them.  Whilst we were at supper,  Apollo played on the harp, Silenus danced a cordax, and the Muses  repeated Hesiod's Theogony, and the first Ode of Pindar.  When these  recreations were over we all retired tolerably well soaked, {187b}  to bed,         \"Now pleasing rest had sealed each mortal eye,        And even immortal gods in slumber lie,        All but myself--\" {187c}    I could not help thinking of a thousand things, and particularly how  it came to pass that, during so long a time Apollo {188a} should  never have got him a beard, and how there came to be night in  heaven, though the sun is always present there and feasting with  them.  I slept a little, and early in the morning Jupiter ordered  the crier to summon a council of the gods, and when they were all  assembled, thus addressed himself to them.    \"The stranger who came here yesterday, is the chief cause of my  convening you this day.  I have long wanted to talk with you  concerning the philosophers, and the complaints now sent to us from  the Moon make it immediately necessary to take the affair into  consideration.  There is lately sprung up a race of men, slothful,  quarrelsome, vain-glorious, foolish, petulant, gluttonous, proud,  abusive, in short what Homer calls,         \"An idle burthen to the ground.\" {188b}    These, dividing themselves into sects, run through all the  labyrinths of disputation, calling themselves Stoics, Academics,  Epicureans, Peripatetics, and a hundred other names still more  ridiculous; then wrapping themselves up in the sacred veil of  virtue, they contract their brows and let down their beards, under a  specious appearance hiding the most abandoned profligacy; like one  of the players on the stage, if you strip him of his fine habits  wrought with gold, all that remains behind is a ridiculous spectacle  of a little contemptible fellow, hired to appear there for seven  drachmas.  And yet these men despise everybody, talk absurdly of the  gods, and drawing in a number of credulous boys, roar to them in a  tragical style about virtue, and enter into disputations that are  endless and unprofitable.  To their disciples they cry up fortitude  and temperance, a contempt of riches and pleasures, and, when alone,  indulge in riot and debauchery.  The most intolerable of all is,  that though they contribute nothing towards the good and welfare of  the community, though they are         \"Unknown alike in council and in field;\" {189}    yet are they perpetually finding fault with, abusing, and reviling  others, and he is counted the greatest amongst them who is most  impudent, noisy, and malevolent; if one should say to one of these  fellows who speak ill of everybody, 'What service are you of to the  commonwealth?' he would reply, if he spoke fairly and honestly, 'To  be a sailor or a soldier, or a husbandman, or a mechanic, I think  beneath me; but I can make a noise and look dirty, wash myself in  cold water, go barefoot all winter, and then, like Momus, find fault  with everybody else; if any rich man sups luxuriously, I rail at,  and abuse him; but if any of my friends or acquaintance fall sick,  and want my assistance, I take no notice of them.'    \"Such, my brother gods, are the cattle {190} which I complain of;  and of all these the Epicureans are the worst, who assert that the  gods take no care of human affairs, or look at all into them:  it is  high time, my brethren, that we should take this matter into  consideration, for if once they can persuade the people to believe  these things, you must all starve; for who will sacrifice to you,  when they can get nothing by it?  What the Moon accuses you of, you  all heard yesterday from the stranger; consult, therefore, amongst  yourselves, and determine what may best promote the happiness of  mankind, and our own security.\"  When Jupiter had thus spoken, the  assembly rung with repeated cries, of \"thunder, and lightning! burn,  consume, destroy! down with them into the pit, to Tartarus, and the  giants!\"  Jove, however, once more commanding silence, cried out,  \"It shall be done as you desire; they and their philosophy shall  perish together:  but at present, no punishments must be inflicted;  for these four months to come, as you all know, it is a solemn  feast, and I have declared a truce:  next year, in the beginning of  the spring, my lightning shall destroy them.    \"As to Menippus, first cutting off his wings that he may not come  here again, let Mercury carry him down to the earth.\"    Saying this, he broke up the assembly, and Mercury taking me up by  my right ear, brought me down, and left me yesterday evening in the  Ceramicus.  And now, my friend, you have heard everything I had to  tell you from heaven; I must take my leave, and carry this good news  to the philosophers, who are walking in the Poecile.
