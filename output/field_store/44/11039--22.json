Hail! Hail!      Be greeted! Be greeted!      Welcome, O Gunther!      Hail! Hail! Hail!            _Gunther steps out of the boat with Brünnhilde._    THE VASSALS            [_Range themselves respectfully to receive them._        Welcome, Gunther!  Health to thee and to thy bride!            [_They strike their weapons loudly together._    GUNTHER            [_Presenting Brünnhilde, who follows him with pale          face and lowered eyes, to the men._    Brünnhild', a peerless bride,  Here to the Rhine I bring.      No man ever won      A nobler woman!  The Gods have shown from of old  Grace to the Gibichung stock.      To fame unmatched      Now may it mount!    THE VASSALS [_Solemnly clash their weapons._    Hail! O hail, happy Gibichung!    GUNTHER            [_Leads Brünnhilde, who never raises her eyes,          to the hall, from which Siegfried and Gutrune,          attended by women, now come forth. Gunther stops          before the hall._    Dear hero, greetings glad!  I greet thee, fair sister!  By him who won thee for wife  I joyfully see thee stand.      Two happy pairs      Here radiant are shining:            [_He draws Brünnhilde forward._    Brünnhild'--and Gunther,  Gutrun'--and Siegfried.            [_Brünnhilde, startled, looks up and sees          Siegfried. Her eyes remain fixed on him in          amazement. Gunther, who has released her violently          trembling hand, shows, as do all present, blank          astonishment at her behaviour._    THE VASSALS and WOMEN        What ails her?      Has she gone mad?    SIEGFRIED            [_Goes a few steps towards Brünnhilde, who has          begun to tremble._    Why looks Brünnhild' amazed?    BRÜNNHILDE [_Scarcely able to control herself._    Siegfried ... here? Gutrune....    SIEGFRIED    Gunther's gentle sister,      Wed to me      As thou to him.    BRÜNNHILDE [_With fearful vehemence._    I? Gunther? 'Tis false.            [_She sways and seems about to fall. Siegfried          supports her._    Light fades from mine eyes. ..            [_In Siegfried's arms, looking faintly up at him._    Siegfried ... knows me not?    SIEGFRIED    Gunther, see, thy wife is swooning!            [_Gunther comes to them._        Wake, Brünnhild', wake!      Here stands thy husband.    BRÜNNHILDE            [_Perceives the ring on Siegfried's outstretched          finger, and starts up with terrible vehemence._        Ha! The ring      Upon his hand!      He ... Siegfried?    THE VASSALS    What's wrong?    HAGEN            [_Coming among the vassals from behind._        Now pay good heed      To the woman's tale.    BRÜNNHILDE            [_Mastering her terrible excitement, tries to          control herself._        On thy hand there      I beheld a ring.      'Twas wrested from me      By this man here;            [_Pointing to Gunther._        'Tis not thine.      How earnest thou by      The ring thou hast on?    SIEGFRIED            [_Attentively regarding the ring on his finger._    'Twas not from him  I got the ring.    BRÜNNHILDE [_To Gunther._    Thou who didst seize the ring  With which I wedded thee,  Declare to him thy right,  Make him yield up the pledge!      GUNTHER [_In great perplexity._    The ring? No ring I gave him,  Though thou dost know it well.    BRÜNNHILDE    Where hast thou hid the ring  That thou didst capture from me?            [_Gunther, greatly confused, does not answer._    BRÜNNHILDE [_Breaking out furiously._    Ha! He it was  Who despoiled me of the ring--  Siegfried, the treacherous thief!            [_All look expectantly at Siegfried, who seems to          be lost in far-off thoughts as he contemplates the          ring._    SIEGFRIED        No woman gave      The ring to me,      Nor did I wrest it      From a woman's grasp.      This ring, I know,      Was the booty won  When at Neidhöhl' boldly I fought,  And the mighty dragon was slain.    HAGEN            [_Stepping between them._    Brünnhild', dauntless queen,  Knowest thou this ring well?  If it was by Gunther won,      Then it is his,  And Siegfried has got it by guile.  For his guilt must the traitor pay.    BRÜNNHILDE [_Shrieking in terrible anguish._        Betrayed! Betrayed!      Shamefully betrayed!      Deceived! Deceived!      Wrong too deep for revenge!    GUTRUNE        A wrong? To whom?    VASSALS and WOMEN        Deceit? To whom?    BRÜNNHILDE        Holy Gods!      Ye heavenly rulers!      Whispered ye this      In councils dark?      If I must bear      More than ever was borne,      Bowed by a shame      None ever endured,      Teach me such vengeance      As never was raved!      Kindle such wrath      As can never be calmed!      Order Brünnhild's      Poor heart to be broken,      Bring ye but doom      On him who betrayed!    GUNTHER        Brünnhild', dear wife,      Control thyself!    BRÜNNHILDE        Away, betrayer!      Self-betrayed one!      All of you, hearken!      Not he,      But that man there,      Won me to wife.    VASSALS and WOMEN    Siegfried? Gutrune's lord?    BRÜNNHILDE        He forced delight      And love from me.    SIEGFRIED        Dost thou so lightly      Hold thine honour,  The tongue that thus defames it  I must convict of its falsehood.  Hear whether faith I broke!      Blood-brotherhood  I have sworn unto Gunther;  Nothung, my trusty sword,  Guarded the sacred vow;  'Twixt me and this sad woman distraught  Its blade lay sharp.    BRÜNNHILDE        Behold how thou liest,      Crafty man,      Vainly as witness      Citing thy sword!      Full well I know its keenness,      And also the scabbard      Wherein so snugly      Hung on the wall  Nothung, the faithful friend,  When its lord won the woman he loved.    VASSALS and WOMEN            [_Crowd together in violent indignation._    What! Siegfried a traitor?  Has he stained Gunther's honour?    GUNTHER [_To Siegfried._        Disgraced were I      And sullied my name,      Were not the slander      Cast in her teeth!    GRUTUNE        Siegfried faithless?      False to his vow?      Ah, prove thou that worthless      Is her word!    THE VASSALS        Clear thyself straight;      If thou art wronged      Silence the slander;      Sworn be the oath!    SIEGFRIED        If I must swear,      The slander to still,      Which of you offers      His sword for the oath?    HAGEN    Swear the oath upon      The point of my spear;  Bad faith 'twill surely avenge.            [_The vassals form a ring round Siegfried and          Hagen. Hagen holds out the spear; Siegfried lays          two fingers of his right hand upon the point._    SIEGFRIED        Shining steel!      Weapon most holy,  Witness my oath sworn for ever!      On this spear's sharp point      I solemnly swear;  Spear-point, mark thou my words!      If weapon must pierce me,      Thine be the point!      When by death I am stricken      Strike thou the blow,  If what she tells is true,  And I broke faith with my friend!    BRÜNNHILDE            [_Strides furiously into the ring, tears          Siegfried's hand from the spear, and grasps the          point with her own._        Shining steel!      Weapon most holy,  Witness my oath sworn for ever!      On this spear's sharp point      I solemnly swear!  Spear-point, mark thou my words!      Devoted be thy might      To his undoing!      Be thy sharpness blessed by me,      That it may slay him!  For broken his oaths have been all,  And false is what he has sworn.    THE VASSALS        Help, Donner!      Roar with thy thunder  To silence this terrible shame!    SIEGFRIED    Gunther, look to this woman  Who falsely slanders thy name.  Let her rest awhile,  The untamed mountain maid,  That the unbridled rage some demon      In malice has      Against us roused  May have the chance to subside.  Ye vassals, go ye your ways;  Let the womenfolk scold.  Like cravens gladly we yield,  Comes it to fighting with tongues.            [_He goes up to Gunther._    Thou art not so vexed as I  That I beguiled her ill;  The Tarnhelm must, I fear,  But half have hid my face.      Still, women's wrath      Soon is appeased:  That I won her for thee  Thankful thy wife will be yet.            [_He turns again to the vassals._    Follow me, men,  With mirth to the feast!            [_To the women._        Gaily, women,      Help at the wedding!      Joyfully laugh      Love and delight!      In hall and grove      There shall be none  This day more merry than I!      Ye whom love has blessed,      Like myself light-hearted,  Follow and share in my mirth!            [_He throws his arm in the highest spirits round          Gutrune and draws her into the hall. The vassals          and women follow, carried away by his example. All          go off, except Brünnhilde, Gunther, and Hagen.          Gunther, in deep shame and dejection, with his          face covered, has seated himself on one side.          Brünnhilde, standing in the foreground, gazes for          some time sorrowfully after Siegfried and Gutrune,          then droops her head._    [Illustration]    BRÜNNHILDE [_Lost in thought._        What dread demon's might      Moves here in darkness?      By what wizard's spell      Worked was the woe?      How weak is my wisdom      Faced by this puzzle!      And where shall I find      The runes for this riddle?      Oh, sorrow! Sorrow!      Woe's me! Woe's me!      I gave all my wisdom to him;            [_With increasing emotion._        The maid in his power      He holds.      Fast in his fetters      Bound is the booty  That, weeping her grievous shame,  Gaily to others he gives!  Will none of you lend a sword  With which I may sever my bonds?    HAGEN            [_Going close to Brünnhilde._        Leave that to me,      O wife betrayed;      I will avenge      Thy trust deceived.    BRÜNNHILDE [_Looking round dully._        On whom?    HAGEN    On Siegfried,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49525"],[0,"First Lensman (#17)"],[1,"erators--quick on the uptake.\"    \"I'd better get at this, sir, don't you think, and let Operation  Boskone go for a while?\" Costigan asked.    \"I don't think so.\" Kinnison frowned in thought. \"This operation was  _planned_, son, by people with brains. Any clues you could find now  would undoubtedly be plants. No, we'll let the regulars look; we'll  stick to our own ...\"    Sirens wailed and screamed outside. Kinnison sent out an exploring  thought.    \"Alex?\"    \"Yes. Where do you want this ninety-sixty with the doctors and nurses?  It's too wide for the gates.\"    \"Go through the wall. Across the lawn. Right up to the door, and never  mind the frippery they've got all over the place--have your adjutant  tell them to bill us for damage. Samms is shot in the shoulder. Not too  serious, but I'm taking him to the Hill, where I know he'll be safe.  What have you got on top of the umbrella, the _Boise_ or the _Chicago_?  I haven't had time to look up yet.\"    \"Both.\"    \"Good man.\"    Jack Kinnison started at the monstrous tank, which was smashing  statues, fountains, and ornamental trees flat into the earth as it  moved ponderously across the grounds, and licked his lips. He looked  at the companies of soldiers \"frisking\" the route, the grounds, and  the crowd--higher up, at the hovering helicopters--still higher,  at the eight light cruisers so evidently and so viciously ready to  blast--higher still, at the long streamers of fire which, he now knew,  marked the locations of the two most powerful engines of destruction  ever built by man--and his face turned slowly white.    \"Good Lord, Dad!\" he swallowed twice. \"I had no idea ... but they  might, at that.\"    \"Not 'might', son. They damn well would, if they could get here soon  enough with heavy enough stuff.\" The elder Kinnison's jaw-muscles  did not loosen, his darting eyes did not relax their vigilance for  a fraction of a second as he Lensed the thought. \"You boys can't be  expected to know it all, but right now you're learning fast. Get  this--paste it in your iron hats. _Virgil Samms' life is the most  important thing in this whole damned universe!_ If they had got him  then it would not, strictly speaking, have been my fault, but if they  get him now, it will be.\"    The land cruiser crunched to a stop against the very entrance, and a  white-clad man leaped out.    \"Let me look at him, please...\"    \"Not yet!\" Kinnison denied, sharply. \"Not until he's got four inches  of solid steel between him and whoever wants to finish the job they  started. Get your men around him, and get him aboard--fast!\"    Samms, protected at every point at every instant, was lifted into the  maw of the ninety-sixty; and as the massive door clanged shut Kinnison  heaved a tremendous sigh of relief. The cavalcade moved away.    \"Coming with us, Rod?\" Commodore Clayton shouted.    \"Yes, but got a couple minutes' work here yet. Have a staff car wait  for me, and I'll join you.\" He turned to the three young Lensmen and  the girl. \"This fouls up our plans a little, but not too much--I  hope. No change in Mateese or Boskone; you and Costigan, Jill, can go  ahead as planned. Northrop, you'll have to brief Jill on Zwilnik and  find out what she knows. Virgil was going to do it tonight, after the  brawl here, but you know as much about it now as any of us. Check with  Knobos, DalNalten, and Fletcher--while Virgil is laid up you and Jack  may have to work on both Zabriska and Zwilnik--he'll Lens you. Get the  dope, then do as you think best. Get going!\" He strode away toward the  waiting staff-car.    \"Boskone? Zwilnik?\" Jill demanded. \"What gives? What are they, Jack?\"    \"We don't know yet--maybe we're going to name a couple of planets...\"    \"Piffle!\" she scoffed. \"Can _you_ talk sense, Mase? What's Boskone?\"    \"A simple, distinctive, pronounceable coined word; suggested, I  believe, by Dr. Bergenholm ...\" he began.    \"You know what I mean, you ...\" she broke in, but was silenced by a  sharply Lensed thought from Jack. His touch was very light, barely  sufficient to make conversation possible; but even so, she flinched.    \"Use your brain, Jill; you aren't thinking a lick--not that you can be  blamed for it. Stop talking; there may be lip-readers or high-powered  listeners around. This feels funny, doesn't it?\" He twitched mentally  and went on: \"You already know what Operation Mateese is, since it's  your own dish--politics. Operation Zwilnik is drugs, vice, and so on.  Operation Boskone is pirates; Spud is running that. Operation Zabriska  is Mase and me checking some peculiar disturbances in the sub-ether.  Come in, Mase, and do your stuff--I'll see you later, aboard. Clear  ether, Jill!\"    Young Kinnison vanished from the fringes of her mind and Northrop  appeared. And what a difference! His mind touched hers as gingerly as  Jack's had done; as skittishly, as instantaneously ready to bolt away  from anything in the least degree private. However, Jack's mind had  rubbed hers the wrong way, right from the start--and Mase's didn't!    \"Now, about this Operation Zwilnik,\" Jill began.    \"Something else first. I couldn't help noticing, back there, that you  and Jack ... well, not out of phase, exactly, or really out of sync,  but sort of ... well, as though ...\"    \"'Hunting'?\" she suggested.    \"Not exactly ... 'forcing' might be better--like holding a tight beam  together when it wants to fall apart. So you noticed it yourself?\"    \"Of course, but I thought Jack and I were the only ones who did. Like  scratching a blackboard with your finger-nails--you _can_ do it, but  you're awfully glad to stop ... and I _like_ Jack, too, darn it--at a  distance.\"    \"And you and I fit like precisely tuned circuits. Jack really meant it,  then, when he said that you ... that is, he ... I didn't quite believe  it until now, but if ... you know, of course, what you've already done  to me.\"    Jill's block went on, full strength. She arched her eyebrows and spoke  aloud--\"why, I haven't the _faintest_ idea!\"    \"Of course not. That's why you're using voice. I've found out, too,  that I can't lie with my mind. I feel like a heel and a louse, with  so much job ahead, but you've simply got to tell me something.  Then--whatever you say--I'll hit the job with everything I've got. Do I  get heaved out between planets without a space-suit, or not?\"    \"I don't think so.\" Jill blushed vividly, but her voice was steady.  \"You would rate a space-suit, and enough oxygen to reach another  plan--another goal. And now we'd better get to work, don't you think?\"    \"Yes. Thanks, Jill, a million. I know as well as you do that I was  talking out of turn, and how much--but I had to know.\" He breathed  deep. \"And that's all I ask--for now. Cut your screens.\"    She lowered her mental barriers, finding it surprisingly easy to do so  in this case; let them down almost as far as she was in the habit of  doing with her father. He explained in flashing thoughts everything he  knew of the four Operations, concluding:    \"I'm not assigned to Zabriska permanently; I'll probably work with you  on Mateese after your father gets back into circulation. I'm to act  more as a liaison man--neither Knobos nor DalNalten knows you well  enough to Lens you. Right?\"    \"Yes, I've met Mr. Knobos only once, and have never even seen Dr.  DalNalten.\"    \"Ready to visit them, via Lens?\"    \"Yes. Go ahead.\"    The two Lensmen came in. They came into his mind, not hers.  Nevertheless their thoughts, superimposed upon Northrop's, came to the  girl as clearly as though all four were speaking to each other face to  face.    \"What a _weird_ sensation!\" Jill exclaimed. \"Why, I never _imagined_  anything like it!\"    \"We are sorry to trouble you, Miss Samms....\" Jill was surprised anew.  The silent voice deep within her mind was of characteristically Martian  timber, but instead of the harshly guttural consonants and the hissing  sibilants of any Martian's best efforts at English, pronunciation and  enunciation were flawless.    \"Oh, I didn't mean that. It's no trouble at all, really, I just haven't  got used to this telepathy yet.\"    \"None of us has, to any noticeable degree. But the reason for this call  is to ask you if you have anything new, however slight, to add to our  very small knowledge of Zwilnik?\"    \"Very little, I'm afraid; and that little is mostly guesses,  deductions, and jumpings at conclusions. Father told you about the way  I work, I suppose?\"    \"Yes. Exact data is not to be expected. Hints, suggestions, possible  leads, will be of inestimable value.\"    \"Well, I met a very short, very fat Venerian, named Ossmen, at a party  at the European Embassy. Do either of you know him?\"    \"I know of him,\" DalNalten replied. \"A highly reputable merchant, with  such large interests on Tellus that he has to spend most of his time  here. He is not in any one of our books ... although there is nothing  at all surprising in that fact. Go on, please, Miss Samms.\"    \"He didn't come to the party with Senator Morgan; but he came to some  kind of an agreement with him that night, and I am pretty sure that it  was about thionite. That's the only new item I have.\"    \"_Thionite!_\" The three Lensmen were equally surprised.    \"Yes. Thionite. Definitely.\"    \"How _sure_ are you of this, Miss Samms?\" Knobos asked, in deadly  earnest.    \"I am not _sure_ that this particular agreement was about thionite,  no; but the probability is roughly nine-tenths. I _am_ sure, however,  that both Senator Morgan and Ossmen know a lot about thionite that they  want to hide. Both gave very high positive reactions--well beyond the  six-sigma point of virtual certainty.\"    There was a pause, broken by the Martian, but not by a thought directed  at any one of the three.    \"Sid!\" he called, and even Jill could feel the Lensed thought speed.    \"Yes, Knobos? Fletcher.\"    \"That haul-in you made, out in the asteroids. Heroin, hadive, and  ladolian, wasn't it? No"]]]
