But the genesis of beauty is by no means declared because we know how to  point out the component parts, which in their combination produce beauty.  For to this end it would be necessary to comprehend that combination  itself, which continues to defy our exploration, as well as all mutual  operation between the finite and the infinite. The reason, on  transcendental grounds, makes the following demand: There shall be a  communion between the formal impulse and the material impulse--that is,  there shall be a play instinct--because it is only the unity of reality  with the form, of the accidental with the necessary, of the passive state  with freedom, that the conception of humanity is completed. Reason is  obliged to make this demand, because her nature impels her to  completeness and to the removal of all bounds; while every exclusive  activity of one or the other impulse leaves human nature incomplete and  places a limit in it. Accordingly, as soon as reason issues the mandate,  \"a humanity shall exist,\" it proclaims at the same time the law, \"there  shall be a beauty.\" Experience can answer us if there is a beauty, and  we shall know it as soon as she has taught us if a humanity can exist.  But neither reason nor experience can tell us how beauty can be and how a  humanity is possible.    We know that man is neither exclusively matter nor exclusively spirit.  Accordingly, beauty as the consummation of humanity, can neither be  exclusively mere life, as has been asserted by sharp-sighted observers,  who kept too close to the testimony of experience, and to which the taste  of the time would gladly degrade it; Nor can beauty be merely form, as  has been judged by speculative sophists, who departed too far from  experience, and by philosophic artists, who were led too much by the  necessity of art in explaining beauty; it is rather the common object of  both impulses, that is of the play instinct. The use of language  completely justifies this name, as it is wont to qualify with the word  play what is neither subjectively nor objectively accidental, and yet  does not impose necessity either externally or internally. As the mind  in the intuition of the beautiful finds itself in a happy medium between  law and necessity, it is, because it divides itself between both,  emancipated from the pressure of both. The formal impulse and the  material impulse are equally earnest in their demands, because one  relates in its cognition to things in their reality and the other to  their necessity; because in action the first is directed to the  preservation of life, the second to the preservation of dignity, and  therefore both to truth and perfection. But life becomes more  indifferent when dignity is mixed up with it, and duty no longer coerces  when inclination attracts. In like manner the mind takes in the reality  of things, material truth, more freely and tranquilly as soon as it  encounters formal truth, the law of necessity; nor does the mind find  itself strung by abstraction as soon as immediate intuition can accompany  it. In one word, when the mind comes into communion with ideas, all  reality loses its serious value because it becomes small; and as it comes  in contact with feeling, necessity parts also with its serious value  because it is easy.    But perhaps the objection has for some time occurred to you, Is not the  beautiful degraded by this, that it is made a mere play? and is it not  reduced to the level of frivolous objects which have for ages passed  under that name? Does it not contradict the conception of the reason and  the dignity of beauty, which is nevertheless regarded as an instrument of  culture, to confine it to the work of being a mere play? and does it not  contradict the empirical conception of play, which can coexist with the  exclusion of all taste, to confine it merely to beauty?    But what is meant by a mere play, when we know that in all conditions of  humanity that very thing is play, and only that is play which makes man  complete and develops simultaneously his twofold nature? What you style  limitation, according to your representation of the matter, according to  my views, which I have justified by proofs, I name enlargement.  Consequently I should have said exactly the reverse: man is serious only  with the agreeable, with the good, and with the perfect, but he plays  with beauty. In saying this we must not indeed think of the plays that  are in vogue in real life, and which commonly refer only to his material  state. But in real life we should also seek in vain for the beauty of  which we are here speaking. The actually present beauty is worthy of the  really, of the actually present play-impulse; but by the ideal of beauty,  which is set up by the reason, an ideal of the play-instinct is also  presented, which man ought to have before his eyes in all his plays.    Therefore, no error will ever be incurred if we seek the ideal of beauty  on the same road on which we satisfy our play-impulse. We can  immediately understand why the ideal form of a Venus, of a Juno, and of  an Apollo, is to be sought not at Rome, but in Greece, if we contrast the  Greek population, delighting in the bloodless athletic contests of  boxing, racing, and intellectual rivalry at Olympia, with the Roman  people gloating over the agony of a gladiator. Now the reason pronounces  that the beautiful must not only be life and form, but a living form,  that is, beauty, inasmuch as it dictates to man the twofold law of  absolute formality and absolute reality. Reason also utters the decision  that man shall only play with beauty, and he shall only play with beauty.    For, to speak out once for all, man only plays when in the full meaning  of the word he is a man, and he is only completely a man when he plays.  This proposition, which at this moment perhaps appears paradoxical, will  receive a great and deep meaning if we have advanced far enough to apply  it to the twofold seriousness of duty and of destiny. I promise you that  the whole edifice of aesthetic art and the still more difficult art of  life will be supported by this principle. But this proposition is only  unexpected in science; long ago it lived and worked in art and in the  feeling of the Greeks, her most accomplished masters; only they removed  to Olympus what ought to have been preserved on earth. Influenced by the  truth of this principle, they effaced from the brow of their gods the  earnestness and labor which furrow the cheeks of mortals, and also the  hollow lust that smoothes the empty face. They set free the ever serene  from the chains of every purpose, of every duty, of every care, and they  made indolence and indifference the envied condition of the godlike race;  merely human appellations for the freest and highest mind. As well the  material pressure of natural laws as the spiritual pressure of moral laws  lost itself in its higher idea of necessity, which embraced at the same  time both worlds, and out of the union of these two necessities issued  true freedom. Inspired by this spirit the Greeks also effaced from the  features of their ideal, together with desire or inclination, all traces  of volition, or, better still, they made both unrecognizable, because  they knew how to wed them both in the closest alliance. It is neither  charm, nor is it dignity, which speaks from the glorious face of Juno  Ludovici; it is neither of these, for it is both at once. While the  female god challenges our veneration, the godlike woman at the same time  kindles our love. But while in ecstacy we give ourselves up to the  heavenly beauty, the heavenly self-repose awes us back. The whole form  rests and dwells in itself--a fully complete creation in itself--and as  if she were out of space, without advance or resistance; it shows no  force contending with force, no opening through which time could break  in. Irresistibly carried away and attracted by her womanly charm, kept  off at a distance by her godly dignity, we also find ourselves at length  in the state of the greatest repose, and the result is a wonderful  impression for which the understanding has no idea and language no name.          LETTER XVI.      From the antagonism of the two impulsions, and from the association of  two opposite principles, we have seen beauty to result, of which the  highest ideal must therefore be sought in the most perfect union and  equilibrium possible of the reality and of the form. But this  equilibrium remains always an idea that reality can never completely  reach. In reality, there will always remain a preponderance of one of  these elements over the other, and the highest point to which experience  can reach will consist in an oscillation between two principles, when  sometimes reality and at others form will have the advantage. Ideal  beauty is therefore eternally one and indivisible, because there can only  be one single equilibrium; on the contrary, experimental beauty will be  eternally double, because in the oscillation the equilibrium may be  destroyed in two ways--this side and that.    I have called attention in the foregoing letters to a fact that can also  be rigorously deduced from the considerations that have engaged our  attention to the present point; this fact is that an exciting and also a  moderating action may be expected from the beautiful. The tempering  action is directed to keep within proper limits the sensuous and the  formal impulsions; the exciting, to maintain both of them in their full  force. But these two modes of action of beauty ought to be completely  identified in the idea. The beautiful ought to temper while uniformly  exciting the two natures, and it ought also to excite while uniformly  moderating them. This result flows at once from the idea of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68"],[0,"Warlord of Mars (#17)"],[1," bones of dead men lay man high upon the broad floor of the first  cave, and over all was a putrid mush of decaying flesh, through  which the apts had beaten a hideous trail toward the entrance to  the second cave beyond.    The roof of this first apartment was low, like all that we traversed  subsequently, so that the foul odors were confined and condensed  to such an extent that they seemed to possess tangible substance.  One was almost tempted to draw his short-sword and hew his way  through in search of pure air beyond.    \"Can man breathe this polluted air and live?\" asked Thuvan Dihn,  choking.    \"Not for long, I imagine,\" I replied; \"so let us make haste.  I  will go first, and you bring up the rear, with Woola between.  Come,\" and with the words I dashed forward, across the fetid mass  of putrefaction.    It was not until we had passed through seven caves of different sizes  and varying but little in the power and quality of their stenches  that we met with any physical opposition.  Then, within the eighth  cave, we came upon a lair of apts.    A full score of the mighty beasts were disposed about the chamber.  Some were sleeping, while others tore at the fresh-killed carcasses  of new-brought prey, or fought among themselves in their love-making.    Here in the dim light of their subterranean home the value of  their great eyes was apparent, for these inner caves are shrouded  in perpetual gloom that is but little less than utter darkness.    To attempt to pass through the midst of that fierce herd seemed,  even to me, the height of folly, and so I proposed to Thuvan Dihn  that he return to the outer world with Woola, that the two might  find their way to civilization and come again with a sufficient  force to overcome not only the apts, but any further obstacles that  might lie between us and our goal.    \"In the meantime,\" I continued, \"I may discover some means of  winning my way alone to the land of the yellow men, but if I am  unsuccessful one life only will have been sacrificed.  Should we  all go on and perish, there will be none to guide a succoring party  to Dejah Thoris and your daughter.\"    \"I shall not return and leave you here alone, John Carter,\" replied  Thuvan Dihn.  \"Whether you go on to victory or death, the Jeddak  of Ptarth remains at your side.  I have spoken.\"    I knew from his tone that it were useless to attempt to argue the  question, and so I compromised by sending Woola back with a hastily  penned note enclosed in a small metal case and fastened about  his neck.  I commanded the faithful creature to seek Carthoris at  Helium, and though half a world and countless dangers lay between  I knew that if the thing could be done Woola would do it.    Equipped as he was by nature with marvelous speed and endurance,  and with frightful ferocity that made him a match for any single  enemy of the way, his keen intelligence and wondrous instinct  should easily furnish all else that was needed for the successful  accomplishment of his mission.    It was with evident reluctance that the great beast turned to leave  me in compliance with my command, and ere he had gone I could not  resist the inclination to throw my arms about his great neck in a  parting hug.  He rubbed his cheek against mine in a final caress,  and a moment later was speeding through the Carrion Caves toward  the outer world.    In my note to Carthoris I had given explicit directions for locating  the Carrion Caves, impressing upon him the necessity for making  entrance to the country beyond through this avenue, and not to attempt  under any circumstances to cross the ice-barrier with a fleet.  I  told him that what lay beyond the eighth cave I could not even  guess; but I was sure that somewhere upon the other side of the  ice-barrier his mother lay in the power of Matai Shang, and that  possibly his grandfather and great-grandfather as well, if they  lived.    Further, I advised him to call upon Kulan Tith and the son of  Thuvan Dihn for warriors and ships that the expedition might be  sufficiently strong to insure success at the first blow.    \"And,\" I concluded, \"if there be time bring Tars Tarkas with you,  for if I live until you reach me I can think of few greater pleasures  than to fight once more, shoulder to shoulder, with my old friend.\"    When Woola had left us Thuvan Dihn and I, hiding in the seventh  cave, discussed and discarded many plans for crossing the eighth  chamber.  From where we stood we saw that the fighting among the  apts was growing less, and that many that had been feeding had  ceased and lain down to sleep.    Presently it became apparent that in a short time all the ferocious  monsters might be peacefully slumbering, and thus a hazardous  opportunity be presented to us to cross through their lair.    One by one the remaining brutes stretched themselves upon the  bubbling decomposition that covered the mass of bones upon the  floor of their den, until but a single apt remained awake.  This  huge fellow roamed restlessly about, nosing among his companions  and the abhorrent litter of the cave.    Occasionally he would stop to peer intently toward first one of  the exits from the chamber and then the other.  His whole demeanor  was as of one who acts as sentry.    We were at last forced to the belief that he would not sleep  while the other occupants of the lair slept, and so cast about in  our minds for some scheme whereby we might trick him.  Finally I  suggested a plan to Thuvan Dihn, and as it seemed as good as any  that we had discussed we decided to put it to the test.    To this end Thuvan Dihn placed himself close against the cave's  wall, beside the entrance to the eighth chamber, while I deliberately  showed myself to the guardian apt as he looked toward our retreat.  Then I sprang to the opposite side of the entrance, flattening my  body close to the wall.    Without a sound the great beast moved rapidly toward the seventh  cave to see what manner of intruder had thus rashly penetrated so  far within the precincts of his habitation.    As he poked his head through the narrow aperture that connects the  two caves a heavy long-sword was awaiting him upon either hand,  and before he had an opportunity to emit even a single growl his  severed head rolled at our feet.    Quickly we glanced into the eighth chamber--not an apt had moved.  Crawling over the carcass of the huge beast that blocked the doorway  Thuvan Dihn and I cautiously entered the forbidding and dangerous  den.    Like snails we wound our silent and careful way among the huge,  recumbent forms.  The only sound above our breathing was the sucking  noise of our feet as we lifted them from the ooze of decaying flesh  through which we crept.    Halfway across the chamber and one of the mighty beasts directly  before me moved restlessly at the very instant that my foot was  poised above his head, over which I must step.    Breathlessly I waited, balancing upon one foot, for I did not dare  move a muscle.  In my right hand was my keen short-sword, the point  hovering an inch above the thick fur beneath which beat the savage  heart.    Finally the apt relaxed, sighing, as with the passing of a bad dream,  and resumed the regular respiration of deep slumber.  I planted my  raised foot beyond the fierce head and an instant later had stepped  over the beast.    Thuvan Dihn followed directly after me, and another moment found  us at the further door, undetected.    The Carrion Caves consist of a series of twenty-seven connecting  chambers, and present the appearance of having been eroded by  running water in some far-gone age when a mighty river found its  way to the south through this single breach in the barrier of rock  and ice that hems the country of the pole.    Thuvan Dihn and I traversed the remaining nineteen caverns without  adventure or mishap.    We were afterward to learn that but once a month is it possible to  find all the apts of the Carrion Caves in a single chamber.    At other times they roam singly or in pairs in and out of the  caves, so that it would have been practically impossible for two  men to have passed through the entire twenty-seven chambers without  encountering an apt in nearly every one of them.  Once a month  they sleep for a full day, and it was our good fortune to stumble  by accident upon one of these occasions.    Beyond the last cave we emerged into a desolate country of snow  and ice, but found a well-marked trail leading north.  The way was  boulder-strewn, as had been that south of the barrier, so that we  could see but a short distance ahead of us at any time.    After a couple of hours we passed round a huge boulder to come to  a steep declivity leading down into a valley.    Directly before us we saw a half dozen men--fierce, black-bearded  fellows, with skins the color of a ripe lemon.    \"The yellow men of Barsoom!\" ejaculated Thuvan Dihn, as though  even now that he saw them he found it scarce possible to believe  that the very race we expected to find hidden in this remote and  inaccessible land did really exist.    We withdrew behind an adjacent boulder to watch the actions of  the little party, which stood huddled at the foot of another huge  rock, their backs toward us.    One of them was peering round the edge of the granite mass as though  watching one who approached from the opposite side.    Presently the object of his scrutiny came within the range of my  vision and I saw that it was another yellow man.  All were clothed  in magnificent furs--the six in the black and yellow striped hide  of the orluk, while he who approached alone was resplendent in the  pure white skin of an apt.    The yellow men were armed with two swords, and a short javelin  was slung across the back of each, while from their left arms hung  cuplike shields no larger than a dinner plate, the concave sides  of which turned outward toward an antagonist.    They seemed puny and futile implements of"]]]
