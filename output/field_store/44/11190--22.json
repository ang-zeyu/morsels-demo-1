The next Saturday evening, when Joe came in more black-browed than ever,  he watched him, determined to have it out with him.    When the boy went upstairs to bed, the corporal followed him. He closed  the door behind him carefully, sat on the bed and watched the younger man  undressing. And for once he spoke in a natural voice, neither chaffing  nor commanding.    'What's gone wrong, boy?'    Joe stopped a moment as if he had been shot. Then he went on unwinding  his puttees, and did not answer or look up.    'You can hear, can't you?' said Albert, nettled.    'Yes, I can hear,' said Joe, stooping over his puttees till his face was  purple.    'Then why don't you answer?'    Joe sat up. He gave a long, sideways look at the corporal. Then he lifted  his eyes and stared at a crack in the ceiling.    The corporal watched these movements shrewdly.    'And _then_ what?' he asked, ironically.    Again Joe turned and stared him in the face. The corporal smiled very  slightly, but kindly.    'There'll be murder done one of these days,' said Joe, in a quiet,  unimpassioned voice.    'So long as it's by daylight--' replied Albert. Then he went over, sat  down by Joe, put his hand on his shoulder affectionately, and continued,  'What is it, boy? What's gone wrong? You can trust me, can't you?'    Joe turned and looked curiously at the face so near to his.    'It's nothing, that's all,' he said laconically.    Albert frowned.    'Then who's going to be murdered?--and who's going to do the  murdering?--me or you--which is it, boy?' He smiled gently at the stupid  youth, looking straight at him all the while, into his eyes. Gradually  the stupid, hunted, glowering look died out of Joe's eyes. He turned his  head aside, gently, as one rousing from a spell.    'I don't want her,' he said, with fierce resentment.    'Then you needn't have her,' said Albert. 'What do you go for, boy?'    But it wasn't as simple as all that. Joe made no remark.    'She's a smart-looking girl. What's wrong with her, my boy? I should have  thought you were a lucky chap, myself.'    'I don't want 'er,' Joe barked, with ferocity and resentment.    'Then tell her so and have done,' said Albert. He waited awhile. There  was no response. 'Why don't you?' he added.    'Because I don't,' confessed Joe, sulkily.    Albert pondered--rubbed his head.    'You're too soft-hearted, that's where it is, boy. You want your mettle  dipping in cold water, to temper it. You're too soft-hearted--'    He laid his arm affectionately across the shoulders of the younger man.  Joe seemed to yield a little towards him.    'When are you going to see her again?' Albert asked. For a long time  there was no answer.    'When is it, boy?' persisted the softened voice of the corporal.    'Tomorrow,' confessed Joe.    'Then let me go,' said Albert. 'Let me go, will you?'    The morrow was Sunday, a sunny day, but a cold evening. The sky was grey,  the new foliage very green, but the air was chill and depressing. Albert  walked briskly down the white road towards Beeley. He crossed a larch  plantation, and followed a narrow by-road, where blue speedwell flowers  fell from the banks into the dust. He walked swinging his cane, with  mixed sensations. Then having gone a certain length, he turned and began  to walk in the opposite direction.    So he saw a young woman approaching him. She was wearing a wide hat of  grey straw, and a loose, swinging dress of nigger-grey velvet. She walked  with slow inevitability. Albert faltered a little as he approached her.  Then he saluted her, and his roguish, slightly withered skin flushed. She  was staring straight into his face.    He fell in by her side, saying impudently:    'Not so nice for a walk as it was, is it?'    She only stared at him. He looked back at her.    'You've seen me before, you know,' he said, grinning slightly. 'Perhaps  you never noticed me. Oh, I'm quite nice looking, in a quiet way, you  know. What--?'    But Miss Stokes did not speak: she only stared with large, icy blue eyes  at him. He became self-conscious, lifted up his chin, walked with his  nose in the air, and whistled at random. So they went down the quiet,  deserted grey lane. He was whistling the air: 'I'm Gilbert, the filbert,  the colonel of the nuts.'    At last she found her voice:    'Where's Joe?'    'He thought you'd like a change: they say variety's the salt of  life--that's why I'm mostly in pickle.'    'Where is he?'    'Am I my brother's keeper? He's gone his own ways.'    'Where?'    'Nay, how am I to know? Not so far but he'll be back for supper.'    She stopped in the middle of the lane. He stopped facing her.    'Where's Joe?' she asked.    He struck a careless attitude, looked down the road this way and that,  lifted his eyebrows, pushed his khaki cap on one side, and answered:    'He is not conducting the service tonight: he asked me if I'd officiate.'    'Why hasn't he come?'    'Didn't want to, I expect. I wanted to.'    She stared him up and down, and he felt uncomfortable in his spine, but  maintained his air of nonchalance. Then she turned slowly on her heel,  and started to walk back. The corporal went at her side.    'You're not going back, are you?' he pleaded. 'Why, me and you, we should  get on like a house on fire.'    She took no heed, but walked on. He went uncomfortably at her side,  making his funny remarks from time to time. But she was as if stone deaf.  He glanced at her, and to his dismay saw the tears running down her  cheeks. He stopped suddenly, and pushed back his cap.    'I say, you know--' he began.    But she was walking on like an automaton, and he had to hurry after her.    She never spoke to him. At the gate of her farm she walked straight in,  as if he were not there. He watched her disappear. Then he turned on his  heel, cursing silently, puzzled, lifting off his cap to scratch his head.    That night, when they were in bed, he remarked: 'Say, Joe, boy; strikes  me you're well-off without Monkey nuts. Gord love us, beans ain't in it.'    So they slept in amity. But they waited with some anxiety for the morrow.    It was a cold morning, a grey sky shifting in a cold wind, and  threatening rain. They watched the wagon come up the road and through the  yard gates. Miss Stokes was with her team as usual; her 'Whoa!' rang out  like a war-whoop.    She faced up at the truck where the two men stood.    'Joe!' she called, to the averted figure which stood up in the wind.    'What?' he turned unwillingly.    She made a queer movement, lifting her head slightly in a sipping,  half-inviting, half-commanding gesture. And Joe was crouching already to  jump off the truck to obey her, when Albert put his hand on his shoulder.    'Half a minute, boy! Where are you off? Work's work, and nuts is nuts.  You stop here.'    Joe slowly straightened himself.    'Joe!' came the woman's clear call from below.    Again Joe looked at her. But Albert's hand was on his shoulder, detaining  him. He stood half averted, with his tail between his legs.    'Take your hand off him, you!' said Miss Stokes.    'Yes, Major,' retorted Albert satirically.    She stood and watched.    'Joe!' Her voice rang for the third time.    Joe turned and looked at her, and a slow, jeering smile gathered on his  face.    'Monkey nuts!' he replied, in a tone mocking her call.    She turned white--dead white. The men thought she would fall. Albert  began yelling to the porters up the line to come and help with the load.  He could yell like any non-commissioned officer upon occasion.    Some way or other the wagon was unloaded, the girl was gone. Joe and his  corporal looked at one another and smiled slowly. But they had a weight  on their minds, they were afraid.    They were reassured, however, when they found that Miss Stokes came no  more with the hay. As far as they were concerned, she had vanished into  oblivion. And Joe felt more relieved even than he had felt when he heard  the firing cease, after the news had come that the armistice was signed.          WINTRY PEACOCK      There was thin, crisp snow on the ground, the sky was blue, the wind very  cold, the air clear. Farmers were just turning out the cows for an hour  or so in the midday, and the smell of cow-sheds was unendurable as I  entered Tible. I noticed the ash-twigs up in the sky were pale and  luminous, passing into the blue. And then I saw the peacocks. There they  were in the road before me, three of them, and tailless, brown, speckled  birds, with dark-blue necks and ragged crests. They stepped archly over  the filigree snow, and their bodies moved with slow motion, like small,  light, flat-bottomed boats. I admired them, they were curious. Then a  gust of wind caught them, heeled them over as if they were three frail  boats opening their feathers like ragged sails. They hopped and skipped  with discomfort, to get out of the draught of the wind. And then, in the  lee of the walls, they resumed their arch, wintry motion, light and  unballasted now their tails were gone, indifferent. They were indifferent  to my presence. I might have touched them. They turned off to the shelter  of an open shed.    As I passed the end of the upper house, I saw a young woman just coming  out of the back door. I had spoken to her in the summer. She recognized  me at once, and waved to me. She was carrying a pail, wearing a white  apron that was longer than her preposterously short skirt, and she had on  the cotton bonnet. I took off my hat to her and was going on. But she put  down her pail and darted with a swift, furtive movement after me.    'Do you mind waiting a minute?' she said. 'I'll be out in a minute.'    She gave me a slight, odd smile, and ran back. Her face was long and  sallow and her nose rather red. But her gloomy black eyes softened  caressively to me for a moment, with that momentary humility which makes  a man lord of the earth.    I stood in the road, looking at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8952"],[0,"Scientific American, Volume 22, No. 1, January 1, 1870 (#17)"],[1," the disaster? Whence the  combustion?    \"It has been conjectured that the bran-dust, or fine and dry powder,  passing down or up these conductors, may be the kindling cause of the  fire in these cases; but bran is not over combustible in itself, nor  do we know why it should become so when thus reduced to an impalpable  powder.    \"Another theory is that a gas arises from the transmuting grain, which,  excluded from surrounding atmosphere in these close conduits, becomes  inflammable, and hence the results, as recited above, whenever a lighted  flame is brought in contact therewith.    \"Be the cause gas or dust, the disaster is the same: and is it not a  phenomenon worth studying and remedying, so far as within the province  and control of those most interested?\"    Some similar instances came under our personal observation while  adjuster for the Aetna at its western branch. The Star Mills at  Mascoutah, Ill., burned about the year 1864. They were grinding  middlings. About three o'clock in the morning the miller in charge went  up to the chamber (a large box extending through several stories), as he  had often done before, to jar the middlings down, they having clogged.  He carried a small, open oil lamp, which he placed on a beam, just  behind and above his head. He then opened a slide and thrust in a  shovel, which started the middlings down with a thump, raising a great  dust. As this dust issued in a thin cloud from the slide, it approached  and touched the lamp, when instantly, as if it had been coal gas, it  flashed, burning the miller's hair and beard, and filling the middlings  box with a sheet of flame, which spread with great rapidity and  destroyed the mill.    A mill at Dover, Ky., had accumulated a large quantity of middlings in  an upper story, when the weight caused some sagging, and a man was sent  up with a shovel to \"even\" the bin. His pressure was the \"last straw,\"  and the floor under the man broke through, pouring out a cascade of  middlings, which flowed down from story to story, filling the mill with  its dust. In a very few minutes it reached the boiler room, and the  instant it touched the fire it ignited with a flash, and the mills was  in flames instantly. It was totally destroyed.    In this last named case the gas theory will not apply. The dust was not  confined in a spout, but was floating free in the air throughout the  mill. The phenomenon was like the others mentioned, and seems to  indicate that the fine dust itself, when floating in the air, is the  fatal incendiary.    The subject is worthy of a scientific analysis, such as we have never  seen bestowed upon it. The facts are well authenticated, but the  philosophy of such ignition is not generally understood.--_Insurance  Monitor_.           *       *       *       *       *          Fire-Proof Buildings.      \"It has long been a vexed problem with architects and builders, how to  make a building completely fire-proof without the enormous expense of  iron beams and girders, and even this has sometimes failed to prove a  complete protection. In the building of the National State Bank, the  architect estimated that it could not be made fire-proof in the ordinary  style for less than $6,000, and while hesitating as to the expense and  seeking to provide some remedy against the dampness incident to iron  beams, Mr. Fowler learned from the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN that Edwin May,  of Indianapolis, the well-known architect of our county jail, had taken  letters patent on a fire-proof lath for ceilings and inside partition  walls, together with a concrete floor for the protection of the upper  edge of the joist which by actual test had been demonstrated to be  fire-proof. After a critical examination of the invention upon its  merits, it was adopted, and the workmen are now engaged in putting  it in. Our citizens engaged in, or contemplating building, will be  interested in an examination of the work while in progress.\"    [We copy the above from the _Lafayette_ (Indiana) _Courier_, and in this  connection we make the following extract from a letter just received by  us from Mr. May, the inventor:    \"You will see by the above notice one result of my advertisement in the  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. This is only a _mite_. I have more than I can do,  and I would say to inventors who are not realizing what they expected  from their patents, that one _illustrated advertisement_ in the  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN will effect more than a notice in all the newspapers  in the United States.

That on all ship stores procurable in bond, drawback be returned,  as upon goods shipped for sale to foreign lands; and    Finally, That ample subsidies be granted to lines of steamers built  in American yards, to the end that competition with powerful foreign  organizations may be successfully inaugurated and sustained.

Messrs. Editors:--As a constant reader of your invaluable paper, many  subjects of deep interest come under my observation, and doubtless no  journal throughout the land contains more instructive reading--that  which tends to accelerate the progress of scientific investigation,  and promote the general interest of the people--than the SCIENTIFIC  AMERICAN. The series of articles under the head of \"Aerial Navigation,\"  commenced on page 309, volume XXI., has, perhaps, been read with as much  pleasure and interest as anything published in your valuable journal. I  say with pleasure--because it is really gratifying to mark the advancing  steps which inventors are making in this branch of science; and with  interest--because every new idea set forth, calculated to further the  success of aerial navigation, should be, and no doubt will be, regarded  as of great importance by every one. And, as the more suggestions placed  before the minds of those working for the improvement of any invention,  the greater number will they have from which to choose or experiment  upon, I would like to make one suggestion here, which may be of some  importance in the construction and operation of the \"Aeroport,\" under  the supervision of Mr. Porter, of your city, a description of which is  given on pages 346-7, volume XXI., of your paper.    I suggest that the propelling wheels be placed in some other position  than that given in the said description. From what little knowledge I  possess of aerial navigation, I am persuaded that it would take less  power to propel the \"Aeroport\" at a given speed, if the wheels were  placed at the rear or front portion of the flying ship. My reason for  being thus persuaded is, that as the forward and aft halves of the float  are cone-shaped--the center being the base, and the front and rear  ends being the vertexes--there must be an increased velocity of the  atmosphere from front to aft as the aeroport advances. Consequently the  driving wheels being placed under the center or largest diameter of the  float, they must evidently revolve with greater rapidity in the current  of air passing between the float and the saloon, going in opposite  direction to that in which the aeroport is flying at a given speed, than  they would were they placed in front or behind where the atmosphere is  comparatively at rest. I take this view from the fact that steamboats  and other vessels proceed with greater speed, with a given power, _down_  stream than they do _up_ stream, mostly on account of the paddles  striking against the current flowing in the same direction in which the  vessel is rowing. The propelling wheels placed either at the front or  rear may have the axle extended through the end of the float to the  center, and the cog-wheel, for the chain, placed on the inner end of  the axle, and the chain descending through the bottom of the float, and  connected to the engine in the same manner as given in your paper. The  chain should be inclosed from the float to the saloon below, with a pipe  of the same material as the float, and sufficiently large to insure the  free action of the chain, and the axle of the propellers should be made  tight with suitable packing to prevent the escape of gas. However there  may be different arrangements employed for connecting the engine to the  wheels. A shaft extending directly under the float, and reaching  from the center to the axle supporting the propellers, and connected  therewith by means of side cog-wheels, might be used; and as the shaft  would necessarily"]]]
