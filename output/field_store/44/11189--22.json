Perhaps the most fatal consequences have arisen from founding the moral  character of these divinities upon that of man. Those who first had the  confidence to tell man that in these matters it was not permitted him  to consult his reason, that the interests of society demanded its  sacrifice, evidently proposed to themselves to make him the sport of  their own wantonness--to make him the blind instrument of their own  unworthiness. It is from this radical error that has sprung all those  extravagances which the various superstitions have introduced upon  the earth: from hence has flowed that sacred fury which has frequently  deluged it with blood: here is the cause of those inhuman persecutions  which have so often desolated nations: in short, all those horrid  tragedies which have been acted on the vast theatre of the world, by  command of the different ministers of the various systems, whose gods  they have said ordained these shocking spectacles.    The theologians themselves have thus been the means, of calumniating  the gods they pretended to serve, under the pretext of exalting their  name--of covering them with glory; in this they may have been said to be  true atheists, since they seem only to have been anxious to destroy the  idols they themselves had raised, by the actions they have attributed  to them--which has debased them in the eye of reason--rendered their  existence more than doubtful to the man of humanity. Indeed, it would  require more than human credulity to accredit the assertion that these  beings ever could order the atrocities committed in their name. Every  time they have been willing to disturb the harmony of mankind--whenever  they have been desirous to render him unsociable, they have cried out  that their gods ordained that he should be so. Thus they render mortals  uncertain, make the ethical system fluctuate by founding it upon  changeable, capricious idols, whom they represent much more frequently  cruel and unjust, than filled with bounty and benevolence.    However it may be, admitting if they will for a moment that their idols  possess all the human virtues in an infinite degree of perfection, we  shall quickly be obliged to acknowledge that they cannot connect them  with those metaphysical, theological, negative attributes, of which we  have already spoken. If these beings are spirits that are immaterial,  how can they be able to act like man, who is a corporeal being? Pure  spirits, according to the only idea man can form of them, having no  organs, no parts, cannot see any thing; can neither hear our prayers,  attend to our solicitations, nor have compassion for our miseries.  They cannot be immutable, if their dispositions can suffer change: they  cannot be infinite, if the totality of nature, without being them, can  exist conjointly with them: they cannot be omnipotent, if they either  permit or do not prevent evil: they cannot be omnipresent, if they are  not every where: they must therefore be in the evil as well as in the  good. Thus in whatever manner they are contemplated, under whatever  point of view they are considered, the human qualities which are  assigned to them, necessarily destroy each other; neither can these  same properties in any possible manner combine themselves with the  supernatural attributes given to them by theology.    With respect to the revealed will of these idols, by means of  their oracles, far from being a proof of their good will, of their  commisseration for man, it would rather seem evidence of their ill-will.  It supposes them capable of leaving mankind for a considerable season  unacquainted with truths highly important to their interests; these  oracles communicated to a small number of chosen men, are indicative of  partiality, of predilections, that are but little compatible with the  common Father of the human race. These oracles were ill imagined,  since they tend to injure the immutability ascribed to these idols, by  supposing that they permitted man to be ignorant at one time of their  will, whilst at another time they were willing he should be instructed  on the subject. Moreover, these oracles frequently predicted offences  for which afterwards severe punishments were inflicted on those who did  no more than fulfil them. This, according to the reasoning of man, would  be unjust. The ambiguous language in which they were delivered, the  almost impossibility of comprehending them, the inexplicable mysteries  they contained, seemed to render them doubtful; at least they are  not consistent with the ideas man is capable of forming of infinite  perfection: but the fact clearly is, they were thus rendered capable of  application to the contingency of events--could be made to suit  almost any circumstances: this would render it not a very improbable  conjecture, that these oracles were solely delivered by the priests  themselves. It these were tried by the only test of which he has any  knowledge--HIS REASON, it would naturally occur to the mind of man, that  mystery could never, on any occasion, be used in the promulgation of  substantive decrees meant to operate on the obedience, to actuate the  moral conduct of man: it is quite usual with most legislators to  render their laws as explicit as possible, to adapt them to the meanest  understanding; in short, it would be reckoned want of good faith in a  government, to throw a thick, mysterious veil over the announcement of  that conduct which it wished its citizens to adopt; they would be apt  to think such a procedure was either meant to cover its own peculiar  ignorance, or else to entrap them into a snare; at best, it would be  considered as furnishing a never-failing source of dispute, which a wise  government would endeavour to avoid.    It will thus be obvious, that the ideas which theology has at various  times, under various systems, held forth to man, have for the most part  been confused, discordant, incompatible, and have had a general tendency  to disturb the repose of mankind. The obscure notions, the vague  speculations of these multiplied creeds, would be matter of great  indifference, if man was not taught to hold them as highly important  to his welfare--if he did not draw from them conclusions pernicious to  himself--if he did not learn from these theologians that he must sharpen  his asperity against those who do not contemplate them in the same point  of view with himself: as he perhaps, then, will never have a common  standard, a fixed rule, a regular graduated scale, whereby to form  his judgment on these points--as all efforts of the imagination must  necessarily assume divers shapes, undergo a variety of modifications,  which can never be assimilated to each other, it was little likely that  mankind would at all times be able to understand each other on this  subject; much less that they would be in accord in the opinions they  should adopt. From hence that diversity of superstitions which in  all ages have given rise to the most irrational disputes; which  have engendered the most sanguinary wars; which have caused the most  barbarous massacres; which have divided man from his fellow by the most  rancorous animosities, that will perhaps never be healed; because he has  been impelled to consider the peculiar tenets he adopted, not only as  immediately essential to his individual welfare, but also as intimately  connected with the happiness, closely interwoven with the tranquillity  of the nation of which he was a citizen. That such contrariety of  sentiment, such discrepancy of opinion should exist, is not in the least  surprising; it is, in fact, the natural result of those physical causes  to which, as long as he exists, he is at all times submitted. The man  of a heated imagination cannot accommodate himself to the god of a  phlegmatic, tranquil being: the infirm, bilious, discontented, angry  mortal, cannot view him under the same aspect as he who enjoys a sounder  constitution,--as the individual of a gay turn, who enjoys the  blessing of content, who wishes to live in peace. An equitable, kind,  compassionate, tender-hearted man, will not delineate to himself  the same portrait of his god, as the man who is of an harsh, unjust,  inflexible, wicked character. Each individual will modify his god after  his own peculiar manner of existing, after his own mode of thinking,  according to his particular mode of feeling. A wise, honest, rational  man will always figure to himself his god as humane and just.    Nevertheless, as fear usually presided at the formation of those idols  man set up for the object of his worship; as the ideas of these beings  were generally associated with that of terror as the recollections  of sufferings, which he attributed to them, often made him tremble;  frequently awakened in his mind the most afflicting, reminiscence; as  it sometimes filled him with inquietude, sometimes inflamed his  imagination, sometimes overwhelmed him with dismay, the experience of  all ages proves, that these vague idols became the most important of all  considerations--was the affair which most seriously occupied the human  race: that they every where spread consternation--produced the most  frightful ravages, by the delirious inebriation resulting from the  opinions with which they intoxicated the mind. Indeed, it is extremely  difficult to prevent habitual fear, which of all human passions is the  most incommodious, from becoming a dangerous leaven; which in the long  run will sour, exasperate, and give malignancy to the most moderate  temperament.    If a misanthrope, in hatred of his race, had formed the project  of throwing man into the greatest perplexity,--if a tyrant, in the  plenitude of his unruly desire to punish, had sought out the most  efficacious means; could either the one or the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8911"],[0,"Explorations in Australia (#17)"],[1,"from it the feed is not very good, in consequence of its being  subject to inundation, but beyond that the feed is beautiful. At three  miles and a half made the white patches, and found them to be springs  covering a large extent of country, but not so active as those already  described. Leaving the springs at two miles, crossed the Neale at a place  where it becomes narrower and the channel much deeper, with long sheets  of salt and brackish water. I shall now leave the creek. In the time of a  flood an immense body of water must come down it. At the widest part,  where it spreads itself out in the plain, the drift stuff is from  fourteen to fifteen feet up in the trees. Camped at 4 p.m.    Friday, 17th June, The Neale. Discovered another large quantity of water  supplied by springs. This country is a wonderful place for them. There is  an immense quantity of water running now.    Saturday, 18th June, The Neale. Started early in the morning to examine  the country. Found large quantities of quartz, samples of which I brought  with me. Still well watered, but without any timber.    Sunday, 19th June, The Neale. Water in abundance, with large quantities  of quartz. The course the quartz seems to take is from the south-west to  the north-east. The plain we examined to-day is a large basin, surrounded  by the hills from Mount Younghusband and Mount Kingston, with the creek  running through the centre. To-morrow I shall have a look along the  north-east side of Mount Kingston, for I see the quartz apparently goes  through the range and breaks out again on the north-east side, which is  very white.    Monday, 20th June, Mount Kingston. Started at 8 o'clock a.m. to examine  the quartz on the east side of Mount Kingston. Crossed the creek, and at  three miles struck a quartz reef. The Freeling Springs still continue,  but seem inclined to run more to the eastward. Changed my course to a  peak in a low range which has a white appearance. At eight miles reached  the peak; the quartz ceases altogether, and the country is stony from  here. I can see the line of the Neale running eastward; it spreads out  over the plain. It was my intention to follow it until it reached the  lake, but I find the ground too stony for me to do so. Being reduced to  my last set of shoes, and some of them pretty well worn out, I am obliged  to retreat. Changed my course at seven miles across the bed of the creek,  three miles broad, with a number of brackish water holes in it, some very  salt. At this point the trees cease. I can see nothing of the lake.  Camped on a gum creek without water. The latter part of our course was  over a very barren and rotten plain, surrounded by cliffs of gypsum,  quite destitute of vegetation. It has evidently been the bed of a small  lake at some time. There is no salt about it.    Tuesday, 21st June, Dry Gum Creek. At 7.40 started on the same course as  last night, and after various changes of bearings arrived at the hill,  whither I had sent Muller, and where he found two springs. Instead of  two, they are numerous all round the hill; some are without water on the  surface, and others have plenty. It is a perfect bed of springs. A little  more east they are stronger, surrounded with green reeds and rushes.    Wednesday, 22nd June, Mount Younghusband. Started at 8.40. At three miles  and a half came to a large bed of springs with reeds and rushes, water  running and good, with numerous other small springs all round. They are a  continuation of those we camped at last night, with an abundant supply of  excellent water. At four miles crossed the salt creek coming from Hawker  Springs. At eight miles crossed three salt and soda lagoons, surrounded  by lime and gypsum mounds, in which are numerous springs up to the foot  of the hills (ten miles and a half) and all round them. I have named  these hills Parry Hills, after Samuel Parry, Esquire. It was my intention  to have gone to the east from this, but the horses' shoes will not admit  of it. To the south-east I observed three conical hills, for which I will  now steer. At seven miles crossed a gum creek, in which are large water  holes, where water had been lately, but there is now only mud. There must  be water either up or down the creek, for there are numerous native  tracks leading both ways. At ten miles crossed a large gum (stunted)  creek with abundant springs of rather brackish water. At nineteen miles  and a half camped on a broad creek, but no water. The country good.    Thursday, 23rd June, Dry Creek. Started at 8.30 on the same course for  one of the conical hills. At three miles ascended it, and found it to be  flat-topped. I can see nothing of any lake to the east. The view is  interrupted by a flat-topped range. From this I changed my course, and at  three miles and a half observed a peculiar-looking spot to the  south-west, which had the appearance of springs. Changed my course for  it, and at six miles came upon a hill of springs surrounded by a number  of smaller ones, with an ample supply of first-rate water. The hill is  covered with reeds and rushes; it is situated at the west side of a large  plain, and is bounded by stony table land on the east side, which has an  abrupt descent of about thirty feet into the plain. On the west side are  a number of broken hills, and a small range composed of gypsum and lime,  having the surface covered with fragments of quartz and ironstone, and a  number of other pebbles. On the hill where the springs are we have found  lava. There are numerous small creeks coming from the hill, and running  in every direction. They seem to be all in confusion. The plain is about  five miles wide. These I have named the Louden Springs.    Friday, 24th June, Louden Springs. I must remain here to-day, and put the  last of the shoes upon some of the horses which are getting rather lame.  I have been making them go without as long as I can.    Saturday, 25th June, Louden Springs. Started at 7.50. At 8.45 (three  miles) crossed a gum creek, and at 12 o'clock (eleven miles) crossed the  Douglas, but no water. The channel still broad and sandy.    Sunday, 26th June, The Douglas. Started at 8.25, on a bearing of 217  degrees. Crossed the lagoon, which was rather boggy in some places. It is  now more than two miles broad, with a white crust on the top, composed of  soda and salt, but mostly salt. It must be supplied by springs. At three  miles crossed a salt creek, with salt water. It empties itself into the  lagoon, and is the same that passes by the Strangway Springs. I can see  nothing of any springs at this part of the creek. Steered upon the same  course to intersect my outward tracks. Saw some natives walking along a  valley. They did not observe us. I hailed them, and an old man came up to  us. He was rather frightened, and trembled a good deal. He seemed to  wonder and be pleased at my smoking a pipe of tobacco. I gave one to him  and a piece of tobacco, but he did not know how to manage the cutting,  filling, and lighting operations. I did these for him. In the first  attempt he put the wrong end into his mouth, which he found rather hot,  and quickly took it out. I then showed him the right end. He managed a  whiff or two, but he did not fancy it. He seemed very much pleased with  the pipe, which he kept. I then made him understand that I wanted water.  He pointed the same course that I was steering. In a short time another  made his appearance in the distance. By a little persuasion from the old  fellow, he was induced to come up, and in a short time became very  talkative, and very anxious to show us the water. In a few minutes a  third made his appearance, and came up. He was the youngest--a stout,  able-bodied fellow, about twenty-four years old. The others were much  older, but were very powerful men, and all three in excellent condition.  The women did not come up, but remained in the flat. I expected they were  going to take us to some springs, and was disappointed when they showed  us some rain water in a deep hole. They were quite surprised to see our  horses drink it all. They would go no further with us, nor show us any  more, and, in a short time after, left us. We struck our outward tracks,  and steered for the Elizabeth Springs, where we arrived after dark.    Monday, 27th June, Elizabeth Springs. Gave the horses a half-day, and  made the Mount Hamilton Springs in the afternoon.    Tuesday, 28th June, Hamilton Springs. Started for Chambers Creek to my  first encampment. Arrived there in the afternoon. Distance, eighteen  miles.    Wednesday, 29th June, Chambers Creek. Resting the horses and preparing  for a trip down on the west side of Mount North-west, to see if I can  find a road and water that way.    Friday, 1st July, Chambers Creek. Started at 8 a.m. on a bearing of 120  degrees. At twenty-four miles camped on a water hole in Gregory Creek,  where it comes out of the hills. There are three remarkable peaks north  of the water, one in particular having a white face to the east, with a  course of black stones on the summit, distant about one mile. The first  five miles was over a well-grassed country, with stones on the surface,  slightly undulating, with a number of good valleys, very broad, emptying  themselves into Gregory Creek. At twenty-two miles crossed the main  channel of the creek. It is divided into a number of courses, with some  very deep holes in them. When they are filled, they must retain water for  a great length of time. There are a great many native encampments all  about the creek. The gums are dwarf.    Saturday, 2nd July, Gregory Creek. Started at 10.8. Course, 120 degrees.  At three miles, opposite a long permanent water hole, with rushes growing  round it. At seven miles, crossed the upper part of the Gregory; eight  miles and a half, top of dividing range; thirteen miles, crossed a creek  with rain water; fourteen miles, crossed another deep channel.
