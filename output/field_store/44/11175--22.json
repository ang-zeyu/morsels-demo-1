Matinees are usually held in the open air, in some good ground, in  which a brass band should be playing, and plenty of good flowers  displayed, embellished by the best dressed people it is possible  to assemble together. There are not any introductions; people  amuse themselves as best they can. Luncheon may be spread in-  doors, or upon tables under the trees, or if tents are erected,  inside of these. Fruits, ices, salads, cold meats, confectionery-  in short, any cold collation, with wine, tea, and coffee, should  be served. Full morning dress is most appropriate.    Croquet parties are very fashionable, and meet generally at about  three P.M. The host should be careful to have his grounds well  shaded, his mallets, balls, and other arrangements in perfect  order. Seats for such guests as are not playing should be  scattered about in shady places. Refreshments may be handed round  between the games, or arranged as for matinees.    Within the past few years, a species of entertainment of a past  generation has been revived in England, and some attempts have  been made to introduce it in this country. It was, and is, called  the \"Kettledrum.\" Tea and coffee, with biscuit and cake, are  served round from five to half-past five. Any one in the visiting  circle of the house may go without an invitation; the dress is  full morning dress, and the guests dance until seven o'clock. From  them guests often go to dinner parties, and thence to balls, so  that a man may be considered to be in harness to society from five  P.M. to 4 A.M., and to be rather hardly driven, too.    Ceremony is laid aside upon these occasions, and people act with  greater freedom than at more formal gatherings.    In country parties, ceremony is often required, even upon  occasions where more freedom of action would be desirable.  Inattention to this matter may give offence, as the hostess may  fancy herself slighted merely because she is not city-bred.    Avoid in country parties treading upon delicate ground, talking of  local squabbles, church matters, or the acknowledged feud of the  village.    Be punctual to the time stated for any kind of a country party, as  one late arrival may delay the carriages, boats, or other  conveyances of an entire party. Many of these expeditions start at  a very early hour, to avoid the road during the heat of the day,  and if you accept the invitation, you must relinquish your morning  nap and appear at the appointed time. Seek out the hostess upon  your arrival, and if you can in any way assist her, either by  running for tardy servants, packing luncheon hampers, arranging  the order of vehicles, or any other _last_ duties, do so with  alacrity.    Private fetes in the country correspond to matinees in town, and  the same rules apply.    At pic-nics, whether water or land parties, etiquette is set at  naught; yet the true gentleman and lady will never leave true  courtesy and politeness at home, even if they lay aside forms and  ceremonies. Everybody is to enjoy the time and freedom as much as  possible, \"within the limits of becoming mirth;\" yet an act of  rudeness, a disregard of the gentle and delicate attentions of  society, will never increase the pleasure.    Gentlemen at pic-nics must consent to become waiters, guides,  servants to the ladies; must \"scale mountains,\" climb trees,  perform any feats desired by the fair tyrants, if they fancy \"that  lovely flower,\" or \"exquisite bunch of sea-weed,\" in impossible-  to-get-at places. If on a fishing party, it is the gentlemen's  place to bait the hooks for the fair anglers, to assist them in  landing their prey, to find them shady nooks for seats, and in  every way to assist them. If nutting or berrying are the objects  of the party, the gentlemen must climb the nut-trees, seek out the  berry-bushes, carry double allowances of baskets and kettles, and  be ready for any assistance required in climbing fences or  scrambling over rocks. By the way, the etiquette for climbing a  fence is for the gentleman to go over as gracefully as possible,  turn his back upon the lady, and not look round until she claims  his hand to spring from the topmost bar. She will not thank him if  he insists upon shoving her over first, or watches her while she  climbs up.    Boisterous deportment is not in good taste. Even the most romping  games may be conducted as becomes ladies and gentlemen, not as  clowns. Couples should avoid straying too long or too far from  their companions.    Even if the luncheon or dinner is spread on the grass, or eaten  out of a basket, gentlemen will see to the comfort of the ladies  before eating themselves, and, need I say, the freedom from the  restraints of the table affords no excuse for gluttony or rudeness  of any description.    On returning from a pic-nic, the thanks of the party are due to  the originators of it, and should be paid by each one before the  company disperses.    Singing a comic song is a dangerous experiment, as you may be  personal without intending it. An English lady of rank, speaking  of an evening party, says: \"At an evening party, given expressly  in honor of a distinguished lady of color, we heard a thoughtless  amateur dash into the broadly comic, but terribly inappropriate'  nigger' song of' 'Sally, Come Up.' Before he had got through the  first verse, he had perceived his mistake, and was so overwhelmed  with shame that he could scarcely preserve sufficient presence of  mind to carry him through to the end.\"    A modern writer of talent says: \"Your pleasure at any party will  depend far more upon what you take with you into the room than  upon what you find there. Ambition, vanity, pride, will all go  with anxiety, and you will probably carry them all home again,  with the additional burden of disappointment. Even if they are all  gratified, you will know that others are disliking you, even if  envious of you. To go with a sincere desire to please others by  amiability, good-nature and sympathy will probably result in your  own popularity, and if you entirely forget yourself, you will be  astonished to find how much others insist upon remembering you.\"    If at any morning or evening party you meet a distinguished guest,  it is ill-bred to follow him from one place to another, listening  to every word he utters, and making him have the uncomfortable  sensation of being \"stared at.\"    Impromptu charades are a very popular amusement at the present  day, at both in-door and out-door parties. If you have no talent  for them, you will only confuse others and make yourself appear  absurd by insisting upon taking a part; but even if you are dull,  do not refuse your assistance if it is really required, trying, by  tact and modesty, to cover up any deficiency in wit or talent.    The best rule for the management of parties, be they in-door or  out-door, morning or evening, city or country, is to endeavor to  find out the wishes of the majority of the guests and act upon  that knowledge. To force a large party of people to listen to  awkward, bungling charades, because two or three amateur actors  desire to \"show off,\" proves a want of tact in the hostess; to  allow a few young people to guide the entertainments in a large  assembly of older and graver ones, is in equally bad taste; it is,  of course, better to assemble together as far as possible only  those who are likely to be congenial and interested in the same  subjects; but this is not always possible, and where the company  is mixed, the republican spirit should preside, and the \"majority  rule.\"    One word of warning to all who give parties. You can never tell  what ruin may be commencing when you urge wines or intoxicating  beverages upon your young guests. You may be the first to  stimulate the appetite; you may renew a passion that has been  subdued; you may turn a wavering will from the hardly gained  resolution to abstain. There are instances, not a few, but many,  where the love of liquor, conquered and subdued, has been revived  in fiercest heat by cordials, brandied peaches, wine-sauces, and  similar apparently innocent refreshments. It is better to appear  mean than to tempt to ruin, and in these days of temperance  movements, no lady will be censured or misunderstood who banishes  every drop of intoxicating liquor from her table.      VISITING.    NEVER pay any visit upon a general invitation. The Spanish  hidalgo, who declares to you that his house, lands, all that he  has, are yours, would be greatly surprised if you appropriated any  of his things. It is the same thing, more or less, with people  elsewhere who give people general invitations to take up their  quarters in their houses.    There are instances of visits of a month's duration being made  upon the invitation, \"If you visit B---, I hope that you will not  forget that I reside there, and will be very happy to see you.\"  Yet, even where friends are not newly made, but of long standing,  it is best not to pay visits unless by special invitation. A  thousand events may occur to render it inconvenient for one friend  to have company that cannot be known to another, hundreds of  miles, perhaps, away. If a friend really desires to extend  hospitality to another, she will send her an invitation, which can  be accepted with the prospect of mutual convenience and pleasure.    Even in travelling, if you are unexpectedly detained in a city  where you have friends, do not drive to their house uninvited. Go  first to a hotel, and let them know of your arrival, leaving it  optional with them to extend hospitality. To drive at once to the  house, with your baggage, forces an invitation, which may cause  much annoyance and inconvenience, even if they are really glad to  see you, and it also renders you liable to be accused of meanness  and a desire to save your hotel bill. If you are afraid your  friends will feel hurt if you do not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],[0,"The King in Yellow (#17)"],[1," to the library and began a systematic search. She had  hidden herself so well that it was half-an-hour later when I discovered  her crouching white and silent by the latticed window in the store-room  above. At the first glance I saw she had been punished for her  foolishness. _The King in Yellow_ lay at her feet, but the book was  open at the second part. I looked at Tessie and saw it was too late. She  had opened _The King in Yellow_. Then I took her by the hand and led  her into the studio. She seemed dazed, and when I told her to lie down on  the sofa she obeyed me without a word. After a while she closed her eyes  and her breathing became regular and deep, but I could not determine  whether or not she slept. For a long while I sat silently beside her, but  she neither stirred nor spoke, and at last I rose, and, entering the  unused store-room, took the book in my least injured hand. It seemed  heavy as lead, but I carried it into the studio again, and sitting down  on the rug beside the sofa, opened it and read it through from beginning  to end.    When, faint with excess of my emotions, I dropped the volume and leaned  wearily back against the sofa, Tessie opened her eyes and looked at  me....    We had been speaking for some time in a dull monotonous strain before I  realized that we were discussing _The King in Yellow_. Oh the sin of  writing such words,--words which are clear as crystal, limpid and musical  as bubbling springs, words which sparkle and glow like the poisoned  diamonds of the Medicis! Oh the wickedness, the hopeless damnation of a  soul who could fascinate and paralyze human creatures with such  words,--words understood by the ignorant and wise alike, words which are  more precious than jewels, more soothing than music, more awful than  death!    We talked on, unmindful of the gathering shadows, and she was begging me  to throw away the clasp of black onyx quaintly inlaid with what we now  knew to be the Yellow Sign. I never shall know why I refused, though even  at this hour, here in my bedroom as I write this confession, I should be  glad to know _what_ it was that prevented me from tearing the Yellow  Sign from my breast and casting it into the fire. I am sure I wished to  do so, and yet Tessie pleaded with me in vain. Night fell and the hours  dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the  Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the  fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the  fog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and  break on the shores of Hali.    The house was very silent now, and not a sound came up from the misty  streets. Tessie lay among the cushions, her face a grey blot in the  gloom, but her hands were clasped in mine, and I knew that she knew and  read my thoughts as I read hers, for we had understood the mystery of the  Hyades and the Phantom of Truth was laid. Then as we answered each other,  swiftly, silently, thought on thought, the shadows stirred in the gloom  about us, and far in the distant streets we heard a sound. Nearer and  nearer it came, the dull crunching of wheels, nearer and yet nearer, and  now, outside before the door it ceased, and I dragged myself to the  window and saw a black-plumed hearse. The gate below opened and shut, and  I crept shaking to my door and bolted it, but I knew no bolts, no locks,  could keep that creature out who was coming for the Yellow Sign. And now  I heard him moving very softly along the hall. Now he was at the door,  and the bolts rotted at his touch. Now he had entered. With eyes starting  from my head I peered into the darkness, but when he came into the room I  did not see him. It was only when I felt him envelope me in his cold soft  grasp that I cried out and struggled with deadly fury, but my hands were  useless and he tore the onyx clasp from my coat and struck me full in the  face. Then, as I fell, I heard Tessie's soft cry and her spirit fled: and  even while falling I longed to follow her, for I knew that the King in  Yellow had opened his tattered mantle and there was only God to cry to  now.    I could tell more, but I cannot see what help it will be to the world. As  for me, I am past human help or hope. As I lie here, writing, careless  even whether or not I die before I finish, I can see the doctor gathering  up his powders and phials with a vague gesture to the good priest beside  me, which I understand.    They will be very curious to know the tragedy--they of the outside world  who write books and print millions of newspapers, but I shall write no  more, and the father confessor will seal my last words with the seal of  sanctity when his holy office is done. They of the outside world may send  their creatures into wrecked homes and death-smitten firesides, and their  newspapers will batten on blood and tears, but with me their spies must  halt before the confessional. They know that Tessie is dead and that I am  dying. They know how the people in the house, aroused by an infernal  scream, rushed into my room and found one living and two dead, but they  do not know what I shall tell them now; they do not know that the doctor  said as he pointed to a horrible decomposed heap on the floor--the livid  corpse of the watchman from the church: \"I have no theory, no explanation.  That man must have been dead for months!\"      I think I am dying. I wish the priest would--          THE DEMOISELLE D'YS      \"Mais je croy que je    Suis descendu on puiz    Tenebreux onquel disoit    Heraclytus estre Verete cachee.\"    \"There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I  know not:    \"The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the  way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.\"      I    The utter desolation of the scene began to have its effect; I sat down to  face the situation and, if possible, recall to mind some landmark which  might aid me in extricating myself from my present position. If I could  only find the ocean again all would be clear, for I knew one could see  the island of Groix from the cliffs.    I laid down my gun, and kneeling behind a rock lighted a pipe. Then I  looked at my watch. It was nearly four o'clock. I might have wandered far  from Kerselec since daybreak.    Standing the day before on the cliffs below Kerselec with Goulven,  looking out over the sombre moors among which I had now lost my way,  these downs had appeared to me level as a meadow, stretching to the  horizon, and although I knew how deceptive is distance, I could not  realize that what from Kerselec seemed to be mere grassy hollows were  great valleys covered with gorse and heather, and what looked like  scattered boulders were in reality enormous cliffs of granite.    \"It's a bad place for a stranger,\" old Goulven had said: \"you'd better  take a guide;\" and I had replied, \"I shall not lose myself.\" Now I knew  that I had lost myself, as I sat there smoking, with the sea-wind blowing  in my face. On every side stretched the moorland, covered with flowering  gorse and heath and granite boulders. There was not a tree in sight, much  less a house. After a while, I picked up the gun, and turning my back on  the sun tramped on again.    There was little use in following any of the brawling streams which every  now and then crossed my path, for, instead of flowing into the sea, they  ran inland to reedy pools in the hollows of the moors. I had followed  several, but they all led me to swamps or silent little ponds from which  the snipe rose peeping and wheeled away in an ecstasy of fright I began  to feel fatigued, and the gun galled my shoulder in spite of the double  pads. The sun sank lower and lower, shining level across yellow gorse and  the moorland pools.    As I walked my own gigantic shadow led me on, seeming to lengthen at  every step. The gorse scraped against my leggings, crackled beneath my  feet, showering the brown earth with blossoms, and the brake bowed and  billowed along my path. From tufts of heath rabbits scurried away through  the bracken, and among the swamp grass I heard the wild duck's drowsy  quack. Once a fox stole across my path, and again, as I stooped to drink  at a hurrying rill, a heron flapped heavily from the reeds beside me. I  turned to look at the sun. It seemed to touch the edges of the plain.  When at last I decided that it was useless to go on, and that I must make  up my mind to spend at least one night on the moors, I threw myself down  thoroughly fagged out. The evening sunlight slanted warm across my body,  but the sea-winds began to rise, and I felt a chill strike through me  from my wet shooting-boots. High overhead gulls were wheeling and tossing  like bits of white paper; from some distant marsh a solitary curlew  called. Little by little the sun sank into the plain, and the zenith  flushed with the after-glow. I watched the sky change from palest gold to  pink and then to smouldering fire. Clouds of midges danced above me, and  high in the calm air a bat dipped and soared. My eyelids began to droop.  Then as I shook off the drowsiness a sudden crash among the bracken  roused me. I raised my eyes. A great bird hung quivering in the air above  my face. For an instant I stared, incapable of motion; then something  leaped past me in the ferns and the bird rose, wheeled, and pitched  headlong into the brake.    I was on my feet in an instant peering through the gorse. There came the  sound of a struggle from a bunch of heather close by, and then all was  quiet. I stepped forward, my gun poised, but when I came to the heather  the gun fell under my arm again, and I stood motionless in silent  astonishment A dead hare lay on the ground, and on the hare stood a  magnificent falcon, one talon buried in the creature's neck, the other  planted firmly on its limp flank. But what astonished me, was not the  mere sight of a"]]]
