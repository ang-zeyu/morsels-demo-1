Experience, however,  quickly showed that this project, admirable in idea, was impossible of  execution. Distance, differences of language, and difficulties of  communication, presented obstacles which could not be overcome. But the  plan was kept in view as one of the cardinal principles of their policy.  They were always eager to receive new members into their League. The  Tuscaroras, the Nanticokes, the Tuteloes, and a band of the Delawares,  were thus successively admitted, and all of them still retain  representative in the Council of the Canadian branch of the confederacy.    2. When this complete political union could not be achieved, the  Iroquois sought to accomplish the same end, as far as possible, by a  treaty of alliance. Two notable examples will show how earnestly this  purpose was pursued, and how firmly it was maintained. When the Dutch  established their trading settlements on the Hudson River, one of their  first proceedings was to send an embassy to the Five Nations, with  proposals for a treaty. The overture was promptly accepted. A strict  alliance was formed, and was ratified in the usual manner by an exchange  of wampum belts. When the English took the place of the Dutch, the  treaty was renewed with them, and was confirmed in the same manner. The  wampum-belts then received by the Confederates are still preserved on  their Canadian Reservation, and are still brought forth and expounded by  the older chiefs to the younger generation, in their great Councils.  History records with what unbroken faith, through many changes, and  despite many provocations from their allies and many enticements from  the French rulers and missionaries, this alliance was maintained to the  last.    If it be suggested that this fidelity was strengthened by motives of  policy, the same cannot be affirmed of the alliance with the Ojibways,  which dates from a still earlier period. The annalists of the  Kanonsionni affirm that their first treaty with this widespread people  of the northwest was made soon after the formation of their League, and  that it was strictly maintained on both sides for more than two hundred  years. The Ojibways then occupied both shores of Lake Superior, and the  northern part of the peninsula of Michigan. The point at which they came  chiefly in contact with the adventurous Iroquois voyagers was at the  great fishing station of St. Mary's Falls, on the strait which unites  Lake Superior with Lake Huron; and here, it is believed, the first  alliance was consummated. After more than two centuries had elapsed, the  broken bands of the defeated Hurons, fleeing from their ravaged homes on  the Georgian Bay, took refuge among the Ojibways, with whom they, too,  had always maintained a friendly understanding. Their presence and the  story of their sufferings naturally awakened the sympathy of their  hosts. The rapid spread of the Iroquois empire created alarm. A great  agitation ensued among the far-dispersed bands of the Ojibway name.  Occasional meetings between hunting-parties of the younger warriors of  the two peoples,--the Iroquois arrogant in the consciousness of their  recent conquests, the Ojibways sullen and suspicious,--led to bitter  words, and sometimes to actual strife. On two occasions several Ojibway  warriors were slain, under what provocation is uncertain. But the  reparation demanded by the Ojibway chiefs was promptly conceded by the  Iroquois Council. The amplest apology was made, and for every slain  warrior a pack of furs was delivered. The ancient treaty was at the same  time renewed, with every formality. Nothing could more clearly show the  anxiety of the Iroquois rulers to maintain their national faith than  this apology and reparation, so readily made by them, at the time when  their people were at the height of their power and in the full flush of  conquest. [Footnote: The Ojibway historian, Copway, in his \"_Traditional  History of the Ojibway Nation_\" (p. 84), gives the particulars of this  event, as preserved by the Ojibways themselves. Even the strong national  prejudice of the narrator, which has evidently colored his statement,  leaves the evidence of the magnanimity and prudence of the Iroquois  elders clearly apparent.] These efforts, however, to preserve the  ancient amity proved unavailing. Through whose fault it was that the  final outbreak occurred is a question which the annalists of the two  parties differ. But the events just recounted, and, indeed, all the  circumstances, speak strongly in favor of the Iroquois. They had shown  their anxiety to maintain the peace, and they had nothing to gain by  war. The bleak northern home of the Ojibways offered no temptation to  the most greedy conqueror. To the Ojibways, on the other hand, the broad  expanse of western Canada, now lying deserted, and stretching before  them its wealth of forests full of deer, its lakes and rivers swarming  with fish, its lovely glades and fertile plains, where the corn harvests  of the Hurons and Neutrals had lately glistened, were an allurement  which they could not resist. They assumed at once the wrongs and the  territories of their exiled Huron friends, and plunged into the  long-meditated strife with their ancient allies. The contest was  desperate and destructive. Many sanguinary battles took place, and great  numbers of warriors fell on both sides. On the whole the balance  inclined against the Iroquois. In this war they were a southern people,  contending against a hardier race from the far north. They fought at a  distance from their homes, while the Ojibways, migrating in bands,  pitched their habitations in the disputed region.    Finally, both sides became weary of the strife. Old sentiments of  fellowship revived. Peace was declared, and a new treaty was made. The  territory for which they had fought was divided between them. The  southwestern portion, which had been the home of the Attiwandaronks,  remained as the hunting-ground of the Iroquois. North and east of this  section the Ojibways possessed the land. The new treaty, confirmed by  the exchange of wampum-belts and by a peculiar interlocking of the right  arms, which has ever since been the special sign of amity between the  Iroquois and the Ojibways, was understood to make them not merely allies  but brothers. As the symbol on one of the belts which is still preserved  indicates, they were to be as relatives who are so nearly akin that they  eat from the same dish. This treaty, made two centuries ago, has ever  since been religiously maintained. Its effects are felt to this day.  Less than forty years ago a band of the Ojibways, the Missisagas, forced  to relinquish their reserved lands on the River Credit, sought a refuge  with the Iroquois of the Grand River Reservation. They appealed to this  treaty, and to the evidence of the wampum-belts. Their appeal was  effectual. A large tract of valuable land was granted to them by the Six  Nations. Here, maintaining their distinct tribal organization, they  still reside, a living evidence of the constancy and liberality with  which the Iroquois uphold their treaty obligations.    3. When a neighboring people would neither join the confederacy nor  enter into a treaty of alliance with it, the almost inevitable result  would be, sooner or later, a deadly war. Among the nomadic or unsettled  Indian tribes, especially the Algonkins and Sioux, the young men are  expected to display their bravery by taking scalps; and a race of  farmers, hunters, and fishermen, like the Iroquois, would be tempting  victims. Before the confederacy was formed, some of its members,  particularly the Caniengas and Oneidas, had suffered greatly from wars  with the wilder tribes about them. The new strength derived from the  League enabled them to turn the tables upon their adversaries. But they  made a magnanimous use of their superiority. An enemy who submitted was  at once spared. When the great Delaware nation, the Lenapes, known as  the head of the Algonkin stock, yielded to the arms of the Kanonsionni,  they were allowed to retain their territory and nearly all their  property. They were simply required to acknowledge themselves the  subjects of the Iroquois, to pay a moderate tribute in wampum and furs,  and to refrain thenceforth from taking any part in war. In the  expressive Indian phrase, they were \"made women.\" This phrase did not  even imply, according to Iroquois ideas, any serious humiliation; for  among them, as the French missionaries tell us, women had much  authority. [Footnote: \"Les femmes ayant beaucoup d'autorite parmi ces  peuples, leur vertu y fait d'autant plus de fruit qu'autre  part.\"--_Relation of_ 1657, p. 48.] Their special office in war was that  of peace-makers. It was deemed to be their right and duty, when in their  opinion the strife had lasted long enough, to interfere and bring about  a reconciliation. The knowledge of this fact led the Lenapes, in  aftertimes, to put forward a whimsical claim to dignity, which was  accepted by their worthy but credulous historian, Heckewelder. They  asserted that while their nation was at the height of power, their  ancestors were persuaded by the insidious wiles of the Iroquois to lay  aside their arms, for the purpose of assuming the lofty position of  universal mediators and arbiters among the Indian nations. [Footnote:  Heckewelder's _History of the Indian Nations_, p. 56.] That this  preposterous story should have found credence is surprising enough. A  single fact suffices to disprove it, and to show the terms on which the  Delawares stood with the great northern confederacy. Golden has  preserved for us the official record of the Council which was held in  Philadelphia, in July, 1742, between the provincial authorities and the  deputies of the Six Nations, headed by their noted orator and statesman,  the great Onondaga chief,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8599"],[0,"Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights (#17)"],[1,"this favourable opportunity.'    As the fairy Pari Banou pronounced these words Prince Ahmed began  to consider that the Princess Nouronnihar could never be his, and  that the fairy Pari Banou excelled her infinitely in beauty and  agreeableness, and, so far as he could judge from the magnificence  of the palace where she resided, in immense riches. 'Madam,'  replied he, 'should I, all my life, have had the happiness of being  your slave, I should think myself the happiest of men. Pardon me my  boldness, and do not refuse to admit into your court a prince who  is entirely devoted to you.'    'Prince,' answered the fairy, 'as I have been a long time my own  mistress, and am not dependent on my parents' consent, it is not as  a slave that I would admit you into my court, but as my husband,  pledging your faith to me. I am, as I said, mistress here; and must  add, that the same customs are not observed among fairies as among  other ladies.'    Prince Ahmed made no answer, but was so full of gratitude that he  thought he could not express it better than by coming to kiss the  hem of her garment. 'Then,' answered the fairy, 'you are my  husband, and I am your wife. But as I suppose,' continued she,  'that you have eaten nothing to-day, a slight repast shall be  served up for you while preparations are making for our wedding  feast this evening, and then I will show you the apartments of my  palace, and you shall judge if this hall is the smallest part of  it.'    Some of the fairy's women who came into the hall with them, and  guessed her intentions, immediately went out, and returned  presently with some excellent meat and wine.    When Prince Ahmed had eaten and drunk as much as he wanted, the  fairy Pari Banou took him through all the rooms, where he saw  diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and all sorts of fine jewels,  intermixed with pearls, agate, jasper, porphyry, and all kinds of  the most precious marbles; not to mention the richness of the  furniture, everything was in such profusion, that the prince  acknowledged that there could not be anything in the world that  could come up to it. 'Prince,' said the fairy, 'if you admire so  much my palace, which is indeed very beautiful, what would you say  to the palaces of the chiefs of our genies, which are much more  beautiful, spacious, and magnificent? I could also charm you with  my garden; but we will leave that till another time. Night draws  near, and it will be time for supper.'    The next hall into which the fairy led the prince, where the cloth  was laid for the feast, was the only room the prince had not seen,  and it was not in the least inferior to the others. He admired the  infinite number of wax candles perfumed with amber which formed an  agreeable and pleasant sight. A large sideboard was set out with  all sorts of gold plate, so finely wrought that the workmanship was  much more valuable than the weight of the gold. Several beautiful  women richly dressed, whose voices were ravishing, began a concert,  accompanied with all kinds of the most harmonious instruments he  had ever heard. When they had sat down to table, the fairy Pari  Banou took care to help Prince Ahmed to most delicious meats, which  the prince had never heard of, but found so nice that he commended  them in the highest terms, saying that they far surpassed those  among men. He found also the same excellence in the wines, which  neither he nor the fairy tasted till the dessert was served up,  which consisted of the choicest sweetmeats and fruits.    After the dessert, the fairy Pari Banou and Prince Ahmed rose from  the table, which was immediately carried away, and sat on a sofa  with cushions of fine silk, curiously embroidered with all sorts of  large flowers, at their backs, and a great number of genie and  fairies danced before them.    The days following the wedding were a continual feast, which the  fairy Pari Banou, who could do it with the utmost ease, knew how to  diversify by new dishes, new concerts, new dances, new shows, and  new diversions; which were all so extraordinary, that Prince Ahmed,  if he had lived a thousand years among men, could not have  imagined.    At the end of six months, Prince Ahmed, who always loved and  honoured the sultan his father, felt a great desire to know how he  was; and as that desire could not be satisfied without his  absenting himself to go and hear it in person, he mentioned it to  the fairy, and desired she would give him leave.    This discourse alarmed the fairy, and made her fear it was only an  excuse to leave her.    'My queen,' replied the prince, 'if you are offended at the leave I  asked, I entreat you to forgive me, and I will make all the  reparation I can. I did not do it with any intention of displeasing  you, but from a motive of respect towards my father, whom I wish to  free from the affliction in which my long absence must have  overwhelmed him; indeed I have reason to think he believes me  dead.'    'Prince,' said she, 'I am so fully convinced that I can depend upon  your sincerity, that I grant you leave to go, on condition that  your absence shall not be long.'    Prince Ahmed would have thrown himself at the fairy's feet, to show  his gratitude; but she prevented him.    'Prince,' said she, 'go when you please; but first do not take it  amiss if I give you some advice how you shall conduct yourself  where you are going. First, I do not think it proper for you to  tell the sultan your father of our marriage, nor what I am, nor the  place where you are settled. Beg him to be satisfied with knowing  that you are happy, and that you desire no more; and let him know  that the sole end of your visit is to make him easy about your  fate.'    She appointed twenty horsemen, well mounted and equipped, to attend  him. When all was ready, Prince Ahmed took leave of the fairy,  embraced her, and renewed his promise to return soon. Then his  horse, which was as beautiful a creature as any in the Sultan of  the Indies' stables, was brought, and he mounted him with an  extraordinary grace, which gave great pleasure to the fairy, and  after he had bid her a last adieu, set out on his journey.    As it was not a great way to his father's capital, Prince Ahmed  soon arrived there. The people, glad to see him again, received him  with acclamations, and followed him in crowds to the sultan's  palace. The sultan received and embraced him with great joy;  complaining at the same time with a fatherly tenderness, of the  affliction his long absence had been to him; which he said was the  more grievous, since as fortune had decided in favour of Prince Ali  his brother, he was afraid he might have committed some act of  despair.    'Sir,' replied Prince Ahmed, 'your majesty knows that when I shot  my arrow the most extraordinary thing that ever befell anybody  happened to me, that in so large and level a plain it should not be  possible to find my arrow. Though thus vanquished, I lost no time  in vain complaints; but to satisfy my perplexed mind, I gave my  attendants the slip, and returned back again alone to look for my  arrow. I sought all about the place where Prince Houssain's and  Prince Ali's arrows were found, and where I imagined mine must have  fallen; but all my labour was in vain, until after having gone four  leagues, to that part of the plain where it is bounded by rocks, I  perceived an arrow. I ran and took it up, and knew it to be the  same which I had shot. Far from thinking your majesty had done me  any injustice in declaring for my brother Prince Ali, I interpreted  what had happened to me quite otherwise, and never doubted but  there was a mystery in it to my advantage; the discovery of which I  ought not to neglect, and which I found out without going further  from the spot. But as to this mystery, I beg your majesty to let me  remain silent, and that you will be satisfied to know from my own  mouth that I am happy and contented. This was the only motive which  brought me hither; the only favour I ask of your majesty is to give  me leave to come often and pay you my respects, and inquire after  your health.'    'Son,' answered the Sultan of the Indies, 'I cannot refuse you the  leave you ask me; but I would much rather you would resolve to stay  with me. At least tell me where I may hear of you, if you should  fail to come, or when I may think your presence necessary.'    'Sir,' replied Prince Ahmed, 'what your majesty asks of me is part  of the mystery I spoke of. I beg of you to give me leave to remain  silent on this head; for I shall come so frequently where my duty  calls, that I am afraid I shall sooner be thought troublesome than  be accused of negligence in my duty.'    The Sultan of the Indies pressed Prince Ahmed no more; but said to  him, 'Son, I penetrate no further into your secrets, but leave you  at your liberty. I can only tell you, that you could not do me a  greater pleasure than to come and by your presence restore to me  the joy I have not felt for a long time, and that you will always  be welcome when you come.'    Prince Ahmed stayed but three days at the sultan his father's  court, and on the fourth returned to the fairy Pari Banou, who  received him with great joy, as she did not expect him so soon.    A month after Prince Ahmed's return from paying a visit to his  father, as the fairy Pari Banou had observed that since the time  that the Prince gave her an account of his journey and his  conversation with his father, in which he asked his leave to come  and see him from time to time, he had never spoken of the sultan,  as if there had been no such person in the world, whereas before he  was always speaking of him, she said to him one day, 'Tell me,  prince, have you forgotten the sultan your father? Do you not  remember the promise you made to go and see him from time to time?  For my part, I have not forgotten what you told me at your return,  and put you in mind of it. Pay him another visit "]]]
