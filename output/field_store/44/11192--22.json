Neither had made a noise that would  have been appreciable to human ears at a dozen paces.    Stopping often to listen they crept forward through the trees.  That  both were greatly puzzled was apparent from the questioning looks they  cast at one another from time to time.  Finally the lad caught a  glimpse of a palisade a hundred yards ahead, and beyond it the tops of  some goatskin tents and a number of thatched huts.  His lip upcurled in  a savage snarl.  Blacks!  How he hated them.  He signed to Akut to  remain where he was while he advanced to reconnoiter.    Woe betide the unfortunate villager whom The Killer came upon now.  Slinking through the lower branches of the trees, leaping lightly from  one jungle giant to its neighbor where the distance was not too great,  or swinging from one hand hold to another Korak came silently toward  the village.  He heard a voice beyond the palisade and toward that he  made his way.  A great tree overhung the enclosure at the very point  from which the voice came.  Into this Korak crept.  His spear was ready  in his hand.  His ears told him of the proximity of a human being.  All  that his eyes required was a single glance to show him his target.  Then, lightning like, the missile would fly to its goal.  With raised  spear he crept among the branches of the tree glaring narrowly downward  in search of the owner of the voice which rose to him from below.    At last he saw a human back.  The spear hand flew to the limit of the  throwing position to gather the force that would send the iron shod  missile completely through the body of the unconscious victim.  And  then The Killer paused.  He leaned forward a little to get a better  view of the target.  Was it to insure more perfect aim, or had there  been that in the graceful lines and the childish curves of the little  body below him that had held in check the spirit of murder running riot  in his veins?    He lowered his spear cautiously that it might make no noise by scraping  against foliage or branches.  Quietly he crouched in a comfortable  position along a great limb and there he lay with wide eyes looking  down in wonder upon the creature he had crept upon to kill--looking  down upon a little girl, a little nut brown maiden.  The snarl had gone  from his lip.  His only expression was one of interested attention--he  was trying to discover what the girl was doing.  Suddenly a broad grin  overspread his face, for a turn of the girl's body had revealed Geeka  of the ivory head and the rat skin torso--Geeka of the splinter limbs  and the disreputable appearance.  The little girl raised the marred  face to hers and rocking herself backward and forward crooned a  plaintive Arab lullaby to the doll.  A softer light entered the eyes of  The Killer.  For a long hour that passed very quickly to him Korak lay  with gaze riveted upon the playing child.  Not once had he had a view  of the girl's full face.  For the most part he saw only a mass of wavy,  black hair, one brown little shoulder exposed upon the side from where  her single robe was caught beneath her arm, and a shapely knee  protruding from beneath her garment as she sat cross legged upon the  ground.  A tilt of the head as she emphasized some maternal admonition  to the passive Geeka revealed occasionally a rounded cheek or a piquant  little chin.  Now she was shaking a slim finger at Geeka, reprovingly,  and again she crushed to her heart this only object upon which she  might lavish the untold wealth of her childish affections.    Korak, momentarily forgetful of his bloody mission, permitted the  fingers of his spear hand to relax a little their grasp upon the shaft  of his formidable weapon.  It slipped, almost falling; but the  occurrence recalled The Killer to himself.  It reminded him of his  purpose in slinking stealthily upon the owner of the voice that had  attracted his vengeful attention.  He glanced at the spear, with its  well-worn grip and cruel, barbed head.  Then he let his eyes wander  again to the dainty form below him.  In imagination he saw the heavy  weapon shooting downward.  He saw it pierce the tender flesh, driving  its way deep into the yielding body.  He saw the ridiculous doll drop  from its owner's arms to lie sprawled and pathetic beside the quivering  body of the little girl.  The Killer shuddered, scowling at the  inanimate iron and wood of the spear as though they constituted a  sentient being endowed with a malignant mind.    Korak wondered what the girl would do were he to drop suddenly from the  tree to her side.  Most likely she would scream and run away.  Then  would come the men of the village with spears and guns and set upon  him.  They would either kill him or drive him away.  A lump rose in the  boy's throat.  He craved the companionship of his own kind, though he  scarce realized how greatly.  He would have liked to slip down beside  the little girl and talk with her, though he knew from the words he had  overheard that she spoke a language with which he was unfamiliar.  They  could have talked by signs a little.  That would have been better than  nothing.  Too, he would have been glad to see her face.  What he had  glimpsed assured him that she was pretty; but her strongest appeal to  him lay in the affectionate nature revealed by her gentle mothering of  the grotesque doll.    At last he hit upon a plan.  He would attract her attention, and  reassure her by a smiling greeting from a greater distance.  Silently  he wormed his way back into the tree.  It was his intention to hail her  from beyond the palisade, giving her the feeling of security which he  imagined the stout barricade would afford.    He had scarcely left his position in the tree when his attention was  attracted by a considerable noise upon the opposite side of the  village.  By moving a little he could see the gate at the far end of  the main street.  A number of men, women and children were running  toward it.  It swung open, revealing the head of a caravan upon the  opposite side.  In trooped the motley organization--black slaves and  dark hued Arabs of the northern deserts; cursing camel drivers urging  on their vicious charges; overburdened donkeys, waving sadly pendulous  ears while they endured with stoic patience the brutalities of their  masters; goats, sheep and horses.  Into the village they all trooped  behind a tall, sour, old man, who rode without greetings to those who  shrunk from his path directly to a large goatskin tent in the center of  the village.  Here he spoke to a wrinkled hag.    Korak, from his vantage spot, could see it all.  He saw the old man  asking questions of the black woman, and then he saw the latter point  toward a secluded corner of the village which was hidden from the main  street by the tents of the Arabs and the huts of the natives in the  direction of the tree beneath which the little girl played.  This was  doubtless her father, thought Korak.  He had been away and his first  thought upon returning was of his little daughter.  How glad she would  be to see him!  How she would run and throw herself into his arms, to  be crushed to his breast and covered with his kisses.  Korak sighed.  He thought of his own father and mother far away in London.    He returned to his place in the tree above the girl.  If he couldn't  have happiness of this sort himself he wanted to enjoy the happiness of  others.  Possibly if he made himself known to the old man he might be  permitted to come to the village occasionally as a friend.  It would be  worth trying.  He would wait until the old Arab had greeted his  daughter, then he would make his presence known with signs of peace.    The Arab was striding softly toward the girl.  In a moment he would be  beside her, and then how surprised and delighted she would be!  Korak's  eyes sparkled in anticipation--and now the old man stood behind the  little girl.  His stern old face was still unrelaxed.  The child was  yet unconscious of his presence.  She prattled on to the unresponsive  Geeka.  Then the old man coughed.  With a start the child glanced  quickly up over her shoulder.  Korak could see her full face now.  It  was very beautiful in its sweet and innocent childishness--all soft and  lovely curves.  He could see her great, dark eyes.  He looked for the  happy love light that would follow recognition; but it did not come.  Instead, terror, stark, paralyzing terror, was mirrored in her eyes, in  the expression of her mouth, in the tense, cowering attitude of her  body.  A grim smile curved the thin, cruel lip of the Arab.  The child  essayed to crawl away; but before she could get out of his reach the  old man kicked her brutally, sending her sprawling upon the grass.  Then he followed her up to seize and strike her as was his custom.    Above them, in the tree, a beast crouched where a moment before had  been a boy--a beast with dilating nostrils and bared fangs--a beast  that trembled with rage.    The Sheik was stooping to reach for the girl when The Killer dropped to  the ground at his side.  His spear was still in his left hand but he  had forgotten it.  Instead his right fist was clenched and as The Sheik  took a backward step, astonished by the sudden materialization of this  strange apparition apparently out of clear air, the heavy fist landed  full upon his mouth backed by the weight of the young giant and the  terrific power of his more than human muscles.    Bleeding and senseless The Sheik sank to earth.  Korak turned toward  the child.  She had regained her feet and stood wide eyed and  frightened, looking first into his face and then, horror struck, at the  recumbent figure of The Sheik.  In an involuntary gesture of protection  The Killer threw an arm about the girl's shoulders and stood waiting  for the Arab to regain consciousness.  For a moment they remained thus,  when the girl spoke.    \"When he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/903"],[0,"The White Company (#17)"],[1,"us. I  am a man who shoots straight at his mark. You saw the things I had  with me at yonder hostel: name which you will, save only the box of  rose-colored sugar which I take to the Lady Loring, and you shall have  it if you will but come with me to France.\"    \"Nay,\" said Alleyne, \"I would gladly come with ye to France or where  else ye will, just to list to your talk, and because ye are the only two  friends that I have in the whole wide world outside of the cloisters;  but, indeed, it may not be, for my duty is towards my brother, seeing  that father and mother are dead, and he my elder. Besides, when ye talk  of taking me to France, ye do not conceive how useless I should be to  you, seeing that neither by training nor by nature am I fitted for the  wars, and there seems to be nought but strife in those parts.\"    \"That comes from my fool's talk,\" cried the archer; \"for being a man of  no learning myself, my tongue turns to blades and targets, even as  my hand does. Know then that for every parchment in England there are  twenty in France. For every statue, cut gem, shrine, carven screen,  or what else might please the eye of a learned clerk, there are a good  hundred to our one. At the spoiling of Carcasonne I have seen chambers  stored with writing, though not one man in our Company could read them.  Again, in Arles and Nimes, and other towns that I could name, there are  the great arches and fortalices still standing which were built of old  by giant men who came from the south. Can I not see by your brightened  eye how you would love to look upon these things? Come then with me,  and, by these ten finger-bones! there is not one of them which you shall  not see.\"    \"I should indeed love to look upon them,\" Alleyne answered; \"but I have  come from Beaulieu for a purpose, and I must be true to my service, even  as thou art true to thine.\"    \"Bethink you again, mon ami,\" quoth Aylward, \"that you might do much  good yonder, since there are three hundred men in the Company, and none  who has ever a word of grace for them, and yet the Virgin knows that  there was never a set of men who were in more need of it. Sickerly the  one duty may balance the other. Your brother hath done without you this  many a year, and, as I gather, he hath never walked as far as Beaulieu  to see you during all that time, so he cannot be in any great need of  you.\"    \"Besides,\" said John, \"the Socman of Minstead is a by-word through the  forest, from Bramshaw Hill to Holmesley Walk. He is a drunken, brawling,  perilous churl, as you may find to your cost.\"    \"The more reason that I should strive to mend him,\" quoth Alleyne.  \"There is no need to urge me, friends, for my own wishes would draw  me to France, and it would be a joy to me if I could go with you. But  indeed and indeed it cannot be, so here I take my leave of you, for  yonder square tower amongst the trees upon the right must surely be the  church of Minstead, and I may reach it by this path through the woods.\"    \"Well, God be with thee, lad!\" cried the archer, pressing Alleyne to his  heart. \"I am quick to love, and quick to hate and 'fore God I am loth to  part.\"    \"Would it not be well,\" said John, \"that we should wait here, and see  what manner of greeting you have from your brother. You may prove to be  as welcome as the king's purveyor to the village dame.\"    \"Nay, nay,\" he answered; \"ye must not bide for me, for where I go I  stay.\"    \"Yet it may be as well that you should know whither we go,\" said the  archer. \"We shall now journey south through the woods until we come out  upon the Christchurch road, and so onwards, hoping to-night to reach the  castle of Sir William Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, of which Sir Nigel  Loring is constable. There we shall bide, and it is like enough that for  a month or more you may find us there, ere we are ready for our viage  back to France.\"    It was hard indeed for Alleyne to break away from these two new but  hearty friends, and so strong was the combat between his conscience  and his inclinations that he dared not look round, lest his resolution  should slip away from him. It was not until he was deep among the tree  trunks that he cast a glance backwards, when he found that he could  still see them through the branches on the road above him. The archer  was standing with folded arms, his bow jutting from over his shoulder,  and the sun gleaming brightly upon his head-piece and the links of  his chain-mail. Beside him stood his giant recruit, still clad in the  home-spun and ill-fitting garments of the fuller of Lymington, with arms  and legs shooting out of his scanty garb. Even as Alleyne watched them  they turned upon their heels and plodded off together upon their way.        CHAPTER IX. HOW STRANGE THINGS BEFELL IN MINSTEAD WOOD.      The path which the young clerk had now to follow lay through a  magnificent forest of the very heaviest timber, where the giant bowls  of oak and of beech formed long aisles in every direction, shooting  up their huge branches to build the majestic arches of Nature's own  cathedral. Beneath lay a broad carpet of the softest and greenest moss,  flecked over with fallen leaves, but yielding pleasantly to the foot of  the traveller. The track which guided him was one so seldom used that in  places it lost itself entirely among the grass, to reappear as a reddish  rut between the distant tree trunks. It was very still here in the heart  of the woodlands. The gentle rustle of the branches and the distant  cooing of pigeons were the only sounds which broke in upon the silence,  save that once Alleyne heard afar off a merry call upon a hunting bugle  and the shrill yapping of the hounds.    It was not without some emotion that he looked upon the scene around  him, for, in spite of his secluded life, he knew enough of the ancient  greatness of his own family to be aware that the time had been when they  had held undisputed and paramount sway over all that tract of country.  His father could trace his pure Saxon lineage back to that Godfrey Malf  who had held the manors of Bisterne and of Minstead at the time when the  Norman first set mailed foot upon English soil. The afforestation of the  district, however, and its conversion into a royal demesne had  clipped off a large section of his estate, while other parts had been  confiscated as a punishment for his supposed complicity in an abortive  Saxon rising. The fate of the ancestor had been typical of that of his  descendants. During three hundred years their domains had gradually  contracted, sometimes through royal or feudal encroachment, and  sometimes through such gifts to the Church as that with which Alleyne's  father had opened the doors of Beaulieu Abbey to his younger son. The  importance of the family had thus dwindled, but they still retained the  old Saxon manor-house, with a couple of farms and a grove large enough  to afford pannage to a hundred pigs--\"sylva de centum porcis,\" as the  old family parchments describe it. Above all, the owner of the soil  could still hold his head high as the veritable Socman of Minstead--that  is, as holding the land in free socage, with no feudal superior, and  answerable to no man lower than the king. Knowing this, Alleyne felt  some little glow of worldly pride as he looked for the first time  upon the land with which so many generations of his ancestors had been  associated. He pushed on the quicker, twirling his staff merrily, and  looking out at every turn of the path for some sign of the old Saxon  residence. He was suddenly arrested, however, by the appearance of a  wild-looking fellow armed with a club, who sprang out from behind a tree  and barred his passage. He was a rough, powerful peasant, with cap and  tunic of untanned sheepskin, leather breeches, and galligaskins round  legs and feet.    \"Stand!\" he shouted, raising his heavy cudgel to enforce the order. \"Who  are you who walk so freely through the wood? Whither would you go, and  what is your errand?\"    \"Why should I answer your questions, my friend?\" said Alleyne, standing  on his guard.    \"Because your tongue may save your pate. But where have I looked upon  your face before?\"    \"No longer ago than last night at the 'Pied Merlin,'\" the clerk  answered, recognizing the escaped serf who had been so outspoken as to  his wrongs.    \"By the Virgin! yes. You were the little clerk who sat so mum in the  corner, and then cried fy on the gleeman. What hast in the scrip?\"    \"Naught of any price.\"    \"How can I tell that, clerk? Let me see.\"    \"Not I.\"    \"Fool! I could pull you limb from limb like a pullet. What would you  have? Hast forgot that we are alone far from all men? How can your  clerkship help you? Wouldst lose scrip and life too?\"    \"I will part with neither without fight.\"    \"A fight, quotha? A fight betwixt spurred cock and new hatched chicken!  Thy fighting days may soon be over.\"    \"Hadst asked me in the name of charity I would have given freely,\" cried  Alleyne. \"As it stands, not one farthing shall you have with my free  will, and when I see my brother, the Socman of Minstead, he will raise  hue and cry from vill to vill, from hundred to hundred, until you are  taken as a common robber and a scourge to the country.\"    The outlaw sank his club. \"The Socman's brother!\" he gasped. \"Now,  by the keys of Peter! I had rather that hand withered and tongue was  palsied ere I had struck or miscalled you. If you are the Socman's  brother you are one of the right side, I warrant, for all your clerkly  dress.\"    \"His brother I am,\" said Alleyne. \"But if I were not, is that reason why  you should molest me on the king's ground?\"    \"I give not the pip of an apple for king or for noble,\" cried the serf  passionately. \"Ill have I had from them, and ill I shall repay them. I  am a good friend to my friends, and, by the Virgin! an evil foeman to my  foes.\"    \"And therefore the worst of foemen to thyself,\" said Alleyne. "]]]
