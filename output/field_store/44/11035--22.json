But when I'm home in Kansas I'm only a country girl, and have to  help with the churning and wipe the dishes while Aunt Em washes 'em.  Do you have to help wash dishes on the rainbow, Polly?\"    \"No, dear,\" answered Polychrome, smiling.    \"Well, I don't have to work any in Oz, either,\" said Dorothy.  \"It's  kind of fun to be a Princess once in a while; don't you think so?\"    \"Dorothy and Polychrome and Button-Bright are all to ride in the  chariot,\" said the Lion.  \"So get in, my dears, and be careful not to  mar the gold or put your dusty feet on the embroidery.\"    Button-Bright was delighted to ride behind such a superb team, and he  told Dorothy it made him feel like an actor in a circus.  As the  strides of the animals brought them nearer to the Emerald City every  one bowed respectfully to the children, as well as to the Tin Woodman,  Tik-tok, and the shaggy man, who were following behind.    The Yellow Hen had perched upon the back of the chariot, where she  could tell Dorothy more about her wonderful chickens as they rode.  And  so the grand chariot came finally to the high wall surrounding the  City, and paused before the magnificent jewel-studded gates.    These were opened by a cheerful-looking little man who wore green  spectacles over his eyes.  Dorothy introduced him to her friends as the  Guardian of the Gates, and they noticed a big bunch of keys suspended  on the golden chain that hung around his neck.  The chariot passed  through the outer gates into a fine arched chamber built in the thick  wall, and through the inner gates into the streets of the Emerald City.    Polychrome exclaimed in rapture at the wondrous beauty that met her  eyes on every side as they rode through this stately and imposing City,  the equal of which has never been discovered, even in Fairyland.  Button-Bright could only say \"My!\" so amazing was the sight; but his  eyes were wide open and he tried to look in every direction at the same  time, so as not to miss anything.    The shaggy man was fairly astounded at what he saw, for the graceful  and handsome buildings were covered with plates of gold and set with  emeralds so splendid and valuable that in any other part of the world  any one of them would have been worth a fortune to its owner.  The  sidewalks were superb marble slabs polished as smooth as glass, and the  curbs that separated the walks from the broad street were also set  thick with clustered emeralds.  There were many people on these  walks--men, women and children--all dressed in handsome garments of  silk or satin or velvet, with beautiful jewels.  Better even than this:  all seemed happy and contented, for their faces were smiling and free  from care, and music and laughter might be heard on every side.    \"Don't they work at all?\" asked the shaggy man.    \"To be sure they work,\" replied the Tin Woodman; \"this fair city could  not be built or cared for without labor, nor could the fruit and  vegetables and other food be provided for the inhabitants to eat.  But  no one works more than half his time, and the people of Oz enjoy their  labors as much as they do their play.\"    \"It's wonderful!\" declared the shaggy man.  \"I do hope Ozma will let me  live here.\"    The chariot, winding through many charming streets, paused before a  building so vast and noble and elegant that even Button-Bright guessed  at once that it was the Royal Palace.  Its gardens and ample grounds  were surrounded by a separate wall, not so high or thick as the wall  around the City, but more daintily designed and built all of green  marble.  The gates flew open as the chariot appeared before them, and  the Cowardly Lion and Hungry Tiger trotted up a jeweled driveway to the  front door of the palace and stopped short.    \"Here we are!\" said Dorothy, gaily, and helped Button-Bright from the  chariot.  Polychrome leaped out lightly after them, and they were  greeted by a crowd of gorgeously dressed servants who bowed low as the  visitors mounted the marble steps.  At their head was a pretty little  maid with dark hair and eyes, dressed all in green embroidered with  silver.  Dorothy ran up to her with evident pleasure, and exclaimed:    \"O, Jellia Jamb! I'm so glad to see you again.  Where's Ozma?\"    \"In her room, your Highness,\" replied the little maid demurely, for  this was Ozma's favorite attendant.  \"She wishes you to come to her as  soon as you have rested and changed your dress, Princess Dorothy.  And  you and your friends are to dine with her this evening.\"    \"When is her birthday, Jellia?\" asked the girl.    \"Day after to-morrow, your Highness.\"    \"And where's the Scarecrow?\"    \"He's gone into the Munchkin country to get some fresh straw to stuff  himself with, in honor of Ozma's celebration,\" replied the maid.  \"He  returns to the Emerald City to-morrow, he said.\"    By this time, Tok-tok, the Tin Woodman, and the shaggy man had arrived  and the chariot had gone around to the back of the palace, Billina  going with the Lion and Tiger to see her chickens after her absence  from them.  But Toto stayed close beside Dorothy.    \"Come in, please,\" said Jellia Jamb; \"it shall be our pleasant duty to  escort all of you to the rooms prepared for your use.\"    The shaggy man hesitated.  Dorothy had never known him to be ashamed of  his shaggy looks before, but now that he was surrounded by so much  magnificence and splendor the shaggy man felt sadly out of place.    Dorothy assured him that all her friends were welcome at Ozma's palace,  so he carefully dusted his shaggy shoes with his shaggy handkerchief  and entered the grand hall after the others.    Tik-tok lived at the Royal Palace and the Tin Woodman always had the  same room whenever he visited Ozma, so these two went at once to remove  the dust of the journey from their shining bodies.  Dorothy also had a  pretty suite of rooms which she always occupied when in the Emerald  City; but several servants walked ahead politely to show the way,  although she was quite sure she could find the rooms herself.  She took  Button-Bright with her, because he seemed too small to be left alone in  such a big palace; but Jellia Jamb herself ushered the beautiful  Daughter of the Rainbow to her apartments, because it was easy to see  that Polychrome was used to splendid palaces and was therefore entitled  to especial attention.          19.  The Shaggy Man's Welcome      The shaggy man stood in the great hall, his shaggy hat in his hands,  wondering what would become of him.  He had never been a guest in a  fine palace before; perhaps he had never been a guest anywhere.  In the  big, cold, outside world people did not invite shaggy men to their  homes, and this shaggy man of ours had slept more in hay-lofts and  stables than in comfortable rooms.  When the others left the great hall  he eyed the splendidly dressed servants of the Princess Ozma as if he  expected to be ordered out; but one of them bowed before him as  respectfully as if he had been a prince, and said:    \"Permit me, sir, to conduct you to your apartments.\"    The shaggy man drew a long breath and took courage.    \"Very well,\" he answered.  \"I'm ready.\"    Through the big hall they went, up the grand staircase carpeted thick  with velvet, and so along a wide corridor to a carved doorway.  Here  the servant paused, and opening the door said with polite deference:    \"Be good enough to enter, sir, and make yourself at home in the rooms  our Royal Ozma has ordered prepared for you.  Whatever you see is for  you to use and enjoy, as if your own.  The Princess dines at seven, and  I shall be here in time to lead you to the drawing-room, where you will  be privileged to meet the lovely Ruler of Oz.  Is there any command, in  the meantime, with which you desire to honor me?\"    \"No,\" said the shaggy man; \"but I'm much obliged.\"    He entered the room and shut the door, and for a time stood in  bewilderment, admiring the grandeur before him.    He had been given one of the handsomest apartments in the most  magnificent palace in the world, and you can not wonder that his good  fortune astonished and awed him until he grew used to his surroundings.    The furniture was upholstered in cloth of gold, with the royal crown  embroidered upon it in scarlet.  The rug upon the marble floor was so  thick and soft that he could not hear the sound of his own footsteps,  and upon the walls were splendid tapestries woven with scenes from the  Land of Oz.  Books and ornaments were scattered about in profusion, and  the shaggy man thought he had never seen so many pretty things in one  place before.  In one corner played a tinkling fountain of perfumed  water, and in another was a table bearing a golden tray loaded with  freshly gathered fruit, including several of the red-cheeked apples  that the shaggy man loved.    At the farther end of this charming room was an open doorway, and he  crossed over to find himself in a bedroom containing more comforts than  the shaggy man had ever before imagined.  The bedstead was of gold and  set with many brilliant diamonds, and the coverlet had designs of  pearls and rubies sewed upon it.  At one side of the bedroom was a  dainty dressing-room with closets containing a large assortment of  fresh clothing; and beyond this was the bath--a large room having a  marble pool big enough to swim in, with white marble steps leading down  to the water.  Around the edge of the pool were set rows of fine  emeralds as large as door-knobs, while the water of the bath was clear  as crystal.    For a time the shaggy man gazed upon all this luxury with silent  amazement.  Then he decided, being wise in his way, to take advantage  of his good fortune.  He removed his shaggy boots and his shaggy  clothing, and bathed in the pool "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/486"],[0,"Ozma of Oz (#17)"],[1,"she had not yet grown accustomed to the wizardries of  these fairy countries, so different from the quiet and sensible  common-places of her own native land.    Slowly she passed through several rooms until she came upon Tiktok,  standing motionless.  It really seemed, then, that she had found a  friend in this mysterious palace, so she hastened to wind up the  machine man's action and speech and thoughts.    \"Thank you, Dor-oth-y,\" were his first words.  \"I have now one more  guess to make.\"    \"Oh, be very careful, Tiktok; won't you?\" cried the girl.    \"Yes.  But the Nome King has us in his power, and he has set a trap for  us.  I fear we are all lost.\" he answered.    \"I fear so, too,\" said Dorothy, sadly.    \"If Smith & Tin-ker had giv-en me a guess-ing clock-work at-tach-ment,\"  continued Tiktok, \"I might have de-fied the Nome King.  But my thoughts  are plain and sim-ple, and are not of much use in this case.\"    \"Do the best you can,\" said Dorothy, encouragingly, \"and if you fail I  will watch and see what shape you are changed into.\"    So Tiktok touched a yellow glass vase that had daisies painted on one  side, and he spoke at the same time the word \"Ev.\"    In a flash the machine man had disappeared, and although the girl  looked quickly in every direction, she could not tell which of the many  ornaments the room contained had a moment before been her faithful  friend and servant.    So all she could do was to accept the hopeless task set her, and make  her guesses and abide by the result.    \"It can't hurt very much,\" she thought, \"for I haven't heard any of  them scream or cry out--not even the poor officers.  Dear me!  I wonder  if Uncle Henry or Aunt Em will ever know I have become an orn'ment in  the Nome King's palace, and must stand forever and ever in one place  and look pretty--'cept when I'm moved to be dusted.  It isn't the way I  thought I'd turn out, at all; but I s'pose it can't be helped.\"    She walked through all the rooms once more, and examined with care all  the objects they contained; but there were so many, they bewildered  her, and she decided, after all, as Ozma had done, that it could be  only guess work at the best, and that the chances were much against her  guessing aright.    Timidly she touched an alabaster bowl and said: \"Ev.\"    \"That's one failure, anyhow,\" she thought.  \"But how am I to know which  thing is enchanted, and which is not?\"    Next she touched the image of a purple kitten that stood on the corner  of a mantel, and as she pronounced the word \"Ev\" the kitten  disappeared, and a pretty, fair-haired boy stood beside her.  At the  same time a bell rang somewhere in the distance, and as Dorothy started  back, partly in surprise and partly in joy, the little one exclaimed:    \"Where am I?  And who are you?  And what has happened to me?\"    \"Well, I declare!\" said Dorothy.  \"I've really done it.\"    \"Done what?\" asked the boy.    \"Saved myself from being an ornament,\" replied the girl, with a laugh,  \"and saved you from being forever a purple kitten.\"    \"A purple kitten?\" he repeated.  \"There IS no such thing.\"    \"I know,\" she answered.  \"But there was, a minute ago.  Don't you  remember standing on a corner of the mantel?\"    \"Of course not.  I am a Prince of Ev, and my name is Evring,\" the  little one announced, proudly.  \"But my father, the King, sold my  mother and all her children to the cruel ruler of the Nomes, and after  that I remember nothing at all.\"    \"A purple kitten can't be 'spected to remember, Evring,\" said Dorothy.  \"But now you are yourself again, and I'm going to try to save some of  your brothers and sisters, and perhaps your mother, as well.  So come  with me.\"    She seized the child's hand and eagerly hurried here and there, trying  to decide which object to choose next.  The third guess was another  failure, and so was the fourth and the fifth.    Little Evring could not imagine what she was doing, but he trotted  along beside her very willingly, for he liked the new companion he had  found.    Dorothy's further quest proved unsuccessful; but after her first  disappointment was over, the little girl was filled with joy and  thankfulness to think that after all she had been able to save one  member of the royal family of Ev, and could restore the little Prince  to his sorrowing country.  Now she might return to the terrible Nome  King in safety, carrying with her the prize she had won in the person  of the fair-haired boy.    So she retraced her steps until she found the entrance to the palace,  and as she approached, the massive doors of rock opened of their own  accord, allowing both Dorothy and Evring to pass the portals and enter  the throne room.          15.  Billina Frightens the Nome King      Now when Dorothy had entered the palace to make her guesses and the  Scarecrow was left with the Nome King, the two sat in moody silence for  several minutes.  Then the monarch exclaimed, in a tone of satisfaction:    \"Very good!\"    \"Who is very good?\" asked the Scarecrow.    \"The machine man.  He won't need to be wound up any more, for he has  now become a very neat ornament.  Very neat, indeed.\"    \"How about Dorothy?\" the Scarecrow enquired.    \"Oh, she will begin to guess, pretty soon,\" said the King, cheerfully.  \"And then she will join my collection, and it will be your turn.\"    The good Scarecrow was much distressed by the thought that his little  friend was about to suffer the fate of Ozma and the rest of their  party; but while he sat in gloomy reverie a shrill voice suddenly cried:    \"Kut, kut, kut--ka-daw-kutt!  Kut, kut, kut--ka-daw-kutt!\"    The Nome King nearly jumped off his seat, he was so startled.    \"Good gracious!  What's that?\" he yelled.    \"Why, it's Billina,\" said the Scarecrow.    \"What do you mean by making a noise like that?\" shouted the King,  angrily, as the yellow hen came from under the throne and strutted  proudly about the room.    \"I've got a right to cackle, I guess,\" replied Billina.  \"I've just  laid my egg.\"    \"What!  Laid an egg!  In my throne room!  How dare you do such a  thing?\" asked the King, in a voice of fury.    \"I lay eggs wherever I happen to be,\" said the hen, ruffling her  feathers and then shaking them into place.    \"But--thunder-ation!  Don't you know that eggs are poison?\" roared the  King, while his rock-colored eyes stuck out in great terror.    \"Poison! well, I declare,\" said Billina, indignantly.  \"I'll have you  know all my eggs are warranted strictly fresh and up to date.  Poison,  indeed!\"    \"You don't understand,\" retorted the little monarch, nervously.  \"Eggs  belong only to the outside world--to the world on the earth's surface,  where you came from.  Here, in my underground kingdom, they are rank  poison, as I said, and we Nomes can't bear them around.\"    \"Well, you'll have to bear this one around,\" declared Billina; \"for  I've laid it.\"    \"Where?\" asked the King.    \"Under your throne,\" said the hen.    The King jumped three feet into the air, so anxious was he to get away  from the throne.    \"Take it away!  Take it away at once!\" he shouted.    \"I can't,\" said Billina.  \"I haven't any hands.\"    \"I'll take the egg,\" said the Scarecrow.  \"I'm making a collection of  Billina's eggs.  There's one in my pocket now, that she laid yesterday.\"    Hearing this, the monarch hastened to put a good distance between  himself and the Scarecrow, who was about to reach under the throne for  the egg when the hen suddenly cried:    \"Stop!\"    \"What's wrong?\" asked the Scarecrow.    \"Don't take the egg unless the King will allow me to enter the palace  and guess as the others have done,\" said Billina.    \"Pshaw!\" returned the King.  \"You're only a hen.  How could you guess  my enchantments?\"    \"I can try, I suppose,\" said Billina.  \"And, if I fail, you will have  another ornament.\"    \"A pretty ornament you'd make, wouldn't you?\" growled the King.  \"But  you shall have your way.  It will properly punish you for daring to lay  an egg in my presence.  After the Scarecrow is enchanted you shall  follow him into the palace.  But how will you touch the objects?\"    \"With my claws,\" said the hen; \"and I can speak the word 'Ev' as  plainly as anyone.  Also I must have the right to guess the  enchantments of my friends, and to release them if I succeed.\"    \"Very well,\" said the King.  \"You have my promise.\"    \"Then,\" said Billina to the Scarecrow, \"you may get the egg.\"    He knelt down and reached underneath the throne and found the egg,  which he placed in another pocket of his jacket, fearing that if both  eggs were in one pocket they would knock together and get broken.    Just then a bell above the throne rang briskly, and the King gave  another nervous jump.    \"Well, well!\" said he, with a rueful face; \"the girl has actually done  it.\"    \"Done what?\" asked the Scarecrow.    \"She has made one guess that is right, and broken one of my neatest  enchantments.  By ricketty, it's too bad!  I never thought she would do  it.\"    \"Do I understand that she will now return to us in safety?\" enquired  the Scarecrow, joyfully wrinkling his painted face into a broad smile.    \"Of course,\" said the King, fretfully pacing up and down the room.  \"I  always keep my promises, no matter how foolish they are.  But I shall  make an ornament of the yellow hen to replace the one I have just lost.\"    \"Perhaps you will, and perhaps you won't,\" murmured Billina, calmly.  \"I may surprise you by guessing right.\"    \"Guessing right?\" snapped the King.  \"How could you guess right, where  your betters have failed, you stupid fowl?\"    Billina did not care to answer this question, and a moment later the  doors flew open and Dorothy entered, leading the little Prince Evring  by the hand.    The Scarecrow welcomed the girl with a close embrace, and he would have  embraced Evring, too, in his delight.  But the little Prince was shy,  and shrank away from the painted Scarecrow because he did not yet know  his "]]]
