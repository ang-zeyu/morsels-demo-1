And if the truth be told, he was a little annoyed at Mr. Hopper's  free use of her name.    \"That shouldn't make no difference,\" said Eliphalet with just a shade  of bitterness in his tone. \"They keep open house, like all Southerners,\"  Mr. Hopper hesitated,--\"for such as come well recommended. I 'most  forgot,\" said he. \"I callate you're not any too well recommended. I  'most forgot that little transaction down to the Court House. They do  say that she wanted that gal almighty bad,--she was most awful cut up  not to get her. Served her right, though. I'm glad you did. Show her she  can't have everything her own way. And say,\" he added, with laughter,  \"how you did fix that there stuckup Colfax boy! He'll never forgive  you no more than she. But,\" said Mr. Hopper, meditatively, \"it was a  durned-fool trick.\"    I think Stephen's critics will admit that he had a good right to be  angry, and that they will admire him just a little bit because he kept  his temper. But Mr. Hopper evidently thought he had gone too far.    \"She ain't got no use for me, neither,\" he said.    \"She shows poor judgment,\" answered Stephen.    \"She's not long sighted, that's sure,\" replied Eliphalet, with emphasis.    At dinner Stephen was tried still further. And it was then he made the  determination to write for the newspapers in order to pay the rent on  Mr. Brinsmade's house. Miss Carvel's coming-out party was the chief  topic.    \"They do say the Colonel is to spend a sight of money on that ball,\"  said Mrs. Abner Reed. \"I guess it won't bankrupt him.\" And she looked  hard at Mr. Hopper.    \"I callate he ain't pushed for money,\" that gentleman vouchsafed.    \"He's a good man, and done well by you, Mr. Hopper.\"    \"So--so,\" answered Eliphalet. \"But I will say that I done something for  the Colonel. I've saved him a hundred times my pay since I showed old  Hood the leaks. And I got a thousand dollar order from Wright & Company  this week for him.\"    \"I dare say you'd keep a tight hand enough on expenses,\" said Miss  Crane, half in sarcasm, half in approval.    \"If Colonel Carvel was doin' business in New England,\" said Eliphalet,  \"he'd been bankrupt long ago.\"    \"That young Clarence Colfax,\" Mrs. Abner Reed broke in, \"he'll get a  right smart mint o' money when he marries Virginia. They do say her  mother left her independent. How now, Mr. Hopper?\"    Eliphalet looked mysterious and knowing. He did not reply.    \"And young Colfax ain't precisely a pauper,\" said Miss Crane.    \"I'll risk a good deal that she don't marry Colfax,\" said Mr. Hopper.    \"What on earth do you mean?\" cried Mrs. Abner. \"It ain't broke off?\"    \"No,\" he answered, \"it ain't broke off. But I callate she won't have him  when the time comes. She's got too much sense.\"    Heavy at heart, Stephen climbed the stairs, thanking heaven that he  had not been drawn into the controversy. A partial comprehension of  Mr. Hopper was dawning upon him. He suspected that gentleman of an  aggressive determination to achieve wealth, and the power which comes  with it, for the purpose of using that power upon those beneath  him. Nay, when he thought over his conversation, he suspected him of  more,--of the intention to marry Virginia Carvel.    It will be seen whether Stephen was right or wrong.    He took a walk that afternoon, as far out as a place called Lindell's  Grove, which afterward became historic. And when he returned to the  house, his mother handed him a little white envelope.    \"It came while you were out,\" she said.    He turned it over, and stared at his name written across the front in a  feminine hand In those days young ladies did not write in the bold and  masculine manner now deemed proper. Stephen stared at the note, manlike,  and pondered.    \"Who brought it, mother?\"    \"Why don't you open it, and see?\" asked his mother with a smile.    He took the suggestion. What a funny formal little note we should think  it now! It was not funny to Stephen--then. He read it, and he read it  again, and finally he walked over to the window, still holding it in his  hand.    Some mothers would have shown their curiosity. Mrs. Brice did not,  wherein she proved herself their superiors in the knowledge of mankind.    Stephen stood for a long while looking out into the gathering dusk. Then  he went over to the fireplace and began tearing the note into little  bits. Only once did he pause, to look again at his name on the envelope.    \"It is an invitation to Miss Carvel's party,\" he said.    By Thursday of that week the Brices, with thanksgiving in their hearts,  had taken possession of Mr. Brinsmade's little house.          CHAPTER XII. \"MISS JINNY\"    The years have sped indeed since that gray December when Miss Virginia  Carvel became eighteen. Old St. Louis has changed from a pleasant  Southern town to a bustling city, and a high building stands on the site  of that wide and hospitable home of Colonel Carvel. And the Colonel's  thoughts that morning, as Ned shaved him, flew back through the years to  a gently rolling Kentucky countryside, and a pillared white house among  the oaks. He was riding again with Beatrice Colfax in the springtime.  Again he stretched out his arm as if to seize her bridle-hand, and he  felt the thoroughbred rear. Then the vision faded, and the memory of his  dead wife became an angel's face, far--so far away.    He had brought her to St. Louis, and with his inheritance had founded  his business, and built the great double house on the corner. The child  came, and was named after the noble state which had given so many of her  sons to the service of the Republic.    Five simple, happy years--then war. A black war of conquest which,  like many such, was to add to the nation's fame and greatness: Glory  beckoned, honor called--or Comyn Carvel felt them. With nothing of the  profession of arms save that born in the Carvels, he kissed Beatrice  farewell and steamed down the Mississippi, a captain in Missouri  regiment. The young wife was ailing. Anguish killed her. Had Comyn  Carvel been selfish?    Ned, as he shaved his master's face, read his thoughts by the strange  sympathy of love. He had heard the last pitiful words of his mistress.  Had listened, choking, to Dr. Posthlewaite as he read the sublime  service of the burial of the dead. It was Ned who had met his master,  the Colonel, at the levee, and had fallen sobbing at his feet.    Long after he was shaved that morning, the Colonel sat rapt in his  chair, while the faithful servant busied himself about the room, one eye  on his master the while. But presently Mr. Carvel's revery is broken by  the swift rustle of a dress, and a girlish figure flutters in and plants  itself on the wide arm of his mahogany barber chair, Mammy Easter in the  door behind her. And the Colonel, stretching forth his hands, strains  her to him, and then holds her away that he may look and look again into  her face.    \"Honey,\" he said, \"I was thinking of your mother.\"    Virginia raised her eyes to the painting on the wall over the marble  mantel. The face under the heavy coils of brown hair was sweet and  gentle, delicately feminine. It had an expression of sorrow that seemed  a prophecy.    The Colonel's hand strayed upward to Virginia's head.    \"You are not like her, honey,\" he said: \"You may see for yourself. You  are more like your Aunt Bess, who lived in Baltimore, and she--\"    \"I know,\" said Virginia, \"she was the image of the beauty, Dorothy  Manners, who married my great-grandfather.\"    \"Yes, Jinny,\" replied the Colonel, smiling. \"That is so. You are  somewhat like your great-grandmother.\"    \"Somewhat!\" cried Virginia, putting her hand over his mouth, \"I like  that. You and Captain Lige are always afraid of turning my head. I need  not be a beauty to resemble her. I know that I am like her. When you  took me on to Calvert House to see Uncle Daniel that time, I remember  the picture by, by--\"    \"Sir Joshua Reynolds.\"    \"Yes, Sir Joshua.\"    \"You were only eleven,\" says the Colonel.    \"She is not a difficult person to remember.\"    \"No,\" said Mr. Carvel, laughing, \"especially if you have lived with  her.\"    \"Not that I wish to be that kind,\" said Virginia, meditatively,--\"to  take London by storm, and keep a man dangling for years.\"    \"But he got her in the end,\" said the Colonel. \"Where did you hear all  this?\" he asked.    \"Uncle Daniel told me. He has Richard Carvel's diary.\"    \"And a very honorable record it is,\" exclaimed the Colonel. \"Jinny,  we shall read it together when we go a-visiting to Culvert House. I  remember the old gentleman as well as if I had seen him yesterday.\"    Virginia appeared thoughtful.    \"Pa,\" she began, \"Pa, did you ever see the pearls Dorothy Carvel wore on  her wedding day? What makes you jump like that? Did you ever see them?\"    \"Well, I reckon I did,\" replied the Colonel, gazing at her steadfastly.    \"Pa, Uncle Daniel told me that I was to have that necklace when I was  old enough.\"    \"Law!\" said the Colonel, fidgeting, \"your Uncle Daniel was just fooling  you.\"    \"He's a bachelor,\" said Virginia; \"what use has he got for it?\"    \"Why,\" says the Colonel, \"he's a young man yet, your uncle, only  fifty-three. I've known older fools than he to go and do it. Eh, Ned?\"    \"Yes, marsa. Yes, suh. I've seed 'em at seventy, an' shufflin' about  peart as Marse Clarence's gamecocks. Why, dar was old Marse Ludlow--\"    \"Now, Mister Johnson,\" Virginia put in severely, \"no more about old  Ludlow.\"    Ned grinned from ear to ear, and in the ecstasy of his delight dropped  the Colonel's clothes-brush. \"Lan' sakes!\" he cried, \"ef she ain't  recommembered.\" Recovering his gravity and the brush simultaneously, he  made Virginia a low bow. \"Mornin', Miss Jinny. I sholy is gwinter s'lute  you dis day. May de good Lawd make you happy, Miss Jinny, an' give you a  good husban'--\"    \"Thank you, Mister Johnson, thank you,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54"],[0,"The Marvelous Land of Oz (#17)"],[1,"the Tin  Woodman to set Jack upon his feet.    \"How do you feel now?\" asked Tip, watching        189  the Pumpkinhead stump around to try his new leg.\"    As good as new\" answered Jack, Joyfully, \"and quite ready to assist you all  to escape.\"    \"Then let us get to work,\" said the Scarecrow, in a business-like tone.    So, glad to be doing anything that might lead to the end of their captivity,  the friends separated to wander over the palace in search of fitting  material to use in the construction of their aerial machine.                   Line-Art Drawing        190               Full page line-art drawing.        191               The Astonishing Flight of the Gump      When the adventurers reassembled upon the roof it was found that a  remarkably queer assortment of articles had been selected by the various  members of the party. No one seemed to have a very clear idea of what was  required, but all had brought something.    The Woggle-Bug had taken from its position over the mantle-piece in the  great hallway the head of a Gump, which was adorned with wide-spreading  antlers; and this, with great care and greater difficulty, the insect had  carried up the stairs to the roof. This Gump resembled an Elk's head, only  the nose turned upward in a saucy manner and there were whiskers        192  upon its chin, like those of a billy-goat. Why the Woggle-Bug selected this  article he could not have explained, except that it had aroused his  curiosity.    Tip, with the aid of the Saw-Horse, had brought a large, upholstered sofa to  the roof. It was an oldfashioned piece of furniture, with high back and  ends, and it was so heavy that even by resting the greatest weight upon the  back of the Saw-Horse, the boy found himself out of breath when at last the  clumsy sofa was dumped upon the roof.    The Pumpkinhead had brought a broom, which was the first thing he saw. The  Scarecrow arrived with a coil of clothes-lines and ropes which he had taken  from the courtyard, and in his trip up the stairs he had become so entangled  in the loose ends of the ropes that both he and his burden tumbled in a heap  upon the roof and might have rolled off if Tip had not rescued him.    The Tin Woodman appeared last. He also had been to the courtyard, where he  had cut four great, spreading leaves from a huge palm-tree that was the  pride of all the inhabitants of the Emerald City.    \"My dear Nick!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow, seeing what his friend had done;  \"you have been guilty of the greatest crime any person can commit in the  Emerald City. If I remember rightly, the        193               Full page line-art drawing.                   ALL BROUGHT SOMETHING TO THE ROOF.        194  penalty for chopping leaves from the royal palm-tree is to be killed seven  times and afterward imprisoned for life.\"    \"It cannot be helped now\" answered the Tin Woodman, throwing down the big  leaves upon the roof. \"But it may be one more reason why it is necessary for  us to escape. And now let us see what you have found for me to work with.\"    Many were the doubtful looks cast upon the heap of miscellaneous material  that now cluttered the roof, and finally the Scarecrow shook his head and  remarked:    \"Well, if friend Nick can manufacture, from this mess of rubbish, a Thing  that will fly through the air and carry us to safety, then I will  acknowledge him to be a better mechanic than I suspected.\"    But the Tin Woodman seemed at first by no means sure of his powers, and only  after polishing his forehead vigorously with the chamois-leather did he  resolve to undertake the task.    \"The first thing required for the machine,\" said he, \"is a body big enough  to carry the entire party. This sofa is the biggest thing we have, and might  be used for a body. But, should the machine ever tip sideways, we would all  slide off and fall to the ground.\"        195    \"Why not use two sofas?\" asked Tip. \"There's another one just like this down  stairs.\"    \"That is a very sensible suggestion,\" exclaimed the Tin Woodman. \"You must  fetch the other sofa at once.\"    So Tip and the Saw-Horse managed, with much labor, to get the second sofa to  the roof; and when the two were placed together, edge to edge, the backs and  ends formed a protecting rampart all around the seats.    \"Excellent!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"We can ride within this snug nest quite  at our ease.\"    The two sofas were now bound firmly together with ropes and clothes-lines,  and then Nick Chopper fastened the Gump's head to one end.    \"That will show which is the front end of the Thing,\" said he, greatly  pleased with the idea.\" And, really, if you examine it critically, the Gump  looks very well as a figure-head. These great palm-leaves, for which I have  endangered my life seven times, must serve us as wings.\"    \"Are they strong enough?\" asked the boy.    \"They are as strong as anything we can get,\" answered the Woodman; \"and  although they are not in proportion to the Thing's body, we are not in a  position to be very particular.\"        196    So he fastened the palm-leaves to the sofas, two on each side.    Said the Woggle-Bug, with considerable admiration:    \"The Thing is now complete, and only needs to be brought to life.\"    \"Stop a moment!\" exclaimed Jack.\" Are you not going to use my broom?\"    \"What for?\" asked the Scarecrow.    \"Why, it can be fastened to the back end for a tail,\" answered the  Pumpkinhead. \"Surely you would not call the Thing complete without a tail.\"    \"Hm!\" said the Tin Woodman, \"I do not see the use of a tail. We are not  trying to copy a beast, or a fish, or a bird. All we ask of the Thing is to  carry us through the air.    \"Perhaps, after the Thing is brought to life, it can use a tail to steer  with,\" suggested the Scarecrow. \"For if it flies through the air it will not  be unlike a bird, and I've noticed that all birds have tails, which they use  for a rudder while flying.\"    \"Very well,\" answered Nick, \"the broom shall be used for a tail,\" and he  fastened it firmly to the back end of the sofa body.    Tip took the pepper-box from his pocket.    \"The Thing looks very big,\" said he, anxiously;        197  \"and I am not sure there is enough powder left to bring all of it to life.  But I'll make it go as far as possible.\"    \"Put most on the wings,\" said Nick Chopper; \"for they must be made as strong  as possible.\"    \"And don't forget the head!\" exclaimed the Woggle-Bug.    \"Or the tail!\" added Jack Pumpkinhead.    \"Do be quiet,\" said Tip, nervously; \"you must give me a chance to work the  magic charm in the proper manner.\"    Very carefully he began sprinkling the Thing with the precious powder. Each  of the four wings was first lightly covered with a layer. then the sofas  were sprinkled, and the broom given a slight coating.    \"The head! The head! Don't, I beg of you, forget the head!\" cried the  Woggle-Bug, excitedly.    \"There's only a little of the powder left,\" announced Tip, looking within  the box.\" And it seems to me it is more important to bring the legs of the  sofas to life than the head.\"    \"Not so,\" decided the Scarecrow. \"Every thing must have a head to direct it;  and since this creature is to fly, and not walk, it is really unimportant  whether its legs are alive or not.\"    So Tip abided by this decision and sprinkled the Gump's head with the  remainder of the powder.        198    \"Now\" said he, \"keep silence while I work the, charm!\"    Having heard old Mombi pronounce the magic words, and having also succeeded  in bringing the Saw-Horse to life, Tip did not hesitate an instant in  speaking the three cabalistic words, each accompanied by the peculiar  gesture of the hands.    It was a grave and impressive ceremony.    As he finished the incantation the Thing shuddered throughout its huge bulk,  the Gump gave the screeching cry that is familiar to those animals, and then  the four wings began flopping furiously.    Tip managed to grasp a chimney, else he would have been blown off the roof  by the terrible breeze raised by the wings. The Scarecrow, being light in  weight, was caught up bodily and borne through the air until Tip luckily  seized him by one leg and held him fast. The Woggle-Bug lay flat upon the  roof and so escaped harm,                   Line-Art Drawing        199  and the Tin Woodman, whose weight of tin anchored him firmly, threw both  arms around Jack Pumpkinhead and managed to save him. The Saw-Horse toppled  over upon his back and lay with his legs waving helplessly above him.    And now, while all were struggling to recover themselves, the Thing rose  slowly from the roof and mounted into the air.    \"Here! Come back!\" cried Tip, in a frightened voice, as he clung to the  chimney with one hand and the Scarecrow with the other. \"Come back at once,  I command you!\"    It was now that the wisdom of the Scarecrow, in bringing the head of the  Thing to life instead of the legs, was proved beyond a doubt. For the Gump,  already high in the air, turned its head at Tip's command and gradually  circled around until it could view the roof of the palace.    \"Come back!\" shouted the boy, again.    And the Gump obeyed, slowly and gracefully waving its four wings in the air  until the Thing had settled once more upon the roof and become still.        200               Full page line-art drawing.        201               In the Jackdaw's Nest      \"This,\" said the Gump, in a squeaky voice not at all proportioned to the  size of its great body, \"is the most novel experience I ever heard of. The  last thing I remember distinctly is walking through the forest and hearing a  loud noise. Something probably killed me then, and it certainly ought to  have been the end of me. Yet here I am, alive again, with four monstrous  wings and a body which I venture to say would make any respectable animal or  fowl weep with shame to own. What does it all mean? Am I a Gump, or am I a  juggernaut?\" The creature, as it spoke,"]]]
