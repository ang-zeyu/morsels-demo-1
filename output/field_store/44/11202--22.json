But our New York office is meeting with difficulties. They  report there is a story current to the effect that we are going to  fail, and while that isn't so, you know how hard it is to borrow money  in the face of such rumors. We are doing all we can to fight them, of  course, and maybe we'll beat out our rivals yet.    \"But that isn't all. I'm sure some one is on the ground here trying to  make trouble among our workers. I never knew so many men to leave, one  after another. It's keeping the employment agency in Lima busy  supplying us with new workers. And so many of them are unskilled. They  aren't able to do half the work of the old men, and poor Tim Sullivan  is in despair.\"    \"You think some one here is causing dissensions and desertions among  your men?\"    \"I'm sure of it! I've tried to ferret out who it is, but the spy, for  such he must be, keeps his identity well hidden.\"    Tom thought for a moment. Then he said:    \"Mr. Titus, with your permission, I'll see if I can find out about this  for you.\"    \"Find out what, Tom?\"    \"What is causing the men to leave. I don't believe it's the scare about  the ten missing ones.\"    \"Nor do I. That's past and gone. But how are you going to get at the  bottom of it?\"    \"By keeping watch. I've got nothing to do now for the next week. We've  just set off a big blast, and I've got the powder for the following one  all ready. The men will be busy for some time getting out the broken  rock. Now what I propose to do is to go in the tunnel and work among  them until I can learn something.    \"I can understand the language pretty well now, though I can't speak  much of it. I'll go in the tunnel every day and find out what's going  on.\"    \"But you'll be known, and if one of our men, or one who we suppose is  one, turns out to be a spy, he'll be very cautious while you're in  there.\"    \"He won't know me,\" Tom said. \"This is how I'll work it.  I'll go off  with Professor Bumper the next time he starts on one of his weekly  expeditions into the woods. But I won't go far until I turn around and  come back. I'll adopt some sort of disguise, and I'll apply to you for  work. You can tell Tim to put me on. You might let him into the secret,  but no one else.\"    A few days later Tom was seen departing with Professor Bumper into the  interior, presumably to help look for the lost city. Mr. Damon was away  from camp on business connected with the drug concern, and Koku, to his  delight, had been given charge of a stationary hoisting engine outside  the tunnel, so he would not come in contact with Tom. It was not  thought wise to take the giant into the secret.    Then one day, shortly after Professor Bumper and Tom had disappeared  into the forest, a ragged and unkempt white man applied at the tunnel  camp for work. There was just the barest wink as he accosted Mr. Titus,  who winked in turn, and then the new man was handed over to Tim  Sullivan, as a sort of helper.    And so Tom Swift began his watch.          Chapter XVII    The Condor      Left to himself, with only the rather silent gang of Peruvian Indians  as company, Tom Swift looked about him.  There was not much active work  to be done, only to see that the Indians filled the dump cars evenly  full, so none of the broken rock would spill over the side and litter  the tramway. Then, too, he had to keep the Indians up to the mark  working, for these men were no different from any other, and they were  just as inclined to \"loaf on the job\" when the eye of the \"boss\" was  turned away.    They did not talk much, murmuring among themselves now and then, and  little of what they said was intelligible to Tom.  But he knew enough  of the language to give them orders, the main one of which was:    \"Hurry up!\"    Now, having seen to it that the gang of which he was in temporary  charge was busily engaged, Tom had a chance to look about him. The  tunnel was not new to him. Much of his time in the past month had been  spent in its black depths, illuminated, more or less, by the string of  incandescent lights.    \"What I want to find,\" mused Tom, as he walked to and fro, \"is the  place where those Indians disappeared. For I'm positive they got away  through some hole in this tunnel.  They never came out the main  entrance.\"    Tom held to this view in spite of the fact that nearly every one else  believed the contrary--that the men had left by the tunnel mouth, near  which Tom happened to be alone at the time.    Now, left to himself, with merely nominal duties, and so disguised that  none of the workmen would know him for the trim young inventor who  oversaw the preparing of the blast charges, Tom Swift walked to and  fro, looking for some carefully hidden passage or shaft by means of  which the men had got away.    \"For it must be well hidden to have escaped observation so long,\" Tom  decided.  \"And it must be a natural shaft, or hole, for we are boring  into native rock, and it isn't likely that these Indians ever tried to  make a tunnel here.  There must be some natural fissure communicating  with the outside of the mountain, in a place where no one would see the  men coming out.\"    But though Tom believed this it was another matter to demonstrate his  belief. In the intervals of seeing that the natives properly loaded the  dump cars, and removed as much of the debris as possible, Tom looked  carefully along the walls and roof of the tunnel thus far excavated.    There were cracks and fissures, it is true, but they were all  superficial ones, as Tom ascertained by poking a long pole up into them.    \"No getting out that way,\" he said, as he met with failure after  failure.    Once, while thus engaged, he saw Serato, the Indian foreman looking  narrowly at him, and Serato said something in his own language which  Tom could not understand. But just then along came Tim Sullivan, who,  grasping the situation, exclaimed:    \"Thot's all roight, now, Serri, me lad!\" for thus he contracted the  Indian's name. \"Thot's a new helper I have, a broth of a bye, an' yez  kin kape yer hands off him. He's takin' orders from me!\"    \"Um!\" grunted the Indian. \"Wha for he fish in tunnel roof?\" for Tom's  pole was one like those the Indians used when, on off days, they  emulated Izaak Walton.    \"Fishin' is it!\" exclaimed Tim. \"Begorra 'tis flyin' fish he's after  I'm thinkin'. Lave him alone though, Serri! I'm his boss!\"    \"Um!\" grunted the Indian again, as he moved off into the farther  darkness.    \"Be careful, Tom,\" whispered the Irishman, when the native had gone.  \"These black imps is mighty suspicious. Maybe thot fellah had a hand in  th' disappearances hisself.\"    \"Maybe,\" admitted Tom. \"He may get a percentage on all new hands that  are hired.\"    Tom kept on with his search, always hoping he might find some hidden  means of getting out of the tunnel. But as the days went by, and he  discovered nothing, he began to despair.    \"The queer thing about it,\" mused Tom, \"is what has become of the ten  men. Even if they did find some secret means of leaving, what has  become of them? They couldn't completely disappear, and they have  families and relatives that would make some sort of fuss if they were  out of sight completely this long. I wonder if any inquiries have been  made about them?\"    When Tom came off duty he asked the Titus brothers whether or not any  of the relatives of the missing men had come to seek news about them.  None had.    \"Then,\" said Tom, \"you can depend on it the men are all right, and  their relatives know it. I wonder how it would do to make inquiries at  that end? Question some of the relatives.\"    \"Bless my hat band!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, who was at the conference. \"I  never thought of that. I'll do it for you.\"    The odd man had gotten his quinine gathering business well under way  now, and he had some spare time. So, with an interpreter who could be  trusted, he went to the native village whence had come nearly all of  the ten missing men.  But though Mr. Damon found some of their  relatives, the latter, with shrugs of their shoulders, declared they  had seen nothing of the ones sought.    \"And they didn't seem to worry much, either,\" reported Mr. Damon.    \"Then we can depend on it,\" remarked Tom, \"that the men are all right  and their relatives know it. There's some conspiracy here.\"    So it seemed. But who was at the bottom of it?    \"I can't figure out where Blakeson & Grinder come in,\" said Job Titus.  \"They would have an object in crippling us, but they seem to be working  from the financial end, trying to make us fail there. I haven't seen  any of their sneaking agents around here lately, and as for Waddington  he seems to have stayed up North.\"    Tom resumed his vigil in the tunnel, poking here and there, but with  little success. His week was about up, and he would soon have to resume  his character as powder expert, for the debris was nearly all cleaned  up, and another blast would have to be fired shortly.    \"Well, I'm stumped!\" Tom admitted, the day when he was to come on duty  for the last time as a pretended foreman. \"I've hunted all over, and I  can't find any secret passage.\"    It was warm in the tunnel, and Tom, having seen one train of the dump  cars loaded, sat down to rest on an elevated ledge of rock, where he  had made a sort of easy chair for himself, with empty cement bags for  cushions.    The heat, his weariness and the monotonous clank-clank of a water pump  near by, and the equally monotonous thump of the lumps of rocks in the  cars made Tom drowsy. Almost before he knew it he was asleep.    What suddenly awakened him he could not tell. Perhaps it was some  influence on the brain cells, as when a vivid dream causes us to start  up from slumber, or it may have been a voice. For certainly Tom heard a  voice, he declared afterward.    As he roused up he found himself staring "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/954"],[0,"Tom Swift and His War Tank; Or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (#17)"],[1,"e,\" murmured Tom.    They turned to go back to the demolished structure, fear and worry in  their hearts. No more complete ruin could be imagined. If a cyclone had  swept over the barn it could not have more certainly leveled it. And,  not only was it leveled, crushed down in the center by the great weight  of the tank, but the boards and beams were broken into small pieces.  Parts of them clung in long, grotesque splinters to the endless steel  belts.    \"I don't see how we're going to find anybody if he's in there,\"  remarked Hank.    \"We'll have to,\" insisted Tom. \"We can look about and call. If any one  is there he may have been off to one side or to one end, and be  protected under the debris. I wish I had heard you call, Ned.\"    \"I wish you had, Tom. I yelled for all I was worth.\"    \"I know you did. I was too eager to go on, and, at the same time, I  really couldn't stop well on that hill. I had to keep on going. Well,  now to learn the worst!\"    They walked back toward the demolished barn. But they had not reached  it when from around the corner swung a big automobile. In it were  several men, but chief, in vision at least, among them, was a burly  farmer who had a long, old-fashioned gun in his hands. On his bearded  face was a grim look as he leaped out before the machine had fairly  stopped, and called:    \"Hold on, there! I guess you've done damage enough! Now you can pay for  it or take the consequences!\" And he motioned to Tom, Ned, and the  others to halt.          Chapter XVIII    Ready for France      Such was the reaction following the crashing through of the barn,  coupled with the sudden appearance of the men in the automobile and the  threat of the farmer, that, for the moment, Tom, Ned, or their  companions from the tank could say nothing. They just stood staring at  the farmer with the gun, while he grimly regarded them. It was Tom who  spoke first.    \"What's the idea?\" asked the young inventor. \"Why don't you want us to  look through the ruins?\"    \"You'll learn soon enough!\" was the grim answer.    But Tom was not to be put off with undecided talk.    \"If there's been an accident,\" he said, \"we're sorry for it. But delay  may be dangerous. If some one is hurt--\"    \"You'll be hurt, if I have my way about it!\" snapped the farmer, \"and  hurt in a place where it always tells. I mean your pocketbook! That's  the kind of a man I am--practical.\"    \"He means if we've killed or injured any one we'll have to pay  damages,\" whispered Ned to Tom. \"But don't agree to anything until you  see your lawyer. That's a hot one, though, trying to claim damages  before he knows who's hurt!\"    \"I've got to find out more about this,\" Tom answered. He started to  walk on.    \"No you don't!\" cried the farmer, with a snarl. \"As I said, you folks  has done damage enough with your threshing machine, or whatever you  call it. Now you've got to pay!\"    \"We are willing to,\" said Tom, as courteously as he could.  \"But first  we want to know who has been hurt, or possibly killed. Don't you think  it best to get them to a doctor, and then talk about money damages  later?\"    \"Doctor? Hurt?\" cried the farmer, the other men in the auto saying  nothing. \"Who said anything about that?\"    \"I thought,\" began Tom, \"that you--\"    \"I'm talkin' about damages to my barn!\" cried the farmer.  \"You had no  right to go smashing it up this way, and you've got to pay for it, or  my name ain't Amos Kanker!\"    \"Oh!\" and there was great relief in Tom's voice. \"Then we haven't  killed any one?\"    \"I don't know what you've done,\" answered the farmer, and his voice was  not a pleasant one. \"I'm sure I can't keep track of all your ructions.  All I know is that you've ruined my barn, and you've got to pay for it,  and pay good, too!\"    \"For that old ramshackle?\" cried Ned.    \"Hush!\" begged Tom, in a low voice. \"I'm willing to pay, Ned, for the  sake of having proved what my tank could do.  I'm only too glad to  learn no one was hurt. Was there?\" he asked, turning to the farmer.    \"Was there what?\"    \"Was there anybody in your barn?\"    \"Not as I knows on,\" was the grouchy answer. \"A man who saw your  machine coming thought she was headed for my building, and he run and  told me. Then some friends of mine brought me here in their machine. I  tell you I've got all the evidence I need ag'in you, an' I'm going to  have damages! That barn was worth three thousand dollars if it was  worth a cent, and--\"    \"This matter can easily be settled,\" said Tom, trying to keep his  temper. \"My name is Swift, and--\"    \"Don't get swift with me, that's all I ask!\" and the farmer laughed  grimly at his clumsy joke.    \"I'll do whatever is right,\" Tom said, with dignity. \"I live over near  Shopton, and if you want to send your lawyer to see mine, why--\"    \"I don't believe in lawyers!\" broke in the farmer. \"All they think of  is to get what they can for theirselves. And I can do that myself. I'll  get it out of you before you leave, or, anyhow, before you take your  contraption away,\" and he glanced at the tank.    The same suspicion came at once to Tom and Ned, and the latter gave  voice to it when he murmured in a low voice to his chum:    \"This is a frame-up--a scheme, Tom.  He doesn't care a rap for the  barn. It's some of that Blakeson's doing, to make trouble for you.\"    \"I believe you!\" agreed Tom. \"Now I know what to do.\"    He looked toward the collapsed barn, as if making a mental computation  of its value, and then turned toward the farmer.    \"I'm very sorry,\" said Tom, \"if I have caused any trouble.  I wanted to  test my machine out on a wooden structure, and I picked your barn. I  suppose I should have come to you first, but I did not want to waste  time. I saw the barn was of practically no value.\"    \"No value!\" broke in the farmer. \"Well, I'll show you, young man, that  you can't play fast and loose with other people's property and not  settle!\"    \"I'm perfectly willing to, Mr. Kanker. I could see that the barn was  almost ready to fall, and I had already determined, before sending my  tank through it, to pay the owner any reasonable sum. I am willing to  do that now.\"    \"Well, of course if you're so ready to do that,\" replied the farmer,  and Ned thought he caught a glance pass between him and one of the men  in the auto, \"if you're ready to do that, just hand over three thousand  dollars, and we'll call it a day's work. It's really worth more, but  I'll say three thousand for a quick settlement.\"    \"Why, this barn,\" cried Ned, \"isn't worth half that! I know something  about real estate values, for our bank makes loans on farms around  here--\"    \"Your bank ain't made me no loans, young man!\" snapped Mr. Kanker. \"I  don't need none. My place is free and clear! And three thousand dollars  is the price of my barn you've knocked to smithereens. If you don't  want to pay, I'll find a way to make you. And I'll hold you, or your  tank, as you call it, security for my damages! You can take your choice  about that.\"    \"You can't hold us!\" cried Tom. \"Such things aren't done here!\"    \"Well, then, I'll hold your tank!\" cried the farmer. \"I guess it'll  sell for pretty nigh onto what you owe me, though what it's good for I  can't see. So you pay me three thousand dollars or leave your machine  here as security.\"    \"That's the game!\" whispered Ned. \"There's some plot here.  They want  to get possession of your tank, Tom, and they've seized on this chance  to do it.\"    \"I believe you,\" agreed the young inventor. \"Well, they'll find that  two can play at that game. Mr. Kanker,\" he went on, \"it is out of the  question to claim your barn is worth three thousand dollars.\"    \"Oh, is it?\" sneered the farmer. \"Well, I didn't ask you to come here  and make kindling wood of it! That was your doings, and you've had your  fun out of it. Now you can pay the piper, and I'm here to make you  pay!\" And he brought the gun around in a menacing manner.    \"He's right, in a way,\" said Ned to his chum. \"We should have secured  his permission first. He's got us in a corner, and almost any jury of  farmers around here, after they heard the story of the smashed barn,  would give him heavy damages.  It isn't so much that the barn is worth  that as it is his property rights that we've violated. A farmer's barn  is his castle, so to speak.\"    \"I guess you're right,\" agreed Tom, with a rather rueful face. \"But I'm  not going to hand him over three thousand dollars. In fact, I haven't  that much with me.\"    \"Oh, well, I don't suppose he'd want it all in cash.\"    But, it appeared, that was just what the farmer wanted. He went over  all his arguments again, and it could not be denied that he had the law  on his side. As he rightly said, Tom could not expect to go about the  country, \"smashing up barns and such like,\" without being willing to  pay.    \"Well, what you going to do?\" asked the farmer at last. \"I can't stay  here all day. I've got work to do. I can't go around smashing barns. I  want three thousand dollars, or I'll hold your contraption for  security.\"    This last he announced with more conviction after he had had a talk  with one of the men in the automobile. And it was this consultation  that confirmed Tom and Ned in their belief that the whole thing was a  plot, growing out of Tom's rather reckless destruction of the barn; a  plot on the part of Blakeson and his gang. That they had so speedily  taken advantage of this situation carelessly given them was only  another evidence of how closely they were on Tom's trail.    \"That man who ran out of the barn must have been the same one who was  in the factory,\" whispered Ned to his chum. \"He probably saw us coming  this way and ran on ahead to have the farmer all primed in readiness.  Maybe he knew you had planned to ram the barn.\"    \"Maybe he did. I've had it in mind for some time, and spoken to some of  my men about it.\"    \"More traitors in camp, then, I'm afraid, Tom. We'll have to do some  more "]]]
