But now, if there  should be any general calamity, and the people should revolt from their  rulers, there is no remedy for reducing them to obedience by the laws.  And these are the particulars of the Lacedaemonian, the Cretan, and the  Carthaginian governments which seem worthy of commendation.          CHAPTER XII      Some of those persons who have written upon government had never any  share in public affairs, but always led a private life. Everything  worthy of notice in their works we have already spoke to. Others  were legislators, some in their own cities, others were employed in  regulating the governments of foreign states. Some of them only composed  a body of laws; others formed the constitution also, as Lycurgus; and  Solon, who did both. The Lacedaemonians have been already mentioned.  Some persons think that Solon was an excellent legislator, who could  dissolve a pure oligarchy, and save the people from that slavery which  hung over them, and establish the ancient democratic form of government  in his country; wherein every part of it was so framed as to be well  adapted to the whole. In the senate of Areopagus an oligarchy was  preserved; by the manner of electing their [1274a] magistrates, an  aristocracy; and in their courts of justice, a democracy.    Solon seems not to have altered the established form of government,  either with respect to the senate or the mode of electing their  magistrates; but to have raised the people to great consideration in the  state by allotting the supreme judicial department to them; and for this  some persons blame him, as having done what would soon overturn that  balance of power he intended to establish; for by trying all causes  whatsoever before the people, who were chosen by lot to determine them,  it was necessary to flatter a tyrannical populace who had got this  power; which contributed to bring the government to that pure democracy  it now is.    Both Ephialtes and Pericles abridged the power of the Areopagites, the  latter of whom introduced the method of paying those who attended  the courts of justice: and thus every one who aimed at being popular  proceeded increasing the power of the people to what we now see it. But  it is evident that this was not Solon's intention, but that it arose  from accident; for the people being the cause of the naval victory  over the Medes, assumed greatly upon it, and enlisted themselves  under factious demagogues, although opposed by the better part of the  citizens. He thought it indeed most necessary to entrust the people  with the choice of their magistrates and the power of calling them to  account; for without that they must have been slaves and enemies to the  other citizens: but he ordered them to elect those only who were persons  of good account and property, either out of those who were worth five  hundred medimns, or those who were called xeugitai, or those of the  third census, who were called horsemen.    As for those of the fourth, which consisted of mechanics, they were  incapable of any office. Zaleucus was the legislator of the Western  Locrians, as was Charondas, the Catanean, of his own cities, and those  also in Italy and Sicily which belonged to the Calcidians. Some persons  endeavour to prove that Onomacritus, the Locrian, was the first person  of note who drew up laws; and that he employed himself in that business  while he was at Crete, where he continued some time to learn the  prophetic art: and they say, that Thales was his companion; and that  Lycurgus and Zaleucus were the scholars of Thales, and Charondas of  Zaleucus; but those who advance this, advance what is repugnant to  chronology. Philolaus also, of the family of the Bacchiades, was a  Theban legislator. This man was very fond of Diocles, a victor in  the Olympic games, and when he left his country from a disgust at an  improper passion which his mother Alithoe had entertained for him, and  settled at Thebes, Philolaus followed him, where they both died, and  where they still show their tombs placed in view of each other, but so  disposed, that one of them looks towards Corinth, the other does not;  the reason they give for this is, that Diodes, from his detestation of  his mother's passion, would have his tomb so placed that no one could  see Corinth from it; but Philolaus chose that it might be seen from his:  and this was the cause of their living at Thebes. [1274b]    As Philolaus gave them laws concerning many other things, so did he upon  adoption, which they call adoptive laws; and this he in particular did  to preserve the number of families. Charondas did nothing new, except  in actions for perjury, which he was the first person who took into  particular consideration. He also drew up his laws with greater elegance  and accuracy than even any of our present legislators. Philolaus  introduced the law for the equal distribution of goods; Plato that for  the community of women, children, and goods, and also for public tables  for the women; and one concerning drunkenness, that they might observe  sobriety in their symposiums. He also made a law concerning their  warlike exercises; that they should acquire a habit of using both hands  alike, as it was necessary that one hand should be as useful as the  other.    As for Draco's laws, they were published when the government was already  established, and they have nothing particular in them worth mentioning,  except their severity on account of the enormity of their punishments.  Pittacus was the author of some laws, but never drew up any form of  government; one of which was this, that if a drunken man beat any person  he should be punished more than if he did it when sober; for as  people are more apt to be abusive when drunk than sober, he paid no  consideration to the excuse which drunkenness might claim, but regarded  only the common benefit. Andromadas Regmus was also a lawgiver to the  Thracian talcidians. There are some laws of his concerning murders and  heiresses extant, but these contain nothing that any one can say is new  and his own. And thus much for different sorts of governments, as well  those which really exist as those which different persons have proposed.          BOOK III          CHAPTER I      Every one who inquires into the nature of government, and what are its  different forms, should make this almost his first question, What is a  city? For upon this there is a dispute: for some persons say the city  did this or that, while others say, not the city, but the oligarchy,  or the tyranny. We see that the city is the only object which both the  politician and legislator have in view in all they do: but government  is a certain ordering of those who inhabit a city. As a city is a  collective body, and, like other wholes, composed of many parts, it is  evident our first inquiry must be, what a citizen is: for a city is a  certain number of citizens. So that we must consider whom we ought to  call citizen, and who is one; for this is often doubtful: for every one  will not allow that this character is applicable to the same person; for  that man who would be a citizen in a republic would very often not be  one in an oligarchy. We do not include in this inquiry many of those who  acquire this appellation out of the ordinary way, as honorary persons,  for instance, but those only who have a natural right to it.    Now it is not residence which constitutes a man a citizen; for in this  sojourners and slaves are upon an equality with him; nor will it be  sufficient for this purpose, that you have the privilege of the laws,  and may plead or be impleaded, for this all those of different nations,  between whom there is a mutual agreement for that purpose, are allowed;  although it very often happens, that sojourners have not a perfect right  therein without the protection of a patron, to whom they are obliged to  apply, which shows that their share in the community is incomplete. In  like manner, with respect to boys who are not yet enrolled, or old men  who are past war, we admit that they are in some respects citizens,  but not completely so, but with some exceptions, for these are not yet  arrived to years of maturity, and those are past service; nor is  there any difference between them. But what we mean is sufficiently  intelligible and clear, we want a complete citizen, one in whom there  is no deficiency to be corrected to make him so. As to those who are  banished, or infamous, there may be the same objections made and the  same answer given. There is nothing that more characterises a complete  citizen than having a share in the judicial and executive part of the  government.    With respect to offices, some are fixed to a particular time, so that  no person is, on any account, permitted to fill them twice; or else  not till some certain period has intervened; others are not fixed, as a  juryman's, and a member of the general assembly: but probably some one  may say these are not offices, nor have the citizens in these capacities  any share in the government; though surely it is ridiculous to say that  those who have the principal power in the state bear no office in it.  But this objection is of no weight, for it is only a dispute about  words; as there is no general term which can be applied both to the  office of a juryman and a member of the assembly. For the sake of  distinction, suppose we call it an indeterminate office: but I lay it  down as a maxim, that those are citizens who could exercise it. Such  then is the description of a citizen who comes nearest to what all those  who are called citizens are. Every one also should know, that of the  component parts of those things which differ from each other in species,  after the first or second remove, those which follow have either nothing  at all or very little common to each.    Now we see that governments differ from each other in their form,  and that some of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6764"],[0,"Army Life in a Black Regiment (#17)"],[1,"safe from further desecration, and then looked to see where we were.    We were now gliding past a safe reach of marsh, while our assailants  were riding by cross-paths to attack us at the next bluff. It was Reed's  Bluff where we were first attacked, and Scrubby Bluff, I think, was  next. They were shelled in advance, but swarmed manfully to the banks  again as we swept round one of the sharp angles of the stream beneath  their fire. My men were now pretty well imprisoned below in the hot and  crowded hold, and actually fought each other, the officers afterwards  said, for places at the open port-holes, from which to aim. Others  implored to be landed, exclaiming that they \"supposed de Cunnel knew  best,\" but it was \"mighty mean\" to be shut up down below, when they  might be \"fightin' de Secesh _in de clar field_.\" This clear field, and  no favor, was what they thenceforward sighed for. But in such difficult  navigation it would have been madness to think of landing, although one  daring Rebel actually sprang upon the large boat which we towed astern,  where he was shot down by one of our sergeants. This boat was soon after  swamped and abandoned, then taken and repaired by the Rebels at a later  date, and finally, by a piece of dramatic completeness, was seized by  a party of fugitive slaves, who escaped in it to our lines, and some of  whom enlisted in my own regiment.    It has always been rather a mystery to me why the Rebels did not fell  a few trees across the stream at some of the many sharp angles where we  might so easily have been thus imprisoned. This, however, they did  not attempt, and with the skilful pilotage of our trusty  Corporal,--philosophic as Socrates through all the din, and occasionally  relieving his mind by taking a shot with his rifle through the high  portholes of the pilot-house,--we glided safely on. The steamer did not  ground once on the descent, and the mate in command, Mr. Smith, did his  duty very well. The plank sheathing of the pilot-house was penetrated by  few bullets, though struck by so many outside that it was visited as a  curiosity after our return; and even among the gun-crews, though they  had no protection, not a man was hurt. As we approached some wooded  bluff, usually on the Georgia side, we could see galloping along the  hillside what seemed a regiment of mounted riflemen, and could see our  shell scatter them ere we approached. Shelling did not, however, prevent  a rather fierce fusilade from our old friends of Captain dark's company  at Waterman's Bluff, near Township Landing; but even this did no serious  damage, and this was the last.    It was of course impossible, while thus running the gauntlet, to put our  hostages ashore, and I could only explain to them that they must thank  their own friends for their inevitable detention. I was by no means  proud of their forlorn appearance, and besought Colonel Hawley to take  them off my hands; but he was sending no flags of truce at that time,  and liked their looks no better than I did. So I took them to Port  Royal, where they were afterwards sent safely across the lines. Our  men were pleased at taking them back with us, as they had already said,  regretfully, \"S'pose we leave dem Secesh at Fernandina, General Saxby  won't see 'em,\"--as if they were some new natural curiosity, which  indeed they were. One soldier further suggested the expediency of  keeping them permanently in camp, to be used as marks for the guns of  the relieved guard every morning. But this was rather an ebullition of  fancy than a sober proposition.    Against these levities I must put a piece of more tragic eloquence,  which I took down by night on the steamer's deck from the thrilling  harangue of Corporal Adam Allston, one of our most gifted prophets,  whose influence over the men was unbounded. \"When I heard,\" he said,  \"de bombshell a-screamin' troo de woods like de Judgment Day, I said to  myself, 'If my head was took off to-night, dey couldn't put my soul  in de torments, perceps [except] God was my enemy!' And when de  rifle-bullets came whizzin' across de deck, I cried aloud, 'God help my  congregation! Boys, load and fire!'\"    I must pass briefly over the few remaining days of our cruise. At  Fernandina we met the Planter, which had been successful on her separate  expedition, and had destroyed extensive salt-works at Crooked River,  under charge of the energetic Captain Trowbridge, efficiently aided by  Captain Rogers. Our commodities being in part delivered at Fernandina,  our decks being full, coal nearly out, and time up, we called once more  at St. Simon's Sound, bringing away the remainder of our railroad-iron,  with some which the naval officers had previously disinterred, and then  steamed back to Beaufort. Arriving there at sunrise (February 2, 1863),  I made my way with Dr. Rogers to General Saxton's bedroom, and laid  before him the keys and shackles of the slave-prison, with my report  of the good conduct of the men,--as Dr. Rogers remarked, a message from  heaven and another from hell.    Slight as this expedition now seems among the vast events of the war,  the future student of the newspapers of that day will find that it  occupied no little space in their columns, so intense was the interest  which then attached to the novel experiment of employing black troops.  So obvious, too, was the value, during this raid, of their local  knowledge and their enthusiasm, that it was impossible not to find in  its successes new suggestions for the war. Certainly I would not have  consented to repeat the enterprise with the bravest white troops,  leaving Corporal Sutton and his mates behind, for I should have expected  to fail. For a year after our raid the Upper St. Mary's remained  unvisited, till in 1864 the large force with which we held Florida  secured peace upon its banks; then Mrs. A. took the oath of allegiance,  the Government bought her remaining lumber, and the John Adams again  ascended with a detachment of my men under Lieutenant Parker, and  brought a portion of it to Fernandina. By a strange turn of fortune,  Corporal Sutton (now Sergeant) was at this time in jail at Hilton Head,  under sentence of court-martial for an alleged act of mutiny,--an affair  in which the general voice of our officers sustained him and condemned  his accusers, so that he soon received a full pardon, and was restored  in honor to his place in the regiment, which he has ever since held.    Nothing can ever exaggerate the fascinations of war, whether on the  largest or smallest scale. When we settled down into camp-life again, it  seemed like a butterfly's folding its wings to re-enter the chrysalis.  None of us could listen to the crack of a gun without recalling  instantly the sharp shots that spilled down from the bluffs of the  St. Mary's, or hear a sudden trampling of horsemen by night without  recalling the sounds which startled us on the Field of the Hundred  Pines. The memory of our raid was preserved in the camp by many legends  of adventure, growing vaster and more incredible as time wore on,--and  by the morning appeals to the surgeon of some veteran invalids, who  could now cut off all reproofs and suspicions with \"Doctor, I's been  a sickly pusson eber since de _expeditious_.\" But to me the most vivid  remembrancer was the flock of sheep which we had \"lifted.\" The Post  Quartermaster discreetly gave us the charge of them, and they rilled a  gap in the landscape and in the larder,--which last had before presented  one unvaried round of impenetrable beef. Mr. Obabiah Oldbuck, when he  decided to adopt a pastoral life, and assumed the provisional name of  Thyrsis, never looked upon his flocks and herds with more unalloyed  contentment than I upon that fleecy family. I had been familiar, in  Kansas, with the metaphor by which the sentiments of an owner were  credited to his property, and had heard of a proslavery colt and an  antislavery cow. The fact that these sheep were but recently converted  from \"Se-cesh\" sentiments was their crowning charm. Methought they  frisked and fattened in the joy of their deliverance from the shadow  of Mrs. A.'s slave-jail, and gladly contemplated translation into  mutton-broth for sick or wounded soldiers. The very slaves who once,  perchance, were sold at auction with yon aged patriarch of the flock,  had now asserted their humanity, and would devour him as hospital  rations. Meanwhile our shepherd bore a sharp bayonet without a crook,  and I felt myself a peer of Ulysses and Rob Roy,--those sheep-stealers  of less elevated aims,--when I met in my daily rides these wandering  trophies of our wider wanderings.        Chapter 4. Up the St. John's      There was not much stirring in the Department of the South early in  1863, and the St. Mary's expedition had afforded a new sensation. Of  course the few officers of colored troops, and a larger number who  wished to become such, were urgent for further experiments in the same  line; and the Florida tax-commissioners were urgent likewise. I well  remember the morning when, after some preliminary correspondence, I  steamed down from Beaufort, S. C., to Hilton Head, with General Saxton,  Judge S., and one or two others, to have an interview on the matter with  Major-General Hunter, then commanding the Department.    Hilton Head, in those days, seemed always like some foreign military  station in the tropics. The long, low, white buildings, with piazzas  and verandas on the water-side; the general impression of heat and  lassitude, existence appearing to pulsate only with the sea-breeze; the  sandy, almost impassable streets; and the firm, level beach, on which  everybody walked who could get there: all these suggested Jamaica or the  East Indies. Then the head-quarters at the end of the beach, the Zouave  sentinels, the successive anterooms, the lounging aids, the good-natured  and easy General,--easy by habit and energetic by impulse,--all"]]]
