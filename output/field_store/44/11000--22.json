[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4511"],[0,"The Life of the Bee (#17)"],[1," not       very clearly defined, with infallible precision.    The problem suggested to Koenig was put to another mathematician,  Cramer, whose solution came even closer to that of the bees, viz.,  109 deg 28 1/2' for the large angle, and 70 deg 31 1/2' for the  small.    {56}    I myself do not believe that the bees indulge in these abstruse  calculations; but, on the other hand, it seems equally impossible to  me that such astounding results can be due to chance alone, or to  the mere force of circumstance. The wasps, for instance, also build  combs with hexagonal cells, so that for them the problem was  identical, and they have solved it in a far less ingenious fashion.  Their combs have only one layer of cells, thus lacking the common  base that serves the bees for their two opposite layers. The wasps'  comb, therefore, is not only less regular, but also less  substantial; and so wastefully constructed that, besides loss of  material, they must sacrifice about a third of the available space  and a quarter of the energy they put forth. Again, we find that the  trigonae and meliponae, which are veritable and domesticated bees,  though of less advanced civilisation, erect only one row of  rearing-cells, and support their horizontal, superposed combs on  shapeless and costly columns of wax. Their provision-cells are  merely great pots, gathered together without any order; and, at the  point between the spheres where these might have intersected and  induced a profitable economy of space and material, the meliponae  clumsily insert a section of cells with flat walls. Indeed, to  compare one of their nests with the mathematical cities of our own  honey-flies, is like imagining a hamlet composed of primitive huts  side by side with a modern town; whose ruthless regularity is the  logical, though perhaps somewhat charmless, result of the genius of  man, that to-day, more fiercely than ever before, seeks to conquer  space, matter, and time.    {57}    There is a theory, originally propounded by Buffon and now revived,  which assumes that the bees have not the least intention of  constructing hexagons with a pyramidal base, but that their desire  is merely to contrive round cells in the wax; only, that as their  neighbours, and those at work on the opposite side of the comb, are  digging at the same moment and with the same intentions, the points  where the cells meet must of necessity become hexagonal. Besides, it  is said, this is precisely what happens to crystals, the scales of  certain kinds of fish, soap-bubbles, etc., as it happens in the  following experiment that Buffon suggested. \"If,\" he said, \"you fill  a dish with peas or any other cylindrical bean, pour as much water  into it as the space between the beans will allow, close it  carefully and then boil the water, you will find that all these  cylinders have become six-sided columns. And the reason is evident,  being indeed purely mechanical; each of the cylindrical beans tends,  as it swells, to occupy the utmost possible space within a given  space; wherefore it follows that the reciprocal compression compels  them all to become hexagonal. Similarly each bee seeks to occupy the  utmost possible space within a given space, with the necessary  result that, its body being cylindrical, the cells become hexagonal  for the same reason as before, viz., the working of reciprocal  obstacles.\"    {58}    These reciprocal obstacles, it would seem, are capable of marvellous  achievement; on the same principle, doubtless, that the vices of man  produce a general virtue, whereby the human race, hateful often in  its individuals, ceases to be so in the mass. We might reply, first  of all, with Brougham, Kirby and Spence, and others, that  experiments with peas and soap-bubbles prove nothing; for the reason  that in both cases the pressure produces only irregular forms, and  in no wise explains the existence of the prismatic base of the  cells. But above all we might answer that there are more ways than  one of dealing with rigid necessity; that the wasp, the humble-bee,  the trigonae and meliponae of Mexico and Brazil achieve very  different and manifestly inferior results, although the  circumstances, and their own intentions, are absolutely identical  with those of the bees. It might further be urged that if the bee's  cell does indeed follow the law that governs crystals, snow,  soap-bubbles, as well as Buffon's boiled peas, it also, through its  general symmetry, disposition in opposite layers, and angle of  inclination, obeys many other laws that are not to be found in  matter. May we not say, too, of man that all his genius is comprised  in his fashion of handling kindred necessities? And if it appear to  us that his manner of treating these is the best there can possibly  be, the reason only can lie in the absence of a judge superior to  ourselves. But it is well that argument should make way for fact;  and indeed, to the objection based on an experiment, the best reply  of all must be a counter-experiment.    In order to satisfy myself that hexagonal architecture truly was  written in the spirit of the bee, I cut off and removed one day a  disc of the size of a five-franc piece from the centre of a comb, at  a spot where there were both brood-cells and cells full of honey. I  cut into the circumference of this disc, at the intersecting point  of the pyramidal cells; inserted a piece of tin on the base of one  of these sections, shaped exactly to its dimensions, and possessed  of resistance sufficient to prevent the bees from bending or  twisting it. Then I replaced the slice of comb, duly furnished with  its slab of tin, on the spot whence I had removed it; so that, while  one side of the comb presented no abnormal feature, the damage  having been repaired, the other displayed a sort of deep cavity,  covering the space of about thirty cells, with the piece of tin as  its base. The bees were disconcerted at first; they flocked in  numbers to inspect and examine this curious chasm; day after day  they wandered agitatedly to and fro, apparently unable to form a  decision. But, as I fed them copiously every evening, there came a  moment when they had no more cells available for the storage of  provisions. Thereupon they probably summoned their great engineers,  distinguished sculptors, and wax-workers, and invited them to turn  this useless cavity to profitable account.    The wax-makers having gathered around and formed themselves into a  dense festoon, so that the necessary heat might be maintained, other  bees descended into the hole and proceeded solidly to attach the  metal, and connect it with the walls of adjacent cells, by means of  little waxen hooks which they distributed regularly over its  surface. In the upper semicircle of the disc they then began to  construct three or four cells, uniting these to the hooks. Each of  these transition, or accommodation, cells was more or less deformed  at the top, to allow of its being soldered to the adjoining cell on  the comb; but its lower portion already designed on the tin three  very clear angles, whence there ran three little straight lines that  correctly indicated the first half of the following cell.    After forty-eight hours, and notwithstanding the fact that only  three bees at a time were able to work in the cavity, the entire  surface of the tin was covered with outlined cells. These were less  regular, certainly, than those of an ordinary comb; wherefore the  queen, having inspected them, wisely declined to lay any eggs there,  for the generation that would have arisen therefrom would  necessarily have been deformed. Each cell, however, was a perfect  hexagon; nor did it contain a single crooked line, a single curved  figure or angle. And yet the ordinary conditions had all been  changed; the cells had neither been scooped out of a block,  according to Huber's description, nor had they been designed within  a waxen hood, and, from being circular at first, been subsequently  converted into hexagons by the pressure of adjoining cells, as  explained by Darwin. Neither could there be question here of  reciprocal obstacles, the cells having been formed one by one, and  their first lines traced on what practically was a bare table. It  would seem incontestable, therefore, that the hexagon is not merely  the result of mechanical necessities, but that it has its true place  in the plans, the experience, the intellect and will of the bee. I  may relate here another curious instance of the workers' sagacity:  the cells they built on the tin had no other base than the metal  itself. The engineers of the corps had evidently decided that the  tin could adequately retain the honey; and had considered that, the  substance being impermeable, they need not waste the material they  value so highly by covering the metal with a layer of wax. But, a  short time after, some drops of honey having been placed in two of  these cells, the bees discovered, in tasting it, that the contact of  the metal had a deteriorating effect. Thereupon they reconsidered  the matter, and covered over with wax the entire surface of the tin.    {59}    Were it our desire to throw light upon all the secrets of this  geometric architecture, we should have more than one curious  question still to consider; as for instance the shape of the first  cells, which, being attached to the roof, are modified in such a  manner as to touch the roof at the greatest possible number of  points.    The design of the principal thoroughfares is determined by the  parallelism of the combs; but we must admire the ingenious  construction of alleys and gangways through and around the comb, so  skilfully contrived as to provide short cuts in every direction and  prevent congestion of traffic, while ensuring free circulation of  air. And finally we should have to study the construction of  transition cells, wherein we see a unanimous instinct at work that  impels"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45149"],[0,"The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries Ancient and Modern (#17)"],[1,"1} heresy which proclaims the condemnation of innocent babes  who have not been sprinkled by man's assumed authority. In the justice  of God no soul shall be finally condemned under a law of which he has  had no chance to learn. True, eternal punishment has been decreed  as the lot of the wicked; but the real meaning of the punishment so  decreed has been made known by the Lord Himself.[5] Eternal punishment  is God's punishment; endless punishment is His; for \"Endless\" and  \"Eternal\" are among His names, and the words are descriptive of His  attributes. No soul will be punished for sin beyond the time requisite  to work the needed reformation and to vindicate justice, for which  ends alone punishment is imposed. And no one will be eligible to enter  any kingdom of glory in the abode of the blessed to which he is not  entitled through obedience to law.    It follows as a plain necessity that the Gospel must be proclaimed  in the spirit world; and that such ministry is provided for, the  scriptures abundantly prove. Peter, defining the mission of the  Redeemer, thus declares this solemn truth: \"For this cause was the  gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged  according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the  spirit.\"[6] As already shown, the inauguration of this work among  the dead was wrought by Christ in the interval between His death and  resurrection.    In his first epistle to the Saints in Corinth, Paul presents a brief  yet comprehensive treatment of the doctrine of the resurrection,--a  subject which at that time and among those to whom he wrote, had given  rise to much {92} contention and debate;[7] and, having shown that  through Christ the resurrection of the dead had been made possible, and  that in due course all mankind shall be redeemed from bodily death,  the apostle asks, \"Else what shall they do which are baptized for the  dead, if the dead rise not at all? why then are they baptized for the  dead?\"[8] As the question is put by way of finality and climax to the  preceding argument, it is evident that the subject so introduced was  no new or strange doctrine, but on the contrary, one with which the  people addressed must have been familiar, and which to them required  no argument. Baptism for the dead was, therefore, both known as a  principle and practised as an ordinance in apostolic times. That the  practise was continued in some form for a century or more after the  apostles had passed from the earth is evidenced by numerous passages in  the writings of the early Christian Fathers, and by later authorities  on ecclesiastical history.    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints proclaims the present  as the dispensation of the {93} fulness of times, in which shall be  gathered and re-established all the saving principles and essential  ordinances of earlier dispensations, and during which the great plan of  universal redemption shall be fully revealed. The Church, therefore,  provides for the actual work of baptism for the dead, and in the  temples of today this sacred labor is in uninterrupted progress.  As will be seen, each of the temples is provided with a baptismal  font, with every necessary provision for the administration of this  ordinance.[9]    The rite of water-baptism in behalf of the dead is followed by that  of the laying-on of hands for the bestowal of the Holy Ghost; and in  this as in the preceding, the dead person is represented by the living  proxy. The imposition of hands for the conferring of the gift of the  Holy Ghost constitutes the higher baptism of the Spirit required  alike of all, and includes the rite of confirmation by which the  person becomes a member of the Church of Christ. In all essentials  the ordinances of baptism and confirmation are identical, whether  administered to the living for themselves or as proxy for the dead. As  these ordinances are administered in existing temples it is required  that, beside the recorder and the officiating elder, two witnesses be  present, and that they attest the ceremony as duly performed.    ORDINATION AND ENDOWMENT    Water-baptism, and the higher baptism of the Spirit by the authorized  imposition of hands for the conferring of the Holy Ghost, constitute  the two fundamental ordinances of the Gospel. The repentant soul who  has thus {94} entered the Church of Christ may afterward attain to  position and authority in the Holy Priesthood--not as an earthly honor,  not as a title of personal aggrandizement, not as a symbol of power to  rule and possibly to oppress,--but as an endowment bespeaking authority  and the express responsibility to use that authority in the service of  his fellows and to the glory of God. In the temple service, the man  who appears as proxy for his dead relative must be ordained to the  Priesthood before he can pass beyond the baptismal font.    It is a precept of the Church that women of the Church share the  authority of the Priesthood with their husbands, actual or prospective;  and therefore women, whether taking the endowment for themselves or  for the dead, are not ordained to specific rank in the Priesthood.  Nevertheless there is no grade, rank, or phase of the temple endowment  to which women are not eligible on an equality with men. True, there  are certain of the higher ordinances to which an unmarried woman cannot  be admitted, but the rule is equally in force as to a bachelor. The  married state is regarded as sacred, sanctified, and holy in all temple  procedure; and within the House of the Lord the woman is the equal and  the help-meet of the man. In the privileges and blessings of that holy  place, the utterance of Paul is regarded as a scriptural decree in full  force and effect: \"Neither is the man without the woman, neither the  woman without the man, in the Lord.\"[10]    Faith and sincere repentance, followed first by water-baptism and  then by the laying-on of hands for the bestowal of the Holy Ghost,  are the prescribed means of {95} admission into the Church of Christ  and prospective salvation in the Kingdom of God. But there is a  distinction between salvation and exaltation. At this point it may be  well to consider this distinction, and to set forth the doctrines of  the restored Church as to the graded degrees of exaltation beyond the  grave.[11]    _Salvation and Exaltation:_--Some degree of salvation will come to all  who have not forfeited their right to it; exaltation is given to those  only who by active labors have won a claim to God's merciful liberality  by which it is bestowed. Of the saved, not all will be exalted to the  higher glories; rewards will not be bestowed in violation of justice;  punishments will not be meted out to the ignoring of mercy's claims.  No one can be admitted to any order of glory, in short, no soul can  be saved, until justice has been satisfied for violated law. In the  Kingdom of God there are numerous degrees of exaltation provided for  those who are worthy of them. The old idea, that in the hereafter there  will be but two places for the souls of mankind,--a heaven and a hell,  with the same glory in all parts of the one, and the same terrors  throughout the other,--is wholly untenable in the light of Divine  revelation.    _Degrees of Glory:_--That the privileges and glories of heaven are  graded to suit the various capacities of the blessed, is indicated in  Christ's teachings. To His apostles He said: \"In my Father's house  are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to  prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I  will come again, and receive you unto myself; that {96} where I am,  there ye may be also.\"[12] This declaration is supplemented by that of  Paul, who speaks of the graded glories of the resurrection as follows:        \"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the      glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is      another.        \"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and      another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another      star in glory.        \"So also is the resurrection of the dead.\"[13]    A fuller knowledge of this subject has been imparted in the present  dispensation. From a revelation given in 1832[14] we learn the  following: Three great kingdoms or degrees of glory are established  for the future habitation of the human race; these are known as the  Celestial, the Terrestrial, and the Telestial. Far below the last and  least of these, is the state of eternal punishment prepared for the  sons of perdition.    _The Celestial Glory_ is provided for those who merit the highest  honors of heaven; in the revelation referred to, we read of them:        \"They are they who received the testimony of Jesus, and believed      on his name and were baptized after the manner of his burial,      being buried in the water in his name, and this according to the      commandment which he has given, that by keeping the commandments      they might be washed and cleansed from all their sins, and receive      the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the hands of him who is      ordained and sealed unto this power, and who overcome by faith, and      are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds      forth {97} upon all those who are just and true. They are they who      are the Church of the First-born. They are they into whose hands      the Father has given all things--they are they who are Priests and      Kings, who have received of his fulness, and of his glory, and are      Priests of the Most High, after the order of Melchisedek, which was      after the order of Enoch, which was after the order of the Only      Begotten Son; wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even      the sons of God--wherefore all things are theirs, whether life or      death, or things present, or things to come, all are theirs and"]]]
