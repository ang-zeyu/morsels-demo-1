[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#17)"],[1,"a yeoman in Sherwood, or Nottinghamshire, for the matter of that,  even though he had no more fat about his bones than thou hast, good  master.\"    At this reply a great shout of laughter went up, and all looked at Robin  Hood, for each man knew that Little John spake of a certain fight that  happened between their master and himself, through which they first  became acquainted.    \"Nay,\" quoth Robin Hood, laughing louder than all. \"Heaven forbid that  I should doubt thee, for I care for no taste of thy staff myself, Little  John. I must needs own that there are those of my band can handle a  seven-foot staff more deftly than I; yet no man in all Nottinghamshire  can draw gray goose shaft with my fingers. Nevertheless, a journey to  Ancaster may not be ill for thee; so go thou, as I bid, and thou hadst  best go this very evening, for since thou hast abided at the Sheriff's  many know thy face, and if thou goest in broad daylight, thou mayst get  thyself into a coil with some of his worship's men-at-arms. Bide thou  here till I bring thee money to pay our good Hugh. I warrant he hath no  better customers in all Nottinghamshire than we.\" So saying, Robin left  them and entered the forest.    Not far from the trysting tree was a great rock in which a chamber  had been hewn, the entrance being barred by a massive oaken door two  palms'-breadth in thickness, studded about with spikes, and fastened  with a great padlock. This was the treasure house of the band, and  thither Robin Hood went and, unlocking the door, entered the chamber,  from which he brought forth a bag of gold which he gave to Little John,  to pay Hugh Longshanks withal, for the cloth of Lincoln green.    Then up got Little John, and, taking the bag of gold, which he thrust  into his bosom, he strapped a girdle about his loins, took a stout  pikestaff full seven feet long in his hand, and set forth upon his  journey.    So he strode whistling along the leafy forest path that led to Fosse  Way, turning neither to the right hand nor the left, until at last he  came to where the path branched, leading on the one hand onward to Fosse  Way, and on the other, as well Little John knew, to the merry Blue  Boar Inn. Here Little John suddenly ceased whistling and stopped in  the middle of the path. First he looked up and then he looked down, and  then, tilting his cap over one eye, he slowly scratched the back part of  his head. For thus it was: at the sight of these two roads, two voices  began to alarum within him, the one crying, \"There lies the road to  the Blue Boar Inn, a can of brown October, and a merry night with sweet  companions such as thou mayst find there;\" the other, \"There lies the  way to Ancaster and the duty thou art sent upon.\" Now the first of these  two voices was far the louder, for Little John had grown passing fond  of good living through abiding at the Sheriff's house; so, presently,  looking up into the blue sky, across which bright clouds were sailing  like silver boats, and swallows skimming in circling flight, quoth he,  \"I fear me it will rain this evening, so I'll e'en stop at the Blue Boar  till it passes by, for I know my good master would not have me wet to  the skin.\" So, without more ado, off he strode down the path that lay  the way of his likings. Now there was no sign of any foul weather, but  when one wishes to do a thing, as Little John did, one finds no lack of  reasons for the doing.    Four merry wags were at the Blue Boar Inn; a butcher, a beggar, and two  barefoot friars. Little John heard them singing from afar, as he walked  through the hush of the mellow twilight that was now falling over hill  and dale. Right glad were they to welcome such a merry blade as Little  John. Fresh cans of ale were brought, and with jest and song and merry  tales the hours slipped away on fleeting wings. None thought of time or  tide till the night was so far gone that Little John put by the thought  of setting forth upon his journey again that night, and so bided at the  Blue Boar Inn until the morrow.    Now it was an ill piece of luck for Little John that he left his duty  for his pleasure, and he paid a great score for it, as we are all apt to  do in the same case, as you shall see.    Up he rose at the dawn of the next day, and, taking his stout pikestaff  in his hand, he set forth upon his journey once more, as though he would  make up for lost time.    In the good town of Blyth there lived a stout tanner, celebrated far  and near for feats of strength and many tough bouts at wrestling and the  quarterstaff. For five years he had held the mid-country champion belt  for wrestling, till the great Adam o' Lincoln cast him in the ring and  broke one of his ribs; but at quarterstaff he had never yet met his  match in all the country about. Besides all this, he dearly loved the  longbow, and a sly jaunt in the forest when the moon was full and the  dun deer in season; so that the King's rangers kept a shrewd eye upon  him and his doings, for Arthur a Bland's house was apt to have aplenty  of meat in it that was more like venison than the law allowed.    Now Arthur had been to Nottingham Town the day before Little John set  forth on his errand, there to sell a halfscore of tanned cowhides. At  the dawn of the same day that Little John left the inn, he started from  Nottingham, homeward for Blyth. His way led, all in the dewy morn, past  the verge of Sherwood Forest, where the birds were welcoming the lovely  day with a great and merry jubilee. Across the Tanner's shoulders was  slung his stout quarterstaff, ever near enough to him to be gripped  quickly, and on his head was a cap of doubled cowhide, so tough that it  could hardly be cloven even by a broadsword.    \"Now,\" quoth Arthur a Bland to himself, when he had come to that part of  the road that cut through a corner of the forest, \"no doubt at this time  of year the dun deer are coming from the forest depths nigher to the  open meadow lands. Mayhap I may chance to catch a sight of the dainty  brown darlings thus early in the morn.\" For there was nothing he loved  better than to look upon a tripping herd of deer, even when he could  not tickle their ribs with a clothyard shaft. Accordingly, quitting the  path, he went peeping this way and that through the underbrush, spying  now here and now there, with all the wiles of a master of woodcraft, and  of one who had more than once donned a doublet of Lincoln green.    Now as Little John stepped blithely along, thinking of nothing but of  such things as the sweetness of the hawthorn buds that bedecked the  hedgerows, or gazing upward at the lark, that, springing from the dewy  grass, hung aloft on quivering wings in the yellow sunlight, pouring  forth its song that fell like a falling star from the sky, his luck led  him away from the highway, not far from the spot where Arthur a Bland  was peeping this way and that through the leaves of the thickets.  Hearing a rustling of the branches, Little John stopped and presently  caught sight of the brown cowhide cap of the Tanner moving among the  bushes.    \"I do much wonder,\" quoth Little John to himself, \"what yon knave is  after, that he should go thus peeping and peering about I verily believe  that yon scurvy varlet is no better than a thief, and cometh here after  our own and the good King's dun deer.\" For by much roving in the forest,  Little John had come to look upon all the deer in Sherwood as belonging  to Robin Hood and his band as much as to good King Harry. \"Nay,\" quoth  he again, after a time, \"this matter must e'en be looked into.\" So,  quitting the highroad, he also entered the thickets, and began spying  around after stout Arthur a Bland.    So for a long time they both of them went hunting about, Little John  after the Tanner, and the Tanner after the deer. At last Little John  trod upon a stick, which snapped under his foot, whereupon, hearing the  noise, the Tanner turned quickly and caught sight of the yeoman. Seeing  that the Tanner had spied him out, Little John put a bold face upon the  matter.    \"Hilloa,\" quoth he, \"what art thou doing here, thou naughty fellow? Who  art thou that comest ranging Sherwood's paths? In very sooth thou hast  an evil cast of countenance, and I do think, truly, that thou art no  better than a thief, and comest after our good King's deer.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth the Tanner boldly--for, though taken by surprise, he was  not a man to be frightened by big words--\"thou liest in thy teeth. I am  no thief, but an honest craftsman. As for my countenance, it is what  it is; and, for the matter of that, thine own is none too pretty, thou  saucy fellow.\"    \"Ha!\" quoth Little John in a great loud voice, \"wouldst thou give me  backtalk? Now I have a great part of a mind to crack thy pate for thee.  I would have thee know, fellow, that I am, as it were, one of the King's  foresters. Leastwise,\" muttered he to himself, \"I and my friends do take  good care of our good sovereign's deer.\"    \"I care not who thou art,\" answered the bold Tanner, \"and unless thou  hast many more of thy kind by thee, thou canst never make Arthur a Bland  cry 'A mercy.'\"    \"Is it so?\" cried Little John in a rage. \"Now, by my faith, thou saucy  rogue, thy tongue hath led thee into a pit thou wilt have a sorry time  getting out of; for I will give thee such a drubbing as ne'er hast thou  had in all thy life before. Take thy staff in thy hand, fellow, for I  will not smite an unarmed man.    \"Marry come up with a murrain!\" cried the Tanner, for he, too, had  talked himself into a fume. \"Big words ne'er killed so much as a mouse.  Who art thou that talkest so freely of cracking the head of Arthur a  Bland? If I do not tan thy hide this day as ne'er I tanned a calf's hide  in all my life before, split my staff into skewers for lamb's flesh and  call me no more brave man! Now look to thyself, fellow!\"    \"Stay!\" said Little John. \"Let us first measure our cudgels. I do reckon  my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965"],[0,"The Black Tulip (#17)"],[1,"r,  of an amphibious organisation, working with equal ardour at politics and  at tulips, which proves him to belong to the class of men most dangerous  to public tranquillity, and shows a certain, or rather a complete,  analogy between his character and that of those master minds of which  Tarquin the Elder and the Great Conde have been felicitously quoted as  examples.\"    The upshot of all these reasonings was, that his Highness the Prince  Stadtholder of Holland would feel infinitely obliged to the magistracy  of the Hague if they simplified for him the government of the Seven  Provinces by destroying even the least germ of conspiracy against his  authority.    This argument capped all the others, and, in order so much the more  effectually to destroy the germ of conspiracy, sentence of death was  unanimously pronounced against Cornelius van Baerle, as being  arraigned, and convicted, for having, under the innocent appearance of  a tulip-fancier, participated in the detestable intrigues and abominable  plots of the brothers De Witt against Dutch nationality and in their  secret relations with their French enemy.    A supplementary clause was tacked to the sentence, to the effect that  \"the aforesaid Cornelius van Baerle should be led from the prison of the  Buytenhof to the scaffold in the yard of the same name, where the public  executioner would cut off his head.\"    As this deliberation was a most serious affair, it lasted a full  half-hour, during which the prisoner was remanded to his cell.    There the Recorder of the States came to read the sentence to him.    Master Gryphus was detained in bed by the fever caused by the fracture  of his arm. His keys passed into the hands of one of his assistants.  Behind this turnkey, who introduced the Recorder, Rosa, the fair Frisian  maid, had slipped into the recess of the door, with a handkerchief to  her mouth to stifle her sobs.    Cornelius listened to the sentence with an expression rather of surprise  than sadness.    After the sentence was read, the Recorder asked him whether he had  anything to answer.    \"Indeed, I have not,\" he replied. \"Only I confess that, among all the  causes of death against which a cautious man may guard, I should never  have supposed this to be comprised.\"    On this answer, the Recorder saluted Van Baerle with all that  consideration which such functionaries generally bestow upon great  criminals of every sort.    But whilst he was about to withdraw, Cornelius asked, \"By the bye, Mr.  Recorder, what day is the thing--you know what I mean--to take place?\"    \"Why, to-day,\" answered the Recorder, a little surprised by the  self-possession of the condemned man.    A sob was heard behind the door, and Cornelius turned round to look from  whom it came; but Rosa, who had foreseen this movement, had fallen back.    \"And,\" continued Cornelius, \"what hour is appointed?\"    \"Twelve o'clock, sir.\"    \"Indeed,\" said Cornelius, \"I think I heard the clock strike ten about  twenty minutes ago; I have not much time to spare.\"    \"Indeed you have not, if you wish to make your peace with God,\" said  the Recorder, bowing to the ground. \"You may ask for any clergyman you  please.\"    Saying these words he went out backwards, and the assistant turnkey was  going to follow him, and to lock the door of Cornelius's cell, when a  white and trembling arm interposed between him and the heavy door.    Cornelius saw nothing but the golden brocade cap, tipped with lace, such  as the Frisian girls wore; he heard nothing but some one whispering into  the ear of the turnkey. But the latter put his heavy keys into the  white hand which was stretched out to receive them, and, descending  some steps, sat down on the staircase which was thus guarded above  by himself, and below by the dog. The head-dress turned round, and  Cornelius beheld the face of Rosa, blanched with grief, and her  beautiful eyes streaming with tears.    She went up to Cornelius, crossing her arms on her heaving breast.    \"Oh, sir, sir!\" she said, but sobs choked her utterance.    \"My good girl,\" Cornelius replied with emotion, \"what do you wish? I may  tell you that my time on earth is short.\"    \"I come to ask a favour of you,\" said Rosa, extending her arms partly  towards him and partly towards heaven.    \"Don't weep so, Rosa,\" said the prisoner, \"for your tears go much more  to my heart than my approaching fate, and you know, the less guilty a  prisoner is, the more it is his duty to die calmly, and even joyfully,  as he dies a martyr. Come, there's a dear, don't cry any more, and tell  me what you want, my pretty Rosa.\"    She fell on her knees. \"Forgive my father,\" she said.    \"Your father, your father!\" said Cornelius, astonished.    \"Yes, he has been so harsh to you; but it is his nature, he is so to  every one, and you are not the only one whom he has bullied.\"    \"He is punished, my dear Rosa, more than punished, by the accident that  has befallen him, and I forgive him.\"    \"I thank you, sir,\" said Rosa. \"And now tell me--oh, tell me--can I do  anything for you?\"    \"You can dry your beautiful eyes, my dear child,\" answered Cornelius,  with a good-tempered smile.    \"But what can I do for you,--for you I mean?\"    \"A man who has only one hour longer to live must be a great Sybarite  still to want anything, my dear Rosa.\"    \"The clergyman whom they have proposed to you?\"    \"I have worshipped God all my life, I have worshipped Him in His works,  and praised Him in His decrees. I am at peace with Him and do not wish  for a clergyman. The last thought which occupies my mind, however has  reference to the glory of the Almighty, and, indeed, my dear, I should  ask you to help me in carrying out this last thought.\"    \"Oh, Mynheer Cornelius, speak, speak!\" exclaimed Rosa, still bathed in  tears.    \"Give me your hand, and promise me not to laugh, my dear child.\"    \"Laugh,\" exclaimed Rosa, frantic with grief, \"laugh at this moment! do  you not see my tears?\"    \"Rosa, you are no stranger to me. I have not seen much of you, but that  little is enough to make me appreciate your character. I have never seen  a woman more fair or more pure than you are, and if from this moment I  take no more notice of you, forgive me; it is only because, on leaving  this world, I do not wish to have any further regret.\"    Rosa felt a shudder creeping over her frame, for, whilst the prisoner  pronounced these words, the belfry clock of the Buytenhof struck eleven.    Cornelius understood her. \"Yes, yes, let us make haste,\" he said, \"you  are right, Rosa.\"    Then, taking the paper with the three suckers from his breast, where he  had again put it, since he had no longer any fear of being searched,  he said: \"My dear girl, I have been very fond of flowers. That was at a  time when I did not know that there was anything else to be loved. Don't  blush, Rosa, nor turn away; and even if I were making you a declaration  of love, alas! poor dear, it would be of no more consequence. Down there  in the yard, there is an instrument of steel, which in sixty minutes  will put an end to my boldness. Well, Rosa, I loved flowers dearly, and  I have found, or at least I believe so, the secret of the great black  tulip, which it has been considered impossible to grow, and for which,  as you know, or may not know, a prize of a hundred thousand guilders  has been offered by the Horticultural Society of Haarlem. These hundred  thousand guilders--and Heaven knows I do not regret them--these hundred  thousand guilders I have here in this paper, for they are won by the  three bulbs wrapped up in it, which you may take, Rosa, as I make you a  present of them.\"    \"Mynheer Cornelius!\"    \"Yes, yes, Rosa, you may take them; you are not wronging any one, my  child. I am alone in this world; my parents are dead; I never had a  sister or a brother. I have never had a thought of loving any one with  what is called love, and if any one has loved me, I have not known it.  However, you see well, Rosa, that I am abandoned by everybody, as  in this sad hour you alone are with me in my prison, consoling and  assisting me.\"    \"But, sir, a hundred thousand guilders!\"    \"Well, let us talk seriously, my dear child: those hundred thousand  guilders will be a nice marriage portion, with your pretty face; you  shall have them, Rosa, dear Rosa, and I ask nothing in return but your  promise that you will marry a fine young man, whom you love, and who  will love you, as dearly as I loved my flowers. Don't interrupt me, Rosa  dear, I have only a few minutes more.\"    The poor girl was nearly choking with her sobs.    Cornelius took her by the hand.    \"Listen to me,\" he continued: \"I'll tell you how to manage it. Go to  Dort and ask Butruysheim, my gardener, for soil from my border number  six, fill a deep box with it, and plant in it these three bulbs. They  will flower next May, that is to say, in seven months; and, when you see  the flower forming on the stem, be careful at night to protect them  from the wind, and by day to screen them from the sun. They will flower  black, I am quite sure of it. You are then to apprise the President of  the Haarlem Society. He will cause the color of the flower to be proved  before a committee and these hundred thousand guilders will be paid to  you.\"    Rosa heaved a deep sigh.    \"And now,\" continued Cornelius,--wiping away a tear which was glistening  in his eye, and which was shed much more for that marvellous black  tulip which he was not to see than for the life which he was about to  lose,--\"I have no wish left, except that the tulip should be called Rosa  Barlaensis, that is to say, that its name should combine yours and mine;  and as, of course, you do not understand Latin, and might therefore  forget this name, try to get for me pencil and paper, that I may write  it down for you.\"    Rosa sobbed afresh, and handed to him a book, bound in shagreen, which  bore the initials C. W.    \"What is this?\" "]]]
