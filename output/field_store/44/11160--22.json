A  double line of sphinxes led to the only entrance, in front of which were  two obelisks and four colossal statues of Rameses II. Behind the first  gateway, or pylon came an open court surrounded by a portico upheld by  pillars. The second and third pylons were connected by a covered passage  leading into another open court. Lower rooms at the rear of the temple  contained the sanctuary of the god, which only the king and priests could  enter.]    THE HEBREW BIBLE    All these writings are so ancient that their very authors are forgotten.  The interest they excite is historical rather than literary. From Oriental  antiquity only one great work has reached us that still has power to move  the hearts of men--the Hebrew Bible.    EGYPTIAN ARCHITECTURE    Architecture, in Egypt, was the leading art. The Egyptians were the first  people who learned to raise buildings with vast halls supported by  ponderous columns. Their wealth and skill, however, were not lavished in  the erection of fine private mansions or splendid public buildings. The  characteristic works of Egyptian architecture are the tombs of the kings  and the temples of the gods. The picture of the great structure at Thebes,  which Rameses II completed, [17] will give some idea of an Egyptian temple  with its gateways, open courts, obelisks, and statues.    [Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN WOODEN STATUE, (Museum of Gizeh)  Found in a tomb near Memphis. The statue, which belongs to the age of the  pyramid kings, represents a bustling, active, middle-class official.]    ARCHITECTURE IN BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA    The architecture of Babylonia and Assyria was totally unlike that of  Egypt, because brick, and not stone, formed the chief building and Assyria  material. In Babylonia the temple was a solid, square tower, built on a  broad platform. It consisted usually of seven stages, which arose one  above the other to the top, where the shrine of the deity was placed. The  different stages were connected by an inclined ascent. The four sides of  the temple faced the cardinal points, and the several stages were  dedicated to the sun, moon, and five planets. In Assyria the  characteristic building was the palace. But the sun-dried bricks, of which  both temples and palaces were composed, lacked the durability of stone and  have long since dissolved into shapeless mounds.    EGYPTIAN SCULPTURE    The surviving examples of Egyptian sculpture consist of bas-reliefs and  figures in the round, carved from limestone and granite or cast in bronze.  Many of the statues appear to our eyes very stiff and ungraceful. The  sculptor never learned how to pose his figures easily or how to arrange  them in an artistic group. In spite of these defects some Egyptian statues  are wonderfully lifelike. [18]    [Illustration: AN ASSYRIAN PALACE (RESTORED)  The royal residence of Sargon II near Nineveh was placed upon a high  platform of brick masonry the top of which was gained by stairs and an  inclined roadway. The palace consisted of a series of one storied  rectangular halls and long corridors surrounding inner courts. They were  provided with imposing entrances flanked by colossal human headed bulls  representing guardian spirits. The entire building covered more than  twenty three acres and contained two hundred apartments. In the rear is  seen a temple tower.]    SCULPTURE IN BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA    Few examples have reached us of Babylonian and Assyrian sculpture in the  round. As in Egypt, the figures seem rigid and out of proportion. The  Assyrian bas-reliefs show a higher development of the artistic sense,  especially in the rendering of animals. The sculptures that deal with the  exploits of the kings in war and hunting often tell their story in so  graphic a way as to make up for the absence of written records.    ORIENTAL PAINTING    Painting in the ancient East did not reach the dignity of an independent  art. It was employed solely for decorative purposes. Bas-reliefs and wall  surfaces were often brightly colored, The artist had no knowledge of  perspective and drew all his figures in profile, without any distinction  of light and shade. Indeed, Oriental painting, as well as Oriental  sculpture, made small pretense to the beautiful. Beauty was born into the  world with the art of the Greeks.

SCIENCE AND EDUCATION    ARITHMETIC AND GEOMETRY    Conspicuous advance took place in the exact sciences. The leading  operations of arithmetic were known. A Babylonian tablet gives a table of  squares and cubes correctly calculated from 1 to 60. The number 12 was the  basis of all reckonings. The division of the circle into degrees, minutes,  and seconds (360Â°, 60', 60\") was an invention of the Babylonians which  illustrates this duodecimal system A start was made in geometry. One of  the oldest of Egyptian books contains a dozen geometrical problems. This  knowledge was afterwards developed into a true science by the Greeks.    ASTRONOMY    In both Egypt and Babylonia the cloudless skies and still, warm nights  early led to astronomical research. At a remote period, perhaps before  4000 B.C., the Egyptians framed a solar calendar, [19] consisting of  twelve months, each thirty days in length, with five extra days at the end  of the year. This calendar was taken over by the Romans, [20] who added  the system of leap years. The Babylonians made noteworthy progress in some  branches of astronomy. They were able to trace the course of the sun  through the twelve constellations of the zodiac and to distinguish five of  the planets from the fixed stars. The successful prediction of eclipses  formed another Babylonian achievement. Such astronomical discoveries must  have required much patient and accurate observation.    GEOGRAPHY    Geographical ideas for a long time were very crude. An ancient map,  scratched on clay, indicates that about eight centuries before Christ the  Babylonians had gained some knowledge, not only of their own land, but  even of regions beyond the Mediterranean. The chief increase in man's  knowledge of the world in ancient times was due to the Phoenicians. [21]    PRACTICAL SCIENCES    The skill of Oriental peoples as mechanics and engineers is proved by  their success as builders. The great pyramids exactly face the points of  the compass. The principle of the round arch was known in Babylonia at a  remote period The transportation of colossal stone monuments exhibits a  knowledge of the lever, pulley, and inclined plane. [22] Babylonian  inventions were the sundial and the water clock, the one to register the  passage of the hours by day, the other by night. The Egyptians and  Babylonians also made some progress in the practice of medicine.    [Illustration: A BABYLONIAN MAP OF THE WORLD  A tablet of dark brown clay, much injured, dating from the 8th or 7th  century B.C. The two large concentric circles indicate the ocean or, as it  is called in the cuneiform writing between the circles, the 'Briny Flood.'  Beyond the ocean are seven successive projections of land, represented by  triangles. Perhaps they refer to the countries existing beyond the Black  Sea and the Red Sea. The two parallel lines within the inner circle  represent the Euphrates. The little rings stand for the Babylonian cities  in this region.]    THE TEMPLE SCHOOL    The schools, in both Egypt and Babylonia, were attached to the temples and  were conducted by the priests. Writing was the chief subject of  instruction. It took many years of patient study to master the cuneiform  symbols or the even more difficult hieroglyphics. \"He who would excel in  the school of the scribes,\" ran an ancient maxim, \"must rise with the  dawn.\" Writing was learned by imitating the examples supplied in copy-  books. Some of the model letters studied by Egyptian boys of the twentieth  century B.C. have come down to us. Reading, too, was an art not easy to  learn. Dictionaries and grammars were written to aid the beginner. A  little instruction was also provided in counting and calculating.    [Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN SCRIBE (Louvre, Paris)]    THE SCRIBES    Having learned to read and write, the pupil was ready to enter on the  coveted career of a scribe. In a community where nearly every one was  illiterate, the scribes naturally held an honorable place. They conducted  the correspondence of the time. When a man wished to send a letter, he had  a scribe write it, signing it himself by affixing his seal. When he  received a letter, he usually employed a scribe to read it to him. The  scribes were also kept busy copying books on the papyrus paper or clay  tablets which served as writing materials.    THE TEMPLE LIBRARY    Every large city of Babylonia possessed a collection of books. Several of  the larger libraries have been discovered. At Nippur, in Babylonia, thirty  thousand clay tablets were found. Another great collection of books was  unearthed in a royal palace at Nineveh. This Assyrian library seems to  have been open for the general use of the king's subjects. The Egyptians  also had their libraries, usually as adjuncts to the temples, and hence  under priestly control.    WIDESPREAD POPULAR IGNORANCE    Learning and education were so closely limited to a few individuals that  the mass of the people were sunk in deepest ignorance. Men could not  pursue knowledge for themselves, but had to accept every thing on  authority. Hence the inhabitants of Oriental lands remained a conservative  folk, slow to abandon their time-honored beliefs and very unwilling to  adopt a new"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7965"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#17)"],[1,"eulogies said,--'O thou of long arms, thou hast  to-day rescued us, sunk in the deep mire of sorrow in the hand of  Jarasandha. Such an act of virtue by thee, O son of Devaki, assisted by  the might of Bhima and Arjuna, is most extraordinary. O Vishnu,  languishing as we all were in the terrible hill-fort of Jarasandha, it  was verily from sheer good fortune alone that thou hast rescued us, O  son of the Yadu race, and achieved thereby a remarkable reputation. O  tiger among men, we bow down to thee. O, command us what we shall do.  However difficult of accomplishment, thy command being made known to  us, O lord (Krishna), it will at once be accomplished by us.' Thus  addressed by the monarchs, the high-souled Hrishikesa gave them every  assurance and said,--'Yudhishthira is desirous of performing the  sacrifice of Rajasuya. That monarch, ever guided by virtue, is  solicitous of acquiring the imperial dignity. Having known this from me  assist ye him in his endeavours.' Then, O king, all those monarchs with  joyous hearts accepted the words of Krishna, saying,--'So be it!' And  saying this, those lords of earth made presents of jewels unto him of  the Dasarha race. And Govinda, moved by kindness towards them, took a  portion of those presents.    \"Then the son of Jarasandha, the high-souled Sahadeva, accompanied by  his relatives and the principal officers of state, and with his priest  in front came thither. And the prince, bending himself low and making  large presents of jewels and precious stones, worshipped Vasudeva, that  god among men. Then that best of men, Krishna, giving every assurance  unto the prince afflicted with fear, accepted those presents of his of  great value. And Krishna joyfully installed the prince there and then  in the sovereignty of Magadha. And the strong-armed and illustrious son  of Jarasandha, thus installed on the throne by those most exalted of  men and having obtained the friendship of Krishna and treated with  respect and kindness by the two sons of Pritha, re-entered the city of  his father. And that bull amongst men, Krishna, accompanied by the sons  of Pritha and graced with great good fortune, left the city of Magadha,  laden with numerous jewels. Accompanied by the two sons of Pandu,  Achyuta (Krishna) arrived at Indraprastha, and approaching Yudhishthira  joyfully addressing that monarch said,--'O best of kings, from good  fortune, the mighty Jarasandha hath been slain by Bhima, and the kings  confined (at Girivraja) have been all set free. From good fortune also,  these two, Bhima and Dhananjaya, are well and arrived, O Bharata, at  their own city unwounded.' Then Yudhishthira worshipped Krishna as he  deserved and embraced Bhima and Arjuna in joy. And the monarch who had  no enemy, having obtained victory through the agency of his brothers in  consequence of the death of Jarasandha, gave himself up to pleasure and  merriment with all his brothers. And the oldest son of Pandu  (Yudhisthira) together with his brothers approached the kings who had  come to Indraprastha and entertaining and worshipping them, each  according to his age, dismissed them all. Commanded by Yudhishthira  those kings with joyful hearts, set out for their respective countries  without loss of time, riding upon excellent vehicles. Thus, O king, did  that tiger among men, Janardana of great intelligence, caused his foe  Jarasandha to be slain through the instrumentality of the Pandavas.  And, O Bharata, that chastiser of all foes having thus caused  Jarasandha to be slain, took leave of Yudhishthira and Pritha, and  Draupadi and Subhadra, and Bhimasena and Arjuna and the twins Nakula  and Sahadeva. After taking leave of Dhananjaya also, he set out for his  own city (of Dwarka), riding upon that best of cars of celestial make,  possessed of the speed of the mind and given unto him by Yudhishthira,  filling the ten points of the horizon with the deep rattle of its  wheels. And, O bull of the Bharata race, just as Krishna was on the  point of setting out, the Pandavas with Yudhishthira at their head  walked round that tiger among men who was never fatigued with exertion.    \"And after the illustrious Krishna, the son of Devaki, had departed  (from Indraprastha) having acquired that great victory and having also  dispelled the fears of the kings, that feat, O Bharata, swelled the  fame of the Pandavas. And, O king, the Pandavas passed their days,  continuing to gladden the heart of Draupadi. And at that time, whatever  was proper and consistent with virtue, pleasure, and profit, continued  to be properly executed by king Yudhishthira in the exercise of his  duties of protecting his subjects.\"      SECTION XXV    (Digvijaya Parva)    Vaisampayana said,--\"Arjuna, having obtained that best of bows and that  couple of inexhaustible quivers and that car and flag-staff, as also  that assembly-house, addressing Yudhisthira said,--'Bow, weapons, great  energy, allies, territory, fame, army--those, O king, difficult of  acquisition however desirable, have all been obtained by me. I think,  therefore, that what should now be done is for the swelling up of our  treasury. I desire, O best of monarchs, to make the kings (of the  earth) pay tributes to us. I desire to set out, in an auspicious moment  of a holy day of the moon under a favourable constellation for the  conquest of the direction that is presided over by the Lord of  treasures (viz. the North).'\"    Vaisampayana continued,--\"King Yudhisthira the just, hearing these  words of Dhananjaya, replied unto him in a grave and collected tone,  saying,--'O bull of the Bharata race, set thou out, having made holy  Brahmanas utter benedictions on thee, to plunge thy enemies in sorrow  and to fill thy friend with joy. Victory, O son of Pritha, will surely  be thine, and thou wilt surely obtain thy desires fulfilled.'    \"Thus addressed, Arjuna, surrounded by a large host, set out in that  celestial car of wonderful achievements he had obtained from Agni. And  Bhimasena also, and those bull among men, the twins, dismissed with  affection by Yudhishthira the just set out, each at the head of a large  army. And Arjuna, the son of the chastiser of Paka then brought under  subjugation that direction (the North) which was presided over by the  Lord of treasures. And Bhimasena overcome by force the East and  Sahadeva the South, and Nakula, O king, acquainted with all the  weapons, conquered the West. Thus while his brothers were so employed,  the exalted king Yudishthira the just stayed within Khandavaprastha in  the enjoyment of great affluence in the midst of friends and relatives.\"    \"Bhagadatta, hearing this, said,--'O thou who hast Kunto for thy  mother, as thou art to me, so is Yudhishthira also. I shall do all  this. Tell me, what else I may do for thee.'\"      SECTION XXVI    Vaisampayana continued,--\"thus addressed, Dhananjaya replied unto  Bhagadatta, saying,--'If thou wilt give thy promise to do this, thou  hast done all I desire.' And having thus subjugated the king of  Pragjyotisha, Dhananjaya of long arms, the son of Kunti, then marched  towards the north--the direction presided over by the lord of  treasures. That bull amongst men, that son of Kunti, then conquered the  mountainous tracts and their outskirts, as also the hilly regions. And  having conquered all the mountains and the kings that reigned there,  and bringing them under his sway, he exacted tributes from all. And  winning the affections of those kings and uniting himself with them, he  next marched, O king, against Vrihanta, the king of Uluka, making this  earth tremble with the sound of his drums, the clatter of his  chariot-wheels, and the roar of the elephants in his train. Vrihanta,  however, quickly coming out of his city followed by his army consisting  of four kinds of troops, gave battle to Falguna (Arjuna). And the fight  that took place between Vrihanta and Dhananjaya was terrible. It so  happened that Vrihanta was unable to bear the prowess of the son of  Pandu. Then that invincible king of the mountainous region regarding  the son of Kunti irresistible, approached him with all his wealth.  Arjuna snatched out the kingdom from Vrihanta, but having made peace  with him marched, accompanied by that king, against Senavindu whom he  soon expelled from his kingdom. After this he subjugated Modapura,  Vamadeva, Sudaman, Susankula, the Northern Ulukas, and the kings of  those countries and peoples. Hereafter at the command of Yudhishthira,  O monarch, Arjuna did not move from the city of Senavindu but sent his  troops only and brought under his sway those five countries and  peoples. For Arjuna, having arrived at Devaprastha, the city of  Senavindu, took up his quarters there with his army consisting of four  kinds of forces. Thence, surrounded by the kings and the peoples he had  subjugated, the hero marched against king Viswagaswa--that bull of  Puru's race. Having vanquished in battle the brave mountaineers, who  were all great warriors, the son of Pandu, O king, then occupied with  the help of his troops, the town protected by the Puru king. Having  vanquished in battle the Puru king, as also the robber tribes of the  mountains, the son of Pandu brought under his sway the seven tribes  called Utsava-sanketa. That bull of the Kshatriya race then defeated  the brave Kshatriyas of Kashmira and also king Lohita along with ten  minor chiefs. Then the Trigartas, the Daravas, the Kokonadas, and  various other Kshatriyas, O king, advanced against the son of Pandu.  That Prince of the Kuru race then took the delightful town of Avisari,  and then brought under his sway Rochamana ruling in Uraga. Then the son  of Indra (Arjuna), putting forth his might, pressed the delightful town  of Singhapura that was well-protected with various weapons. Then  Arjuna, that bull amongst the son of Pandu, at the head of all his  troops, fiercely attacked the regions called Suhma and Sumala. Then the  son"]]]
