As she descends the  stairs in her black velvet dress with its large collar of ermine and  with a diadem of white roses on her hair, she is literally stunning.  I open the carriage-door, and help her in. In front of the theater  I leap from the driver's seat, and in alighting she leaned on my arm,  which trembled under the sweet burden. I open the door of her box,  and then wait in the vestibule. The performance lasts four hours; she  receives visits from her cavaliers, the while I grit my teeth with  rage.    It is way beyond midnight when my mistress's bell sounds for the  last time.    \"Fire!\" she orders abruptly, and when the fire-place crackles, \"Tea!\"    When I return with the samovar, she has already undressed, and with  the aid of the negress slipped into a white negligee.    Haydee thereupon leaves.    \"Hand me the sleeping-furs,\" says Wanda, sleepily stretching her  lovely limbs. I take them from the arm-chair, and hold them while she  slowly and lazily slides into the sleeves. She then throws herself  down on the cushions of the ottoman.    \"Take off my shoes, and put on my velvet slippers.\"    I kneel down and tug at the little shoe which resists my efforts.  \"Hurry, hurry!\" Wanda exclaims, \"you are hurting me! just you wait--I  will teach you.\" She strikes me with the whip, but now the shoe is  off.    \"Now get out!\" Still a kick--and then I can go to bed.           *       *       *       *       *    To-night I accompanied her to a soiree. In the entrance-hall she  ordered me to help her out of her furs; then with a proud smile,  confident of victory, she entered the brilliantly illuminated room.  I again waited with gloomy and monotonous thoughts, watching hour after  hour run by. From time to time the sounds of music reached me, when  the door remained open for a moment. Several servants tried to start  a conversation with me, but soon desisted, since I knew only a few  words of Italian.    Finally I fell asleep, and dreamed that I murdered Wanda in a  violent attack of jealousy. I was condemned to death, and saw myself  strapped on the board; the knife fell, I felt it on my neck, but I  was still alive--    Then the executioner slapped my face.    No, it wasn't the executioner; it was Wanda who stood wrathfully  before me demanding her furs. I am at her side in a moment, and help  her on with it.    There is a deep joy in wrapping a beautiful woman into her furs, and  in seeing and feeling how her neck and magnificent limbs nestle in  the precious soft furs, and to lift the flowing hair over the collar.  When she throws it off a soft warmth and a faint fragrance of her  body still clings to the ends of the hairs of sable. It is enough to  drive one mad.           *       *       *       *       *    Finally a day came when there were neither guests, nor theater, nor  other company. I breathed a sigh of relief. Wanda sat in the gallery,  reading, and apparently had no orders for me. At dusk when the  silvery evening mists fell she withdrew. I served her at dinner, she  ate by herself, but had not a look, not a syllable for me, not even  a slap in the face.    I actually desire a slap from her hand. Tears fill my eyes, and I  feel that she has humiliated me so deeply, that she doesn't even find  it worth while to torture or maltreat me any further.    Before she goes to bed, her bell calls me.    \"You will sleep here to-night, I had horrible dreams last night, and  am afraid of being alone. Take one of the cushions from the ottoman,  and lie down on the bearskin at my feet.\"    Then Wanda put out the lights. The only illumination in the room was  from a small lamp suspended from the ceiling. She herself got into  bed. \"Don't stir, so as not to wake me.\"    I did as she had commanded, but could not fall asleep for a long  time. I saw the beautiful woman, beautiful as a goddess, lying on her  back on the dark sleeping-furs; her arms beneath her neck, with a  flood of red hair over them. I heard her magnificent breast rise in  deep regular breathing, and whenever she moved ever so slightly. I  woke up and listened to see whether she needed me.    But she did not require me.    No task was required of me; I meant no more to her than a night-lamp, or  a revolver which one places under one's pillow.           *       *       *       *       *    Am I mad or is she? Does all this arise out of an inventive, wanton  woman's brain with the intention of surpassing my supersensual  fantasies, or is this woman really one of those Neronian characters  who take a diabolical pleasure in treading underfoot, like a worm,  human beings, who have thoughts and feelings and a will like theirs?    What have I experienced?    When I knelt with the coffee-tray beside her bed, Wanda suddenly  placed her hand on my shoulder and her eyes plunged deep into mine.    \"What beautiful eyes you have,\" she said softly, \"and especially now  since you suffer. Are you very unhappy?\"    I bowed my head, and kept silent.    \"Severin, do you still love me,\" she suddenly exclaimed  passionately, \"can you still love me?\"    She drew me close with such vehemence that the coffee-tray upset,  the can and cups fell to the floor, and the coffee ran over the  carpet.    \"Wanda--my Wanda,\" I cried out and held her passionately against me;  I covered her mouth, face, and breast with kisses.    \"It is my unhappiness that I love you more and more madly the worse  you treat me, the more frequently you betray me. Oh, I shall die of  pain and love and jealousy.\"    \"But I haven't betrayed you, as yet, Severin,\" replied Wanda smiling.    \"Not? Wanda! Don't jest so mercilessly with me,\" I cried. \"Haven't  I myself taken the letter to the Prince--\"    \"Of course, it was an invitation for luncheon.\"    \"You have, since we have been in Florence--\"    \"I have been absolutely faithful to you,\" replied Wanda, \"I swear it  by all that is holy to me. All that I have done was merely to fulfill  your dream and it was done for your sake.    \"However, I shall take a lover, otherwise things will be only half  accomplished, and in the end you will yet reproach me with not having  treated you cruelly enough, my dear beautiful slave! But to-day you  shall be Severin again, the only one I love. I haven't given away  your clothes. They are here in the chest. Go and dress as you used  to in the little Carpathian health-resort when our love was so intimate.  Forget everything that has happened since; oh, you will forget it  easily in my arms; I shall kiss away all your sorrows.\"    She began to treat me tenderly like a child, to kiss me and caress  me. Finally she said with a gracious smile, \"Go now and dress, I too  will dress. Shall I put on my fur-jacket? Oh yes, I know, now run  along!\"    When I returned she was standing in the center of the room in her  white satin dress, and the red _kazabaika_ edged with ermine; her hair  was white with powder and over her forehead she wore a small diamond  diadem. For a moment she reminded me in an uncanny way of Catherine  the Second, but she did not give me much time for reminiscences. She  drew me down on the ottoman beside her and we enjoyed two blissful  hours. She was no longer the stern capricious mistress, she was  entirely a fine lady, a tender sweetheart. She showed me photographs  and books which had just appeared, and talked about them with so much  intelligence, clarity, and good taste, that I more than once carried  her hand to my lips, enraptured. She then had me recite several of  Lermontov's poems, and when I was all afire with enthusiasm, she  placed her small hand gently on mine. Her expression was soft, and her  eyes were filled with tender pleasure.    \"Are you happy?\"    \"Not yet.\"    She then leaned back on the cushions, and slowly opened her  _kazabaika_.    But I quickly covered the half-bared breast again with the ermine.  \"You are driving me mad.\" I stammered.    \"Come!\"    I was already lying in her arms, and like a serpent she was kissing  me with her tongue, when again she whispered, \"Are you happy?\"    \"Infinitely!\" I exclaimed.    She laughed aloud. It was an evil, shrill laugh which made cold  shivers run down by back.    \"You used to dream of being the slave, the plaything of a beautiful  woman, and now you imagine you are a free human being, a man, my  lover-you fool! A sign from me, and you are a slave again. Down on  your knees!\"    I sank down from the ottoman to her feet, but my eye still clung  doubtingly on hers.    \"You can't believe it,\" she said, looking at me with her arms folded  across her breast. \"I am bored, and you will just do to while away  a couple of hours of time. Don't look at me that way--\"    She kicked me with her foot.    \"You are just what I want, a human being, a thing, an animal--\"    She rang. The three negresses entered.    \"Tie his hands behind his back.\"    I remained kneeling and unresistingly let them do this. They led me  into the garden, down to the little vineyard, which forms the  southern boundary. Corn had been planted between the espaliers, and  here and there a few dead stalks still stood. To one side was a  plough.    The negresses tied me to a post, and amused themselves sticking me  with their golden hair-needles. But this did not last long, before  Wanda appeared with her ermine cap on her head, and with her hands  in the pockets of her jacket. She had me untied, and then my hands  were fastened together on my back. She finally had a yoke put around  my neck, and harnessed me to the plough.    Then her black demons drove me out into the field. One of them held  the plough, the other one led me by a line, the third applied the  whip, and Venus in Furs stood to one side and looked on.           *       *       *       *       *    When I was serving dinner on the following day Wanda said: \"Bring  another cover, I want you to dine with me to-day,\" and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],[0,"The Head of Kay's (#17)"],[1,"of its geography, it  was a perfect maze.    Fenn had wandered some way when the sound of someone whistling a  popular music-hall song came to him through the gloom. He had never  heard anything more agreeable.    \"I say,\" he shouted at a venture, \"can you tell me the way to the High  Street?\"    The whistler stopped in the middle of a bar, and presently Fenn saw a  figure sidling towards him in what struck him as a particularly  furtive manner.    \"Wot's thet, gav'nor?\"    \"Can you tell me where the High Street is? I've lost my way.\"    The vague figure came closer.    \"'Igh Street? Yus; yer go--\"    A hand shot out, Fenn felt a sharp wrench in the region of his  waistcoat, and a moment later the stranger had vanished into the fog  with the prefect's watch and chain.    Fenn forgot his desire to return to the High Street. He forgot  everything except that he wished to catch the fugitive, maltreat him,  and retrieve his property. He tore in the direction whence came the  patter of retreating foot-steps.    There were moments when he thought he had him, when he could hear the  sound of his breathing. But the fog was against him. Just as he was  almost on his man's heels, the fugitive turned sharply into a street  which was moderately well lighted. Fenn turned after him. He had just  time to recognise the street as his goal, the High Street, when  somebody, walking unexpectedly out of the corner house, stood directly  in his path. Fenn could not stop himself. He charged the man squarely,  clutched him to save himself, and they fell in a heap on the pavement.          XVI    WHAT HAPPENED TO FENN      Fenn was up first. Many years' experience of being tackled at full  speed on the football field had taught him how to fall. The stranger,  whose football days, if he had ever had any, were long past, had gone  down with a crash, and remained on the pavement, motionless. Fenn was  conscious of an ignoble impulse to fly without stopping to chat about  the matter. Then he was seized with a gruesome fear that he had  injured the man seriously, which vanished when the stranger sat up.  His first words were hardly of the sort that one would listen to from  choice. His first printable expression, which did not escape him until  he had been speaking some time, was in the nature of an official  bulletin.    \"You've broken my neck,\" said he.    Fenn renewed his apologies and explanations.    \"Your watch!\" cried the man in a high, cracked voice. \"Don't stand  there talking about your watch, but help me up. What do I care about  your watch? Why don't you look where you are going to? Now then, now  then, don't hoist me as if I were a hod of bricks. That's right. Now  help me indoors, and go away.\"    Fenn supported him while he walked lamely into the house. He was  relieved to find that there was nothing more the matter with him than  a shaking and a few bruises.    \"Door on the left,\" said the injured one.    Fenn led him down the passage and into a small sitting-room. The gas  was lit, and as he turned it up he saw that the stranger was a man  well advanced in years. He had grey hair that was almost white. His  face was not a pleasant one. It was a mass of lines and wrinkles from  which a physiognomist would have deduced uncomplimentary conclusions  as to his character. Fenn had little skill in that way, but he felt  that for some reason he disliked the man, whose eyes, which were small  and extraordinarily bright, gave rather an eerie look to his face.    \"Go away, go away,\" he kept repeating savagely from his post on the  shabby sofa on which Fenn had deposited him.    \"But are you all right? Can't I get you something?\" asked the  Eckletonian.    \"Go away, go away,\" repeated the man.    Conversation on these lines could never be really attractive. Fenn  turned to go. As he closed the door and began to feel his way along  the dark passage, he heard the key turn in the lock behind him. The  man could not, he felt, have been very badly hurt if he were able to  get across the room so quickly. The thought relieved him somewhat.  Nobody likes to have the maiming even of the most complete stranger on  his mind. The sensation of relief lasted possibly three seconds. Then  it flashed upon him that in the excitement of the late interview he  had forgotten his cap. That damaging piece of evidence lay on the  table in the sitting-room, and between him and it was a locked door.    He groped his way back, and knocked. No sound came from the room.    \"I say,\" he cried, \"you might let me have my cap. I left it on the  table.\"    No reply.    Fenn half thought of making a violent assault on the door. He  refrained on reflecting that it would be useless. If he could break it  open--which, in all probability, he could not--there would be trouble  such as he had never come across in his life. He was not sure it would  not be an offence for which he would be rendered liable to fine or  imprisonment. At any rate, it would mean the certain detection of his  visit to the town. So he gave the thing up, resolving to return on the  morrow and reopen negotiations. For the present, what he had to do was  to get safely back to his house. He had lost his watch, his cap with  his name in it was in the hands of an evil old man who evidently bore  him a grudge, and he had to run the gauntlet of three house-masters  and get to bed _via_ a study-window. Few people, even after the  dullest of plays, have returned from the theatre so disgusted with  everything as did Fenn. Reviewing the situation as he ran with long,  easy strides over the road that led to Kay's, he found it devoid of  any kind of comfort. Unless his mission in quest of the cap should  prove successful, he was in a tight place.    It is just as well that the gift of second sight is accorded to but  few. If Fenn could have known at this point that his adventures were  only beginning, that what had taken place already was but as the  overture to a drama, it is possible that he would have thrown up the  sponge for good and all, entered Kay's by way of the front door--after  knocking up the entire household--and remarked, in answer to his  house-master's excited questions, \"Enough! Enough! I am a victim of  Fate, a Toad beneath the Harrow. Sack me tomorrow, if you like, but  for goodness' sake let me get quietly to bed now.\"    As it was, not being able to \"peep with security into futurity,\" he  imagined that the worst was over.    He began to revise this opinion immediately on turning in at Kay's  gate. He had hardly got half-way down the drive when the front door  opened and two indistinct figures came down the steps. As they did so  his foot slipped off the grass border on which he was running to  deaden the noise of his steps, and grated sharply on the gravel.    \"What's that?\" said a voice. The speaker was Mr Kay.    \"What's what?\" replied a second voice which he recognised as Mr  Mulholland's.    \"Didn't you hear a noise?\"    \"'I heard the water lapping on the crag,'\" replied Mr Mulholland,  poetically.    \"It was over there,\" persisted Mr Kay. \"I am certain I heard  something--positively certain, Mulholland. And after that burglary at  the school house--\"    He began to move towards the spot where Fenn lay crouching behind a  bush. Mr Mulholland followed, mildly amused. They were a dozen yards  away when Fenn, debating in his mind whether it would not be  better--as it would certainly be more dignified--for him to rise and  deliver himself up to justice instead of waiting to be discovered  wallowing in the damp grass behind a laurel bush, was aware of  something soft and furry pressing against his knuckles. A soft purring  sound reached his ears.    He knew at once who it was--Thomas Edward, the matron's cat, ever a  staunch friend of his. Many a time had they taken tea together in his  study in happier days. The friendly animal had sought him out in his  hiding-place, and was evidently trying to intimate that the best thing  they could do now would be to make a regular night of it.    Fenn, as I have said, liked and respected Thomas. In ordinary  circumstances he would not have spoken an unfriendly word to him. But  things were desperate now, and needed remedies to match.    Very softly he passed his hand down the delighted animal's back until  he reached his tail. Then, stifling with an effort all the finer  feelings which should have made such an act impossible, he  administered so vigorous a tweak to that appendage that Thomas, with  one frenzied yowl, sprang through the bush past the two masters and  vanished at full speed into the opposite hedge.    \"My goodness!\" said Mr Kay, starting back.    It was a further shock to Fenn to find how close he was to the laurel.        \"'Goodness me,        Why, what was that?      Silent be,        It was the cat,'\"    chanted Mr Mulholland, who was in poetical vein after the theatre.    \"It was a cat!\" gasped Mr Kay.    \"So I am disposed to imagine. What lungs! We shall be having the  R.S.P.C.A. down on us if we aren't careful. They must have heard that  noise at the headquarters of the Society, wherever they are. Well, if  your zeal for big game hunting is satisfied, and you don't propose to  follow the vocalist through that hedge, I think I will be off. Good  night. Good piece, wasn't it?\"    \"Excellent. Good night, Mulholland.\"    \"By the way, I wonder if the man who wrote it is a relation of our  Fenn. It may be his brother--I believe he writes. You probably remember  him when he was here. He was before my time. Talking of Fenn, how do  you find the new arrangement answer? Is Kennedy an improvement?\"    \"Kennedy,\" said Mr Kay, \"is a well-meaning boy, I think. Quite  well-meaning. But he lacks ability, in my opinion. I have had to speak  to him on several occasions on account of disturbances amongst the  juniors. Once I found two boys actually fighting in the junior  dayroom. I was very much annoyed about it.\"    \"And where was Kennedy while "]]]
