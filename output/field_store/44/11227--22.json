As, in the winter months, servants have much more to do, in consequence  of the necessity there is to attend to the number of fires throughout  the household, not much more than the ordinary every-day work can be  attempted.    In the summer, and when the absence of fires gives the domestics more  leisure, then any extra work that is required, can be more easily  performed.    The spring is the usual period set apart for house-cleaning, and  removing all the dust and dirt, which will necessarily, with the best of  housewives, accumulate during the winter months, from the smoke of the  coal, oil, gas, &c. This season is also well adapted for washing and  bleaching linen, &c., as, the weather, not being then too hot for the  exertions necessary in washing counterpanes, blankets, and heavy things  in general, the work is better and more easily done than in the intense  heats of July, which month some recommend for these purposes. Winter  curtains should be taken down, and replaced by the summer white ones;  and furs and woollen cloths also carefully laid by. The former should be  well shaken and brushed, and then pinned upon paper or linen, with  camphor to preserve them from the moths. Furs, &c., will be preserved in  the same way. Included, under the general description of house-cleaning,  must be understood, turning out all the nooks and corners of drawers,  cupboards, lumber-rooms, lofts, &c., with a view of getting rid of all  unnecessary articles, which only create dirt and attract vermin;  sweeping of chimneys, taking up carpets, painting and whitewashing the  kitchen and offices, papering rooms, when needed, and, generally  speaking, the house putting on, with the approaching summer, a bright  appearance, and a new face, in unison with nature. Oranges now should be  preserved, and orange wine made.    The summer will be found, as we have mentioned above, in consequence of  the diminution of labour for the domestics, the best period for  examining and repairing household linen, and for \"putting to rights\" all  those articles which have received a large share of wear and tear during  the dark winter days. In direct reference to this matter, we may here  remark, that sheets should be turned \"sides to middle\" before they are  allowed to get very thin. Otherwise, patching, which is uneconomical  from the time it consumes, and is unsightly in point of appearance, will  have to be resorted to. In June and July, gooseberries, currants,  raspberries, strawberries, and other summer fruits, should be preserved,  and jams and jellies made. In July, too, the making of walnut ketchup  should be attended to, as the green walnuts will be approaching  perfection for this purpose. Mixed pickles may also be now made, and it  will be found a good plan to have ready a jar of pickle-juice (for the  making of which all information will be given in future pages), into  which to put occasionally some young French beans, cauliflowers, &c.    In the early autumn, plums of various kinds are to be bottled and  preserved, and jams and jellies made. A little later, tomato sauce, a  most useful article to have by you, may be prepared; a supply of apples  laid in, if you have a place to keep them, as also a few keeping pears  and filberts. Endeavour to keep also a large vegetable marrow,--it will  be found delicious in the winter.    In October and November, it will be necessary to prepare for the cold  weather, and get ready the winter clothing for the various members of  the family. The white summer curtains will now be carefully put away,  the fireplaces, grates, and chimneys looked to, and the House put in a  thorough state of repair, so that no \"loose tile\" may, at a future day,  interfere with your comfort, and extract something considerable from  your pocket.    In December, the principal household duty lies in preparing for the  creature comforts of those near and dear to us, so as to meet old  Christmas with a happy face, a contented mind, and a full larder; and in  stoning the plums, washing the currants, cutting the citron, beating the  eggs, and MIXING THE PUDDING, a housewife is not unworthily greeting the  genial season of all good things.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER III.      ARRANGEMENT AND ECONOMY OF THE KITCHEN.    62. \"THE DISTRIBUTION OF A KITCHEN,\" says Count Rumford, the celebrated  philosopher and physician, who wrote so learnedly on all subjects  connected with domestic economy and architecture, \"must always depend so  much on local circumstances, that general rules can hardly be given  respecting it; the principles, however, on which this distribution  ought, in all cases, to be made, are simple and easy to be understood,\"  and, in his estimation, these resolve themselves into symmetry of  proportion in the building and convenience to the cook. The requisites  of a good kitchen, however, demand something more special than is here  pointed out. It must be remembered that it is the great laboratory of  every household, and that much of the \"weal or woe,\" as far as regards  bodily health, depends upon the nature of the preparations concocted  within its walls. A good kitchen, therefore, should be erected with a  view to the following particulars. 1. Convenience of distribution in its  parts, with largeness of dimension. 2. Excellence of light, height of  ceiling, and good ventilation. 3. Easiness of access, without passing  through the house. 4. Sufficiently remote from the principal apartments  of the house, that the members, visitors, or guests of the family, may  not perceive the odour incident to cooking, or hear the noise of  culinary operations. 5. Plenty of fuel and water, which, with the  scullery, pantry, and storeroom, should be so near it, as to offer the  smallest possible trouble in reaching them.    [Illustration: _Fig_. 1.]        The kitchens of the Middle Ages, in England, are said to have      been constructed after the fashion of those of the Romans. They      were generally octagonal, with several fireplaces, but no      chimneys; neither was there any wood admitted into the building.      The accompanying cut, fig. 1, represents the turret which was      erected on the top of the conical roof of the kitchen at      Glastonbury Abbey, and which was perforated with holes to allow      the smoke of the fire, as well as the steam from cooking, to      escape. Some kitchens had funnels or vents below the eaves to      let out the steam, which was sometimes considerable, as the      Anglo-Saxons used their meat chiefly in a boiled state. From      this circumstance, some of their large kitchens had four ranges,      comprising a boiling-place for small boiled meats, and a      boiling-house for the great boiler. In private houses the      culinary arrangements were no doubt different; for Du Cange      mentions a little kitchen with a chamber, even in a solarium, or      upper floor.    63. THE SIMPLICITY OF THE PRIMITIVE AGES has frequently been an object  of poetical admiration, and it delights the imagination to picture men  living upon such fruits as spring spontaneously from the earth, and  desiring no other beverages to slake their thirst, but such as fountains  and rivers supply. Thus we are told, that the ancient inhabitants of  Argos lived principally on pears; that the Arcadians revelled in acorns,  and the Athenians in figs. This, of course, was in the golden age,  before ploughing began, and when mankind enjoyed all kinds of plenty  without having to earn their bread \"by the sweat of their brow.\" This  delightful period, however, could not last for ever, and the earth  became barren, and continued unfruitful till Ceres came and taught the  art of sowing, with several other useful inventions. The first whom she  taught to till the ground was Triptolemus, who communicated his  instructions to his countrymen the Athenians. Thence the art was carried  into Achaia, and thence into Arcadia. Barley was the first grain that  was used, and the invention of bread-making is ascribed to Pan.        The use of fire, as an instrument of cookery, must have been      coeval with this invention of bread, which, being the most      necessary of all kinds of food, was frequently used in a sense      so comprehensive as to include both meat and drink. It was, by      the Greeks, baked under the ashes.    64. IN THE PRIMARY AGES it was deemed unlawful to eat flesh, and when  mankind began to depart from their primitive habits, the flesh of swine  was the first that was eaten. For several ages, it was pronounced  unlawful to slaughter oxen, from an estimate of their great value in  assisting men to cultivate the ground; nor was it usual to kill young  animals, from a sentiment which considered it cruel to take away the  life of those that had scarcely tasted the joys of existence.        At this period no cooks were kept, and we know from Homer that      his ancient heroes prepared and dressed their victuals with      their own hands. Ulysses, for example, we are told, like a      modern charwoman, excelled at lighting a fire, whilst Achilles      was an adept at turning a spit. Subsequently, heralds, employed      in civil and military affairs, filled the office of cooks, and      managed marriage feasts; but this, no doubt, was after mankind      had advanced in the art of living, a step further than      _roasting_, which, in all places, was the ancient manner of      dressing meat.    65. THE AGE OF ROASTING we may consider as that in which the use of the  metals would be introduced as adjuncts to the culinary art; and amongst  these, iron, the most useful of them all, would necessarily take a  prominent place. This metal is easily oxidized, but to bring it to a  state of fusibility, it requires a most intense heat. Of all the metals,  it is the widest diffused and most abundant; and few stones or mineral  bodies are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10148"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#18)"],[1,"to knock down a calf; so look to thyself, fellow, I say again.\"    So, without more ado, each gripped his staff in the middle, and, with  fell and angry looks, they came slowly together.    Now news had been brought to Robin Hood how that Little John, instead of  doing his bidding, had passed by duty for pleasure, and so had stopped  overnight with merry company at the Blue Boar Inn, instead of going  straight to Ancaster.  So, being vexed to his heart by this, he set  forth at dawn of day to seek Little John at the Blue Boar, or at least  to meet the yeoman on the way, and ease his heart of what he thought of  the matter. As thus he strode along in anger, putting together the words  he would use to chide Little John, he heard, of a sudden, loud and angry  voices, as of men in a rage, passing fell words back and forth from one  to the other. At this, Robin Hood stopped and listened.  \"Surely,\" quoth  he to himself, \"that is Little John's voice, and he is talking in anger  also. Methinks the other is strange to my ears.  Now Heaven forfend that  my good trusty Little John should have fallen into the hands of the  King's rangers. I must see to this matter, and that quickly.\"    Thus spoke Robin Hood to himself, all his anger passing away like a  breath from the windowpane, at the thought that perhaps his trusty  right-hand man was in some danger of his life. So cautiously he made his  way through the thickets whence the voices came, and, pushing aside the  leaves, peeped into the little open space where the two men, staff in  hand, were coming slowly together.    \"Ha!\" quoth Robin to himself, \"here is merry sport afoot. Now I would  give three golden angels from my own pocket if yon stout fellow would  give Little John a right sound drubbing! It would please me to see him  well thumped for having failed in my bidding.  I fear me, though, there  is but poor chance of my seeing such a pleasant sight.\"  So saying, he  stretched himself at length upon the ground, that he might not only see  the sport the better, but that he might enjoy the merry sight at his  ease.    As you may have seen two dogs that think to fight, walking slowly round  and round each other, neither cur wishing to begin the combat, so those  two stout yeomen moved slowly around, each watching for a chance to take  the other unaware, and so get in the first blow. At last Little John  struck like a flash, and--\"rap!\"--the Tanner met the blow and turned it  aside, and then smote back at Little John, who also turned the blow; and  so this mighty battle began. Then up and down and back and forth they  trod, the blows falling so thick and fast that, at a distance, one would  have thought that half a score of men were fighting.  Thus they fought  for nigh a half an hour, until the ground was all plowed up with the  digging of their heels, and their breathing grew labored like the ox in  the furrow. But Little John suffered the most, for he had become unused  to such stiff labor, and his joints were not as supple as they had been  before he went to dwell with the Sheriff.    All this time Robin Hood lay beneath the bush, rejoicing at such a  comely bout of quarterstaff.  \"By my faith!\" quoth he to himself, \"never  had I thought to see Little John so evenly matched in all my life.  Belike, though, he would have overcome yon fellow before this had he  been in his former trim.\"    At last Little John saw his chance, and, throwing all the strength he  felt going from him into one blow that might have felled an ox, he  struck at the Tanner with might and main. And now did the Tanner's  cowhide cap stand him in good stead, and but for it he might never have  held staff in hand again. As it was, the blow he caught beside the head  was so shrewd that it sent him staggering across the little glade, so  that, if Little John had had the strength to follow up his vantage, it  would have been ill for stout Arthur.  But he regained himself quickly  and, at arm's length, struck back a blow at Little John, and this time  the stroke reached its mark, and down went Little John at full length,  his cudgel flying from his hand as he fell. Then, raising his staff,  stout Arthur dealt him another blow upon the ribs.    \"Hold!\" roared Little John.  \"Wouldst thou strike a man when he is  down?\"    \"Ay, marry would I,\" quoth the Tanner, giving him another thwack with  his staff.    \"Stop!\" roared Little John.  \"Help!  Hold, I say!  I yield me! I yield  me, I say, good fellow!\"    \"Hast thou had enough?\" asked the Tanner grimly, holding his staff  aloft.    \"Ay, marry, and more than enough.\"    \"And thou dost own that I am the better man of the two?\"    \"Yea, truly, and a murrain seize thee!\" said Little John, the first  aloud and the last to his beard.    \"Then thou mayst go thy ways; and thank thy patron saint that I am a  merciful man,\" said the Tanner.    \"A plague o' such mercy as thine!\" said Little John, sitting up and  feeling his ribs where the Tanner had cudgeled him.  \"I make my vow, my  ribs feel as though every one of them were broken in twain. I tell thee,  good fellow, I did think there was never a man in all Nottinghamshire  could do to me what thou hast done this day.\"    \"And so thought I, also,\" cried Robin Hood, bursting out of the thicket  and shouting with laughter till the tears ran down his cheeks. \"O man,  man!\" said he, as well as he could for his mirth, \"'a didst go over  like a bottle knocked from a wall.  I did see the whole merry bout, and  never did I think to see thee yield thyself so, hand and foot, to any  man in all merry England.  I was seeking thee, to chide thee for leaving  my bidding undone; but thou hast been paid all I owed thee, full  measure, pressed down and overflowing, by this good fellow.  Marry, 'a  did reach out his arm full length while thou stood gaping at him, and,  with a pretty rap, tumbled thee over as never have I seen one tumbled  before.\" So spoke bold Robin, and all the time Little John sat upon the  ground, looking as though he had sour curds in his mouth. \"What may be  thy name, good fellow?\" said Robin, next, turning to the Tanner.    \"Men do call me Arthur a Bland,\" spoke up the Tanner boldly, \"and now  what may be thy name?\"    \"Ha, Arthur a Bland!\" quoth Robin, \"I have heard thy name before, good  fellow.  Thou didst break the crown of a friend of mine at the fair at  Ely last October.  The folk there call him Jock o' Nottingham; we call  him Will Scathelock.  This poor fellow whom thou hast so belabored is  counted the best hand at the quarterstaff in all merry England.  His  name is Little John, and mine Robin Hood.\"    \"How!\" cried the Tanner, \"art thou indeed the great Robin Hood, and is  this the famous Little John?  Marry, had I known who thou art, I would  never have been so bold as to lift my hand against thee. Let me help  thee to thy feet, good Master Little John, and let me brush the dust  from off thy coat.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth Little John testily, at the same time rising carefully, as  though his bones had been made of glass, \"I can help myself, good  fellow, without thy aid; and let me tell thee, had it not been for that  vile cowskin cap of thine, it would have been ill for thee this day.\"    At this Robin laughed again, and, turning to the Tanner, he said, \"Wilt  thou join my band, good Arthur?  For I make my vow thou art one of the  stoutest men that ever mine eyes beheld.\"    \"Will I join thy band?\" cried the Tanner joyfully. \"Ay, marry, will I!  Hey for a merry life!\" cried he, leaping aloft and snapping his fingers,  \"and hey for the life I love! Away with tanbark and filthy vats and foul  cowhides! I will follow thee to the ends of the earth, good master, and  not a herd of dun deer in all the forest but shall know the sound of the  twang of my bowstring.\"    \"As for thee, Little John,\" said Robin, turning to him and laughing,  \"thou wilt start once more for Ancaster, and we will go part way with  thee, for I will not have thee turn again to either the right hand or  the left till thou hast fairly gotten away from Sherwood.  There are  other inns that thou knowest yet, hereabouts.\"  Thereupon, leaving the  thickets, they took once more to the highway and departed upon their  business.          Robin Hood and Will Scarlet    THUS THEY traveled along the sunny road, three stout fellows such as you  could hardly match anywhere else in all merry England.  Many stopped to  gaze after them as they strode along, so broad were their shoulders and  so sturdy their gait.    Quoth Robin Hood to Little John, \"Why didst thou not go straight to  Ancaster, yesterday, as I told thee?  Thou hadst not gotten thyself into  such a coil hadst thou done as I ordered.\"    \"I feared the rain that threatened,\" said Little John in a sullen tone,  for he was vexed at being so chaffed by Robin with what had happened to  him.    \"The rain!\" cried Robin, stopping of a sudden in the middle of the road,  and looking at Little John in wonder.  \"Why, thou great oaf! not a drop  of rain has fallen these three days, neither has any threatened, nor  hath there been a sign of foul weather in earth or sky or water.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" growled Little John, \"the holy Saint Swithin holdeth the  waters of the heavens in his pewter pot, and he could have poured them  out, had he chosen, even from a clear sky; and wouldst thou have had me  wet to the skin?\"    At this Robin Hood burst into a roar of laughter.  \"O Little John!\" said  he, \"what butter wits hast thou in that head of thine! Who could hold  anger against such a one as thou art?\"    So saying, they all stepped out once more, with the right foot foremost,  as the saying is.    After they had traveled some distance, the day being warm and the road  dusty, Robin Hood waxed thirsty; so, there being a fountain of water as  cold as ice, just behind the hedgerow, they crossed the stile and came  to where the water bubbled up from beneath a mossy stone.
