The culprit was tied by the hands to a strong stake; and a long  black rod being brought forth, the executioner, after flourishing it  round his head for some time, applied it with such force and dexterity to  the Bushreen's back, as to make him roar until the woods resounded with  his screams. The surrounding multitude, by their hooting and laughing,  manifested how much they enjoyed the punishment of this old gallant; and  it is worthy of remark, that the number of stripes was precisely the same  as are enjoined by the Mosaic law, _forty, save one._    As there appeared great probability that Teesee, from its being a  frontier town, would be much exposed, during the war, to the predatory  excursions of the Moors of Gadumah, Tiggity Sego had, before my arrival,  sent round to the neighbouring villages, to beg or to purchase as much  provisions as would afford subsistence to the inhabitants for one whole  year, independently of the crop on the ground, which the Moors might  destroy. This project was well received by the country people, and they  fixed a day on which to bring all the provisions they could spare to  Teesee; and as my horse was not yet returned, I went in the afternoon of  January 4th, 1796, to meet the escort with the provisions.    It was composed of about 400 men marching in good order, with corn and  ground nuts in large calabashes upon their heads. They were preceded by a  strong guard of bowmen, and followed by eight musicians or singing men.  As soon as they approached the town, the latter began a song, every verse  of which was answered by the company, and succeeded by a few strokes on  the large drums. In this manner they proceeded amidst the acclamations of  the populace, till they reached the house of Tiggity Sego, where the  loads were deposited; and in the evening they all assembled under the  Bentang tree, and spent the night in dancing and merriment. Many of these  strangers remained at Teesee for three days, during which time I was  constantly attended by as many of them as could conveniently see me; one  party giving way to another, as soon as curiosity was gratified.    On the 5th of January an embassy of ten people belonging to Almami  Abdulkader, King of Foota Torra, a country to the west of Bondou, arrived  at Teesee; and desiring Tiggity Sego to call an assembly of the  inhabitants, announced publicly their king's determination, to this  effect: \"That unless all the people of Kasson would embrace the Mahomedan  religion, and evince their conversion by saying eleven public prayers, he  (the King of Foota Torra) could not possibly stand neuter in the present  contest, but would certainly join his arms to those of Kajaaga.\" A  message of this nature, from so powerful a prince, could not fail to  create great alarm; and the inhabitants of Teesee, after a long  consultation, agreed to conform to his good pleasure, humiliating as it  was to them. Accordingly, one and all publicly offered up eleven prayers,  which were considered a sufficient testimony of their having renounced  Paganism, and embraced the doctrines of the Prophet.    It was the 8th of January before Demba Sego returned with my horse; and  being quite wearied out with the delay, I went immediately to inform his  father, that I should set out for Kooniakary early the next day. The old  man made many frivolous objections; and at length gave me to understand,  that I must not think of departing, without first paying him the same  duties he was entitled to receive from all travellers; besides which, he  expected, he said, some acknowledgment for his kindness towards me.  Accordingly, on the morning of the 9th, my friend Demba, with a number of  people, came to me, and said that they were sent by Tiggity Sego for my  present, and wished to see what goods I had appropriated for that  purpose. I knew that resistance was hopeless, and complaint unavailing;  and being in some measure prepared, by the intimation I had received the  night before, I quietly offered him seven bars of amber and five of  tobacco. After surveying these articles for some time very coolly, Demba  laid them down, and told me this, was not a present for a man of Tiggity  Sego's consequence, who had it in his power to take whatever he pleased  from me. He added, that if I did not consent to make him a larger  offering, he would carry all my baggage to his father and let him choose  for himself. I had not time for reply; for Demba and his attendants  immediately began to open my bundles, and spread the different articles  upon the floor, where they underwent a more strict examination than they  had done at Joag. Every thing that pleased them they took without  scruple; and amongst other things, Demba seized the tin box, which had so  much attracted his attention in crossing the river. Upon collecting the  scattered remains of my little fortune after these people had left me, I  found that as at Joag I had been plundered of half, so here, without even  the shadow of accusation, I was deprived of half the remainder. The  blacksmith himself, though a native of Kasson, had also been compelled to  open his bundles, and take an oath that the different articles they  contained were his own exclusive property. There was, however, no remedy;  and having been under some obligation to Demba Sego for his attention  towards me in the journey from Joag, I did not reproach him for his  rapacity, but determined to quit Teesee at all events the next morning.  In the meanwhile, in order to raise the drooping spirits of my  attendants, I purchased a fat sheep, and had it dressed for our dinner.    Early in the morning of January 10th, therefore, I left Teesee, and about  mid-day ascended a ridge, from whence we had a distant view of the hills  round Kooniakary. In the evening we reached a small village, where we  slept, and departing from thence the next morning, crossed in a few hours  a narrow but deep stream called Krieko, a branch of the Senegal. About  two miles farther to the eastward, we passed a large town called Madina;  and at two o'clock came in sight of Jumbo, the blacksmith's native town,  from whence he had been absent more than four years. Soon after this, his  brother, who had by some means been apprised of his coming, came out to  meet him, accompanied by a singing man; he brought a horse for the  blacksmith, that he might enter his native town in a dignified manner;  and he desired each of us to put a good charge of powder into our guns.  The singing man now led the way, followed by the two brothers; and we  were presently joined by a number of people from the town, all of whom  demonstrated great joy at seeing their old acquaintance the blacksmith,  by the most extravagant jumping and singing. On entering the town, the  singing man began an ex-tempore song in praise of the blacksmith,  extolling his courage in having overcome so many difficulties; and  concluding with a strict injunction to his friends to dress him plenty of  victuals.    When we arrived at the blacksmith's place of residence we dismounted and  fired our muskets. The meeting between him and his relations was very  tender; for these rude children of nature, free from restraint, display  their emotions in the strongest and most expressive manner. Amidst these  transports, the blacksmith's aged mother was led forth, leaning upon a  staff. Every one made way for her; and she stretched out her hand to bid  her son welcome. Being totally blind, she stroked his hands, arms, and  face, with great care, and seemed highly delighted that her latter days  were blessed by his return, and that her ears once more heard the music  of his voice. From this interview I was fully convinced, that whatever  difference there is between the Negro and European, in the conformation  of the nose and the colour of the skin, there is none in the genuine  sympathies and characteristic feelings of our common nature.    During the tumult of these congratulations, I had seated myself apart, by  the side of one of the huts, being unwilling to interrupt the flow of  filial and parental tenderness; and the attention of the company was so  entirely taken up with the blacksmith, that I believe none of his friends  had observed me. When all the people present had seated themselves, the  blacksmith was desired by his father to give them some account of his  adventures, and silence being commanded, he began; and after repeatedly  thanking God for the success that had attended him, related every  material occurrence that had happened to him from his leaving Kasson to  his arrival at the Gambia; his employment and success in those parts; and  the dangers he had escaped in returning to his native country. In the  latter part of his narration, he had frequently occasion to mention me;  and after many strong expressions concerning my kindness to him, he  pointed to the place where I sat, and exclaimed, _affille ibi siring_,  \"see him sitting there.\" In a moment all eyes were turned upon me; I  appeared like a being dropped from the clouds; every one was surprised  that they had not observed me before; and a few women and children  expressed great uneasiness at being so near a man of such an uncommon  appearance. By degrees, however, their apprehensions subsided; and when  the blacksmith assured them that I was perfectly inoffensive, and would  hurt nobody, some of them ventured so far as to examine the texture of my  clothes; but many of them were still very suspicious; and when by  accident I happened to move myself, or look at the young children, their  mothers would scamper off with them with the greatest precipitation. In a  few hours, however, they all became reconciled to me.    With those worthy people I spent the remainder of that, and the whole of  the ensuing day, in feasting and merriment; and the blacksmith declared  he would not quit me during my stay at Kooniakary, for which place we set  out early on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8565"],[0,"A Book of German Lyrics (#17)"],[1," power. The course of events is only dimly sketched, the tragic end hardly  more than alluded to. While the first two stanzas are composed of two  equal parts each, the last is composed of four.      62.--2, 4. WOHL, translate: _They do_, etc.      63. Of Heine's poems this was the favorite of Lenau. Absolute unity of  form and content: ceaseless change in ceaseless monotony.        7. WO SIND SIE HIN? _Whither are they gone?_      64.--5. DAS, without any definite antecedent.      65. The inscription on Heine's grave in Paris. Compare with it Robert  Louis Stevenson's Requiem.        5. WO = _irgendwo_, _somewhere_.        11. TOTENLAMPEN, lamps burned in the vaults in honor of the dead.          PLATEN    August Graf von Platen-Hallermünde was born in Ansbach, Bavaria, October  24, 1796, and died near Syracuse, Sicily, December 5, 1835. The son of a  noble family, Platen is, barring his _Weltschmerz_ (_world weariness_,  compare Lenau) and the fact that he spent a good part of his life in  foreign lands, the exact opposite of Heine. While Heine affects a certain  carelessness of rhyme and rhythm and diction, Platen observes a studied  elegance. His verse form is faultless as if chiselled in marble, his  rhymes the most careful and pure. His ballads have a stately majesty of  rhythm that reflects the inherent nobility of the poet. On the whole, his  stanzas are characterized by a full and sonorous ring, although effects  of delicate grace are not wanting (67). Platen is one of the greatest  masters of form in German literature and is unrivalled as a master of the  sonnet.      66. ALARICH (_Alaric_), the great leader of the Goths, having conquered  Rome, succumbed to a fever when 34 years old (410 A.D.), and was buried  by his troops near Cosenza (Cosentia) in the river Busento. Notice the  stately dignity of the long trochaic line without any marked caesural  pause. Any attempt to introduce the latter spoils the majestic ring of  the verse.        1. LISPELN, best rendered, _are lisped_, or _resound faintly_.        7. _vied with each other for places in the rows along the stream_.      67. The lily swaying to and fro in the water is perfectly pictured by the  rhythm, especially by the recurring five-syllable rhymes.      68. The peculiar effect is largely due to the preponderance of rhymes on  _a_ or _o_ which have proved an insurmountable obstacle for every  translator. Even Longfellow failed. His rhymes of light, night, change  the whole effect.        9. IN ACHT NEHMEN. _to watch_, in poetry is often construed with the      genitive.        14. Refers to the harmony of the spheres.        18. _Deceptively remote distance._        20. AUFS NEUE, _anew_.      69. PINDAR, the greatest of the Greek lyric poets, died according to  legend as here described. He is justly famous for his majestic odes, and  Platen revered him as his master.        9. SCHAUSPIEL, here _theater_.        11. It was customary in Greece for an older man to cultivate the      friendship of a youth, e.g., Socrates and Alcibiades.        12. In the Greek drama the action was interspersed with choral odes,      which were sung to the accompaniment of flutes.          LENAU    Nikolaus Niembsch von Strehlenau, known as Nikolaus Lenau, the third in  the group of the poets of _Weltschmerz_ (Lord Byron is the best example  in England), was born in Southern Hungary August 13, 1802. The father, a  gambler and libertine, died before the boy was five years old; the  mother, a high strung, passionate woman, battled with poverty for the  sake of her children, of whom Nikolaus was her idol. His first impression  of nature was the silent solitude and vastness of the Hungarian plains,  which probably helped to accentuate an inherent strain of melancholy. Led  astray by a youthful errant passion, he is haunted by a feeling of guilt,  of lost innocence, and Dame Melancholy becomes his faithful life  companion. When later happiness in the guise of human love crosses his  pathway, he does not dare stretch out his hand. Shuddering, he feels  there is something \"too fatally abnormal about him that he should affix  that heavenly rose to his dark gloomy heart.\" Living only for his art and  ever eager to enrich it with new impressions, he goes to America. There  Nature was virgin still, untouched by the hands of man. What a lure!  Incidentally he hopes to be cured of his melancholy and to gain an easy  competence by investing in government land. After a winter spent on the  American frontier (1832-1833) he returns to Germany a sadder, if not a  wiser man, and becomes a restless wanderer until in 1844 the fate that he  always dreaded overtakes him: his spirit is enshrouded in insanity. Six  years later, August 22, 1850, he dies in an asylum near Vienna.    Lenau's poetry is for the most part an expression of intense melancholy,  full of \"sadness at the doubtful doom of humankind.\" It abounds in subtle  nature descriptions, often quite impressionistic in their effect (76 and  especially 77). Sometimes the poet employs a homely realism (75). Lenau  was a master of the violin, and his verse is full of striking rhythmical  effects; on the whole he prefers the slower cadences so well suited to  his nature.      70. An apostrophe to the night, which is addressed as _du dunkles Auge_.        5, 6. VON HINNEN NEHMEN, _to take away_.        8. FÜR UND FÜR, _forever and ever_.      71.--3. Describes vividly the effect of the pale moonlight on the green  sedge.      72.--7. WAS for _etwas_.        10. WILL, _wills_.      73.--1 ff. In German, May is the incarnation of all spring-time beauty  and bliss. Compare 2 and 110 and the word _Maienglück_ in 29.        3. OB = _über_.        8. STRAßEN, old weak dative.        12. FRÜHLINGSKINDER, i.e., birds.        29 f. MITTEN IN ... INNEN, _in the midst of_.        42. MAG, _may_.        44. ERDEN, see note on 8.        46. 'S IST EWIG SCHADE, _it is too bad_, _it is a pity_.        56. DRÄNGE, subjunctive of purpose.        59. OB, instead of _als ob_. Common with Lenau.        60. STIMMEN, instead of _einstimmen_; _in ein Lied einstimmen_ = _to      join in a song_.        63. LAG, _lingered_.      74. The heavy, slow moving rhythm is in apt harmony with the scene  portrayed.        12. 'EINER UM DEN ANDEREN', _one after another_, _in turn_.      75.--13. 'DAS AUFGESCHLAGNE GEBET', _the prayer to which the book was  opened_.      76. This may be the direct description either of a Dutch landscape or of  a painting. Holland, like most of the North Sea Plain, is one vast level  expanse of country, through which the rivers and brooks move but  sluggishly. Here and there a Dutch windmill looms up; like all other  objects it seems to peer forth from a haze because of the moisture-laden  atmosphere. Nowhere else does nature assume such a bewitchingly drowsy  aspect in autumn as here.        10. OB, compare note to 73, 59. TRUTZE = trotze.        11. STROHKAPUZE, refers to the straw thatched roof.      77.--6. IN EINS FALLEN, _to coalesce_.        8. _And in sadness become oblivious of each other_.        9. HIN UND WIEDER, _back and forth_.      78. The last of Lenau's _Waldlieder_. The morbid melancholy of the poet  has softened, and death is to him _heimlich still vergnügtes Tauschen_,  _silent sweet passing from one state to another_.        5. VON HINNEN, _away_.          MÖRIKE    Eduard Mörike was born in Ludwigsburg, September 8, 1804. Circumstances  forced him into the study of theology, and so he passed through the  schools preparatory to the famous Tübingen School of Divinity, where he  completed his studies. He proved but an indifferent student (his thorough  knowledge of Greek and Latin was in good part the result of later  studies), he preferred to live in a fairy world of his own creation.  Nature, music, and poetry were his delight, and of all the poets Goethe  was always his favorite. For eight years Mörike was vicar in various  villages of Württemberg, more than once tempted to give up the ministry,  but finally realizing that there was no better place to live his poet  dreams than the attic room of a Suabian parsonage.    In 1834 he became pastor in Cleversulzbach, a secluded little village,  nestling among the Suabian hills. Here the poet, with his mother and  sister, lived an idyllic existence, his most frequent visitor the Muse.  Ill health forced him to resign in 1843, and Mörike once more became a  wanderer. During these years love again crossed his path, and to be able  to marry--his pension was too meager--he accepted (1851) a position at a  girls' seminary in Stuttgart, where he taught German Literature for one  or two hours a week, a none too heavy and an altogether congenial task.  Mörike died June 4, 1875.    Mörike's poetry gives abundant proof of a rich creative imagination. Even  his everyday speech was of an astounding concreteness, and thus the  various aspects of Nature assume bodily shape. Spring becomes a youth,  the symphony of spring the soft tone of a harp (81); the night--a fairy  woman--leans against the rocky cliff listening to the azure of the sky  (79). Although the idyllic predominates, deeper tragic notes are not  wanting (84, 85) nor is the full note of exuberant joy (86). But early in  life Mörike realized that any overflowing measure of joy or grief would  prove destructive to his oversensitive nature, and the golden mean became  inevitably his ideal (88). Never has he expressed that sweet serenity of  soul, which he gained not without a bitter struggle, more beautifully  than in the melodious lines: \"_Auf eine Lampe_\" (87).      79. In its allegorical personification the poem might be compared to a  painting of Böcklin. Like Venus of yore, the night rises from the sea and  at midnight sees the golden balance of time (the heavenly bodies) rest in  equilibrium. The springs try to lull the night, their mother, to sleep  with a song of the beauty of the day. She prefers the azure"]]]
