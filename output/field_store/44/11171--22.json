In four places  the swords are brought down to the bare flesh, so that they are greatly  weakened and exhausted. And if both their swords had lasted long without  breaking, they would never have retreated, nor would the battle have  come to an end before one of them perforce had died. Enide, who was  watching them, was almost beside herself with grief. Whoever could  have seen her then, as she showed her great woe by wringing her hands,  tearing her hair and shedding tears, could have seen a loyal lady. And  any man would have been a vulgar wretch who saw and did not pity her.  And the knights still fight, knocking the jewels from the helmets and  dealing at each other fearful blows. From the third to the ninth hour  the battle continued so fierce that no one could in any wise make out  which was to have the better of it. Erec exerts himself and strives; he  brought his sword down upon his enemy's helmet, cleaving it to the inner  lining of mail and making him stagger; but he stood firmly and did not  fall. Then he attacked Erec in turn, and dealt him such a blow upon the  covering of his shield that his strong and precious sword broke when he  tried to pull it out. When he saw that his sword was broken, in a spite  he threw as far away as he could the part that remained in his hand. Now  he was afraid and must needs draw back; for any knight that lacks his  sword cannot do much execution in battle or assault. Erec pursues  him until he begs him, for God's sake, not to kill him. \"Mercy, noble  knight,\" he cries, \"be not so cruel and harsh toward me. Now that I am  left without my sword, you have the strength and the power to take my  life or make me your prisoner, for I have no means of defence.\" Erec  replies: \"When thou thus dost petition me I fain would hear thee admit  outright whether thou art defeated and overcome. Thou shalt not again be  touched by me if thou dost surrender at my discretion.\" The knight was  slow to make reply. So, when Erec saw him hesitate, in order to further  dismay him, he again attacked him, rushing at him with drawn sword;  whereupon, thoroughly terrified, he cried: \"Mercy, sire! Regard me as  your captive, since it cannot be otherwise.\" Erec answers: \"More than  that is necessary. You shall not get off so easily as that. Tell me your  station and your name, and I in turn will tell you mine.\" \"Sire,\" says  he, \"you are right. I am king of this country. My liegemen are Irishmen,  and there is none who does not have to pay me rent. [129] My name  is Guivret the Little. I am very rich and powerful; for there is no  landholder whose lands touch mine in any direction who ever transgresses  my command and who does not do my pleasure. I have no neighbour who does  not fear me, however proud and bold he may be. But I greatly desire to  be your confidant and friend from this time on.\" Erec replies: \"I, too,  can boast that I am a noble man. My name is Erec, son of King Lac. My  father is king of Farther Wales, and has many a rich city, fine hall,  and strong town; no king or emperor has more than he, save only King  Arthur. Him, of course, I except; for with him none can compare.\"  Guivret is greatly astonished at this, and says: \"Sire, a great marvel  is this I hear. I was never so glad of anything as of your acquaintance.  You may put full trust in me! And should it please you to abide in my  country within my estates, I shall have you treated with great honour.  So long as you care to remain here, you shall be recognised as my lord.  We both have need of a physician, and I have a castle of mine near here,  not eight leagues away, nor even seven. I wish to take you thither with  me, and there we shall have our wounds tended.\" Erec replies: \"I thank  you for what I have heard you say. However, I will not go, thank you.  But only so much I request of you, that if I should be in need, and  you should hear that I had need of aid, you would not then forget me.\"  \"Sire\" says he, \"I promise you that never, so long as I am alive, shall  you have need of my help but that I shall go at once to aid you with all  the assistance I can command.\" \"I have nothing more to ask of you,\" says  Erec; \"you have promised me much. You are now my lord and friend, if  your deed is as good as your word.\" Then each kisses and embraces the  other. Never was there such an affectionate parting after such a fierce  battle; for from very affection and generosity each one cut off long,  wide strips from the bottom of his shirt and bound up the other's  wounds. When they had thus bandaged each other, they commended each  other to God.    (Vv. 3931-4280.) So thus they parted. Guivret takes his way back alone,  while Erec resumed his road, in dire need of plaster wherewith to heal  his wounds. He did not cease to travel until he came to a plain beside a  lofty forest all full of stags, hinds, deer, does, and other beasts,  and all sorts of game. Now King Arthur and the Queen and the best of his  barons had come there that very day. The King wished to spend three or  four days in the forest for pleasure and sport, and had commanded tents,  pavilions, and canopies to be brought. My lord Gawain had stepped into  the King's tent, all tired out by a long ride. In front of the tent a  white beech stood, and there he had left a shield of his, together with  his ashen lance. He left his steed, all saddled and bridled, fastened to  a branch by the rein. There the horse stood until Kay the seneschal came  by. [130] He came up quickly and, as if to beguile the time, took the  steed and mounted, without the interference of any one. He took the  lance and the shield, too, which were close by under the tree. Galloping  along on the steed, Kay rode along a valley until it came about by  chance that Erec met him. Now Erec recognised the seneschal, and he knew  the arms and the horse, but Kay did not recognise him, for he could not  be distinguished by his arms. So many blows of sword and lance had he  received upon his shield that all the painted design had disappeared  from it. And the lady, who did not wish to be seen or recognised by him,  shrewdly held her veil before her face, as if she were doing it because  of the sun's glare and the dust. Kay approached rapidly and straightway  seized Erec's rein, without so much as saluting him. Before he let him  move, he presumptuously asked him: \"Knight,\" says he, \"I wish to know  who you are and whence you come.\" \"You must be mad to stop me thus,\"  says Erec; \"you shall not know that just now.\" And the other replies:  \"Be not angry; I only ask it for your good. I can see and make out  clearly that you are wounded and hurt. If you will come along with me  you shall have a good lodging this night; I shall see that you are well  cared for, honoured and made comfortable: for you are in need of  rest. King Arthur and the Queen are close by here in a wood, lodged in  pavilions and tents. In all good faith, I advise you to come with me to  see the Queen and King, who will take much pleasure in you and will  show you great honour.\" Erec replies: \"You say well; yet will I not  go thither for anything. You know not what my business is: I must yet  farther pursue my way. Now let me go; too long I stay. There is still  some daylight left.\" Kay makes answer: \"You speak madness when you  decline to come. I trow you will repent of it. And however much it  may be against your will, you shall both go, as the priest goes to the  council, willy-nilly. To-night you will be badly served, if, unmindful  of my advice, you go there as strangers. Come now quickly, for I will  take you.\" At this word Erec's ire was roused. \"Vassal,\" says he, \"you  are mad to drag me thus after you by force. You have taken me quite off  my guard. I tell you you have committed an offence. For I thought to be  quite safe, and was not on my guard against you.\" Then he lays his hand  upon his sword and cries: \"Hands off my bridle, vassal! Step aside. I  consider you proud and impudent. I shall strike you, be sure of that, if  you drag me longer after you. Leave me alone now.\" Then he lets him go,  and draws off across the field more than an acre's width; then turns  about and, as a man with evil intent, issues his challenge. Each  rushed at the other. But, because Kay was without armour, Erec acted  courteously and turned the point of his lance about and presented the  butt-end instead. Even so, he gave him such a blow high up on the broad  expanse of his shield that he caused it to wound him on the temple,  pinning his arm to his breast: all prone he throws him to the earth.  Then he went to catch the horse and hands him over by the bridle to  Enide. He was about to lead it away, when the wounded man with his  wonted flattery begs him to restore it courteously to him. With fair  words he flatters and wheedles him. \"Vassal,\" says he, \"so help me God,  that horse is not mine. Rather does it belong to that knight in whom  dwells the greatest prowess in the world, my lord Gawain the Bold. I  tell you so much on his behalf, in order that you may send it back to  him and thus win honour. So shall you be courteous and wise, and I shall  be your messenger.\" Erec makes answer: \"Take the horse, vassal, and lead  it away. Since it belongs to my lord Gawain it is not meet that I should  appropriate it.\" Kay takes the horse, remounts, and coming to the royal  tent, tells the King the whole truth, keeping nothing back. And the King  summoned Gawain, saying: \"Fair nephew Gawain, if ever you were true and  courteous, go quickly after him and ask him in winsome wise who he is  and what his business. And if you can influence him and bring him along  with you to us, take care not to fail to do so.\" Then Gawain mounts his  steed, two squires following after him. They soon made Erec out, but did  not recognise him. Gawain salutes him, and he Gawain: their greetings  were mutual. Then said my lord Gawain with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/832"],[0,"Robin Hood (#17)"],[1," not escaped without a scratch,\"  continued the Sheriff, becoming talkative through pure glee. \"Here, one  of you men! Give Sir Guy of Gisborne your horse; while others of you  bury that dog of an outlaw where he lies. And let us hasten back to  Barnesdale and finish hanging the other.\"    So they put spurs to their horses, and as they rode Robin forced himself  to talk merrily, while all the time he was planning the best way to  succor Little John.    \"A boon, Sheriff,\" he said as they reached the gates of the town.    \"What is it, worthy sir? You have but to speak.\"    \"I do not want any of your gold, for I have had a brave fight. But now  that I have slain the master, let me put an end to the man; so it shall  be said that Guy of Gisborne despatched the two greatest outlaws of  England in one day.\"    \"Have it as you will,\" said the Sheriff, \"but you should have asked a  knight's fee and double your reward, and it would have been yours. It  isn't every man that can take Robin Hood.\" \"No, Excellency,\" answered  Robin. \"I say it without boasting, that no man took Robin Hood yesterday  and none shall take him to-morrow.\"    Then he approached Little John, who was still tied to the gallows-tree;  and he said to the Sheriff's men, \"Now stand you back here till I see if  the prisoner has been shrived.\" And he stooped swiftly, and cut Little  John's bonds, and thrust into his hands Sir Guy's bow and arrows, which  he had been careful to take.    \"'Tis I, Robin!\" he whispered. But in truth, Little John knew it  already, and had decided there was to be no hanging that day.    Then Robin blew three loud blasts upon his own horn, and drew forth his  own bow; and before the astonished Sheriff and his men could come to  arms the arrows were whistling in their midst in no uncertain fashion.    And look! Through the gates and over the walls came pouring another  flight of arrows! Will Scarlet and Will Stutely had watched and planned  a rescue ever since the Sheriff and Robin rode back down the hill. Now  in good time they came; and the Sheriff's demoralized force turned tail  and ran, while Robin and Little John stood under the harmless gallows,  and sped swift arrows after them, and laughed to see them go.    Then they joined their comrades and hasted back to the good greenwood,  and there rested. They had got enough sport for one day.          CHAPTER XII    HOW MAID MARIAN CAME BACK TO SHERWOOD FOREST; ALSO, HOW ROBIN HOOD CAME  BEFORE QUEEN ELEANOR.         But Robin Hood, he himself had disguis'd,       And Marian was strangely attir'd,       That they proved foes, and so fell to blows,       Whose valor bold Robin admir'd.         And when he came at London's court,       He fell down on his knee.       \"Thou art welcome, Lockesley,\" said the Queen,       \"And all thy good yeomandree.\"    Now it fell out that one day not long thereafter, Robin was minded to  try his skill at hunting. And not knowing whom he might meet in his  rambles, he stained his face and put on a sorry-looking jacket and a  long cloak before he sallied forth. As he walked, the peacefulness of  the morning came upon him, and brought back to his memory the early days  so long ago when he had roamed these same glades with Marian. How sweet  they seemed to him now, and how far away! Marian, too, the dainty friend  of his youth--would he ever see her again? He had thought of her very  often of late, and each time with increasing desire to hear her clear  voice and musical laugh, and see her eyes light up at his coming.    Perhaps the happiness of Allen-a-Dale and his lady had caused Robin's  heart-strings to vibrate more strongly; perhaps, too, the coming of  Will Scarlet. But, certes, Robin was anything but a hunter this bright  morning as he walked along with head drooping in a most love-lorn way.    Presently a hart entered the glade in full view of him, grazing  peacefully, and instantly the man of action awoke. His bow was drawn  and a shaft all but loosed, when the beast fell suddenly, pierced by a  clever arrow from the far side of the glade.    Then a handsome little page sprang gleefully from the covert and ran  toward the dying animal. This was plainly the archer, for he flourished  his bow aloft, and likewise bore a sword at his side, though for all  that he looked a mere lad.    Robin approached the hart from the other side.    \"How dare you shoot the King's beasts, stripling?\" he asked severely.    \"I have as much right to shoot them as the King himself,\" answered the  page haughtily. \"How dare you question me?\"    The voice stirred Robin strongly. It seemed to chime into his memories  of the old days. He looked at the page sharply, and the other returned  the glance, straight and unafraid.    \"Who are you, my lad?\" Robin said more civilly.    \"No lad of yours, and my name's my own,\" retorted the other with spirit.    \"Softly! Fair and softly, sweet page, or we of the forest will have to  teach you manners!\" said Robin.    \"Not if _you_ stand for the forest!\" cried the page, whipping out his  sword. \"Come, draw, and defend yourself!\"    He swung his blade valiantly; and Robin saw nothing for it but to draw  likewise. The page thereupon engaged him quite fiercely, and Robin found  that he had many pretty little tricks at fencing.    Nathless, Robin contented himself with parrying, and was loth to exert  all his superior strength upon the lad. So the fight lasted for above a  quarter of an hour, at the end of which time the page was almost spent  and the hot blood flushed his cheeks in a most charming manner.    The outlaw saw his distress, and to end the fight allowed himself to be  pricked slightly on the wrist.    \"Are you satisfied, fellow?\" asked the page, wincing a little at sight  of the blood.    \"Aye, honestly,\" replied Robin; \"and now perhaps you will grant me the  honor of knowing to whom I owe this scratch?\"    \"I am Richard Partington, page to Her Majesty, Queen Eleanor,\" answered  the lad with dignity; and again the sound of his voice troubled Robin  sorely.    \"Why come you to the greenwood alone, Master Partington?\"    The lad considered his answer while wiping his sword with a small lace  kerchief. The action brought a dim confused memory to Robin. The lad  finally looked him again in the eye.    \"Forester, whether or no you be a King's man, know that I seek one Robin  Hood, an outlaw, to whom I bring amnesty from the Queen. Can you tell me  aught of him?\" And while awaiting his answer, he replaced the kerchief  in his shirt. As he did so, the gleam of a golden trophy caught the  outlaw's eye.    Robin started forward with a joyful cry.    \"Ah! I know you now! By the sight of yon golden arrow won at the  Sheriff's tourney, you are she on whom I bestowed it, and none other  than Maid Marian!\"    \"You--are--?\" gasped Marian, for it was she; \"not Robin!\"    \"Robin's self!\" said he gaily; and forthwith, clad as he was in rags,  and stained of face, he clasped the dainty page close to his breast, and  she forsooth yielded right willingly.    \"But Robin!\" she exclaimed presently, \"I knew you not, and was rude, and  wounded you!\"    \"'Twas nothing,\" he replied laughingly, \"so long as it brought me you.\"    But she made more ado over the sore wrist than Robin had received for  all his former hurts put together. And she bound it with the little  kerchief, and said, \"Now 'twill get well!\" and Robin was convinced she  spoke the truth, for he never felt better in all his life. The whole  woods seemed tinged with a roseate hue, since Marian had come again.    But she, while happy also, was ill at ease; and Robin with a man's slow  discernment at last saw that it was because of her boy's attire. He  thought bluntly that there was naught to be ashamed of, yet smilingly  handed her his tattered long cloak, which she blushingly put on, and  forthwith recovered her spirits directly.    Then they began to talk of each other's varied fortunes, and of the many  things which had parted them; and so much did they find to tell that the  sun had begun to decline well into the afternoon before they realized  how the hours sped.    \"I am but a sorry host!\" exclaimed Robin, springing to his feet. \"I have  not once invited you to my wild roof.\"    \"And I am but a sorry page,\" replied Marian; \"for I had clean forgot  that I was Richard Partington, and really did bring you a message from  Queen Eleanor!\"    \"Tell me on our way home, and there you shall be entrusted to Mistress  Dale. While the first of my men we meet will I send back for your deer.\"    So she told him, as they walked back through the glade, how that the  fame of his prowess had reached Queen Eleanor's ears, in London town.  And the Queen had said, \"Fain would I see this bold yeoman, and behold  his skill at the long-bow.\" And the Queen had promised him amnesty if  he and four of his archers would repair to London against the next  tournament the week following, there to shoot against King Henry's  picked men, of whom the King was right vain. All this Marian told in  detail, and added:    \"When I heard Her Majesty say she desired to see you, I asked leave  to go in search of you, saying I had known you once. And the Queen was  right glad, and bade me go, and sent this gold ring to you from off her  finger, in token of her faith.\"    Then Robin took the ring and bowed his head and kissed it loyally. \"By  this token will I go to London town,\" quoth he, \"and ere I part with  the Queen's pledge, may the hand that bears it be stricken off at the  wrist!\" By this time they were come to the grove before the cave,  and Robin presented Maid Marian to the band, who treated her with the  greatest respect. Will Scarlet was especially delighted to greet again  his old time friend, while Allan-a-Dale and his good wife bustled about  to make her welcome in their tiny thatched cottage.    That evening after they had supped royally upon the very hart that  Marian had slain, Allan sang sweet songs of"]]]
