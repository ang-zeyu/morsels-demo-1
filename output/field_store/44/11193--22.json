[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#17)"],[1," their  hearers, they amused them by criticizing the books and dogmas of the  Catholics. This preliminary criticism was the first lesson of their  instruction. They pointed out any number of incoherences, absurdities,  and interpolations in the Bible: according to them, a great part of the  Scriptures had been foisted on the world by the Jews. But they triumphed  especially in detecting the contradictions of the Gospel narratives. They  sapped them with syllogisms. It is easy to understand that these exercises  in logic should have at once attracted the youthful Augustin. With his  extraordinary dialectical subtilty, he soon became very good at it  himself--much better even than his masters. He made speeches in their  assemblies, fenced against a text, peremptorily refuted it, and reduced his  adversaries to silence. He was applauded, covered with praise. A religion  which brought him such successes must be the true one.    After he became a bishop, he tried to explain to himself how it was that  he fell into Manicheeism, and could find only two reasons. \"The first,\"  he says, \"was a friendship which took hold of me under I know not what  appearance of kindness, and was like a cord about my neck.... The second  was those unhappy victories that I almost always won in our disputes.\"    But there is still another which he mentions elsewhere, and it had  perhaps the most weight. This was the loose moral code which Manicheeism  authorized. This doctrine taught that we are not responsible for the evil  we do. Our sins and vices are the work of the evil Principle--the God of  Darkness, enemy of the God of Light. Now at the moment when Augustin was  received as _auditor_ by the Manichees, he had a special need of excusing  his conduct by a moral system so convenient and indulgent. He had just  formed his connection with her who was to become the mother of his child.          IV    THE SWEETNESS OF TEARS      Augustin was nearly twenty. He had finished his studies in rhetoric within  the required time. According to the notions of that age, a young man  ought to have concluded his course by his twentieth year. If not, he was  considered past mending and sent back there and then to his family.    It may appear surprising that a gifted student like Augustin did not finish  his rhetoric course sooner. But after his terms at Madaura, he had lost  nearly a year at Thagaste. Besides, the life of Carthage had so many charms  for him that doubtless he was in no hurry to leave. However that may be,  the moment was now come for him to make up his mind about his career.  The wishes of his parents, the advice of his masters, as well as his own  ambitions and qualities, urged him, as we know, to become a barrister. But  now, suddenly, all his projects for the future changed. Not only did he  give up the law, but at the very moment when all appeared to smile on him,  at the opening of his youth, he left Carthage to go and bury himself as a  teacher of grammar in the little free-town his birthplace.    As he has neglected to give any explanation of this sudden determination,  we are reduced to conjectures. It is likely that his mother was bothered  about household expenses and could no longer afford to keep him at  Carthage. Besides, she had other children, a son and daughter, to start in  life. Augustin was on the point of being, if not poor, at least very hard  up. He must do something to earn his living, and as quickly as possible.  In these conditions, the quickest way out of the difficulty was to sell  to others what he had bought from his masters. To live, he would open a  word-shop, as he calls it disdainfully. But as he had only just ceased to  be a student, he could not dream of becoming a professor in a great city  such as Carthage, and setting himself up in rivalry to so many celebrated  masters. The best thing he could do, if he did not want to vegetate, was to  fall back on some more modest post. Now his protector, Romanianus, wanted  him to go to Thagaste. This rich man had a son almost grown up, whom it was  necessary to put as soon as possible in the hands of a tutor. Augustin,  so often helped by the father, was naturally thought of to look after the  youth. Furthermore, Romanianus, who appreciated Augustin's talent, must  have been anxious to attract him to Thagaste and keep him there. With an  eye to the interests of his free-town, he desired to have such a shining  light in the place. So he asked this young man, whom he patronized, to  return to his native district and open a grammar school. He promised  him pupils, and, above all, the support of his influence, which was  considerable, Monnica, as we may conjecture, added her entreaties to those  of the great head of the Thagaste municipality. Augustin yielded.    Did it grieve him very much to make up his mind to this exile? It must have  been extremely hard for a young man of twenty to give up Carthage and its  pleasures. Moreover, it is pretty nearly certain that at this time he had  already started that connection which was to last so long. To leave a  mistress whom he loved, and that in all the freshness of a passion just  beginning--one wonders how he was able to make up his mind to it. And yet  he did leave, and spent nearly a year at Thagaste.    One peculiar mark of the youth, and even of the whole life of Augustin, is  the ease with which he unlearns and breaks off his habits--the sentimental  as well as the intellectual. He used up a good many doctrines before  resting in the Catholic truth; and even afterwards, in the course of a  long life, he contradicted and corrected himself more than once in his  controversies and theological writings. His _Retractations_ prove this. One  might say that the accustomed weighs on him as a hindrance to his liberty;  that the look of the places where he lives becomes hateful to him as a  threat of servitude. He feels dimly that his true country is elsewhere, and  that if he must settle anywhere it is in the house of his Heavenly Father.  _Inquietum est cor nostrum, donec requiescat in te...._ \"Restless are our  hearts, O my God, until they rest in Thee.\" Long before St. Francis of  Assisi, he practised the mystic rule: \"As a stranger and a pilgrim.\" It is  true that in his twentieth year he was very far from being a mystic. But he  already felt that restlessness which made him cross the sea and roam Italy  from Rome to Milan. He is an impulsive. He cannot resist the mirages of his  heart or his imagination. He is always ready to leave. The road and its  chances tempt him. He is eager for the unknown. He lets himself be carried  in delight by the blowing wind. God calls him; he obeys without knowing  where he goes. This unsettled young man, halting between contrary passions,  who feels at home nowhere, has already the soul of an apostle.    This changeableness of mood was probably the true cause of his departure  for Thagaste. But other more apparent reasons, reasons more patent to a  juvenile consciousness, guided him also. No doubt he was not sorry to  reappear in his little town, although he was so young, with the importance  and authority of a master. His former companions were going to become his  pupils. And then the Manichees had fanaticized him. Carried away by the  neophyte's bubbling zeal, elevated by his triumphs at the public meetings  in Carthage, he meant to shine before his fellow-countrymen, and perhaps  convert them. He departed with his mind made up to proselytize. Let us  believe also, that in spite of his dissolute life, and the new passion that  filled his heart, he did not come back to Thagaste without an affectionate  thought at the back of his head for his mother.    The reception that Monnica had in reserve for him was going to surprise him  considerably. Since her widowhood, the wife of Patricius had singularly  advanced in the way of Christian perfection. The early Church not only  offered widows the moral help of its sacraments and consolations, it also  granted a special dignity with certain privileges to those who made a vow  to refrain from sex-intercourse. They had in the basilicas, even as the  consecrated virgins, a place of honour, divided from that of the other  matrons by a balustrade. They wore a special dress. They were obliged to  a conduct which would shew them worthy of all the outer marks of respect  which surrounded them. The austerity of Monnica had increased with the zeal  of her faith. She set an example to the Church people at Thagaste. Docile  to the teachings of her priests, eager to serve her brethren, multiplying  alms as much as she could with her straitened means, she was unfailing at  the services of the Church. Twice daily, morning and evening, she might be  seen, exact to the hour of prayer and sermon. She did not go there, her son  assures us, to mingle in cabals and the gossip of pious females, but to  hear God's word in homily, and that God might hear her in prayer.    The widow compelled all who were about her to the same severe rule which  she herself observed. In this rigid atmosphere of his home, the student  from Carthage, with his free, fashionable airs, must have caused a painful  astonishment. Monnica felt at once that she and her son understood each  other no longer. She began by remonstrating with him. Augustin rebelled.  Things got worse when, with his presumption of the young professor  new-enamelled by the schools, the harsh and aggressive assurance of the  heresiarch, he boasted as loud as he could of being a Manichee. Monnica,  deeply wounded in her piety and motherly tenderness, ordered him to give up  his errors. He refused, and only replied by sarcasms to the poor woman's  complaints. Then she must have believed that the separation was final, that  Augustin had committed an irreparable crime. Being an African Christian,  absolute in her faith and passionate for its defence, she regarded her  son as a public danger. She was filled with horror "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9090"],[0,"Germania and Agricola (#17)"],[1,"  _Primum_--ut principem, fortissimum. Gün.    _Haec quoque_. _Haec_ is rendered _such_ by Ritter. But it seems rather,  as Or. and Död. explain it, to imply nearness and familiarity to the mind  of the author and his readers: _these_ well known songs. So 20: _in haec  corpora, quae miramur_. _Quoque_, like _quidem_, follows the emphatic  word in a clause, H. 602, III. 1; Z. 355.    _Relatu_, called _cantus trux_, H. 2, 22. A Tacitean word. Freund. Cf. H.  1, 30.    _Baritum_. Al. barditum and barritum. But the latter has no ms.  authority, and the former seems to have been suggested by the bards of  the Gauls, of whose existence among the Germans however there is no  evidence. Död. says the root of the word is common to the Greek, Latin,  and German languages, viz. _baren_, i.e. _fremere_, a verb still used by  the Batavians, and the noun _bar_, i.e. carmen, of frequent occurrence  in Saxon poetry to this day.    _Terrent trepidantve. They inspire terror or tremble with fear, according  as the line_ (the troops drawn up in battle array) _has sounded_, sc. the  _baritus_ or battle cry. Thus the Batavians perceived, that the _sonitus  aciei_ on the part of the Romans was more feeble than their own, and  pressed on, as to certain triumph. H. 4, 18. So the Highlanders augured  victory, if their shouts were louder than those of the enemy. See Murphy  in loco.    _Repercussu_. A post-Augustan word. The earlier Latin authors would have  said _repercussa_, or _repercutiendo_. The later Latin, like the English,  uses more abstract terms.--_Nec tam--videntur. Nor do those carmina seem  to be so much voices_ (well modulated and harmonized), _as acclamations_  (unanimous, but inarticulate and indistinct) _of courage_. So Pliny uses  _concentus_ of the acclamations of the people. Panegyr. 2. It is often  applied by the poets to the concerts of birds, as in Virg. Geor. 1, 422.  It is here plural, cf. Or. in loc. The reading _vocis_ is without MS.  authority.    _Ulixem_. \"The love of fabulous history, which was the passion of ancient  times, produced a new Hercules in every country, and made Ulysses wander  on every shore. Tacitus mentions it as a romantic tale; but Strabo seems  willing to countenance the fiction, and gravely tells us that Ulysses  founded a city, called Odyssey, in Spain. Lipsius observes, that Lisbon,  in the name of Strabo, had the appellation of Ulysippo, or Olisipo. At  this rate, he pleasantly adds, what should hinder us inhabitants of the  Low Countries from asserting that Ulysses built the city of Ulyssinga,  and Circe founded that of Circzea or Ziriczee?\" Murphy.    _Fabuloso errore. Storied, celebrated in song_, cf. fabulosus Hydaspes.  Hor. Od. 1, 227. Ulysses having _wandered westward_ gave plausibility to  alleged traces of him in Gaul, Spain and Germany--_Asciburgium_. Now  Asburg.    _Quin etiam_, cf. notes, 13: _quin etiam_, and 14: _quin immo.--Ulixi_,  i.e. ab Ulixe, cf. Ann. 15,41: Aedes statoris Jovis Romulo vota, i.e. by  Romulus. This usage is especially frequent in the poets and the later  prose writers, cf. H. 388, II. 3; Z. 419; and in T. above all others, cf.  Böt. Lex. Tac. sub _Dativus_. Wr. and Rit. understand however an altar  (or monument) consecrated to Ulysses, i.e. erected in honor of him by the  citizens.    _Adjecto_. Inscribed with the name of his father, as well as his own,  i.e. [Greek: Laertiadae].    _Graecis litteris. Grecian characters_, cf. Caes. B.G. 1, 29: In castris  _Helvetiorum_, tabulae repertae sunt _litteris Graecis_ confectae; and  (6, 14): _Galli_ in publicis privatisque rationibus _Graecis utuntur  litteris_. T. speaks (Ann. 11, 14) of alphabetic characters, as passing  from Phenicia into Greece, and Strabo (4, 1) traces them from the Grecian  colony at Marseilles, into Gaul, whence they doubtless passed into  Germany, and even into Britain.      IV. _Aliis aliarum_. The Greek and Latin are both fond of a repetition  of different cases of the same word, even where one of them is redundant,  e.g. [Greek: oioden oios] (Hom. II. 7, 39), and particularly in the  words [Greek: allos] and _alius_. _Aliis_ is not however wholly  redundant; but brings out more fully the idea: _no intermarriages, one  with one nation, and another with another_. Walch and Ritter omit  _aliis_, though it is found in all the MSS.    _Infectos_. Things are said _infici_ and _imbui_, which are so penetrated  and permeated by something else, that that something becomes a part of  its nature or substance, as inficere colore, sanguine, veneno, animum  virtutibus. It does not necessarily imply corruption or degeneracy.    _Propriam--similem_. Three epithets not essentially different used for  the sake of emphasis==_peculiar, pure, and sui-generis. Similis_ takes  the gen., when it expresses, as here, an internal resemblance in  character; otherwise the dat., cf. Z. 411, H. 391, 2. 4.    _Habitus_. Form and features, external appearance. The physical features  of the Germans as described by Tacitus, though still sufficient to  distinguish them from the more southern European nations, have proved  less permanent than their mental and social characteristics.    _Idem omnibus_. Cf. Juv. 13, 164:        _Caerula_ quis stupuit _Germani lumina? flavam      Caesariem_, et madido torquentem cornua cirro?      Nempe quod haec illis natura est _omnibus una_.    _Magna corpora_. \"Sidonius Apollinaris says, that, being in Germany and  finding the men so very tall, he could not address verses of six feet to  patrons who were seven feet high:        Spernit senipedem stilum Thalia,      Ex quo septipedes vidit patronos.\"    Mur.    Skeletons, in the ancient graves of Germany, are found to vary from 5 ft.  10 in. to 6 ft. 10 in. and even 7 ft. Cf. Ukert, Geog. III. 1. p. 197.  These skeletons indicate a _strong_ and _well formed_ body.    _Impetum. Temporary exertion_, as opposed to _persevering toil and  effort, laboris atque operum_.    _Eadem_. Not so much _patientia_, as _ad impetum valida_. See a like  elliptical use of _idem_ § 23: eadem temperantia; § 10: iisdem nemoribus.  Also of totidem § 26.    _Minime--assueverunt_. \"Least of all, are they capable of sustaining  thirst and heat; cold and hunger, they are accustomed, by their soil and  climate, to endure.\" Ky. The force of _minime_ is confined to the first  clause, and the proper antithetic particle is omitted at the beginning of  the second. _Tolerare_ depends on _assueverunt_, and belongs to both  clauses. _Ve_ is distributive, referring _coelo_ to _frigora_ and _solo_  to _inediam_. So _vel_ in H. 1, 62: strenuis _vel_ ignavis spem metumque  addere==strenuis spem, ignavis metum addere.      V. _Humidior--ventosior. Humidior_ refers to _paludibus, ventosior_ to  _silvis_; the mountains (which were exposed to sweeping _winds_) being  for the most part covered with forests, and the low grounds with marshes.  _Ventosus_==Homeric [Greek: aenemoeis], windy, i.e. lofty. H. 3, 305:  [Greek: Ilion aenemoessan].    _Satis ferax. Satis==segetibus_ poetice. _Ferax_ is constructed with  abl., vid. Virg. Geor. 2, 222: ferax oleo.    _Impatiens_. Not to be taken in the absolute sense, cf. § 20, 23, 26,  where fruit trees and fruits are spoken of.    _Improcera_ agrees with _pecora_ understood.    _Armentis. Pecora_--flocks in general. _Armenta_ (from _aro_, to plough),  larger cattle in particular. It _may_ include horses.    _Suus honor_. Their proper, i.e. usual size and beauty.    _Gloria frontis_. Poetice for _cornua_. Their horns were small.    _Numero_. Emphatic: _number_, rather than _quality_. Or, with Ritter,  _gaudent_ may be taken in the sense of enjoy, possess: _they have a good  number of them_. In the same sense he interprets _gaudent_ in A. 44:  _opibus nimiis non gaudebat_.    _Irati_, sc. quia _opes_ sunt _irritamenta malorum_. Ov. Met. 1, 140.--  _Negaverint_. Subj. H. 525; Z. 552--_Affirmaverim_. cf. note, 2:  _crediderim_.    _Nullam venam_. \"Mines of gold and silver have since been discovered in  Germany; the former, indeed, inconsiderable, but the latter valuable.\"  Ky. T. himself in his later work (the Annals), speaks of the discovery of  a silver mine in Germany. Ann. 11, 20.    _Perinde. Not so much as might be expected_, or as the _Romans_, and  other civilized nations. So Gronovius, Död. and most commentators. See  Rup. in loc. Others, as Or. and Rit. allow no ellipsis, and render: _not  much_. See Hand's Tursellinus, vol. IV. p. 454. We sometimes use _not so  much, not so very, not so bad_, &c., for _not very, not much_, and _not  bad_. Still the form of expression strictly implies a comparison. And the  same is true of _haud perinde_, cf. Böt. Lex. Tac.    _Est videre. Est_ for _licet_. Graece et poetice. Not so used in the  earlier Latin prose. See Z. 227.    _Non in alia vilitate_, i.e. eadem vilitate, aeque vilia, _held in the  same low estimation.--Humo_. Abl. of material.    _Proximi_, sc. ad ripam. Nearest to the Roman border, opposed to  _interiores_.    _Serratos_. Not elsewhere mentioned; probably coins with serrated edges,  still found. The word is post-Augustan.    _Bigatos_. Roman coins stamped with a biga or two-horse chariot. Others  were stamped with a quadriga and called quadrigati. The bigati seem to  have circulated freely in foreign lands, cf. Ukert's Geog. of Greeks and  Romans, III. 1: Trade of Germany, and places cited there. \"The serrati  and bigati were old coins, of purer silver than those of tho Emperors.\"  Ky. Cf. Pliny, H. N. 33, 13.    _Sequuntur_. Sequi==expetere. So used by Cic., Sal., and the best  writers. Compare our word _seek_.    _Nulla affectione animi. Not from any partiality for the silver in  itself_ (but for convenience).    _Numerus_. Greater number and consequently less relative value of the  silver coins. On _quia_, cf. note, H. 1, 31.      VI. _Ne--quidem_. _Not even_, i.e. iron is scarce as well as gold and  silver. The weapons found in ancient German graves are of _stone_,"]]]
