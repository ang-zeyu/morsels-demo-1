If a member of a firm should become so far indebted, as an  individual, that he cannot comply with his obligations, the  interest he holds in the firm may be disposed of and applied to  the payment of his debts.    This does not mean that the creditors may take or seize on any  particular thing which the firm holds jointly, but that the  debtor's interest in the concern may be so disposed of. All this  the law has provided for.    A new partner admitted into a firm cannot be held responsible for  the debts of the old concern.    HOW TO DISSOLVE    Every partnership agreement must provide for and distinctly state  the period for which it is to continue.    At the end of the period named, the partnership is dissolved by  limitation.    If the partnership is to continue, a new agreement must be made  and signed.    On proper application, a partnership may be dissolved by an order  of the court.    If a member who has become objectionable to his partners should  not agree to a dissolution of the firm, the partners may apply to  a court of competent jurisdiction for a decree of dissolution.    No member of a firm can withdraw at his own option. The consent of  the other partners is necessary, and before he is released he must  provide for his share of the obligations.    Notice of dissolution should be published, and notices sent to  agents and others interested.    The following is the customary form of notice:         The copartnership heretofore existing    between John Smith, Harry Roberts and    Thomas Allen, under the firm name of    Smith, Roberts & Co., is this day    dissolved by mutual consent.                              John Smith.                              Harry Roberts.                              Thomas Allen.    June 30, 1910.    SPECIAL PARTNERSHIPS    Limited or special partners are not recognized in some states.    This is a method of association whereby a person joins a  partnership, putting in a sum agreed on, and which he may stand to  lose as an investment. He is entitled to a _pro rata_ in the  profits, but he cannot be held for the debts.    In some countries marriage is regarded as a civil contract or form  of partnership, subject to dissolution by the courts.          CHAPTER XXII    INVESTMENTS        It is a remarkable fact that many men who have shown remarkable  shrewdness in conducting a business in which a fortune may have  been accumulated, exhibit the judgment of children when it comes  to making investments.    There are able lawyers who have made fortunes in the practice of  the profession which they understood, only to lose them by  investments in mines or other ventures, about which they knew  absolutely nothing but what was told them by the scheming  speculator and smooth-tongued promoter.    As has been intimated before in these pages, there is a great  difference between saving through and hoarding through a spirit of  miserliness.    SAVINGS    Every wage or salary earner, no matter how small his compensation,  should try to lay by something of that little as a provision  against the unproductive days.    No matter how small the amount a man has set aside, after paying  for life's necessities and meeting all just debts, he is to that  extent a capitalist.    The miser would hide his savings out of reach, but the man with  the foresight to save will usually have the judgment to place  these savings where they will fructify and grow, producing the  fruitage known as interest.    The young man or the young woman, or any one else who places his  little accumulations in a savings bank, has begun a form of  investment that may, if persisted in, place him or her above want,  even if it does not entitle either to a place on the lists of  great capitalists.    CAPITALISTS    The capitalist not only has money of his own to invest, but he may  and very often does need more money properly to exploit the  enterprises in which he is engaged.    Money loaned to such men, after being assured of their ability and  integrity, is an advantage to the lender as it is to the user.    The lender's profit is assured if the enterprise does not fail,  and the added capital not only insures against failure, but it may  enable the manager to succeed beyond any expectations he could  have if forced to carry on the work with only his own resources.    The capitalist may choose to buy land in the suburbs of a city and  build thereon a house to be sold or rented. This should always be  made to secure the money borrowed.    A capitalist may establish a fund from which, on good security,  the business men of the community may obtain loans, for which they  get a higher interest than that which they undertake to pay to  those whose money they are using.    Again a capitalist may undertake to loan to farmers, who have not  the means to carry on the work, but who are anxious to make their  lands more productive, through drainage and crop rotation. In this  case the money loaned is secured by the usual bond and mortgage.    Or it may be that another body of men is anxious to start a great  manufacturing enterprise in the neighborhood, but has not enough  money to place the venture on a paying basis.    In the latter case it appeals to the capitalist, and he, though  not bearing enough available means of his own, undertakes the work  with the knowledge that he can rely on the small investors, whose  contributions he has before managed successfully.    STOCKHOLDERS    Or it may be that the manufacturing company does not ask the  capitalist to assist, but itself goes to the small investor with a  prospectus of the enterprise, and offers to sell stock in the  concern at $50 or $100 a share, as the case may be.    This gives a chance to enjoy the profits, be they great or small;  but with the chance for larger profits there comes the greater  risk which must always be assumed in such cases.    Sometimes, when a company is starting, its stock may be put below  par. This stock, in the event of success, may appreciate, as with  some bank and other corporation stocks, many times above the par  value.    When stocks sell in the open market for their face value, they are  said to be at par.    KINDS OF STOCKS    Most companies, organized on a stock basis, issue stocks of two  kinds. One is known as \"common\" the other as \"preferred.\"    As the name implies, preferred stock (its rate of interest is  always fixed) is entitled to be paid out of the net dividends  first.    Whatever is left after paying the preferred stock interest is  divided up equally among the shares of common stock, each getting  according to his holdings.    Sometimes the dividends on common stock are far greater than those  on the preferred. The preferred stock dividends are regarded as a  fixed charge, but there can be no limit as to the payments on the  common stock, if the funds are available.    The stocks of railroads, factories, banks and other enterprises  may be good forms of investment, and for this they are often held  for long periods by investors for revenue.    Most stocks, however, particularly of railroads, are continually  changing hands. The buying and selling of such securities has  grown to be an enormous business, managed largely by men known as  \"stock brokers,\" many of whom are strong factors in the financial  world.    As a rule, the buying and selling of stocks through brokers is a  hazardous form of speculation, which has in it all the elements of  gambling, and we cannot advise too strongly against it.    There is another kind of stock, which some companies keep in their  safes to meet an emergency. This is known as \"treasury stock,\"  and, like the preferred, its rate of interest is fixed.    Let us suppose that a company is capitalized and prints stock to  the amount of $100,000.    This company sells $80,000 worth, and the officers believe that  they can force the enterprise to success with the money on hand.    Now, it follows that, with the same amount of earnings, the  profits on $80,000 will be greater than on $100,000, so the  $20,000 unsold stock is held in reserve.    If to extend the business, or for any other reason, it is  necessary to have more money, the treasury stock may be sold to  secure the extra capital.    If the business is placed on a basis where its success is beyond  all question, then the treasury stock may be divided _pro rata_  between the holders of the other stock, for, till disposed of in  some way, it was an asset common to the whole company.    Each stock certificate tells when dividends are declared; they may  be paid quarterly, half yearly, or annually.          CHAPTER XXIII    BONDS AS INVESTMENTS        The best way in which savings can be invested is to use them in  the extension of the business in which they were made.    The wage earner and the man on a salary cannot, of course, do  this, but the farmer, the small tradesman, and the mechanic, who  is his own employer, may be able to do so. And so, before looking  for a field for investment outside, such men should look about  them and consider how best the money may be used right on the  ground.    AS TO BONDS    But after considering the points suggested, the man who has some  money may not be able to find a secure and profitable place for it  in or near his own home. One of the safest forms of investments is  bonds, though, as with other forms of security, the rate of  interest declines as the margin of safety increases.    If a well-established stock company should wish for any reason to  increase its available cash, it may issue bonds, or certificate of  indebtedness, bearing from four to five per cent interest, payable  semi-annually.    These bonds may be transferred the same as stock. They are a good  form of security when it is desired to borrow"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6168"],[0,"Fifty Famous People: A Book of Short Stories (#17)"],[1," a  poor man's son.\" said the cardinal. \"Think of what all the fine ladies  would say.\"    \"Let them say what they please, I am not going to change my clothes.\"    As the little king went out, he turned at the door and called to  Charlot. \"Come to the palace to-morrow,\" he said, \"and you shall have  your clothes. You may bring mine with you.\"    Louis the Fourteenth became king of France when he was only five years  old. He was called \"the Fourteenth\" because there had been thirteen  other kings before him who bore the name of Louis. In history he is  often called the Grand Monarch.          WHICH WAS THE KING?        One day King Henry the Fourth of France was hunting in a large forest.  Towards evening he told his men to ride home by the main road while  he went by another way that was somewhat longer.    As he came out of the forest he saw a little boy by the roadside, who  seemed to be watching for some one.    \"Well, my boy,\" said the king, \"are you looking for your father?\"    \"No, sir,\" answered the boy. \"I am looking for the king. They say he  is hunting in the woods, and perhaps will ride out this way. So I'm  waiting to see him.\"    \"Oh, if that is what you wish,\" said King Henry, \"get up behind me on  the horse and I'll take you to the place where you will see him.\"    The boy got up at once, and sat behind the king. The horse cantered  briskly along, and king and boy were soon quite well acquainted.    \"They say that King Henry always has a number of men with him,\" said  the boy; \"how shall I know which is he?\"    \"Oh, that will be easy enough,\" was the answer. \"All the other men  will take off their hats, but the king will keep his on.\"    \"Do you mean that the one with his hat on will be the king?\"    \"Certainly.\"    Soon they came into the main road where a number of the king's men  were waiting. All the men seemed amused when they saw the boy, and as  they rode up, they greeted the king by taking off their hats.    \"Well, my boy,\" said King Henry, \"which do you think is the king?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered the boy; \"but it must be either you or I, for  we both have our hats on.\"          THE GOLDEN TRIPOD    I        One morning, long ago, a merchant of Miletus [Footnote: Mile'tus.]  was walking along the seashore. Some fishermen were pulling in a large  net, and he stopped to watch them.    \"My good men,\" he said, \"how many fish do you expect to draw in this  time?\"    \"We cannot tell,\" they answered. \"We never count our fish before they  are caught.\"    The net seemed heavy. There was certainly something in it. The merchant  felt sure that the fishermen were having a good haul.    \"How much will you take for the fish that you are drawing in?\" he  asked.    \"How much will you give?\" said the fishermen.    \"Well, I will give three pieces of silver for all that are in the net,\"  answered the merchant.    [Illustration]    The fishermen talked in low tones with one another for a little while,  and then one said, \"It's a bargain. Be they many or few, you may have  all for three pieces of silver.\"    In a few minutes the big net was pulled up out of the water. There was  not a fish in it. But it held a beautiful golden tripod that was worth  more than a thousand fishes.    The merchant was delighted. \"Here is your money,\" he said. \"Give me  the tripod.\"    \"No, indeed,\" said the fishermen. \"You were to have all the fish that  happened to be in the net and nothing else. We didn't sell you the  tripod.\"    They began to quarrel. They talked and wrangled a long time and could  not agree. Then one of the fishermen said, \"Let us ask the governor  about it and do as he shall bid us.\"    \"Yes, let us ask the governor,\" said the merchant. \"Let him decide the  matter for us.\"    So they carried the tripod to the governor, and each told his story.    The governor listened, but could not make up his mind as to who was  right. \"This is a very important question,\" he said. \"We must send to  Delphi [Footnote: Delphi (_pro_. del'fi).] and ask the oracle whether  the tripod shall be given to the fishermen or to the merchant. Leave  the tripod in my care until we get an answer.\"    Now the oracle at Delphi was supposed to be very wise. People from all  parts of the world sent to it, to tell it their troubles and get its  advice.    So the governor sent a messenger to Delphi to ask the oracle what  should be done with the tripod. The merchant and the fishermen waited  impatiently till the answer came. And this is what the oracle said:--    \"Give not the merchant nor the fishermen the prize; But give it to  that one who is wisest of the wise.\"    The governor was much pleased with this answer.    \"The prize shall go to the man who deserves it most,\" he said. \"There  is our neighbor, Thales,[Footnote: Thales (pro. tha'leez).] whom  everybody knows and loves. He is famous all over the world. Men come  from every country to see him and learn from him. We will give the  prize to him.\"    So, with his own hands he carried the golden tripod to the little house  where Thales lived. He knocked at the door and the wise man himself  opened it.    Then the governor told him how the tripod had been found, and how the  oracle had said that it must be given to the wisest of the wise.    \"And so I have brought the prize to you, friend Thales.\"    \"To me!\" said the astonished Thales. \"Why, there are many men who are  wiser than I. There is my friend Bias [Footnote: Bi'as] of Priene.  [Footnote: Prie'ne] He excels all other men. Send the beautiful gift  to him.\"    So the governor called two of his trusted officers and told them to  carry the tripod to Priene and offer it to Bias.    \"Tell the wise man why you bring it, and repeat to him the words of  the oracle.\"        II      Now all the world had heard of the wisdom of Bias. He taught that men  ought to be kind even to their enemies. He taught, also, that a friend  is the greatest blessing that any one can have.    He was a poor man and had no wish to be rich. \"It is better to be wise  than wealthy,\" he said.    When the governor's messengers came to Priene with the tripod, they  found Bias at work in his garden. They told him their errand and showed  him the beautiful prize.    He would not take it.    \"The oracle did not intend that I should have it,\" he said. \"I am not  the wisest of the wise.\"    \"But what shall we do with it?\" said the messengers. \"Where shall we  find the wisest man?\"    \"In Mitylene,\" [Footnote: Mit y l e'ne.] answered Bias, \"there is a  very great man named Pittacus. [Footnote: Pit'ta ous.] He might now  be the king of his country, but he prefers to give all of his time to  the study of wisdom. He is the man whom the oracle meant.\"        III      The name of Pittacus was known all over the world. He was a brave  soldier and a wise teacher. The people of his country had made him  their king; but as soon as he had made good laws for them he gave up  his crown.    One of his mottoes was this: \"Whatever you do, do it well.\"    The messengers found him in his house talking to his friends and  teaching them wisdom. He looked at the tripod. \"How beautiful it is!\"  he said.    Then the messengers told him how it had been taken from the sea, and  they repeated the words of the oracle:--    \"Give not the merchant nor the fishermen the prize; But give it to  that one who is wisest of the wise.\"    \"It is well,\" said he, \"that neither a merchant nor a fisherman shall  have it; for such men think only of their business and care really  nothing for beauty.\"    \"We agree with you,\" said the messengers; \"and we present the prize  to you because you are the wisest of the wise.\"    \"You are mistaken,\" answered Pittacus. \"I should be delighted to own  so beautiful a piece of workmanship, but I know I am not worthy.\"    \"Then to whom shall we take it?\" asked the messengers.    \"Take it to Cleobulus, [Footnote: Cle o bu'lus.] King of Rhodes,  [Footnote: Rhodes (_pro_. rodes).]\" answered the wise man. \"He is the  handsomest and strongest of men, and I believe he is the wisest also.\"        IV      The messengers went on until they came at last to the island of Rhodes.  There everybody was talking about King Cleobulus and his wonderful  wisdom. He had studied in all the great schools of the world, and there  was nothing that he did not know.    \"Educate the children,\" he said; and for that reason his name is  remembered to this day.    When the messengers showed him the tripod, he said, \"That is indeed  a beautiful piece of work. Will you sell it? What is the price?\"    They told him that it was not for sale, but that it was to be given  to the wisest of the wise.    \"Well, you will not find that man in Rhodes,\" said he. \"He lives in  Corinth, [Footnote: Cor'inth.] and his name is Periander. [Footnote:  Per i an'der.] Carry the precious gift to him.\"        V      Everybody had heard of Periander, king of Corinth. Some had heard of  his great learning, and others had heard of his selfishness and  cruelty.    Strangers admired him for his wisdom. His own people despised him  for his wickedness.    When he heard that some men had come to Corinth with a very costly  golden tripod, he had them brought before him.    \"I have heard all about that tripod,\" he said, \"and I know why you are  carrying it from one place to another. Do you expect to find any man  in Corinth who deserves so rich a gift?\"    \"We hope that you are the man,\" said the messengers.    \"Ha! ha I\" laughed Periander. \"Do I look like the wisest of the wise?  No, indeed. But in Lacedaemon [Footnote: Lacedaemon (_pro_. las e  de'mon).] there is a good and noble man named Chilon.[Footnote: Chilon  (_pro_. ki'lon).] He loves his country, he loves his fellow men, he  loves learning. To my mind he deserves the golden prize. I bid you  carry it to him.\"        VI      The messengers were surprised. They had never heard of Chilon, for his  name was hardly known outside of his own country. But when they came  into"]]]
