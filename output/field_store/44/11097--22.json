He had no  power to move, for fear had paralysed him. Dicky brought him a goolah of  water.    The next morning, at sunrise, a strange procession drew near to the  Birket-el-Kurun. Twenty ghaffirs went ahead with their naboots; then  came the kavasses, then the Mudir mounted, with Dicky riding beside, his  hand upon the holster where his pistol was. The face of the Mudir was  like a wrinkled skin of lard, his eyes had the look of one drunk with  hashish. Behind them came the woman, and now upon her face there was  only a look of peace. The distracted gaze had gone from her eyes, and  she listened without a tremor to the voices of the wailers behind.    Twenty yards from the lake, Dicky called a halt--Dicky, not the Mudir.  The soldiers came forward and put heavy chains and a ball upon the  woman's ankles. The woman carried the ball in her arms to the very verge  of the lake, by the deep pool called \"The Pool of the Slaughtered One.\"    Dicky turned to the Mudir. \"Are you ready?\" he said.    \"Inshallah!\" said the Mudir.    The soldiers made a line, but the crowd overlapped the line. The  fellaheen and Bedouins looked to see the Mudir summon the Ulema to  condemn the woman to shame and darkness everlasting. But suddenly Abbas  Bey turned and took the woman's right hand in his left.    Her eyes opened in an ecstasy. \"O lord and master, I go to heaven with  thee!\" she said, and threw herself forward.    Without a sound the heavy body of the Mudir lurched forward with her,  and they sank into the water together. A cry of horror and wonder burst  from the crowd.    Dicky turned to them, and raised both hands.    \"In the name of our master the Khedive!\" he cried.    Above the spot where the two had sunk floated the red tarboosh of the  Mudir of the Fayoum.          A TREATY OF PEACE    Mr. William Sowerby, lieutenant in the Mounted Infantry, was in a  difficult situation, out of which he was little likely to come with  credit--or his life. It is a dangerous thing to play with fire, so it  is said; it is a more dangerous thing to walk rough-shod over Oriental  customs. A man ere this has lost his life by carrying his shoe-leather  across the threshold of a mosque, and this sort of thing William Sowerby  knew, and of his knowledge he heeded. He did not heed another thing,  however; which is, that Oriental ladies are at home to but one man in  all the world, and that your acquaintance with them must be modified by  a mushrabieh screen, a yashmak, a shaded, fast-driving brougham, and a  hideous eunuch.    William Sowerby had not been long in Egypt, he had not travelled  very far or very wide in the Orient; and he was an impressionable and  harmless young man whose bark and bite were of equal value. His ideas of  a harem were inaccurately based on the legend that it is necessarily  the habitation of many wives and concubines and slaves. It had never  occurred to him that there might be a sort of family life in a harem;  that a pasha or a bey might have daughters as well as wives; or might  have only one wife--which is less expensive; and that a harem is not  necessarily the heaven of a voluptuary, an elysium of rosy-petalled love  and passion. Yet he might have known it all, and should have known it  all, if he had taken one-fifth of the time to observe and study Egyptian  life which he gave to polo and golf and racquets. Yet even if he had  known the life from many stand-points he would still have cherished  illusions, for, as Dicky Donovan, who had a sense of satire, said in  some satirical lines, the cherished amusements of more than one dinner  table:              \"Oh, William William Sowerby            Has come out for to see            The way of a bimbashi            With Egyptian Cavalree.            But William William Sowerby            His eyes do open wide            When he sees the Pasha's chosen            In her \"bruggam\" and her pride.            And William William Sowerby,            He has a tender smile,            Which will bring him in due season            To the waters of the Nile            And the cheery crocodile!\"    It can scarcely be said that Dicky was greatly surprised when Mahommed  Yeleb, the servant of \"William William Sowerby,\" came rapping at his  door one hot noon-day with a dark tale of disaster to his master. This  was the heart of the thing--A languid, bored, inviting face, and two  dark curious eyes in a slow-driving brougham out on the Pyramid Road;  William's tender, answering smile; his horse galloping behind to within  a discreet distance of the palace, where the lady alighted, shadowed by  the black-coated eunuch. The same thing for several days, then a device  to let the lady know his name, then a little note half in Arabic, half  in French, so mysterious, so fascinating--William Sowerby walked on air!  Then, a nocturnal going forth, followed by his frightened servant, who  dared not give a warning, for fear of the ever-ready belt which had  scarred his back erstwhile; the palace wall, an opening door, the  figure of his master passing through, the closing gate; and then no  more--nothing more, for a long thirty-six hours!    Mahommed Yeleb's face would have been white if his skin had  permitted--it was a sickly yellow; his throat was guttural with anxiety,  his eyes furtive and strained, for was he not the servant of his master,  and might not he be marked for the early tomb if, as he was sure, his  master was gone that way?    \"Aiwa, efendi, it is sure,\" he said to Dicky Donovan, who never was  surprised at anything that happened. He had no fear of anything that  breathed; and he kept his place with Ismail because he told the truth  pitilessly, was a poorer man than the Khedive's barber, and a beggar  beside the Chief Eunuch; also, because he had a real understanding of  the Oriental mind, together with a rich sense of humour.    \"What is sure?\" said Dicky to the Arab with assumed composure; for it  was important that he should show neither anxiety nor astonishment,  lest panic seize the man, and he should rush abroad with grave scandal  streaming from his mouth, and the English fat be in the Egyptian fire  for ever. \"What is sure, Mahommed Yeleb?\" repeated Dicky, lighting a  cigarette idly.    \"It is as God wills; but as the tongue of man speaks, so is he--Bimbashi  Sowerby, my master--swallowed up these thirty-six hours in the tomb  prepared for him by Selamlik Pasha.\"    Dicky felt his eyelids twitch, and he almost gave a choking groan of  anxiety, for Selamlik Pasha would not spare the invader of his harem;  an English invader would be a delicate morsel for his pitiless soul.  He shuddered inwardly at the thought of what might have occurred, what  might occur still.    If Sowerby had been trapped and was already dead, the knowledge would  creep through the bazaars like a soft wind of the night, and all the  Arab world would rejoice that a cursed Inglesi, making the unpardonable  breach of their code, had been given to the crocodiles, been smothered,  or stabbed, or tortured to death with fire. And, if it were so, what  could be done? Could England make a case of it, avenge the life of  this young fool who had disgraced her in the eyes of the world, of the  envious French in Cairo, and of that population of the palaces who  hated her because Englishmen were the enemies of backsheesh, corruption,  tyranny, and slavery? And to what good the attempt? Exists the personal  law of the Oriental palace, and who may punish any there save by that  personal law? What outside law shall apply to anything that happens  within those mysterious walls? Who shall bear true witness, when the  only judge is he whose palace it is? Though twenty nations should unite  to judge, where might proof be found--inside the palace, where all men  lie and bear false witness?    If Sowerby was not dead, then resort to force? Go to Selamlik Pasha the  malignant, and demand the young officer? How easy for Selamlik Pasha  to deny all knowledge of his existence! Threaten Selamlik--and raise a  Mahommedan crusade? That would not do.    Say nought, then, and let Sowerby, who had thrust his head into the jaws  of the tiger, get it out as best he might, or not get it out, as the  case might be?    Neither was that possible to Dicky Donovan, even if it were the more  politic thing to do, even if it were better for England's name. Sowerby  was his friend, as men of the same race are friends together in a  foreign country. Dicky had a poor opinion of Sowerby's sense or ability,  and yet he knew that if he were in Sowerby's present situation--living  or dead--Sowerby would spill his blood a hundred useless times, if need  be, to save him.    He had no idea of leaving Sowerby where he was, if alive; or of not  avenging him one way or another if dead. But how that might be he was  not on the instant sure. He had been struck as with a sudden blindness  by the news, though he showed nothing of this to Mahommed Yeleb. His  chief object was to inspire the Arab with confidence, since he was  probably the only man outside Selamlik's palace who knew the thing  as yet. It was likely that Selamlik Pasha would be secret till he saw  whether Sowerby would be missed and what inquiry was made for him. It  was important to Dicky, in the first place, that this Mahommed Yeleb be  kept quiet, by being made a confidant of his purposes so far as need be,  an accomplice in his efforts whatever they should be. Kept busy, with  a promise of success and backsheesh when the matter was completed, the  Arab would probably remain secret. Besides, as Dicky said to himself,  while Mahommed kept his head, he would not risk parading himself as the  servant of the infidel who had invaded the Pasha's harem. Again, it was  certain that he had an adequate devotion to his master, who had given  him as many ha'pence as kicks, and many cast-off"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6267"],[0,"The Weavers: a tale of England and Egypt of fifty years ago - Complete (#17)"],[1,"efore--terrible dreams, which he could  never forget; dreams of a fugitive being hunted through the world,  escaping and eluding, only to be hemmed in once more; on and on till he  grew grey and gaunt, and the hunt suddenly ended in a great morass, into  which he plunged with the howling world behind him. The grey, dank mists  came down on him, his footsteps sank deeper and deeper, and ever the  cries, as of damned spirits, grew in his ears. Mocking shapes flitted  past him, the wings of obscene birds buffeted him, the morass grew up  about him; and now it was all a red moving mass like a dead sea heaving  about him. With a moan of agony he felt the dolorous flood above his  shoulders, and then a cry pierced the gloom and the loathsome misery,  and a voice he knew called to him, \"David, David, I am coming!\" and he  had awaked with the old hallucination of his uncle's voice calling to  him in the dawn.    It came to him now as he sat by the water-side, and he raised his face  to the sun and to the world. The idlers had left him alone; none were  staring at him now. They were all intent on their own business, each man  labouring after his kind. He heard the voice of a riverman as he toiled  at a rope standing on the corn that filled his ghiassa from end to  end, from keel to gunwale. The man was singing a wild chant of cheerful  labour, the soul of the hard-smitten of the earth rising above the rack  and burden of the body:         \"O, the garden where to-day we sow and to-morrow we reap!       O, the sakkia turning by the garden walls;       O, the onion-field and the date-tree growing,       And my hand on the plough-by the blessing of God;       Strength of my soul, O my brother, all's well!\"    The meaning of the song got into his heart. He pressed his hand to his  breast with a sudden gesture. It touched something hard. It was his  flute. Mechanically he had put it in his pocket when he dressed in the  morning. He took it out and looked at it lovingly. Into it he had poured  his soul in the old days--days, centuries away, it seemed now. It should  still be the link with the old life. He rose and walked towards his home  again. The future spread clearly before him. Rapine, murder, tyranny,  oppression, were round him on every side, and the ruler of the land  called him to his counsels. Here a great duty lay--his life for this  land, his life, and his love, and his faith. He would expiate his crime  and his sin, the crime of homicide for which he alone was responsible,  the sin of secrecy for which he and another were responsible. And that  other? If only there had been but one word of understanding between them  before she left!    At the door of his house stood the American whom he had met at the  citadel yesterday-it seemed a hundred years ago.    \"I've got a letter for you,\" Lacey said. \"The lady's aunt and herself  are cousins of mine more or less removed, and originally at home in the  U. S. A. a generation ago. Her mother was an American. She didn't know  your name--Miss Hylda Maryon, I mean. I told her, but there wasn't time  to put it on.\" He handed over the unaddressed envelope.    David opened the letter, and read:    \"I have seen the papers. I do not understand what has happened, but I  know that all is well. If it were not so, I would not go. That is the  truth. Grateful I am, oh, believe me! So grateful that I do not yet know  what is the return which I must make. But the return will be made. I  hear of what has come to you--how easily I might have destroyed all! My  thoughts blind me. You are great and good; you will know at least that  I go because it is the only thing to do. I fly from the storm with a  broken wing. Take now my promise to pay what I owe in the hour Fate  wills--or in the hour of your need. You can trust him who brings this to  you; he is a distant cousin of my own. Do not judge him by his odd and  foolish words. They hide a good character, and he has a strong nature.  He wants work to do. Can you give it? Farewell.\"    David put the letter in his pocket, a strange quietness about his heart.    He scarcely realised what Lacey was saying. \"Great girl that. Troubled  about something in England, I guess. Going straight back.\"    David thanked him for the letter. Lacey became red in the face. He  tried to say something, but failed. \"Thee wishes to say something to me,  friend?\" asked David.    \"I'm full up; I can't speak. But, say--\"    \"I am going to the Palace now. Come back at noon if you will.\"    He wrung David's hand in gratitude. \"You're going to do it. You're going  to do it. I see it. It's a great game--like Abe Lincoln's. Say, let me  black your boots while you're doing it, will you?\"    David pressed his hand.          CHAPTER IX. THE LETTER, THE NIGHT, AND THE WOMAN       \"To-day has come the fulfilment of my dream, Faith. I am given to     my appointed task; I am set on a road of life in which there is no     looking back. My dreams of the past are here begun in very truth     and fact. When, in the night, I heard Uncle Benn calling, when in     the Meeting-house voices said, 'Come away, come away, and labour,     thou art idle,' I could hear my heart beat in the ardour to be off.     Yet I knew not whither. Now I know.       \"Last night the Prince Pasha called me to his Council, made me     adviser, confidant, as one who has the ear of his captain--after he     had come to terms with me upon that which Uncle Benn left of land     and gold. Think not that he tempted me.       \"Last night I saw favourites look upon me with hate because of     Kaid's favour, though the great hall was filled with show of     cheerful splendour, and men smiled and feasted. To-day I know that     in the Palace where I was summoned to my first: duty with the     Prince, every step I took was shadowed, every motion recorded, every     look or word noted and set down. I have no fear of them. They are     not subtle enough for the unexpected acts of honesty in the life of     a true man. Yet I do not wonder men fail to keep honest in the     midst of this splendour, where all is strife as to who shall have     the Prince's favour; who shall enjoy the fruits of bribery,     backsheesh, and monopoly; who shall wring from the slave and the     toil-ridden fellah the coin his poor body mints at the corvee, in     his own taxed fields of dourha and cucumbers.       \"Is this like anything we ever dreamed at Hamley, Faith? Yet here     am I set, and here shall I stay till the skein be ravelled out.     Soon I shall go into the desert upon a mission to the cities of the     South, to Dongola, Khartoum, and Darfur and beyond; for there is     trouble yonder, and war is near, unless it is given to me to bring     peace. So I must bend to my study of Arabic, which I am thankful I     learned long ago. And I must not forget to say that I shall take     with me on my journey that faithful Muslim Ebn Ezra. Others I shall     take also, but of them I shall write hereafter.       \"I shall henceforth be moving in the midst of things which I was     taught to hate. I pray that I may not hate them less as time goes     on. To-morrow I shall breathe the air of intrigue, shall hear     footsteps of spies behind me wherever I go; shall know that even the     roses in the garden have ears; that the ground under my feet will     telegraph my thoughts. Shall I be true? Shall I at last whisper,     and follow, and evade, believe in no one, much less in myself, steal     in and out of men's confidences to use them for my own purposes?     Does any human being know what he can bear of temptation or of the     daily pressure of the life around him? what powers of resistance     are in his soul? how long the vital energy will continue to throw     off the never-ending seduction, the freshening force of evil?     Therein lies the power of evil, that it is ever new, ever fortified     by continuous conquest and achievements. It has the rare fire of     aggression; is ever more upon the offence than upon the defence;     has, withal, the false lure of freedom from restraint, the throbbing     force of sympathy.       \"Such things I dreamed not of in Soolsby's but upon the hill, Faith,     though, indeed, that seemed a time of trial and sore-heartedness.     How large do small issues seem till we have faced the momentous     things! It is true that the larger life has pleasures and expanding     capacities; but it is truer still that it has perils, events which     try the soul as it is never tried in the smaller life--unless,     indeed, the soul be that of the Epicurean. The Epicurean I well     understand, and in his way I might have walked with a wicked grace.     I have in me some hidden depths of luxury, a secret heart of     pleasure, an understanding for the forbidden thing. I could have     walked the broad way with a laughing heart, though, in truth, habit     of mind and desire have kept me in the better path. But offences     must come, and woe to him from whom the offence cometh! I have     begun now, and only now, to feel the storms that shake us to our     farthest cells of life. I begin to see how near good is to evil;     how near faith is to unfaith; and how difficult it is to judge from     actions only; how little we can know to-day what we shall feel     tomorrow. Yet one must learn to see deeper, to find motive, not in     acts that shake the faith, but in character which needs no     explanation, which--\"    He paused, disturbed. Then he raised his head, as though not conscious  of what was breaking the course of his thoughts. Presently he realised  a low, hurried knocking at his door. He threw a hand over his eyes, and  sprang up. An instant later the figure of a woman, deeply veiled, stood  within the room, beside the table where he had been writing. There was  silence as they faced each other, his back against the door.    \"Oh, do you not know me?\" she said at last, and sank into the chair  where he "]]]
