But, somehow, I don't think mother did; and it appears  to me now, in looking back upon it, that she was afraid I should like  her too much. I consaited she watched us out of the corner of her  glasses, and had her ears open to hear what we said; but p'raps it was  only my vanity, for I don't know nothin' about the working of a  woman's heart even now. I am only a bachelor yet, and how in the world  should I know anything more about any lady than what I knew about poor  Flora? In the ways of women I am still as innocent as a child; I do  believe that they could persuade me that the moon is nothin' but an  eight-day clock with an illuminated face. I ain't vain, I assure you,  and never brag of what I don't know, and I must say, I don't even  pretend to understand them.\"    \"Well, I never!\" said Jessie.    \"Nor I,\" said Janet.    \"Did you ever, now!\" said Catherine. \"Oh dear, how soft you are, ain't  you?\"    \"Always was, ladies,\" said I, \"and am still as soft as dough. Father  was very kind to her, but he was old and impatient, and a little hard  of hearing, and he couldn't half the time understand her. One day she  came in with a message from neighbour Dearborne, and sais she,    \"'Father--'    \"'Colonel, if you please, dear,' said mother, 'he is not your father;'  and the old lady seemed as if she didn't half fancy any body calling  him that but her own children. Whether that is natural or not, Miss  Jessie,\" said I, \"I don't know, for how can I tell what women thinks?\"    \"Oh, of course not,\" said Janet, \"you are not waywise, and so artless;  you don't know, of course!\"    \"Exactly,\" sais I; \"but I thought mother spoke kinder cross to her,  and it confused the gall.    \"Says Flora, 'Colonel Slick, Mr Dearborne says--says--' Well, she  couldn't get the rest out; she couldn't find the English. 'Mr  Dearborne says--'    \"'Well, what the devil does he say?' said father, stampin' his foot,  out of all patience with her.    \"It frightened Flora, and off she went out of the room crying like  anything.    \"'That girl talks worse and worse,' said mother.    \"'Well, I won't say that,' says father, a little mollified, 'for she  can't talk at all, so there is no worse about it. I am sorry though I  scared her. I wish somebody would teach her English.'    \"'I will,' sais I, 'father, and she shall teach me Gaelic in return.'    \"'Indeed you shan't,' sais mother; 'you have got something better to  do than larning her; and as for Gaelic I can't bear it. It's a horrid  outlandish language, and of no earthly use whatever under the blessed  sun. It's worse than Indian.'    \"'Do, Sam,' said father; 'it's an act of kindness, and she is an  orphan, and besides, Gaelic may be of great use to you in life. I like  Gaelic myself; we had some brave Jacobite Highland soldiers in our  army in the war that did great service, but unfortunately nobody could  understand them. And as for orphans, when I think how many fatherless  children we made for the British--'    \"'You might have been better employed,' said mother, but he didn't  hear her, and went right on.    \"'I have a kindly feelin' towards them. She is a beautiful girl that.'    \"'If it warn't for her carrotty hair and freckled face,' said mother,  looking at me, 'she wouldn't be so awful ugly after all, would she?'    \"'Yes, Sam,' sais father, 'teach her English for heaven's sake; but  mind, she must give you lessons in Gaelic. Languages is a great  thing.'    \"'It's great nonsense,' said mother, raisin' her voice.    \"'It's my orders,' said father, holding up his head and standing  erect. 'It's my orders, marm, and they must be obeyed;' and he walked  out of the room as stiff as a ramrod, and as grand as a Turk.    \"'Sam,' sais mother, when we was alone, 'let the gall be; the less she  talks the more she'll work. Do you understand, my dear?'    \"'That's just my idea, mother,' sais I.    \"'Then you won't do no such nonsense, will you, Sammy?'    \"'Oh no!' sais I, 'I'll just go through the form now and then to  please father, but that's all. Who the plague wants Gaelic? If all the  Highlands of Scotland were put into a heap, and then multiplied by  three, they wouldn't be half as big as the White Mountains, would  they, marm? They are just nothin' on the map, and high hills, like  high folks, are plaguy apt to have barren heads.'    \"'Sam,' said she, a pattin' of me on the cheek, 'you have twice as  much sense as your father has after all. You take after me.'    \"I was so simple, I didn't know what to do. So I said yes to mother  and yes to father; for I knew I must honour and obey my parents, so I  thought I would please both. I made up my mind I wouldn't get books to  learn Gaelic or teach English, but do it by talking, and that I  wouldn't mind father seein' me, but I'd keep a bright look out for the  old lady.\"    \"Oh dear! how innocent that was, warn't it?\" said they.    \"Well, it was,\" said I; \"I didn't know no better then, and I don't  now; and what's more, I think I would do the same agin, if it was to  do over once more.\"    \"I have no doubt you would,\" said Janet.    \"Well, I took every opportunity when mother was not by to learn words.  I would touch her hand and say, 'What is that?' And she would say,  'LÃ uch,' and her arm, her head, and her cheek, and she would tell me  the names; and her eyes, her nose, and her chin, and so on; and then I  would touch her lips, and say, 'What's them?' And she'd say.  'Bhileau?' And then I'd kiss her, and say, 'What's that?' And she'd  say. 'Pog.' But she was so artless, and so was I; we didn't know  that's not usual unless people are courtin; for we hadn't seen  anything of the world then.    \"Well, I used to go over that lesson every time I got a chance, and  soon got it all by heart but that word Pog (kiss), which I never could  remember. She said I was very stupid, and I must say it over and over  again till I recollected it. Well, it was astonishing how quick she  picked up English, and what progress I made in Gaelic; and if it  hadn't been for mother, who hated the language like pyson, I do  believe I should soon have mastered it so as to speak it as well as  you do. But she took every opportunity she could to keep us apart, and  whenever I went into the room where Flora was spinning, or ironing,  she would either follow and take a chair, and sit me out, or send me  away of an errand, or tell me to go and talk to father, who was all  alone in the parlour, and seemed kinder dull. I never saw a person  take such a dislike to the language as she did; and she didn't seem to  like poor Flora either, for no other reason as I could see under the  light of the livin' sun, but because she spoke it; for it was  impossible not to love her--she was so beautiful, so artless, and so  interesting, and so innocent. But so it was.    \"Poor thing! I pitied her. The old people couldn't make out half she  said, and mother wouldn't allow me, who was the only person she could  talk to, to have any conversation with her if she could help it. It is  a bad thing to distrust young people, it makes them artful at last;  and I really believe it had that effect on me to a certain extent. The  unfortunate girl often had to set up late ironing, or something or  another. And if you will believe it now, mother never would let me sit  up with her to keep her company and talk to her; but before she went  to bed herself, always saw me off to my own room. Well, it's easy to  make people go to bed, but it ain't just quite so easy to make them  stay there. So when I used to hear the old lady get fairly into hers,  for my room was next to father's, though we went by different stairs  to them, I used to go down in my stocking feet, and keep her company;  for I pitied her from my heart. And then we would sit in the corner of  the fire-place and talk Gaelic half the night. And you can't think how  pleasant it was. You laugh, Miss Janet, but it really was delightful;  they were the happiest hours I almost ever spent.\"    \"Oh, I don't doubt it,\" she said, \"of course they were.\"    \"If you think so, Miss,\" said I, \"p'raps you would finish the lessons  with me this evening, if you have nothing particular to do.\"    \"Thank you, Sir,\" she said, laughing like anything. \"I can speak  English sufficient for my purpose, and I agree with your mother,  Gaelic in this country is of no sort of use whatever; at least I am so  artless and unsophisticated as to think so. But go on, Sir.\"    \"Well, mother two or three times came as near as possible catching me,  for she was awful afraid of lights and fires, she said, and couldn't  sleep sound if the coals weren't covered up with ashes, the hearth  swept, and the broom put into a tub of water, and she used to get up  and pop into the room very sudden; and though she warn't very light of  foot, we used to be too busy repeating words to keep watch as we  ought.\"    \"What an artless couple,\" said Janet; \"well I never! how you can have  the face to pretend so, I don't know! Well, you do beat all!'    \"A suspicious parent,\" sais I, \"Miss, as I said before, makes an  artful child. I never knew what guile was before that. Well, one  night; oh dear, it makes my heart ache to think of it, it was the last  we ever spent together. Flora was starching muslins, mother had seen  me off to my room, and then went to hers, when down I crept in my  stockin feet as usual, puts a chair into the chimney corner, and we  sat down and repeated our lessons. When we came to the word Pog  (kiss), I always used to forget it; and it's very odd, for it's the  most beautiful one in the language. We soon lost all caution, and it  sounded so loud and sharp it started mother; and before we knew where  we were, we heard her enter the parlour which was next to us. In an  instant I was off and behind the entry door, and Flora was up and at  work. Just then the old lady came in as softly as possible, and stood  and surveyed the room all "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6124"],[0,"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (#17)"],[1,"I, as soon  as I have opened the bundle; for I was as brisk and as pert as could be,  little thinking who heard me.    Now here, Mrs. Jervis, said I, are my ever worthy master's presents; and  then I particularised all those in the second bundle.    After which, I turned to my own, and said,    Now, Mrs. Jervis, comes poor Pamela's bundle; and a little one it is to  the others. First, here is a calico nightgown, that I used to wear o'  mornings. 'Twill be rather too good for me when I get home; but I must  have something. Then there is a quilted calamanco coat, and a pair of  stockings I bought of the pedlar, and my straw-hat with blue strings;  and a remnant of Scots cloth, which will make two shirts and two shifts,  the same I have on, for my poor father and mother. And here are four  other shifts, one the fellow to that I have on; another pretty good one,  and the other two old fine ones, that will serve me to turn and wind  with at home, for they are not worth leaving behind me; and here are two  pair of shoes, I have taken the lace off, which I will burn, and may be  will fetch me some little matter at a pinch, with an old silver buckle  or two.    What do you laugh for, Mrs. Jervis? said I.--Why you are like an April  day; you cry and laugh in a breath.    Well, let me see; ay, here is a cotton handkerchief I bought of the  pedlar--there should be another somewhere. O, here it is! and here too  are my new-bought knit mittens; and this is my new flannel coat, the  fellow to that I have on and in this parcel, pinned together, are  several pieces of printed calico, remnants of silks, and such like,  that, if good luck should happen, and I should get work, would serve  for robins and facings, and such like uses. And here too are a pair of  pockets: they are too fine for me; but I have no worse. Bless me, said  I, I did not think I had so many good things!    Well, Mrs. Jervis, said I, you have seen all my store, and I will now  sit down, and tell you a piece of my mind.    Be brief then, said she, my good girl: for she was afraid, she said  afterwards, that I should say too much.    Why then the case is this: I am to enter upon a point of equity and  conscience, Mrs. Jervis; and I must beg, if you love me, you'd let me  have my own way. Those things there of my lady's, I can have no claim  to, so as to take them away; for she gave them me, supposing I was to  wear them in her service, and to do credit to her bountiful heart. But,  since I am to be turned away, you know, I cannot wear them at my poor  father's; for I should bring all the little village upon my back; and so  I resolve not to have them.    Then, Mrs. Jervis, said I, I have far less right to these of my worthy  master's; for you see what was his intention in giving them to me. So  they were to be the price of my shame, and if I could make use of them,  I should think I should never prosper with them; and, besides, you know,  Mrs. Jervis, if I would not do the good gentleman's work, why should  I take his wages? So, in conscience, in honour, in every thing, I have  nothing to say to thee, thou second wicked bundle!    But, said I, cone to my arms, my dear third parcel, the companion of  my poverty, and the witness of my honesty; and may I never deserve the  least rag that is contained in thee, when I forfeit a title to that  innocence, that I hope will ever be the pride of my life! and then I am  sure it will be my highest comfort at my death, when all the riches and  pomps of the world will be worse than the vilest rags that can be worn  by beggars! And so I hugged my third bundle.    But, said I, Mrs. Jervis, (and she wept to hear me,) one thing more I  have to trouble you with, and that's all.    There are four guineas, you know, that came out of my good lady's  pocket, when she died; that, with some silver, my master gave me: Now  these same four guineas I sent to my poor father and mother, and they  have broken them; but would make them up, if I would: and if you think  it should be so, it shall. But pray tell me honestly your mind: As to  the three years before my lady's death, do you think, as I had no wages,  I may be supposed to be quits?--By quits, I cannot mean that my poor  services should be equal to my lady's goodness; for that's impossible.  But as all her learning and education of me, as matters have turned,  will be of little service to me now; for it had been better for me to  have been brought up to hard labour, to be sure; for that I must turn  to at last, if I can't get a place: (and you know, in places too, one is  subject to such temptations as are dreadful to think of:) so, I say, by  quits I only mean, as I return all the good things she gave me, whether  I may not set my little services against my keeping; because, as I said,  my learning is not now in the question; and I am sure my dear good lady  would have thought so, had she lived; but that too is now out of the  question. Well then, if so, I would ask, Whether, in above this year  that I have lived with my master, as I am resolved to leave all his  gifts behind me, I may not have earned, besides my keeping, these four  guineas, and these poor clothes here upon my back, and in my third  bundle? Now tell me your mind freely, without favour or affection.    Alas! my dear girl, says she, you make me unable to speak to you at all:  To be sure it will be the highest affront that can be offered, for you  to leave any of these things behind you; and you must take all your  bundles with you, or my master will never forgive you.    Well, well, Mrs. Jervis, said I, I don't care; I have been too much used  to be snubbed and hardly treated by my master, of late. I have done him  no harm; and I shall always pray for him and wish him happy. But I don't  deserve these things; I know I don't. Then, I can't wear them, if I  should take them; so they can be of no use to me: And I trust I shall  not want the poor pittance, that is all I desire to keep life and soul  together. Bread and water I can live upon, Mrs. Jervis, with content.  Water I shall get any where; and if I can't get me bread, I will live  like a bird in winter upon hips and haws, and at other times upon  pig-nuts and potatoes, or turnips, or any thing. So what occasion have I  for these things?--But all I ask is about these four guineas, and if you  think I need not return them, that is all I want to know.--To be sure,  my dear, you need not, said she; you have well earned them by that  waistcoat only. No, I think not so, in that only; but in the linen, and  other things, do you think I have? Yes, yes, said she, and more. And my  keeping allowed for, I mean, said I, and these poor clothes on my back,  besides? Remember that, Mrs. Jervis. Yes, my dear odd-one, no doubt you  have. Well then, said I, I am as happy as a princess. I am quite as rich  as I wish to be: and once more, my dear third bundle, I will hug thee to  my bosom. And I beg you'll say nothing of all this till I am gone, that  my master mayn't be so angry, but that I may go in peace; for my heart,  without other matters, will be ready to break to part with you all.    Now, Mrs. Jervis, said I, as to one matter more: and that is my master's  last usage of me, before Mr. Longman.--Said she, Pr'ythee, dear Pamela,  step to my chamber, and fetch me a paper I left on my table. I have  something to shew you in it. I will, said I, and stepped down; but that  was only a fetch, to take the orders of my master, I found. It seems he  said, he thought two or three times to have burst out upon me; but he  could not stand it, and wished I might not know he was there. But I  tripped up again so nimbly, (for there was no paper,) that I just saw  his back, as if coming out of that green-room, and going into the next  to it, the first door that was open--I whipped in, and shut the door,  and bolted it. O Mrs. Jervis! said I, what have you done by me?--I see  I can't confide in any body. I am beset on all hands. Wretched, wretched  Pamela, where shalt thou expect a friend, if Mrs. Jervis joins to betray  thee thus? She made so many protestations, (telling me all, and that  he owned I had made him wipe his eyes two or three times, and said she  hoped it would have a good effect, and remembered me, that I had said  nothing but what would rather move compassion than resentment,) that  I forgave her. But O! that I was safe from this house! for never  poor creature sure was so flustered as I have been so many months  together;--I am called down from this most tedious scribble. I wonder  what will next befall Your dutiful DAUGHTER.    Mrs. Jervis says, she is sure I shall have the chariot to carry me home  to you. Though this will look too great for me, yet it will shew as if  I was not turned away quite in disgrace. The travelling chariot is come  from Lincolnshire, and I fancy I shall go in that; for the other is  quite grand.          LETTER XXX      MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    I write again, though, may be, I shall bring it to you in my pocket: for  I shall have no writing, nor writing-time, I hope, when I come to you.  This is Wednesday morning, and I shall, I hope, set out to you to-morrow  morning; but I have had more trials and more vexations; but of another  complexion too a little, though all from the same quarter.    Yesterday my master, after he came from hunting, sent for me. I went  with great terror: for I expected he would storm, and be in a fine  passion with me for my freedom of speech before: so I was resolved to  begin first, with submission, to disarm his anger; and I fell upon my  knees as soon as I saw him; and said, Good sir, let me beseech you, as  you hope to be forgiven yourself, and for the sake of my dear good lady  your mother, who recommended me to you with her last words, to forgive  me all my faults; and only grant me this favour, the last I shall ask  you, that you will let me depart your house with peace and quietness of  mind, that I may"]]]
