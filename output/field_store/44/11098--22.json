One man, you say, dreads  crysipelas,--show him that this dread is evil: or, one dreads  hell,--show him that dread is evil. He who loves goodness, harbors  angels, reveres reverence, and lives with God. The less we have to do  with our sins, the better. No man can afford to waste his moments in  compunctions. \"That is active duty,\" say the Hindoos, \"which is not  for our bondage; that is knowledge, which is for our liberation; all  other duty is good only unto weariness.\"    Another dogma, growing out of this pernicious theologic limitation,  is this Inferno. Swedenborg has devils. Evil, according to old  philosophers, is good in the making. That pure malignity can exist,  is the extreme proposition of unbelief. It is not to be entertained  by a rational agent; it is atheism; it is the last profanation.  Euripides rightly said,--    \"Goodness and being in the gods are one; He who imputes ill to them  makes them none.\"    To what a painful perversion had Gothic theology arrived, that  Swedenborg admitted no conversion for evil spirits! But the divine  effort is never relaxed; the carrion in the sun will convert itself  to grass and flowers; and man, though in brothels, or jails, or on  gibbets, is on his way to all that is good and true. Burns, with the  wild humor of his apostrophe to \"poor old Nickie Ben,\"    \"O wad ye tak a thought, and mend!\"    has the advantage of the vindictive theologian. Everything is  superficial, and perishes, but love and truth only. The largest is  always the truest sentiment, and we feel the more generous spirit of  the Indian Vishnu,-\"I am the same to all mankind. There is not one who  is worthy of my love or hatred. They who serve me with adoration,--I  am in them, and they in me. If one whose ways are altogether evil,  serve me alone, he is as respectable as the just man; he is altogether  well employed; he soon becometh of a virtuous spirit, and obtaineth  eternal happiness.\"    For the anomalous pretension of Revelations of the other world,--only  his probity and genius can entitle it to any serious regard. His  revelations destroy their credit by running into detail. If a man say,  that the Holy Ghost hath informed him that the Last Judgment (or the  last of the judgments) took place in 1757; or, that the Dutch, in the  other world, live in a heaven by themselves, and the English in a  heaven by themselves; I reply, that the Spirit which is holy, is  reserved, taciturn, and deals in laws. The rumors of ghosts and  hobgoblins gossip and tell fortunes. The teachings of the high Spirit  are abstemious, and, in regard to particulars, negative. Socrates'  Genius did not advise him to act or to find, but if he proposed to do  somewhat not advantageous, it dissuaded him. \"What God is,\" he said,  \"I know not; what he is not I know.\" The Hindoos have denominated the  Supreme Being, the \"Internal Check.\" The illuminated Quakers explained  their Light, not as somewhat which leads to any action, but it appears  as an obstruction to anything unfit. But the right examples are private  experiences, which are absolutely at one on this point. Strictly  speaking, Swedenborg's revelation is a confounding of planes,--a capital  offence in so learned a categorist. This is to carry the law of surface  into the plane of substance, to carry individualism and its fopperies  into the realm of essences and generals, which is dislocation and  chaos.    The secret of heaven is kept from age to age. No imprudent, no sociable  angel ever dropt an early syllable to answer the longings of saints,  the fears of mortals. We should have listened on our knees to any  favorite, who, by stricter obedience, had brought his thoughts into  parallelism with the celestial currents, and could hint to human ears  the scenery and circumstance of the newly parted soul. But it is certain  that it must tally with what is best in nature. It must not be inferior  in tone to the already known works of the artist who sculptures the  globes of the firmament, and writes the moral law. It must be fresher  than rainbows, stabler than mountains, agreeing with flowers, with  tides, and the rising and setting of autumnal stars. Melodious poets  shall be hoarse as street ballads, when once the penetrating key-note  of nature and spirit is sounded,--the earth-beat, sea-beat, heart-beat  which makes the tune to which the sun rolls, and the globule of blood,  and the sap of trees.    In this mood, we hear the rumor that the seer has arrived, and his  tale is told. But there is no beauty, no heaven: for angels, goblins.  The sad muse loves night and death, and the pit. His Inferno is  mesmeric. His spiritual world bears the same relation to the  generosities and joys of truth, of which human souls have already made  us cognizant, as a man's bad dreams bear to his ideal life. It is  indeed very like, in its endless power of lurid pictures, to the  phenomena of dreaming, which nightly turns many an honest gentleman,  benevolent but dyspeptic, into a wretch, skulking like a dog about the  outer yards and kennels of creation. When he mounts into the heavens,  I do not hear its language. A man should not tell me that he has walked  among the angels; his proof is, that his eloquence makes me one. Shall  the archangels be less majestic and sweet than the figures that have  actually walked the earth? These angels that Swedenborg paints give  us no very high idea of their discipline and culture; they are all  country parsons; their heaven is a _fete champetre_, and evangelical  picnic, or French distribution of prizes to virtuous peasants. Strange,  scholastic, didactic, passionless, bloodless man, who denotes classes of  souls as a botanist disposes of a carex, and visits doleful hells as a  stratum of chalk or hornblende! He has no sympathy. He goes up and down  the world of men, a modern Rhadamanthus in gold-headed cane and peruke,  and with nonchalance, and the air of a referee, distributing souls. The  warm, many-weathered, passionate-peopled world is to him a grammar of  hieroglyphs, or an emblematic freemason's procession. How different is  Jacob Behmen! he is tremulous with emotion, and listens awe-struck, with  the gentlest humanity, to the Teacher whose lessons he conveys; and when  he asserts that, \"in some sort, love is greater than God,\" his heart  beats so high that the thumping against his leathern coat is audible  across the centuries. 'Tis a great difference. Behmen is healthily and  beautifully wise, notwithstanding the mystical narrowness and  incommunicableness. Swedenborg is disagreeably wise, and, with all his  accumulated gifts, paralyzes and repels.    It is the best sign of a great nature, that it opens a foreground,  and, like the breath of morning landscapes, invites us onward.  Swedenborg is retrospective, nor can we divest him of his mattock and  shroud. Some minds are forever restrained from descending into nature;  others are forever prevented from ascending out of it. With a force  of many men, he could never break the umbilical cord which held him  to nature, and he did not rise to the platform of pure genius.    It is remarkable that this man, who, by his perception of symbols, saw  the poetic construction of things, and the primary relation of mind  to matter, remained entirely devoid of the whole apparatus of poetic  expression, which that perception creates. He knew the grammar and  rudiments of the Mother-Tongue,--how could he not read off one strain  into music? Was he like Saadi, who, in his vision, designed to fill  his lap with the celestial flowers, as presents for his friends; but  the fragrance of the roses so intoxicated him, that the skirt dropped  from his hands? or, is reporting a breach of the manners of that  heavenly society? or, was it that he saw the vision intellectually,  and hence that chiding of the intellectual that pervades his books?  Be it as it may, his books have no melody, no emotion, no humor, no  relief to the dead prosaic level. In his profuse and accurate imagery  is no pleasure, for there is no beauty. We wander forlorn in a lack-  lustre landscape. No bird ever sang in all these gardens of the dead.  The entire want of poetry in so transcendent a mind betokens the  disease, and, like a hoarse voice in a beautiful person, is a kind of  warning. I think, sometimes, he will not be read longer. His great  name will turn a sentence. His books have become a monument. His laurels  so largely mixed with cypress, a charnel-breath so mingles with the  temple incense, that boys and maids will shun the spot.    Yet, in this immolation of genius and fame at the shrine of conscience,  is a merit sublime beyond praise. He lived to purpose: he gave a  verdict. He elected goodness as the clue to which the soul must cling  in all this labyrinth of nature. Many opinions conflict as to the true  center. In the shipwreck, some cling to running rigging, some to cask  and barrel, some to spars, some to mast; the pilot chooses with  science,--I plant myself here; all will sink before this; \"he comes  to land who sails with me.\" Do not rely on heavenly favor, or on  compassion to folly, or on prudence, on common sense, the old usage  and main chance of men; nothing can keep you,--not fate, nor health,  nor admirable intellect; none can keep you, but rectitude only,  rectitude forever and ever!--and, with a tenacity that never swerved  in all his studies, inventions, dreams, he adheres to this brave choice.  I think of him as of some transmigratory votary of Indian legend, who  says, \"Though I be dog, or jackal, or pismire, in the last rudiments  of nature, under what integument or ferocity, I cleave to right, as  the sure ladder that leads up to man and to God.\"    Swedenborg has rendered a double service to mankind, which is now only  beginning to be known. By the science of experiment and use, he made  his first steps; he observed and published the laws "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6317"],[0,"Sailing Alone Around the World (#17)"],[1,"which is somehow  found in the breast of even the lowest savage, warned me by a sign to  be on my guard, or Black Pedro would do me harm. There was no need of  the warning, however, for I was on my guard from the first, and at  that moment held a smart revolver in my hand ready for instant  service.    \"When you sailed through here before,\" he said, \"you fired a shot at  me,\" adding with some warmth that it was \"muy malo.\" I affected not to  understand, and said, \"You have lived at Sandy Point, have you not I\"  He answered frankly, \"Yes,\" and appeared delighted to meet one who had  come from the dear old place. \"At the mission?\" I queried. \"Why, yes,\"  he replied, stepping forward as if to embrace an old friend. I  motioned him back, for I did not share his flattering humor. \"And you  know Captain Pedro Samblich?\" continued I. \"Yes,\" said the villain,  who had killed a kinsman of Samblich--\"yes, indeed; he is a great  friend of mine.\" \"I know it,\" said I. Samblich had told me to shoot  him on sight. Pointing to my rifle on the cabin, he wanted to know how  many times it fired. \"Cuantos?\" said he. When I explained to him that  that gun kept right on shooting, his jaw fell, and he spoke of getting  away. I did not hinder him from going. I gave the squaws biscuits and  beef, and one of them gave me several lumps of tallow in exchange, and  I think it worth mentioning that she did not offer me the smallest  pieces, but with some extra trouble handed me the largest of all the  pieces in the canoe. No Christian could have done more. Before pushing  off from the sloop the cunning savage asked for matches, and made as  if to reach with the end of his spear the box I was about to give him;  but I held it toward him on the muzzle of my rifle, the one that \"kept  on shooting.\" The chap picked the box off the gun gingerly enough, to  be sure, but he jumped when I said, \"Quedao [Look out],\" at which the  squaws laughed and seemed not at all displeased. Perhaps the wretch  had clubbed them that morning for not gathering mussels enough for his  breakfast. There was a good understanding among us all.    From Charles Island the _Spray_ crossed over to Fortescue Bay, where  she anchored and spent a comfortable night under the lee of high land,  while the wind howled outside. The bay was deserted now. They were  Fortescue Indians whom I had seen at the island, and I felt quite sure  they could not follow the _Spray_ in the present hard blow. Not to  neglect a precaution, however, I sprinkled tacks on deck before I  turned in.    On the following day the loneliness of the place was broken by the  appearance of a great steamship, making for the anchorage with a lofty  bearing. She was no Diego craft. I knew the sheer, the model, and the  poise. I threw out my flag, and directly saw the Stars and Stripes  flung to the breeze from the great ship.    The wind had then abated, and toward night the savages made their  appearance from the island, going direct to the steamer to  \"yammerschooner.\" Then they came to the _Spray_ to beg more, or to  steal all, declaring that they got nothing from the steamer. Black  Pedro here came alongside again. My own brother could not have been  more delighted to see me, and he begged me to lend him my rifle to  shoot a guanaco for me in the morning. I assured the fellow that if I  remained there another day I would lend him the gun, but I had no mind  to remain. I gave him a cooper's draw-knife and some other small  implements which would be of service in canoe-making, and bade him be  off.    Under the cover of darkness that night I went to the steamer, which I  found to be the _Colombia,_ Captain Henderson, from New York, bound  for San Francisco. I carried all my guns along with me, in case it  should be necessary to fight my way back. In the chief mate of the  _Colombia,_ Mr. Hannibal, I found an old friend, and he referred  affectionately to days in Manila when we were there together, he in  the _Southern Cross_ and I in the _Northern Light,_ both ships as  beautiful as their names.    The _Colombia_ had an abundance of fresh stores on board. The captain  gave his steward some order, and I remember that the guileless young  man asked me if I could manage, besides other things, a few cans of  milk and a cheese. When I offered my Montevideo gold for the supplies,  the captain roared like a lion and told me to put my money up. It was  a glorious outfit of provisions of all kinds that I got.    [Illustration: A contrast in lighting--the electric lights of the  _Colombia_ and the canoe fires of the Fortescue Indians.]    Returning to the _Spray_, where I found all secure, I prepared for an  early start in the morning. It was agreed that the steamer should blow  her whistle for me if first on the move. I watched the steamer, off  and on, through the night for the pleasure alone of seeing her  electric lights, a pleasing sight in contrast to the ordinary Fuegian  canoe with a brand of fire in it. The sloop was the first under way,  but the _Colombia_, soon following, passed, and saluted as she went  by. Had the captain given me his steamer, his company would have been  no worse off than they were two or three months later. I read  afterward, in a late California paper, \"The _Colombia_ will be a total  loss.\" On her second trip to Panama she was wrecked on the rocks of  the California coast.    The _Spray_ was then beating against wind and current, as usual in the  strait. At this point the tides from the Atlantic and the Pacific  meet, and in the strait, as on the outside coast, their meeting makes  a commotion of whirlpools and combers that in a gale of wind is  dangerous to canoes and other frail craft.    A few miles farther along was a large steamer ashore, bottom up.  Passing this place, the sloop ran into a streak of light wind, and  then--a most remarkable condition for strait weather--it fell entirely  calm. Signal-fires sprang up at once on all sides, and then more than  twenty canoes hove in sight, all heading for the _Spray_. As they came  within hail, their savage crews cried, \"Amigo yammerschooner,\" \"Anclas  aqui,\" \"Bueno puerto aqui,\" and like scraps of Spanish mixed with  their own jargon. I had no thought of anchoring in their \"good port.\"  I hoisted the sloop's flag and fired a gun, all of which they might  construe as a friendly salute or an invitation to come on. They drew  up in a semicircle, but kept outside of eighty yards, which in  self-defense would have been the death-line.    In their mosquito fleet was a ship's boat stolen probably from a  murdered crew. Six savages paddled this rather awkwardly with the  blades of oars which had been broken off. Two of the savages standing  erect wore sea-boots, and this sustained the suspicion that they had  fallen upon some luckless ship's crew, and also added a hint that they  had already visited the _Spray's_ deck, and would now, if they could,  try her again. Their sea-boots, I have no doubt, would have protected  their feet and rendered carpet-tacks harmless. Paddling clumsily, they  passed down the strait at a distance of a hundred yards from the  sloop, in an offhand manner and as if bound to Fortescue Bay. This I  judged to be a piece of strategy, and so kept a sharp lookout over a  small island which soon came in range between them and the sloop,  completely hiding them from view, and toward which the _Spray_ was now  drifting helplessly with the tide, and with every prospect of going on  the rocks, for there was no anchorage, at least, none that my cables  would reach. And, sure enough, I soon saw a movement in the grass just  on top of the island, which is called Bonet Island and is one hundred  and thirty-six feet high. I fired several shots over the place, but  saw no other sign of the savages. It was they that had moved the  grass, for as the sloop swept past the island, the rebound of the tide  carrying her clear, there on the other side was the boat, surely  enough exposing their cunning and treachery. A stiff breeze, coming up  suddenly, now scattered the canoes while it extricated the sloop from  a dangerous position, albeit the wind, though friendly, was still  ahead.    The _Spray_, flogging against current and wind, made Borgia Bay on the  following afternoon, and cast anchor there for the second time. I  would now, if I could, describe the moonlit scene on the strait at  midnight after I had cleared the savages and Bonet Island. A heavy  cloud-bank that had swept across the sky then cleared away, and the  night became suddenly as light as day, or nearly so. A high mountain  was mirrored in the channel ahead, and the _Spray_ sailing along with  her shadow was as two sloops on the sea.    [Illustration: Records of passages through the strait at the head of  Borgia Bay. Note.--On a small bush nearer the water there was a board  bearing several other inscriptions, to which were added the words  \"Sloop _Spray_, March, 1896\"]    The sloop being moored, I threw out my skiff, and with ax and gun  landed at the head of the cove, and filled a barrel of water from a  stream. Then, as before, there was no sign of Indians at the place.  Finding it quite deserted, I rambled about near the beach for an hour  or more. The fine weather seemed, somehow, to add loneliness to the  place, and when I came upon a spot where a grave was marked I went no  farther. Returning to the head of the cove, I came to a sort of  Calvary, it appeared to me, where navigators, carrying their cross,  had each set one up as a beacon to others coming after. They had  anchored here and gone on, all except the one under the little mound.  One of the simple marks, curiously enough, had been left there by the  steamship _Colimbia_, sister ship to the _Colombia_, my neighbor of  that morning.    I read the names of many other vessels; some of them I copied in my  journal, others were illegible. Many of the crosses had decayed and  fallen, and many a hand"]]]
