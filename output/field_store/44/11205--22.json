[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#17)"],[1,"while chopping down a tree for exercise, and  before I realized it, I was firmly rusted in every joint. There I  stood, axe in hand, but unable to move, for days and weeks and months!  Indeed, I have never known exactly how long the time was; but finally  along came Dorothy and I was saved. See! This is the very tree I was  chopping at the time I rusted.\"    \"You cannot be far from your old home, in that case,\" said Woot.    \"No; my little cabin stands not a great way off, but there is no  occasion for us to visit it. Our errand is with Nimmie Amee, and her  house is somewhat farther away, to the left of us.\"    \"Didn't you say she lives with a Wicked Witch, who makes her a slave?\"  asked the boy.    \"She did, but she doesn't,\" was the reply. \"I am told the Witch was  destroyed when Dorothy's house fell on her, so now Nimmie Amee must  live all alone. I haven't seen her, of course, since the Witch was  crushed, for at that time I was standing rusted in the forest and had  been there a long time, but the poor girl must have felt very happy to  be free from her cruel mistress.\"    \"Well,\" said the Scarecrow, \"let's travel on and find Nimmie Amee. Lead  on, your Majesty, since you know the way, and we will follow.\"    So the Tin Woodman took a path that led through the thickest part of  the forest, and they followed it for some time. The light was dim here,  because vines and bushes and leafy foliage were all about them, and  often the Tin Man had to push aside the branches that obstructed their  way, or cut them off with his axe. After they had proceeded some  distance, the Emperor suddenly stopped short and exclaimed: \"Good  gracious!\"    The Scarecrow, who was next, first bumped into his friend and then  peered around his tin body, and said in a tone of wonder:    \"Well, I declare!\"    Woot the Wanderer pushed forward to see what was the matter, and cried  out in astonishment: \"For goodness' sake!\"    Then the three stood motionless, staring hard, until Polychrome's merry  laughter rang out behind them and aroused them from their stupor.    In the path before them stood a tin man who was the exact duplicate of  the Tin Woodman. He was of the same size, he was jointed in the same  manner, and he was made of shining tin from top to toe. But he stood  immovable, with his tin jaws half parted and his tin eyes turned  upward. In one of his hands was held a long, gleaming sword. Yes, there  was the difference, the only thing that distinguished him from the  Emperor of the Winkies. This tin man bore a sword, while the Tin  Woodman bore an axe.    \"It's a dream; it must be a dream!\" gasped Woot.    \"That's it, of course,\" said the Scarecrow; \"there couldn't be two Tin  Woodmen.\"    \"No,\" agreed Polychrome, dancing nearer to the stranger, \"this one is a  Tin Soldier. Don't you see his sword?\"    The Tin Woodman cautiously put out one tin hand and felt of his  double's arm. Then he said in a voice that trembled with emotion:    \"Who are you, friend?\"    There was no reply    \"Can't you see he's rusted, just as you were once?\" asked Polychrome,  laughing again. \"Here, Nick Chopper, lend me your oil-can a minute!\"    The Tin Woodman silently handed her his oil-can, without which he never  traveled, and Polychrome first oiled the stranger's tin jaws and then  worked them gently to and fro until the Tin Soldier said:    \"That's enough. Thank you. I can now talk. But please oil my other  joints.\"    Woot seized the oil-can and did this, but all the others helped wiggle  the soldier's joints as soon as they were oiled, until they moved  freely.    The Tin Soldier seemed highly pleased at his release. He strutted up  and down the path, saying in a high, thin voice:      \"The Soldier is a splendid man      When marching on parade,    And when he meets the enemy      He never is afraid.      He rights the wrongs of nations,      His country's flag defends,    The foe he'll fight with great delight,      But seldom fights his friends.\"          Chapter Sixteen    Captain Fyter      \"Are you really a soldier?\" asked Woot, when they had all watched this  strange tin person parade up and down the path and proudly flourish his  sword.    \"I was a soldier,\" was the reply, \"but I've been a prisoner to Mr. Rust  so long that I don't know exactly what I am.\"    \"But--dear me!\" cried the Tin Woodman, sadly perplexed; \"how came you  to be made of tin?\"    \"That,\" answered the Soldier, \"is a sad, sad story I was in love with a  beautiful Munchkin girl, who lived with a Wicked Witch. The Witch did  not wish me to marry the girl, so she enchanted my sword, which began  hacking me to pieces. When I lost my legs I went to the tinsmith,  Ku-Klip, and he made me some tin legs. When I lost my arms, Ku-Klip  made me tin arms, and when I lost my head he made me this fine one out  of tin. It was the same way with my body, and finally I was all tin.  But I was not unhappy, for Ku-Klip made a good job of me, having had  experience in making another tin man before me.\"    \"Yes,\" observed the Tin Woodman, \"it was Ku-Klip who made me. But, tell  me, what was the name of the Munchkin girl you were in love with?\"    \"She is called Nimmie Amee,\" said the Tin Soldier.    Hearing this, they were all so astonished that they were silent for a  time, regarding the stranger with wondering looks. Finally the Tin  Woodman ventured to ask:    \"And did Nimmie Amee return your love?\"    \"Not at first,\" admitted the Soldier. \"When first I marched into the  forest and met her, she was weeping over the loss of her former  sweetheart, a woodman whose name was Nick Chopper.\"    \"That is me,\" said the Tin Woodman.    \"She told me he was nicer than a soldier, because he was all made of  tin and shone beautifully in the sun. She said a tin man appealed to  her artistic instincts more than an ordinary meat man, as I was then.  But I did not despair, because her tin sweetheart had disappeared, and  could not be found. And finally Nimmie Amee permitted me to call upon  her and we became friends. It was then that the Wicked Witch discovered  me and became furiously angry when I said I wanted to marry the girl.  She enchanted my sword, as I said, and then my troubles began. When I  got my tin legs, Nimmie Amee began to take an interest in me; when I  got my tin arms, she began to like me better than ever, and when I was  all made of tin, she said I looked like her dear Nick Chopper and she  would be willing to marry me.    \"The day of our wedding was set, and it turned out to be a rainy day.  Nevertheless I started out to get Nimmie Amee, because the Witch had  been absent for some time, and we meant to elope before she got back.  As I traveled the forest paths the rain wetted my joints, but I paid no  attention to this because my thoughts were all on my wedding with  beautiful Nimmie Amee and I could think of nothing else until suddenly  my legs stopped moving. Then my arms rusted at the joints and I became  frightened and cried for help, for now I was unable to oil myself. No  one heard my calls and before long my jaws rusted, and I was unable to  utter another sound. So I stood helpless in this spot, hoping some  wanderer would come my way and save me. But this forest path is seldom  used, and I have been standing here so long that I have lost all track  of time. In my mind I composed poetry and sang songs, but not a sound  have I been able to utter. But this desperate condition has now been  relieved by your coming my way and I must thank you for my rescue.\"    \"This is wonderful!\" said the Scarecrow, heaving a stuffy, long sigh.  \"I think Ku-Klip was wrong to make two tin men, just alike, and the  strangest thing of all is that both you tin men fell in love with the  same girl.\"    \"As for that,\" returned the Soldier, seriously, \"I must admit I lost my  ability to love when I lost my meat heart. Ku-Klip gave me a tin heart,  to be sure, but it doesn't love anything, as far as I can discover, and  merely rattles against my tin ribs, which makes me wish I had no heart  at all.\"    \"Yet, in spite of this condition, you were going to marry Nimmie Amee?\"    \"Well, you see I had promised to marry her, and I am an honest man and  always try to keep my promises. I didn't like to disappoint the poor  girl, who had been disappointed by one tin man already.\"    \"That was not my fault,\" declared the Emperor of the Winkies, and then  he related how he, also, had rusted in the forest and after a long time  had been rescued by Dorothy and the Scarecrow and had traveled with  them to the Emerald City in search of a heart that could love.    \"If you have found such a heart, sir,\" said the Soldier, \"I will gladly  allow you to marry Nimmie Amee in my place.\"    \"If she loves you best, sir,\" answered the Woodman, \"I shall not  interfere with your wedding her. For, to be quite frank with you, I  cannot yet love Nimmie Amee as I did before I became tin.\"    \"Still, one of you ought to marry the poor girl,\" remarked Woot; \"and,  if she likes tin men, there is not much choice between you. Why don't  you draw lots for her?\"    \"That wouldn't be right,\" said the Scarecrow.    \"The girl should be permitted to choose her own husband,\" asserted  Polychrome. \"You should both go to her and allow her to take her  choice. Then she will surely be happy.\"    \"That, to me, seems a very fair arrangement,\" said the Tin Soldier.    \"I agree to it,\" said the Tin Woodman, shaking the hand of his twin to  show the matter was settled. \"May I ask your name, sir?\" he continued.    \"Before I was so cut up,\" replied the other, \"I was known as Captain  Fyter, but afterward I was merely called 'The Tin Soldier.'\"    \"Well, Captain, if you are agreeable, let us now go to Nimmie Amee's  house and let her choose between us.\"    \"Very well; and if we meet the Witch, we will both fight her--you with  your axe and I with my sword.\"    \"The Witch is destroyed,\" announced the Scarecrow, and as they walked  away he told the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/961"],[0,"Glinda of Oz (#17)"],[1," who, when he had set down the  copper kettle containing the three fishes at the gate of the lonely  cottage, had asked, \"What next?\"    The goldfish stuck its head above the water in the kettle and said in  its small but distinct voice:    \"You are to lift the latch, open the door, and walk boldly into the  cottage. Do not be afraid of anything you see, for however you seem to  be threatened with dangers, nothing can harm you. The cottage is the  home of a powerful Yookoohoo, named Reera the Red, who assumes all  sorts of forms, sometimes changing her form several times in a day,  according to her fancy. What her real form may be we do not know. This  strange creature cannot be bribed with treasure, or coaxed through  friendship, or won by pity. She has never assisted anyone, or done  wrong to anyone, that we know of. All her wonderful powers are used for  her own selfish amusement. She will order you out of the house but you  must refuse to go. Remain and watch Reera closely and try to see what  she uses to accomplish her transformations. If you can discover the  secret whisper it to us and we will then tell you what to do next.\"    \"That sounds easy,\" returned Ervic, who had listened carefully. \"But  are you sure she will not hurt me, or try to transform me?\"    \"She may change your form,\" replied the goldfish, \"but do not worry if  that happens, for we can break that enchantment easily. You may be sure  that nothing will harm you, so you must not be frightened at anything  you see or hear.\"    Now Ervic was as brave as any ordinary young man, and he knew the  fishes who spoke to him were truthful and to be relied upon,  nevertheless he experienced a strange sinking of the heart as he picked  up the kettle and approached the door of the cottage. His hand trembled  as he raised the latch, but he was resolved to obey his instructions.  He pushed the door open, took three strides into the middle of the one  room the cottage contained, and then stood still and looked around him.    The sights that met his gaze were enough to frighten anyone who had not  been properly warned. On the floor just before Ervic lay a great  crocodile, its red eyes gleaming wickedly and its wide open mouth  displaying rows of sharp teeth. Horned toads hopped about; each of the  four upper corners of the room was festooned with a thick cobweb, in  the center of which sat a spider as big around as a washbasin, and  armed with pincher-like claws; a red-and-green lizard was stretched at  full length on the window-sill and black rats darted in and out of the  holes they had gnawed in the floor of the cottage.    But the most startling thing was a huge gray ape which sat upon a bench  and knitted. It wore a lace cap, such as old ladies wear, and a little  apron of lace, but no other clothing. Its eyes were bright and looked  as if coals were burning in them. The ape moved as naturally as an  ordinary person might, and on Ervic's entrance stopped knitting and  raised its head to look at him.    \"Get out!\" cried a sharp voice, seeming to come from the ape's mouth.    Ervic saw another bench, empty, just beyond him, so he stepped over the  crocodile, sat down upon the bench and carefully placed the kettle  beside him.    \"Get out!\" again cried the voice.    Ervic shook his head.    \"No,\" said he, \"I'm going to stay.\"    The spiders left their four corners, dropped to the floor and made a  rush toward the young Skeezer, circling around his legs with their  pinchers extended. Ervic paid no attention to them. An enormous black  rat ran up Ervic's body, passed around his shoulders and uttered  piercing squeals in his ears, but he did not wince. The green-and-red  lizard, coming from the window-sill, approached Ervic and began  spitting a flaming fluid at him, but Ervic merely stared at the  creature and its flame did not touch him.    The crocodile raised its tail and, swinging around, swept Ervic off the  bench with a powerful blow. But the Skeezer managed to save the kettle  from upsetting and he got up, shook off the horned toads that were  crawling over him and resumed his seat on the bench.    All the creatures, after this first attack, remained motionless, as if  awaiting orders. The old gray ape knitted on, not looking toward Ervic  now, and the young Skeezer stolidly kept his seat. He expected  something else to happen, but nothing did. A full hour passed and Ervic  was growing nervous.    \"What do you want?\" the ape asked at last.    \"Nothing,\" said Ervic.    \"You may have that!\" retorted the ape, and at this all the strange  creatures in the room broke into a chorus of cackling laughter.    Another long wait.    \"Do you know who I am?\" questioned the ape.    \"You must be Reera the Red--the Yookoohoo,\" Ervic answered.    \"Knowing so much, you must also know that I do not like strangers. Your  presence here in my home annoys me. Do you not fear my anger?\"    \"No,\" said the young man.    \"Do you intend to obey me, and leave this house?\" \"No,\" replied Ervic,  just as quietly as the Yookoohoo had spoken.    The ape knitted for a long time before resuming the conversation.    \"Curiosity,\" it said, \"has led to many a man's undoing. I suppose in  some way you have learned that I do tricks of magic, and so through  curiosity you have come here. You may have been told that I do not  injure anyone, so you are bold enough to disobey my commands to go  away. You imagine that you may witness some of the rites of witchcraft,  and that they may amuse you. Have I spoken truly?\"    \"Well,\" remarked Ervic, who had been pondering on the strange  circumstances of his coming here, \"you are right in some ways, but not  in others. I am told that you work magic only for your own amusement.  That seems to me very selfish. Few people understand magic. I'm told  that you are the only real Yookoohoo in all Oz. Why don't you amuse  others as well as yourself?\"    \"What right have you to question my actions?\"    \"None at all.\"    \"And you say you are not here to demand any favors of me?\"    \"For myself I want nothing from you.\"    \"You are wise in that. I never grant favors.\"    \"That doesn't worry me,\" declared Ervic.    \"But you are curious? You hope to witness some of my magic  transformations?\"    \"If you wish to perform any magic, go ahead,\" said Ervic. \"It may  interest me and it may not. If you'd rather go on with your knitting,  it's all the same to me. I am in no hurry at all.\"    This may have puzzled Red Reera, but the face beneath the lace cap  could show no expression, being covered with hair. Perhaps in all her  career the Yookoohoo had never been visited by anyone who, like this  young man, asked for nothing, expected nothing, and had no reason for  coming except curiosity. This attitude practically disarmed the witch  and she began to regard the Skeezer in a more friendly way. She knitted  for some time, seemingly in deep thought, and then she arose and walked  to a big cupboard that stood against the wall of the room. When the  cupboard door was opened Ervic could see a lot of drawers inside, and  into one of these drawers--the second from the bottom--Reera thrust a  hairy hand.    Until now Ervic could see over the bent form of the ape, but suddenly  the form, with its back to him, seemed to straighten up and blot out  the cupboard of drawers. The ape had changed to the form of a woman,  dressed in the pretty Gillikin costume, and when she turned around he  saw that it was a young woman, whose face was quite attractive.    \"Do you like me better this way?\" Reera inquired with a smile.    \"You look better,\" he said calmly, \"but I'm not sure I like you any  better.\"    She laughed, saying: \"During the heat of the day I like to be an ape,  for an ape doesn't wear any clothes to speak of. But if one has  gentlemen callers it is proper to dress up.\"    Ervic noticed her right hand was closed, as if she held something in  it. She shut the cupboard door, bent over the crocodile and in a moment  the creature had changed to a red wolf. It was not pretty even now, and  the wolf crouched beside its mistress as a dog might have done. Its  teeth looked as dangerous as had those of the crocodile.    Next the Yookoohoo went about touching all the lizards and toads, and  at her touch they became kittens. The rats she changed into chipmunks.  Now the only horrid creatures remaining were the four great spiders,  which hid themselves behind their thick webs.    \"There!\" Reera cried, \"now my cottage presents a more comfortable  appearance. I love the toads and lizards and rats, because most people  hate them, but I would tire of them if they always remained the same.  Sometimes I change their forms a dozen times a day.\"    \"You are clever,\" said Ervic. \"I did not hear you utter any  incantations or magic words. All you did was to touch the creatures.\"    \"Oh, do you think so?\" she replied. \"Well, touch them yourself, if you  like, and see if you can change their forms.\"    \"No,\" said the Skeezer, \"I don't understand magic and if I did I would  not try to imitate your skill. You are a wonderful Yookoohoo, while I  am only a common Skeezer.\"    This confession seemed to please Reera, who liked to have her  witchcraft appreciated.    \"Will you go away now?\" she asked. \"I prefer to be alone.\"    \"I prefer to stay here,\" said Ervic.    \"In another person's home, where you are not wanted?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Is not your curiosity yet satisfied?\" demanded Reera, with a smile.    \"I don't know. Is there anything else you can do?\"    \"Many things. But why should I exhibit my powers to a stranger?\"    \"I can think of no reason at all,\" he replied.    She looked at him curiously.    \"You want no power for yourself, you say, and you're too stupid to be  able to steal my secrets. This isn't a pretty cottage, while outside  are sunshine, broad prairies and beautiful wildflowers. Yet you insist  on sitting on that bench and annoying me with your unwelcome presence.  What have you in that "]]]
