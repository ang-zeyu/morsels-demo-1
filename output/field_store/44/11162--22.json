And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest  come in unto me?    01:038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she  said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?    01:038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy  signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he  gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.    01:038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,  and put on the garments of her widowhood.    01:038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the  Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found  her not.    01:038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the  harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no  harlot in this place.    01:038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and  also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.    01:038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:  behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.    01:038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was  told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot;  and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring  her forth, and let her be burnt.    01:038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,  saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said,  Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and  staff.    01:038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more  righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he  knew her again no more.    01:038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,  twins were in her womb.    01:038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out  his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread,  saying, This came out first.    01:038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,  his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this  breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.    01:038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet  thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.    01:039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an  officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the  hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.    01:039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man;  and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.    01:039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the  LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.    01:039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and  he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his  hand.    01:039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him  overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed  the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was  upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.    01:039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not  ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly  person, and well favoured.    01:039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's  wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.    01:039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my  master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed  all that he hath to my hand;    01:039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he  kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how  then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?    01:039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that  he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.    01:039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into  the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house  there within.    01:039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and  he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.    01:039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his  garment in her hand, and was fled forth,    01:039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto  them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he  came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:    01:039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice  and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.    01:039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.    01:039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The  Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock  me:    01:039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that  he left his garment with me, and fled out.    01:039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his  wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy  servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.    01:039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a  place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the  prison.    01:039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave  him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.    01:039:022 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all  the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he  was the doer of it.    01:039:023 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was  under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did,  the LORD made it to prosper.    01:040:001 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of  the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of  Egypt.    01:040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against  the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.    01:040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the  guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.    01:040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he  served them: and they continued a season in ward.    01:040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in  one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the  butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the  prison.    01:040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon  them, and, behold, they were sad.    01:040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the  ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?    01:040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is  no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations  belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.    01:040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to  him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;    01:040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it  budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought  forth ripe grapes:    01:040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and  pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.    01:040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:  The three branches are three days:    01:040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and  restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into  his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.    01:040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew  kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and  bring me out of this house:    01:040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:  and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the  dungeon.    01:040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he  said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white  baskets on my head:    01:040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of  bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon  my head.    01:040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation  thereof: The three baskets are three days:    01:040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off  thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh  from off thee.    01:040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's  birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up  the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.    01:040:021 And he restored the chief"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8001"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 1: Genesis (#17)"],[1," they will             dwell with us.    01:034:024 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that             went out of the gate of his city; and every male was             circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.    01:034:025 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,             that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's             brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city             boldly, and slew all the males.    01:034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the             sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.    01:034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,             because they had defiled their sister.    01:034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and             that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,    01:034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their             wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the             house.    01:034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make             me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the             Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they             shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and             I shall be destroyed, I and my house.    01:034:031 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an             harlot?    01:035:001 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell             there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto             thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.    01:035:002 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with             him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be             clean, and change your garments:    01:035:003 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there             an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress,             and was with me in the way which I went.    01:035:004 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in             their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears;             and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.    01:035:005 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities             that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the             sons of Jacob.    01:035:006 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,             Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.    01:035:007 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:             because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the             face of his brother.    01:035:008 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath             Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called             Allonbachuth.    01:035:009 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of             Padanaram, and blessed him.    01:035:010 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not             be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he             called his name Israel.    01:035:011 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and             multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee,             and kings shall come out of thy loins;    01:035:012 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will             give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.    01:035:013 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with             him.    01:035:014 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with             him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering             thereon, and he poured oil thereon.    01:035:015 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with             him, Bethel.    01:035:016 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way             to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard             labour.    01:035:017 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the             midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son             also.    01:035:018 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she             died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called             him Benjamin.    01:035:019 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which             is Bethlehem.    01:035:020 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of             Rachel's grave unto this day.    01:035:021 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of             Edar.    01:035:022 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that             Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and             Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:    01:035:023 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and             Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:    01:035:024 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:    01:035:025 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:    01:035:026 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these             are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.    01:035:027 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city             of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.    01:035:028 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.    01:035:029 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto             his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and             Jacob buried him.    01:036:001 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.    01:036:002 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the             daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of             Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;    01:036:003 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.    01:036:004 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;    01:036:005 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are             the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of             Canaan.    01:036:006 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and             all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his             beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of             Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother             Jacob.    01:036:007 For their riches were more than that they might dwell             together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not             bear them because of their cattle.    01:036:008 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.    01:036:009 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the             Edomites in mount Seir:    01:036:010 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah             the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.    01:036:011 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam,             and Kenaz.    01:036:012 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to             Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.    01:036:013 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah,             and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.    01:036:014 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah             the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau             Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.    01:036:015 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the             firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke             Kenaz,    01:036:016 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes             that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons             of Adah.    01:036:017 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke             Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that             came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of             Bashemath Esau's wife.    01:036:018 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush,             duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of             Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.    01:036:019 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their             dukes.    01:036:020 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;             Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,    01:036:021 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the             Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.    01:036:022 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's             sister was Timna.    01:036:023 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath,             and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.    01:036:024 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah:             this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as             he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.    01:036:025 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah             the daughter of Anah.    01:036:026 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and             Ithran, and Cheran.    01:036:027 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.    01:036:028 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.    01:036:029 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke             Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,    01:036:030 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that             came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of"]]]
