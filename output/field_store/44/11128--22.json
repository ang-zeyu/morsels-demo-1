The dining-table was attended by Jenny; but an old  superintendent, a sort of female butler, stood by the sideboard, and  underwent the burden of bearing several reproofs from Mr. Oldbuck, and  inuendos, not so much marked, but not less cutting, from his sister.    The dinner was such as suited a professed antiquary, comprehending many  savoury specimens of Scottish viands, now disused at the tables of those  who affect elegance. There was the relishing Solan goose, whose smell is  so powerful that he is never cooked within doors. Blood-raw he proved to  be on this occasion, so that Oldbuck half threatened to throw the  greasy sea-fowl at the head of the negligent housekeeper, who acted as  priestess in presenting this odoriferous offering. But, by good-hap,  she had been most fortunate in the hotch-potch, which was unanimously  pronounced to be inimitable. \"I knew we should succeed here,\" said  Oldbuck exultingly, \"for Davie Dibble, the gardener (an old bachelor  like myself), takes care the rascally women do not dishonour our  vegetables. And here is fish and sauce, and crappit-heads--I acknowledge  our womankind excel in that dish--it procures them the pleasure of  scolding, for half an hour at least, twice a-week, with auld Maggy  Mucklebackit, our fish-wife. The chicken-pie, Mr. Lovel, is made after  a recipe bequeathed to me by my departed grandmother of happy memory--And  if you will venture on a glass of wine, you will find it worthy of  one who professes the maxim of King Alphonso of Castile,--Old wood to  burn--old books to read--old wine to drink--and old friends, Sir Arthur--ay,  Mr. Lovel, and young friends too, to converse with.\"    \"And what news do you bring us from Edinburgh, Monkbarns?\" said Sir  Arthur; \"how wags the world in Auld Reekie?\"    \"Mad, Sir Arthur, mad--irretrievably frantic--far beyond dipping in the  sea, shaving the crown, or drinking hellebore. The worst sort of frenzy,  a military frenzy, hath possessed man, woman, and child.\"    \"And high time, I think,\" said Miss Wardour, \"when we are threatened  with invasion from abroad and insurrection at home.\"    \"O, I did not doubt you would join the scarlet host against me--women,  like turkeys, are always subdued by a red rag--But what says Sir Arthur,  whose dreams are of standing armies and German oppression?\"    \"Why, I say, Mr. Oldbuck,\" replied the knight, \"that so far as I am  capable of judging, we ought to resist cum toto corpore regni--as the  phrase is, unless I have altogether forgotten my Latin--an enemy who  comes to propose to us a Whiggish sort of government, a republican  system, and who is aided and abetted by a sort of fanatics of the worst  kind in our own bowels. I have taken some measures, I assure you, such  as become my rank in the community; for I have directed the constables  to take up that old scoundrelly beggar, Edie Ochiltree, for spreading  disaffection against church and state through the whole parish. He said  plainly to old Caxon, that Willie Howie's Kilmarnock cowl covered more  sense than all the three wigs in the parish--I think it is easy to make  out that inuendo--But the rogue shall be taught better manners.\"    \"O no, my dear sir,\" exclaimed Miss Wardour, \"not old Edie, that we have  known so long;--I assure you no constable shall have my good graces that  executes such a warrant.\"    \"Ay, there it goes,\" said the Antiquary; \"you, to be a staunch Tory, Sir  Arthur, have nourished a fine sprig of Whiggery in your bosom--Why,  Miss Wardour is alone sufficient to control a whole quarter-session--a  quarter-session? ay, a general assembly or convocation to boot--a  Boadicea she--an Amazon, a Zenobia.\"    \"And yet, with all my courage, Mr. Oldbuck, I am glad to hear our people  are getting under arms.\"    \"Under arms, Lord love thee! didst thou ever read the history of Sister  Margaret, which flowed from a head, that, though now old and somedele  grey, has more sense and political intelligence than you find now-a-days  in the whole synod? Dost thou remember the Nurse's dream in that  exquisite work, which she recounts in such agony to Hubble Bubble?--When  she would have taken up a piece of broad-cloth in her vision, lo! it  exploded like a great iron cannon; when she put out her hand to save a  pirn, it perked up in her face in the form of a pistol. My own vision in  Edinburgh has been something similar. I called to consult my lawyer; he  was clothed in a dragoon's dress, belted and casqued, and about to mount  a charger, which his writing-clerk (habited as a sharp-shooter) walked  to and fro before his door. I went to scold my agent for having sent me  to advise with a madman; he had stuck into his head the plume, which  in more sober days he wielded between his fingers, and figured as an  artillery officer. My mercer had his spontoon in his hand, as if he  measured his cloth by that implement, instead of a legitimate yard. The  banker's clerk, who was directed to sum my cash-account, blundered  it three times, being disordered by the recollection of his military  tellings-off at the morning-drill. I was ill, and sent for a surgeon--                   He came--but valour so had fired his eye,                 And such a falchion glittered on his thigh,                 That, by the gods, with such a load of steel,                I thought he came to murder,--not to heal.    I had recourse to a physician, but he also was practising a more  wholesale mode of slaughter than that which his profession had been  supposed at all times to open to him. And now, since I have returned  here, even our wise neighbours of Fairport have caught the same valiant  humour. I hate a gun like a hurt wild duck--I detest a drum like a  quaker;--and they thunder and rattle out yonder upon the town's common,  so that every volley and roll goes to my very heart.\"    \"Dear brother, dinna speak that gate o' the gentlemen volunteers--I am  sure they have a most becoming uniform--Weel I wot they have been wet to  the very skin twice last week--I met them marching in terribly doukit, an  mony a sair hoast was amang them--And the trouble they take, I am sure it  claims our gratitude.\"    \"And I am sure,\" said Miss M'Intyre, \"that my uncle sent twenty guineas  to help out their equipments.\"    \"It was to buy liquorice and sugar-candy,\" said the cynic, \"to encourage  the trade of the place, and to refresh the throats of the officers who  had bawled themselves hoarse in the service of their country.\"    \"Take care, Monkbarns! we shall set you down among the black-nebs by and  by.\"    \"No Sir Arthur--a tame grumbler I. I only claim the privilege of croaking  in my own corner here, without uniting my throat to the grand chorus of  the marsh--Ni quito Rey, ni pongo Rey--I neither make king nor mar king,  as Sancho says, but pray heartily for our own sovereign, pay scot and  lot, and grumble at the exciseman--But here comes the ewe-milk cheese in  good time; it is a better digestive than politics.\"    When dinner was over, and the decanters placed on the table, Mr. Oldbuck  proposed the King's health in a bumper, which was readily acceded to  both by Lovel and the Baronet, the Jacobitism of the latter being now a  sort of speculative opinion merely,--the shadow of a shade.    After the ladies had left the apartment, the landlord and Sir Arthur  entered into several exquisite discussions, in which the younger guest,  either on account of the abstruse erudition which they involved, or  for some other reason, took but a slender share, till at length he was  suddenly started out of a profound reverie by an unexpected appeal to  his judgment.    \"I will stand by what Mr. Lovel says; he was born in the north of  England, and may know the very spot.\"    Sir Arthur thought it unlikely that so young a gentleman should have  paid much attention to matters of that sort.    \"I am avised of the contrary,\" said Oldbuck.    \"How say you, Mr. Lovel?--speak up for your own credit, man.\"    Lovel was obliged to confess himself in the ridiculous situation of one  alike ignorant of the subject of conversation and controversy which had  engaged the company for an hour.    \"Lord help the lad, his head has been wool-gathering!--I thought how it  would be when the womankind were admitted--no getting a word of sense out  of a young fellow for six hours after.--Why, man, there was once a people  called the Piks\"--    \"More properly Picts,\" interrupted the Baronet.    \"I say the Pikar, Pihar, Piochtar, Piaghter, or Peughtar,\" vociferated  Oldbuck; \"they spoke a Gothic dialect\"--    \"Genuine Celtic,\" again asseverated the knight.    \"Gothic! Gothic! I'll go to death upon it!\" counter-asseverated the  squire.    \"Why, gentlemen,\" sad Lovel, \"I conceive that is a dispute which may  be easily settled by philologists, if there are any remains of the  language.\"    \"There is but one word,\" said the Baronet, \"but, in spite of Mr.  Oldbuck's pertinacity, it is decisive of the question.\"    \"Yes, in my favour,\" said Oldbuck: \"Mr. Lovel, you shall be judge--I have  the learned Pinkerton on my side.\"    \"I, on mine, the indefatigable and erudite Chalmers.\"    \"Gordon comes into my opinion.\"    \"Sir Robert Sibbald holds mine.\"    \"Innes is with me!\" vociferated Oldbuck.    \"Riston has no doubt!\" shouted the Baronet.    \"Truly, gentlemen,\" said Lovel, \"before you muster your forces and  overwhelm me with authorities, I should like to know the word in  dispute.\"    \"Benval\" said both the disputants at once.    \"Which signifies caput valli,\" said Sir Arthur.    \"The head of the wall,\" echoed Oldbuck.    There was a deep pause.--\"It is rather a narrow foundation to build a  hypothesis upon,\" observed the arbiter.    \"Not a whit, not a whit,\" said Oldbuck; \"men fight best in a narrow  ring--an inch is as good as a mile for a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7010"],[0,"Graded Lessons in English (#17)"],[1,"clauses.

We suggest that other selections from literature be made and these  exercises continued.          MODIFICATIONS OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH.      LESSON 78.    NOUNS AND PRONOUNS.    You have learned that two words may express a thought, and that the thought  may be varied by adding modifying words. You are now to learn that the  meaning or use of a word may sometimes be changed by simply changing its  _form_. The English language has lost many of its inflections, or forms, so  that frequently changes in the meaning and use of words are not marked by  changes in form. These _changes_ in the _form, meaning_, and _use_ of the  parts of speech, we call their +Modifications+.    _The boy shouts. The boys shout_. I have changed the form of the subject  _boy_ by adding an _s_ to it. The meaning has changed. _Boy_ denotes _one_  lad; _boys_, _two or more_ lads. This change in the form and meaning of  nouns is called +Number+. The word _boy_, denoting one thing, is in the  +Singular Number;+ and _boys_, denoting more than one thing, is in the  +Plural Number+.    Let the teacher write other nouns on the board, and require the pupils to  form the plural of them.      DEFINITIONS.    +_Modifications of the Parts of Speech_ are changes in their form, meaning,  and use+.    NUMBER.    +_Number_ is that modification of a noun or pronoun which denotes one thing  or more than one+.    +The _Singular Number_ denotes one thing+.    +The _Plural Number_ denotes more than one thing+.    +RULE.--The _plural_ of nouns is regularly formed by adding _s_ to the  singular+.      Write the plural of the following nouns.      Tree, bird, insect, cricket, grasshopper, wing, stick, stone, flower,    meadow, pasture, grove, worm, bug, cow, eagle, hawk, wren, plough,    shovel.    When a singular noun ends in the sound of _s, x, z, sh_, or _ch_, it is not  easy to add the sound of _s_, so _es_ is added to make another syllable.    Write the plural of the following nouns.      Guess, box, topaz, lash, birch, compass, fox, waltz, sash, bench, gas,    tax, adz, brush, arch.    Many nouns ending in _o_ preceded by a consonant form the plural by adding  _es_ without increasing the number of syllables.    Write the plural of the following nouns.      Hero, cargo, negro, potato, echo, volcano, mosquito, motto.    Common nouns ending in _y_ preceded by a consonant form the plural by  changing _y_ into _i_ and adding _es_ without increasing the number of  syllables.    Write the plural of the following nouns.      Lady, balcony, family, city, country, daisy, fairy, cherry, study, sky.    Some nouns ending in _f_ and _fe_ form the plural by changing _f_ or _fe_  into _ves_ without increasing the number of syllables.    Write the plural of the following nouns.      Sheaf, loaf, beef, thief, calf, half, elf, shelf, self, wolf, life,    knife, wife.          LESSON 79.    NUMBER.    From the following list of nouns, select, and write in separate columns:  1st. Those that have no plural; 2d. Those that have no singular; 3d. Those  that are alike in both numbers.      Pride, wages, trousers, cider, suds, victuals, milk, riches, flax,    courage, sheep, deer, flour, idleness, tidings, thanks, ashes, scissors,    swine, heathen.    The following nouns have very irregular plurals. Learn to spell the  plurals.    _Singular.   Plural.     Singular.   Plural_.   Man,        men.        Foot,       feet.   Woman,      women.      Ox,         oxen.   Child,      children.   Tooth,      teeth.   Mouse,      mice.       Goose,      geese.      Learn the following plurals and compare them with the groups in the  preceding Lesson.      Moneys, flies, chimneys, valleys, stories, berries, lilies, turkeys,    monkeys, cuckoos, pianos, vetoes, solos, folios, gulfs, chiefs, leaves,    roofs, scarfs, inches.          LESSON 80.    NOUNS AND PRONOUNS.--GENDER.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--_The lion was caged. The lioness was caged_.  In the first sentence, something was said about a _male_ lion; and in the  second, something was said about a _female_ lion. Modifications of the noun  to denote the sex of the object, we call +Gender+. Knowing the sex of the  object, you know the gender of its name. The word _lion_, denoting a male  animal, is in the +Masculine Gender;+ and _lioness_, denoting a female  lion, is in the +Feminine Gender+.    The names of things _without_ sex are in the +Neuter Gender+.    Such words as _cousin, child, friend, neighbor_, may be _either masculine  or feminine_.      +DEFINITIONS.    _Gender_ is that modification of a noun or pronoun which denotes sex.    The _Masculine Gender_ denotes the male sex.    The _Feminine Gender_ denotes the female sex.    The _Neuter Gender_ denotes want of sex+.    The masculine is distinguished from the feminine in three ways:--    1st. By a difference in the ending of the nouns.    2d. By different words in the compound names.    3d. By words wholly or radically different.    Arrange the following pairs in separate columns with reference to these  ways.      Abbot, abbess; actor, actress; Francis, Frances; Jesse, Jessie; bachelor,    maid; beau, belle; monk, nun; gander, goose; administrator,    administratrix; baron, baroness; count, countess; czar, czarina; don,    donna; boy, girl; drake, duck; lord, lady; nephew, niece; landlord,    landlady; gentleman, gentlewoman; peacock, peahen; duke, duchess; hero,    heroine; host, hostess; Jew, Jewess; man-servant, maid-servant; sir,    madam; wizard, witch; marquis, marchioness; widow, widower; heir,    heiress; Paul, Pauline; Augustus, Augusta.    REVIEW QUESTIONS.    What new way of varying the meaning of words is introduced in Lesson 78?  Illustrate. What are modifications of the parts of speech? What is number?  How many numbers are there? Name and define each. Give the rule for forming  the plural of nouns. Illustrate the variations of this rule. What is  gender? How many genders are there? Name and define each. In how many ways  are the genders distinguished? Illustrate.          LESSON 81.    NOUNS AND PRONOUNS.--PERSON AND CASE.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--_Number_ and _gender_, as you have already  learned, are modifications affecting the _meaning_ of nouns and pronouns.  Number is almost always indicated by the ending; gender, sometimes. There  are two other modifications which refer not to changes in the _meaning_ of  nouns and pronouns, but to their different _uses_ and _relations_. In the  English language, these changes are not often indicated by a change of  _form_.    _I Paul_ have written. _Paul, thou_ art beside thyself. _He_ brought _Paul_  before Agrippa. In these three sentences the word _Paul_ has _three  different uses_. In the first, it is used as the name of the _speaker_; in  the second, as the name of _one spoken to_; in the third, as the name of  _one spoken of_. You will notice that the _form_ of the noun was not  changed. This change in the use of nouns and pronouns is called +Person+.  The word _I_ in the first sentence, the word _thou_ in the second, and the  word _he_ in the third have each a different use. _I_, _thou_, and _he_ are  personal pronouns, and, as you have learned, distinguish _person_ by their  _form_. _I_, denoting the speaker, is in the +First Person+; _thou_,  denoting the one spoken to, is in the +Second Person+; and _he_, denoting  the one spoken of, is in the +Third Person+.    _Personal pronouns_ and _verbs_ are the only words that distinguish person  by their form.    _The bear killed the man_. _The man killed the bear_. _The bear's grease  was made into hair oil_. In the first sentence, the bear is represented as  _performing_ an action; in the second, as _receiving_ an action; in the  third, as _possessing_ something. So the word _bear_ in these sentences has  three different uses. These uses of nouns are called +Cases+. The use of a  noun as subject is called the +Nominative Case+; its use as object is  called the +Objective Case+; and its use to denote possession is called the  +Possessive Case+.    The _possessive_ is the only case of nouns that is indicated by a change in  _form_.    A noun or pronoun used as an _attribute_ complement is in the _nominative  case_. A noun or"]]]
