It is not for me  here to enter into the history of my past life; neither will I tarnish  the hitherto unsullied reputation of my family by disclosing my true  name. Suffice it to observe, I am a gentleman by birth; and although,  of late years, I have known all the hardships and privations attendant  on my fallen fortunes, I was once used to bask in the luxuries of  affluence, and to look upon those who now preside in judgment over me  as my equals. A marriage of affection,--a marriage with one who had  nothing but her own virtues and her own beauty to recommend her, drew  upon me the displeasure of my family, and the little I possessed,  independently of the pleasure of my relations, was soon dissipated. My  proud soul scorned all thought of supplication to those who had  originally spurned my wife from their presence; and yet my heart bled  for the privations of her who, alike respectable in family, was, both  from sex and the natural delicacy, of her frame, so far less  constituted to bear up against the frowns of adversity than myself. Our  extremity had now become great,--too great for human endurance; when,  through the medium of the public prints, I became acquainted with the  glorious action that had been fought in this country by the army under  General Wolfe. A new light burst suddenly upon my mind, and visions of  after prosperity constantly presented themselves to my view. The field  of honour was open before me, and there was a probability I might, by  good conduct, so far merit the approbation of my superiors, as to  obtain, in course of time, that rank among themselves to which by birth  and education I was so justly entitled to aspire. Without waiting to  consult my Ellen, whose opposition I feared to encounter until  opposition would be fruitless, I hastened to Lieutenant Walgrave, the  recruiting officer of the regiment,--tendered my services,--was  accepted and approved,--received the bounty money,--and became  definitively a soldier, under the assumed name of Frank Halloway.    \"It would be tedious and impertinent, gentlemen,\" resumed the prisoner,  after a short pause, \"to dwell on the humiliations of spirit to which  both my wife and myself were subjected at our first introduction to our  new associates, who, although invariably kind to us, were,  nevertheless, ill suited, both by education and habit, to awaken any  thing like congeniality of feeling or similarity of pursuit. Still we  endeavoured, as much as possible, to lessen the distance that existed  between us; and from the first moment of our joining the regiment,  determined to adopt the phraseology and manners of those with whom an  adverse destiny had so singularly connected us. In this we succeeded;  for no one, up to the present moment, has imagined either my wife or  myself to be other than the simple and unpretending Frank and Ellen  Halloway.    \"On joining the regiment in this country,\" pursued the prisoner, after  another pause, marked by much emotion, \"I had the good fortune to be  appointed to the grenadier company. Gentlemen, you all know the amiable  qualities of Captain de Haldimar. But although, unlike yourselves, I  have learnt to admire that officer only at a distance, my devotion to  his interests has been proportioned to the kindness with which I have  ever been treated by him; and may I not add, after this avowal of my  former condition, my most fervent desire has all along been to seize  the first favourable opportunity of performing some action that would  eventually elevate me to a position in which I might, without blushing  for the absence of the ennobling qualities of birth and condition, avow  myself his friend, and solicit that distinction from my equal which was  partially extended to me by my superior? The opportunity I sought was  not long wanting. At the memorable affair with the French general,  Levi, at Quebec, in which our regiment bore so conspicuous a part, I  had the good fortune to save the life of my captain. A band of Indians,  as you all, gentlemen, must recollect, had approached our right flank  unperceived, and while busily engaged with the French in front, we were  compelled to divide our fire between them and our new and fierce  assailants. The leader of that band was a French officer, who seemed  particularly to direct his attempts against the life of Captain de  Haldimar. He was a man of powerful proportions and gigantic stature--\"    \"Hold!\" said the governor, starting suddenly from the seat in which he  had listened with evident impatience to this long outline of the  prisoner's history. \"Gentlemen,\" addressing the court, \"that is the  very stranger who was in my apartment last night,--the being with whom  the prisoner is evidently in treacherous correspondence, and all this  absurd tale is but a blind to deceive your judgment, and mitigate his  own punishment. Who is there to prove the man he has just described was  the same who aimed at Captain de Haldimar's life at Quebec?\"    A flush of deep indignation overspread the features of the prisoner,  whose high spirit, now he had avowed his true origin, could ill brook  the affront thus put upon his veracity.    \"Colonel de Haldimar!\" he proudly replied, while his chains clanked  with the energy and force with which he drew up his person into an  attitude of striking dignity; \"for once I sink the private soldier, and  address you in the character of the gentleman and your equal. I have a  soul, Sir, notwithstanding my fallen fortunes, as keenly alive to  honour as your own; and not even to save my wretched life, would I be  guilty of the baseness you now attribute to me. You have asked,\" he  pursued, in a more solemn tone, \"what proof I have to show this  individual to be the same who attempted the life of Captain de  Haldimar. To Captain de Haldimar himself, should Providence have spared  his days, I shall leave the melancholy task of bearing witness to all I  here advance, when I shall be no more. Nay, Sir,\" and his look partook  at once of mingled scorn and despondency, \"well do I know the fate that  awaits me; for in these proceedings--in that third charge--I plainly  read my death-warrant. But what, save my poor and wretched wife, have I  to regret? Colonel de Haldimar,\" he continued, with a vehemence meant  to check the growing weakness which the thought of his unfortunate  companion called up to his heart, \"I saved the life of your son, even  by your own admission, no matter whose the arm that threatened his  existence; and in every other action in which I have been engaged,  honourable mention has ever been made of my conduct. Now, Sir, I ask  what has been my reward? So far from attending to the repeated  recommendations of my captain for promotion, even in a subordinate  rank, have you once deemed it necessary to acknowledge my services by  even a recognition of them in any way whatever?\"    \"Mr. President, Captain Blessington,\" interrupted the governor,  haughtily, \"are we met here to listen to such language from a private  soldier? You will do well, Sir, to exercise your prerogative, and stay  such impertinent matter, which can have no reference whatever to the  defence of the prisoner.\"    \"Prisoner,\" resumed the president, who, as well as the other members of  the court, had listened with the most profound and absorbing interest  to the singular disclosure of him whom they still only knew as Frank  Halloway, \"this language cannot be permitted; you must confine yourself  to your defence.\"    \"Pardon me, gentlemen,\" returned Halloway, in his usual firm but  respectful tone of voice; \"pardon me, if, standing on the brink of the  grave as I do, I have so far forgotten the rules of military discipline  as to sink for a moment the soldier in the gentleman; but to be taxed  with an unworthy fabrication, and to be treated with contumely when  avowing the secret of my condition, was more than human pride and human  feeling could tolerate.\"    \"Confine yourself, prisoner, to your defence,\" again remarked Captain  Blessington, perceiving the restlessness with which the governor  listened to these bold and additional observations of Halloway.    Again the governor interposed:--\"What possible connexion can there be  between this man's life, and the crime with which he stands charged?  Captain Blessington, this is trifling with the court, who are assembled  to try the prisoner for his treason, and not to waste their time in  listening to a history utterly foreign to the subject.\"    \"The history of my past life--Colonel de Haldimar,\" proudly returned  the prisoner, \"although tedious and uninteresting to you, is of the  utmost importance to myself; for on that do I ground the most essential  part of my defence. There is nothing but circumstantial evidence  against me on the two first charges; and as those alone can reflect  dishonour on my memory, it is for the wisdom of this court to determine  whether that evidence is to be credited in opposition to the solemn  declaration of him, who, in admitting one charge, equally affecting his  life with the others, repudiates as foul those only which would attaint  his honour. Gentlemen,\" he pursued, addressing the court, \"it is for  you to determine whether my defence is to be continued or not; yet,  whatever be my fate, I would fain remove all injurious impression from  the minds of my judges; and this can only be done by a simple detail of  circumstances, which may, by the unprejudiced, be as simply believed.\"    Here the prisoner paused: when, after some low and earnest conversation  among the members of the court, two or three slips of written paper  were passed to the President. He glanced his eye hurriedly over them,  and then directed Halloway to proceed with his defence.    \"I have stated,\" pursued the interesting soldier, \"that the officer who  led the band of Indians was a man of gigantic stature, and of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49131"],[0,"Wings over England (#17)"],[1,"appeared a light that  was like the bursting of the sun. A flare beyond a doubt, but such a  flare as had never before been seen. Every housetop, turret and tower  stood out in bold relief. Beneath the flare, but far up in that sky,  like a gigantic silver bird, a four-motored Nazi bomber appeared to hang  motionless.    As the watchers stared speechless something very like a silver bat  appeared to drop straight down from the sky.    \"It's a Spitfire,\" muttered one hardy watcher.    \"An' it's suicide,\" exclaimed his mate.    As the silver bat curved down toward the bomber it let out a sound as of  the ripping up of every sidewalk in London.    At this every watcher threw himself flat on his face, for from above  came such a roar as had never been heard before, no, not even in London.    A moment more and fragments of metal came showering down far and wide.    The flare above was still burning. One watcher, braver than the rest,  scanned the sky. What he saw was a pair of balloons belonging to a  balloon barrage, a trap set for enemy planes. Between the balloons ran  cables that in this strange light shone like threads of silver. The  thing that caught and held the watcher's eye was a silver spot clinging  to those cables.    \"That will be the Spitfire,\" he said to his mate who now was sitting up.  \"The blast from that exploded bomber blew him there. I told you it was  suicide. I said--    \"And now may the Saints be praised!\" His voice rose as he turned his  eyes. Some distance below that silver spot a ghost-like circle had  appeared.    \"A parachute!\" the watcher exclaimed. \"And may the Nazis be confounded!  That pilot of the Spitfire is still alive.\"    \"You're quite right, Tim, me boy,\" the other agreed. \"What's more, if I  judge the movement of air rightly, he'll be landin' just about here.\"    The roof on which the men stood was broad and flat. As the two men  watched, the parachute and the dark spot hanging beneath it, which  appeared to be the pilot, grew in size. Carried first to the right, then  to the left, as if directed by the very breath of the Gods, it came ever  closer to that broad rooftop on which the watchers stood.    \"Sure he's alive,\" Tim murmured. \"I saw his arm move.\"    \"He--he's almost down now,\" muttered his companion. \"There now, he--\"  Breaking short off the speaker dashed for the far side of the roof.    Just as the daring aviator's feet touched the roof a sudden, violent  gust of wind caught his parachute and sent it skyward. Lifting him off  his feet, it carried him forward at a rapid rate. Then, as if to  complete its work of destruction, over empty space the parachute  collapsed.    The parachutist found himself balanced on the parapet, leaning back with  all his might, but apparently doomed to crash to the earth a hundred  feet below. Then, of a sudden, a voice said:    \"Here, young man, where y' think y're goin'?\"    A pair of husky arms were wrapped about him and he was dragged to  safety. His savior was Tim's powerful companion.    \"Why, you're little more than a boy!\" The big man exclaimed after  peering into the rescued one's face.    \"I'm more than that,\" the youth replied huskily. \"If I were to tell you  who I really am you might be a little surprised. But I'm not telling.\"    \"Whoever you are,\" said Tim with a wave of his strong arms, \"you're a  darling of the gods. What you done tonight no other man could do an'  live.\"    \"What's more,\" Tim's partner added, \"you've saved the life of many a  woman an' child. There was two tons of bombs in that big ship an' she  was 'angin' over blocks an' blocks of tenements. It was early. The first  alarm had 'ardly sounded. They don't get to the subway that quick, the  women an' the children, they don't.\"    The young flyer was pulling at his chute. It caught and tore. \"Here,\" he  exclaimed impatiently, handing the strings to the big guard, \"take this  home to your Missus. There's some fine silk in it. And now how do you  get down from this place?\"    \"It's right over 'ere,\" said the astonished Tim as he led the way to a  trap door. \"You just go down that stairway. There's a door at the  bottom. You'll find stairways leadin' to the ground floor an' the back  outside door's got a spring lock. Spring it an' you're outside.    \"An' 'ere's wishin' ye luck,\" the big man added. \"'Ow about shakin' your  hand?\" Two hands met in a hearty grip. \"'Ere's 'opin' we meets again,\"  said the watcher.    Five minutes later the mysterious flyer reached the good earth once  again to lose himself at once in the avenues of darkness that are London  in the blackout.                                        _Chapter_ XX                          Dave Comes Marching Home      Next morning Brand, whose time schedule for the day included only a  short practice flight in the afternoon, asked permission to cycle over  to the Hideout in time for breakfast. Still terribly upset by the losses  of yesterday he wished to be among his own people.    While breakfast was preparing he told of the sad misadventures resulting  from their first patrol flight.    \"Bad business,\" he murmured at the end. \"The Fiddler gone, Dave gone,  soon our flight will be at an end.    \"But we'll fight!\" His voice picked up. \"We'll fight to the last man.\"    For a time after that all were silent. Then Cherry asked, \"Brand, did  you hear the late news broadcast last night?\"    \"No. What was up?\"    \"The strangest thing happened. It sounds like a miracle. A bright flare,  brightest ever seen, hung over a bomber ready to help destroy London,  when a single Spitfire plunging down, down, down, loosed a burst of fire  at the bomber. Then came a terrible explosion in midair.\" \"Got him!\"  Brand's eyes shone. \"But the Spitfire?\"    \"He was blown against a balloon cable. He baled out. He landed on a  roof. Then he vanished. Who does that sound like?\"    \"Like Fiddlin' Johnny,\" Brand whispered. \"But the Fiddler is dead and so  is--\"    He did not finish for at that moment the door opened. Cherry, who stood  facing the door, let out a hoarse whispering cry, then barely missed  throwing herself in the new-comer's arms.    \"Careful, Cherry,\" said a calm voice. \"I've had a lot of trouble and a  heap of luck these last hours. I couldn't stand much more.\" It was Dave.    \"Dave! Are you really alive?\" It was Alice who asked this remarkable  question.    \"Why--yes. I--I think so.\" Dave looked from one to the other across the  room. \"At least that's the way I like to feel about it.\" At this they  all burst into a merry laugh and somehow life seemed to begin all over  again.    \"Tell us about it, Dave,\" Cherry commanded.    \"Wait. I'll have to phone headquarters.\" Dave looked about for a phone.  Then he remembered, there was no phone in the Hideout.    \"We've had the phone down at the house repaired,\" Alice said.    \"I--I'll be back for a cup of coffee.\" Dave was away on the run.                                * * * * * * * *    At that moment the Commander at the airdrome had just dropped to a place  beside the young Lord in the squadron mess room.    \"Applegate,\" he said soberly, \"why did you do it?\"    \"I had to.\" There was a stubborn look on the young Lord's usually  cheerful face.    \"Why?\" The Commander's eyes were on him.    \"It got on my nerves, those Jerries bombing women and children every  night and nothing being done about it.\" The young Lord did not look up.    \"So you decided to commit suicide by doing something?\" The Commander's  voice was low.    \"Well, I'm here.\" A smile played about Applegate's lips.    \"But you wouldn't be again. Not one time in a million. Wars are not won  that way.    \"Look here, Applegate,\" the Commander's voice softened a little. \"I've  always liked you, been proud of you. You were not raised like the rest  of us. When the war came you joined up and you've played your part like  a man.    \"This fighting in the air is different.\" The Commander paused to look  away. \"It's a little like the old days that Walter Scott wrote about,  Ivanhoe, Kenilworth, Richard the Lionhearted, all that. Each man got him  a sword and fought it out with the first enemy he met.    \"It's the same here in a way. You can't always fight in formation. But  you _do_ have to fight under orders. You must, I must, everyone but the  King must. And he's not so free either.    \"Last night,\" his voice fell, \"you took your ship without orders and did  a stretch over London. Why?\"    \"I--I couldn't stand myself.\" The young Lord's head was bowed. \"Going  out with five men, coming back with three. Not getting the man I was  after. Losing the fellows we all love. What kind of fighting is that?\"    \"It comes to all of us.\" The commander's voice was gentle now. \"Once  over in France--    \"Wait!\" He sprang up. \"There's the phone.\"    In the corner the young Lord heard the Commander exclaim into the  receiver, \"What? Who? Say! That's great! How's that? Yes. Certainly. As  long as you like.\"    The Commander's voice was deep with emotion as turning back to the young  Lord he said:    \"That was Dave. He's back safe. He's over at Ramsey Farm. They're just  having their biscuits, marmalade and coffee. Want you to join them.\"    The young Lord stood up. He tried to speak but failed. With a bow and a  salute he left the room. Three minutes later his big car was burning up  the road leading to Ramsey Farm.                                       _Chapter_ XXI                       The Lark Defends His Home Town      It was truly a jolly party that sat down to breakfast in the Hideout  that morning. Dave had been dead. Now he was alive again. Who could help  being happy? It seemed good to be together again, to laugh over recent  adventures and to talk in serious tones of the future.    \"There really isn't so much to tell,\" Dave insisted, when they pressed  him for his story. \"I had luck, that was all.\"    He told of his landing, the sinking of his plane, his discovery of the  Nazi's float and his work at setting it"]]]
