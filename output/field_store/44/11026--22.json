So intolerable at last became the persecution about Manchester that  Joseph decided to move with his wife to the home of her parents in  Harmony, Susquehannah county, Pennsylvania. Susquehannah county is one  of the northern counties of Pennsylvania, and joins Broome county, in  the state of New York; and Harmony is a distance of from one hundred  to one hundred and fifty miles from Manchester, New York. The young  Prophet was in very straitened circumstances when he resolved upon  removing to Pennsylvania; but about that time a Mr. Martin Harris, a  respectable and well-to-do farmer of Palmyra, New York, called upon  the Smith family and gave Joseph fifty dollars to enable him to make  the proposed journey. A team and wagon was fitted out, and in company  with his wife the Prophet started for Pennsylvania. Enroute he was  twice stopped by officers of the law, who, under the power of a search  warrant, ransacked his wagon in search of the plates, but in each case  they were disappointed, as they did not find them, though the prophet  had them concealed among his effects.    Arriving in Pennsylvania in the month of December, the Prophet began  an examination of the characters engraven upon the plates and copied  a considerable number of them. Some of them he translated by means of  the Urim and Thummim. In this desultory work he spent the time until  the month of February, 1828, when Martin Harris, the gentleman who had  befriended him on the eve of his departure from Manchester, arrived at  his home in Harmony. This man had become interested in the Prophet and  his work and believed him to be in possession of the plates.    Some of the characters which Joseph had copied from the plates, Martin  Harris determined to submit to Professor Charles Anthon, \"a gentleman  of the highest reputation, both in America and Europe, and well known  for his valuable and correct edition of the classics.\" [2] For this  purpose Harris made the journey from Harmony, Pennsylvania, to the city  of New York. Some of the Nephite characters given into the custody  of Mr. Harris were translated while others were not. Following is a  facsimile of some of the characters handed to Professor Anthon in  fulfilment of the words of Isaiah:        \"The vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that      is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read      this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: and      the book is delivered to one that is not learned, saying, Read      this, I pray thee: and he saith I am not learned.\" (Isaiah 29:11,      12.)    [Facsimile of characters shown to Prof. Anton.] [3]    Whether or not these are the characters to which a translation was  appended by the Prophet, cannot now be determined.    With the printer's copy of the manuscript of the Book of Mormon, now in  the hands of the descendants of Joseph Smith, is also a transcript of  characters consisting of seven lines, the first three of which are very  similar to those copied from _The Prophet_. They were also handed, it  is claimed, to Doctor Mitchell and Professor Anthon by Martin Harris.  Whether this seven-line transcript was the translated or untranslated  part of the characters handed to these learned men for their inspection  may not now be determined; but I present them herewith in order that as  many of the Nephite characters as have been transcribed from the plates  may be before the reader:    [\"Caractors\" facsimile.]    The latter transcript is taken from a pamphlet by the late Elder Edward  Stevenson, of the First Council of Seventy, entitled _Reminiscences of  Joseph the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon_. Of  this transcript Elder Stevenson says:        \"I will vouch for the correctness of the characters, as I have      compared them with the original copy, which is still in existence,      intact, just as it was when Martin Harris, as a messenger, took it      with the translation Joseph Smith had made, to Professor Anthon      of New York. The copy here presented was traced from the original      copy, and is an exact reproduction of it.\" [4]    Of both these transcripts it should be said that doubtless inaccuracies  exist in them, for the reason that the Prophet who made the _fac  simile_ was unskillful in such work, but for all that the _fac simile_  of the characters will be of interest and may be of very great  importance yet as evidence for the truth of the claims of the Book of  Mormon.    On the return of Martin Harris to Harmony, he made the following  statement to Joseph Smith as to what took place between himself and  Professor Anthon:        \"I went to the city of New York, and presented the characters      which had been translated, with the translation thereof, to      Professor Charles Anthon, a gentleman celebrated for his literary      attainments. Professor Anthon stated that the translation was      correct, more so than any he had before seen translated from the      Egyptian. [5] I then showed him those which were not translated,      and he said that they were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, and      Arabic, and he said that they were the true characters. He gave me      a certificate, certifying to the people of Palmyra that they were      true characters, and that the translation of such of them as had      been translated was also correct. I took the certificate and put      it into my pocket, and was just leaving the house, when Mr. Anthon      called me back, and asked me how the young man found out that there      were gold plates in the place where he found them. I answered that      an angel of God had revealed it unto him.        \"He then said to me, 'Let me see that certificate.' I accordingly      took it out of my pocket and gave it to him, when he took it and      tore it to pieces, saying, that there was no such thing now as      ministering angels, and that if I would bring the plates to him,      he would translate them. I informed him that part of the plates      were sealed, and that I was forbidden to bring them. He replied, 'I      cannot read a sealed book.' I left him and went to Dr. Mitchell,      who sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the      characters and the translation.\" [6]    Some years after this, _viz._, in 1834, Professor Anthon, in a letter  to Mr. E. D. Howe, of Painesville, Ohio, made a statement as to what  took place on the occasion of Martin Harris' visit to him, and I  give that statement below. By way of introduction it should be said,  however, that Mr. E. D. Howe at the time (1834) was connected with a  Dr. Hurlburt in the production of an anti-\"Mormon\" book, and the report  of Harris' interview with the learned professor having become known,  Mr. Howe wrote to Professor Anthon making inquiries about it, hoping,  perhaps, that the fact of the interview might be denied. This is the  letter he received in reply to his inquiries:        New York, February 17, 1834.        _Dear Sir_: I received your letter of the 9th, and lose no time in      making a reply. The whole story about my pronouncing the Mormon      inscription to be reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics is perfectly      false. Some years ago, a plain, apparently simple-hearted farmer      called on me with a note from Dr. Mitchell, of our city, now dead,      requesting me to decipher, if possible, the paper which the farmer      would hand me. Upon examining the paper in question, I soon came      to the conclusion that it was all a trick--perhaps a hoax. When I      asked the person who brought it how he obtained the writing, he      gave me the following account: A gold book consisting of a number      of plates, fastened together by wires of the same material, had      been dug up in the northern part of the state of New York, and      along with it an enormous pair of spectacles. These spectacles      were so large that if a person attempted to look through them,      his two eyes would look through one glass only the spectacles in      question being altogether too large for the human face. \"Whoever,\"      he said, \"examined the plates through the glasses was enabled not      only to read them, but fully to understand their meaning.\" All this      knowledge, however, was confined to a young man, who had the trunk      containing the book and spectacles in his sole possession. This      young man was placed behind a curtain in a garret in a farmhouse,      and being thus concealed from view, he put on the spectacles      occasionally, or rather looked through one of the glasses,      deciphered the characters in the book, and having committed some of      them to paper, handed copies from behind the curtain to those who      stood outside. Not a word was said about their being deciphered by      the gift of God. Everything in this way was effected by the large      pair of spectacles. The farmer added that he had been requested      to contribute a sum of money toward the publication of the golden      book, the contents of which would, as he was told, produce an      entire change in the world, and save it from ruin. So urgent had      been these solicitations, that he intended selling his farm and      giving the amount to those who wished to publish the plates. As a      last precautionary step, he had resolved to come to New York,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4732"],[0,"Prolegomena to the History of Israel (#17)"],[1," effect.  All this  brings out, with as much clearness as could be desired, that  sacrifice is a very ancient and quite universal mode of honouring  the Deity, and that Israelite sacrifice is distinguished not by  the manner in which, but by the being to whom, it is offered, in  being offered to the God of Israel.  According to this  representation of the matter, Moses left the procedure in  sacrifice, as he left the procedure in prayer, to be regulated by  the traditional praxis; if there was any definite origination of  the cultus of Israel, the patriarchs must be thought of, but even  they were not the discoverers of the ritual; they were merely  the founders of those holy places at which the Israelites  dedicated gifts to Jehovah, a usage which was common to the whole  world.  The contrast with the Priestly Code is extremely  striking, for it is well known that the latter work makes mention  of no sacrificial act prior to the time of Moses, neither in  Genesis nor in Exodus, although from the time of Noah slaughtering  is permitted.  The offering of a sacrifice of sheep and oxen as the  occasion of the exodus is omitted, and in place of the sacrifice of  the firstlings we have the paschal lamb, which is slaughtered and  eaten without altar, without priest, and not in the presence of  Jehovah. /1/    *******************************************  1. With regard to sacrifice, Deuteronomy still occupies the same  standpoint as JE.  *******************************************    The belief that the cultus goes back to pre-Mosaic usage is  unquestionably more natural than the belief that it is the main  element of the Sinaitic legislation; the thought would be a  strange one that God should suddenly have revealed, or Moses  discovered and introduced, the proper sacrificial ritual.  At the  same time this does not necessitate the conclusion that the  Priestly Code is later than the Jehovist.  Nor does this follow  from the very elaborately-developed technique of the agenda, for  elaborate ritual may have existed in the great sanctuaries at a  very early period,--though that, indeed, would not prove it to be  genuinely Mosaic.  On the other hand, it is certainly a  consideration deserving of great weight that the representation of  the exclusive legitimacy of so definite a sacrificial ritual,  treated in the Priestly Code as the only possible one in Israel,  is one which can have arisen only as a consequence of the  centralisation of the cultus at Jerusalem.  Yet by urging this the  decision of the question at present before us would only be  referred back to the result already arrived at in the preceding  chapter, and it is much to be desired that it should be solved  independently, so as not to throw too much weight upon a single  support.    II.I.2.  In this case also the elements of a decision can only be  obtained from the historical documents dating from the pre-exilic  time,--the Books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings on the one hand, and  the writings of the prophets on the other.  As regards those of the  first class, they represent the cultus and sacrifice on all  occasions as occupying a large place in the life of the nation and  of the individual.  But, although it would be wrong to say that  absolutely no weight is attached to the RITE, it is certainly not  the fact that the main stress is laid upon it; the antithesis is  not between RITE and NON-RITE, but between sacrifice TO JEHOVAH and  sacrifice TO STRANGE GODS, the reverse of what we find in the  Priestly Code.  Alongside of splendid sacrifices, such as those of  the kings, presumably offered in accordance with all the rules of  priestly skill, there occur others also of the simplest and most  primitive type, as, for example, those of Saul (1Samuel xiv.35) and  Elisha (1Kings xix.2I); both kinds are proper if only they be  dedicated to the proper deity.  Apart from the exilian redaction of  the Book of Kings, which reckons the cultus outside of Jerusalem as  heretical, it is nowhere represented that a sacrifice could be  dedicated to the God of Israel, and yet be illegitimate. Naaman  (2Kings v. 17), it is to be supposed, followed his native Syrian  ritual, but this does not in the least impair the acceptability of  his offering.  For reasons easily explained, it is seldom that an  occasion arises to describe the ritual, but when such a description  is given it is only with violence that it can be forced into  accordance with the formula of the law.  Most striking of all is  the procedure of Gideon in Judges vi.19-21, in which it is manifest  that the procedure still usual at Ophrah in the time of the  narrator is also set forth.  Gideon boils a he-goat and bakes in  the ashes cakes of unleavened bread, places upon the bread the  flesh in a basket and the broth in a pot, and then the meal thus  prepared is burnt in the altar flame.  It is possible that  instances may have also occurred in which the rule of the  Pentateuch is followed, but the important point is that the  distinction between legitimate and heretical is altogether wanting.  When the Book of Chronicles is compared the difference is at once  perceived.    The impression derived from the historical books is confirmed by  the prophets.  It is true that in their polemic against confounding  worship with religion they reveal the fact that in their day the  cultus was carried on with the utmost zeal and splendour, and was  held in the highest estimation.  But this estimation does not rest  upon the opinion that the cultus, as regards its matter, goes back  to Moses or to Jehovah Himself, gives to the theocracy its  distinctive character, and even constitutes the supernatural  priesthood of Israel among the nations, but simply upon the belief  that Jehovah must be honoured by His dependents, just as other  gods are by their subjects, by means of offerings and gifts as  being the natural and (like prayer) universally current  expressions of religious homage.  The larger the quantity, and the  finer the quality, so much the better; but that the merit arising  from the presentation depends upon strict observance of etiquette  regarded as Jehovah's law is not suggested.  Thus it is that the  prophets are able to ask whether then Jehovah has commanded His  people to tax their energies with such exertions?  the fact  presupposed being that no such command exists, and that no one  knows anything at all about a ritual Torah. Amos, the leader of  the chorus, says (iv.4 seq.),  \"Come to Bethel to sin, to Gilgal to sin yet more, and bring your  sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three days, for so ye  like, ye children of Israel.\"  In passing sentence of rejection upon the value of the cultus he  is in opposition to the faith of his time; but if the opinion had  been a current one that precisely the cultus was what Jehovah had  instituted in Israel, he would not have been able to say, \"For so  ye like.\" \"Ye,\" not Jehovah; it is an idle and arbitrary worship.  He expresses himself still more clearly in v.21 seq.  \"I hate, I despise your feasts, and I smell not on your holy days;  though ye offer me burnt-offerings and your gifts, I will not accept  them; neither do I regard your thank-offerings of fatted calves.  Away from me with the noise of thy songs, the melody of thy viols  I will not hear; but let judgment roll on like waters, and  righteousness like a mighty stream. Did ye offer unto me  sacrifices and gifts in the wilderness the forty years, O house  of Israel?\"  In asking this last question Amos has not the slightest fear  of raising any controversy; on the contrary, he is following  the generally received belief.  His polemic is directed against  the praxis of his contemporaries, but here he rests it upon a  theoretical foundation in which they are at one with him,--on  this, namely, that the sacrificial worship is not of Mosaic origin.  Lastly, if ii.4 be genuine, it teaches the same lesson.  By the  Law of Jehovah which the people of Judah have despised it is  impossible that Amos can have understood anything in the remotest  degree resembling a ritual legislation.  Are we to take it then  that he formed his own special private notion of the Torah?  How in  that case would it have been possible for him to make himself  understood by the people, or to exercise influence over them?  Of  all unlikely suppositions, at all events it is the least likely  that the herdsman of Tekoah, under the influence of prophetic  tradition (which in fact he so earnestly disclaims), should have  taken the Torah for something quite different from what it actually  was.    Hosea, Isaiah, and Micah are in agreement with Amos.  The first  mentioned complains bitterly (iv.6 seq.) that the priests  cultivate the system of sacrifices instead of the Torah.  The  Torah, committed by Jehovah to their order, lays it on them as  their vocation to diffuse the knowledge of God in Israel,--the  knowledge that He seeks truthfulness and love, justice and  considerateness, and no gifts; but they, on the contrary, in a  spirit of base self-seeking, foster the tendency of the nation  towards cultus, in their superstitions over-estimate of which lies  their sin and their ruin.  \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; ye yourselves  (ye priests!) reject knowledge, and I too will reject you  that ye shall not be priests unto me; seeing ye have forgotten  the law of  your God, so will I also forget you.  The more they are,  the more they sin against me; their glory they barter for shame.  They eat the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their  iniquity.\"  From this we see how idle it is to believe that the prophets  opposed \"the Law;\" they defend the priestly Torah, which, however,  has nothing to do with cultus, but only with justice and morality.  In another passage (viii.11 seq.) we read,  \"Ephraim has built for himself many altars, to sin; the altars  are there for him, to sin.  How many soever my"]]]
