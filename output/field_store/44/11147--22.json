They  all rushed at her.    \"I've had an awful time with her,\" sobbed Alexia, her face buried in her  handkerchief, \"and I suppose it really will kill me, girls.\"    \"Nonsense!\" cried one or two. \"Well, what did she say about making Polly  listen to reason?\"    \"Oh, dreadful--dreadful!\" groaned Alexia gustily. \"You can't think!\"    \"You don't mean to say that she approves, after all that Polly Pepper  has worked over that old Recital, to\"--    --\"Have some one else come in and grab the glory?\" finished another  voice.    \"Oh, dear--dear!\" groaned Alexia in between. \"And Miss Salisbury would  kill you, Clem, if she heard you say 'grab.'\"    \"Well, do tell us, what did Miss Salisbury say?\" demanded another girl  impatiently.    \"She said it was right for Polly to ask Charlotte Chatterton to sing,  and she was glad she was going to do it.\"    \"Oh, horrors!\" exclaimed the group in dismal chorus.    \"The idea! as much as she loves Polly Pepper!\" cried Sally Moore.    \"And I hate the word 'right,'\" exploded Alexia, whirling her  handkerchief around her fingers. \"Now! It's poked at one everlastingly.  I think it's just sweet to be wicked.\"    \"Oh, Alexia Rhys!\"    \"Well, just a little bit wicked,\" said Alexia.    Cathie Harrison shook back the waves of light hair on her brow. \"Girls,\"  she began hesitatingly. But no one would listen; the laments were going  on so fast over Polly and her doings.    \"It _is_ right!\" cried Cathie at last, after many ineffectual  attempt to be heard. \"Do stop, girls, making such a noise,\" she added  impatiently.    \"That's a great way to preach,\" said Clem, laughing, \"lose your temper  to begin with, Cathie.\"    \"I didn't--that is, I'm sorry,\" said Cathie. \"But, anyway, I want to say  I ought to have been ashamed to act so about that Chatterton girl. Where  should I have been if Polly Pepper hadn't taken me up?\"    She looked down the long aisle to a seat in the corner. \"There's where I  sat,\" pointing to it, \"and you all know it, for a whole week, and I  thought I should die; I did,\" tragically, \"without any one speaking to  me. And one day Polly Pepper came up and asked wouldn't I come to her  house to the Bee you were all going to get up to fit out that horrible  old poor white family down South. And I wanted to get up and scream, I  was so glad.\"    \"Cathie Harrison,\" exclaimed Alexia, springing to her feet defiantly,  \"what do you want to bring back those dreadful old times for! You are  the most uncomfortable person I ever saw.\"    \"You needn't mind it now, Alexia,\" cried Cathie, rushing at her, \"for  you've been too lovely for anything ever since--you dear!\"    \"I lovely? oh, girls, did you hear?\" cried Alexia, sinking into her  chair again, quite overcome. \"She said I was lovely--oh, dear me!\"    \"And so you are,\" repeated Cathie stoutly; \"just as nice and sweet and  lovely to me as you can be. So!\" throwing her long arms around Alexia.    \"I didn't want to be; Polly made me,\" said Alexia.    \"I know it; but I don't care. You are nice now, any way.\"    \"And I suppose we must be nice to that Chatterton girl now, if she does  break up our fun,\" said Alexia with a sigh, getting out of her chair.  \"Come on, girls; let us go and tell Polly it's just heavenly that  Charlotte is to sing.\"          CHAPTER IX.    POLLY'S RECITAL.      Charlotte Chatterton stood back of the portiere pulling a refractory  button of her glove into place, as a gay group precipitated themselves  into the dressing-room of The Exeter.    \"Now remember, girls,\" cried Alexia, rushing at the toilet table to  bestow frantic twitches at the fluffy waves of hair over her forehead,  \"that we must applaud the very minute that she gets through singing. Oh  dear me, just look at my bangs; they are perfect frights. Hateful  things!\" with another pull at the offending locks.    \"It's a swell house,\" exclaimed one of the girls delightedly.    \"Just let Miss Salisbury catch you saying 'swell,'\" warned Alexia. \"Take  care now, Sally Moore, this is a very proper and select occasion.\"    \"Well, do let some of us have that glass a minute,\" retorted Sally, \"and  mend your manners before you take occasion to correct my speech.\"    \"My bangs are worse than yours, Sally,\" cried another girl, crowding up;  \"do let me get one corner of that glass,\" trying to achieve a view of  her head over Alexia's shoulder.    Alexia calmly picked at the fluffy bunch of hair on her brow, giving it  a little quirk before she said, \"Don't fight, girls; it quite spoils  one's looks; I never do when I'm dressed up.\"    \"Of course not,\" said Sally Moore, \"for you get everything you want  without fighting.\"    \"The idea!\" exclaimed Alexia, with an injured expression, \"when I never  have my own way. Why, I give up and give up the whole time to somebody.  Well, never mind; let's talk about the Recital. Oh, it's going to be  quite elegant for Polly Pepper. There's a regular society cram in the  Hall.\"    \"Well, I don't think 'society cram' is a bit better than a 'swell  affair,'\" said Clem Forsythe, slipping out of her opera cloak.    \"Nor I either,\" cried three or four voices.    \"Oh, I don't object to 'swell affair' myself,\" said Alexia; \"I have used  the words on more than one occasion, unless my memory is treacherous. I  only wanted to spare Miss Salisbury's nerves.\"    \"Pity you didn't give more attention to Miss Salisbury's nerves five or  six years ago,\" said Sally. \"Do get away from that glass.\"    \"It's no time to talk about me now,\" observed Alexia. \"All our minds  should be on Polly, and her Recital. Girls, _did_ you see Jack  Loughead down at the door?\"    \"Didn't we?\" cried the girls.    \"He's as handsome as a picture, isn't he?\" cried Alexia, with another  little pull at her rebellious hair.    \"Isn't he?\" hummed the girls.    \"Well, he won't look at you, for all your fussing over those bangs,\"  said Sally vindictively.    \"Did you suppose I thought he would?\" cried Alexia coolly. \"Why, it's  Polly Pepper, everybody knows, that brings him here.\"    \"What's become of Mr. Bayley?\" asked one of the girls suddenly.    \"Hush--sh! you mustn't ask,\" cried Alexia mysteriously, and turning away  from the mirror, with a lingering movement; \"there, it looks shockingly,  but it is as good as I can fix it.\"    \"Your hair always does look perfectly horrid,\" declared Sally Moore,  deftly slipping into the vacated place.    \"Well, do tell all you know about Mr. Bayley and Polly,\" begged the girl  who had raised the question, \"I'm just dying to know.\"    \"Alexia Rhys doesn't know a thing more than we do, Frances,\" said Clem,  \"only she pretends she's in the secret.\"    \"I was down at Dunraven at the Christmas splurge,\" said Alexia, \"and you  were not, Clem. That's all I shall say,\" and she leisurely disposed  herself in a big chair, and began to draw on her gloves, with the air of  one who could reveal volumes were she so disposed.    \"Polly wouldn't ever send him off,\" said one of the girls, \"I don't  believe. Why, he's horribly rich; and just think of marrying into the  Bayley family--oh my!\"    \"I should think the shock of being asked to enter that family, would  kill any girl, to begin with,\" said Clem. \"Why, he goes back to William  the Conqueror, doesn't he? And there's an earl in the family, and I  don't know what else. And then beside, there's his mother; the idea of  sitting opposite to her at the table every single day--oh dear me! I  know I should drop my knife and fork and things, from pure fright.\"    \"I'm sure I don't see why anybody is proud to have his family go back  all the time,\" said Alexia Rhys; \"for my part I should want to start  things forward a little myself.\"    \"Well, who does know anything about it, why Mr. Bayley has gone off  suddenly?\" demanded Frances.    \"No one knows,\" said Clem.    Alexia hummed a tune provokingly.    \"We all guess, and it's easy enough to guess the truth; but Polly won't  ever let it out, so that's all there is about it.\"    \"Well, now, girls,\" said Alexia suddenly, \"we must remember what we  promised each other.\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Frances; \"I didn't promise anything to  anybody.\"    \"You weren't with us when we promised, my dear,\" answered Alexia, \"and  I'll rise and explain. You see we don't any of us like that Charlotte  Chatterton; not a single one of us. She's a perfect stick, I think.\"    \"So do I,\" said another girl; \"this is the way she walks.\" Thereupon  followed a representation given to the life, of Charlotte Chatterton's  method of getting her long figure over the ground, which brought subdued  peals of laughter from the girls looking on.    \"And she has no more feeling than an oyster,\" pursued Alexia, when she  had recovered her breath, \"or she might see that Polly was just giving  up all her fun and ours too, by dragging her into everything that is  going on.\"    \"I know it,\" said the girls.    \"And I'm so sick of her taking in everything so as a matter of course,\"  observed Alexia; \"oh! she's quite an old sponge.\"    \"It's bad enough to be called an oyster, without having old sponge  fastened to one,\" said Sally Moore, coming away from the mirror, thereby  occasioning another rush for that useful dressing-room appointment.    \"Well, she is both of those very things,\" declared Alexia, \"nevertheless  we must applaud her dreadfully when she's finished singing. That's what  we promised each other, Frances. It will please Polly, you know.\"    \"You better hurry, or you will lose your seats,\" announced a friendly  voice in the doorway, which had the effect to send the whole bevy out as  precipitately as they had hurried in.    When she was quite sure that no one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7499"],[0,"Through Five Republics on Horseback, Being an Account of Many Wanderings in (#17)"],[1,"persistency, and  disturbed   the solitude of nature with their incessant humming. I write the  word _incessant_ advisedly, for I learned that there are several kinds  of mosquitos. Some work by day and others by night. Naturalists tell us  that only the female mosquito bites. Did they take a particular liking  to us because we were all males?    Some of the Indians paint their naked bodies in squares, generally with  red and black pigment. Their huts were in some cases large, but very  poorly constructed. When any members of the tribe are taken sick they  are supposed to be \"possessed\" by a stronger evil power, and the  sickness is \"starved out.\" When the malady flies away the life  generally accompanies it. The dead are buried under the earth inside  the huts, and in some of the dwellings graves are quite numerous. This  custom of interior burial has probably been adopted because the wild  animals of the forest would otherwise eat the corpse. Horrible to  relate, their own half-wild dogs sometimes devour the dead, though an  older member of the tribe is generally left home to mount guard.    Seeing by the numerous gourds scattered around that they were drinking  _chicha_, I solicited some, being anxious to taste the beverage which  had been used so many centuries before by the old Incas. The wife of  the chief immediately tore off a branch of the feather palm growing  beside her, and, certainly within a minute, made a basket, into which  she placed a small gourd. Going to the other side of the clearing, she  commenced, with the agility of a monkey, to ascend a long sapling which  had been laid in a slanting position against a tall palm tree. The  long, graceful leaves of this cabbage palm had been torn open, and the  heart thus left to ferment. From the hollow cabbage the woman filled  the gourd, and lowered it to me by a fibre rope. The liquid I found to  be thick and milky, and the taste not unlike cider.    Prescott tells us that Atahuallpa, the Peruvian monarch, came to see  the conqueror, Pizarro, \"quaffing chicha from golden goblets borne by  his attendants.\" [Footnote: Este Embajador traia servicio de Senor, i  cinco o seis Vasos de Oro fino, con que bebia, i con ellos daba a beber  a los Espanoles de la chicha que traia.\"--Xerez.] Golden goblets did  not mean much to King Atahuallpa, however, for his palace of five  hundred different apartments is said to have been tiled with beaten  gold.    In these Guato Indians I observed a marked difference to any others I  had visited, in that they permitted the hair to grow on their faces.  The chief was of quite patriarchal aspect, with full beard and mild,  intelligent-looking eyes. The savages inhabiting the Chaco consider  this custom extremely \"dirty.\"    Before leaving these people I procured some of their bows and arrows,  and also several cleverly woven palm mats and cotton fans.    Some liquor our cook gave away had been taken out by the braves to  their women in another encampment. These spirits had so inflamed the  otherwise retiring, modest females that they, with the men, returned to  the steamer, clamoring for more. All the stores, along with some  liquors we carried, were under my care, and I kept them securely locked  up, but in my absence at the Indian camp the store-room had been broken  open, and our men and the Indians--men and women--had drunk long and  deep. A scene like Bedlam, or Dante's \"Inferno,\" was taking place when  I returned. Willing as they were to listen to my counsel and admit that  I was certainly a great white teacher, with superior wisdom, on this  love for liquor and its debasing consequences they would hear no words.  The women and girls, like the men, would clamor for the raw alcohol,  and gulp it down in long draughts. When ardent spirits are more sought  after by women and girls than are beads and looking-glasses it surely  shows a terribly depraved taste. Even the chattering monkeys in the  trees overhead would spurn the poison and eagerly clutch the bright  trinket. Perhaps the looking-glasses I gave the poor females would,  after the orgies were over, serve to show them that their beauty was  not increased by this beastly carousal, and thus be a means of  blessing. It may be asked, Can the savage be possessed of pride and of  self-esteem? I unhesitatingly answer yes, as I have had abundant  opportunity of seeing. They will strut with peacock pride when wearing  a specially gaudy-colored headdress, although that may be their only  article of attire.    Having on board far more salt than we ourselves needed, I was enabled  to generously distribute much of that invaluable commodity among them.  That also, working in a different way, might be a means of restoring  them to a normal soundness of mind after we left.    Poor lost creatures! For this draught of the white man's poison, far  more terrible to them than the deadly nightshade of their forests, more  dangerous than the venom of the loathsome serpent gliding across their  path, they are willing to sell body or soul. Soul, did I say? They have  never heard of that. To them, so far as I could ascertain, a future  life is unknown. The explorer has penetrated some little way into their  dark forests in search of rubber, or anything else which it would pay  to exploit, but the missionary of the Cross has never sought to  illumine their darker minds. They live their little day and go out into  the unknown unconscious of the fact that One called Jesus, who was the  Incarnate God, died to redeem them. As a traveller, I have often  wondered why men should be willing to pay me hundreds of dollars to  explore those regions for ultimate worldly gain, and none should ever  offer to employ me in proclaiming the greatest wonder of all the  ages--the story of Calvary--for eternal gain. After all, are the  Indians more blind to the future than we are? Yet, strange to say, we  profess to believe in the teachings of that One who inculcated the  practice of laying up treasure in heaven, while they have not even  heard His name. For love of gain men have been willing to accompany me  through the most deadly fever-breeding morass, or to brave the poisoned  arrows of the lynx-eyed Indian, but few have ever offered to go and  tell of Him whom they profess to serve.    The suffocating atmosphere quite precluded the idea of writing, for a  pen, dipped in ink, would dry before reaching the paper, and the latter  be saturated with perspiration in a few seconds; so these observations  were penned later. So far as I could ascertain, the Romish Church has  never touched the Guatos, and, notwithstanding all I have said about  them, I unhesitatingly affirm that it is better so. Geo. R. Witte,  missionary to Brazil, says: \"With one exception, all the priests with  whom I came in contact (when on a journey through Northern Brazil) were  immoral, drunken, and ignorant. The tribes who have come under priestly  care are decidedly inferior in morals, industry, and order to the  tribes who refuse to have anything to do with the whites. The Charentes  and Apinages have been, for years, under the care of Catholic  friars--this is the way I found them: both men and women walk about  naked.\"    \"We heard not one contradiction of the general testimony that the  people who were not under the influence of the Roman Catholic Church as  it is in S. America were better morally than those who were.\"  [Footnote: Robert E. Speer, \"Missions in South America.\"]    In Christendom organs peal out the anthems of Divine love, and  well-dressed worshippers chant in harmonious unison, \"Lord, incline our  hearts to keep Thy law.\" That law says: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor  as thyself.\" To the question: \"Who is my neighbor?\" the Divine voice  answers: \"A certain man.\" May he not be one of these neglected Indians?          CHAPTER VI.    ARRIVAL AT THE LAKE.      \"It sleeps among a hundred hills     Where no man ever trod,    And only Nature's music fills     The silences of God.\"      After going about two thousand three hundred miles up this serpentine  river, we discovered the entrance to the lake. Many had been the  conjectures and counsels of would-be advisers when we started. Some  said that there was no entrance to the lake from the river; others,  that there was not sufficient depth of water for the steamer to pass  through. On our port bow rose frowning rocks of forbidding aspect.  Drawing nearer, we noticed, with mingled feelings of curiosity and  wonder, that the face of these rocks was rudely carved by unmistakably  Indian art. There were portrayed a rising sun, tigers' feet, birds'  feet, etc. Why were they thus carved? Are those rocks the everlasting  recorders of some old history--some deed of Indian daring in days of  old? What these hieroglyphics signify we may never know; the workman is  gone, and his stone hammer is buried with him. To twentieth century  civilization his carving tells nothing. No Indians inhabit the shores  of the lake now, perhaps because of this \"writing on the wall.\"    With the leadsman in his place we slowly and cautiously entered the  unexplored lake, and thus for the first time in the world's history its  waters were ploughed by a steamer's keel.    Soon after our arrival the different guards were told off for the  silent watches. Night shut in upon the lake, and all nature slept. The  only lights on shore were those of the fire-flies as they danced  through the myrtle boughs. The stars in the heavens twinkled above us.  Now and again an alligator thrust his huge, ugly nose out of the water  and yawned, thus disturbing for the moment its placid surface, which  the pale moon illuminated with an ethereal light; otherwise stillness  reigned, or, rather, a calm mysterious peace which was deep and  profound. Somehow, the feeling crept upon us that we had become  detached from the world, though yet we lived. Afterwards, when the  tigers [Footnote: Jaguars are invariably called tigers"]]]
