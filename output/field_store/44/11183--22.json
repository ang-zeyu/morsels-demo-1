Cider sold in 1782  for six shillings \"Old Tenor\" a barrel, so it was worth about the same  as the wood both in money value and calorific qualities. A hundred years  previously--in 1679--cider was worth ten shillings a barrel. In 1650, when  first made in America, it was a costly luxury, selling for L4 4s. a barrel.  That this thawed-out Sunday barrel of cider would prove invariably a source  of much refreshment, inspiration, solace, tongue-loosing, and blood-warming  to the chilled and shivering deacons, elders, and farmers who gathered in  the noon-house, any one who has imbibed that all-potent and intoxicating  beverage, oft-frozen \"hard\" cider, can fervently testify.    Sometimes a very opulent farmer having built a noon-house for his own and  his family's exclusive use, would keep in it as part of his \"duds\" a few  simple cooking utensils in which his wife or daughters would re-heat or  partially cook his noon-day Sabbath meal, and mix for him a hot toddy or  punch, or a mug of that \"most insinuating drink\"--flip. Flip was made of  home-brewed beer, sugar, and a liberal dash of Jamaica rum, and was mixed  with a \"logger-head\"--a great iron \"stirring-stick\" which was heated in the  fire until red hot and then thrust into the liquid. This seething iron made  the flip boil and bubble and imparted to it a burnt, bitter taste which was  its most attractive attribute. I doubt not that many a \"loggerhead\" was  kept in New England noon-houses and left heating and gathering insinuating  goodness in the glowing coals, while the pious owner sat freezing in the  meeting-house, also gathering goodness, but internally keeping warm at the  thought of the bitter nectar he should speedily brew and gladly imbibe at  the close of the long service.    The comfort of a hot midday dinner on the Sabbath was not regarded with  much favor, though perhaps with secret envy, by the neighbors of the  luxury-loving farmer, who saw in it too close an approach to \"profanation  of the Sabbath.\" The heating and boiling of the flip with the red hot  \"loggerhead\" hardly came under the head of \"unnecessary Sabbath cooking\"  even in the minds of the most straight-laced descendants of the Puritans.    When stoves were placed and used in the New England meeting-houses, the  noon-day lunches were eaten within the pews inside the sanctuary, and the  noon-houses, no longer being needed, followed the law of cause and effect,  and like many other institutions of the olden times quickly disappeared.          X.    The Deacon's Office.        The deacons in the early New England churches had, besides their regular  duties on the Lord's Day, and their special duties on communion Sabbaths,  the charge of prudential concerns, and of providing for the poor of the  church. They also \"dispensed the word\" on Sabbaths to the congregation  during the absence of the ordained minister. Judge Sewall thus describes  in his diary under the date of November, 1685, the method at that time of  appointing or ordaining a deacon:--        \"In afternoon Mr. Willard ordained our Brother Theophilus Frary to the      office of a Deacon. Declared his acceptance January 11th first      now again. Propounded him to the congregation at Noon. Then in even      propounded him if any of the church of other had to object they might      speak. Then took the Church's Vote, then call'd him up to the Pulpit,      laid his Hand on's head, and said I ordain Thee, etc., etc., gave him      his charge, then Prayed & sung 2nd Part of 84th Psalm.\"    The deacons always sat near the pulpit in a pew, which was generally  raised a foot or two above the level of the meeting-house floor, and which  contained, usually, several high-backed chairs and a table or a broad  swinging-shelf for use at the communion service. These venerable men were  a group of awe-inspiring figures, who, next to the parson, received the  respect of the community. In Bristol, Connecticut, the deacons wore  starched white linen caps in the meeting-house to indicate their office,--a  singular local custom. One of their duties in many communities was  naturally to furnish the sacramental wines, and the money for the payment  thereof was allowed to them from the church-rates, or was raised by special  taxation. In Farmington, Connecticut, in 1669, each male inhabitant was  ordered to pay a peck of wheat or one shilling to the deacons of the church  to defray the expenses of the sacrament. In Groton church, in 1759, \"4  Coppers for every Sacrament for 1 year\" was demanded from each communicant.  In Springfield the \"deacon's rate\" was paid in \"wampam,\"--sixpence in  \"wampam\" or a peck of Indian corn from each family in the town. This  special tax was somewhat modified in case a man had no wife, or if he were  not a church-member, but in the latter case he still had to pay some dues,  though of course he could not take part in the communion service. In 1734  the Milton church ordered the deacons to procure \"good Canary Wine for  the Communion Table.\" Abuses sometimes arose,--abominably poor wines were  furnished, though full rates were paid for the purchase of wine of  good quality; and in Newbury the man who was appointed to furnish the  sacramental wines, sold, under that religious cover, wine and liquors at  retail.    The deacons also had charge of the vessels used in the communion service.  These vessels were frequently stored, when not in use, under the pulpit in  a little closet which opened into \"the Ministers wives pue,\" and which was  fabled to be at the disposal of the tithingmen and deacons for the darksome  incarceration of unruly and Sabbath-breaking boys. The communion vessels  were not always of valuable metal; John Cotton's first church had wooden  chalices; the wealthier churches owned pieces of silver which had been  given to them, one piece at a time, by members or friends of the church;  but communion services of pewter were often seen.    The church in Hanover, Massachusetts, bought a pewter service in 1728, and  the record of the purchase still exists. It runs thus:--      3 Pewter Tankards marked C. T.    10 shillings.    5   \"    Beakers    \"    C. E.    6 sh. 6d. each.    2   \"    Platters   \"    C. P.    5 sh. each.    1   \"    Basin for Baptisms.    This pewter service is still owned by the Hanover church, a highly prized  relic. Until 1753 the church in Andover used a pewter communion service,  but when a silver service was given to it, the Andover church sent the  vessels of baser metal to a sister church in Methuen. In Haverhill the will  of a church-member named White gave to the church absolutely the pewter  dishes which were used at the sacrament, and which had been his personal  property. The \"ffirst church\" of Hartford had \"one Puter fflagon, ffower  pewter dishes, and a bason\" left to it by the bequest of one of its  members. When the Danvers church was burned in 1805, the pewter communion  vessels were saved while the silver ones were either burnt or stolen. As  pewter was, in the early days of New England, far from being a despised  metal, and as pewter dishes and plates were seen on the tables of the  wealthiest families, were left by will as precious possessions, were  engraved with initials and stamped with coats of arms, and polished with  as much care as were silver vessels, a communion service of pewter was  doubtless felt to be a thoroughly satisfactory acquisition and appointment  to a Puritan church.    The deacons of course took charge of the church contributions. Lechford,  in his \"Plaine Dealing,\" thus describes the manner of giving in the Boston  church in 1641:--        \"Baptism being ended, follows the contribution, one of the deacons      saying, 'Brethren of the Congregation, now there is time left for      contribution, whereof as God has prospered you so freely offer.' The      Magistrates and chief gentlemen first, and then the Elders and all the      Congregation of them, and most of them that are not of the church, all      single persons, widows and women in absence of their husbands, came up      one after another one way, and bring their offering to the deacon at      his seat, and put it into a box of wood for the purpose, if it be money      or papers. If it be any other Chattel they set or lay it down before      the deacons; and so pass on another way to their seats again; which      money and goods the Deacons dispose towards the maintenance of the      Minister, and the poor of the Church, and the Churches occasions      without making account ordinarily.\"    Lechford also said he saw a \"faire gilt cup\" given at the public  contribution; and other gifts of value to the church and minister were  often made. Libellous verses too were thrown into the contribution boxes,  and warning and gloomy messages from the Quakers; and John Rogers,  in derision of a pompous New London minister, threw in the insulting  contribution of an old periwig. One Puritan goodwife, sternly unforgiving,  never saw a contribution taken for proselyting the Indians without  depositing in the contribution-box a number of leaden bullets, the only  tokens she wished to see ever dispersed among the red men.    Even our pious forefathers were not always quite honest in their church  contributions, and had to be publicly warned, as the records show, that  they must deposit \"wampum without break or deforming spots,\" or \"passable  peage without breaches.\" The New Haven church was particularly tormented by  canny Puritans who thus managed to dispose of their broken and worthless  currency with apparent Christian generosity. In 1650 the New Haven \"deacons  informed the Court that the wampum which is putt into the Church Treasury  is generally so bad that the Elders to whom they pay it cannot pay it  away.\"    In 1651, as the bad wampum was still paid in by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/87"],[0,"The 1993 CIA World Factbook (#17)"],[1,"Australia, Economy    Exchange rates:    Australian dollars ($A) per US$1 - 1.4837 (January 1993), 1.3600 (1992),    1.2836 (1991), 1.2799 (1990), 1.2618 (1989), 1.2752 (1988)  Fiscal year:    1 July - 30 June    *Australia, Communications    Railroads:    40,478 km total; 7,970 km 1.600-meter gauge, 16,201 km 1.435-meter standard    gauge, 16,307 km 1.067-meter gauge; 183 km dual gauge; 1,130 km electrified;    government owned (except for a few hundred kilometers of privately owned    track) (1985)  Highways:    837,872 km total; 243,750 km paved, 228,396 km gravel, crushed stone, or    stabilized soil surface, 365,726 km unimproved earth  Inland waterways:    8,368 km; mainly by small, shallow-draft craft  Pipelines:    crude oil 2,500 km; petroleum products 500 km; natural gas 5,600 km  Ports:    Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Devonport, Fremantle, Geelong, Hobart,    Launceston, Mackay, Melbourne, Sydney, Townsville  Merchant marine:    82 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 2,347,271 GRT/3,534,926 DWT; includes    2 short-sea passenger, 8 cargo, 7 container, 8 roll-on/roll-off, 1 vehicle    carrier, 17 oil tanker, 3 chemical tanker, 4 liquefied gas, 30 bulk, 2    combination bulk  Airports:   total:    481   usable:    439   with permanent-surface runways:    243   with runways over 3,659 m:    1   with runways 2,440-3,659 m:    20   with runways 1,220-2,439 m:    268  Telecommunications:    good international and domestic service; 8.7 million telephones; broadcast    stations - 258 AM, 67 FM, 134 TV; submarine cables to New Zealand, Papua New    Guinea, and Indonesia; domestic satellite service; satellite stations - 4    Indian Ocean INTELSAT, 6 Pacific Ocean INTELSAT earth stations    *Australia, Defense Forces    Branches:    Australian Army, Royal Australian Navy, Royal Australian Air Force  Manpower availability:    males age 15-49 4,830,068; fit for military service 4,198,622; reach    military age (17) annually 135,591 (1993 est.)

Thanks to an excellent raw material endowment, a technically skilled labor    force, and strong links to German industrial firms, Austria occupies    specialized niches in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and    produces almost enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force    in agriculture. Increased export sales resulting from German unification,    continued to boost Austria's economy through 1991. However, Germany's    economic difficulties in 1992 slowed Austria's GDP growth to 2% from the 3%    of 1991. Austria's economy, moreover, is not expected to grow by more than    1% in 1993, and inflation is forecast to remain about 4%. Unemployment will    likely remain at current levels at least until 1994. Living standards in    Austria are comparable with the large industrial countries of Western    Europe. Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level    of subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary    capabilities. The continued opening of Eastern European markets, however,    will increase demand for Austrian exports. Austria, a member of the European    Free Trade Association (EFTA), in 1992 ratified the European Economic Area    Treaty, which will extend European Community rules"]]]
