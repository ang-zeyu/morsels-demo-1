[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8743"],[0,"Mary Schweidler, the amber witch (#17)"],[1,", I should very soon find it out for myself; and he jumped  over the wall and went into old Lizzie her house, which stands close by  the churchyard.    My child had made ready some veal broth for dinner, for which I mostly use  to leave everything else; but I could not swallow one spoonful, but sat  resting my head on my hand, and doubted whether I should tell her or no.  Meanwhile the old maid came in ready for a journey, and with a bundle in  her hand, and begged me with tears to give her leave to go. My poor child  turned pale as a corpse, and asked in amaze what had come to her? but she  merely answered, \"Nothing!\" and wiped her eyes with her apron. When I  recovered my speech, which had well-nigh left me at seeing that this  faithful old creature was also about to forsake me, I began to question  her why she wished to go; she who had dwelt with me so long, and who would  not forsake us even in the great famine, but had faithfully borne up  against it, and, indeed, had humbled me by her faith, and had exhorted me  to stand out gallantly to the last, for which I should be grateful to her  as long as I lived. Hereupon she merely wept and sobbed yet more, and at  length brought out that she still had an old mother of eighty living in  Liepe, and that she wished to go and nurse her till her end. Hereupon my  daughter jumped up and answered with tears, \"Alas, old Ilse, why wilt thou  leave us, for thy mother is with thy brother? Do but tell me why thou wilt  forsake me, and what harm have I done thee, that I may make it good to  thee again.\" But she hid her face in her apron and sobbed and could not  get out a single word; whereupon my child drew away the apron from her  face, and would have stroked her cheeks to make her speak. But when Ilse  saw this she struck my poor child's hand and cried, \"Ugh!\" spat out before  her, and straightway went out at the door. Such a thing she had never done  even when my child was a little girl, and we were both so shocked that we  could neither of us say a word.    Before long my poor child gave a loud cry, and cast herself upon the  bench, weeping and wailing, \"What has happened, what has happened?\" I  therefore thought I ought to tell her what I had heard--namely, that she  was looked upon as a witch. Whereat she began to smile instead of weeping  any more, and ran out of the door to overtake the maid, who had already  left the house, as we had seen. She returned after an hour, crying out  that all the people in the village had run away from her when she would  have asked them whither the maid was gone. _Item_, the little children,  for whom she had kept school, had screamed, and had hidden themselves from  her; also no one would answer her a single word, but all spat out before  her, as the maid had done. On her way home she had seen a boat on the  water, and had run as fast as she could to the shore, and called with  might and main after old Ilse, who was in the boat. But she had taken no  notice of her, not even once to look round after her, but had motioned her  to be gone. And now she went on to weep and to sob the whole day and the  whole night, so that I was more miserable than even in the time of the  great famine. But the worst was yet to come, as will be shown in the  following chapter.          _The Seventeenth Chapter_      HOW MY POOR CHILD WAS TAKEN UP FOR A WITCH, AND CARRIED TO PUDGLA    The next day, Monday, the 12th July, at about eight in the morning, while  we sat in our grief, wondering who could have prepared such great sorrow  for us, and speedily agreed that it could be none other than the accursed  witch Lizzie Kolken, a coach with four horses drove quickly up to the  door, wherein sat six fellows, who straightway all jumped out. Two went  and stood at the front, two at the back door, and two more, one of whom  was the constable Jacob Knake, came into the room, and handed me a warrant  from the Sheriff for the arrest of my daughter, as in common repute of  being a wicked witch, and for her examination before the criminal court.  Any one may guess how my heart sank within me when I read this. I dropped  to the earth like a felled tree, and when I came to myself my child had  thrown herself upon me with loud cries, and her hot tears ran down over my  face. When she saw that I came to myself, she began to praise God therefor  with a loud voice, and essayed to comfort me, saying that she was  innocent, and should appear with a clean conscience before her judges.  _Item_, she repeated to me the beautiful text from Matthew, chap. v.:  \"Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall  say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.\"    And she begged me to rise and to throw my cassock over my doublet, and go  with her, for that without me she would not suffer herself to be carried  before the Sheriff. Meanwhile, however, all the village--men, women, and  children--had thronged together before my door; but they remained quiet,  and only peeped in at the windows, as though they would have looked right  through the house. When we had both made us ready, and the constable, who  at first would not take me with them, had thought better of it, by reason  of a good fee which my daughter gave him, we walked to the coach; but I  was so helpless that I could not get up into it.    Old Paasch, when he saw this, came and helped me up into the coach,  saying, \"God comfort ye! Alas, that you should ever see your child to come  to this!\" and he kissed my hand to take leave.    A few others came up to the coach, and would have done likewise; but I  besought them not to make my heart still heavier, and to take Christian  charge of my house and my affairs until I should return. Also to pray  diligently for me and my daughter, so that the Evil One, who had long gone  about our village like a roaring lion, and who now threatened to devour  me, might not prevail against us, but might be forced to depart from me  and from my child as from our guileless Saviour in the wilderness. But to  this none answered a word; and I heard right well, as we drove away, that  many spat out after us, and one said (my child thought it was Berow her  voice), \"We would far sooner lay fire under thy coats than pray for thee.\"  We were still sighing over such words as these when we came near to the  churchyard, and there sat the accursed witch Lizzie Kolken at the door of  her house with her hymn-book in her lap, screeching out at the top of her  voice, \"God the Father, dwell with us,\" as we drove past her; the which  vexed my poor child so sore that she swounded, and fell like one dead upon  me. I begged the driver to stop, and called to old Lizzie to bring us a  pitcher of water; but she did as though she had not heard me, and went on  to sing so that it rang again. Whereupon the constable jumped down, and at  my request ran back to my house to fetch a pitcher of water; and he  presently came back with it, and the people after him, who began to say  aloud that my child's bad conscience had stricken her, and that she had  now betrayed herself. Wherefore I thanked God when she came to life again,  and we could leave the village. But at Uekeritze it was just the same, for  all the people had flocked together, and were standing on the green before  Labahn his house when we went by.    Nevertheless, they were quiet enough as we drove past, albeit some few  cried, \"How can it be, how can it be?\" I heard nothing else. But in the  forest near the watermill the miller and all his men ran out and shouted,  laughing, \"Look at the witch, look at the witch!\" Whereupon one of the men  struck at my poor child with the sack which he held in his hand, so that  she turned quite white, and the flour flew all about the coach like a  cloud. When I rebuked him, the wicked rogue laughed and said, that if no  other smoke than that ever came under her nose, so much the better for  her. _Item_, it was worse in Pudgla than even at the mill. The people  stood so thick on the hill, before the castle, that we could scarce force  our way through, and the Sheriff caused the death-bell in the castle-tower  to toll as an _avisum_. Whereupon more and more people came running out of  the ale-houses and cottages. Some cried out, \"Is that the witch?\" Others,  again, \"Look at the parson's witch! the parson's witch!\" and much more,  which for very shame I may not write. They scraped up the mud out of the  gutter which ran from the castle-kitchen and threw it upon us; _item_, a  great stone, the which struck one of the horses so that it shied, and  belike would have upset the coach had not a man sprung forward and held it  in. All this happened before the castle-gates, where the Sheriff stood  smiling and looking on, with a heron's feather stuck in his grey hat. But  so soon as the horse was quiet again, he came to the coach and mocked at  my child, saying, \"See, young maid, thou wouldst not come to me, and here  thou art nevertheless!\" Whereupon she answered, \"Yea, I come; and may you  one day come before your judge as I come before you\"; whereunto I said,  Amen, and asked him how his lordship could answer before God and man for  what he had done to a wretched man like myself and to my child? But he  answered, saying, Why had I come with her? And when I told him of the rude  people here, _item_, of the churlish miller's man, he said that it was not  his fault, and threatened the people all around with his fist, for they  were making a great noise. Thereupon he commanded my child to get down and  to follow him, and went before her into the castle; motioned the  constable, who would have gone with them, to stay at the foot of the  steps, and began to mount the winding staircase to the upper rooms alone  with my child.    But she whispered me privately, \"Do not leave me, father\"; and I presently  followed softly after them. Hearing by their voices in which chamber they  were, I laid my ear against the door"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8745"],[0,"Wulf the Saxon: A Story of the Norman Conquest (#17)"],[1,"hained, and with his  friends thrown into prison by the count, who has sent no intimation  of what has taken place to me, his lord, and had it not been for  these two brave and faithful youths, who effected their escape over  the battlements of Beaurain in order to bring me the news, the earl  might have lingered in shameful captivity. I pray you take horse  at once, with twenty chosen spears, and ride at the top of your  speed to Beaurain. There express in fitting terms to Conrad my  indignation at his foul treatment of one who should have been  received as a most honoured guest. Say that the earl and his company  must at once be released, and be accorded the treatment due not  only to themselves, but to them as my guests, and bid the count  mount with them and ride to my fortress of Eu, to which I myself  will at once journey to receive them. Tell Conrad that I will account  to him for any fair ransom he may claim, and if he demur to obey  my orders warn him that the whole force of Normandy shall at once  be set on foot against him. After having been for two years my  prisoner, methinks he will not care to run the risk of again being  shut up within my walls.\"    \"We will use all haste,\" Fitz-Osberne said. \"Conrad's conduct is a  disgrace to every Norman noble, for all Europe will cry shame when  the news of the earl's treatment gets abroad. That Conrad should  hold him to ransom is only in accordance with his strict rights,  but that he should imprison and chain him is, by the saints, almost  beyond belief.\"    As soon as the knights had left, the duke sent for his chamberlain,  and ordered him to conduct Beorn and Wulf to an apartment and to  see that they were at once furnished with garments befitting young  nobles, together with a purse of money for their immediate wants.  Then taking a long and heavy gold chain from his neck he placed it  on the table, and with a blow with his dagger cut it in sunder, and  handed half to each of the lads.    \"Take this,\" he said, \"in token of my thanks for having brought me  this news, and remember, that if at any time you should have a boon  to ask that it is within my power to grant, I swear to you upon my  ducal honour that it shall be yours. Never have I received more  joyful news than that the great Earl of Wessex will shortly be my  guest.\"    The lads bowed deeply, and then followed the chamberlain from the  apartment.    \"Well, what think you of it, Beorn?\" Wulf said, when they found  themselves alone in a handsome chamber.    \"So far as rescuing Harold from the power of the Count of Ponthieu  we have surely succeeded even beyond our hopes. As to the rest, I  know not. As you were speaking I marked the satisfaction and joy  on the duke's face, and I said to myself that it was greater than  need have been caused by the thought that Earl Harold was to be his  guest.\"    \"So I thought myself, Beorn. There can be no doubt that, as he said,  he deemed it the best news he had ever received, and I fear greatly  that Harold will but exchange one captivity for another. It will  doubtless be a more pleasant one, but methinks Harold will find  himself as much a prisoner, although treated as an honoured guest  by William, as he was while lying in the dungeon of Conrad. It is  a bad business, and I greatly fear indeed that Harold will long rue  the unfortunate scheme of hunting along the coast that has brought  him to this pass.\"    In a short time an attendant arrived with ewers, water, and four  suits of handsome garments, belts embroidered with gold thread, and  daggers, together with two plumed caps and purses, each containing  ten gold pieces; he informed them that two horses had been provided  for their use, and that they were to take their meals with the  duke's household, and to consider themselves in all respects as his  guests.    \"We look finer birds than we did when we rode in with brother  Philip,\" Beorn laughed when they had attired themselves in their  new garments. \"The more sober of these suits are a good deal gayer  than those we wore at home even at court ceremonies.\"    \"King Edward objects to show,\" Wulf said, \"and his own pages are  so sober in their attire that the earl likes not that we should  outshine them, and we usually cut a poor figure beside those of  William of London and the other Normans of his court.\"    In a short time the chamberlain came in and informed them that  supper was served, and conducted them to the hall, where he presented  them to the duke's gentlemen and pages as William's guests, and  wards and pages of the Earl of Wessex. The news of Harold's shipwreck  and imprisonment travelled quickly, for orders had already been  issued for the court to prepare to start early the next morning to  accompany the duke to Eu, in order to receive with due honour  William's guest and friend, Harold of England; and while the meal  went on many questions were asked as to the shipwreck and prisonment  of the earl, and the liveliest indignation was expressed at the  conduct of Conrad of Ponthieu.    \"Truly all Normans will be reckoned churls,\" one of the gentlemen  exclaimed indignantly. \"The fame of Harold's bravery, wisdom, and  courtesy to all men is known in every court in Europe, and that the  duke's vassal should have dared to imprison and chain him will  excite universal indignation. Why, the rudest of our own Norse  ancestors would not have so foully treated one so noble whom fate  had cast into his hands. Had we been at war with England it would  be shameful, but being at peace there are no words that can fitly  describe the outrage.\"    When the meal was over, one of the duke's pages who was about the  same age as Beorn asked him what they were going to do with themselves.    \"If you have nothing better,\" he said, \"will you ride with me to  my father's castle, it is but five miles away? My name is De Burg.  I can promise you a hearty welcome. My father was one of the knights  who accompanied the duke when he paid his visit to England some  fifteen years ago, and he liked the country much, and has ever since  spoken of the princely hospitality with which they were received  by your king. He did not meet Earl Harold then.\"    \"No, the earl with his father and brothers was away in exile,\" Wulf  said rather shortly, for that visit had been a most unpleasant one  to Englishmen. It had happened when the Norman influence was  altogether in the ascendant. The king was filling the chief places  at court and in the church with Normans, had bestowed wide domains  upon them, and their castles were everywhere rising to dominate the  land. Englishmen then regarded with hostility this visit of the  young Norman duke with his great train of knights, and although at  the return of Godwin and his sons the greater portion of the intruders  had been driven out, their influence still remained at court, and  it was even said that Edward had promised the duke that he should  be his successor.    It was true that Englishmen laughed at the promise. The King of  England was chosen by the nation, and Edward had no shadow of right  to bequeath the throne even to one of his sons much less to a foreign  prince, who, although related to himself by marriage, had no drop  of English blood in his veins. Still, that the promise should ever  have been made rankled in the minds of the English people, the more  so as the power of Normandy increased, and the ambition as well as  the valour of its duke became more and more manifest According to  English law the promise was but an empty breath, absolutely without  effect or value. According to Norman law it constituted a powerful  claim, and Duke William was assuredly not a man to let such a claim  drop unpressed.    Wulf had heard all this again and again, and the prior of Bramber  had explained it to him in all its bearings, showing him that little  as Englishmen might think of the promise given by Edward so long  ago, it would be likely to bring grievous trouble on the land at  his death. He might perhaps have said more in reference to William's  visit had not Beorn at once accepted the invitation to ride with  young De Burg to his father's castle.          CHAPTER VI      RELEASE OF THE EARL    In a few minutes the three horses were brought out. Wulf and Beorn  were much pleased with the animals that had been placed at their  service. They were powerful horses, which could carry a knight in  his full armour with ease, and seemed full of spirit and fire. They  were handsomely caparisoned, and the lads felt as they sprang on  to their backs that they had never been so well mounted before.    \"You would have made the journey more quickly and easily if you had  had these horses three days ago,\" young De Burg laughed.    \"Yes, indeed. There would have been no occasion to hide in the woods  then. With our light weight on their backs they would have made  nothing of the journey.\"    \"You must not expect to see a castle,\" De Burg said presently,  \"though I call it one. In his early days the duke set himself to  destroy the great majority of castles throughout Normandy, for as  you know he had no little trouble with his nobles, and held that  while the strength of these fortresses disposes men to engage either  in civil war or in private feuds with each other, they were of no  avail against the enemies of the country. My father, who is just  the age of the duke, was his loyal follower from the first, and of  his free will levelled his walls as did many others of the duke's  friends, in the first place because it gave the duke pleasure, and  in the second because, had only the castles of those opposed to the  duke been destroyed, there would have been such jealousy and animosity  on the part of their owners that matters would never have quieted  down in the country. Thus it is that throughout the land you will  find but few castles remaining. The nobles felt it strange at first  to be thus dwelling in houses undefended against"]]]
