[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7853"],[0,"Quentin Durward (#17)"],[1," Cher, in  the direct line of his path, two or three large chestnut trees were  so happily placed as to form a distinguished and remarkable group; and  beside them stood three or four peasants, motionless, with their eyes  turned upwards, and fixed, apparently, upon some object amongst the  branches of the tree next to them. The meditations of youth are seldom  so profound as not to yield to the slightest, impulse of curiosity, as  easily as the lightest pebble, dropped casually from the hand, breaks  the surface of a limpid pool. Quentin hastened his pace, and ran lightly  up the rising ground, in time enough to witness the ghastly spectacle  which attracted the notice of these gazers--which was nothing less than  the body of a man, convulsed by the last agony, suspended on one of the  branches.    \"Why do you not cut him down?\" said the young Scot, whose hand was as  ready to assist affliction, as to maintain his own honour when he deemed  it assailed.    One of the peasants, turning on him an eye from which fear had banished  all expression but its own, and a face as pale as clay, pointed to a  mark cut upon the bark of the tree, having the same rude resemblance  to a fleur de lys which certain talismanic scratches, well known to  our revenue officers, bear to a broad arrow. Neither understanding nor  heeding the import of this symbol, young Durward sprung lightly as  the ounce up into the tree, drew from his pouch that most necessary  implement of a Highlander or woodsman, the trusty skene dhu [black  knife; a species of knife without clasp or hinge formerly much used  by the Highlanders, who seldom travelled without such an ugly weapon,  though it is now rarely used. S.], and, calling to those below to  receive the body on their hands, cut the rope asunder in less than a  minute after he had perceived the exigency.    But his humanity was ill seconded by the bystanders. So far from  rendering Durward any assistance, they seemed terrified at the audacity  of his action, and took to flight with one consent, as if they feared  their merely looking on might have been construed into accession to his  daring deed. The body, unsupported from beneath, fell heavily to earth  in such a manner that Quentin, who presently afterwards jumped down, had  the mortification to see that the last sparks of life were extinguished.  He gave not up his charitable purpose, however, without farther efforts.  He freed the wretched man's neck from the fatal noose, undid the  doublet, threw water on the face, and practised the other ordinary  remedies resorted to for recalling suspended animation.    While he was thus humanely engaged, a wild clamour of tongues, speaking  a language which he knew not, arose around him; and he had scarcely time  to observe that he was surrounded by several men and women of a singular  and foreign appearance, when he found himself roughly seized by both  arms, while a naked knife, at the same moment, was offered to his  throat.    \"Pale slave of Eblis!\" [in Mohammedan religion the name of the chief of  the fallen angels] said a man, in imperfect French, \"are you robbing him  you have murdered?--But we have you--and you shall abuy it.\"    There were knives drawn on every side of him, as these words were  spoken, and the grim and distorted countenances which glared on him were  like those of wolves rushing on their prey.    Still the young Scot's courage and presence of mind bore him out. \"What  mean ye, my masters?\" he said; \"if that be your friend's body, I have  just now cut him down, in pure charity, and you will do better to try  to recover his life, than to misuse an innocent stranger to whom he owes  his chance of escape.\"    The women had by this time taken possession of the dead body, and  continued the attempts to recover animation which Durward had been  making use of, though with the like bad success; so that, desisting from  their fruitless efforts, they seemed to abandon themselves to all the  Oriental expressions of grief; the women making a piteous wailing,  and tearing their long black hair, while the men seemed to rend their  garments, and to sprinkle dust upon their heads. They gradually became  so much engaged in their mourning rites, that they bestowed no longer  any attention on Durward, of whose innocence they were probably  satisfied from circumstances. It would certainly have been his wisest  plan to have left these wild people to their own courses, but he had  been bred in almost reckless contempt of danger, and felt all the  eagerness of youthful curiosity.    The singular assemblage, both male and female, wore turbans and caps,  more similar in general appearance to his own bonnet than to the hats  commonly worn in France. Several of the men had curled black beards, and  the complexion of all was nearly as dark as that of Africans. One or two  who seemed their chiefs, had some tawdry ornaments of silver about their  necks and in their ears, and wore showy scarfs of yellow, or scarlet,  or light green; but their legs and arms were bare, and the whole troop  seemed wretched and squalid in appearance. There were no weapons among  them that Durward saw, except the long knives with which they had lately  menaced him, and one short, crooked sabre, or Moorish sword, which was  worn by an active looking young man, who often laid his hand upon  the hill, while he surpassed the rest of the party in his extravagant  expressions of grief, and seemed to mingle with them threats of  vengeance.    The disordered and yelling group were so different in appearance from  any beings whom Quentin had yet seen, that he was on the point of  concluding them to be a party of Saracens, of those \"heathen hounds,\"  who were the opponents of gentle knights and Christian monarchs in  all the romances which he had heard or read, and was about to withdraw  himself from a neighbourhood so perilous, when a galloping of horse was  heard, and the supposed Saracens, who had raised by this time the body  of their comrade upon their shoulders, were at once charged by a party  of French soldiers.    This sudden apparition changed the measured wailing of the mourners into  irregular shrieks of terror. The body was thrown to the ground in  an instant, and those who were around it showed the utmost and most  dexterous activity in escaping under the bellies as it were of the  horses, from the point of the lances which were levelled at them,  with exclamations of \"Down with the accursed heathen thieves--take and  kill--bind them like beasts--spear them like wolves!\"    These cries were accompanied with corresponding acts of violence; but  such was the alertness of the fugitives, the ground being rendered  unfavourable to the horsemen by thickets and bushes, that only two were  struck down and made prisoners, one of whom was the young fellow with  the sword, who had previously offered some resistance. Quentin, whom  fortune seemed at this period to have chosen for the butt of her shafts,  was at the same time seized by the soldiers, and his arms, in spite of  his remonstrances, bound down with a cord; those who apprehended him  showing a readiness and dispatch in the operation, which proved them to  be no novices in matters of police.    Looking anxiously to the leader of the horsemen, from whom he hoped  to obtain liberty, Quentin knew not exactly whether to be pleased or  alarmed upon recognising in him the down looking and silent companion of  Maitre Pierre. True, whatever crime these strangers might be accused  of, this officer might know, from the history of the morning, that  he, Durward, had no connection with them whatever; but it was a more  difficult question, whether this sullen man would be either a favourable  judge or a willing witness in his behalf, and he felt doubtful whether  he would mend his condition by making any direct application to him.    But there was little leisure for hesitation. \"Trois Eschelles and Petit  Andre,\" said the down looking officer to two of his band, \"These same  trees stand here quite convenient. I will teach these misbelieving,  thieving sorcerers to interfere with the King's justice, when it has  visited any of their accursed race. Dismount, my children, and do your  office briskly.\"    Trois Eschelles and Petit Andre were in an instant on foot, and Quentin  observed that they had each, at the crupper and pommel of his saddle,  a coil or two of ropes, which they hastily undid, and showed that, in  fact, each coil formed a halter, with the fatal noose adjusted, ready  for execution. The blood ran cold in Quentin's veins, when he saw three  cords selected, and perceived that it was proposed to put one around his  own neck. He called on the officer loudly, reminded him of their meeting  that morning, claimed the right of a free born Scotsman in a friendly  and allied country, and denied any knowledge of the persons along with  whom he was seized, or of their misdeed.    The officer whom Durward thus addressed, scarce deigned to look at  him while he was speaking, and took no notice whatever of the claim he  preferred to prior acquaintance. He barely turned to one or two of the  peasants who were now come forward, either to volunteer their evidence  against the prisoners, or out of curiosity, and said gruffly, \"Was  yonder young fellow with the vagabonds?\"    \"That he was, sir, and it please your noble Provostship,\" answered one  of the clowns; \"he was the very first blasphemously to cut down the  rascal whom his Majesty's justice most deservedly hung up, as we told  your worship.\"    \"I'll swear by God, and Saint Martin of Tours, to have seen him with  their gang,\" said another, \"when they pillaged our metairie [a small  farm].\"    \"Nay, but,\" said a boy, \"yonder heathen was black, and this youth is  fair; yonder one had short curled hair, and this hath long fair locks.\"    \"Ay, child,\" said the peasant, \"and perhaps you will say yonder one had  a green coat and this a gray"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7864"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#17)"],[1,"the days  of yore by Bhrigu. And such is the ancient history connected with the  destruction of the Rakshasa, Pauloma and the birth of Chyavana.\"    Thus endeth the seventh section of the Pauloma Parva of the Adi Parva of  the blessed Mahabharata.      SECTION VIII    (Pauloma Parva continued)    Sauti said, \"O Brahmana, Chyavana, the son of Bhrigu, begot a son in the  womb of his wife Sukanya. And that son was the illustrious Pramati of  resplendent energy. And Pramati begot in the womb of Ghritachi a son  called Ruru. And Ruru begot on his wife Pramadvara a son called Sunaka.  And I shall relate to you in detail, O Brahmana, the entire history of  Ruru of abundant energy. O listen to it then in full!    \"Formerly there was a great Rishi called Sthulakesa possessed of ascetic  power and learning and kindly disposed towards all creatures. At that time,  O Brahmana sage, Viswavasu, the King of the Gandharvas, it is said, had  intimacy with Menaka, the celestial dancing-girl. And the Apsara, Menaka,  O thou of the Bhrigu race, when her time was come, brought forth an infant  near the hermitage of Sthulakesa. And dropping the newborn infant on the  banks of the river, O Brahmana, Menaka, the Apsara, being destitute of  pity and shame, went away. And the Rishi, Sthulakesa, of great ascetic  power, discovered the infant lying forsaken in a lonely part of the river-  side. And he perceived that it was a female child, bright as the offspring  of an Immortal and blazing, as it were, with beauty: And the great  Brahmana, Sthulakesa, the first of Munis, seeing that female child, and  filled with compassion, took it up and reared it. And the lovely child  grew up in his holy habitation, the noble-minded and blessed Rishi  Sthulakesa performing in due succession all the ceremonies beginning with  that at birth as ordained by the divine law. And because she surpassed all  of her sex in goodness, beauty, and every quality, the great Rishi called  her by the name of Pramadvara. And the pious Ruru having seen Pramadvara  in the hermitage of Sthulakesa became one whose heart was pierced by the  god of love. And Ruru by means of his companions made his father Pramati,  the son of Bhrigu, acquainted with his passion. And Pramati demanded her  of the far-famed Sthulakesa for his son. And her foster-father betrothed  the virgin Pramadvara to Ruru, fixing the nuptials for the day when the  star Varga-Daivata (Purva-phalguni) would be ascendant.    \"Then within a few days of the time fixed for the nuptials, the beautiful  virgin while at play with companions of her own sex, her time having come,  impelled by fate, trod upon a serpent which she did not perceive as it lay  in coil. And the reptile, urged to execute the will of Fate, violently  darted its envenomed fangs into the body of the heedless maiden. And stung  by that serpent, she instantly dropped senseless on the ground, her colour  faded and all the graces of her person went off. And with dishevelled hair  she became a spectacle of woe to her companions and friends. And she who  was so agreeable to behold became on her death what was too painful to  look at. And the girl of slender waist lying on the ground like one  asleep--being overcome with the poison of the snake--once more became more  beautiful than in life. And her foster-father and the other holy ascetics  who were there, all saw her lying motionless upon the ground with the  splendour of a lotus. And then there came many noted Brahmanas filled with  compassion, and they sat around her. And Swastyatreya, Mahajana, Kushika,  Sankhamekhala, Uddalaka, Katha, and Sweta of great renown, Bharadwaja,  Kaunakutsya, Arshtishena, Gautama, Pramati, and Pramati's son Ruru, and  other inhabitants of the forest, came there. And when they saw that maiden  lying dead on the ground overcome with the poison of the reptile that had  bitten her, they all wept filled with compassion. But Ruru, mortified  beyond measure, retired from the scene.\"    So ends the eighth section of the Pauloma Parva of the Adi Parva of the  blessed Mahabharata.      SECTION IX    (Pauloma Parva continued)    Sauti said, \"While those illustrious Brahmanas were sitting around the  dead body of Pramadvara, Ruru, sorely afflicted, retired into a deep wood  and wept aloud. And overwhelmed with grief he indulged in much piteous  lamentation. And, remembering his beloved Pramadvara, he gave vent to his  sorrow in the following words, 'Alas! The delicate fair one that  increaseth my affliction lieth upon the bare ground. What can be more  deplorable to us, her friends? If I have been charitable, if I have  performed acts of penance, if I have ever revered my superiors, let the  merit of these arts restore to life my beloved one! If from my birth I  have been controlling my passions, adhered to my vows, let the fair  Pramadvara rise from the ground.'    \"And while Ruru was indulging in these lamentations for the loss of his  bride, a messenger from heaven came to him in the forest and addressed him  thus, 'The words thou utterest, O Ruru, in thy affliction are certainly  ineffectual. For, O pious man, one belonging to this world whose days have  run out can never come back to life. This poor child of a Gandharva and  Apsara has had her days run out! Therefore, O child, thou shouldst not  consign thy heart to sorrow. The great gods, however, have provided  beforehand a means of her restoration to life. And if thou compliest with  it, thou mayest receive back thy Pramadvara.'    \"And Ruru replied, 'O messenger of heaven! What is that which the gods have  ordained. Tell me in full so that (on hearing) I may comply with it. It  behoveth thee to deliver me from grief!' And the celestial messenger said  unto Ruru, 'Resign half of thy own life to thy bride, and then, O Ruru of  the race of Bhrigu, thy Pramadvara shall rise from the ground.' 'O best of  celestial messengers, I most willingly offer a moiety of my own life in  favour of my bride. Then let my beloved one rise up once more in her dress  and lovable form.'\"    Sauti said, \"Then the king of Gandharvas (the father of Pramadvara) and  the celestial messenger, both of excellent qualities, went to the god  Dharma (the Judge of the dead) and addressed him, saying, 'If it be thy  will, O Dharmaraja, let the amiable Pramadvara, the betrothed wife of Ruru,  now lying dead, rise up with a moiety of Ruru's life.' And Dharmaraja  answered, 'O messenger of the gods, if it be thy wish, let Pramadvara, the  betrothed wife of Ruru, rise up endued with a moiety of Ruru's life.'\"    Sauti continued, \"And when Dharmaraja had said so, that maiden of  superior complexion, Pramadvara, endued with a moiety of Ruru's life, rose  as from her slumber. This bestowal by Ruru of a moiety of his own span of  life to resuscitate his bride afterwards led, as it would be seen, to a  curtailment of Ruru's life.    \"And on an auspicious day their fathers gladly married them with due rites.  And the couple passed their days, devoted to each other. And Ruru having  obtained such a wife, as is hard to be found, beautiful and bright as the  filaments of the lotus, made a vow for the destruction of the serpent-race.  And whenever he saw a serpent he became filled with great wrath and always  killed it with a weapon.    \"One day, O Brahmana, Ruru entered an extensive forest. And there he saw  an old serpent of the Dundubha species lying stretched on the ground. And  Ruru thereupon lifted up in anger his staff, even like to the staff of  Death, for the purpose of killing it. Then the Dundubha, addressing Ruru,  said, 'I have done thee no harm, O Brahmana! Then wherefore wilt thou slay  me in anger?'\"    So ends the ninth section of the Pauloma Parva of the Adi Parva of the  blessed Mahabharata.      SECTION X    (Pauloma Parva continued)    Sauti said, \"And Ruru, on hearing those words, replied, 'My wife, dear to  me as life, was bit by a snake; upon which, I took, O snake, a dreadful  vow, viz., that I would kill every snake that I might come across.  Therefore shall I smite thee and thou shalt be deprived of life.'    \"And the Dundubha replied, 'O Brahmana, the snakes that bite man are quite  different in type. It behoveth thee not to slay Dundubhas who are serpents  only in name. Subject like other serpents to the same calamities but not  sharing their good fortune, in woe the same but in joy different, the  Dundubhas should not be slain by thee under any misconception.'\"    Sauti continued, \"And the Rishi Ruru hearing these words of the serpent,  and seeing that it was bewildered with fear, albeit a snake of the  Dundubha species, killed it not. And Ruru, the possessor of the six  attributes, comforting the snake addressed it, saying, 'Tell me fully, O  snake, who art thou thus metamorphosed?' And the Dundubha replied, 'O  Ruru! I was formerly a Rishi by name Sahasrapat. And it is by the curse of  a Brahmana that I have been transformed into a snake.' And Ruru asked, 'O  thou best of snakes, for what wast thou cursed by a Brahmana in wrath? And  how long also will thy form continue so?'\"    And so ends the tenth section of the Pauloma Parva of the Adi Parva.      SECTION XI    (Pauloma Parva continued)    Sauti continued \"The Dundubha then said, 'In former times, I had a friend  Khagama by name. He was impetuous in his speech and possessed of spiritual  power by virtue of his austerities. And one day when he was engaged in the  Agni-hotra (Fire-sacrifice), I made a mock snake of blades of grass, and  in a frolic attempted to frighten him with it. And anon he fell into a  swoon. On recovering his senses, that truth-telling and vow-observing  ascetic, burning with wrath, exclaimed, \"Since thou hast made a powerless  mock snake to frighten me, thou shalt be turned even into a venomless  serpent thyself by my curse.\" O ascetic, I well knew the power of his  penances; therefore with an agitated heart, I addressed him thus, bending  low with joined"]]]
