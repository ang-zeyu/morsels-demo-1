Behold they shall, for I have decreed it, begin to prevail      against mine enemies from this very hour.        7. And by hearkening to observe all the words which I, the Lord      their God, shall speak unto them, they shall never cease to prevail      until the kingdoms of the world are subdued under my feet, and the      earth is given unto the saints, to possess it forever and ever.        8. But inasmuch as they keep not my commandments, and hearken not      to observe all my words, the kingdoms of the world shall prevail      against them,        9. For they were set to be a light unto the world, and to be the      saviors of men;        {37} 10. And inasmuch as they are not the saviors of men, they      are as salt that has lost its savor, and is thenceforth good for      nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.        11. But verily I say unto you, I have decreed that your brethren      which have been scattered shall return to the lands of their      inheritances, and shall build up the waste places of Zion.        12. For after much tribulation, as I have said unto you in a former      commandment, cometh the blessing.        13. Behold, this is the blessing which I have promised after      your tribulations, and the tribulations of your brethren: your      redemption, and the redemption of your brethren, even their      restoration to the land of Zion, to be established, no more to be      thrown down.        14. Nevertheless, if they pollute their inheritances they shall      be thrown down; for I will not spare them if they pollute their      inheritances.        15. Behold, I say unto you, the redemption of Zion must needs come      by power;        16. Therefore, I will raise up unto my people a man, who shall lead      them like as Moses led the children of Israel.        17. For ye are the children of Israel, and of the seed of Abraham,      and ye must needs be led out of bondage by power, and with a      stretched-out arm:        18. And as your fathers were led at the first, even so shall the      redemption of Zion be.        19. Therefore, let not your hearts faint, for I say unto you as I      said unto your fathers, mine angel shall go up before you, but not      my presence;        20. But I say unto you, mine angels shall go up before you, and      also my presence, and in time ye shall possess the goodly land.        21. Verily, verily I say unto you, that my servant Baurak Ale      (Joseph Smith, Jun.,) is the man to whom I likened the servant to      whom the Lord of the vineyard spake in the parable which I have      given unto you.        22. Therefore let my servant Baurak Ale (Joseph Smith, Jun.,) say      unto the strength of my house, my young men and the middle aged,      gather yourselves together unto the land of Zion, upon the land      which I have bought with money that has been consecrated unto me:        23. And let all the churches send up wise men with their moneys,      and purchase lands even as I have commanded them;        24. And inasmuch as mine enemies come against you to drive you from      my goodly land, which I have consecrated to be the land of Zion:      even from your own lands after these testimonies, which ye have      brought before me against them, ye shall curse them;        {38} 25. And whomsoever ye curse, I will curse, and ye shall avenge      me of mine enemies;        26. And my presence shall be with you even in avenging me of mine      enemies, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.        27. Let no man be afraid to lay down his life for my sake, for      whoso layeth down his life for my sake shall find it again;        28. And whoso is not willing to lay down his life for my sake is      not my disciple.        29. It is my will that my servant Sidney Rigdon shall lift up his      voice in the congregations in the eastern countries, in preparing      the churches to keep the commandments which I have given unto them      concerning the restoration and redemption of Zion.        30. It is my will that my servant Parley P. Pratt and my servant      Lyman Wight should not return to the land of their brethren, until      they have obtained companies to go up unto the land of Zion, by      tens, or by twenties, or by fifties, or by an hundred, until they      have obtained to the number of five hundred of the strength of my      house.        31. Behold this is my will; ask and ye shall receive; but men do      not always do my will;        32. Therefore, if you cannot obtain five hundred, seek diligently      that peradventure you may obtain three hundred;        33. And if ye cannot obtain three hundred, seek diligently, that      peradventure ye may obtain one hundred.        34. But verily I say unto you, a commandment I give unto you, that      ye shall not go up unto the land of Zion, until you have obtained      a hundred of the strength of my house, to go up with you unto the      land of Zion.        35. Therefore as I said unto you, ask and ye shall receive; pray      earnestly that peradventure my servant Baurak Ale (Joseph Smith,      Jun.,) may go with you, and preside in the midst of my people, and      organize my kingdom upon the consecrated land, and establish the      children of Zion upon the laws and commandments which have been and      which shall be given unto you.        36. All victory and glory is brought to pass unto you through your      diligence, faithfulness, and prayers of faith.        37. Let my servant Parley P. Pratt journey with my servant Joseph      Smith, Jun.        38. Let my servant Lyman Wight journey with my servant Sidney      Rigdon.        39. Let my servant Hyrum Smith journey with my servant Frederick G.      Williams.        40. Let my servant Orson Hyde journey with my servant Orson Pratt,      {39} whithersoever my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., shall counsel      them, in obtaining the fulfillment of these commandments which I      have given unto you, and leave the residue in my hands. Even so.      Amen.    [Sidenote: Arrival of Delegation from the Church in Missouri.]    The High Council of the Church also met this day at my house for the  purpose of giving an audience or hearing to Lyman Wight and Parley P.  Pratt, delegates from the Church in Missouri, to represent to us the  state of the Church in that place.        _Minutes of Council Meeting_.        President Joseph opened the Council by prayer. Two of the standing      Councilors were absent, namely, Joseph Coe and John Smith. Hyrum      Smith was chosen to act in the place of John Smith, and John P.      Greene to act in the place of Joseph Coe. Thus the High Council was      organized, and six Councilors were appointed to speak. Brothers      Parley P. Pratt and Lyman Wight, messengers from Zion, arose,      and laid their business before the Council, and delivered their      message, the substance of which was: when, how and by what means      Zion was to be redeemed from her enemies. They said that our      brethren who had been driven away from their lands and scattered      abroad, had found so much favor in the eyes of the people [of Clay      county, Mo.,] that they could obtain food and raiment of them for      their labor, insomuch that they were comfortable. But the idea of      their being driven away from the land of Zion pained their very      souls, and they desired of God, by earnest prayer, to return with      songs of everlasting joy, as said Isaiah, the prophet.        They also said that none of their lands were sold into the hands      of our enemies, except a piece of thirty acres owned by Brother      William E. McLellin, which he sold into the hands of the enemy, and      seven acres more which he would have sold to the enemy if a brother      had not come forward and purchased it and paid him his money.        Brother Joseph then arose, and said that he was going to Zion, to      assist in redeeming it. He called for the voice of the Council to      sanction his going, which was given without a dissenting voice.      He then called for volunteers to go with him, when some thirty      or forty volunteered to go, who were present at the Council. It      was a question whether the company should go by water or by land,      and after a short investigation it was decided unanimously that      they go by land. Joseph Smith, Jun., was nominated to be the      commander-in-chief of the armies of Israel, and the leader of those      who volunteered to go and assist in {40} the redemption of Zion;      the nomination was seconded and carried by the vote of all present.      Council then adjourned by prayer and thanksgiving.        Orson Hyde,        Oliver Cowdery,        Clerks.    [Sidenote: The Prophet seeks Volunteers to Redeem Zion.]    _February 26_.--I started from home to obtain volunteers for Zion,  in compliance with the foregoing revelation and action of the High  Council; and on the 27th, stayed at Brother Roundy's.    To show the feelings of a certain portion of the public, at this  period, I copy the following from the February number of the _Evening  and Morning Star_, page 271:        We copy the following article from the _North Star_, headed \"The      Mormons,\" printed in Danville, Vermont, by E. Eaton:        \"We have received the first number of the 'Mormon' _Morning and      Evening Star_ [the _Evening and Morning Star_], resuscitated in      Kirtland, Ohio. _It is the same assuming, mysterious publication as      its original_.\"    [Sidenote: Cheering Words.]    While the press and many of the public were breathing the spirit of  bitterness against the work of God, I received letters from many of our  friends, which gave us occasion for rejoicing: amongst them, I extract  from Brother Moses Chapman Nickerson's letter of December 20, 1833. [2]  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#17)"],[1," from those rules, seem  to consider signs rather than causes. A man may well understand  natural signs without knowing their analogy, or being able to say  by what rule a thing is so or so. And, as it is very possible to  write improperly, through too strict an observance of general grammar  rules; so, in arguing from general laws of nature, it is not impossible  we may extend the analogy too far, and by that means run into mistakes.    109. As in reading other books a wise man will choose to fix his thoughts  on the sense and apply it to use, rather than lay them out in grammatical  remarks on the language; so, in perusing the volume of nature, it seems  beneath the dignity of the mind to affect an exactness in reducing each  particular phenomenon to general rules, or showing how it follows from  them. We should propose to ourselves nobler views, namely, to recreate  and exalt the mind with a prospect of the beauty, order. extent, and  variety of natural things: hence, by proper inferences, to enlarge our  notions of the grandeur, wisdom, and beneficence of the Creator; and  lastly, to make the several parts of the creation, so far as in us lies,  subservient to the ends they were designed for, God's glory, and the  sustentation and comfort of ourselves and fellow-creatures.    110. The best key for the aforesaid analogy or natural Science will be  easily acknowledged to be a certain celebrated Treatise of Mechanics. In  the entrance of which justly admired treatise, Time, Space, and Motion  are distinguished into absolute and relative, true and apparent,  mathematical and vulgar; which distinction, as it is at large explained  by the author, does suppose these quantities to have an existence without  the mind; and that they are ordinarily conceived with relation to  sensible things, to which nevertheless in their own nature they bear no  relation at all.    111. As for Time, as it is there taken in an absolute or abstracted  sense, for the duration or perseverance of the existence of things, I  have nothing more to add concerning it after what has been already said  on that subject. Sect. 97 and 98. For the rest, this celebrated author  holds there is an absolute Space, which, being unperceivable to sense,  remains in itself similar and immovable; and relative space to be the  measure thereof, which, being movable and defined by its situation in  respect of sensible bodies, is vulgarly taken for immovable space. Place  he defines to be that part of space which is occupied by any body; and  according as the space is absolute or relative so also is the place.  Absolute Motion is said to be the translation of a body from absolute  place to absolute place, as relative motion is from one relative place to  another. And, because the parts of absolute space do not fall under our  senses, instead of them we are obliged to use their sensible measures,  and so define both place and motion with respect to bodies which we  regard as immovable. But, it is said in philosophical matters we must  abstract from our senses, since it may be that none of those bodies which  seem to be quiescent are truly so, and the same thing which is moved  relatively may be really at rest; as likewise one and the same body may  be in relative rest and motion, or even moved with contrary relative  motions at the same time, according as its place is variously defined.  All which ambiguity is to be found in the apparent motions, but not at  all in the true or absolute, which should therefore be alone regarded in  philosophy. And the true as we are told are distinguished from apparent  or relative motions by the following properties.--First, in true or  absolute motion all parts which preserve the same position with respect  of the whole, partake of the motions of the whole. Secondly, the place  being moved, that which is placed therein is also moved; so that a body  moving in a place which is in motion doth participate the motion of its  place. Thirdly, true motion is never generated or changed otherwise than  by force impressed on the body itself. Fourthly, true motion is always  changed by force impressed on the body moved. Fifthly, in circular motion  barely relative there is no centrifugal force, which, nevertheless, in  that which is true or absolute, is proportional to the quantity of  motion.    112. MOTION, WHETHER REAL OR APPARENT, RELATIVE.--But, notwithstanding  what has been said, I must confess it does not appear to me that  there can be any motion other than relative; so that to conceive  motion there must be at least conceived two bodies, whereof the  distance or position in regard to each other is varied. Hence, if there  was one only body in being it could not possibly be moved. This seems  evident, in that the idea I have of motion doth necessarily include  relation.    113. APPARENT MOTION DENIED.--But, though in every motion it be  necessary to conceive more bodies than one, yet it may be that one  only is moved, namely, that on which the force causing the change  in the distance or situation of the bodies, is impressed. For, however  some may define relative motion, so as to term that body moved  which changes its distance from some other body, whether the force  or action causing that change were impressed on it or no, yet as  relative motion is that which is perceived by sense, and regarded in  the ordinary affairs of life, it should seem that every man of common  sense knows what it is as well as the best philosopher. Now, I ask any  one whether, in his sense of motion as he walks along the streets, the  stones he passes over may be said to move, because they change distance  with his feet? To me it appears that though motion includes a relation of  one thing to another, yet it is not necessary that each term of the  relation be denominated from it. As a man may think of somewhat which  does not think, so a body may be moved to or from another body which is  not therefore itself in motion.    114. As the place happens to be variously defined, the motion which is  related to it varies. A man in a ship may be said to be quiescent with  relation to the sides of the vessel, and yet move with relation to the  land. Or he may move eastward in respect of the one, and westward in  respect of the other. In the common affairs of life men never go beyond  the earth to define the place of any body; and what is quiescent in  respect of that is accounted absolutely to be so. But philosophers, who  have a greater extent of thought, and juster notions of the system of  things, discover even the earth itself to be moved. In order therefore to  fix their notions they seem to conceive the corporeal world as finite,  and the utmost unmoved walls or shell thereof to be the place whereby  they estimate true motions. If we sound our own conceptions, I believe we  may find all the absolute motion we can frame an idea of to be at bottom  no other than relative motion thus defined. For, as has been already  observed, absolute motion, exclusive of all external relation, is  incomprehensible; and to this kind of relative motion all the  above-mentioned properties, causes, and effects ascribed to absolute  motion will, if I mistake not, be found to agree. As to what is said of  the centrifugal force, that it does not at all belong to circular  relative motion, I do not see how this follows from the experiment which  is brought to prove it. See Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica,  in Schol. Def. VIII. For the water in the vessel at that time wherein it  is said to have the greatest relative circular motion, has, I think, no  motion at all; as is plain from the foregoing section.    115. For, to denominate a body moved it is requisite, first, that it  change its distance or situation with regard to some other body; and  secondly, that the force occasioning that change be applied to it. If  either of these be wanting, I do not think that, agreeably to the sense  of mankind, or the propriety of language, a body can be said to be in  motion. I grant indeed that it is possible for us to think a body which  we see change its distance from some other to be moved, though it have no  force applied to it (in which sense there may be apparent motion), but  then it is because the force causing the change of distance is imagined  by us to be applied or impressed on that body thought to move; which  indeed shows we are capable of mistaking a thing to be in motion which is  not, and that is all.    116. ANY IDEA OF PURE SPACE RELATIVE.--From what has been said it follows  that the philosophic consideration of motion does not imply the  being of an absolute Space, distinct from that which is perceived  by sense and related bodies; which that it cannot exist without the  mind is clear upon the same principles that demonstrate the like  of all other objects of sense. And perhaps, if we inquire narrowly,  we shall find we cannot even frame an idea of pure Space exclusive  of all body. This I must confess seems impossible, as being a most  abstract idea. When I excite a motion in some part of my body,  if it be free or without resistance, I say there is Space; but if I  find a resistance, then I say there is Body; and in proportion as the  resistance to motion is lesser or greater, I say the space is more or  less pure. So that when I speak of pure or empty space, it is not to be  supposed that the word \"space\" stands for an idea distinct from or  conceivable without body and motion--though indeed we are apt to think  every noun substantive stands for a distinct idea that may be separated  from all others; which has occasioned infinite mistakes. When, therefore,  supposing all the world to be annihilated besides my own body, I say  there still remains pure Space, thereby nothing else is meant but only  that I conceive it possible for the limbs of my body to be moved on all  sides without the least resistance, but if that, too, were annihilated  then there"]]]
