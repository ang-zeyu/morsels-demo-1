But the sales were enormous,  ten times as large as  Tabitha Twitchit's.    As there was always no  money, Ginger and Pickles  were obliged to eat their own  goods.    Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger  ate a dried haddock.    They ate them by candle-  light after the shop was  closed.      \"It is very uncomfortable, I  am afraid I shall be summoned.  I have tried in vain to  get a license upon credit at the  Post Office;\" said Pickles.  \"The place is full of policemen.  I met one as I was coming  home.    \"Let us send in the bill  again to Samuel Whiskers,  Ginger, he owes 22/9 for  bacon.\"    \"I do not believe that he  intends to pay at all,\" replied  Ginger.    When it came to Jan. 1st  there was still no money, and  Pickles was unable to buy a  dog license.    \"It is very unpleasant, I am  afraid of the police,\" said  Pickles.    \"It is your own fault for  being a terrier; _I_ do not  require a license, and neither  does Kep, the Collie dog.\"      \"And I feel sure that Anna  Maria pockets things--    \"Where are all the cream  crackers?\"    \"You have eaten them yourself.\"  replied Ginger.    Ginger and Pickles retired  into the back parlor.    They did accounts. They  added up sums and sums, and  sums.    \"Samuel Whiskers has run  up a bill as long as his tail; he  has had an ounce and three-  quarters of snuff since October.    \"What is seven pounds of  butter at 1/3, and a stick of  sealing wax and four  matches?\"    \"Send in all the bills again  to everybody `with compliments,'\"  replied Ginger.      Pickles nearly had a fit, he  barked and he barked and  made little rushes.    \"Bite him, Pickles! bite  him!\" spluttered Ginger behind  a sugar barrel, \"he's only  a German doll!\"    The policeman went on  writing in his notebook; twice  he put his pencil in his mouth,  and once he dipped it in the  treacle.    Pickles barked till he was  hoarse. But still the policeman  took no notice. He had bead  eyes, and his helmet was  sewed on with stitches.    After a time they heard a  noise in the shop, as if something  had been pushed in at  the door. They came out of the  back parlor. There was an  envelope lying on the counter,  and a policeman writing in a  notebook!      At length on his last little  rush--Pickles found that the  shop was empty. The policeman  had disappeared.    But the envelope remained.    \"Do you think that he has  gone to fetch a real live policeman?  I am afraid it is a summons,\"  said Pickles.    \"No,\" replied Ginger, who  had opened the envelope, \"it is  the rates and taxes, 3 pounds 19  11 3/4.\"  [pounds are British money,  the 19 is schillings, and then pence]    \"This is the last straw,\" said  Pickles, \"let us close the shop.\"    They put up the shutters,  and left. But they have not  removed from the neighborhood.  In fact some people  wish they had gone further.      Ginger is living in the warren  [game preserve for rabbits].  I do not know what  occupation he pursues; he  looks stout and comfortable.    Pickles is at present a game-  keeper.      After a time Mr. John  Dormouse and his daughter  began to sell peppermints and  candles.    But they did not keep \"self-  fitting sixes\"; and it takes five  mice to carry one seven inch  candle.    The closing of the shop  caused great inconvenience.  Tabitha Twitchit immediately  raised the price of everything  a halfpenny; and she continued  to refuse to give credit.      Of course there are the  tradesmen's carts--the butcher,  the fishman and Timothy  Baker.    But a person cannot live on  \"seed wigs\" and sponge cake  and butter buns--not even  when the sponge cake is as  good as Timothy's!      And Miss Dormouse refused  to take back the ends when  they were brought back to her  with complaints.    And when Mr. John  Dormouse was complained to, he  stayed in bed, and would say  nothing but \"very snug;\"  which is not the way to carry  on a retail business.    Besides--the candles which  they sell behave very strangely  in warm weather.    So everybody was pleased  when Sally Henny Penny sent  out a printed poster to say  that she was going to reopen  the shop--\"Henny's Opening  Sale! Grand cooperative Jumble!  Penny's penny prices!  Come buy, come try, come  buy!\"    The poster really was most  'ticing.      There was a rush upon the  opening day. The shop was  crammed with customers,  and there were crowds of  mice upon the biscuit cannisters.    Sally Henny Penny gets  rather flustered when she tries  to count out change, and she  insists on being paid cash; but  she is quite harmless.    And she has laid in a  remarkable assortment of  bargains.    There is something to  please everybody.

I lived in a log-cabin.  I bought a horse, and rode every day. I kept in the open air, and, after  a while, I found my strength returning and my chest expanding, and in a  twelvemonth I could afford to laugh at doctors.\"    \"And you have never had a return of the old symptoms?\" asked Melville,  with interest.    \"Never, except four years afterwards, when I went to New York and  remained nearly a year. I am now fifty, and rather hale and hearty for  my years, eh?\"    \"Decidedly so.\"    \"Let me advise you to follow my example, Mr. Melville.\"    \"It was my intention when I started West to live very much as you  indicated,\" said Melville. \"Now that I have heard your experience, I am  confirmed in my resolve.\"    \"Good! I am glad to hear it. When do you leave Chicago?\"    \"To-morrow, probably.\"    \"And how far West do you intend to go?\"    \"I have thought of Colorado.\"    \"Couldn't do better. I know Colorado like a book. In fact, I own some  valuable mining property there, up in--ahem! Gilpin County. By the  way--I take it you are a rich man--why don't you invest in that way?  Perhaps, however, you have it in view?\"    \"No, I haven't thought of it,\" answered Melville. \"The fact is, I am not  anxious to become richer, having enough for all my present needs.\"    \"Just so,\" said the colonel. \"But you might marry.\"    \"Even if I did--\"    \"You would have money enough,\" said Col. Warner, finishing the sentence  for him. \"Well, I am delighted to hear it. I am very well fixed  myself--in fact, some of my friends call me, ha! ha!--the nabob. But,  as I was saying I am rich enough and to spare, and still--you may be  surprised--still I have no objection to making a little more money.\"    Col. Warner nodded his head vigorously, and watched George Melville to  see the effect upon him of this extraordinary statement.    \"Very natural, colonel,\" said Melville. \"I believe most people want to  be richer. Perhaps if I had vigorous health I might have the same wish.  At present my chief wish is to recover my health.\"    \"You'll do it, sir, you'll do it--and in short order, too! Then you can  turn your attention to money-making.\"    \"Perhaps so,\" said Melville, with a smile.    \"If not for yourself, for your young friend here,\" added the colonel. \"I  take it he is not rich.\"    \"I have my fortune still to make, Col. Warner,\" said Herbert, smiling.    \"The easiest thing in the world out here, my boy!\" said the colonel,  paternally. \"So you start to-morrow?\" he inquired, turning to Melville.    \"I think of it.\"    \"Egad! I've a great mind to accompany you,\" said the colonel. \"Why  shouldn't I? I've got through all my business in Chicago, and I like the  pure air of the prairies best.\"    \"We shall be glad of your company, colonel,\" said Melville, politely.    \"Thank you, sir; that decides me. I'll see you again and fix the hour of  going, or rather I'll conform myself to your arrangements.\"    \"Very well, colonel.\"    \"What do you think of my new acquaintance, Col. Warner, Herbert?\" asked  Melville when they were alone.    \"He seems to have a very good opinion of himself,\" answered Herbert.    \"Yes, he is very well pleased with himself. He isn't a man exactly to my  taste, but he seems a representative Western man. He does not look much  like a consumptive?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"I feel an interest in him on that account,\" said Melville, seriously.  \"If at any time I could become as strong and stalwart I would willingly  surrender one-half, nay nine-tenths of my fortune. Ill health is a great  drag upon a man; it largely curtails his enjoyments, and deprives him of  all ambition.\"    \"I don't see why his remedy wouldn't work well in your case, Mr.  Melville,\" said Herbert, earnestly.    \"Perhaps it may. At any rate, I feel inclined to try it. I am glad the  colonel is going to travel with us, as I shall be able to question him  about the details of his cure. He seems a bluff, genial fellow, and  though I don't expect to enjoy his companionship much, I hope to derive  some benefit from it.\"    \"By the way, Mr. Melville, I met an old acquaintance while I was out  walking,\" said Herbert.    \"Indeed!\"    \"Eben Graham.\"    \"How did he look--prosperous?\"    \"Hardly--he was wheeling a barrow of vegetables.\"    \"Did you speak with him?\"    \"Yes; he wanted to borrow money.\"    \"I am not surprised at that; I thought it time for him to be out of  money. Did you lend him?\"    \"No; I found he wanted money to buy a lottery ticket. I told him I  wouldn't lend money to my best friend for that purpose.\"    \"Very sensible in you, Herbert.\"    \"If he had been in distress, I might have let him have a few dollars,  notwithstanding he treated me so meanly at Wayneboro, but he seems to be  earning a living.\"    \"I presume he doesn't enjoy the business he is in?\"    \"No; he complains that he has lowered himself by accepting such a  place.\"    \"It doesn't occur to him that he lowered himself when he stole money  from his father, I suppose.\"    \"It doesn't seem to.\"    Later in the day Herbert came across Col. Warner in the corridor of the  hotel.    \"Ha! my young friend!\" he said, affably. \"I am glad to meet you.\"    \"Thank you, sir.\"    \"And how is your friend?\"    \"No change since morning,\" answered Herbert, slightly smiling.    \"By the way, Herbert--your name is Herbert, isn't it--may I offer you a  cigar?\" said Col. Warner.    The colonel opened his cigar-case and extended it to Herbert.    \"Thank you, sir, but I don't smoke.\"    \"Don't smoke? That is, you don't smoke cigars. May I offer you a  cigarette?\"    \"I don't smoke at all, colonel.\"    \"Indeed, remarkable! Why, sir, before I was your age I smoked.\"    \"Do you think it good for consumption?\" asked Herbert.    \"Ha, ha, you have me there! Well, perhaps not. Do you know,\" said the  colonel, changing the conversation, \"I feel a great interest in your  friend.\"    \"You are very kind.\"    \"'Upon my soul, I do. He is a most interesting young man. Rich, too! I  am glad he is rich!\"    \"He would value health more than money,\" said Herbert.    \"To be sure, to be sure! By the way, you don't know how much property  your friend has?\"    \"No, sir, he never told me,\" answered Herbert, surprised at the  question.    \"Keeps such matters close, eh? Now, I don't. I never hesitate to own up  to a quarter of a million. Yes, quarter of a million! That's the size of  my pile.\"    \"You are fortunate, Col. Warner,\" said Herbert, sincerely.    \"So I am, so I am! Two years hence I shall have half a million, if all  goes well. So you won't have a cigar; no? Well, I'll see you later.\"    \"He's a strange man,\" thought Herbert. \"I wonder if his statements  can be relied upon.\" Somehow Herbert doubted it. He was beginning to  distrust the colonel.          CHAPTER XXII. A MOUNTAIN STAGE.        We pass over several days, and change the scene. We left Herbert and  Melville in the Palmer House in Chicago, surrounded by stately edifices  and surging crowds. Now everything is changed. They are in a mountainous  district, where a man might ride twenty miles without seeing a house.  They are, in fact, within the limits of what was then known as the  Territory of Colorado. It is not generally known that Colorado contains  over a hundred mountain summits over ten thousand feet above the sea  level. It is perhaps on account of the general elevation that it is  recommended by physicians as a good health resort for all who are  troubled with lung complaints.    At the time of which I speak most of the traveling was done by stage.  Now railroads unite the different portions with links of steel, and make  traveling less cumbersome and laborious. There was one of the party,  however, who did not complain, but rather enjoyed the jolting of the  lumbering stage-coach.    Col. Warner was of the party. He professed to feel an extraordinary  interest in George Melville, and was anxious to show him the country  where he had himself regained his health.    \"Lonely, sir!\" repeated the colonel, in answer to a remark of George  Melville. \"Why, sir, it's a populous city compared with what it was in  '55, when I was out here. I built myself a cabin in the woods, and once  for twelve months I didn't see a white face.\"    \"Were there many Indians, Colonel?\" asked Herbert.    \"Indians? I should say so. Only twenty miles from my cabin was an Indian  village.\"    \"Did they trouble you any?\" asked Herbert, curiously.    \"Well, they tried to,\" answered the colonel. \"One night as I lay awake I  heard stealthy steps outside, and peeping through a crevice between the  logs just above the head of my bed--by the way, my bed was the skin of  a bear I had myself killed--I could see a string of Utes preparing to  besiege me.\"    \"Were you afraid?\" asked Herbert, a little mischievously, for he knew  pretty well what the colonel would say.    \"Afraid!\" repeated the colonel, indignantly. \"What do you take me for? I  have plenty of faults,\" continued Col. Warner, modestly, \"but cowardice  isn't one of them. No, sir; I never yet saw the human being, white,  black, or red, that I stood in fear of. But, as I was saying, the  redskins collected around my cabin, and were preparing to break in the  door, when I leveled my revolver and brought down their foremost man.  This threw them into confusion. They retreated a little way, then  advanced again with a horrible yell, and I gave myself up for lost. But  I got in another shot, bringing down another warrior, this time the son  of their chief. The same scene was repeated. Well, to make a long story  short, I repulsed them at every advance, and finally when but three were  left, they concluded that prudence was the better part of valor, and  fled, leaving their dead and wounded behind them.\"    \"How many were there of them?\""]]]
