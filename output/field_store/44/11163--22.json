Selah.    19:082:003 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted             and needy.    19:082:004 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the             wicked.    19:082:005 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in             darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.    19:082:006 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the             most High.    19:082:007 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.    19:082:008 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all             nations.    19:083:001 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not             still, O God.    19:083:002 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee             have lifted up the head.    19:083:003 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and             consulted against thy hidden ones.    19:083:004 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a             nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.    19:083:005 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are             confederate against thee:    19:083:006 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the             Hagarenes;    19:083:007 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the             inhabitants of Tyre;    19:083:008 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children             of Lot. Selah.    19:083:009 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to             Jabin, at the brook of Kison:    19:083:010 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.    19:083:011 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their             princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:    19:083:012 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in             possession.    19:083:013 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the             wind.    19:083:014 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the             mountains on fire;    19:083:015 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with             thy storm.    19:083:016 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O             LORD.    19:083:017 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be             put to shame, and perish:    19:083:018 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art             the most high over all the earth.    19:084:001 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!    19:084:002 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the             LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.    19:084:003 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest             for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O             LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.    19:084:004 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still             praising thee. Selah.    19:084:005 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart             are the ways of them.    19:084:006 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the             rain also filleth the pools.    19:084:007 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion             appeareth before God.    19:084:008 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.             Selah.    19:084:009 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine             anointed.    19:084:010 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had             rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell             in the tents of wickedness.    19:084:011 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace             and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk             uprightly.    19:084:012 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.    19:085:001 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast             brought back the captivity of Jacob.    19:085:002 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast             covered all their sin. Selah.    19:085:003 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself             from the fierceness of thine anger.    19:085:004 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward             us to cease.    19:085:005 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine             anger to all generations?    19:085:006 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in             thee?    19:085:007 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.    19:085:008 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak             peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not             turn again to folly.    19:085:009 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory             may dwell in our land.    19:085:010 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have             kissed each other.    19:085:011 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall             look down from heaven.    19:085:012 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land             shall yield her increase.    19:085:013 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way             of his steps.    19:086:001 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.    19:086:002 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy             servant that trusteth in thee.    19:086:003 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.    19:086:004 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I             lift up my soul.    19:086:005 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous             in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.    19:086:006 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of             my supplications.    19:086:007 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt             answer me.    19:086:008 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither             are there any works like unto thy works.    19:086:009 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before             thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.    19:086:010 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God             alone.    19:086:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my             heart to fear thy name.    19:086:012 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I             will glorify thy name for evermore.    19:086:013 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my             soul from the lowest hell.    19:086:014 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of             violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee             before them.    19:086:015 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,             longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.    19:086:016 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto             thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.    19:086:017 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,             and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and             comforted me.    19:087:001 His foundation is in the holy mountains.    19:087:002 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings             of Jacob.    19:087:003 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.    19:087:004 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:             behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born             there.    19:087:005 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in             her: and the highest himself shall establish her.    19:087:006 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this             man was born there. Selah.    19:087:007 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be             there: all my springs are in thee.    19:088:001 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before             thee:    19:088:002 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;    19:088:003 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto             the grave.    19:088:004 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a             man that hath no strength:    19:088:005 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave,             whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy             hand.    19:088:006 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the             deeps.    19:088:007 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with             all thy waves. Selah.    19:088:008 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast             made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot             come forth.    19:088:009 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called             daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.    19:088:010 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and             praise thee?

Though I do not pretend to be very prophetic,                  I fancy I know what you're going to say                By a pushing young Monarch, of turn energetic,                  A very great deal may be done in a day!      ALL (astonished).          Oh, it's simply uncanny, his power prophetic            It's perfectly rightwe were going to say,                By a pushing, etc.      Enter JULIA, at back.      LUD. (recit.).    This very afternoonat two (about)          The Court appointments will be given out.          To each and all (for that was the condition)          According to professional position!      ALL.              Hurrah!      JULIA (coming forward).  According to professional position?      LUD.  According to professional position!      JULIA  Then, horror!      ALL.  Why, what's the matter?  What's the matter?  What's the                matter?      SONGJULIA. (LISA clinging to her.)          Ah, pity me, my comrades true,          Who love, as well I know you do,                This gentle child,                      To me so fondly dear!      ALL.                    Why, what's the matter?

JULIA  Each sympathetic heart 'twill bruise          When you have heard the frightful news                (O will it not?)                      That I must now impart!      ALL.                    Why, what's the matter?      JULIA.  Her love for him is all in all!          Ah, cursed fate! that it should fall                Unto my lot                      To break my darling's heart!
