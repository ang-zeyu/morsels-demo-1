Out of that process, we have learned to think as a nation.  And out  of that process we have learned to feel ourselves a nation.  As  never before in our history, each section of America says to every  other section, \"Thy people shall be my people.\"    For most of the country this has been a good year--better in  dollars and cents than for many years--far better in the soundness  of its prosperity.  And everywhere I went I found particular  optimism about the good effect on business which is expected from  the steady spending by farmers of the largest farm income in many  years.    But we have not yet done all that must be done to make this  prosperity stable.  The people of the United States were checked in  their efforts to prevent future piling up of huge agricultural  surpluses and the tumbling prices which inevitably follow them.  They were checked in their efforts to secure reasonable minimum  wages and maximum hours and the end of child labor.  And because  they were checked, many groups in many parts of the country still  have less purchasing power and a lower standard of living than the  nation as a whole can permanently allow.    Americans realize these facts.  That is why they ask government not  to stop governing simply because prosperity has come back a long  way.    They do not look on government as an interloper in their affairs.  On the contrary, they regard it as the most effective form of  organized self-help.    Sometimes I get bored sitting in Washington hearing certain people  talk and talk about all that government ought _not_ do--people who  got all _they_ wanted from government back in the days when the  financial institutions and the railroads were being bailed out by  the government in 1933.  It is refreshing to go out through the  country and feel the common wisdom that the time to repair the roof  is when the sun is shining.    They want the financial budget balanced.  But they want the human  budget balanced as well.  They want to set up a national economy  which balances itself with as little government subsidy as  possible, for they realize that persistent subsidies ultimately  bankrupt their government.    They are less concerned that every detail be immediately right than  they are that the direction be right.  They know that just so long  as we are traveling on the right road, it does not make much  difference if occasionally we hit a \"Thank you marm.\"    The overwhelming majority of our citizens who live by agriculture  are thinking very clearly how they want government to help them in  connection with the production of crops.  They want government help  in two ways:  first, in the control of surpluses, and, second, in  the proper use of land.    The other day a reporter told me that he had never been able to  understand why the government seeks to curtail crop production and,  at the same time, to open up new irrigated acres.    He was confusing two totally separate objectives.    Crop surplus control relates to the total amount of any major crop  grown in the whole nation on all cultivated land--good or bad--  control by the cooperation of the crop growers and with the help of  the government.  Land use, on the other hand, is a policy of  providing each farmer with the best quality and type of land we  have, or can make available, for his part in that total production.  Adding good new land for diversified crops is offset by abandoning  poor land now uneconomically farmed.    The total amount of production largely determines the price of the  crop, and, therefore, the difference between comfort and misery for  the farmer.    If we Americans were foolish enough to run every shoe factory  twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, we would soon have more  shoes than the nation could possibly buy--a surplus of shoes so  great that it would have to be destroyed, or given away, or sold at  prices far below the cost of production.  That simple law of supply  and demand equally affects the price of all our major crops.    You and I have heard big manufacturers talk about control of  production by the farmer as an indefensible \"economy of scarcity.\"  And yet these same manufacturers never hesitate to shut down their  own huge plants, throw men out of work, and cut down the purchasing  power of whole communities whenever they think that they must  adjust their production to an oversupply of the goods they make.  When it is their baby who has the measles, they call it not \"an  economy of scarcity\" but \"sound business judgment.\"    Of course, speaking seriously, what you and I want is such  governmental rules of the game that labor and agriculture and  industry will all produce a balanced abundance without waste.    So we intend this winter to find a way to prevent four-and-a-half  cent cotton, nine cent corn and thirty cent wheat--with all the  disaster those prices mean for all of us--to prevent those prices  from ever coming back again.  To do that, the farmers themselves  want to cooperate to build an all-weather farm program so that in  the long run prices will be more stable.  They believe this can be  done, and the national budget kept out of the red.    And when we have found that way to protect the farmers' prices from  the effects of alternating crop surpluses and crop scarcities, we  shall also have found the way to protect the nation's food supply  from the effects of the same fluctuation.  We ought always to have  enough food at prices within the reach of the consuming public.  For  the consumers in the cities of America, we must find a way to help  the farmers to store up in years of plenty enough to avoid hardship  in the years of scarcity.    Our land use policy is a different thing.  I have just visited much  of the work that the national government is doing to stop soil  erosion, to save our forests, to prevent floods, to produce  electric power for more general use, and to give people a chance to  move from poor land on to better land by irrigating thousands of  acres that need only water to provide an opportunity to make a good  living.    I saw bare and burned hillsides where only a few years ago great  forests were growing.  They are now being planted to young trees,  not only to stop erosion, but to provide a lumber supply for the  future.    I saw C.C.C. boys and W.P.A. workers building check-dams and small  ponds and terraces to raise the water table and make it possible  for farms and villages to remain in safety where they now are.  I  saw the harnessing of the turbulent Missouri, muddy with the  topsoil of many states.  And I saw barges on new channels carrying  produce and freight athwart the nation.    Let me give you two simple illustrations of why government projects  of this type have a national importance for the whole country.    In the Boise Valley in Idaho I saw a district which had been  recently irrigated to enormous fertility so that a family can now  make a pretty good living from forty acres of its land.  Many of the  families, who are making good in that valley today, moved there  from a thousand miles away.  They came from the dust strip that runs  through the middle of the nation all the way from the Canadian  border to Mexico, a strip which includes large portions of ten  states.  That valley in western Idaho, therefore, assumes at once a  national importance as a second chance for willing farmers.  And,  year by year, we propose to add more valleys to take care of  thousands of other families who need the same kind of second chance  in new green pastures.    The other illustration was at the Grand Coulee Dam in the state of  Washington.  The engineer in charge told me that almost half of the  whole cost of that dam to date had been spent for materials that  were manufactured east of the Mississippi River, giving employment  and wages to thousands of industrial workers in the eastern third  of the nation, two thousand miles away.    All of this work needs, of course, a more businesslike system of  planning and greater foresight than we use today.    That is why I recommended to the last session of the Congress the  creation of seven planning regions, in which local people will  originate and coordinate recommendations as to the kind of this  work of this kind to be done in their particular regions.  The  Congress will, of course, determine the projects to be selected  within the budget limits.    To carry out any twentieth century program, we must give the  Executive branch of the government twentieth century machinery to  work with.  I recognize that democratic processes are necessarily  and rightly slower than dictatorial processes.  But I refuse to  believe that democratic processes need be dangerously slow.    For many years we have all known that the Executive and  Administrative departments of the government in Washington are a  higgledy-piggledy patchwork of duplicate responsibilities and  overlapping powers.  The reorganization of this vast government  machinery which I proposed to the Congress last winter does not  conflict with the principle of the democratic process, as some  people say.  It only makes that process work more efficiently.    On my recent trip many people have talked to me about the millions  of men and women and children who still work at insufficient wages  and overlong hours.    American industry has searched the outside world to find new  markets--but it can create on its very doorstep the biggest and  most permanent market it has ever had.  It needs the reduction of  trade barriers to improve its foreign markets, but it should not  overlook the chance to reduce the domestic trade barrier right  here--right away--without waiting for any treaty.  A few more  dollars a week in wages, a better distribution of jobs with a  shorter working day will almost overnight make millions of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],[0,"The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#17)"],[1,"you any good, nor the money at the banker's  neither.\"    \"Ve see about zat, monsieur. Proceed,\" and Captain Villaire waved  his hand toward Dan Baxter.    \"This is the situation in a nutshell, to come right down to  business,\" said the former bully of Putnam Hall coolly.  \"You are  our prisoners, and you can't get away, no matter how hard you try.  Captain Villaire and his men, as well as myself, are in this  affair to make money.  The question is, what is your liberty worth  to you?\"    \"So you intend to work such a game?\" demanded Dick.    \"That's the game, yes.\"    \"Well, I shan't pay you a cent.\"    \"Don't be a fool, Dick Rover.  We are not to be trifled with.\"    \"Well, I haven't any money, and that ends it.  You already have  all I had.\"    \"Then you will have to foot the bill,\" continued Dan Baxter,  turning to Randolph Rover.    \"If you value your liberty you will pay us what we demand.\"    \"And what do you demand?\" questioned Mr. Rover.    \"We demand twenty thousand dollars--ten thousand for the liberty  of each.\"    This demand nearly took away Randolph Rover's breath.    \"Twenty thousand dollars!\" he gasped.  \"It is--is preposterous!\"    \"Is it?  You are worth a good deal more than that, Mr. Rover.  And  I am demanding only what is fair.\"    \"You shall never get the money.\"    \"Won't we?\"    \"Never!\"    \"Perhaps you'll sing a different tune in a few, days--after your  stomachs get empty,\" responded Dan Baxter, with a malicious gleam  in his fishy eyes.  \"So you mean to starve us into acceding to your  demands,\" said Dick.  \"Baxter, I always did put you down as a  first-class rascal.  If you keep, on, you'll be more of a one than  your father.\"    In high rage the former bully of Putnam Hall strode forward and  without warning struck the defenseless Dick a heavy blow on the  cheek.    \"That, for your impudence,\" he snarled.  \"You keep a civil tongue  in your head. If you don't--\"  He finished with a shake of his  fist.    \"You had bettair make up your mind to pay ze monish,\" said Captain  Villaire, after a painful pause.  \"It will be ze easiest way out  of ze situation for you.\"    \"Don't you pay a cent, Uncle Randolph,\" interrupted Dick quickly.  Then Baxter hit him again, such a stinging blow that he almost  lost consciousness.    \"For shame!\" ejaculated Mr. Rover.  \"He is tied up, otherwise you  would never have the courage to attack him.  Baxter, have you no  spirit of fairness at all in your composition?\"    \"Don't preach--I won't listen to it!\" fumed the bully.  \"You  have got to pay that money.  If you don't--well, I don't believe  you'll ever reach America alive, that's all.\"    With these words Dan Baxter withdrew, followed by Captain  Villaire.    \"You think za will pay?\" queried the French brigand anxiously.    \"To be sure they will pay.  They value their lives too much to  refuse.  Just wait until they have suffered the pangs of hunger  and thirst, and you'll see how they change their tune.\"    \"You are certain za have ze monish?\"    \"Yes; they are rich.  It will only be a question of waiting for  the money after they send for it.\"    \"I vill not mind zat.\"    \"Neither will I--if we are safe here.  You don't think anybody  will follow us?\"    \"Not unless za find ze way up from ze rivair.  Za cannot come here  by land, because of ze swamps,\" answered the Frenchman.  \"And ze  way from ze rivair shall be well guarded from now on,\" he added.          CHAPTER XIX    WHAT HAPPENED TO TOM AND SAM      Let us return to Tom and Sam, at the time they were left alone at  Binoto's hostelry.    \"I wish we had gone with Dick and Uncle Randolph,\" said Tom, as he  slipped into his coat and shoes.  \"I don't like this thing at  all.\"    \"Oh, don't get scared before you are hurt, Tom!\" laughed his  younger brother.  \"These people out here may be peculiar, but--\"    Sam did not finish.  A loud call from the woods had reached his  ears, and in alarm he too began to dress, at the same time  reaching for his pistol and the money belt which Randolph Rover  had left behind.    \"I--I guess something is wrong,\" he went on, after a pause.  \"If  we--\"    \"Tom!  Sam!  look out fo' yourselves!\" came from Aleck, and in a  second more the negro, burst on their view.  \"Come, if yo' is  dressed!\" he added.    \"Where to?\" asked Tom hurriedly.    \"Anywhar, Massah Tom.  De others is took prisoners!  Come!\"  And  Aleck almost dragged the boy along.    The Rover boys could readily surmise that Aleck would not act in  this highly excited manner unless there was good cause for it.  Consequently, as Sam said afterward, \"They didn't stand on the  order of their going, but just flew.\"  Pell-mell out of the  hostelry they tumbled, and ran up the highway as rapidly as their  nimble limbs would permit.    They heard several men coming after them, and heard the command  \"Halt!\" yelled after them in both French and bad English.  But  they did not halt until a sudden tumble on Tom's part made the  others pause in dismay.    \"Oh, great Caesar!\" groaned the fun-loving Rover, and tried to  stand up.  \"I guess I've twisted my ankle.\"    \"Can't you even walk?\" asked Sam.    \"We ain't got no time ter lose!\" panted Aleck, who was almost  winded.  \"If we stay here we'll be gobbled up--in no time, dat's  shuah!\"    \"Let us try to carry Tom,\" said Sam, and attempted to lift his  brother up.  But the load made him stagger.    \"De trees--let us dun hide in, de trees!\" went on the negro,  struck by a certain idea.  \"Come on, quick!\"    \"Yes--yes--anything!\" groaned Tom, and then shut his teeth hard  to keep himself from screaming with pain.    Together they carried the suffering youth away from the highway to  where there was a thick jungle of trees and tropical vines.  The  vines, made convenient ladders by which to get up into the trees,  and soon Sam and Aleck were up and pulling poor Tom after them.    \"Now we must be still,\" said Aleck, when they were safe for the  time being.  \"Hear dem a-conun' dis way.\"    The three listened and soon made out the footsteps of the  approaching party. They soon passed on up the road.    \"We've fooled them,\" whispered Sam.    \"But, oh, Aleck, what does it all mean?\"    \"It means dat yo' uncle an' Dick am prisoners--took by a lot of  rascals under a tall, Frenchman.\"    \"Yes, but I don't understand--\"    \"No more do I, Massah Sam, but it war best to git out, dat's as  shuah as yo' is born,\" added the colored man solemnly.    Poor Torn was having a wretched time of it with his ankle, which  hurt as badly as ever and had begun to swell.  As he steadied  himself on one of the limbs of the tree Sam removed his shoe,  which gave him a little relief.    From a distance came a shouting, and they made out through the  trees the gleam of a torch.  But soon the sounds died out and the  light disappeared.    What should they do next?  This was a question impossible to  answer.    \"One thing is certain, I can't walk just yet,\" said Tom.  \"When I  put my foot down it's like a thousand needles darting through my  leg.\"    \"Let us go below and hunt up some water,\" said Sam; and after  waiting a while longer they descended into the small brush.  Aleck  soon found a pool not far distant, and to this they carried Tom,  and after all had had a drink, the swollen ankle was bathed, much  to the sufferer's relief.    Slowly the time dragged by until morning.  As soon as the sun was  up Aleck announced that he was going back to the hostelry to see  how the land lay.    \"But don't expose yourself,\" said Tom.  \"I am certain now that is  a regular robbers' resort, or worse.\"    Aleck was gone the best part of three hours.  When he returned he  was accompanied by Cujo.  The latter announced that all of the  other natives had fled for parts unknown.    \"The inn is deserted,\" announced Aleck.  Even that colored wife of  the proprietor is gone.    \"And did you find any trace of Dick and my uncle?\" asked Sam.    \"We found out where dat struggle took place,\" answered, Aleck.  \"And Cujo reckons as how he can follow de trail if we don't wait  too long to do it.\"    \"Must go soon,\" put in Cujo for himself.    \"Maybe tomorrow come big storm--den track all washed away.\"    Tom sighed and shook his head.  \"You can go on, but you'll have to  leave me behind.  I couldn't walk a hundred yards for a barrel of  gold.\"    \"Oh, we can't think of leaving you behind!\" cried Sam.    \"I'll tell you wot--Ise dun carry him, at least fe a spell,\"  said Aleck, and so it was arranged.    Under the new order of things Cujo insisted on making a scouting  tour first, that he might strike the trail before carrying them  off on a circuitous route, thus tiring Aleck out before the real  tracking began.    The African departed, to be gone the best Part of an hour.  When  he came back there was a broad grin of satisfaction on his homely  features.    \"Cujo got a chicken,\" he announced, producing the fowl.  \"And here  am some werry good roots, too.  Now va dinner befo' we start out.\"    \"Right yo' am, Cujo!\" cried Pop, and began to start up a fire  without delay, while Cujo cleaned the fowl and mashed up the  roots, which, when baked on a hot stone, tasted very much like  sweet potatoes.  The meal was enjoyed by all, even Tom eating his  full share in spite of his swollen ankle, which was now gradually  resuming its normal condition.    Cujo had found the trail at a distance of an eighth of a mile  above the wayside hostelry.  \"Him don't lead to de ribber dare,\"  he said.  \"But I dun think somet'ing of him.\"    \"And what do you think?\" asked Tom, from his seat on Aleck's  back.    \"I t'ink he go to de kolobo.\"    \"And what is the kolobo?\" asked Sam with interest.    \"De kolobo old place on ribber-place where de white soldiers shoot  from big fort-house.\"    \"A fort!\" cried Tom.  \"But would the authorities allow, them to go  there?\"    \"No soldiers dare now--leave kolobo years ago.  Place most  tumble down now.  But good place fo' robbers.\"    \"I see.  Well, follow the"]]]
