The odours of many flowers, so delightful to our sense of smell, as well  as the disgreeable scents of others, are owing to the exhalation of their  essential oils. These essential oils have greater or less volatility, and  are all inflammable; many of them are poisons to us, as these of Laurel  and Tobacco; others possess a narcotic quality, as is evinced by the oil  of cloves instantly relieving slight tooth-achs; from oil of cinnamon  relieving the hiccup; and balsam of peru relieving the pain of some  ulcers. They are all deleterious to certain insects, and hence their use  in the vegetable economy being produced in flowers or leaves to protect  them from the depredations of their voracious enemies. One of the  essential oils, that of turpentine, is recommended, by M. de Thosse,  for the purpose of destroying insects which infect both vegetables and  animals. Having observed that the trees were attacked by multitudes of  small insects of different colours (pucins ou pucerons), which injured  their young branches, he destroyed them all intirely in the following  manner: he put into a bowl a few handfuls of earth, on which he poured a  small quantity of oil of turpentine; he then beat the whole together with  a spatula, pouring on it water till it became of the consistence of soup;  with this mixture he moistened the ends of the branches, and both the  insects and their eggs were destroyed, and other insects kept aloof by  the scent of the turpentine. He adds, that he destroyed the fleas of  his puppies by once bathing them in warm water impregnated with oil of  turpentine. Mem. d'Agriculture, An. 1787, Trimest. Printemp. p. 109. I  sprinkled some oil of turpentine, by means of a brush, on some branches  of a nectarine-tree, which was covered with the aphis; but it killed both  the insect and the branches: a solution of arsenic much diluted did  the same.

With the milky juice of this tree the  Indians poison their arrows; the dew-drops, which fall from it, are so  caustic as to blister the skin, and produce dangerous ulcers; whence many  have found their death by sleeping under its shade. Variety of noxious  plants abound in all countries; in our own the deadly nightshade,  henbane, hounds-tongue, and many others, are seen in almost every high  road untouched by animals. Some have asked, what is the use of such  abundance of poisons? The nauseous or pungent juices of some vegetables,  like the thorns of others, are given them for their defence from the  depredations of animals; hence the thorny plants are in general wholesome  and agreeable food to graminivorous animals. See note on Ilex. The  flowers or petals of plants are perhaps in general more acrid than their  leaves; hence they are much seldomer eaten by insects. This seems to have  been the use of the essential oil in the vegetable economy, as observed  above in the notes on Dictamnus and on Ilex. The fragrance of plants  is thus a part of their defence. These pungent or nauseous juices of  vegetables have supplied the science of medicine with its principal  materials, such as purge, vomit, intoxicate, &c.]    [_Urtica_. I. 191. Nettle.

Is the fluid contained in this  bag, and pressed through the perforation into the wound, made by the  point, a caustic essential oil, or a concentrated vegetable acid?  The vegetable poisons, like the animal ones, produce more sudden and  dangerous effects, when instilled into a wound, than when taken into  the stomach; whence the families of Marfi and Psilli, in antient Rome,  sucked the poison without injury out of wounds made by vipers,  and were supposed to be indued with supernatural powers for this  purpose. By the experiments related by Beccaria, it appears that four  or five times the quantity, taken by the mouth, had about equal effects  with that infused into a wound.

The exhalations from ripe fruit, or withering leaves,  are proved much to injure the air in which they are confined; and, it is  probable, all those vegetables which emit a strong scent may do this in  a greater or less degree, from the Rose to the Lobelia; whence the  unwholesomeness in living perpetually in such an atmosphere of perfume  as some people wear about their hair, or carry in their handkerchiefs.

The attempted  raid had nevertheless an important outcome, for by this exhibition of  strength Mahomet succeeded in convincing a neighboring desert tribe,  hitherto friendly to Mecca, of the advisability of seeking alliance with  the Muslim.    The treaty between Mahomet and the Bedouin tribe marks the beginning of a  significant development in his foreign polity. Like the Romans, and all  military nations, he knew the worth of making advantageous alliances,  while he was clear-sighted enough to realise that the struggle with Mecca  was inevitable. During the months preceding the battle of Bedr he  concluded several treaties with desert tribes, and it is to this policy  he owes in part his power to maintain his aggressive attitude towards the  Kureisch, for with the alliance of the tribes around the caravan routes  Mahomet could be sure of hampering the Meccan trade.    While the Prophet was in the field he left representatives to care for  the affairs of his city. These representatives were designated by him,  and were always members of his personal following. Ali and Abu Bekr were  most often chosen until All proved his worth as a warrior, and so usually  accompanied or commanded the expeditionary force. The representatives  held their authority direct from Mahomet, and had in all matters the  identical power of the Prophet during his absence. It speaks well for the  loyalty and acumen of these ministers that Mahomet was enabled to leave  the city so often and so confidently, and that the government continued  as if under his personal supervision.    Whether the Jews were overbold because of Mahomet's frequent absences, or  whether they now became conscious of the trend of Mahomet's policy  towards the absorption of the Jewish element within the city into Islam,  will never be made clear, beyond the fact that the Jewish tribes were not  enthusiastic in their union with the Muslim, and that their national  character precluded them from accepting an alliance that threatened the  autonomy of their religion. It is, however, certain that the discontent  of the Jews voiced itself more and more loudly as the year advanced. The  suras of the period are full of revilings and threats against them, and  form a greater contrast coming after the later Meccan suras wherein  Israel was honoured and its heroes held up as examples. A few Jews had  been won over to his cause, but the mass showed themselves either hostile  or indifferent to the federal idea. As yet no definite sundering  of relationships had occurred, but everything pointed to a speedy  dissolution of the treaty unless one side or the other moderated its  views.    The autumn of 628 saw Mahomet fully established in Medina. He had made  his worth known by his energy and organising power, by his devotion to  Allah and his zeal for the faith he had founded. The Medinans regarded  him already as their natural leader, and he had definitely adopted their  city as his headquarters. Through his skill as a statesman and his  loyalty to an idea he wrought out, the foundations of his future state,  and if the latter months of 623 saw him not yet strong enough to overcome  the Meccans, at least he was so firmly established that he could afford  to dispense with any overtures to the increasingly hostile Jews, and he  had gained sufficient adherents to allow him to contemplate with  equanimity the prospect of a sharp and prolonged struggle with the  Kureisch.          CHAPTER X      THE SECESSION OF THE JEWS    _\"Even though thou shouldst bring every kind of sign to those who have  received the Scriptures, yet Thy Kibla they will not adopt; nor shalt  thou adopt their Kibla; nor will one part of them adopt the Kibla of the  other.\"--The Kuran_.    Mahomet realised the position of affairs at Medina too acutely to allow  of his undertaking in person any predatory expeditions against the  Kureisch during the autumn and winter of 623. The Jews were chafing under  his tacit assumption of State control, and although their murmurings had  not reached the recklessness of strife, still both their leaders and the  Muslim perceived that their disaffection was inevitable. Insecurity at  home, however, did not prevent him from sending out an expedition in  Rajab (October) of that year under Abdallah. Rajab is a sacred month in  the Mohamedan calendar, one in which war is forbidden. Strictly,  therefore, in sending out an expedition at all just then Mahomet was  transgressing against the laws of that religion which, purged of its  idolatries, he claimed as his own. But it was a favourable opportunity to  attack the Kureischite caravan on its way to Taif, and therefore Mahomet  recked nothing of the prohibition.    Taif was a very distant objective for an expeditionary band from Medina,  and that Mahomet contemplated attack upon his enemy by a company so far  removed from its base is convincing proof, should any be needed, of his  confidence in his followers' prowess and his conciliation of the tribes  lying between the two hostile cities.    Sealed orders were given to Abdallah, with instructions not to open the  parchment until he was two days south of Medina. At sunset on the second  day he came with his eight followers to a well in the midst of the  desert. There under the few date palms, which gave them rough shelter, he  broke the seal and read:    \"When thou readest this writing depart unto Nakhla, between Taif and  Mecca; there lie in wait for the Kureisch, and bring thy comrades news  concerning them.\"    As Abdallah read his mind alternated between apprehension and daring, and  turning to his companions he took counsel of them.    \"Mahomet has commanded me to go to Nakhla and there await the Kureisch;  also he has commanded me to say unto you whoever desireth martyrdom for  Islam let him follow me, and whoever will not suffer it, let him turn  back. As for me, I am resolved to carry out the commands of God's  Prophet\"    Then one and all the eight companions assured him they would not forsake  him until the quest was achieved. At dawn they resumed their march and  arrived at length at Nakhla, where they encountered the Kureisch caravan  laden with spice and leather. Now, it was the last day of the month of  Rajab, wherein it was unlawful to fight, wherefore the Muslim took  counsel, saying:    \"If we fight not this day, they will elude us and escape.\"    But the Prophet's implied command was strong enough to induce initiative  and hardihood in the small attacking party. They bore down upon the  Kureisch, showering arrows in their path, so that one man was killed and  several wounded. The rest forsook their merchandise and fled, leaving  behind them two prisoners, whose retreat had been cut off. Abdallah was  left in possession of the field, and joyfully he returned to Medina,  bearing with him the first plunder captured by the Muslim.    But his return led Mahomet into a quandary from which there seemed  no escape. Politically, he was bound to approve Abdallah's deed;  religiously, he could neither laud it nor share the fruits of it. For  days the spoils remained undivided, but Abdallah was not punished or even  reprimanded. Meanwhile, the Jews and the Kureisch vied with one another  in execrating Mahomet, and even his own people murmured against him. It  was clearly time that an authoritative sanction should be given to the  deed, and accordingly in the sura, \"The Cow,\" we have the revelation from  Allah proclaiming the greater culpability of the Infidels and of those  who would stir up civil strife:    \"They will ask thee concerning war in the Sacred Month. Say: To war  therein is bad, but to turn aside from the cause of God, and to have no  faith in Him, and in the Sacred Temple, and to drive out its people, is  worse in the sight of God; civil strife is worse than bloodshed.\"    No possible doubt must be cast in this and similar cases upon Mahomet's  sincerity. The Kuran was the vehicle of the Lord; he had used it to  proclaim his unity and power and his warnings to the unrighteous. Now  that Islam had recognised his august and indissoluble majesty, and had  accorded the throne of Heaven and the governance of earth to him  indivisibly, the world was split up into Believers and Unbelievers. The  Kuran, therefore, must of necessity cease to be merely the proclamation  of divine unity that it had been and become the vehicle for definite  orders and regulations, the outcome of those theocratic ideas upon which  Mahomet's creed was founded. The justification would not appeal to the  people unless Allah's sanction supported it, and Mahomet realised with  all his ardour of faith that the transgression was slight compared with  the result achieved towards the progress of Islam. The Prophet therefore  received, with Allah's approval, a fifth of the spoil, but the captives  he released after receiving ransom.    \"This,\" says the historian, \"was the first booty that Mahomet obtained,  the first captives they seized, and the first life they took.\" The  significance of the event was vividly felt throughout Islam, and  Abdallah, its hero, received at Mahomet's hands the title of \"Amir-al-  Momirim,\" Commander of the Faithful--a title which recalls inseparably  the cruelty and magnificence, the glamour and rapacity, of Arabian Bagdad  under Haroun-al-Raschid. The valorous enterprise had now been achieved,  the Kureisch caravan was despoiled, and the Kureisch themselves wrought  into fury against the Prophet's insolence; but more than all, the channel  of Mahomet's policy of warfare became thereby so deeply carved that he  could not have effaced "]]]
