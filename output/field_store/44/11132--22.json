He taps a keg o' rum or beer ter keep  his throat in workin' order. I don't mind that at all, but him an' his  mates git flood-bound for near a week, an' broach more kegs, an' go on  a howlin' spree in ther mud, an' spill mor'n they swipe, an' leave a  tarpaulin off a load, an' the flour gets wet, an' the sugar runs out of  the bags like syrup, an'-- What's a feller ter do? Do yer expect me to  set the law onter Jimmy? I've knowed him all my life, an' he knowed my  father afore I was born. He's been on the roads this forty year, till  he's as thin as a rat, and as poor as a myall black; an' he's got a  family ter keep back there in Bourke. No, I have ter pay for it in the  end, an' it all mounts up, I can tell yer.    An' suppose some poor devil of a new-chum black sheep comes along,  staggerin' from one side of the track to the other, and spoutin' poetry;  dyin' o' heat or fever, or heartbreak an' home-sickness, or a life o'  disserpation he'd led in England, an' without a sprat on him, an' no  claim on the bush; an' I ketches: him in me arms as he stumbles inter  the bar, an' he wants me ter hold him up while he turns English inter  Greek for me. An' I put him ter bed, an' he gits worse, an' I have ter  send the buggy twenty mile for a doctor--an' pay him. An' the jackaroo  gits worse, an' has ter be watched an' nursed an' held down sometimes;  an' he raves about his home an' mother in England, an' the blarsted  University that he was eddicated at--an' a woman--an' somethin' that  sounds like poetry in French; an' he upsets my missus a lot, an' makes  her blubber. An' he dies, an' I have ter pay a man ter bury him (an'  knock up a sort o' fence round the grave arterwards ter keep the stock  out), an' send the buggy agen for a parson, an'--Well, what's a man ter  do? I couldn't let him wander away an' die like a dog in the scrub, an'  be shoved underground like a dog, too, if his body was ever found. The  Government might pay ter bury him, but there ain't never been a  pauper funeral from my house yet, an' there won't be one if I can help  it--except it be meself.    An' then there's the bother goin' through his papers to try an' find out  who he was an' where his friends is. An' I have ter get the missus to  write a letter to his people, an' we have ter make up lies about how  he died ter make it easier for 'em. An' goin' through his letters, the  missus comes across a portrait an' a locket of hair, an' letters from  his mother an' sisters an' girl; an' they upset her, an' she blubbers  agin, an' gits sentimental--like she useter long ago when we was first  married.    There was one bit of poetry--I forgit it now--that that there jackaroo  kep' sayin' over an' over agen till it buzzed in me head; an', weeks  after, I'd ketch the missus mutterin' it to herself in the kitchen till  I thought she was goin' ratty.    An' we gets a letter from the jackaroo's friends that puts us to a lot  more bother. I hate havin' anythin' to do with letters. An' someone's  sure to say he was lambed down an' cleaned out an' poisoned with bad  bush liquor at my place. It's almost enough ter make a man wish there  _was_ a recorin' angel.    An' what's the end of it? I got the blazin' bailiff in the place now!  I can't shot him out because he's a decent, hard-up, poor devil from  Bourke, with consumption or somethin', an' he's been talkin' to the  missus about his missus an' kids; an' I see no chance of gittin' rid  of him, unless the shearers come along with their cheques from  West-o'-Sunday nex' week and act straight by me. Like as not I'll have  ter roll up me swag an' take the track meself in the end. They say  publicans are damned, an' I think so, too; an' I wish I'd bin operated  on before ever I seen a pub.          THE SHEARER'S DREAM      Mitchell and I rolled up our swags after New Year and started to tramp  west. It had been a very bad season after a long drought. Old Baldy  Thompson had only shorn a few bales of grass-seed and burrs, so he said,  and thought of taking the track himself; but we hoped to get on shearing  stragglers at West-o'-Sunday or one of the stations of the Hungerford  track.    It was very hot weather, so we started after sunset, intending to travel  all night. We crossed the big billabong, and were ploughing through the  dust and sand towards West Bourke, when a buggy full of city girls and  swells passed by. They were part of a theatrical company on tour in the  Back-Blocks, and some local Johnnies. They'd been driven out to see  an artesian bore, or wool-shed, or something. The horses swerved, and  jerked a little squawk out of one of the girls. Then another said:    \"Ow-w! Two old swaggies. He! he! he!\"    I glanced at Mitchell to see if he was hit, and caught his head down;  but he pulled himself up and pretended to hitch his swag into an easier  position.    About a hundred yards further on he gave me a side look and said:    \"Did that touch you, Harry\"    \"No,\" I said, and I laughed.    \"You see,\" reflected Mitchell, \"they're more to be pitied than blamed.  It's their ignorance. In the first place, we're not two old tramps, as  they think. We are professional shearers; and the Australian shearers  are about the most independent and intelligent class of men in the  world. We've got more genius in one of our little fingers than there is  in the whole of that wagonette-load of diddle-daddle and fiddle-faddle  and giggles. Their intellects are on a level with the rotten dramas  they travel with, and their lives about as false. They are slaves to  the public, and their home is the pub-parlour, with sickly, senseless  Johnnies to shout suppers and drink for them and lend their men money.  If one of those girls is above the average, how she must despise those  Johnnies--and the life! She must feel a greater contempt for them than  the private-barmaid does for the boozer she cleans out. He gets his  drink and some enjoyment, anyhow. And how she must loathe the life she  leads! And what's the end of it as often as not? I remember once, when  I was a boy, I was walking out with two aunts of mine--they're both  dead now. God rest their fussy, innocent old souls!--and one of 'em  said suddenly, 'Look! Quick, Jack! There's Maggie So-and-So, the great  actress.' And I looked and saw a woman training vines in a porch. It  seemed like seeing an angel to me, and I never forgot her as she was  then. The diggers used to go miles out of town to meet the coach that  brought her, and take the horses out and drag it in, and throw gold in  her lap, and worship her.    \"The last time I was in Sydney I saw her sitting in the back parlour  of a third-rate pub. She was dying of dropsy and couldn't move from  her chair. She showed me a portrait of herself as I remembered her, and  talked quite seriously about going on the stage again.    \"Now, our home is about two thousand miles wide, and the world's our  stage. If the worst comes to the worst we can always get tucker and wood  and water for nothing. If we're camping at a job in a tent there's no  house-cleaning to bother us. All we've got to do when the camp gets too  dirty is to shift the tent to a fresh place. We've got time to think  and--we're free.    \"But then, agen,\" he reflected, \"there's the world's point of view to  be considered. Some day I might be flashing past in a buggy or  saloon-carriage--or, the chances are it will be you--and you might look  out the window and see an old swaggy tramping along in the dust, or  camped under a strip of calico in the rain in the scrub. (And it might  be me--old Mitchell--that really wrote your books, only the world won't  know it.) And then you'll realize what a wretched, miserable life  it was. We never realize the miseries of life till we look back--the  mistakes and miseries that had to be and couldn't be helped. It's all  luck--luck and chance.\"    But those girls seemed to have gravelled Mitchell, and he didn't seem  able to talk himself round. He tramped on, brooding for a while, and  then suddenly he said:    \"Look here, Harry! Those girls are giving a dance to-night, and if I  liked to go back to Bourke and tog up and go to the dance I could pick  out the prettiest, dance with her all the evening, and take her for  a stroll afterwards, old tramp as they thought me. I've lived--but it  wouldn't be worth my while now.\"    I'd seen Jack in a mood like this before, and thought it best to say  nothing. Perhaps the terrible heat had affected him a little. We walked  on in silence until we came to the next billabong. \"Best boil the  billy here, Harry,\" said Mitchell, \"and have some tea before we go any  further.\"    I got some sticks together and made a fire and put the billy on. The  country looked wretched--like the ghost of a burnt-out land--in the  moonlight. The banks of the creek were like ashes, the thin, gnarled  gum-bush seemed dry-rotting fast, and in many places the surface of the  ground was cracked in squares where it had shrunk in the drought. In the  bed of the creek was a narrow gutter of water that looked like bad milk.    Mitchell sat on his swag, with his pint of tea on the ground by his  foot, and chewed his pipe.    \"What's up, Jack?\" I asked. \"Have you got the blues?\"    \"Well, yes, Harry,\" he said. \"I'm generally dull the first day on  the track. The first day is generally the worst, anywhere or  anytime--except, perhaps, when you're married.... I got--well, I got  thinking of the time when a woman's word could have hurt me.\"    Just then one of the \"travellers\" who were camped a bit up the creek  suddenly commenced to sing. It was a song called \"The Shearer's Dream,\"  and I suppose the buggy of girls, or the conversation they started,  reminded him of it. He started his verses and most of his lines with  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7070"],[0,"The Treasure of the Incas: A Story of Adventure in Peru (#17)"],[1,"abound.\"    \"That is not altogether satisfactory, though I should not mind if we  fell in with one occasionally. But how about game, Dias?\"    \"The chief game are the wild vicunas, which are very numerous in some  parts; but they are very shy and difficult to hunt. Deer are plentiful,  and there are foxes, bears, and hogs; but the great article of food is  fish. On the plains the manatee, which is very like the seal, is  caught; turtles are found in great numbers, and the people make oil  from their eggs; and the buffo, a sort of porpoise, also abounds. The  natives do not eat these, except when very pressed for food; they catch  them for the sake of their oil. There are many kinds of fish: the  sunaro, which I heard an English traveller say are like the fish the  English call the pike; these grow to the length of seven or eight feet.  And many smaller kinds of fish are caught by throwing the juice of the  root of the barbasto into small streams. This makes the fish stupid,  and they float on the surface so that they may easily be caught by  hand. There are also many sorts of fruit.\"    \"Well, then, we ought to do fairly well, Dias.\"    \"Yes, senor; but many of these creatures are only found in the forests  and in the rivers of the plains, and they are so much hunted by the  savages there that they are very shy. But there are some creatures with  which we certainly do not wish to meet, and unfortunately these are not  uncommon. I mean the alligators and the great serpents. The natives  fear the alligators much, for their weapons are of no avail against  them, and they would never venture to attack a great snake.\"    \"And besides these, what other disagreeables are there, Dias?\" Bertie  asked cheerfully.    \"There is one other disagreeable,\" Dias replied, \"and it is a serious  one. There are in the mountains many desperate men. Some have slain an  enemy who had friends influential enough to set the law in motion  against them, or have escaped from prison; some have resisted the  tax-collectors; many have been suspected of plotting against the  government; and others are too lazy to work.\"    \"And how do they live?\" Harry asked.    \"They live partly on game and partly on plunder. They steal from  cultivators; they are paid a small sum by all muleteers passing through  the mountains; they rob travellers who are worth robbing; and sometimes  they carry off a proprietor of land, and get a ransom for him.  Occasionally they will wash the sand, and get gold enough to send one  of their number into a town to buy articles they require.\"    \"And do they go in large bands?\"    \"No, senor; as a rule some ten or twelve keep together under the one  they have chosen as their chief. Sometimes, if people make complaints  and troops are sent against them, they will join to resist them; but  this is not often. The authorities know well enough that they have no  chance of catching these men among the mountains they are so well  acquainted with, and content themselves with stationing a few troops in  the villages.\"    \"And is it through the robbers or the savages that so few of the gold  explorers ever return?\"    \"It is chiefly, I think, from hardship,\" Dias said; \"but undoubtedly  many who venture down near the Indians' country are killed by them.  Some who have done well, and are returning with the gold they have  accumulated, fall victims to these robbers. You must not, of course,  suppose that there are great numbers of them, senor. There may be some  hundreds, but from Huancabamba--the northern frontier of the western  Cordilleras, where the Maranon crosses the eastern range--down to Lake  Titicaca on the one side, and Tacna on the other, is nigh a thousand  miles, and the two ranges cover more square leagues than can be  reckoned, and even a thousand men scattered over these would be but so  many grains of sand on a stretch of the sea-shore.\"    \"It certainly sounds like it, Dias; but perhaps those worthy people  congregate chiefly in the neighbourhood of the passes.\"    \"That is so, senor; but even through these a traveller might pass many  times without being troubled by them.\"    \"Have you fallen in with them often, Dias?\"    \"Yes; but, as you see, they have done me no harm. Sometimes, when I get  to the end of my journey, the mules are not so heavily laden as when I  started; but generally the people for whom I work say to me, 'Here are  so many dollars, Dias; they are for toll.' There are places in the  villages at the foot of the most-frequented passes where it is  understood that a payment of so many dollars per mule will enable you  to pass without molestation. In return for your money, you receive a  ribbon, or a rosette, or a feather, and this you place in your hat as a  passport. You may meet a few men with guns as you pass along, but when  they see the sign they salute you civilly, ask for a drink of wine if  you are carrying it, then wish you good-day. It is only in  little-frequented passes that you have to take your chance. I may say  that though these men may plunder, they never kill a muleteer. They  know that if they did, all traffic on that road would cease, and the  soldiers would find guides who knew every path and hiding-place in the  mountains.\"    \"Anyhow, I think it is well, Dias, that I took your advice, and handed  over my gold to Senor Pasquez, for if we do fall into the hands of any  of these gentry, we can lose practically nothing.\"    \"No money, senor, but we might lose everything else, except perhaps the  mules, which they could not use in the mountains. But if they were to  take our blankets, and tents, and provisions, and your firearms, we  should be in a bad way if we happened to be a couple of hundred miles  in the heart of the mountains.\"    \"Well, I don't think they will take them,\" Harry said grimly, \"without  paying pretty dearly for them. With your gun and our rifles, and that  old fowling-piece which you got for Jose, which will throw a fairly  heavy charge of buck-shot, I think we can make a very good fight  against any band of eight men, or even one or two more.\"    \"I think so,\" Dias said gravely. \"It is seldom I miss my mark. Still, I  hope we shall not be troubled with them, or with the Indians. You see,  it is not so much an attack by day that we have to fear, as a surprise  at night. Of course, when we are once on the hills, Jose and I will  keep watch by turns. He is as sharp as a needle. I should have no fear  of any of these robbers creeping up to us without his hearing them. But  I can't say so much for him in the case of the Indians, who can move so  noiselessly that even a vicuna would not hear them until they were  within a spear's-throw.\"    \"The spear is their weapon then, Dias?\"    \"Some tribes carry bows and arrows, others only spears, and sometimes  they poison the points of both these weapons.\"    \"That is unpleasant. Are there remedies for the poisons?\"    \"None that I know of, nor do I think the savages themselves know of  any. The only chance is to pour ammonia at once into the hole that is  made by an arrow, and to cut out all the flesh round a spear-wound, and  then to pour in ammonia or sear it with a hot iron.\"    \"That accounts for your buying that large bottle of ammonia at Lima. I  wondered what you wanted it for. When we get into the country these  unpleasant people inhabit, I will fill my spirit-flask with it, so that  it will always be handy if required. Now we understand things  generally, Dias. It only remains for you to decide where we had best  leave the plain and take to the mountains.\"    Dias was silent for a minute. \"I should say, senor, that first we had  better journey down to Cuzco and then down to Sicuani, where the  western Cordilleras, after making a bend, join the eastern branch, and  there cross the Tinta volcano. On the other side are many gorges. In  one of these I know there is some very rich gold sand. Explorers have  sought for this spot in vain, but the secret has been well kept by the  few who know it. It has been handed down in my father's family from  father to son ever since the Spaniards came. He told it to me, and I  swore to reveal it to none but my son. I have no son, and the secret  therefore will die with me. Whether it has been passed down in any  other family I cannot say. It may be, or it may not be; but as I owe  you my life, and also the debt of gratitude to Senor Barnett, I feel  that you are more to me than a son. Moreover, the secret was to be kept  lest it should come to the knowledge of the Spaniards. The Spaniards  have gone, and with them the reason for concealment, so I feel now that  I am justified in taking you there.\"    \"I am glad of that, Dias. Assuredly the gold can be of service to no  man as long as it lies there, and it would be better to utilize it than  allow it to waste. I need not say how grateful I shall feel if you can  put me in the way of obtaining it.\"    \"That I cannot absolutely promise,\" he said. \"I have the indications,  but they will be difficult to find. Three hundred years bring great  changes--rocks on which there are marks may be carried away by  torrents, figures cut in the cliffs may be overgrown by mosses or  creepers. However, if but a few remain, I hope to be able to find my  way. If I fail we must try elsewhere; but this is the only one of which  I have been told all the marks. I know generally several places where  great treasure was hidden, but not the marks by which they could be  discovered, and as we may be sure that every measure was taken to hide  the entrances to the caves, the chances would be all against our  lighting upon them. I may say, senor, that, great as was the treasure  of the Incas, that of the Chimoos or Chincas, a powerful people who  inhabited part of this country, was fully as large; and traditions say  that most of the treasures hidden were not those of the Incas, but of  the Chimoos, who buried them when their country was invaded by the  Incas."]]]
