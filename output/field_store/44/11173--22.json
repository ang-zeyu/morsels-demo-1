He thought to frighten them by the report  of firearms, but it seemed to have the opposite effect, for many men  at once gathered around the caravan, and for the time prevented its  onward course. As usual, they wanted me not only to pay for travelling  in their country, but to liquidate their claim on the Abban, as I had  brought him there, and only out of consideration for the respect they  felt towards me, they permitted his passage in safety.    They might as well have tried to skin a flint as obtain anything from  me, and I told them so, for Sumunter had fleeced me of all my effects.  This parley concluded, we travelled on without any further  molestation, and, crossing over the foot of some low spurs, arrived at  noon in a broad watercourse on the maritime plain to eat some  breakfast.    Here I shot and stuffed a very interesting rat, with a bushy tail,  very much resembling the little gill√©ri squirrel of the Indian plains,  but plumper in face and body, like a recently born rabbit. I had seen  many of them in rocks about the hill's side, but until now had not  secured a good specimen.[22] Again at this place I saw those large  black canine animals with white-tipped tail, but could not get a shot:  there were three hunting together, like jungle dogs in India. After  refreshing ourselves we resumed the march, and travelled along the  sandy shore eastward to a halting-place called Farjeh, completing a  march of twelve miles.    29th.--This day we completed our journey by marching into Gori, when I  again took occupation of the old fort. An answer from the Government  at Aden to my appeal against the sultan and Abban had now arrived, and  affected Sumunter severely. He was ready to sink into the earth, and  said to me, \"Oh, why did you not whip me when I was in fault? I could  have borne that well, but writing to the English at Aden is more than  I can bear. What will be the consequences now if I return to Aden?\" I  said I could not answer for it, as it was now beyond my control, and  if he went over there he must take his chance; but I strongly advised  his not going at all. \"Indeed,\" I said, \"I wish you would depart from  me at once. From the first, I told you I was obliged, by order, to  write accurate accounts of everything as it happened, and the English,  as you have often said yourself, are remarkable for not telling lies.\"  The sultan, into whose hands the letter first went, would not show  himself, but remained in the distant jungles, although I sent  repeatedly for him to converse concerning Sumunter.    The buggalow in which I came from Aden was now anchored in Bunder  Gori. It had made a voyage somewhere in the meanwhile, but the captain  had been afraid to go to Aden in consequence of the salt question, in  which Sumunter had made him confederate, fearing lest I might have  since written to the authorities there about it. However, I now wanted  to hire it again, and made sundry overtures to the captain, who at  first showed a disposition to treat, hoping thereby I should forgive  him; but he was finally hindered from doing so by the insidious  machinations of Sumunter, who doubtless was afraid by this means of  collecting at Aden more witnesses against himself. Sumunter now saw  his position clearly, and must have felt equally with myself it was a  great pity the letter of reproof from the Brigadier of Aden[23] did  not arrive sooner, and keep him on a course of rectitude, for he was  obliged to return to Aden and take his chance, as there he had not  only a wife and family, but it was the headquarters of all his  mercantile transactions. During this time, whilst I was in the old  fort, an odd accident occurred to an Akil's wife. She was playing with  my interpreter, who, for a frolic, snatched up one of my six-barrelled  revolver pistols and gave her chase. Suddenly she darted into the room  I was sitting in, bounced on a bench and poked her tail in my man's  face. He, not knowing the pistol was loaded, pulled at the trigger,  and discharged the contents of two barrels at once into her fleshy  projection. In an instant their fun came to an end, and great  consternation ensued. She thought she must die from it, and bolted off  home to give up the ghost. Her husband now came and clamoured for  revenge--her value was so-and-so, and my man must pay it. The  interpreter, hearing this, came crying to me, and wished to know if I  thought she would die; for should she do so, he, by the laws of the  land, would have to pay her price. I said I could not tell without  seeing her wounds, but, under any circumstances, the bullets ought to  be extracted. This appeared to them still more alarming than ever.  They did not wish me to inspect the wounds, and the woman herself was  very bashful. However, the Sahib was the only surgeon present, and  votes gave me the practice. It was certainly very amusing to witness  the struggle between virtue and necessity, and the operation was so  far satisfactory that I succeeded in extracting one of the balls. The  other ball, however, was so deeply imbedded I could not find a probe  that would reach it. Fortunately it was not fired in a dangerous  direction, and the ball being small, I thought it would not occasion  her any serious inconvenience. In short, I set their minds easy on  that score, though it did not keep their tongues quiet from  importunate begging. I was now dreadfully impatient to get away, but  day by day I had to suffer disappointment. I was assured by Sumunter  he was doing everything in his power to facilitate it, and as often  told by the interpreter, when he had gone away, that he was doing  nothing of the sort, but, on the contrary, had sent to the interior to  get three ponies, which would make five with what he had, the  complement required by Lieutenant Burton, to make a present to him on  arrival, as a bribe to overlook his faults. I besought he would desist  from this hopeless speculation, as time was now more precious than any  other matter. Still he persisted, and in a fortnight's time the  animals arrived, and then, without further trouble, we chartered a  vessel for thirty-five dollars, twelve times the fare I paid for  coming over, with the whole vessel to myself; and embarked with eight  camels and five ponies on the 15th February 1855. After five days'  sailing we anchored in Aden harbour, and no sooner did the \"let go the  anchor\" sound, than, Somali fashion, overjoyed at my release from  three and a half months' persecution, I took a header into the sea,  and hastily swam ashore to hurry off and meet old friends.    After the first greetings were over, and I had delivered for report  all my sketch-notes[24] of the journey, as well as maps and  collections, which latter were sent to the public museum in Calcutta,  a discussion took place as to the disposal of the Abban, who, I now  found out, was not singular in the way of treating his clients, for  Herne had been writing over complaints constantly about his man. I was  averse to punishing him, from the simple fact of having brought him  over; but my commandant thought otherwise, and that he had better be  punished, if for no other reason than to set a good moral example to  the others.[25]    Against my inclination I was appointed to be Sumunter's prosecutor,  and with my servants as witnesses, a verdict of guilty was speedily  effected against him in the Aden Police Court. He was then sentenced  to two months' imprisonment, and to pay the sum of 200 rupees, or,  failing to do that within the given time, he would be further  subjected to imprisonment, with hard labour, for six months more, and  was to be banished with his family for ever after the present  punishment should cease.    I now advised Lieutenant Burton, after my late defeat in travelling,  that it would be highly essential to the success of the great  expedition that we should be escorted by some Somali picked from the  Aden police force, as by this means alone should we have men on whom  we could depend. He also was aware of this fact, from having been  successfully taken himself into Harar by one of that corps; but,  unfortunately for us, there were none to spare.    Though the Somali are rare blackguards in most respects, there are  some traits in their character which have always won me to them. They  love freedom and liberty, and enjoy a jolly row, added to which they  are always in good spirits. In my humble opinion, they would make  first-rate guerilla soldiers for Aden, if armed and trained to shoot  with good rifles, and not restrained to wearing any particular  clothes, or confined to steady-marching drills. They have a national  antipathy to the Arabs, their elder brothers, and would glory in  having scrimmages with them.    This was the climax of my first proceedings with Africa.    Stroyan and Herne were now both employed at Berbera or in its  vicinity. The former had been making slight excursions inland,  shooting, and had killed three elephants; whilst the latter was  purchasing baggage-cattle for the expedition transport. After enjoying  a short repose in civilised life, I again felt restless, and proposed  a move to proceed thither in order to assist Herne in completing the  desired complement of animals. This at once met the views of our  commandant, who, doubting whether Berbera could supply a sufficient  number of beasts of burden of itself, asked me to cross over the Gulf  and see what I could do at Kurrum, to keep in communication with  Herne, and as soon as I had got enough, to march with them along the  sea-shore to Berbera.    Nothing could have suited me better. I saw before me, by this measure,  active employment until the breaking-up of the Berbera fair.    A kind friend (Lieutenant Dansey of the Bombay army, late Assistant  Political Agent of Aden, who knew the characters of all the Somali  well) offered to procure me a man as guide and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8419"],[0,"The Journals of Lewis and Clark, 1804-1806 (#17)"],[1,"of  which overflows, the part that dose not overflow, is rich and well  timbered, Some Small open Praries near the hills, the Boat passed the  lower part of a large Island Situated on the S.

[Lewis, July 15, 1804]  Sunday July 15th  This evening I discovered that my Chronometer had stoped, nor can I  assign any cause for this accedent; she had been wound up the preceding  noon as usual. This is the third instance in which this instrument has  stopt in a similar manner since she nas been in my possession, tho the  first only since our departure from the River Dubois. in the two  preceding cases when she was again set in motion, and her rate of going  determined by a series of equal altitudes of the sun taken for that  purpose, it was found to be the same precisely as that mentioned in the  preliminary remarks to these observations, or 15 s & 5 tenths too slow  in 24 h-as her rate of going after stoping, and begin again set in  motion has in two instances proved to be the same, I have concluded,  that whatever this impediment may procede from, it is not caused by any  material injury which her works have sustained, and that when she is in  motion, her error on mean time above stated, may be depended on as  accurate. In consequence of the chronometer's having thus accedentally  stoped, I determined to come too at the first convenient place and make  such observations as were necessary to ascertain her error, establish  the Latitude & Longitude, and determine the variation of the nedle, in  order to fix a second point of departure.
