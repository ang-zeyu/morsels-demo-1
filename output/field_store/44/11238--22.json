Right.\"    \"--and look about you till you find a nice, heavy stone. Or a fairly  large brick would do.\"    \"I see,\" I said, though I didn't, being still fogged. \"Stone or brick.  Yes. And then?\"    \"Then,\" said the relative, \"I want you, like a good boy, to fasten the  rope to the brick and tie it around your damned neck and jump into the  pond and drown yourself. In a few days I will send and have you fished up  and buried because I shall need to dance on your grave.\"    I was more fogged than ever. And not only fogged--wounded and resentful.  I remember reading a book where a girl \"suddenly fled from the room,  afraid to stay for fear dreadful things would come tumbling from her  lips; determined that she would not remain another day in this house to  be insulted and misunderstood.\" I felt much about the same.    Then I reminded myself that one has got to make allowances for a woman  with only about half a spoonful of soup inside her, and I checked the  red-hot crack that rose to the lips.    \"What,\" I said gently, \"is this all about? You seem pipped with Bertram.\"    \"Pipped!\"    \"Noticeably pipped. Why this ill-concealed animus?\"    A sudden flame shot from her eyes, singeing my hair.    \"Who was the ass, who was the chump, who was the dithering idiot who  talked me, against my better judgment, into going without my dinner? I  might have guessed----\"    I saw that I had divined correctly the cause of her strange mood.    \"It's all right. Aunt Dahlia. I know just how you're feeling. A bit on  the hollow side, what? But the agony will pass. If I were you, I'd sneak  down and raid the larder after the household have gone to bed. I am told  there's a pretty good steak-and-kidney pie there which will repay  inspection. Have faith, Aunt Dahlia,\" I urged. \"Pretty soon Uncle Tom  will be along, full of sympathy and anxious inquiries.\"    \"Will he? Do you know where he is now?\"    \"I haven't seen him.\"    \"He is in the study with his face buried in his hands, muttering about  civilization and melting pots.\"    \"Eh? Why?\"    \"Because it has just been my painful duty to inform him that Anatole has  given notice.\"    I own that I reeled.    \"What?\"    \"Given notice. As the result of that drivelling scheme of yours. What did  you expect a sensitive, temperamental French cook to do, if you went  about urging everybody to refuse all food? I hear that when the first two  courses came back to the kitchen practically untouched, his feelings were  so hurt that he cried like a child. And when the rest of the dinner  followed, he came to the conclusion that the whole thing was a studied  and calculated insult, and decided to hand in his portfolio.\"    \"Golly!\"    \"You may well say 'Golly!' Anatole, God's gift to the gastric juices,  gone like the dew off the petal of a rose, all through your idiocy.  Perhaps you understand now why I want you to go and jump in that pond. I  might have known that some hideous disaster would strike this house like  a thunderbolt if once you wriggled your way into it and started trying to  be clever.\"    Harsh words, of course, as from aunt to nephew, but I bore her no  resentment. No doubt, if you looked at it from a certain angle, Bertram  might be considered to have made something of a floater.    \"I am sorry.\"    \"What's the good of being sorry?\"    \"I acted for what I deemed the best.\"    \"Another time try acting for the worst. Then we may possibly escape with  a mere flesh wound.\"    \"Uncle Tom's not feeling too bucked about it all, you say?\"    \"He's groaning like a lost soul. And any chance I ever had of getting  that money out of him has gone.\"    I stroked the chin thoughtfully. There was, I had to admit, reason in  what she said. None knew better than I how terrible a blow the passing of  Anatole would be to Uncle Tom.    I have stated earlier in this chronicle that this curious object of the  seashore with whom Aunt Dahlia has linked her lot is a bloke who  habitually looks like a pterodactyl that has suffered, and the reason he  does so is that all those years he spent in making millions in the Far  East put his digestion on the blink, and the only cook that has ever been  discovered capable of pushing food into him without starting something  like Old Home Week in Moscow under the third waistcoat button is this  uniquely gifted Anatole. Deprived of Anatole's services, all he was  likely to give the wife of his b. was a dirty look. Yes, unquestionably,  things seemed to have struck a somewhat rocky patch, and I must admit  that I found myself, at moment of going to press, a little destitute of  constructive ideas.    Confident, however, that these would come ere long, I kept the stiff  upper lip.    \"Bad,\" I conceded. \"Quite bad, beyond a doubt. Certainly a nasty jar for  one and all. But have no fear, Aunt Dahlia, I will fix everything.\"    I have alluded earlier to the difficulty of staggering when you're  sitting down, showing that it is a feat of which I, personally, am not  capable. Aunt Dahlia, to my amazement, now did it apparently without an  effort. She was well wedged into a deep arm-chair, but, nevertheless, she  staggered like billy-o. A sort of spasm of horror and apprehension  contorted her face.    \"If you dare to try any more of your lunatic schemes----\"    I saw that it would be fruitless to try to reason with her. Quite  plainly, she was not in the vein. Contenting myself, accordingly, with a  gesture of loving sympathy, I left the room. Whether she did or did not  throw a handsomely bound volume of the Works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, at  me, I am not in a position to say. I had seen it lying on the table  beside her, and as I closed the door I remember receiving the impression  that some blunt instrument had crashed against the woodwork, but I was  feeling too pre-occupied to note and observe.    I blame myself for not having taken into consideration the possible  effects of a sudden abstinence on the part of virtually the whole  strength of the company on one of Anatole's impulsive Provencal  temperament. These Gauls, I should have remembered, can't take it. Their  tendency to fly off the handle at the slightest provocation is well  known. No doubt the man had put his whole soul into those _nonnettes de  poulet_, and to see them come homing back to him must have gashed him  like a knife.    However, spilt milk blows nobody any good, and it is useless to dwell  upon it. The task now confronting Bertram was to put matters right, and I  was pacing the lawn, pondering to this end, when I suddenly heard a groan  so lost-soulish that I thought it must have proceeded from Uncle Tom,  escaped from captivity and come to groan in the garden.    Looking about me, however, I could discern no uncles. Puzzled, I was  about to resume my meditations, when the sound came again. And peering  into the shadows I observed a dim form seated on one of the rustic  benches which so liberally dotted this pleasance and another dim form  standing beside same. A second and more penetrating glance and I had  assembled the facts.    These dim forms were, in the order named, Gussie Fink-Nottle and Jeeves.  And what Gussie was doing, groaning all over the place like this, was  more than I could understand.    Because, I mean to say, there was no possibility of error. He wasn't  singing. As I approached, he gave an encore, and it was beyond question a  groan. Moreover, I could now see him clearly, and his whole aspect was  definitely sand-bagged.    \"Good evening, sir,\" said Jeeves. \"Mr. Fink-Nottle is not feeling well.\"    Nor was I. Gussie had begun to make a low, bubbling noise, and I could no  longer disguise it from myself that something must have gone seriously  wrong with the works. I mean, I know marriage is a pretty solemn business  and the realization that he is in for it frequently churns a chap up a  bit, but I had never come across a case of a newly-engaged man taking it  on the chin so completely as this.    Gussie looked up. His eye was dull. He clutched the thatch.    \"Goodbye, Bertie,\" he said, rising.    I seemed to spot an error.    \"You mean 'Hullo,' don't you?\"    \"No, I don't. I mean goodbye. I'm off.\"    \"Off where?\"    \"To the kitchen garden. To drown myself.\"    \"Don't be an ass.\"    \"I'm not an ass.... Am I an ass, Jeeves?\"    \"Possibly a little injudicious, sir.\"    \"Drowning myself, you mean?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You think, on the whole, not drown myself?\"    \"I should not advocate it, sir.\"    \"Very well, Jeeves. I accept your ruling. After all, it would be  unpleasant for Mrs. Travers to find a swollen body floating in her pond.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And she has been very kind to me.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And you have been very kind to me, Jeeves.\"    \"Thank you, sir.\"    \"So have you, Bertie. Very kind. Everybody has been very kind to me.  Very, very kind. Very kind indeed. I have no complaints to make. All  right, I'll go for a walk instead.\"    I followed him with bulging eyes as he tottered off into the dark.    \"Jeeves,\" I said, and I am free to admit that in my emotion I bleated  like a lamb drawing itself to the attention of the parent sheep, \"what  the dickens is all this?\"    \"Mr. Fink-Nottle is not quite himself, sir. He has passed through a  trying experience.\"    I endeavoured to put together a brief synopsis of previous events.    \"I left him out here with Miss Bassett.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I had softened her up.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"He knew exactly what he had to do. I had coached him thoroughly in lines  and business.\"    \"Yes, sir. So Mr. Fink-Nottle informed me.\"    \"Well, then----\"    \"I regret to say, sir, that there was a slight hitch.\"    \"You mean, something went wrong?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    I could not fathom. The brain seemed to be tottering on its throne.    \"But how could anything go wrong? She loves him, Jeeves.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10556"],[0,"The Old Man in the Corner (#18)"],[1,"bald-headed adjutant dressed for  a holiday.    \"Of course, all sorts of theories of the theft got about at first. One  of the most popular, and at the same time most quickly exploded, being  that young Schwarz had told a cock-and-bull story, and was the actual  thief himself.    \"However, as I said before, that was very quickly exploded, as Mr.  Schwarz senior, a very wealthy merchant, never allowed his son's  carelessness to be a serious loss to his kind employers. As soon as he  thoroughly grasped all the circumstances of the extraordinary case, he  drew a cheque for L10,500 and remitted it to Messrs. Winslow and  Vassall. It was just, but it was also high-minded.    \"All Liverpool knew of the generous action, as Mr. Winslow took care  that it should; and any evil suspicion regarding young Mr. Schwarz  vanished as quickly as it had come.    \"Then, of course, there was the theory about the Prince and his suite,  and to this day I fancy there are plenty of people in Liverpool, and  also in London, who declare that the so-called Russian police officer  was a confederate. No doubt that theory was very plausible, and Messrs.  Winslow and Vassall spent a good deal of money in trying to prove a case  against the Russian Prince.    \"Very soon, however, that theory was also bound to collapse. Mr.  Fairburn, whose reputation as an investigator of crime waxes in direct  inverted ratio to his capacities, did hit upon the obvious course of  interviewing the managers of the larger London and Liverpool _agents de  change_. He soon found that Prince Semionicz had converted a great deal  of Russian and French money into English bank-notes since his arrival in  this country. More than L30,000 in good solid, honest money was traced  to the pockets of the gentleman with the sixteen quarterings. It seemed,  therefore, more than improbable that a man who was obviously fairly  wealthy would risk imprisonment and hard labour, if not worse, for the  sake of increasing his fortune by L10,000.    \"However, the theory of the Prince's guilt has taken firm root in the  dull minds of our police authorities. They have had every information  with regard to Prince Semionicz's antecedents from Russia; his position,  his wealth, have been placed above suspicion, and yet they suspect and  go on suspecting him or his secretary. They have communicated with the  police of every European capital; and while they still hope to obtain  sufficient evidence against those they suspect, they calmly allow the  guilty to enjoy the fruit of his clever roguery.\"    \"The guilty?\" said Polly. \"Who do you think--\"    \"Who do I think knew at that moment that young Schwarz had money in his  possession?\" he said excitedly, wriggling in his chair like a  Jack-in-the-box. \"Obviously some one was guilty of that theft who knew  that Schwarz had gone to interview a rich Russian, and would in all  probability return with a large sum of money in his possession?\"    \"Who, indeed, but the Prince and his secretary?\" she argued. \"But just  now you said--\"    \"Just now I said that the police were determined to find the Prince and  his secretary guilty; they did not look further than their own stumpy  noses. Messrs. Winslow and Vassall spent money with a free hand in those  investigations. Mr. Winslow, as the senior partner, stood to lose over  L9000 by that robbery. Now, with Mr. Vassall it was different.    \"When I saw how the police went on blundering in this case I took the  trouble to make certain inquiries, the whole thing interested me so  much, and I learnt all that I wished to know. I found out, namely, that  Mr. Vassall was very much a junior partner in the firm, that he only  drew ten per cent of the profits, having been promoted lately to a  partnership from having been senior assistant.    \"Now, the police did not take the trouble to find that out.\"    \"But you don't mean that--\"    \"I mean that in all cases where robbery affects more than one person the  first thing to find out is whether it affects the second party equally  with the first. I proved that to you, didn't I, over that robbery in  Phillimore Terrace? There, as here, one of the two parties stood to  lose very little in comparison with the other--\"    \"Even then--\" she began.    \"Wait a moment, for I found out something more. The moment I had  ascertained that Mr. Vassall was not drawing more than about L500 a year  from the business profits I tried to ascertain at what rate he lived and  what were his chief vices. I found that he kept a fine house in Albert  Terrace. Now, the rents of those houses are L250 a year. Therefore  speculation, horse-racing or some sort of gambling, must help to keep up  that establishment. Speculation and most forms of gambling are  synonymous with debt and ruin. It is only a question of time. Whether  Mr. Vassall was in debt or not at the time, that I cannot say, but this  I do know, that ever since that unfortunate loss to him of about L1000  he has kept his house in nicer style than before, and he now has a good  banking account at the Lancashire and Liverpool bank, which he opened a  year after his 'heavy loss.'\"    \"But it must have been very difficult--\" argued Polly.    \"What?\" he said. \"To have planned out the whole thing? For carrying it  out was mere child's play. He had twenty-four hours in which to put his  plan into execution. Why, what was there to do? Firstly, to go to a  local printer in some out-of-the-way part of the town and get him to  print a few cards with the high-sounding name. That, of course, is done  'while you wait.' Beyond that there was the purchase of a good  second-hand uniform, fur coat, and a beard and a wig from a costumier's.    \"No, no, the execution was not difficult; it was the planning of it all,  the daring that was so fine. Schwarz, of course, was a foreigner; he had  only been in England a little over a fortnight. Vassall's broken English  misled him; probably he did not know the junior partner very intimately.  I have no doubt that but for his uncle's absurd British prejudice and  suspicions against the Russian Prince, Schwarz would not have been so  ready to believe in the latter's roguery. As I said, it would be a great  boon if English tradesmen studied Gotha more; but it was clever, wasn't  it? I couldn't have done it much better myself.\"    That last sentence was so characteristic. Before Polly could think of  some plausible argument against his theory he was gone, and she was  trying vainly to find another solution to the Liverpool mystery.          CHAPTER XIV    THE EDINBURGH MYSTERY      The man in the corner had not enjoyed his lunch. Miss Polly Burton could  see that he had something on his mind, for, even before he began to talk  that morning, he was fidgeting with his bit of string, and setting all  her nerves on the jar.    \"Have you ever felt real sympathy with a criminal or a thief?\" he asked  her after a while.    \"Only once, I think,\" she replied, \"and then I am not quite sure that  the unfortunate woman who did enlist my sympathies was the criminal you  make her out to be.\"    \"You mean the heroine of the York mystery?\" he replied blandly. \"I know  that you tried very hard that time to discredit the only possible  version of that mysterious murder, the version which is my own. Now, I  am equally sure that you have at the present moment no more notion as to  who killed and robbed poor Lady Donaldson in Charlotte Square,  Edinburgh, than the police have themselves, and yet you are fully  prepared to pooh-pooh my arguments, and to disbelieve my version of the  mystery. Such is the lady journalist's mind.\"    \"If you have some cock-and-bull story to explain that extraordinary  case,\" she retorted, \"of course I shall disbelieve it. Certainly, if you  are going to try and enlist my sympathies on behalf of Edith Crawford, I  can assure you you won't succeed.\"    \"Well, I don't know that that is altogether my intention. I see you are  interested in the case, but I dare say you don't remember all the  circumstances. You must forgive me if I repeat that which you know  already. If you have ever been to Edinburgh at all, you will have heard  of Graham's bank, and Mr. Andrew Graham, the present head of the firm,  is undoubtedly one of the most prominent notabilities of 'modern  Athens.'\"    The man in the corner took two or three photos from his pocket-book and  placed them before the young girl; then, pointing at them with his long  bony finger--    \"That,\" he said, \"is Mr. Elphinstone Graham, the eldest son, a typical  young Scotchman, as you see, and this is David Graham, the second son.\"    Polly looked more closely at this last photo, and saw before her a young  face, upon which some lasting sorrow seemed already to have left its  mark. The face was delicate and thin, the features pinched, and the  eyes seemed almost unnaturally large and prominent.    \"He was deformed,\" commented the man in the corner in answer to the  girl's thoughts, \"and, as such, an object of pity and even of repugnance  to most of his friends. There was also a good deal of talk in Edinburgh  society as to his mental condition, his mind, according to many intimate  friends of the Grahams, being at times decidedly unhinged. Be that as it  may, I fancy that his life must have been a very sad one; he had lost  his mother when quite a baby, and his father seemed, strangely enough,  to have an almost unconquerable dislike towards him.    \"Every one got to know presently of David Graham's sad position in his  father's own house, and also of the great affection lavished upon him by  his godmother, Lady Donaldson, who was a sister of Mr. Graham's.    \"She was a lady of considerable wealth, being the widow of Sir George  Donaldson, the great distiller; but she seems to have been decidedly  eccentric. Latterly she had astonished all her family--who were rigid  Presbyterians--by announcing her intention of embracing the Roman  Catholic faith, and then"]]]
