(#18)"],[1," him by the Earl of Essex [5], and gave this answer to the  person who brought them, that he was sure he had no time to spend  them.\"    Mr. Drummond's works, from whence I have extracted the above, are  printed in a thin quarto, and may be seen at Mr. Wilson's at Plato's  Head in the Strand. I have been thus particular in the quotation, that  no one may suspect such extraordinary circumstances to be advanced  upon imagination. In the inscription on his tomb in Westminster Abbey,  it is said he was born in the year 1510, and died 1596; Cambden says  1598, but in regard to his birth they must both be mistaken, for it is  by no means probable he was born so early as 1510, if we judge by  the remarkable circumstance of his standing for a fellowship in  competition with Mr. Andrews, who was not born according to Hughes  till 1555. Besides, if this account of his birth be true, he must have  been sixty years old when he first published his Shepherd's Calendar,  an age not very proper for love; and in this case it is no wonder,  that the beautiful Rosalind slighted his addresses; and he must have  been seventy years old when he entered into business under lord Grey,  who was created deputy in Ireland 1580: for which reasons we may  fairly conclude, that the inscription is false, either by the error of  the carver, or perhaps it was put on when the monument was repaired.    There are very few particulars of this great poet, and it must be a  mortification to all lovers of the Muses, that no more can be found  concerning the life of one who was the greatest ornament of his  profession. No writer ever found a nearer way to the heart than he,  and his verses have a peculiar happiness of recommending the author to  our friendship as well as raising our admiration; one cannot read  him without fancying oneself transported into Fairy Land, and there  conversing with the Graces, in that enchanted region: In elegance of  thinking and fertility of imagination, few of our English authors have  approached him, and no writers have such power as he to awake the  spirit of poetry in others. Cowley owns that he derived inspiration  from him; and I have heard the celebrated Mr. James Thomson, the  author of the Seasons, and justly esteemed one of our best descriptive  poets, say, that he formed himself upon Spenser; and how closely he  pursued the model, and how nobly he has imitated him, whoever reads  his Castle of Indolence with taste, will readily confess.    Mr. Addison, in his characters of the English Poets, addressed to Mr.  Sacheverel, thus speaks of Spenser:      Old Spenser next, warm'd with poetic rage,    In ancient tales amus'd a barb'rous age;    An age, that yet uncultivate and rude,    Where-e'er the poet's fancy led, pursued    Thro' pathless fields, and unfrequented floods,    To dens of dragons, and enchanted woods.    But now the mystic tale, that pleas'd of yore,    Can charm an understanding age no more;    The long spun allegories, fulsome grow,    While the dull moral lyes too plain below.    We view well pleased at distance, all the sights,    Of arms, and palfries, battles, fields, and fights,    And damsels in distress, and courteous knights.    But when we look too near, the shades decay,    And all the pleasing landscape fades away.    It is agreed on all hands, that the distresses of our author helped  to shorten his days, and indeed, when his extraordinary merit is  considered, he had the hardest measure of any of our poets. It appears  from different accounts, that he was of an amiable sweet disposition,  humane and generous in his nature. Besides the Fairy Queen, we find he  had written several other pieces, of which we can only trace out the  titles. Among these, the most considerable were nine comedies, in  imitation of the comedies of his admired Ariosto, inscribed with the  names of the Nine Muses. The rest which are mentioned in his letters,  and those of his friends, are his Dying Pelicane, his Pageants,  Stemmata Dudleyana, the Canticles paraphrazed, Ecclesiastes, Seven  Psalms, Hours of our Lord, Sacrifice of a Sinner, Purgatory, a  S'ennight Slumber, the Court of Cupid, and Hell of Lovers. It is  likewise said, he had written a treatise in prose called the English  Poet: as for the Epithalamion Thamesis, and his Dreams, both mentioned  by himself in one of his letters, Mr. Hughes thinks they are still  preserved, tho' under different names. It appears from what is said of  the Dreams by his friend Mr. Harvey, that they were in imitation of  Petrarch's Visions.    To produce authorities in favour of Spenser, as a poet. I should  reckon an affront to his memory; that is a tribute which I shall only  pay to inferior wits, whose highest honour it is to be mentioned with  respect, by genius's of a superior class. The works of Spenser will  never perish, tho' he has introduced unnecessarily many obsolete terms  into them; there is a flow of poetry, an elegance of sentiment, a fund  of imagination, and an enchanting enthusiasm which will ever secure  him the applauses of posterity while any lovers of poetry remain.    We find little account of the family which Spenser left behind him,  only that in a few particulars of his life prefixed to the last folio  edition of his works, it is said that his great grandson Hugolin  Spenser, after the restoration of king Charles II. was restored by the  court of claims to so much of the lands as could be found to have been  his ancestors; there is another remarkable passage of which (says  Hughes) I can give the reader much better assurance: that a person  came over from Ireland, in King William's time, to sollicit the same  affair, and brought with him letters of recommendation, as a defendant  of Spenser. His name procured him a favourable reception, and  he applied himself particularly to Mr. Congreve, by whom he was  generously recommended to the favour of the earl of Hallifax, who was  then at the head of the treasury; and by that means he obtained his  suit. This man was somewhat advanced in years, and might be the same  mentioned before, who had possibly recovered only some part of his  estate at first, or had been disturbed in the possession of it. He  could give no account of the works of his ancestor, which are wanting,  and which are therefore in all probability irrecoverably lost.    The following stanzas are said to be those with which Sir Philip  Sidney was first struck.      From him returning, sad and comfortless,    As on the way together we did fare,    We met that villain (God from him me bless)    That cursed wight, from whom I 'scaped whylear,    A man of hell that calls himself despair;    Who first us greets, and after fair areeds    Of tidings strange, and of adventures rare:    So creeping close, as snake in hidden weeds,    Inquireth of our states, and of our Knight'y deeds.      Which when he knew, and felt our feeble hearts    Emboss'd with bale, and bitter-biting grief,    Which love had launced with his deadly darts,    With wounding words, and terms of foul reprief,    He plucked from us all hope of due relief;    That erst us held in love of ling'ring life;    Then hopeless, heartless, 'gan the cunning thief    Persuade us die, to stint all further strife:    To me he lent this rope, to him a rusty knife.    The following is the picture.      The darksome cave they enter, where they find,    That cursed man, low sitting on the ground,    Musing full sadly in his sullen mind;    His greasy locks, long growing and unbound,    Disordered hung about his shoulders round,    And hid his face; through which his hollow eyne,    Look'd deadly dull, and stared as astound;    His raw bone cheeks thro' penury and pine,    Were shrunk into his jaws, as he did never dine,      His garments nought, but many ragged clouts,    With thorns together pinn'd and patched was,    The which his naked sides he wrapt abouts;    And him beside, there lay upon the grass    A dreary corse, whose life away did pass,    All wallowed in his own, yet luke-warm blood,    That from his wound yet welled fresh alas;    In which a rusty knife fast fixed stood,    And made an open passage for the gushing flood.    It would perhaps be an injury to Spenser to dismiss his Life without a  few remarks on that great work of his which has placed him among  the foremost of our poets, and discovered so elevated and sublime a  genius. The work I mean is his allegorical poem of the Fairy Queen.    Sir William Temple in his essay on poetry, says, \"that the religion of  the Gentiles had been woven into the contexture of all the ancient  poetry with an agreeable mixture, which made the moderns affect to  give that of christianity a place also in their poems; but the true  religion was not found to become fictitious so well as the false one  had done, and all their attempts of this kind seemed, rather to debase  religion than heighten poetry. Spenser endeavoured to supply this with  morality, and to make instruction, instead of story the subject of an  epic poem. His execution was excellent, and his flights of fancy very  noble and high. But his design was poor; and his moral lay so bare,  that it lost the effect. It is true, the pill was gilded, but so thin  that the colour and the taste were easily discovered.--Mr. Rymer  asserts, that Spenser may be reckoned the first of our heroic poets.  He had a large spirit, a sharp judgment, and a genius for heroic  poetry, perhaps above any that ever wrote since Virgil, but our  misfortune is, he wanted a true idea, and lost himself by following an  unfaithful guide. Tho' besides Homer and Virgil he had read Tasso, yet  he rather suffered himself to be misled by Ariosto, with whom blindly  rambling on marvels and adventures, he makes no conscience of  probability; all is fanciful and chimerical, without any uniformity,  or without any foundation in truth; in a word his poem is perfect  Fairy-Land. Thus far Sir William Temple, and Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106"],[0,"Jungle Tales of Tarzan (#18)"],[1,"then  upon the other.    With a shake of his black shock, Tarzan turned away and resumed his  hunting in another direction; but all day there rose one after another,  above the threshold of his objective mind, memory portraits of Sabor,  of Momaya, and of Teeka--a lioness, a cannibal, and a she-ape, yet to  the ape-man they were identical through motherhood.    It was noon of the third day when Momaya came within sight of the cave  of Bukawai, the unclean.  The old witch-doctor had rigged a framework  of interlaced boughs to close the mouth of the cave from predatory  beasts.  This was now set to one side, and the black cavern beyond  yawned mysterious and repellent.  Momaya shivered as from a cold wind  of the rainy season.  No sign of life appeared about the cave, yet  Momaya experienced that uncanny sensation as of unseen eyes regarding  her malevolently.  Again she shuddered.  She tried to force her  unwilling feet onward toward the cave, when from its depths issued an  uncanny sound that was neither brute nor human, a weird sound that was  akin to mirthless laughter.    With a stifled scream, Momaya turned and fled into the jungle.  For a  hundred yards she ran before she could control her terror, and then she  paused, listening.  Was all her labor, were all the terrors and dangers  through which she had passed to go for naught? She tried to steel  herself to return to the cave, but again fright overcame her.    Saddened, disheartened, she turned slowly upon the back trail toward  the village of Mbonga.  Her young shoulders now were drooped like those  of an old woman who bears a great burden of many years with their  accumulated pains and sorrows, and she walked with tired feet and a  halting step.  The spring of youth was gone from Momaya.    For another hundred yards she dragged her weary way, her brain half  paralyzed from dumb terror and suffering, and then there came to her  the memory of a little babe that suckled at her breast, and of a slim  boy who romped, laughing, about her, and they were both Tibo--her Tibo!    Her shoulders straightened.  She shook her savage head, and she turned  about and walked boldly back to the mouth of the cave of Bukawai, the  unclean--of Bukawai, the witch-doctor.    Again, from the interior of the cave came the hideous laughter that was  not laughter.  This time Momaya recognized it for what it was, the  strange cry of a hyena.  No more did she shudder, but she held her  spear ready and called aloud to Bukawai to come out.    Instead of Bukawai came the repulsive head of a hyena.  Momaya poked at  it with her spear, and the ugly, sullen brute drew back with an angry  growl.  Again Momaya called Bukawai by name, and this time there came  an answer in mumbling tones that were scarce more human than those of  the beast.    \"Who comes to Bukawai?\" queried the voice.    \"It is Momaya,\" replied the woman; \"Momaya from the village of Mbonga,  the chief.    \"What do you want?\"    \"I want good medicine, better medicine than Mbonga's witch-doctor can  make,\" replied Momaya.  \"The great, white, jungle god has stolen my  Tibo, and I want medicine to bring him back, or to find where he is  hidden that I may go and get him.\"    \"Who is Tibo?\" asked Bukawai.    Momaya told him.    \"Bukawai's medicine is very strong,\" said the voice.  \"Five goats and a  new sleeping mat are scarce enough in exchange for Bukawai's medicine.\"    \"Two goats are enough,\" said Momaya, for the spirit of barter is strong  in the breasts of the blacks.    The pleasure of haggling over the price was a sufficiently potent lure  to draw Bukawai to the mouth of the cave.  Momaya was sorry when she  saw him that he had not remained within.  There are some things too  horrible, too hideous, too repulsive for description--Bukawai's face  was of these.  When Momaya saw him she understood why it was that he  was almost inarticulate.    Beside him were two hyenas, which rumor had said were his only and  constant companions.  They made an excellent trio--the most repulsive  of beasts with the most repulsive of humans.    \"Five goats and a new sleeping mat,\" mumbled Bukawai.    \"Two fat goats and a sleeping mat.\" Momaya raised her bid; but Bukawai  was obdurate.  He stuck for the five goats and the sleeping mat for a  matter of half an hour, while the hyenas sniffed and growled and  laughed hideously.  Momaya was determined to give all that Bukawai  asked if she could do no better, but haggling is second nature to black  barterers, and in the end it partly repaid her, for a compromise  finally was reached which included three fat goats, a new sleeping mat,  and a piece of copper wire.    \"Come back tonight,\" said Bukawai, \"when the moon is two hours in the  sky.  Then will I make the strong medicine which shall bring Tibo back  to you.  Bring with you the three fat goats, the new sleeping mat, and  the piece of copper wire the length of a large man's forearm.\"    \"I cannot bring them,\" said Momaya.  \"You will have to come after them.  When you have restored Tibo to me, you shall have them all at the  village of Mbonga.\"    Bukawai shook his head.    \"I will make no medicine,\" he said, \"until I have the goats and the mat  and the copper wire.\"    Momaya pleaded and threatened, but all to no avail.  Finally, she  turned away and started off through the jungle toward the village of  Mbonga.  How she could get three goats and a sleeping mat out of the  village and through the jungle to the cave of Bukawai, she did not  know, but that she would do it somehow she was quite positive--she  would do it or die.  Tibo must be restored to her.    Tarzan coming lazily through the jungle with little Go-bu-balu, caught  the scent of Bara, the deer.  Tarzan hungered for the flesh of Bara.  Naught tickled his palate so greatly; but to stalk Bara with Go-bu-balu  at his heels, was out of the question, so he hid the child in the  crotch of a tree where the thick foliage screened him from view, and  set off swiftly and silently upon the spoor of Bara.    Tibo alone was more terrified than Tibo even among the apes.  Real and  apparent dangers are less disconcerting than those which we imagine,  and only the gods of his people knew how much Tibo imagined.    He had been but a short time in his hiding place when he heard  something approaching through the jungle.  He crouched closer to the  limb upon which he lay and prayed that Tarzan would return quickly.  His wide eyes searched the jungle in the direction of the moving  creature.    What if it was a leopard that had caught his scent! It would be upon  him in a minute.  Hot tears flowed from the large eyes of little Tibo.  The curtain of jungle foliage rustled close at hand.  The thing was but  a few paces from his tree!  His eyes fairly popped from his black face  as he watched for the appearance of the dread creature which presently  would thrust a snarling countenance from between the vines and creepers.    And then the curtain parted and a woman stepped into full view.  With a  gasping cry, Tibo tumbled from his perch and raced toward her.  Momaya  suddenly started back and raised her spear, but a second later she cast  it aside and caught the thin body in her strong arms.    Crushing it to her, she cried and laughed all at one and the same time,  and hot tears of joy, mingled with the tears of Tibo, trickled down the  crease between her naked breasts.    Disturbed by the noise so close at hand, there arose from his sleep in  a near-by thicket Numa, the lion.  He looked through the tangled  underbrush and saw the black woman and her young.  He licked his chops  and measured the distance between them and himself.  A short charge and  a long leap would carry him upon them.  He flicked the end of his tail  and sighed.    A vagrant breeze, swirling suddenly in the wrong direction, carried the  scent of Tarzan to the sensitive nostrils of Bara, the deer.  There was  a startled tensing of muscles and cocking of ears, a sudden dash, and  Tarzan's meat was gone.  The ape-man angrily shook his head and turned  back toward the spot where he had left Go-bu-balu. He came softly, as  was his way.  Before he reached the spot he heard strange sounds--the  sound of a woman laughing and of a woman weeping, and the two which  seemed to come from one throat were mingled with the convulsive sobbing  of a child.  Tarzan hastened, and when Tarzan hastened, only the birds  and the wind went faster.    And as Tarzan approached the sounds, he heard another, a deep sigh.  Momaya did not hear it, nor did Tibo; but the ears of Tarzan were as  the ears of Bara, the deer.  He heard the sigh, and he knew, so he  unloosed the heavy spear which dangled at his back.  Even as he sped  through the branches of the trees, with the same ease that you or I  might take out a pocket handkerchief as we strolled nonchalantly down a  lazy country lane, Tarzan of the Apes took the spear from its thong  that it might be ready against any emergency.    Numa, the lion, did not rush madly to attack.  He reasoned again, and  reason told him that already the prey was his, so he pushed his great  bulk through the foliage and stood eyeing his meat with baleful,  glaring eyes.    Momaya saw him and shrieked, drawing Tibo closer to her breast.  To  have found her child and to lose him, all in a moment!  She raised her  spear, throwing her hand far back of her shoulder.  Numa roared and  stepped slowly forward.  Momaya cast her weapon.  It grazed the tawny  shoulder, inflicting a flesh wound which aroused all the terrific  bestiality of the carnivore, and the lion charged.    Momaya tried to close her eyes, but could not.  She saw the flashing  swiftness of the huge, oncoming death, and then she saw something else.  She saw a mighty, naked white man drop as from the heavens into the  path of the charging lion.  She saw the muscles of a great arm flash in  the light of the equatorial sun as it filtered, dappling, through the  foliage"]]]
