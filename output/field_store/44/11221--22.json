[Illustration:]    LITTLE BLACK  SAMBO    [Illustration:]      Once upon a time there was a little black boy, and his name was Little  Black Sambo.    [Illustration:]    And his mother was called Black Mumbo.    [Illustration:]    And his father was called Black Jumbo.    [Illustration:]    And Black Mumbo made him a beautiful little Red Coat, and a pair of  beautiful little Blue Trousers.    [Illustration:]    And Black Jumbo went to the Bazaar and bought him a beautiful Green  Umbrella and a lovely little Pair of Purple Shoes with Crimson Soles  and Crimson Linings.    And then wasn't Little Black Sambo grand?    [Illustration:]    So he put on all his Fine Clothes and went out for a walk in the  Jungle.    [Illustration:]    And by and by he met a Tiger. And the Tiger said to him, \"Little  Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!\"    [Illustration:]    And Little Black Sambo said, \"Oh! Please, Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up,  and I'll give you my beautiful little Red Coat.\"    [Illustration:]    So the Tiger said, \"Very well, I won't eat you this time, but you must  give me your beautiful little Red Coat.\" So the Tiger got poor Little  Black Sambo's beautiful little Red Coat, and went away saying,    \"Now I'm the grandest Tiger in the Jungle.\"    [Illustration:]    And Little Black Sambo went on, and by and by he met another Tiger,  and it said to him, \"Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!\"    [Illustration:]    And Little Black Sambo said, \"Oh! Please, Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up,  and I'll give you my beautiful little Blue Trousers.\"    [Illustration:]    So the Tiger said, \"Very well, I won't eat you this time, but you must  give me your beautiful little Blue Trousers.\" So the Tiger got poor  Little Black Sambo's beautiful little Blue Trousers, and went away  saying, \"Now I'm the grandest Tiger in the Jungle.\"    [Illustration:]    And Little Black Sambo went on and by and by he met another Tiger, and  it said to him, \"Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!\" And  Little Black Sambo said, \"Oh! Please, Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up, and  I'll give you my beautiful little Purple Shoes with Crimson Soles and  Crimson Linings.\"    [Illustration:]    [Illustration:]    But the Tiger said, \"What use would your shoes be to me? I've got four  feet and you've got only two.\"    [Illustration:]    \"You haven't got enough shoes for me.\" But Little Black Sambo said,  \"You could wear them on your ears.\"    \"So I could,\" said the Tiger, \"that's a very good idea. Give them to  me, and I won't eat you this time.\"    So the Tiger got poor Little Black Sambo's beautiful little Purple  Shoes with Crimson Soles and Crimson Linings, and went away saying,  \"Now I'm the grandest Tiger in the Jungle.\"    [Illustration:]    And by and by Little Black Sambo met another Tiger, and it said to  him, \"Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!\"    [Illustration:]    And Little Black Sambo said, \"Oh! Please, Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up  and I'll give you my beautiful Green Umbrella.\" But the Tiger said,  \"How can I carry an umbrella when I need all my paws for walking  with?\"    [Illustration:]    \"You could tie a knot on your tail, and carry it that way,\" said  Little Black Sambo.    [Illustration:]    \"So I could,\" said the Tiger. \"Give it to me and I won't eat you this  time.\"    [Illustration:]    So he got poor Little Black Sambo's beautiful Green Umbrella, and went  away saying, \"Now _I_'m the grandest Tiger in the Jungle.\"    And poor Little Black Sambo went away crying, because the cruel Tigers  had taken all his fine clothes.    [Illustration:]    Presently he heard a horrible noise that sounded like  \"Gr-r-r-r-rrrrrrr,\" and it got louder and louder.    \"Oh dear!\" said Little Black Sambo, \"There are all the Tigers coming  back to eat me up! What shall I do?\"    So he ran quickly to a palm-tree,    [Illustration:]    And peeped round it to see what the matter was.    And there he saw all the Tigers fighting and disputing which of them  was the grandest.    And at last they all got so angry that they jumped up and took off all  the fine clothes and began to tear each other with their claws and  bite each other with their great big white teeth.    [Illustration:]    And they came, rolling and tumbling, right to the foot of the very  tree where Little Black Sambo was hiding, but he jumped quickly in  behind the umbrella. And the Tigers all caught hold of each others'  tails.    [Illustration:]    As they wrangled and scrambled, and so they found themselves in a ring  around the tree.    Then, when the Tigers were very wee and very far away, Little Black  Sambo jumped up and called out,    \"Oh! Tigers! why have you taken off all your nice clothes? Don't you  want them any more?\"    [Illustration:]    But the Tigers only answered \"Gr-r-r-rrrrr!\"    [Illustration:]    Then Little Black Sambo said, \"If you want them, say so, or I'll take  them away.\" But the Tigers would not let go of each others' tails, and  so they could only say \"Gr-r-r-rrrrrr!\"    [Illustration:]    And the Tigers were very, very angry, but still they would not let go  of each others' tails. And they were so angry that they ran round the  tree, trying to eat each other up, and they ran faster and faster till  they were whirling round so fast that you couldn't see their legs at  all.    [Illustration:]    And they still ran faster and faster and faster, till they all just  melted away, and then there was nothing left but a great big pool of  melted butter (or \"ghi\" as it is called in India) round the foot of  the tree.    Now Black Jumbo was just coming home from his work, with a great big  brass pot in his arms, and when he saw what was left of all the  Tigers, he said,    \"Oh! what lovely melted butter! I'll take that home to Black Mumbo for  her to cook with.\"    So he put it all into the great big brass pot, and took it home to  Black Mumbo to cook with.    When Black Mumbo saw the melted butter, wasn't she pleased!    \"Now,\" said she, \"we'll all have pancakes for supper!\"    [Illustration:]    So she got flour and eggs and milk and sugar and butter, and she made  a huge big plate of most lovely pancakes. And she fried them in the  melted butter which the Tigers had made, and they were just as yellow  and brown as little Tigers.    And then they all sat down to supper. And Black Mumbo ate Twenty-seven  pancakes, and Black Jumbo ate Fifty-five, but Little Black Sambo ate a  Hundred and Sixty-nine, because he was so hungry.

To see the  sun rise and set, within a space of time to be measured by seconds; to  watch (after a little) the moon leap--a pale, and ever growing orb--up  into the night sky, and glide, with a strange swiftness, through the  vast arc of blue; and, presently, to see the sun follow, springing out  of the Eastern sky, as though in chase; and then again the night, with  the swift and ghostly passing of starry constellations, was all too much  to view believingly. Yet, so it was--the day slipping from dawn to dusk,  and the night sliding swiftly into day, ever rapidly and more rapidly.    The last three passages of the sun had shown me a snow-covered earth,  which, at night, had seemed, for a few seconds, incredibly weird under  the fast-shifting light of the soaring and falling moon. Now, however,  for a little space, the sky was hidden, by a sea of swaying,  leaden-white clouds, which lightened and blackened, alternately, with  the passage of day and night.    The clouds rippled and vanished, and there was once more before me, the  vision of the swiftly leaping sun, and nights that came and went  like shadows.    Faster and faster, spun the world. And now each day and night was  completed within the space of but a few seconds; and still the speed  increased.    It was a little later, that I noticed that the sun had begun to have  the suspicion of a trail of fire behind it. This was due, evidently, to  the speed at which it, apparently, traversed the heavens. And, as the  days sped, each one quicker than the last, the sun began to assume the  appearance of a vast, flaming comet[4] flaring across the sky at short,  periodic intervals. At night, the moon presented, with much greater  truth, a comet-like aspect; a pale, and singularly clear, fast traveling  shape of fire, trailing streaks of cold flame. The stars showed now,  merely as fine hairs of fire against the dark.    Once, I turned from the window, and glanced at Pepper. In the flash of  a day, I saw that he slept, quietly, and I moved once more to  my watching.    The sun was now bursting up from the Eastern horizon, like a stupendous  rocket, seeming to occupy no more than a second or two in hurling from  East to West. I could no longer perceive the passage of clouds across  the sky, which seemed to have darkened somewhat. The brief nights,  appeared to have lost the proper darkness of night; so that the hair-like  fire of the flying stars, showed but dimly. As the speed increased, the  sun began to sway very slowly in the sky, from South to North, and then,  slowly again, from North to South.    So, amid a strange confusion of mind, the hours passed.    All this while had Pepper slept. Presently, feeling lonely and  distraught, I called to him, softly; but he took no notice. Again, I  called, raising my voice slightly; still he moved not. I walked over to  where he lay, and touched him with my foot, to rouse him. At the action,  gentle though it was, he fell to pieces. That is what happened; he  literally and actually crumbled into a mouldering heap of bones  and dust.    For the space of, perhaps a minute, I stared down at the shapeless  heap, that had once been Pepper. I stood, feeling stunned. What can have  happened? I asked myself; not at once grasping the grim significance of  that little hill of ash. Then, as I stirred the heap with my foot, it  occurred to me that this could only happen in a great space of time.  Years--and years.    Outside, the weaving, fluttering light held the world. Inside, I stood,  trying to understand what it meant--what that little pile of dust and  dry bones, on the carpet, meant. But I could not think, coherently.    I glanced away, 'round the room, and now, for the first time, noticed  how dusty and old the place looked. Dust and dirt everywhere; piled in  little heaps in the corners, and spread about upon the furniture. The  very carpet, itself, was invisible beneath a coating of the same, all  pervading, material. As I walked, little clouds of the stuff rose up  from under my footsteps, and assailed my nostrils, with a dry, bitter  odor that made me wheeze, huskily.    Suddenly, as my glance fell again upon Pepper's remains, I stood still,  and gave voice to my confusion--questioning, aloud, whether the years  were, indeed, passing; whether this, which I had taken to be a form of  vision, was, in truth, a reality. I paused. A new thought had struck me.  Quickly, but with steps which, for the first time, I noticed, tottered,  I went across the room to the great pier-glass, and looked in. It was  too covered with grime, to give back any reflection, and, with trembling  hands, I began to rub off the dirt. Presently, I could see myself. The  thought that had come to me, was confirmed. Instead of the great, hale  man, who scarcely looked fifty, I was looking at a bent, decrepit man,  whose shoulders stooped, and whose face was wrinkled with the years of a  century. The hair--which a few short hours ago had been nearly coal  black--was now silvery white. Only the eyes were bright. Gradually, I  traced, in that ancient man, a faint resemblance to my self of  other days.    I turned away, and tottered to the window. I knew, now, that I was old,  and the knowledge seemed to confirm my trembling walk. For a little  space, I stared moodily out into the blurred vista of changeful  landscape. Even in that short time, a year passed, and, with a petulant  gesture, I left the window. As I did so, I noticed that my hand shook  with the palsy of old age; and a short sob choked its way through  my lips.    For a little while, I paced, tremulously, between the window and the  table; my gaze wandering hither and thither, uneasily. How dilapidated  the room was. Everywhere lay the thick dust--thick, sleepy, and black.  The fender was a shape of rust. The chains that held the brass  clock-weights, had rusted through long ago, and now the weights lay on  the floor beneath; themselves two cones of verdigris.    As I glanced about, it seemed to me that I could see the very furniture  of the room rotting and decaying before my eyes. Nor was this fancy, on  my part; for, all at once, the bookshelf, along the sidewall, collapsed,  with a cracking and rending of rotten wood, precipitating its contents  upon the floor, and filling the room with a smother of dusty atoms.    How tired I felt. As I walked, it seemed that I could hear my dry  joints, creak and crack at every step. I wondered about my sister. Was  she dead, as well as Pepper? All had happened so quickly and suddenly.  This must be, indeed, the beginning of the end of all things! It  occurred to me, to go to look for her; but I felt too weary. And then,  she had been so queer about these happenings, of late. Of late! I  repeated the words, and laughed, feebly--mirthlessly, as the realization  was borne in upon me that I spoke of a time, half a century gone. Half a  century! It might have been twice as long!    I moved slowly to the window, and looked out once more across the  world. I can best describe the passage of day and night, at this period,  as a sort of gigantic, ponderous flicker. Moment by moment, the  acceleration of time continued; so that, at nights now, I saw the moon,  only as a swaying trail of palish fire, that varied from a mere line of  light to a nebulous path, and then dwindled again, disappearing  periodically.    The flicker of the days and nights quickened. The days had grown  perceptibly darker, and a queer quality of dusk lay, as it were, in the  atmosphere. The nights were so much lighter, that the stars were  scarcely to be seen, saving here and there an occasional hair-like line  of fire, that seemed to sway a little, with the moon.    Quicker, and ever quicker, ran the flicker of day and night; and,  suddenly it seemed, I was aware that the flicker had died out, and,  instead, there reigned a comparatively steady light, which was shed upon  all the world, from an eternal river of flame that swung up and down,  North and South, in stupendous, mighty swings.    The sky was now grown very much darker, and there was in the blue of it  a heavy gloom, as though a vast blackness peered through it upon the  earth. Yet, there was in it, also, a strange and awful clearness, and  emptiness. Periodically, I had glimpses of a ghostly track of fire that  swayed thin and darkly toward the sun-stream; vanished and reappeared.  It was the scarcely visible moon-stream.    Looking out at the landscape, I was conscious again, of a blurring sort  of 'flitter,' that came either from the light of the ponderous-swinging  sun-stream, or was the result of the incredibly rapid changes of the  earth's surface. And every few moments, so it seemed, the snow would lie  suddenly upon the world, and vanish as abruptly, as though an invisible  giant 'flitted' a white sheet off and on the earth.    Time fled, and the weariness that was mine, grew insupportable. I  turned from the window, and walked once across the room, the heavy dust  deadening the sound of my footsteps. Each step that I took, seemed a  greater effort than the one before. An intolerable ache, knew me in  every joint and limb, as I trod my way, with a weary uncertainty.    By the opposite wall, I came to a weak pause, and wondered, dimly, what  was my intent. I looked to my left, and saw my old chair. The thought of  sitting in it brought a faint sense of comfort to my bewildered  wretchedness. Yet, because I was so weary and old and tired, I would  scarcely brace my mind to do anything but stand, and wish myself past  those few yards. I rocked, as I stood. The floor, even, seemed a place  for rest; but the dust lay so thick and sleepy and black. I turned, with  a great effort of will, and made toward my chair. I reached it, with a  groan of thankfulness. I sat down.    Everything about me appeared to be growing dim. It was all so strange  and unthought of. Last night, I"]]]
