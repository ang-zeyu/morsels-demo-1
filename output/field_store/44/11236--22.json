Now therefore hearken unto their voice; howbeit yet protest  solemnly unto them, and show them the manner of the king that shall  reign over them.\" The Almighty would not take away the free-will of the  people; but Samuel is required to show them the perversity of their  will, and that if they should choose evil the consequences would be on  their heads and the heads of their children, from generation to  generation.    Samuel therefore spake unto the people,--probably the elders and leading  men, for the aristocratic element of society prevailed, as in the Middle  Ages of feudal Europe, when even royal power was merely nominal, and  barons and bishops ruled,--and said: \"This will be the manner of the  king that shall reign over you: He shall take your sons and appoint them  for himself for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run  before his chariots; and he shall appoint captains over thousands and  captains over fifties, and will set them to ear [plough] his ground and  reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the  instruments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to be  confectioners [or perfumers] and cooks and bakers. And he will take your  fields and your vineyards and your olive-yards, even the best of them,  and give them to his servants; and he will take the tenth of your seed  and of your vineyards, and give to his officers and to his servants. And  he will take your men-servants and your maid-servants, and your  goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. And he  will take the tenth of your sheep; and ye shall be his servants. And ye  will cry out in that day because of your king which ye have chosen you,  and the Lord will not hear you in that day.\"    Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they  said, \"Nay, but we will have a king over us, that we also may be like  all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us,  and fight our battles.\" It would thus appear that the monarchy which the  people sought would necessarily become nearly absolute, limited only by  the will of God as interpreted by priests and prophets,--for the  theocracy was not to be destroyed, but still maintained as even superior  to the royal authority. The future king was to be supreme in affairs of  state, in the direction of armies, in the appointment of captains and  commanders, in the general superintendence of the realm in worldly  matters; but he could not go contrary to the divine commands as they  would be revealed to him, without incurring a fearful penalty. He could  not interfere with the functions of the priesthood under any pretence  whatever; and further, he was required to rule on principles of equity  and immutable justice. He could not repel the divine voice, whether it  spake to his consciousness or was revealed to him by divinely  commissioned prophets, without the certainty of divine chastisement.  Thus was his power limited, even by invisible forces superior to his  own; for Jehovah had not withdrawn his special jurisdiction over the  chosen people for whom he was preparing a splendid destiny,--that is,  through them, the redemption of the world.    Whether the people of Israel did not believe the predictions of the  prophet, or wished to have a kingly government in spite of its evils, in  order to become more powerful as a nation, we do not know. All that we  know is that they persisted in their demand, and that God granted their  request. With all the memories and traditions of their slavery in the  land of Egypt, and the grinding despotism incident to an absolute  monarchy of which their ancestors bore witness, they preferred despotism  with its evils to the independence they had enjoyed under the Judges;  for nationality, to which the Jewish people were casting longing eyes,  demands law and order as the first condition of society. In obedience to  this same principle the grinding monarchy of Louis XIV. seemed  preferable to the turbulence and anarchy of the Middle Ages, since  unarmed and obscure citizens felt safe in their humble avocations. In  like manner, after the license of the French Revolution the people said,  \"Give us a king once more!\" and seated Napoleon on the throne of the  Bourbons,--a ruler who took one man out of every five adults to recruit  his armies and consolidate his power, which he called the glory of  France. Thus kings have reigned by the will of the people,--or, as they  call it, by the grace of God,--from Saul and David to our own times,  except in those few countries where liberty is preferred to material  power and military laurels.    The peculiar situation of the Israelites in a narrow strip of territory  which was the highway between Syria and Egypt, likely to be overrun by  Aramaeans, Assyrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians, to say nothing of the  hostile nations which surrounded them, such as Moabites and Philistines,  necessarily made them a warlike people (like the inhabitants of the  Swiss Cantons five or six hundred years ago), and they were hence led to  put a high estimate on military qualities, especially on the general who  led them to battle. They accordingly desired a greater centralized power  than the Judges wielded, which could be exercised only by a king,  intrenched in a strong capital. Their desire for a king was natural, and  almost excusable if they were willing to pay the inevitable price. They  simply wished to surrender liberty for protection and political safety.  They did not repudiate the fundamental doctrine of their religion; they  simply wanted a change of government,--a more efficient administration.    The selection of a king did not rest with the people, however, but with  the great prophet who had ruled them with so much wisdom and ability,  and who was regarded as the interpreter of the will of God.    Samuel, by the direction of God, did not go into the powerful tribe of  Ephraim, which possessed one half of the Israelitish territory, to  select a sovereign, but to the smallest of the tribes, that of  Benjamin,--the most warlike, however,--and to one of the least of the  families of that tribe, dwelling in very humble life. Kish, the  Benjamite, had sent out his son Saul in quest of three asses which had  strayed away from the farm,--a man so poor that he had no money to give  to the seer who should direct his search, as was customary, and was  obliged to borrow a quarter of a shekel from his servant when they went  together to seek the counsel of Samuel. But this obscure youth was \"a  choice young man, and a goodly.\" He had a commanding presence, was very  beautiful, and was head and shoulders taller than any other man of his  tribe,--a man every way likely to succeed in war. Samuel no sooner saw  the commanding figure and intelligent countenance of Saul than he was  assured that this was the man whom the Lord had chosen to be the future  captain and champion of Israel. He at once treated him with  distinguished honor, and made him sit at his own table, much to the  amazement of the thirty nobles who also were bidden to a banquet. The  prophet took the young man aside, conducted him to the top of his  house, anointed him with the sacred oil, kissed him (a form of  allegiance), and communicated to him the will of God. But Saul was only  privately consecrated, and with rare discretion told no man of his good  fortune,--for he had not yet distinguished himself in any way, and would  have been laughed to scorn by his relatives, as Joseph was by his  brothers, had he revealed his destiny.    Nor did Samuel dare to tell the people of the man whom the Lord had  chosen to rule over them, but assembled all the tribes, that the choice  might be publicly indicated. Probably to their astonishment the little  tribe of Benjamin was \"taken,\"--that is pointed out, presumably by lot,  as was their custom when appealing for divine direction; and out of the  tribe of Benjamin the family of Matri was chosen, and Saul the son of  Kish was selected. But Saul could not be found. With rare modesty and  humility he had hidden himself. When at length they brought him from his  hiding-place Samuel said unto the people, \"See ye him whom the Lord hath  chosen, that there is none like him among all the people!\" And such was  the authority of Samuel that the people shouted, saying, \"God save the  king!\"--a circumstance interesting as being the first recorded utterance  of a cry that has been echoed the world over by many a loyal people.    Not yet, however, was Saul clothed with full power as a king. Samuel  still remained the acknowledged ruler until Saul should distinguish  himself in battle. This soon took place. With heroic valor he delivered  Jabesh-Gilead from the hosts of the Ammonites when that city was about  to fall into their hands, and silenced the envy of his enemies. In a  burst of popular enthusiasm Samuel collected the people in Gilgal, and  there formally installed Saul as King of Israel.    Samuel was now an old man, and was glad to lay down his heavy burden and  put it on the shoulders of Saul. Yet he did not retire from the active  government without making a memorable speech to the assembled nation, in  which with transcendent dignity he appealed to the people in attestation  of his incorruptible integrity as a judge and ruler. \"Behold, here I am!  Witness against me before the Lord, and before his anointed. Whose ox  have I taken, or whose ass have I taken, or whom have I defrauded? Or of  whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my eyes therewith? And  they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us; neither hast  thou taken aught of any man's hand.\" Then Samuel closed his address with  an injunction to both king and people to obey the commandments of God,  and denouncing the penalty of disobedience: \"Only fear the Lord, and  serve Him in truth and with all your heart, for consider what great  things He "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10479"],[0,"Our Churches and Chapels: Their Parsons, Priests, & Congregations (#18)"],[1," his hands when preaching. While  conducting the preliminary service he wears a white surplice; in the  pulpit he has a black gown. He looks very sacerdotal, coldly-  clerical, singularly-sad in each place. His voice is deep toned and  has a melancholy authoritative ring in it. He is fond of making  critical allusions in his sermons; and is rather lengthy in his  talk. Some of the old Puritans used to get to a \"nineteenthly point\"  in their discourses, but Mr. Rendell has not reached that numeric  climax. He can occasionally get to a fifth point, and then subdivide  it, before giving that final \"word of advice\" which parsons are so  enamoured of; but he never branches out beyond this stage. His style  of preaching is easy; but it is very solemn.  Occasionally he pushes  a little Latin into his discourses and at intervals be graces them  with morsels of Greek. He can be practical sometimes; can say a wise  and generous thing at intervals; but he is often very mysterious,  and has a large reverence for that which very few people can get at-  -\"the spiritual sense.\" Mr. Rendell is an author as well as a  preacher; he has dived into anti-diluvian history, and has tried to  bring up mystic treasures from the post-diluvian period.  Furthermore, he has written a prize essay on \"The Last Judgment.\"  And in addition to everything he is the editor of \"The Juvenile  Magazine;\" but the salary is only poor. Still he may console himself  with the thought that he gets as much for his annual services on  behalf of modern juveniles as Milton did for his Paradise Lost on  behalf of all posterity--a clear 5 pounds note. He has a sharp eye  in his head, and there is an aristocratic reverentialness in his  look. Learned he is in some things; but we are afraid he is too  profound and sad. He has a good analytical faculty, and is a very  fair polemical writer; but he is very solemn in tone--very serious,  too wise-looking, and phlegmatic. His style of speaking has the ring  of earnestness in it; and his delivery is accompanied with a  tolerable amount of activity. If he were a little more buoyant, if  he could put on a less learned and more cheerful look, and would not  got so very grave in his style, he would be better relished.  Polemically, he has done fair service for the denomination to which  he belongs--done it sometimes in spite of Lily, and Linacre, and  their descendants; and if he is not immaculate, he has at least the  satisfaction of knowing that nobody else is, and never will be until  they reach the real New Jerusalem.        TRINITY CHURCH.        In a part of the town pre-eminently dim, intricate, and populous  stands \"The Church of the Holy Trinity.\" Father Time and the smoke  of twice five hundred chimneys have darkened its fabric, and  transmuted its chiselled stone walls into a dull pile of masonry.  But it is a beautiful church for all that. If the exterior has been  carbonised and begrimed, the interior has enjoyed a charmed life,  and is apparently as young today as it was on \"Friday, the eighth of  December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and  fifteen,\" when \"George H. Chester\" consecrated the building and all  thereunto belonging. The first stone of this church was laid on the  4th of June, 1814--the natal anniversary of George III--by Sir Henry  Philip Hoghton, of Hoghton, the lay rector and patron of the parish  of Preston. Under that first stone there were deposited a number of  coins, two scrolls, and one newspaper--the Preston Chronicle. The  first minister of Trinity Church was the Rev. Edward Law, a  gentleman, who, according to a local historian, \"ably defended the  belief of the adorable Trinity in a series of letters, assisted by  the Rev. R. Baxter, of Stonyhurst, against a Unitarian minister, the  Rev. T. C. Holland, which appeared in the Preston Chronicle,\" and  were subsequently reprinted and sold for the enlightenment and  mystification of all polemically-minded men. Trinity Church is built  on a plot of ground once called Patten Field. Moderns know little,  if anything, of that field; but Patten-street--a delicious  thoroughfare proximately fronting the church--still remains as a  lingering topographical reminder of olden days. There were few  houses in the region of Patten Field when Trinity Church was built:  pastures were its colleagues, and patches of greensward its regular  companions. But things have changed since then, and a mile of  houses, stretching northward, and westward, and eastward now fills  up the ancient hiatus. Trinity Church cost 9,080 pounds 9s. 3d., and  that sum was raised partly by subscriptions and donations and partly  by the sale of pews. Who gave the ultimate threepence we cannot  tell, neither are we told in what way it was expended.    The architecture of the building is Gothic. There is nothing very  striking about the exterior; indeed it looks cold, and sad, and  forsaken, and its associations don't improve it. The church is built  upon a hill, and, therefore, can't be hid. Its approaches may have  been good at one time; its environs may have been aristocratic and  healthy in 1814, but they are not so now. Smoky workshops, old  buildings, with the windows awfully smashed in, houses given up to  \"lodgings for travellers here,\" densely packed dingy cottages, and  the tower of a wind mill, which for years nobody has been willing to  either mend or pull down, are its architectural concomitants. The  approaches to the church are varied and aggravatingly awkward. You  can get to the church from any point of the compass, but access to  it may mean anything--perhaps, a wandering up courts and passages, a  turning round the corners of old narrow streets, an unsavoury  acquaintance with the regions of trampery, and an uncomfortable  perambulation along corn-torturing causeways and clumsily paved  roads. Pigeon flyers, dog fanciers, gossipping vagrants, crying  children, old iron, stray hens, women with a passion for sitting on  door steps, men looking at nothing with their hands in their  pockets, ancient rags pushed into broken windows, and the mirage of  perhaps one policeman on duty constitute the sights in the  neighbourhood. The church-yard, which contains several substantial  tombs and monuments, is in a decent state of preservation. It looks  grave as all such places must do; but it is kept in order, and men  of the Hervey type of mind might meditate very beneficially amongst  its tombs. Trinity may not be the longest, but it is certainly about  the widest, church in the town. It is neither a high nor a low, but  an absolutely broad church.    Internally it is excellent. On entering the place you are perfectly  surprised at its capaciousness. Nothing cramped, nothing showy,  nothing dim, grim, nor shabby-genteel enters into its proportions.  It is finely expansive, airy, light, and well made. Goodness of  build without gaudiness, sanctity without sadness, and evenness of  finish without new-fangled intricacy, pervade it. It is fit for  either beggars or plutocrats. There is not a better, not a plainer,  neater, nor more respectable looking church in the town. And there  is not a cleaner. Some of our churches have for years been  cultivating a close and irreligious acquaintance with dirt--with  dust, cobwebs, mould, and other ancient kinds of mild nastiness; but  Trinity Church is a model of cleanliness. Everything in it seems  clean--the windows, pews, cushions, mats, floors, &c., are all  clean; there is even an air of cleanliness about the sweeping  brushes and the venerable dust bin. The church has accomodation for  about 1,400 persons of ordinary proportions. The seats are  constructed on comfortable principles, and that very traditional  article--green baize--plays an important and goodly part in them. At  the top and bottom of the middle range, on the ground floor, the  seats are of various shapes--some narrow, some broad, a few oblong,  and others inclining to the orthodox square. The central ones are  regular, and so are those at the sides. In the galleries there is a  slight irregularity of shape in the seats; but they are all  substantial, and the bulk easy. There are 46 free pews or benches in  the church. They run along the sides on the ground floor, and will  accommodate nearly 280 persons. All the other seats, excepting about  two, were sold to various parties at the time the church was opened-  -not for any fixed price all round, but for just as much as the  trustees could get. Many were bought by high-class local families,  and the names of several of the original and present proprietors--  inscribed on small brass plates--may now be seen on the front sides.  Fifty of the pews have ground rents, amounting respectively to 1  pounds a year, attached to them. Several of the pews are let, the  owners caring little for them, or having removed to other towns;  many have been re-sold at intervals; and three have been forfeited  through their proprietors having neglected to pay certain trifling  rates laid upon them. The pews have deteriorated much in price. Once  upon a time, when nearly all the fashionable families of Preston  went to Trinity Church, neither Platonic love nor current coin could  secure a pew. It was a la mode in its most respectable sense, it was  Sabbatical ton in its genteelest form, to have and to hold a pew at  Holy Trinity when George the Third was king. And for a considerable  period afterwards this continued to be the case. The \"exact thing\"  on a Sunday in Preston, 40 nay 20 years ago, was to own a pew at  Trinity Church, to walk up to it, and to sit therein:  it was  superior to every modern process, and beat \"Walking in the Zoo\" and  all that species of delightful work hollow. Pews were then worth  something; they are now worth little. Only the other week a pew,  originally bought for about 70 pounds, was sold by auction for 8  pounds! And it is said that some proprietors would not be very  unwilling to"]]]
