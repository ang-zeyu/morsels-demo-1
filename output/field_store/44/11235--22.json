He considered--at least his course can only be so  interpreted--that the organization of a League in all its details was  the principal task to be accomplished by the Conference, a task that he  felt must be completed before other matters were settled. The conclusion  is that the necessity of an immediate peace seemed to him subordinate to  the necessity of erecting an international agency to preserve the peace  when it was restored. In fact one may infer that the President was  disposed to employ the general longing for peace as a means of exerting  pressure on the delegates in Paris and on their Governments to accept  his plan for a League. It is generally believed that objections to  certain provisions of the Covenant were not advanced or, if advanced,  were not urged because the discussion of objections would mean delay in  negotiating the peace.    Mr. Wilson gave most of his time and thought prior to his departure for  the United States in February, 1919, to the revision of the plan of  organization which he had prepared and to the conversion of the more  influential members of the Conference to its support. While other  questions vital to a preliminary peace treaty were brought up in the  Council of Ten, he showed a disposition to keep them open and to avoid  their settlement until the Covenant had been reported to the Conference.  In this I could not conscientiously follow him. I felt that the policy  was wholly wrong since it delayed the peace.    Though recognizing the President's views as to the relative importance  of organizing a League and of restoring peace without delay, and  suspecting that he purposed to use the impatience and fear of the  delegates to break down objections to his plan of organization, I still  hoped that the critical state of affairs in Europe might induce him to  adopt another course. With that hope I began the preparation of a  resolution to be laid before the Conference, which, if adopted, would  appear in the preliminary treaty in the form of declarations which would  constitute the bases of a future negotiation regarding a League  of Nations.    At a conference on January 20 between the President and the American  Commissioners, all being present except Colonel House, I asked the  President if he did not think that, in view of the shortness of time  before he would be compelled to return to Washington on account of the  approaching adjournment of Congress, it would be well to prepare a  resolution of this sort and to have it adopted in order that it might  clear the way for the determination of other matters which should be  included in a preliminary treaty. From the point of view of policy I  advanced the argument that a series of declarations would draw the fire  of the opponents and critics of the League and would give opportunity  for an expression of American public opinion which would make possible  the final drafting of the charter of a League in a way to win the  approval of the great mass of the American people and in all probability  insure approval of the Covenant by the Senate of the United States.    In reviewing what took place at this conference I realize now, as I did  not then, that it was impolitic for me to have presented an argument  based on the assumption that changes in the President's plan might be  necessary, as he might interpret my words to be another effort to revise  the theory of his plan. At the time, however, I was so entirely  convinced of the expediency of this course, from the President's own  point of view as well as from the point of view of those who gave first  place to restoring peace, that I believed he would see the advantage to  be gained and would adopt the course suggested. I found that I was  mistaken. Mr. Wilson without discussing the subject said that he did not  think that a resolution of that sort was either necessary or advisable.    While this definite rejection of the proposal seemed to close the door  to further effort in that direction, I decided to make another attempt  before abandoning the plan. The next afternoon (January 21) at a meeting  of the Council of Ten, the discussion developed in a way that gave me an  excuse to present the proposal informally to the Council. The advantages  to be gained by adopting the suggested action apparently appealed to the  members, and their general approval of it impressed the President, for  he asked me in an undertone if I had prepared the resolution. I replied  that I had been working upon it, but had ceased when he said to me the  day before that he did not think it necessary or advisable, adding that  I would complete the draft if he wished me to do so. He said that he  would be obliged to me if I would prepare one.    Encouraged by the support received in the Council and by the seeming  willingness of the President to give the proposal consideration, I  proceeded at once to draft a resolution.    The task was not an easy one because it would have been useless to  insert in the document any declaration which seemed to be contradictory  of the President's theory of an affirmative guaranty or which was not  sufficiently broad to be interpreted in other terms in the event that  American public opinion was decidedly opposed to his theory, as I felt  that it would be. It was also desirable, from my point of view, that the  resolution should contain a declaration in favor of the equality of  nations or one which would prevent the establishment of an oligarchy of  the Great Powers, and another declaration which would give proper place  to the administration of legal justice in international disputes.    The handicaps and difficulties under which I labored are manifest, and  the resolution as drafted indicates them in that it does not express as  clearly and unequivocally as it would otherwise do the principles which  formed the bases of the articles which I handed to the President on  January 7 and which have already been quoted _in extenso_.    The text of the resolution, which was completed on the 22d, reads as  follows:       \"_Resolved_ that the Conference makes the following declaration:       \"That the preservation of international peace is the standing policy     of civilization and to that end a league of nations should be     organized to prevent international wars;       \"That it is a fundamental principle of peace that all nations are     equally entitled to the undisturbed possession of their respective     territories, to the full exercise of their respective sovereignties,     and to the use of the high seas as the common property of all     peoples; and       \"That it is the duty of all nations to engage by mutual covenants--       \"(1) To safeguard from invasion the sovereign rights of one another;       \"(2) To submit to arbitration all justiciable disputes which fail of     settlement by diplomatic arrangement;       \"(3) To submit to investigation by the league of nations all     non-justiciable disputes which fail of settlement by diplomatic     arrangement; and       \"(4) To abide by the award of an arbitral tribunal and to respect a     report of the league of nations after investigation;       \"That the nations should agree upon--       \"(1) A plan for general reduction of armaments on land and sea;       \"(2) A plan for the restriction of enforced military service and the     governmental regulation and control of the manufacture and sale of     munitions of war;       \"(3) Full publicity of all treaties and international agreements;       \"(4) The equal application to all other nations of commercial and     trade regulations and restrictions imposed by any nation; and       \"(5) The proper regulation and control of new states pending complete     independence and sovereignty.\"    This draft of a resolution was discussed with the other American  Commissioners, and after some changes of a more or less minor character  which it seemed advisable to make because of the appointment of a  Commission on the League of Nations at a plenary session of the  Conference on January 25, of which Commission President Wilson and  Colonel House were the American members, I sent the draft to the  President on the 31st, four days before the Commission held its first  meeting in Colonel House's office at the Hotel Crillon.    As the Sixty-Fifth Congress would come to an end on March 4, and as the  interpretation which had been placed on certain provisions of the  Federal Constitution required the presence of the Chief Executive in  Washington during the last days of a session in order that he might pass  upon legislation enacted in the days immediately preceding adjournment,  Mr. Wilson had determined that he could not remain in Paris after  February 14. At the time that I sent him the proposed resolution there  remained, therefore, but two weeks for the Commission on the League of  Nations to organize, to deliberate, and to submit its report to the  Conference, provided its report was made prior to the President's  departure for the United States. It did not seem to me conceivable that  the work of the Commission could be properly completed in so short a  time if the President's Covenant became the basis of its deliberations.  This opinion was shared by many others who appreciated the difficulties  and intricacies of the subject and who felt that a hasty and undigested  report would be unwise and endanger the whole plan of a world  organization.    In view of this situation, which seemed to be a strong argument for  delay in drafting the plan of international organization, I wrote a  letter to the President, at the time I sent him the proposed resolution,  saying that in my opinion no plan could be prepared with sufficient care  to warrant its submission to the Conference on the Preliminaries of  Peace before he left Paris and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10477"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 01: The Old Pagan Civilizations (#18)"],[1," agriculture that he was made minister of Justice; and so wonderful was  his management, that soon there was no necessity to put the penal laws  in execution, since no offenders could be found. Confucius held his high  office as minister of Justice for two years longer, and some suppose he  was made prime minister. His authority certainly continued to increase.  He exalted the sovereign, depressed the ministers, and weakened private  families,--just as Richelieu did in France, strengthening the throne at  the expense of the nobility. It would thus seem that his political  reforms were in the direction of absolute monarchy, a needed force in  times of anarchy and demoralization. So great was his fame as a  statesman that strangers came from other States to see him.    These reforms in the state of Loo gave annoyance to the neighboring  princes; and to undermine the influence of Confucius with the duke,  these princes sent the duke a present of eighty beautiful girls,  possessing musical and dancing accomplishments, and also one hundred and  twenty splendid horses. As the duke soon came to think more of his  girls and horses than of his reforms, Confucius became disgusted,  resigned his office, and retired to private life. Then followed thirteen  years of homeless wandering. He was now fifty-six years of age,  depressed and melancholy in view of his failure with princes. He was  accompanied in his travels by some of his favorite disciples, to whom he  communicated his wisdom.    But his fame preceded him wherever he journeyed, and such was the  respect for his character and teachings that he was loaded with presents  by the people, and was left unmolested to do as he pleased. The  dissoluteness of courts filled him with indignation and disgust; and he  was heard to exclaim on one occasion, \"I have not seen one who loves  virtue as he loves beauty,\"--meaning the beauty of women. The love of  the beautiful, in an artistic sense, is a Greek and not an  Oriental idea.    In the meantime Confucius continued his wanderings from city to city and  State to State, with a chosen band of disciples, all of whom became  famous. He travelled for the pursuit of knowledge, and to impress the  people with his doctrines. A certain one of his followers was questioned  by a prince as to the merits and peculiarities of his master, but was  afraid to give a true answer. The sage hearing of it, said, \"You should  have told him, He is simply a man who in his eager pursuit of knowledge  forgets his food, who in the joy of his attainments forgets his sorrows,  and who does not perceive that old age is coming on.\" How seldom is it  that any man reaches such a height! In a single sentence the philosopher  describes himself truly and impressively.    At last, in the year 491 B.C., a new sovereign reigned in Loo, and with  costly presents invited Confucius to return to his native State. The  philosopher was now sixty-nine years of age, and notwithstanding the  respect in which he was held, the world cannot be said to have dealt  kindly with him. It is the fate of prophets and sages to be rejected.  The world will not bear rebukes. Even a friend, if discreet, will rarely  venture to tell another friend his faults. Confucius told the truth when  pressed, but he does not seem to have courted martyrdom; and his manners  and speech were too bland, too proper, too unobtrusive to give much  offence. Luther was aided in his reforms by his very roughness and  boldness, but he was surrounded by a different class of people from  those whom Confucius sought to influence. Conventional, polite,  considerate, and a great respecter of persons in authority was the  Chinese sage. A rude, abrupt, and fierce reformer would have had no  weight with the most courteous and polite people of whom history speaks;  whose manners twenty-five hundred years ago were substantially the same  as they are at the present day,--a people governed by the laws of  propriety alone.    The few remaining years of Confucius' life were spent in revising his  writings; but his latter days were made melancholy by dwelling on the  evils of the world that he could not remove. Disappointment also had  made him cynical and bitter, like Solomon of old, although from  different causes. He survived his son and his most beloved disciples. As  he approached the dark valley he uttered no prayer, and betrayed no  apprehension. Death to him was a rest. He died at the age of  seventy-three.    In the tenth book of his Analects we get a glimpse of the habits of the  philosopher. He was a man of rule and ceremony.-He was particular about  his dress and appearance. He was no ascetic, but moderate and temperate.  He lived chiefly on rice, like the rest of his countrymen, but required  to have his rice cooked nicely, and his meat cut properly. He drank wine  freely, but was never known to have obscured his faculties by this  indulgence. I do not read that tea was then in use. He was charitable  and hospitable, but not ostentatious. He generally travelled in a  carriage with two horses, driven by one of his disciples; but a carriage  in those days was like one of our carts. In his village, it is said, he  looked simple and sincere, as if he were one not able to speak; when  waiting at court, or speaking with officers of an inferior grade, he  spoke freely, but in a straightforward manner; with officers of a  higher, grade he spoke blandly, but precisely; with the prince he was  grave, but self-possessed. When eating he did not converse; when in bed  he did not speak. If his mat were not straight he did not sit on it.  When a friend sent him a present he did not bow; the only present for  which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice. He was capable of  excessive grief, with all his placidity. When his favorite pupil died,  he exclaimed, \"Heaven is destroying me!\" His disciples on this said,  \"Sir, your grief is excessive.\" \"It is excessive,\" he replied. \"If I am  not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?\"    The reigning prince of Loo caused a temple to be erected over the  remains of Confucius, and the number of his disciples continually  increased. The emperors of the falling dynasty of Chow had neither the  intelligence nor the will to do honor to the departed philosopher, but  the emperors of the succeeding dynasties did all they could to  perpetuate his memory. During his life Confucius found ready acceptance  for his doctrines, and was everywhere revered among the people, though  not uniformly appreciated by the rulers, nor able permanently to  establish the reforms he inaugurated. After his death, however, no honor  was too great to be rendered him. The most splendid temple in China was  built over his grave, and he received a homage little removed from  worship. His writings became a sacred rule of faith and practice;  schools were based upon them, and scholars devoted themselves to their  interpretation. For two thousand years Confucius has reigned  supreme,--the undisputed teacher of a population of three or four  hundred millions.    Confucius must be regarded as a man of great humility, conscious of  infirmities and faults, but striving after virtue and perfection. He  said of himself, \"I have striven to become a man of perfect virtue, and  to teach others without weariness; but the character of the superior  man, carrying out in his conduct what he professes, is what I have not  attained to. I am not one born in the possession of knowledge, but I am  one who is fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking it there. I am a  transmitter, and not a maker.\" If he did not lay claim to divine  illumination, he felt that he was born into the world for a special  purpose; not to declare new truths, not to initiate any new ceremony,  but to confirm what he felt was in danger of being lost,--the most  conservative of all known reformers.    Confucius left behind voluminous writings, of which his Analects, his  book of Poetry, his book of History, and his Rules of Propriety are the  most important. It is these which are now taught, and have been taught  for two thousand years, in the schools and colleges of China. The  Chinese think that no man so great and perfect as he has ever lived. His  writings are held in the same veneration that Christians attach to their  own sacred literature. There is this one fundamental difference between  the authors of the Bible and the Chinese sage,--that he did not like to  talk of spiritual things; indeed, of them he was ignorant, professing no  interest in relation to the working out of abstruse questions, either of  philosophy or theology. He had no taste or capacity for such inquiries.  Hence, he did not aspire to throw any new light on the great problems of  human condition and destiny; nor did he speculate, like the Ionian  philosophers, on the creation or end of things. He was not troubled  about the origin or destiny of man. He meddled neither with physics nor  metaphysics, but he earnestly and consistently strove to bring to light  and to enforce those principles which had made remote generations wise  and virtuous. He confined his attention to outward phenomena,--to the  world of sense and matter; to forms, precedents, ceremonies,  proprieties, rules of conduct, filial duties, and duties to the State;  enjoining temperance, honesty, and sincerity as the cardinal and  fundamental laws of private and national prosperity. He was no prophet  of wrath, though living in a corrupt age. He utters no anathemas on  princes, and no woes on peoples. Nor does he glow with exalted hopes of  a millennium of bliss, or of the beatitudes of a future state. He was  not stern and indignant like Elijah, but more like the courtier and  counsellor Elisha. He was a man of the world, and all his teachings have  reference to respectability in the world's regard. He doubted more than  he believed.    And yet in many of his sayings Confucius rises to an exalted"]]]
