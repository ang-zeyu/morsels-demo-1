That a Being endowed with knowledge and will should produce or  exhibit ideas is easily understood. But that a Being which is utterly  destitute of these faculties should be able to produce ideas, or in any  sort to affect an intelligence, this I can never understand. This I say,  though we had some positive conception of Matter, though we knew  its qualities, and could comprehend its existence, would yet be so far  from explaining things, that it is itself the most inexplicable thing in  the world. And yet, for all this, it will not follow that philosophers  have been doing nothing; for, by observing and reasoning upon the  connexion of ideas, they discover the laws and methods of nature, which  is a part of knowledge both useful and entertaining.    HYL.  After all, can it be supposed God would deceive all mankind? Do  you imagine He would have induced the whole world to believe the being of  Matter, if there was no such thing?    PHIL.  That every epidemical opinion, arising from prejudice, or  passion, or thoughtlessness, may be imputed to God, as the Author of it,  I believe you will not affirm. Whatsoever opinion we father on Him, it  must be either because He has discovered it to us by supernatural  revelation; or because it is so evident to our natural faculties, which  were framed and given us by God, that it is impossible we should withhold  our assent from it. But where is the revelation? or where is the evidence  that extorts the belief of Matter? Nay, how does it appear, that Matter,  TAKEN FOR SOMETHING DISTINCT FROM WHAT WE PERCEIVE BY OUR SENSES, is  thought to exist by all mankind; or indeed, by any except a few  philosophers, who do not know what they would be at? Your question  supposes these points are clear; and, when you have cleared them, I shall  think myself obliged to give you another answer. In the meantime, let it  suffice that I tell you, I do not suppose God has deceived mankind at  all.    HYL.  But the novelty, Philonous, the novelty! There lies the danger.  New notions should always be discountenanced; they unsettle men's minds,  and nobody knows where they will end.    PHIL.  Why the rejecting a notion that has no foundation, either in  sense, or in reason, or in Divine authority, should be thought to  unsettle the belief of such opinions as are grounded on all or any of  these, I cannot imagine. That innovations in government and religion are  dangerous, and ought to be discountenanced, I freely own. But is there  the like reason why they should be discouraged in philosophy? The making  anything known which was unknown before is an innovation in knowledge:  and, if all such innovations had been forbidden, men would have  made a notable progress in the arts and sciences. But it is none of my  business to plead for novelties and paradoxes. That the qualities we  perceive are not on the objects: that we must not believe our senses:  that we know nothing of the real nature of things, and can never be  assured even of their existence: that real colours and sounds are nothing  but certain unknown figures and motions: that motions are in themselves  neither swift nor slow: that there are in bodies absolute extensions,  without any particular magnitude or figure: that a thing stupid,  thoughtless, and inactive, operates on a spirit: that the least particle  of a body contains innumerable extended parts:--these are the novelties,  these are the strange notions which shock the genuine uncorrupted  judgment of all mankind; and being once admitted, embarrass the mind with  endless doubts and difficulties. And it is against these and the like  innovations I endeavour to vindicate Common Sense. It is true, in doing  this, I may perhaps be obliged to use some AMBAGES, and ways of speech  not common. But, if my notions are once thoroughly understood, that which  is most singular in them will, in effect, be found to amount to no more  than this.--that it is absolutely impossible, and a plain contradiction,  to suppose any unthinking Being should exist without being perceived by a  Mind. And, if this notion be singular, it is a shame it should be so, at  this time of day, and in a Christian country.    HYL.  As for the difficulties other opinions may be liable to, those  are out of the question. It is your business to defend your own opinion.  Can anything be plainer than that you are for changing all things into  ideas? You, I say, who are not ashamed to charge me WITH SCEPTICISM.  This is so plain, there is no denying it.    PHIL.  You mistake me. I am not for changing things into ideas, but  rather ideas into things; since those immediate objects of perception,  which, according to you, are only appearances of things, I take to be the  real things themselves.    HYL.  Things! You may pretend what you please; but it is certain you  leave us nothing but the empty forms of things, the outside only which  strikes the senses.    PHIL.  What you call the empty forms and outside of things seem to me  the very things themselves. Nor are they empty or incomplete, otherwise  than upon your supposition--that Matter is an essential part of all  corporeal things. We both, therefore, agree in this, that we perceive  only sensible forms: but herein we differ--you will have them to be empty  appearances, I, real beings. In short, you do not trust your senses, I  do.    HYL.  You say you believe your senses; and seem to applaud yourself that  in this you agree with the vulgar. According to you, therefore, the true  nature of a thing is discovered by the senses. If so, whence comes that  disagreement? Why is not the same figure, and other sensible qualities,  perceived all manner of ways? and why should we use a microscope the  better to discover the true nature of a body, if it were discoverable to  the naked eye?    PHIL.  Strictly speaking, Hylas, we do not see the same object that we  feel; neither is the same object perceived by the microscope which was by  the naked eye. But, in case every variation was thought sufficient to  constitute a new kind of individual, the endless number of confusion of  names would render language impracticable. Therefore, to avoid this, as  well as other inconveniences which are obvious upon a little thought, men  combine together several ideas, apprehended by divers senses, or by the  same sense at different times, or in different circumstances, but  observed, however, to have some connexion in nature, either with respect  to co-existence or succession; all which they refer to one name, and  consider as one thing. Hence it follows that when I examine, by my other  senses, a thing I have seen, it is not in order to understand better the  same object which I had perceived by sight, the object of one sense not  being perceived by the other senses. And, when I look through a  microscope, it is not that I may perceive more clearly what I perceived  already with my bare eyes; the object perceived by the glass being quite  different from the former. But, in both cases, my aim is only to know  what ideas are connected together; and the more a man knows of the  connexion of ideas, the more he is said to know of the nature of things.  What, therefore, if our ideas are variable; what if our senses are not in  all circumstances affected with the same appearances. It will not thence  follow they are not to be trusted; or that they are inconsistent either  with themselves or anything else: except it be with your preconceived  notion of (I know not what) one single, unchanged, unperceivable, real  Nature, marked by each name. Which prejudice seems to have taken its rise  from not rightly understanding the common language of men, speaking  of several distinct ideas as united into one thing by the mind. And,  indeed, there is cause to suspect several erroneous conceits of the  philosophers are owing to the same original: while they began to build  their schemes not so much on notions as on words, which were framed by  the vulgar, merely for conveniency and dispatch in the common actions of  life, without any regard to speculation.    HYL.  Methinks I apprehend your meaning.    PHIL.  It is your opinion the ideas we perceive by our senses are not  real things, but images or copies of them. Our knowledge, therefore, is  no farther real than as our ideas are the true REPRESENTATIONS OF THOSE  ORIGINALS. But, as these supposed originals are in themselves unknown,  it is impossible to know how far our ideas resemble them; or whether they  resemble them at all. We cannot, therefore, be sure we have any real  knowledge. Farther, as our ideas are perpetually varied, without any  change in the supposed real things, it necessarily follows they cannot  all be true copies of them: or, if some are and others are not, it is  impossible to distinguish the former from the latter. And this plunges us  yet deeper in uncertainty. Again, when we consider the point, we cannot  conceive how any idea, or anything like an idea, should have an absolute  existence out of a mind: nor consequently, according to you, how there  should be any real thing in nature. The result of all which is that we  are thrown into the most hopeless and abandoned scepticism. Now, give me  leave to ask you, First, Whether your referring ideas to certain  absolutely existing unperceived substances, as their originals, be not  the source of all this scepticism? Secondly, whether you are informed,  either by sense or reason, of the existence of those unknown originals?  And, in case you are not, whether it be not absurd to suppose them?  Thirdly, Whether, upon inquiry, you find there is anything distinctly  conceived or meant by the ABSOLUTE OR EXTERNAL EXISTENCE OF UNPERCEIVING  SUBSTANCES? Lastly, Whether, the premises considered, it be not the  wisest way to follow nature, trust your senses, and, laying aside all  anxious thought about unknown natures or substances, admit with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],[0,"Seven Little Australians (#17)"],[1,"children are down there picnicking, so we can be  sure of some tea.\"    \"Why, yes, that will be very nice,\" she said, \"won't it Bababsie,  won't it, sweet son?\"    She called to Martha, who was dusting the drawing-room in a cheerfully  blind way peculiarly hers.    \"The General's hat, please, Martha, the white sun-hat with strings;  it's on my bed, I think, or a chair or somewhere--oh! and bring  down my large one with the poppies in, as well, please.\"    Martha departed, and, after a little search, returned with the  headgear.    And Esther tied the white sun-hat over her own curly, crinkly hair,  and made the General crow with laughing from his seat on the hall  table.  And then she popped it on the Captain's head, and put the  cabbage-tree on her son's, and occupied several minutes thus in pretty  play.    Finally they were ready, and moved down the hall.    \"Master Bunty is locked in his room; on no account open the door,  Martha,\" was the Captain's last command.    \"Oh, Jack!\" Esther said reproachfully.    \"Oblige me by not interfering,\" he said; \"allow me a little  liberty with my own children, Esther.  He is an untruthful little  vagabond; I am ashamed to own him for my son.\"    And Esther, reflecting on the many shiftinesses of her stepson, was  able to console herself with the hope that it would do him good.    They went a shortcut through the bush to avoid the public road, and  the blue, sun-kissed, laughing river stretched before them.    \"There they are,\" Esther cried, \"in the old place, as usual, look  at the fire, little sweet son;  see the smoke, boy bonny--four--five  of them.  Why, who have they got with them?\" she said in surprise,  as they drew nearer the group on the grass.    Before they were close enough to recognize faces the circle suddenly  seemed to break up and fall apart.    One of its members turned sharply round and fled away across the  grass, plunging into the thick bracken and bush, and disappearing from  sight in less time than it takes to tell.    \"Whoever had you with you?\" Esther said when they reached the  children.    There was a half-second's silence, then Pip threw some sticks on the  fire and said coolly:    \"Only a friend of Meg's, a frightened kind of kid who has quite a  dread of the pater.  I believe she imagines soldiers go round with  their swords sharpened, ready for use.\"    He laughed lightly.  Nell joined in in a little hysterical way, and  Baby began to cry.    Meg, white as death, picked her up and hurriedly began telling her  the story of the three bears for comfort.    Esther looked a little puzzled, but, of course, never dreamt of  connecting the flying figure with Judy.    And the Captain seemed delightfully blind and unsuspicious.  He  lay down on the grass and let the General swarm all over him;  he  made jokes with Esther; he told several stories of his young days,  and never even seemed to remark that his audience seemed inattentive  and constrained.    \"Haven't you made some tea?\" Esther said at last.  \"We love  billy tea, and thought you would be sure to have some?\"    \"Bunty hasn't come, he was to have brought the billy,\" Pip said,  half sulkily.  He had suspicions that there was something behind this  great affability of his father, and he objected to being played  with.    \"Ah,\" the Captain said gravely, \"that is unfortunate.  When I came  away Bunty did not seem very well, and was thinking of spending  the rest of the day in his bedroom.\"    Pip made up the fire in a dogged way, and Meg flashed a frightened  glance at her father, who smiled affectionately back at her.    After an hour of this strained intercourse the Captain proposed a  return home.    \"It is growing chill,\" he said.  \"I should be grieved for the  General's new-born tooth to start its life by aching--let's go home  and make shift with teapot tea.\"    So they gathered up the untouched baskets and made themselves into a  procession.    The Captain insisted on Pip and Meg walking with him, and he sent  Baby and Nell on in front, one on either side of Esther, who was  alternately leading and carrying the General.    This arrangement being, as indeed Pip shrewdly suspected; to prevent  the possibility of any intercourse or formation of new plans.    And when they got home he invited them all to come into his  smoking-room, a little slit of a place off the dining-room.    Esther took the General upstairs, but the others followed him in  silence.    \"Sit down, Pip, my boy,\" he said genially.  \"Come, Meg, make yourself  at home, take a seat in that armchair.  Nell and Baby can occupy  the lounge.\"    They all sat down helplessly where he told them, and watched his  face anxiously.    He selected a pipe from the row over the mantelpiece, fitted a new  mouthpiece to it, and carefully filled it.    \"As you are all in possession of my room,\" he said in an urbane voice,  \"I can hardly smoke with any comfort here, I am afraid.  I will come  and talk to you again later on.  I am going to have a pipe first in  the old loft in the cow paddock.  Keep out of mischief till I come back.\"    He struck a match, lighted his tobacco, and, without a glance at the  silent children, left the room, locking the door behind him.    Once more he crossed the paddocks, and once more pushed open the  creaking door.  The orange peel lay just where he had seen it before,  only it was a little drier and more dead-looking.  The hair ribbon  was in exactly the same knot.  The ladder creaked in just the same  place, and again threatened to break his neck when he reached the top.  The dominoes were there still, the ham-bone and the pillow occupied  the same places; the only difference being the former had a black  covering of ants now, and a wind had been playing with the pillow,  and had carried the feathers in all directions.    He crossed the floor, not softly, but just with his usual measured  military-step.  Nothing moved.  He reached the partition and looked  over.    Judy lay across the improvised bed, sleeping a sleep of utter  exhaustion after her rapid flight from the river.  She had a frock of  Meg's on, that made her look surprisingly long and thin; he was  astonished to think she had grown so much.    \"There will be no end to my trouble with her as she grows older,\" he  said, half aloud, feeling extremely sorry for himself for being her  father.  Then a great anger and irritation rose within him as he  watched her sleeping so quietly there.  Was she always to be a disturber  of his peace?  Was she always to thwart him like this?    \"Judy,\" he said in a loud voice.    The closed eyelids sprang open, the mist of sleep and forgetfulness  cleared from the dark eyes, and she sprang up, a look of absolute  horror on her face.    \"What are you doing here, may I ask?\" he said, very coldly.    The scarlet colour flooded her cheeks, her very brow, and then  dropped down again, leaving her white to the lips, but she made no  answer.    \"You have run away from school, I suppose?\" he continued, in the  same unemotional voice.  \"Have you anything to say?\"    Judy did not speak or move, she only watched his face with parted  lips.    \"Have you anything to say for yourself, Helen?\" he repeated.    \"No, Father,\" she said.    Her face had a worn, strained look that might have touched him  at another time, but he was too angry to notice.    \"No excuse or reason at all?\"    \"No, Father.\"    He moved toward the opening.  \"A train goes in an hour and a half, you  will come straight back with me this moment,\" he said, in an even  voice.  \"I shall take precautions to have you watched at school since  you cannot be trusted.  You will not return home for the Christmas  holidays, and probably not for those of the following June.\"    It was as bad as a sentence of death.  The room swam before the girl's  eyes, there was a singing and rushing in her ears.    \"Come at once,\" the Captain said.  Judy gave a little caught breath;  it tickled her throat and she began to cough.    Such terrible coughing, a paroxysm that shook her thin frame and made  her gasp for breath.  It lasted two or three minutes, though she put  her handkerchief to her mouth to try to stop it.    She was very pale when it ceased, and he noticed the hollows in her  cheeks for the first time.    \"You had better come to the house first,\" he said, less harshly, \"and  see if Esther has any cough stuff.\"    Then in his turn he caught his breath and grew pale under his bronze.    For the handkerchief that the child had taken from her lips had  scarlet, horrible spots staining its whiteness.          CHAPTER XIV    The Squatter's Invitation      After all there was no dogcart for Judy, no mountain train, no  ignominious return to the midst of her schoolfellows, no vista of  weary months unmarked by holidays.    But instead, a warm, soft bed, and delicate food, and loving voices  and ceaseless attention.  For the violent exertion, the scanty food,  and the two nights in the open air had brought the girl to indeed a  perilous pass.  One lung was badly inflamed, the doctor said; it was  a mystery to him, he kept telling them, how she had kept up so long;  an ordinary girl would have given in and taken to her bed long ago.  But then he was not acquainted with the indomitable spirit and pluck  that were Judy's characteristics.    \"Didn't you have any pain?\" he asked, quite taken aback to find such  spirits and so serious a condition together.    \"H'm, in my side sometimes,\" she answered carelessly.  \"How long  will it be before I can get up, Doctor?\"  She used to ask the latter  question of him every morning, though, if the truth were known, she  felt secretly more than a little diffident at the idea of standing up  again.    There was a languor and weariness in her limbs that made her doubtful  if she could run about very much, and slower modes of progressing she  despised.  Besides this, there was a gnawing pain, under her arms,  and the cough was agony while it lasted.   "]]]
