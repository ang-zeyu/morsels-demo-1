The  vivacity of these images seemed to prove to me that my imaginations  were a reality. One would have said that a demon, against my will,  was inventing and breathing into me the most terrible fictions.  A conversation which dated a long time back, with the brother of  Troukhatchevsky, I remembered at that moment, in a sort of ecstasy, and  it tore my heart as I connected it with the musician and my wife. Yes,  it was very long ago. The brother of Troukhatchevsky, answering my  questions as to whether he frequented disreputable houses, said that a  respectable man does not go where he may contract a disease, in a low  and unclean spot, when one can find an honest woman. And here he, his  brother, the musician, had found the honest woman. 'It is true that she  is no longer in her early youth. She has lost a tooth on one side, and  her face is slightly bloated,' thought I for Troukhatchevsky. 'But what  is to be done? One must profit by what one has.'    \"'Yes, he is bound to take her for his mistress,' said I to myself  again; 'and besides, she is not dangerous.'    \"'No, it is not possible' I rejoined in fright. 'Nothing, nothing of the  kind has happened, and there is no reason to suppose there has. Did she  not tell me that the very idea that I could be jealous of her because of  him was humiliating to her?' 'Yes, but she lied,' I cried, and all began  over again.    \"There were only two travellers in my compartment: an old woman with her  husband, neither of them very talkative; and even they got out at one of  the stations, leaving me all alone. I was like a beast in a cage. Now I  jumped up and approached the window, now I began to walk back and forth,  staggering as if I hoped to make the train go faster by my efforts, and  the car with its seats and its windows trembled continually, as ours  does now.\"    And Posdnicheff rose abruptly, took a few steps, and sat down again.    \"Oh, I am afraid, I am afraid of railway carriages. Fear seizes me. I  sat down again, and I said to myself: 'I must think of something else.  For instance, of the inn keeper at whose house I took tea.' And then, in  my imagination arose the dvornik, with his long beard, and his grandson,  a little fellow of the same age as my little Basile. My little Basile!  My little Basile! He will see the musician kiss his mother! What  thoughts will pass through his poor soul! But what does that matter to  her! She loves.    \"And again it all began, the circle of the same thoughts. I suffered  so much that at last I did not know what to do with myself, and an idea  passed through my head that pleased me much,--to get out upon the rails,  throw myself under the cars, and thus finish everything. One thing  prevented me from doing so. It was pity! It was pity for myself, evoking  at the same time a hatred for her, for him, but not so much for him.  Toward him I felt a strange sentiment of my humiliation and his victory,  but toward her a terrible hatred.    \"'But I cannot kill myself and leave her free. She must suffer, she must  understand at least that I have suffered,' said I to myself.    \"At a station I saw people drinking at the lunch counter, and directly I  went to swallow a glass of vodki. Beside me stood a Jew, drinking also.  He began to talk to me, and I, in order not to be left alone in my  compartment, went with him into his third-class, dirty, full of smoke,  and covered with peelings and sunflower seeds. There I sat down beside  the Jew, and, as it seemed, he told many anecdotes.    \"First I listened to him, but I did not understand what he said. He  noticed it, and exacted my attention to his person. Then I rose and  entered my own compartment.    \"'I must consider,' said I to myself, 'whether what I think is true,  whether there is any reason to torment myself.' I sat down, wishing to  reflect quietly; but directly, instead of the peaceful reflections, the  same thing began again. Instead of the reasoning, the pictures.    \"'How many times have I tormented myself in this way,' I thought (I  recalled previous and similar fits of jealousy), 'and then seen it end  in nothing at all? It is the same now. Perhaps, yes, surely, I shall  find her quietly sleeping. She will awaken, she will be glad, and in her  words and looks I shall see that nothing has happened, that all this is  vain. Ah, if it would only so turn out!' 'But no, that has happened too  often! Now the end has come,' a voice said to me.    \"And again it all began. Ah, what torture! It is not to a hospital  filled with syphilitic patients that I would take a young man to deprive  him of the desire for women, but into my soul, to show him the demon  which tore it. The frightful part was that I recognized in myself an  indisputable right to the body of my wife, as if her body were entirely  mine. And at the same time I felt that I could not possess this body,  that it was not mine, that she could do with it as she liked, and that  she liked to do with it as I did not like. And I was powerless against  him and against her. He, like the Vanka of the song, would sing, before  mounting the gallows, how he would kiss her sweet lips, etc., and he  would even have the best of it before death. With her it was still  worse. If she HAD NOT DONE IT, she had the desire, she wished to do it,  and I knew that she did. That was worse yet. It would be better if she  had already done it, to relieve me of my uncertainty.    \"In short, I could not say what I desired. I desired that she might not  want what she MUST want. It was complete madness.\"        CHAPTER XXVI.    \"At the station before the last, when the conductor came to take the  tickets, I took my baggage and went out on the car platform, and  the consciousness that the climax was near at hand only added to my  agitation. I was cold, my jaw trembled so that my teeth chattered.  Mechanically I left the station with the crowd, I took a tchik, and I  started. I looked at the few people passing in the streets and at the  dvorniks. I read the signs, without thinking of anything. After going  half a verst my feet began to feel cold, and I remembered that in the  car I had taken off my woollen socks, and had put them in my travelling  bag. Where had I put the bag? Was it with me? Yes, and the basket?    \"I bethought myself that I had totally forgotten my baggage. I took out  my check, and then decided it was not worth while to return. I continued  on my way. In spite of all my efforts to remember, I cannot at this  moment make out why I was in such a hurry. I know only that I was  conscious that a serious and menacing event was approaching in my life.  It was a case of real auto-suggestion. Was it so serious because I  thought it so? Or had I a presentiment? I do not know. Perhaps, too,  after what has happened, all previous events have taken on a lugubrious  tint in my memory.    \"I arrived at the steps. It was an hour past midnight. A few isvotchiks  were before the door, awaiting customers, attracted by the lighted  windows (the lighted windows were those of our parlor and reception  room). Without trying to account for this late illumination, I went up  the steps, always with the same expectation of something terrible, and  I rang. The servant, a good, industrious, and very stupid being, named  Gregor, opened the door. The first thing that leaped to my eyes in the  hall, on the hat-stand, among other garments, was an overcoat. I ought  to have been astonished, but I was not astonished. I expected it.  'That's it!' I said to myself.    \"When I had asked Gregor who was there, and he had named  Troukhatchevsky, I inquired whether there were other visitors. He  answered: 'Nobody.' I remember the air with which he said that, with  a tone that was intended to give me pleasure, and dissipate my doubts.  'That's it! that's it!' I had the air of saying to myself. 'And the  children?'    \"'Thank God, they are very well. They went to sleep long ago.'    \"I scarcely breathed, and I could not keep my jaw from trembling.    \"Then it was not as I thought. I had often before returned home with the  thought that a misfortune had awaited me, but had been mistaken, and  everything was going on as usual. But now things were not going on as  usual. All that I had imagined, all that I believed to be chimeras, all  really existed. Here was the truth.    \"I was on the point of sobbing, but straightway the demon whispered in  my ear: 'Weep and be sentimental, and they will separate quietly, and  there will be no proofs, and all your life you will doubt and suffer.'  And pity for myself vanished, and there remained only the bestial need  of some adroit, cunning, and energetic action. I became a beast, an  intelligent beast.    \"'No, no,' said I to Gregor, who was about to announce my arrival. 'Do  this, take a carriage, and go at once for my baggage. Here is the check.  Start.'    \"He went along the hall to get his overcoat. Fearing lest he might  frighten them, I accompanied him to his little room, and waited for him  to put on his things. In the dining-room could be heard the sound of  conversation and the rattling of knives and plates. They were eating.  They had not heard the ring. 'Now if they only do not go out,' I  thought.    \"Gregor put on his fur-collared coat and went out. I closed the door  after him. I felt anxious when I was alone, thinking that directly I  should have to act. How? I did not yet know. I knew only that all was  ended, that there could be no doubt of his innocence, and that in an  instant my relations with her were going to be terminated. Before, I had  still doubts. I said to myself: 'Perhaps this is not true. Perhaps I am  mistaken.' Now all doubt had disappeared. All was decided irrevocably.  Secretly, all alone with him, at night! It is a violation of all duties!  Or, worse yet, she may make a show of that audacity, of that insolence  in crime, which, by its excess, tends to prove"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/690"],[0,"Proposed Roads to Freedom (#17)"],[1,"society has been reached. Is the painfulness of work  unavoidable?      [43] ``Overwork is repulsive to human nature--not work. Overwork  for supplying the few with luxury--not work for the well-  being of all. Work, labor, is a physiological necessity, a necessity  of spending accumulated bodily energy, a necessity which  is health and life itself. If so many branches of useful work are  so reluctantly done now, it is merely because they mean overwork,  or they are improperly organized. But we know--old  Franklin knew it--that four hours of useful work every day  would be more than sufficient for supplying everybody with the  comfort of a moderately well-to-do middle-class house, if we all  gave ourselves to productive work, and if we did not waste our  productive powers as we do waste them now. As to the childish  question, repeated for fifty years: `Who would do disagreeable  work?' frankly I regret that none of our savants has ever been  brought to do it, be it for only one day in his life. If there is  still work which is really disagreeable in itself, it is only  because our scientific men have never cared to consider the  means of rendering it less so: they have always known that there  were plenty of starving men who would do it for a few pence  a day.'' Kropotkin, ```Anarchist Communism.''      At present, the better paid work, that of the  business and professional classes, is for the most part  enjoyable. I do not mean that every separate  moment is agreeable, but that the life of a man who  has work of this sort is on the whole happier than  that of a man who enjoys an equal income without  doing any work. A certain amount of effort, and  something in the nature of a continuous career, are  necessary to vigorous men if they are to preserve  their mental health and their zest for life. A considerable  amount of work is done without pay. People  who take a rosy view of human nature might have  supposed that the duties of a magistrate would be  among disagreeable trades, like cleaning sewers; but  a cynic might contend that the pleasures of vindictiveness  and moral superiority are so great that there is  no difficulty in finding well-to-do elderly gentlemen  who are willing, without pay, to send helpless wretches  to the torture of prison. And apart from enjoyment  of the work itself, desire for the good opinion of  neighbors and for the feeling of effectiveness is quite  sufficient to keep many men active.    But, it will be said, the sort of work that a man  would voluntarily choose must always be exceptional:  the great bulk of necessary work can never be anything  but painful. Who would choose, if an easy life  were otherwise open to him, to be a coal-miner, or a  stoker on an Atlantic liner? I think it must be conceded  that much necessary work must always remain  disagreeable or at least painfully monotonous, and  that special privileges will have to be accorded to  those who undertake it, if the Anarchist system is ever  to be made workable. It is true that the introduction  of such special privileges would somewhat mar the  rounded logic of Anarchism, but it need not,  I think, make any really vital breach in its system.  Much of the work that needs doing could be rendered  agreeable, if thought and care were given  to this object. Even now it is often only long hours  that make work irksome. If the normal hours of  work were reduced to, say, four, as they could be by  better organization and more scientific methods, a  very great deal of work which is now felt as a burden  would quite cease to be so. If, as Kropotkin suggests,  agricultural work, instead of being the lifelong  drudgery of an ignorant laborer living very  near the verge of abject poverty, were the occasional  occupation of men and women normally employed in  industry or brain-work; if, instead of being conducted  by ancient traditional methods, without any  possibility of intelligent participation by the wage-  earner, it were alive with the search for new methods  and new inventions, filled with the spirit of freedom,  and inviting the mental as well as the physical cooperation  of those who do the work, it might become  a joy instead of a weariness, and a source of health  and life to those engaged in it.    What is true of agriculture is said by Anarchists  to be equally true of industry. They maintain  that if the great economic organizations which  are now managed by capitalists, without consideration  for the lives of the wage-earners beyond  what Trade Unions are able to exact, were turned  gradually into self-governing communities, in which  the producers could decide all questions of methods,  conditions, hours of work, and so forth, there would  be an almost boundless change for the better: grime  and noise might be nearly eliminated, the hideousness  of industrial regions might be turned into beauty, the  interest in the scientific aspects of production might  become diffused among all producers with any native  intelligence, and something of the artist's joy in creation  might inspire the whole of the work. All this,  which is at present utterly remote from the reality,  might be produced by economic self-government.  We may concede that by such means a very large  proportion of the necessary work of the world could  ultimately be made sufficiently agreeable to be preferred  before idleness even by men whose bare livelihood  would be assured whether they worked or not.  As to the residue let us admit that special rewards,  whether in goods or honors or privileges, would have  to be given to those who undertook it. But this need  not cause any fundamental objection.    There would, of course, be a certain proportion  of the population who would prefer idleness. Provided  the proportion were small, this need not matter.  And among those who would be classed as idlers  might be included artists, writers of books, men  devoted to abstract intellectual pursuits--in short,  all those whom society despises while they are alive  and honors when they are dead. To such men, the  possibility of pursuing their own work regardless  of any public recognition of its utility would be  invaluable. Whoever will observe how many of our  poets have been men of private means will realize how  much poetic capacity must have remained undeveloped  through poverty; for it would be absurd to  suppose that the rich are better endowed by nature  with the capacity for poetry. Freedom for such men,  few as they are, must be set against the waste of  the mere idlers.    So far, we have set forth the arguments in favor  of the Anarchist plan. They are, to my mind, sufficient  to make it seem possible that the plan might  succeed, but not sufficient to make it so probable that  it would be wise to try it.    The question of the feasibility of the Anarchist  proposals in regard to distribution is, like so many  other questions, a quantitative one. The Anarchist  proposals consist of two parts: (1) That all the common  commodities should be supplied ad lib. to all  applicants; (2) That no obligation to work, or economic  reward for work, should be imposed on anyone.  These two proposals are not necessarily inseparable,  nor does either entail the whole system of Anarchism,  though without them Anarchism would hardly be  possible. As regards the first of these proposals, it  can be carried out even now with regard to some  commodities, and it could be carried out in no very  distant future with regard to many more. It is a  flexible plan, since this or that article of consumption  could be placed on the free list or taken of as  circumstances might dictate. Its advantages are  many and various, and the practice of the world tends  to develop in this direction. I think we may conclude  that this part of the Anarchists' system might  well be adopted bit by bit, reaching gradually the  full extension that they desire.    But as regards the second proposal, that there  should be no obligation to work, and no economic  reward for work, the matter is much more doubtful.  Anarchists always assume that if their schemes were  put into operation practically everyone would work;  but although there is very much more to be said  for this view than most people would concede at first  sight, yet it is questionable whether there is enough  to be said to make it true for practical purposes.  Perhaps, in a community where industry had become  habitual through economic pressure, public opinion  might be sufficiently powerful to compel most men  to work;[44] but it is always doubtful how far such  a state of things would be permanent. If public  opinion is to be really effective, it will be necessary  to have some method of dividing the community into  small groups, and to allow each group to consume  only the equivalent of what it produces. This will  make the economic motive operative upon the group,  which, since we are supposing it small, will feel that  its collective share is appreciably diminished by each  idle individual. Such a system might be feasible, but  it would be contrary to the whole spirit of Anarchism  and would destroy the main lines of its economic  system.      [44] ``As to the so-often repeated objection that nobody would  labor if he were not compelled to do so by sheer necessity, we  heard enough of it before the emancipation of slaves in America,  as well as before the emancipation of serfs in Russia; and we  have had the opportunity of appreciating it at its just value.  So we shall not try to convince those who can be convinced only  by accomplished facts. As to those who reason, they ought to  know that, if it really was so with some parts of humanity at  its lowest stages--and yet, what do we know about it?--or if  it is so with some small communities, or separate individuals,  brought to sheer despair by ill-success in their struggle against  unfavorable conditions, it is not so with the bulk of the civilized  nations. With us,"]]]
