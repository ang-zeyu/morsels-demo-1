But  where the bright blossoms of the Virginia raspberry burst forth above  the roadside tangle and shady woodland dells, even those who despise  magenta see beauty in them where abundant green tones all discordant  notes into harmony. Purple, as we of to-day understand the color, the  flower is not; but rather the purple of ancient Orientals. On cool,  cloudy days the petals are a deep rose that fades into bluish pink when  the sun is hot.      Wild Roses    _Rosa_    Just as many members of the lily tribe show a preference for the rule of  three in the arrangements of their floral parts, so the wild roses cling  to the quinary method of some primitive ancestor, a favorite one also  with the buttercup and many of its kin, the geraniums, mallows, and  various others. Most of our fruit trees and bushes are near relatives of  the rose. Five petals and five sepals, then, we always find on roses in  a state of nature; and although the progressive gardener of to-day has  nowhere shown his skill more than in the development of a multitude of  petals from stamens in the magnificent roses of fashionable society, the  most highly cultivated darling of the greenhouses quickly reverts to the  original wild type, setting his work of years at naught, if once it  regain its natural liberties through neglect.    To protect its foliage from being eaten by hungry cattle, the rose goes  armed into the battle of life with curved, sharp prickles, not true  thorns or modified branches, but merely surface appliances which peel  off with the bark. To destroy crawling pilferers of pollen, several  species coat their calices, at least, with fine hairs or sticky gum; and  to insure wide distribution of offspring, the seeds are packed in the  attractive, bright red calyx tube or hip, a favorite food of many birds,  which drop them miles away.    In literature, ancient and modern, sacred and profane, no flower figures  so conspicuously as the rose. To the Romans it was most significant when  placed over the door of a public or private banquet hall. Each who  passed beneath it bound himself thereby not to disclose anything said or  done within; hence the expression _sub rosa_, common to this day.    The Smoother, Early, or Meadow Rose (_R. blanda_), found blooming in  June and July in moist, rocky places from Newfoundland to New Jersey and  a thousand miles westward, has slightly fragrant flowers, at first pink,  later pure white. Their styles are separate, not cohering in a column  nor projecting as in the climbing rose. This is a leafy, low bush mostly  less than three feet high; it is either entirely unarmed, or else  provided with only a few weak prickles; the stipules are rather broad,  and the leaf is compounded of from five to seven oval, blunt, and pale  green leaflets, often hoary below.           *       *       *       *       *    In swamps and low, wet ground from Quebec to Florida and westward to the  Mississippi, the Swamp Rose (_R. carolina_) blooms late in May and on to  midsummer. The bush may grow taller than a man, or perhaps only a foot  high. It is armed with stout, hooked, rather distant prickles, and few  or no bristles. The leaflets, from five to nine, but usually seven, to a  leaf, are smooth, pale, or perhaps hairy beneath to protect the pores  from filling with moisture arising from the wet ground. Long, sharp  calyx lobes, which drop off before the cup swells in fruit into a round,  glandular, hairy red hip, are conspicuous among the clustered pink  flowers and buds.    How fragrant are the pages of Chaucer, Spenser, and Shakespeare with the  Eglantine! This delicious plant, known here as Sweetbrier (_R.  rubiginosa_), emits its very aromatic odor from russet glands on the  under, downy side of the small leaflets, always a certain means of  identification. From eastern Canada to Virginia and Tennessee the plant  has happily escaped from man's gardens back to Nature's.    In spite of its American Indian name, the lovely white Cherokee Rose  (_R. Sinica_), that runs wild in the South, climbing, rambling, and  rioting with a truly Oriental abandon and luxuriance, did indeed come  from China. Would that our northern thickets and roadsides might be  decked with its pure flowers and almost equally beautiful dark, glossy,  evergreen leaves!          PULSE FAMILY _(Leguminosae)_      Wild or American Senna    _Cassia marylandica_    _Flowers_--Yellow, about 3/4 in. broad, numerous, in short axillary  clusters on the upper part of plant. Calyx of 5 oblong lobes; 5 petals,  3 forming an upper lip, 2 a lower one; 10 stamens of 3 different kinds;  1 pistil. _Stem:_ 3 to 8 ft. high, little branched. _Leaves:_  Alternately pinnately compounded of 6 to 10 pairs of oblong leaflets.  _Fruit:_ A narrow, flat curving pod, 3 to 4 in. long.    _Preferred Habitat_--Alluvial or moist, rich soil, swamps, roadsides.    _Flowering Season_--July-August.    _Distribution_--New England, westward to Nebraska, south to the  Gulf States.    Whoever has seen certain Long Island roadsides bordered with wild  senna, the brilliant flower clusters contrasted with the deep green of  the beautiful foliage, knows that no effect produced by art along the  drives of public park or private garden can match these country lanes  in simple charm.    While leaves of certain African and East Indian species of senna are  most valued for their medicinal properties, those of this plant are  largely collected in the Middle and Southern states as a substitute.  Caterpillars of several sulphur butterflies, which live exclusively on  cassia foliage, appear to feel no evil effects from overdoses.      Wild Indigo; Yellow or Indigo Broom; Horsefly Weed    _Baptisia tinctoria_    _Flowers_--Bright yellow, papilionaceous, about 1/2 in. long, on short  pedicels, in numerous but few flowered terminal racemes. Calyx light  green, 4 or 5-toothed; corolla of 5 oblong petals, the standard erect,  the keel enclosing 10 incurved stamens and 1 pistil. _Stem:_ Smooth,  branched, 2 to 4 ft. high. _Leaves:_ Compounded of 3 ovate leaflets.  _Fruit:_ A many-seeded round or egg-shaped pod tipped with the  awl-shaped style.    _Preferred Habitat_--Dry, sandy soil.    _Flowering Season_--June-September.    _Distribution_--Maine and Minnesota to the Gulf states.    Dark grayish green, clover-like leaves, and small, bright yellow flowers  growing in loose clusters at the ends of the branches of a bushy little  plant, are so commonly met with they need little description. A  relative, the true indigo-bearer, a native of Asia, once commonly grown  in the Southern states when slavery made competition with Oriental labor  possible, has locally escaped and become naturalized. But the false  species, although, as Doctor Gray says, it yields \"a poor sort of  indigo,\" yields a most valuable medicine employed by the homoeopathists  in malarial fevers. The plant turns black in drying. As in the case of  other papilionaceous blossoms, bees are the visitors best adapted to  fertilize the flowers. When we see the little, sleepy, dusky-winged  butterfly (_Thanaos brizo_) around the plant we may know she is there  only to lay eggs, that the larvae and caterpillars may find their  favorite food at hand on waking into life.      Wild Lupine; Old Maid's Bonnets; Wild Pea; Sun Dial    _Lupinus perennis_    _Flowers_--Vivid blue, very rarely pink or white, butterfly-shaped;  corolla consisting of standard, wings, and keel; about 1/2 in. long,  borne in a long raceme at end of stem; calyx 2-lipped, deeply toothed.  _Stem:_ Erect, branching, leafy, 1 to 2 ft. high. _Leaves:_ Palmate,  compounded of from 7 to 11 (usually 8) leaflets. _Fruit:_ A broad,  flat, very hairy pod, 1-1/2 in. long, and containing 4 or 5 seeds.    _Preferred Habitat_--Dry, sandy places, banks, and hillsides.    _Flowering Season_--May-June.    _Distribution_--United States east of Mississippi, and eastern Canada.    Farmers once thought that this plant preyed upon the fertility of their  soil, as we see in the derivation of its name, from _lupus_, a wolf;  whereas the lupine contents itself with sterile waste land no one should  grudge it--steep, gravelly banks, railroad tracks, exposed sunny hills,  where even it must often burn out under fierce sunshine did not its root  penetrate to surprising depths. It spreads far and wide in thrifty  colonies, reflecting the vivid color of June skies, until, as Thoreau  says, \"the earth is blued with it.\"    The lupine is another of those interesting plants which go to sleep at  night. Some members of the genus erect one half of the leaf and droop  the other half until it becomes a vertical instead of the horizontal  star it is by day. Frequently the leaflets rotate as much as 90 degrees  on their own axes. Some lupines fold their leaflets, not at night only,  but during the day also there is more or less movement in the leaves.  Sun dial, a popular name for the wild lupine, has reference to this  peculiarity. The leaf of our species shuts downward around its stem  umbrella fashion, or the leaflets are erected to prevent the chilling  which comes to horizontal surfaces by radiation, some scientists think.  \"That the sleep movements of leaves are in some manner of high  importance to the plants which exhibit them,\" says Darwin, \"few will  dispute who have observed how complex they sometimes are.\"      Common Red, Purple, Meadow, or Honeysuckle Clover    _Trifolium pratense_    _Flowers_--Magenta, pink, or rarely whitish, sweet-scented, the tubular  corollas set in dense round, oval, or egg-shaped heads about 1 in. long,  and seated in a sparingly hairy calyx. _Stem:_ 6 in. to 2 ft. high,  branching, reclining, or erect, more or less hairy. _Leaves:_ On long  petioles, commonly compounded of 3, but sometimes of 4 to 11 oval or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8909"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 1 (#17)"],[1," those organs themselves. He did not  sufficiently understand, that the primitive cause which makes a stone  fall, or his arm move, are perhaps as difficult of comprehension,  as arduous to be explained, as those internal impulses, of which his  thought or his will are the effects. Thus, for want of meditating  Nature--of considering her under her true point of view--of remarking  the conformity--of noticing the simultaneity, the unity of the motion  of this fancied motive-power with that of his body--of his material  organs--he conjectured he was not only a distinct being, but that he was  set apart, with different energies, from all the other beings in Nature;  that he was of a more simple essence having nothing in common with any  thing by which he was surrounded; nothing that connected him with all  that he beheld.    It is from thence has successively sprung his notions of SPIRITUALITY,  IMMATERIALITY, IMMORTALITY; in short, all those vague unmeaning words  he has invented by degrees, in order to subtilize and designate the  attributes of the unknown power, which he believes he contains within  himself; which he conjectures to be the concealed principle of all his  visible actions when man once imbibes an idea that he cannot comprehend,  he meditates upon it until he has given it a complete personification:  Thus he saw, or fancied he saw, the igneous matter pervade every thing;  he conjectured that it was the only principle of life and activity; he  proceeded to embody it; he gave it his own form; called it JUPITER, and  ended by worshipping this image of his own creation, as the power from  whom he derived every good he experienced, every evil he sustained.  To crown the bold conjectures he ventured to make on this internal  motive-power, he supposed, that different from all other beings, even  from the body that served to envelope it, it was not bound to undergo  dissolution; that such was its perfect simplicity, that it could not  be decomposed, nor even change its form; in short, that it was by  its essence exempted from those revolutions to which he saw the body  subjected, as well as all the compound beings with which Nature is  filled.    Thus man, in his own ideas, became double; he looked upon himself as a  whole, composed by the inconceivable assemblage of two different, two  distinct natures, which have no point of analogy between themselves: he  distinguished two substances in himself; one evidently submitted to  the influence of gross beings, composed of coarse inert matter: this  he called BODY;--the other, which he supposed to be simple, of a purer  essence, was contemplated as acting from itself: giving motion to the  body, with which it found itself so miraculously united: this he called  SOUL, or SPIRIT; the functions of the one, he denominated _physical,  corporeal, material_; the functions of the other he styled _spiritual,  intellectual._ Man, considered relatively to the first, was termed the  PHYSICAL MAN; viewed with relation to the last, he was designated the  MORAL MAN. These distinctions, although adopted by the greater number of  the philosophers of the present day, are, nevertheless, only founded  on gratuitous suppositions. Man has always believed he remedied his  ignorance of things, by inventing words to which he could never attach  any true sense or meaning. He imagined he understood matter, its  properties, its faculties, its resources, its different combinations,  because he had a superficial glimpse of some of its qualities: he has,  however, in reality, done nothing more than obscure the faint ideas he  has been capacitated to form of this matter, by associating it with a  substance much less intelligible than itself. It is thus, speculative  man, in forming words, in multiplying beings, has only plunged himself  into greater difficulties than those he endeavoured to avoid; and  thereby placed obstacles to the progress of his knowledge: whenever he  has been deficient of facts, he has had recourse to conjecture, which he  quickly changed into fancied realities. Thus, his imagination, no longer  guided by experience, hurried on by his new ideas, was lost, without  hope of return, in the labyrinth of an ideal, of an intellectual world,  to which he had himself given birth; it was next to impossible to  withdraw him from this delusion, to place him in the right road, of  which nothing but experience can furnish him the clue. Nature points out  to man, that in himself, as well as in all those objects which act upon  him, there is never more than matter endowed with various properties,  diversely modified, that acts by reason of these properties: that man is  an organized whole, composed of a variety of matter; that like all the  other productions of Nature, he follows general and known laws, as  well as those laws or modes of action which are peculiar to himself and  unknown.    Thus, when it shall be inquired, what is man?    We say, he is a material being, organized after a peculiar manner;  conformed to a certain mode of thinking--of feeling; capable  of modification in certain modes peculiar to himself--to his  organization--to that particular combination of matter which is found  assembled in him.    If, again, it be asked, what origin we give to beings of the human  species?    We reply, that, like all other beings, man is a production of Nature,  who resembles them in some respects, and finds himself submitted to  the same laws; who differs from them in other respects, and follows  particular laws, determined by the diversity of his conformation.    If, then, it be demanded, whence came man?    We answer, our experience on this head does not capacitate us to resolve  the question: but that it cannot interest us, as it suffices for us to  know that man exists; that he is so constituted, as to be competent to  the effects we witness.    But it will be urged, has man always existed? Has the human species  existed from all eternity; or is it only an instantaneous production of  Nature? Have there been always men like ourselves? Will there always  be such? Have there been, in all times, males and females? Was there a  first man, from whom all others are descended? Was the animal anterior  to the egg, or did the egg precede the animal? Is this species without  beginning? Will it also be without end? The species itself, is it  indestructible, or does it pass away like its individuals? Has man  always been what he now is; or has he, before he arrived at the state in  which we see him, been obliged to pass under an infinity of successive  developements? Can man at last flatter himself with having arrived at  a fixed being, or must the human species again change? If man is the  production of Nature, it will perhaps be asked, Is this Nature competent  to the production of new beings, to make the old species disappear?  Adopting this supposition, it may be inquired, why Nature does not  produce under our own eyes new beings--new species?    It would appear on reviewing these questions, to be perfectly  indifferent, as to the stability of the argument we have used, which  side was taken; that, for want of experience, hypothesis must settle a  curiosity that always endeavours to spring forward beyond the boundaries  prescribed to our mind. This granted, the contemplator of Nature will  say, that he sees no contradiction, in supposing the human species, such  as it is at the present day, was either produced in the course of time,  or from all eternity: he will not perceive any advantage that can arise  from supposing that it has arrived by different stages, or successive  developements, to that state in which it is actually found. Matter is  eternal, it is necessary, but its forms are evanescent and contingent.  It may be asked of man, is he any thing more than matter combined, of  which the former varies every instant?    Notwithstanding, some reflections seem to favor the supposition, to  render more probable the hypothesis, that man is a production formed in  the course of time; who is peculiar to the globe he inhabits, who is the  result of the peculiar laws by which it is directed; who, consequently,  can only date his formation as coeval with that of his planet. Existence  is essential to the universe, or the total assemblage of matter  essentially varied that presents itself to our contemplation; the  combinations, the forms, however, are not essential. This granted,  although the matter of which the earth is composed has always existed,  this earth may not always have had its present form--its actual  properties; perhaps it may be a mass detached in the course of time from  some other celestial body;--perhaps it is the result of the spots, or  those encrustations which astronomers discover in the sun's disk,  which have had the faculty to diffuse themselves over our planetary  system;--perhaps the sphere we inhabit may be an extinguished or a  displaced comet, which heretofore occupied some other place in the  regions of space;--which, consequently, was then competent to produce  beings very different from those we now behold spread over its surface;  seeing that its then position, its nature, must have rendered its  productions different from those which at this day it offers to our  view.    Whatever may be the supposition adopted, plants, animals, men, can only  be regarded as productions inherent in and natural to our globe, in the  position and in the circumstances in which it is actually found: these  productions it would be reasonable to infer would be changed, if this  globe by any revolution should happen to shift its situation. What  appears to strengthen this hypothesis, is, that on our ball itself, all  the productions vary, by reason of its different climates: men, animals,  vegetables, minerals, are not the same on every part of it: they vary  sometimes in a very sensible manner, at very inconsiderable distances.
