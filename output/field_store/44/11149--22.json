[46] Casques (_cassis_) are of metal; helmets (_galea_) of  leather--_Isidorus_.    [46] This mode of fighting is admirably described by Caesar. \"The  Germans engaged after the following manner:--There were 6,000 horse, and  an equal number of the swiftest and bravest foot; who were chosen,  man by man, by the cavalry, for their protection. By these they were  attended in battle; to these they retreated; and, these, if they were  hard pressed, joined them in the combat. If any fell wounded from their  horses, by these they were covered. If it were necessary to advance or  retreat to any considerable distance, such agility had they acquired by  exercise, that, supporting themselves by the horses' manes, they kept  pace with them.\"--Bell. Gall. i. 48.    [47] To understand this, it is to be remarked, that the Germans were  divided into nations or tribes,--these into cantons, and these into  districts or townships. The cantons (_pagi_ in Latin) were called by  themselves _gauen_. The districts or townships (_vici_) were called  _hunderte_, whence the English hundreds. The name given to these select  youth, according to the learned Dithmar, was _die hunderte_, hundred  men. From the following passage in Caesar, it appears that in the more  powerful tribes a greater number was selected from each canton. \"The  nation of the Suevi is by far the greatest and most warlike of the  Germans. They are said to inhabit a hundred cantons; from each of  which a thousand men are sent annually to make war out of their own  territories. Thus neither the employments of agriculture, nor the use of  arms are interrupted.\"--Bell. Gall. iv. 1. The warriors were summoned  by the _heribannum_, or army-edict; whence is derived the French  arriere-ban.    [48] A wedge is described by Vegetius (iii. 19,) as a body of infantry,  narrow in front, and widening towards the rear; by which disposition  they were enabled to break the enemy's ranks, as all their weapons were  directed to one spot. The soldiers called it a boar's head.    [49] It was also considered as the height of injury to charge a person  with this unjustly. Thus, by the _Salic_ law, tit. xxxiii, 5, a fine  of 600 denarii (about 9_l._) is imposed upon \"every free man who shall  accuse another of throwing down his shield, and running away, without  being able to prove it.\"    [50] Vertot (Mem. de l'Acad. des Inscrip.) supposes that the French  _maires du palais_ had their origin from these German military leaders.  If the kings were equally conspicuous for valor as for birth, they  united the regal with the military command. Usually, however, several  kings and generals were assembled in their wars. In this case, the most  eminent commanded, and obtained a common jurisdiction in war, which did  not subsist in time of peace. Thus Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi.) says, \"In  peace they have no common magistracy.\" A general was elected by placing  him on a shield, and lifting him on the shoulders of the bystanders. The  same ceremonial was observed in the election of kings.    [51] Hence Ambiorix, king of the Eburones, declare that \"the nature of  his authority was such, that the people had no less power over him, than  he over the people.\"--Caesar, Bell. Gall. v. The authority of the North  American chiefs almost exactly similar.    [52] The power of life and death, however, was in the hands of  magistrates. Thus Caesar: \"When a state engages either in an offensive  or defensive war, magistrates are chosen to preside over it, and  exercise power of life and death.\"--Bell. Gall. vi. The infliction of  punishments was committed to the priests, in order to give them more  solemnity, and render them less invidious.    [53] _Effigiesque et signa quaedam_. That effigies does not mean the  images of their deities is proved by that is stated at chap. ix., viz.  that they deemed it derogatory to their deities to represent them in  human form; and, if in human form, we may argue, _a fortiori_, in the  form of the lower animals. The interpretation of the passage will be  best derived from Hist. iv. 22, where Tacitus says:--\"Depromptae silvis  lucisve ferarum imagines, ut cuique genti inire praelium mos est.\" It  would hence appear that these effigies and signa were images of wild  animals, and were national standards preserved with religious care in  sacred woods and groves, whence they were brought forth when the clan or  tribe was about to take the field.--_White_.    [54] They not only interposed to prevent the flight of their husbands  and sons, but, in desperate emergencies, themselves engaged in battle.  This happened on Marius's defeat of the Cimbri (hereafter to be  mentioned); and Dio relates, that when Marcus Aurelius overthrew the  Marcomanni, Quadi, and other German allies, the bodies of women in armor  were found among the slain.    [55] Thus, in the army of Ariovistus, the women, with their hair  dishevelled, and weeping, besought the soldiers not to deliver them  captives to the Romans.--Caesar, Bell. Gall. i.    [56] Relative to this, perhaps, is a circumstance mentioned by Suetonius  in his Life of Augustus. \"From some nations he attempted to exact a new  kind of hostages, women: because he observed that those of the male sex  were disregarded.\"--Aug. xxi.    [57] See the same observation with regard to the Celtic women, in  Plutarch, on the virtues of women. The North Americans pay a similar  regard to their females.    [58] A remarkable instance of this is given by Caesar. \"When he inquired  of the captives the reason why Ariovistus did not engage, he learned,  that it was because the matrons, who among the Germans are accustomed  to pronounce, from their divinations, whether or not a battle will be  favorable, had declared that they would not prove victorious, if they  should fight before the new moon.\"--Bell. Gall. i. The cruel manner in  which the Cimbrian women performed their divinations is thus related  by Strabo: \"The women who follow the Cimbri to war, are accompanied  by gray-haired prophetesses, in white vestments, with canvas mantles  fastened by clasps, a brazen girdle, and naked feet. These go with drawn  swords through the camp, and, striking down those of the prisoners that  they meet, drag them to a brazen kettle, holding about twenty amphorae.  This has a kind of stage above it, ascending on which, the priestess  cuts the throat of the victim, and, from the manner in which the blood  flows into the vessel, judges of the future event. Others tear open  the bodies of the captives thus butchered, and, from inspection of the  entrails, presage victory to their own party.\"--Lib. vii.    [59] She was afterwards taken prisoner by Rutilius Gallicus. Statius, in  his Sylvae, i. 4, refers to this event. Tacitus has more concerning her  in his History, iv. 61.    [60] Viradesthis was a goddess of the Tungri; Harimella, another  provincial deity; whose names were found by Mr. Pennant inscribed on  altars at the Roman station at Burrens. These were erected by the German  auxiliaries.--Vide Tour in Scotland, 1772, part ii. p. 406.    [61] Ritter considers that here is a reference to the servile flattery  of the senate as exhibited in the time of Nero, by the deification of  Poppaea's infant daughter, and afterwards of herself. (See Ann. xv.  23, Dion. lxiii, Ann. xiv. 3.) There is no contradiction in the present  passage to that found at Hist. iv. 61, where Tacitus says, \"plerasque  feminarum fatidicas et, augescente superstitione, arbitrantur deas;\"  _i.e._ they deem (_arbitrantur_) very many of their women possessed of  prophetic powers, and, as their religious feeling increases, they deem  (_arbitrantur_) them goddesses, _i.e._ possessed of a superhuman nature;  they do not, however, make them goddesses and worship them, as the  Romans did Poppaea and her infant, which is covertly implied in  _facerent deas_.--_White_.    [62] Mercury, _i.e._ a god whom Tacitus thus names, because his  attributes resembled those of the Roman Mercury. According to Paulus  Diaconus (de Gestis Langobardorum, i. 9), this deity was Wodun, or  Gwodan, called also Odin. Mallet (North. Ant. ch. v.) says, that in  the Icelandic mythology he is called \"the terrible and severe God, the  Father of Slaughter, he who giveth victory and receiveth courage in  the conflict, who nameth those that are to be slain.\" \"The Germans drew  their gods by their own character, who loved nothing so much themselves  as to display their strength and power in battle, and to signalize their  vengeance upon their enemies by slaughter and desolation.\" There remain  to this day some traces of the worship paid to Odin in the name given by  almost all the people of the north to the fourth day of the week, which  was formerly consecrated to him. It is called by a name which signifies  \"Odin's day;\" \"Old Norse, _Odinsdagr_; Swedish and Danish, _Onsdag_;  Anglo-Saxon, _Wodenesdaeg_, _Wodnesdaeg_; Dutch, _Woensdag_; English,  Wednesday. As Odin or Wodun was supposed to correspond to the Mercury of  the Greeks and Romans, the name of this day was expressed in Latin _Dies  Mercurii_.\"--_White_.    [63] \"The appointed time for these sacrifices,\" says Mallet (North. Ant.  ch. vi.), \"was always determined by a superstitious opinion which  made the northern nations regard the number 'three' as sacred and  particularly dear to the gods. Thus, in every ninth month they renewed  the bloody ceremony, which was to last nine days, and every day they  offered up nine living victims, whether men or animals. But the most  solemn sacrifices were those which were offered up at Upsal in Sweden  every ninth year....\" After stating the compulsory nature of the  attendance at this festival, Mallet adds, \"Then they chose among the  captives in time of war, and among the slaves in time of peace, nine  persons to be sacrificed. In whatever manner they immolated men, the  priest always took care in consecrating the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/754"],[0,"The Story of Mankind (#17)"],[1,"to  him as the Chief, the Imperator or Emperor. The Republic had become an  Empire, but the average Roman was hardly aware of the fact.    In 14 A.D. his position as the Absolute Ruler of the Roman people had  become so well established that he was made an object of that divine  worship which hitherto had been reserved for the Gods. And his  successors were true \"Emperors\"--the absolute rulers of the greatest  empire the world had ever seen.    If the truth be told, the average citizen was sick and tired of anarchy  and disorder. He did not care who ruled him provided the new master gave  him a chance to live quietly and without the noise of eternal street  riots. Octavian assured his subjects forty years of peace. He had no  desire to extend the frontiers of his domains, In the year 9 A.D. he  had contem-plated an invasion of the northwestern wilderness which was  inhabited by the Teutons. But Varrus, his general, had been killed with  all his men in the Teutoburg Woods, and after that the Romans made no  further attempts to civilise these wild people.    They concentrated their efforts upon the gigantic problem of internal  reform. But it was too late to do much good. Two centuries of revolution  and foreign war had repeatedly killed the best men among the younger  generations. It had ruined the class of the free farmers. It had  introduced slave labor, against which no freeman could hope to compete.  It had turned the cities into beehives inhabited by pauperized  and unhealthy mobs of runaway peasants. It had created a large  bureaucracy--petty officials who were underpaid and who were forced to  take graft in order to buy bread and clothing for their families.  Worst of all, it had accustomed people to violence, to blood-shed, to a  barbarous pleasure in the pain and suffering of others.    Outwardly, the Roman state during the first century of our era was a  magnificent political structure, so large that Alexander's empire became  one of its minor provinces. Underneath this glory there lived millions  upon millions of poor and tired human beings, toiling like ants who have  built a nest underneath a heavy stone. They worked for the benefit of  some one else. They shared their food with the animals of the fields.  They lived in stables. They died without hope.    It was the seven hundred and fifty-third year since the founding of  Rome. Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus was living in the palace  of the Palatine Hill, busily engaged upon the task of ruling his empire.    In a little village of distant Syria, Mary, the wife of Joseph the  Carpenter, was tending her little boy, born in a stable of Bethlehem.    This is a strange world.    Before long, the palace and the stable were to meet in open combat.    And the stable was to emerge victorious.          JOSHUA OF NAZARETH    THE STORY OF JOSHUA OF NAZARETH, WHOM THE GREEKS CALLED JESUS      IN the autumn of the year of the city 783 (which would be 62 A.D., in  our way of counting time) AEsculapius Cultellus, a Roman physician,  wrote to his nephew who was with the army in Syria as follows:      My dear Nephew,    A few days ago I was called in to prescribe for a sick man named Paul.  He appeared to be a Roman citizen of Jewish parentage, well educated  and of agreeable manners. I had been told that he was here in connection  with a law-suit, an appeal from one of our provincial courts, Caesarea  or some such place in the eastern Mediterranean. He had been described  to me as a \"wild and violent\" fellow who had been making speeches  against the People and against the Law. I found him very intelligent and  of great honesty.    A friend of mine who used to be with the army in Asia Minor tells me  that he heard something about him in Ephesus where he was preaching  sermons about a strange new God. I asked my patient if this were true  and whether he had told the people to rebel against the will of our  beloved Emperor. Paul answered me that the Kingdom of which he had  spoken was not of this world and he added many strange utterances which  I did not understand, but which were probably due to his fever.    His personality made a great impression upon me and I was sorry to hear  that he was killed on the Ostian Road a few days ago. Therefore I am  writing this letter to you. When next you visit Jerusalem, I want you to  find out something about my friend Paul and the strange Jewish prophet,  who seems to have been his teacher. Our slaves are getting much excited  about this so-called Messiah, and a few of them, who openly talked of  the new kingdom (whatever that means) have been crucified. I would like  to know the truth about all these rumours and I am                                  Your devoted Uncle,                                     AESCULAPIUS CULTELLUS.      Six weeks later, Gladius Ensa, the nephew, a captain of the VII Gallic  Infantry, answered as follows:      My dear Uncle,    I received your letter and I have obeyed your instructions.    Two weeks ago our brigade was sent to Jerusalem. There have been several  revolutions during the last century and there is not much left of the  old city. We have been here now for a month and to-morrow we shall  continue our march to Petra, where there has been trouble with some of  the Arab tribes. I shall use this evening to answer your questions, but  pray do not expect a detailed report.    I have talked with most of the older men in this city but few have been  able to give me any definite information. A few days ago a pedler came  to the camp. I bought some of his olives and I asked him whether he had  ever heard of the famous Messiah who was killed when he was young. He  said that he remembered it very clearly, because his father had taken  him to Golgotha (a hill just outside the city) to see the execution,  and to show him what became of the enemies of the laws of the people of  Judaea. He gave me the address of one Joseph, who had been a personal  friend of the Messiah and told me that I had better go and see him if I  wanted to know more.    This morning I went to call on Joseph. He was quite an old man. He had  been a fisherman on one of the fresh-water lakes. His memory was  clear, and from him at last I got a fairly definite account of what had  happened during the troublesome days before I was born.    Tiberius, our great and glorious emperor, was on the throne, and an  officer of the name of Pontius Pilatus was governor of Judaea and  Samaria. Joseph knew little about this Pilatus. He seemed to have been  an honest enough official who left a decent reputation as procurator of  the province. In the year 755 or 756 (Joseph had forgotten when) Pilatus  was called to Jerusalem on account of a riot. A certain young man (the  son of a carpenter of Nazareth) was said to be planning a revolution  against the Roman government. Strangely enough our own intelligence  officers, who are usually well informed, appear to have heard nothing  about it, and when they investigated the matter they reported that  the carpenter was an excellent citizen and that there was no reason to  proceed against him. But the old-fashioned leaders of the Jewish  faith, according to Joseph, were much upset. They greatly disliked his  popularity with the masses of the poorer Hebrews. The \"Nazarene\" (so  they told Pilatus) had publicly claimed that a Greek or a Roman or even  a Philistine, who tried to live a decent and honourable life, was quite  as good as a Jew who spent his days studying the ancient laws of Moses.  Pilatus does not seem to have been impressed by this argument, but when  the crowds around the temple threatened to lynch Jesus, and kill all  his followers, he decided to take the carpenter into custody to save his  life.    He does not appear to have understood the real nature of the quarrel.  Whenever he asked the Jewish priests to explain their grievances, they  shouted \"heresy\" and \"treason\" and got terribly excited. Finally,  so Joseph told me, Pilatus sent for Joshua (that was the name of the  Nazarene, but the Greeks who live in this part of the world always refer  to him as Jesus) to examine him personally. He talked to him for several  hours. He asked him about the \"dangerous doctrines\" which he was said  to have preached on the shores of the sea of Galilee. But Jesus answered  that he never referred to politics. He was not so much interested in  the bodies of men as in Man's soul. He wanted all people to regard their  neighbours as their brothers and to love one single God, who was the  father of all living beings.    Pilatus, who seems to have been well versed in the doctrines of the  Stoics and the other Greek philosophers, does not appear to have  discovered anything seditious in the talk of Jesus. According to  my informant he made another attempt to save the life of the kindly  prophet. He kept putting the execution off. Meanwhile the Jewish people,  lashed into fury by their priests, got frantic with rage. There had  been many riots in Jerusalem before this and there were only a few Roman  soldiers within calling distance. Reports were being sent to the  Roman authorities in Caesarea that Pilatus had \"fallen a victim to the  teachings of the Nazarene.\" Petitions were being circulated all through  the city to have Pilatus recalled, because he was an enemy of the  Emperor. You know that our governors have strict instructions to avoid  an open break with their foreign subjects. To save the country from  civil war, Pilatus finally sacrificed his prisoner, Joshua, who behaved  with great dignity and who forgave all those who hated him. He was  crucified amidst the howls and the laughter of the Jerusalem mob.    That is what Joseph told me, with tears running down his old cheeks. I  gave him a gold piece when I left him, but he refused it and asked me  to hand it to one poorer than himself. I also asked him a few questions  about your friend Paul. He had known him slightly. He seems to have"]]]
