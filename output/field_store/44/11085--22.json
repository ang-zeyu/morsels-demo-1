I am Sancho Panza, his squire, and he the vagabond  knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called 'The Knight of the  Rueful Countenance.'\"    Don Quixote had by this time placed himself on his knees beside Sancho,  and, with eyes starting out of his head and a puzzled gaze, was regarding  her whom Sancho called queen and lady; and as he could see nothing in her  except a village lass, and not a very well-favoured one, for she was  platter-faced and snub-nosed, he was perplexed and bewildered, and did  not venture to open his lips. The country girls, at the same time, were  astonished to see these two men, so different in appearance, on their  knees, preventing their companion from going on. She, however, who had  been stopped, breaking silence, said angrily and testily, \"Get out of the  way, bad luck to you, and let us pass, for we are in a hurry.\"    To which Sancho returned, \"Oh, princess and universal lady of El Toboso,  is not your magnanimous heart softened by seeing the pillar and prop of  knight-errantry on his knees before your sublimated presence?\"    On hearing this, one of the others exclaimed, \"Woa then! why, I'm rubbing  thee down, she-ass of my father-in-law! See how the lordlings come to  make game of the village girls now, as if we here could not chaff as well  as themselves. Go your own way, and let us go ours, and it will be better  for you.\"    \"Get up, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote at this; \"I see that fortune, 'with  evil done to me unsated still,' has taken possession of all the roads by  which any comfort may reach 'this wretched soul' that I carry in my  flesh. And thou, highest perfection of excellence that can be desired,  utmost limit of grace in human shape, sole relief of this afflicted heart  that adores thee, though the malign enchanter that persecutes me has  brought clouds and cataracts on my eyes, and to them, and them only,  transformed thy unparagoned beauty and changed thy features into those of  a poor peasant girl, if so be he has not at the same time changed mine  into those of some monster to render them loathsome in thy sight, refuse  not to look upon me with tenderness and love; seeing in this submission  that I make on my knees to thy transformed beauty the humility with which  my soul adores thee.\"    \"Hey-day! My grandfather!\" cried the girl, \"much I care for your  love-making! Get out of the way and let us pass, and we'll thank you.\"    Sancho stood aside and let her go, very well pleased to have got so well  out of the hobble he was in. The instant the village lass who had done  duty for Dulcinea found herself free, prodding her \"cackney\" with a spike  she had at the end of a stick, she set off at full speed across the  field. The she-ass, however, feeling the point more acutely than usual,  began cutting such capers, that it flung the lady Dulcinea to the ground;  seeing which, Don Quixote ran to raise her up, and Sancho to fix and  girth the pack-saddle, which also had slipped under the ass's belly. The  pack-saddle being secured, as Don Quixote was about to lift up his  enchanted mistress in his arms and put her upon her beast, the lady,  getting up from the ground, saved him the trouble, for, going back a  little, she took a short run, and putting both hands on the croup of the  ass she dropped into the saddle more lightly than a falcon, and sat  astride like a man, whereat Sancho said, \"Rogue! but our lady is lighter  than a lanner, and might teach the cleverest Cordovan or Mexican how to  mount; she cleared the back of the saddle in one jump, and without spurs  she is making the hackney go like a zebra; and her damsels are no way  behind her, for they all fly like the wind;\" which was the truth, for as  soon as they saw Dulcinea mounted, they pushed on after her, and sped  away without looking back, for more than half a league.    Don Quixote followed them with his eyes, and when they were no longer in  sight, he turned to Sancho and said, \"How now, Sancho? thou seest how I  am hated by enchanters! And see to what a length the malice and spite  they bear me go, when they seek to deprive me of the happiness it would  give me to see my lady in her own proper form. The fact is I was born to  be an example of misfortune, and the target and mark at which the arrows  of adversity are aimed and directed. Observe too, Sancho, that these  traitors were not content with changing and transforming my Dulcinea, but  they transformed and changed her into a shape as mean and ill-favoured as  that of the village girl yonder; and at the same time they robbed her of  that which is such a peculiar property of ladies of distinction, that is  to say, the sweet fragrance that comes of being always among perfumes and  flowers. For I must tell thee, Sancho, that when I approached to put  Dulcinea upon her hackney (as thou sayest it was, though to me it  appeared a she-ass), she gave me a whiff of raw garlic that made my head  reel, and poisoned my very heart.\"    \"O scum of the earth!\" cried Sancho at this, \"O miserable, spiteful  enchanters! O that I could see you all strung by the gills, like sardines  on a twig! Ye know a great deal, ye can do a great deal, and ye do a  great deal more. It ought to have been enough for you, ye scoundrels, to  have changed the pearls of my lady's eyes into oak galls, and her hair of  purest gold into the bristles of a red ox's tail, and in short, all her  features from fair to foul, without meddling with her smell; for by that  we might somehow have found out what was hidden underneath that ugly  rind; though, to tell the truth, I never perceived her ugliness, but only  her beauty, which was raised to the highest pitch of perfection by a mole  she had on her right lip, like a moustache, with seven or eight red hairs  like threads of gold, and more than a palm long.\"    \"From the correspondence which exists between those of the face and those  of the body,\" said Don Quixote, \"Dulcinea must have another mole  resembling that on the thick of the thigh on that side on which she has  the one on her face; but hairs of the length thou hast mentioned are very  long for moles.\"    \"Well, all I can say is there they were as plain as could be,\" replied  Sancho.    \"I believe it, my friend,\" returned Don Quixote; \"for nature bestowed  nothing on Dulcinea that was not perfect and well-finished; and so, if  she had a hundred moles like the one thou hast described, in her they  would not be moles, but moons and shining stars. But tell me, Sancho,  that which seemed to me to be a pack-saddle as thou wert fixing it, was  it a flat-saddle or a side-saddle?\"    \"It was neither,\" replied Sancho, \"but a jineta saddle, with a field  covering worth half a kingdom, so rich is it.\"    \"And that I could not see all this, Sancho!\" said Don Quixote; \"once more  I say, and will say a thousand times, I am the most unfortunate of men.\"    Sancho, the rogue, had enough to do to hide his laughter, at hearing the  simplicity of the master he had so nicely befooled. At length, after a  good deal more conversation had passed between them, they remounted their  beasts, and followed the road to Saragossa, which they expected to reach  in time to take part in a certain grand festival which is held every year  in that illustrious city; but before they got there things happened to  them, so many, so important, and so strange, that they deserve to be  recorded and read, as will be seen farther on.          CHAPTER XI.    OF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE CAR  OR CART OF \"THE CORTES OF DEATH\"      Dejected beyond measure did Don Quixote pursue his journey, turning over  in his mind the cruel trick the enchanters had played him in changing his  lady Dulcinea into the vile shape of the village lass, nor could he think  of any way of restoring her to her original form; and these reflections  so absorbed him, that without being aware of it he let go Rocinante's  bridle, and he, perceiving the liberty that was granted him, stopped at  every step to crop the fresh grass with which the plain abounded.    Sancho recalled him from his reverie. \"Melancholy, senor,\" said he, \"was  made, not for beasts, but for men; but if men give way to it overmuch  they turn to beasts; control yourself, your worship; be yourself again;  gather up Rocinante's reins; cheer up, rouse yourself and show that  gallant spirit that knights-errant ought to have. What the devil is this?  What weakness is this? Are we here or in France? The devil fly away with  all the Dulcineas in the world; for the well-being of a single  knight-errant is of more consequence than all the enchantments and  transformations on earth.\"    \"Hush, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote in a weak and faint voice, \"hush and  utter no blasphemies against that enchanted lady; for I alone am to blame  for her misfortune and hard fate; her calamity has come of the hatred the  wicked bear me.\"    \"So say I,\" returned Sancho; \"his heart rend in twain, I trow, who saw  her once, to see her now.\"    \"Thou mayest well say that, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"as thou sawest  her in the full perfection of her beauty; for the enchantment does not go  so far as to pervert thy vision or hide her loveliness from thee; against  me alone and against my eyes is the strength of its venom directed.  Nevertheless, there is one thing which has occurred to me, and that is  that thou didst ill describe her beauty to me, for, as well as I  recollect, thou saidst that her eyes were pearls; but eyes that are like  pearls are rather the eyes of a sea-bream than of a lady, and I am  persuaded that Dulcinea's must be green emeralds, full and soft, with two  rainbows for eyebrows; take away those pearls from her eyes and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/597"],[0,"The Story of Burnt Njal: The Great Icelandic Tribune, Jurist, and Counsellor (#17)"],[1,"name my bounty gives,       Een my muse her help refuses,       Making mirth of dungbeard boys.         \"Here I find a nickname fitting       For those noisome dungbeard boys, --       Loath am I to break my bargain       Linked with such a noble man --       Knit we all our taunts together --       Known to me is mind of man --       Call we now with outburst common,       Him, that churl, the beardless carle.\"    \"Thou art a jewel indeed,\" says Hallgerda; \"how yielding thou art  to what I ask!\"    Just then Gunnar came in.  He had been standing outside the door  of the bower, and heard all the words that had passed.  They were  in a great fright when they saw him come in, and then all held  their peace, but before there had been bursts of laughter.    Gunnar was very wroth, and said to Sigmund, \"Thou art a foolish  man, and one that cannot keep to good advice, and thou revilest  Njal's sons, and Njal himself who is most worth of all; and this  thou doest in spite of what thou hast already done.  Mind, this  will be thy death.  But if any man repeats these words that thou  hast spoken, or these verses that thou hast made, that man shall  be sent away at once, and have my wrath beside.\"    But they were all so sore afraid of him, that no one dared to  repeat those words.  After that he went away, but the gangrel  women talked among themselves, and said that they would get a  reward from Bergthora if they told her all this.    They went then away afterwards down thither, and took Bergthora  aside and told her the whole story of their own free will.    Bergthora spoke and said, when men sate down to the board, \"Gifts  have been given to all of you, father and sons, and ye will be no  true men unless ye repay them somehow.\"    \"What gifts are these?\" asks Skarphedinn.    \"You, my sons,\" says Bergthora, \"have got one gift between you  all.  Ye are nicknamed `Dungbeardlings,' but my husband `the  Beardless Carle.'\"    \"Ours is no woman's nature,\" says Skarphedinn, \"that we should  fly into a rage at every little thing.\"    \"And yet Gunnar was wroth for your sakes,\" says she, \"and he is  thought to be good-tempered.  But if ye do not take vengeance for  this wrong, ye will avenge no shame.\"    \"The carline, our mother, thinks this fine sport,\" says  Skarphedinn, and smiled scornfully as he spoke, but still the  sweat burst out upon his brow, and red flecks came over his  checks, but that was not his wont.  Grim was silent and bit his  lip.  Helgi made no sign, and he said never a word.  Hauskuld  went off with Bergthora; she came into the room again, and  fretted and foamed much.    Njal spoke and said, \"`Slow and sure,' says the proverb,  mistress!  and so it is with many things, though they try men's  tempers, that there are always two sides to a story, even when  vengeance is taken.\"    But at even when Njal was come into his bed, he heard that an axe  came against the panel and rang loudly, but there was another  shut bed, and there the shields were hung up, and he sees that  they are away.  He said, \"Who have taken down our shields?\"    \"Thy sons went out with them,\" says Bergthora.    Njal pulled his shoes on his feet, and went out at once, and  round to the other side of the house, and sees that they were  taking their course right up the slope; he said, \"Whither away,  Skarphedinn?\"    \"To look after thy sheep,\" he answers.    \"You would not then be armed,\" said Njal, \"if you meant that, and  your errand must be something else.\"    Then Skarphedinn sang a song,         \"Squanderer of hoarded wealth,       Some there are that own rich treasure,       Ore of sea that clasps the earth,       And yet care to count their sheep;       Those who forge sharp songs of mocking,       Death songs, scarcely can possess       Sense of sheep that crop the grass;       Such as these I seek in fight;\"    and said afterwards, \"We shall fish for salmon, father.\"    \"'Twould be well then if it turned out so that the prey does not  get away from you.\"    They went their way, but Njal went to his bed, and he said to  Bergthora, \"Thy sons were out of doors all of them, with arms,  and now thou must have egged them on to something.\"    \"I will give them my heartfelt thanks,\" said Bergthora, \"if they  tell me the slaying of Sigmund.\"      ENDNOTES:    (1)  \"Swanbath's beams\" -- periphrasis for gold.        45. THE SLAYING OF SIGMUND AND SKIOLLD    Now they, Njal's sons, fare up to Fleetlithe, and were that night  under the Lithe, and when the day began to break, they came near  to Lithend.  That same morning both Sigmund and Skiolld rose up  and meant to go to the studhorses; they had bits with them, and  caught the horses that were in the \"town\" and rode away on them.  They found the stud-horses between two brooks.  Skarphedinn  caught sight of them, for Sigmund was in bright clothing.  Skarphedinn said, \"See you now the red elf yonder, lads?\"  They  looked that way, and said they saw him.    Skarphedinn spoke again: \"Thou, Hauskuld, shalt have nothing to  do with it, for thou wilt often be sent about alone without due  heed; but I mean Sigmund for myself; methinks that is like a man;  but Grim and Helgi, they shall try to slay Skiolld.\"    Hauskuld sat him down, but they went until they came up to them.  Skarphedinn said to Sigmund, \"Take thy weapons and defend  thyself; that is more needful now than to make mocking songs on  me and my brothers.\"    Sigmund took up his weapons, but Skarphedinn waited the while.  Skiolld turned against Grim and Helgi, and they fell hotly to  fight.  Sigmund had a helm on his head, and a shield at his side,  and was girt with a sword, his spear was in his hand; now he  turns against Skarphedinn, and thrusts at once at him with his  spear, and the thrust came on his shield.  Skarphedinn dashes the  spearhaft in two, and lifts up his axe and hews at Sigmund, and  cleaves his shield down to below the handle.  Sigmund drew his  sword and cut at Skarphedinn, and the sword cuts into his shield,  so that it stuck fast.  Skarphedinn gave the shield such a quick  twist, that Sigmund let go his sword.  Then Skarphedinn hews at  Sigmund with his axe; the \"Ogress of war.\"  Sigmund had on a  corselet, the axe came on his shoulder.  Skarphedinn cleft the  shoulder-blade right through, and at the same time pulled the axe  towards him.  Sigmund fell down on both knees, but sprang up  again at once.    \"Thou hast lilted low to me already,\" says Skarphedinn, \"but  still thou shalt fall upon thy mother's bosom ere we two part.\"    \"Ill is that then,\" says Sigmund.    Skarphedinn gave him a blow on his helm, and after that dealt  Sigmund his death-blow.    Grim cut off Skiolld's foot at the ankle-joint, but Helgi thrust  him through with his spear, and he got his death there and then.    Skarphedinn saw Hallgerda's shepherd, just as he had hewn off  Sigmund's head; he handed the head to the shepherd, and bade him  bear it to Hallgerda, and said she would know whether that head  had made jeering songs about them, and with that he sang a  song --         \"Here! this head shalt thou, that heapest       Hoards from ocean-caverns won, (1)       Bear to Hallgerd with my greeting,       Her that hurries men to fight;       Sure am I, O firewood splitter!       That yon spendthrift knows it well,       And will answer if it ever       Uttered mocking songs on us.\"    The shepherd casts the head down as soon as ever they parted,  for he dared not do so while their eyes were on him.  They fared  along till they met some men down by Markfleet, and told them the  tidings.  Skarphedinn gave himself out as the slayer of Sigmund  and Grim and Helgi as the slayers of Skiolld; then they fared  home and told Njal the tidings.  He answers them, \"Good luck to  your hands! Here no self-doom will come to pass as things  stand.\"    Now we must take up the story, and say that the shepherd came  home to Lithend.  He told Hallgerda the tidings.    \"Skarphedinn put Sigmund's head into my hands,\" he says, \"and  bade me bring it thee; but I dared not do it, for I knew not how  thou wouldst like that.\"    \"'Twas ill that thou didst not do that,\" she says; \"I would have  brought it to Gunnar, and then he would have avenged his kinsman,  or have to bear every man's blame.\"    After that she went to Gunnar and said, \"I tell thee of thy  kinsman Sigmund's slaying: Skarphedinn slew him, and wanted them  to bring me the head.\"    \"Just what might be looked for to befall him,\" says Gunnar, \"for  ill redes bring ill luck, and both you and Skarphedinn have often  done one another spiteful turns.\"    Then Gunnar went away; he let no steps be taken towards a suit  for manslaughter, and did nothing about it.  Hallgerda often put  him in mind of it, and kept saying that Sigmund had fallen  unatoned.  Gunnar gave no heed to that.    Now three Things passed away, at each of which men thought that  he would follow up the suit; then a knotty point came on Gunnar's  hands, which he knew not how to set about, and then he rode to  find Njal.  He gave Gunnar a hearty welcome.  Gunnar said to  Njal, \"I am come to seek a bit of good counsel at thy hands about  a knotty point.\"    \"Thou art worthy of it,\" says Njal, and gave him counsel what to  do.  Then Gunnar stood up and thanked him.  Njal then spoke, and  said, and took Gunnar by the hand, \"Over long hath thy kinsman  Sigmund been unatoned.\"    \"He has been long ago atoned,\" says Gunnar, \"but still I will not  fling back the honour offered me.\"    Gunnar had never spoken an ill word of Njal's sons.  Njal would  have nothing else than that Gunnar should make his own award in  the matter.  He awarded two hundred in silver, but let Skiolld  fall without a price.  They paid down all the money at once.    Gunnar declared this their atonement at the Thingskala Thing,  when most men were at it, and laid great weight on the way in  which they (Njal and his sons) had behaved; he told too those bad  words which cost"]]]
