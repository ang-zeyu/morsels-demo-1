Indeed, in Karasowski's narrative  there are not wanting indications that the health of Chopin cannot have  been very vigorous; nor his strength have amounted to much; for in one  place we read that the youth was no friend of long excursions on foot,  and preferred to lie down and dream under beautiful trees; in another  place, that his parents sent him to Reinerz and some years afterwards  to Vienna, because they thought his studies had affected his health,  and that rest and change of air and scene would restore his strength.  Further, we are told that his mother and sisters never tired of  recommending him to wrap up carefully in cold and wet weather, and  that, like a good son and brother, he followed their advice. Lastly,  he objected to smoking. Some of the items of this evidence are very  trivial, but taken collectively they have considerable force. Of greater  significance are the following additional items. Chopin's sister Emilia  was carried off at the age of fourteen by pulmonary disease, and his  father, as a physician informed me, died of a heart and chest complaint.  Stephen Heller, who saw Chopin in 1830 in Warsaw, told me that the  latter was then in delicate health, thin and with sunken cheeks, and  that the people of Warsaw said that he could not live long, but would,  like so many geniuses, die young. The real state of the matter seems  to me to have been this. Although Chopin in his youth was at no time  troubled with any serious illness, he enjoyed but fragile health, and if  his frame did not alreadv contain the seeds of the disease to which he  later fell a prey, it was a favourable soil for their reception.  How easily was an organisation so delicately framed over-excited and  disarranged! Indeed, being vivacious, active, and hard-working, as he  was, he lived on his capital. The fire of youth overcame much, not,  however, without a dangerous waste of strength, the lamentable results  of which we shall see before we have gone much farther. This statement  of the case we find, I think, confirmed by Chopin's correspondence--the  letter written at Reinerz is in this respect noteworthy.        CHAPTER V.        MUSIC AND MUSICIANS IN POLAND BEFORE AND IN CHOPIN'S TIME.        THE golden age of Polish music, which coincides with that of Polish  literature, is the sixteenth century, the century of the Sigismonds. The  most remarkable musician of that time, and probably the greatest that  Poland produced previous to the present century, was Nicolas Gomolka,  who studied music in Italy, perhaps under Palestrina, in whose style  he wrote. Born in or about the beginning of the second half of the  sixteenth century, he died on March 5, 1609. During the reigns of the  kings of the house of Saxony (1697-1763) instrumental music is said  to have made much progress. Be this as it may, there was no lack of  opportunities to study good examples. Augustus the Strong (I. of  Saxony and II of Poland) established a special Polish band, called,  in contradistinction to the Grosse Kammermusik (Great Chamber-band) in  Dresden, Kleine Kammermusik (Little Chamber-band), whose business it was  to be in attendance when his majesty went to Poland. These visits took  place usually once a year, and lasted from, August to December, but  sometimes were more frequent, and shorter or longer, just as occasion  might call for. Among the members of the Polish band--which consisted  of a leader (Premier), four violins, one oboe, two French horns, three  bassoons, and one double bass--we meet with such well-known men as  Johann Joachim Quanz and Franz Benda. Their conductor was Alberto  Ristori, who at the same time held the post of composer to the Italian  actors, a company that, besides plays, performed also little operas,  serenades, intermezzi, &c. The usual retinue of the King on his visits  to Poland included also a part of the French ballet and comedy. These  travels of the artistic forces must have been rich in tragic, comic, and  tragi-comic incidents, and would furnish splendid material for the pen  of a novelist. But such a journey from the Saxon capital to Warsaw,  which took about eight days, and cost on an average from 3,000 to  3,500 thalers (450 to 525 pounds), was a mere nothing compared with the  migration of a Parisian operatic company in May, 1700. The ninety-three  members of which it was composed set out in carriages and drove by  Strasburg to Ulm, there they embarked and sailed to Cracow, whence the  journey was continued on rafts. [FOOTNOTE: M. Furstenau, Zur Geschichte  der Music und des Theaters am Hofe zu Dresden.] So much for artistic  tours at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Frederick Augustus (II  of Saxony and III of Poland, 1733-1763) dissolved the Polish band, and  organised a similar body which was destined solely for Poland, and was  to be resident there. It consisted in 1753 of an organist, two singers,  twenty instrumentalists (almost all Germans), and a band-servant, their  salary amounting to 5,383 thalers, 10 groschen (a little more than 805  pounds). Notwithstanding this new arrangement, the great Dresden band  sometimes accompanied the King to Poland, and when it did not, some of  its members at least had to be in attendance for the performance of the  solos at the chamber concerts and in the operas. Also such singers, male  and female, as were required for the operas proposed for representation  had to take to the road. Hasse and his wife Faustina came several times  to Poland. That the constellation of the Dresden musical establishment,  in its vocal as well as instrumental department, was one of the most  brilliant imaginable is sufficiently proved by a glance at the names  which we meet with in 1719: Lotti, Heinichen, Veracini, Volumier,  Senesino, Tesi, Santa Stella Lotti, Durastanti, &c. Rousseau, writing in  1754, calls the Dresden orchestra the first in Europe. And Burney says  in 1772 that the instrumental performers had been some time previously  of the first class. No wonder, then, if the visits of such artists  improved the instrumental music of Poland.    From Sowinski's Les Musiciens Polonais we learn that on great occasions  the King's band was reinforced by those of Prince Czartoryski and Count  Wielhorski, thus forming a body of 100 executants. This shows that  outside the King's band good musicians were to be found in Poland.  Indeed, to keep in their service private bands of native and foreign  singers and players was an ancient custom among the Polish magnates; it  obtained for a long time, and had not yet died out at the beginning of  this century. From this circumstance, however, we must not too rashly  conclude that these wealthy noblemen were all animated by artistic  enthusiasm. Ostentatiousness had, I am afraid, more to do with it than  love of art for art's sake. Music was simply one of the indispensable  departments of their establishments, in the splendour and vastness of  which they tried to outdo each other and vie with sovereign rulers. The  promiscuous enumeration of musicians, cooks, footmen, &c., in the lady's  description of a nobleman's court which I referred to in the proem,  is in this respect very characteristic. Towards the middle of the last  century Prince Sanguszko, who lived at Dubno, in Volhynia, had in his  service no less than two bands, to which was sometimes joined a third  belonging to Prince Lubomirski. But, it will be asked, what music did  they play? An author of Memoirs of the reign of Augustus III tells us  that, according to the Polish fashion, they had during meal-times  to play national airs, polonaises, mazurkas, &c., arranged for  wind-instruments, with or without violins. For special occasions the  Prince got a new kind of music, then much in favour--viz., a band of  mountaineers playing on flutes and drums. And while the guests were  sitting at the banquet, horns, trumpets, and fifes sounded fanfares.  Besides the ordinary and extraordinary bands, this exalted personage  had among his musical retainers a drummer who performed solos on his  instrument. One is glad to learn that when the Prince was alone or had  little company, he took delight in listening to trios for two violins  and bass, it being then the fashion to play such ensemble pieces. Count  Ilinski, the father of the composer John Stanislas Ilinski, engaged for  his private theatre two companies, one from Germany and one from Italy.  The persons employed in the musical department of his household numbered  124. The principal band, conducted by Dobrzyrnski pere, a good violinist  and conductor, consisted of four violins, one viola, one violoncello,  one double bass, one flute, one oboe, one clarinet, and one bassoon.  Villagers were trained by these players to assist them. Then there  was yet another band, one of wind instruments, under the direction of  Karelli, a pupil of the Russian composer Bartnianski [Footnote: The  Russian Palestrina, whose name is oftener met with in the forms of  Bortnianski and Bortniansky]. The chorus was composed of twenty four  voices, picked from the young people on Count Ilinski's estates. However  questionable the taste of many of these noble art patrons may have been,  there were not wanting some who cultivated music with a purer spirit.  Some of the best bands were those of the Princes D. Radziwill, Adam  Czartoryski, F. Sulkowski, Michael Lubomirski, Counts Ilinski, Oginski,  and Wielhorski. Our inquiry into the cultivation of music at the courts  of the Polish magnates has carried us beyond the point we had reached in  our historical survey. Let us now retrace our steps.    The progress of music above spoken of was arrested by the anarchy and  the civil and other wars that began to rage in Poland with such fury in  the middle of the last century. King Stanislas Poniatowski (1764-1795)  is credited with having exercised great influence on the music of  Poland; at any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4974"],[0,"Australia Twice Traversed (#17)"],[1,"equinoctial gales. We were compelled in the morning to remove the  camp, as we had not a drop of water, and unless it descended in sheets  the country could not hold it, being all pure red sand. The hill near  us had no rocky ledges to catch water, so we made off for the higher  mountains for which we were steering yesterday. Their nearest or most  eastern point was not more than four miles away, and we went first to  it. I walked on ahead of the horses with the shovel, to a small gully  I saw with the glasses, having some few eucalypts growing in it. I  walked up it, to and over rocky ledges, down which at times, no doubt,  small leaping torrents roar. Very little of yesterday's rain had  fallen here; but most fortunately I found one small rock reservoir,  with just sufficient water for all the horses. There was none either  above or below in any other basin, and there were many better-looking  places, but all were dry. The water in this one must have stood for  some time, yesterday's rain not having affected it in the least. The  place at which I found the water was the most difficult for horses to  reach; it was almost impracticable. After finding this opportune  though awkwardly situated supply, I climbed to the summit of the  mount. On the top was a native fig-tree in full bearing; the fruit was  ripe and delicious. It is the size of an ordinary marble, yellow when  unripe, and gradually becoming red, then black: it is full of small  seeds. I was disturbed from my repast by seeing the horses, several  hundred feet below me, going away in the wrong direction. And I had to  descend before I had time to look around; but the casual glance I  obtained gave me the most gloomy and desolate view imaginable; one,  almost enough to daunt the explorer from penetrating any farther into  such a dreadful region. To the eastward, I found I had now long outrun  the old main chain of mountains, which had turned up to the north, or  rather north-north-westward; between me and it a mass of jumbled and  broken mounts appeared; each separate one, however, was almost  surrounded by scrubs, which ran up to the foot of the hill I was upon.  Northward the view was similar. To the west the picture was the same,  except that a more defined range loomed above the intervening  scrubs--the hills furthest away in that direction being probably fifty  miles distant. The whole horizon looked dark and gloomy--I could see  no creeks of any kind, the most extensive water channels were mere  gullies, and not existing at all at a mile from the hills they issued  from.    Watering our horses proved a difficult and tedious task; as many of  them would not approach the rocky basin, the water had to be carried  up to them in canvas buckets. By the time they were all watered, and  we had descended from the rocky gully, the day had passed with most  miraculous celerity. The horses did not finish the water, there being  nearly sufficient to give them another drink. The grass was good here,  as a little flat, on which grew some yellow immortelles, had recently  been burnt. I allowed the horses to remain and drink up the balance of  the water, while I went away to inspect some other gorges or gullies  in the hills to the west of us, and see whether any more water could  be found. The day was cool and fine.    I climbed to the summit of a hill about 800 feet from its base. The  view was similar to yesterday's, except that I could now see these  hills ran on west for twelve or fifteen miles, where the country was  entirely covered with scrubs. Little gullies, with an odd, and  stunted, gum-tree here and there, were seen. Few of these gullies were  more than six feet wide, and the trumpery little streams that descend,  in even their most flooded state, would be of but little service to  anybody. I had wandered up and down hills, in and out of gullies, all  the morning, but had met no single drop of water, and was returning  disappointed to the camp when, on trying one more small scrubby,  dreadfully-rocky little gully which I had missed, or rather passed by,  in going out, I was fortunate enough to discover a few small rocky  holes full of the purest fluid. This treasure was small indeed, but my  gratitude was great; for what pleased me most was the rather strange  fact that the water was trickling from one basin to another, but with  the weakest possible flow. Above and below where I found this water  the gully and the rocks were as dry as the desert around. Had the  supply not been kept up by the trickling, half my horses would have  emptied all the holes at a draught.    The approach to this water was worse, rougher, rockier, and more  impracticable than at the camp; I was, however, most delighted to have  found it, otherwise I should have had to retreat to the last creek. I  determined, however, not to touch it now, but to keep it as a reserve  fund, should I be unable to find more out west. Returning to camp, we  gave the horses all the water remaining, and left the spot perfectly  dry.    We now had the line of hills on our right, and travelled nearly  west-north-west. Close to the foot of the hills the country is open,  but covered with large stones, between the interstices of which grow  huge bunches of the hideous spinifex, which both we and the horses  dread like a pestilence. We have encountered this scourge for over 200  miles. All around the coronets of most of the horses, in consequence  of their being so continually punctured with the spines of this  terrible grass, it has caused a swelling, or tough enlargement of the  flesh and skin, giving them the appearance of having ring-bones. Many  of them have the flesh quite raw and bleeding; they are also very  tender-footed from traversing so much stony ground, as we have lately  had to pass over. Bordering upon the open stony triodia ground  above-mentioned is a bed of scrubs, composed chiefly of mulga, though  there are various other trees, shrubs, and plants amongst it. It is so  dense and thick that in it we cannot see a third of the horses at  once; they, of course, continually endeavour to make into it to avoid  the stones and triodia; for, generally speaking, the pungent triodia  and the mulga acacia appear to be antagonistic members of the  vegetable kingdom. The ground in the scrubs is generally soft, and on  that account also the horses seek it. Out of kindness, I have  occasionally allowed them to travel in the scrubs, when our direct  course should have been on the open, until some dire mishap forces us  out again; for, the scrubs being so dense, the horses are compelled to  crash through them, tearing the coverings of their loads, and  frequently forcing sticks in between their backs or sides and their  saddles, sometimes staking themselves severely. Then we hear a frantic  crashing through the scrubs, and the sounds of the pounding of  horse-hoofs are the first notice we receive that some calamity has  occurred. So soon as we ourselves can force our way through, and  collect the horses the best way we can, yelling and howling to one  another to say how many each may have got, we discover one or two  missing. Then they have to be tracked; portions of loads are picked up  here and there, and, in the course of an hour or more, the horse or  horses are found, repacked, and on we push again, mostly for the open,  though rough and stony spinifex ground, where at least we can see what  is going on. These scrubs are really dreadful, and one's skin and  clothes get torn and ripped in all directions. One of these mishaps  occurred to-day.    In these scrubs are met nests of the building rat (Mus conditor). They  form their nests with twigs and sticks to the height of four feet, the  circumference being fifteen to twenty. The sticks are all lengths up  to three feet, and up to an inch in diameter. Inside are chambers and  galleries, while in the ground underneath are tunnels, which are  carried to some distance from their citadel. They occur in many parts  of Australia, and are occasionally met with on plains where few trees  can be found. As a general rule, they frequent the country inhabited  by the black oak (casuarina). They can live without water, but, at  times, build so near a watercourse as to have their structures swept  away by floods. Their flesh is very good eating.    In ten miles we had passed several little gullies, and reached the  foot of other hills, where a few Australian pines were scattered here  and there. These hills have a glistening, sheening, laminated  appearance, caused by the vast quantities of mica which abounds in  them. Their sides are furrowed and corrugated, and their upper  portions almost bare rock. Time was lost here in unsuccessful searches  for water, and we departed to another range, four or five miles  farther on, and apparently higher; therefore perhaps more likely to  supply us with water. Mr. Carmichael and I ascended the range, and  found it to be 900 feet from its base; but in all its gullies water  there was none. The view from the summit was just such as I have  described before--an ocean of scrubs, with isolated hills or ranges  appearing like islands in most directions. Our horses had been already  twenty-four hours without water. I wanted to reach the far range to  the west, but it was useless to push all the pack-horses farther into  such an ocean of scrubs, as our rate of progress in them was so  terribly slow. I decided to return to the small supply I had left as a  reserve, and go myself to the far range, which was yet some thirty  miles away. The country southward seemed to have been more recently  visited by the natives than upon our line of march, which perhaps was  not to be wondered at, as what could they get to live on out of such a  region as we had got into? Probably forty or fifty miles to the south,  over the tops of some low ridges, we saw the ascending smoke of  spinifex fires, still attended to by the natives; and in the "]]]
