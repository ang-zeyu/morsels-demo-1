Architects use similar methods of    building nowadays.      [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL AT AMIENS A typical Gothic    interior.]    THE RENAISSANCE. Men who could build and adorn great churches and    town halls and who were eager to study in the new universities should be    called civilized. The barbarous days were gone, but men still had much    to learn from the ancient Greeks and Romans. Many of the ancient    buildings were in ruins, the statues half buried or broken, the    paintings destroyed, and the books lost. Men began to search for what    was left of these things and to study them carefully to learn what the    Graeco-Roman world had been like. After a while students could think of    nothing else, and tried to imitate, if they could not surpass, what the    Romans and the Greeks had done. The age in which men were first    interested in these things is called the Renaissance or \"rebirth,\"    because men were so unlike what they had been that they seemed born    again. With the beginning of the Renaissance the Middle Ages came to    an end.      [Illustration: ST. PETER'S AT ROME]    PETRARCH. One of the earliest of these \"new\" men was Petrarch, an    Italian poet who lived in the fourteenth century, a hundred years before    Columbus. He wished above all things to read, copy, and possess the    writings of the Romans, and especially of Cicero, an orator and writer    who lived in the days of Julius Caesar. Petrarch and his friends    searched for the manuscripts of Roman authors which had been preserved,    hidden away in monastery libraries.      The same love of Roman books seized others, and princes spent large sums    of money in collecting and copying ancient writings. At this time a    beginning of the great libraries of Europe was made, Petrarch tried to    learn Greek, but could find no one in Italy able to teach him.    GREEK BOOKS BROUGHT AGAIN TO ITALY. Shortly after Petrarch died    some Greeks came from Constantinople seeking the aid of the pope and the    kings of the West in an attempt to drive back the Turks, who had already    crossed into Europe and settled in the lands which they now occupy.    Unless help should be sent to Constantinople, the city would certainly    fall into their hands. With these Greeks was one of those men who still    loved to read the writings of the ancient authors. He was persuaded to    remain a few years in Florence and other Italian cities and teach Greek    to the eager Italian scholars. He was also persuaded to write a grammar    of the Greek language, in order that after he had returned to    Constantinople others might be able to continue his teaching.      Collectors of books now searched for Greek writings as eagerly as they    had searched for Latin writings. Merchants sent their agents to    Constantinople to buy books. One traveler and scholar brought back to    Italy over two hundred. Soon Italy was the land to which students from    Germany, France, and England went to learn Greek and to obtain copies of    Greek books. It was fortunate that so many books had been brought from    Constantinople, for at last, in 1453, the Turks captured that city and    no place in the East was left where the books of the Greeks were studied    as they had been at Constantinople.      [Illustration: A PRINTING OFFICE IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY]    THE INVENTION OF PRINTING. After collectors of Greek and Roman    writings had made several good libraries, partly by purchase, partly by    copying manuscripts belonging to others, a great invention was made    which enabled these writings to be spread far and wide and placed in the    hands of every student. This invention was the method of printing with    movable types. It is not quite certain who made the invention, although    John Gutenberg, of Mainz, in Germany, has generally been called the    inventor. Probably several men thought of the method at about the same    time, that is, about 1450.    DIFFERENT KINDS OF TYPE. In forming their type the German printers    imitated the lettering made by copyists with a quill. Their type is    called Gothic, and it is still widely used in German books. The Italian    printers made their letters more round and simple in shape, imitating    the handwriting of the best Italian copyists. This is the Roman type, in    which many European peoples, as also the English and the Americans,    print their books. The Italians also prepared a kind of lettering which,    because they were the inventors, is named _italic_.    THE ALDINE PRESS. One of the most famous printers of this early    time was a Venetian named Aldus Manutius or Manucci. He gathered about    him a number of Greeks and planned to print all the Greek manuscripts    that had been discovered. This he did in beautiful type, imitated from    the handwriting of one of his Greek friends. He sold the books for a    price per volume about equal to our fifty cents, so that few scholars    were too poor to buy.    SOME EARLY PRINTED BOOKS. Another great printer was the Englishman    William Caxton, who learned the art in the Netherlands. Among the books    he printed was Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The first book printed by    Gutenberg was the Bible in Latin. Early in the sixteenth century,    through the labors of a Dutch scholar, Erasmus, and of his printer, the    German Froben, the New Testament in Greek was printed.    ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE. The artists and the architects of this    time began to imitate the buildings they found or that they unearthed.    They used round arches and domes more than the pointed arches and    vaulted roofs of the Gothic builders. Sculptors pictured in stone the    stories of the Greek and Roman gods and heroes. Statues long buried in    ancient ruins were dug up, and great artists like the Italian Michel    Angelo studied them and rivaled them in the beautiful statues they cut.    On every hand men's minds were awakened by what they saw of the work of    the founders of the civilized world.

Andrew, hearing a sharp  crackling, looked down at his host and observed that the trapper had  bitten clean through the stem of his corncob.    \"That,\" said the red man huskily, \"is some shootin'.\"    But he did not look up, and he did not smile. And it troubled Andrew to  hear this rather grudging praise.    In the meantime, three days had put the gelding in very fair condition.  He was enough mustang to recuperate swiftly, and that morning he had  tried with hungry eagerness to kick the head from Andrew's shoulders.  This had decided the outlaw. Besides, in the last day there had been  fewer and fewer riders up and down the ravine, and apparently the hunt  for Andrew Lanning had journeyed to another part of the mountains. It  seemed an excellent time to begin his journey again, and he told the  trapper his decision to start on at dusk the next day.    The announcement brought with it a long and thoughtful pause.    \"I wisht I could send you on your way with somethin' worthwhile,\" said  Hank Rainer at length. \"But I ain't rich. I've lived plain and worked  hard, but I ain't rich. So what I can give you, Andy, won't be much.\"    Andrew protested that the hospitality had been more than a generous  gift, but Hank Rainer, looking straight out the door, continued: \"Well,  I'm goin' down the road to get you my little gift, Andy. Be back in an  hour maybe.\"    \"I'd rather have you here to keep me from being lonely,\" said Andrew.  \"I've money enough to buy what I want, but money will never buy me the  talk of an honest man, Hank.\"    The other started. \"Honest enough, maybe,\" he said bitterly. \"But  honesty don't get you bread or bacon, not in this world!\"    And presently he stamped into the shed, saddled his pony, and after a  moment was scattering the pebbles on the way down the ravine. The dark  and silence gathered over Andrew Lanning. He had little warmth of  feeling for Hank Rainer, to be sure, but the hush of the cabin he looked  forward to many a long evening and many a long day in a silence like  this, with no man near him. For the man who rides outside the law  rides alone.    He could have embraced the big man, therefore, when Hank finally came  back, and Andrew could hear the pony panting in the shed, a sure sign  that it had been ridden hard.    \"It ain't much,\" said Hank, \"but it's yours, and I hope you get a chance  to use it in a pinch.\" And he dumped down a case of .45 cartridges.    After all, there could have been no gift more to the point, but it gave  Andrew a little chill of distaste, this reminder of the life that lay  ahead of him. And in spite of himself he could not break the silence  that began to settle over the cabin again. Finally Hank announced that  it was bedtime for him, and, preparing himself by the simple expedient  of kicking off his boots and then drawing off his trousers, he slipped  into his blankets, twisted them tightly around his broad shoulders with  a single turn of his body, and was instantly snoring. Andrew followed  that example more slowly. Not since he left Martindale, however, had he  slept soundly. Take a tame dog into the wilderness and he learns to  sleep like a wolf quickly enough; and Andrew, with mind and nerve  constantly set for action like a cocked revolver, had learned to sleep  like a wild thing in turn. And accordingly, when he wakened in the  middle of the night, he was alert on the instant. He had a singular  feeling that someone had been looking at him while he slept.          CHAPTER 21      First of all, naturally, he looked at the door. It was now a bright  rectangle filled with moonlight and quite empty. There must have been a  sound, and he glanced over to the trapper for an explanation. But Hank  Rainer lay twisted closely in his blankets.    Andrew raised upon one elbow and thought. It troubled him--the insistent  feeling of the eyes which had been upon him. They had burned their way  into his dreams with a bright insistence.    He looked again, and, having formed the habit of photographing things  with one glance, he compared what he saw now with what he had last seen  when he fell asleep. It tallied in every detail except one. The trousers  which had lain on the floor beside Hank's bed were no longer there.    It was a little thing, of course, but Andrew closed his eyes to make  sure. Yes, he could even remember the gesture with which the trapper had  tossed down the trousers to the floor. Andrew sat up in bed noiselessly.  He slipped to the door and flashed one glance up and down. Below him the  hillside was bright beneath the moon. The far side of the ravine was  doubly black in shadow. But nothing lived, nothing moved. And then  again he felt the eye upon him. He whirled. \"Hank!\" he called softly.  And he saw the slightest start as he spoke. \"Hank!\" he repeated in the  same tone, and the trapper stretched his arms, yawned heavily, and  turned. \"Well, lad?\" he inquired.    But Andrew knew that he had been heard the first time, and he felt that  this pretended slow awakening was too elaborate to be true. He went back  to his own bed and began to dress rapidly. In the meantime the trapper  was staring stupidly at him and asking what was wrong.    \"Something mighty queer,\" said Andrew. \"Must have been a coyote in here  that sneaked off with your trousers, unless you have 'em on.\"    Just a touch of pause, then the other replied through a yawn: \"Sure, I  got 'em on. Had to get up in the night, and I was too plumb sleepy to  take 'em off again when I come back.\"    \"Ah,\" said Andrew, \"I see.\"    He stepped to the door into the horse shed and paused; there was no  sound. He opened the door and stepped in quickly. Both horses were on  the ground, asleep, but he took the gelding by the nose, to muffle a  grunt as he rose, and brought him to his feet. Then, still softly and  swiftly, he lifted the saddle from its peg and put it on its back. One  long draw made the cinches taut. He fastened the straps, and then went  to the little window behind the horse, through which had come the vague  and glimmering light by which he did the saddling. Now he scanned the  trees on the edge of the clearing with painful anxiety. Once he thought  that he heard a voice, but it was only the moan of one branch against  another as the wind bent some tree. He stepped back from the window and  rubbed his knuckles across his forehead, obviously puzzled. It might be  that, after all, he was wrong. So he turned back once more toward the  main room of the cabin to make sure. Instead of opening the door softly,  as a suspicious man will, he cast it open with a sudden push of his  foot; the hulk of Hank Rainer turned at the opposite door, and the big  man staggered as though he had been struck.    It might have been caused by his swift right-about face, throwing him  off his balance, but it was more probably the shock that came from  facing a revolver in the hand of Andrew. The gun was at his hip. It had  come into his hand with a nervous flip of the fingers as rapid as the  gesture of the card expert.    \"Come back,\" said Andrew. \"Talk soft, step soft. Now, Hank, what made  you do it?\"    The red hair of the other was burning faintly in the moonlight, and it  went out as he stepped from the door into the middle of the room, his  finger tips brushing the ceiling above him. And Andrew, peering through  that shadow, saw two little, bright eyes, like the eyes of a beast,  twinkling out at him from the mass of hair.    \"When you went after the shells for me, Hank,\" he stated, \"you gave the  word that I was here. Then you told the gent that took the message to  spread it around--to get it to Hal Dozier, if possible--to have the men  come back here. You'd go out, when I was sound asleep, and tell them  when they could rush me. Is that straight?\"    There was no answer.    \"Speak out! I feel like shovin' this gun down your throat, Hank, but I  won't if you speak out and tell me the truth.\"    Whatever other failings might be his, there was no great cowardice in  Hank Rainer. His arms remained above his head and his little eyes  burned. That was all.    \"Well,\" said Andrew, \"I think you've got me, Hank. I suppose I ought to  send you to death before me, but, to tell you the straight of it, I'm  not going to, because I'm sort of sick. Sick, you understand? Tell me  one thing--are the boys here yet? Are they scattered around the edge of  the clearing, or are they on the way? Hank, was it worth five thousand  to double-cross a gent that's your guest--a fellow that's busted bread  with you, bunked in the same room with you? And even when they've  drilled me clean, and you've got the reward, don't you know that you'll  be a skunk among real men from this time on? Did you figure on that when  you sold me?\"    The hands of Hank Rainer fell suddenly, but now lower than his beard.  The fingers thrust at his throat--he seemed to be tearing his own flesh.    \"Pull the trigger, Andy,\" he said. \"Go on. I ain't fit to live.\"    \"Why did you do it, Hank?\"    \"I wanted a new set of traps, Andy; that was what I wanted. I'd been  figurin' and schemin' all autumn how to get my traps before the winter  comes on. My own wasn't any good. Then I seen that fur coat of yours. It  set me thinking about what I could do if I had some honest-to-goodness  traps with springs in 'em that would hold--and--I stood it as long as  I could.\"    While he spoke, Andrew looked past him, through the door. All the world  was silver beyond. The snow had been falling, and on the first great  peak there was a glint of the white, very pure and chill against the  sky. The very air was keen and sweet. Ah, it was a world to live in, and  he was not ready to die!    He looked back to Hank Rainer. \"Hank, my time was sure to come sooner or  later, but I'm not"]]]
