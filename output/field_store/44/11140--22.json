The youth started up with a little cry when his eyes first  swept over this motionless mass of men, thick-spread upon the ground,  pallid, and in strange postures.  His disordered mind interpreted the  hall of the forest as a charnel place.  He believed for an instant that  he was in the house of the dead, and he did not dare to move lest these  corpses start up, squalling and squawking.  In a second, however, he  achieved his proper mind.  He swore a complicated oath at himself.  He  saw that this somber picture was not a fact of the present, but a mere  prophecy.    He heard then the noise of a fire crackling briskly in the cold air,  and, turning his head, he saw his friend pottering busily about a small  blaze.  A few other figures moved in the fog, and he heard the hard  cracking of axe blows.    Suddenly there was a hollow rumble of drums.  A distant bugle sang  faintly.  Similar sounds, varying in strength, came from near and far  over the forest.  The bugles called to each other like brazen  gamecocks.  The near thunder of the regimental drums rolled.    The body of men in the woods rustled.  There was a general uplifting of  heads.  A murmuring of voices broke upon the air.  In it there was much  bass of grumbling oaths.  Strange gods were addressed in condemnation  of the early hours necessary to correct war.  An officer's peremptory  tenor rang out and quickened the stiffened movement of the men.  The  tangled limbs unraveled.  The corpse-hued faces were hidden behind  fists that twisted slowly in the eye sockets.    The youth sat up and gave vent to an enormous yawn.  \"Thunder!\" he  remarked petulantly.  He rubbed his eyes, and then putting up his hand  felt carefully the bandage over his wound.  His friend, perceiving him  to be awake, came from the fire.  \"Well, Henry, ol' man, how do yeh  feel this mornin'?\" he demanded.    The youth yawned again.  Then he puckered his mouth to a little pucker.  His head, in truth, felt precisely like a melon, and there was an  unpleasant sensation at his stomach.    \"Oh, Lord, I feel pretty bad,\" he said.    \"Thunder!\" exclaimed the other.  \"I hoped ye'd feel all right this  mornin'.  Let's see th' bandage--I guess it's slipped.\" He began to  tinker at the wound in rather a clumsy way until the youth exploded.    \"Gosh-dern it!\" he said in sharp irritation; \"you're the hangdest man I  ever saw!  You wear muffs on your hands.  Why in good thunderation  can't you be more easy?  I'd rather you'd stand off an' throw guns at  it.  Now, go slow, an' don't act as if you was nailing down carpet.\"    He glared with insolent command at his friend, but the latter answered  soothingly.  \"Well, well, come now, an' git some grub,\" he said.  \"Then, maybe, yeh'll feel better.\"    At the fireside the loud young soldier watched over his comrade's wants  with tenderness and care.  He was very busy marshaling the little black  vagabonds of tin cups and pouring into them the streaming iron colored  mixture from a small and sooty tin pail.  He had some fresh meat, which  he roasted hurriedly on a stick.  He sat down then and contemplated the  youth's appetite with glee.    The youth took note of a remarkable change in his comrade since those  days of camp life upon the river bank.  He seemed no more to be  continually regarding the proportions of his personal prowess.  He was  not furious at small words that pricked his conceits.  He was no more a  loud young soldier.  There was about him now a fine reliance.  He  showed a quiet belief in his purposes and his abilities.  And this  inward confidence evidently enabled him to be indifferent to little  words of other men aimed at him.    The youth reflected.  He had been used to regarding his comrade as a  blatant child with an audacity grown from his inexperience,  thoughtless, headstrong, jealous, and filled with a tinsel courage.  A  swaggering babe accustomed to strut in his own dooryard.  The youth  wondered where had been born these new eyes; when his comrade had made  the great discovery that there were many men who would refuse to be  subjected by him.  Apparently, the other had now climbed a peak of  wisdom from which he could perceive himself as a very wee thing.  And  the youth saw that ever after it would be easier to live in his  friend's neighborhood.    His comrade balanced his ebony coffee-cup on his knee.  \"Well, Henry,\"  he said, \"what d'yeh think th' chances are?  D'yeh think we'll wallop  'em?\"    The youth considered for a moment.  \"Day-b'fore-yesterday,\" he finally  replied, with boldness, \"you would 'a' bet you'd lick the hull  kit-an'-boodle all by yourself.\"    His friend looked a trifle amazed.  \"Would I?\" he asked.  He pondered.  \"Well, perhaps I would,\" he decided at last.  He stared humbly at the  fire.    The youth was quite disconcerted at this surprising reception of his  remarks.  \"Oh, no, you wouldn't either,\" he said, hastily trying to  retrace.    But the other made a deprecating gesture.  \"Oh, yeh needn't mind,  Henry,\" he said.  \"I believe I was a pretty big fool in those days.\" He  spoke as after a lapse of years.    There was a little pause.    \"All th' officers say we've got th' rebs in a pretty tight box,\" said  the friend, clearing his throat in a commonplace way.  \"They all seem  t' think we've got 'em jest where we want 'em.\"    \"I don't know about that,\" the youth replied.  \"What I seen over on th'  right makes me think it was th' other way about.  From where I was, it  looked as if we was gettin' a good poundin' yestirday.\"    \"D'yeh think so?\" inquired the friend.  \"I thought we handled 'em  pretty rough yestirday.\"    \"Not a bit,\" said the youth.  \"Why, lord, man, you didn't see nothing  of the fight.  Why!\" Then a sudden thought came to him.  \"Oh!  Jim  Conklin's dead.\"    His friend started.  \"What?  Is he?  Jim Conklin?\"    The youth spoke slowly.  \"Yes.  He's dead.  Shot in th' side.\"    \"Yeh don't say so.  Jim Conklin. . .poor cuss!\"    All about them were other small fires surrounded by men with their  little black utensils.  From one of these near came sudden sharp voices  in a row.  It appeared that two light-footed soldiers had been teasing  a huge, bearded man, causing him to spill coffee upon his blue knees.  The man had gone into a rage and had sworn comprehensively.  Stung by  his language, his tormentors had immediately bristled at him with a  great show of resenting unjust oaths.  Possibly there was going to be a  fight.    The friend arose and went over to them, making pacific motions with his  arms.  \"Oh, here, now, boys, what's th' use?\" he said.  \"We'll be at  th' rebs in less'n an hour.  What's th' good fightin' 'mong ourselves?\"    One of the light-footed soldiers turned upon him red-faced and violent.  \"Yeh needn't come around here with yer preachin'.  I s'pose yeh don't  approve 'a fightin' since Charley Morgan licked yeh; but I don't see  what business this here is 'a yours or anybody else.\"    \"Well, it ain't,\" said the friend mildly.  \"Still I hate t' see--\"    There was a tangled argument.    \"Well, he--,\" said the two, indicating their opponent with accusative  forefingers.    The huge soldier was quite purple with rage.  He pointed at the two  soldiers with his great hand, extended clawlike.  \"Well, they--\"    But during this argumentative time the desire to deal blows seemed to  pass, although they said much to each other.  Finally the friend  returned to his old seat.  In a short while the three antagonists could  be seen together in an amiable bunch.    \"Jimmie Rogers ses I'll have t' fight him after th' battle t'-day,\"  announced the friend as he again seated himself.  \"He ses he don't  allow no interferin' in his business.  I hate t' see th' boys fightin'  'mong themselves.\"    The youth laughed.  \"Yer changed a good bit.  Yeh ain't at all like yeh  was.  I remember when you an' that Irish feller--\" He stopped and  laughed again.    \"No, I didn't use t' be that way,\" said his friend thoughtfully.  \"That's true 'nough.\"    \"Well, I didn't mean--\" began the youth.    The friend made another deprecatory gesture.  \"Oh, yeh needn't mind,  Henry.\"    There was another little pause.    \"Th' reg'ment lost over half th' men yestirday,\" remarked the friend  eventually.  \"I thought 'a course they was all dead, but, laws, they  kep' a-comin' back last night until it seems, after all, we didn't lose  but a few.  They'd been scattered all over, wanderin' around in th'  woods, fightin' with other reg'ments, an' everything.  Jest like you  done.\"    \"So?\" said the youth.          Chapter 15      The regiment was standing at order arms at the side of a lane, waiting  for the command to march, when suddenly the youth remembered the little  packet enwrapped in a faded yellow envelope which the loud young  soldier with lugubrious words had intrusted to him.  It made him start.  He uttered an exclamation and turned toward his comrade.    \"Wilson!\"    \"What?\"    His friend, at his side in the ranks, was thoughtfully staring down the  road.  From some cause his expression was at that moment very meek.  The youth, regarding him with sidelong glances, felt impelled to change  his purpose.  \"Oh, nothing,\" he said.    His friend turned his head in some surprise, \"Why, what was yeh goin'  t' say?\"    \"Oh, nothing,\" repeated the youth.    He resolved not to deal the little blow.  It was sufficient that the  fact made him glad.  It was not necessary to knock his friend on the  head with the misguided packet.    He had been possessed of much fear of his friend, for he saw how easily  questionings could make holes in his feelings.  Lately, he had assured  himself that the altered comrade would not tantalize him with a  persistent curiosity, but he felt certain that during the first period  of leisure his friend would ask him to relate his adventures of the  previous day.

Stanton wrote to William Goodell: \"An  effort was made at the annual meeting of the Massachusetts society, which  adjourned today, to make its annual report and its action subservient to  the non-resistant movement, and through the votes of the women of Lynn and  Boston it succeeded.\" A little later, January, 1839, Mr. Stanton wrote  again to Mr. Goodell, as follows: \"I have taken the liberty to show your  letter to brothers Phelps, George Allen, George Russell, O. Scott, N.  Colver, and a large number of others, and they highly approve its  sentiments. They, with you, are fully of the opinion that it is high time  to take a firm stand against the no-government doctrine. They are far from  regarding it merely as a humbug.\" John A. Collins, the Anti-slavery agent  referred to, founded a community at Skaneateles, N. Y., based upon the  following dictums: A disbelief in any special revelation of God to Man, in  any form of worship, in any special regard for the Sabbath, in any church,  disbelief in all governments based on physical force, because they are  \"organized bands of banditti,\" whose authority is to be disregarded, a  disbelief in voting, in petitioning, in doing military duty, paying  personal or property taxes, serving on juries, testifying in \"so-called\"  courts of justice. A disbelief in any individual property. A belief that  as marriage is designed for the happiness of the parties to it, when such  parties have outlived their affections, the sooner the separation takes  place the better, and that such separation shall not be a barrier to their  again uniting with any one. The community lived two and a half years, and  broke up with a debt of ten thousand dollars. John O. Wattles, who was  associated with Collins in the disturbance referred to by Frederick  Douglass, founded a community in Logan County, Ohio, which was called \"The  Prairie Home.\" They had no laws, no government, no opinions, no  principles, no form of society, no test of admission. They professed to  take for their creed the dictum \"Do as you would be done by.\" The  association broke up in anarchy within a few months. Mr. Collins and Mr.  Wattles were always promoters of the Woman-Suffrage movement.    Mr. Garrison said: \"We cannot acknowledge allegiance to any human  government. We can allow no appeal to patriotism to revenge any national  insult or injury.\" Again he said: \"If a nation has no right to defend  itself against foreign enemies, no individual possesses that right in his  own case.... As every human government is upheld by physical strength, and  its laws are enforced at the point of the bayonet, we cannot hold office.  We therefore exclude ourselves from every legislative and judicial body,  and repudiate all human politics, worldly honors, and stations of  authority.\"    Ralph Waldo Emerson says: \"They withdraw themselves from the common labors  and competitions of the market and the caucus.... They are striking work,  and calling out for something worthy to do.... They are not good citizens,  not good members of society; unwilling to bear their part of the public  burdens. They do not even like to vote. They filled the world with long  beards and long words. They began in words, and ended in words.\"    Charles Sumner said: \"An omnibus-load of Boston abolitionists has done  more harm to the Anti-slavery cause than all its enemies.\"    Angelina Grimké, writing at this time to Mr. Weld, said: \"What wouldst  thou think of the 'Liberator' abandoning abolitionism as a primary object,  and becoming the vehicle of all these grand principles?\"    In his published volume \"Anti-slavery Days,\" James Freeman Clarke says of  the first Garrison Anti-slavery society: \"There was no such excitement to  be had anywhere else as at these meetings. There was a little of  everything going on in them. Sometimes crazy people would come in and  insist on taking up the time; sometimes mobs would interrupt the smooth  tenor of their way; but amid all disturbance each meeting gave us an  interesting and impressive hour. I think that some of the Garrisonian  orators had the keenest tongues ever given to man. Stephen S. Foster and  Henry C. Wright, for example, said the sharpest things that were ever  uttered. Their belief was, that people were asleep, and the only thing to  be done was to rouse them; and to do this it was necessary to cut deep and  spare not. The more angry people were made, the better.\" Again, in the  same volume, he says, after describing the political Anti-slavery party:  \"While these political anti-slavery movements were going on, the old  abolitionists, under the lead of Garrison, Phillips, and others, had  decided to oppose all voting and all political efforts under the  Constitution. They adopted as their motto, 'No union with slaveholders.'  Their hope for abolishing slavery was in inducing the North to dissolve  the Union. Edmund Quincy said the Union was 'a confederacy with crime,'  that 'the experiment of a great nation with popular institutions had  signally failed,' that 'the Republic was not a model but a warning to the  nations;' that 'the whole people must be either slaveholders or slaves;'  that the only escape for 'the slave from his bondage was over the ruins of  the American Church and the American State:' and it was the unalterable  purpose of the Garrisonians to labor for the dissolution of the Union.\"  Freeman Clarke goes on to say: \"Wendell Phillips said on one occasion,  'Thank God, I am not a citizen of the United States.' As late as 1861 he  declared the Union a failure, and argued for the dissolution of the Union  as 'the best possible method of abolishing slavery.' If the North had  agreed to disunion and had followed the advice of Phillips, 'To build a  bridge of gold to take the slave States out of the Union,' slavery would  probably be still existing in all the Southern States. At all events, it  was not abolished by those who wished for disunion, but by those who were  determined at all hazards and by every sacrifice to maintain the Union.\"    On April 8, 1839, Henry B. Stanton wrote to William Goodell as follows:  \"At this very time, and mainly, too, in that part of the country where  political action has been most successful, and whence, from its promise of  soon being triumphant, great encouragement was derived by abolitionists  everywhere, a sect has arisen in our midst whose members regard it as of  religious obligation in no case to exercise the elective franchise. This  persuasion is part and parcel of the tenet which it is believed they have  embraced, that as Christians have the precepts of the gospel of Christ,  and the spirit of God to guide them, all human governments, as necessarily  including the idea of force to secure obedience, are not only superfluous,  but unlawful encroachments on the Divine government as ascertained from  the sources above mentioned. Therefore they refuse to do anything  voluntarily that would be considered as acknowledging the lawful existence  of human governments. Denying to civil governments the right to use force,  they easily deduce that family governments have no such right. They carry  out the 'non-resistant' theory. To the first ruffian who would demand our  purse or oust us from our house, they are to be unconditionally  surrendered unless moral suasion be found sufficient to induce him to  desist from his purpose. Our wives, our daughters, our sisters, our  mothers, we are to see set upon by the most brutal, without any effort on  our part except argument to defend them! And even they themselves are  forbidden to use in defence of their purity such powers as God has endowed  them with for its protection, if resistance should be attended with injury  or destruction to the assailant. In short, the 'no-government' doctrines,  as they are believed now to be embraced, seem to strike at the root of the  social structure, and tend, so far as I am able to judge of their  tendency, to throw society into entire confusion and to renew, under the  sanction of religion, scenes of anarchy and license that have generally  hitherto been the offspring of the rankest infidelity and irreligion.\"    Again, he wrote: \"The non-government doctrine, stripped of its disguise,  is worse than Fanny-Wrightism, and, under a Gospel garb, it is Fanny-  Wrightism with a white frock on. It goes to the utter overthrow of all  order, yea, of all purity. When carried out, it goes not only for a  community of goods, but a community of wives. Strange that such an infidel  theory should find votaries in New England!\"    The editors of the \"History of Woman Suffrage\" say in their opening  chapter: \"Among the immediate causes that led to the demand for the equal  political rights of women, in this country, we may note these: First, the  discussion in several of the State legislatures of the property rights of  married women; Second, the great educational work that was accomplished by  the able lectures of Frances Wright, on political, religious, and social  questions. Ernestine L. Rose, following in her wake, equally liberal in  her religious opinions, and equally well-informed on the science of  government, helped to deepen and perpetuate the impression Frances Wright  had made on the minds of unprejudiced hearers. Third, and above all other  causes of the Woman-Suffrage movement, was the Anti-slavery struggle in  this country.\" By referring to the columns of the secular and religious  press of that period, we find that most of the respectable and  representative opinion of the country was \"prejudiced.\" Halls and assembly  rooms in all the cities were closed against Fanny Wright, not only because  her doctrines were absolutely infidel and materialistic, but because they  were deemed subversive of law, order, and decency. The better portion of  society in the United States was of one mind in its estimate of \"The"]]]
