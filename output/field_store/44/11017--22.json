The maiden asked him what he meant by essential  and non-essential. He answered: I call that man essential or  habitual (so to speak), who by the good and persevering practice of  all the virtues, has arrived at the point of finding the practice of  them in their highest perfection pleasant to him, even as the  brightness of the sun remains constant in the sun. But I call him  non-essential, in whom the brightness of the virtues shines in an  unstable and imperfect way like the brightness of the moon. That  full delight of grace which I described is so sweet to the spirit of  the non-essential man, that he would be glad always to have it. When  he has it, he rejoices; when he is deprived of it, he grieves  inordinately; and when it smiles upon him, he is reluctant to pass  to doing other things, even things that are pleasing to God; as I  will show you by an example. The servitor of the Divine Wisdom was  once walking in the chapter-house, and his heart was full of  heavenly jubilation, when the porter called him out to see a woman  who wished to confess to him. He was unwilling to interrupt his  inward delight, and received the porter harshly, bidding him tell  the woman that she must find some one else to confess to, for he did  not wish to hear her confession just then. She, however, being  oppressed with the burden of her sins, said that she felt specially  drawn to seek comfort from him, and that she would confess to no one  else. And when he still refused to go out, she began to weep most  sadly, and going into a corner, lamented greatly. Meanwhile, God  quickly withdrew from the servitor the delights of grace, and his  heart became as hard as flint. And when he desired to know the cause  of this, God answered him inwardly: Even as thou hast driven away  uncomforted that poor woman, so have I withdrawn from thee my Divine  comfort. The servitor groaned deeply and beat his breast, and  hurried to the door, and as he did not find the woman there, was  much distressed. The porter, however, looked about for her  everywhere, and when he found her, still weeping, bade her return to  the door. When she came, the servitor received her gently, and  comforted her sorrowing heart. Then he went back from her to the  chapter-house, and immediately God was with him, with His Divine  consolations, as before.    Then said the maiden: It must be easy for him to bear sufferings, to  whom God gives such jubilation and internal joys. And yet, said the  servitor, all had to be paid for afterward with great suffering.  However, at last, when all this had passed away, and God's appointed  time had come, the same grace of jubilation was restored to him, and  remained with him almost continuously both at home and abroad, in  company and alone. Often in the bath or at table the same grace was  with him; but it was now internal, and did show itself outside.    Then the maiden said: My father, I have now learned what God is; but  I am also eager to know where He is. Thou shalt hear, said the  servitor. The opinion of the theologians is that God is in no  particular place, but that He is everywhere, and all in all. The  same doctors say that we come to know a thing through its name. Now  one doctor says that Being is the first name of God. Turn your eyes,  therefore, to Being in its pure and naked simplicity, and take no  notice of this or that substance which can be torn asunder into  parts and separated; but consider Being in itself, unmixed with any  Not-Being. Whatever is nothing, is the negation of what is; and what  is, is the negation of what is not. A thing which has yet to be, or  which once was, is not now in actual being. Moreover, we cannot know  mixed being or not-being unless we take into account that which is  all-being. This Being is not the being of this or that creature; for  all particular being is mixed with something extraneous, whereby it  can receive something new into itself. Therefore the nameless Divine  Being must be in itself a Being that is all-being, and that sustains  all particular things by its presence.    It shows the strange blindness of man's reason, that it cannot  examine into that which it contemplates before everything, and  without which it cannot perceive anything. Just as, when the eye is  bent on noticing various colours, it does not observe the light  which enables it to see all these objects, and even if it looks at  the light it does not observe it; so it is with the eye of the soul.  When it looks at this or that particular substance, it takes no heed  of the being, which is everywhere one, absolute and simple, and by  the virtue and goodness of which it can apprehend all other things.  Hence the wise Aristotle says, that the eye of our intelligence,  owing to its weakness, is affected towards that being which is  itself the most manifest of all things, as the eye of a bat or owl  is towards the bright rays of the sun. For particular substances  distract and dazzle the mind, so that it cannot behold the Divine  darkness, which is the clearest light.    Come now, open the eyes of thy mind, and gaze if thou canst, on  Being in its naked and simple purity. You will perceive that it  comes from no one, and has no before nor after, and that it cannot  change, because it is simple Being. You will also observe that it is  the most actual, the most present, and the most perfect of beings,  with no defect or mutation, because it is absolutely one in its bare  simplicity. This is so evident to an instructed intellect, that it  cannot think otherwise. Since it is simple Being, it must be the  first of beings, and without beginning or end, and because it is the  first and everlasting and simple, it must be the most present. If  you can understand this, you will have been guided far into the  incomprehensible light of God's hidden truth. This pure and simple  Being is altogether in all things, and altogether outside all  things. Hence a certain doctor says: God is a circle, whose centre  is everywhere, and His circumference nowhere.    When this had been said, the maiden answered: Blessed be God, I have  been shown, as far as may be, both what God is, and where He is. But  I should like also to be told how, if God is so absolutely simple,  He can also be threefold.    The servitor answered: The more simple any being is in itself, the  more manifold is it in its energy and operation. That which has  nothing gives nothing, and that which has much can give much. I have  already spoken of the inflowing and overflowing fount of good which  God is in Himself. This infinite and superessential goodness  constrains Him not to keep it all within Himself, but to communicate  it freely both within and without Himself. But the highest and most  perfect outpouring of the good must be within itself, and this can  be nought else but a present, interior, personal and natural  outpouring, necessary, yet without compulsion, infinite and perfect.  Other communications, in temporal matters, draw their origin from  this eternal communication of the Divine Goodness. Some theologians  say that in the outflow of the creatures from their first origin  there is a return in a circle of the end to the beginning; for as  the emanation of the Persons from the Godhead is an image of the  origin of the creatures, so also it is a type of the flowing back of  the creatures into God. There is, however, a difference between the  outpouring of the creatures and that of God. The creature is only a  particular and partial substance, and its giving and communication  is also partial and limited. When a human father begets a son, he  gives him part, but not the whole, of his own substance, for he  himself is only a partial good. But the outpouring of God is of a  more interior and higher kind than the creature's outpouring,  inasmuch as He Himself is a higher good. If the outpouring of God is  to be worthy of His pre-eminent being, it must be according to  personal relations.    Now, then, if you can look upon the pure goodness of the highest  Good (which goodness is, by its nature, the active principle of the  spontaneous love with which the highest Good loves itself) you will  behold the most excellent and superessential outpouring of the Word  from the Father, by which generation all things exist and are  produced; and you will see also in the highest good, and the highest  outpouring, the most holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,  existing in the Godhead. And if the highest outpouring proceeds from  the highest essential good, it follows that there must be in this  Trinity the highest and most intimate consubstantiality or community  of being, and complete equality and identity of essence, which the  Persons enjoy in sweetest communion, and also that the Substance and  power of the three almighty Persons is undivided and unpartitioned.    Here the maiden exclaimed: Marvellous! I swim in the Godhead like an  eagle in the air. The servitor, resuming his exposition, continued:  It is impossible to express in words how the Trinity can subsist in  the unity of one essence. Nevertheless, to say what may be said on  the subject, Augustine says that in the Godhead the Father is the  Fountain-head of the Son and the Holy Ghost. Dionysius says, that in  the Father there is an outflowing of the Godhead, which naturally  communicates itself to the Word or Son. He also freely and lovingly  pours Himself out into the Son; and the Son in turn pours Himself  out freely and lovingly into the Father; and this love of the Father  for the Son, and of the Son for the Father, is the Holy Ghost. This  is truly said, but it is made clearer by that glorious Doctor of the  Church, St Thomas, who says as follows: In the outpouring of the  Word from the Father's heart, God the Father must contemplate  Himself with His own mind, bending back, as it were, upon His Divine  essence; for if the reason of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4667"],[0,"Seven Wives and Seven Prisons (#17)"],[1,"them a hint or two with regard to the proper  treatment of prisoners. I then made the rounds of the prison, and went  into the dungeon where I had passed so many wretched hours for weeks  at a time. The warden and his deputy congratulated me upon my improved  appearance and prospects, and hoped that my whole future career would be  equally prosperous.    Nor did I forget to call up my friend in need and friend indeed in  the toll-house at the bridge. I stayed three or four days in Windsor,  finding it really a charming place, and I was almost sorry to leave it.  But my only purpose in going there, that is to revisit the prison, was  accomplished, and I started for New York, and went from there to Port  Jervis, where I met my eldest son.        CHAPTER XII. ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP SARAH SCHEIMER'S BOY.    STARTING TO SEE SARAH--THE LONG SEPARATION--WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT  HER--HER DRUNKEN HUSBAND--CHANGE OF PLAN--A SUDDENLY--FORMED  SCHEME--I FIND SARAH'S SON--THE FIRST INTERVIEW--RESOLVE TO  KIDNAP THE BOY--REMONSTRANCES OF MY SON HENRY--THE ATTEMPT--A  DESPERATE STRUGGLE--THE RESCUE--ARREST OF HENRY--MY FLIGHT  INTO PENNSYLVANIA--SENDING ASSISTANCE TO MY SON--RETURN TO PORT  JERVIS--BAILING HENRY--HIS RETURN TO BELVIDERE--HE IS BOUND OVER TO BE  TRIED FOR KIDNAPPING--MY FOLLY.        After I had been in Port Jervis three or four days I matured a plan that  had long been forcing in my mind, and that was, to try and see Sarah  Scheimer once more, or at least to find out something about her and  about our son. The boy, if he was living, must be about ten years of  age. I had never seen him; nor, since the night when I was taken out of  bed and carried to the Easton jail had I ever seen Sarah, or even heard  from her, except by the message the Methodist minister brought to me  from her the day after I was released from jail. In the long interval  I had married the Newark widow, and had served a brief term in the New  Jersey State prison for doing it; I had married Mary Gordon, in New  Hampshire, and had run away, not only from her, but from constables and  the prison in that state; the mock marriage with the Rutland woman at  Troy, and the altogether too real marriage with the Montpelier milliner  had followed; I had spent three wretched years in the Vermont prison at  Windsor; and numerous other exciting adventures had checkered my career.  What had happened to Sarah and her son during all this while? There was  not a week in the whole time since our sudden separation when I had  not thought of Sarah; and now I was near her old home, with means at  my command, leisure on my hands, and I was determined to know something  about her and the child.    So long a time had elapsed and I was so changed in my personal  appearance that I had little fear of being recognized by any one in  Pennsylvania or the adjoining part of New Jersey, who would molest me.  The old matters must have been pretty much forgotten by all but the very  few who were immediately interested in them. It was safe to make the  venture at all events, and, I resolved to make the venture to see and  learn what I could.    I had the idea in my mind that if Sarah was alive and well, and free,  I should be able to induce her to fulfil her promise to come to me, and  that we might go somewhere and settle down and live happily together. At  any rate, I would try to see her and our child.    I did not communicate a word of all this to my son Henry. I told him I  was going to New Jersey to visit some friends, to look for business, and  I would like to have him accompany me. He consented; I hired a horse and  carriage, and one bright morning we started. I had no friends to visit,  no business to do, except to see Sarah--the dearest and best--loved of  all my wives.    When we reached Water Gap I found an old acquaintance in the landlord of  the hotel, and I told him where I was going, and what I hoped to do. He  knew the Scheimers, knew all that had happened eleven years before, and  he told me that Sarah had married again, seven years ago, and was the  mother of two more children. She lived on a farm, half a mile from  Oxford, and her husband who had married her for her money, and had  been urged upon her by her parents, was a shiftless, worthless, drunken  fellow. The boy--my boy--was alive and well, and was with his mother.    This intelligence changed, or rather made definite my plan. Sarah was  nothing to me now. The boy was everything. I must see him, and if he was  what he was represented to be, a bright little fellow, I determined that  he should no longer remain in the hands and under the control of his  drunken step-father, but I would carry him away with me if I could. It  was nearly noon when we arrived at Oxford, and going to my old quarters,  I found that \"Boston Yankee,\" had long since left the place. There was  a new landlord, and I saw no familiar faces about the house; all was new  and strange to me. I made inquiries, and soon found out that Sarah's  boy went to a school in town not far from the hotel, and I went there to  \"prospect,\" leaving Henry at the public house.    It was noon now, and fifty or more boys were trooping out of school. I  carefully scanned the throng. The old proverb has it that it is a wise  child who knows its own father; but it is not so difficult for a father  to know his own children. The moment I put my eyes on Sarah's son, I  knew him; he was the very image of me; I could have picked him out of a  thousand. I beckoned to the boy and he came to me. He was barefoot; and  his very toes betrayed him, for they \"overrode\" just as mine did; but  his face was enough and would have been evidence of his identity as my  son in any court in Christendom.    \"Do you know me, my little man?\" said I.    \"No, sir, I do not.\"    \"Do you know what was your mother's name before she was married?\"    \"Yes Sir, it was Sarah Scheimer.\"    \"Do you know that the man with whom you live is not your rather?\"    \"Oh, yes, Sir, I know that; mother always told me so; but she never told  me who my father was.\"    \"My son,\" said I taking him in my arms, \"I am your father; wait about  here a few minutes till I can go and get my horse and carriage, and I  will take you to ride.\"    I ran over to the hotel; ordered my horse to be brought to the door at  once, got into the wagon with Henry and told him that Sarah Scheimer's  boy was just across the way, and that I was going to carry him off with  us. Henry implored me not to do it, and said it was dangerous. I never  stopped to think of danger when my will impelled me. I did not know that  at that moment, men who had noticed my excited manner, and who knew I  was \"up to something,\" were watching me from the hotel piazza. I drove  over where the boy was waiting, called him to me, and Henry held the  reins while I put out my hands to pull the boy into the carriage. Two of  the men who were watching me came at once, one of them taking the horse  by the head, and the other coming to me and demanding:    \"What are you going to do with that boy?\"    \"Take him with me; he is my son.\"    \"No you don't,\" said the man, and he laid hold of the boy and attempted  to pull him out of the wagon. I also seized the lad who began to scream.  In the struggle for possession, I caught up the whip and struck the man  with the handle, felling him to the ground. All the while the other man  was shouting for assistance. The crowd gathered. The boy was roughly  torn from me, in spite of my efforts to retain him. Henry was thoroughly  alarmed; and while the mob were trying to pull us also out of the  carriage he whipped the horse till he sprang through the crowd and was  well off in a moment.    \"Get out of town as fast as you can drive,\" said I to Henry.    We were not half an hour in reaching Belvidere. There I stopped  to breathe the horse a few minutes, and Henry insisted that he was  starving, and must have something to eat; he would go into the hotel he  said, and get some dinner. I told him it was madness to do it; but he  would not move an inch further on the road till he had some dinner. He  went into the dining room, and I paced up and down the piazza, nervous,  anxious, fearing pursuit, dreading capture, well knowing what would  happen when those Jerseymen should get hold of me and find out who I  was. At that moment I saw the pursuers coming rapidly up the road. I  called to my son:    \"Henry, Henry! for God's sake come out here, quick!\"    But he thought I was only trying to frighten him so as to hurry him away  from his dinner, and get him on the road, and he paid no attention to my  summons. I knew that I was the man who was wanted, and, without waiting  for Henry, I jumped into my wagon and drove off. I just escaped, that's  all. The moment I left, my pursuers were at the door. I looked back and  saw them drag my son out of the house, and take him away with them. I  turned my horse's head towards the Belvidere Bridge. All the country  about there was as familiar to me as the county I was born in. I knew  every road, and I had no fear of being caught. Once across the bridge  and in Pennsylvania, and I was comparatively safe, unless I myself  should be kidnapped as I was at midnight, only a little way from this  very spot, eleven years before. Here was an opportunity now to rest and  reflect. Confound those Scheimers and all their blood! Was I never to  see the end of the scrapes that family would get me into, or which I was  to get myself into, on account of the Scheimers?    Surely they could not harm Henry. They might have taken him merely in  the hope of drawing me back to try to clear him, or rescue him, and then  they would get hold of the man they wanted. My son had done nothing. He  did not even know of the contemplated abduction till five minutes before  it was attempted, and then he protested against it. He only held the  horse when I pulled the lad into the wagon.    Nothing showed so completely the"]]]
