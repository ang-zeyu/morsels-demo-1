These are schools for foremen, or, if we may use a foreign  word like Kindergarten, they are Meisterschaft schools.    9. Youths who wish to enter the highest departments of engineering must  follow advanced courses of mathematics and physics, and must learn  to apply this knowledge. The better colleges and universities afford  abundant opportunities for such training, but their scientific  laboratories are fitted only for those who love long study as well as  hard. These are schools for engineers.    10. Girls are most likely to excel in the lighter arts--to design (for  furniture or fabrics), to embroider, to carve, to engrave, to etch, to  model, to paint. Here also success depends largely upon that which was  inborn, though girls of moderate talent in art, by patience, may become  skilled in many kinds of art work. Schools for this instruction are  schools of art (elementary, decorative, professional, etc.).    If there be those in this hall who think that hand-craft is adverse to  rede-craft, let me ask them to study the lives of men of mark. Isaac  Newton began his life as a farm-boy who carried truck to a market town;  Spinoza, the philosopher of Amsterdam, ground lenses for his livelihood;  Watt, the inventor of the steam engine, was mechanic to the University  of Glasgow; Porson, the great professor of Greek, was trained as a  weaver; George Washington was a land surveyor; Benjamin Franklin a  printer.    Before I close let me draw a lesson from the history of our land. Some  of you doubtless bear in mind that before the late war men used to say,  \"Cotton is king;\" and why so? Because the trades which hung on this crop  were so many and so strong that they ruled all others. The rise or fall  of a penny in the price of cotton at Liverpool affected planters in  the South, spinners in the North, seamen on the ocean, bankers  and money-changers everywhere. Now wheat and petroleum share the  sovereignty; but then cotton was king. Who enthroned this harmless  plant? Two masters of hand-craft, one of whom was born a few miles east  of this place in Westborough; the other was a native of England who  spent most of his days a few miles south of this city. Within five  years--not quite a century ago--these two men were putting in forms  which could be seen, ideas which brought our countrymen large measures  of both weal and woe. In 1790, Samuel Slater, once an apprentice to  Strutt and Arkwright, built the mill at Pawtucket which taught Americans  the art of cotton-spinning; and before 1795, Eli Whitney had invented  the gin which easily cleansed the cotton boll of its seeds, and so made  marketable the great crop we have spoken of. Many men have made more  noise in the world than Slater and Whitney; few if any can be named  whose peaceable hand-craft has done so much to give this country its  front place in the markets of the globe.    Let me come nearer home, and as I take my seat let me name a son of  this very town who loved hand-craft and rede-craft, and worthily aided  both--Isaiah Thomas, the patriot printer, editor, and publisher,  historian of the printer's craft in this land, and founder of the far  famed antiquarian library, eldest in that group of institutions which  gave to Worcester its rank in the world of letters, as its many products  give it standing in the world of industry and art.    Mindful of three such worthies, it is not strange that Salisbury,  Washburn, Boylston, and many more have built up this high school of  handicraft; it will be no wonder if others like minded build on the  foundations which have been so fitly laid.           *       *       *       *       *          MAKING SEA WATER POTABLE.    [Footnote: Read lately before the Manchester Literary and Philosophical  Society]    By THOMAS KAY, President of the Stockport Natural History Society.      The author called attention to the absence of research in this  direction, and how man, endowed to overcome every physical disability  which encompassed him on land, was powerless to live on the wide ocean,  although it is teeming with life.    The water for experiment was taken from the English Channel, about  fifty miles southwest of the Eddystone Lighthouse, and it was found  to correspond closely with the analysis of the Atlantic published by  Roscoe, viz.: Total solids 35.976, of which the total chlorides, are  32.730, representing 19.868 of chlorine.    The waters of the Irish Sea and the English Channel nearer to the German  Ocean, from their neighborhood to great rivers, are weaker than the  above.    Schweitzer's analysis of the waters of the English Channel, near  Brighton, was taken as representing the composition of the sea, and is  here given:        Sodium chloride                27.059      Potassium   \"                   0.766      Magnesium   \"                   3.666          \"     bromide               0.029          \"     sulphate              2.296      Calcium     \"                   1.406          \"    carbonate              0.033      Iodine and ammoniacal salts    traces      Water                         964.795                                   ________                                   1000.000    The chlorides in the--        Irish Sea are about         30 per mille.      English Channel are about   31    \"      Beyond the Eddystone are    32    \"    As the requirement for a potable sea water does not arise except in  mid-ocean, the proportion of 32 per mille must be taken as the basis of  calculation.    This represents as near 20 per mille of chlorine as possible.    From the analysis shown it will be perceived that the chlorides of  sodium and magnesium are in great preponderance.    It is to the former of these that the baneful effects of sea water when  drunk are to be ascribed, for chloride of sodium or common salt produces  thirst probably by its styptic action on the salivary glands, and scurvy  by its deleterious action on the blood when taken in excess.    Sodium chloride being the principal noxious element in sea water, and  soda in combination with a vegetable or organic acid, such as citric  acid, tartaric acid, or malic acid, being innocuous, the conclusion is  that the element of evil to be avoided is _chlorine_.    After describing various experiments, and calling attention to the power  of earthy matters in abstracting salts from solutions by which he hoped  the process would be perfected, an imperial pint of water from beyond  the Eddystone was shown mixed with 960 grains of citrate of silver and 4  grains of the free citric acid.    Each part of the chlorides requires three parts by weight of the silver  citrate to throw down the chlorine, thus:    3NaCl + Ag_{3}C_{6}H_{5}O_{7} = Na3.C_{6}H_{5}O_{7}+3AgCl.    The silver chloride formed a dense insoluble precipitate, and the  supernatant fluid was decanted and filtered through a rubber tube and  handed round as a beverage.    It contained in each fluid ounce by calculation about:        18       grains of citrate of soda.       1-1/2       \"        \"      magnesia.         1/2       \"        \"      potash.       1           \"    sulphate of magnesia.         1/2       \"        \"      lime.         1/5       \"    citric acid.    with less than half a grain of undecomposed chlorides.    To analyze this liquid therapeutically, it may be broadly stated that  salts of potash are _diuretic_, salts of magnesia _aperient_, and salts  of soda _neutral_, except in excessive doses, or in combination with  acids of varying medicinal action; thus, soda in nitric acid, nitrate  of soda, is a _diuretic_, following the law of nitrates as nitrate of  potash, a most powerful diuretic, nitrous ether, etc.; while soda in  combination with sulphuric acid as sulphate of soda is _aperient_,  following the law of sulphates, which increase aperient action, as in  sulphate of magnesia, etc.    Thus it would seem that soda holds the scales evenly between potash and  magnesia in this medical sense, and that it is weighed, so to speak, on  either side by the kind of mineral acid with which it may be combined.    With non-poisonous vegetable acids, and these slightly in excess, there  is not such an effect produced.    Sodium is an important constituent of the human body, and citric acid,  from its carbon, almost a food. Although no one would advocate saline  drinks in excess, yet, under especial circumstances, the solution of it  in the form of citrate can hardly be hurtful when used to moisten the  throat and tongue, for it will never be used under circumstances where  it can be taken in large quantities.    In the converted sea water the bulk of the solids is composed of inert  citrate of soda. There is a little citrate of potash, which is a feeble  diuretic; a little citrate and sulphate of magnesia, a slight aperient,  corrected, however, by the constipatory half grain of sulphate of lime;  so that the whole practically is inoperative.    The combination of these salts in nature's proportions would seem to  indicate that they must be the best for administration in those ailments  to which their use would be beneficial.    Citrate of silver is an almost insoluble salt, and requires to be  kept from the light, air, and organic matter, it being very easily  decomposed.    A stoppered bottle covered with India-rubber was exhibited as indicating  a suitable preserver of the salt, as it affords protection against  light, air, and breakage. As one ounce of silver citrate will convert  half a pint of sea water into a drinkable fluid, and a man can keep  alive upon it a day, then seven ounces of it will keep him a week, and  so on, it may not unreasonably be hoped, in proportion.

Would you have  me turn my stomach inside out to oblige you?    I.  But my Lord has shewn me the intestines of all my countrymen in the  Land of Two Dimensions by taking me with him into the Land of Three.  What therefore more easy than now to take his servant on a second  journey into the blessed region of the Fourth Dimension, where I shall  look down with him once more upon this land of Three Dimensions, and  see the inside of every three-dimensioned house, the secrets of the  solid earth, the treasures of the mines of Spaceland, and the  intestines of every solid living creature, even the noble and adorable  Spheres.    Sphere.  But where is this land of Four Dimensions?    I.  I know not:  but doubtless my Teacher knows.    Sphere.  Not I.  There is no such land.  The very idea of it is utterly  inconceivable.    I.  Not inconceivable, my Lord, to me, and therefore still less  inconceivable to my Master.  Nay, I despair not that, even here, in  this region of Three Dimensions, your Lordship's art may make the  Fourth Dimension visible to me; just as in the Land of Two Dimensions  my Teacher's skill would fain have opened the eyes of his blind servant  to the invisible presence of a Third Dimension, though I saw it not.    Let me recall the past.  Was I not taught below that when I saw a Line  and inferred a Plane, I in reality saw a Third unrecognized Dimension,  not the same as brightness, called \"height\"?  And does it not now  follow that, in this region, when I see a Plane and infer a Solid, I  really see a Fourth unrecognized Dimension, not the same as colour, but  existent, though infinitesimal and incapable of measurement?    And besides this, there is the Argument from Analogy of Figures.    Sphere.  Analogy!  Nonsense:  what analogy?    I.  Your Lordship tempts his servant to see whether he remembers the  revelations imparted to him.  Trifle not with me, my Lord; I crave, I  thirst, for more knowledge.  Doubtless we cannot SEE that other higher  Spaceland now, because we have no eye in our stomachs.  But, just as  there WAS the realm of Flatland, though that poor puny Lineland Monarch  could neither turn to left nor right to discern it, and just as there  WAS close at hand, and touching my frame, the land of Three Dimensions,  though I, blind senseless wretch, had no power to touch it, no eye in  my interior to discern it, so of a surety there is a Fourth Dimension,  which my Lord perceives with the inner eye of thought.  And that it  must exist my Lord himself has taught me.  Or can he have forgotten  what he himself imparted to his servant?    In One Dimension, did not a moving Point produce a Line with TWO  terminal points?    In Two Dimensions, did not a moving Line produce a Square with FOUR  terminal points?    In Three Dimensions, did not a moving Square produce--did not this eye  of mine behold it--that blessed Being, a Cube, with EIGHT terminal  points?    And in Four Dimensions shall not a moving Cube--alas, for Analogy, and  alas for the Progress of Truth, if it be not so--shall not, I say, the  motion of a divine Cube result in a still more divine Organization with  SIXTEEN terminal points?    Behold the infallible confirmation of the Series, 2, 4, 8, 16:  is not  this a Geometrical Progression?  Is not this--if I might quote my  Lord's own words--\"strictly according to Analogy\"?    Again, was I not taught by my Lord that as in a Line there are TWO  bounding Points, and in a Square there are FOUR bounding Lines, so in a  Cube there must be SIX bounding Squares?  Behold once more the  confirming Series, 2, 4, 6:  is not this an Arithmetical Progression?  And consequently does it not of necessity follow that the more divine  offspring of the divine Cube in the Land of Four Dimensions, must have  8 bounding Cubes: and is not this also, as my Lord has taught me to  believe, \"strictly according to Analogy\"?  O, my Lord, my Lord, behold,  I cast myself in faith upon conjecture, not knowing the facts; and I  appeal to your Lordship to confirm or deny my logical anticipations.  If I am wrong, I yield, and will no longer demand a Fourth Dimension;  but, if I am right, my Lord will listen to reason.    I ask therefore, is it, or is it not, the fact, that ere now your  countrymen also have witnessed the descent of Beings of a higher order  than their own, entering closed rooms, even as your Lordship entered  mine, without the opening of doors or windows, and appearing and  vanishing at will?  On the reply to this question I am ready to stake  everything.  Deny it, and I am henceforth silent.  Only vouchsafe an  answer.    Sphere (AFTER A PAUSE).  It is reported so.  But men are divided in  opinion as to the facts.  And even granting the facts, they explain  them in different ways.  And in any case, however great may be the  number of different explanations, no one has adopted or suggested the  theory of a Fourth Dimension.  Therefore, pray have done with this  trifling, and let us return to business.    I.  I was certain of it.  I was certain that my anticipations would be  fulfilled.  And now have patience with me and answer me yet one more  question, best of Teachers!  Those who have thus appeared--no one knows  whence--and have returned--no one knows whither--have they also  contracted their sections and vanished somehow into that more Spacious  Space, whither I now entreat you to conduct me?    Sphere (MOODILY).  They have vanished, certainly--if they ever  appeared.  But most people say that these visions arose from the  thought--you will not understand me--from the brain; from the perturbed  angularity of the Seer.    I.  Say they so?  Oh, believe them not.  Or if it indeed be so, that  this other Space is really Thoughtland, then take me to that blessed  Region where I in Thought shall see the insides of all solid things.  There, before my ravished eye, a Cube moving in some altogether new  direction, but strictly according to Analogy, so as to make every  particle of his interior pass through a new kind of Space, with a wake  of its own--shall create a still more perfect perfection than himself,  with sixteen terminal Extra-solid angles, and Eight solid Cubes for his  Perimeter.  And once there, shall we stay our upward course?  In that  blessed region of Four Dimensions, shall we linger at the threshold of  the Fifth, and not enter therein?  Ah, no!  Let us rather resolve that  our ambition shall soar with our corporal ascent.  Then, yielding to  our intellectual onset, the gates of the Six Dimension shall fly open;  after that a Seventh, and then an Eighth--    How long I should have continued I know not.  In vain did the Sphere,  in his voice of thunder, reiterate his command of silence, and threaten  me with the direst penalties if I persisted.  Nothing could stem the  flood of my ecstatic aspirations.  Perhaps I was to blame; but indeed I  was intoxicated with the recent draughts of Truth to which he himself  had introduced me.  However, the end was not long in coming.  My words  were cut short by a crash outside, and a simultaneous crash inside me,  which impelled me through space with a velocity that precluded speech.  Down! down! down!  I was rapidly descending; and I knew that return to  Flatland was my doom.  One glimpse, one last and never-to-be-forgotten  glimpse I had of that dull level wilderness--which was now to become my  Universe again--spread out before my eye.  Then a darkness.  Then a  final, all-consummating thunder-peal; and, when I came to myself, I was  once more a common creeping Square, in my Study at home, listening to  the Peace-Cry of my approaching Wife.          SECTION 20  How the Sphere encouraged me in a Vision.      Although I had less than a minute for reflection, I felt, by a kind of  instinct, that I must conceal my experiences from my Wife.  Not that I  apprehended, at the moment, any danger from her divulging my secret,  but I knew that to any Woman in Flatland the narrative of my adventures  must needs be unintelligible.  So I endeavoured to reassure her by some  story, invented for the occasion, that I had accidentally fallen  through the trap-door of the cellar, and had there lain stunned.    The Southward attraction in our country is so slight that even to a  Woman my tale necessarily appeared extraordinary and well-nigh  incredible; but my Wife, whose good sense far exceeds that of the  average of her Sex, and who perceived that I was unusually excited, did  not argue with me on the subject, but insisted that I was ill and  required repose.  I was glad of an excuse for retiring to my chamber to  think quietly over what had happened.  When I was at last by myself, a  drowsy sensation fell on me; but before my eyes closed I endeavoured to  reproduce the Third Dimension, and especially the process by which a  Cube is constructed through the motion of a Square.  It was not so  clear as I could have wished; but I remembered that it must be \"Upward,  and yet not Northward,\" and I determined steadfastly to retain these  words as the clue which, if firmly grasped, could not fail to guide me  to the solution.  So mechanically repeating, like a charm, the words,  \"Upward, yet not Northward,\" I fell into a sound refreshing sleep.    During my slumber I had a dream.  I thought I was once more by the side  of the Sphere, whose lustrous hue betokened that he had exchanged his  wrath against me for perfectly placability.  We were moving together  towards a bright but infinitesimally small Point, to which my Master  directed my attention.  As we approached, methought there issued from  it a slight humming noise as from one of your Spaceland bluebottles,  only less resonant by far, so slight indeed that even in the perfect  stillness of the Vacuum through which we soared, the sound reached not  our ears till we checked our flight at a distance from it of something  under twenty human diagonals.    \"Look"]]]
