Am I to mount guard for ever?\"    They only laughed at this.    \"Right, Ymeniz,\" said Toro; \"turn and turn about is but fair. Matteo.\"    \"Present,\" returned one of the men, jumping up and saluting with a  stiff military action, which told that he had once served in the army.    \"Relieve guard, and let Ymeniz take your place here.\"    Matteo picked up his musket and marched up to the rocky pass, while the  late sentry joined the feast.    Now while the guard was changed, without any particular demonstration  of reluctance upon the part of the new sentry himself, Tomaso made a  very wry face.    \"Our comrade Toro gives his commands as naturally as though he were our  leader.\"    Toro flushed up at this.    \"And why not?\" he said, almost fiercely.    \"Why not?\" echoed Tomaso, with a sneer. \"Oh, I could give several  reasons.\"    \"Give them.\"    \"Nay, one will suffice.\"    \"Well.\"    \"Our only chieftain is the gallant Mathias.\"    \"And he is in prison.\"    \"True; but that doesn't prove you to be our leader while poor Mathias  is in the hands of the Philistines.\"    \"Bah!\" replied Toro, impatiently. \"Someone must command while Mathias  is away.\"    \"Then there are others who should command here in his absence in  preference to those who are new comers.\"    \"Who are they?\"    \"You haven't far to look,\" returned Tomaso, drawing himself up  haughtily; \"myself, for instance.\"    Toro burst into a loud and derisive laugh.    \"You?\" he said, contemptuously.    \"Yes, I.\"    \"Why, I have led a band of gallant fellows years ago--a band of thrice  our strength; aye, and what is more, I have led them to victory again  and again--to victory and fortune.\"    \"Your lucky star has not been in the ascendant since you have deigned  to honour us with your company,\" said Tomaso.    The covert sneer conveyed in this speech made the peppery Italian fire  up.    \"What do you mean by that?\" he demanded, fiercely.    \"I mean that your gallant followers must have missed so distinguished a  leader; pity you could not return to lead them to fresh triumphs,  greatly as we should deplore your loss.\"    Toro boiled over at this.    \"Do you want to fix a quarrel on me?\" he asked, in a voice of  suppressed passion.    \"No,\" replied Tomaso, insolently. \"When I want to quarrel, I go  straight to my point; I don't beat about the bush. I only want to  remind you of your proper place here so fall back, Signor Italiano, and  learn to be more respectful in your bearing.\"    Stung to the quick by this, Toro plucked out his sword, and would have  rushed upon the other, had not several of the men interposed.    \"Come, come,\" they said, \"none of that. We have plenty of enemies; we  can cut their throats, not our own, when we want to spill blood.\"    \"Besides,\" said an old man, \"it is profitless quarrelling about the  leadership--we have a leader. Poor Mathias!\"    \"Right,\" echoed several voices together, \"right. Sit down; no  quarrelling.\"    \"Here,\" exclaimed an old brigand, \"let us drink to Mathias.\"    \"And his speedy return,\" added another.    \"Aye, aye, his speedy release.\"    Horn goblets were handed round and filled with ruddy wine from a skin,  which the old brigand himself produced from his own mysterious larder.    \"To Mathias!\"    \"To Mathias!\"    A ringing cheer was heard, and the goblets were drained to the very  dregs.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Who goes there?\"    \"A friend.\"    \"The word.\"    \"Mathias.\"    \"Advance, friend, and give the countersign.\"    This challenge was replied to, and a woman appeared at the narrow  entrance to the mountain pass.    Slowly she walked through, her head drooping and her eyes fixed upon  the ground.    They recognised her now.    It was the wife of their chieftain, the bold Mathias.    \"I scarcely knew you,\" said the sentry, apologetically.    She looked up and smiled in a strangely vacant manner.    The other said nothing.   Her manner impressed them with ugly feelings.    Instinctively they felt that some fresh calamity had happened to them.    In fear and trembling they anticipated the evil tidings which she  brought, although, of course, they could not guess at its exact nature.    \"Did you succeed!\" demanded the old man.    She nodded gravely.    \"You saw Mathias?\"    \"Yes.\"    Her answer was given in the same vacant manner, and staring fixedly  into the very midst of them, she appeared to see nothing.    \"Did you tell our brave captain how eagerly we look forward to his  release--how anxiously we long for the moment when he shall be again  here amongst us--at our head?\"    It was the old brigand who spoke.    She gave him a strange look, from which they could gather absolutely  nothing, and her eyes dropped again to the ground.    The heavy, unpleasant feeling deepened.    Scarcely one of them had the courage to address her again.    An oppressive silence fell upon them all.    They looked at each other in silent, awkward expectation, all, bold  desperadoes as they were, cowed into silence by her manner.    \"You succeeded in seeing him?\" said Hunston.    \"Yes,\" she said, quietly.    \"And you bade him be of good heart?--you told him that we were making a  plan in his behalf--a plan which could not fail of success? You said--\"    The woman looked up.    \"Nothing!\"    \"What!\"    \"Nothing,\" she slowly repeated, \"nothing. I saw him, but it was too  late to speak those words of comfort.\"    \"Too late?\" iterated Hunston, eagerly, \"too late?\"    \"Ah, too late for words of comfort, for menaces, or for any thing.\"    \"Surely you do not mean--\"    He could not complete the sentence, but she helped him out--    \"I do,\" she said, in a hollow voice, and nodding her head gravely, \"I  do mean that he, Mathias, the brigand chief is dead!\"    The brigands, one and all, leaped to their feet, snatching up their  carbines, while from their throats issued a deep cry of revenge.    Dead! The word thrilled them one and all with horror.    The bold Mathias dead!    Prepared as they had been by her manner for some dire Calamity, it came  upon them like a thunderclap. The awful calm manner of the chieftain's  widow impressed them more than if she had thrown up her hands in wild  despair and given way to the noisiest demonstrations of woe.    After some few minutes, one ventured to break the awesome silence.    \"How did he die?\"    The brigand's wife turned from her questioner with a shudder.    \"Ask me nothing yet. I am not able to speak of that at present; give me  time to conquer this weakness.\"    \"If I ask, it is that I may seek vengeance upon his destroyer,\" said  Tomaso, the speaker.    Her eyes sparkled, and the colour rushed into her pale cheek at the  word. \"Vengeance--aye, vengeance. Well spoken, my bold Tomaso;  vengeance is something to live for, after all; vengeance we'll have  too. We'll glut ourselves with it; a feast of vengeance we'll have.\"  \"We will, we will!\" shouted the brigands, as though with one single  voice.    \"These English and these Americans shall die.\"    \"They shall!\"    \"We'll exterminate them, root and branch.\"    \"Aye, aye.\"    \"Firstly, these Harkaways shall fall, then--\"    \"They die.\"    \"Does Mathias owe his death to Harkaway's band?\" demanded Hunston.    \"Was not this Harkaway the prime mover in all our disasters?\"    \"Curse him!\"    \"Aye, curse him!\"    Toro here stepped forward in the centre of the circle which the  brigands had formed.    \"If Harkaway is to be dealt with,\" he said, \"I will undertake to lead  you to triumph within three days.\"    Cheers greeted this speech until Tomaso stepped forward.    \"If we want a leader,\" said he, \"we can elect one; we are not in need  of any man to elect himself.\"    \"Stand back,\" said Toro angrily.    \"Fall back yourself,\" retorted Tomaso, \"and obey your superior.\"    \"My superior? Ha, ha! He does not live here,\" ejaculated Toro fiercely.    The old brigand here once more stepped between the disputants and  interfered.    \"Why quarrel over a dead man's shoes while his widow is still in  sight?\"    Tomaso fell back at the rebuke, but Toro, less thin-skinned, stuck  boldly to his text.    \"If I offer to lead you against the enemy,\" he said, \"it is solely for  our interest generally, not for mine alone.\"    \"Oho!\"    \"Aye, and I can prove it.\"    \"Do so.\"    \"I will.\"    \"Hear him,\" said Tomaso derisively: \"hear our general benefactor speak  up for us all.\"    Toro turned upon the speaker savagely. \"I can speak to you presently,\"  he said significantly, tapping his sword hilt.    \"You'll find me ready to answer you in any way,\" retorted Tomaso  boldly, also tapping his sword.    \"I doubt not; meanwhile, I offer myself as the leader, for several  reasons: firstly, I know these Harkaways well, and am more fit to cope  with them than those who have never met them.\"    Tomaso laughed.    \"I doubt that,\" he said; \"why, by your own showing, you have never  gained any signal successes with them.\"    \"No, but I start where you would have to begin; I am armed by  experience, which you lack.\"    \"True, true,\" exclaimed several of the brigands.    \"That sounds fairly enough,\" replied Tomaso, \"but you have ever met  with such signal discomfiture that I, for one, should have small  confidence in your leadership. I don't speak to uphold myself; let any  other leader be chosen--let one of ourselves to wit, not an Italian, or  any other foreigner. Why should not a Greek lead Greeks?\"    \"Hurrah!\"    A general cheer greeted this speech. \"Tomaso! Tomaso!\" they cried;  \"Tomaso for leader!\"    Toro's face flushed blood red.    \"Hearken to me,\" he exclaimed, in a voice now hoarse with passion;  \"Mathias was a great leader, and I felt it no shame to serve under him,  but I have been in command of as bold and brave a band as this, one far  stronger in point of numbers, and if I am not elected for the command I  shall withdraw altogether. Have me or not, you have the choice; only  this is my determination; I will accept orders from no man here.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7346"],[0,"Among Malay Pirates : a Tale of Adventure and Peril (#17)"],[1,"as pitch, what with  there being no moon and with the mist from the swamps. At any rate,  we might get out of sight before the Malays knew what had happened.  We could either go straight into the jungle and crawl into the thick  bushes, and lie there until morning, and then make our start, or, what  would, I think, be even better, take to the water, wade along under the  bank till we reach one of those sampans fifty yards away, get in, and  manage to paddle it noiselessly across to the opposite side, lift the  craft out of the water, and hide it among the bushes, and then be off.\"    \"The worst of it is the alligators, Harry.\"    \"Yes, but we must risk that. We shall have the krises, and if they seize  either of us, the other must go down and try and jab his kris into the  beast's eyes. I know it is a frightfully dangerous business, and the  chances are one hundred to one against our succeeding; but there is just  a chance, and there is no chance at all if we leave it until tomorrow.  Of course, if we succeed in getting over to the other side, we must wait  close to the water until daylight. We should tear ourselves to pieces if  we tried to make through the jungle in the dark.\"    \"I tell you what would give us a better chance--we might take off two or  three yards of that bandage of yours, cut the strip in half, and twist  it into a rope; then when those fellows doze off a little, we might  throw the things round their necks, and it would be all up with them.\"    \"But you see I have only one arm, Harry.\"    \"Bother it! I never thought of that. Well, I might do the securing, one  fellow first, and then the other. You could get close to him, and if he  moves, catch up his kris and cut him down.\"    \"Yes, I could do that. Well, anyhow, Harry, we can but try; anything is  better than waiting here hour after hour for the messenger to come back  with what will be our death warrant.\"    They agreed to keep awake by turns, and accordingly lay down as soon  as it became dark, the Malays, as usual, squatting at a distance of  a couple of paces each side of them. It was about two o'clock in the  morning when Dick, who was awake, saw, as he supposed, one of the crew  standing up a few yards away; he was not sure, for just at that moment  the figure disappeared.    \"What on earth could that fellow want to stand up for and lie down  again? for I can swear he was not there half a minute ago. There is  another farther on.\" He pinched himself to make sure that he was awake.  Figure after figure seemed to flit along the deck and disappear. One of  the guard rose and stretched his arms; put a fresh bit of some herb that  he was chewing into his mouth; moved close to the prisoners to see if  they were asleep; and then resumed his former position. During the time  that he was on his feet, Dick noticed that the phenomenon which had  so puzzled him ceased. A quarter of an hour later it began again. He  touched Harry, keeping his hand on his lips as a warning to be silent.  Suddenly a wild yell broke on the still air, and in an instant the deck  was alive with men; and as the two Malay watchers rose to their feet,  both were cut down.    There were sounds of heavy blows, screams and yells, a short and  confused struggle, and the fall of heavy bodies, while from the little  village there were also sounds of conflict. The midshipmen had started  to their feet, half bewildered at the sudden and desperate struggle,  when a hand was laid on each of their shoulders, and a voice said,  \"English friends, Hassan has come.\"    The revulsion of feeling was so great that, for a minute, neither  could speak; then Dick said, \"Chief, we thank you with all our hearts.  Tomorrow we should have been killed.\"    The chief shook hands with them both warmly, having seen that mode of  salutation on board ship.    \"Hassan glad,\" he said. \"Hassan watch all time; no let Sehi kill  friends. Friends save Hassan's child; he save them.\"    Torches were now lighted. The deck was thickly encumbered with dead; for  every one of the crew of the prahu had been killed.    \"Sehi killed too,\" the chief said, \"come and see.\" He swung himself on  shore; the boys followed his example, two of the Malays helping Dick  down. They went to the village, where a number of Malays were moving  about; torches had been brought from the ship, and a score of these soon  lit up the scene. Two of the rajah's men had been killed outside their  huts, but the majority had fallen inside. The chief asked a question of  one of his followers, who pointed to a hut.    This they entered, and by the light of the torches saw the rajah lying  dead upon the ground. Hassan said something to one of his men, who, with  a single blow, chopped off the rajah's head.    \"Send to chiefs,\" Hassan said. \"If not see, not think dead. Much afraid  of him. When know he dead, not fight any more; make peace quick.\"    One of the men asked a question, and the lads' limited knowledge of the  language was sufficient to tell them that he was asking whether they  should fire the village. Hassan shook his head. \"Many men,\" he said,  waving his arm to the forest, \"see fire; come fight. Plenty of fight  been; no need for more.\" For a time he stood with them in front of the  pool. A series of splashes in the water told what was going on. The  prahu was being cleared of its load of dead bodies; then several men  filled buckets with water, and handed them up to the deck. The boys knew  that an attempt was being made to wash away the blood. The process was  repeated a dozen times. While this was going on, the pool was agitated  in every direction. The lads shuddered as they looked, and remembered  that they had proposed to wade along the edge. The place swarmed with  alligators, who scrambled and fought for the bodies thrown over, until  the number was so great that all were satisfied, and the pool became  comparatively quiet, although fresh monsters, guided by the smell of  blood, kept arriving on the scene.    At last the chief said, \"Come,\" and together they returned to the prahu.  The morning was now breaking, and but few signs remained of the terrible  conflict of the night. At the chief's order, a large basket of wine,  that had been found in the rajah's hut, was brought on board, together  with another, full of bananas and other fruit.    \"Well,\" Harry said, laughing, \"we little thought, when we saw the  champagne handed over to the rajah, that we were going to have the  serving of it.\"    Hassan joined them at the meal. He had been given wine regularly by the  doctor, and although he had evinced no partiality for it, but had taken  it simply at the doctor's orders, he now drank a little to keep the  others company. In a short time the whole of the chief's followers were  gathered on deck, and the boys saw that they were no more numerous than  the prahu's crew, and that it was only the advantage of surprise that  had enabled them to overcome so easily both those on board the prahu  and the rajah's followers in the village. The oars were got out, and the  prahu proceeded up the creek, in the opposite direction to which it had  entered it. \"Going to ship?\" Harry asked, pointing forward.    Hassan shook his head. \"Going home,\" he said. \"Sent messenger sampan  tell captain both safe. Sehi killed, prahu taken. Must go home. Others  angry because Hassan not join. May come and fight Hassan. Ask captain  bring ship up river; messenger show channel, tell how far can go, then  come in boats, hold great meeting, make peace.\"    The lads were well satisfied. They had a longing to see Hassan's home,  and, perhaps, to do some shooting; and they thought that a few days'  holiday before rejoining would be by no means unpleasant. They wished,  however, that they had known that the sampan was leaving, so that they  could have written a line to the captain, saying what had taken place,  and that they could not rejoin. There was at first some splashing of the  oars, for many of Hassan's men had had no prior experience except with  sampans and large canoes. However, it was not long before they fell into  the swing, and the boat proceeded at a rapid pace. Several times, as  they went, natives appeared on the bank in considerable numbers, and  receiving no answer to their hails, sent showers of lances. Harry,  however, with the aid of two or three Malays, soon loaded the guns of  the prahu.    \"No kill,\" Hassan said. \"We want make friends. No good kill.\"    Accordingly the guns were fired far over the heads of the assailants,  who at once took to the bushes. After three hours' rowing they entered  the river, and continued their course up it until long into the night,  for the rowers were as anxious as was Hassan himself to reach their  village. They were numerous enough to furnish relays at the oars, and  the stroke never flagged until, an hour before midnight, fires were seen  burning ahead, as they turned a bend of the river. The Malays raised  a yell of triumph, which was answered from the village, and in a few  minutes the prahu was brought up to the bank. A crowd, composed  mostly of women and children, received them with shouts of welcome and  gladness. Hassan at once led the midshipmen to a large hut that had  evidently been prepared in readiness for them. Piles of skins lay in  two of the corners, and the lads, who were utterly worn out, threw  themselves down, and were almost instantly asleep.    The sun was high when the mat at the entrance was drawn aside, and  Hassan entered, followed by four of his followers. One carried a great  water jar and two calabashes, with some cotton cloths and towels; the  other brought fruit of several varieties, eggs, and sweetmeats, together  with a large gourd full of steaming coffee.    \"Hassan come again,\" the chief said, and left the hut with his  followers. The lads poured calabashes of water over each other, and  felt wonderfully refreshed by their wash, which was accomplished without"]]]
