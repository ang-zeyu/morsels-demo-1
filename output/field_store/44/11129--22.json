In this very district the accumulation of  negro slaves in 1553 gave rise to an event bearing some analogy to the  insurrection in St. Domingo. A negro slave excited an insurrection  among the miners of the Real de San Felipe de Buria. He retired into  the woods, and founded, with two hundred of his companions, a town,  where he was proclaimed king. Miguel, this new king, was a friend to  pomp and parade. He caused his wife Guiomar, to assume the title of  queen; and, according to Oviedo, he appointed ministers and  counsellors of state, officers of the royal household, and even a  negro bishop. He soon after ventured to attack the neighbouring town  of Nueva Segovia de Barquesimeto; but, being repulsed by Diego de  Losada, he perished in the conflict. This African monarchy was  succeeded at Nirgua by a republic of Zamboes, the descendants of  negroes and Indians. The whole municipality (cabildo) is composed of  men of colour to whom the king of Spain has given the title of \"his  faithful and loyal subjects, the Zamboes of Nirgua.\" Few families of  Whites will inhabit a country where the system of government is so  adverse to their pretensions; and the little town is called in  derision La republica de Zambos y Mulatos.    If the hot valleys of Aroa, of Yaracuy, and of the Rio Tocuyo,  celebrated for their excellent timber, be rendered feverish by  luxuriance of vegetation, and extreme atmospheric humidity, it is  different in the savannahs of Monai and Carora. These Llanos are  separated by the mountainous tract of Tocuyo and Nirgua from the great  plains of La Portuguesa and Calabozo. It is very extraordinary to see  barren savannahs loaded with miasmata. No marshy ground is found  there, but several phenomena indicate a disengagement of hydrogen.* (*  What is that luminous phenomenon known under the name of the Lantern  (farol) of Maracaybo, which is perceived every night toward the  seaside as well as in the inland parts, at Merida for example, where  M. Palacios observed it during two years? The distance, greater than  40 leagues, at which the light is observed, has led to the supposition  that it might be owing to the effects of a thunderstorm, or of  electrical explosions which might daily take place in a pass in the  mountains. It is asserted that, on approaching the farol, the rolling  of thunder is heard. Others vaguely allege that it is an air-volcano,  and that asphaltic soils, like those of Mena, cause these inflammable  exhalations which are so constant in their appearance. The phenomenon  is observed on a mountainous and uninhabited spot, on the borders of  the Rio Catatumbo, near the junction with the Rio Sulia. The situation  of the farol is such that, being nearly in the meridian of the opening  (boca) of the lake of Maracaybo, navigators are guided by it as by a  lighthouse.) When travellers, who are not acquainted with natural  inflammable gases, are shown the Cueva del Serrito de Monai, the  people of the country love to frighten them by setting fire to the  gaseous combination which is constantly accumulated in the upper part  of the cavern. May we attribute the insalubrity of the atmosphere to  the same causes as those which operate in the plains between Tivoli  and Rome, namely, disengagements of sulphuretted hydrogen?* (* Don  Carlos del Pozo has discovered in this district, at the bottom of the  Quebrada de Moroturo, a stratum of clayey earth, black, strongly  soiling the fingers, emitting a powerful smell of sulphur, and  inflaming spontaneously when slightly moistened and exposed for a long  time to the rays of the tropical sun. The detonation of this muddy  substance is very violent.) Possibly, also, the mountainous lands,  near the llanos of Monai, may have a baneful influence on the  surrounding plains. The south-easterly winds may convey to them the  putrid exhalations that rise from the ravine of Villegas, and from La  Sienega de Cabra, between Carora and Carache. I am desirous of  collecting every circumstance having a relation to the salubrity of  the air; for, in a matter so obscure, it is only by the comparison of  a great number of phenomena, that we can hope to discover the truth.    The barren yet feverish savannahs, extending from Barquesimeto to the  eastern shore of the lake of Maracaybo, are partly covered with  cactus; but the good silvester-cochineal, known by the vague name of  grana de Carora, comes from a more temperate region, between Carora  and Truxillo, and particularly from the valley of the Rio Mucuju,* to  the east of Merida. (* This little river descends from the Paramo de  los Conejos, and flows into the Rio Albarregas.) The inhabitants  altogether neglect this production, so much sought for in commerce.      CHAPTER 2.17.    MOUNTAINS WHICH SEPARATE THE VALLEYS OF ARAGUA FROM THE LLANOS OF  CARACAS.  VILLA DE CURA.  PARAPARA.  LLANOS OR STEPPES.  CALABOZO.    The chain of mountains, bordering the lake of Tacarigua towards the  south, forms in some sort the northern shore of the great basin of the  Llanos or savannahs of Caracas. To descend from the valleys of Aragua  into these savannahs, it is necessary to cross the mountains of Guigue  and of Tucutunemo. From a peopled country embellished by cultivation,  we plunge into a vast solitude. Accustomed to the aspect of rocks, and  to the shade of valleys, the traveller beholds with astonishment these  savannahs without trees, these immense plains, which seem to ascend to  the horizon.    Before I trace the scenery of the Llanos, or of the region of  pasturage, I will briefly describe the road we took from Nueva  Valencia, by Villa de Cura and San Juan, to the little village of  Ortiz, at the entrance of the steppes. We left the valleys of Aragua  on the 6th of March before sunrise. We passed over a plain richly  cultivated, keeping along the south-west side of the lake of Valencia,  and crossing the ground left uncovered by the waters of the lake. We  were never weary of admiring the fertility of the soil, covered with  calabashes, water-melons, and plantains. The rising of the sun was  announced by the distant noise of the howling monkeys. Approaching a  group of trees, which rise in the midst of the plain, between those  parts which were anciently the islets of Don Pedro and La Negra, we  saw numerous bands of araguatos moving as in procession and very  slowly, from one tree to another. A male was followed by a great  number of females; several of the latter carrying their young on their  shoulders. The howling monkeys, which live in society in different  parts of America, everywhere resemble each other in their manners,  though the species are not always the same. The uniformity with which  the araguatos* (* Simia ursina.) perform their movements is extremely  striking. Whenever the branches of neighbouring trees do not touch  each other, the male who leads the party suspends himself by the  callous and prehensile part of his tail; and, letting fall the rest of  his body, swings himself till in one of his oscillations he reaches  the neighbouring branch. The whole file performs the same movements on  the same spot. It is almost superfluous to add how dubious is the  assertion of Ulloa, and so many otherwise well-informed travellers,  according to whom, the marimondos,* (* Simia belzebuth.) the  araguatos, and other monkeys with a prehensile tail, form a sort of  chain, in order to reach the opposite side of a river.* (* Ulloa has  not hesitated to represent in an engraving this extraordinary feat of  the monkeys with a prehensile tail.--See Viage a la America  Meridional, Madrid 1748.) We had opportunities, during five years, of  observing thousands of these animals; and for this very reason we  place no confidence in statements possibly invented by the Europeans  themselves, though repeated by the Indians of the Missions, as if they  had been transmitted to them by their fathers. Man, the most remote  from civilization, enjoys the astonishment he excites in recounting  the marvels of his country. He says he has seen what he imagines may  have been seen by others. Every savage is a hunter, and the stories of  hunters borrow from the imagination in proportion as the animals, of  which they boast the artifices, are endowed with a high degree of  intelligence. Hence arise the fictions of which foxes, monkeys, crows,  and the condor of the Andes, have been the subjects in both  hemispheres.    The araguatos are accused of sometimes abandoning their young, that  they may be lighter for flight when pursued by the Indian hunters. It  is said that mothers have been seen removing their young from their  shoulders, and throwing them down to the foot of the tree. I am  inclined to believe that a movement merely accidental has been  mistaken for one premeditated. The Indians have a dislike and a  predilection for certain races of monkeys; they love the viuditas, the  titis, and generally all the little sagoins; while the araguatos, on  account of their mournful aspect, and their uniform howling, are at  once detested and abused. In reflecting on the causes that may  facilitate the propagation of sound in the air during the night, I  thought it important to determine with precision the distance at  which, especially in damp and stormy weather, the howling of a band of  araguatos is heard. I believe I obtained proof of its being  distinguished at eight hundred toises distance. The monkeys which are  furnished with four hands cannot make excursions in the Llanos; and it  is easy, amidst vast plains covered with grass, to recognize a  solitary group of trees, whence the noise proceeds, and which is  inhabited by howling monkeys. Now, by approaching or withdrawing from  this group of trees, the maximum of the distance may be measured, at  which the howling is heard. These distances appeared to me sometimes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7025"],[0,"Rob Roy — Complete (#17)"],[1,"sedentary work caused, between the publication  of \"Old Mortality\" and that of \"Rob Roy,\" the first of those alarming  illnesses which overshadowed the last fifteen years of his life. The  earliest attack of cramp in the stomach occurred on March 5, 1817, when  he \"retired from the room with a scream of agony which electrified his  guests.\"    Living on \"parritch,\" as he tells Miss Baillie (for his national spirit  rejected arrowroot), Scott had yet energy enough to plan a dramatic piece  for Terry, \"The Doom of Devorgoil.\" But in April he announced to John  Ballantyne \"a good subject\" for a novel, and on May 6, John, after a  visit to Abbotsford with Constable, proclaimed to James Ballantyne the  advent of \"Rob Roy.\"    The anecdote about the title is well known. Constable suggested it, and  Scott was at first wisely reluctant to \"write up to a title.\" Names like  Rob Roy, Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, Cleopatra, and so forth, tell the  reader too much, and, Scott imagined, often excite hopes which cannot be  fulfilled. However, in the geniality of an after-dinner hour in the  gardens of Abbotsford, Scott allowed Constable to be sponsor. Many things  had lately brought Rob into his mind. In 1812 Scott had acquired Rob  Roy's gun--\"a long Spanish-barrelled piece, with his initials R. M. C.,\"  C standing for Campbell, a name assumed in compliment to the Argyll  family.    Rob's spleuchan had also been presented by Mr. Train to Sir Walter, in  1816, and may have directed his thoughts to this popular freebooter.  Though Rob flourished in the '15, he was really a character very near  Scott, whose friend Invernahyle had fought Rob with broadsword and  target--a courteous combat like that between Ajax and Hector.    At Tullibody Scott had met, in 1793, a gentleman who once visited Rob,  and arranged to pay him blackmail.    Mr. William Adam had mentioned to Scott in 1816 the use of the word  \"curlie-wurlies\" for highly decorated architecture, and recognised the  phrase, next year, in the mouth of Andrew Fairservice.    In the meeting at Abbotsford (May 2, 1817) Scott was very communicative,  sketched Bailie Nicol Jarvie, and improvised a dialogue between Rob and  the magistrate. A week later he quoted to Southey, Swift's lines--  Too bad for a blessing, too good for a curse,--which probably suggested  Andrew Fairservice's final estimate of Scott's hero,--\"over bad for  blessing, and ower gude for banning.\"    These are the trifles which show the bent of Scott's mind at this period.  The summer of 1817 he spent in working at the \"Annual Register\" and at  the \"Border Antiquities.\" When the courts rose, he visited Rob's cave at  the head of Loch Lomond; and this visit seems to have been gossiped  about, as literary people, hearing of the new novel, expected the cave to  be a very prominent feature. He also went to Glasgow, and refreshed his  memory of the cathedral; nor did he neglect old books, such as \"A Tour  through Great Britain, by a Gentleman\" (4th Edition, 1748). This yielded  him the Bailie's account of Glasgow commerce \"in Musselburgh stuffs and  Edinburgh shalloons,\" and the phrase \"sortable cargoes.\"    Hence, too, Scott took the description of the rise of Glasgow. Thus Scott  was taking pains with his preparations. The book was not written in  post-haste. Announced to Constable early in May, the last sheet was not  corrected till about December 21, when Scott wrote to Ballantyne:--    DEAR JAMES,--                            With great joy I send you Roy.                            'T was a tough job,                          But we're done with Rob.    \"Rob Roy\" was published on the last day of 1817. The toughness of the job  was caused by constant pain, and by struggles with \"the lassitude of  opium.\" So seldom sentimental, so rarely given to expressing his  melancholy moods in verse, Scott, while composing \"Rob Roy,\" wrote the  beautiful poem \"The sun upon the Weirdlaw Hill,\" in which, for this once,  \"pity of self through all makes broken moan.\"    Some stress may be laid on the state of Sir Walter's health at this  moment, because a living critic has tried to show that, in his case,  \"every pang of the stomach paralyses the brain;\" that he \"never had a fit  of the cramp without spoiling a chapter.\"--[Mr. Ruskin's \"Fiction Fair  and Foul,\" \"Nineteenth Century,\" 1880, p. 955.]--\"Rob Roy\" is a  sufficient answer to these theories. The mind of Scott was no slave to  his body.    The success of the story is pleasantly proved by a sentence in a review  of the day: \"It is an event unprecedented in the annals either of  literature or of the custom-house that the entire cargo of a packet, or  smack, bound from Leith to London, should be the impression of a novel,  for which the public curiosity was so much upon the alert as to require  this immense importation to satisfy.\"    Ten thousand copies of a three-volume novel are certainly a ponderous  cargo, and Constable printed no fewer in his first edition. Scott was  assured of his own triumph in February 1819, when a dramatised version of  his novel was acted in Edinburgh by the company of Mr. William Murray, a  descendant of the traitor Murray of Broughton. Mr. Charles Mackay made a  capital Bailie, and the piece remains a favourite with Scotch audiences.  It is plain, from the reviews, that in one respect \"Rob Roy\" rather  disappointed the world. They had expected Rob to be a much more imposing  and majestic cateran, and complained that his foot was set too late on  his native heather. They found too much of the drover and intriguer, too  little of the traditional driver of the spoil. This was what Scott  foresaw when he objected to \"writing up to a title.\" In fact, he did not  write up to, it, and, as the \"Scots Magazine\" said, \"shaped his story in  such a manner as to throw busybodies out in their chase, with a slight  degree of malicious finesse.\" \"All the expeditions to the wonderful cave  have been thrown away, for the said cave is not once, we think, mentioned  from beginning to end.\"    \"Rob Roy\" equals \"Waverley\" in its pictures of Highland and Lowland  society and character. Scott had clearly set himself to state his  opinions about the Highlands as they were under the patriarchal system of  government. The Highlanders were then a people, not lawless, indeed, but  all their law was the will of their chief. Bailie Nicol Jarvie makes a  statement of their economic and military condition as accurate as it is  humorous. The modern \"Highland Question\" may be studied as well in the  Bailie's words as in volumes of history and wildernesses of blue-books.  A people patriarchal and military as the Arabs of the desert were  suddenly dragged into modern commercial and industrial society. All old  bonds were snapped in a moment; emigration (at first opposed by some of  the chiefs) and the French wars depleted the country of its \"lang-leggit  callants, gaun wanting the breeks.\" Cattle took the place of men, sheep  of cattle, deer of sheep, and, in the long peace, a population grew up  again--a population destitute of employment even more than of old,  because war and robbery had ceased to be outlets for its energy. Some  chiefs, as Dr. Johnson said, treated their lands as an attorney treats  his row of cheap houses in a town. Hence the Highland Question,--a  question in which Scott's sympathies were with the Highlanders.  \"Rob Roy,\" naturally, is no mere \"novel with a purpose,\" no economic  tract in disguise. Among Scott's novels it stands alone as regards its  pictures of passionate love. The love of Diana Vernon is no less  passionate for its admirable restraint. Here Scott displays, without  affectation, a truly Greek reserve in his art. The deep and strong  affection of Diana Vernon would not have been otherwise handled by him  who drew the not more immortal picture of Antigone. Unlike modern  novelists, Sir Walter deals neither in analysis nor in rapturous  effusions. We can, unfortunately, imagine but too easily how some writers  would peep and pry into the concealed emotions of that maiden heart; how  others would revel in tears, kisses, and caresses. In place of all these  Scott writes:--         She extended her hand, but I clasped her to my bosom. She sighed as       she extricated herself from the embrace which she permitted, escaped       to the door which led to her own apartment, and I saw her no more.    Months pass, in a mist of danger and intrigue, before the lovers meet  again in the dusk and the solitude.         \"Mr. Francis Osbaldistone,\" cries the girl's voice through the       moonlight, \"should not whistle his favourite airs when he wishes to       remain undiscovered.\"         And Diana Vernon--for she, wrapped in a horseman's cloak, was the       last speaker--whistled in playful mimicry the second part of the       tune, which was on my lips when they came up.    Surely there was never, in story or in song, a lady so loving and so  light of heart, save Rosalind alone. Her face touches Frank's, as she  says goodbye for ever \"It was a moment never to be forgotten,  inexpressibly bitter, yet mixed with a sensation of pleasure so deeply  soothing and affecting as at once to unlock all the floodgates of the  heart.\"    She rides into the night, her lover knows the _hysterica passio_ of poor  Lear, but \"I had scarce given vent to my feelings in this paroxysm ere I  was ashamed of my weakness.\"    These were men and women who knew how to love, and how to live.  All men who read \"Rob Roy\" are innocent rivals of Frank Osbaldistone.  Di Vernon holds her place in our hearts with Rosalind, and these airy  affections, like the actual emotions which they mimic, are not matters  for words. This lady, so gay, so brave, so witty and fearless, so tender  and true, who \"endured trials which might have dignified the history of a  martyr, . . . who spent the day in darkness and the night in vigil, and  never breathed a murmur of weakness or complaint,\""]]]
