It has never been thought desirable that Parliament should itself  nominate even the members of a cabinet. It is enough that it virtually  decides who shall be prime minister, or who shall be the two or three  individuals from whom the prime minister shall be chosen. In doing  this, it merely recognizes the fact that a certain person is the  candidate of the party whose general policy commands its support. In  reality, the only thing which Parliament decides is, which of two, or  at most three, parties or bodies of men shall furnish the executive  government: the opinion of the party itself decides which of its  members is fittest to be placed at the head. According to the existing  practice of the British Constitution, these things seem to be on as  good a footing as they can be. Parliament does not nominate any  minister, but the crown appoints the head of the administration in  conformity to the general wishes and inclinations manifested by  Parliament, and the other ministers on the recommendation of the  chief; while every minister has the undivided moral responsibility of  appointing fit persons to the other offices of administration which  are not permanent. In a republic, some other arrangement would be  necessary; but the nearer it approached in practice to that which has  long existed in England, the more likely it would be to work well.  Either, as in the American republic, the head of the executive must be  elected by some agency entirely independent of the representative  body; or the body must content itself with naming the prime minister,  and making him responsible for the choice of his associates and  subordinates. In all these considerations, at least theoretically, I  fully anticipate a general assent; though, practically, the tendency  is strong in representative bodies to interfere more and more in the  details of administration, by virtue of the general law, that whoever  has the strongest power is more and more tempted to make an excessive  use of it; and this is one of the practical dangers to which the  futurity of representative governments will be exposed.    But it is equally true, though only of late and slowly beginning to be  acknowledged, that a numerous assembly is as little fitted for the  direct business of legislation as for that of administration. There is  hardly any kind of intellectual work which so much needs to be done  not only by experienced and exercised minds, but by minds trained to  the task through long and laborious study, as the business of making  laws. This is a sufficient reason, were there no other, why they can  never be well made but by a committee of very few persons. A reason no  less conclusive is, that every provision of a law requires to be  framed with the most accurate and long-sighted perception of its  effect on all the other provisions; and the law when made should be  capable of fitting into a consistent whole with the previously  existing laws. It is impossible that these conditions should be in any  degree fulfilled when laws are voted clause by clause in a  miscellaneous assembly. The incongruity of such a mode of legislating  would strike all minds, were it not that our laws are already, as to  form and construction, such a chaos, that the confusion and  contradiction seem incapable of being made greater by any addition to  the mass. Yet even now, the utter unfitness of our legislative  machinery for its purpose is making itself practically felt every year  more and more. The mere time necessarily occupied in getting through  bills, renders Parliament more and more incapable of passing any,  except on detached and narrow points. If a bill is prepared which even  attempts to deal with the whole of any subject (and it is impossible  to legislate properly on any part without having the whole present to  the mind), it hangs over from session to session through sheer  impossibility of finding time to dispose of it. It matters not though  the bill may have been deliberately drawn up by the authority deemed  the best qualified, with all appliances and means to boot; or by a  select commission, chosen for their conversancy with the subject, and  having employed years in considering and digesting the particular  measure: it can not be passed, because the House of Commons will not  forego the precious privilege of tinkering it with their clumsy hands.  The custom has of late been to some extent introduced, when the  principle of a bill has been affirmed on the second reading, of  referring it for consideration in detail to a select committee; but it  has not been found that this practice causes much less time to be lost  afterwards in carrying it through the committee of the whole House:  the opinions or private crotchets which have been overruled by  knowledge always insist on giving themselves a second chance before  the tribunal of ignorance. Indeed, the practice itself has been  adopted principally by the House of Lords, the members of which are  less busy and fond of meddling, and less jealous of the importance of  their individual voices, than those of the elective House. And when a  bill of many clauses does succeed in getting itself discussed in  detail, what can depict the state in which it comes out of committee!  Clauses omitted which are essential to the working of the rest;  incongruous ones inserted to conciliate some private interest, or some  crotchety member who threatens to delay the bill; articles foisted in  on the motion of some sciolist with a mere smattering of the subject,  leading to consequences which the member who introduced or those who  supported the bill did not at the moment foresee, and which need an  amending act in the next session to correct their mischiefs. It is one  of the evils of the present mode of managing these things, that the  explaining and defending of a bill, and of its various provisions, is  scarcely ever performed by the person from whose mind they emanated,  who probably has not a seat in the House. Their defense rests upon  some minister or member of Parliament who did not frame them, who is  dependent on cramming for all his arguments but those which are  perfectly obvious, who does not know the full strength of his case,  nor the best reasons by which to support it, and is wholly incapable  of meeting unforeseen objections. This evil, as far as government  bills are concerned, admits of remedy, and has been remedied in some  representative constitutions, by allowing the government to be  represented in either House by persons in its confidence, having a  right to speak, though not to vote.    If that, as yet considerable, majority of the House of Commons who  never desire to move an amendment or make a speech would no longer  leave the whole regulation of business to those who do; if they would  bethink themselves that better qualifications for legislation exist,  and may be found if sought for, than a fluent tongue, and the faculty  of getting elected by a constituency, it would soon be recognized  that, in legislation as well as administration, the only task to which  a representative assembly can possibly be competent is not that of  doing the work, but of causing it to be done; of determining to whom  or to what sort of people it shall be confided, and giving or  withholding the national sanction to it when performed. Any government  fit for a high state of civilization would have as one of its  fundamental elements a small body, not exceeding in number the members  of a cabinet, who should act as a Commission of Legislation, having  for its appointed office to make the laws. If the laws of this country  were, as surely they will soon be, revised and put into a connected  form, the Commission of Codification by which this is effected should  remain as a permanent institution, to watch over the work, protect it  from deterioration, and make further improvements as often as  required. No one would wish that this body should of itself have any  power of _enacting_ laws; the Commission would only embody the element  of intelligence in their construction; Parliament would represent that  of will. No measure would become a law until expressly sanctioned by  Parliament; and Parliament, or either house, would have the power not  only of rejecting but of sending back a bill to the commission for  reconsideration or improvement. Either house might also exercise its  initiative by referring any subject to the commission, with directions  to prepare a law. The commission, of course, would have no power of  refusing its instrumentality to any legislation which the country  desired. Instructions, concurred in by both houses, to draw up a bill  which should effect a particular purpose, would be imperative on the  commissioners, unless they preferred to resign their office. Once  framed, however, Parliament should have no power to alter the measure,  but solely to pass or reject it; or, if partially disapproved of,  remit it to the commission for reconsideration. The commissioners  should be appointed by the crown, but should hold their offices for a  time certain, say five years, unless removed on an address from the  two Houses of Parliament, grounded either on personal misconduct (as  in the case of judges), or on refusal to draw up a bill in obedience  to the demands of Parliament. At the expiration of the five years a  member should cease to hold office unless reappointed, in order to  provide a convenient mode of getting rid of those who had not been  found equal to their duties, and of infusing new and younger blood  into the body.    The necessity of some provision corresponding to this was felt even in  the Athenian Democracy, where, in the time of its most complete  ascendancy, the popular Ecclesia could pass psephisms (mostly decrees  on single matters of policy), but laws, so called, could only be made  or altered by a different and less numerous"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5694"],[0,"The Harvard Classics Volume 38 (#17)"],[1," one of the several parts of animals in a special work, has left  the heart alone untouched. Finally, if any use or benefit to this  department of the republic of letters should accrue from my  labours, it will, perhaps, be allowed that I have not lived idly,  and as the old man in the comedy says:         For never yet hath any one attained       To such perfection, but that time, and place,       And use, have brought addition to his knowledge;       Or made correction, or admonished him,       That he was ignorant of much which he       Had thought he knew; or led him to reject       What he had once esteemed of highest price.    So will it, perchance, be found with reference to the heart at  this time; or others, at least, starting hence, with the way  pointed out to them, advancing under the guidance of a happier  genius, may make occasion to proceed more fortunately, and to  inquire more accurately.          CHAPTER II    ON THE MOTIONS OF THE HEART AS SEEN IN THE DISSECTION OF LIVING  ANIMALS      In the first place, then, when the chest of a living animal is  laid open and the capsule that immediately surrounds the heart is  slit up or removed, the organ is seen now to move, now to be at  rest; there is a time when it moves, and a time when it is  motionless.    These things are more obvious in the colder animals, such as  toads, frogs, serpents, small fishes, crabs, shrimps, snails, and  shell-fish. They also become more distinct in warm-blooded  animals, such as the dog and hog, if they be attentively noted  when the heart begins to flag, to move more slowly, and, as it  were, to die: the movements then become slower and rarer, the  pauses longer, by which it is made much more easy to perceive and  unravel what the motions really are, and how they are performed.  In the pause, as in death, the heart is soft, flaccid, exhausted,  lying, as it were, at rest.    In the motion, and interval in which this is accomplished, three  principal circumstances are to be noted:    1. That the heart is erected, and rises upwards to a point, so  that at this time it strikes against the breast and the pulse is  felt externally.    2. That it is everywhere contracted, but more especially towards  the sides so that it looks narrower, relatively longer, more  drawn together. The heart of an eel taken out of the body of the  animal and placed upon the table or the hand, shows these  particulars; but the same things are manifest in the hearts of  all small fishes and of those colder animals where the organ is  more conical or elongated.    3. The heart being grasped in the hand, is felt to become harder  during its action. Now this hardness proceeds from tension,  precisely as when the forearm is grasped, its tendons are  perceived to become tense and resilient when the fingers are  moved.    4. It may further be observed in fishes, and the colder blooded  animals, such as frogs, serpents, etc., that the heart, when it  moves, becomes of a paler color, when quiescent of a deeper  blood-red color.    From these particulars it appears evident to me that the motion  of the heart consists in a certain universal tension--both  contraction in the line of its fibres, and constriction in every  sense. It becomes erect, hard, and of diminished size during its  action; the motion is plainly of the same nature as that of the  muscles when they contract in the line of their sinews and  fibres; for the muscles, when in action, acquire vigor and  tenseness, and from soft become hard, prominent, and thickened:  and in the same manner the heart.    We are therefore authorized to conclude that the heart, at the  moment of its action, is at once constricted on all sides,  rendered thicker in its parietes and smaller in its ventricles,  and so made apt to project or expel its charge of blood. This,  indeed, is made sufficiently manifest by the preceding fourth  observation in which we have seen that the heart, by squeezing  out the blood that it contains, becomes paler, and then when it  sinks into repose and the ventricle is filled anew with blood,  that the deeper crimson colour returns. But no one need remain in  doubt of the fact, for if the ventricle be pierced the blood will  be seen to be forcibly projected outwards upon each motion or  pulsation when the heart is tense.    These things, therefore, happen together or at the same instant:  the tension of the heart, the pulse of its apex, which is felt  externally by its striking against the chest, the thickening of  its parietes, and the forcible expulsion of the blood it contains  by the constriction of its ventricles.    Hence the very opposite of the opinions commonly received appears  to be true; inasmuch as it is generally believed that when the  heart strikes the breast and the pulse is felt without, the heart  is dilated in its ventricles and is filled with blood; but the  contrary of this is the fact, and the heart, when it contracts  (and the impulse of the apex is conveyed through the chest wall),  is emptied. Whence the motion which is generally regarded as the  diastole of the heart, is in truth its systole. And in like  manner the intrinsic motion of the heart is not the diastole but  the systole; neither is it in the diastole that the heart grows  firm and tense, but in the systole, for then only, when tense, is  it moved and made vigorous.    Neither is it by any means to be allowed that the heart only  moves in the lines of its straight fibres, although the great  Vesalius giving this notion countenance, quotes a bundle of  osiers bound in a pyramidal heap in illustration; meaning, that  as the apex is approached to the base, so are the sides made to  bulge out in the fashion of arches, the cavities to dilate, the  ventricles to acquire the form of a cupping-glass and so to suck  in the blood. But the true effect of every one of its fibres is  to constringe the heart at the same time they render it tense;  and this rather with the effect of thickening and amplifying the  walls and substance of the organ than enlarging its ventricles.  And, again, as the fibres run from the apex to the base, and draw  the apex towards the base, they do not tend to make the walls of  the heart bulge out in circles, but rather the contrary; inasmuch  as every fibre that is circularly disposed, tends to become  straight when it contracts; and is distended laterally and  thickened, as in the case of muscular fibres in general, when  they contract, that is, when they are shortened longitudinally,  as we see them in the bellies of the muscles of the body at  large. To all this let it be added, that not only are the  ventricles contracted in virtue of the direction and condensation  of their walls, but farther, that those fibres, or bands, styled  nerves by Aristotle, which are so conspicuous in the ventricles  of the larger animals, and contain all the straight fibres (the  parietes of the heart containing only circular ones), when they  contract simultaneously by an admirable adjustment all the  internal surfaces are drawn together as if with cords, and so is  the charge of blood expelled with force.    Neither is it true, as vulgarly believed, that the heart by any  dilatation or motion of its own, has the power of drawing the  blood into the ventricles; for when it acts and becomes tense,  the blood is expelled; when it relaxes and sinks together it  receives the blood in the manner and wise which will by-and-by be  explained.          CHAPTER III    OF THE MOTIONS OF THE ARTERIES, AS SEEN IN THE DISSECTION OF  LIVING ANIMALS      In connexion with the motions of the heart these things are  further to be observed having reference to the motions and pulses  of the arteries.    1. At the moment the heart contracts, and when the breast is  struck, when in short the organ is in its state of systole, the  arteries are dilated, yield a pulse, and are in the state of  diastole. In like manner, when the right ventricle contracts and  propels its charge of blood, the pulmonary artery is distended at  the same time with the other arteries of the body.    2. When the left ventricle ceases to act, to contract, to  pulsate, the pulse in the arteries also ceases; further, when  this ventricle contracts languidly, the pulse in the arteries is  scarcely perceptible. In like manner, the pulse in the right  ventricle failing, the pulse in the pulmonary artery ceases also.    3. Further, when an artery is divided or punctured, the blood is  seen to be forcibly propelled from the wound the moment the left  ventricle contracts; and, again, when the pulmonary artery is  wounded, the blood will be seen spouting forth with violence at  the instant when the right ventricle contracts.    So also in fishes, if the vessel which leads from the heart to  the gills be divided, at the moment when the heart becomes tense  and contracted, at the same moment does the blood flow with force  from the divided vessel.    In the same way, when we see the blood in arteriotomy projected  now to a greater, now to a less distance, and that the greater  jet corresponds to the diastole of the artery and to the time  when the heart contracts and strikes the ribs, and is in its  state of systole, we understand that the blood is expelled by the  same movement.    From these facts it is manifest, in opposition to commonly  received opinions, that the diastole of the arteries corresponds  with the time of the heart's systole; and that the arteries are  filled and distended by the blood forced into them by the  contraction of the ventricles; the arteries, therefore, are  distended, because they are filled like sacs or bladders, and are  not filled because they expand like bellows. It is in virtue of  one and the same cause, therefore, that all the arteries of the  body pulsate, viz., the contraction of the left ventricle; in the  same way as the pulmonary artery pulsates by the contraction of  the right ventricle.    Finally, that the"]]]
