These rocks appear naked in the lofty mountains of Parima, as well as  in the plains of the Atabapo and the Cassiquiare. Granite predominates  there over the other rocks; and though, in both continents, the  granite of ancient formation is pretty generally destitute of  gold-ore, we cannot thence conclude that the granite of Parima  contains no vein, no stratum of auriferous quartz. On the east of the  Cassiquiare towards the sources of the Orinoco, we observed that the  number of these strata and these veins increased. The granite of these  countries, by its structure, its mixture of hornblende, and other  geological features alike important, appears to me to belong to a more  recent formation, perhaps posterior to the gneiss, and analogous to  the stanniferous granites, the hyalomictes, and the pegmatites. Now  the least ancient granites are also the least destitute of metals; and  several auriferous rivers and torrents in the Andes, in the Salzburg,  Fichtelgebirge, and the table-land of the two Castiles, lead us to  believe that these granites sometimes contain native gold, and  portions of auriferous pyrites and galena disseminated throughout the  whole rock, as is the case with tin and magnetic and micaceous iron.  The group of the mountains of Parima, several summits of which attain  the height of one thousand three hundred toises, was almost entirely  unknown before our visit to the Orinoco. This group, however, is a  hundred leagues long and eighty broad; and though wherever M. Bonpland  and I traversed this vast group of mountains, its structure seemed to  us extremely uniform, it would be wrong to affirm that it may not  contain very metalliferous transition rocks and mica-slates  superimposed on the granite.    I have already observed that the silvery lustre and frequency of mica  have contributed to give Guiana great celebrity for metallic wealth.  The peak of Calitamini, glowing every evening at sunset with a reddish  fire, still attracts the attention of the inhabitants of Maypures.  According to the fabulous stories of the natives, the islets of  mica-slate, situate in lake Amucu, augment by their reflection the  lustre of the nebulae of the southern sky. \"Every mountain,\" says  Raleigh, \"every stone in the forests of the Orinoco, shines like the  precious metals; if it be not gold, it is madre del oro (mother of  gold).\" Raleigh asserts that he brought back gangues of auriferous  white quartz (\"harde white sparr\"); and to prove the richness of this  ore he gives an account of the assays that were made by the officers  of the mint at London.* (* Messrs. Westewood, Dimocke, and Bulmar.) I  have no reason to believe that the chemists of that time sought to  lead Queen Elizabeth into error, and I will not insult the memory of  Raleigh by supposing, like his contemporaries,* that the auriferous  quartz which he brought home had not been collected in America. (* See  the defence of Raleigh in the preface to the Discovery of Guiana, 1596  pages 2 to 4.) We cannot judge of things from which we are separated  by so long an interval of time. The gneiss of the littoral chain*  contains traces of the precious metals (* In the southern branch of  this chain which passes by Yusma, Villa de Cura and Ocumare,  particularly near Buria, Los Teques and Los Marietas.); and some  grains of gold have been found in the mountains of Parima, near the  mission of Encaramada. How can we infer the absolute sterility of the  primitive rocks of Guiana from testimony merely negative, from the  circumstance that during a journey of three months we saw no  auriferous vein appearing above the soil?    In order to bring together whatever may enlighten the government of  this country on a subject so long disputed, I will enter upon a few  more geological considerations. The mountains of Brazil,  notwithstanding the numerous traces of embedded ore which they display  between Saint Paul and Villa Rica, have furnished only stream-works of  gold. More than six-sevenths of the seventy-eight thousand marks  (52,000 pounds) of this metal, with which at the beginning of the 19th  century America annually supplied the commerce of Europe, have come,  not from the lofty Cordilleras of the Andes, but from the alluvial  lands on the east and west of the Cordilleras. These lands are raised  but little above the level of the sea, like those of Sonora in Mexico,  and of Choco and Barbacoas in New Granada; or they stretch along in  table-lands, as in the interior of Brazil.* (* The height of Villa  Rica is six hundred and thirty toises; but the great table-land of the  Capitania de Minas Geraes is only three hundred toises in height. See  the profile which Colonel d'Eschwege has published at Weimar, with an  indication of the rocks, in imitation of my profile of the Mexican  table-land.) Is it not probable that some other depositions of  auriferous earth extend toward the northern hemisphere, as far as the  banks of the Upper Orinoco and the Rio Negro, two rivers which form  but one basin with that of the Amazon? I observed, when speaking of El  Dorado de Canelas, the Omaguas and the Iquiare, that almost all the  rivers which flow from the west wash down gold in abundance, and very  far from the Cordilleras. From Loxa to Popayan these Cordilleras are  composed alternately of trachytes and primitive rocks. The plains of  Ramora, of Logrono, and of Macas (Sevilla del Oro), the great Rio Napo  with its tributary streams* (the Ansupi and the Coca, in the province  of Quixos (* The little rivers Cosanga, Quixos, and Papallacta or  Maspa, which form the Coca, rise on the eastern slope of the Nevado de  Antisana. The Rio Ansupi brings down the largest grains of gold: it  flows into the Napo, south of the Archidona, above the mouth of the  Misagualli. Between the Misagualli and the Rio Coca, in the province  of Avila, five other northern tributary streams of the Napo (the  Siguna, Munino, Suno, Guataracu, and Pucono) are known as being  singularly auriferous. These local details are taken from several  manuscript reports of the Governor of Quixos, from which I traced the  map of the countries east of the Antisana.)), the Caqueta de Mocoa as  far as the mouth of the Fragua, in fine, all the country comprised  between Jaen de Bracamoros and the Guaviare,* (* From Rio Santiago, a  tributary stream of the Upper Maranon, to the Llanos of Caguan and of  San Juan.) preserve their ancient celebrity for metallic wealth. More  to the east, between the sources of the Guainia (Rio Negro), the  Uaupes, the Iquiare, and the Yurubesh, we find a soil incontestably  auriferous. There Acunha and Father Fritz placed their Laguna del Oro;  and various accounts which I obtained at San Carlos from Portuguese  Americans explain perfectly what La Condamine has related of the  plates of beaten gold found in the hands of the natives. If we pass  from the Iquiare to the left bank of the Rio Negro, we enter a country  entirely unknown, between the Rio Branco, the sources of the  Essequibo, and the mountains of Portuguese Guiana. Acunha speaks of  the gold washed down by the northern tributary streams of the Lower  Maranon, such as the Rio Trombetas (Oriximina), the Curupatuba, and  the Ginipape (Rio de Paru). It appears to me a circumstance worthy of  attention that all these rivers descend from the same table-land, the  northern slope of which contains the lake Amucu, the Dorado of Raleigh  and the Dutch, and the isthmus between the Rupunuri (Rupunuwini) and  the Rio Mahu. There is no reason for denying the existence of  auriferous alluvial lands far from the Cordilleras of the Andes on the  north of the Amazon; as there are on the south in the mountains of  Brazil. The Caribs of the Carony, the Cuyuni and the Essequibo, have  practised on a small scale the washing of alluvial earth from the  remotest times.* (* \"On the north of the confluence of the Curupatuba  and the Amazon,\" says Acunha, \"is the mountain of Paraguaxo, which,  when illumined by the sun, glows with the most beautiful colours; and  thence from time to time issues a horrible noise (revienta con grandes  struenos).\" Is there a volcanic phenomenon in this eastern part of the  New Continent? or is it the love of the marvellous, which has given  rise to the tradition of the bellowings (bramidos) of Paraguaxo? The  lustre emitted from the sides of the mountain recalls to mind what we  have mentioned above of the miraculous rocks of Calitamini, and the  island Ipomucena, in the imaginary Lake Dorado. In one of the Spanish  letters intercepted at sea by Captain George Popham, in 1594, it is  said, \"Having inquired of the natives whence they obtained the  spangles and powder of gold, which we found in their huts, and which  they stick on their skin by means of some greasy substances, they told  us that in a certain plain they tore up the grass, and gathered the  earth in baskets, to subject it to the process of washing.\" Raleigh  page 109. Can this passage be explained by supposing that the Indians  sought thus laboriously, not for gold, but for spangles of mica, which  the natives of Rio Caura still employ as ornaments, when they paint  their bodies?) When we examine the structure of mountains and embrace  in one point of view an extensive surface of the globe, distances  disappear; and places the most remote insensibly draw near each other.  The basin of the Upper Orinoco, the Rio Negro, and the Amazon is  bounded by the mountains of Parime on the north, and by those of Minas  Geraes, and Matogrosso on the south. The opposite slopes of the same  valley often display an analogy in their geological relations.    I have described in this and the preceding volume the vast provinces  of Venezuela and Spanish Guiana. While examining their natural limits,  their climate, and their productions, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7297"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#17)"],[1,"of plurality through the fact that  Scripture tells us about a substance devoid of all difference; and at  the same time you prove the latter point through the former. Moreover,  if Perception gives rise to perverse cognition because it is based on  the imagination of plurality, Scripture also is in no better case--for  it is based on the very same view.--If against this you urge that  Scripture, although based on a defect, yet sublates Perception in so far  as it is the cause of a cognition which dispels all plurality  apprehended through Perception, and thus is later in order than  Perception; we rejoin that the defectiveness of the foundation of  Scripture having once been recognised, the circumstance of its being  later is of no avail. For if a man is afraid of a rope which he mistakes  for a snake his fear does not come to an end because another man, whom  he considers to be in error himself, tells him 'This is no snake, do not  be afraid.' And that Scripture _is_ founded on something defective is  known at the very time of hearing Scripture, for the reflection (which  follows on hearing) consists in repeated attempts to cognise the oneness  of Brahman--a cognition which is destructive of all the plurality  apprehended through the first hearing of the Veda.--We further ask, 'By  what means do you arrive at the conclusion that Scripture cannot  possibly be assumed to be defective in any way, while defects may be  ascribed to Perception'? It is certainly not Consciousness--self-proved  and absolutely devoid of all difference--which enlightens you on this  point; for such Consciousness is unrelated to any objects whatever, and  incapable of partiality to Scripture. Nor can sense-perception be the  source of your conviction; for as it is founded on what is defective it  gives perverse information. Nor again the other sources of knowledge;  for they are all based on sense-perception. As thus there are no  acknowledged means of knowledge to prove your view, you must give it up.  But, you will perhaps say, we proceed by means of the ordinary empirical  means and objects of knowledge!--What, we ask in reply, do you  understand by 'empirical'?--What rests on immediate unreflective  knowledge, but is found not to hold good when tested by logical  reasoning!--But what is the use, we ask, of knowledge of this kind? If  logical reasoning refutes something known through some means of  knowledge, that means of knowledge is no longer authoritative!--Now you  will possibly argue as follows: 'Scripture as well as Perception is  founded on Nescience; but all the same Perception is sublated by  Scripture. For as the object of Scripture, i.e. Brahman, which is one  and without a second, is not seen to be sublated by any ulterior  cognition, Brahman, i.e. pure non-differenced Consciousness, remains as  the sole Reality.'--But here too you are wrong, since we must decide  that something which rests on a defect is unreal, although it may remain  unrefuted. We will illustrate this point by an analogous instance. Let  us imagine a race of men afflicted with a certain special defect of  vision, without being aware of this their defect, dwelling in some  remote mountain caves inaccessible to all other men provided with sound  eyes. As we assume all of these cave dwellers to be afflicted with the  same defect of vision, they, all of them, will equally see and judge  bright things, e.g. the moon, to be double. Now in the case of these  people there never arises a subsequent cognition sublating their  primitive cognition; but the latter is false all the same, and its  object, viz., the doubleness of the moon, is false likewise; the defect  of vision being the cause of a cognition not corresponding to reality.--  And so it is with the cognition of Brahman also. This cognition is based  on Nescience, and therefore is false, together with its object, viz.  Brahman, although no sublating cognition presents itself.--This  conclusion admits of various expressions in logical form. 'The Brahman  under dispute is false because it is the object of knowledge which has  sprung from what is affected with Nescience; as the phenomenal world is.'  'Brahman is false because it is the object of knowledge; as the world  is.' 'Brahman is false because it is the object of knowledge, the rise  of which has the Untrue for its cause; as the world is.'    You will now perhaps set forth the following analogy. States of dreaming  consciousness--such as the perception of elephants and the like in one's  dreams--are unreal, and yet they are the cause of the knowledge of real  things, viz. good or ill fortune (portended by those dreams). Hence  there is no reason why Scripture--although unreal in so far as based on  Nescience--should not likewise be the cause of the cognition of what is  real, viz. Brahman.--The two cases are not parallel, we reply. The  conscious states experienced in dreams are not unreal; it is only their  objects that are false; these objects only, not the conscious states,  are sublated by the waking consciousness. Nobody thinks 'the cognitions  of which I was conscious in my dream are unreal'; what men actually  think is 'the cognitions are real, but the things are not real.' In the  same way the illusive state of consciousness which the magician produces  in the minds of other men by means of mantras, drugs, &c., is true, and  hence the cause of love and fear; for such states of consciousness also  are not sublated. The cognition which, owing to some defect in the  object, the sense organ, &c., apprehends a rope as a snake is real, and  hence the cause of fear and other emotions. True also is the imagination  which, owing to the nearness of a snake, arises in the mind of a man  though not actually bitten, viz. that he has been bitten; true also is  the representation of the imagined poison, for it may be the cause of  actual death. In the same way the reflection of the face in the water is  real, and hence enables us to ascertain details belonging to the real  face. All these states of consciousness are real, as we conclude from  their having a beginning and actual effects.--Nor would it avail you to  object that in the absence of real elephants, and so on, the ideas of  them cannot be real. For ideas require only _some_ substrate in general;  the mere appearance of a thing is a sufficient substrate, and such an  appearance is present in the case in question, owing to a certain defect.  The thing we determine to be unreal because it is sublated; the idea is  non-sublated, and therefore real.    Nor can you quote in favour of your view--of the real being known  through the unreal--the instance of the stroke and the letter. The  letter being apprehended through the stroke (i.e. the written character)  does not furnish a case of the real being apprehended through the unreal;  for the stroke itself is real.--But the stroke causes the idea of the  letter only in so far as it is apprehended as being a letter, and this  'being a letter' is untrue!--Not so, we rejoin. If this 'being a letter'  were unreal it could not be a means of the apprehension of the letter;  for we neither observe nor can prove that what is non-existent and  indefinable constitutes a means.--Let then the idea of the letter  constitute the means!--In that case, we rejoin, the apprehension of the  real does not spring from the unreal; and besides, it would follow  therefrom that the means and what is to be effected thereby would be one,  i.e. both would be, without any distinction, the idea of the letter only.  Moreover, if the means were constituted by the stroke in so far as it is  _not_ the letter, the apprehension of all letters would result from the  sight of one stroke; for one stroke may easily be conceived as _not_  being _any_ letter.--But, in the same way as the word 'Devadatta'  conventionally denotes some particular man, so some particular stroke  apprehended by the eye may conventionally symbolise some particular  letter to be apprehended by the ear, and thus a particular stroke may be  the cause of the idea of a particular letter!--Quite so, we reply, but  on this explanation the real is known through the real; for both stroke  and conventional power of symbolisation are real. The case is analogous  to that of the idea of a buffalo being caused by the picture of a  buffalo; that idea rests on the similarity of picture and thing  depicted, and that similarity is something real. Nor can it be said  (with a view to proving the pûrvapaksha by another analogous instance)  that we meet with a cognition of the real by means of the unreal in the  case of sound (sabda) which is essentially uniform, but causes the  apprehension of different things by means of difference of tone (nâda).  For sound is the cause of the apprehension of different things in so far  only as we apprehend the connexion of sound manifesting itself in  various tones, with the different things indicated by those various  tones [FOOTNOTE 77:1]. And, moreover, it is not correct to argue on the  ground of the uniformity of sound; for only particular significant  sounds such as 'ga,' which can be apprehended by the ear, are really  'sound.'--All this proves that it is difficult indeed to show that the  knowledge of a true thing, viz. Brahman, can be derived from Scripture,  if Scripture--as based on Nescience--is itself untrue.    Our opponent may finally argue as follows:--Scripture is not unreal in  the same sense as a sky-flower is unreal; for antecedently to the  cognition of universal non-duality Scripture is viewed as something that  _is_, and only on the rise of that knowledge it is seen to be unreal. At  this latter time Scripture no longer is a means of cognising Brahman,  devoid of all difference, consisting of pure Intelligence; as long on  the other hand as it is such a means, Scripture _is_; for then we judge  'Scripture is.'--But to this we reply that if Scripture is not (true),  the"]]]
