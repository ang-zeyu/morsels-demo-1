How could Bob possibly guess so near the truth?  She began to think that the better part of wisdom was to confide in this  keen young man.    \"Come on, Betty, tell me what you want it for, and you shall have twice  twenty-five,\" said Bob earnestly. \"I've most of my allowance in the  school bank. It's all yours, if you'll let me have an inkling of the  reason you need money.\"    \"Well,\" said Betty, slowly, \"I didn't promise I wouldn't tell--only  that I wouldn't tell Bobby or Mrs. Eustice. It's Libbie who has to have  the money.\"    She sketched Libbie's story for him rapidly, Bob listening in silence. At  the end he asked a single question.    \"Have you any of those notes asking for money?\"    \"Here's one.\" Betty thrust her hand into the pocket of her sweater and  pulled out the crumpled paper that Libbie had shaken out of the bottle  that morning.    \"Were they all written on this same kind of paper?\" asked Bob,  reading the note.    \"Ye-s, that is, I think so,\" hesitated Betty. \"I really haven't  noticed. Why?\"    \"Because I don't think any man wrote this,\" announced Bob confidently.  \"I think some girl at school has done it, either as a joke or to  torment Libbie.\"    \"But it's grown-up writing,\" protested Betty. \"Though, come to think of  it, we don't know any of the girls' handwriting,\" she added thoughtfully.    \"What girl would be likely to do it?\" asked Bob. \"Can you recall a  practical joker? This is copy book paper torn from an ordinary theme  book. Yes, I'll bet a cookie a girl wrote it.\"    \"Ada Nansen or Ruth Gladys Royal might do it to plague Libbie,\" said  Betty slowly. \"They don't like any of our crowd, and Libbie is so good  at French she turns Ada green with envy. The more I think of it, the  surer I am it is Ada. Ruth doesn't dislike any one actively enough to  exert herself.\"    \"Ada Nansen?\" repeated Bob. \"Isn't she that girl we saw on the train and  who plumped herself down in my seat? I thought so--I remember you told  me. Well, from the sidelight I have on her character, I believe she is  the one at the bottom of this. That will explain, too, why you never  catch any one digging up the bottle--she knows exactly when you are busy  and when you are not.\"    \"Bottle!\" said Betty explosively, to Bob's amazement. \"Oh, Bob! this  morning Miss Jessup was talking to us about association of ideas, and she  asked Ada what bee meant to her. We thought she'd say 'honey,' of course,  but she said 'bottle.' Doesn't that show--\"    \"I should say it did!\" Bob's voice was eager. \"She took it for the letter  'B' and bottle was in her mind. You may depend upon it, that girl is at  the back of all this fuss! Gee, when I've nothing else to do, I'm going  to study up on this association of ideas stuff.\"    \"You don't need it--you can get at things without a bit of trouble,\"  Betty assured him affectionately.    \"How will you go about pinning down Ada?\" Bob asked anxiously.    \"I'll cut out Latin to-morrow afternoon when she has a study period,\"  planned Betty. \"She'll think Libbie is reciting, and she'll not think of  me at all, and I'll slip out and watch to see if she goes near the  bottle. But what can I do if she does prove to be the right one? She'll  tell Mrs. Eustice, and poor Libbie will be in a peck of trouble. I really  think Mrs. Eustice would send her home if she knew.\"    \"And serve Libbie right for being such an idiot!\" pronounced Bob  severely. \"However, I think she has been pretty thoroughly punished  through fear. I only wish you'd told me this before, Betty, because I  know exactly how you can deal with Ada.\"    \"You do? Oh, Bob, what should I ever do without you!\" cried Betty,  forgetting that a few moments before she had berated him for his  insistence. \"Tell me, quick.\"    \"Well, a crowd of us fellows happened to be over in Edentown last Friday  night, and we saw Ada and Ruth at the movies,\" said Bob. \"They didn't see  us, for we sat back. They were the only girls from Shadyside, and Tommy  and I decided they had sneaked out after dinner and walked all that  distance. Now threatening isn't a very nice performance, Betty, but  sometimes you have to meet like with like. I think, if when you see Ada  digging up the bottle, you go to her and say that unless she returns the  money and Libbie's first note to you and promises to let the matter  drop--forever--you will expose her Edentown trip to Mrs. Eustice, she  will listen to reason.\"    \"So do I,\" agreed Betty. \"I don't think she has touched the money--she  has plenty. But I must have the note so that Libbie can destroy it. Mrs.  Eustice never lets us go to town at night, and I'm sure Ada and Ruth had  to go down the fire-escape. Goodness, didn't they take a chance of being  discovered!\"    \"Well, as I've already missed half an algebra recitation, and you know  you have no business over here at this time of day, I move we begin our  penance,\" suggested Bob. \"Paddle home, Betsey, and if our hunch turns out  wrong, we'll tackle another one.\"    \"Oh, it won't--I'm sure you're right,\" said Betty gratefully. \"Thank you  ever so much, Bob. And the next time I'll tell you everything at the  very first.\"    \"Don't let me hear of another time,\" Bob called after her, with  mock severity.    \"Well, I never!\" gasped Libbie, astonished, when Betty told her of Bob's  suspicions. \"Oh, Betty, wouldn't it be wonderful if it should be true!\"    \"I'm going to cut Latin this afternoon and find out,\" said Betty  vigorously. \"If Miss Sharpe asks for me, you don't know where I am; she  never does anything but give you double lines to translate.\"    Betty knew that Ada had a study period, which she usually spent in her  room, directly after lunch.    Directly after she left the dining room that noon Betty sped away to the  foot of the hill. There were several stubby bushes about half-filled with  wind-blown leaves and old rubbish and affording an excellent screen.  Betty crouched down behind one of these.    She had not long to wait. Ada, in her beautiful mink furs, which she  clung to persistently, though the fall weather so far had been very mild,  was presently seen coming across the grass. She walked straight to the  spot where the bottle was buried, and, stooping down, brushed away the  leaves and dirt. She lifted the bottle.    \"Pshaw, it's empty!\" she said aloud.    \"Yes, it's empty,\" echoed Betty, stepping out from behind the bush. \"And  you are to give the money back to me, and Libbie's note with it.\"    \"Is that so?\" said Ada contemptuously. \"I have something to say  about that. I intend to see that that note reaches the proper  person--Mrs. Eustice.\"    Betty took a step nearer, her dark eyes blazing.    \"I can play the kind of game you play--if I must,\" she said in a  curiously repressed tone. \"What about the trip you and Ruth Gladys made  to Edentown last Friday night?\"    Ada glared at her.    \"Were you there? How did you know?\" she stammered jerkily. \"If you were  up to the same trick, you'll look nice tattle-telling on us, won't you?\"    \"I wasn't there, but I have witnesses whom I can summon to say you  were,\" declared Betty, wishing her voice did not tremble with  nervousness. \"You were the only girls from Shadyside, and you must have  climbed down the fire--\"    Ada raised her hand that held the bottle.    \"You--you tell-tale!\" she screamed threateningly.    Betty flung up her arm to knock the bottle aside, missed Ada's hand and  hit her shoulder. Ada went down, Betty on top of her.    \"Girls! For mercy's sake!\" Miss Anderson stood beside them, scandalized.  \"Betty, get up. Ada, what are you thinking of? I saw you from the gym  windows. You'll have the whole school out here presently. Betty, I  thought you had Latin at this period?\"    \"I have,\" admitted Betty, so meekly that Miss Anderson looked away lest  she laugh. \"Only I had to see Ada.\"    \"I don't know what you were quarreling about,\" said Miss Anderson, with  characteristic frankness. \"But I do know that both of you are old enough  to know better than to revert to small-boy tactics. You've a hole in your  stocking, Betty, that would do credit to a little brother.\"    \"I ripped it on that stone,\" said Betty regretfully.    Ada stood sullenly, unconscious of two dead leaves hanging to her hat  which completely destroyed her usual effect of studied elegance.    \"Go on in, Betty,\" said the physical culture teacher, who labored under  no delusions about the duties of a peacemaker. To tell the truth, she did  not believe in forced reconciliation. \"Ada will come with me.\"    \"Ada has something I want,\" said Betty stubbornly. \"She has to promise to  give it to me first.\"    Ada looked at the resolute little figure facing her. Betty, she knew, was  capable of doing exactly what she had said. Mrs. Eustice had no more  rigid rule than the one against going to town, day or night, without  permission. Ada gave in.    \"I'll leave it in your room before dinner--you didn't think I carried it  with me, did you?\" she snapped.    \"Both?\" said Betty significantly, meaning the note and the money.    \"Everything!\" cried the exasperated Ada, on the verge of angry tears.    \"Then you have my promise never to say a word,\" Betty assured her  blithely.    \"Do you want this bottle?\" Miss Anderson called after her, as she started  for the school.    Miss Anderson had been studying both girls as she waited quietly.    Now Betty turned, smiled radiantly, and took the bottle the teacher held  out to her. With careful aim, worthy of Bob's training, she fixed her eye  on a handy rock, hurled the bottle with all her strength, and had the  satisfaction of seeing it dashed into a thousand fragments as it struck  the target squarely.    Then she trotted sedately on to her delayed recitation, and Miss Anderson  and the scowling Ada followed more slowly.    Just before dinner that night there came a knock on Betty's door,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10324"],[0,"Bull Hunter (#18)"],[1,"didn't have the nerve. But Bull that they'd always looked down on for  a big good-for-nothing hulk--Bull stepped out and took my trail on  foot and hit across the mountains in a storm, above the timberline!    \"And he followed till he come up with me here where he found me in  jail, accused of a murder. Did he turn back? He didn't. He didn't want  the law to hang me. He wanted to kill me with his own hands so's he  could go back home and hear his uncle call him a man and praise him a  little. That shows how simple he is.    \"Well, I'll cut a long story short. Bull scouted around, found out  that the sheriff had done the killing himself and just saddled the  blame on me, and then he makes the sheriff confess, gets me out of  jail, and takes me out in the woods.    \"'Now,' says he, 'you've got a gun, and I've got a gun, and I'm going  to kill you if I can.'    \"No use arguing. He goes for his gun. I didn't want to kill a man  who'd saved my life. I tried to stop him with bullets. I shot him  through the right arm and made him drop his gun. Then he charged me  barehanded!\"    There was a gasp from Manners.    \"Barehanded,\" repeated Pete. \"That's the stuff that's in him! I shot  him through the left leg. He pitched onto his face, and then hanged if  he didn't get up on one arm and one leg and throw himself at me. He  got that big arm of his around me. I couldn't do a thing. My gun was  squeezed between him and me. He started fumbling. Pretty soon he found  my throat with them big gorilla fingers of his. I thought my last  minute had come. One squeeze would have smashed my windpipe--and  good-bye, Pete Reeve!    \"But he wouldn't kill me. After I'd filled him full of lead, he let me  go. After he had the advantage he wouldn't take it.\" Pete choked. He  concluded briefly, \"He mighty near bled to death before I could get  the wounds bandaged, and then I stayed on here and nursed him. Matter  of fact, Manners, he saved my life twice and that's why I'm tied to  him for life. Besides, between you and me, he means more to me than  the rest of the world put together.\"    \"Listen,\" said Manners, after a pause. \"I see what you mean and I'll  tell you what you got to do. That big boy will do anything you tell  him. He follers you with his eyes. Well, we'll find a hoss that will  carry him. I guarantee that. Then you put your game up to him, best  foot forward, and he'll come with us.\"    \"Not in a thousand years,\" said Pete with emotion. \"That boy will  never go crooked if I can keep him straight. Do you know what he's  done? Because his uncle and cousins tried to get me, he's sworn never  to see one of 'em again. He's given them up--his own flesh and  blood--to follow me, and I'm going to stick to him. That's complete  and final.\"    \"No, Pete, of all the fools--\"    Bull waited to hear no more. He stole back to the table on the far  side of the room sick at heart and sat down to think or try to think.    The truth came to him slowly. Pete Reeve, whom he had taken as his  ideal, was, as a matter of fact--he dared not think what! The blow  shook him to the center. But he had been living on the charity of  Reeve. He had been draining the resources of the generous fellow.  And how would he ever be able to pay him back?    One thing was definite. He must put an end to any increase of the  obligations. He must leave.    The moment the thought came to him he tore a flyleaf out of the book  and wrote in his big, sprawling hand:      _Dear Pete:_      _I have to tell you that it has just occurred to me that you    have been paying all the bills, and I've been paying none. That    has to stop, and the only way for me to stop it is to go off    all by myself. I hate to sneak away, but if I stay to say    good-bye I know you'll argue me out of it because I'm no good    at an argument. Good-bye and good luck, and remember that I'm    not forgetting anything that has happened; that when I have    enough money to pay you back I'm coming to find you if I have    to travel all the way around the world._      _Your pardner,      BULL_    That done, he paused a moment, tempted to tear up the little slip. But  the original impulse prevailed. He put the paper on the table, picked  up his hat, and stole slowly from the room.          CHAPTER 13      He went out the back door of the hotel so that few people might mark  his leaving, and cut for the woods. Once in them, he changed his  direction to the east, heading for the lower, rolling hills in that  direction. He turned back when the lights of the town had drawn into  one small, glimmering ray. Then this, too, went out, and with it the  pain of leaving Pete Reeve became acute. He felt lost and alone, that  keen mind had guided him so long. As he stalked along with the great  swinging strides through the darkness, the holster rubbed on his thigh  and he remembered Pete. Truly he had come into the hands of Pete Reeve  a child, and he was leaving him as a man.    The dawn found him forty miles away and still swinging strongly down  the winding road. It was better country now. The desert sand had  disappeared, and here the soil supported a good growth of grass that  would fatten the cattle. It was a cheerful country in more ways than  the greenness of the grass, however. There were no high mountains, but  a continual smooth rolling of hills, so that the landscape varied with  every half-mile he traveled. And every now and then he had to jump a  runlet of water that murmured across his trail.    A pleasant country, a clear sky, and a cool wind touching at his face.  The contentment of Bull Hunter increased with every step he took. He  had diminished the sharpness of his hunger by taking up a few links of  his belt, but he was glad when he saw smoke twisting over a hill and  came, on the other side, in view of a crossroads village. He fingered  the few pieces of silver in his pocket. That would be enough for  breakfast, at least.    It was enough; barely that and no more, for the long walk had made him  ravenous, and the keenness of his spirits served to put a razor edge  on an appetite which was already sharp. He began eating before the  regular breakfast at the little hotel was ready. He ate while the  other men were present. He was still eating when they left.    \"How much?\" he said when he was done.    His host scratched his head.    \"I figure three times a regular meal ought to be about it,\" he said.  \"Even then it don't cover everything; but matter of fact, I'm ashamed  to charge any more.\"    His ruefulness changed to a grin when he had the money in his hand,  and Bull Hunter rose from the table.    \"But you got something to feed, son,\" he said. \"You certainly got  something to feed. And--is what the boys are saying right?\"    It came to Bull that while he sat at the table there had been many  curious glances directed toward him, and a humming whisper had passed  around the table more than once. But he was accustomed to these side  glances and murmurs, and he had paid no attention. Besides, food had  been before him.    \"I don't know. What do they say?\"    \"That you're Dunbar from the South--Hal Dunbar.\"    \"That's not my name,\" said Bull. \"My name is Hunter.\"    \"I guess they were wrong,\" said the other. \"Trouble is, every time  anybody sees a big man they say, 'There goes Hal Dunbar.' But you're  too big even to be Dunbar I reckon.\"    He surveyed the bulk of Bull Hunter with admiring respect. This  personal survey embarrassed the big man. He would have withdrawn, but  his host followed with his conversation.    \"We know Dunbar is coming up this way, though. He sent the word on up  that he's going to come to ride Diablo. I guess you've heard  about Diablo?\"    Bull averred that he had not, and his eyes went restlessly down the  road. It wove in long curves, delightfully white with the bordering of  green on either side. He could see it almost tossing among the far-off  hills. Now was the time of all times for walking, and if Pete Reeve  started to trail him this morning, he would need to put as much  distance behind him by night as his long legs could cover. But still  the hotel proprietor hung beside him. He wanted to make the big man  talk. It was possible that there might be in him a story as big as  his body.    \"So you ain't heard of Diablo? Devil is the right name for him. Black  as night and meaner'n a mountain lion. That's Diablo. He's big enough  and strong enough to carry even you. Account of him being so strong,  that's why Dunbar wants him.\"    \"Big enough and strong enough to carry me?\" repeated Bull Hunter.    He had had unfortunate experiences trying to ride horses. His weight  crushed down their quarters and made them walk with braced legs. To be  sure, that was up in the high mountains where the horses were little  more than ponies.    \"Yep. Big enough. He's kind of a freak hoss, you see. Runs to almost  seventeen hands, I've heard tell, though I ain't seen him. He's over  to the Bridewell place yonder in the hills--along about fifteen miles  by the road, I figure. He run till he was three without ever being  taken up, and he got wild as a mustang. They never was good on  managing on the Bridewell place, you see? And then when they tried to  break him he started doing some breaking on his own account. They say  he can jump about halfway to the sky and come down stiff-legged in a  way that snaps your neck near off. I seen young Huniker along about a  month after he tried to ride Diablo. Huniker was a pretty good rider,  by all accounts, but he was sure a sick gent around hosses after  Diablo got through with him. Scared of a ten-year-old mare, Huniker  was, after Diablo finished with him. Scott Porter tried him, too. That  was a fight! Lasted close onto an hour, they say, nip and tuck all the  way. Diablo wasn't bucking all the time. No, he ain't that way. He  waits in between spells till he's thought up something new to do. And  he's always thinking, they say. But if "]]]
