How unfortunate it is that you are in love with her!\"    \"True,\" he answered sadly, \"it is indeed my misfortune. If I did not  love her, it would be none of my business what the King did to his  niece Gloria; but the unlucky circumstance of my loving her makes it my  duty to defend her.\"    \"I don't see how you can, duty or no duty,\" observed Trot.    \"No; I am powerless, for they are stronger than I. But we might peek in  through the window and see what they are doing.\"    Trot was somewhat curious, too, so they crept up to one of the windows  and looked in, and it so happened that those inside the witch's house  were so busy they did not notice that Pon and Trot were watching them.    Gloria had been tied to a stout post in the center of the room and the  King was giving the Wicked Witch a quantity of money and jewels, which  Googly-Goo had provided in payment. When this had been done the King  said to her:    \"Are you perfectly sure you can freeze this maiden's heart, so that she  will no longer love that low gardener's boy?\"    \"Sure as witchcraft, your Majesty,\" the creature replied.    \"Then get to work,\" said the King. \"There may be some unpleasant  features about the ceremony that would annoy me, so I'll bid you good  day and leave you to carry out your contract. One word, however: If you  fail, I shall burn you at the stake!\" Then he beckoned to his soldiers  to follow him, and throwing wide the door of the house walked out.    This action was so sudden that King Krewl almost caught Trot and Pon  eavesdropping, but they managed to run around the house before he saw  them. Away he marched, up the road, followed by his men, heartlessly  leaving Gloria to the mercies of old Blinkie.    When they again crept up to the window, Trot and Pon saw Blinkie  gloating over her victim. Although nearly fainting from fear, the proud  Princess gazed with haughty defiance into the face of the wicked  creature; but she was bound so tightly to the post that she could do no  more to express her loathing.    Pretty soon Blinkie went to a kettle that was swinging by a chain over  the fire and tossed into it several magical compounds. The kettle gave  three flashes, and at every flash another witch appeared in the room.    These hags were very ugly but when one-eyed Blinkie whispered her  orders to them they grinned with joy as they began dancing around  Gloria. First one and then another cast something into the kettle, when  to the astonishment of the watchers at the window all three of the old  women were instantly transformed into maidens of exquisite beauty,  dressed in the daintiest costumes imaginable. Only their eyes could not  be disguised, and an evil glare still shone in their depths. But if the  eyes were cast down or hidden, one could not help but admire these  beautiful creatures, even with the knowledge that they were mere  illusions of witchcraft.    Trot certainly admired them, for she had never seen anything so dainty  and bewitching, but her attention was quickly drawn to their deeds  instead of their persons, and then horror replaced admiration. Into the  kettle old Blinkie poured another mess from a big brass bottle she took  from a chest, and this made the kettle begin to bubble and smoke  violently. One by one the beautiful witches approached to stir the  contents of the kettle and to mutter a magic charm. Their movements  were graceful and rhythmic and the Wicked Witch who had called them to  her aid watched them with an evil grin upon her wrinkled face.    Finally the incantation was complete. The kettle ceased bubbling and  together the witches lifted it from the fire. Then Blinkie brought a  wooden ladle and filled it from the contents of the kettle. Going with  the spoon to Princess Gloria she cried:    \"Love no more! Magic art Now will freeze your mortal heart!\"    With this she dashed the contents of the ladle full upon Gloria's  breast.    Trot saw the body of the Princess become transparent, so that her  beating heart showed plainly. But now the heart turned from a vivid red  to gray, and then to white. A layer of frost formed about it and tiny  icicles clung to its surface. Then slowly the body of the girl became  visible again and the heart was hidden from view. Gloria seemed to have  fainted, but now she recovered and, opening her beautiful eyes, stared  coldly and without emotion at the group of witches confronting her.    Blinkie and the others knew by that one cold look that their charm had  been successful. They burst into a chorus of wild laughter and the  three beautiful ones began dancing again, while Blinkie unbound the  Princess and set her free.    Trot rubbed her eyes to prove that she was wide awake and seeing  clearly, for her astonishment was great when the three lovely maidens  turned into ugly, crooked hags again, leaning on broomsticks and canes.  They jeered at Gloria, but the Princess regarded them with cold  disdain. Being now free, she walked to a door, opened it and passed  out. And the witches let her go.    Trot and Pon had been so intent upon this scene that in their eagerness  they had pressed quite hard against the window. Just as Gloria went out  of the house the window-sash broke loose from its fastenings and fell  with a crash into the room. The witches uttered a chorus of screams and  then, seeing that their magical incantation had been observed, they  rushed for the open window with uplifted broomsticks and canes. But Pon  was off like the wind, and Trot followed at his heels. Fear lent them  strength to run, to leap across ditches, to speed up the hills and to  vault the low fences as a deer would.    The band of witches had dashed through the window in pursuit; but  Blinkie was so old, and the others so crooked and awkward, that they  soon realized they would be unable to overtake the fugitives. So the  three who had been summoned by the Wicked Witch put their canes or  broomsticks between their legs and flew away through the air, quickly  disappearing against the blue sky. Blinkie, however, was so enraged at  Pon and Trot that she hobbled on in the direction they had taken, fully  determined to catch them, in time, and to punish them terribly for  spying upon her witchcraft.    When Pon and Trot had run so far that they were confident they had made  good their escape, they sat down near the edge of a forest to get their  breath again, for both were panting hard from their exertions. Trot was  the first to recover speech, and she said to her companion:    \"My! wasn't it terr'ble?\"    \"The most terrible thing I ever saw,\" Pon agreed.    \"And they froze Gloria's heart; so now she can't love you any more.\"    \"Well, they froze her heart, to be sure,\" admitted Pon, \"but I'm in  hopes I can melt it with my love.\"    \"Where do you s'pose Gloria is?\" asked the girl, after a pause.    \"She left the witch's house just before we did. Perhaps she has gone  back to the King's castle,\" he said.    \"I'm pretty sure she started off in a diff'rent direction,\" declared  Trot. \"I looked over my shoulder, as I ran, to see how close the  witches were, and I'm sure I saw Gloria walking slowly away toward the  north.\"    \"Then let us circle around that way,\" proposed Pon, \"and perhaps we  shall meet her.\"    Trot agreed to this and they left the grove and began to circle around  toward the north, thus drawing nearer and nearer to old Blinkie's house  again. The Wicked Witch did not suspect this change of direction, so  when she came to the grove she passed through it and continued on.    Pon and Trot had reached a place less than half a mile from the witch's  house when they saw Gloria walking toward them. The Princess moved with  great dignity and with no show of haste whatever, holding her head high  and looking neither to right nor left.    Pon rushed forward, holding out his arms as if to embrace her and  calling her sweet names. But Gloria gazed upon him coldly and repelled  him with a haughty gesture. At this the poor gardener's boy sank upon  his knees and hid his face in his arms, weeping bitter tears; but the  Princess was not at all moved by his distress. Passing him by, she drew  her skirts aside, as if unwilling they should touch him, and then she  walked up the path a way and hesitated, as if uncertain where to go  next.    Trot was grieved by Pon's sobs and indignant because Gloria treated him  so badly. But she remembered why.    \"I guess your heart is frozen, all right,\" she said to the Princess.  Gloria nodded gravely, in reply, and then turned her back upon the  little girl. \"Can't you like even me?\" asked Trot, half pleadingly.    \"No,\" said Gloria.    \"Your voice sounds like a refrig'rator,\" sighed the little girl. \"I'm  awful sorry for you, 'cause you were sweet an' nice to me before this  happened. You can't help it, of course; but it's a dreadful thing, jus'  the same.\"    \"My heart is frozen to all mortal loves,\" announced Gloria, calmly. \"I  do not love even myself.\"    \"That's too bad,\" said Trot, \"for, if you can't love anybody, you can't  expect anybody to love you.\"    \"I do!\" cried Pon. \"I shall always love her.\"    \"Well, you're just a gardener's boy,\" replied Trot, \"and I didn't think  you 'mounted to much, from the first. I can love the old Princess  Gloria, with a warm heart an' nice manners, but this one gives me the  shivers.\"    \"It's her icy heart, that's all,\" said Pon.    \"That's enough,\" insisted Trot. \"Seeing her heart isn't big enough to  skate on, I can't see that she's of any use to anyone. For my part, I'm  goin' to try to find Button-Bright an' Cap'n Bill.\"    \"I will go with you,\" decided Pon. \"It is evident that Gloria no longer  loves me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/959"],[0,"The Lost Princess of Oz (#17)"],[1," although the Tin Woodman is  not to blame for punishing you.\"    \"What is he mumbling about?\" asked the Frogman.    \"He is talking to me, but you don't understand him,\" she replied.  And  then she told him of the ferryman's punishment and afterward explained  to the ferryman that they wanted to stay all night with him and be fed.    He gave them some fruit and bread, which was the only sort of food he  had, and he allowed Cayke to sleep in a room of his cottage. But the  Frogman he refused to admit to his house, saying that the frog's  presence made him miserable and unhappy.  At no time would he look  directly at the Frogman, or even toward him, fearing he would shed  tears if he did so; so the big frog slept on the riverbank where he  could hear little frogs croaking in the river all the night through.  But that did not keep him awake; it merely soothed him to slumber, for  he realized how much superior he was to them.    Just as the sun was rising on a new day, the ferryman rowed the two  travelers across the river--keeping his back to the Frogman all the  way--and then Cayke thanked him and bade him goodbye and the ferryman  rowed home again.    On this side of the river, there were no paths at all, so it was  evident they had reached a part of the country little frequented by  travelers.  There was a marsh at the south of them, sandhills at the  north, and a growth of scrubby underbrush leading toward a forest at  the east.  So the east was really the least difficult way to go, and  that direction was the one they had determined to follow.    Now the Frogman, although he wore green patent-leather shoes with ruby  buttons, had very large and flat feet, and when he tramped through the  scrub, his weight crushed down the underbrush and made a path for Cayke  to follow him.  Therefore they soon reached the forest, where the tall  trees were set far apart but were so leafy that they shaded all the  spaces between them with their branches.  \"There are no bushes here,\"  said Cayke, much pleased, \"so we can now travel faster and with more  comfort.\"          CHAPTER 15    THE BIG LAVENDER BEAR      It was a pleasant place to wander, and the two travelers were  proceeding at a brisk pace when suddenly a voice shouted, \"Halt!\"    They looked around in surprise, seeing at first no one at all.  Then  from behind a tree there stepped a brown, fuzzy bear whose head came  about as high as Cayke's waist--and Cayke was a small woman.  The bear  was chubby as well as fuzzy; his body was even puffy, while his legs  and arms seemed jointed at the knees and elbows and fastened to his  body by pins or rivets.  His ears were round in shape and stuck out in  a comical way, while his round, black eyes were bright and sparkling as  beads.  Over his shoulder the little brown bear bore a gun with a tin  barrel.  The barrel had a cork in the end of it, and a string was  attached to the cork and to the handle of the gun.  Both the Frogman  and Cayke gazed hard at this curious bear, standing silent for some  time.  But finally the Frogman recovered from his surprise and  remarked, \"It seems to me that you are stuffed with sawdust and ought  not to be alive.\"    \"That's all you know about it,\" answered the little Brown Bear in a  squeaky voice.  \"I am stuffed with a very good quality of curled hair,  and my skin is the best plush that was ever made.  As for my being  alive, that is my own affair and cannot concern you at all, except that  it gives me the privilege to say you are my prisoners.\"    \"Prisoners!  Why do you speak such nonsense?\" the Frogman angrily.  \"Do  you think we are afraid of a toy bear with a toy gun?\"    \"You ought to be,\" was the confident reply, \"for I am merely the sentry  guarding the way to Bear Center, which is a city containing hundreds of  my race, who are ruled by a very powerful sorcerer known as the  Lavender Bear.  He ought to be a purple color, you know, seeing he is a  King, but he's only light lavender, which is, of course, second cousin  to royal purple.  So unless you come with me peaceably as my prisoners,  I shall fire my gun and bring a hundred bears of all sizes and colors  to capture you.\"    \"Why do you wish to capture us?\" inquired the Frogman, who had listened  to his speech with much astonishment.    \"I don't wish to, as a matter of fact,\" replied the little Brown Bear,  \"but it is my duty to, because you are now trespassing on the domain of  His Majesty, the King of Bear Center.  Also, I will admit that things  are rather quiet in our city just now, and the excitement of your  capture, followed by your trial and execution, should afford us much  entertainment.\"    \"We defy you!\" said the Frogman.    \"Oh no, don't do that,\" pleaded Cayke, speaking to her companion.  \"He  says his King is a sorcerer, so perhaps it is he or one of his bears  who ventured to steal my jeweled dishpan.  Let us go to the City of the  Bears and discover if my dishpan is there.\"    \"I must now register one more charge against you,\" remarked the little  Brown Bear with evident satisfaction.  \"You have just accused us of  stealing, and that is such a dreadful thing to say that I am quite sure  our noble King will command you to be executed.\"    \"But how could you execute us?\" inquired the Cookie Cook.    \"I've no idea. But our King is a wonderful inventor, and there is no  doubt he can find a proper way to destroy you.  So tell me, are you  going to struggle, or will you go peaceably to meet your doom?\"    It was all so ridiculous that Cayke laughed aloud, and even the  Frogman's wide mouth curled in a smile.  Neither was a bit afraid to go  to the Bear City, and it seemed to both that there was a possibility  they might discover the missing dishpan.  So the Frogman said, \"Lead  the way, little Bear, and we will follow without a struggle.\"    \"That's very sensible of you, very sensible indeed,\" declared the Brown  Bear.  \"So for-ward, MARCH!\" And with the command he turned around and  began to waddle along a path that led between the trees.    Cayke and the Frogman, as they followed their conductor, could scarce  forbear laughing at his stiff, awkward manner of walking, and although  he moved his stuffy legs fast, his steps were so short that they had to  go slowly in order not to run into him. But after a time they reached a  large, circular space in the center of the forest, which was clear of  any stumps or underbrush.  The ground was covered by a soft, gray moss,  pleasant to tread upon.  All the trees surrounding this space seemed to  be hollow and had round holes in their trunks, set a little way above  the ground, but otherwise there was nothing unusual about the place and  nothing, in the opinion of the prisoners, to indicate a settlement.  But the little Brown Bear said in a proud and impressive voice  (although it still squeaked), \"This is the wonderful city known to fame  as Bear Center!\"    \"But there are no houses, there are no bears living here at all!\"  exclaimed Cayke.    \"Oh indeed!\" retorted their captor, and raising his gun he pulled the  trigger.  The cork flew out of the tin barrel with a loud \"pop!\" and at  once from every hole in every tree within view of the clearing appeared  the head of a bear.  They were of many colors and of many sizes, but  all were made in the same manner as the bear who had met and captured  them.    At first a chorus of growls arose, and then a sharp voice cried, \"What  has happened, Corporal Waddle?\"    \"Captives, Your Majesty!\" answered the Brown Bear.  \"Intruders upon our  domain and slanderers of our good name.\"    \"Ah, that's important,\" answered the voice.    Then from out the hollow trees tumbled a whole regiment of stuffed  bears, some carrying tin swords, some popguns and others long spears  with gay ribbons tied to the handles.  There were hundreds of them,  altogether, and they quietly formed a circle around the Frogman and the  Cookie Cook, but kept at a distance and left a large space for the  prisoners to stand in.  Presently, this circle parted, and into the  center of it stalked a huge toy bear of a lovely lavender color.  He  walked upon his hind legs, as did all the others, and on his head he  wore a tin crown set with diamonds and amethysts, while in one paw he  carried a short wand of some glittering metal that resembled silver but  wasn't.    \"His Majesty the King!\" Corporal Waddle, and all the bears bowed low.  Some bowed so low that they lost their balance and toppled over, but  they soon scrambled up again, and the Lavender King squatted on his  haunches before the prisoners and gazed at them steadily with his  bright, pink eyes.          CHAPTER 16    THE LITTLE PINK BEAR      \"One Person and one Freak,\" said the big Lavender Bear when he had  carefully examined the strangers.    \"I am sorry to hear you call poor Cayke the Cookie Cook a Freak,\"  remonstrated the Frogman.    \"She is the Person,\" asserted the King.  \"Unless I am mistaken, it is  you who are the Freak.\"    The Frogman was silent, for he could not truthfully deny it.    \"Why have you dared intrude in my forest?\" demanded the Bear King.    \"We didn't know it was your forest,\" said Cayke, \"and we are on our way  to the far east, where the Emerald City is.\"    \"Ah, it's a long way from here to the Emerald City,\" remarked the King.  \"It is so far away, indeed, that no bear among us has even been there.  But what errand requires you to travel such a distance?\"    \"Someone has stolen my diamond-studded gold dishpan,\" explained Cayke,  \"and as I cannot be happy without it, I have decided to search the  world over until I find it again.  The Frogman, who is very learned and  wonderfully wise, has come with me to give me his assistance. Isn't it  kind of him?\"    The King looked at the Frogman.    \"What makes you so wonderfully wise?\" he asked.    \"I'm not,\" was the candid reply.  \"The Cookie Cook and some others in  the Yip Country think because I am a big frog and talk and act like a"]]]
