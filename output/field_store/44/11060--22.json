His contrition of soul was as great as a man could well live  through.\" [191] The last sentence shows beyond dispute that Mother Lucy  had her doubts about this silly story she has just narrated, and, of  course, we are entitled to similar doubts.    [Footnote 191: Mother Lucy's life of \"Joseph Smith the Prophet,\" 195  and 196. As to Rigdon's declaration that the keys were gone, see also  14 _Deseret News,_ 91, December 21, 1864. As to Rigdon's being dragged  out of bed, see also History of the Mormons, 53.]    What really did happen is made very plain by subsequent occurrences.  Smith and Rigdon got together, patched up their differences by an  agreement that Rigdon should have a house if he would restore the  \"keys\" to the last dispensation, and desist from executing his threats  to smash the \"Kingdom,\" and for the sake of its wholesome influence  upon others he must play penitent and humble. As evidence of this  conclusion we point to the story of this transaction as quoted above  from Mother Lucy's life of the \"Prophet,\" and the two following  sections of a revelation announced by Smith under date of August, 1831:        \"Behold, verily I say unto you, I the Lord am not pleased with my      servant Sidney Rigdon. He exalted himself in his heart and received      not my counsel, but grieved the Spirit.\" \"Let my servants Joseph      Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon seek them a house as they are taught      through prayer by the Spirit.\" [192]    [Footnote 192: Doctrine and Covenants, 63:55 and 65.]    It is needless to add they each received a house, and both stood for  many years, and perhaps even to this day, side by side, and both built  according to the same plans. [193]    [Footnote 193: \"Gleanings by the Way,\" 332.]    CONCLUDING COMMENT.    The case, so far as the production of evidence is concerned, must now  be considered closed. The actors in this fraud are all dead, and upon  the precise question here discussed no new evidence is likely to be  discovered. All the evidence directly affecting either side of the  question has been introduced and reviewed.    When, as here, we are investigating a case dependent upon  circumstantial evidence, we must judge the evidence as a whole. No  one circumstance out of many connected ones ever established the  ultimate fact. The converse of this proposition is equally true. You  cannot show the insufficiency of the evidence by demonstrating that  any one circumstance, if it stood alone, would be equally consistent  with some other theory than the one in support of which it is cited.  The evidentiary circumstances must be viewed as a whole, each in the  light of its relation to all the rest. Thus viewed, the circumstantial  evidence is strong just in proportion as the circumstances related  to, and consistent with, the theory advocated are numerous. In the  argument under consideration the circumstantial facts are so numerous,  and gathered from so many disconnected sources, corroborated by so many  admissions from the accused conspirators and their defenders, that it  is utterly impossible to believe them all to have come into being as a  mere matter of accidental concomitance.    Let us put the defenders of the divinity of Mormonism to a test on this  matter by inviting them to make an equally good case of circumstantial  evidence based upon established fact, all tending to show some other  human origin for the Book of Mormon than that here advocated. Inability  to do so means that such an array of concurring facts cannot be  duplicated in support of any other theory than the one here advocated.  If, as must now be admitted, the concurrence of so very many facts can  best be explained by the conclusions here contended for, then that is a  more believable, a more rational conviction than one which of necessity  requires belief in an assumed and unprovable miracle. That explanation  which takes the least for granted is always the one adopted by the  sanest person. Bearing in mind these truths, let us briefly review a  portion of the most salient features of the argument.    From the uncontradicted evidence of witnesses, practically all of whom  are disinterested and who in most circumstances of great evidentiary  weight are corroborated by authorized church publications, we have  established beyond cavil, and I am sure to the satisfaction of all  thinking minds untainted by mysticism, and whose vision is unobscured,  that the following are thoroughly established facts:    Solomon Spaulding, between 1812 and 1816, outlined and then re-wrote  a novel, attempting therein to account for the American Indian by  Israelitish origin. The first outline of this story, now at Oberlin  College, had no direct connection with the Book of Mormon, and was  never claimed to be connected with it, and such connection was  expressly disclaimed as early as 1834. The rewritten story, entitled  \"Manuscript Found,\" was by Spaulding twice left with a publisher,  whence it was stolen under circumstances which then led Spaulding  to suspect Sidney Rigdon, who long after was the first conspicuous  convert of Mormonism; that Rigdon, through his great intimacy with the  publishers' employees, had opportunity to steal it, and that after  Spaulding's death, and years before the advent of Mormonism, Rigdon  had in his possession such a manuscript and exhibited it, with the  statement that it was Spaulding's. Through Parley P. Pratt, Rigdon  and Smith were brought into relation, and the latter made the Prophet  of the \"Dispensation of the Fullness of Times,\" the discoverer,  translator, and, according to his own designation, the \"Author and  Proprietor\" [194] of the Book of Mormon. This connection is established  by the most convincing circumstantial evidence, taken wholly from  authorized Mormon publications; it is shown that Rigdon foreknew the  coming and in a general way the contents of the Book of Mormon; that  both Rigdon and Pratt were, according to some of their contradictory  accounts, converted to Mormonism with such miraculous suddenness and  without substantial investigation that when this, coupled with the  contradictory accounts of these important events and their attempts at  concealing the suddenness of their conversion, all compel a conviction  of their participation in a scheme of religious fraud.    [Footnote 194: Smith designates himself as the \"Author and Proprietor\"  of God's word, in the Title Page of the Book of Mormon, also in the  testimony of the witnesses as it appears in the first edition, since  which time both have been altered. See also _Evening and Morning Star,_  117.]    Upon the question of plagiarism, we may profitably add a brief summary  of the points of identity between the peculiar features shown to be  common to Spaulding's novel and the Book of Mormon. In Spaulding's  first outline of the story it pretended to be ancient American history,  attempting to explain the origin of part of the aborigines of this  continent, all translated from ancient writings found in a stone  box. It recounts the wars of extermination of two factions, tells  of the collecting of armies and of slaughters which were a physical  impossibility to those uncivilized people who were without any modern  methods of transporting troops or army supplies. After two revisions,  one by Spaulding and a second by Smith, Rigdon & Co., the above general  outline still describes equally well the Book of Mormon.    Leaving the first blocking-out of his novel unfinished, Spaulding  resolved to change his plot by dating the story farther back and by  attempting to imitate the Old Scripture style, so as to make it seem  more ancient. Spaulding's determination to date his novel farther back  probably suggested changing the roll of parchment which, according to  the Oberlin manuscript, was found in a stone box, to golden plates.  Some time before 1820 some one pretended to have found a Golden Bible  in Canada. [195] If Spaulding, in rewriting the story, did not make the  change, this incident may have suggested such a change to Smith and his  fellow-frauds.    [Footnote 195: Braden-Kelly Debate, 55.]    Spaulding, in his attempt at imitating Bible phraseology, had repeated  so ridiculously often the words \"it came to pass,\" that both in Ohio  and Pennsylvania the neighbors to whom he read his manuscript nicknamed  him \"Old Come-to-pass.\" In the Book of Mormon, though professedly an  abridgment, the same phrase is uselessly repeated several thousand  times, and a bungling effort at imitating the style of Bible writers is  apparent all through it.    Spaulding's existence was contemporaneous with Anti-Masonic riots, and  he harbored a sentiment against all secret societies, [196] which has  also been carried through into the Book of Mormon.    [Footnote 196: \"Howe's Mormonism Unveiled,\" 288.]    The uncontradicted and unimpeached evidence of many witnesses is  explicit that the historical portions of both the \"Manuscript Found\"  and the \"Book of Mormon\" are the same, and much of the religious matter  interpolated is in the exact phraseology of King James's translation of  the Bible. We find also many names of places, persons, and tribes to  be identical in the \"Manuscript Found\" and the Book of Mormon. Some of  the names were taken from the Bible, others would be known only to the  students of American antiquities, among whom was Spaulding, and still  others were unheard of until coined by Spaulding. The names proven to  be common to both are Nephi, Lehi, Mormon, Nephites, Lamanites, Laban,  Zarahemla and Amlicites.    Add to this the very novel circumstance that in both accounts one of  two contending armies placed upon the forehead of its soldiers a red  mark that they might distinguish friends from enemies, and the new and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/529"],[0,"Knights of Art: Stories of the Italian Painters (#17)"],[1,"he may.'    The letter was written in curious writing from right to left like  Hebrew or Arabic. This was how Leonardo always wrote, using his left  hand, so that it could only be read by holding the writing up to a  mirror.    The Duke was half amazed and half amused when the letter reached him.    'Either these are the words of a fool, or of a man of genius,' said the  Duke. And when he had once seen and spoken to Leonardo he saw at once  which of the two he deserved to be called.    Every one at the court was charmed with the artist's beautiful face and  graceful manners. His music alone, as he swept the strings of the  silver lute and sang to it his own songs, would have brought him fame,  but the Duke quickly saw that this was no mere minstrel.    It was soon arranged therefore that Leonardo should take up his abode  at the court of Milan and receive a yearly pension from the Duke.    Sometimes the pension was paid, and sometimes it was forgotten, but  Leonardo never troubled about money matters. Somehow or other he must  have all that he wanted, and everything must be fair and dainty. His  clothes were always rich and costly, but never bright-coloured or  gaudy. There was no plume or jewelled brooch in his black velvet  beretto or cap, and the only touch of colour was his golden hair, and  the mantle of dark red cloth which he wore in the fashion of the  Florentines, thrown across his shoulder. Above all, he must always have  horses in his stables, for he loved them more than human beings.    Many were the plans and projects which the Duke entrusted to Leonardo's  care, but of all that he did, two great works stand out as greater than  all the rest. One was the painting of the Last Supper on the walls of  the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie, and the other the making of  a model of a great equestrian statue, a bronze horse with the figure of  the Duke upon its back.    'Year after year Leonardo worked at that wonderful fresco of the Last  Supper. Sometimes for weeks or months he never touched it, but he  always returned to it again. Then for days he would work from morning  till night, scarcely taking time to eat, and able to think of nothing  else, until suddenly he would put down his brushes and stand silently  for a long, long time before the picture. It seemed as if he was  wasting the precious hours doing nothing, but in truth he worked more  diligently with his brain when his hands were idle.    Often too when he worked at the model for the great bronze horse, he  would suddenly stop, and walk quickly through the streets until he came  to the refectory, and there, catching up his brushes, he would paint in  one or perhaps two strokes, and then return to his modelling.    Besides all this Leonardo was busy with other plans for the Duke's  amusement, and no court fete was counted successful without his help.  Nothing seemed too difficult for him to contrive, and what he did was  always new and strange and wonderful.    Once when the King of France came as a guest to Milan, Leonardo  prepared a curious model of a lion, which by some inside machinery was  able to walk forward several steps to meet the King, and then open wide  its huge jaws and display inside a bed of sweet-scented lilies, the  emblem of France, to do honour to her King. But while working at other  things Leonardo never forgot his longing to learn the secret art of  flying. Every now and then a new idea would come into his head, and he  would lay aside all other work until he had made the new machine which  might perhaps act as the wings of a bird. Each fresh disappointment  only made him more keen to try again.    'I know we shall some day have wings,' he said to his pupils, who  sometimes wondered at the strange work of the master's hands. 'It is  only a question of knowing how to make them. I remember once when I was  a baby lying in my cradle, I fancied a bird flew to me, opened my lips  and rubbed its feathers over them. So it seems to be my fate all my  life to talk of wings.'    Very slowly the great fresco of the Last Supper grew under the master's  hand until it was nearly finished. The statue, too, was almost  completed, and then evil days fell upon Milan. The Duke was obliged to  flee before the French soldiers, who forced their way into the town and  took possession of it. Before any one could prevent it, the soldiers  began to shoot their arrows at the great statue, which they used as a  target, and in a few hours the work of sixteen years was utterly  destroyed. It is sadder still to tell the fate of Leonardo's fresco,  the greatest picture perhaps that ever was painted. Dampness lurked in  the wall and began to dim and blur the colours. The careless monks cut  a door through the very centre of the picture, and, later on, when  Napoleon's soldiers entered Milan, they used the refectory as a stable,  and amused themselves by throwing stones at what remained of it. But  though little of it is left now to be seen, there is still enough to  make us stand in awe and reverence before the genius of the great  master.    Not far from Milan there lived a friend of Leonardo's, whom the master  loved to visit. This Girolamo Melzi had a son called Francesco, a  little motherless boy, who adored the great painter with all his heart.    Together Leonardo and the child used to wander out to search for  curious animals and rare flowers, and as they watched the spiders weave  their webs and pulled the flowers to pieces to find out their secrets,  the boy listened with wide wondering eyes to all the tales which the  painter told him. And at night Leonardo wrapped the little one close  inside his warm cloak and carried him out to see the stars--those same  stars which old Toscanelli had taught him to love long ago in Florence.  Then when the day of parting came the child clung round the master's  neck and would not let him go.    'Take me with thee,' he cried, 'do not leave me behind all alone.'    'I cannot take thee now, little one,' said Leonardo gently. 'Thou art  still too small, but later on thou shalt come to me and be my pupil.  This I promise thee.'    It was but a weary wandering life that awaited Leonardo after he was  forced to leave his home in Milan. It seemed as if it was his fate to  begin many things but to finish nothing. For a while he lived in Rome,  but he did little real work there.    For several years he lived in Florence and began to paint a huge  battle-picture. There too he painted the famous portrait of Mona Lisa,  which is now in Paris. Of all portraits that have ever been painted  this is counted the most wonderful and perfect piece of work, although  Leonardo himself called it unfinished.    By this time the master had fallen on evil days. All his pupils were  gone, and his friends seemed to have forgotten him. He was sitting  before the fire one stormy night, lonely and sad, when the door opened  and a tall handsome lad came in.    'Master!' he cried, and kneeling down he kissed the old man's hands.  'Dost thou not know me? I am thy little Francesco, come to claim thy  promise that I should one day be thy servant and pupil.    Leonardo laid his hand upon the boy's fair head and looked into his  face.    'I am growing old,' he said, 'and I can no longer do for thee what I  might once have done. I am but a poor wanderer now. Dost thou indeed  wish to cast in thy lot with mine?'    'I care only to be near thee,' said the boy. 'I will go with thee to  the ends of the earth.'    So when, soon after, Leonardo received an invitation from the new King  of France, he took the boy with him, and together they made their home  in the little chateau of Claux near the town of Amboise.    The master's hair was silvered now, and his long beard was as white as  snow. His keen blue eyes looked weary and tired of life, and care had  drawn many deep lines on his beautiful face. Sad thoughts were always  his company. The one word 'failure' seemed to be written across his  life. What had he done? He had begun many things and had finished but  few. His great fresco was even now fading away and becoming dim and  blurred. His model for the marvellous horse was destroyed. A few  pictures remained, but these had never quite reached his ideal. The  crowd who had once hailed him as the greatest of all artists, could now  only talk of Michelangelo and the young Raphael. Michelangelo himself  had once scornfully told him he was a failure and could finish nothing.    He was glad to leave Italy and all its memories behind, and he hoped to  begin work again in his quiet little French home. But Death was drawing  near, and before many years had passed he grew too weak to hold a brush  or pencil.    It was in the springtime of the year that the end came. Francesco had  opened the window and gently lifted the master in his strong young  arms, that he might look once more on the outside world which he loved  so dearly. The trees were putting on their dainty dress of tender  green, white clouds swept across the blue sky, and April sunshine  flooded the room.    As he looked out, the master's tired eyes woke into life.    'Look!' he cried, 'the swallows have come back! Oh that they would lend  me their wings that I might fly away and be at rest!'    The swallows darted and circled about in the clear spring air, busy  with their building plans, but Francesco thought he heard the rustle of  other wings, as the master's soul, freed from the tired body, was at  last borne upwards higher than any earthly wings could soar.
