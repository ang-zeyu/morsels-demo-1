You wouldn't be ANNE if you had golden hair--or hair of any color but\"--    \"Red,\" said Anne, with gloomy satisfaction.    \"Yes, red--to give warmth to that milk-white skin and those shining  gray-green eyes of yours.  Golden hair wouldn't suit you at all Queen  Anne--MY Queen Anne--queen of my heart and life and home.\"    \"Then you may admire Leslie's all you like,\" said Anne magnanimously.        CHAPTER 13    A GHOSTLY EVENING    One evening, a week later, Anne decided to run over the fields to the  house up the brook for an informal call.  It was an evening of gray fog  that had crept in from the gulf, swathed the harbor, filled the glens  and valleys, and clung heavily to the autumnal meadows.  Through it the  sea sobbed and shuddered.  Anne saw Four Winds in a new aspect, and  found it weird and mysterious and fascinating; but it also gave her a  little feeling of loneliness.  Gilbert was away and would be away until  the morrow, attending a medical pow-wow in Charlottetown.  Anne longed  for an hour of fellowship with some girl friend.  Captain Jim and Miss  Cornelia were \"good fellows\" each, in their own way; but youth yearned  to youth.    \"If only Diana or Phil or Pris or Stella could drop in for a chat,\" she  said to herself, \"how delightful it would be!  This is such a GHOSTLY  night.  I'm sure all the ships that ever sailed out of Four Winds to  their doom could be seen tonight sailing up the harbor with their  drowned crews on their decks, if that shrouding fog could suddenly be  drawn aside.  I feel as if it concealed innumerable mysteries--as if I  were surrounded by the wraiths of old generations of Four Winds people  peering at me through that gray veil.  If ever the dear dead ladies of  this little house came back to revisit it they would come on just such  a night as this.  If I sit here any longer I'll see one of them there  opposite me in Gilbert's chair.  This place isn't exactly canny  tonight.  Even Gog and Magog have an air of pricking up their ears to  hear the footsteps of unseen guests.  I'll run over to see Leslie  before I frighten myself with my own fancies, as I did long ago in the  matter of the Haunted Wood.  I'll leave my house of dreams to welcome  back its old inhabitants.  My fire will give them my good-will and  greeting--they will be gone before I come back, and my house will be  mine once more.  Tonight I am sure it is keeping a tryst with the past.\"    Laughing a little over her fancy, yet with something of a creepy  sensation in the region of her spine, Anne kissed her hand to Gog and  Magog and slipped out into the fog, with some of the new magazines  under her arm for Leslie.    \"Leslie's wild for books and magazines,\" Miss Cornelia had told her,  \"and she hardly ever sees one.  She can't afford to buy them or  subscribe for them.  She's really pitifully poor, Anne.  I don't see  how she makes out to live at all on the little rent the farm brings in.  She never even hints a complaint on the score of poverty, but I know  what it must be.  She's been handicapped by it all her life.  She  didn't mind it when she was free and ambitious, but it must gall now,  believe ME.  I'm glad she seemed so bright and merry the evening she  spent with you.  Captain Jim told me he had fairly to put her cap and  coat on and push her out of the door.  Don't be too long going to see  her either.  If you are she'll think it's because you don't like the  sight of Dick, and she'll crawl into her shell again.  Dick's a great,  big, harmless baby, but that silly grin and chuckle of his do get on  some people's nerves.  Thank goodness, I've no nerves myself.  I like  Dick Moore better now than I ever did when he was in his right  senses--though the Lord knows that isn't saying much.  I was down there  one day in housecleaning time helping Leslie a bit, and I was frying  doughnuts.  Dick was hanging round to get one, as usual, and all at  once he picked up a scalding hot one I'd just fished out and dropped it  on the back of my neck when I was bending over.  Then he laughed and  laughed.  Believe ME, Anne, it took all the grace of God in my heart to  keep me from just whisking up that stew-pan of boiling fat and pouring  it over his head.\"    Anne laughed over Miss Cornelia's wrath as she sped through the  darkness.  But laughter accorded ill with that night.  She was sober  enough when she reached the house among the willows.  Everything was  very silent.  The front part of the house seemed dark and deserted, so  Anne slipped round to the side door, which opened from the veranda into  a little sitting room.  There she halted noiselessly.    The door was open.  Beyond, in the dimly lighted room, sat Leslie  Moore, with her arms flung out on the table and her head bent upon  them.  She was weeping horribly--with low, fierce, choking sobs, as if  some agony in her soul were trying to tear itself out.  An old black  dog was sitting by her, his nose resting on his lap, his big doggish  eyes full of mute, imploring sympathy and devotion.  Anne drew back in  dismay.  She felt that she could not intermeddle with this bitterness.  Her heart ached with a sympathy she might not utter.  To go in now  would be to shut the door forever on any possible help or friendship.  Some instinct warned Anne that the proud, bitter girl would never  forgive the one who thus surprised her in her abandonment of despair.    Anne slipped noiselessly from the veranda and found her way across the  yard.  Beyond, she heard voices in the gloom and saw the dim glow of a  light.  At the gate she met two men--Captain Jim with a lantern, and  another who she knew must be Dick Moore--a big man, badly gone to fat,  with a broad, round, red face, and vacant eyes.  Even in the dull light  Anne got the impression that there was something unusual about his eyes.    \"Is this you, Mistress Blythe?\" said Captain Jim.  \"Now, now, you  hadn't oughter be roaming about alone on a night like this.  You could  get lost in this fog easier than not.  Jest you wait till I see Dick  safe inside the door and I'll come back and light you over the fields.  I ain't going to have Dr. Blythe coming home and finding that you  walked clean over Cape Leforce in the fog.  A woman did that once,  forty years ago.    \"So you've been over to see Leslie,\" he said, when he rejoined her.    \"I didn't go in,\" said Anne, and told what she had seen.  Captain Jim  sighed.    \"Poor, poor, little girl!  She don't cry often, Mistress Blythe--she's  too brave for that.  She must feel terrible when she does cry.  A night  like this is hard on poor women who have sorrows.  There's something  about it that kinder brings up all we've suffered--or feared.\"    \"It's full of ghosts,\" said Anne, with a shiver.  \"That was why I came  over--I wanted to clasp a human hand and hear a human voice.    \"There seem to be so many INHUMAN presences about tonight.  Even my own  dear house was full of them.  They fairly elbowed me out.  So I fled  over here for companionship of my kind.\"    \"You were right not to go in, though, Mistress Blythe.  Leslie wouldn't  have liked it.  She wouldn't have liked me going in with Dick, as I'd  have done if I hadn't met you.  I had Dick down with me all day.  I  keep him with me as much as I can to help Leslie a bit.\"    \"Isn't there something odd about his eyes?\" asked Anne.    \"You noticed that?  Yes, one is blue and t'other is hazel--his father  had the same.  It's a Moore peculiarity.  That was what told me he was  Dick Moore when I saw him first down in Cuby.  If it hadn't a-bin for  his eyes I mightn't a-known him, with his beard and fat.  You know, I  reckon, that it was me found him and brought him home.  Miss Cornelia  always says I shouldn't have done it, but I can't agree with her.  It  was the RIGHT thing to do--and so 'twas the only thing.  There ain't no  question in my mind about THAT.  But my old heart aches for Leslie.  She's only twenty-eight and she's eaten more bread with sorrow than  most women do in eighty years.\"    They walked on in silence for a little while.  Presently Anne said, \"Do  you know, Captain Jim, I never like walking with a lantern.  I have  always the strangest feeling that just outside the circle of light,  just over its edge in the darkness, I am surrounded by a ring of  furtive, sinister things, watching me from the shadows with hostile  eyes.  I've had that feeling from childhood.  What is the reason?  I  never feel like that when I'm really in the darkness--when it is close  all around me--I'm not the least frightened.\"    \"I've something of that feeling myself,\" admitted Captain Jim.  \"I  reckon when the darkness is close to us it is a friend.  But when we  sorter push it away from us--divorce ourselves from it, so to speak,  with lantern light--it becomes an enemy.  But the fog is lifting.    \"There's a smart west wind rising, if you notice.  The stars will be  out when you get home.\"    They were out; and when Anne re-entered her house of dreams the red  embers were still glowing on the hearth, and all the haunting presences  were gone.        CHAPTER 14    NOVEMBER DAYS    The splendor of color which had glowed for weeks along the shores of  Four Winds Harbor had faded out into the soft gray-blue of late  autumnal hills.  There came many days when fields and shores were dim  with misty rain, or shivering before the breath of a melancholy  sea-wind--nights, too, of storm and tempest, when Anne sometimes  wakened to pray that no ship might be beating up the grim north shore,  for if it were so not even the great, faithful light whirling through  the darkness unafraid, could avail to guide it into safe haven.    \"In November I sometimes feel as if spring could never come again,\" she  sighed, grieving over the hopeless unsightliness of her frosted and  bedraggled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5449"],[0,"Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Complete (#17)"],[1,"eye, which hung to his girdle by a gold  chain; When he threw it on the ground, so as to lie on the earth, if its  engraved side turned to heaven, and its smooth side lay on the ground,  he said \"yes;\" in the other case, on the contrary, \"no.\" In his purse  lay always a statuette of the god Apheru, who opened roads; this he  threw down at cross-roads, and followed the direction which the pointed  snout of the image indicated. He frequently called into council the  seal-ring of his deceased father, an old family possession, which the  chief priests of Abydos had laid upon the holiest of the fourteen graves  of Osiris, and endowed with miraculous power. It consisted of a gold  ring with a broad signet, on which could be read the name of Thotmes  III., who had long since been deified, and from whom Paaker's ancestors  had derived it. If it were desirable to consult the ring, the Mohar  touched with the point of his bronze dagger the engraved sign of the  name, below which were represented three objects sacred to the Gods, and  three that were, on the contrary, profane. If he hit one of the former,  he concluded that his father--who was gone to Osiris--concurred in his  design; in the contrary case he was careful to postpone it. Often he  pressed the ring to his heart, and awaited the first living creature  that he might meet, regarding it as a messenger from his father;--if it  came to him from the right hand as an encouragement, if from the left as  a warning.    By degrees he had reduced these questionings to a system. All that he  found in nature he referred to himself and the current of his life. It  was at once touching, and pitiful, to see how closely he lived with the  Manes of his dead. His lively, but not exalted fancy, wherever he gave  it play, presented to the eye of his soul the image of his father and of  an elder brother who had died early, always in the same spot, and almost  tangibly distinct.    But he never conjured up the remembrance of the beloved dead in order  to think of them in silent melancholy--that sweet blossom of the thorny  wreath of sorrow; only for selfish ends. The appeal to the Manes of  his father he had found especially efficacious in certain desires and  difficulties; calling on the Manes of his brother was potent in certain  others; and so he turned from one to the other with the precision of a  carpenter, who rarely doubts whether he should give the preference to a  hatchet or a saw.    These doings he held to be well pleasing to the Gods, and as he was  convinced that the spirits of his dead had, after their justification,  passed into Osiris that is to say, as atoms forming part of the  great world-soul, at this time had a share in the direction of the  universe--he sacrificed to them not only in the family catacomb, but  also in the temples of the Necropolis dedicated to the worship of  ancestors, and with special preference in the House of Seti.    He accepted advice, nay even blame, from Ameni and the other priests  under his direction; and so lived full of a virtuous pride in being one  of the most zealous devotees in the land, and one of the most pleasing  to the Gods, a belief on which his pastors never threw any doubt.    Attended and guided at every step by supernatural powers, he wanted no  friend and no confidant. In the fleld, as in Thebes, he stood apart, and  passed among his comrades for a reserved man, rough and proud, but with  a strong will.    He had the power of calling up the image of his lost love with as much  vividness as the forms of the dead, and indulged in this magic, not only  through a hundred still nights, but in long rides and drives through  silent wastes.    Such visions were commonly followed by a vehement and boiling overflow  of his hatred against the charioteer, and a whole series of fervent  prayers for his destruction.    When Paaker set the cup of water for Nefert on the flat stone and felt  for the philter, his soul was so full of desire that there was no room  for hatred; still he could not altogether exclude the idea that he would  commit a great crime by making use of a magic drink. Before pouring the  fateful drops into the water, he would consult the oracle of the ring.  The dagger touched none of the holy symbols of the inscription on the  signet, and in other circumstances he would, without going any farther,  have given up his project.    But this time he unwillingly returned it to its sheath, pressed the  gold ring to his heart, muttered the name of his brother in Osiris, and  awaited the first living creature that might come towards him.    He had not long to wait, from the mountain slope opposite to him rose,  with heavy, slow wing-strokes, two light-colored vultures.    In anxious suspense he followed their flight, as they rose, higher  and higher. For a moment they poised motionless, borne up by the air,  circled round each other, then wheeled to the left and vanished behind  the mountains, denying him the fulfilment of his desire.    He hastily grasped the phial to fling it from him, but the surging  passion in his veins had deprived him of his self-control. Nefert's  image stood before him as if beckoning him; a mysterious power clenched  his fingers close and yet closer round the phial, and with the same  defiance which he showed to his associates, he poured half of the  philter into the cup and approached his victim.    Nefert had meanwhile left her shady retreat and come towards him.    She silently accepted the water he offered her, and drank it with  delight, to the very dregs.    \"'Thank you,\" she said, when she had recovered breath after her eager  draught.    \"That has done me good! How fresh and acid the water tastes; but your  hand shakes, and you are heated by your quick run for me--poor man.\"    With these words she looked at him with a peculiar expressive glance of  her large eyes, and gave him her right hand, which he pressed wildly to  his lips.    \"That will do,\" she said smiling; \"here comes the princess with a  priest, out of the hovel of the unclean. With what frightful words you  terrified me just now. It is true I gave you just cause to be angry with  me; but now you are kind again--do you hear?--and will bring your  mother again to see mine. Not a word. I shall see, whether cousin Paaker  refuses me obedience.\"    She threatened him playfully with her finger, and then growing grave she  added, with a look that pierced Paaker's heart with pain, and yet with  ecstasy, \"Let us leave off quarrelling. It is so much better when people  are kind to each other.\"    After these words she walked towards the house of the paraschites, while  Paaker pressed his hands to his breast, and murmured:    \"The drink is working, and she will be mine. I thank ye--ye Immortals!\"    But this thanksgiving, which hitherto he had never failed to utter when  any good fortune had befallen him, to-day died on his lips. Close before  him he saw the goal of his desires; there, under his eyes, lay the magic  spring longed for for years. A few steps farther, and he might slake at  its copious stream his thirst both for love and for revenge.    While he followed the wife of Mena, and replaced the phial carefully in  his girdle, so as to lose no drop of the precious fluid which, according  to the prescription of the old woman, he needed to use again, warning  voices spoke in his breast, to which he usually listened as to a  fatherly admonition; but at this moment he mocked at them, and even gave  outward expression to the mood that ruled him--for he flung up his right  hand like a drunken man, who turns away from the preacher of morality on  his way to the wine-cask; and yet passion held him so closely ensnared,  that the thought that he should live through the swift moments which  would change him from an honest man into a criminal, hardly dawned,  darkly on his soul. He had hitherto dared to indulge his desire for  love and revenge in thought only, and had left it to the Gods to act  for themselves; now he had taken his cause out of the hand of the  Celestials, and gone into action without them, and in spite of them.    The sorceress Hekt passed him; she wanted to see the woman for whom she  had given him the philter. He perceived her and shuddered, but soon the  old woman vanished among the rocks muttering.    \"Look at the fellow with six toes. He makes himself comfortable with the  heritage of Assa.\"    In the middle of the valley walked Nefert and the pioneer, with the  princess Bent-Anat and Pentaur who accompanied her.    When these two had come out of the hut of the paraschites, they stood  opposite each other in silence. The royal maiden pressed her hand to  her heart, and, like one who is thirsty, drank in the pure air of the  mountain valley with deeply drawn breath; she felt as if released from  some overwhelming burden, as if delivered from some frightful danger.    At last she turned to her companion, who gazed earnestly at the ground.    \"What an hour!\" she said.    Pentaur's tall figure did not move, but he bowed his head in assent, as  if he were in a dream. Bent-Anat now saw him for the first time in fall  daylight; her large eyes rested on him with admiration, and she asked:    \"Art thou the priest, who yesterday, after my first visit to this house,  so readily restored me to cleanness?\"    \"I am he,\" replied Pentaur.    \"I recognized thy voice, and I am grateful to thee, for it was thou that  didst strengthen my courage to follow the impulse of my heart, in spite  of my spiritual guides, and to come here again. Thou wilt defend me if  others blame me.\"    \"I came here to pronounce thee unclean.\"    \"Then thou hast changed thy mind?\" asked Bent-Anat, and a smile of  contempt curled her lips.    \"I follow a high injunction, that commands us to keep the old  institutions sacred. If touching a paraschites, it is said, does not  defile a princess, whom then can it defile? for whose garment is more  spotless than "]]]
