Again, no food!    The Japs were jittery themselves; they were thoroughly unhappy over  the frequent bombings of the ship. We got blamed for the bombings, so  no food!    The night was cold with occasional rain. Croupy coughs developed in  all sections of the court. I felt I was growing thinner by the hour;  my bony prominences were making an effort to poke through my skin.    Prisoners were extremely restless and angry; they kept up a constant  chatter all night. The guards became very annoyed and threatened to  shoot into the court. \"Be quiet! Ve vill shoot in the dalk!\"    Dee. 17, 1944: One sack of raw rice for 1340 prisoners-averaged out to  four teaspoons per person. The night was very cold. I couldn't get my  mind off the clothing, medical bag and Spam that I had abandoned on  the ship. Three patients died during the night. The count was now  1,337.    Dee. 18th: Everyone had eye irritation; one sack of raw rice. A truck  load of worn-out Japanese summer underwear arrived. As usual there was  not enough to go around. Two died. The count was now 1,335.    Dec. 19th: The Oryoku Maru rolled on its side and sunk out of sight,  ending the periodic explosions. One sack of rice, many croupy coughs.  Bitter cold night-prisoners can't sleep. Much chattering; guards  furious kept threatening to shoot. Two died. The count was now 1,333.    Dec. 20th: A Marine officer's arm was becoming gangrenous; Lt. Col.  Jack Schwartz amputated the arm with only a jack knife and no  anesthetic. The marine lived only a few hours before giving his last  sigh of relief. One sack of rice. Three deaths. The count, 1,330.    Thirty trucks arrived; 681 prisoners were put on the trucks bound for  the jail in San Fernando, Pampanga. Now there was more room to lie  down. No sleeping; many hacking coughs.    Dec. 21st: The thirty trucks came back; our remaining group 648 - were  put aboard for the trip to San Fernando. I got a good look at the  Olongapo Naval Base as we passed through; it h d been completely  destroyed. One death today. The count - 1,329.    A very hot and dusty trip. We were afraid the U.S. planes might  discover the large clouds of dust raised by our convoy. We arrived at  an empty theater, which offered cover and some protection from cold  and mosquitoes.       Dec. 22, 1944: Received five sacks of cooked rice two cups each a  real treat.       \"They are probably fattening us up for who knows what!\"    Toward evening, Mr. Wata, the Jap interpreter, entered the theater and  inquired, \"Who is too sick or too disabled to continue journey to  Japan?\"    He asked our medics to select fifteen disabled. We thought we were  doing the fifteen disabled a favor, and actually envied them. They  would be going back to Bilibid in Manila.    Wata took the prisoners away in a truck supposedly to Bilibid.    We learned that the Japs took the prisoners to the local cemetery,  forced them to dig their own graves, and then bayoneted them, so they  fell in the graves. A most miserable night.    Dec. 24th: Sunday - About 0900 hours, we were marched down the street  barefooted and in rags to the railroad station. The Nips enjoyed  prodding and goading us especially in front of the Filipinos to show  the superiority of the yellow race. We arrived at a very badly damaged  station. There were ten    small freight cars with an engine at each end standing on a siding;  131 prisoners were crowded into and on top of each car. There was  barely room to stand in the cars; it was stifling; it was difficult to  breathe the hot air; in fact there wasn't enough air to breathe.    It took nearly eighteen hours to go the one hundred miles north to the  end of the line at San Fernando, La Union. On the way, I passed out.  When I came to, I found myself lying on the floor with prisoners  sitting on me. Fortunately I had found a crack in the floor through  which I could breathe.    Dee. 25, 1944: Monday - We arrived at the station about 0300 hours  after much thirst, hunger and misery. There were several dead on the  floor of each car. We spent the remainder of the night on the gravel  terrace about the station. Most prisoners had dysentery, so the area  was soon filthy.    As the sun rose, we were lined up and marched through the streets.  Japanese soldiers, hanging out many windows and doors, were laughing  and joking as they spotted us odd characters passing by. We were taken  to a school yard. The school house became our hospital. Every survivor  was extremely weak. We were given a half cup of cooked rice for our  Christmas dinner.    About 2000 hours, as we were settling down for the night, we were  routed out for tenko (counting) - 1,308.    We then marched several miles to the beach. No one volunteered to help  us medics carry the sick and wounded. We dug holes in the sand for  windbreaks, and huddled together for warmth. It was too cold to sleep!    Dee. 26, 1944: About 0500 hours, we were divided into groups of one  hundred, and each prisoner issued a rice ball. As usual, there wasn't  enough to go around.    Our groups were taken one at a time out into Lingayen Gulf to bathe.  It was very pleasant while it lasted. The beach soon became very hot.  We received three teaspoons of water to drink. Two died. The count -  1,306.    Dee. 27, 1944: In a series of short marches, we crossed a small  peninsula to a pier. Six large transports were anchored in the gulf.  There were fourteen sunken vessels visible above water.    Landing barges were bringing about fifty Japanese soldiers at a time  to the beach with many boxes of ammunition. The barges then came over  to our pier to take on some fifty prisoners.    High waves made it very difficult to get on the barge; I had to jump  down about ten feet onto the bouncing front deck. I was surprised that  my \"toothpick\" legs didn't buckle under the jolt. We started out to a  transport with a No.2 on the stack, the Brazil Maru.  An air raid  alarm sounded!    In the confusion our landing craft was directed to an empty transport  marked No.1, the Enoura Maru. We were soon up the long ladder, and put  in the forward hold; then we were divided into groups of twenty.    This time there was plenty of room and an abundance of fresh air, but  it was very cold.    On the level above us were hundreds of sick and wounded Japanese  soldiers returning to Japan. They were dressed in army caps, long  white gowns, g-strings, and field shoes. No food; no water! But the  Jap soldiers were eating their regular meals three times daily. Steel  decks very hard! Unable to sleep.    Dee. 28, 1944: Thursday-Under way at dawn! Again, no food; no water;  Jap patients getting three regular meals on time. A few prisoners were  trying to trade jewelry for food. Most of us had nothing to trade.  Manure and flies were very bad.    When I attempted to stand, I blacked out. One died; we wrapped him in  a straw mat, had a brief religious ceremony, and then slid him over  the side. The count, (?) 1,305.    Col. Harold Johnson, our C.O., prohibited all trading with the Japs! A  civilian gambler from Manila ignored his orders and obtained rice and  candy for his friends. Angry prisoners scattered the rice and candy  into the darkness.    December 29, 1944: Raining. Prisoners fought each other, trying to get  their cups and mess gear under the drippings from the hatch covers to  catch a few drops. Two spoons of rice.    1800 hours - Blasts of large guns on the deck. We crawled off the  wooden planks on to the steel deck. Depth charges were exploding on  each side of the ship for a thirty minute period. Then there was  enthusiastic clapping by the Japs on the upper deck. It was announced:  \"Japanese Impeliar Navy has sunk Amelican submaline!\" Banzai/ Banzai/  Banzai/    At 2000 we dropped anchor. There was a full moon. Pens, rings and mess  gear were being traded for cigarettes or water. It was a very cold  night.        Hips and spines were becoming extremely sore-attempting to poke  through the skin.        December 30: The sea was very rough. Our empty ship,    floating high, pitched and pounded. Half cup of rice; several spoons  of water.    2000 hours - shelling and depth charges for half hour. During the  night a Japanese soldier fell from the upper deck into our hold killed  by the fall. This added much to the usual confusion. Intermittent  depth charges all night as our ship dashed and pounded across the open  sea toward Formosa.       Dee. 31, 1944: Sunday-No food; half cup of water! Col. Johnson told  Mr. Wata: \"If we don't get food, we will all die!\"       Mr. Wata responded: \"Evelbody must die! This is no time for  sympathy!\"    The sea was very rough and very cold! During the night we entered a  land-locked harbor-Takao in Formosa. It was New Year's Eve! The old  bewhiskered rabbi and farmer, Aaron Kliatchko died. The count, (?)  1,304    Jan. 1, 1945: We dared to think that things might get better in  \"forty-five.\" We began to hear, \"Still alive in 'forty-five!'\" Issued  five moldy \"hardtack\" type biscuits.    The prisoners were now like animals in a cage begging for food and  cigarettes. The Japs couldn't understand how the Americans could  expend so much energy jumping for cigarettes, when they were  supposedly very weak. Three-quarters of a cup of water (a real treat).  Bitter cold. We were extremely hungry, thirsty and cold. Our bodies  were very sore and we were unable to sleep.    Old John \"The Thief,\" died. The count, (?) 1,303.       Jan. 2, 1945: The harbor was surrounded by high, snow covered  mountains; we were in southern Formosa. The Japanese patients were  taken out of the holds; their areas were fumigated by American  soldiers-hoping to get something to eat in return for their work.    Col. Johnson again requested food. Mr. Wata answered: \"United States  submalines sink arr Japanese food ships! Vely solly!\"    Many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8452"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 363, December 16, 1882 (#17)"],[1," identified, should such exist in the wood creosote of the market.    The following tests were used:    1. Equal volumes of anhydrous glycerine and wood creosote make a turbid  mixture, separating on standing. _Phenol dissolves_. If three volumes  of water be added, the separation of the wood creosote is immediate.  _Phenol remains in permanent solution_.    2. One volume of wood creosote added to two volumes of glycerine; the  former is not dissolved, but separates on standing. _Phenol dissolves_.    3. Three parts of a mixture containing 75 per cent, of glycerine and  25 of water to 1 part of wood creosote show no increase of volume of  glycerine, and wood creosote separates. _Phenol dissolves, and forms  a clear mixture_. Were any phenol present in the wood creosote, the  increase in the volume of the glycerine solution, if in a graduated  tube, would distinctly indicate the percentage of phenol present.    4. Solubility in benzine. Wood creosote entirely soluble. _Phenol is  insoluble_.    5. A 1 per cent, solution of wood creosote. Take of this 10 cubic  centimeters, add 1 drop of a test solution of ferric chloride; an  evanescent blue color is formed, passing quickly into a red color.  _Phenol gives a permanent blue color_.    6. Collodion or albumen with an equal bulk of wood creosote makes a  perfect mixture without coagulation. _Phenol at once coagulates into a  more or less firm mass or clot_.    7. Bromine solution with wood creosote gives a reddish brown  precipitate. _Phenol gives a white precipitate_.    All tests enumerated above were repeatedly tried with four samples of  wood creosote sold as such; one a sample of Morson's, one of Merck's,  one evidently of German origin, but bearing the label and capsule of an  American manufacturer, and one of unknown origin, but sold as beech-wood  creosote (German), and each proved to be _pure wood creosote_.    Two samples of commercial creosote which, from the low cost, were known  to be of coal tar origin gave the negative tests, showing that they were  phenol.    Corroborative experiments were made by mixing 10 to 20 per cent, of  phenol with samples of the beechwood creosote, but in every case each of  the tests named showed the presence of the phenol.    The writer on other occasions applied single tests (the collodion test)  to samples of beechwood creosote that he had an opportunity of procuring  small specimens of, and satisfied himself that they were pure. The  conclusion is that the wood creosote of the market of the present time  is in abundant supply, is of unexceptionable quality, and reasonable in  price, so that there is no excuse for the substitution of the phenol  commonly sold for it. When it is directed for use for internal  administration (the medicinal effect being entirely dissimilar), wood  creosote only should be dispensed.    The general sales of creosote by the pharmacist are in small quantities  as a toothache remedy, and phenol has the power of coagulating albumen,  which effectually relieves the suffering. Wood creosote does not  coagulate albumen, and is, therefore, not as serviceable. This is,  perhaps, the reason that it has become, in a great measure, supplanted  in general sale by the coal tar creosote, to say nothing of the argument  of a lower cost.           *       *       *       *       *          REMEDY FOR SICK HEADACHE.      Surgeon Major Roehring, of Amberg, reports, in No. 32 of the _Allg. Med.  Centr. Zeit_., April 22, 1882, a case of headache of long standing,  which he cured by salicylate of sodium, which confirms the observations  of Dr. Oehlschlager, of Dantzig, who first contended that we possessed  in salicylic acid one of the most reliable remedies for neuralgia. This  cannot astonish us if we remember that the action of salicylic acid is,  in more than one respect, and especially in its influence on the nervous  centers, analogous to quinine.    While out with the troops on maneuver, Dr. Roehring was called to visit  the sixteen-year old son of a poor peasant family in a neighboring  village. The boy, who gave all evidences of living under bad hygienic  surroundings, but who had shown himself very diligent at school, had  been suffering, from his sixth year, several days every week from the  most intense headache, which had not been relieved by any of the many  remedies tried for this purpose. A careful examination did not reveal  any organic lesion or any cause for the pain, which seemed to be  neuralgic in character, a purely nervous headache. Roehring had just  been reading the observations of Oehlschlager, and knowing, from the  names of the physicians who had been already attending the poor boy,  that all the common remedies for neuralgia had been given a fair trial,  thought this a good opportunity to test the virtue of salicylate of  sodium. He gave the boy, who, in consequence of the severity of the  pain, was not able to leave his bed, ten grains of the remedy every  three hours, and was surprised to see the patient next day in his tent  and with smiling face. The boy admitted that he for years had not been  feeling so well as he did then. The remedy was continued, but in less  frequent doses, for a few days longer; the headache did not return.  Several months later Dr. Roehring wrote to the school-teacher of the  boy, and was informed that the latter had, during all this time,  been totally free of his former pain, that he was much brighter than  formerly, and evidently enjoying the best of health.    It may be worth while to give the remedy a more extensive trial, and the  more so as we are only too often at a loss what to do in stubborn cases  of so-called nervous headache.--_The Medical and Surgical Reporter_.           *       *       *       *       *          SUNLIGHT AND SKYLIGHT AT HIGH ALTITUDES.      At the Southampton meeting of the British Association, Captain Abney  read a paper in which he called attention to the fact that photographs  taken at high altitudes show skies that are nearly black by comparison  with bright objects projected against them, and he went on to show that  the higher above the sea level the observer went, the darker the sky  really is and the fainter the spectrum. In fact, the latter shows but  little more than a band in the violet and ultraviolet at a height of  8,500 feet, while at sea-level it shows nearly the whole photographic  spectrum. The only reason of this must be particles of some reflecting  matter from which sunlight is reflected. The author refers this to  watery stuff, of which nine-tenths is left behind at the altitude at  which be worked. He then showed that the brightness of the ultra-violet  of direct sunlight increased enormously the higher the observer went,  but only to a certain point, for the spectrum suddenly terminated about  2,940 wave-length. This abrupt absorption was due to extra-atmospheric  causes and perhaps to space. The increase in brightness of the  ultra-violet was such that the usually invisible rays, L, M, N, could be  distinctly seen, showing that the visibility of these rays depended  on the intensity of the radiation. The red and ultra-red part of the  spectrum was also considered. He showed that the absorption lines were  present in undiminished force and number at this high altitude, thus  placing their origin to extra-atmospheric causes. The absorption from  atmospheric causes of radiant enemy in these parts he showed was due  to \"water-stuff,\" which he hesitated to call aqueous vapor, since the  banded spectrum of water was present, and not lines. The B and A line he  also stated could not be claimed as telluric lines, much less as due to  aqueous vapor, but must originate between the sun and our atmosphere.  The author finally confirmed the presence of benzine and ethyl in the  same region. He had found their presence indicated in the spectrum at  sea-level, and found their absorption lines with undiminished intensity  at 8,500 feet. Thus, without much doubt, hydrocarbons must exist between  our atmosphere and the sun, and, it may be, in space.    Prof. Langley, following Capt. Abney, observed: The very remarkable  paper just read by Captain Abney has already brought information  upon some points which the one I am about, by the courtesy of the  Association, to present, leaves in doubt. It will be understood then  that the references here are to his published memoirs only, and not to  what we have just heard.    The solar spectrum is so commonly composed to have been mapped with  completeness, that the statement that much more than one-half its extent  is not only unmapped but nearly unknown, may excite surprise. This  statement is, however, I think, quite within the truth, as to that  almost unexplored region discovered by the elder Herschel, which, lying  below the red and invisible to the eye, is so compressed by the prism  that, though its aggregate heat effects have been studied through the  thermopile, it is only by the recent researches of Capt. Abney that we  have any certain knowledge of the lines of absorption there, even in  part. Though the last-named investigator has extended our knowledge of  it to a point much beyond the lowest visible ray, there yet remains a  still remoter region, more extensive than the whole visible spectrum,  the study of which has been entered on at Alleghany, by means of the  linear bolometer.    The whole spectrum, visible and invisible, is powerfully affected by the  selective absorption of our atmosphere and that of the sun; and we must  first observe that could we get outside our earth's atmospheric shell,  we should see a second and very different spectrum, and could we  afterward remove the solar atmosphere also, we should have yet a third,  different from either. The charts exhibited show:    1st. The distribution of the solar energy as we receive it, at the  earth's surface, throughout the entire invisible as well as visible  portion, both on the prismatic and"]]]
