For that  reason I am going to show you the maps and ancient documents and point  out to you where I believe the lost city lies.  Now, if you will give  me your attention, I'll proceed.\"    The professor went over in detail the story of how he had found the old  documents relating to the lost city of Kurzon, and of how, after much  labor and research, he had located the city in the Copan valley.  The  great idol of gold was one of the chief possessions of Kurzon, and it  was often referred to in the old papers; copies and translations of  which the professor had with him.    \"But this is the most valuable of all,\" he said, as he opened an  oiled-silk packet.  \"And before I show it to you, suppose you two young  men take a look outside the tent.\"    \"What for?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"To make sure that no emissaries from the Beecher crowd are sneaking  around to overhear what we say,\" was the somewhat bitter answer of the  scientist.  \"I do not trust him, in spite of his attempted denial.\"    Tom and Ned took a quick but thorough observation outside the tent.  The blackness of the jungle night was in strange contrast to the light  they had just left.    \"Doesn't seem to be any one around here,\" remarked Ned, after waiting a  minute or two.    \"No.  All's quiet along the Potomac.  Those Beecher natives are having  some sort of a song-fest, though.\"    In the distance, and from the direction of their rivals' camp, came the  weird chant.    \"Well, as long as they stay there we'll be all right,\" said Tom.  \"Come  on in.  I'm anxious to hear what the professor has to say.\"    \"Everything's quiet,\" reported Ned.    \"Then give me your attention,\" begged the scientist.    Carefully, as though about to exhibit some, precious jewel, he loosened  the oiled-silk wrappings and showed a large map, on thin but tough  paper.    \"This is drawn from the old charts,\" the professor explained.  \"I  worked on it many months, and it is the only copy in the world.  If it  were to be destroyed I should have to go all the way back to New York  to make another copy.  I have the original there in a safe deposit  vault.\"    \"Wouldn't it have been wise to make two copies?\" asked Tom.    \"It would have only increased the risk.  With one copy, and that  constantly in my possession, I can be sure of my ground.  Otherwise  not.  That is why I am so careful of this.  Now I will show you why I  believe we are about over the ancient city of Kurzon.\"    \"Over it!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"Bless my gunpowder! What do you mean?\"  and he looked down at the earthen floor of the tent as though expecting  it to open and swallow him.    \"I mean that the city, like many others of Central and South America,  is buried below the refuse of centuries,\" went on the professor.  \"Very  soon, if we are fortunate, we shall be looking on the civilization of  hundreds of years ago--how long no one knows.    \"Considerable excavation has been done in Central America,\" went on  Professor Bumper, \"and certain ruins have been brought to light.  Near  us are those of Copan, while toward the frontier are those of Quirigua,  which are even better preserved than the former.  We may visit them if  we have time.  But I have reason to believe that in this section of  Copan is a large city, the existence of which has not been made certain  of by any one save myself--and, perhaps, Professor Beecher.    \"Certainly no part of it has seen the light of day for many centuries.  It shall be our pleasure to uncover it, if possible, and secure the  idol of gold.\"    \"How long ago do you think the city was buried?\" asked Tom.    \"It would be hard to say.  From the carvings and hieroglyphics I have  studied it would seem that the Mayan civilization lasted about five  hundred years, and that it began perhaps in the year A.  D.  five  hundred.\"    \"That would mean,\" said Mr. Damon, \"that the ancient cities were in  ruins, buried, perhaps, long before Columbus discovered the new world.\"    \"Yes,\" assented the professor.  \"Probably Kurzon, which we now seek,  was buried deep for nearly five hundred years before Columbus landed at  San Salvadore.  The specimens of writing and architecture heretofore  disclosed indicate that.  But, as a matter of fact, it is very hard to  decipher the Mayan pictographs.  So far, little but the ability to read  their calendars and numerical system is possessed by us, though we are  gradually making headway.    \"Now this is the map of the district, and by the markings you can see  where I hope to find what I seek.  We shall begin digging here,\" and he  made a small mark with a pencil on the map.    \"Of course,\" the professor explained, \"I may be wrong, and it will take  some time to discover the error if we make one.  When a city is buried  thirty or forty feet deep beneath earth and great trees have grown over  it, it is not easy to dig down to it.\"    \"How do you ever expect to find it?\" asked Ned.    \"Well, we will sink shafts here and there.  If we find carved stones,  the remains of ancient pottery and weapons, parts of buildings or  building stones, we shall know we are on the right track,\" was the  answer.  \"And now that I have shown you the map, and explained how  valuable it is, I will put it away again.  We shall begin our  excavations in the morning.\"    \"At what point?\" asked Tom.    \"At a point I shall indicate after a further consultation of the map.  I must see the configuration of the country by daylight to decide.  And  now let's get some rest.  We have had a hard day.\"    The two tents housing the four white members of the Bumper party were  close together, and it was decided that the night would be divided into  four watches, to guard against possible treachery on the part of the  Beecher crowd.    \"It seems an unkind precaution to take against a fellow scientist,\"  said Professor Bumper, \"but I can not afford to take chances after what  has occurred.\"    The others agreed with him, and though standing guard was not pleasant  it was done.  However the night passed without incident, and then came  morning and the excitement of getting breakfast, over which the Indians  made merry.  They did not like the cold and darkness, and always  welcomed the sun, no matter how hot.    \"And now,\" cried Tom, when the meal was over, \"let us begin the work  that has brought us here.\"    \"Yes,\" agreed Professor Bumper, \"I will consult the map, and start the  diggers where I think the city lies, far below the surface.  Now,  gentlemen, if you will give me your attention----\"    He was seeking through his outer coat pockets, after an ineffectual  search in the inner one.  A strange look came over his face.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Tom.    \"The map--the map!\" gasped the professor.  \"The map I was showing you  last night!  The map that tells where we are to dig for the idol of  gold!  It's gone!\"    \"The map gone?\" gasped Mr. Damon.    \"I--I'm afraid so,\" faltered the professor.  \"I put it away carefully,  but now----\"    He ceased speaking to make a further search in all his pockets.    \"Maybe you left it in another coat,\" suggested Ned.    \"Or maybe some of the Beecher crowd took it!\" snapped Tom.          CHAPTER XVIII    \"EL TIGRE!\"      The four men gazed at one another.  Consternation showed on the face of  Professor Bumper, and was reflected, more or less, on the countenances  of his companions.    \"Are you sure the map is gone?\" asked Tom.  \"I know how easy it is to  mislay anything in a camp of this sort.  I couldn't at first find my  safety razor this morning, and when I did locate it the hoe was in one  of my shoes.  I'm sure a rat or some jungle animal must have dragged it  there.  Now maybe they took your map, Professor.  That oiled silk in  which it was wrapped might have appealed to the taste of a rat or a  snake.\"    \"It is no joking matter,\" said Professor Bumper.  \"But I know you  appreciate the seriousness of it as much as I do, Tom.  But I had the  map in the pocket of this coat, and now it is gone!\"    \"When did you put it there?\" asked Ned.    \"This morning, just before I came to breakfast.\"    \"Oh, then you have had it since last night!\" Tom ejaculated.    \"Yes, I slept with it under my clothes that I rolled up for a pillow,  and when it was my turn to stand guard I took it with me.  Then I put  it back again and went to sleep.  When I awoke and dressed I put the  packet in my pocket and ate breakfast.  Now when I look for it--why,  it's gone!\"    \"The map or the oiled-silk package?\" asked Mr. Damon, who, once having  been a businessman, was sometimes a stickler for small points.    \"Both,\" answered the professor.  \"I opened the silk to tie it more  smoothly, so it would not be such a lump in my pocket, and I made sure  the map was inside.\"    \"Then the whole thing has been taken--or you have lost it,\" suggested  Ned.    \"I am not in the habit of losing valuable maps,\" retorted the  scientist.  \"And the pocket of my coat I had made deep, for the purpose  of carrying the long map.  It could not drop out.\"    \"Well, we mustn't overlook any possible chances,\" suggested Tom.  \"Come  on now, we'll search every inch of the ground over which you traveled  this morning, Professor.\"    \"It MUST be found,\" murmured the scientist.  \"Without it all our work  will go for naught.\"    They all went into the tent where the professor and Mr. Damon had slept  when they were not on guard.  The camp was a busy place, with the  Indians finishing their morning meal, and getting ready for the work of  the day.  For word had been given out that there would be no more long  periods of travel.    In consequence, efforts were being directed by the head men of the  bearers to making a more permanent camp in the wilderness.  Shelters of  palm-thatched huts were being built, a site for cooking fires made,  and, at the direction of Mr. Damon, to whom this part was entrusted,  some sanitary regulations were insisted on.

OF COMPOUND DERIVED SHADOWS.    Compound derived shadows are of two kinds; that is columnar and  spreading.    162.    OF SHADOW.    Derived shadows are of three kinds of which one is spreading, the  second columnar, the third converging to the point where the two  sides meet and intersect, and beyond this intersection the sides are  infinitely prolonged or straight lines. And if you say, this shadow  must terminate at the angle where the sides meet and extend no  farther, I deny this, because above in the first on shadow I have  proved: that a thing is completely terminated when no portion of it  goes beyond its terminating lines. Now here, in this shadow, we see  the converse of this, in as much as where this derived shadow  originates we obviously have the figures of two pyramids of shadow  which meet at their angles. Hence, if, as [my] opponent says, the  first pyramid of shadow terminates the derivative shadow at the  angle whence it starts, then the second pyramid of shadow--so says  the adversary--must be caused by the angle and not from the body in  shadow; and this is disproved with the help of the 2nd of this which  says: Shadow is a condition produced by a body casting a shadow, and  interposed between this shadow and the luminous body. By this it is  made clear that the shadow is not produced by the angle of the  derived shadow but only by the body casting the shadow; &c. If a  spherical solid body is illuminated by a light of elongated form the  shadow produced by the longest portion of this light will have less  defined outlines than that which is produced by the breadth of the  same light. And this is proved by what was said before, which is:  That a shadow will have less defined outlines in proportion as the  light which causes it is larger, and conversely, the outlines are  clearer in proportion as it is smaller.    [Footnote: The two diagrams to this chapter are on Plate IV, No. 1.]    On the relation of derived and primary shadow (163-165).    163.    The derived shadow can never resemble the body from which it  proceeds unless the light is of the same form and size as the body  causing the shadow.    The derived shadow cannot be of the same form as the primary shadow  unless it is intercepted by a plane parallel to it.    164.    HOW A CAST SHADOW CAN NEVER BE OF THE SAME SIZE AS THE BODY THAT  CASTS IT.    If the rays of light proceed, as experience shows, from a single  point and are diffused in a sphere round this point, radiating and  dispersed through the air, the farther they spread the wider they  must spread; and an object placed between the light and a wall is  always imaged larger in its shadow, because the rays that strike it  [Footnote: 7. The following lines are wanting to complete the  logical connection.] would, by the time they have reached the wall,  have become larger.    165.    Any shadow cast by a body in light and shade is of the same nature  and character as that which is inseparable from the body. The centre  of the length of a shadow always corresponds to that of the luminous  body [Footnote 6: This second statement of the same idea as in the  former sentence, but in different words, does not, in the original,  come next to the foregoing; sections 172 and 127 are placed between  them.]. It is inevitable that every shadow must have its centre in a  line with the centre of the light.    On the shape of derived shadows (166-174).    166.    OF THE PYRAMIDAL SHADOW.    The pyramidal shadow produced by a columnar body will be narrower  than the body itself in proportion as the simple derived shadow is  intersected farther from the body which casts it.    [Footnote 166: Compare the first diagram to No. 161. If we here  conceive of the outlines of the pyramid of shadow on the ground as  prolonged beyond its apex this gives rise to a second pyramid; this  is what is spoken of at the beginning of No. 166.]    167.    The cast shadow will be longest when the light is lowest.    The cast shadow will be shortest when the light is highest.    168.    Both the primary and derived shadow will be larger when caused by  the light of a candle than by diffused light. The difference between  the larger and smaller shadows will be in inverse proportion to the  larger and smaller lights causing them.    [Footnote: In the diagrams _A_ stands for _celo_ (sky), _B_ for  _cadela_ (candle).]    169.    ALL BODIES, IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE NEARER TO, OR FARTHER FROM THE  SOURCE OF LIGHT, WILL PRODUCE LONGER OR SHORTER DERIVED SHADOWS.    Among bodies of equal size, that one which is illuminated by the  largest light will have the shortest shadow. Experiment confirms  this proposition. Thus the body _m_ _n_ is surrounded by a larger  amount of light than the body _p q_, as is shown above. Let us say  that _v c a b d x_ is the sky, the source of light, and that _s t_  is a window by which the luminous rays enter, and so _m n_ and _p q_  are bodies in light and shade as exposed to this light; _m n_ will  have a small derived shadow, because its original shadow will be  small; and the derivative light will be large, again, because the  original light _c d_ will be large and _p q_ will have more derived  shadow because its original shadow will be larger, and its derived  light will be smaller than that of the body _m n_ because that  portion of the hemisphere _a b_ which illuminates it is smaller than  the hemisphere _c d_ which illuminates the body _m n_.    [Footnote: The diagram, given on Pl. IV, No. 2, stands in the  original between lines 2 and 7, while the text of lines 3 to 6 is  written on its left side. In the reproduction of this diagram the  letter _v_ at the outer right-hand end has been omitted.]    170.    The shadow _m_ bears the same proportion to the shadow _n_ as the  line _b c_ to the line _f c_.    171.    OF PAINTING.    Of different shadows of equal strength that which is nearest the eye  will seem the least strong.    Why is the shadow _e a b_ in the first grade of strength, _b c_ in  the second; _c d_ in the third? The reason is that as from _e a b_  the sky is nowhere visible, it gets no light whatever from the sky,  and so has no direct [primary] light. _b c_ faces the portion of the  sky _f g_ and is illuminated by it. _c d_ faces the sky at _h k_. _c  d_, being exposed to a larger extent of sky than _b c_, it is  reasonable that it should be more lighted. And thus, up to a certain  distance, the wall _a d_ will grow lighter for the reasons here  given, until the darkness of the room overpowers the light from the  window.    172.    When the light of the atmosphere is restricted [by an opening] and  illuminates bodies which cast shadows, these bodies being equally  distant from the centre of the window, that which is most obliquely  placed will cast the largest shadow beyond it.    173.    These bodies standing apart in a room lighted by a single window  will have derivative shadows more or less short according as they  are more or less opposite to the window. Among the shadows cast by  bodies of equal mass but at unequal distances from the opening by  which they are illuminated, that shadow will be the longest of the  body which is least in the light. And in proportion as one body is  better illuminated than another its shadow will be shorter than  another. The proportion _n m_ and _e v k_ bear to _r t_ and _v x_  corresponds with that of the shadow _x_ to 4 and _y_.    The reason why those bodies which are placed most in front of the  middle of the window throw shorter shadows than those obliquely  situated is:--That the window appears in its proper form and to the  obliquely placed ones it appears foreshortened; to those in the  middle, the window shows its full size, to the oblique ones it  appears smaller; the one in the middle faces the whole hemisphere  that is _e f_ and those on the side have only a strip; that is _q r_  faces _a b_; and _m n_ faces _c d_; the body in the middle having a  larger quantity of light than those at the sides is lighted from a  point much below its centre, and thus the shadow is shorter. And the  pyramid _g_ 4 goes into _l y_ exactly as often as _a b_ goes into _e  f_. The axis of every derivative shadow passes through 6 1/2  [Footnote 31: _passa per_ 6 1/2 (passes through 6 1/2). The meaning  of these words is probably this: Each of the three axes of the  derived shadow intersects the centre (_mezzo_) of the primary shadow  (_ombra originale_) and, by prolongation upwards crosses six lines.    This is self evident only in the middle diagram; but it is equally  true of the side figures if we conceive of the lines 4 _f_, _x n v  m_, _y l k v_, and 4 _e_, as prolonged beyond the semicircle of the  horizon.] and is in a straight line with the centre of the primary  shadow, with the centre of the body casting it and of the derivative  light and with the centre of the window and, finally, with the  centre of that portion of the source of light which is the celestial  hemisphere, _y h_ is the centre of the derived shade, _l h_ of the  primary shadow, _l_ of the body throwing it, _l k_ of the derived  light, _v_ is the centre of the window, _e_ is the final centre of  the original light afforded by that portion of the hemisphere of the  sky which illuminates the solid body.    [Footnote: Compare the diagram on Pl. IV, No. 3. In the original  this drawing is placed between lines 3 and 22; the rest, from line 4  to line 21, is written on the left hand margin.]    174.    THE FARTHER THE DERIVED SHADOW IS PROLONGED THE LIGHTER IT BECOMES.    You will find that the proportion of the diameter of the derived  shadow to that of the primary shadow will be the same as that  between the darkness of the primary shadow and that of the derived  shadow.    [Footnote 6: Compare No. 177.] Let _a b_ be the diameter of the  primary shadow and _c d_ that of the derived shadow, I say that _a  b_ going, as you "]]]
