[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#17)"],[1,"from now till Thanksgiving while you went off on another  trip. So I decided to do the thing myself. I thought I'd see how you  would like being left all alone to run the house. I thought it'd be  pretty nice for me to get things off my mind a while and have an  adventure of my own.    Now, Andrew, here are some directions for you:    1. Don't forget to feed the chickens twice a day, and collect _all_  the eggs. There's a nest behind the wood pile, and some of the  Wyandottes have been laying under the ice house.    2. Don't let Rosie touch grandmother's blue china, because she'll  break it as sure as fate if she lays her big, thick Swedish fingers  on it.    3. Don't forget your warmer underwear. The nights are getting  chilly.    4. I forgot to put the cover on the sewing machine. Please do that  for me or it'll get all dusty.    5. Don't let the cat run loose in the house at night: he always  breaks something.    6. Send your socks and anything else that needs darning over to Mrs.  McNally, she can do it for you.    7. Don't forget to feed the pigs.    8. Don't forget to mend the weathervane on the barn.    9. Don't forget to send that barrel of apples over to the cider mill  or you won't have any cider to drink when Mr. Decameron comes up to  see us later in the fall.    10. Just to make ten commandments, I'll add one more: You might  'phone to Mrs. Collins that the Dorcas will have to meet at some  one else's house next week, because I don't know just when I'll get  back. I may be away a fortnight more. This is my first holiday in a  long time and I'm going to chew it before I swallow it.    The Professor (Mr. Mifflin, I mean) has gone back to Brooklyn to  work on his book. I'm sorry you and he had to mix it up on the high  road like a couple of hooligans. He's a nice little man and you'd  like him if you got to know him.    I'm spending Sunday in Bath: to-morrow I'm going on toward Hastings.  I've sold five dollars' worth of books this morning even if it is  Sunday.    Your affte sister  HELEN McGiLL.    P.S. Don't forget to clean the separator after using it, or it'll  get in a fearful state.      After writing to Andrew I thought I would send a message to the  Professor. I had already written him a long letter in my mind, but  somehow when I began putting it on paper a sort of awkwardness came  over me. I didn't know just how to begin. I thought how much more  fun it would be if he were there himself and I could listen to him  talk. And then, while I was writing the first few sentences, some  of the drummers came back into the room.    \"Thought you'd like to see a Sunday paper,\" said one of them.    I picked up the newspaper with a word of thanks and ran an eye over  the headlines. The ugly black letters stood up before me, and my  heart gave a great contraction. I felt my fingertips turn cold.      DISASTROUS WRECK    ON THE SHORE LINE    EXPRESS RUNS INTO OPEN SWITCH    --    TEN LIVES LOST, AND    MORE THAN A SCORE INJURED    --    FAILURE OF BLOCK SIGNALS    The letters seemed to stand up before me as large as a Malted Milk  signboard. With a shuddering apprehension I read the details.  Apparently the express that left Providence at four o'clock on  Saturday afternoon had crashed into an open siding near Willdon  about six o'clock, and collided with a string of freight empties.  The baggage car had been demolished and the smoker had turned over  and gone down an embankment. There were ten men killed... my head  swam. Was that the train the Professor had taken? Let me see. He  left Woodbridge on a local train at three. He had said the day  before that the express left Port Vigor at five.... If he had  changed to the express.....    In a kind of fascinated horror my eye caught the list of the dead.  I ran down the names. Thank God, no, Mifflin was not among them.  Then I saw the last entry:    UNIDENTIFIED MAN, MIDDLE-AGED.    What if that should be the Professor?    And I suddenly felt dizzy, and for the first time in my life I  fainted.    Thank goodness, no one else was in the room. The drummers had gone  outside again, and no one heard me flop off the chair. I came to in  a moment, my heart whirling like a spinning top. At first I did not  realize what was wrong. Then my eye fell on the newspaper again.  Feverishly I re-read the account, and the names of the injured, too,  which I had missed before. Nowhere was there a name I knew. But the  tragic words \"unidentified man\" danced before my eyes. Oh! if it  were the Professor....    In a wave the truth burst upon me. I loved that little man: I loved  him, I loved him. He had brought something new into my life, and his  brave, quaint ways had warmed my fat old heart. For the first time,  in an intolerable gush of pain, I seemed to know that my life could  never again be endurable without him. And now--what was I to do?    How could I learn the truth? Certainly if he _had_ been on the  train, and had escaped from the wreck unhurt, he would have sent  a message to Sabine Farm to let me know. At any rate, that was a  possibility. I rushed to the telephone to call up Andrew.    Oh! the agonizing slowness of telephone connections when urgent  hurry is needed! My voice shook as I said \"Redfield 158 J\" to the  operator. Throbbing with nervousness I waited to hear the familiar  click of the receiver at the other end. I could hear the Redfield  switchboard receive the call, and put in the plug to connect with  our wire. In imagination I could see the telephone against the wall  in the old hallway at Sabine Farm. I could see the soiled patch of  plaster where Andrew rests his elbow when he talks into the 'phone,  and the place where he jots numbers down in pencil and I rub  them off with bread crumbs. I could see Andrew coming out of  the sitting-room to answer the bell. And then the operator said  carelessly, \"Doesn't answer.\" My forehead was wet as I came out  of the booth.    I hope I may never have to re-live the horrors of the next hour.  In spite of my bluff and hearty ways, in times of trouble I am as  reticent as a clam. I was determined to hide my agony and anxiety  from the well-meaning people of the Moose Hotel. I hurried to the  railway station to send a telegram to the Professor's address in  Brooklyn, but found the place closed. A boy told me it would not be  open until the afternoon. From a drugstore I called \"information\" in  Willdon, and finally got connected with some undertaker to whom the  Willdon operator referred me. A horrible, condoling voice (have you  ever talked to an undertaker over the telephone?) answered me that  no one by the name of Mifflin had been among the dead, but admitted  that there was one body still unidentified. He used one ghastly word  that made me shudder--unrecognizable. I rang off.    I knew then for the first time the horror of loneliness. I thought  of the poor little man's notebook that I had seen. I thought of his  fearless and lovable ways--of his pathetic little tweed cap, of the  missing button of his jacket, of the bungling darns on his frayed  sleeve. It seemed to me that heaven could mean nothing more than to  roll creaking along country roads, in Parnassus, with the Professor  beside me on the seat. What if I had known him only--how long was  it? He had brought the splendour of an ideal into my humdrum life.  And now--had I lost it forever? Andrew and the farm seemed faint and  far away. I was a homely old woman, mortally lonely and helpless.  In my perplexity I walked to the outskirts of the village and burst  into tears.    Finally I got a grip on myself again. I am not ashamed to say that  I now admitted frankly what I had been hiding from myself. I was in  love--in love with a little, red-bearded bookseller who seemed to me  more splendid than Sir Galahad. And I vowed that if he would have  me, I would follow him to the other end of nowhere.    I walked back to the hotel. I thought I would make one more try to  get Andrew on the telephone. My whole soul quivered when at last I  heard the receiver click.    \"Hello?\" said Andrew's voice.    \"Oh, Andrew,\" I said, \"this is Helen.\"    \"Where are you?\" (His voice sounded cross.)    \"Andrew, is there any--any message from Mr. Mifflin? That wreck  yesterday--he might have been on that train--I've been so  frightened; do you think he was--hurt?\"    \"Stuff and nonsense,\" said Andrew. \"If you want to know about  Mifflin, he's in jail in Port Vigor.\"    And then I think Andrew must have been surprised. I began to laugh  and cry simultaneously, and in my agitation I set down the receiver.        CHAPTER THIRTEEN      My first impulse was to hide myself in some obscure corner where I  could vent my feelings without fear or favour. I composed my face  as well as I could before leaving the 'phone booth; then I sidled  across the lobby and slipped out of the side door. I found my way  into the stable, where good old Peg was munching in her stall. The  fine, homely smell of horseflesh and long-worn harness leather went  right to my heart, and while Bock frisked at my knees I laid my head  on Peg's neck and cried. I think that fat old mare understood me.  She was as tubby and prosaic and middle-aged as I--but she loved the  Professor.    Suddenly Andrew's words echoed again in my mind. I had barely  heeded them before, in the great joy of my relief, but now their  significance came to me. \"In jail.\" The Professor in jail! That was  the meaning of his strange disappearance at Woodbridge. That little  brute of a man Shirley must have telephoned from Redfield, and when  the Professor came to the Woodbridge bank to cash that check they  had arrested him. That was why they had shoved me into that mahogany  sitting-room. Andrew must be behind this. The besotted old fool! My  face burned with anger and humiliation.    I never knew before what it means to be really infuriated. I could  feel my brain tingle. The Professor in jail! The gallant, chivalrous  little man,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5321"],[0,"Concerning the Spiritual in Art (#17)"],[1,"their art came upon them by  inspiration.
