As soon as  they understood this they laid down their lances, and bows and arrows,  and came and stuck twelve large stakes in the ground as a token of  peace, bowing themselves to us in token of submission. But as soon as  they saw white men with beards, that is to say, with mustachios, they  ran screaming away, as in a fright.    We kept at a distance from them, not to be too familiar; and when we did  appear it was but two or three of us at a time. But our prisoners  made them understand that we required some provisions of them; so  they brought us some black cattle, for they have abundance of cows and  buffaloes all over that side of the country, as also great numbers of  deer. Our cutler, who had now a great stock of things of his handiwork,  gave them some little knick-knacks, as plates of silver and of iron,  cut diamond fashion, and cut into hearts and into rings, and they were  mightily pleased. They also brought several fruits and roots, which we  did not understand, but our negroes fed heartily on them, and after we  had seen them eat them, we did so too.    Having stocked ourselves here with flesh and root as much as we could  well carry, we divided the burthens among our negroes, appointing about  thirty to forty pounds weight to a man, which we thought indeed was load  enough in a hot country; and the negroes did not at all repine at it,  but would sometimes help one another when they began to be weary, which  did happen now and then, though not often; besides, as most of their  luggage was our provision, it lightened every day, like Aesop's basket  of bread, till we came to get a recruit.--Note, when we loaded them we  untied their hands, and tied them two and two together by one foot.    The third day of our march from this place our chief carpenter desired  us to halt, and set up some huts, for he had found out some trees that  he liked, and resolved to make us some canoes; for, as he told me, he  knew we should have marching enough on foot after we left the river, and  he was resolved to go no farther by land than needs must.    We had no sooner given orders for our little camp, and given leave to  our negroes to lay down their loads, but they fell to work to build our  huts; and though they were tied as above, yet they did it so nimbly as  surprised us. Here we set some of the negroes quite at liberty, that is  to say, without tying them, having the prince's word passed for their  fidelity; and some of these were ordered to help the carpenters, which  they did very handily, with a little direction, and others were sent  to see whether they could get any provisions near hand; but instead of  provisions, three of them came in with two bows and arrows, and five  lances. They could not easily make us understand how they came by them,  only that they had surprised some negro women, who were in some huts,  the men being from home, and they had found the lances and bows in the  huts, or houses, the women and children flying away at the sight of  them, as from robbers. We seemed very angry at them, and made the prince  ask them if they had not killed any of the women or children, making  them believe that, if they had killed anybody, we would make them kill  themselves too; but they protested their innocence, so we excused them.  Then they brought us the bows and arrows and lances; but, at a motion of  their black prince, we gave them back the bows and arrows, and gave them  leave to go out to see what they could kill for food; and here we gave  them the laws of arms, viz., that if any man appeared to assault them,  or shoot at them to offer any violence to them, they might kill them;  but that they should not offer to kill or hurt any that offered them  peace, or laid down their weapons, nor any women or children, upon any  occasion whatsoever. These were our articles of war.    These two fellows had not been gone out above three or four hours, but  one of them came running to us without his bow and arrows, hallooing and  whooping a great while before he came at us, \"Okoamo, okoamo!\" which,  it seems, was, \"Help, help!\" The rest of the negroes rose up in a hurry,  and by twos, as they could, ran forward towards their fellows, to know  what the matter was. As for me, I did not understand it, nor any of our  people; the prince looked as if something unlucky had fallen out, and  some of our men took up their arms to be ready on occasion. But the  negroes soon discovered the thing, for we saw four of them presently  after coming along with a great load of meat upon their backs. The case  was, that the two who went out with their bows and arrows, meeting with  a great herd of deer in the plain, had been so nimble as to shoot three  of them, and then one of them came running to us for help to fetch them  away. This was the first venison we had met with in all our march, and  we feasted upon it very plentifully; and this was the first time we  began to prevail with our prince to eat his meat dressed our way; after  which his men were prevailed with by his example, but before that, they  ate most of the flesh they had quite raw.    We wished now we had brought some bows and arrows out with us, which we  might have done; and we began to have so much confidence in our negroes,  and to be so familiar with them, that we oftentimes let them go, or the  greatest part of them, untied, being well assured they would not leave  us, and that they did not know what course to take without us; but one  thing we resolved not to trust them with, and that was the charging our  guns: but they always believed our guns had some heavenly power in them,  that would send forth fire and smoke, and speak with a dreadful noise,  and kill at a distance whenever we bid them.    In about eight days we finished three canoes, and in them we embarked  our white men and our baggage, with our prince, and some of the  prisoners. We also found it needful to keep some of ourselves always on  shore, not only to manage the negroes, but to defend them from enemies  and wild beasts. Abundance of little incidents happened upon this march,  which it is impossible to crowd into this account; particularly, we  saw more wild beasts now than we did before, some elephants, and two or  three lions, none of which kinds we had seen any of before; and we  found our negroes were more afraid of them a great deal than we were;  principally, because they had no bows and arrows, or lances, which were  the particular weapons they were bred up to the exercise of.    But we cured them of their fears by being always ready with our  firearms. However, as we were willing to be sparing of our powder, and  the killing of any of the creatures now was no advantage to us, seeing  their skins were too heavy for us to carry, and their flesh not good to  eat, we resolved therefore to keep some of our pieces uncharged and only  primed; and causing them to flash in the pan, the beasts, even the  lions themselves, would always start and fly back when they saw it, and  immediately march off.    We passed abundance of inhabitants upon this upper part of the river,  and with this observation, that almost every ten miles we came to a  separate nation, and every separate nation had a different speech,  or else their speech had differing dialects, so that they did not  understand one another. They all abounded in cattle, especially on the  river-side; and the eighth day of this second navigation we met with  a little negro town, where they had growing a sort of corn like rice,  which ate very sweet; and, as we got some of it of the people, we made  very good cakes of bread of it, and, making a fire, baked them on the  ground, after the fire was swept away, very well; so that hitherto we  had no want of provisions of any kind that we could desire.    Our negroes towing our canoes, we travelled at a considerable rate, and  by our own account could not go less than twenty or twenty-five English  miles a day, and the river continuing to be much of the same breadth  and very deep all the way, till on the tenth day we came to another  cataract; for a ridge of high hills crossing the whole channel of the  river, the water came tumbling down the rocks from one stage to another  in a strange manner, so that it was a continued link of cataracts from  one to another, in the manner of a cascade, only that the falls were  sometimes a quarter of a mile from one another, and the noise confused  and frightful.    We thought our voyaging was at a full stop now; but three of us, with  a couple of our negroes, mounting the hills another way, to view the  course of the river, we found a fair channel again after about half a  mile's march, and that it was like to hold us a good way further. So  we set all hands to work, unloaded our cargo, and hauled our canoes on  shore, to see if we could carry them.    Upon examination we found that they were very heavy; but our carpenters,  spending but one day's work upon them, hewed away so much of the timber  from their outsides as reduced them very much, and yet they were as fit  to swim as before. When this was done, ten men with poles took up one  of the canoes and made nothing to carry it. So we ordered twenty men to  each canoe, that one ten might relieve the other; and thus we carried  all our canoes, and launched them into the water again, and then fetched  our luggage and loaded it all again into the canoes, and all in an  afternoon; and the next morning early we moved forward again. When we  had towed about four days more, our gunner, who was our pilot, began to  observe that we did not keep our right course so exactly as we ought,  the river winding away a little towards the north, and gave us notice  of it accordingly. However, we were not willing to lose the advantage of  water-carriage, at least not till we were forced to it; so we jogged on,  and the river served us for about threescore miles further; but then  we found it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6440"],[0,"Elsie Dinsmore (#17)"],[1,"hall, where she had left Lucy, when they saw a carriage  drive up to the front door.    \"There's papa!\" cried Lucy, joyfully, as it stopped and a gentleman  sprang out and came up the steps into the portico; and in an instant  she was in his arms, receiving such kisses and caresses as Elsie had  vainly longed for all her life.    Lucy had several brothers, but was an only daughter, and a very great  pet, especially with her father.    Elsie watched them with a wistful look and a strange aching at her  heart.    But presently Mr. Carrington set Lucy down and turning to her, gave her  a shake of the hand, and then a kiss, saying, \"How do you do this  morning, my dear? I'm afraid you are hardly glad to see me, as I come  to take Lucy away, for I suppose you have been having fine times  together.\"    \"Yes, sir, indeed we have; and I hope you will let her come again.\"    \"Oh! yes, certainly; but the visits must not be all on one side. I  shall talk to your papa about it, and perhaps persuade him to let us  take you along this afternoon to spend a week at Ashlands.\"    \"Oh! how delightful!\" cried Lucy, clapping her hands. \"Elsie, do you  think he will let you go?\"    \"I don't know, I'm afraid not,\" replied the little girl doubtfully.    \"You must coax him, as I do my papa,\" said Lucy.    But at this Elsie only shook her head, and just then the breakfast-bell  rang.    Mr. Dinsmore was already in the breakfast-room, and Elsie, going up to  him, said, \"Good morning, papa.\"    \"Good morning, Elsie,\" he replied, but his tone was so cold that even  if no one else had been by, she could not have said another word.    He had not intended to be influenced by the information Arthur had so  maliciously given him the night before; yet unconsciously he was, and  his manner to his little daughter was many degrees colder than it had  been for some time.    After breakfast Lucy reminded Elsie of a promise she had made to show  her some beautiful shells which her father had collected in his  travels, and Elsie led the way to the cabinet, a small room opening  into the library, and filled with curiosities.    They had gone in alone, but were soon followed by Arthur, Walter and  Enna.    Almost everything in the room belonged to Mr. Horace Dinsmore; and  Elsie, knowing that many of the articles were rare and costly, and that  he was very careful of them, begged Enna and the boys to go out, lest  they should accidentally do some mischief.    \"I won't,\" replied Arthur. \"I've just as good a right to be here as  you.\"    As he spoke he gave her a push, which almost knocked her over, and in  catching at a table to save herself from falling, she threw down a  beautiful vase of rare old china, which Mr. Dinsmore prized very  highly. It fell with a loud crash, and lay scattered in fragments at  their feet.    \"There, see what you've done!\" exclaimed Arthur, as the little group  stood aghast at the mischief.    It happened that Mr. Dinsmore was just then in the library, and the  noise soon brought him upon the scene of action.    \"Who did this?\" he asked, in a wrathful tone, looking from one to the  other.    \"Elsie,\" said Arthur; \"she threw it down and broke it.\"    \"Troublesome, careless child! I would not have taken a hundred dollars  for that vase,\" he exclaimed. \"Go to your room! go this instant, and  stay there until I send for you; and remember, if you ever come in here  again without permission I shall punish you.\"    He opened the door as he spoke, and Elsie flew across the hall, up the  stairs, and into her own room, without once pausing or looking back.    \"Now go out, every one of you, and don't come in here again; this is no  place for children,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, turning the others into the  hall, and shutting and locking the door upon them.    \"You ought to be ashamed, Arthur Dinsmore,\" exclaimed Lucy indignantly;  \"it was all your own fault, and Elsie was not to blame at all, and you  know it.\"    \"I didn't touch the old vase, and I'm not going to take the blame of  it, either, I can tell you, miss,\" replied Arthur, moving off, followed  by Walter and Enna, while Lucy walked to the other end of the hall, and  stood looking out of the window, debating in her own mind whether she  had sufficient courage to face Mr. Dinsmore, and make him understand  where the blame of the accident ought to lie.    At length she seemed to have solved the question; for turning about and  moving noiselessly down the passage to the library door, she gave a  timid little rap, which was immediately answered by Mr. Dinsmore's  voice saying, \"Come in.\"    Lucy opened the door and walked in, closing it after her.    Mr. Dinsmore sat at a table writing, and he looked up with an  expression of mingled surprise and impatience.    \"What do you want, Miss Lucy?\" he said, \"speak quickly, for I am very  busy.\"    \"I just wanted to tell you, sir,\" replied Lucy, speaking up quite  boldly, \"that Elsie was not at all to blame about the vase; for it was  Arthur who pushed her and made her fall against the table, and that was  the way the vase came to fall and break.\"    \"What made him push her?\" he asked.    \"Just because Elsie asked him, and Walter, and Enna to go out, for fear  they might do some mischief.\"    Mr. Dinsmore's pen was suspended over the paper for a moment, while he  sat thinking with a somewhat clouded brow; but presently turning to the  little girl, he said quite pleasantly, \"Very well, Miss Lucy, I am much  obliged to you for your information, for I should be very sorry to  punish Elsie unjustly. And now will you do me the favor to go to her  and tell her that her papa says she need not stay in her room any  longer?\"    \"Yes, sir, I will,\" replied Lucy, her face sparkling with delight as  she hurried off with great alacrity to do his bidding.    She found Elsie in her room crying violently, and throwing her arms  around her neck she delivered Mr. Dinsmore's message, concluding with,  \"So now, Elsie, you see you needn't cry, nor feel sorry any more; but  just dry your eyes and let us go down into the garden and have a good  time.\"    Elsie was very thankful to Lucy, and very glad that her papa now knew  that she was not to blame; but she was still sorry for his loss, and  his words had wounded her too deeply to be immediately forgotten;  indeed it was some time before the sore spot they had made in her heart  was entirely healed. But she tried to forget it all and enter heartily  into the sports proposed by Lucy.    The Carringtons were not to leave until the afternoon, and the little  girls spent nearly the whole morning in the garden, coming into the  drawing-room a few moments before the dinner-bell rang.    Mrs. Carrington sat on a sofa engaged with some fancy work, while  Herbert, who had not felt well enough to join the other children, had  stretched himself out beside her, putting his head in her lap.    Mr. Carrington and Mr. Horace Dinsmore were conversing near by.    Lucy ran up to her papa and seated herself upon his knee with her arm  around his neck; while Elsie stopped a moment to speak to Herbert, and  then timidly approaching her father, with her eyes upon the floor, said  in a low, half-frightened tone, that reached no ear but his, \"I am very  sorry about the vase, papa.\"    He took her hand, and drawing her close to him, pushed back the hair  from her forehead with his other hand, and bending down to her, said  almost in a whisper, \"Never mind, daughter, we will forget all about  it. I am sorry I spoke so harshly to you, since Lucy tells me you were  not so much to blame.\"    Elsie's face flushed with pleasure, and she looked up gratefully; but  before she had time to reply, Mrs. Carrington said, \"Elsie, we want to  take you home with us to spend a week; will you go?\"    \"I should like to, very much, indeed, ma'am, if papa will let me,\"  replied the little girl, looking wistfully up into his face.    \"Well, Mr. Dinsmore, what do you say? I hope you can have no  objection,\" said Mrs. Carrington, looking inquiringly at him; while her  husband added, \"Oh! yes, Dinsmore, you must let her go by all means;  you can certainly spare her for a week, and it need be no interruption  to her lessons, as she can share with Lucy in the instructions of our  governess, who is really a superior teacher.\"    Mr. Dinsmore was looking very grave, and Elsie knew from the expression  of his countenance what his answer would be, before he spoke. He had  noticed the indignant glance Lucy had once or twice bestowed upon him,  and remembering Arthur's report of the conversation between the two  little girls the night before, had decided in his own mind that the  less Elsie saw of Lucy the better.    \"I thank you both for your kind attention to my little girl,\" he  replied courteously, \"but while fully appreciating your kindness in  extending the invitation, I must beg leave to decline it, as I am  satisfied that home is the best place for her at present.\"    \"Ah! no, I suppose we ought hardly to have expected you to spare her so  soon after your return,\" said Mrs. Carrington; \"but, really, I am very  sorry to be refused, for Elsie is such a good child that I am always  delighted to have Lucy and Herbert with her.\"    \"Perhaps you think better of her than she deserves, Mrs. Carrington. I  find that Elsie is sometimes naughty and in need of correction, as well  as other children, and therefore, I think it best to keep her as much  as possible under my own eye,\" replied Mr. Dinsmore, looking very  gravely at his little daughter as he spoke.    Elsie's face flushed painfully, and she had hard work to keep from  bursting into tears. It was a great relief to her that just at that  moment the dinner-bell rang, and there was a general movement in the  direction of the dining-room. Her look was touchingly humble as her  father led her in and seated her at the table.    She was thinking, \"Papa says I am naughty sometimes, but oh! how _very_  naughty he would"]]]
