[180]        The Suzu Plan    On 17 August General Suzuki issued the Suzu orders for the defense  of the Visayan Islands and Mindanao by the 35th Army. The 100th  Division was to protect the Davao area on Mindanao while the 16th  Division would defend Leyte. Most of the 30th Division and two infantry  battalions were made mobile units which could be rushed to annihilate  the American force wherever it landed. However, if the Americans landed  simultaneously on Davao and Leyte, the main force of the 30th Division  was to be sent to Davao and the other mobile units would go to Leyte.    In late August, Suzuki received orders to dispose his troops as  follows: a reinforced division in the Davao area, three battalions in  the Sarangani Bay area, three battalions in the vicinity of Zamboanga,  two battalions in the Jolo Islands, a \"strong unit\" in the vicinity of  Surigao, and one division in the Leyte Gulf area. The 55th Independent  Mixed Brigade was to be assigned to the 35th Army. Units of the  16th Division which were in Luzon were sent to the 16th Division  on Leyte. These elements, which consisted of one engineer company,  an independent transportation unit, and a medical unit, were placed  under the commander of the 33d Infantry Regiment. [181]    Lt. Gen. Shiro Makino, commanding the 16th Division, which was the  major force on Leyte, had directed his efforts since April 1944  toward the construction of defensive positions on the island. The  first line of defense, which was on the east coast in the Dulag area,  was practically completed by the middle of October. The third defensive  line was in the middle of Leyte Valley in the vicinity of Dagami. The  second line of defense was between the two others, while the bulk of  supplies was assembled in the central mountain range at Jaro.    The distribution of the other troops at the time of the American  landings was as follows: one battalion of the 9th Infantry Regiment  in the Catmon Hill and Tanauan district, and the main strength of  the 33d Infantry Regiment in the Palo and Tacloban area. The larger  part of the 33d Infantry Regiment, which was less adequately trained  than the other regiments, had arrived on Leyte in mid-September from  Luzon. Its officers were unfamiliar with the terrain and did not  fortify their positions. [182]    On 17 October General Makino, having heard that American warships  had approached Leyte Gulf, alerted the 16th Division for the  impending battle and ordered all units to \"shatter the enemy landing  attempts.\" [183] On 18 October the 14th Area Army received a report  from the 16th Division which indicated that the latter was not certain  the vessels sighted off Leyte were an enemy attacking force. They  might be ships seeking safety from the storms, or vessels damaged in  the naval battle off Formosa. Consequently, 14th Area Army was not  sure that an attack was imminent at Leyte. [184]        Plans for the 4th Air Army    The principal assignment of the 4th Air Army was to attack  American transports and interdict American shipping and, if given  the opportunity, to attack the American combatant vessels. The  4th Air Army was also to give aerial support to the movement of  reinforcements. [185]    In October the 4th Air Army issued a plan for anticipated  operations. In co-operation with the Army and the Navy, the 4th Air  Army would attempt to destroy the American forces when they struck the  Philippines. The Army air force in concert with the naval air units  would try to destroy carrier-based planes and air bases. In operations  against the American fleet, the Army and Navy air units were to have  \"a unified and tactful commitment.\" If the naval air units could not  co-operate the Army air force was to venture a surprise attack with  a few planes. Dusk, night, and dawn attacks were to be made against  Allied air bases and all means exerted to foil Allied attempts to  establish advance bases in the Philippines. The main strength of the  fighter units was to move into the central and southern Philippines in  order to destroy the principal American landing force. The mission  of the Japanese 4th Air Army, operating from Mindanao, Celebes,  and northern Borneo, would be restricted to checking the current  attempts on the part of the Americans to establish bases on Halmahera  and western New Guinea and the destruction of the planes there. For  this purpose the Japanese air force would use bases in the southern  Philippines.    When the American convoy was sighted moving toward the Philippines, the  heavy bombers were to deploy to the central and southern Philippines  and make preparations for an immediate attack on the convoy after it  had arrived in the harbor. The fighter units were to attack Allied  aircraft and, if the circumstances were propitious, were also to attack  the convoy. If the Americans should attempt simultaneous landings at  various points, the Japanese Army air forces would \"try to annihilate  the landing parties one by one,\" [186] acting in concert with the  Japanese Navy.    Capt. Toshikazu Ohmae, the chief of staff to the commander in chief of  the Japanese Third Fleet, was highly critical of the liaison between  the Army and Navy air forces. \"The Army and Navy always quarreled  with each other. In theory they were supposed to cooperate and on the  higher levels it would work, but personalities were the trouble.\" [187]        Japanese Navy Plans    On 21 July 1944 Admiral Toyoda received a directive which laid down  the basic policies for subsequent \"urgent operations.\" A great deal  of the contracting empire was abandoned. The Southwest Area, which  embraced the region from Manila to Singapore, was ordered to \"maintain  security of resources areas, hold vital sectors for their defense, and  place emphasis on protection for fleet anchorages.\" Thus the Japanese  planned to restrict battle \"to the homeland and to the island chain  which protected the last links\" of the empire with the south. The  forces in the Japanese home islands, the Ryukyu chain, Formosa, and  the Philippine Islands were told to take \"all measures to expedite the  establishment of conditions to cope with decisive battle. In event  of enemy attack, summon all strength which can be concentrated and  hold vital sectors, in general intercepting and destroying the enemy  within the operational sphere of planes of our base air force.\" [188]    The success of Admiral Halsey's carrier strikes against Formosa had  considerably weakened the strength of Japanese carrier-based planes,  and less than one half of the Army planes remained. The necessity  of sending reinforcements to Formosa also weakened considerably the  Japanese aerial defense of the Philippines. The enemy became almost  completely dependent upon the remaining land-based planes. [189] Within  their capabilities the Japanese had made their plans and readied their  forces, as the American convoy steamed towards Leyte to do battle.          Securing the Channel Approaches    Landings of the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion    The forward part of the convoy, which was carrying the 6th Ranger  Infantry Battalion, commanded by Lt. Col. Henry A. Mucci, had  experienced stormy weather since leaving Hollandia, but by dawn of the  17th the storm had slackened, though the ocean was still choppy. The  transports carrying the reinforced 6th Ranger Battalion, preceded by  three mine sweepers, entered Leyte Gulf. [190]    The USS Crosby, carrying Company D, arrived on schedule off Suluan  Island, the outermost of the islands guarding Leyte Gulf. For twenty  minutes the cruiser Denver shelled the island. Under lowering skies  and in a driving rain which rendered impossible the anticipated air  support, [191] Company D, under 1st Lt. Leslie M. Gray, disembarked  from the transport and headed for the island in landing craft. The  mission of the unit was to secure mine charts which were believed to be  located in a lighthouse on the island. At 0805 the boats touched shore.    The landing was unopposed. The men immediately filed south 500  yards on a trail along the coast and then headed east toward the  lighthouse. On the way, four buildings, one of which contained a  Japanese radio, were found and set ablaze. The company then continued  along the trail. Suddenly the enemy fired from a concealed position,  killing one man and wounding another. When Company D went into attack  formation, the enemy force disappeared into the heavy jungle bordering  the trail. The march was resumed and the company reached its objective  without further incident. The lighthouse, which had been damaged by  naval bombardment, and adjoining buildings were deserted. [192]    In searching the documents found in the lighthouse, the company failed  to turn up the hoped-for enemy mine charts. [193] It returned to the  beachhead area and, finding that the landing boats had been hopelessly  battered and broken up by the surf, formed a perimeter for the night.    As Company D was moving along the coast of Suluan Island, naval fire  blasted away at the extreme northwest coast of Dinagat Island. At 0900  the first assault waves of the 6th Rangers, minus Companies D and B,  started for the beach. Although coral reefs approximately one hundred  yards offshore grounded the boats so that the men had to wade the  remainder of the distance, the companies were all ashore by 1230.

The holly-hock is a kingly flower, with its regally  lifted heads of bright bloom, and that the king of moths should show  his preference for it seems eminently fitting, so we of the Cabin  named him King of the Hollyhocks.        CHAPTER VIII   Hera of the Corn: Hyperchira Io      At the same time he gave me the Eacles Imperialis moths, Mr. Eisen  presented me with a pair of Hyperchiria Io.  They were nicely mounted  on the black velvet lining of a large case in my room, but I did not  care for them in the least.  A picture I would use could not be made  from dead, dried specimens, and history learned from books is not worth  knowing, in comparison with going afield and threshing it out for  yourself in your own way.  Because the Io was yellow, I wanted it--more  than several specimens I had not found as yet, for yellow, be it  on the face of a flower, on the breast of a bird, or in the gold of  sunshine, always warms the depths of my heart.    One night in June, sitting with a party of friends in the library,  a shadow seemed to sweep across a large window in front.  I glanced  up, and arose with a cry that must have made those present doubt my  sanity.  A perfect and beautiful Io was walking leisurely across the  glass.    \"A moth!\" I cried.  \"I have none like it!  Deacon, get the net!\"    I caught a hat from the couch, and ran to the veranda.  The Deacon  followed with the net.    \"I was afraid to wait,\" I explained.  \"Please bring a piece of  pasteboard, the size of this brim.\"    I held the hat while the Deacon brought the board.  Then with  trembling care we slipped it under, and carefully carried the moth  into the conservatory.  First we turned on the light, and made sure  that every ventilator was closed; then we released the Io for  the night.  In the morning we found a female clinging to a shelf,  dotting it with little top-shaped eggs.  I was delighted, for I  thought this meant the complete history of a beautiful moth.  So  exquisite was the living, breathing creature, she put to shame the  form and colouring of the mounted specimens.  No wonder I had not  cared for them!    Her fore-wings were a strong purplish brown in general effect, but  on close examination one found the purplish tinge a commingling of  every delicate tint of lavender and heliotrope imaginable.  They were  crossed by escalloped bands of greyish white, and flecked with touches  of the same, seeming as if they had been placed with a brush.  The  back wings were a strong yellow.  Each had, for its size, an immense  black eye-spot, with a blue pupil covering three-fourths of it, crossed  by a perfect comma of white, the heads toward the front wings and the  curves bending outward.  Each eye-spot was in a yellow field, strongly  circled with a sharp black line; then a quarter of an inch band of  yellow; next a heliotrope circle of equal width; yellow again twice as  wide; then a faint heliotrope line; and last a very narrow edging of  white.  Both wings joined the body under a covering of long, silky,  purple-brown hairs.    She was very busy with egg depositing, and climbed to the twig  held before her without offering to fly.  The camera was carried to  the open, set up and focused on a favourable spot, while Molly-Cotton  walked beside me holding a net over the moth in case she took flight  in outer air.  The twig was placed where she would be in the deepest  shade possible while I worked rapidly with the camera.    By this time experience had taught me that these creatures of  moonlight and darkness dislike the open glare of day, and if placed  in sunlight will take flight in search of shade more quickly than  they will move if touched.  So until my Io settled where I wanted  her with the wings open, she was kept in the shadow.  Only when I  grasped the bulb and stood ready to snap, was the covering lifted,  and for the smallest fraction of a second the full light fell on  her; then darkness again.    In three days it began to be apparent there was something wrong  with the eggs.  In four it was evident, and by five I was not  expecting the little caterpillars to emerge, and they did not.  The moth had not mated and the eggs were not fertile.  Then I saw  my mistake.  Instead of shutting the female in the conservatory  at night, I should have tied a soft cotton string firmly around  her body, and fastened it to some of the vines on the veranda.  Beyond all doubt, before morning, a male of her kind would have  been attracted to her.    One learns almost as much by his mistakes as he profits by his  successes in this world.  Writing of this piece of stupidity,  at a time in my work with moths when a little thought would  have taught me better, reminds me of an experience I had with  a caterpillar, the first one I ever carried home and tried to  feed.  I had an order to fill for some swamp pictures, and was  working almost waist deep in a pool in the Limberlost, when on  a wild grape-vine swinging close to my face, I noticed a big  caterpillar placidly eating his way around a grape leaf.  The caterpillar was over four inches long, had no horn, and was  of a clear red wine colour, that was beautiful in the sunlight.  I never before had seen a moth caterpillar that was red and I  decided it must be rare.  As there was a wild grapevine growing  over the east side of the Cabin, and another on the windmill,  food of the right kind would be plentiful, so I instantly  decided to take the caterpillar home.  It was of the specimens  that I consider have almost 'thrust themselves upon me.'    When the pictures were finished and my camera carried from the  swamp, I returned with the clippers and cut off vine and  caterpillar, to carry  with me.  On arrival I placed it in a  large box with sand on the bottom, and every few hours took out  the wilted leaves, put in fresh ones, and sprinkled them to insure  crispness, and to give a touch of moisture to the atmosphere in  the box, that would make it seem more like the swamp.    My specimen was readily identified as Philampelus Pandorus, of  which I had no moth, so I took extra care of it in the hope of a  new picture in the spring.  It had a little flat head that could be  drawn inside the body like a turtle, and on the sides were oblique  touches of salmon.  Something that appeared to be a place for a  horn could be seen, and a yellow tubercle was surrounded by a  black line.  It ate for three days, and then began racing so  frantically around the box, I thought confinement must be harmful,  so I gave it the freedom of the Cabin, warning all my family to  'look well to their footsteps.'  It stopped travelling after a day  or two at a screen covering the music-room window, and there I  found it one morning lying still, a shrivelled, shrunken thing;  only half the former length, so it was carefully picked up, and  thrown away!    Of course the caterpillar was in the process of changing into the  pupa, and if I had known enough to lay it on the sand in my box,  and wait a few days, without doubt a fine pupa would have emerged  from that shrunken skin, from which, in the spring, I could have  secured an exquisite moth, with shades of olive green, flushed  with pink.  The thought of it makes me want to hide my head.  It was six years before I found a living moth, or saw another  caterpillar of that species.    A few days later, while watching with a camera focused on the nest  of a blackbird in Mrs. Corson's woods east of town, Raymond, who  was assisting me, crept to my side and asked if it would do any  harm for him to go specimen hunting.  The long waits with set  cameras were extremely tedious to the restless spirits of the boy,  and the birds were quite tame, the light was under a cloud, and  the woods were so deep that after he had gone a few rods he was  from sight, and under cover; besides it was great hunting ground,  so I gladly told him to go.    The place was almost 'virgin,' much of it impassable and fully  half of it was under water that lay in deep, murky  pools  throughout summer.  In the heat of late June everything was steaming;  insect life of all kinds was swarming; not far away I could hear  sounds of trouble between the crow and hawk tribes; and overhead  a pair of black vultures, whose young lay in a big stump in the  interior, were searching for signs of food.  If ever there was a  likely place for specimens it was here; Raymond was an expert  at locating them, and fearless to foolhardiness.  He had been gone  only a short time when I heard a cry, and I knew it must mean  something, in his opinion, of more importance than blackbirds.    I answered \"Coming,\" and hastily winding the long hose, I started  in the direction Raymond had taken, calling occasionally to make  sure I was going the right way.  When I found him, the boy was  standing beside a stout weed, hat in hand, intently watching  something.  As I leaned forward I saw that it was a Hyperchiria Io  that just had emerged from the cocoon, and as yet was resting with  wings untried.  It differed so widely from my moth of a few days  before, I knew it must be a male.    This was only three-fourths as large as mine, but infinitely  surpassed it in beauty.  Its front wings were orange-yellow, flushed  with red-purple at the base, and had a small irregular brown spot  near the costa.  Contrary to all precedent, the under side of  these wings were the most beautiful, and bore the decorations that,  in all previous experience with moths, had been on the upper surface,  faintly showing on the under.  For instance, this irregular  brown marking on the upper side proved to be a good-sized black  spot with with white dot in the middle on the under; and there was  a curved line of red-purple from the apex of the wing sloping to  the lower edge, nearly half an inch from the margin.  The space  from this line to the base of the wing was covered with red-purpl"]]]
