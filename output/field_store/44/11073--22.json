I sat for a long time in a  happy dream, remembering all the glimpses I had had of her, and humming  her song to an audience of one black-faced sheep.    On the highroad half a mile below me, I saw a figure on a bicycle  mounting the hill, and then getting off to mop its face at the summit.  I turned my Ziess glasses on to it, and observed that it was a country  policeman. It caught sight of me, stared for a bit, tucked its machine  into the side of the road, and then very slowly began to climb the  hillside. Once it stopped, waved its hand and shouted something which I  could not hear. I sat finishing my luncheon, till the features were  revealed to me of a fat oldish man, blowing like a grampus, his cap  well on the back of a bald head, and his trousers tied about the shins  with string.    There was a spring beside me and I had out my flask to round off my  meal.    'Have a drink,' I said.    His eye brightened, and a smile overran his moist face.    'Thank you, sir. It will be very warrm coming up the brae.'    'You oughtn't to,' I said. 'You really oughtn't, you know. Scorching up  hills and then doubling up a mountain are not good for your time of  life.'    He raised the cap of my flask in solemn salutation. 'Your very good  health.' Then he smacked his lips, and had several cupfuls of water  from the spring.    'You will haf come from Achranich way, maybe?' he said in his soft  sing-song, having at last found his breath.    'Just so. Fine weather for the birds, if there was anybody to shoot  them.'    'Ah, no. There will be few shots fired today, for there are no  gentlemen left in Morvern. But I wass asking you, if you come from  Achranich, if you haf seen anybody on the road.'    From his pocket he extricated a brown envelope and a bulky telegraph  form. 'Will you read it, sir, for I haf forgot my spectacles?'    It contained a description of one Brand, a South African and a  suspected character, whom the police were warned to stop and return to  Oban. The description wasn't bad, but it lacked any one good  distinctive detail. Clearly the policeman took me for an innocent  pedestrian, probably the guest of some moorland shooting-box, with my  brown face and rough tweeds and hobnailed shoes.    I frowned and puzzled a little. 'I did see a fellow about three miles  back on the hillside. There's a public-house just where the burn comes  in, and I think he was making for it. Maybe that was your man. This  wire says \"South African\"; and now I remember the fellow had the look  of a colonial.'    The policeman sighed. 'No doubt it will be the man. Perhaps he will haf  a pistol and will shoot.'    'Not him,' I laughed. 'He looked a mangy sort of chap, and he'll be  scared out of his senses at the sight of you. But take my advice and  get somebody with you before you tackle him. You're always the better  of a witness.'    'That is so,' he said, brightening. 'Ach, these are the bad times! in  old days there wass nothing to do but watch the doors at the  flower-shows and keep the yachts from poaching the sea-trout. But now  it is spies, spies, and \"Donald, get out of your bed, and go off twenty  mile to find a German.\" I wass wishing the war wass by, and the Germans  all dead.'    'Hear, hear!' I cried, and on the strength of it gave him another dram.    I accompanied him to the road, and saw him mount his bicycle and  zig-zag like a snipe down the hill towards Achranich. Then I set off  briskly northward. It was clear that the faster I moved the better.    As I went I paid disgusted tribute to the efficiency of the Scottish  police. I wondered how on earth they had marked me down. Perhaps it was  the Glasgow meeting, or perhaps my association with Ivery at  Biggleswick. Anyhow there was somebody somewhere mighty quick at  compiling a _dossier_. Unless I wanted to be bundled back to Oban I  must make good speed to the Arisaig coast.    Presently the road fell to a gleaming sea-loch which lay like the blue  blade of a sword among the purple of the hills. At the head there was a  tiny clachan, nestled among birches and rowans, where a tawny burn  wound to the sea. When I entered the place it was about four o'clock in  the afternoon, and peace lay on it like a garment. In the wide, sunny  street there was no sign of life, and no sound except of hens clucking  and of bees busy among the roses. There was a little grey box of a  kirk, and close to the bridge a thatched cottage which bore the sign of  a post and telegraph office.    For the past hour I had been considering that I had better prepare for  mishaps. If the police of these parts had been warned they might prove  too much for me, and Gresson would be allowed to make his journey  unmatched. The only thing to do was to send a wire to Amos and leave  the matter in his hands. Whether that was possible or not depended upon  this remote postal authority.    I entered the little shop, and passed from bright sunshine to a  twilight smelling of paraffin and black-striped peppermint balls. An  old woman with a mutch sat in an arm-chair behind the counter. She  looked up at me over her spectacles and smiled, and I took to her on  the instant. She had the kind of old wise face that God loves.    Beside her I noticed a little pile of books, one of which was a Bible.  Open on her lap was a paper, the _United Free Church Monthly_. I  noticed these details greedily, for I had to make up my mind on the  part to play.    'It's a warm day, mistress,' I said, my voice falling into the broad  Lowland speech, for I had an instinct that she was not of the Highlands.    She laid aside her paper. 'It is that, sir. It is grand weather for the  hairst, but here that's no till the hinner end o' September, and at the  best it's a bit scart o' aits.'    'Ay. It's a different thing down Annandale way,' I said.    Her face lit up. 'Are ye from Dumfries, sir?'    'Not just from Dumfries, but I know the Borders fine.'    'Ye'll no beat them,' she cried. 'Not that this is no a guid place and  I've muckle to be thankfu' for since John Sanderson--that was ma  man--brought me here forty-seeven year syne come Martinmas. But the  aulder I get the mair I think o' the bit whaur I was born. It was twae  miles from Wamphray on the Lockerbie road, but they tell me the place  is noo just a rickle o' stanes.'    'I was wondering, mistress, if I could get a cup of tea in the village.'    'Ye'll hae a cup wi' me,' she said. 'It's no often we see onybody frae  the Borders hereaways. The kettle's just on the boil.'    She gave me tea and scones and butter, and black-currant jam, and  treacle biscuits that melted in the mouth. And as we ate we talked of  many things--chiefly of the war and of the wickedness of the world.    'There's nae lads left here,' she said. 'They a' joined the Camerons,  and the feck o' them fell at an awfu' place called Lowse. John and me  never had no boys, jist the one lassie that's married on Donald Frew,  the Strontian carrier. I used to vex mysel' about it, but now I thank  the Lord that in His mercy He spared me sorrow. But I wad hae liked to  have had one laddie fechtin' for his country. I whiles wish I was a  Catholic and could pit up prayers for the sodgers that are deid. It  maun be a great consolation.'    I whipped out the _Pilgrim's Progress_ from my pocket. 'That is the  grand book for a time like this.'    'Fine I ken it,' she said. 'I got it for a prize in the Sabbath School  when I was a lassie.'    I turned the pages. I read out a passage or two, and then I seemed  struck with a sudden memory.    'This is a telegraph office, mistress. Could I trouble you to send a  telegram? You see I've a cousin that's a minister in Ross-shire at the  Kyle, and him and me are great correspondents. He was writing about  something in the _Pilgrim's Progress_ and I think I'll send him a  telegram in answer.'    'A letter would be cheaper,' she said.    'Ay, but I'm on holiday and I've no time for writing.'    She gave me a form, and I wrote:       _Ochterlony. Post Office, Kyle.--Demas will be at his mine     within the week. Strive with him, lest I faint by the way._    'Ye're unco lavish wi' the words, sir,' was her only comment.    We parted with regret, and there was nearly a row when I tried to pay  for the tea. I was bidden remember her to one David Tudhole, farmer in  Nether Mirecleuch, the next time I passed by Wamphray.    The village was as quiet when I left it as when I had entered. I took  my way up the hill with an easier mind, for I had got off the telegram,  and I hoped I had covered my tracks. My friend the postmistress would,  if questioned, be unlikely to recognize any South African suspect in  the frank and homely traveller who had spoken with her of Annandale and  the _Pilgrim's Progress_.    The soft mulberry gloaming of the west coast was beginning to fall on  the hills. I hoped to put in a dozen miles before dark to the next  village on the map, where I might find quarters. But ere I had gone far  I heard the sound of a motor behind me, and a car slipped past bearing  three men. The driver favoured me with a sharp glance, and clapped on  the brakes. I noted that the two men in the tonneau were carrying  sporting rifles.    'Hi, you, sir,' he cried. 'Come here.' The two rifle-bearers--solemn  gillies--brought their weapons to attention.    'By God,' he said, 'it's the man. What's your name? Keep him covered,  Angus.'    The gillies duly covered me, and I did not like the look of their  wavering barrels. They were obviously as surprised as myself.    I had about half a second to make my plans. I advanced with a very  stiff air, and asked him what the devil he meant. No Lowland Scots for  me now. My tone was that of an adjutant of a Guards' battalion.    My inquisitor was a tall man in an ulster, with a green felt hat on his  small head. He had a lean, well-bred face, and very choleric blue eyes.

In the genus Acanthus the cotyledons are likewise hypogean. In A. mollis, a  single leaf first breaks through the ground with its petiole arched, and  with the opposite leaf much less developed, short, straight, of a yellowish  colour, and with the petiole at first not half as thick as that of the  other. The undeveloped leaf is protected by standing beneath its arched  fellow; and it is an instruc-  [page 79]  tive fact that it is not arched, as it has not to force for itself a  passage through the ground. In the accompanying sketch (Fig. 58) the  petiole of the first leaf has already partially straightened itself, and  the blade is beginning to unfold. The small second leaf ultimately grows to  an equal size with the first, but this process is effected at very  different rates in different individuals: in one instance the second leaf  did not appear fully above the ground until six weeks after the first leaf.  As the leaves in the whole family of the Acanthaceae stand either opposite  one another or in whorls, and as these are of equal size, the great  inequality between the first two leaves is a singular fact. We can see how  this inequality of development and the arching of the petiole could have  been gradually acquired, if they were beneficial to the seedlings by  favouring their emergence; for with A. candelabrum, spinosus, and  latifolius there was a great variability in the inequality between the two  first leaves and in the arching of their petioles. In one seedling of A.  candelabrum the first leaf was arched and nine times as long as the second,  which latter consisted of a mere little, yellowish-white, straight, hairy  style. In other seedlings the difference in length between the two leaves  was as 3 to 2, or as 4 to 3, or as only .76 to .62 inch. In these latter  cases the first and taller leaf was not properly arched. Lastly, in another  seedling there was not the least difference in size between the two first  leaves, and both of them had their petioles straight; their laminae were  enfolded and pressed against each other, forming a lance or wedge, by which  means they had broken through the ground. Therefore in different  individuals of this same species of Acanthus the first pair of leaves  breaks through the ground by two widely different methods; and if  [page 80]  either had proved decidedly advantageous or disadvantageous, one of them no  doubt would soon have prevailed.    Asa Gray has described* the peculiar manner of germination of three widely  different plants, in which the hypocotyl is hardly at all developed. These  were therefore observed by us in relation to our present subject.    Delphinium nudicaule.--The elongated petioles of the two cotyledons are  confluent (as are sometimes their blades at the base), and they break  through the ground as an arch. They thus resemble in a most deceptive  manner a hypocotyl. At first they are solid, but after a time become  tubular; and the basal part beneath the ground is enlarged into a hollow  chamber, within which the young leaves are developed without any prominent  plumule. Externally root-hairs are formed on the confluent petioles, either  a little above, or on a level with, the plumule. The first leaf at an early  period of its growth and whilst within the chamber is quite straight, but  the petiole soon becomes arched; and the swelling of this part (and  probably of the blade) splits open one side of the chamber, and the leaf  then emerges. The slit was found in one case to be 3.2 mm. in length, and  it is seated on the line of confluence of the two petioles. The leaf when  it first escapes from the chamber is buried beneath the ground, and now an  upper part of the petiole near the blade becomes arched in the usual  manner. The second leaf comes out of the slit either straight or somewhat  arched, but afterwards the upper part of the petiole,--certainly in some,  and we believe in all cases,--arches itself whilst forcing a passage  through the soil.    * 'Botanical Text-Book,' 1879, p. 22.  [page 81]    Megarrhiza Californica.--The cotyledons of this Gourd never free themselves  from the seed-coats and are hypogean. Their petioles are completely  confluent, forming a tube which terminates downwards in a little solid  point, consisting of a minute radicle and hypocotyl, with the likewise  minute plumule enclosed within the base of the tube. This structure was  well exhibited in an abnormal specimen, in which one of the two cotyledons  failed to produce a petiole, whilst the other produced one consisting of an  open semicylinder ending in a sharp point, formed of the parts just  described. As soon as the confluent petioles protrude from the seed they  bend down, as they are strongly geotropic, and penetrate the ground. The  seed itself retains its original position, either on the surface or buried  at some depth, as the case may be. If, however, the point of the confluent  petioles meets with some obstacle in the soil, as appears to have occurred  with the seedlings described and figured by Asa Gray,* the cotyledons are  lifted up above the ground. The petioles are clothed with root-hairs like  those on a true radicle, and they likewise resemble radicles in becoming  brown when immersed in a solution of permanganate of potassium. Our seeds  were subjected to a high temperature, and in the course of three or four  days the petioles penetrated the soil perpendicularly to a depth of from 2  to 2 ½ inches; and not until then did the true radicle begin to grow. In  one specimen which was closely observed, the petioles in 7 days after their  first protrusion attained a length of 2 ½ inches, and the radicle by this  time had also become well developed. The plumule, still enclosed within the  tube, was now    * 'American Journal of Science,' vol. xiv. 1877, p. 21.  [page 82]    .3 inch in length, and was quite straight; but from having increased in  thickness it had just begun to split open the lower part of the petioles on  one side, along the line of their confluence. By the following morning the  upper part of the plumule had arched itself into a right angle, and the  convex side or elbow had thus been forced out through the slit. Here then  the arching of the plumule plays the same part as in the case of the  petioles of the Delphinium. As the plumule continued to grow, the tip  became more arched, and in the course of six days it emerged through the 2  ½ inches of superincumbent soil, still retaining its arched form. After  reaching the surface it straightened itself in the usual manner. In the  accompanying figure (Fig. 58, A) we have a sketch of a seedling in this  advanced state of development; the surface of the ground being represented  by the line G...........G.    Fig. 58, A. Megarrhiza Californica: sketch of seedling, copied from Asa  Gray, reduced to one-half scale: c, cotyledons within seed-coats; p, the  two confluent petioles; h and r, hypocotyl and radicle; p1, plumule;  G..........G, surface of soil.    The germination of the seeds in their native Californian home proceeds in a  rather different manner, as we infer from an interesting letter from Mr.  Rattan, sent to us by Prof. Asa Gray. The petioles protrude from the seeds  soon after the autumnal rains, and penetrate the ground, generally in a  vertical direction, to a depth of from 4 to even 6 inches. they were found  in this state by Mr. Rattan during the Christmas vacation, with the plu-  [page 83]  mules still enclosed within the tubes; and he remarks that if the plumules  had been at once developed and had reached the surface (as occurred with  our seeds which were exposed to a high temperature), they would surely have  been killed by the frost. As it is, they lie dormant at some depth beneath  the surface, and are thus protected from the cold; and the root-hairs on  the petioles would supply them with sufficient moisture. We shall hereafter  see that many seedlings are protected from frost, but by a widely different  process, namely, by being drawn beneath the surface by the contraction of  their radicles. We may, however, believe that the extraordinary manner of  germination of Megarrhiza has another and secondary advantage. The radicle  begins in a few weeks to enlarge into a little tuber, which then abounds  with starch and is only slightly bitter. It would therefore be very liable  to be devoured by animals, were it not protected by being buried whilst  young and tender, at a depth of some inches beneath the surface. Ultimately  it grows to a huge size.    Ipomoea leptophylla.--In most of the species of this genus the hypocotyl is  well developed, and breaks through the ground as an arch. But the seeds of  the present species in germinating behave like those of Megarrhiza,  excepting that the elongated petioles of the cotyledons are not confluent.  After they have protruded from the seed, they are united at their lower  ends with the undeveloped hypocotyl and undeveloped radicle, which together  form a point only about .1 inch in length. They are at first highly  geotropic, and penetrate the ground to a depth of rather above half an  inch. The radicle then begins to grow. On four occasions after the petioles  had grown for a short distance vertically downwards, they  [page 84]  were placed in a horizontal position in damp air in the dark, and in the  course of 4 hours they again became curved vertically downwards, having  passed through 90o in this time. But their sensitiveness to geotropism  lasts for only 2 or 3 days; and the terminal part alone, for a length of  between .2 and .4 inch, is thus sensitive. Although the petioles of our  specimens did not penetrate the ground to a greater depth than about ½  inch, yet they continued for some time to grow rapidly, and finally  attained the great length of about 3 inches. The upper part is  apogeotropic, and therefore grows vertically upwards, excepting a short  portion close to the blades, which at an"]]]
