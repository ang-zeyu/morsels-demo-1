It  will sarve our turn out they say. There's neither spirit,  enterprise, nor patriotism here; but the whole country  is as inactive as a bear in winter, that does nothin but  scroutch up in his den, a thinkin to himself, \"well if  I ant an unfortunate divil, it's a pity; I have a most  splendid warm coat as are a gentleman in these here woods,  let him be who he will; but I got no socks to my feet,  and have to sit for everlastingly a suckin of my paws to  keep 'em warm; if it warn't for that, I guess, I'd make  some o' them chaps that have hoofs to their feet and  horns to their heads, look about them pretty sharp, I  know.\" It's dismal now, aint it? If I had the framin of  the Governor's message, if I would'nt shew 'em how to  put timber together you may depend, I'd make them scratch  their heads and stare, I know. I went down to Matanzas  in the Fulton Steam Boat once--well, it was the first of  the kind they ever see'd, and proper scared they were to  see a vessel, without sails or oars, goin right straight  ahead, nine knots an hour, in the very wind's eye, and  a great streak of smoke arter her as long as the tail of  a Comet. I believe they thought it was old Nick alive, a  treatin him self to a swim. You could see the niggers a  clippin it away from the shore, for dear life, and the  soldiers a movin about as if they thought that we were  a goin to take the whole country. Presently a little half  starved orange-coloured looking Spanish officer, all  dressed off in his livery, as fine as a fiddle, came off  with two men in a boat to board us. Well, we yawed once  or twice, and motioned to him to keep off for fear he  should get hurt; but be came right on afore the wheel,  and I hope I may be shot if the paddle did'nt strike the  bow of the boat with that force, it knocked up the starn  like a plank tilt, when one of the boys playing on it is  heavier than t'other; and chucked him right atop of the  wheel house--you never see'd a feller in such a dunderment  in your life. He had picked up a little English from  seein our folks there so much, and when he got up, the  first thing he said was,' Damn all sheenery, I say,  where's my boat?' and he looked round as if he thought  it had jumped on board too. Your boat, said the Captain,  why I expect it's gone to the bottom, and your men have  gone down to look arter it, for we never see'd or heerd  tell of one or t'other of them arter the boat was struck.  Yes, I'd make 'em stare like that are Spanish officer,  as if they had see'd out of their eyes for the first  time. Governor Campbell did'nt expect to see such a  country as this, when he came here, I reckon; I know he  did'nt. When I was a little boy, about knee high or so,  and lived down Connecticut river, mother used to say,  Sam, if you don't give over acting so like old Scratch,  I'll send you off to Nova-Scotia as sure as you are born;  I will, I vow. Well, Lord, how that are used to frighten  me; it made my hair stand right up an eend, like a cat's  back when she is wrathy; it made me drop it as quick as  wink--like a tin night cap put on a dipt candle agoin to  bed, it put the fun right out. Neighbour Dearborn's darter  married a gentleman to Yarmouth, that speculates in the  smugglin line; well, when she went on board to sail down  to Nova-Scotia, all her folks took on as if it was a  funeral; they said she was goin to be buried alive like  the nuns in Portengale that get a frolickin, break out  of the pastur, and race off, and get catched and brought  back agin. Says the old Colonel, her father. Deliverance,  my dear, I would sooner foller you to your grave, for  that would be an eend to your troubles, than to see you  go off to that dismal country, that's nothin but an  iceberg aground; and he howled as loud as an Irishman  that tries to wake his wife when she is dead. Awful  accounts we have of the country, that's a fact; but if  the Province is not so bad as they make it out, the folks  are a thousand times worse. You've seen a flock of  partridges of a frosty mornin in the fall, a crowdin out  of the shade to a sunny spot, and huddlin up there in  the warmth--well, the Blue Noses have nothin else to do  half the time but sun themselves. Whose fault is that?  Why it's the fault of the legislature; they don't encourage  internal improvement, nor the investment of capital in  the country: and the result is apathy, inaction and  poverty. They spend three months in Halifax, and what do  they do? Father gave me a dollar once, to go to the fair  at Hartford, and when I came back, says he, Sam, what  have you got to show for it? Now I ax what have they to  show for their three months' setting? They mislead folks;  they make 'em believe all the use of the Assembly is to  bark at Councillors, Judges, Bankers, and such cattle,  to keep 'em from eatin up the crops; and it actilly costs  more to feed them when they are watchin, than all the  others could eat if they did break a fence and get in.  Indeed some folks say they are the most breachy of the  two, and ought to go to pound themselves. If their fences  are good them hungry cattle could'nt break through; and  if they aint, they ought to stake 'em up, and with them  well; but it's no use to make fences unless the land is  cultivated. If I see a farm all gone to wrack, I say  here's bad husbandry and bad management; and if I see a  Province like this, of great capacity, and great natural  resources, poverty-stricken, I say there's bad legislation.  No, said he, (with an air of more seriousness than I had  yet observed,) How much it is to be regretted, that,  laying aside personal attacks and petty jealousies, they  would not unite as one man, and with one mind and one  heart apply themselves sedulously to the internal  improvement and developement of this beautiful Province.  Its value is utterly unknown, either to the general or  local Government, and the only persons who duly appreciate  it, are the Yankees.          No. XVII    A Yankee Handle for a Halifax Blade.    I met a man this mornin, said the Clock Maker, from  Halifax, a real conceited lookin critter as you een a  most ever seed, all shines and didos. He looked as if he  had picked up his airs, arter some officer of the regilars  had worn 'em out and cast 'em off. They sot on him like  second hand clothes, as if they had'nt been made for him  and did'nt exactly fit. He looked fine, but awkward, like  a captain of militia, when he gets his uniform on, to  play sodger; a thinkin himself mighty handSUM, and that  all the world is a lookin at him. He marched up and down  afore the street door like a peacock, as large as life  and twice as natural; he had a riding whip in his hand  and every now and then struck it agin his thigh, as much  as to say, aint that a splendid leg for a boot, now? Wont  I astonish the Amherst folks, that's all? thinks I you  are a pretty blade, aint you? I'd like to fit a Yankee  handle on to you, that's a fact. When I came up, he held  up his head near about as high as a Shot factory, and  stood with his fists on his hips, and eyed me from head  to foot, as a shakin quaker does a town lady: as much as  to say what a queer critter you be, that's toggery I  never seed afore, you're some carnal minded maiden, that's  sartain. Well, says he to me, with the air of a man that  chucks a cent into a beggar's hat, \"a fine day this,  Sir;\" do you actilly think so, said I? and I gave it the  real Connecticut drawl. Why, said he, quite short, if I  did'nt think so, I would'nt say so. Well, says I, I  don't know, but if I did think so, I guess I would'nt  say so; why not? says he--because, I expect, says I, any  fool could see that as well as me; and then I stared at  him, as much as to say, now if you like that are swap,  I am ready to trade with you agin as soon as you like.  Well he turned right round on his heel and walked off,  a whistlin Yankee Doodle to himself. He looked jist like  a man that finds whistlin a plaguy sight easier than  thinkin. Presently, I heard him ax the groom who that  are Yankee lookin feller was. That, said the groom, why,  I guess its Mr. Slick. Sho!! said he, how you talk.  What, Slick the Clockmaker, why it ant possible; I wish  I had a known that are afore, I declare, for I have a  great curiosity to see HIM, folks say he is an amazin  clever feller that, and he turned and stared, as if it  was old Hickory himself. Then he walked round and about  like a pig, round the fence of a potatoe field, a watchin  for a chance to cut in; so, thinks I, I'll jist give him  something to talk about, when he gets back to the city,  I'll fix a Yankee handle on to him in no time. How's  times to Halifax, Sir, said I--better, says he, much  better, business is done on a surer bottom than it was,  and things look bright agin; so does a candle, says I,  jist afore it goes out; it burns up ever so high and then  sinks right down, and leaves nothin behind but grease,  and an everlastin bad smell. I guess they don't know how  to feed their lamp, and it can't burn long on nothin.  No, Sir, the jig is up with Halifax, and it's all their  own fault. If a man sits at his door, and sees stray  cattle in his field, a eatin up of his crop, and his  neighbours, a cartin off his grain, and won't so much as  go and drive 'em out, why I should say it sarves him  right. I don't exactly understand, Sir, said he--thinks  I, it would be strange if you did, for I never see one  of your folks yet that could understand a hawk from a  handsaw. Well, says I, I will tell you what I mean--draw  a line from Cape Sable to Cape Cansoo, right thro' the  Province, and it will split it into two, this way, and  I cut an apple into two halves; now, says I, the worst  half, like the rotten half of the apple, belongs to  Halifax, and the other and sound half belongs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827"],[0,"The Problems of Philosophy (#17)"],[1,"with the universals concerned and can perceive the relation between them  which the statement asserts. It must be taken as a fact, discovered  by reflecting upon our knowledge, that we have the power of sometimes  perceiving such relations between universals, and therefore of sometimes  knowing general _a priori_ propositions such as those of arithmetic and  logic. The thing that seemed mysterious, when we formerly considered  such knowledge, was that it seemed to anticipate and control experience.  This, however, we can now see to have been an error. _No_ fact  concerning anything capable of being experienced can be known  independently of experience. We know _a priori_ that two things and two  other things together make four things, but we do _not_ know _a priori_  that if Brown and Jones are two, and Robinson and Smith are two, then  Brown and Jones and Robinson and Smith are four. The reason is that this  proposition cannot be understood at all unless we know that there are  such people as Brown and Jones and Robinson and Smith, and this we can  only know by experience. Hence, although our general proposition is _a  priori_, all its applications to actual particulars involve experience  and therefore contain an empirical element. In this way what seemed  mysterious in our _a priori_ knowledge is seen to have been based upon  an error.    It will serve to make the point clearer if we contrast our genuine _a  priori_ judgement with an empirical generalization, such as 'all men are  mortals'. Here as before, we can _understand_ what the proposition  means as soon as we understand the universals involved, namely _man_ and  _mortal_. It is obviously unnecessary to have an individual acquaintance  with the whole human race in order to understand what our proposition  means. Thus the difference between an _a priori_ general proposition  and an empirical generalization does not come in the _meaning_ of the  proposition; it comes in the nature of the _evidence_ for it. In the  empirical case, the evidence consists in the particular instances.  We believe that all men are mortal because we know that there are  innumerable instances of men dying, and no instances of their living  beyond a certain age. We do not believe it because we see a connexion  between the universal _man_ and the universal _mortal_. It is true that  if physiology can prove, assuming the general laws that govern living  bodies, that no living organism can last for ever, that gives a  connexion between _man_ and _mortality_ which would enable us to assert  our proposition without appealing to the special evidence of _men_  dying. But that only means that our generalization has been subsumed  under a wider generalization, for which the evidence is still of the  same kind, though more extensive. The progress of science is constantly  producing such subsumptions, and therefore giving a constantly wider  inductive basis for scientific generalizations. But although this gives  a greater _degree_ of certainty, it does not give a different _kind_:  the ultimate ground remains inductive, i.e. derived from instances, and  not an _a priori_ connexion of universals such as we have in logic and  arithmetic.    Two opposite points are to be observed concerning _a priori_ general  propositions. The first is that, if many particular instances are known,  our general proposition may be arrived at in the first instance by  induction, and the connexion of universals may be only subsequently  perceived. For example, it is known that if we draw perpendiculars  to the sides of a triangle from the opposite angles, all three  perpendiculars meet in a point. It would be quite possible to be first  led to this proposition by actually drawing perpendiculars in many  cases, and finding that they always met in a point; this experience  might lead us to look for the general proof and find it. Such cases are  common in the experience of every mathematician.    The other point is more interesting, and of more philosophical  importance. It is, that we may sometimes know a general proposition in  cases where we do not know a single instance of it. Take such a case as  the following: We know that any two numbers can be multiplied together,  and will give a third called their _product_. We know that all pairs  of integers the product of which is less than 100 have been actually  multiplied together, and the value of the product recorded in the  multiplication table. But we also know that the number of integers is  infinite, and that only a finite number of pairs of integers ever have  been or ever will be thought of by human beings. Hence it follows that  there are pairs of integers which never have been and never will be  thought of by human beings, and that all of them deal with integers the  product of which is over 100. Hence we arrive at the proposition:  'All products of two integers, which never have been and never will  be thought of by any human being, are over 100.' Here is a general  proposition of which the truth is undeniable, and yet, from the very  nature of the case, we can never give an instance; because any two  numbers we may think of are excluded by the terms of the proposition.    This possibility, of knowledge of general propositions of which no  instance can be given, is often denied, because it is not perceived  that the knowledge of such propositions only requires a knowledge of the  relations of universals, and does not require any knowledge of instances  of the universals in question. Yet the knowledge of such general  propositions is quite vital to a great deal of what is generally  admitted to be known. For example, we saw, in our early chapters,  that knowledge of physical objects, as opposed to sense-data, is only  obtained by an inference, and that they are not things with which we are  acquainted. Hence we can never know any proposition of the form 'this  is a physical object', where 'this' is something immediately known. It  follows that all our knowledge concerning physical objects is such that  no actual instance can be given. We can give instances of the associated  sense-data, but we cannot give instances of the actual physical objects.  Hence our knowledge as to physical objects depends throughout upon this  possibility of general knowledge where no instance can be given. And the  same applies to our knowledge of other people's minds, or of any other  class of things of which no instance is known to us by acquaintance.    We may now take a survey of the sources of our knowledge, as they have  appeared in the course of our analysis. We have first to distinguish  knowledge of things and knowledge of truths. In each there are two  kinds, one immediate and one derivative. Our immediate knowledge of  things, which we called _acquaintance_, consists of two sorts, according  as the things known are particulars or universals. Among particulars, we  have acquaintance with sense-data and (probably) with ourselves. Among  universals, there seems to be no principle by which we can decide which  can be known by acquaintance, but it is clear that among those that  can be so known are sensible qualities, relations of space and time,  similarity, and certain abstract logical universals. Our derivative  knowledge of things, which we call knowledge by _description_, always  involves both acquaintance with something and knowledge of truths. Our  immediate knowledge of _truths_ may be called _intuitive_ knowledge,  and the truths so known may be called _self-evident_ truths. Among such  truths are included those which merely state what is given in sense, and  also certain abstract logical and arithmetical principles, and (though  with less certainty) some ethical propositions. Our _derivative_  knowledge of truths consists of everything that we can deduce from  self-evident truths by the use of self-evident principles of deduction.    If the above account is correct, all our knowledge of truths depends  upon our intuitive knowledge. It therefore becomes important to consider  the nature and scope of intuitive knowledge, in much the same way as,  at an earlier stage, we considered the nature and scope of knowledge by  acquaintance. But knowledge of truths raises a further problem, which  does not arise in regard to knowledge of things, namely the problem of  _error_. Some of our beliefs turn out to be erroneous, and therefore  it becomes necessary to consider how, if at all, we can distinguish  knowledge from error. This problem does not arise with regard  to knowledge by acquaintance, for, whatever may be the object of  acquaintance, even in dreams and hallucinations, there is no error  involved so long as we do not go beyond the immediate object: error can  only arise when we regard the immediate object, i.e. the sense-datum,  as the mark of some physical object. Thus the problems connected  with knowledge of truths are more difficult than those connected  with knowledge of things. As the first of the problems connected  with knowledge of truths, let us examine the nature and scope of our  intuitive judgements.        CHAPTER XI. ON INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE    There is a common impression that everything that we believe ought to be  capable of proof, or at least of being shown to be highly probable. It  is felt by many that a belief for which no reason can be given is an  unreasonable belief. In the main, this view is just. Almost all our  common beliefs are either inferred, or capable of being inferred, from  other beliefs which may be regarded as giving the reason for them. As a  rule, the reason has been forgotten, or has even never been consciously  present to our minds. Few of us ever ask ourselves, for example, what  reason there is to suppose the food we are just going to eat will not  turn out to be poison. Yet we feel, when challenged, that a perfectly  good reason could be found, even if we are not ready with it at the  moment. And in this belief we"]]]
