So saying, he cast him off again; and calling the long comrade aside  after taking a few hasty turns by himself, bade him immediately write  and post against the wall, a notice, proscribing one Joseph Willet  (commonly known as Joe) of Chigwell; forbidding all 'Prentice Knights  to succour, comfort, or hold communion with him; and requiring them,  on pain of excommunication, to molest, hurt, wrong, annoy, and pick  quarrels with the said Joseph, whensoever and wheresoever they, or any  of them, should happen to encounter him.    Having relieved his mind by this energetic proceeding, he condescended  to approach the festive board, and warming by degrees, at length deigned  to preside, and even to enchant the company with a song. After this,  he rose to such a pitch as to consent to regale the society with a  hornpipe, which he actually performed to the music of a fiddle (played  by an ingenious member) with such surpassing agility and brilliancy of  execution, that the spectators could not be sufficiently enthusiastic in  their admiration; and their host protested, with tears in his eyes, that  he had never truly felt his blindness until that moment.    But the host withdrawing--probably to weep in secret--soon returned with  the information that it wanted little more than an hour of day, and that  all the cocks in Barbican had already begun to crow, as if their lives  depended on it. At this intelligence, the 'Prentice Knights arose in  haste, and marshalling into a line, filed off one by one and dispersed  with all speed to their several homes, leaving their leader to pass the  grating last.    'Good night, noble captain,' whispered the blind man as he held it open  for his passage out; 'Farewell, brave general. Bye, bye, illustrious  commander. Good luck go with you for a--conceited, bragging,  empty-headed, duck-legged idiot.'    With which parting words, coolly added as he listened to his receding  footsteps and locked the grate upon himself, he descended the steps,  and lighting the fire below the little copper, prepared, without  any assistance, for his daily occupation; which was to retail at the  area-head above pennyworths of broth and soup, and savoury puddings,  compounded of such scraps as were to be bought in the heap for the least  money at Fleet Market in the evening time; and for the sale of which  he had need to have depended chiefly on his private connection, for the  court had no thoroughfare, and was not that kind of place in which  many people were likely to take the air, or to frequent as an agreeable  promenade.        Chapter 9      Chronicler's are privileged to enter where they list, to come and go  through keyholes, to ride upon the wind, to overcome, in their soarings  up and down, all obstacles of distance, time, and place. Thrice blessed  be this last consideration, since it enables us to follow the disdainful  Miggs even into the sanctity of her chamber, and to hold her in sweet  companionship through the dreary watches of the night!    Miss Miggs, having undone her mistress, as she phrased it (which means,  assisted to undress her), and having seen her comfortably to bed in  the back room on the first floor, withdrew to her own apartment, in  the attic story. Notwithstanding her declaration in the locksmith's  presence, she was in no mood for sleep; so, putting her light upon the  table and withdrawing the little window curtain, she gazed out pensively  at the wild night sky.    Perhaps she wondered what star was destined for her habitation when  she had run her little course below; perhaps speculated which of those  glimmering spheres might be the natal orb of Mr Tappertit; perhaps  marvelled how they could gaze down on that perfidious creature, man, and  not sicken and turn green as chemists' lamps; perhaps thought of nothing  in particular. Whatever she thought about, there she sat, until her  attention, alive to anything connected with the insinuating 'prentice,  was attracted by a noise in the next room to her own--his room; the room  in which he slept, and dreamed--it might be, sometimes dreamed of her.    That he was not dreaming now, unless he was taking a walk in his sleep,  was clear, for every now and then there came a shuffling noise, as  though he were engaged in polishing the whitewashed wall; then a gentle  creaking of his door; then the faintest indication of his stealthy  footsteps on the landing-place outside. Noting this latter circumstance,  Miss Miggs turned pale and shuddered, as mistrusting his intentions; and  more than once exclaimed, below her breath, 'Oh! what a Providence it  is, as I am bolted in!'--which, owing doubtless to her alarm, was a  confusion of ideas on her part between a bolt and its use; for though  there was one on the door, it was not fastened.    Miss Miggs's sense of hearing, however, having as sharp an edge as her  temper, and being of the same snappish and suspicious kind, very soon  informed her that the footsteps passed her door, and appeared to have  some object quite separate and disconnected from herself. At this  discovery she became more alarmed than ever, and was about to give  utterance to those cries of 'Thieves!' and 'Murder!' which she had  hitherto restrained, when it occurred to her to look softly out, and see  that her fears had some good palpable foundation.    Looking out accordingly, and stretching her neck over the handrail,  she descried, to her great amazement, Mr Tappertit completely dressed,  stealing downstairs, one step at a time, with his shoes in one hand  and a lamp in the other. Following him with her eyes, and going down a  little way herself to get the better of an intervening angle, she beheld  him thrust his head in at the parlour-door, draw it back again with  great swiftness, and immediately begin a retreat upstairs with all  possible expedition.    'Here's mysteries!' said the damsel, when she was safe in her own room  again, quite out of breath. 'Oh, gracious, here's mysteries!'    The prospect of finding anybody out in anything, would have kept Miss  Miggs awake under the influence of henbane. Presently, she heard the  step again, as she would have done if it had been that of a feather  endowed with motion and walking down on tiptoe. Then gliding out as  before, she again beheld the retreating figure of the 'prentice; again  he looked cautiously in at the parlour-door, but this time instead of  retreating, he passed in and disappeared.    Miggs was back in her room, and had her head out of the window, before  an elderly gentleman could have winked and recovered from it. Out he  came at the street-door, shut it carefully behind him, tried it with  his knee, and swaggered off, putting something in his pocket as he  went along. At this spectacle Miggs cried 'Gracious!' again, and then  'Goodness gracious!' and then 'Goodness gracious me!' and then, candle  in hand, went downstairs as he had done. Coming to the workshop, she saw  the lamp burning on the forge, and everything as Sim had left it.    'Why I wish I may only have a walking funeral, and never be buried  decent with a mourning-coach and feathers, if the boy hasn't been and  made a key for his own self!' cried Miggs. 'Oh the little villain!'    This conclusion was not arrived at without consideration, and much  peeping and peering about; nor was it unassisted by the recollection  that she had on several occasions come upon the 'prentice suddenly,  and found him busy at some mysterious occupation. Lest the fact of Miss  Miggs calling him, on whom she stooped to cast a favourable eye, a  boy, should create surprise in any breast, it may be observed that she  invariably affected to regard all male bipeds under thirty as mere chits  and infants; which phenomenon is not unusual in ladies of Miss Miggs's  temper, and is indeed generally found to be the associate of such  indomitable and savage virtue.    Miss Miggs deliberated within herself for some little time, looking hard  at the shop-door while she did so, as though her eyes and thoughts were  both upon it; and then, taking a sheet of paper from a drawer, twisted  it into a long thin spiral tube. Having filled this instrument with a  quantity of small coal-dust from the forge, she approached the door,  and dropping on one knee before it, dexterously blew into the keyhole as  much of these fine ashes as the lock would hold. When she had filled it  to the brim in a very workmanlike and skilful manner, she crept upstairs  again, and chuckled as she went.    'There!' cried Miggs, rubbing her hands, 'now let's see whether you  won't be glad to take some notice of me, mister. He, he, he! You'll have  eyes for somebody besides Miss Dolly now, I think. A fat-faced puss she  is, as ever I come across!'    As she uttered this criticism, she glanced approvingly at her small  mirror, as who should say, I thank my stars that can't be said of  me!--as it certainly could not; for Miss Miggs's style of beauty was of  that kind which Mr Tappertit himself had not inaptly termed, in private,  'scraggy.'    'I don't go to bed this night!' said Miggs, wrapping herself in a shawl,  and drawing a couple of chairs near the window, flouncing down upon  one, and putting her feet upon the other, 'till you come home, my lad. I  wouldn't,' said Miggs viciously, 'no, not for five-and-forty pound!'    With that, and with an expression of face in which a great number of  opposite ingredients, such as mischief, cunning, malice, triumph,  and patient expectation, were all mixed up together in a kind of  physiognomical punch, Miss Miggs composed herself to wait and listen,  like some fair ogress who had set a trap and was watching for a nibble  from a plump young traveller.    She sat there, with perfect composure, all night. At length, just upon  break of day, there was a footstep in the street, and presently she  could hear Mr Tappertit stop at the door. Then she could make out that  he tried "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9172"],[0,"A Study of Association in Insanity (#17)"],[1,"........15  Butter--lard..........  Doctor--sick..........

Cases presenting no considerable dementia or confusion and cases in a  state of remission are apt to give normal test records. As we proceed  from the records of such cases to those of cases showing mental  deterioration we observe a gradual reduction in the values of  reactions, contraction of the mental horizon,[1] and the appearance of  the phenomenon of perseveration. We submit the following test records  for illustration:    [Footnote 1: What we mean by contraction of the mental horizon has  already been described in connection with epilepsy, page 47.]    CASE No. 4047.--C.A.F.
