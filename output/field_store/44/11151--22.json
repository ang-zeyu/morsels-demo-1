At that  time he had little mind for details; the whole effect was a huge  astonishment. Oddly enough, while the flight from the Council prison,  the great crowd in the hall, and the attack of the red police upon the  swarming people were clearly present in his mind, it cost him an effort  to piece in his awakening and to revive the meditative interval of the  Silent Rooms. At first his memory leapt these things and took him back  to the cascade at Pentargen quivering in the wind, and all the sombre  splendours of the sunlit Cornish coast. The contrast touched everything  with unreality. And then the gap filled, and he began to comprehend his  position.    It was no longer absolutely a riddle, as it had been in the Silent  Rooms. At least he had the strange, bare outline now. He was in some way  the owner of half the world, and great political parties were fighting  to possess him. On the one hand was the White Council, with its red  police, set resolutely, it seemed, on the usurpation of his property and  perhaps his murder; on the other, the revolution that had liberated him,  with this unseen \"Ostrog\" as its leader. And the whole of this gigantic  city was convulsed by their struggle. Frantic development of his  world! \"I do not understand,\" he cried. \"I do not understand!\"    He had slipped out between the contending parties into this liberty of  the twilight. What would happen next? What was happening? He figured  the redclad men as busily hunting him, driving the blackbadged  revolutionists before them.    At any rate chance had given him a breathing space. He could lurk  unchallenged by the passers-by, and watch the course of things. His eye  followed up the intricate dim immensity of the twilight buildings, and  it came to him as a thing infinitely wonderful, that above there the  sun was rising, and the world was lit and glowing with the old familiar  light of day. In a little while he had recovered his breath. His  clothing had already dried upon him from the snow.    He wandered for miles along these twilight ways, speaking to no one,  accosted by no one--a dark figure among dark figures--the coveted man  out of the past, the inestimable unintentional owner of half the world.  Wherever there were lights or dense crowds, or exceptional excitement  he was afraid of recognition, and watched and turned back or went up and  down by the middle stairways, into some transverse system of ways at a  lower or higher level. And though he came on no more fighting, the  whole city stirred with battle. Once he had to run to avoid a marching  multitude of men that swept the street. Everyone abroad seemed involved.  For the most part they were men, and they carried what he judged were  weapons. It seemed as though the struggle was concentrated mainly in  the quarter of the city from which he came. Ever and again a distant  roaring, the remote suggestion of that conflict, reached his ears.  Then his caution and his curiosity struggled together. But his caution  prevailed, and he continued wandering away from the fighting--so far as  he could judge. He went unmolested, unsuspected through the dark. After  a time he ceased to hear even a remote echo of the battle, fewer and  fewer people passed him, until at last the Titanic streets became  deserted. The frontages of the buildings grew plain and harsh; he seemed  to have come to a district of vacant warehouses. Solitude crept upon  him--his pace slackened.    He became aware of a growing fatigue. At times he would turn aside  and seat himself on one of the numerous seats of the upper ways. But  a feverish restlessness, the knowledge of his vital implication in his  struggle, would not let him rest in any place for long. Was the struggle  on his behalf alone?    And then in a desolate place came the shock of an earthquake--a roaring  and thundering--a mighty wind of cold air pouring through the city,  the smash of glass, the slip and thud of falling masonry--a series of  gigantic concussions. A mass of glass and ironwork fell from the remote  roofs into the middle gallery, not a hundred yards away from him, and  in the distance were shouts and running. He, too, was startled to an  aimless activity, and ran first one way and then as aimlessly back.    A man came running towards him. His self-control returned. \"What have  they blown up?\" asked the man breathlessly. \"That was an explosion,\" and  before Graham could speak he had hurried on.    The great buildings rose dimly, veiled by a perplexing twilight, albeit  the rivulet of sky above was now bright with day. He noted many strange  features, understanding none at the time; he even spelt out many of the  inscriptions in Phonetic lettering. But what profits it to decipher a  confusion of odd-looking letters resolving itself, after painful strain  of eye and mind, into \"Here is Eadhamite,\" or, \"Labour Bureau--Little  Side?\" Grotesque thought, that in all probability some or all of these  cliff-like houses were his!    The perversity of his experience came to him vividly. In actual fact he  had made such a leap in time as romancers have imagined again and again.  And that fact realised, he had been prepared, his mind had, as it were,  seated itself for a spectacle. And no spectacle, but a great vague  danger, unsympathetic shadows and veils of darkness. Somewhere through  the labyrinthine obscurity his death sought him. Would he, after all, be  killed before he saw? It might be that even at the next shadowy corner  his destruction ambushed. A great desire to see, a great longing to  know, arose in him.    He became fearful of corners. It seemed to him that there was safety  in concealment. Where could he hide to be inconspicuous when the lights  returned? At last he sat down upon a seat in a recess on one of the  higher ways, conceiving he was alone there.    He squeezed his knuckles into his weary eyes. Suppose when he looked  again he found the dark through of parallel ways and that intolerable  altitude of edifice, gone? Suppose he were to discover the whole story  of these last few days, the awakening, the shouting multitudes, the  darkness and the fighting, a phantasmagoria, a new and more vivid sort  of dream. It must be a dream; it was so inconsecutive, so reasonless.  Why were the people fighting for him? Why should this saner world regard  him as Owner and Master?    So he thought, sitting blinded, and then he looked again, half hoping  in spite of his ears to see some familiar aspect of the life of the  nineteenth century, to see, perhaps, the little harbour of Boscastle  about him, the cliffs of Pentargen, or the bedroom of his home. But fact  takes no heed of human hopes. A squad of men with a black banner tramped  athwart the nearer shadows, intent on conflict, and beyond rose that  giddy wall of frontage, vast and dark, with the dim incomprehensible  lettering showing faintly on its face.    \"It is no dream,\" he said, \"no dream.\" And he bowed his face upon his  hands.        CHAPTER XI. THE OLD MAN WHO KNEW EVERYTHING    He was startled by a cough close at hand.    He turned sharply, and peering, saw a small, hunched-up figure sitting a  couple of yards off in the shadow of the enclosure.    \"Have ye any news?\" asked the high-pitched wheezy voice of a very old  man.    Graham hesitated. \"None,\" he said.    \"I stay here till the lights come again,\" said the old man. \"These blue  scoundrels are everywhere--everywhere.\"    Graham's answer was inarticulate assent. He tried to see the old man but  the darkness hid his face. He wanted very much to respond, to talk, but  he did not know how to begin.    \"Dark and damnable,\" said the old man suddenly. \"Dark and damnable.  Turned out of my room among all these dangers.\"    \"That's hard,\" ventured Graham. \"That's hard on you.\"    \"Darkness. An old man lost in the darkness. And all the world gone mad.  War and fighting. The police beaten and rogues abroad. Why don't they  bring some negroes to protect us?... No more dark passages for me. I  fell over a dead man.\"    \"You're safer with company,\" said the old man, \"if it's company of  the right sort,\" and peered frankly. He rose suddenly and came towards  Graham.    Apparently the scrutiny was satisfactory. The old man sat down as if  relieved to be no longer alone. \"Eh!\" he said, \"but this is a terrible  time! War and fighting, and the dead lying there--men, strong men, dying  in the dark. Sons! I have three sons. God knows where they are tonight.\"    The voice ceased. Then repeated quavering: \"God knows where they are  tonight.\"    Graham stood revolving a question that should not betray his ignorance.  Again the old man's voice ended the pause.    \"This Ostrog will win,\" he said. \"He will win. And what the world will  be like under him no one can tell. My sons are under the wind-vanes,  all three. One of my daughters-in-law was his mistress for a while.  His mistress! We're not common people. Though they've sent me to wander  tonight and take my chance.... I knew what was going on. Before most  people. But this darkness! And to fall over a dead body suddenly in the  dark!\"    His wheezy breathing could be heard.    \"Ostrog!\" said Graham.    \"The greatest Boss the world has ever seen,\" said the voice.    Graham ransacked his mind. \"The Council has few friends among the  people,\" he hazarded.    \"Few friends. And poor ones at that. They've had their time. Eh! They  should have kept to the clever ones. But twice they held election. And  Ostrog. And now it has burst out and nothing can stay it, nothing can  stay it. Twice they rejected Ostrog--Ostrog the Boss. I heard of his  rages at the time--he was terrible. Heaven save them! For nothing on  earth can now, he has raised the Labour Companies upon them. No one else  would have dared. All the blue canvas armed and marching! He will go  through with it. He will go through.\"    He was silent for a little while. \"This Sleeper,\" he said, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7777"],[0,"Narrative of the Voyages Round the World, Performed (#17)"],[1,"n, that Eaheinomauwe was not an  island, and that the land might stretch away to the south-east, from  between Cape Turnagain and Cape Palliser, there being a space of  between twelve and fifteen leagues which had not yet been seen. Though  Lieutenant Cook, from what he had observed the first time he  discovered the strait, and from many other concurrent circumstances,  had the strongest conviction that they were mistaken, he,  nevertheless, resolved to leave no possibility of doubt with respect  to an object of so much importance. For this purpose he gave such a  direction to the navigation of the ship, as would most effectually  tend to determine the matter. After a course of two days he called the  officers upon deck, and asked them, whether they were not now  satisfied that Eaheinomauwe was an island. To this question they  readily answered in the affirmative; and all doubts being removed, the  lieutenant proceeded to farther researches.    During Mr. Cook's long and minute examination of the coast of New  Zealand, he gave names to the bays, capes, promontories, islands, and  rivers, and other places which were seen or visited by him; excepting  in those cases where their original appellations were learned from the  natives. The names he fixed upon were either derived from certain  characteristic or adventitious circumstances, or were conferred in  honour of his friends and acquaintance, chiefly those of the naval  line. Such of the readers of the present work as desire to be  particularly informed concerning them, will naturally have recourse to  the indications of them in the several maps on which they are  described.    The ascertaining of New Zealand to be an island did not conclude  Lieutenant Cook's examination of the nature, situation, and extent of  the country. After this, he completed his circumnavigation, by ranging  from Cape Turnagain southward along the eastern coast of Poenammoo,  round Cape South, and back to the western entrance of the strait be  had passed, and which was very properly named Cook's Strait. This  range, which commenced on the 9th of February, I shall not minutely  and regularly pursue; but content myself, as in the former course,  with mentioning such circumstances as are more directly adapted to my  immediate design.    In the afternoon of the 14th, when Mr. Banks was out in the boat a  shooting, our voyagers saw, with their glasses, four double canoes put  off from the shore towards him, having on board fifty-seven men. The  lieutenant, being alarmed for the safety of his friend, immediately  ordered signals to be made for his return; but he was prevented from  seeing them by the situation of the gun with regard to the ship.  However, it was soon with pleasure observed, that his boat was in  motion; and he was taken on board before the Indians, who perhaps had  not discerned him, came up. Their attention seemed to be wholly fixed  upon the ship. They came within about a stone's cast of her, and then  stopped, gazing at the English with a look of vacant astonishment.  Tupia in vain exerted his eloquence to prevail upon them to make a  nearer approach. After surveying our navigators some time, they left  them, and made towards the shore. The gentlemen could not help  remarking, on this occasion, the different dispositions and behaviour  of the different inhabitants of the country, at the first sight of the  Endeavour. The people now seen kept aloof with a mixture of timidity  and wonder; others had immediately commenced hostilities; the man who  was found fishing alone in his canoe appeared to regard our voyagers  as totally unworthy of notice; and some had come on board almost  without invitation, and with an air of perfect confidence and good  will. From the conduct of the last visitors, Lieutenant Cook gave the  land from which they had put off, and which had the appearance of an  island, the name of Lookers-on.    When an island, which lies about five leagues from the coast of  Tovy-Poenammoo, and which was named Banks's Island, was first  discovered in the direction of south by west, some persons on board  were of opinion, that they saw land bearing south-south-east, and  south-east by east. Our commander, who was himself upon the deck at  the time, told them that in his judgment it was no more than a cloud,  which, as the sun rose, would dissipate and vanish. Being, however  determined to leave no subject for disputation which experiment could  remove, he ordered the ship to steer in the direction which the  supposed country was said to bear. Having gone in this direction eight  and twenty miles, without discovering any signs of land, the Endeavour  resumed her intended course to the southward, it being the particular  view of the lieutenant to ascertain whether Poenammoo was an island or  a continent.    In passing some rocks on the 9th of March, in the night, it appeared  in the morning that the ship had been in the most imminent danger. Her  escape was indeed critical in the highest degree. To these rocks,  therefore, which, from their situation, are so well adapted to catch  unwary strangers, Mr. Cook gave the name of the Traps. On the same day  he reached a point of land which he called the South Cape, and which  he supposed, as proved in fact to be the case, the southern extremity  of the country.    In sailing, on Wednesday the 14th, the Endeavour passed a small narrow  opening in the land, where there seemed to be a very safe and  convenient harbour, formed by an island which lay eastward in the  middle of the opening. On the land, behind the opening, are mountains,  the summits of which were covered with snow, that appeared to have  recently fallen. Indeed our voyagers for two days past, had found the  weather extremely cold. On each side the entrance of the opening, the  land rises almost perpendicularly from the sea to a stupendous height.  For this reason Lieutenant Cook did not choose to carry the ship into  the harbour. He was sensible that no wind could blow there but right  in or right out: and he did not think it by any means advisable to put  into a place whence he could not have gotten out, but with a wind,  which, experience had taught him did not blow more than one day in a  month. Sagacious as this determination of our commander was, it did  not give universal satisfaction. He acted in it contrary to the  opinion of some persons on board, who expressed in strong terms their  desire of coming to harbour; not sufficiently considering, that  present convenience ought not to be purchased at the expense of  incurring great future disadvantages.    By the 27th of March, Mr. Cook had circumnavigated the whole country  of Tovy-Poenammoo, and arrived within sight of the island formerly  mentioned, which lies at the distance of nine leagues from the  entrance of Queen Charlotte's Sound. Having at this time thirty tons  of empty water-casks on board, it was necessary to fill them before he  finally proceeded on his voyage. For this purpose he hauled round the  island, and entered a bay, situated between that and Queen Charlotte's  Sound, and to which the name was given of Admiralty Bay.    The business of wooding and watering having been completed on the  30th, and the ship being ready for the sea, the point now to be  determined was, what rout should be pursued in returning home, that  would be of most advantage to the public service. Upon this subject  the lieutenant thought proper to take the opinion of his officers. He  had himself a strong desire to return by Cape Horn, because that would  have enabled him to determine, whether there is or is not a southern  continent. But against this scheme it was a sufficient objection, that  our navigators must have kept in a high southern latitude, in the very  depth of winter, and in a vessel which was not thought to be in a  condition fit for the undertaking. The same reason was urged with  still greater force, against their proceeding directly for the Cape of  Good Hope, because no discovery of moment could be expected in that  rout. It was therefore resolved that they should return by the East  Indies; and that, with this view, they should steer westward, till  they should fall in with the east coast of New Holland, and then  follow the direction of that coast to the northward, till they should  arrive at its northern extremity. If that should be found  impracticable, it was further resolved, that they should endeavour to  fall in with the land, or islands, said to have been discovered by  Quiros.    In the six months which Lieutenant Cook had spent in the examination  of New Zealand, he made very large additions to the knowledge of  geography and navigation. That country was first discovered in the  year 1642, by Abel Jansen Tasman, a Dutch navigator. He traversed the  eastern coast from latitude 34 deg. 43', and entered the strait now called  Cook's Strait; but being attacked by the natives soon after he came to  an anchor, in the place which he named Murderer's Bay, he never went  on shore. Nevertheless, he assumed a kind of claim of the country, by  calling it Staaten Land, or the Land of the States, in honour of the  States General. It is now usually distinguished in maps and charts by  the name of New Zealand. The whole of the country, excepting that part  of the coast which was seen by Tasman from on board his ship,  continued from his time, to the voyage of the Endeavour, altogether  unknown. By many persons it has been supposed to constitute a part of  a southern continent; but it was now ascertained by Mr. Cook to  consist of two large islands, divided from each other by a strait or  passage, which is about four or five leagues broad. These islands are  situated between the latitudes of 34 deg. and 48 deg. south, and between the  longitudes of 181 deg. and 194 deg. west; a matter which Mr. Green determined  with uncommon exactness, from innumerable observations of the sun and  moon, and one of the"]]]
