But it is sometimes urged that man only resembles God in his moral  attributes. Morally, says the divine and doctor, man bears the image  of God. Aye, indeed! The absurdity of such a supposition is still  greater. By moral, I must then understand, that the resemblance  between God and man, consists in their being of like social, civil,  and religious temperament and affection. Other things being equal, a  holy man as Adam originally was, would cherish the same propensities  with God--have a similar sense of justice and truth according to the  measure of knowledge belonging to each. But the absurdity and query  are here: an immaterial, infinitely expanded God, without physical  form and locality, is as unlike to man as light to darkness, or as the  most diverse animals can be supposed to be, and cannot in the nature  of things have those sympathies and moral sensibilities that man has.  Material sensibilities must differ from those which are immaterial, as  much as the elements of land and water differ.    My sheet being full, allow me to subscribe myself    Your friend and servant,    ORSON SPENCER.        LETTER IX.    THE PRIESTHOOD.    _Liverpool, September_ 30, 1847.    Reverend and Dear Sir,--In close connexion with an account of the  character of God, I will proceed to give you a brief and succint  description of THE PRIESTHOOD. It is feared, however, that the present  subject will not be more congenial to your views than the foregoing.  Still it shall be treated according to the spirit of the scriptures of  the Old and New Testament, which you ardently profess to believe.    You will admit that God is the righteous Ruler over all the moral and  intelligent creatures of the universe. His government is both temporal  and spiritual. Not even a sparrow falls to the ground without His  notice. He clothes the lilies of the field; much more doth He watch  over all the varied interests of intelligent beings both in heaven and  upon earth.    I shall then define priesthood to be that order of authoritative  intelligences by which God regulates, controls, enlightens, blesses  or curses, saves or condemns all beings. To it, under God, all things  are subservient in righteousness, whether in heaven, earth, or hell.  God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is at the head of all genuine  priesthood. But as it is His will that all men should honour the Son,  even as they honour the Father, Jesus now stands accredited as the  Apostle and High Priest of our profession. Subordinate priests in the  same apostolic order of the Son of God, are such as he has put in his  church. These are called apostles, prophets, evangelists, teachers, &c.    Now, sir, by means of this order, extending from Jesus the High  Priest, to the lowest grade of priesthood in conjunction with the Holy  Ghost, God teaches and governs all things. Out of the line of this  order, there is no power whatever that is acknowledged and approved  of God. Magistrates, rulers, kings, potentates and principalities,  if not legitimately ordained and clothed with the authority of this  priestly order of the Son of God, are usurpers and not of God--for the  scriptures declare that there is no power that is not of God. Even the  angelic order is in the line of subordination to Jesus Christ, and in  the same chain of priesthood with apostles and prophets upon the earth.    The priesthood exhibits a regular gradation of knowledge and authority  from Jesus the great High Priest in heaven, to the lowest description  of ordination in the church below. Jesus said that \"all power was given  him in heaven and upon earth.\" But how did he propose to exercise all  that power which was given him both among the nations of the earth  and in heaven? My answer is, that he proposed to do it through a  delegation of power to the different orders of his priesthood. We are  told distinctly what the priesthood consists of, which is established  on the earth, viz., apostles, prophets, evangelists, &c. The heavenly  order, minister to the authorities of the earthly order. The ruling  object to be accomplished by the latter is, the work of the ministry,  the perfecting of the Saints, the edifying of the body of Christ.    The first object of this priestly order is to teach all nations to  become loyal and good citizens of the kingdom of God, observing all  the commandments of God. One universal commandment of God is, for all  men every where to repent and be baptized, and keep all other laws of  God, as they shall be dispensed from the great High Priest through  the delegated authorities. Now if all men do not obey these commands,  they are liable to be dealt with as transgressors, and punished as  evil doers. The command to obey is imperative upon _all_ men. Hence  whatever orders of civil government--or order of domestic compact--or  order of business transaction--or order of religious worship--or  rule of commercial transaction may contravene the established order  of priesthood, the same must bow to the requisition of the inspired  priesthood of God; and God acknowledges no other power with approbation.    Now, dear sir, it is this imperative attitude of authority and power,  which the Almighty boldly claims, and fearlessly attempts to exercise,  through a chosen priesthood over all mankind, Jews and Gentiles, that  greatly displeases the rebellious portion of our race. They cannot bear  that this \"man should reign over them.\" False notions of independence  and liberty rise against an order of delegated authorities claiming  inspiration and officiality from God. The rebellious profess that they  are ready to obey the Almighty God, but as for these men claiming  priesthood, we will not have _them_, to reign over us.    The abuses practised by an apostate and uncalled priesthood for the  last seventeen hundred years, has wrought an honest but wofully  misguided prejudice against the true priesthood; and a large portion  of mankind demand also, that God shall communicate with themselves  directly, without the intervention of agencies chosen from mere men  like themselves. And this captious spirit of dictation, as to the  manner in which God shall teach and govern them, has been fostered in  their minds by the erroneous notion that God is such a centreless,  boundless spirit of ubiquity, that he can teach and govern all worlds  without the aid of other agencies. We might as well suppose that he  can see without eyes, or hear without ears. But God's being like man,  though infinitely exalted above him, and unspeakably perfected in  every faculty and power, puts to shame these dark vagaries about the  inutility of delegated powers.    During the whole period of the world, God has ever and invariably  attempted to teach and govern mankind by means of an established  priesthood consisting of men; and this priesthood has been as  invariably resisted from the days of righteous Abel till now. By this  priesthood, it is the design of God to establish a Divine government  upon the earth, even as it is established in the heavens. All other  forms of government have proved a complete failure in every nation and  period, in which the experiment has been attempted.    But the most humiliating feature in the whole history of governments  is, that many have sought to ape the Divine government with an  uninspired priesthood. They have thereby made every species of  religious government a stink and confusion in all the earth. Their  uninspired systems have been like a fair woman without discretion,  or like jewels in a swine's snout. Sometimes they have united church  and state, and swayed a sceptre of oppression; at other times they  have been passive and non-resistant, even to the utter extinction of  thousands whose defenceless blood has crimsoned the earth. But the time  for experimenting upon false forms of government, civil or religious,  has nearly gone by never to return, \"save for a little season.\"    A priesthood chosen not of men, but chosen first of God, and inspired  with his wisdom, truth, and power, is now called and ordained to teach  all nations, and fill the earth with the knowledge of God. By means  of this order, and this order alone, the kingdoms of this world,  whether temporal or spiritual, pagan or christian, are all to be merged  in one universal kingdom. And this will be the best and greatest  kingdom ever known this side of heaven. Its constitution, laws, and  method of administration will be after the model of the heavenly  order. It will embrace politics, arts, war, merchandize, science, and  religion--- things temporal and things spiritual. And the energy and  wisdom of Omnipotence will, like the little leaven in meal, increase  and magnify in the priesthood, till the whole world is brought into  happy subordination to this plan of government. The nations of the  earth will then become one family and brotherhood. Kings and rulers,  of all grades, will then be chosen of God through the priesthood, of  which priesthood rulers will be a part and portion; and without being  ordained to the priesthood, no man ever can rule in this great kingdom.    Thus, dear sir, you perceive that I attach great importance to  the priesthood, and consider it the grand instrumentality of  revolutionizing, and saving, and governing the whole earth. But what  harm in all this? Do you think there is too much power invested in  this chosen order of men? Why, certainly not! They have not chosen  themselves; neither have they come to office by the votes of the  unthinking mass; nor by blind hereditary lineage, nor by violence  and the usurper's arts. They have been chosen of God, who knew their  spirits before the foundation of the world. They are a royal priesthood  and holy nation, for God will have no other in his priesthood.

There is an original lower  part of the wall, built of huge blocks of lias which we may describe as  rude, but less rude than the rudest work at Cori. The height to which  this earliest construction of all reaches differs in different parts,  but it has in most parts been patched and raised, not only by later  repairs of all manner of dates, but long before then by a construction  of very respectable antiquity, which would seem venerable if it were  not for the elder and more massive stones beneath it. The later work  has a general likeness to the walls of Anagnia both in construction  and material, and it is distinguished from the more primitive work  by the same mark. The pilers of the elder stones had no notion of the  arch; the builders of the later wall were perfectly familiar with it.  The only complete opening of the earlier work is a small postern with  merely inclined sides; but in one of the ancient gates, not far from  the modern gate by which the visitor is most likely to enter, stones  of the earlier date support an arch of the second date. This ancient  entrance is, as usual, warily placed; the giants, or whoever they  were, from the days of Tiryns onwards, knew perfectly well how to take  a military advantage of any enemy who might attack their strongholds.  Another gate, now known as _Porta Maggiore_, is a much more elaborate  work, with its inner and outer arch still remaining. Here the gate is  placed with great skill, advanced in front at a point where the wall  turns at an angle. The wall may be followed, and followed to great  advantage, through the more part of its circuit. One hardly knows  whether to count it gain or loss that the path becomes most difficult  just at the point where, through large later repairs, the wall becomes  least interesting. When we have to scramble--all at least save Alpine  climbers--with constant thoughts for the safety of our legs and feet,  we are less able to take in the differences in the various forms of  construction, or to consider the dates to which we may be inclined to  refer each. In the more instructive parts of the walls of Ferentino no  such necessity is laid upon us; they may be studied with perfect ease,  and the outlook from the various points of their circuit may be enjoyed  at the same time. And at one point, not far from the _Porta Maggiore_,  it will be well to go down the hill a little way to study the long  inscription cut in the rock in honour of a local worthy and magistrate,  Aulus Quinctilius by name, who seems to have played much the same part  at Ferentinum in pagan days which Sir William Harpur played ages later  at Bedford. He founded everything that, according to the notions of  his day, could be founded. Among other things he ordained that thirty  bushels of nuts should be yearly given to be scrambled for by the  boys of Ferentinum, without distinction of bond or free. Now is the  will of this pious founder carried out? Are there any Italian Charity  Commissioners to look into these matters, and to see that the boys get  their nuts? Or, if the scrambling for nuts be deemed a nuisance--yet  many well-remembered scraps of Latin plead on its behalf--will they  devise a scheme for the better employment of the funds? Or has the  benefaction of the benevolent Quinctilius, like some benefactions  nearer home, been lost altogether? Two or three years ago the _Times_  was filled with letters complaining how a charitable foundation in  Somerset had vanished altogether, and how the founder's monument, once  standing in the church, had been buried under a neighbouring barn. In  one point at least the benevolent Aulus of Ferentinum has been more  lucky. When Ferentinum had _quatuorviri_, they did not bury people in  their temples, still less did they set up monuments in their temples to  people who were not buried in them. So the monument which commemorates  the bounty of Aulus Quinctilius stands in the open air clear enough to  be seen, well fenced in withal, which the visitor may perhaps regret,  as a little time may be wasted in searching for the key. But do his  benefactions go on? We will not hint at their having been alienated  by Goths or Vandals, by East-Roman exarchs or Lombard princes. Can we  trust the really dangerous characters in these parts of the world,  Popes, Popes' nephews, Roman princes, and Roman cardinals, who pull  down buildings and steal their columns to make their own palaces and  villas? Perhaps some of them may have swallowed up the funds which  should go in nuts to the boys of Ferentinum.    We have been writing as we dreamed on the spot. As at Anagni, we  wish--we must confess the weakness--to see independent Hernicans  wherever we can. It gives us therefore a little shock when we come  back and turn to our books, and find the walls of Hernican Ferentinum  spoken of, without any special emotion, as \"Roman.\" We look up  again in a moment, and ask, What is Roman? At Ferentinum the word  certainly means something quite different from what it commonly  means in Britain and Northern Gaul. There we are happy if we light  on anything earlier than the third century A.D. Here no one asks us  to accept any date later than Sulla; some will allow us to go as far  back as the middle of the second century B.C. We are allowed to think  that the walls of Ferentinum were in being when old Carthage and old  Corinth were still standing. But we have not yet got to our great  piece of evidence. Ferentino contains inscriptions much older and more  important--though about the comparative importance some might raise a  doubt--than Aulus Quinctilius and his nuts. But we must get to them  by the proper road; we must get into what once was the _arx_, what  is now the ecclesiastical quarter. Now, at places like Ferentino,  ecclesiastical and domestic buildings seem like something kindly  thrown into the bargain. We go to look at walls, not at churches or  houses; so we get something more than we asked for when we find that  Ferentino contains many houses which are worth at least a glance,  and several churches which are worth much more than a glance. Indeed  at Ferentino the study of walls and that of churches cannot be kept  asunder. That some of the great stones have been taken to build the  small and now disused church of Saint Lawrence is a slight matter. The  most striking feature of Ferentino in any distant view consists of the  mass of buildings which is formed by piling the cathedral church, the  bell-tower, and the Bishop's palace, on the walls of the _arx_, as a  mighty sub-structure. The walls of the _arx_ show the same two dates  as the walls of the tower. In one part we have only the vast rude  stones of the first period; at another part they support the upper  range of the second. The first no one will refuse to our Hernicans, to  Hernicans older than Spurius Cassius; but how about the second, the  \"Roman\" date? This is claimed in several inscriptions as the work of  the censors Aulus Hirtius and Marcus Lollius--censors, that is, not  of Rome but of Ferentinum. The inscription may be seen in the first  volume of the great _Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum_, p. 238, and  its closer likeness is given at fol. lxvii., lxviii. of the _Priscae  Latinitatis Monumenta Epigraphica_. Now Aulus Hirtius and Marcus  Lollius are names of a frightfully modern sound, suggesting well-known  persons of the days of Divus Julius and Divus Augustus. But no one  asks us to think of them here, though we may likely enough have got  hold of the Hernican forefathers of those better-known Romans. They  had no such need to change their names and the alphabet in which they  are written, as when the son of the Etruscan Avle Felimne became the  Roman Publius Volumnius. Now our Hirtius and Lollius claim to have  built what they built from the foundation; but they must at the outside  only mean that they built the later work on the top of the primaeval  wall. And to a zealous eye even the work of Hirtius and Lollius has an  archaic look about it. There are no columns against the wall, as in  the _Tabularium_ of Catulus at Rome; the work is finished with a row  of triglyphs, not unlike those on the tomb of \"Cornelius Lucius Scipio  Gnaivod patre prognatus.\" But we need not go back quite so far as his  day. The further back we can go the better, but any time before Sulla  will do. The history of Ferentinum allows us to carry our Hernicans  of Ferentinum, like our Etruscans of Perusia, down to the Social War.  Ferentinum, it must be remembered, was one of those Hernican towns  which were true to Rome when Anagnia fought against her. What follows  is most instructive. The men of Ferentinum, steady allies of Rome,  refused the proffered reward of Roman citizenship, and chose rather  to remain a distinct, even if a dependent, community. That is to say,  the old Hernican city went on, as long doubtless as to the days of  the Social War, a self-ordering commonwealth, with its own laws and  magistrates--Aulus Hirtius and Marcus Lollius among them--subject  only to the demands of military service which were needed in the wars  of Rome, and sometimes perhaps to the unlawful excesses of powerful  Romans.    This last fact comes out in a strange story told by Aulus Gellius (x.  3). It is an extract from a speech of Gaius Gracchus, setting forth  the wrongs of the Italian allies. The wife of a Roman praetor suddenly  wished the public baths of Ferentinum to be cleared and made ready for  herself. The thing was not done so fast as the great lady wished; so  her husband bade the two quaestors of the town to be seized; one was  scourged, the other threw himself over the wall. This tale, told in the  words of Gracchus, proves a good deal as to the arbitrary way in which  Roman magistrates are not ashamed to deal with the dependent cities  even of Italy, whatever might be their formal relation to Rome.    It is of less importance that Gellius casually speaks of the"]]]
