The finest specimens of ancient paintings are found in catacombs, the  baths, and the ruins of Pompeii. On this subject Winckelmann is the  great authority.          ANCIENT SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE.      ASTRONOMY, GEOGRAPHY, ETC.    2000-100 B.C.      It would be absurd to claim for the ancients any great attainments in  science, such as they made in the field of letters or the realm of art.  It is in science, especially when applied to practical life, that the  moderns show their great superiority to the most enlightened nations of  antiquity. In this great department of human inquiry modern genius  shines with the lustre of the sun. It is this which most strikingly  attests the advance of civilization. It is this which has distinguished  and elevated the races of Europe, and carried them in the line of  progress beyond the attainments of the Greeks and Romans. With the  magnificent discoveries and inventions of the last three hundred years  in almost every department of science, especially in the explorations of  distant seas and continents, in the analysis of chemical compounds, in  the wonders of steam and electricity, in mechanical appliances to  abridge human labor, in astronomical researches, in the explanation of  the phenomena of the heavens, in the miracles which inventive genius has  wrought,--seen in our ships, our manufactories, our printing-presses,  our observatories, our fortifications, our laboratories, our mills, our  machines to cultivate the earth, to make our clothes, to build our  houses, to multiply our means of offence and defence, to make weak  children do the work of Titans, to measure our time with the accuracy of  the planetary orbits, to use the sun itself in perpetuating our  likenesses to distant generations, to cause a needle to guide the  mariner with assurance on the darkest night, to propel a heavy ship  against wind and tide without oars or sails, to make carriages ascend  mountains without horses at the rate of thirty miles an hour, to convey  intelligence with the speed of lightning from continent to continent and  under oceans that ancient navigators never dared to cross,--these and  other wonders attest an ingenuity and audacity of intellect which would  have overwhelmed with amazement the most adventurous of Greeks and the  most potent of Romans.    But the great discoveries and inventions to which we owe this marked  superiority are either accidental or the result of generations of  experiment, assisted by an immense array of ascertained facts from which  safe inductions can be made. It is not, probably, the superiority of  the European races over the Greeks and Romans to which we may ascribe  the wonderful advance of modern society, but the particular direction  which genius was made to take. Had the Greeks given the energy of their  minds to mechanical forces as they did to artistic creations, they might  have made wonderful inventions. But it was not so ordered by Providence.  At that time the world was not in the stage of development when this  particular direction of intellect could have been favored. The  development of the physical sciences, with their infinite multiplicity  and complexity, required more centuries of observation, collection and  collation of facts, deductions from known phenomena, than the ancients  had had to work with; while the more ethereal realms of philosophy,  ethics, aesthetics, and religion, though needing keen study of Nature  and of man, depended more upon inner spiritual forces, and less upon  accumulated detail of external knowledge. Yet as there were some  subjects which the Greeks and Romans seemed to exhaust, some fields of  labor and thought in which they never have been and perhaps never will  be surpassed, so some future age may direct its energies into channels  that are as unknown to us as clocks and steam-engines were to the  Greeks. This is the age of mechanism and of science; and mechanism and  science sweep everything before them, and will probably be carried to  their utmost capacity and development. After that the human mind may  seek some new department, some new scope for its energies, and an age of  new wonders may arise,--perhaps after the present dominant races shall  have become intoxicated with the greatness of their triumphs and have  shared the fate of the old monarchies of the East. But I would not  speculate on the destinies of the European nations, whether they are to  make indefinite advances until they occupy and rule the whole world, or  are destined to be succeeded by nations as yet undeveloped,--savages, as  their fathers were when Rome was in the fulness of material wealth  and grandeur.    I have shown that in the field of artistic excellence, in literary  composition, in the arts of government and legislation, and even in the  realm of philosophical speculation, the ancients were our  school-masters, and that among them were some men of most marvellous  genius, who have had no superiors among us. But we do not see among them  the exhibition of genius in what we call science, at least in its  application to practical life. It would be difficult to show any  department of science which the ancients carried to any considerable  degree of perfection. Nevertheless, there were departments in which they  made noble attempts, and in which they showed large capacity, even if  they were unsuccessful in great practical results.    Astronomy was one of these. In this science such men as Eratosthenes,  Aristarchus, Hipparchus, and Ptolemy were great lights of whom humanity  may be proud; and had they been assisted by our modern inventions, they  might have earned a fame scarcely eclipsed by that of Kepler and Newton.  The old astronomers did little to place this science on a true  foundation, but they showed great ingenuity, and discovered some truths  which no succeeding age has repudiated. They determined the  circumference of the earth by a method identical with that which would  be employed by modern astronomers; they ascertained the position of the  stars by right ascension and declination; they knew the obliquity of the  ecliptic, and determined the place of the sun's apogee as well as its  mean motion. Their calculations on the eccentricity of the moon prove  that they had a rectilinear trigonometry and tables of chords. They had  an approximate knowledge of parallax; they could calculate eclipses of  the moon, and use them for the correction of their lunar tables. They  understood spherical trigonometry, and determined the motions of the sun  and moon, involving an accurate definition of the year and a method of  predicting eclipses; they ascertained that the earth was a sphere, and  reduced the phenomena of the heavenly bodies to uniform movements of  circular orbits. We have settled by physical geography the exact form  of the earth, but the ancients arrived at their knowledge by  astronomical reasoning. Says Whewell:--    \"The reduction of the motions of the sun, moon, and five planets to  circular orbits, as was done by Hipparchus, implies deep concentrated  thought and scientific abstraction. The theories of eccentrics and  epicycles accomplished the end of explaining all the known phenomena.  The resolution of the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies into an  assemblage of circular motions was a great triumph of genius, and was  equivalent to the most recent and improved processes by which modern  astronomers deal with such motions.\"    Astronomy was probably born in Chaldaea as early as the time of Abraham.  The glories of the firmament were impressed upon the minds of the rude  primitive races with an intensity which we do not feel, with all the  triumphs of modern science. The Chaldaean shepherds, as they watched  their flocks by night, noted the movements of the planets, and gave  names to the more brilliant constellations. Before religious rituals  were established, before great superstitions arose, before poetry was  sung, before musical instruments were invented, before artists  sculptured marble or melted bronze, before coins were stamped, before "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10542"],[0,"The Boats of the \"Glen Carrig\" (#18)"],[1,"in the fire, and whilst this was doing he spread out upon the rock  one of the spare lengths of canvas; then he sung out to the man to bring  him one of the pieces of charred reed, and with this he wrote our  question upon the canvas, calling for fresh charcoal as he required it.  Then, having made an end of writing, he bade two of the men take hold of  the canvas by the ends and expose it to the view of those in the ship,  and in this manner we got them to understand our desires. For, presently,  some of them went away, and came back after a little, and held up for us  to see, a very great square of white, and upon it a great \"NO,\" and at  this were we again at our wits' ends to know how it would be possible to  rescue those within the ship; for, suddenly, our whole desire to leave  the island, was changed into a determination to rescue the people in the  hulk, and, indeed, had our intentions not been such we had been veritable  curs; though I am happy to tell that we had no thought at this juncture  but for those who were now looking to us to restore them once more to the  world to which they had been so long strangers.    Now, as I have said, we were again at our wits' ends to know how to come  at those within the hulk, and there we stood all of us, talking together,  perchance we should hit upon some plan, and anon we would turn and wave  to those who watched us so anxiously. Yet, a while passed, and we had  come no nearer to a method of rescue. Then a thought came to me (waked  perchance by the mention of shooting the rope over to the hulk by means  of a mortar) how that I had read once in a book, of a fair maid whose  lover effected her escape from a castle by a similar artifice, only that  in his case he made use of a bow in place of a mortar, and a cord instead  of a rope, his sweetheart hauling up the rope by means of the cord.    Now it seemed to me a possible thing to substitute a bow for the mortar,  if only we could find the material with which to make such a weapon, and  with this in view, I took up one of the lengths of the bamboo-like reed,  and tried the spring of it, which I found to be very good; for this  curious growth, of which I have spoken hitherto as a reed, had no  resemblance to that plant, beyond its appearance; it being  extraordinarily tough and woody, and having considerably more nature  than a bamboo. Now, having tried the spring of it, I went over to the  tent and cut a piece of sampsonline which I found among the gear, and  with this and the reed I contrived a rough bow. Then I looked about until  I came upon a very young and slender reed which had been cut with the  rest, and from this I fashioned some sort of an arrow, feathering it with  a piece of one of the broad, stiff leaves, which grew upon the plant, and  after that I went forth to the crowd about the leeward edge of the hill.  Now when they saw me thus armed, they seemed to think that I intended a  jest, and some of them laughed, conceiving that it was a very odd action  on my part; but when I explained that which was in my mind, they ceased  from laughter, and shook their heads, making that I did but waste time;  for, as they said, nothing save gunpowder could cover so great a  distance. And after that they turned again to the bo'sun with whom some  of them seemed to be in argument. And so for a little space I held my  peace, and listened; thus I discovered that certain of the men advocated  the taking of the boat--so soon as it was sufficiently repaired--and  making a passage through the weed to the ship, which they proposed to do  by cutting a narrow canal. But the bo'sun shook his head, and reminded  them of the great devil-fish and crabs, and the worse things which the  weed concealed, saying that those in the ship would have done it long  since had it been possible, and at that the men were silenced, being  robbed of their unreasoning ardor by his warnings.    Now just at this point there happened a thing which proved the wisdom of  that which the bo'sun contended; for, suddenly, one of the men cried out  to us to look, and at that we turned quickly, and saw that there was a  great commotion among those who were in the open place in the  superstructure; for they were running this way and that, and some were  pushing to the slide which filled the opening. And then, immediately, we  saw the reason for their agitation and haste; for there was a stir in the  weed near to the stem of the ship, and the next instant, monstrous  tentacles were reached up to the place where had been the opening; but  the door was shut, and those aboard the hulk in safety. At this  manifestation, the men about me who had proposed to make use of the boat,  and the others also, cried out their horror of the vast creature, and, I  am convinced, had the rescue depended upon their use of the boat, then  had those in the hulk been forever doomed.    Now, conceiving that this was a good point at which to renew my  importunities, I began once again to explain the probabilities of my plan  succeeding, addressing myself more particularly to the bo'sun. I told how  that I had read that the ancients made mighty weapons, some of which  could throw a great stone so heavy as two men, over a distance surpassing  a quarter of a mile; moreover, that they compassed huge catapults which  threw a lance, or great arrow, even further. On this, he expressed much  surprise, never having heard of the like; but doubted greatly that we  should be able to construct such a weapon. Yet, I told him that I was  prepared; for I had the plan of one clearly in my mind, and further I  pointed out to him that we had the wind in our favor, and that we were a  great height up, which would allow the arrow to travel the farther before  it came so low as the weed.    Then I stepped to the edge of the hill, and, bidding him watch, fitted my  arrow to the string, and, having bent the bow, loosed it, whereupon,  being aided by the wind and the height on which I stood, the arrow  plunged into the weed at a distance of near two hundred yards from where  we stood, that being about a quarter of the distance on the road to the  derelict. At that, the bo'sun was won over to my idea; though, as he  remarked, the arrow had fallen nearer had it been drawing a length of  yarn after it, and to this I assented; but pointed out that my bow and  arrow was but a rough affair, and, more, that I was no archer; yet I  promised him, with the bow that I should make, to cast a shaft clean over  the hulk, did he but give me his assistance, and bid the men to help.    Now, as I have come to regard it in the light of greater knowledge, my  promise was exceeding rash; but I had faith in my conception, and was  very eager to put it to the test; the which, after much discussion at  supper, it was decided I should be allowed to do.          XII    The Making of the Great Bow      The fourth night upon the island was the first to pass without incident.  It is true that a light showed from the hulk out in the weed; but now  that we had made some acquaintance with her inmates, it was no longer a  cause for excitement, so much as contemplation. As for the valley where  the vile things had made an end of Job, it was very silent and desolate  under the moonlight; for I made a point to go and view it during my time  on watch; yet, for all that it lay empty, it was very eerie, and a place  to conjure up uncomfortable thoughts, so that I spent no great time  pondering it.    This was the second night on which we had been free from the terror of  the devil-things, and it seemed to me that the great fire had put them in  fear of us and driven them away; but of the truth or error of this idea,  I was to learn later.    Now it must be admitted that, apart from a short look into the valley,  and occasional starings at the light out in the weed, I gave little  attention to aught but my plans for the great bow, and to such use did I  put my time, that when I was relieved, I had each particular and detail  worked out, so that I knew very well just what to set the men doing so  soon as we should make a start in the morning.    Presently, when the morning had come, and we had made an end of  breakfast, we turned-to upon the great bow, the bo'sun directing the men  under my supervision. Now, the first matter to which I bent attention,  was the raising, to the top of the hill, of the remaining half of that  portion of the topmast which the bo'sun had split in twain to procure the  batten for the boat. To this end, we went down, all of us, to the beach  where lay the wreckage, and, getting about the portion which I intended  to use, carried it to the foot of the hill; then we sent a man to the top  to let down the rope by which we had moored the boat to the sea anchor,  and when we had bent this on securely to the piece of timber, we returned  to the hill-top, and tailed on to the rope, and so, presently, after much  weariful pulling, had it up.    The next thing I desired was that the split face of the timber should be  rubbed straight, and this the bo'sun understood to do, and whilst he was  about it, I went with some of the men to the grove of reeds, and here,  with great care, I made a selection of some of the finest, these being  for the bow, and after that I cut some which were very clean and  straight, intending them for the great arrows. With these we returned  once more to the camp, and there I set-to and trimmed them of their  leaves, keeping these latter, for I had a use for them. Then I took a  dozen reeds and cut them each to a length of twenty-five feet, and  afterwards notched them for the strings. In the meanwhile, I had sent  two men down to the wreckage of the masts to cut away a couple of the  hempen shrouds and bring them to the camp, and they, appearing about  this time, I set to work to unlay the shrouds, so that they might get  out the fine white yarns which lay beneath the outer covering of tar  and"]]]
