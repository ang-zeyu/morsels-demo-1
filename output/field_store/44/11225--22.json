And when the words were ended, not unlike  To iron in the furnace, every cirque  Ebullient shot forth scintillating fires:  And every sparkle shivering to new blaze,  In number did outmillion the account  Reduplicate upon the chequer'd board.  Then heard I echoing on from choir to choir,  \"Hosanna,\" to the fixed point, that holds,  And shall for ever hold them to their place,  From everlasting, irremovable.    Musing awhile I stood: and she, who saw  by inward meditations, thus began:  \"In the first circles, they, whom thou beheldst,  Are seraphim and cherubim.  Thus swift  Follow their hoops, in likeness to the point,  Near as they can, approaching; and they can  The more, the loftier their vision.  Those,  That round them fleet, gazing the Godhead next,  Are thrones; in whom the first trine ends.  And all  Are blessed, even as their sight descends  Deeper into the truth, wherein rest is  For every mind.  Thus happiness hath root  In seeing, not in  loving, which of sight  Is aftergrowth.  And of the seeing such  The meed, as unto each in due degree  Grace and good-will their measure have assign'd.  The other trine, that with still opening buds  In this eternal springtide blossom fair,  Fearless of bruising from the nightly ram,  Breathe up in warbled melodies threefold  Hosannas blending ever, from the three  Transmitted. hierarchy of gods, for aye  Rejoicing, dominations first, next then  Virtues, and powers the third.  The next to whom  Are princedoms and archangels, with glad round  To tread their festal ring; and last the band  Angelical, disporting in their sphere.  All, as they circle in their orders, look  Aloft, and downward with such sway prevail,  That all with mutual impulse tend to God.  These once a mortal view beheld.  Desire  In Dionysius so intently wrought,  That he, as I have done rang'd them; and nam'd  Their orders, marshal'd in his thought.  From him  Dissentient, one refus'd his sacred read.  But soon as in this heav'n his doubting eyes  Were open'd, Gregory at his error smil'd  Nor marvel, that a denizen of earth  Should scan such secret truth; for he had learnt  Both this and much beside of these our orbs,  From an eye-witness to heav'n's mysteries.\"          CANTO XXIX    No longer than what time Latona's twins  Cover'd of Libra and the fleecy star,  Together both, girding the' horizon hang,  In even balance from the zenith pois'd,  Till from that verge, each, changing hemisphere,  Part the nice level; e'en so brief a space  Did Beatrice's silence hold.  A smile  Bat painted on her cheek; and her fix'd gaze  Bent on the point, at which my vision fail'd:  When thus her words resuming she began:  \"I speak, nor what thou wouldst inquire demand;  For I have mark'd it, where all time and place  Are present.  Not for increase to himself  Of good, which may not be increas'd, but forth  To manifest his glory by its beams,  Inhabiting his own eternity,  Beyond time's limit or what bound soe'er  To circumscribe his being, as he will'd,  Into new natures, like unto himself,  Eternal Love unfolded.  Nor before,  As if in dull inaction torpid lay.  For not in process of before or aft  Upon these waters mov'd the Spirit of God.  Simple and mix'd, both form and substance, forth  To perfect being started, like three darts  Shot from a bow three-corded.  And as ray  In crystal, glass, and amber, shines entire,  E'en at the moment of its issuing; thus  Did, from th' eternal Sovran, beam entire  His threefold operation, at one act  Produc'd coeval.  Yet in order each  Created his due station knew: those highest,  Who pure intelligence were made: mere power  The lowest: in the midst, bound with strict league,  Intelligence and power, unsever'd bond.  Long tract of ages by the angels past,  Ere the creating of another world,  Describ'd on Jerome's pages thou hast seen.  But that what I disclose to thee is true,  Those penmen, whom the Holy Spirit mov'd  In many a passage of their sacred book  Attest; as thou by diligent search shalt find  And reason in some sort discerns the same,  Who scarce would grant the heav'nly ministers  Of their perfection void, so long a space.  Thus when and where these spirits of love were made,  Thou know'st, and how: and knowing hast allay'd  Thy thirst, which from the triple question rose.  Ere one had reckon'd twenty, e'en so soon  Part of the angels fell: and in their fall  Confusion to your elements ensued.  The others kept their station: and this task,  Whereon thou lookst, began with such delight,  That they surcease not ever, day nor night,  Their circling.  Of that fatal lapse the cause  Was the curst pride of him, whom thou hast seen  Pent with the world's incumbrance.  Those, whom here  Thou seest, were lowly to confess themselves  Of his free bounty, who had made them apt  For ministries so high: therefore their views  Were by enlight'ning grace and their own merit  Exalted; so that in their will confirm'd  They stand, nor feel to fall.  For do not doubt,  But to receive the grace, which heav'n vouchsafes,  Is meritorious, even as the soul  With prompt affection welcometh the guest.  Now, without further help, if with good heed  My words thy mind have treasur'd, thou henceforth  This consistory round about mayst scan,  And gaze thy fill.  But since thou hast on earth  Heard vain disputers, reasoners in the schools,  Canvas the' angelic nature, and dispute  Its powers of apprehension, memory, choice;  Therefore, 't is well thou take from me the truth,  Pure and without disguise, which they below,  Equivocating, darken and perplex.    \"Know thou, that, from the first, these substances,  Rejoicing in the countenance of God,  Have held unceasingly their view, intent  Upon the glorious vision, from the which  Naught absent is nor hid: where then no change  Of newness with succession interrupts,  Remembrance there needs none to gather up  Divided thought and images remote    \"So that men, thus at variance with the truth  Dream, though their eyes be open; reckless some  Of error; others well aware they err,  To whom more guilt and shame are justly due.  Each the known track of sage philosophy  Deserts, and has a byway of his own:  So much the restless eagerness to shine  And love of singularity prevail.  Yet this, offensive as it is, provokes  Heav'n's anger less, than when the book of God  Is forc'd to yield to man's authority,  Or from its straightness warp'd: no reck'ning made  What blood the sowing of it in the world  Has cost; what favour for himself he wins,  Who meekly clings to it.  The aim of all  Is how to shine: e'en they, whose office is  To preach the Gospel, let the gospel sleep,  And pass their own inventions off instead.  One tells, how at Christ's suffering the wan moon  Bent back her steps, and shadow'd o'er the sun  With intervenient disk, as she withdrew:  Another, how the light shrouded itself  Within its tabernacle, and left dark  The Spaniard and the Indian, with the Jew.  Such fables Florence in her pulpit hears,  Bandied about more frequent, than the names  Of Bindi and of Lapi in her streets.  The sheep, meanwhile, poor witless ones, return  From pasture, fed with wind: and what avails  For their excuse, they do not see their harm?  Christ said not to his first conventicle,  'Go forth and preach impostures to the world,'  But gave them truth to build on; and the sound  Was mighty on their lips; nor needed they,  Beside the gospel, other spear or shield,  To aid them in their warfare for the faith.  The preacher now provides himself with store  Of jests and gibes; and, so there be no lack  Of laughter, while he vents them, his big cowl  Distends, and he has won the meed he sought:  Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while  Of that dark bird which nestles in his hood,  They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said.  Which now the dotards hold in such esteem,  That every counterfeit, who spreads abroad  The hands of holy promise, finds a throng  Of credulous fools beneath.  Saint Anthony  Fattens with this his swine, and others worse  Than swine, who diet at his lazy board,  Paying with unstamp'd metal for their fare.    \"But (for we far have wander'd) let us seek  The forward path again; so as the way  Be shorten'd with the time.  No mortal tongue  Nor thought of man hath ever reach'd so far,  That of these natures he might count the tribes.  What Daniel of their thousands hath reveal'd  With finite number infinite conceals.  The fountain at whose source these drink their beams,  With light supplies them in as many modes,  As there are splendours, that it shines on: each  According to the virtue it conceives,  Differing in love and sweet affection.  Look then how lofty and how huge in breadth  The' eternal might, which, broken and dispers'd  Over such countless mirrors, yet remains  Whole in itself and one, as at the first.\"          CANTO XXX    Noon's fervid hour perchance six thousand miles  From hence is distant; and the shadowy cone  Almost to level on our earth declines;  When from the midmost of this blue abyss  By turns some star is to our vision lost.  And straightway as the handmaid of the sun  Puts forth her radiant brow, all, light by light,  Fade, and the spangled firmament shuts in,  E'en to the loveliest of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1008"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Complete (#18)"],[1,"elm'd the doubt in Caesar's mind,  Affirming that delay to men prepar'd  Was ever harmful.  \"Oh  how terrified  Methought was Curio, from whose throat was cut  The tongue, which spake that hardy word.  Then one  Maim'd of each hand, uplifted in the gloom  The bleeding stumps, that they with gory spots  Sullied his face, and cried: \"'Remember thee  Of Mosca, too, I who, alas!  exclaim'd,  'The deed once done there is an end,' that prov'd  A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race.\"       I added:  \"Ay, and death to thine own tribe.\"       Whence heaping woe on woe he hurried off,  As one grief stung to madness.  But I there  Still linger'd to behold the troop, and saw  Things, such as I may fear without more proof  To tell of, but that conscience makes me firm,  The boon companion, who her strong breast-plate  Buckles on him, that feels no guilt within  And bids him on and fear not.  Without doubt  I saw, and yet it seems to pass before me,  A headless trunk, that even as the rest  Of the sad flock pac'd onward.  By the hair  It bore the sever'd member, lantern-wise  Pendent in hand, which look'd at us and said,  \"Woe's me!\"  The spirit lighted thus himself,  And two there were in one, and one in two.  How that may be he knows who ordereth so.       When at the bridge's foot direct he stood,  His arm aloft he rear'd, thrusting the head  Full in our view, that nearer we might hear  The words, which thus it utter'd:  \"Now behold  This grievous torment, thou, who breathing go'st  To spy the dead; behold if any else  Be terrible as this.  And that on earth  Thou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I  Am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John  The counsel mischievous.  Father and son  I set at mutual war.  For Absalom  And David more did not Ahitophel,  Spurring them on maliciously to strife.  For parting those so closely knit, my brain  Parted, alas!  I carry from its source,  That in this trunk inhabits.  Thus the law  Of retribution fiercely works in me.\"        CANTO XXIX    SO were mine eyes inebriate with view  Of the vast multitude, whom various wounds  Disfigur'd, that they long'd to stay and weep.       But Virgil rous'd me:  \"What yet gazest on?  Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below  Among the maim'd and miserable shades?  Thou hast not shewn in any chasm beside  This weakness.  Know, if thou wouldst number them  That two and twenty miles the valley winds  Its circuit, and already is the moon  Beneath our feet:  the time permitted now  Is short, and more not seen remains to see.\"       \"If thou,\" I straight replied, \"hadst weigh'd the cause  For which I look'd, thou hadst perchance excus'd  The tarrying still.\"  My leader part pursu'd  His way, the while I follow'd, answering him,  And adding thus:  \"Within that cave I deem,  Whereon so fixedly I held my ken,  There is a spirit dwells, one of my blood,  Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear.\"       Then spake my master: \"Let thy soul no more  Afflict itself for him.  Direct elsewhere  Its thought, and leave him.  At the bridge's foot  I mark'd how he did point with menacing look  At thee, and heard him by the others nam'd  Geri of Bello.  Thou so wholly then  Wert busied with his spirit, who once rul'd  The towers of Hautefort, that thou lookedst not  That way, ere he was gone.\"--\"O guide belov'd!  His violent death yet unaveng'd,\" said I,  \"By any, who are partners in his shame,  Made him contemptuous:  therefore, as I think,  He pass'd me speechless by; and doing so  Hath made me more compassionate his fate.\"       So we discours'd to where the rock first show'd  The other valley, had more light been there,  E'en to the lowest depth.  Soon as we came  O'er the last cloister in the dismal rounds  Of Malebolge, and the brotherhood  Were to our view expos'd, then many a dart  Of sore lament assail'd me, headed all  With points of thrilling pity, that I clos'd  Both ears against the volley with mine hands.       As were the torment, if each lazar-house  Of Valdichiana, in the sultry time  'Twixt July and September, with the isle  Sardinia and Maremma's pestilent fen,  Had heap'd their maladies all in one foss  Together; such was here the torment: dire  The stench, as issuing steams from fester'd limbs.       We on the utmost shore of the long rock  Descended still to leftward.  Then my sight  Was livelier to explore the depth, wherein  The minister of the most mighty Lord,  All-searching Justice, dooms to punishment  The forgers noted on her dread record.       More rueful was it not methinks to see  The nation in Aegina droop, what time  Each living thing, e'en to the little worm,  All fell, so full of malice was the air  (And afterward, as bards of yore have told,  The ancient people were restor'd anew  From seed of emmets) than was here to see  The spirits, that languish'd through the murky vale  Up-pil'd on many a stack.  Confus'd they lay,  One o'er the belly, o'er the shoulders one  Roll'd of another; sideling crawl'd a third  Along the dismal pathway.  Step by step  We journey'd on, in silence looking round  And list'ning those diseas'd, who strove in vain  To lift their forms.  Then two I mark'd, that sat  Propp'd 'gainst each other, as two brazen pans  Set to retain the heat.  From head to foot,  A tetter bark'd them round. Nor saw I e'er  Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord  Impatient waited, or himself perchance  Tir'd with long watching, as of these each one  Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness  Of ne'er abated pruriency.  The crust  Came drawn from underneath in flakes, like scales  Scrap'd from the bream or fish of broader mail.       \"O thou, who with thy fingers rendest off  Thy coat of proof,\" thus spake my guide to one,  \"And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them,  Tell me if any born of Latian land  Be among these within: so may thy nails  Serve thee for everlasting to this toil.\"       \"Both are of Latium,\" weeping he replied,  \"Whom tortur'd thus thou seest:  but who art thou  That hast inquir'd of us?\"  To whom my guide:  \"One that descend with this man, who yet lives,  From rock to rock, and show him hell's abyss.\"       Then started they asunder, and each turn'd  Trembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear  Those words redounding struck.  To me my liege  Address'd him:  \"Speak to them whate'er thou list.\"       And I therewith began:  \"So may no time  Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men  In th' upper world, but after many suns  Survive it, as ye tell me, who ye are,  And of what race ye come.  Your punishment,  Unseemly and disgustful in its kind,  Deter you not from opening thus much to me.\"       \"Arezzo was my dwelling,\" answer'd one,  \"And me Albero of Sienna brought  To die by fire; but that, for which I died,  Leads me not here.  True is in sport I told him,  That I had learn'd to wing my flight in air.  And he admiring much, as he was void  Of wisdom, will'd me to declare to him  The secret of mine art:  and only hence,  Because I made him not a Daedalus,  Prevail'd on one suppos'd his sire to burn me.  But Minos to this chasm last of the ten,  For that I practis'd alchemy on earth,  Has doom'd me.  Him no subterfuge eludes.\"       Then to the bard I spake:  \"Was ever race  Light as Sienna's?  Sure not France herself  Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain.\"       The other leprous spirit heard my words,  And thus return'd:  \"Be Stricca from this charge  Exempted, he who knew so temp'rately  To lay out fortune's gifts; and Niccolo  Who first the spice's costly luxury  Discover'd in that garden, where such seed  Roots deepest in the soil:  and be that troop  Exempted, with whom Caccia of Asciano  Lavish'd his vineyards and wide-spreading woods,  And his rare wisdom Abbagliato show'd  A spectacle for all.  That thou mayst know  Who seconds thee against the Siennese  Thus gladly, bend this way thy sharpen'd sight,  That well my face may answer to thy ken;  So shalt thou see I am Capocchio's ghost,  Who forg'd transmuted metals by the power  Of alchemy; and if I scan thee right,  Thus needs must well remember how I aped  Creative nature by my subtle art.\"        CANTO XXX    WHAT time resentment burn'd in Juno's breast  For Semele against the Theban blood,  As more than once in dire mischance was rued,  Such fatal frenzy seiz'd on Athamas,  That he his spouse beholding with a babe  Laden on either arm, \"Spread out,\" he cried,  \"The meshes, that I take the lioness  And the young lions at the pass:  \"then forth  Stretch'd he his merciless talons, grasping one,  One helpless innocent, Learchus nam'd,  Whom swinging down he dash'd upon a rock,  And with her other burden self-destroy'd  The hapless mother plung'd:  and when the pride  Of all-presuming Troy fell from its height,  By fortune overwhelm'd, and the old king  With his realm perish'd, then did Hecuba,  A wretch forlorn and captive, when she saw  Polyxena first slaughter'd, and her son,  Her Polydorus, on the wild sea-beach  Next met the mourner's view, then reft of sense  Did she run barking even as a dog;  Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul.  Bet ne'er the Furies or of Thebes or Troy  With such fell cruelty were seen, their goads  Infixing in the limbs of man or beast,  As now two pale and naked ghost I saw  That gnarling wildly scamper'd, like the swine  Excluded from his stye.  One reach'd Capocchio,  And in the neck-joint sticking deep his fangs,  Dragg'd him, that o'er the solid pavement rubb'd  His belly stretch'd out prone.  The other shape,  He of Arezzo, there left trembling, spake;  \"That sprite of air is Schicchi; in like mood  Of random mischief vent he still his spite.\"       To whom I answ'ring:  \"Oh!  as thou dost hope,  The other may not flesh its jaws on thee,  Be patient to inform us, who it is,  Ere it speed hence.\"--\" That is the ancient soul  Of wretched Myrrha,\" he replied, \"who burn'd  With most unholy flame for her own sire,  And a false shape assuming, so perform'd  The deed of sin; e'en as the "]]]
