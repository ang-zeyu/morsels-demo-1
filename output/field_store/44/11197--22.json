Taffy shrunk back, as a draught of the close, dead air struck his  nostrils.    \"Come on, and don't be afraid. I'm going to make you rich,\" said the  sorcerer.    At this, Taffy's eyes glistened, and he followed on down the steps,  without saying a word. At the bottom of the descent, they entered a  narrow passage, and finally came to a door.    \"Now, I'll ask you. Are you brave, and will you come in with me, if I  open this door?\"    By this time, Taffy was so eager for treasure, that he spoke up at  once.    \"I'm not afraid. Open the door.\"    The sorcerer gave a jerk and the door flew open. What a sight!    There, in the faint, red light, Taffy discerned a great cave. Lying on  the floor were hundreds of armed men, but motionless and apparently  sound asleep. Little spangles of light were reflected from swords,  spears, round shields, and burnished helmets. All these seemed of very  ancient pattern. But immediately in front of them was a bell. Taffy  felt some curiosity to tap it. Would the sleeping host of men then  rise up?    Just then, the sorcerer, speaking with a menacing gesture, and in a  harsh tone, said:    \"Do not touch that bell, or it's all up with us both.\"    Moving carefully, so as not to trip, or to stumble over the sleeping  soldiers, they went on, and Taffy, stopping and looking up beheld  before him a great round table. Many warriors were sitting at it.  Their splendid gold inlaid armor, glittering helmets and noble faces  showed that they were no common men. Yet Taffy could see only a few of  the faces, for all had their heads more or less bent down, as if sound  asleep, though sword and spear were near at hand, ready to be grasped  in a moment.    Outshining all, was a golden throne at the farther end of the table  and on it sat a king. He was of imposing stature, and august presence.  Upon his head was a crown, on which were inlaid or set precious  stones. These shone by their own light, sending out rays so brilliant  that they dazzled Taffy, who had never seen anything like them. The  king held in his right hand a mighty sword. It had a history and the  name of it was Excalibur. In Arthur's hand, it was almost part of his  own soul. Its hilt and handle were of finely chased gold, richly  studded with gems. Yet his head, too, was bent in deep sleep, as if  only thunder could wake him.    \"Are they all, everyone, asleep?\" asked Taffy.    \"Each and all,\" was the answer.    \"When did they fall asleep?\" asked the drover.    \"Over a thousand years ago,\" answered the sorcerer.    \"Tell me who they are, and why here,\" asked Taffy.    \"They are King Arthur's trusty warriors. They are waiting for the hour  to come, when they shall rise up and destroy the enemies of the Cymry,  and once again possess the whole island of Britain, as in the early  ages, before the Saxons came.\"    \"And who are those sitting around the table?\" asked Taffy.    The sorcerer seemed tired of answering questions, but he replied,  giving the name of each knight, and also that of his father, as if he  were a Welshman himself; but at this, Taffy grew impatient, feeling as  if a book of genealogy had been hurled at him.    Most impolitely, he interrupted his companion and cried out:    \"And who is that on the throne?\"    The sorcerer looked as if he was vexed, and felt insulted, but he  answered:    \"It's King Arthur himself, with Excalibur, his famous sword, in his  hand.\"    This was snapped out, as if the sorcerer was disgusted at the  interruption of his genealogy, and he shut his mouth tight as if he  would answer no more questions, for such an impolite fellow.    Seizing Taffy by the hand, he led him into what was the storehouse of  the cave. There lay heaps upon heaps of yellow gold. Both men stuffed  their pockets, belt bags, and the inside of their clothes, with all  they could load in.    \"Now we had better get out, for it is time to go,\" said the sorcerer  and he led the way towards the cave door.    But as Taffy passed back, and along the hall, where the host of  warriors were sleeping, his curiosity got the better of him.    He said to himself, \"I must see this host awake. I'll touch that bell,  and find out whether the sorcerer spoke the truth.\"    So, when he came to it, he struck the bell. In the twinkling of an  eye, thousands of warriors sprang up, seized their armor, girded their  swords, or seized their spears. All seemed eagerly awaiting the  command to rush against the foe.    The ground quaked with their tramping, and shook with their tread,  until Taffy thought the cave roof would fall in and bury them all. The  air resounded with the rattle of arms, as the men, when in ranks,  marked time, ready for motion forward and out of the cave.    But from the midst of the host, a deep sounding voice, as earnest as  if in hot temper, but as deliberate as if in caution against a false  alarm, spoke. He inquired:    \"Who rang that bell? Has the day come?\"    The sorcerer, thoroughly frightened and trembling, answered:    \"No, the day has not come. Sleep on.\"    Taffy, though dazzled by the increasing brilliancy of the light, had  heard another deep voice, more commanding in its tones than even a  king's, call out, \"Arthur, awake, the bell has rung. The day is  breaking. Awake, great King Arthur!\"    But even against such a voice, that of the sorcerer, now scared beyond  measure, lest the king and his host should discover the cheat, and  with his sword, Excalibur, chop the heads off both Taffy and himself,  answered:    \"No, it is still night. Sleep on, Arthur the Great.\"    Erect over all, his head aloft and crowned with jewels, as with stars,  the King himself now spoke:    \"No, my warriors, the day has not yet come, when the Black Eagle and  the Golden Eagle will meet in war. Sleep on, loyal souls. The morning  of Wales has not yet dawned.\"    Then, like the gentle soughing of the evening breeze among forest  trees, all sound died away, and in the snap of a finger, all were  asleep again. Seizing the hand of Taffy, the sorcerer hurried him out  of the cave, moved the stone back in its place and motioning to Taffy  to do the same, he quickly shoveled and kicked the loose dirt in the  hole and stamped it down: When Taffy turned to look for him, he was  gone, without even taking the trouble to call his dupe a fool.    Wearied with his unwonted labors and excitements, Taffy walked home,  got his supper, pondered on what he had seen, slept, and awoke in the  morning refreshed. After breakfast, he sallied out again with pick and  shovel.    For months, Taffy dug over every square foot of the hill. Neglecting  his business as cattle man, he spent all the money he had made in  London, but he never found that entrance to the cave. He died a poor  man and all his children had to work hard to get their bread.          XVII      THE LADY OF THE LAKE      One easily gets acquainted with the Welsh fairies, for nearly all the  good ones are very fond of music.    Or, they live down in the lakes, or up in the mountains. They are  always ready to help kind or polite people, who treat them well or  will give them a glass of milk, or a saucer of flummery.    But, oh, what tricks and mischief they do play on mean or stingy or  grumpy folks with bad tempers! They tangle up the harness of the  horses; milk the cows, letting the milk go to waste, on the stable  floor; tie knots in their tails, or keep the dog's mouth shut, when  the robbers come sneaking around. Better not offend a fairy, even  though no higher than a thimble!    A favorite place for the elfin ladies of the lake is high up in one of  the fresh water mountain ponds. They are cousins to the mermaids, that  swim in the salt water.    They say that these lake maidens love to come up close to the shore,  to smell the sweet grass and flowers, which the cows like so much.    Near one of these lakes dwelt a widow, with only one son, named Gwyn.  One day he took his lunch of barley bread and cheese, and went out, as  usual, to tend the cows. Soon he saw rising out of the water, to dress  her long and luxuriant hair, the most beautiful lady he had ever seen.  In her hand she held a golden comb, and was using the bright  lake-surface as a mirror.    At once Gwyn fell in love with her, and, like an unselfish lad, held  out his refreshments--barley bread and cheese--all he had--bidding her  to come and take.    But though the lady glided toward him, while he still held out his  hand, she shook her head, saying:      O thou of the hard baked bread,    It is not easy to catch me    Sorry enough to miss such a prize, he hurried home to tell his mother.  She, wondering also, whether fairies have teeth to chew, told him to  take soft dough next time. Then, perhaps, the strange lady would come  again.    Not much sleep did the boy get that night, and, before the sun was up,  he was down by the lake side holding out his dough.    There, hour after hour, neglecting the cows, he looked eagerly over  the water, but nothing appeared, except ripples started by the breeze.  Again and again, he gazed in hope, only to be disappointed.    [Illustration: IN A MOMENT HE FORGOT EVERY WORD HE MEANT TO SAY]    Meanwhile he thought out a pretty speech to make to her, but he kept  his dough and went hungry.    It was late in the afternoon, when the trees on the hills were casting  long shadows westward, that he gave up watching, for he supposed she  would come no more.    But just as he started to go back to his mother's cabin, he turned his  head and there was the same lady, looking more beautiful than ever. In  a moment, he forgot every word he meant to say to her. His tongue  seemed to leave him, and he only held out his hand, with the dough in  it.    But the lake lady, shaking her head, only laughed and said:      Thou of the soft bread    I will not have thee    Though she dived under the water and left him sad and lonely, she  smiled so sweetly, as she vanished, that, though "]]]
