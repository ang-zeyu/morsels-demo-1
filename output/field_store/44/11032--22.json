Equally absurd and untrue is your correspondent's second implied  charge, viz., that the central idea of Mormon government is priesthood  rule, therefore \"how could it be otherwise than anti-American?\"  The gentleman leaves us in the mists here. What does he mean? Is  it anti-American to have priesthood rule in an ecclesiastical  institution--in a Church? What kind of rule would he have but that of a  priesthood rule in such organizations? If it is anti-American to have  priesthood rule in a church organization, then every church in the land  is anti-American. But if the gentleman protests that this is not what  he meant, but that he meant priesthood rule in civil government, then  I must say to him that there is no ecclesiastical institution in all  our land that in its doctrines more clearly recognizes the separation  of the Church from the State than does the Mormon Church. In proof of  which I quote on that head the following from an authoritative work on  the doctrine of the Mormon Church:        \"We believe that religion is instituted of God, and that men are      amenable to him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless      their religious opinions prompt them to infringe upon the rights      and liberties of others; but we do not believe that human law      has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind      the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private      devotion; that the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but      never control conscience; should punish guilt, but never suppress      the freedom of the soul. * * * * We do not believe it just to      mingle religious influence with civil government, whereby one      religious society is fostered, and another proscribed in its      spiritual privileges, and the individual rights of its members as      citizens, denied.\" (Doctrine and Covenants, Section 134.)    Again, in a revelation given as early as 1831, the Lord said to the  Church:        \"Behold, the laws which ye have received from my hand are the laws      of the Church, and in this light ye shall hold them forth.\"    That is, the revelations received were given for the government of  the Church, not for the laws of the state; to instruct the saints in  their religious duties and privileges, not to interfere with them in  the exercise of their civil rights, nor to dictate to them in their  political actions. This doctrine has been affirmed over and over again  by the present officials of the Mormon Church. And as for the exercise  of \"priesthood rule\" in practice in political affairs, in all good  conscience and form both observation and experience: I can say that  there is less of it chargeable to the Mormon Church officials than to  ministers of any other denominations whatsoever in our land. And no  other people of our land have suffered so much from mingling religious  influence in political affairs, as have the Mormon people. Nearly  every Legislative enactment, either state or national, has been the  direct result of the exercise of sectarian ministerial influence upon  legislators, state and national, as also have been nearly all the acts  of mob violence perpetrated against the same people which resulted in  their expulsion from Missouri and Illinois.    Your correspondent says that the multiplied statements of Joseph  Smith's acquaintances and neighbors prove that he was was immoral  and corrupt, and that since Mormonism has such an origin he wants  to know \"how it could be otherwise than mischievous and immoral in  its tendencies and results.\" Your correspondent here assumes that  Joseph Smith was immoral and corrupt, and hence his system can be  none other than mischievous and evil in its tendencies. \"But,\" it  will be said, \"his premise rests upon the alleged testimony of  Joseph Smith's acquaintances and neighbors.\" What acquaintances and  neighbors? Of course if you eliminate from this list all those who  knew Joseph Smith best, his friends and followers, who so far believed  in him and his honor and integrity as a man and prophet of God that  they sacrificed their own good name, together with property and all  earthly prospects in accepting the doctrine he taught, and then rely  alone for a description of his character upon the testimony of his  persecutors and revilers led on by bigoted priests who hounded him  through fourteen years of his troubled life, until they succeeded in  bringing about his murder in cold blood at Carthage, Illinois, why,  of course; I suppose that such testimony could be said to prove that  he was immoral and corrupt. But under such methods of proving things  how would the immaculate life and character of the Son of God himself  stand before the world? Jesus would be proved to be a wine-bibber, an  associate of sinners and publicans, one who went about the country in  the companionship of women of questionable character, an imposter who  was so in league with Satan that he cast out devils by the power of  Beelzebub, an agitator disturbing the peace, a leader of seditions,  a perverter of laws and customs, and who at the last was fittingly  crucified between two thieves after being condemned under due forms  of law, and who attracted to him a following that could be regarded  as the off-scourings of despised Galilee, and who were so vile as to  steal his dead body from the tomb by night, and then put in circulation  the story that he had risen bodily from the dead! From such a basis as  this, all of which can be established \"by the multiplied testimony\"  of the Savior's \"acquaintances and neighbors,\" we could, with your  correspondent exclaim, \"how could the system\" emanating from such a  founder \"be otherwise than mischievous and immoral in its tendencies  and results?\"    It would be easy to prove that from the beginning of Mormonism until  now there are many men of wide reputation, men of national repute  and high character, who have testified of the purity of life and  honorable conduct of Joseph Smith and the general honesty and high  moral character of his following. But it is impossible to quote such  testimony because of the necessary limits of this communication, and  it is not necessary because the premise from which your correspondent  starts is utterly untenable and foolish.    Your correspondent scoffs at the idea that Mormons married their  plural wives in good faith, and that it would now be a crime to  abandon them, and declares that your representative could as well have  talked about \"committing the crime of bank robbing in good faith.\" The  gentleman rushes a little too quickly to his conclusion. Things he  puts in comparison are altogether unlike. It is a truth to begin with  that the Mormon people accepted the doctrine of plural marriage as a  revelation and commandment from God; and they did marry their wives  under what they considered divine sanction, in good faith, believing  that they were protected in the practice of a religious principle  by the constitution of their country, which specifically prohibited  the passage of laws \"respecting an establishment of religion, or  prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" Furthermore, this doctrine was  sanctioned by the practice of the Bible patriarchs, whom the Son of  God himself upheld in his teaching as the very favorites of heaven,  whom God had made his own especial witnesses of the truths he would  teach mankind. It was well on to half a century before the Supreme  Court of the United States had finally decided at all points the  constitutionality of the several acts of Congress against the exercise  of this religious doctrine of the Latter-day Saints, during which  time a whole generation had lived in the practice of it, believing  absolutely in its righteousness, in its divinity in fact, and it is not  difficult to understand how men under such circumstances married their  wives in good faith.    Moreover, when this matter was finally settled by the adoption of our  State Constitution, the enabling act passed by Congress only demanded  on this subject of polygamy that the constitutional convention should  provide by ordinance \"irrevocably without the consent of the United  States and the people of said state, * * * * that no inhabitant of  said state should be molested in person or property on account of his  or her mode of religious worship: _provided that polygamous or plural  marriages are forever prohibited.\"_ It will be observed that there is  no demand made in this for the abandonment of plural marriage relations  already established under the Mormon doctrine of plural marriage.  Nothing is required on that head, but that for the future there  shall be a prohibition of \"polygamous marriages.\" The action of the  constitutional convention was in harmony with this demand of the people  of the United States, and the ordinance in our state constitution  was adopted in such form and spirit that while future polygamous or  plural marriages, were forever prohibited, it contemplated leaving  undisturbed the already existing plural marriage relations. Under  these circumstances I do not hesitate to say that for Mormon men to  abandon the wives they had taken in good faith, who had been induced  to accept that relationship under religious persuasion and conviction,  would be both cowardly and criminal in the eyes of God and all good and  respectable men.    Your correspondent undertakes to make much of the fact that        \"The Mormons have lived in five different states. * * * * If their      system is as pure morally and as patriotic as it is claimed to      be, how does it happen that their sojourn in each of these states      was characterized by continued and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/479"],[0,"Little Lord Fauntleroy (#17)"],[1,"he wanted--anything he  wanted--and what he wanted, it seems, was money to give to beggars.\"    \"Oh! but they weren't beggars,\" said Fauntleroy eagerly. \"Michael was a  splendid bricklayer! They all worked.\"    \"Oh!\" said the Earl, \"they were not beggars. They were splendid  bricklayers, and bootblacks, and apple-women.\"    He bent his gaze on the boy for a few seconds in silence. The fact was  that a new thought was coming to him, and though, perhaps, it was not  prompted by the noblest emotions, it was not a bad thought. \"Come here,\"  he said, at last.    Fauntleroy went and stood as near to him as possible without encroaching  on the gouty foot.    \"What would YOU do in this case?\" his lordship asked.    It must be confessed that Mr. Mordaunt experienced for the moment a  curious sensation. Being a man of great thoughtfulness, and having spent  so many years on the estate of Dorincourt, knowing the tenantry, rich  and poor, the people of the village, honest and industrious, dishonest  and lazy, he realized very strongly what power for good or evil would be  given in the future to this one small boy standing there, his brown eyes  wide open, his hands deep in his pockets; and the thought came to him  also that a great deal of power might, perhaps, through the caprice of  a proud, self-indulgent old man, be given to him now, and that if his  young nature were not a simple and generous one, it might be the worst  thing that could happen, not only for others, but for himself.    \"And what would YOU do in such a case?\" demanded the Earl.    Fauntleroy drew a little nearer, and laid one hand on his knee, with the  most confiding air of good comradeship.    \"If I were very rich,\" he said, \"and not only just a little boy, I  should let him stay, and give him the things for his children; but  then, I am only a boy.\" Then, after a second's pause, in which his face  brightened visibly, \"YOU can do anything, can't you?\" he said.    \"Humph!\" said my lord, staring at him. \"That's your opinion, is it?\" And  he was not displeased either.    \"I mean you can give any one anything,\" said Fauntleroy. \"Who's Newick?\"    \"He is my agent,\" answered the Earl, \"and some of my tenants are not  over-fond of him.\"    \"Are you going to write him a letter now?\" inquired Fauntleroy. \"Shall I  bring you the pen and ink? I can take the game off this table.\"    It plainly had not for an instant occurred to him that Newick would be  allowed to do his worst.    The Earl paused a moment, still looking at him. \"Can you write?\" he  asked.    \"Yes,\" answered Cedric, \"but not very well.\"    \"Move the things from the table,\" commanded my lord, \"and bring the pen  and ink, and a sheet of paper from my desk.\"    Mr. Mordaunt's interest began to increase. Fauntleroy did as he was told  very deftly. In a few moments, the sheet of paper, the big inkstand, and  the pen were ready.    \"There!\" he said gayly, \"now you can write it.\"    \"You are to write it,\" said the Earl.    \"I!\" exclaimed Fauntleroy, and a flush overspread his forehead. \"Will  it do if I write it? I don't always spell quite right when I haven't a  dictionary, and nobody tells me.\"    \"It will do,\" answered the Earl. \"Higgins will not complain of the  spelling. I'm not the philanthropist; you are. Dip your pen in the ink.\"    Fauntleroy took up the pen and dipped it in the ink-bottle, then he  arranged himself in position, leaning on the table.    \"Now,\" he inquired, \"what must I say?\"    \"You may say, 'Higgins is not to be interfered with, for the present,'  and sign it, 'Fauntleroy,'\" said the Earl.    Fauntleroy dipped his pen in the ink again, and resting his arm, began  to write. It was rather a slow and serious process, but he gave his  whole soul to it. After a while, however, the manuscript was complete,  and he handed it to his grandfather with a smile slightly tinged with  anxiety.    \"Do you think it will do?\" he asked.    The Earl looked at it, and the corners of his mouth twitched a little.    \"Yes,\" he answered; \"Higgins will find it entirely satisfactory.\" And he  handed it to Mr. Mordaunt.    What Mr. Mordaunt found written was this:      \"Dear mr. Newik if you pleas mr. higins is not to be intur feared with  for the present and oblige. Yours rispecferly,    \"FAUNTLEROY.\"      \"Mr. Hobbs always signed his letters that way,\" said Fauntleroy; \"and I  thought I'd better say 'please.' Is that exactly the right way to spell  'interfered'?\"    \"It's not exactly the way it is spelled in the dictionary,\" answered the  Earl.    \"I was afraid of that,\" said Fauntleroy. \"I ought to have asked. You  see, that's the way with words of more than one syllable; you have to  look in the dictionary. It's always safest. I'll write it over again.\"    And write it over again he did, making quite an imposing copy, and  taking precautions in the matter of spelling by consulting the Earl  himself.    \"Spelling is a curious thing,\" he said. \"It's so often different  from what you expect it to be. I used to think 'please' was spelled  p-l-e-e-s, but it isn't, you know; and you'd think 'dear' was spelled  d-e-r-e, if you didn't inquire. Sometimes it almost discourages you.\"    When Mr. Mordaunt went away, he took the letter with him, and he took  something else with him also--namely, a pleasanter feeling and a more  hopeful one than he had ever carried home with him down that avenue on  any previous visit he had made at Dorincourt Castle.    When he was gone, Fauntleroy, who had accompanied him to the door, went  back to his grandfather.    \"May I go to Dearest now?\" he asked. \"I think she will be waiting for  me.\"    The Earl was silent a moment.    \"There is something in the stable for you to see first,\" he said. \"Ring  the bell.\"    \"If you please,\" said Fauntleroy, with his quick little flush. \"I'm very  much obliged; but I think I'd better see it to-morrow. She will be  expecting me all the time.\"    \"Very well,\" answered the Earl. \"We will order the carriage.\" Then he  added dryly, \"It's a pony.\"    Fauntleroy drew a long breath.    \"A pony!\" he exclaimed. \"Whose pony is it?\"    \"Yours,\" replied the Earl.    \"Mine?\" cried the little fellow. \"Mine--like the things upstairs?\"    \"Yes,\" said his grandfather. \"Would you like to see it? Shall I order it  to be brought around?\"    Fauntleroy's cheeks grew redder and redder.    \"I never thought I should have a pony!\" he said. \"I never thought that!  How glad Dearest will be. You give me EVERYthing, don't you?\"    \"Do you wish to see it?\" inquired the Earl.    Fauntleroy drew a long breath. \"I WANT to see it,\" he said. \"I want to  see it so much I can hardly wait. But I'm afraid there isn't time.\"    \"You MUST go and see your mother this afternoon?\" asked the Earl. \"You  think you can't put it off?\"    \"Why,\" said Fauntleroy, \"she has been thinking about me all the morning,  and I have been thinking about her!\"    \"Oh!\" said the Earl. \"You have, have you? Ring the bell.\"    As they drove down the avenue, under the arching trees, he was rather  silent. But Fauntleroy was not. He talked about the pony. What color was  it? How big was it? What was its name? What did it like to eat best? How  old was it? How early in the morning might he get up and see it?    \"Dearest will be so glad!\" he kept saying. \"She will be so much obliged  to you for being so kind to me! She knows I always liked ponies so much,  but we never thought I should have one. There was a little boy on Fifth  Avenue who had one, and he used to ride out every morning and we used to  take a walk past his house to see him.\"    He leaned back against the cushions and regarded the Earl with rapt  interest for a few minutes and in entire silence.    \"I think you must be the best person in the world,\" he burst forth at  last. \"You are always doing good, aren't you?--and thinking about other  people. Dearest says that is the best kind of goodness; not to think  about yourself, but to think about other people. That is just the way  you are, isn't it?\"    His lordship was so dumfounded to find himself presented in such  agreeable colors, that he did not know exactly what to say. He felt that  he needed time for reflection. To see each of his ugly, selfish motives  changed into a good and generous one by the simplicity of a child was a  singular experience.    Fauntleroy went on, still regarding him with admiring eyes--those great,  clear, innocent eyes!    \"You make so many people happy,\" he said. \"There's Michael and Bridget  and their ten children, and the apple-woman, and Dick, and Mr.  Hobbs, and Mr. Higgins and Mrs. Higgins and their children, and Mr.  Mordaunt,--because of course he was glad,--and Dearest and me, about  the pony and all the other things. Do you know, I've counted it up on  my fingers and in my mind, and it's twenty-seven people you've been kind  to. That's a good many--twenty-seven!\"    \"And I was the person who was kind to them--was I?\" said the Earl.    \"Why, yes, you know,\" answered Fauntleroy. \"You made them all happy.  Do you know,\" with some delicate hesitation, \"that people are sometimes  mistaken about earls when they don't know them. Mr. Hobbs was. I am  going to write him, and tell him about it.\"    \"What was Mr. Hobbs's opinion of earls?\" asked his lordship.    \"Well, you see, the difficulty was,\" replied his young companion,  \"that he didn't know any, and he'd only read about them in books. He  thought--you mustn't mind it--that they were gory tyrants; and he said  he wouldn't have them hanging around his store. But if he'd known YOU,  I'm sure he would have felt quite different. I shall tell him about  you.\"    \"What shall you tell him?\"    \"I shall tell him,\" said Fauntleroy, glowing with enthusiasm, \"that  you are the kindest man I ever heard of. And you are always thinking of  other people, and making them happy and--and I hope when I grow up, I  shall be just like you.\"    \"Just like me!\" repeated his lordship, looking at the little kindling  face.
