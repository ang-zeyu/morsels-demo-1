It blesses even the hand of  persecution itself, and returns good for evil. But the people against  whom you so justly declaim; are not _Christians_. They are  _infidels_. They are _monsters_. They are out of the common  course of nature. Their countrymen at home are generous and brave. They  support the sick, the lame, and the blind. They fly to the succour of  the distressed. They have noble and stately buildings for the sole  purpose of benevolence. They are in short, of all nations, the most  remarkable for humanity and justice.\"    \"But why then,\" replies the honest African, \"do they suffer this? Why is  Africa a scene of blood and desolation? Why are her children wrested  from her, to administer to the luxuries and greatness of those whom they  never offended? And why are these dismal cries in vain?\"    \"Alas!\" we reply again, \"can the cries and groans, with which the air  now trembles, be heard across this extensive continent? Can the southern  winds convey them to the ear of Britain? If they could reach the  generous Englishman at home, they would pierce his heart, as they have  already pierced your own. He would sympathize with you in your distress.  He would be enraged at the conduct of his countrymen, and resist their  tyranny.\"--    But here a shriek unusually loud, accompanied with a dreadful rattling  of chains, interrupted the discourse. The wretched Africans were just  about to embark: they had turned their face to their country, as if to  take a last adieu, and, with arms uplifted to the sky, were making the  very atmosphere resound with their prayers and imprecations.             *        *        *        *        *        CHAP. II.    The foregoing scene, though it may be said to be imaginary, is strictly  consistent with fact. It is a scene, to which the reader himself may  have been witness, if he has ever visited the place, where it is  supposed to lie; as no circumstance whatever has been inserted in it,  for which the fullest and most undeniable evidence cannot be produced.  We shall proceed now to describe, in general terms, the treatment which  the wretched Africans undergo, from the time of their embarkation.    When the African slaves, who are collected from various quarters, for  the purposes of sale, are delivered over to the _receivers_, they  are conducted in the manner above described to the ships. Their  situation on board is beyond all description: for here they are crouded,  hundreds of them together, into such a small compass, as would scarcely  be thought sufficient to accommodate twenty, if considered as _free  men_. This confinement soon produces an effect, that may be easily  imagined. It generates a pestilential air, which, co-operating with, bad  provisions, occasions such a sickness and mortality among them, that not  less than _twenty thousand_[056] are generally taken off in every  yearly transportation.    Thus confined in a pestilential prison, and almost entirely excluded  from the chearful face of day, it remains for the sickly survivors to  linger out a miserable existence, till the voyage is finished. But are  no farther evils to be expected in the interim particularly if we add to  their already wretched situation the indignities that are daily offered  them, and the regret which they must constantly feel, at being for ever  forced from their connexions? These evils are but too apparent. Some of  them have resolved, and, notwithstanding the threats of the  _receivers_, have carried their resolves into execution, to starve  themselves to death. Others, when they have been brought upon deck for  air, if the least opportunity has offered, have leaped into the sea, and  terminated their miseries at once. Others, in a fit of despair, have  attempted to rise, and regain their liberty. But here what a scene of  barbarity has constantly ensued. Some of them have been instantly killed  upon the spot; some have been taken from the hold, have been bruised and  mutilated in the most barbarous and shocking manner, and have been  returned bleeding to their companions, as a sad example of resistance;  while others, tied to the ropes of the ship, and mangled alternately  with the whip and knife, have been left in that horrid situation, till  they have expired.    But this is not the only inhuman treatment which they are frequently  obliged to undergo; for if there should be any necessity, from  tempestuous weather, for lightening the ship; or if it should be  presumed on the voyage, that the provisions will fall short before the  port can be made, they are, many of them, thrown into the sea, without  any compunction of mind on the part of the _receivers_, and without  any other regret for their loss, than that which _avarice_  inspires. Wretched survivors! what must be their feelings at such a  sight! how must they tremble to think of that servitude which is  approaching, when the very _dogs_ of the _receivers_ have been  retained on board, and preferred to their unoffending countrymen. But  indeed so lightly are these unhappy people esteemed, that their lives  have been even taken away upon speculation: there has been an instance,  within the last five years, of _one hundred and thirty two_ of them  being thrown into the sea, because it was supposed that, by this  _trick_, their value could be recovered from the insurers[057].    But if the ship should arrive safe at its destined port, a circumstance  which does not always happen, (for some have been blown up, and many  lost) the wretched Africans do not find an alleviation of their sorrow.  Here they are again exposed to sale. Here they are again subjected to  the inspection of other brutal _receivers_, who examine and treat  them with an inhumanity, at which even avarice should blush. To this  mortifying circumstance is added another, that they are picked out, as  the purchaser pleases, without any consideration whether the wife is  separated from her husband, or the mother from her son: and if these  cruel instances of separation should happen; if relations, when they  find themselves about to be parted, should cling together; or if filial,  conjugal, or parental affection, should detain them but a moment longer  in each other's arms, than these _second receivers_ should think  sufficient, the lash instantly severs them from their embraces.    We cannot close our account of the treatment, which the wretched  Africans undergo while in the hands of the _first receivers_,  without mentioning an instance of wanton, barbarity, which happened some  time ago; particularly as it may be inserted with propriety in the  present place, and may give the reader a better idea of the cruelties,  to which they are continually exposed, than any that he may have yet  conceived. To avoid making a mistake, we shall take the liberty that has  been allowed us, and transcribe it from a little manuscript account,  with which we have been favoured by a person of the strictest integrity,  and who was at that time in the place where the transaction  happened[058]. \"Not long after,\" says he, (continuing his account) \"the  perpetrator of a cruel murder, committed in open day light, in the most  publick part of a town, which was the seat of government, escaped every  other notice than the curses of a few of the more humane witnesses of  his barbarity. An officer of a Guinea ship, who had the care of a number  of new slaves, and was returning from the _sale-yard_ to the  vessel with such as remained unsold; observed a stout fellow among them  rather slow in his motions, which he therefore quickened with his  rattan. The slave soon afterwards fell down, and was raised by the same  application. Moving forwards a few yards, he fell down again; and this  being taken as a proof of his sullen perverse spirit, the enraged  officer furiously repeated his blows, till he expired at his feet. The  brute coolly ordered some of the surviving slaves to carry the dead body  to the water's side, where, without any ceremony or delay, being thrown  into the sea, the tragedy was supposed to have been immediately finished  by the not more inhuman sharks, with which the harbour then abounded.  These voracious fish were supposed to have followed the vessels from  the coast of Africa, in which ten thousand slaves were imported in that  one season, being allured by the stench, and daily fed by the dead  carcasses thrown overboard on the voyage.\"    If the reader should observe here, that cattle are better protected in  this country, than slaves in the colonies, his observation will be just.  The beast which is driven to market, is defended by law from the goad of  the driver; whereas the wretched African, though an human being, and  whose feelings receive of course a double poignancy from the power of  reflection, is unnoticed in this respect in the colonial code, and may  be goaded and beaten till he expires.    We may now take our leave of the _first receivers_. Their crime has  been already estimated; and to reason farther upon it, would be  unnecessary. For where the conduct of men is so manifestly impious,  there can be no need, either of a single argument or a reflection; as  every reader of sensibility will anticipate them in his own feelings.             *        *        *        *        *      FOOTNOTES      [Footnote 056: It is universally allowed, that at least one fifth of the  exported negroes perish in the passage. This estimate is made from the  time in which they are put on board, to the time when they are disposed  of in the colonies. The French are supposed to lose the greatest number  in the voyage, but particularly from this circumstance, because their  slave ships are in general so very large, that many of the slaves that  have been put on board sickly, die before the cargo can be completed.]      [Foo"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10633"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#18)"],[1,"quarter of the world.\"    The publication of these sentiments may be supposed to have produced an  extensive effect. For _The Moral Philosophy_ was adopted early by some  of the colleges in our universities into the system of their education.  It soon found its way also into most of the private libraries of the  kingdom; and it was, besides, generally read and approved. Dr. Paley,  therefore, must be considered, as having been a considerable coadjutor  in interesting the mind of the public in favour of the oppressed  Africans.    In the year 1783, we find Mr. Sharp coming again into notice. We find  him at this time taking a part in a cause, the knowledge of which, in  proportion as it was disseminated, produced an earnest desire among all  disinterested persons for the abolition of the Slave Trade.    In this year, certain underwriters desired to be heard against Gregson  and others of Liverpool, in the case of the ship Zong, Captain  Collingwood, alleging that the captain and officers of the said vessel  threw overboard one hundred and thirty-two slaves alive into the seas in  order to defraud them, by claiming the value of the said slaves, as if  they had been lost in a natural way. In the course of the trial which  afterwards came on, it appeared, that the slaves on board the Zong were  very sickly; that sixty of them had already died; and several were ill  and likely to die, when the captain proposed to James Kelsall, the mate,  and others, to throw several of them overboard, stating, \"that if they  died a natural death, the loss would fall upon the owners of the ship;  but that if they were thrown into the sea, it would fall upon the  underwriters.\" He selected, accordingly, one hundred and thirty-two of  the most sickly of the slaves. Fifty-four of these were immediately  thrown overboard, and forty-two were made to be partakers of their fate  on the succeeding day. In the course of three days afterwards the  remaining twenty-six were brought upon deck to complete the number of  victims. The first sixteen submitted to be thrown into the sea; but the  rest, with a noble resolution, would not suffer the officers to touch  them, but leaped after their companions and shared their fate.    The plea which was set up in behalf of this atrocious and unparalleled  act of wickedness was, that the captain discovered, when he made the  proposal, that he had only two hundred gallons of water on board, and  that he had missed his port. It was proved, however, in answer to this,  that no one had been put upon short allowance; and that, as if  Providence had determined to afford an unequivocal proof of the guilt, a  shower of rain fell and continued for three days immediately after the  second lot of slaves had been destroyed, by means of which they might  have filled many of their vessels[A] with water, and thus have prevented  all necessity for the destruction of the third.    [Footnote A: It appeared that they filled six.]    Mr. Sharp was present at this trial, and procured the attendance of a  short-hand writer to take down the facts, which should come out in the  course of it. These he gave to the public afterwards. He communicated  them also, with a copy of the trial, to the Lords of the Admiralty, as  the guardians of justice upon the seas, and to the Duke of Portland, as  principal minister of state. No notice, however, was taken by any of  these, of the information which had been thus sent them.    But though nothing was done by the persons then in power, in consequence  of the murder of so many innocent individuals, yet the publication of an  account of it by Mr. Sharp, in the newspapers, made such an impression  upon others, that; new coadjutors rose up. For, soon after this, we find  Thomas Day entering the lists again as the champion of the injured  Africans. He had lived to see his poem of _The Dying Negro_, which had  been published in 1773, make a considerable impression. In 1776, he had  written a letter to a friend in America, who was the possessor of  slaves, to dissuade him by a number of arguments from holding such  property; and now, when the knowledge of the case of the ship Zong was  spreading, he published that letter under the title of Fragment of an  Original Letter on the Slavery of the Negroes.    In this same year, Dr. Porteus, Bishop of Chester, but now Bishop of  London, came forward as a new advocate for the natives of Africa. The  way in which he rendered them service, was by preaching a sermon in  their behalf, before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Of  the wide circulation of this sermon, I shall say something in another  place, but much more of the enlightened and pious author of it, who from  this time never failed to aid, at every opportunity, the cause which he  had so ably undertaken.    In the year 1784, Dr. GREGORY produced his _Essays, Historical and  Moral_. He took an opportunity of disseminating in these a  circumstantial knowledge of the Slave Trade, and an equal abhorrence of  it at the same time. He explained the manner of procuring slaves in  Africa; the treatment of them on the passage, (in which he mentioned the  case of the ship Zong) and the wicked and cruel treatment of them in the  colonies. He recited and refuted also the various arguments adduced in  defence of the trade. He showed that it was destructive to our seamen.  He produced many weighty arguments also against the slavery itself. He  proposed clauses for an Act of Parliament for the abolition of both;  showing the good both to England and her colonies from such a measure,  and that a trade might be substituted in Africa, in various articles,  for that which he proposed to suppress. By means of the diffusion of  light like this, both of a moral and political nature; Dr. Gregory is  entitled to be ranked among the benefactors to the African race.    In the same year, Gilbert Wakefield preached a sermon at Richmond, in  Surrey, where, speaking of the people of this nation, he says, \"Have we  been as renowned for a liberal communication of our religion and our  laws as for the possession of them! Have we navigated and conquered to  save, to civilize, and to instruct; or to oppress, to plunder, and to  destroy? Let India and Africa give the answer to these questions. The  one we have exhausted of her wealth and her inhabitants by violence, by  famine, and by every species of tyranny and murder. The children of the  other we daily carry from off the land of their nativity; like sheep to  the slaughter, to return no more. We tear them from every object of  their affection, or, sad alternative, drag them together to the horrors  of a mutual servitude! We keep them in the profoundest ignorance. We  gall them in a tenfold chain, with an unrelenting spirit of barbarity,  inconceivable to all but the spectators of it, unexampled among former  and other nations, and unrecorded even in the bloody registers of  heathen persecution. Such is the conduct of us enlightened Englishmen,  reformed Christians! Thus have we profited by our superior advantages,  by the favour of God, by the doctrines and example of a meek and lowly  Savior. Will not the blessings which we have abused loudly testify  against us? Will not the blood which we have shed cry from the ground  for vengeance upon our sins?\"    In the same year, James Ramsay, vicar of Teston in Kent, became also an  able, zealous, and indefatigable patron of the African cause. This  gentleman had resided nineteen years in the island of St. Christopher,  where he had observed the treatment of the slaves, and had studied the  laws relating to them. On his return to England, yielding to his own  feelings of duty and the solicitations of some amiable friends, he  published a work, which he called _An Essay on the Treatment and  Conversion of the African Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies_. After  having given an account of the relative situation of master and slave in  various parts of the world, he explained the low and degrading situation  which the Africans held in society in our own islands. He showed that  their importance would be increased; and the temporal interest of their  masters promoted, by giving them freedom, and by granting them other  privileges. He showed the great difficulty of instructing them in the  state in which they then were, and such as he himself had experienced,  both in his private and public attempts, and such as others had  experienced also. He stated the way in which private attempts of this  nature might probably be successful. He then answered all objections  against their capacities, as drawn from philosophy, form, anatomy, and  observation; and vindicated these from his own experience. And lastly,  he threw out ideas for the improvement of their condition, by an  establishment of a greater number of spiritual pastors among them; by  giving them more privileges than they then possessed; and by extending  towards them the benefits of a proper police. Mr. Ramsay had no other  motive for giving this work to the public, than that of humanity, of a  wish to serve this much-injured part of the human species. For he  compiled it at the hazard of forfeiting that friendship, which he had  contracted with many during his residence in the islands, and of  suffering much in his private property, as well as subjecting himself to  the ill-will and persecution of numerous individuals.    The publication of this book by one who professed to have been so long  resident in the islands, and to have been an eyewitness of facts,  produced, as may easily be supposed, a good deal of conversation, and  made a considerable impression, but particularly at this time, when a  storm was visibly gathering over the heads of the oppressors of the  African race. These circumstances occasioned one or two persons to  attempt to answer it, and these answers brought Mr. Ramsay into the  first controversy ever entered into on this subject, during which,"]]]
