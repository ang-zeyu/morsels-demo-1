See the note on _vídissent_, 36, 15.    14. sibi vítam adimeret, 'take her life.' The dative of reference is thus  used after some compound verbs to name the person from whom a thing is  taken. This construction is sometimes called the dative of separation.    15. timóre perterritam. See the note on 14, 11.    20. eí pedés, 'his feet.' See the note on 44, 10.    21. imperásset, contracted from _imperávisset_.    22. in átrium. See the note on 7, 3.    26. sunt, goes with reductí.    29. reliquís Graecís, indirect object of díceret.    30. Circaeam. Notice that this use of the adjective instead of the  genitive often cannot be imitated in the English rendering, but must be  translated by the possessive case or a prepositional phrase.    61. 8. eí persuásum sit, 'he was persuaded.' See the note on 60, 11. The  clause ut ... manéret is the subject of persuásum sit; if the latter were  active, the clause would be its object. For the tense of persuásum sit  see the note on 19, 22.    10. cónsúmpserat. See the note on 14, 3.    patriae, objective genitive, to be rendered, as often, with 'for.'    15. úsuí. See the note on 34, 20.    23. antequam perveníret. We say 'before he could come.' See the note on  _possent_, 27, 20.    24. hóc locó. See the note on 24, 2.    longum est. We say '_would_ be tedious' or '_would_ take too long.'

In ancient times, there stood on this hill a temple dedicated to  Mars, whence the name _Mons Martis_, of which has been made  _Montmartre_. At the foot of it, was the _Campus Martius_, or _Champ  de Mars_, where the French kings of the first race caused their  throne to be erected every year on the first of May. They came hither  in a car, decorated with green boughs and flowers, and drawn by four  oxen. Such, indeed, was the town-equipage of king DAGOBERT.      \"Quatre boeufs attelés, d'un pas tranquil et lent,    Promenaient dans Paris le monarque indolent.\"    Having seated themselves on the throne, they gave a public audience  to the people, at the same time giving and receiving presents, which  were called _estrennes_. Hence annual presents were afterwards termed  _étrennes_, and this gave rise to the custom of making them.    On this hill too fell the head of [Greek: Dionusios] or _St. Denis_;  and in latter times, this was the spot chosen by the Marshal DE  BROGLIE, who commanded the thirty-five thousand troops by which the  French capital was surrounded in May 1789, for checking the spirit of  the turbulent Parisians, by battering their houses' about their ears,  and burying them under the ruins.    On the summit of _Montmartre_, is a circular terrace, in the centre  of which stands a windmill, and not far from it, are several others.  Round its brow are several _maisonettes_, or little country boxes,  and also some public gardens with bowers, where lovers often regale  their mistresses. Hence you command a full view of the city of Paris.  You behold roof rising above roof; and the churches towering above  the houses have, at this distance, somewhat the appearance of lofty  chimnies. You look down on the capital as far as the Seine, by which  it is intersected: beyond that river, the surface of the land rises  again in the form of an amphitheatre. On all sides, the prospect is  bounded by eminences of various degrees of elevation, over which, as  well as over the plains, and along the banks of the river, are  scattered villas, windmills, country-seats, hamlets, villages, and  coppices; but, from want of enclosures, the circumjacent country has  not that rich and variegated aspect which delights the eye in our  English rural scenery. This was always one of my favourite walks  during my residence in Paris before the revolution; and I doubt not,  when you visit the French capital, that you will have the curiosity  to scale the heights of _Montmartre_.    As to the theatres, concerning which you interrogate me, I shall  defer entering into any particular detail of them, till I have made  myself fully acquainted with the attractions of each: this mode of  proceeding will not occasion any material delay, as I generally visit  one of them every evening, but always endeavour to go to that house  where the _best_ performers are to be seen, in their _best_  characters, and in the _best_ pieces. I mention this, in order that  you may not think me inattentive to your request, by having hitherto  omitted to point out to you the difference between the theatrical  amusements here under the monarchy, and those of the republic.    The _thèâtre des arts_ or grand French opera, the _opera buffa_ or  Italian comic opera, the _théâtre Feydeau_ or French comic opera, and  the _théâtre Français_, chiefly engage my attention. Yesterday  evening I went to the last-mentioned theatre purposely to see  Mademoiselle CONTAT, who played in both pieces. The first was _Les  Femmes Savantes_, a comedy, in which Molière, wishing to aim a blow  at female pedantry, has, perhaps, checked, in some French women, a  desire for improvement; the second was _La fausse Agnès_, a laughable  afterpiece. Notwithstanding the enormous _embonpoint_ which this  celebrated comic actress has acquired since I saw her last on the  Parisian stage upwards of ten years ago, she acquitted herself with  her accustomed excellence. I happened to sit next to a very warm  admirer of her superior talents, who told me that, bulky as she was  become, he had been highly gratified in seeing her perform at _Rouen_  not long since, in her favourite character of _Roxalane_, in _Les  Trois Sultanes_. \"She was much applauded, no doubt.\" observed I.  --\"Not at all,\" replied he, \"for the crowd was so great, that in no  part of the house was it possible for a man to use his hands.\"        LETTER X.    _Paris, November 2, 1801._    On reaching Paris, every person, whether Jew or Gentile, foreigner or  not, coming from any department of the republic, except that of _La  Seine_, in which the capital is situated, is now bound to make his  appearance at the _Préfecture de Police_.    The new-comer, accompanied by two housekeepers, first repairs to the  Police-office of the _arrondissement_, or district, in which he has  taken up his residence, where he delivers his travelling passport; in  lieu of which he receives a sort of certificate, and then he shews  himself at the _Préfecture de Police_, or General Police-office, at  present established in the _Cité_.    Here, his name and quality, together with a minute description of his  person and his place of abode, are inserted in a register kept for  that purpose, to which he puts his signature; and a printed paper,  commonly called a _permis de séjour_, is given to him, containing a  duplicate of all these matters, filled up in the blanks, which he  also signs himself. It is intended that he should always carry this  paper about him, in order that he may produce it when called on, or,  in case of necessity, for verifying his person, on any particular  occasion, such as passing by a guard-house on foot after eleven  o'clock at night, or being unexpectedly involved in any affray. In a  word, it answers to a stranger the same end as a _carte de sureté_,  or ticket of safety, does to an inhabitant of Paris.    I accordingly went through this indispensable ceremony in due form on  my arrival here; but, having neglected to read a _nota bene_ in the  margin of the _permis de séjour_, I had not been ten hours in my new  apartments before I received a visit from an Inspector of Police of  the _arrondissement_, who, very civilly reminding me of the omission,  told me that I need not give myself the trouble of going to the  Central Police-office, as he would report my removal. However, being  determined to be strictly _en règle_, I went thither myself to cause  my new residence to be inserted in the paper.    I should not have dwelt on the circumstance, were it not to shew you  the precision observed in the administration of the police of this  great city.    Under the old _régime_, every master of a ready-furnished hotel was  obliged to keep a register, in which he inserted the name and quality  of his lodgers for the inspection of the police-officers whenever  they came: this regulation is not only strictly adhered to at  present; but every person in Paris, who receives a stranger under his  roof as an inmate, is bound, under penalty of a fine, to report him  to the police, which is most vigilantly administered by Citizen  FOUCHÉ.    Last night, not being in time to find good places at the _Théâtre des  Arts_, or Grand French Opera, I went to the _Théâtre Louvois_, which  is within a few paces of it, in hopes of being more successful. I  shall not at present attempt to describe the house, as, from my  arriving late, I was too ill accommodated to be able to view it to  advantage.    However, I was well seated for seeing the performance. It consisted  of three _petites pièces_: namely, _Une heure d'absence_, _La petite  ville_, and _Le café d'une petite ville_. The first was entertaining;  but the second much more so; and though the third cannot claim the  merit of being well put together, I shall say a few words of it, as  it is a production _in honour of peace_, and on that score alone,  would, at this juncture, deserve notice.    After a few scenes somewhat languid, interspersed with common-place,  and speeches of no great humour, a _dénouement_, by no means  interesting, promised not to compensate the audience for their  patience. But the author of the _Café d'une petite ville_, having  eased himself of this burden, revealed his motive, and took them on  their weak side, by making a strong appeal to French enthusiasm. This  cord being adroitly struck, his warmth became communicative, and  animating the actors, good humor did the rest. The accessories were  infinitely more interesting than the main subject. An allemande,  gracefully danced by two damsels and a hero, in the character of a  French hussar, returned home from the fatigues of war and battle, was  much applauded; and a Gascoon poet, who declares that, for once in  his life, he is resolved to speak truth, was loudly encored in the  following couplets, adapted to the well-known air of _\"Gai, le coeur  à la danse.\"_      \"Celui qui nous donne la paix,    Comme il fit bien la guerre!    Sur lui déjà force conplets....    Mai il en reste à faire:    Au diable nous nous donnions,    Il revient, nous respirons....    Il fait changer la danse;      Par lui chez nous plus de discord;    Il regle la cadence,    Et nous voilà d'accord.\"    True it is, that BONAPARTE, as principal ballet-master, has changed  the dance of the whole nation; he regulates their step to the measure  of his own music, and _discord_ is mute at the moment: but the  question is, whether the French are bona-fide _d'accord_, (as the  Gascoon affirms,) that is, perfectly reconciled to the new tune and  figure? Let us, however, keep out of this maze; were we to enter it,  we might remain bewildered there, perhaps, till old Father Time came  to extricate us.    The"]]]
