McTee's a hard man, but when Scot meets Scot--I'll bet on the  Campbells.\"    \"Would you bet on me against Black McTee?\" queried the engineer, deeply  moved. \"Well, lad, McTee's a dour man, but dour or not he shall not run  the engine room of the _Heron_.\"    And he banged on the table for emphasis.    \"Scrub down the bridge every morning, as they tell you, but when they  send you below to pass the coal, come and report to me first. I'll have  work for you to do--chiefly practicing the right accent for Bobbie's  songs. Is not that a man's work?\"          CHAPTER 19      To make good this promise, Campbell straightway sang for Harrigan's  delectation two or three more of his favorite selections. It was  evening, and the shift in the fireroom was ended before Harrigan left  the engineer's room. On his way to the deck he passed the tired firemen  from the hole of the ship. They stared at the Irishman with wide eyes,  for it was known that he had been in the chief engineer's room for  several hours; they looked upon him as one who has been in hell and has  escaped from thence to the upper air.    He was, in fact, a marked man when he reached the forecastle. Rumor  travels through a ship's crew and it was already known that Black McTee  hated the Irishman and that White Henshaw had commenced to persecute  him in a new and terrible manner.    This would have been sufficient tragedy to burden the shoulders of any  one man, however strong, and when to this was added the fact that he  had been kept by the grim chief engineer for several hours in the  chief's own room, and finally considering that this man had passed  through a shipwreck, one of three lone survivors, it is easy to  understand why the sailors gave him ample elbow room.    It was evidently expected that he would break out into a torrent of  abuse, and when he, perceiving this, remained silent, their awe  increased. All through supper he was aware of their wondering glances;  above all he felt the gray, steady eyes of Jerry Hovey, the bos'n, yet  he ate without speaking, replying to their tentative questions with  grunts. Before the meal was finished and the pipes and cigarettes  lighted, he was a made man. Persevering in his role, as soon as he had  eaten he went out on deck and sat down in the corner between the rail  and the forecastle upon a coil of rope.    As deep as the blue sea in the evening light was the peace which lay on  the soul of Harrigan, for the day had brought two great victories, one  over McTee and the other over the chief engineer. It was not a stolid  content, for he knew the danger of the implacable hate of McTee, but  with the aid of Campbell he felt that he would have a fighting chance  at least to survive, and that was all he asked.    So he sat on the coil of rope leaning against the rail, and looked  ahead. It was almost completely dark when a hand fell on his shoulder  and he looked up into the steady, gray-blue eyes of the bos'n.    \"I promised to talk to you tonight,\" said that worthy, and sat down  uninvited on a neighboring coil of rope.    He waited for a response. As a rule, sailors are glad to curry favor  with the bos'n. Harrigan, however, sat without speaking, staring  through the gloom.    \"Well?\" said Hovey at length. \"You're a silent man, Harrigan.\"    There was no response.    \"All right; I like a silent man. In a way of speakin', I need 'em like  you! If you say little to me, you're likely to say little to others.    \"I don't talk much myself,\" went on Hovey, \"until I know my man. I  ain't seen much of you, but I guess I figure you straight.\"    He grew suddenly cautious, cunning, and the steady, gray-blue eyes  reminded Harrigan of a cat when she crouches for hours watching the  rathole.    \"You ain't got much reason for standing in with White Henshaw?\" he  purred.    \"H'm,\" grunted the Irishman, and waited.    \"Sure, you ain't,\" went on Hovey soothingly, \"because McTee has raised  hell between you. They say McTee tried his damnedest to break you?\"    The last question was put in a different manner; it came suddenly like  a surprise blow in the dark.    \"Well?\" queried Harrigan. \"What of it?\"    \"He tried all the way from Honolulu?\"    \"He did.\"    \"Did he try his fists?\"    \"He did.\"    Jerry Hovey cursed with excitement.    \"And?\"    \"I carried him to his cabin afterward,\" said Harrigan truthfully.    \"Would you take on McTee again? Black McTee?\"    \"If I had to. Why?\"    \"Oh, nothin'. But McTee has started White Henshaw on your trail. Maybe  you know what Henshaw is? The whole South Seas know him!\"    \"Well?\"    \"You'll have a sweet hell of a time before this boat touches port,  Harrigan.\"    \"I'll weather it.\"    \"Yes, this trip, but what about the next? If Henshaw is breakin' a man,  he keeps him on the ship till the man gives in or dies. I know!  Henshaw'll get so much against you that he could soak you for ten years  in the courts by the time we touch port. Then he'll offer to let you  off from the courts if you'll ship with him again, and then the old  game will start all over again. You may last one trip--other men  have--one or two--but no one has ever lasted out three or four  shippings under White Henshaw. It can't be done!\"    He paused to let this vital point sink home. Only the same dull silence  came in reply, and this continued taciturnity seemed to irritate Hovey.  When he spoke again, his voice was cold and sharp.    \"He's got you trapped, Harrigan. You're a strong man, but you'll never  get his rope off your neck. He'll either hang you with it or else tie  you hand and foot an' make you his slave. I _know!_\"    There was a bitter emphasis on the last word that left no doubt as to  his meaning, and Harrigan understood now the light of that steady,  gray-blue eye which made the habitual smile of good nature meaningless.    \"Ten years ago I shipped with White Henshaw. Ten years ago I didn't  have a crooked thought or a mean one in my brain. Today there's hell  inside me, understand? Hell!\" He paused, breathing hard.    \"There's others on this ship that have been through the same grind,  some of them longer than me. There's others that ain't here, but that  ain't forgotten, because me an' some of the rest, we seen them dyin' on  their feet. Maybe they ain't dropped into the sea, but they're just the  same, or worse. You'll find 'em loafin' along the beaches. They take  water from the natives, they do.\"    He went on in a hoarse whisper: \"On this ship I've seen 'em busted. An'  Henshaw has done the bustin'. This is a coffin ship, Harrigan, an'  Henshaw he's the undertaker. He don't bring 'em to Davy Jones's  locker--he does worse--he brings 'em to hell on earth, a hell so bad  that when they go below, they don't notice no difference. Harrigan, me  an' a few of the rest, we know what's been done, an' some of us have  thought wouldn't it be a sort of joke, maybe, if sometime what Henshaw  has done to others was done to himself, what?\"    The sweat was standing out on Harrigan's face wet and cold. It seemed  to him that through the darkness he could make out whole troops of  those broken men littering the decks. He peered through the dark at the  bos'n, and made out the hint of the gray-blue eyes watching him again  as the cat watches the mousehole, and the heart of Harrigan ached.    \"Hovey, are you bound for the loincloth an' the beaches, like the  rest?\"    \"No, because I've sold my soul to White Henshaw; but you're bound  there, Harrigan, because you can never sell your soul. I looked in your  eyes and seen it written there like it was in a book.\"    He gripped the Irishman by the shoulder.    \"There's some say this is the last voyage of White Henshaw, but me an'  some of the rest, we know different. He can't leave the sea, which  means that he won't take us out of hell. Now, talk straight. You stood  up to McTee; would you stand up to Henshaw?\"    Harrigan muttered after a moment of thought: \"I suppose this is mutiny,  bos'n?\"    \"Aye, but I'm safe in talkin' it. White Henshaw trusts me, he does,  because I've sold my soul to him. If you was to go an' tell him what  I've said, he'd laugh at you an' say you was tryin' to incite  discontent. What's it goin' to be, Harrigan? Will you join me an' the  rest who can set you free an' make a man of you, or will you stay by  McTee and White Henshaw and that devil Campbell?\"    \"How could you set me free?\"    \"One move--altogether--in the night--we'd have the ship for our own,  an' we could beach her and take to the shore at any place we pleased.\"    Harrigan repeated: \"One move--altogether--in the night! I don't like  it, bos'n. I'll stand up to my man foot to foot an' hand to hand, but  for strikin' at him in the dark--I can't do it.\"    He caught the sound of Hovey's gritting teeth.    \"Think it over,\" persisted the bos'n. \"We need you, Harrigan, but if  you don't join, we'll help McTee and Henshaw and Campbell to make life  hell for you.\"    \"I've thought it over. I don't like the game. This mutiny at  night--it's like hittin' a man who's down.\"    \"That's final?\"    \"It is.\"    \"Then God help you, Harrigan, for you ain't the man I took you for.\"          CHAPTER 20      He rose and left Harrigan to the dark, which now lay so thick over the  sea that he could only dimly make out the black, wallowing length of  the ship. After a time, he went into the dingy forecastle and stretched  out on his bunk. Some of the sailors were already in bed, propping  their heads up with brawny, tattooed arms while they smoked their  pipes. For a time Harrigan pondered the mutiny, glancing at the stolid  faces of the smokers and trying to picture them in action when they  would steal through the night barefooted across the deck--some of them  with bludgeons, others with knives, and all with a thirst for murder.    Sleep began to overcome him, and he fought vainly against it. In a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#17)"],[1," the laws of their country, because the soul was immortal, and an  eternal enjoyment of happiness did await such as died on that account;  while the mean-spirited, and those that were not wise enough to show a  right love of their souls, preferred death by disease to that which is a  sign of virtue.\" The sentiments here are not so objectionable, but the  description of the Pharisees as sophists, and the suggestion of a  Valhalla for those who died for their country and for no others--for  which there is no authority in Jewish tradition--betray again the  uncritical copying of a Hellenistic source.    Finally, in summing up the character of Herod, all he finds to say is,  \"Above all other men he enjoyed the favor of fortune, since from a  private station he obtained a kingdom, and held it many years, and left  it to his sons; but yet in his domestic affairs he was a most  unfortunate man.\" Not a word of his wickedness and cruelty, not a breath  of the Hebrew spirit, but simply an estimate of his \"fortune.\" This is  the way in which the Romanized Jew continued the historical record of  the Bible, substituting foreign superstitions about fate and fortune for  the Jewish idea that all human history is a manifestation of God.    Josephus ends the first book of the _Wars_ with an account of the  gorgeous pomp of Herod's funeral, and starts the second book with a  description of the costly funeral feast which his son Archelaus gave to  the multitude, adding a note--presumably also derived from Nicholas--  that many of the Jews ruin themselves owing to the need of giving such a  feast, because he who omits it is not esteemed pious. As his source  fails him for the period following on the banishment of Archelaus, the  treatment becomes fragmentary, but at the same time more original and  independent. An account of the various Jewish sects interrupts the  chronicle of the court intrigues and popular risings. Josephus  distinguishes here four sects, the Essenes, the Pharisees, the  Sadducees, and the Zealots, but his account is mainly confined to the  first.[1] He describes in some detail their practices, beliefs, and  organizations. Indeed, this passage and the account in Philo are our  chief Jewish authorities for the tenets of the Essenes. He is anxious to  establish their claim to be a philosophical community comparable with  the Greek schools. In particular he represents that their notions of  immortality correspond with the Greek ideas of the Isles of the Blessed  and of Hades. \"The divine doctrines of the Essenes, as he calls them,  which consider the body as corruptible and the soul an immortal spirit,  which, when released from the bonds of the flesh as from a long slavery,  rejoices and mounts upwards, lay an irresistible bait for such as have  once tasted of their philosophy.\" The ideas which the sect cherished  were popular in a certain part of Greco-Roman society, which, sated with  the luxury of the age, turned to the ascetic life and to the pursuit of  mysticism. Pliny the Elder, who was on the staff of Titus at Jerusalem,  appears to have been especially interested in the Jewish communists, and  briefly described their doctrines in his books; and the circle for whom  Josephus wrote would have been glad to have a fuller account.    [Footnote 1: B. J. II. viii.]    Of the other two sects he says little here, and what he says is  superficial. He places the differentiation in their contrasted doctrines  of fate and immortality. The Pharisees ascribe all to fate, but yet  allow freewill--a Hellenizing version of the saying ascribed to Rabbi  Akiba, \"All is foreseen, but freedom of will is given\"[1]--and they say  all souls are immortal, but those of the good only pass into other  bodies, while those of the bad suffer eternal punishment. This  attribution of the doctrine of metempsychosis and eternal punishment is  another piece of Hellenization, or a reproduction of a Hellenistic  misunderstanding; for the Rabbinic records nowhere suggest that such  ideas were held by the Pharisees. \"The Sadducees, on the other hand,  deny fate entirely, and hold that God is not concerned in man's conduct,  which is entirely in his own choice, and they likewise deny the  immortality of the soul or retribution after death.\" Here the attempt to  represent the Sadducees' position as parallel with Epicurean materialism  has probably induced an overstatement of their distrust of Providence.  Josephus adds that the Pharisees cultivate great friendships among  themselves and promote peace among the people; while the Sadducees are  somewhat gruff towards each other, and treat even members of their own  party as if they were strangers.    [Footnote 1: Comp. Abot, iii. 15.]    Of the fourth party, the Zealots, Josephus has only a few words, to the  effect that when Coponius was sent as the first procurator of Judea, a  Galilean named Judas prevailed on his countrymen to revolt, saying they  would be cowards if they would endure to pay any tax to the Romans or  submit to any mortal lord in place of God. This man, he says, was the  teacher of a peculiar sect of his own. While the other three sects are  treated as philosophical schools, Josephus does not attribute a  philosophy to the Zealots, and out of regard to Roman feelings he says  nothing of the Messianic hopes that dominated them.    After the digression about the sects, Josephus continues his narrative  of the Jewish relations with the Romans. He turns aside now and then to  detail the complicated family affairs of the Herodian family or to  describe some remarkable geographical phenomenon, such as the glassy  sands of the Ladder of Tyre.[1] The main theme is the growing irritation  of the Jews, and the strengthening of the feeling that led to the  outbreak of the great war. But Josephus, always under the spell of the  Romans, or writing with a desire to appeal to them, can recognize only  material, concrete causes. The deeper spiritual motives of the struggle  escape him altogether, as they escaped the Roman procurators. He  recounts the wanton insults of a Pontius Pilate, who brought into  Jerusalem Roman ensigns with the image of Caesar, and spoiled the sacred  treasures of the Korban for the purpose of building aqueducts; and he  dwells on the attempt of Gaius to set up his statue in the Temple, which  was frustrated only by the Emperor's murder. But about the attitude of  the different sections of the Jewish people to the Romans, of which his  record would have been so valuable, he is silent.    [Footnote 1: B.J. II. x. 2. The same phenomenon is recorded in Pliny and  Tacitus, and it was a commonplace of the geography of the age.]    After the brief interlude of Agrippa's happy reign, the irritation of  Roman procurators is renewed, and under Comanus tumult follows tumult,  as one outrage after another upon the Jewish feeling is countenanced or  abetted. The courtier of the Flavian house takes occasion to recount the  Emperor Nero's misdeeds and family murders; but he resists the desire to  treat in detail of these things, because his subject is Jewish  history.[1] He must have had before him a source which dealt with  general Roman history more fully, and he shows his independence, such as  it is, in confining his narrative to the Jewish story. But the reliance  on his source for his point of view leads him to write as a good Roman;  the national party are dubbed rebels and revolutionaries ([Greek:  stasiastai]). The Zealots are regularly termed robbers, and the origin  of war is attributed to the weakness of the governors in not putting  down these turbulent elements. All this was natural enough in a Roman,  but it comes strangely from the pen of a soi-disant Jewish apologist,  who had himself taken a part in the rebellion. Characteristic is his  account of the turbulent condition of Palestine in the time of Felix:    \"Bands of Sicarii springing up in the chaos caused by the tyranny  infested the country, and another body of abandoned men, less villainous  in their actions, but more wicked in their designs, deluded the people  under pretense of divine inspiration, and persuaded them to rise. Felix  put down these bands, but, as with a diseased body, straightway the  inflammation burst out in another part. And the flame of revolt was  blown up every day more and more, till it came to a regular war.\"[2]    [Footnote 1: B.J. II. xiii. 1.]    [Footnote 2: B.J. II. xiii. 6.]    Josephus vents his full power of denunciation on the last procurator,  Floras, who goaded the people into war, and by his repeated outrages  compelled even the aristocratic party, to which the historian belonged,  to break their loyalty to Rome: \"As though he had been sent as  executioner to punish condemned criminals, he omitted no sort of  spoliation or extortion. In the most pitiful cases he was most inhuman;  in the greatest turpitudes he was most impudent, nor could anyone outdo  him in perversion of the truth, or combine more subtle ways of deceit.\"  Josephus, not altogether consistently with what he has already said,  seeks to exculpate his countrymen for their rising, up to the point in  which he himself was involved in it; and though he admits that the high  priests and leading men were still anxious for peace at any price, and  he puts a long speech into Agrippa's mouth counseling submission, he is  yet anxious to show that his people were driven into war by the  wickedness of Nero's governors. His masters allowed him, and probably  invited him, to denounce the oppression of the ministers of their  predecessors, and the Roman historians Suetonius and Tacitus likewise  state that the rapacity of the procurators drove the Jews into revolt.  He had authority, therefore, for this view in his contemporary sources.    The die was cast. Menahem, the son of Judas the Galilean and the head of  the Zealots, seized Jerusalem, drove the Romans and Romanizers into the  fortress of Antonia, and having armed "]]]
