'Of course, I am loving the life here. I think America's  wonderful, and nobody could be kinder than Lady Wetherby. But--I  miss my home. It's the first time I have been away for so long. I  feel very far away sometimes. There are only three of us at home:  my mother, myself, and my little brother--little Percy.'    Her voice trembled again as she spoke the last two words, and it  was possibly this that caused Mr Pickering to visualize Percy as a  sort of little Lord Fauntleroy, his favourite character in English  literature. He had a vision of a small, delicate, wistful child  pining away for his absent sister. Consumptive probably. Or  curvature of the spine.    He found Claire's hand in his. He supposed dully he must have  reached out for it. Soft and warm it lay there, while the universe  paused breathlessly. And then from the semi-darkness beside him  there came the sound of a stifled sob, and his fingers closed as  if someone had touched a button.    'We have always been such chums. He is only ten--such a dear boy!  He must be missing me--'    She stopped, and simultaneously Dudley Pickering began to speak.    There is this to be said for your shy, cautious man, that on the  rare occasions when he does tap the vein of eloquence that vein  becomes a geyser. It was as if after years of silence and  monosyllables Dudley Pickering was endeavouring to restore the  average.    He began by touching on his alleged neglect and avoidance of  Claire. He called himself names and more names. He plumbed the  depth of repentance and remorse. Proceeding from this, he  eulogized her courage, the pluck with which she presented a  smiling face to the world while tortured inwardly by separation  from her little brother Percy. He then turned to his own feelings.    But there are some things which the historian should hold sacred,  some things which he should look on as proscribed material for his  pen, and the actual words of a stout manufacturer of automobiles  proposing marriage in the moonlight fall into this class. It is  enough to say that Dudley Pickering was definite. He left no room  for doubt as to his meaning.    'Dudley!'    She was in his arms. He was embracing her. She was his--the latest  model, self-starting, with limousine body and all the newest. No,  no, his mind was wandering. She was his, this divine girl, this  queen among women, this--    From the drawing-room Roscoe Sherriff's voice floated out in  unconscious comment--        Good-bye, boys!        I'm going to be married to-morrow.      Good-bye, boys!        I'm going from sunshine to sorrow.      No more sitting up till broad daylight.    Did a momentary chill cool the intensity of Dudley Pickering's  ardour? If so he overcame it instantly. He despised Roscoe  Sherriff. He flattered himself that he had shown Roscoe Sherriff  pretty well who was who and what was what.    They would have a wonderful wedding--dozens of clergymen, scores  of organs playing 'The Voice that Breathed o'er Eden,' platoons of  bridesmaids, wagonloads of cake. And then they would go back to  Detroit and live happy ever after. And it might be that in time to  come there would be given to them little runabouts.        I'm going to a life      Of misery and strife,      So good-bye, boys!    Hang Roscoe Sherriff! What did he know about it! Confound him!  Dudley Pickering turned a deaf ear to the song and wallowed in his  happiness.    Claire walked slowly down the moonlit drive. She had removed  herself from her Dudley's embraces, for she wished to be alone, to  think. The engagement had been announced. All that part of it was  over--Dudley's stammering speech, the unrestrained delight of  Polly Wetherby, the facetious rendering of 'The Wedding Glide' on  the piano by Roscoe Sherriff, and it now remained for her to try  to discover a way of conveying the news to Bill.    It had just struck her that, though she knew that Bill was in  America, she had not his address.    What was she to do? She must tell him. Otherwise it might quite  easily happen that they might meet in New York when she returned  there. She pictured the scene. She saw herself walking with Dudley  Pickering. Along came Bill. 'Claire, darling!' ... Heavens, what  would Dudley think? It would be too awful! She couldn't explain.  No, somehow or other, even if she put detectives on his trail, she  must find him, and be off with the old love now that she was on  with the new.    She reached the gate and leaned over it. And as she did so someone  in the shadow of a tall tree spoke her name. A man came into the  light, and she saw that it was Lord Dawlish.          11      Lord Dawlish had gone for a moonlight walk that night because,  like Claire, he wished to be alone to think. He had fallen with a  pleasant ease and smoothness into the rather curious life lived at  Elizabeth Boyd's bee-farm. A liking for picnics had lingered in  him from boyhood, and existence at Flack's was one prolonged  picnic. He found that he had a natural aptitude for the more  muscular domestic duties, and his energy in this direction  enchanted Nutty, who before his advent had had a monopoly of these  tasks.    Nor was this the only aspect of the situation that pleased Nutty.  When he had invited Bill to the farm he had had a vague hope that  good might come of it, but he had never dreamed that things would  turn out as well as they promised to do, or that such a warm and  immediate friendship would spring up between his sister and the  man who had diverted the family fortune into his own pocket. Bill  and Elizabeth were getting on splendidly. They were together all  the time--walking, golfing, attending to the numerous needs of the  bees, or sitting on the porch. Nutty's imagination began to run  away with him. He seemed to smell the scent of orange-blossoms, to  hear the joyous pealing of church bells--in fact, with the  difference that it was not his own wedding that he was anticipating,  he had begun to take very much the same view of the future that was  about to come to Dudley Pickering.    Elizabeth would have been startled and embarrassed if she could  have read his thoughts, for they might have suggested to her that  she was becoming a great deal fonder of Bill than the shortness of  their acquaintance warranted. But though she did not fail to  observe the strangeness of her brother's manner, she traced it to  another source than the real one. Nutty had a habit of starting  back and removing himself when, entering the porch, he perceived  that Bill and his sister were already seated there. His own  impression on such occasions was that he was behaving with  consummate tact. Elizabeth supposed that he had had some sort of a  spasm.    Lord Dawlish, if he had been able to diagnose correctly the almost  paternal attitude which had become his host's normal manner these  days, would have been equally embarrassed but less startled, for  conscience had already suggested to him from time to time that he  had been guilty of a feeling toward Elizabeth warmer than any  feeling that should come to an engaged man. Lying in bed at the  end of his first week at the farm, he reviewed the progress of his  friendship with her, and was amazed at the rapidity with which it  had grown.    He could not conceal it from himself--Elizabeth appealed to him.  Being built on a large scale himself, he had always been attracted  by small women. There was a smallness, a daintiness, a liveliness  about Elizabeth that was almost irresistible. She was so capable,  so cheerful in spite of the fact that she was having a hard time.  And then their minds seemed to blend so remarkably. There were no  odd corners to be smoothed away. Never in his life had he felt so  supremely at his ease with one of the opposite sex. He loved  Claire--he drove that fact home almost angrily to himself--but he  was forced to admit that he had always been aware of something in  the nature of a barrier between them. Claire was querulous at  times, and always a little too apt to take offence. He had never  been able to talk to her with that easy freedom that Elizabeth  invited. Talking to Elizabeth was like talking to an attractive  version of oneself. It was a thing to be done with perfect  confidence, without any of that apprehension which Claire inspired  lest the next remark might prove the spark to cause an explosion.  But Claire was the girl he loved--there must be no mistake about  that.    He came to the conclusion that the key to the situation was the  fact that Elizabeth was American. He had read so much of the  American girl, her unaffectedness, her genius for easy comradeship.  Well, this must be what the writer fellows meant. He had happened  upon one of those delightful friendships without any suspicion of  sex in them of which the American girl had the monopoly. Yes, that  must be it. It was a comforting explanation. It accounted for his  feeling at a loose end whenever he was away from Elizabeth for as  much as half an hour. It accounted for the fact that they understood  each other so well. It accounted for everything so satisfactorily  that he was able to get to sleep that night after all.    But next morning--for his conscience was one of those persistent  consciences--he began to have doubts again. Nothing clings like a  suspicion in the mind of a conscientious young man that he has  been allowing his heart to stray from its proper anchorage.    Could it be that he was behaving badly toward Claire? The thought  was unpleasant, but he could not get rid of it. He extracted  Claire's photograph from his suit-case and gazed solemnly upon it.    At first he was shocked to find that it only succeeded in  convincing him that Elizabeth was quite the most attractive girl  he ever had met. The photographer had given Claire rather a severe  look. He had told her to moisten the lips"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6687"],[0,"From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan (#17)"],[1," they are the completest and most  trustworthy of the records of the peoples of antiquity. They date from  1,000 to 2,200 years B.C., and their authenticity may often be proved  by reference to Greek authors. After long and careful research and  comparison with the text of the Puranas, and various monumental  inscriptions, Colonel Tod came to the conclusion that in the Oodeypore  archives (now hidden from public inspection), not to mention other  sources, may be found a clue to the history of India in particular, and  to universal ancient history in general. Colonel Tod advises the earnest  seeker after this clue not to think, with some flippant archaeologists  who are insufficiently acquainted with India, that the stories of  Rama, the Mahabharata, Krishna, and the five brothers Pandu, are mere  allegories. He affirms that he who seriously considers these legends  will very soon become thoroughly convinced that all these so-called  \"fables\" are founded on historical facts, by the actual existence of  the descendants of the heroes, by tribes, ancient towns, and coins still  extant; that to acquire the right to pronounce a final opinion one must  read first the inscriptions on the Inda-Prestha pillars of Purag and  Mevar, on the rocks of Junagur, in Bijoli, on Aravuli and on all the  ancient Jaina temples scattered throughout India, where are to be found  numerous inscriptions in a language utterly unknown, in comparison with  which the hieroglyphs will seem a mere toy.    Yet, nevertheless, Professor Max Muller, who, as already mentioned, was  never in India, sits as a judge and corrects chronological tables as is  his wont, and Europe, taking his words for those of an oracle, endorses  his decisions. Et c'est ainsi que s'ecrit l'histoire.    Talking of the venerable German Sanskritist's chronology, I cannot  resist the desire to show, be it only to Russia, on what a fragile  basis are founded his scientific discussions, and how little he is to  be trusted when he pronounces upon the antiquity of this or that  manuscript. These pages are of a superficial and descriptive nature,  and, as such, make no pretense to profound learning, so that what  follows may seem incongruous. But it must be remembered that in Russia,  as elsewhere in Europe, people estimate the value of this philological  light by the points of exclamation lavished upon him by his admiring  followers, and that no one reads the Veda Bhashaya of Swami Dayanand.  It may even be that I shall not be far from the truth in saying that the  very existence of this work is ignored, which may perhaps be a fortunate  fact for the reputation of Professor Max Muller. I shall be as brief as  possible. When Professor Max Muller states, in his Sahitya-Grantha, that  the Aryan tribe in India acquired the notion of God step by step and  very slowly, he evidently wishes to prove that the Vedas are far from  being as old as is supposed by some of his colleagues. Having presented,  in due course, some more or less valuable evidence to prove the truth  of this new theory, he ends with a fact which, in his opinion, is  indisputable. He points to the word hiranya-garbha in the mantrams,  which he translates by the word \"gold,\" and adds that, as the part  of the Vedas called chanda appeared 3,100 years ago, the part called  mantrams could not have been written earlier than 2,900 years ago.  Let me remind the reader that the Vedas are divided into two parts:  chandas--slokas, verses, etc.; and mantrams--prayers and rhythmical  hymns, which are, at the same time, incantations used in white magic.  Professor Max Muller divides the mantram (\"Agnihi Poorwebhihi,\"  etc.) philologically and chronologically, and, finding in it the word  hiranya-garbha, he denounces it as an anachronism. The ancients, he  says, had no knowledge of gold, and, therefore, if gold is mentioned in  this mantram it means that the mantram was composed at a comparatively  modern epoch, and so on.    But here the illustrious Sanskritist is very much mistaken. Swami  Dayanand and other pandits, who sometimes are far from being Dayanand's  allies, maintain that Professor Max Muller has completely misunderstood  the meaning of the term hiranya. Originally it did not mean, and, when  united to the word garbha, even now does not mean, gold. So all the  Professor's brilliant demonstrations are labor in vain. The word hiranya  in this mantram must be translated \"divine light\"--mystically a symbol  of knowledge; analogically the alchemists used the term \"sublimated  gold\" for \"light,\" and hoped to compose the objective metal out of its  rays. The two words, hiranya-garbha, taken together, mean, literally,  the \"radiant bosom,\" and, when used in the Vedas, designate the first  principle, in whose bosom, like gold in the bosom of the earth, rests  the light of divine knowledge and truth, the essence of the soul  liberated from the sins of the world. In the mantrams, as in the  chandas, one must always look for a double meaning: (1) a metaphysical  one, purely abstract, and (2) one as purely physical; for everything  existing upon the earth is closely bound to the spiritual world, from  which it proceeds and by which it is reabsorbed. For instance Indra, the  god of thunder, Surya, the sun-god, Vayu, god of the wind, and Agni,  god of fire, all four depending on this first divine principle, expand,  according to the mantram from hiranya-garbha, the radiant bosom. In this  case the gods are the personifications of the forces of Nature. But the  initiated Adepts of India understand very clearly that the god Indra,  for instance, is nothing more than a mere sound, born of the shock of  electrical forces, or simply electricity itself. Surya is not the god of  the sun, but simply the centre of fire in our system, the essence whence  come fire, warmth, light, and so on; the very thing, namely, which  no European scientist, steering an even course between Tyndall and  Schropfer, has, as yet, defined. This concealed meaning has totally  escaped Professor Max Muller's attention, and this is why, clinging to  the dead letter, he never hesitates before cutting a Gordian knot. How  then can he be permitted to pronounce upon the antiquity of the Vedas,  when he is so far from the right understanding of the language of these  ancient writings.    The above is a resume of Dayanand's argument, and to him the  Sanskritists must apply for further particulars, which they will  certainly find in his Rigvedadi Bhashya Bhoomika.        In the cave, every one slept soundly round the fire except myself.  None of my companions seemed to mind in the least either the hum of  the thousand voices of the fair, or the prolonged, far-away roar of the  tigers rising from the valley, or even the loud prayers of the pilgrims  who passed to and fro all night long, never fearing to cross the steep  passage which, even by daylight, caused us such perplexity. They came  in parties of twos and threes, and sometimes there appeared a lonely  unescorted woman. They could not reach the large vihara, because we  occupied the verandah at its entrance, and so, after grumbling a little,  they entered a small lateral cave something like a chapel, containing  a statue of Devaki-Mata, above a tank full of water. Each pilgrim  prostrated himself for a time, then placed his offering at the feet of  the goddess and bathed in the \"holy waters of purification,\" or, at  the least, sprinkled some water over his forehead, cheeks, and breast.  Lastly, retreating backwards, he knelt again at the door and disappeared  in the darkness with a final invocation: \"Mata, maha mata!\"--Mother, O  great mother!    Two of Gulab-Sing's servants, with traditional spears and shields of  rhinoceros skin, who had been ordered to protect us from wild beasts,  sat on the steps of the verandah. I was unable to sleep, and so watched  with increasing curiosity everything that was going on. The Takur, too,  was sleepless. Every time I raised my eyes, heavy with fatigue, the  first object upon which they fell was the gigantic figure of our  mysterious friend.    Having seated himself after the Eastern fashion, with his feet drawn up  and his arms round his knees, the Rajput sat on a bench cut in the rock  at one end of the verandah, gazing out into the silvery atmosphere. He  was so near the abyss that the least incautious movement would expose  him to great danger. But the granite goddess, Bhavani herself, could not  be more immovable. The light of the moon before him was so strong  that the black shadow under the rock which sheltered him was doubly  impenetrable, shrouding his face in absolute darkness. From time to time  the flame of the sinking fires leaping up shed its hot reflection on the  dark bronze face, enabling me to distinguish its sphinx-like lineaments  and its shining eyes, as unmoving as the rest of the features.    \"What am I to think? Is he simply sleeping, or is he in that strange  state, that temporary annihilation of bodily life?... Only this  morning he was telling us how the initiate Raj-yogis were able to plunge  into this state at will... Oh, if I could only go to sleep.....\"    Suddenly a loud prolonged hissing, quite close to my ear, made me  start, trembling with indistinct reminiscences of cobras. The sound was  strident and evidently came from under the hay upon which I rested.  Then it struck one! two! It was our American alarum-clock, which always  traveled with me. I could not help laughing at myself, and, at the same  time, feeling a little ashamed of my involuntary fright.    But neither the hissing, nor the loud striking of the clock, nor my  sudden movement, that made Miss X---- raise her sleepy head, awakened  Gulab-Sing, who still hung over the precipice. Another half hour passed.  The far-away roar of the festivity was still heard, but everything round  me was calm and still. Sleep fled further and further from my eyes. A  fresh, strong wind arose, before"]]]
