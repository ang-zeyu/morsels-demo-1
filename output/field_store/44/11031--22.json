The governor refused to raise Missouri's quota of four regiments  under President Lincoln's first call for seventy-five thousand men  to suppress the rebellion, on the ground that these regiments were  intended to form \"part of the President's army, to make war upon  the people of the seceded states.\" This he declared to be illegal,  unconstitutional, and therefore could not be complied with. This  precipitated a conflict between the state and national forces that  resulted in a civil war within the state since some of her citizens  sided with the general government and some with the state.    On the 20th of April, 1861, the state militia under the governor's  orders captured the Federal arsenal at Liberty, Clay county, and in  the nineteen months following that event \"over three hundred battles  and skirmishes were fought within the limits of the state,\" and it is  assumed that in the last two years of the war, there were half as many  more; \"and it may be said of them,\" continues our historian, \"that they  were relatively more destructive of life, as by this time the contest  had degenerated into a disgraceful internecine struggle.\" [60]    In the fall of 1864, General Sterling Price penetrated the state at  the head of twelve thousand men; captured Lexington, in Ray county,  and Independence, in Jackson county, and thence made his escape  into Arkansas. \"In the course of this raid he marched 1,434 miles,  fought forty-three battles and skirmishes, and according to his own  calculation destroyed upwards of 'ten million dollars' worth of  property,' a fair share of which belonged to his own friends.\" [61]    In August, 1863, the celebrated Military Order No. 11 was issued from  Kansas City, by General Thomas Ewing, by which \"all persons living  in Cass, Jackson, and Bates counties, Missouri, and in that part of  Vernon included in this district, except those living within one mile  of the limits of Independence, Hickman's Mills, Pleasant Hill, and  Harrisonville, and except those in that part of Kaw township, Jackson  county, north of Brush creek and west of the Big Blue, embracing  Kansas City and Westport, are hereby ordered to remove from their  present places of residence within fifteen days from the date hereof.  {LXVI} Those who, within that time, establish their loyalty to the  satisfaction of the commanding officer of the military station nearest  their present place of residence, will receive from him certificates  stating the fact of their loyalty, and the names of the witnesses  by whom it can be shown. All who receive such certificates will be  permitted to remove to any military station in this district, or to any  part of the state of Kansas, except the counties on the eastern borders  of the state. All others shall remove out of this district. Officers  commanding companies and detachments serving in the counties named will  see that this paragraph is promptly obeyed.\" [62]    The admonition in the last clause to commanding officers was rigidly  followed; and within the district named scenes of violence and cruelty  were appalling. This order with its cruel execution has been more  severely criticized than any other act during the entire Civil War.  The justification for it has been urged on the ground that Jackson  county afforded a field of operations for Confederates; that here the  bushwhacking marauders recruited their forces, and found the means of  support; that the policy was necessary on the ground of putting an end  to that kind of warfare. On the other hand, it is contended that \"tried  by any known standard,\" the people in that section of Missouri were as  loyal to the Union as were their neighbors in Kansas. \"They had voted  against secession; they had not only, thus far, kept their quota in the  Union army full, and that without draft or bounty, but they continued  to do so; and if they did not protect themselves against the outrages  alike of Confederate bushwhackers and Union jayhawkers, it was because  early in the war they had been disarmed by Federal authority and were  consequently without the means of defense.\" [63]    By the execution of the order, however, the people in the districts  named \"were driven from their homes, their dwellings burned, their  farms laid waste, and the great bulk of their movable property handed  over, without let or hindrance, to the Kansas 'jayhawkers.' It was  a brutal order, ruthlessly enforced, but so far from expelling or  exterminating the guerrillas, it simply handed the whole district over  to them.\" \"Indeed,\" continues Lucien Carr, \"we are assured by one who  was on the ground, that from this time until the end of the war, no one  wearing the Federal uniform dared risk his life within the devatasted  region. The only people whom the enforcement of the order did injure  were some thousands of those whom it was Ewing's duty to protect.\" [64]    {LXVII} Whether justified or not by the attitude of the Jackson county  people in the Civil War, the execution of Order No. 11 certainly was  but a reenactment, though upon a larger scale, of those scenes which  the inhabitants of that section of the country thirty years before had  perpetrated upon the Latter-day Saints in expelling them from Jackson  county. The awful scenes then enacted inspired the now celebrated  painting by G. C. Bingham, bearing the title \"Civil War,\" and dedicated  by the artist \"to all who cherish the principles of civil liberty.\"    Connected with the scenes of civil strife in Missouri, is a prophecy  uttered by Joseph Smith many years before they began, and recently  published in a very able paper by Elder Junius F. Wells, in the  November number of the _Improvement Era_ for 1902. Elder Wells, it  appears, had the pleasure of an interview with the Hon. Leonidas M.  Lawson, of New York city, formerly a resident of Clay county, Missouri,  and a brother-in-law of General Alexander W. Doniphan, whose name so  frequently occurs in our pages, dealing with events in the history of  the Church while in Missouri.    In the course of the interview, which took place at the University  Club, New York city, Mr. Lawson referred to an incident connected  with a visit to General Doniphan in 1863. General Doniphan, it will  be remembered by those acquainted with his history, took no part in  the Civil War beyond that of a sorrowful spectator. On the occasion of  Mr. Lawson's visit to him, just referred to, they rode through Jackson  county together, and in a letter to Elder Wells, under date of February  7, 1902, Mr. Lawson relates the following incident, which is part of a  biographical sketch of General Doniphan, prepared by Mr. Lawson:    \"In the year 1863, I visited General A. W. Doniphan at his home in  Liberty, Clay county, Missouri. This was soon after the devastation of  Jackson county, Missouri, under what is known as 'Order No. 11.' This  devastation was complete. Farms were everywhere destroyed, and the  farmhouses were burned. During this visit General Doniphan related the  following historical facts and personal incidents:    \"About the year 1831-2, the Mormons settled in Jackson county. Mo.,  under the leadership of Joseph Smith. The people of Jackson county  became dissatisfied with their presence, and forced them to leave;  and they crossed the Missouri river and settled in the counties of De  Kalb, Caldwell and Ray. They founded the town of Far West, and began  to prepare the foundation of a temple. It was here that the troubles  arose which culminated in the expulsion of the Mormons from the state  of Missouri according to the command of Governor Lilburn W. Boggs. This  was known in Missouri annals as the Mormon War. There were many among  those who obeyed the order of the governor, in the state militia, who  believed that the movement against the Mormons {LXVIII} was unjust  and cruel, and that the excitement was kept up by those who coveted  the homes, the barns and the fields of the Mormon people. The latter,  during their residence in the state of Missouri, paid, in entry fees  for the land they claimed, to the United States government land office,  more than $300,000, which, for that period represented a tremendous  interest. During their sojourn in Missouri the Mormons did not practice  or teach polygamy, so that question did not enter into it.    \"Following the early excitement, Joseph Smith was indicted for treason  against the state of Missouri, and General Doniphan was one of the  counsel employed to defend him, he having shown a friendly interest in  Smith, whom he considered very badly treated. Joseph Smith was placed  in prison in Liberty, Missouri, to await his trial. This place was the  residence of General Doniphan. His partner in the practice of law was  James H. Baldwin.    \"On one occasion General Doniphan caused the sheriff of the county to  bring Joseph Smith from the prison to his law office, for the purpose  of consultation about his defense. During Smith's presence in the  office, a citizen of Jackson county, Missouri, came in for the purpose  of paying a fee which was due by him to the firm of Doniphan and  Baldwin, and offered in payment a tract of land in Jackson county.    \"Doniphan told him that his partner, Mr. Baldwin, was absent at the  moment, but as soon as he had an opportunity he would consult him and  decide about the matter. When the Jackson county man retired, Joseph  Smith, who had overheard the conversation, addressed General Doniphan  about as follows:    \"'_Doniphan, I advise you not to take that Jackson county land in  payment of the debt, God's wrath hangs over Jackson county. God's  people have been ruthlessly driven from it, and you will live to see  the day when it will be visited by fire and sword. The Lord of Hosts  will sweep it with the besom of destruction. The fields and farms and  houses will be destroyed, and only the chimneys will be left to mark  the desolation_.'\"    \"Gen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47708"],[0,"Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (#17)"],[1," the steward lay, and in passing  through the door met the captain, who was in tears. He said, \"Mr.  Snow, it is too late; he is expiring, he is breathing his last!\" My  brother made no reply, but took a seat beside the dying man. After  devoting a few moments to secret prayer, he laid his hands on the head  of the young man, prayed, and in the name of Jesus Christ rebuked the  disease and commanded him to be made whole. Very soon after, to the  joy and astonishment of all, he was seen walking the deck, praising  and glorifying God for his restoration. The officers and sailors  acknowledged the miraculous power of God, and on landing at New Orleans  several of them were baptized, also the first mate, February 26, 1843.    At New Orleans the Saints left the \"Swanton,\" and, on board the  \"Amaranth,\" wended their way up the Missouri and Mississippi rivers to  the city of Nauvoo. Descriptive of their arrival, I clip the following  paragraph from the \"History of Joseph Smith,\" under date of April 12,  1843:    \"Before the Elders' Conference closed, the steamer 'Amaranth' appeared  in sight of the Temple, coming up the river, and about noon landed  her passengers at the wharf opposite the old Post Office building,  consisting of about two hundred and forty Saints from England, under  the charge of Elder Lorenzo Snow, who left Liverpool last January,  after a mission of nearly three years. This is the first boat up this  season.\"    The time of the arrival had been announced, and many hearts (mine not  excepted) were anxiously and expectantly beating, and when the steamer  came in sight, every eye was turned in the direction, and as it neared  the landing, white handkerchiefs were waving along the shore, up and  down, for a great distance. President Joseph Smith, with a large number  of brothers and sisters, was present to greet our friends, and he gave  notice to the new comers to meet at the Temple on the next day at ten  o'clock, to receive instructions.    It should be borne in mind that time and progress have wrought great  changes since that event--at that time steamers were not navigating  the ocean with the astonishing rapidity they are doing forty years  later--crossing in a few days; and, at that time, letter communication  was very tardy in comparison with the present fast age, and cablegram  nonexistent. In consideration of these circumstances, it will be  readily understood that a mission to England _now_ differs very  considerably from a mission to England _then_--saying nothing about  the aid and facilities of the railroads of the present day. In view of  all these improvements, it is easy to comprehend that the arrival of a  company of Saints from Europe was hailed as an important event. To me,  personally, the one alluded to above was particularly so.    The appearance of the \"Amaranth,\" as it came in sight, attracted the  gaze of many eyes, but I then thought, and still think, that of all the  crowd that watched its progress up the Mississippi, as it approached  the wharf, no one felt a deeper interest than myself. Knowing that the  steamer held a dear brother with whom, three years before, I parted for  an indefinite period, I watched it coming, and the white handkerchiefs  waving from its deck--perhaps one is his, and in a few moments I shall  clasp the hand that waves it! Although I determined to appear to the  bystanders undemonstrative, I have not forgotten how my heart beat when  the steamer reached the wharf. It may seem trivial to others, but that  is one of the incidents in my life that has fastened indelibly on my  memory.    While my brother was absent on this, his first mission to Europe,  changes had taken place with me, one of eternal import, of which I  supposed him to be entirely ignorant. The Prophet Joseph had taught me  the principle of plural, or Celestial Marriage, and I was married to  him for time and eternity. In consequence of the ignorance of most of  the Saints, as well as people of the world, on this subject, it was not  mentioned only privately between the few whose minds were enlightened  on the subject.    Not knowing how my brother would receive it, I did not feel at liberty,  and did not wish to assume the responsibility of instructing him in  the principle of plural marriage, and either maintained silence, or,  to his indirect questioning, gave evasive answers, until I was forced,  by his cool and distant manner, to feel that he was growing jealous  of my sisterly confidence--that I could not confide in his brotherly  integrity. I could not endure this--something must be done. I informed  my husband of the situation, and requested him to open the subject  to my brother. A favorable opportunity soon presented, and, seated  together on the lone bank of the Mississippi river, they had a most  interesting conversation. The Prophet afterwards told me that he found  that my brother's mind had been previously enlightened on the subject  in question, and was ready to receive whatever the spirit of revelation  from God should impart. That Comforter which Jesus said should \"_lead  into all truth_,\" had penetrated his understanding, and while in  England had given him an intimation of what at that time was, to many,  _a secret_. This was the result of living near the Lord, and holding  communion with Him.        CHAPTER XIII.

It was at the private interview referred to above, that the Prophet  Joseph unbosomed his heart, and described the trying mental ordeal he  experienced in overcoming the repugnance of his feelings, the natural  result of the force of education and social custom, relative to the  introduction of plural marriage. He knew the voice of God--he knew  the commandment of the Almighty to him was to go forward--to set the  example, and establish Celestial plural marriage. He knew that he  had not only his own prejudices and prepossessions to combat and to  overcome, but those of the whole Christian world stared him in the  face; but God, who is above all, had given the commandment, and He  must be obeyed. Yet the Prophet hesitated and deferred from time to  time, until an angel of God stood by him with a drawn sword, and told  him that, unless he moved forward and established plural marriage,  his Priesthood would be taken from him and he should be destroyed!  This testimony he not only bore to my brother, but also to others--a  testimony that cannot be gainsayed.    From my brother's journal: \"At the interview on the bank of the  Mississippi, in which the Prophet Joseph explained the doctrine of  Celestial Marriage, I felt very humble, and in my simplicity besought  him earnestly to correct me and set me right if, at any time, he should  see me indulging any principle or practice that might tend to lead  astray, into forbidden paths; to which he replied, 'Brother Lorenzo,  the principles of honesty and integrity are founded within you, and  you will never be guilty of any serious error or wrong, to lead you  from the path of duty. The Lord will open your way to receive and obey  the law of Celestial Marriage.' During the conversation, I remarked  to the Prophet I thought he appeared to have been endowed with great  additional power during my mission in England. He said it was true; the  Lord had bestowed on him additional divine power.\"    On the 22d of May, Lorenzo and I started on a visit to our parents in  Walnut Grove, seventy-five miles northeast from Nauvoo, and we returned  on the 1st of June. On the 12th, he left for Ohio; and when he returned  on the last of August, he found me at our sister's, Mrs. Leonora  A. Snow Morley, where our brother's occasional visits were highly  appreciated. He spent a few days with us at the close of the year 1843.  On the evening of December 31, a social circle of a few choice friends  convened at the house of our sister, and we had a lovely time.    My brother being one of the orators of the evening, and his sister  secretary _pro tem_., I copy from my own journal the following extracts  from his parting speech, on the closing year:    Lima, Sunday Evening, December 31, 1843. The year 1843 is just closing  upon us with all its eventfulness. While meditating upon the subject,  the thought suggested to my mind that it was brother Lorenzo's turn  to address those present. I made the motion, which was seconded and  carried unanimously (of course); and responding, he gave a very  interesting address--beautifully adapted to the occasion and to the  peculiar circumstances of those present.    He spoke of the anticipations of the future, on which the past had  a very important bearing--the probable eventful scenery of the year  about to open before us. In referring to the past, he said that the  individuals present, while standing on the threshold of the year  now closing, _did not_ and _could not_ imagine it possible for the  changes to transpire which have transpired, with the reception and  understanding--the light and intelligence connected with principles of  salvation, etc., which will have an important bearing upon our future  welfare; and we may also expect that the coming year will be as replete  with interesting changes, and with consequences of more importance than  our minds at present are capable of comprehending.    But from the marvellous dealings of Divine Providence in overruling all  things for our good--in bringing us safely through difficult scenes, we  may look forward without the least anxiety--having everything to hope  and "]]]
