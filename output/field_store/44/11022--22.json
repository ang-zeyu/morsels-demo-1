The enemy, doubtless imagining  that young Reid's hardihood was backed by a large reserve at his  elbow, promptly surrendered, and the gallant British band had the  honour of recording a haul of forty-one prisoners, including the  commandant, Schroeder, and one excellent Maxim, together with horses,  mules, waggons, and ammunition. The Boers, on their side, scored  slightly elsewhere. On the day following this brilliant episode, while  Major Twyford, with a small escort, was moving from Machadodorp to  Lydenburg, there to join the Royal Scots, the enemy lay in ambush  near Badfontein, a valley on the Crocodile River. Their plans were  successful, for it was not difficult in this shelving and dipping  region to surprise a small party moving over a vast tract of difficult  country. The tussle that followed was a tough one, the men fighting  desperately and refusing to surrender. At last Major Twyford was  killed and his band overpowered.    [Illustration: DEFEAT OF A NIGHT ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE RAILWAY    Drawing by Allan Stewart]    The results of General Plumer's operations between the 14th and 28th  of April were ninety-one prisoners, twenty surrendered, one Maxim,  20,360 rounds ammunition, twenty-six waggons and carts, and forty-six  mules.      LIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR BINDON BLOOD'S OPERATIONS NORTH OF THE LINE  MIDDELBURG--BELFAST--LYDENBURG    On the day (14th April) that General Plumer, having garrisoned  Pietersburg, left there to seize the drifts on the Olifant River, and  thus close the avenues of escape leading towards the north-west, Sir  Bindon Blood disposed his force in the following manner. The columns  of Colonel Park and General Kitchener occupied Lydenburg, with those  of Colonel Douglas at Witklip (south of them). Colonel Pulteney was  stationed at Belfast, while at Middelburg were Colonel Benson and  General Beatson. The columns of Colonels Pulteney and Benson were  commanded by General Fetherstonhaugh.    These columns, admirably placed for the work in hand, now began to  move, so that the enemy in this difficult region might no longer plume  himself on being secure from attack.    Column One, under Colonel Park, moving round into the Waterval Valley,  joined hands with Column Two under General W. Kitchener near  Rietfontein. In this region Colonel Park remained, so as to check any  attempt on the part of the Boers to move north from Roosenekal, while  General Kitchener continued his advance across the Steelport River to  Fort Weber, which was reached on the 18th of April.    Column Three, under Colonel Douglas, moved to Dullstroom (_via_  Zwagershoek and Palmietfontein), which was reached on the 17th of  April. On the following day Colonel Pulteney, with Column Four,  arrived there from Belfast, but pushed on _via_ Witpoort to occupy  Roosenekal. On his approach Mr. Schalk Burger and his Government, in  hot haste, bolted to Leydsdorp, leaving papers of the South African  Republic and many banknotes behind. Some of the documents captured at  Roosenekal by the forces under Sir Bindon Blood consisted of (1) a  circular issued by the Boer Commandant-General as to the treatment of  burghers who have surrendered; (2) a letter of representatives of the  Central Peace Committee, Pretoria, urging surrender; and (3) a  certificate of the execution of M. de Kock, a member of that  committee. In the letter from the Central Peace Committee, one of the  signatories of which was M. de Kock, there occurred, after a reference  to the strong position of Lord Kitchener, the following words:--         \"What is submitted to you is a well-meant offer from a powerful       man, who is sure of his case, and a person who is willing to do       everything to restore peace and prevent further bloodshed and       destruction of our dear country, and to remove the sufferings       of our wives and children; and when I submit this verbally to       you, you will be convinced that this is truly the act of a       strong man, who knows his own strength and might, and can thus       hold out the olive branch. Oh, I trust that you and your       fellow-burghers will accept it as such, and not do as we       Afrikanders generally do, when such representations are made to       us, to consider it a sign of weakness, because the Lord knows       that he (Lord Kitchener) is doing so from pure nobility of       soul, and the wish of the British people to prevent further       bloodshed.\"    The foregoing was evidently issued after M. de Kock had met Lord  Kitchener in Pretoria. Then followed a circular by Commandant C. R. de  Wet denouncing Lord Kitchener's terms, and a circular issued by  Commandant Botha giving his account of the negotiations. De Wet  stated:--         \"Finally, I wish to observe that if I and our Government were       so foolish as to accept the proposals of Lord Kitchener, I am       convinced that the great majority of our people, if not all,       who are now fighting, would not agree, for to accept those       proposals means nothing less than the complete subjection of       the Afrikander people, and the subjection of a people is more       bitter to think of than the death of every single burgher.\"    To Roosenekal Colonel Benson, with Column Five, also directed his  steps, marching by Bankfontein and Klupspruit and Blinkwater, clearing  the surrounding country as he went. He and Colonel Pulteney having  come in touch with each other, they now scoured the valley around  Steelpoort, unearthing Boers and capturing burghers innumerable.    General Beatson, with Column Six, was engaged in a prodigious task.  Besides sweeping the country--Avontuur, Laatste Drift--through which  he marched, to Brakfontein, he was instructed to hold both Wagon and  Crocodile Drifts on the Olifant River, and to push out patrols to  connect with General Plumer's troops on the lower reaches of the  river.    Later, General W. Kitchener, from Fort Weber, moved south to  Paardeplaats, in the vicinity of which place he operated for some days  making captures of prisoners and stock, and then proceeding farther  south to clear the Bothaberg before going to Middelburg.    To Middelburg _via_ Blinkwater also went Colonel Pulteney from  Roosenekal, while Colonels Benson and Douglas (who for some time  co-operated at Dullstroom) marched to Belfast.    Thus the country was completely weeded of the enemy, and though some  few effected their escape through the rugged region east of the  Steelpoort Valley, 1081 Boers surrendered. Other captures included a  1-pounder quick-firing Krupp gun complete, with one hundred rounds of  ammunition, one pom-pom, 540 rifles, 204,450 rounds of ammunition, 247  horses, 611 waggons and carts. One Long Tom, one 4.7-inch gun  (captured at Helvetia), one 15-pounder gun, one 12-pounder Krupp gun,  two pom-poms, and two Maxims were blown up by the enemy to avoid  capture. Unfortunately a gallant Victorian, Lieutenant Beatty, lost  his life.    [Illustration: MAP ILLUSTRATING THE COMBINED MOVEMENT TO CLEAR THE  NORTHERN TRANSVAAL]    The combined operations thus satisfactorily concluded, General Plumer  concentrated his troops and marched by the line of Elands and Kameel  Rivers to Eerste Fabrieken. General Blood, still co-operating,  directed General Beatson to move his force from Wagon Drift along the  left bank of the Wilge River to Bronker's Spruit Station. Colonel  Allenby (who had returned from assisting General French's operations)  moved from Middelburg to Witbank, and thence, in conjunction with  General Beatson, began to clear the angle of the Wilge and Olifant  Rivers. The enemy was now dispersing in every direction. Only one  party driven westward by General Beatson was caught. This, in full  flight, was overtaken by a detachment from General Plumer's force.  Major Vialls and the 3rd Victorian Bushmen, after an exciting chase  over the rugged wilds, brought in twenty-seven prisoners, eighteen  rifles, thirty waggons, and 1000 head of cattle.    General Plumer reached his destination (Eerste Fabrieken) on the 4th  of May.      COLONEL GRENFELL AT PIETERSBURG    Concurrently with the activities of General Plumer and Sir Bindon  Blood, events of some importance took place near Pietersburg. No  sooner had General Plumer turned his back on the place than the Boers,  some fifteen miles to the north, began to collect. A reconnaissance  conducted by Mounted Infantry scented out a big commando, said to be  under the command of Van Rensburg, at Klipdam. Accordingly Colonel  Grenfell, with his column (Kitchener's Fighting Scouts), was sent by  rail to Pietersburg \"to clear up the situation.\" The clearing up  process was highly effective. Moving by night (on the 26th of April),  the troops came on the laager at Klipdam a little before dawn, and  with the first streak of day delivered their attack. The fight was  short, sharp, and brilliant. Seven Boers were killed. Only one of our  men was wounded. Forty-one Dutchmen were captured, together with their  camp, twenty-six horses, ten mules, waggons multifarious, and 76,000  rounds of ammunition.    This dashing exploit was soon followed by another, less showy but  decidedly practical. Report having declared that the last Long Tom of  the enemy was ensconced somewhere twenty miles east of Pietersburg,  Colonel Grenfell directed his energies towards its capture. He marched  hot foot _via_ Doornhoek--which he reached on the 30th--to Berg  Plaats. But the enemy was on the _qui vive_. They determined that Long  Tom should show fight till his last gasp, and opened fire at over  10,000 yards range. Still Colonel Grenfell's men pushed on and on,  determined to capture their prize, while the horrible weapon snorted  derisively. At last, after firing sixteen rounds, and while  Kitchener's Fighting Scouts were steadily bearing down on them, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4715"],[0,"An African Millionaire: Episodes in the Life of the Illustrious Colonel Clay (#17)"],[1,"round the  corner of the island, White Heather--so she looked--stood up in the  stern and shouted aloud through her pretty hands to us. \"By-bye,  dear Sir Charles!\" she cried. \"Do wrap the rug around you! I'll  send the men to fetch you as soon as ever I possibly can. And thank  you so much for those lovely flowers!\"    The boat rounded the crags. We were alone on the island. Charles  flung himself on the bare rock in a wild access of despondency.  He is accustomed to luxury, and cannot get on without his padded  cushions. As for myself, I climbed with some difficulty to the top  of the cliff, landward, and tried to make signals of distress with  my handkerchief to some passer-by on the mainland. All in vain.  Charles had dismissed the crofters on the estate; and, as the  shooting-party that day was in an opposite direction, not a soul  was near to whom we could call for succour.    I climbed down again to Charles. The evening came on slowly. Cries  of sea-birds rang weird upon the water. Puffins and cormorants  circled round our heads in the gray of twilight. Charles suggested  that they might even swoop down upon us and bite us. They did not,  however, but their flapping wings added none the less a painful  touch of eeriness to our hunger and solitude. Charles was horribly  depressed. For myself, I will confess I felt so much relieved at  the fact that Colonel Clay had not openly betrayed me in the matter  of the commission, as to be comparatively comfortable.    We crouched on the hard crag. About eleven o'clock we heard human  voices. \"Boat ahoy!\" I shouted. An answering shout aroused us to  action. We rushed down to the landing-place and cooee'd for the men,  to show them where we were. They came up at once in Sir Charles's  own boat. They were fishermen from Niggarey, on the shore of the  Firth opposite.    A lady and gentleman had sent them, they said, to return the boat  and call for us on the island; their description corresponded to  the two supposed Grantons. They rowed us home almost in silence to  Seldon. It was half-past twelve by the gatehouse clock when we  reached the castle. Men had been sent along the coast each way to  seek us. Amelia had gone to bed, much alarmed for our safety. Isabel  was sitting up. It was too late, of course, to do much that night in  the way of apprehending the miscreants, though Charles insisted upon  dispatching a groom, with a telegram for the police at Inverness,  to Fowlis.    Nothing came of it all. A message awaited us from Lord  Craig-Ellachie, to be sure, saying that his son had not left  Glen-Ellachie Lodge; while research the next day and later showed  that our correspondent had never even received our letter. An empty  envelope alone had arrived at the house, and the postal authorities  had been engaged meanwhile, with their usual lightning speed, in  \"investigating the matter.\" Cesarine had posted the letter herself  at Fowlis, and brought back the receipt; so the only conclusion we  could draw was this--Colonel Clay must be in league with somebody  at the post-office. As for Lord Craig-Ellachie's reply, that was a  simple forgery; though, oddly enough, it was written on  Glen-Ellachie paper.    However, by the time Charles had eaten a couple of grouse, and  drunk a bottle of his excellent Rudesheimer, his spirits and valour  revived exceedingly. Doubtless he inherits from his Boer ancestry a  tendency towards courage of the Batavian description. He was in  capital feather.    \"After all, Sey,\" he said, leaning back in his chair, \"this time  we score one. He has _not_ done us brown; we have at least detected  him. To detect him in time is half-way to catching him. Only the  remoteness of our position at Seldon Castle saved him from capture.  Next set-to, I feel sure, we will not merely spot him, we will also  nab him. I only wish he would try on such a rig in London.\"    But the oddest part of it all was this, that from the moment those  two people landed at Niggarey, and told the fishermen there were  some gentlemen stranded on the Seamew's island, all trace of them  vanished. At no station along the line could we gain any news of  them. Their maid had left the inn the same morning with their  luggage, and we tracked her to Inverness; but there the trail  stopped short, no spoor lay farther. It was a most singular and  insoluble mystery.    Charles lived in hopes of catching his man in London.    But for my part, I felt there was a show of reason in one last  taunt which the rascal flung back at us as the boat receded: \"Sir  Charles Vandrift, we are a pair of rogues. The law protects _you_.  It persecutes _me_. That's all the difference.\"          VI    THE EPISODE OF THE GERMAN PROFESSOR      That winter in town my respected brother-in-law had little time  on his hands to bother himself about trifles like Colonel Clay.  A thunderclap burst upon him. He saw his chief interest in South  Africa threatened by a serious, an unexpected, and a crushing  danger.    Charles does a little in gold, and a little in land; but his  principal operations have always lain in the direction of diamonds.  Only once in my life, indeed, have I seen him pay the slightest  attention to poetry, and that was when I happened one day to  recite the lines:--      Full many a gem of purest ray serene    The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear.    He rubbed his hands at once and murmured enthusiastically, \"I never  thought of that. We might get up an Atlantic Exploration Syndicate,  Limited.\" So attached is he to diamonds. You may gather, therefore,  what a shock it was to that gigantic brain to learn that science was  rapidly reaching a point where his favourite gems might become all  at once a mere drug in the market. Depreciation is the one bugbear  that perpetually torments Sir Charles's soul; that winter he stood  within measurable distance of so appalling a calamity.    It happened after this manner.    We were strolling along Piccadilly towards Charles's club one  afternoon--he is a prominent member of the Croesus, in Pall  Mall--when, near Burlington House, whom should we happen to knock  up against but Sir Adolphus Cordery, the famous mineralogist, and  leading spirit of the Royal Society! He nodded to us pleasantly.  \"Halloa, Vandrift,\" he cried, in his peculiarly loud and piercing  voice; \"you're the very man I wanted to meet to-day. Good morning,  Wentworth. Well, how about diamonds now, Sir Gorgius? You'll have to  sing small. It's all up with you Midases. Heard about this marvellous  new discovery of Schleiermacher's? It's calculated to make you  diamond kings squirm like an eel in a frying-pan.\"    I could see Charles wriggle inside his clothes. He was most  uncomfortable. That a man like Cordery should say such things, in  so loud a voice, on no matter how little foundation, openly in  Piccadilly, was enough in itself to make a sensitive barometer  such as Cloetedorp Golcondas go down a point or two.    \"Hush, hush!\" Charles said solemnly, in that awed tone of voice  which he always assumes when Money is blasphemed against. \"_Please_  don't talk quite so loud! All London can hear you.\"    Sir Adolphus ran his arm through Charles's most amicably. There's  nothing Charles hates like having his arm taken.    \"Come along with me to the Athenaeum,\" he went on, in the same  stentorian voice, \"and I'll tell you all about it. Most interesting  discovery. Makes diamonds cheap as dirt. Calculated to supersede  South Africa altogether.\"    Charles allowed himself to be dragged along. There was nothing else  possible. Sir Adolphus continued, in a somewhat lower key, induced  upon him by Charles's mute look of protest. It was a disquieting  story. He told it with gleeful unction. It seems that Professor  Schleiermacher, of Jena, \"the greatest living authority on the  chemistry of gems,\" he said, had lately invented, or claimed to  have invented, a system for artificially producing diamonds, which  had yielded most surprising and unexceptionable results.    Charles's lip curled slightly. \"Oh, I know the sort of thing,\" he  said. \"I've heard of it before. Very inferior stones, quite small  and worthless, produced at immense cost, and even then not worth  looking at. I'm an old bird, you know, Cordery; not to be caught  with chaff. Tell me a better one!\"    Sir Adolphus produced a small cut gem from his pocket. \"How's that  for the first water?\" he inquired, passing it across, with a broad  smile, to the sceptic. \"Made under my own eyes--and quite  inexpensively!\"    Charles examined it close, stopping short against the railings in  St. James's Square to look at it with his pocket-lens. There was no  denying the truth. It was a capital small gem of the finest quality.    \"Made under your own eyes?\" he exclaimed, still incredulous. \"Where,  my dear sir?--at Jena?\"    The answer was a thunderbolt from a blue sky. \"No, here in London;  last night as ever was; before myself and Dr. Gray; and about to be  exhibited by the President himself at a meeting of Fellows of the  Royal Society.\"    Charles drew a long breath. \"This nonsense must be stopped,\" he said  firmly--\"it must be nipped in the bud. It won't do, my dear friend;  we can't have such tampering with important Interests.\"    \"How do you mean?\" Cordery asked, astonished.    Charles gazed at him steadily. I could see by the furtive gleam in  my brother-in-law's eye he was distinctly frightened. \"Where _is_  the fellow?\" he asked. \"Did he come himself, or send over a deputy?\"    \"Here in London,\" Sir Adolphus replied. \"He's staying at my house;  and he says he'll be glad to show his experiments to anybody  scientifically interested in diamonds. We propose to have a  demonstration of the process to-night at Lancaster Gate. Will  you drop in and see it?\"    Would he \"drop in\" and see it? \"Drop in\" at such a function! Could  he possibly stop away? Charles clutched the enemy's arm with a  nervous grip. \"Look here, Cordery,\" "]]]
