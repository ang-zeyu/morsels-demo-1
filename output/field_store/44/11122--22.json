[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6927"],[0,"The White Feather (#17)"],[1,"later the  other Ripton centre scored. At the end of twenty minutes the Wrykyn  line had been crossed five times, and each of the tries had been  converted.    \"_Can't_ you fellows get that ball in the scrum?\" demanded  Allardyce plaintively, as the team began for the fifth time the old  familiar walk to the half-way line. \"Pack tight, and get the first  shove.\"    The result of this address was to increase the Ripton lead by four  points. In his anxiety to get the ball, one of the Wrykyn forwards  started heeling before it was in, and the referee promptly gave a free  kick to Ripton for \"foot up\". As this event took place within easy  reach of the Wrykyn goal, and immediately in front of the same, Keith  had no difficulty in bringing off the penalty.    By half-time the crowd in the road, hoarse with laughter, had exhausted  all their adjectives and were repeating themselves. The Ripton score  was six goals, a penalty goal, and two tries to nil, and the Wrykyn  team was a demoralised rabble.    The fact that the rate of scoring slackened somewhat after the interval  may be attributed to the disinclination of the Riptonians to exert  themselves unduly. They ceased playing in the stern and scientific  spirit in which they had started; and, instead of adhering to an  orthodox game, began to enjoy themselves. The forwards no longer heeled  like a machine. They broke through ambitiously, and tried to score on  their own account. When the outsides got as far as the back, they did  not pass. They tried to drop goals. In this way only twenty-two points  were scored after half-time. Allardyce and Drummond battled on nobly,  but with their pack hopelessly outclassed it was impossible for them to  do anything of material use. Barry, on the wing, tackled his man  whenever the latter got the ball, but, as a rule, the centres did not  pass, but attacked by themselves. At last, by way of a fitting  conclusion to the rout, the Ripton back, catching a high punt, ran  instead of kicking, and, to the huge delight of the town contingent,  scored. With this incident the visiting team drained the last dregs of  the bitter cup. Humiliation could go no further. Almost immediately  afterwards the referee blew his whistle for \"No side\".    \"Three cheers for Wrykyn,\" said Keith.    To the fifteen victims it sounded ironical.          XVI    DRUMMOND GOES INTO RETIREMENT      The return journey of a school team after a crushing defeat in a  foreign match is never a very exhilarating business. Those members of  the side who have not yet received their colours are wondering which of  them is to be sacrificed to popular indignation and \"chucked\": the  rest, who have managed to get their caps, are feeling that even now  two-thirds of the school will be saying that they are not worth a place  in the third fifteen; while the captain, brooding apart, is becoming  soured at the thought that Posterity will forget what little good he  may have done, and remember only that it was in his year that the  school got so many points taken off them by So-and-So. Conversation  does not ripple and sparkle during these home-comings. The Wrykyn team  made the journey in almost unbroken silence. They were all stiff and  sore, and their feelings were such as to unfit them for talking to  people.    The school took the thing very philosophically--a bad sign. When a  school is in a healthy, normal condition, it should be stirred up by a  bad defeat by another school, like a disturbed wasps' nest. Wrykyn made  one or two remarks about people who could not play footer for toffee,  and then let the thing drop.    Sheen was too busy with his work and his boxing to have much leisure  for mourning over this latest example of the present inefficiency of  the school. The examination for the Gotford was to come off in two  days, and the inter-house boxing was fixed for the following Wednesday.  In five days, therefore, he would get his chance of retrieving his lost  place in the school. He was certain that he could, at any rate make a  very good show against anyone in the school, even Drummond. Joe Bevan  was delighted with his progress, and quoted Shakespeare volubly in his  admiration. Jack Bruce and Francis added their tribute, and the knife  and boot boy paid him the neatest compliment of all by refusing  point-blank to have any more dealings with him whatsoever. His  professional duties, explained the knife and boot boy, did not include  being punched in the heye by blokes, and he did not intend to be put  upon.    \"You'll do all right,\" said Jack Bruce, as they were motoring home, \"if  they'll let you go in for it all. But how do you know they will? Have  they chosen the men yet?\"    \"Not yet. They don't do it till the day before. But there won't be any  difficulty about that. Drummond will let me have a shot if he thinks  I'm good enough.\"    \"Oh, you're good enough,\" said Bruce.    And when, on Monday evening, Francis, on receipt of no fewer than four  blows in a single round--a record, shook him by the hand and said that  if ever he happened to want a leetle darg that was a perfect bag of  tricks and had got a pedigree, mind you, he, Francis, would be proud to  supply that animal, Sheen felt that the moment had come to approach  Drummond on the subject of the house boxing. It would be a little  awkward at first, and conversation would probably run somewhat stiffly;  but all would be well once he had explained himself.    But things had been happening in his absence which complicated the  situation. Allardyce was having tea with Drummond, who had been  stopping in with a sore throat. He had come principally to make  arrangements for the match between his house and Seymour's in the  semi-final round of the competition.    \"You're looking bad,\" he said, taking a seat.    \"I'm feeling bad,\" said Drummond. For the past few days he had been  very much out of sorts. He put it down to a chill caught after the  Ripton match. He had never mustered up sufficient courage to sponge  himself with cold water after soaking in a hot bath, and he  occasionally suffered for it.    \"What's up?\" inquired Allardyce.    \"Oh, I don't know. Sort of beastly feeling. Sore throat. Nothing much.  Only it makes you feel rather rotten.\"    Allardyce looked interested.    \"I say,\" he said, \"it looks as if--I wonder. I hope you haven't.\"    \"What?\"    \"Mumps. It sounds jolly like it.\"    \"Mumps! Of course I've not. Why should I?\"    Allardyce produced a letter from his pocket. \"I got this from Keith,  the Ripton captain, this morning. You know they've had a lot of the  thing there. Oh, didn't you? That was why they had such a bad team  out.\"    \"Bad team!\" murmured Drummond.    \"Well, I mean not their best team. They had four of their men down with  mumps. Here's what Keith says. Listen. Bit about hoping we got back all  right, and so on, first. Then he says--here it is, 'Another of our  fellows has got the mumps. One of the forwards; rather a long man who  was good out of touch. He developed it a couple of days after the  match. It's lucky that all our card games are over. We beat John's,  Oxford, last Wednesday, and that finished the card. But it'll rather  rot up the House matches. We should have walked the cup, but there's no  knowing what will happen now. I hope none of your lot caught the mumps  from Browning during the game. It's quite likely, of course. Browning  ought not to have been playing, but I had no notion that there was  anything wrong with him. He never said he felt bad.' You've got it,  Drummond. That's what's the matter with you.\"    \"Oh, rot,\" said Drummond. \"It's only a chill.\"    But the school doctor, who had looked in at the house to dose a small  Seymourite who had indulged too heartily in the pleasures of the table,  had other views, and before lock-up Drummond was hurried off to the  infirmary.    Sheen went to Drummond's study after preparation had begun, and was  surprised to find him out. Not being on speaking terms with a single  member of the house, he was always out-of-date as regarded items of  school news. As a rule he had to wait until Jack Bruce told him before  learning of any occurrence of interest. He had no notion that mumps was  the cause of Drummond's absence, and he sat and waited patiently for  him in his study till the bell rang for prayers. The only possible  explanation that occurred to him was that Drummond was in somebody  else's study, and he could not put his theory to the test by going and  looking. It was only when Drummond did not put in an appearance at  prayers that Sheen began to suspect that something might have happened.    It was maddening not to be able to make inquiries. He had almost  decided to go and ask Linton, and risk whatever might be the  consequences of such a step, when he remembered that the matron must  know. He went to her, and was told that Drummond was in the infirmary.    He could not help seeing that this made his position a great deal more  difficult. In ten minutes he could have explained matters to Drummond  if he had found him in his study. But it would be a more difficult task  to put the thing clearly in a letter.    Meanwhile, it was bed-time, and he soon found his hands too full with  his dormitory to enable him to think out the phrasing of that letter.  The dormitory, which was recruited entirely from the junior day-room,  had heard of Drummond's departure with rejoicings. They liked Drummond,  but he was a good deal too fond of the iron hand for their tastes. A  night with Sheen in charge should prove a welcome change.    A deafening uproar was going on when Sheen arrived, and as he came into  the room somebody turned the gas out. He found some matches on the chest  of drawers, and lit it again just in time to see a sportive youth tearing  the clothes off his bed and piling them on the floor. A month before he  would not have known how to grapple with such a situation, but his  evenings with Joe"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6932"],[0,"Pictures Every Child Should Know (#17)"],[1," longer. Springing  from his seat in the refectory he flung the soup all over the monk who  had served it, and taking a great loaf of bread he beat him with it so  hard that the poor monk was carried to his cell, nearly dead. The  abbot had gone to bed, but hearing the rumpus he thought it was  nothing less than the roof falling in, and he hurried to the room  where he found the brothers still raging over their dinner. David  shouted out to him, when the abbot tried to reprove the artist, that  his brother was worth more than any \"pig of an abbot who ever lived!\"    It is recorded in the documents found in the Confraternity of St. Paul  that:    Domenico de Ghurrado Bighordi, painter, called del Grillandaio, died  on Saturday morning, on the 11th day of January, 1493 (o.s.), of a  pestilential fever, and the overseers allowed no one to see the dead  man, and would not have him buried by day. So he was buried, in Santa  Maria Novella, on Saturday night after sunset, and may God forgive  him! This was a very great loss for he was highly esteemed for his  many qualities, and is universally lamented.    The artist left nine children behind him.    Ghirlandajo's pictures may be found in the Louvre, the Berlin Museum,  the Dresden, Munich, and London galleries. Most children will find it  hard to see their beauty.    Great men are likely to come in groups, and with Ghirlandajo there are  associated Botticelli and Fra Filippo Lippi.      PLATE--PORTRAIT OF GIOVANNA DEGLI ALBIZI    This lovely lady was the wife of one of the painter's patrons,  Giovanni Tornabuoni, through whom he received the commission for a  series of frescoes in the choir of the Santa Maria Novella,  Florence. The subjects chosen were sacred, but since Ghirlandajo, no  more than his neighbours, knew what the Virgin or her contemporaries  looked like, he saw no reason why he should not compliment some of the  great ones of his own city and his own time by painting them in to  represent the different characters of Holy Writ. So, as one of the  ladies attendant upon Elizabeth when Mary comes to visit her, we have  this signora of the fifteenth century. The artist made another picture  of her, the one here shown, but in the same dress and posed the same  as she had been for the church fresco. This accounts for its dignity  and simplicity. It would seem like a bas-relief cut out of marble were  it not for its wonderful colouring. It is in the Rudolf Kann  Collection, Paris. This artist's other pictures are \"Adoration of the  Shepherds,\" \"Adoration of the Magi,\" \"Madonna and Child with Saints,\"  \"Three Saints and God the Father,\" \"Coronation of the Virgin,\" and  \"Portrait of Old Man and Boy.\"          XVIII    GIOTTO (DI BORDONE)        (Pronounced Jot-to)    _Florentine School_    1276-1337    _Pupil of Cimabue_    Giotto painted upon wood, and in \"distemper\"--the mixture of colour  with egg or some other jelly-like substance. We know nothing of his  childhood except that he was a shepherd, as we learn from a story told  of him and his teacher, Cimabue.    The story runs that one day while Giotto was watching his sheep, high  up on a mountain, Cimabue was walking abroad to study nature, and he  ran across a shepherd boy who was drawing the figure of a sheep, with  a piece of slate upon a stone. In those days we can imagine how rare  it was to find one who could draw anything, ever so rudely.  Immediately Cimabue saw a chance to make an artist and he asked the  little shepherd if he would like to be taught art in his studio.  Giotto was overjoyed at the opportunity, and at once he left the  mountains for the town, the shepherd's crook for the brush.    In those days the studio of one like Cimabue was really a workshop.  Artists had to grind their own colours, prepare their own panels upon  which to paint, and do a hundred other things of a workman rather than  an artist kind in connection with their painting. Such a studio was  crowded with apprentices--boys who did these jobs while learning from  the master. Their teaching consisted in watching the artist and now  and then receiving advice from him.    It was into such a shop as this, in Florence, that Giotto went, and  soon he was to become greater than his master. Even so, we cannot  think him great, excepting for his time, because his pictures,  compared with later art, are crude, stiff, and strange.    No pupil was permitted to use a brush till he had learned all the  craft of colour grinding and the like, and this was supposed to take  about six years. These workshops were likely to be dull, gloomy  places, and only a strong desire to do such things as they saw their  master doing, would induce a boy to persevere through the first  drudgery of the work. Giotto persevered, and not only became an  original painter, at a time when even Cimabue hardly made figures  appear human in outline, but he designed the great Campanile in  Florence, and he saw it partly finished before he died. The Campanile  is a wonder of architecture, but Giotto's Madonnas had to be improved  upon, as certainly as he had improved upon those of Cimabue.    There are many amusing stories of Giotto, mainly telling of his good  nature, and his ugly appearance, which everyone forgot in appreciation  of his truly kind heart. Once a visit was made to his studio by the  King of Naples, after the artist had become famous. Giotto was  painting busily, though the day was very hot. The King entered, and  bade Giotto not to be disturbed but to continue his work, adding:  \"Still, if I were you, I should not paint in such hot weather.\" Giotto  looked up with a laugh in his eye: \"Neither would I--if I were you,  Sire!\" he answered.    There is a famous saying: \"As round as Giotto's \"O,\" and this is how  it came about. The pope wanted the best of the Florentine artists to  do some work in Rome for him and he sent out to them for examples of  their work. When the pope's messenger came to Giotto the artist was  very busy. When asked for some of his work to show the pope, he  paused, snatched a piece of paper and with the brush he had been  using, which was full of red paint, he hurriedly drew a circle and  gave it to the messenger who stared at him.    \"But--is this _all_?\" he asked.    \"All--yes--and too much. Put it with the others.\" This perfect circle  and the account the messenger gave of his visit so delighted the pope  that Giotto was chosen from all the Florentine artists to decorate the  Roman buildings.    Thus Giotto worked till he was fifty-seven or eight years old when he  put aside his brush and turned to sculpture and architecture. Meantime  he had far outstripped his master in art. The arrangement of the  groups is about the same, but the figures look human and the draperies  are more natural, while he gives the appearance of length, breadth,  and thickness to his thrones and enclosures. We shall not choose a  Madonna for illustration, but another of Giotto's masterpieces,  remembering that good as he was in his time, he seems amazingly bad  compared with those who came after him.      PLATE--THE MEETING OF ST. JOHN AND ST. ANNA AT JERUSALEM.    In 1303 a certain Enrico Scrovegno had a private chapel built in the  Arena at Padua and he sent for Giotto to come there and adorn the  whole of its walls and ceiling with frescoes. These remain, though the  chapel is now emptied of all else, and they suffice to bring scores of  art-lovers to Padua. The picture here reproduced represents the  meeting and reconciliation between the father and mother of the Virgin  before her birth. The peculiarly shaped eyes and eyebrows that Giotto  gives to all his characters are specially noteworthy here as in every  one of the thirty-eight frescoes. There are three rows of pictures,  one above the other and in them are portrayed the principal scenes in  the lives of Christ and the Virgin. The painter here reached his  high-water mark, showed the very best he could produce in sincere,  restrained art.          XIX    FRANZ HALS        _Dutch School_    1580-04-1666    _Pupil of Karel Van Mander_    Franz Hals belonged to a family which for two hundred years had been  highly respected in Haarlem in the Netherlands. The father of the  painter left that town for political reasons in 1579, and it was at  Antwerp that Franz was born sometime between that date and 1585. His  parents took him back to Haarlem as an infant, and that is the town  with which his name and fame are most closely associated.    Little is known of his early life except that he began his studies  with Karel Van Mander and Cornelis Cornelissen. What we know of his  family life is not to his credit. In the parish register of 1611 is  recorded the birth of a son to Franz Hals and five years later he is  on the public records for abusing his wife, who died shortly  afterward. He married again within a year and the second wife bore him  many children and survived him ten years. Five of his seven sons  became painters.    Franz Hals drank too much and mixed too freely with the kind of  disreputable people he loved to paint, but he never became so degraded  that his hand lost its cunning, or his eye its keen vision for that  which he wished to portray. In 1644, he was made a director of the  Guild of St. Lucas, an institution for the protection of arts and  crafts in Haarlem, but from that time onward he sank in popular  esteem, deservedly. He fell into debt, then into pauperism, and when  he died, about the age of eighty-six, he was buried at public expense  in the choir of St. Bavon Church in Haarlem.    It was in the year 1616 that Hals first became known as a master of  his art by the painting of the St. Jovis Shooting Company, one of the  clubs composed of volunteers banded together for the defence of the  town should occasion arise. Such guilds were common throughout  Holland, and they became a favourite subject with Hals, as with other  painters of the time, who vied with one"]]]
