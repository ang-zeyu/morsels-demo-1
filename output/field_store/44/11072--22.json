[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],[0,"An Egyptian Princess â€” Complete (#17)"],[1,".\"    \"But, by our father Zeus, and by Apollo--\"    \"Yes, I understand thy indignation and I share it; but every position  has its duties, and as a king of a people who venerate tradition as the  highest divinity, I must submit, at least in the main, to the ceremonies  handed down through thousands of years. Were I to burst these fetters,  I know positively that at my death my body would remain unburied; for,  know that the priests sit in judgment over every corpse, and deprive the  condemned of rest, even in the grave.\"       [This well-known custom among the ancient Egyptians is confirmed,     not only by many Greek narrators, but by the laboriously erased     inscriptions discovered in the chambers of some tombs.]    \"Why care about the grave?\" cried Croesus, becoming angry. \"We live for  life, not for death!\"    \"Say rather,\" answered Amasis rising from his seat, \"we, with our Greek  minds, believe a beautiful life to be the highest good. But Croesus, I  was begotten and nursed by Egyptian parents, nourished on Egyptian food,  and though I have accepted much that is Greek, am still, in my innermost  being, an Egyptian. What has been sung to us in our childhood, and  praised as sacred in our youth, lingers on in the heart until the day  which sees us embalmed as mummies. I am an old man and have but a short  span yet to run, before I reach the landmark which separates us from  that farther country. For the sake of life's few remaining days, shall  I willingly mar Death's thousands of years? No, my friend, in this point  at least I have remained an Egyptian, in believing, like the rest of  my countrymen, that the happiness of a future life in the kingdom of  Osiris, depends on the preservation of my body, the habitation of the  soul.       [Each human soul was considered as a part of the world-soul Osiris,     was united to him after the death of the body, and thenceforth took     the name of Osiris. The Egyptian Cosmos consisted of the three     great realms, the Heavens, the Earth and the Depths. Over the vast     ocean which girdles the vault of heaven, the sun moves in a boat or     car drawn by the planets and fixed stars. On this ocean too the     great constellations circle in their ships, and there is the kingdom     of the blissful gods, who sit enthroned above this heavenly ocean     under a canopy of stars. The mouth of this great stream is in the     East, where the sun-god rises from the mists and is born again as a     child every morning. The surface of the earth is inhabited by human     beings having a share in the three great cosmic kingdoms. They     receive their soul from the heights of heaven, the seat and source     of light; their material body is of the earth; and the appearance or     outward form by which one human being is distinguished from another     at sight--his phantom or shadow--belongs to the depths. At death,     soul, body, and shadow separate from one another. The soul to     return to the place from whence it came, to Heaven, for it is a part     of God (of Osiris); the body, to be committed to the earth from     which it was formed in the image of its creator; the phantom or     shadow, to descend into the depths, the kingdom of shadows. The     gate to this kingdom was placed in the West among the sunset hills,     where the sun goes down daily,--where he dies. Thence arise the     changeful and corresponding conceptions connected with rising and     setting, arriving and departing, being born and dying. The careful     preservation of the body after death from destruction, not only     through the process of inward decay, but also through violence or     accident, was in the religion of ancient Egypt a principal condition     (perhaps introduced by the priests on sanitary grounds) on which     depended the speedy deliverance of the soul, and with this her     early, appointed union with the source of Light and Good, which two     properties were, in idea, one and indivisible. In the Egyptian     conceptions the soul was supposed to remain, in a certain sense,     connected with the body during a long cycle of solar years. She     could, however, quit the body from time to time at will, and could     appear to mortals in various forms and places; these appearances     differed according to the hour, and were prescribed in exact words     and delineations.]    \"But enough of these matters; thou wilt find it difficult to enter into  such thoughts. Tell me rather what thou thinkest of our temples and  pyramids.\"    Croesus, after reflecting a moment, answered with a smile: \"Those huge  pyramidal masses of stone seem to me creations of the boundless desert,  the gaily painted temple colonnades to be the children of the Spring;  but though the sphinxes lead up to your temple gates, and seem to point  the way into the very shrines themselves, the sloping fortress-like  walls of the Pylons, those huge isolated portals, appear as if placed  there to repel entrance. Your many-colored hieroglyphics likewise  attract the gaze, but baffle the inquiring spirit by the mystery that  lies within their characters. The images of your manifold gods are  everywhere to be seen; they crowd on our gaze, and yet who knows not  that their real is not their apparent significance? that they are mere  outward images of thoughts accessible only to the few, and, as I have  heard, almost incomprehensible in their depth? My curiosity is excited  everywhere, and my interest awakened, but my warm love of the beautiful  feels itself in no way attracted. My intellect might strain to penetrate  the secrets of your sages, but my heart and mind can never be at home in  a creed which views life as a short pilgrimage to the grave, and death  as the only true life!\"    \"And yet,\" said Amasis, \"Death has for us too his terrors, and we do all  in our power to evade his grasp. Our physicians would not be celebrated  and esteemed as they are, if we did not believe that their skill could  prolong our earthly existence. This reminds me of the oculist Nebenchari  whom I sent to Susa, to the king. Does he maintain his reputation? is  the king content with him?\"    \"Very much so,\" answered Croesus. \"He has been of use to many of the  blind; but the king's mother is alas! still sightless. It was Nebenchari  who first spoke to Cambyses of the charms of thy daughter Tachot. But we  deplore that he understands diseases of the eye alone. When the Princess  Atossa lay ill of fever, he was not to be induced to bestow a word of  counsel.\"    \"That is very natural; our physicians are only permitted to treat one  part of the body. We have aurists, dentists and oculists, surgeons for  fractures of the bone, and others for internal diseases. By the ancient  priestly law a dentist is not allowed to treat a deaf man, nor a surgeon  for broken bones a patient who is suffering from a disease of the  bowels, even though he should have a first rate knowledge of internal  complaints. This law aims at securing a great degree of real and  thorough knowledge; an aim indeed, pursued by the priests (to whose  caste the physicians belong) with a most praiseworthy earnestness in all  branches of science. Yonder lies the house of the high-priest Neithotep,  whose knowledge of astronomy and geometry was so highly praised, even  by Pythagoras. It lies next to the porch leading into the temple of  the goddess Neith, the protectress of Sais. Would I could show thee the  sacred grove with its magnificent trees, the splendid pillars of the  temple with capitals modelled from the lotus-flower, and the colossal  chapel which I caused to be wrought from a single piece of granite, as  an offering to the goddess; but alas! entrance is strictly refused to  strangers by the priests. Come, let us seek my wife and daughter; they  have conceived an affection for thee, and indeed it is my wish that thou  shouldst gain a friendly feeling towards this poor maiden before she  goes forth with thee to the strange land, and to the strange nation  whose princess she is to become. Wilt thou not adopt and take her under  thy care?\"    \"On that thou may'st with fullest confidence rely,\" replied Croesus  with warmth, returning the pressure of Amasis' hand. \"I will protect  thy Nitetis as if I were her father; and she will need my help, for the  apartments of the women in the Persian palaces are dangerous ground. But  she will meet with great consideration. Cambyses may be contented with  his choice, and will be highly gratified that thou hast entrusted him  with thy fairest child. Nebenchari had only spoken of Tachot, thy second  daughter.\"    \"Nevertheless I will send my beautiful Nitetis. Tachot is so tender,  that she could scarcely endure the fatigues of the journey and the pain  of separation. Indeed were I to follow the dictates of my own heart,  Nitetis should never leave us for Persia. But Egypt stands in need of  peace, and I was a king before I became a father!\"          CHAPTER V.    The other members of the Persian embassy had returned to Sais from their  excursion up the Nile to the pyramids. Prexaspes alone, the ambassador  from Cambyses, had already set out for Persia, in order to inform the  king of the successful issue of his suit.    The palace of Amasis was full of life and stir. The huge building  was filled in all parts by the followers of the embassy, nearly three  hundred in number, and by the high guests themselves, to whom every  possible attention was paid. The courts of the palace swarmed with  guards and officials, with young priests and slaves, all in splendid  festal raiment.    On this day it was the king's intention to make an especial display of  the wealth and splendor of his court, at a festival arranged in honor of  his daughter's betrothal.    The lofty reception-hall opening on to the gardens, with its ceiling  sown with thousands of golden stars and supported by gaily-painted  columns, presented a magic appearance. Lamps of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5529"],[0,"The Bride of the Nile â€” Complete (#17)"],[1,"had already given him in  her nurse's room.    The faithful soul had no sooner left his beloved mistress than she  proceeded to unplait her long thick hair, smiling the while with happy  hope; but she had not yet begun to undress when she heard a knock. She  started, flew to the door and hastily bolted it, while she enquired:    \"Who is there?\"--preparing herself for the worst. \"Hiram,\" was the  whispered reply. She opened the door, and he told her that meanwhile the  side door had been locked, and that he knew no other way out from the  great rambling house whither he rarely had occasion to come.    What was to be done? He could not wait till the door was opened again,  for he must carry out her commission quite early in the morning, and if  he were caught and locked up for only half the day the Nabathaean would  take some other engagement.    With swift decision she twisted up her hair, threw a handkerchief over  her head, and said: \"Then come with me; the moon is still up; it would  not be safe to carry a lamp. I will lead the way and you must keep  behind me If only the kitchen is empty, we can reach the Viridarium  unseen. If the upper servants are still sitting in the court-yard the  great door will be open, for several of them sleep in the house. At any  rate you must go through the vestibule; you cannot miss your way out  of the viridarium. But stay! Beki generally lies in front of the  tablinum--the fierce dog from Herrionthis in Thebais; and he does not  know you, for he never goes out of the house, but he will obey me.    \"When I lift my hand, hang back a little. He is quite quiet with his  masters, and does not hurt a stranger if they are by. Now, we must not  utter another word.--If we are discovered, I will confess the truth; if  you alone are seen, you can say--well, say you were waiting for Orion,  to speak to him very early about the horse-fair at Niku.\"    \"A horse was off--off--offered me for sale this very day.\"    \"Good, very good; then you lingered in the vestibule to speak of  that--to ask the master about it before he should go out. It must be  daylight in a few hours.--Now, come.\"    Paula went down the stairs with a sure and rapid step. At the bottom  Hiram again took off his shoes, holding them in his hand, so as to lose  no time in following his mistress. They went on in silence through the  darkness till they reached the kitchen. Here Paula turned and said to  the Syrian:    \"If there is any one here, I will say I came to fetch some water; if  there is no one I will cough and you can follow. At any rate I will  leave the door open, and then you will hear what happens. If I am  obliged to return, do you hurry on before me back by the way we came. In  that case I will return to my room where you must wait outside till  the side door is opened again, and if you are found there leave the  explanation to me.--Shrink back, quite into that corner.\"    She softly opened the door into the kitchen; the roof was open to the  light of the declining moon and myriad stars. The room was quite empty:  only a cat lay on a bench by the wide hearth, and a few bats flitted  to and fro on noiseless wings; a few live coals still glowed among the  ashes under the spits, like the eyes of lurking beasts of prey. Paula  coughed gently, and immediately heard Hiram's step behind her; then,  with a beating heart and agonizing fears, she proceeded on her way.  First down a few steps, then through a dark passage, where the bats in  their unswerving flight shot by close to her head. At last they had  to cross the large, open dining-hall. This led into the viridarium, a  spacious quadrangle, paved at the edges and planted in the middle, where  a fountain played; round this square the Governor's residence was built.  All was still and peaceful in this secluded space, vaulted over by the  high heavens whose deep blue was thickly dotted with stars. The moon  would soon be hidden behind the top of the cornice which crowned the  roof of the building. The large-leaved plants in the middle of the  quadrangle threw strange, ghostly shadows on the dewy grass-plot; the  water in the fountain splashed more loudly than by day, but with a  soothing, monotonous gurgle, broken now and then by a sudden short  pause. The marble pillars gleamed as white as snow, and filmy mists,  which were beginning to rise from the damp lawn, floated languidly  hither and thither on the soft night breeze, like ghosts veiled in  flowing crape. Moths flitted noiselessly round and over the clumps of  bushes, and the whole quiet and restful enclosure was full of sweetness  from the Lotos flowers in the marble basin, from the blossoms of the  luxuriant shrubs and the succulent tropical herbs at their feet. At any  other time it would have been a joy to pause and look round, only to  breathe and let the silent magic of the night exert its spell; but  Paula's soul was closed against these charms. The sequestered silence  lent a threatening accent to the furious wrangling in the court-yard,  which was audible even here in bursts of uproar; and it was with an  anxious heart that she observed that everything was not in its usual  order; for her sharp eyes could discern no one, nothing, at the entrance  to the tablinum, which was usually guarded by an armed sentinel or by  the watch-dog; and surely--yes, she was not mistaken--the bronze doors  were open, and the moon shone on the bright metal of one half which  stood ajar.    She stopped, and Hiram behind her did the same. They both listened with  such tension that the veins in their foreheads swelled; but from the  tablinum, which was hardly thirty paces from them, came only very faint  and intermittent sounds, indistinct in character and drowned by the  tumult without.    A few long and anxious minutes, and then the half-closed door was  suddenly opened and a man came forth. Paula's heart stood still, but  she did not for an instant lose her keenness of vision; she at once and  positively recognized the man who came out of the tablinum as Orion  and none other, and the big, long-haired dog too came out and past him,  sniffed the air and then, with a loud bark, rushed on the two watchers.  Trembling and with clenched teeth, but still mistress of herself, she  let him come close to her, and then, calling him by his name: \"Beki\" in  low, caressing tones, as soon as he recognized her, she laid her hand on  his shaggy head to scratch his ears, as he loved it done.    Paula and her companion were standing behind a column in the deepest  shadow. Thus Orion could not see her, and the dog's loud bark had  prevented his hearing her coaxing call; so when Beki was quiet and stood  still, Orion whistled to him. The obedient and watchful beast, ran  back, wagging his tail; and his master, greeting him as \"a stupid old  cat-hunter,\" let him spring over his arm, hugged the creature and then  pushed him off again in play. Then he closed the door and went into the  apartments leading to the courtyard.    \"But he must come back this way to go to his own rooms,\" said Paula to  her companion with a sigh of relief. \"We must wait. But now we must not  lose a minute. Come over to the door of the tablinum. The dog will know  me now and will not bark again.\" They hastened on, and when they had  reached the door, which lay in shadow within a deep doorway, Paula asked  her companion: \"Did you see who the man was who came out?\"    \"My lord Orion,\" said Hiram. \"He was co--co--coming home from the town  when I preceded you across the yard.\"    \"Indeed?\" she said with apparent indifference, and as she leaned against  the cold metal door-panels she looked back into the garden and thought  she was now free to return. She would describe to the freedman the way  he must now go--it was quite simple; but she had not had time to do so  when, from a room dividing the viridarium from the vestibule she heard  first a woman's shrill voice; then the deeper tones of a man; and hardly  had they exchanged a few sentences, when every sound was lost in the  furious barking of the hound, and immediately after a loud shriek of  pain from a woman fell upon her ear, and the noise of a heavy object  falling to the ground.    What had happened? It must be something portentous and terrible; of that  there could be no doubt; and ere long Paula's fears were justified. Out  from the room where the scene had taken place rushed Orion, and with him  the dog, across the grass-plot which was usually respected and cherished  as holy ground, towards the side of the house facing the river, which  was where he and all the family had their rooms.    \"Now!\" cried Paula, quickly leading the way.    She flew in breathless haste through the first room and into the  unguarded hall; but she had not reached the middle of it when she gave a  scream, for before her in the moonlight, lay a body, motionless, at full  length, on the hard, marble floor.    \"Run, Hiram, fly!\" she cried to her companion. \"The door is  ajar--open--I can see it is.\"    She fell on her knees by the side of the lifeless form, raised the head,  and saw--the beautiful, deathlike face of the crazy Persian slave. She  felt her hand wet with the blood that had soaked the hapless girl's  thick, fair hair, and she shuddered; but she resisted her impulse of  horror and loathing, and perceiving some dark stains on the torn peplos  she pulled it aside and saw that the white bosom was bleeding from deep  wounds made in the tender flesh by the cruel fangs of the hound.    Paula's heart thrilled with indignation, grief and pity. He--he whom  she had only yesterday held to be the epitome of every manly  perfection--Orion, was guilty of so foul a deed! He, of whose  unflinching, dauntless courage she had heard so much, had fled like a  coward, and had left the victim to her fate--twice a victim to him!    But something must be done besides lamenting and raging, and wondering  how in one human soul there could be room "]]]
