But these, it must be remembered, were fairly far apart, and loopholes of  necessity were many. At all these points the British, lynx-eyed, furious  at being given the slip by De Wet, crouched. General Hunter himself  observed Retief's Nek, while General Bruce Hamilton barred Golden Gate,  and Generals Paget and Rundle took up positions watching Stabbert's and  Commando Neks respectively.    To appreciate the nicety of the movement a glance at the map is  necessary. The geographical nature of the situation in which the Boers  found themselves after the battle of Bethlehem was thus concisely  sketched by Mr. Spenser Wilkinson:--         \"The Boers were holding a great mountain horse-shoe, of which       the curved end is at the north, and the open end or back is on       the Caledon River, the inside of the shoe being the basin of       the Brandwater. On the right-hand limb of the shoe at the       second nail from the end is Fouriesburg, and Retief's Nek is at       the top right-hand nail, the road from Ficksburg to Bethlehem       going up the Brandwater valley and over Retief's Nek.         \"Outside the horse-shoe to the right, the east, the road from       Fouriesburg to Harrismith goes by the Little Caledon River,       which is separated by a long east and west range of hills from       the hilly plain of Bethlehem. North of this range is       Naauwpoort, and from the Caledon Valley to Naauwpoort the road       crosses over Naauwpoort's Nek and goes on to Harrismith on the       north side of the range.\"    Having blocked the passes to the best of his ability, General Hunter  hoped for the best. He knew the Boers might evaporate--as they seemed so  magically to do--over the mountains, but he guessed, and guessed rightly,  that it would be too much of a wrench to tear themselves from their  effects--horses, oxen, carts, and waggons--and these could never be  dragged over the barring acclivities.    The first attack on Retief's Nek was made on the 23rd by General  MacDonald, the Highland Brigade, Lovat's Scouts, Remington's Guides, and  a battery and two 5-inch \"cow\"-guns. The Boers had previously been thrown  off the scent owing to the British troops having taken a wide detour, and  they were somewhat surprised in their rocky caves to find themselves in  the thick of lyddite, which growled and crashed and fumed at them. Then  the Highland Light Infantry, with the Sussex to help them, deployed, the  former bearing to left, the latter, with the 81st Battery of Field  Artillery, to right, the Infantry making brilliant rushes towards the  impregnable lair of the enemy, despite the murderous jets from the rifles  of the Dutchmen, which spouted disaster the nearer they approached. Each  battalion lost thirty men or so, but brilliant and inexhaustible as they  were, found themselves unable, on the initial day, to push the attack.  The Black Watch were more fortunate, however, and gallantly carving their  passage with the bayonet, managed before nightfall to secure a foothold  on the summit of the hills whence they could now await the morrow. At  that time General Clements's Yeomanry were attempting to force the  passage of Stabbert's Nek, gaining ground with difficulty, but clinging  to it all night in a perilous position; while on the south-western fringe  General Rundle demonstrated in the region of Commando Nek. The morning  brought success all round. Stabbert's Nek was forced by the renewed and  sturdy efforts of the Yeomanry and the Royal Irish, and the afternoon of  the 24th found the combined columns camped inside the Nek. The Boers,  quickly recognising the inconvenience of their position, by noon had  stampeded towards the east, hoping to cut through Naauwpoort's Nek and  gain the Harrismith Road, galloping off, however, with the sagacity of  purpose for which at all times they had made themselves notable.    The losses so far were sufficiently large, but considering the importance  of the position gained they were looked upon as insignificant, and  General Hunter formally expressed the opinion that it was owing to the  excellent work done by Lovat's Scouts, who for days in advance had  scouted, stalked, and \"spied\" over the country, that so few losses were  recorded.    The casualties at Stabbert's Nek were:--         _Killed_:--1st Royal Irish Regiment--Captain W. Gloster.       _Wounded_:--Royal Field Artillery--Captain H. E. T. Kelly. 2nd       Wiltshire Regiment--Captain E. Evans. 6th Company Imperial       Yeomanry--Lieutenant G. A. Clay. 1st Royal Irish       Regiment--Captain E. F. Milner.    Those at Retief's Nek were:--         _Wounded_:--Royal Sussex--Captain E. L. M'Kenzie, Second       Lieutenant J. C. W. Anderson, Second Lieutenant H. G.       Montgomerie, Second Lieutenant G. E. Leachman. 2nd Royal       Highlanders--Major E. M. Wiltshire (since dead), Lieutenant H.       K. Smith. Captain Sir W. G. Barttelot, 2nd Volunteer Battalion,       Royal Sussex Regiment, was killed.    The 25th found Generals Hunter, Clements, and Paget in possession of  Brandwater Basin, while Generals MacDonald and Bruce Hamilton were  blocking Inguwooni and Golden Gate. Fouriesburg was occupied by the  Eighth Division, and there they found a number of British prisoners and  Mrs. Steyn, who was left in charge of the chief of the Commissariat  Department. Generals Hunter and Rundle paid the lady a complimentary  visit. On the following day General MacDonald, who had kept an eye on  Naauwpoort's Nek and Golden Gate, had a hard day's fighting outside  Naauwpoort in the Bethlehem Hills, but the effect of this doughty  rearguard action was the blocking of Naauwpoort's Nek for the Boer waggon  traffic, and without their precious carts the Boers were \"winged.\"    Among the wounded were Lieutenant A. M. Brodie, Lovat's Scouts, and  Lieutenant W. E. Campion, Mounted Infantry Company, East Yorkshire  Regiment.    On the 28th, Hunter, with Clements's and Paget's Brigades, attacked the  Boers, who were posted on two neks. The first nek, after a vigorous  fight, was secured by the Royal Irish, Wiltshire, and Leicester  Regiments; the final position, Slaapkrantz, later on and under cover of  the dusk, by the brilliant dash of the Scots Guards. During the  operations Lieutenant Hon. R. B. F. Robertson, 1st Battalion  Imperial Yeomanry (Machine Gun Section), and Second Lieutenant F. G.  Alston, 2nd Scots Guards, were wounded.    [Illustration: THE SURRENDER OF PRINSLOO'S FORCE AT THE CALEDON RIVER    Drawing by Ernest Prater, from a Sketch by Major Romilly, D.S.O.,  Commanding 2nd Scots Guards]    The net result of all the combined blockage of the passes was a demand on  Sunday morning, 29th, from Prinsloo, under a flag of truce, for a four  days' armistice in order to enter into peace negotiations. As this demand  was tantamount to saying, \"Hold on while I get wind for another bout,\"  General Hunter sent a message refusing to enter into any negotiations,  and saying that the only terms he could accept was unconditional  surrender. Until these were complied with, hostilities could not cease.  This settled the matter. Prinsloo, knowing it was impossible to get his  guns and waggons over the mountains, forthwith handed himself over--arms,  ammunition, and the rest of his warlike impedimenta--to the conqueror.  With him were Villiers and Crowther and about 1000 men, but other Boer  leaders, Olivier among them, who had succeeded in slipping to the farther  side of the hills, refused to abide their chief's ruling, and declined to  submit. Hostilities in respect to these malcontents had consequently to  be resumed, but the surrender of Prinsloo, and with him the Ficksburg  commando of some 550 men and the Ladybrand commando, about 450 strong,  together with 1500 horses, three guns, two of which were our own, lost at  Koorn Spruit, 50 waggons and 50 carts, may be considered as the closing  scene of the Free Stater's resistance.    The finale at Fouriesburg was an impressive affair. The Generals, their  staffs, Sir Godfrey and Lady Lagden from Basutoland, grouped on  horseback, were surrounded by the troops drawn up in two lines on the  hills overlooking the valley. Between the lines thus made rode Prinsloo,  tall, fair--even prepossessing. He handed up his rifle to the General,  setting the example to his followers, an agriculturalist rabble, motley  of mien as of habit, who, on their small, nimble ponies, galloped up,  throwing down rifle and bandolier with a certain effort at swagger,  though seemingly nothing loth to finish their fighting career. In cart  and waggon they came, too, with all their curious nomadic luggage and  blankets, cook-pots and the like, some laughing, and some chaffing as  they gave up arms and ammunition, and then moved on to the camp of  Brabant's Colonials, with whom they soon got on the best of terms. The  formalities occupied three days, the haul of cattle that were hidden in  the neighbouring gorges being enormous. The condition of the captured  Boer horses contrasted strangely with that of the dilapidated hacks which  now remained to the British force, and, as may be imagined, remounts were  more than acceptable.    July ended with a triumphant flourish of trumpets in honour of the united  labours of, first, General Sir Leslie Rundle, who may claim the east of  the Orange Colony as his military perquisite, and finally General Sir  Archibald Hunter. Prinsloo's surrender was followed by that of 1200 more  Free Staters, and the Commandants Roux and Fonternel. To General Bruce  Hamilton came Commandants Deploy, Potgieter, and Joubert, and Lieutenant  Alderson, a Danish officer of Staats Artillery, and with them 1200  rifles, 650 ponies, and an Armstrong gun.    The Free State army was therefore only represented by De Wet and his  followers--some 1500--who were hovering in the neighbourhood of the Vaal,  and Olivier, who, having refused to consider himself bound by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4633"],[0,"Philip Steele of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (#17)"],[1,"to the fire. It was a small fire, burning more  brightly as he looked, and he longed to throw himself upon it so that  the flames might eat into his flesh. He had mumbled something about  police, arrest and murder during the struggle, but DeBar spoke for the  first time now.    \"You're cold,\" he said.    \"I'm freezing to death,\" said Philip.    \"And I'm--starving.\"    DeBar rose to his feet. Philip drew himself together, as if expecting an  attack, but in place of it DeBar held out a warmly mittened hand.    \"You've got to get those clothes off--quick--or you'll die,\" he said.  \"Here!\"    Mechanically Philip reached up his hand, and DeBar took him to his  sledge behind the fire and wrapped about him a thick blanket. Then he  drew out a sheath knife and ripped the frozen legs of his trousers up  and the sleeves of his coat down, cut the string of his shoe-packs and  slit his heavy German socks, and after that he rubbed his feet and legs  and arms until Philip began to feel a sting like the prickly bite of  nettles.    \"Ten minutes more and you'd been gone,\" said DeBar.    He wrapped a second blanket around Philip, and dragged the sledge on  which he was lying still nearer to the fire. Then he threw on a fresh  armful of dry sticks and from a pocket of his coat drew forth something  small and red and frozen, which was the carcass of a bird about the  size of a robin. DeBar held it up between his forefinger and thumb, and  looking at Philip, the flash of a smile passed for an instant over his  grizzled face.    \"Dinner,\" he said, and Philip could not fail to catch the low chuckling  note of humor in his voice. \"It's a Whisky Jack, man, an' he's the first  and last living thing I've seen in the way of fowl between here and Fond  du Lac. He weighs four ounces if he weighs an ounce, and we'll feast  on him shortly. I haven't had a full mouth of grub since day before  yesterday morning, but you're welcome to a half of him, if you're hungry  enough.\"    \"Where'd your chuck go?\" asked Philip.    He was conscious of a new warmth and comfort in his veins, but it was  not this that sent a heat into his face at the outlaw's offer. DeBar  had saved his life, and now, when DeBar might have killed him, he was  offering him food. The man was spitting the bird on the sharpened end  of a stick, and when he had done this he pointed to the big Mackenzie  hound, tied to the broken stub of a dead sapling.    \"I brought enough bannock to carry me to Chippewayan, but he got into  it the first night, and what he left was crumbs. You lost yours in the  lake, eh?\"    \"Dogs and everything,\" said Philip. \"Even matches.\"    \"Those ice-traps are bad,\" said DeBar companionably, slowly turning the  bird. \"You always want to test the lakes in this country. Most of 'em  come from bog springs, and after they freeze, the water drops. Guess  you'd had me pretty soon if it hadn't been for the lake, wouldn't you?\"    He grinned, and to his own astonishment Philip grinned.    \"I was tight after you, Bill.\"    \"Ho! ho! ho!\" laughed the outlaw. \"That sounds good! I've gone by  another name, of course, and that's the first time I've heard my own  since--\"    He stopped suddenly, and the laugh left his voice and face.    \"It sounds--homelike,\" he added more gently. \"What's yours, pardner?\"    \"Steele--Philip Steele, of the R.N.W.M.P.,\" said Philip.    \"Used to know a Steele once,\" went on DeBar. \"That was back--where it  happened. He was one of my friends.\"    For a moment he turned his eyes on Philip. They were deep gray eyes,  set well apart in a face that among a hundred others Philip would have  picked out for its frankness and courage. He knew that the man before  him was not much more than his own age, yet he appeared ten years older.    He sat up on his sledge as DeBar left his bird to thrust sticks into the  snow, on the ends of which he hung Philip's frozen garments close to the  fire. From the man Philip's eyes traveled to the dog. The hound yawned  in the heat and he saw that one of his fangs was gone.    \"If you're starving, why don't you kill the dog?\" he asked.    DeBar turned quickly, his white teeth gleaming through his beard.    \"Because he's the best friend I've got on earth, or next to the best,\"  he said warmly. \"He's stuck to me through thick and thin for ten years.  He starved with me, and fought with me, and half died with me, and he's  going to live with me as long as I live. Would you eat the flesh of your  brother, Steele? He's my brother--the last that your glorious law has  left to me. Would you kill him if you were me?\"    Something stuck hard and fast in Philip's throat, and he made no reply.  DeBar came toward him with the hot bird on the end of his stick. With  his knife the outlaw cut the bird into two equal parts, and one of these  parts he cut into quarters. One of the smaller pieces he tossed to the  hound, who devoured it at a gulp. The half he stuck on the end of his  knife and offered to his companion.    \"No,\" said Philip. \"I can't.\"    The eyes of the two men met, and DeBar, on his knees, slowly settled  back, still gazing at the bird, said DeBar, after a moment, \"don't be a  fool, Steele. Let's forget, for a little while. God knows what's going  to happen to both of us to-morrow or next day, and it'll be easier to  die with company than alone, won't it? Let's forget that you're the Law  and I'm the Man, and that I've killed one or two. We're both in the same  boat, and we might as well be a little bit friendly for a few hours, and  shake hands, and be at peace when the last minute comes. If we get out  of this, and find grub, we'll fight fair and square, and the best man  wins. Be square with me, old man, and I'll be square with you, s'elp me  God!\"    He reached out a hand, gnarled, knotted, covered with callouses and  scars, and with a strange sound in his throat Philip caught it tightly  in his own.    \"I'll be square. Bill!\" he cried. \"I swear that I'll be square--on those  conditions. If we find grub, and live, we'll fight it out--alone--and  the best man wins. But I've had food today, and you're starving. Eat  that and I'll still be in better condition than you. Eat it, and we'll  smoke. Praise God I've got my pipe and tobacco!\"    They settled back close in the lee of the drift, and the wind swirled  white clouds of snow-mist over their heads, while DeBar ate his bird and  Philip smoked. The food that went down DeBar's throat was only a morsel,  but it put new life into him, and he gathered fresh armfuls of sticks  and sapling boughs until the fire burned Philip's face and his drying  clothes sent up clouds of steam. Once, a hundred yards out in the plain,  Philip heard the outlaw burst into a snatch of wild forest song as he  pulled down a dead stub.    \"Seems good to have comp'ny,\" he said, when he came back with his load.  \"My God, do you know I've never felt quite like this--so easy and happy  like, since years and years? I wonder if it is because I know the end is  near?\"    \"There's still hope,\" replied Philip.    \"Hope!\" cried DeBar. \"It's more than hope, man. It's a certainty for  me--the end, I mean. Don't you see, Phil--\" He came and sat down close  to the other on the sledge, and spoke as if he had known him for  years. \"It's got to be the end for me, and I guess that's what makes me  cheerful like. I'm going to tell you about it, if you don't mind.\"    \"I don't mind; I want to hear,\" said Philip, and he edged a little  nearer, until they sat shoulder to shoulder.    \"It's got to be the end,\" repeated DeBar, in a low voice. \"If we get out  of this, and fight, and you win, it'll be because I'm dead, Phil. D'ye  understand? I'll be dead when the fight ends, if you win. That'll be one  end.\"    \"But if you win, Bill.\"    A flash of joy shot into DeBar's eyes.    \"Then that'll be the other end,\" he said more softly still. He pointed  to the big Mackenzie hound. \"I said he was next to my best friend  an earth, Phil. The other--is a girl--who lived back there--when it  happened, years and years ago. She's thirty now, and she's stuck to me,  and prayed for me, and believed in me for--a'most since we were kids  together, an' she's written to me--'Frank Symmonds'--once a month for  ten years. God bless her heart! That is what's kept me alive, and in  every letter she's begged me to let her come to me, wherever I was.  But--I guess the devil didn't get quite all of me, for I couldn't, 'n'  wouldn't. But I've give in now, and we've fixed it up between us. By  this time she's on her way to my brothers in South America, and if I  win--when we fight--I'm going where she is. And that's the other end,  Phil, so you see why I'm happy. There's sure to be an end of it for  me--soon.\"    He bowed his wild, unshorn head in his mittened hands, and for a time  there was silence between them.    Philip broke it, almost in a whisper.    \"Why don't you kill me--here--now-while I'm sitting helpless beside you,  and you've a knife in your belt?\"    DeBar lifted his head slowly and looked with astonishment into his  companion's face.    \"I'm not a murderer!\" he said.    \"But you've killed other men,\" persisted Philip.    \"Three, besides those we hung,\" replied DeBar calmly. \"One at Moose  Factory, when I tried to help John, and the other two up here. They  were like you--hunting me down, and I killed 'em in fair fight. Was that  murder? Should I stand by and be shot like an animal just because it's  the law that's doing it? Would you?\"    He rose without waiting for an answer and felt of the clothes beside the  fire.    \"Dry enough,\" he said. \"Put 'em on and we'll be hiking.\"    Philip dressed, and looked at his compass.    \"Still north?\" he asked. \"Chippewayan is south and west.\"    \"North,\" said DeBar. \"I know of a breed who lives on Red Porcupine  Creek, which runs into the Slave. If we can find him we'll get grub, and  if we don't--\"    He laughed openly into the other's face.    \"We won't fight,\" said Philip,"]]]
