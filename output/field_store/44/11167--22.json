Provided you walk cautiously and do not absolutely touch him, you may  pass in safety close by him. As he is often coiled up on the ground,  and amongst the branches of the trees above you, a degree of  circumspection is necessary lest you unwarily disturb him.    Tigers are too few, and too apt to fly before the noble face of man, to  require a moment of your attention.    The bite of the most noxious of the insects, at the very worst, only  causes a transient fever with a degree of pain more or less.    Birds in general, with a few exceptions, are not common in the very  remote parts of the forest. The sides of rivers, lakes and creeks, the  borders of savannas, the old abandoned habitations of Indians and  wood-cutters, seem to be their favourite haunts.    Though least in size, the glittering mantle of the humming-bird  entitles it to the first place in the list of the birds of the new  world. It may truly be called the bird of paradise: and had it existed  in the Old World, it would have claimed the title instead of the bird  which has now the honour to bear it. See it darting through the air  almost as quick as thought!--now it is within a yard of your face!--in  an instant gone!--now it flutters from flower to flower to sip the  silver dew--it is now a ruby--now a topaz --now an emerald--now all  burnished gold! It would be arrogant to pretend to describe this winged  gem of Nature after Buffon's elegant description of it.    Cayenne and Demerara produce the same hummingbirds. Perhaps you would  wish to know something of their haunts. Chiefly in the months of July  and August, the tree called bois immortel, very common in Demerara,  bears abundance of red blossom which stays on the tree for some weeks;  then it is that most of the different species of humming-birds are very  plentiful. The wild red sage is also their favourite shrub, and they  buzz like bees round the blossom of the wallaba tree. Indeed, there is  scarce a flower in the interior, or on the sea-coast, but what receives  frequent visits from one or other of the species.    On entering the forests, on the rising land in the interior, the blue  and green, the smallest brown, no bigger than the humble-bee, with two  long feathers in the tail, and the little forked-tail purple-throated  humming-birds, glitter before you in ever-changing attitudes. One  species alone never shows his beauty to the sun: and were it not for  his lovely shining colours, you might almost be tempted to class him  with the goat-suckers, on account of his habits. He is the largest of  all the humming-birds, and is all red and changing gold-green, except  the head, which is black. He has two long feathers in the tail which  cross each other, and these have gained him the name of karabimiti, or  ara humming-bird, from the Indians. You never find him on the  sea-coast, or where the river is salt, or in the heart of the forest,  unless fresh water be there. He keeps close by the side of woody  fresh-water rivers and dark and lonely creeks. He leaves his retreat  before sunrise to feed on the insects over the water; he returns to it  as soon as the sun's rays cause a glare of light, is sedentary all day  long, and comes out again for a short tune after sunset. He builds his  nest on a twig over the water in the unfrequented creeks: it looks like  tanned cow-leather.    As you advance towards the mountains of Demerara other species of  humming-birds present themselves before you. It seems to be an  erroneous opinion that the humming-bird lives entirely on honey-dew.  Almost every flower of the tropical climates contains insects of one  kind or other. Now the humming-bird is most busy about the flowers an  hour or two after sunrise and after a shower of rain, and it is just at  this time that the insects come out to the edge of the flower in order  that the sun's rays may dry the nocturnal dew and rain which they have  received. On opening the stomach of the humming-bird dead insects are  almost always found there.    Next to the humming-birds, the cotingas display the gayest plumage.  They are of the order of Passer, and you number five species betwixt  the sea-coast and the rock Saba. Perhaps the scarlet cotinga is the  richest of the five, and is one of those birds which are found in the  deepest recesses of the forest. His crown is flaming red; to this  abruptly succeeds a dark shining brown, reaching half-way down the  back: the remainder of the back, the rump and tail, the extremity of  which is edged with black, are a lively red; the belly is a somewhat  lighter red; the breast reddish-black; the wings brown. He has no song,  is solitary, and utters a monotonous whistle which sounds like \"quet.\"  He is fond of the seeds of the hitia-tree and those of the siloabali-  and bastard siloabali-trees, which ripen in December and continue on  the trees for above two months. He is found throughout the year in  Demerara; still nothing is known of his incubation. The Indians all  agree in telling you that they have never seen his nest.    The purple-breasted cotinga has the throat and breast of a deep purple,  the wings and tail black, and all the rest of the body a most lovely  shining blue.    The purple-throated cotinga has black wings and tail, and every other  part a light and glossy blue, save the throat, which is purple.    The pompadour cotinga is entirely purple, except his wings, which are  white, their four first feathers tipped with brown. The great coverts  of the wings are stiff, narrow and pointed, being shaped quite  different from those of any other bird. When you are betwixt this bird  and the sun, in his flight, he appears uncommonly brilliant. He makes a  hoarse noise which sounds like \"wallababa.\" Hence his name amongst the  Indians.    None of these three cotingas have a song. They feed on the hitia,  siloabali- and bastard siloabali-seeds, the wild guava, the fig, and  other fruit-trees of the forest. They are easily shot in these trees  during the months of December, January and part of February. The  greater part of them disappear after this, and probably retire far away  to breed. Their nests have never been found in Demerara.    The fifth species is the celebrated campanero of the Spaniards, called  dara by the Indians, and bell-bird by the English. He is about the size  of the jay. His plumage is white as snow. On his forehead rises a  spiral tube nearly three inches long. It is jet black, dotted all over  with small white feathers. It has a communication with the palate, and  when filled with air looks like a spire; when empty it becomes  pendulous. His note is loud and clear, like the sound of a bell, and  may be heard at the distance of three miles. In the midst of these  extensive wilds, generally on the dried top of an aged mora, almost out  of gun-reach, you will see the campanero. No sound or song from any of  the winged inhabitants of the forest, not even the clearly pronounced  \"Whip-poor-will\" from the goat-sucker, cause such astonishment as the  toll of the campanero.    With many of the feathered race he pays the common tribute of a morning  and an evening song; and even when the meridian sun has shut in silence  the mouths of almost the whole of animated nature the campanero still  cheers the forest. You hear his toll, and then a pause for a minute,  then another toll, and then a pause again, and then a toll, and again a  pause. Then he is silent for six or eight minutes, and then another  toll, and so on. Acteon would stop in mid-chase, Maria would defer her  evening song, and Orpheus himself would drop his lute to listen to him,  so sweet, so novel and romantic is the toll of the pretty snow-white  campanero. He is never seen to feed with the other cotingas, nor is it  known in what part of Guiana he makes his nest.    While the cotingas attract your attention by their superior plumage,  the singular form of the toucan makes a lasting impression on your  memory. There are three species of toucans in Demerara, and three  diminutives, which may be called toucanets. The largest of the first  species frequents the mangrove trees on the sea-coast. He is never seen  in the interior till you reach Macoushia, where he is found in the  neighbourhood of the River Tacatou. The other two species are very  common. They feed entirely on the fruits of the forest and, though of  the pie kind, never kill the young of other birds or touch carrion. The  larger is called bouradi by the Indians (which means nose), the other  scirou. They seem partial to each other's company, and often resort to  the same feeding-tree and retire together to the same shady noon-day  retreat. They are very noisy in rainy weather at all hours of the day,  and in fair weather at morn and eve. The sound which the bouradi makes  is like the clear yelping of a puppy-dog, and you fancy he says  \"pia-po-o-co,\" and thus the South-American Spaniards call him piapoco.    All the toucanets feed on the same trees on which the toucan feeds, and  every species of this family of enormous bill lays its eggs in the  hollow trees. They are social, but not gregarious. You may sometimes  see eight or ten in company, and from this you would suppose they are  gregarious; but upon a closer examination you will find it has only  been a dinner-party, which breaks up and disperses towards  roosting-time.    You will be at a loss to conjecture for what ends Nature has overloaded  the head of this bird with such an enormous bill. It cannot be for the  offensive, as it has no need to wage war with any of the tribes of  animated nature, for its food is fruits and seeds, and those are in  superabundance throughout the whole year in the regions where the  toucan is found. It can hardly be for the defensive, as the toucan is  preyed upon by no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8172"],[0,"History of Astronomy (#17)"],[1,"evident  that, when he wrote these notes, _Newton's mathematics were a little  rusty_.\"    [3] _R.

THE PHYSICAL PERIOD      We have seen how the theory of the solar system was slowly developed  by the constant efforts of the human mind to find out what are the  rules of cause and effect by which our conception of the present  universe and its development seems to be bound. In the primitive ages  a mere record of events in the heavens and on the earth gave the only  hope of detecting those uniform sequences from which to derive rules  or laws of cause and effect upon which to rely. Then came the  geometrical age, in which rules were sought by which to predict the  movements of heavenly bodies. Later, when the relation of the sun to  the courses of the planets was established, the sun came to be looked  upon as a cause; and finally, early in the seventeenth century, for  the first time in history, it began to be recognised that the laws of  dynamics, exactly as they had been established for our own terrestrial  world, hold good, with the same rigid invariability, at least as far  as the limits of the solar system.    Throughout this evolution of thought and conjecture there were two  types of astronomers--those who supplied the facts, and those who  supplied the interpretation through the logic of mathematics. So  Ptolemy was dependent upon Hipparchus, Kepler on Tycho Brahe, and  Newton in much of his work upon Flamsteed.    When Galileo directed his telescope to the heavens, when Secchi and  Huggins studied the chemistry of the stars by means of the  spectroscope, and when Warren De la Rue set up a photoheliograph at  Kew, we see that a progress in the same direction as before, in the  evolution of our conception of the universe, was being made. Without  definite expression at any particular date, it came to be an accepted  fact that not only do earthly dynamics apply to the heavenly bodies,  but that the laws we find established here, in geology, in chemistry,  and in the laws of heat, may be extended with confidence to the  heavenly bodies. Hence arose the branch of astronomy called  astronomical physics, a science which claims a large portion of the  work of the telescope, spectroscope, and photography. In this new  development it is more than ever essential to follow the dictum of  Tycho Brahe--not to make theories until all the necessary facts are  obtained. The great astronomers of to-day still hold to Sir Isaac  Newton's declaration, \"Hypotheses non fingo.\" Each one may have his  suspicions of a theory to guide him in a course of observation, and  may call it a working hypothesis.  But the cautious astronomer does  not proclaim these to the world; and the historian is certainly not  justified in including in his record those vague speculations founded  on incomplete data which may be demolished to-morrow, and which,  however attractive they may be, often do more harm than good to the  progress of true science.  Meanwhile the accumulation of facts has  been prodigious, and the revelations of the telescope and spectroscope  entrancing.        12. THE SUN.      One of Galileo's most striking discoveries, when he pointed his  telescope to the heavenly bodies, was that of the irregularly shaped  spots on the sun, with the dark central _umbra_ and the less  dark, but more extensive, _penumbra_ surrounding it, sometimes  with several umbrae in one penumbra. He has left us many drawings of  these spots, and he fixed their period of rotation as a lunar month.    [Illustration: SOLAR SURFACE, As Photographed at the Royal  Observatory, Greenwich, showing sun-spots with umbrae, penumbrae, and  faculae.]    It is not certain whether Galileo, Fabricius, or Schemer was the first  to see the spots. They all did good work. The spots were found to be  ever varying in size and shape. Sometimes, when a spot disappears at  the western limb of the sun, it is never seen again.  In other cases,  after a fortnight, it reappears at the eastern limb. The faculae, or  bright areas, which are seen all over the sun's surface, but specially  in the neighbourhood of spots, and most distinctly near the sun's  edge, were discovered by Galileo. A high telescopic power resolves  their structure into an appearance like willow-leaves, or rice-grains,  fairly uniform in size, and more marked than on other parts of the  sun's surface.    Speculations as to the cause of sun-spots have never ceased from  Galileo's time to ours. He supposed them to be clouds. Scheiner[1]  said they were the indications of tumultuous movements occasionally  agitating the ocean of liquid fire of which he supposed the sun to be  composed.    A. Wilson, of Glasgow, in 1769,[2] noticed a movement of the umbra  relative to the penumbra in the transit of the spot over the sun's  surface; exactly as if the spot were a hollow, with a black base and  grey shelving sides. This was generally accepted, but later  investigations have contradicted its universality. Regarding the cause  of these hollows, Wilson said:--      Whether their first production and subsequent numberless changes    depend upon the eructation of elastic vapours from below, or upon    eddies or whirlpools commencing at the surface, or upon the    dissolving of the luminous matter in the solar atmosphere, as clouds    are melted and again given out by our air; or, if the reader    pleases, upon the annihilation and reproduction of parts of this    resplendent covering, is left for theory to guess at.[3]    Ever since that date theory has been guessing at it.  The solar  astronomer is still applying all the instruments of modern research to  find out which of these suppositions, or what modification of any of  them, is nearest the truth. The obstacle--one that is perhaps fatal to  a real theory--lies in the impossibility of reproducing comparative  experiments in our laboratories or in our atmosphere.    Sir William Herschel propounded an explanation of Wilson's observation  which received much notice, but which, out of respect for his memory,  is not now described, as it violated the elementary laws of heat.    Sir John Herschel noticed that the spots are mostly confined to two  zones extending to about 35 deg. on each side of the equator, and that a  zone of equatoreal calms is free from spots. But it was  R. C. Carrington[4] who, by his continuous observations at Redhill, in  Surrey, established the remarkable fact that, while the rotation  period in the highest latitudes, 50 deg., where spots are seen, is  twenty-seven-and-a-half days, near the equator the period is only  twenty-five days. His splendid volume of observations of the sun led  to much new information about the average distribution of spots at  different epochs.    Schwabe, of Dessau, began in 1826 to study the solar surface, and,  after many years of work, arrived at a law of frequency which has been  more fruitful of results than any discovery in solar physics.[5] In  1843 he announced a decennial period of maxima and minima of sun-spot  displays. In 1851 it was generally accepted, and, although a period of  eleven years has been found to be more exact, all later observations,  besides the earlier ones which have been hunted up for the purpose, go  to establish a true periodicity in the number of sun-spots. But quite  lately Schuster[6] has given reasons for admitting a number of  co-existent periods, of which the eleven-year period was predominant  in the nineteenth century.    In 1851 Lament, a Scotchman at Munich, found a decennial period in the  daily range of magnetic declination.  In 1852 Sir Edward Sabine  announced a similar period in the number of \"magnetic storms\"  affecting all of the three magnetic elements--declination, dip, and  intensity. Australian and Canadian observations both showed the  decennial period in all three elements. Wolf, of Zurich, and Gauthier,  of Geneva, each independently arrived at the same conclusion.    It took many years before this coincidence was accepted as certainly  more than an accident by the old-fashioned astronomers, who want rigid  proof for every new theory. But the last doubts have long vanished,  and a connection has been further traced between violent outbursts of  solar activity and simultaneous magnetic storms.    The frequency of the Aurora Borealis was found by Wolf to follow the  same period. In fact, it is closely allied in its cause to terrestrial  magnetism. Wolf also collected old observations tracing the  periodicity of sun-spots back to about 1700 A.D.    Spoerer deduced a law of dependence of the average latitude of  sun-spots on the phase of the sun-spot period.    All modern total solar eclipse observations seem to show that the  shape of the luminous corona surrounding the moon at the moment of  totality has a special distinct character during the time of a  sun-spot maximum, and another, totally different, during a sun-spot  minimum.    A suspicion is entertained that the total quantity of heat received by  the earth from the sun is subject to the same period. This would have  far-reaching effects on storms, harvests, vintages, floods, and  droughts; but it is not safe to draw conclusions of this kind except  from a very long period of observations.    Solar photography has deprived astronomers of the type of Carrington  of the delight in devoting a life's work to collecting data. It has  now become part of the routine work of an observatory.    In 1845 Foucault and Fizeau took a daguerreotype photograph of the  sun. In 1850 Bond produced one of the"]]]
