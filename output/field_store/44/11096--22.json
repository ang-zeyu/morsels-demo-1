The moment the sunlight, even though  diffused, strikes this powder it explodes with a violence which nothing  can withstand.  If you ever witness a night battle you will note the  absence of these explosions, while the morning following the battle  will be filled at sunrise with the sharp detonations of exploding  missiles fired the preceding night.  As a rule, however, non-exploding  projectiles are used at night.\"  [I have used the word radium in  describing this powder because in the light of recent discoveries on  Earth I believe it to be a mixture of which radium is the base.  In  Captain Carter's manuscript it is mentioned always by the name used in  the written language of Helium and is spelled in hieroglyphics which it  would be difficult and useless to reproduce.]    While I was much interested in Dejah Thoris' explanation of this  wonderful adjunct to Martian warfare, I was more concerned by the  immediate problem of their treatment of her.  That they were keeping  her away from me was not a matter for surprise, but that they should  subject her to dangerous and arduous labor filled me with rage.    \"Have they ever subjected you to cruelty and ignominy, Dejah Thoris?\" I  asked, feeling the hot blood of my fighting ancestors leap in my veins  as I awaited her reply.    \"Only in little ways, John Carter,\" she answered.  \"Nothing that can  harm me outside my pride.  They know that I am the daughter of ten  thousand jeddaks, that I trace my ancestry straight back without a  break to the builder of the first great waterway, and they, who do not  even know their own mothers, are jealous of me.  At heart they hate  their horrid fates, and so wreak their poor spite on me who stand for  everything they have not, and for all they most crave and never can  attain.  Let us pity them, my chieftain, for even though we die at  their hands we can afford them pity, since we are greater than they and  they know it.\"    Had I known the significance of those words \"my chieftain,\" as applied  by a red Martian woman to a man, I should have had the surprise of my  life, but I did not know at that time, nor for many months thereafter.  Yes, I still had much to learn upon Barsoom.    \"I presume it is the better part of wisdom that we bow to our fate with  as good grace as possible, Dejah Thoris; but I hope, nevertheless, that  I may be present the next time that any Martian, green, red, pink, or  violet, has the temerity to even so much as frown on you, my princess.\"    Dejah Thoris caught her breath at my last words, and gazed upon me with  dilated eyes and quickening breath, and then, with an odd little laugh,  which brought roguish dimples to the corners of her mouth, she shook  her head and cried:    \"What a child!  A great warrior and yet a stumbling little child.\"    \"What have I done now?\" I asked, in sore perplexity.    \"Some day you shall know, John Carter, if we live; but I may not tell  you.  And I, the daughter of Mors Kajak, son of Tardos Mors, have  listened without anger,\" she soliloquized in conclusion.    Then she broke out again into one of her gay, happy, laughing moods;  joking with me on my prowess as a Thark warrior as contrasted with my  soft heart and natural kindliness.    \"I presume that should you accidentally wound an enemy you would take  him home and nurse him back to health,\" she laughed.    \"That is precisely what we do on Earth,\" I answered.  \"At least among  civilized men.\"    This made her laugh again.  She could not understand it, for, with all  her tenderness and womanly sweetness, she was still a Martian, and to a  Martian the only good enemy is a dead enemy; for every dead foeman  means so much more to divide between those who live.    I was very curious to know what I had said or done to cause her so much  perturbation a moment before and so I continued to importune her to  enlighten me.    \"No,\" she exclaimed, \"it is enough that you have said it and that I  have listened.  And when you learn, John Carter, and if I be dead, as  likely I shall be ere the further moon has circled Barsoom another  twelve times, remember that I listened and that I--smiled.\"    It was all Greek to me, but the more I begged her to explain the more  positive became her denials of my request, and, so, in very  hopelessness, I desisted.    Day had now given away to night and as we wandered along the great  avenue lighted by the two moons of Barsoom, and with Earth looking down  upon us out of her luminous green eye, it seemed that we were alone in  the universe, and I, at least, was content that it should be so.    The chill of the Martian night was upon us, and removing my silks I  threw them across the shoulders of Dejah Thoris.  As my arm rested for  an instant upon her I felt a thrill pass through every fiber of my  being such as contact with no other mortal had even produced; and it  seemed to me that she had leaned slightly toward me, but of that I was  not sure.  Only I knew that as my arm rested there across her shoulders  longer than the act of adjusting the silk required she did not draw  away, nor did she speak.  And so, in silence, we walked the surface of  a dying world, but in the breast of one of us at least had been born  that which is ever oldest, yet ever new.    I loved Dejah Thoris.  The touch of my arm upon her naked shoulder had  spoken to me in words I would not mistake, and I knew that I had loved  her since the first moment that my eyes had met hers that first time in  the plaza of the dead city of Korad.          CHAPTER XIV    A DUEL TO THE DEATH      My first impulse was to tell her of my love, and then I thought of the  helplessness of her position wherein I alone could lighten the burdens  of her captivity, and protect her in my poor way against the thousands  of hereditary enemies she must face upon our arrival at Thark.  I could  not chance causing her additional pain or sorrow by declaring a love  which, in all probability she did not return.  Should I be so  indiscreet, her position would be even more unbearable than now, and  the thought that she might feel that I was taking advantage of her  helplessness, to influence her decision was the final argument which  sealed my lips.    \"Why are you so quiet, Dejah Thoris?\" I asked.  \"Possibly you would  rather return to Sola and your quarters.\"    \"No,\" she murmured, \"I am happy here.  I do not know why it is that I  should always be happy and contented when you, John Carter, a stranger,  are with me; yet at such times it seems that I am safe and that, with  you, I shall soon return to my father's court and feel his strong arms  about me and my mother's tears and kisses on my cheek.\"    \"Do people kiss, then, upon Barsoom?\" I asked, when she had explained  the word she used, in answer to my inquiry as to its meaning.    \"Parents, brothers, and sisters, yes; and,\" she added in a low,  thoughtful tone, \"lovers.\"    \"And you, Dejah Thoris, have parents and brothers and sisters?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And a--lover?\"    She was silent, nor could I venture to repeat the question.    \"The man of Barsoom,\" she finally ventured, \"does not ask personal  questions of women, except his mother, and the woman he has fought for  and won.\"    \"But I have fought--\" I started, and then I wished my tongue had been  cut from my mouth; for she turned even as I caught myself and ceased,  and drawing my silks from her shoulder she held them out to me, and  without a word, and with head held high, she moved with the carriage of  the queen she was toward the plaza and the doorway of her quarters.    I did not attempt to follow her, other than to see that she reached the  building in safety, but, directing Woola to accompany her, I turned  disconsolately and entered my own house.  I sat for hours cross-legged,  and cross-tempered, upon my silks meditating upon the queer freaks  chance plays upon us poor devils of mortals.    So this was love!  I had escaped it for all the years I had roamed the  five continents and their encircling seas; in spite of beautiful women  and urging opportunity; in spite of a half-desire for love and a  constant search for my ideal, it had remained for me to fall furiously  and hopelessly in love with a creature from another world, of a species  similar possibly, yet not identical with mine.  A woman who was hatched  from an egg, and whose span of life might cover a thousand years; whose  people had strange customs and ideas; a woman whose hopes, whose  pleasures, whose standards of virtue and of right and wrong might vary  as greatly from mine as did those of the green Martians.    Yes, I was a fool, but I was in love, and though I was suffering the  greatest misery I had ever known I would not have had it otherwise for  all the riches of Barsoom.  Such is love, and such are lovers wherever  love is known.    To me, Dejah Thoris was all that was perfect; all that was virtuous and  beautiful and noble and good.  I believed that from the bottom of my  heart, from the depth of my soul on that night in Korad as I sat  cross-legged upon my silks while the nearer moon of Barsoom raced  through the western sky toward the horizon, and lighted up the gold and  marble, and jeweled mosaics of my world-old chamber, and I believe it  today as I sit at my desk in the little study overlooking the Hudson.  Twenty years have intervened; for ten of them I lived and fought for  Dejah Thoris and her people, and for ten I have lived upon her memory.    The morning of our departure for Thark dawned clear and hot, as do all  Martian mornings except for the six weeks when the snow melts at the  poles.    I sought out Dejah Thoris in the throng of departing chariots, but she  turned her shoulder to me, and I could see the red blood mount to her  cheek.

According to his standing as  an apprentice a young man is assigned his place as a first, second, or  third grade worker. Of course only men of unusual ability pass directly  from apprenticeship into the first grade of the workers. The most fall  into the lower grades, working up as they grow more experienced, at the  periodical regradings. These regradings take place in each industry at  intervals corresponding with the length of the apprenticeship to that  industry, so that merit never need wait long to rise, nor can any rest  on past achievements unless they would drop into a lower rank. One of  the notable advantages of a high grading is the privilege it gives the  worker in electing which of the various branches or processes of his  industry he will follow as his specialty. Of course it is not intended  that any of these processes shall be disproportionately arduous, but  there is often much difference between them, and the privilege of  election is accordingly highly prized. So far as possible, indeed, the  preferences even of the poorest workmen are considered in assigning  them their line of work, because not only their happiness but their  usefulness is thus enhanced. While, however, the wish of the lower  grade man is consulted so far as the exigencies of the service permit,  he is considered only after the upper grade men have been provided for,  and often he has to put up with second or third choice, or even with an  arbitrary assignment when help is needed. This privilege of election  attends every regrading, and when a man loses his grade he also risks  having to exchange the sort of work he likes for some other less to his  taste. The results of each regrading, giving the standing of every man  in his industry, are gazetted in the public prints, and those who have  won promotion since the last regrading receive the nation's thanks and  are publicly invested with the badge of their new rank.\"    \"What may this badge be?\" I asked.    \"Every industry has its emblematic device,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"and  this, in the shape of a metallic badge so small that you might not see  it unless you knew where to look, is all the insignia which the men of  the army wear, except where public convenience demands a distinctive  uniform. This badge is the same in form for all grades of industry, but  while the badge of the third grade is iron, that of the second grade is  silver, and that of the first is gilt.    \"Apart from the grand incentive to endeavor afforded by the fact that  the high places in the nation are open only to the highest class men,  and that rank in the army constitutes the only mode of social  distinction for the vast majority who are not aspirants in art,  literature, and the professions, various incitements of a minor, but  perhaps equally effective, sort are provided in the form of special  privileges and immunities in the way of discipline, which the superior  class men enjoy. These, while intended to be as little as possible  invidious to the less successful, have the effect of keeping constantly  before every man's mind the great desirability of attaining the grade  next above his own.    \"It is obviously important that not only the good but also the  indifferent and poor workmen should be able to cherish the ambition of  rising. Indeed, the number of the latter being so much greater, it is  even more essential that the ranking system should not operate to  discourage them than that it should stimulate the others. It is to this  end that the grades are divided into classes. The grades as well as the  classes being made numerically equal at each regrading, there is not at  any time, counting out the officers and the unclassified and apprentice  grades, over one-ninth of the industrial army in the lowest class, and  most of this number are recent apprentices, all of whom expect to rise.  Those who remain during the entire term of service in the lowest class  are but a trifling fraction of the industrial army, and likely to be as  deficient in sensibility to their position as in ability to better it.    \"It is not even necessary that a worker should win promotion to a  higher grade to have at least a taste of glory. While promotion  requires a general excellence of record as a worker, honorable mention  and various sorts of prizes are awarded for excellence less than  sufficient for promotion, and also for special feats and single  performances in the various industries. There are many minor  distinctions of standing, not only within the grades but within the  classes, each of which acts as a spur to the efforts of a group. It is  intended that no form of merit shall wholly fail of recognition.    \"As for actual neglect of work positively bad work, or other overt  remissness on the part of men incapable of generous motives, the  discipline of the industrial army is far too strict to allow anything  whatever of the sort. A man able to do duty, and persistently refusing,  is sentenced to solitary imprisonment on bread and water till he  consents.    \"The lowest grade of the officers of the industrial army, that of  assistant foremen or lieutenants, is appointed out of men who have held  their place for two years in the first class of the first grade. Where  this leaves too large a range of choice, only the first group of this  class are eligible. No one thus comes to the point of commanding men  until he is about thirty years old. After a man becomes an officer, his  rating of course no longer depends on the efficiency of his own work,  but on that of his men. The foremen are appointed from among the  assistant foremen, by the same exercise of discretion limited to a  small eligible class. In the appointments to the still higher grades  another principle is introduced, which it would take too much time to  explain now.    \"Of course such a system of grading as I have described would have been  impracticable applied to the small industrial concerns of your day, in  some of which there were hardly enough employees to have left one  apiece for the classes. You must remember that, under the national  organization of labor, all industries are carried on by great bodies of  men, many of your farms or shops being combined as one. It is also  owing solely to the vast scale on which each industry is organized,  with co-ordinate establishments in every part of the country, that we  are able by exchanges and transfers to fit every man so nearly with the  sort of work he can do best.    \"And now, Mr. West, I will leave it to you, on the bare outline of its  features which I have given, if those who need special incentives to do  their best are likely to lack them under our system. Does it not seem  to you that men who found themselves obliged, whether they wished or  not, to work, would under such a system be strongly impelled to do  their best?\"    I replied that it seemed to me the incentives offered were, if any  objection were to be made, too strong; that the pace set for the young  men was too hot; and such, indeed, I would add with deference, still  remains my opinion, now that by longer residence among you I become  better acquainted with the whole subject.    Dr. Leete, however, desired me to reflect, and I am ready to say that  it is perhaps a sufficient reply to my objection, that the worker's  livelihood is in no way dependent on his ranking, and anxiety for that  never embitters his disappointments; that the working hours are short,  the vacations regular, and that all emulation ceases at forty-five,  with the attainment of middle life.    \"There are two or three other points I ought to refer to,\" he added,  \"to prevent your getting mistaken impressions. In the first place, you  must understand that this system of preferment given the more efficient  workers over the less so, in no way contravenes the fundamental idea of  our social system, that all who do their best are equally deserving,  whether that best be great or small. I have shown that the system is  arranged to encourage the weaker as well as the stronger with the hope  of rising, while the fact that the stronger are selected for the  leaders is in no way a reflection upon the weaker, but in the interest  of the common weal.    \"Do not imagine, either, because emulation is given free play as an  incentive under our system, that we deem it a motive likely to appeal  to the nobler sort of men, or worthy of them. Such as these find their  motives within, not without, and measure their duty by their own  endowments, not by those of others. So long as their achievement is  proportioned to their powers, they would consider it preposterous to  expect praise or blame because it chanced to be great or small. To such  natures emulation appears philosophically absurd, and despicable in a  moral aspect by its substitution of envy for admiration, and exultation  for regret, in one's attitude toward the successes and the failures of  others.    \"But all men, even in the last year of the twentieth century, are not  of this high order, and the incentives to endeavor requisite for those  who are not must be of a sort adapted to their inferior natures. For  these, then, emulation of the keenest edge is provided as a constant  spur. Those who need this motive will feel it. Those who are above its  influence do not need it.    \"I should not fail to mention,\" resumed the doctor, \"that for those too  deficient in mental or bodily strength to be fairly graded with the  main body of workers, we have a separate grade, unconnected with the  others,--a sort of invalid corps, the members of which are provided  with a light class of tasks fitted to their strength.
