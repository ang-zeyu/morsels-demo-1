Here's a drink for you, Bunny.  Wish me luck.\"    \"I'm coming too.\"    \"I don't want you.\"    \"But I must come!\"    An ugly gleam shot from the steel blue eyes.    \"To interfere?\" said Raffles.    \"Not I.\"    \"You give me your word?\"    \"I do.\"    \"Bunny, if you break it--\"    \"You may shoot me, too!\"    \"I most certainly should,\" said Raffles, solemnly. \"So you come at your  own peril, my dear man; but, if you are coming--well, the sooner the  better, for I must stop at my rooms on the way.\"    Five minutes later I was waiting for him at the Piccadilly entrance to  the Albany.  I had a reason for remaining outside.  It was the  feeling--half hope, half fear--that Angus Baird might still be on our  trail--that some more immediate and less cold-blooded way of dealing  with him might result from a sudden encounter between the money-lender  and myself.  I would not warn him of his danger; but I would avert  tragedy at all costs.  And when no such encounter had taken place, and  Raffles and I were fairly on our way to Willesden, that, I think, was  still my honest resolve.  I would not break my word if I could help it,  but it was a comfort to feel that I could break it if I liked, on an  understood penalty.  Alas!  I fear my good intentions were tainted with  a devouring curiosity, and overlaid by the fascination which goes hand  in hand with horror.    I have a poignant recollection of the hour it took us to reach the  house.  We walked across St. James's Park (I can see the lights now,  bright on the bridge and blurred in the water), and we had some minutes  to wait for the last train to Willesden.  It left at 11.21, I remember,  and Raffles was put out to find it did not go on to Kensal Rise. We had  to get out at Willesden Junction and walk on through the streets into  fairly open country that happened to be quite new to me.  I could never  find the house again.  I remember, however, that we were on a dark  footpath between woods and fields when the clocks began striking twelve.    \"Surely,\" said I, \"we shall find him in bed and asleep?\"    \"I hope we do,\" said Raffles grimly.    \"Then you mean to break in?\"    \"What else did you think?\"    I had not thought about it at all; the ultimate crime had monopolized  my mind.  Beside it burglary was a bagatelle, but one to deprecate none  the less.  I saw obvious objections: the man was au fait with cracksmen  and their ways: he would certainly have firearms, and might be the  first to use them.    \"I could wish nothing better,\" said Raffles. \"Then it will be man to  man, and devil take the worst shot.  You don't suppose I prefer foul  play to fair, do you?  But die he must, by one or the other, or it's a  long stretch for you and me.\"    \"Better that than this!\"    \"Then stay where you are, my good fellow.  I told you I didn't want  you; and this is the house. So good-night.\"    I could see no house at all, only the angle of a high wall rising  solitary in the night, with the starlight glittering on battlements of  broken glass; and in the wall a tall green gate, bristling with spikes,  and showing a front for battering-rams in the feeble rays an outlying  lamp-post cast across the new-made road.  It seemed to me a road of  building-sites, with but this one house built, all by itself, at one  end; but the night was too dark for more than a mere impression.    Raffles, however, had seen the place by daylight, and had come prepared  for the special obstacles; already he was reaching up and putting  champagne corks on the spikes, and in another moment he had his folded  covert-coat across the corks.  I stepped back as he raised himself, and  saw a little pyramid of slates snip the sky above the gate; as he  squirmed over I ran forward, and had my own weight on the spikes and  corks and covert-coat when he gave the latter a tug.    \"Coming after all?\"    \"Rather!\"    \"Take care, then; the place is all bell-wires and springs.  It's no  soft thing, this!  There--stand still while I take off the corks.\"    The garden was very small and new, with a grass-plot still in separate  sods, but a quantity of full-grown laurels stuck into the raw clay  beds. \"Bells in themselves,\" as Raffles whispered; \"there's nothing  else rustles so--cunning old beast!\"  And we gave them a wide berth as  we crept across the grass.    \"He's gone to bed!\"    \"I don't think so, Bunny.  I believe he's seen us.\"    \"Why?\"    \"I saw a light.\"    \"Where?\"    \"Downstairs, for an instant, when I--\"    His whisper died away; he had seen the light again; and so had I.    It lay like a golden rod under the front-door--and vanished.  It  reappeared like a gold thread under the lintel--and vanished for good.  We heard the stairs creak, creak, and cease, also for good.  We neither  saw nor heard any more, though we stood waiting on the grass till our  feet were soaked with the dew.    \"I'm going in,\" said Raffles at last.  \"I don't believe he saw us at  all.  I wish he had.  This way.\"    We trod gingerly on the path, but the gravel stuck to our wet soles,  and grated horribly in a little tiled veranda with a glass door leading  within. It was through this glass that Raffles had first seen the  light; and he now proceeded to take out a pane, with the diamond, the  pot of treacle, and the sheet of brown paper which were seldom omitted  from his impedimenta.  Nor did he dispense with my own assistance,  though he may have accepted it as instinctively as it was proffered.  In any case it was these fingers that helped to spread the treacle on  the brown paper, and pressed the latter to the glass until the diamond  had completed its circuit and the pane fell gently back into our hands.    Raffles now inserted his hand, turned the key in the lock, and, by  making a long arm, succeeded in drawing the bolt at the bottom of the  door; it proved to be the only one, and the door opened, though not  very wide.    \"What's that?\" said Raffles, as something crunched beneath his feet on  the very threshold.    \"A pair of spectacles,\" I whispered, picking them up.  I was still  fingering the broken lenses and the bent rims when Raffles tripped and  almost fell, with a gasping cry that he made no effort to restrain.    \"Hush, man, hush!\" I entreated under my breath.  \"He'll hear you!\"    For answer his teeth chattered--even his--and I heard him fumbling with  his matches.  \"No, Bunny; he won't hear us,\" whispered Raffles,  presently; and he rose from his knees and lit a gas as the match burnt  down.    Angus Baird was lying on his own floor, dead, with his gray hairs glued  together by his blood; near him a poker with the black end glistening;  in a corner his desk, ransacked, littered. A clock ticked noisily on  the chimney-piece; for perhaps a hundred seconds there was no other  sound.    Raffles stood very still, staring down at the dead, as a man might  stare into an abyss after striding blindly to its brink.  His breath  came audibly through wide nostrils; he made no other sign, and his lips  seemed sealed.    \"That light!\" said I, hoarsely; \"the light we saw under the door!\"    With a start he turned to me.    \"It's true!  I had forgotten it.  It was in here I saw it first!\"    \"He must be upstairs still!\"    \"If he is we'll soon rout him out.  Come on!\"    Instead I laid a hand upon his arm, imploring him to reflect--that his  enemy was dead now--that we should certainly be involved--that now or  never was our own time to escape.  He shook me off in a sudden fury of  impatience, a reckless contempt in his eyes, and, bidding me save my  own skin if I liked, he once more turned his back upon me, and this  time left me half resolved to take him at his word.  Had he forgotten  on what errand he himself was here?  Was he determined that this night  should end in black disaster?  As I asked myself these questions his  match flared in the hall; in another moment the stairs were creaking  under his feet, even as they had creaked under those of the murderer;  and the humane instinct that inspired him in defiance of his risk was  borne in also upon my slower sensibilities.  Could we let the murderer  go?  My answer was to bound up the creaking stairs and to overhaul  Raffles on the landing.    But three doors presented themselves; the first opened into a bedroom  with the bed turned down but undisturbed; the second room was empty in  every sense; the third door was locked.    Raffles lit the landing gas.    \"He's in there,\" said he, cocking his revolver. \"Do you remember how we  used to break into the studies at school?  Here goes!\"    His flat foot crashed over the keyhole, the lock gave, the door flew  open, and in the sudden draught the landing gas heeled over like a  cobble in a squall; as the flame righted itself I saw a fixed bath, two  bath-towels knotted together--an open window--a cowering figure--and  Raffles struck aghast on the threshold.    \"JACK--RUTTER?\"    The words came thick and slow with horror, and in horror I heard myself  repeating them, while the cowering figure by the bathroom window rose  gradually erect.    \"It's you!\" he whispered, in amazement no less than our own; \"it's you  two!  What's it mean, Raffles?  I saw you get over the gate; a bell  rang, the place is full of them.  Then you broke in.  What's it all  mean?\"    \"We may tell you that, when you tell us what in God's name you've done,  Rutter!\"    \"Done?  What have I done?\"  The unhappy wretch came out into the light  with bloodshot, blinking eyes, and a bloody shirt-front.  \"You  know--you've seen--but I'll tell you if you like.  I've killed a  robber; that's all.  I've killed a robber, a usurer, a jackal, a  blackmailer, the cleverest and the cruellest villain unhung.  I'm ready  to hang for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7060"],[0,"At Agincourt (#17)"],[1,"are these streets!\" Guy said, after a pause, \"one  seems to draw one's very breath with difficulty.\"    \"They are well-nigh as narrow in London,\" his mistress replied; \"but they  are gay enough below. See how crowded they are, and how brilliant are some  of the costumes!\"    \"Some of them indeed, madam, but more are poor and miserable; and as to  the faces, they are so scowling and sombre, truly were we not on horseback  I should keep my hand tight upon my pouch, though in truth there is  nothing in it worth stealing.\"    \"Ay, ay, Master Guy,\" Long Tom broke in, \"methinks that there are a good  many heads among these scowling knaves that I would gladly have a chance  of cracking had I my quarter-staff in my hand and half a dozen stout  fellows here with me. See how insolently they stare!\"    \"Hush, Tom!\" Dame Margaret said, turning round, \"if you talk of cracking  skulls I shall regret that I brought you with me.\"    \"I am not thinking of doing it, my lady,\" the archer said apologetically.  \"I did but say that I should like to do it, and between liking and doing  there is often a long distance.\"    \"Sometimes, Tom, but one often leads to the other. You must remember that  above all things it behoves us to act prudently here, and to avoid drawing  the attention of our foes. We English are not loved in Paris, and the less  you open your mouth here the better; for when Burgundians and Armagnacs  are ready to cut each other's throats over a name, fellow-countrymen  though they be, neither would feel any compunction about killing an  Englishman.\"    After riding for half an hour they entered the court-yard of a large  building, where men-at-arms and varlets wearing the cognizance of Burgundy  were moving about, a group of nobles were standing on the steps, while  some grooms were walking their horses round the court-yard. The herald  made his way to the door, and here all alighted.    \"Whom have we here, I wonder?\" one of the young nobles said to another as  they came up. \"A royal herald and his pursuivants; a young dame and a very  fair one; her daughter, I suppose, also fair; the lady's esquire; and a  small boy.\"    \"Hostages, I should say,\" the other replied, \"for the good conduct of the  lady's lord, whoever he may be. I know her not, and think that she cannot  have been at court for the last ten years, for I could hardly have  forgotten her face.\"    Dame Margaret took the hands of her two children and followed the herald  up the steps. She had made a motion of her head to Guy to attend her, and  he accordingly followed behind.    \"A haughty lady as well as a fair one,\" the young knight laughed. \"She did  not so much as glance at us, but held her head as high as if she were  going in to rate Burgundy himself. I think that she must be English by her  looks, though what an English woman can be doing here in Paris is beyond  my understanding, unless it be that she is the wife of a knight of  Guienne; in that case she would more likely be with Orleans than here.\"    \"Yes, but you see the herald has brought her. It may be her lord's castle  has been captured, and she has come under the safe-conduct of a herald to  lay a complaint; but I think with you that she is English. The girl was  fair too, though not so fair as her mother, and that curly-headed young  esquire is of English stock too.\"    \"He is a stout-looking fellow, De Maupas, and will make a powerful man; he  looks as if he could strike a shrewd blow even now. Let us question their  knaves, one of whom, by the way, is a veritable giant in point of height.\"    He beckoned to the four men, and Robert Picard came forward.    \"Who is your lady, young man?\"    \"Dame Margaret de Villeroy, may it please you, sir. She is the wife of Sir  Eustace de Villeroy.\"    \"Then we were right, De Maupas, for De Villeroy is, I know, a vassal of  England for his wife's estates, and his people have always counted  themselves English, because for over a hundred years their castle stood  inside the English line.\"    \"He is a stout knight. We heard a month ago how bravely he held his castle  against Sir Clugnet de Brabant with 8000 Orleanists, and beat him off with  a loss of five knights and 400 men. Sir Clugnet himself was sorely  wounded. We all ought to feel mightily obliged to him for the check, which  sent them back post-haste out of Artois, where they had already done  damage enough, and might have done more had they not been so roughly  handled. I wonder what the lady is here for?\"    \"It may be that he would have fought the Burgundians as stoutly as he  fought the Armagnacs,\" the other said, \"and that the duke does not care  about having so strong a castle held by so stout a knight within a few  miles of the English line.\"    The other shrugged his shoulders. \"The English are sleeping dogs,\" he  said; \"there is no Edward and no Black Prince to lead them now.\"    \"No, but you must remember that sleeping dogs wake up sometimes, and even  try to bite when they do so; moreover we know of old that these particular  dogs can bite hard.\"    \"The sooner they wake up the better, I say, De Maupas. We have a long  grudge to wipe off against them, and our men are not likely to repeat the  mistakes that cost us so dearly before. Besides, the English have had no  real fighting for years, and it seems to me that they have altogether  given up any hope of extending their possessions in France.\"    \"One can never tell, De Revelle. For my part I own that I care not that  they should again spread their banner on this side of the sea. There can  be no doubt that they are stout fighting-men, and seeing how France is  divided they might do sore damage did they throw their weight into one  side of the scale.\"    \"Methinks that there is no fear of that. The dukes both know well enough  that their own followers would not fight side by side with the English;  and though they might propose an alliance with the Islanders, it would  only be for the purpose of bringing the war to a close by uniting both  parties against our old enemy.\"    In the meantime Dame Margaret had followed her conductor to the great  chamber, where John of Burgundy held audience in almost royal state.  Several nobles were gathered round him, but at the entrance of the herald  these fell back, leaving him standing by himself. An eminently politic  man, the duke saw at once by the upright figure and the fearless air with  which Dame Margaret entered the hall, that this was a case where courtesy  and deference were far more likely to bring about the desired end of  winning her husband over to his interests, than any menaces or rough  speaking; he therefore advanced two or three steps to meet her.    \"My lord duke,\" the herald said, \"this lady, Dame Margaret of Villeroy,  has journeyed hither with me in accordance with the wish expressed by His  Majesty the king.\"    \"As the king's representative in Paris, lady,\" the duke said to Margaret,  \"I thank you for your promptness in thus conceding to his wish.\"    \"His Majesty's wish was naturally a command to me, Sir Duke,\" Margaret  said with quiet dignity. \"We, my husband and I, understood that some enemy  had been influencing His Majesty's mind against my lord, and in order to  assure him of my lord's loyalty as a faithful vassal for the land he  holds, I have willingly journeyed here with my children, although in much  grief for the loss of my eldest son, who died in the attack lately made  upon our castle by a large body of men, of whom we knew naught, save that  they did not come in the name of our lord the king.\"    \"I have heard of the attack, lady, and of the gallant and successful  defence made by Sir Eustace, and the king was greatly pleased to hear of  the heavy check thus inflicted upon the men who had raised the banner of  revolt, and were harassing His Majesty's faithful subjects.\"    \"That being so, my lord duke,\" Margaret said, \"'tis strange, after my lord  had shown how ready and well prepared he was to protect his castle against  ill-doers, that he should have been asked to admit a garrison of strangers  to aid him to hold it. Sir Eustace has no desire to meddle with the  troubles of the times; he holds his castle as a fief directly from the  crown, as his ancestors have held it for two hundred years; he wishes only  to dwell in peace and in loyal service to the king.\"    [Illustration: THE LADY MARGARET MAKES HER OBEISANCE TO THE DUKE OF  BURGUNDY.]    \"Such we have always understood, madam, and gladly would the king have  seen Sir Eustace himself at his court. The king will, I trust, shortly be  recovered from his malady; until he is so I have--for I was made  acquainted with your coming by messenger sent forward by Monjoie--arranged  for you to be lodged in all honour at the house of Master Leroux, one of  the most worshipful of the citizens of Paris, and provost of the guild of  silversmiths. My chamberlain will at once conduct you thither.\"    \"I thank you, my lord duke,\" Margaret said with a stately reverence, \"and  trust that when I am received by my lord the king I shall be able to prove  to him that Sir Eustace is his faithful vassal, and can be trusted to hold  his castle for him against all comers.\"    \"I doubt it not, lady,\" the duke said courteously. \"Sir Victor  Pierrepoint, I pray you to see this lady to the entrance. Sir Hugo will  already be waiting her there.\"          CHAPTER VI -- IN PARIS      \"A bold dame and a fair one,\" John of Burgundy said to the gentlemen round  him when Margaret left the chamber. \"Methinks that she would be able to  hold Villeroy even should Sir Eustace be away.\"    \"That would she,\" one of the knights said with a laugh. \"I doubt not that  she would buckle on armour if need were. But we must make some allowance  for her heat; it is no pleasant thing to be taken away from her castle and  brought hither as a hostage, to be held for how long a time she knows  not.\"    \"It was the safest way of securing the castle,\""]]]
