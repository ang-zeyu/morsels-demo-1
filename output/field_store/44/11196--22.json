Toys and original  make-believe games decline still earlier, while ball rises steadily  and rapidly to eighteen, and card and table games rise very steadily  from ten to fifteen in girls, but the increment is much less in boys.  \"A third or more of all the amusements of boys just entering their  teens are games of contest--games in which the end is in one way or  another to gain an advantage one's fellows, in which the interest is n  the struggle between peers.\" \"As children approach the teens, a  tendency arises that is well expressed by one of the girls who no  longer makes playthings but things that are useful.\" Parents and  society must, therefore, provide the most favorable conditions for the  kind of amusement fitting at each age. As the child grows older,  society plays a larger role in all the child's amusements, and from  the thirteenth year \"amusements take on a decidedly cooperative and  competitive character, and efforts are ore and more confined to the  accomplishments of some definite aim. The course for this period will  concentrate the effort upon fewer lines,\" and more time will be  devoted to each. The desire for mastery is now at its height. The  instinct is to maintain one's self independently and ask no odds. At  fourteen, especially, the impulse is, in manual training, to make  something and perhaps to cooperate.    McGhee[7] collected the play preferences of 15,718 children, and found  a very steady decline in running plays among girls from nine to  eighteen, but a far more rapid rise in plays of chance from eleven to  fifteen, and a very rapid rise from sixteen to eighteen. From eleven  onward with the most marked fall before fourteen, there was a distinct  decline in imitative games for girls and a slower one for boys. Games  involving rivalry increased rapidly among boys from eleven to sixteen  and still more rapidly among girls, their percentage of preference  even exceeding that of boys at eighteen, when it reached nearly  seventy per cent. With adolescence, specialization upon a few plays  was markedly increased in the teens among boys, whereas with girls in  general there were a large number of plays which were popular with  none preeminent. Even at this age the principle of organization in  games so strong with boys is very slight with girls. Puberty showed  the greatest increase of interest among pubescent girls for croquet,  and among boys for swimming, although baseball and football, the most  favored for boys, rose rapidly. Although the author does not state it,  it would seem from his data that plays peculiar to the different  seasons were most marked among boys, in part, at least, because their  activities are more out of doors.    Ferrero and others have shown that the more intense activities of  primitive people tend to be rhythmic and with strongly automatic  features. No form of activity is more universal than the dance, which  is not only intense but may express chiefly in terms of fundamental  movements, stripped of their accessory finish and detail, every  important act, vocation, sentiment, or event in the life of man in  language so universal and symbolic that music and poetry themselves  seem to have arisen out of it. Before it became specialized much labor  was cast in rhythmic form and often accompanied by time-marking and  even tone to secure the stimulus of concert on both economic and  social principles. In the dark background of history there is now much  evidence that at some point, play, art, and work were not divorced.  They all may have sprung from rhythmic movement which is so  deep-seated in biology because it secures most joy of life with least  expense. By it Eros of old ordered chaos, and by its judicious use the  human soul is cadenced to great efforts toward high ideals. The many  work-songs to secure concerted action in lifting, pulling, stepping,  the use of flail, lever, saw, ax, hammer, hoe, loom, etc., show that  areas and thesis represent flexion and extension, that accent  originated in the acme of muscular stress, as well as how rhythm eases  work and also makes it social. Most of the old work-canticles are  lost, and machines have made work more serial, while rhythms are  obscured or imposed from without so as to limit the freedom they used  to express. Now all basal, central, or strength movements tend to be  oscillatory, automatically repetitive, or rhythmic like savage music,  as if the waves of the primeval sea whence we came still beat in them,  just as all fine peripheral and late movements tend to be serial,  special, vastly complex, end diversified. It is thus natural that  during the period of greatest strength increment in muscular  development, the rhythmic function of nearly all fundamental movements  should be strongly accentuated. At the dawn of this age boys love  marching; and, as our returns show, there is a very remarkable rise in  the passion for beating time, jigging, double shuffling, rhythmic  clapping, etc. The more prominent the factor of repetition the more  automatic and the less strenuous is the hard and new effort of  constant psychic adjustment and attention. College yells, cheers,  rowing, marching, processions, bicycling, running, tug-of-war,  calisthenics and class gymnastics with counting, and especially with  music, horseback riding, etc., are rhythmic; tennis, baseball and  football, basketball, golf, polo, etc., are less rhythmic, but are  concerted and intense. These latter emphasise the conflict factor,  best brought out in fencing, boxing, and wrestling, and lay more  stress on the psychic elements of attention and skill. The effect of  musical accompaniment, which the Swedish system wrongly rejects, is to  make the exercises more fundamental and automatic, and to  proportionately diminish the conscious effort and relieve the  neuro-muscular mechanism involved in fine movements.    Adolescence is the golden period of nascency for rhythm. Before this  change many children have a very imperfect sense of it, and even those  who march, sing, play, or read poetry with correct and overemphasised  time marking, experience a great broadening of the horizon of  consciousness, and a marked, and, for mental power and scope,  all-conditioning increase in the carrying power of attention and the  sentence-sense. The soul now feels the beauty of cadences, good  ascension, and the symmetry of well-developed periods--and all, as I  am convinced, because this is the springtime of the strength movements  which are predominantly rhythmic. Not only does music start in time  marking, the drum being the oldest instrument, but quantity long took  precedence of sense and form of content, both melody and words coming  later. Even rhythmic tapping or beating of the foot (whence the poetic  feet of prosody and meter thus later imposed monotonous prose to make  poetry) exhilarates, makes glad the soul and inspires it to attack,  gives compulsion and a sense of unity. The psychology of rhythm shows  its basal value in cadencing the soul. We can not conceive what war,  love, and religion would be without it. The old adage that \"the parent  of prose is poetry, the parent of poetry is music, the parent of music  is rhythm, and the parent of rhythm is God\" seems borne out not only  in history, but by the nature of thought and attention that does not  move in a continuum, but flies and perches alternately, or on  stepping-stones and as if influenced by the tempo of the leg swinging  as a compound pendulum.    Dancing is one of the best expressions of pure play and of the motor  needs of youth. Perhaps it is the most liberal of all forms of motor  education. Schopenhauer thought it the apex of physiological  irritability and that it made animal life most vividly conscious of  its existence and most exultant in exhibiting it. In very ancient  times China ritualised it in the spring and made it a large part of  the education of boys after the age of thirteen. Neale thinks it was  originally circular or orbicular worship, which he deems oldest. In  Japan, in the priestly Salic College of ancient Rome, in Egypt, in the  Greek Apollo cult, it was a form of worship. St. Basil advised it; St.  Gregory introduced it into religious services. The early Christian  bishops, called praesuls, led the sacred dance around the altar; and  only in 692, and again in 1617, was it forbidden in church. Neale and  others have shown how the choral processionals with all the added  charm of vestment and intonation have had far more to do in  Christianizing many low tribes, who could not understand the language  of the church, than has preaching. Savages are nearly all great  dancers, imitating every animal they know, dancing out their own  legends, with ritual sometimes so exacting that error means death. The  character of people is often learned from their dances, and Moliere  says the destiny of nations depends on them. The gayest dancers are  often among the most downtrodden and unhappy people. Some mysteries  can be revealed only in them, as holy passion-plays. If we consider  the history of secular dances, we find that some of them, when first  invented or in vogue, evoked the greatest enthusiasm. One writer says  that the polka so delighted France and England that statesmen forgot  politics. The spirit of the old Polish aristocracy still lives in the  polonaise. The gipsy dances have inspired a new school of music. The  Greek drama grew out of the evolution of the tragic chorus. National  dances like the hornpipe and reel of Scotland, the _Reihen_, of  Germany, the _rondes_ of France, the Spanish tarantella and  _chaconne_, the strathspey from the Spey Valley, the Irish jig, etc.,  express racial traits.

She saw the High Priest, he to whom custom would unite  her--bent, crooked, gnarled, stunted, hideous--advance with the flaming  torch and stand awaiting her command to apply it to the faggots  surrounding the sacrificial pyre.  His hairy, bestial face was  distorted in a yellow-fanged grin of anticipatory enjoyment.  His hands  were cupped to receive the life blood of the victim--the red nectar  that at Opar would have filled the golden sacrificial goblets.    La approached with upraised knife, her face turned toward the rising  sun and upon her lips a prayer to the burning deity of her people.  The  High Priest looked questioningly toward her--the brand was burning  close to his hand and the faggots lay temptingly near.  Tarzan closed  his eyes and awaited the end.  He knew that he would suffer, for he  recalled the faint memories of past burns.  He knew that he would  suffer and die; but he did not flinch.  Death is no great adventure to  the jungle bred who walk hand-in-hand with the grim specter by day and  lie down at his side by night through all the years of their lives.  It  is doubtful that the ape-man even speculated upon what came after  death.  As a matter of fact as his end approached, his mind was  occupied by thoughts of the pretty pebbles he had lost, yet his every  faculty still was open to what passed around him.    He felt La lean over him and he opened his eyes.  He saw her white,  drawn face and he saw tears blinding her eyes.  \"Tarzan, my Tarzan!\"  she moaned, \"tell me that you love me--that you will return to Opar  with me--and you shall live.  Even in the face of the anger of my  people I will save you.  This last chance I give you.  What is your  answer?\"    At the last moment the woman in La had triumphed over the High  Priestess of a cruel cult.  She saw upon the altar the only creature  that ever had aroused the fires of love within her virgin breast; she  saw the beast-faced fanatic who would one day be her mate, unless she  found another less repulsive, standing with the burning torch ready to  ignite the pyre; yet with all her mad passion for the ape-man she would  give the word to apply the flame if Tarzan's final answer was  unsatisfactory.  With heaving bosom she leaned close above him.  \"Yes  or no?\" she whispered.    Through the jungle, out of the distance, came faintly a sound that  brought a sudden light of hope to Tarzan's eyes.  He raised his voice  in a weird scream that sent La back from him a step or two.  The  impatient priest grumbled and switched the torch from one hand to the  other at the same time holding it closer to the tinder at the base of  the pyre.    \"Your answer!\" insisted La.  \"What is your answer to the love of La of  Opar?\"    Closer came the sound that had attracted Tarzan's attention and now the  others heard it--the shrill trumpeting of an elephant.  As La looked  wide-eyed into Tarzan's face, there to read her fate for happiness or  heartbreak, she saw an expression of concern shadow his features.  Now,  for the first time, she guessed the meaning of Tarzan's shrill  scream--he had summoned Tantor, the elephant, to his rescue!  La's  brows contracted in a savage scowl.  \"You refuse La!\" she cried.  \"Then  die!  The torch!\" she commanded, turning toward the priest.    Tarzan looked up into her face.  \"Tantor is coming,\" he said.  \"I  thought that he would rescue me; but I know now from his voice that he  will slay me and you and all that fall in his path, searching out with  the cunning of Sheeta, the panther, those who would hide from him, for  Tantor is mad with the madness of love.\"    La knew only too well the insane ferocity of a bull elephant in MUST.  She knew that Tarzan had not exaggerated.  She knew that the devil in  the cunning, cruel brain of the great beast might send it hither and  thither hunting through the forest for those who escaped its first  charge, or the beast might pass on without returning--no one might  guess which.    \"I cannot love you, La,\" said Tarzan in a low voice.  \"I do not know  why, for you are very beautiful.  I could not go back and live in  Opar--I who have the whole broad jungle for my range.  No, I cannot  love you but I cannot see you die beneath the goring tusks of mad  Tantor.  Cut my bonds before it is too late.  Already he is almost upon  us.  Cut them and I may yet save you.\"    A little spiral of curling smoke rose from one corner of the pyre--the  flames licked upward, crackling.  La stood there like a beautiful  statue of despair gazing at Tarzan and at the spreading flames.  In a  moment they would reach out and grasp him.  From the tangled forest  came the sound of cracking limbs and crashing trunks--Tantor was coming  down upon them, a huge Juggernaut of the jungle.  The priests were  becoming uneasy.  They cast apprehensive glances in the direction of  the approaching elephant and then back at La.    \"Fly!\" she commanded them and then she stooped and cut the bonds  securing her prisoner's feet and hands.  In an instant Tarzan was upon  the ground.  The priests screamed out their rage and disappointment.  He with the torch took a menacing step toward La and the ape-man.  \"Traitor!\" He shrieked at the woman.  \"For this you too shall die!\"  Raising his bludgeon he rushed upon the High Priestess; but Tarzan was  there before her.  Leaping in to close quarters the ape-man seized the  upraised weapon and wrenched it from the hands of the frenzied fanatic  and then the priest closed upon him with tooth and nail.  Seizing the  stocky, stunted body in his mighty hands Tarzan raised the creature  high above his head, hurling him at his fellows who were now gathered  ready to bear down upon their erstwhile captive.  La stood proudly with  ready knife behind the ape-man.  No faint sign of fear marked her  perfect brow--only haughty disdain for her priests and admiration for  the man she loved so hopelessly filled her thoughts.    Suddenly upon this scene burst the mad bull--a huge tusker, his little  eyes inflamed with insane rage.  The priests stood for an instant  paralyzed with terror; but Tarzan turned and gathering La in his arms  raced for the nearest tree.  Tantor bore down upon him trumpeting  shrilly.  La clung with both white arms about the ape-man's neck.  She  felt him leap into the air and marveled at his strength and his ability  as, burdened with her weight, he swung nimbly into the lower branches  of a large tree and quickly bore her upward beyond reach of the sinuous  trunk of the pachyderm.    Momentarily baffled here, the huge elephant wheeled and bore down upon  the hapless priests who had now scattered, terror-stricken, in every  direction.  The nearest he gored and threw high among the branches of a  tree.  One he seized in the coils of his trunk and broke upon a huge  bole, dropping the mangled pulp to charge, trumpeting, after another.  Two he trampled beneath his huge feet and by then the others had  disappeared into the jungle.  Now Tantor turned his attention once more  to Tarzan for one of the symptoms of madness is a revulsion of  affection--objects of sane love become the objects of insane hatred.  Peculiar in the unwritten annals of the jungle was the proverbial love  that had existed between the ape-man and the tribe of Tantor.  No  elephant in all the jungle would harm the Tarmangani--the white-ape;  but with the madness of MUST upon him the great bull sought to destroy  his long-time play-fellow.    Back to the tree where La and Tarzan perched came Tantor, the elephant.  He reared up with his forefeet against the bole and reached high toward  them with his long trunk; but Tarzan had foreseen this and clambered  beyond the bull's longest reach.  Failure but tended to further enrage  the mad creature.  He bellowed and trumpeted and screamed until the  earth shook to the mighty volume of his noise.  He put his head against  the tree and pushed and the tree bent before his mighty strength; yet  still it held.    The actions of Tarzan were peculiar in the extreme.  Had Numa, or  Sabor, or Sheeta, or any other beast of the jungle been seeking to  destroy him, the ape-man would have danced about hurling missiles and  invectives at his assailant.  He would have insulted and taunted them,  reviling in the jungle Billingsgate he knew so well; but now he sat  silent out of Tantor's reach and upon his handsome face was an  expression of deep sorrow and pity, for of all the jungle folk Tarzan  loved Tantor the best.  Could he have slain him he would not have  thought of doing so.  His one idea was to escape, for he knew that with  the passing of the MUST Tantor would be sane again and that once more  he might stretch at full length upon that mighty back and make foolish  speech into those great, flapping ears.    Finding that the tree would not fall to his pushing, Tantor was but  enraged the more.  He looked up at the two perched high above him, his  red-rimmed eyes blazing with insane hatred, and then he wound his trunk  about the bole of the tree, spread his giant feet wide apart and tugged  to uproot the jungle giant.  A huge creature was Tantor, an enormous  bull in the full prime of all his stupendous strength.  Mightily he  strove until presently, to Tarzan's consternation, the great tree gave  slowly at the roots.  The ground rose in little mounds and ridges about  the base of the bole, the tree tilted--in another moment it would be  uprooted and fall.    The ape-man whirled La to his back and just as the tree inclined slowly  in its first movement out of the perpendicular, before the sudden rush  of its final collapse, he swung to the branches of a lesser neighbor.  It was a long and perilous leap.  La closed her eyes and shuddered; but  when she opened them again she found herself safe and Tarzan whirling  onward through the forest.  Behind them the uprooted tree crashed  heavily to the ground, carrying with it the lesser trees in its path  and then"]]]
