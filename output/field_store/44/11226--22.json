Death was in the cabin, and over the cabin there stood a sapling  pole, and at the end of the pole there fluttered a strip of red cotton  rag--the warning flag of the plague from Athabasca to the bay. This man,  like a hundred other heroes of the North, had run up the warning before  he laid himself down to die. And that same night, in the cold light of  the moon, Kazan and Gray Wolf swung northward into the country of the  Fond du Lac.    There preceded them a messenger from the post on Reindeer Lake, who was  passing up the warning that had come from Nelson House and the country  to the southeast.    \"There's smallpox on the Nelson,\" the messenger informed Williams, at  Fond du Lac, \"and it has struck the Crees on Wollaston Lake. God only  knows what it is doing to the Bay Indians, but we hear it is wiping out  the Chippewas between the Albany and the Churchill.\" He left the same  day with his winded dogs. \"I'm off to carry word to the Reveillon people  to the west,\" he explained.    Three days later, word came from Churchill that all of the company's  servants and his majesty's subjects west of the bay should prepare  themselves for the coming of the Red Terror. Williams' thin face turned  as white as the paper he held, as he read the words of the Churchill  factor.    \"It means dig graves,\" he said. \"That's the only preparation we can  make.\"    He read the paper aloud to the men at Fond du Lac, and every available  man was detailed to spread the warning throughout the post's territory.  There was a quick harnessing of dogs, and on each sledge that went out  was a roll of red cotton cloth--rolls that were ominous of death, lurid  signals of pestilence and horror, whose touch sent shuddering chills  through the men who were about to scatter them among the forest people.  Kazan and Gray Wolf struck the trail of one of these sledges on the Gray  Beaver, and followed it for half a mile. The next day, farther to the  west, they struck another, and on the fourth day still a third. The last  trail was fresh, and Gray Wolf drew back from it as if stung, her fangs  snarling. On the wind there came to them the pungent odor of smoke. They  cut at right angles to the trail, Gray Wolf leaping clear of the marks  in the snow, and climbed to the cap of a ridge. To windward of them, and  down in the plain, a cabin was burning. A team of huskies and a man were  disappearing in the spruce forest. Deep down in his throat Kazan gave a  rumbling whine. Gray Wolf stood as rigid as a rock. In the cabin a  plague-dead man was burning. It was the law of the North. And the  mystery of the funeral pyre came again to Kazan and Gray Wolf. This time  they did not howl, but slunk down into the farther plain, and did not  stop that day until they had buried themselves deep in a dry and  sheltered swamp ten miles to the north.    After this they followed the days and weeks which marked the winter of  nineteen hundred and ten as one of the most terrible in all the history  of the Northland--a single month in which wild life as well as human  hung in the balance, and when cold, starvation and plague wrote a  chapter in the lives of the forest people which will not be forgotten  for generations to come.    In the swamp Kazan and Gray Wolf found a home under a windfall. It was a  small comfortable nest, shut in entirely from the snow and wind. Gray  Wolf took possession of it immediately. She flattened herself out on her  belly, and panted to show Kazan her contentment and satisfaction. Nature  again kept Kazan close at her side. A vision came to him, unreal and  dream-like, of that wonderful night under the stars--ages and ages ago,  it seemed--when he had fought the leader of the wolf-pack, and young  Gray Wolf had crept to his side after his victory and had given herself  to him for mate. But this mating season there was no running after the  doe or the caribou, or mingling with the wild pack. They lived chiefly  on rabbit and spruce partridge, because of Gray Wolf's blindness. Kazan  could hunt those alone. The hair had now grown over Gray Wolf's  sightless eyes. She had ceased to grieve, to rub her eyes with her paws,  to whine for the sunlight, the golden moon and the stars. Slowly she  began to forget that she had ever seen those things. She could now run  more swiftly at Kazan's flank. Scent and hearing had become wonderfully  keen. She could wind a caribou two miles distant, and the presence of  man she could pick up at an even greater distance. On a still night she  had heard the splash of a trout half a mile away. And as these two  things--scent and hearing--became more and more developed in her, those  same senses became less active in Kazan.    He began to depend upon Gray Wolf. She would point out the hiding-place  of a partridge fifty yards from their trail. In their hunts she became  the leader--until game was found. And as Kazan learned to trust to her  in the hunt, so he began just as instinctively to heed her warnings. If  Gray Wolf reasoned, it was to the effect that without Kazan she would  die. She had tried hard now and then to catch a partridge, or a rabbit,  but she had always failed. Kazan meant life to her. And--if she  reasoned--it was to make herself indispensable to her mate. Blindness  had made her different than she would otherwise have been. Again nature  promised motherhood to her. But she did not--as she would have done in  the open, and with sight--hold more and more aloof from Kazan as the  days passed. It was her habit, spring, summer and winter, to snuggle  close to Kazan and lie with her beautiful head resting on his neck or  back. If Kazan snarled at her she did not snap back, but slunk down as  though struck a blow. With her warm tongue she would lick away the ice  that froze to the long hair between Kazan's toes. For days after he had  run a sliver in his paw she nursed his foot. Blindness had made Kazan  absolutely necessary to her existence--and now, in a different way, she  became more and more necessary to Kazan. They were happy in their swamp  home. There was plenty of small game about them, and it was warm under  the windfall. Rarely did they go beyond the limits of the swamp to hunt.  Out on the more distant plains and the barren ridges they occasionally  heard the cry of the wolf-pack on the trail of meat, but it no longer  thrilled them with a desire to join in the chase.    One day they struck farther than usual to the west. They left the swamp,  crossed a plain over which a fire had swept the preceding year, climbed  a ridge, and descended into a second plain. At the bottom Gray Wolf  stopped and sniffed the air. At these times Kazan always watched her,  waiting eagerly and nervously if the scent was too faint for him to  catch. But to-day he caught the edge of it, and he knew why Gray Wolf's  ears flattened, and her hindquarters drooped. The scent of game would  have made her rigid and alert. But it was not the game smell. It was  human, and Gray Wolf slunk behind Kazan and whined. For several minutes  they stood without moving or making a sound, and then Kazan led the way  on. Less than three hundred yards away they came to a thick clump of  scrub spruce, and almost ran into a snow-smothered tepee. It was  abandoned. Life and fire had not been there for a long time. But from  the tepee had come the man-smell. With legs rigid and his spine  quivering Kazan approached the opening to the tepee. He looked in. In  the middle of the tepee, lying on the charred embers of a fire, lay a  ragged blanket--and in the blanket was wrapped the body of a little  Indian child. Kazan could see the tiny moccasined feet. But so long had  death been there that he could scarcely smell the presence of it. He  drew back, and saw Gray Wolf cautiously nosing about a long and  peculiarly shaped hummock in the snow. She had traveled about it three  times, but never approaching nearer than a man could have reached with a  rifle barrel. At the end of her third circle she sat down on her  haunches, and Kazan went close to the hummock and sniffed. Under that  bulge in the snow, as well as in the tepee, there was death. They slunk  away, their ears flattened and their tails drooping until they trailed  the snow, and did not stop until they reached their swamp home. Even  there Gray Wolf still sniffed the horror of the plague, and her muscles  twitched and shivered as she lay close at Kazan's side.    That night the big white moon had around its edge a crimson rim. It  meant cold--intense cold. Always the plague came in the days of greatest  cold--the lower the temperature the more terrible its havoc. It grew  steadily colder that night, and the increased chill penetrated to the  heart of the windfall, and drew Kazan and Gray Wolf closer together.  With dawn, which came at about eight o'clock, Kazan and his blind mate  sallied forth into the day. It was fifty degrees below zero. About them  the trees cracked with reports like pistol-shots. In the thickest spruce  the partridges were humped into round balls of feathers. The snow-shoe  rabbits had burrowed deep under the snow or to the heart of the heaviest  windfalls. Kazan and Gray Wolf found few fresh trails, and after an  hour of fruitless hunting they returned to their lair. Kazan, dog-like,  had buried the half of a rabbit two or three days before, and they dug  this out of the snow and ate the frozen flesh.    All that day it grew colder--steadily colder. The night that followed  was cloudless, with a white moon and brilliant stars. The temperature  had fallen another ten degrees, and nothing was moving. Traps were never  sprung on such nights, for even the furred things--the mink, and the  ermine, and the lynx--lay snug in the holes and the nests they had found  for themselves. An increasing hunger was not strong enough to drive  Kazan and Gray Wolf from their windfall. The next day there was no break  in the terrible cold, and toward noon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10114"],[0,"The Great Events (#18)"],[1,"into the town. Crossing the  Straits of Messina, which the culpable negligence of Nicias had left  unguarded, Gylippus landed on the northern coast of Sicily, and there  began to collect from the Greek cities an army, of which the regular  troops that he brought from Peloponnesus formed the nucleus. Such was  the influence of the name of Sparta, and such were his own abilities and  activity, that he succeeded in raising a force of about two thousand  fully armed infantry, with a larger number of irregular troops. Nicias,  as if infatuated, made no attempt to counteract his operation, nor, when  Gylippus marched his little army toward Syracuse, did the Athenian  commander endeavor to check him. The Syracusans marched out to meet him;  and while the Athenians were solely intent on completing their  fortifications on the southern side toward the harbor, Gylippus turned  their position by occupying the high ground in the extreme rear of  Epipolae. He then marched through the unfortified interval of Nicias'  lines into the besieged town, and joining his troops with the Syracusan  forces, after some engagements with varying success, gained the mastery  over Nicias, drove the Athenians from Epipolae, and hemmed them into a  disadvantageous position in the low grounds near the great harbor.    The attention of all Greece was now fixed on Syracuse, and every enemy  of Athens felt the importance of the opportunity now offered of checking  her ambition, and, perhaps, of striking a deadly blow at her power.  Larger reinforcements from Corinth, Thebes, and other cities now reached  the Syracusans, while the baffled and dispirited Athenian general  earnestly besought his countrymen to recall him, and represented the  further prosecution of the siege as hopeless.    But Athens had made it a maxim never to let difficulty or disaster drive  her back from any enterprise once undertaken, so long as she possessed  the means of making any effort, however desperate, for its  accomplishment. With indomitable pertinacity, she now decreed, instead  of recalling her first armament from before Syracuse, to send out a  second, though her enemies near home had now renewed open warfare  against her, and by occupying a permanent fortification in her territory  had severely distressed her population, and were pressing her with  almost all the hardships of an actual siege. She still was mistress of  the sea, and she sent forth another fleet of seventy galleys, and  another army, which seemed to drain almost the last reserves of her  military population, to try if Syracuse could not yet be won, and the  honor of the Athenian arms be preserved from the stigma of a retreat.  Hers was, indeed, a spirit that might be broken, but never would bend.  At the head of this second expedition she wisely placed her best  general, Demosthenes, one of the most distinguished officers that the  long Peloponnesian war had produced, and who, if he had originally held  the Sicilian command, would soon have brought Syracuse to submission.    The fame of Demosthenes the general has been dimmed by the superior  lustre of his great countryman, Demosthenes the orator. When the name of  Demosthenes is mentioned, it is the latter alone that is thought of. The  soldier has found no biographer. Yet out of the long list of great men  whom the Athenian republic produced, there are few that deserve to stand  higher than this brave, though finally unsuccessful leader of her fleets  and armies in the first half of the Peloponnesian war. In his first  campaign in Aetolia he had shown some of the rashness of youth, and had  received a lesson of caution by which he profited throughout the rest of  his career, but without losing any of his natural energy in enterprise  or in execution. He had performed the distinguished service of rescuing  Naupactus from a powerful hostile armament in the seventh year of the  war; he had then, at the request of the Acarnanian republics, taken on  himself the office of commander-in-chief of all their forces, and at  their head he had gained some important advantages over the enemies of  Athens in Western Greece. His most celebrated exploits had been the  occupation of Pylos on the Messenian coast, the successful defence of  that place against the fleet and armies of Lacedaemon, and the  subsequent capture of the Spartan forces on the isle of Sphacteria,  which was the severest blow dealt to Sparta throughout the war, and  which had mainly caused her to humble herself to make the truce with  Athens.    Demosthenes was as honorably unknown in the war of party politics at  Athens as he was eminent in the war against the foreign enemy. We read  of no intrigues of his on either the aristocratic or democratic side. He  was neither in the interest of Nicias nor of Cleon. His private  character was free from any of the stains which polluted that of  Alcibiades. On all these points the silence of the comic dramatist is  decisive evidence in his favor. He had also the moral courage, not  always combined with physical, of seeking to do his duty to his country,  irrespective of any odium that he himself might incur, and unhampered by  any petty jealousy of those who were associated with him in command.  There are few men named in ancient history of whom posterity would  gladly know more or whom we sympathize with more deeply in the  calamities that befell them than Demosthenes, the son of Alcisthenes,  who, in the spring of the year 413, left Piraeus at the head of the  second Athenian expedition against Sicily.    His arrival was critically timed; for Gylippus had encouraged the  Syracusans to attack the Athenians under Nicias by sea as well as by  land, and by one able stratagem of Ariston, one of the admirals of the  Corinthian auxiliary squadron, the Syracusans and their confederates had  inflicted on the fleet of Nicias the first defeat that the Athenian navy  had ever sustained from a numerically inferior enemy. Gylippus was  preparing to follow up his advantage by fresh attacks on the Athenians  on both elements, when the arrival of Demosthenes completely changed the  aspect of affairs and restored the superiority to the invaders. With  seventy-three war-galleys in the highest state of efficiency, and  brilliantly equipped, with a force of five thousand picked men of the  regular infantry of Athens and her allies, and a still larger number of  bowmen, javelin-men, and slingers on board, Demosthenes rowed round the  great harbor with loud cheers and martial music, as if in defiance of  the Syracusans and their confederates. His arrival had indeed changed  their newly born hopes into the deepest consternation.    The resources of Athens seemed inexhaustible, and resistance to her  hopeless. They had been told that she was reduced to the last  extremities, and that her territory was occupied by an enemy; and yet  here they saw her sending forth, as if in prodigality of power, a second  armament, to make foreign conquests, not inferior to that with which  Nicias had first landed on the Sicilian shores.    With the intuitive decision of a great commander, Demosthenes at once  saw that the possession of Epipolae was the key to the possession of  Syracuse, and he resolved to make a prompt and vigorous attempt to  recover that position while his force was unimpaired and the  consternation which its arrival had produced among the besieged remained  unabated. The Syracusans and their allies had run out an outwork along  Epipolae from the city walls, intersecting the fortified lines of  circumvallation which Nicias had commenced, but from which he had been  driven by Gylippus. Could Demosthenes succeed in storming this outwork,  and in reestablishing the Athenian troops on the high ground, he might  fairly hope to be able to resume the circumvallation of the city and  become the conqueror of Syracuse; for when once the besiegers' lines  were completed, the number of the troops with which Gylippus had  garrisoned the place would only tend to exhaust the stores of provisions  and accelerate its downfall.    An easily repelled attack was first made on the outwork in the daytime,  probably more with the view of blinding the besieged to the nature of  the main operations than with any expectation of succeeding in an open  assault, with every disadvantage of the ground to contend against. But,  when the darkness had set in, Demosthenes formed his men in columns,  each soldier taking with him five days' provisions, and the engineers  and workmen of the camp following the troops with their tools and all  portable implements of fortification, so as at once to secure any  advantage of ground that the army might gain. Thus equipped and  prepared, he led his men along by the foot of the southern flank of  Epipolae, in a direction toward the interior of the island, till he came  immediately below the narrow ridge that forms the extremity of the high  ground looking westward. He then wheeled his vanguard to the right, sent  them rapidly up the paths that wind along the face of the cliff, and  succeeded in completely surprising the Syracusan outposts, and in  placing his troops fairly on the extreme summit of the all-important  Epipolae. Thence the Athenians marched eagerly down the slope toward the  town, routing some Syracusan detachments that were quartered in their  way, and vigorously assailing the unprotected side of the outwork.    All at first favored them. The outwork was abandoned by its garrison,  and the Athenian engineers began to dismantle it. In vain Gylippus  brought up fresh troops to check the assault; the Athenians broke and  drove them back, and continued to press hotly forward, in the full  confidence of victory. But, amid the general consternation of the  Syracusans and their confederates, one body of infantry stood firm. This  was a brigade of their Boeotian allies, which was posted low down the  slope of Epipolae, outside the city walls. Coolly and"]]]
