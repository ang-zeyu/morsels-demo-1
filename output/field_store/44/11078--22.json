They were a queer-looking lot, with wild, unsteady eyes,  receding brows, horizontal noses, and projecting muzzles; the  cranium and the features seemed disposed nearly at a right angle,  giving them a peculiar baboon-like semblance. Each had his water-  gourd and his flint-gun, the lock protected by a cover of  monkey's skin or wild cow's hide, whilst gibècieres and  ammunition-bags of grass-cloth hung from their shoulders. There  were also two boys with native axes, small iron triangles, whose  points passed through knob-sticks; these were to fell the trees  in which our game might take refuge, and possibly they might have  done so in a week. A few minutes with this party convinced me  that I was wilfully wasting time; they would not separate, and  they talked so loud that game would be startled a mile off. I  proposed that they should station me in a likely place, form a  circle, and drive up what was in it--they were far above acting  beaters after that fashion. So we dismissed them and dispersed  about the bush. My factotum shot a fine Mboko (Siurus  eborivorus), 2 ft. 2 in. total length: the people declare that  this squirrel gnaws ivory, whence its name. I had heard of it in  East and Central Africa, but the tale appeared fabulous: here it  is very common, half a dozen will be seen during the day; it has  great vitality, and it will escape after severe wounds. The  bushmen also brought a Shoke (Colubus Satanas), a small black  monkey, remarkably large limbed: the little unfortunate was  timid, but not vicious; it worried itself to death on the next  day. They also showed me the head of the Njíwo antelope, which M.  du Chaillu (chap, xii.) describes as \"a singular animal of the  size of a donkey, with shorter legs, no horns, and black, with a  yellow spot on the back.\"[FN#17]    In the afternoon Selim went to fetch my arsenical soap from  Mbátá, where I had left it en Fitiché: as long as that \"bad  medicine\" was within Hotaloya's \"ben,\" no one would dare to  meddle with my goods. Forteune walked in very tired about sunset.  He had now added streaks of red to the white chalk upon his face,  arms, and breast, for he suspected, we were assured, witchcraft.  I told him to get ready for a march on the morrow to the Shekyáni  country, lying south-east, but he begged so hard, and he seemed  so assured of showing sport, that the design was deferred, and  again \"perdidi diem.\"    Monday the 24th was a Black Monday, sultry and thundery. We went  to the bush, and once more we returned, disgusted by the  chattering of the wild men. As we discussed our plans for moving,  Forteune threw cold water upon every proposal. This puzzled me,  and the difficulty was to draw his secret. At last Kángá, a black  youth, who, being one of the family, had attached himself  uninvited to the party, blurted out in bad French that the  Shekyáni chief, to whose settlement we were bound, had left for  the interior, and that the village women would not, or rather  could not, give us \"chop.\" This was a settler to my Mpongwe  friends. Nimrod, however, declared that some bushmen had lately  seen several gorillas in the direction of Sánga-Tánga, two  marches down coast from Mbátá, and about half-way to Cape Lopez.  I did not believe a word of his intelligence; the direction is  south-west instead of south-east, towards the sea instead of into  the forest. But it was evidently hopeless to seek for the \"ole  man\" in these parts, and I had long been anxious to see Sánga-  Tánga; we therefore agreed nem. con. to set out before dawn on  the next day.    But the next day dawned, and the sun rose high, and the world was  well heated and aired before the bushmen condescended to appear.  After a two hours' battle with the sand-flies we set off at 7.35  A.M., Forteune, Hotaloya, and Kángá at the head of the  musketeers, one of them also carrying an axe; sixteen guns form a  strong party for these regions. The viol (nchámbí) was not  allowed to hang mute in Mbata's halls, this instrument or the  drum must never be neglected in African travel; its melody at the  halt and the camp-fire are to the negro what private theatricals  are to the European sailor half fossilized in the frozen seas.  Our specimen was strung with thin cords made from the fibre of a  lliana; I was shown this growth, which looked much like a  convolvulus. The people have a long list of instruments, and  their music, though monotonous, is soft and plaintive: Bowdich  gives a specimen of it (\"Sketch of Gaboon,\" p. 449), and of a  bard who seems to have been somewhat more frenzied than most  poets. Captain Allen (iii. 398) speaks of a harp at Bimbia  (Camarones) tightly strung with the hard fibre of some creeping  plant. The Bákele harp (M. du Chaillu, chap, xvi.) is called  Ngombi; the handle opposite the bow often has a carved face, and  it might be a beginning of the article used by civilized Europe--  Wales for instance.    The path plunged westward into the bush, spanned a dirty and  grass-grown plantation of bananas, dived under thorn tunnels and  arches of bush, and crossed six nullahs, Neropotamoi, then dry,  but full of water on our return. The ant-nests were those of  Yoruba and the Mendi country; not the tall, steepled edifices  built by the termites with yellow clay, as in Eastern Africa, but  an eruption of blue-black, hard-dried mud and mucus, resembling  the miniature pagodas, policeman's lanterns, mushrooms, or  umbrellas one or two feet high, here single, there double, common  in Ashanti and Congo-land. Like most of their congeners, the  animals die when exposed to the sun. The \"Bashikouay\" and  Nchounou (Nchu'u) of M. du Chaillu are the common \"driver-ant\" of  West Africa (Termes bellicosa). It is little feared in the  Gaboon; when its armies attack the mission-houses, they are  easily stopped by lighting spirits of turpentine, or by a strew  of quicklime, which combines with the formic acid. The different  species are described in \"Palm Land\" and \"Western Africa\" (pp.  369-373), from which even the account of the \"tubular bridge\" is  taken--Mr. Wilson less sensationally calls it what it is, a \"live  raft.\" The most common are the Nkázeze, a large reddish and fetid  ant, which is harmless to man; the Njenge, a smaller red species,  and the Ibimbízí, whose bite is painful.    We passed the mortal remains of a gorilla lashed to a pole; the  most interesting parts had been sold to Mr. R. B. N. Walker, and  were on their way to England. I was shown for the first time the  Ndámbo, or Ndambié (Bowdich, \"Olamboo\"), which gives the india  rubber of commerce; it is not a fat-leaved fig-tree (Ficus  elastica of Asia) nor aeuphorbia (Siphonia elastica), as in South  America, but a large climbing ficus, a cable thick as a man's leg  crossing the path, and \"swarming up\" to the top of the tallest  boles; the yellow fruit is tart and pleasant to the taste. In  1817 the style of collecting the gum (olamboo) was to spread with  a knife the glutinous milk as it oozed from the tree over the  shaved breast and arms like a plaister; it was then taken off,  rolled up in balls to play with or stretched over drums, no other  use being known. The Rev. Mr. Wilson declares (chap. ii.) that he  \"first discovered the gum elastic, which has been procured, as  yet, only at Corisco, Gabun, and Kama.\" In 1854, Mr. Thompson (p.  112) found it in the Mendi country, near Sherbro; he describes it  as a vine with dense bark, which yields the gum when hacked, and  which becomes soft and porous when old. The juice is milk-white,  thick, and glutinous, soon stiffening, darkening, and hardening  without aid of art. I should like to see the raw material tried  for making waterproofs in the tropics, where the best vulcanized  articles never last. The Ndámbo tree has been traced a hundred  miles inland from the Liberian Coast; that of the Gallinas and  Sherbro is the best; at St. Paul's River it is not bad; but on  the Junk River it is sticky and little prized. The difficulty  everywhere is to make the negro collect it, and, when he does, to  sell it un-adulterated: in East Africa he uses the small branches  of the ficus for flogging canes, but will not take the trouble  even to hack the \"Mpira\" tree.      At a brook of the sweetest water, purling over the cleanest and  brightest of golden sands, we filled the canteens, this being the  last opportunity for some time. Forest walks are thirsty work  during the hot season; the air is close, fetid, and damp with  mire; the sea-breeze has no power to enter, and perspiration  streams from every pore. After heavy rains it is still worse, the  surface of the land is changed, and paths become lines of dark  puddles; the nullahs, before dry, roll muddy, dark-brown streams,  and their mouths streak the sea with froth and scum. Hardly a  living object meets the eye, and only the loud, whirring flight  of some large bird breaks the dreary silence. The music of the  surf now sounded like the song of the sea-shell as we crossed  another rough prism of stone and bush, whose counter-slope fell  gently into a sand-flat overgrown with Ipomaa and other bright  flowering plants. After walking about an hour (equal to 2.50  miles) between south and south-west, we saluted the pleasant  aspect of <Greek>         with a general cheer. Northwards lay  Point Ipizarala, southways Nyonye, both looking like tree-clumps  rising from the waves. I could not sufficiently admire, and I  shall never forget the exquisite loveliness of land and sea; the  graceful curve of the beach, a hundred feet broad, fining  imperceptibly away till lost in the convexity of waters. The  morning sun, half way to the zenith, burned bright in a cloudless  sky, whilst in the east and west distant banks of purple mist  coloured the liquid plain with a cool green-blue, a celadon tint  that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5761"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 2 (#17)"],[1," of converting the tomb into a  treasury; in the case of Mashel some £600 in gold and silver,  besides cloth, beads, and ornaments, shared, they say, his fate.  The missionaries vainly fought against these customs, which are  evidently of sentimental origin--              \"Now bring the last sad gifts, with these                 The last lament be said;             Let all that pleased and still may please                 Be buried with the dead.\"    The bier was borne by slaves, as the head men would not even look  at it; at times the carriers circled round, as if to deprecate  the idea that they were hurrying it to its bourne. The grave was  a pit fifteen to twenty feet deep, cut like a well, covered with  stones to keep out wild beasts, and planted round with the  cylindrical euphorbia by way of immortelles.    I could not find out if the Congoese still practise the vivi-  sepulture so common on the Western Coast--the \"infernal  sacrifices of man's flesh to the memory of relatives and  ancestors,\" as the old missioners energetically expressed  themselves. According to Battel, the \"Giaghi\" corpse was seated  as if alive in a vault; in this \"infernal and noisome dungeon\"  were placed two wives with their arms broken, and thus there was  no danger of the Zumbi or ghost killing men by reapparition. When  the king of Old Calabar died, a huge hole was dug, with an off  chamber for two sofas, one of which supported the dressed and  ornamented corpse. Personal attendants, such as the umbrella,  sword, and snuff-box bearers, holding the insignia of their  offices, together with sundry virgins, were either slaughtered or  thrown in alive, a rude in pace. Quantities of food and trade  goods, especially coppers, were heaped up; after which the pit  was filled and the ground was levelled. The less wealthy sort of  \"gentlemen\" here are placed in smaller graves near the villages;  and the slaves are still \"buried with the burial of an ass,\"--  cast forth into the bush.    Yet, by way of showing themselves kind to the dead, the Congoese  are \"commonly very cruel to the living.\" Lately, a chief, called  from his wealth, \"Chico de Ouro\" (Golden Frank) died somewhat  suddenly. The Nganga or medicine man who, on such occasions, here  as elsewhere, has the jus vitæ et necis, was called in; he  charged one of the sons with parricide by witchcraft, and the  youth was at once pierced by the bayonets of his brothers.  \"Golden Frank\" was peculiar in his ways. He used to entertain the  factors at dinner, imitating them from soup to cheese; his only  objections were to tea, and to drinking toasts out of anything  but the pet skull of an enemy: it was afterwards placed upon his  grave.    Boma is no longer \"the emporium of the Congo Empire,\" if it ever  did deserve that title. Like Porto da Lenha, it is kept up by the  hopes of seeing better days, which are not doomed to dawn. Even  at the time of my visit some 400 to 500 negroes were under guard  in a deserted factory, and, whilst we were visiting Nessalla,  they were marched down to bathe. When I returned from the  cataracts, the barracoon contained only fifty or sixty, the rest  having been shunted off to some unguarded point. At a day's  notice a thousand, and within a week 3,000 head could be procured  from the adjoining settlements, where the chattels are kept at  work. As in Tuckey's day, \"those exported are either captives in  war or condemned criminals.\" During the Free Emigration as much  as $80 have been paid per man, a large sum for \"Congoes:\" whilst  a cargo of 500 \"Minas\" (Guinea negroes) loses at most 20 per  cent., these less hardy gangs seldom escape without at least  double the deaths by dysentery or some other epidemic. Now they  are freely offered for $10 to $20, but there are no buyers; the  highest bid of which I heard was $100 for a house-\"help.\"    The slave-traders in the Congo look upon their employment as did  the contrabandist in the golden days of smuggling; the \"free  sailor\" whom Marryatt depicts, a law-breaker, yet not less a very  pleasant, companionable fellow. The unhappy differences between  the late British Commissioner for Loanda and the Judge of the  mixed Court, Sr. José Julio Rodriguez, who followed his enemy to  the grave on April 12, 1863, rendered São Paulo anything but a  pleasant place to an English resident; but the rancour had not  extended to the Congo, and, so far from showing chagrin, the  agents declared that without the \"coffin squadron,\" negroes would  have been a mere drug in the market. The only déplaisir is that  which I had already found in a Gaboon factory, the excessive  prevalence of petty pilfering. The Moleques or house-boys steal  like magpies, even what is utterly useless to them; these young  clerks of St. Nicholas will scream and writhe, and confess and  beg pardon under the lash, and repeat the offence within the  hour: as they are born serviles, we cannot explain the habit by  Homer's,              \"Jove fixed it certain that whatever day             Makes man a slave takes half his worth away.\"    One of our watches was found in the pocket of a noble  interpreter, who, unabashed, declared that he placed it there for  fear of its being injured; and the traders are constantly  compelled to call in the Fetishman for the protection of their  stores against the prigging chiefs. Yet in Tuckey's time there  was only one thief at Boma, a boy who stole a knife, confessed,  and restored it. During a month's residence amongst the pagans of  the interior, where the houses swarmed with serviles, and where  my outfit, which was never locked up, must have represented a  plate-chest in England, not the smallest article was \"found  missing,\" nor could anything be touched except by collusion with  the head man.                                      Chapter IX.                      Up the Congo to Banza Nokki.    For a wonder the canoes came in time, and, despite their mat-  sails, we could not complain of them. There were twelve paddlers  two for the stem, and two for the stern of each craft, under a  couple of interpreters, Jotakwassi and Nchama-Chamvu, who were  habited in European frock-coats of broadcloth, and in native  terminations mostly \"buff.\" Our excellent host bade us a kindly  adieu, with many auguries of success--during the last night the  frogs had made a noise in the house. Briefly, we set out on  September 6th.    In the forty-five miles between Boma, where we enter the true  trough of the Congo, and the landing-place of Banza Nokki below  the cataracts, there are half-a-dozen reaches, the shortest of  three, the longest of fifteen miles. They are not straight, as  upon the chart; the windings of the bed exclude direct vision,  and the succession of points and bays suggest, like parts of the  Rhine, a series of mountain-tarns. The banks show the high-water  level in a low shelf, a ribbon of green, backed by high rolling  hills, rounded and stony, with grass dry at this season; the  formation is primitive, and the material of the lower bed has  been held to \"prove the probability that the mountains of  Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, and other adjacent parts of South  America, were primevally connected with the opposite chains, that  traverse the plains of Congo and Loango.\" In parts the rocks fall  bluff into the river, and here the current rushes past like a  mill-race without a shadow of backwater. The heights are  intersected by gullies and ravines, of which I counted sixty-nine  on the right and fifty-four on the left bank; many of them are  well wooded, and others are fronted by plains of the reeds and  flags, which manufacture floating islands, cast loose, like those  of the Niger, about the end of July by the \"Malka\" rains. About a  dozen contained running water: Captain Tuckey did not see one  that would turn a mill in August and September; but in November  and December all these fiumaras will discharge torrents.    The breadth of the entroughed bed varies from 700 yards to two  miles where it most dispreads itself. The current increases from  the normal three to five knots in rare places; the surface loses  the glassiness of the lower section, and at once shows the  boiling and swirling which will be noticed near the cataracts.  The shores are often foul, but the midway is mostly clear, and,  where sunken rocks are, they are shown by whirlpools. The flow of  the tide, or rather the damming up of the lower waters between  Porto da Lenha and the mouth, causes a daily rise, which we found  to measure about a foot; thus it assists in forming a treble  current, the rapid down-flow in the Thalweg being subtended by a  strong backwater on either side carrying a considerable portion  in a retrograde direction, and showing a sensible reflux; this  will continue as far as the rapids. In the Amazonas the tides are  felt a hundred leagues from the mouth; and, whilst the stream  moves seawards, the level of the water rises, proving an evident  under-current. Mr. Bates has detected the influence of oceanic  tides at a point on the Tapajos, 530 miles distant from its  mouth, such is the amazing flatness of the country's profile:  here we find the reverse.    The riverine trough acts as wind-conductor to a strong and even  violent sea-breeze; on the lower section it begins as a ground-  current--if the \"bull\" be allowed--a thin horizontal stratum near  the water, it gradually curves and slides upwards as it meets the  mountain flanks, forming an inverted arch, and extending some  2,000 to 3,000 feet above the summits. At this season it is a  late riser, often appearing about 3 P.M., and sometimes its  strength is not exhausted before midnight. The brown water,  grass-sheeted at the sides, conceals the bright yellow sand of  the bed; when placed in a tumbler it looks clear and colourless,  and the taste is perfectly sweet--brackishness does not extend  far above Porto da Lenha. Yet at Boma the residents prefer a  spring near the"]]]
