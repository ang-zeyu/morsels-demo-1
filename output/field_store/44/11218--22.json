As we approached the elevated country between us and the distant  line of trees, we perceived that the vast level was covered with  POLYGONUM JUNCEUM in a verdant state. The colour was dark green, such as  I had never seen elsewhere in this \"leafless bramble,\" as Sturt called  it, which looks ever quite dry and withered along the margins of the  Darling. We had good reason to love and admire its verdure now, when we  found amongst it pure water in great abundance, into which all our native  companions immediately plunged, and rolled about like porpoises. This,  they said, was the \"Narran,\" but to the vast swampy plain they gave the  name of Keegur, a name quite useless for white men's memories or maps.  They seemed to say it was wholly an emanation from the Narran, and  pointed to the nearest part of the trees beyond, saying the river Narran  was there. I still endeavoured to proceed, as they wished, towards the  nearest trees beyond, until a winding narrow pond of water, in very soft  mud, precluded all hopes of crossing with our drays, without some sort of  bridge; I therefore immediately counter-marched the party with me, now  far advanced in that sea of dark green polygonum, and conducted it into a  position on open stony ground to the westward of our route, with the  intention to await there the arrival of the drays, and to prepare  materials for a bridge to be laid across the muddy pond, as I had seen a  small clump of pines (Callitris) at no great distance back. My guides did  not encourage a hope I entertained, that this swamp might be turned by  the westward, in which direction the open country extended to the  horizon. The man who travels with bullocks must expect to be impeded by  wet ground, as well as by the scarcity of water, in many situations where  horses could pass without difficulty. I directed the bullocks, that had  been driven forward with me, to be allowed to graze beside the water  until sunset, and then to be taken slowly back by moonlight to Mr.  Kennedy. Five had dropped down on the way, and had not come forward to  the water. Those sent back were also ordered to be allowed to feed all  the next day at Mr. Kennedy's camp, and only to start with the drays  there next evening, to come on by moonlight, thus avoiding the intense  heat, so oppressive under extreme thirst. The thermometer during the day,  rose to 103 deg. in the shade. Latitude of the camp on Narran swamp, 29 deg. 45'  51\" S. Thermometer at sunrise, 47 deg.; at noon, 97 deg.; at 4 P. M., 97 deg.; at 9,  69 deg.; ditto with wet bulb, 57 deg.. The height of this camp above the sea, the  average of five registered observations, is 442 feet.    8TH MARCH.--The view northward from our present camp was most extensive.  Far in the northeast a yellow slope presented the unusual appearance  there, of a cultivated country. It was doubtless ripe grass, yet still  the earth there had not even been imprinted with any hoof. Between that  slope and our camp, lay the element, in abundance, which had been so  scarce on the other side of the Darling. To the northward, at no great  distance, was the river, where, as our guides informed us, we should no  longer be ill off for water in pursuing our journey along its banks. I  set the carpenter to cut sleepers and slabbing to enable us to bridge the  muddy creek, for I had examined it early in the morning, and had crossed  it with my horse; although I found several watercourses almost as soft,  beyond. The natives maintained that the water in this extensive swamp  came neither from the east nor west, but from the river directly before  us, which came from the northward. Just behind our camp, to the  southward, was a gentle elevation, almost a hill, consisting of the usual  rock, felspar; and it seemed to me that this stony ground alone impeded  the further progress of the water towards the Barwan. The ridge trended  north-west, as most others did in this extensive basin; and this  direction being nearly parallel to that of the coast ranges further  northward, seemed to afford additional reason for expecting to find  anticlinal and synclinal lines, and, consequently, rivers, much in the  same direction. D'Urban's group, distant 150 miles lower down the  Darling, consisted of a quartzose rock, exactly similar to this,  exhibiting a tendency, like it, to break into irregular polygons, some of  the faces being curved. This rock is most extensively distributed in the  interior of New South Wales. It was not until the evening of this day  that the approach of the drays was announced, and then prematurely, the  teams only having been brought forward to the water without them. So weak  were the unfortunate animals, that not even by night, nor by doubling the  numbers, could they be made to draw the drays forward, for the short  distance of eight miles; a distance which we had been given to understand  was so much greater. Forward, all was most promising, and it may be  imagined how bitterly I regretted the alteration of my original plan of  equipment, which had reference to horses and light carts alone. A new  species of ANTHISTIRIA occurred here, perfectly distinct from the  kangaroo grass of the colony, very like APLUDA MUTICA, and remarkable for  the smooth shining appearance of the thin involucral leaves.[*] The  TRICHINIUM ALOPECUROIDEUM, in great abundance, was conspicuous, with its  long silky ears of green flowers. On the stony ground occurred a very  curious new woolly KOCHIA [**], also a species of CYPERUS; the TRICHINIUM  LANATUM in great perfection; a grass resembling the close reed  (CALAMAGROSTIS of England), and which proved to be the little-known  TRIRAPHIS MOLLIS. On the margin of the morass the DACTYLOCTENIUM  RADULANS, spreading over the interstices, reminded the traveller of the  grasses of Egypt; and, in stony ground near the morass, we observed the  JUSTICIA MEDIA of Brown. Thermometer at sunrise, 66 deg.; at noon, 98 deg.; at 4  P. M. 102 deg.; at 9, 81 deg.; ditto with wet bulb, 74 deg..    [* A. MEMBRANACEA (Lindl.

Amongst the trees, beyond the swamp, fine reaches of water  appeared in a river channel, apparently continuous to the northward, but  which, in the other direction, or towards the swamp, abruptly terminated  like a cul-de-sac. On my asking the natives where it went to, they  pointed to the various narrow water courses and the swamp as the final  depositories of the water. Admirable distribution of the contents of a  river in a country where water is so scarce, and the climate so hot and  dry! We proceeded along the margin of the \"Narran,\" which led us nearly  due north, until we forded it, at the desire of our guides, on a good  gravelly bottom, the water reaching to our saddle-flaps. Crossing a  slight elevation where the soil was gravelly, and in which grew the  shrubs of the ordinary scrubs with several interesting novelties, we  again came upon an angle of the Narran, and continued along its banks for  about thirty miles, until near sunset, when we tethered our horses, and  lay down for the night. The Narran was full of water every where, and  with this abundance of water there was also plenty of most excellent  grass. The PANICUM LOEVINODE of Dr. Lindley seemed to predominate, a  grass whereof the seed (\"Cooly\") is made by the natives into a kind of  paste or bread. Dry heaps of this grass, that had been pulled expressly  for the purpose of gathering the seed, lay along our path for many miles.  I counted nine miles along the river, in which we rode through this grass  only, reaching to our saddle-girths, and the same grass seemed to grow  back from the river, at least as far as the eye could reach through a  very open forest. I had never seen such rich natural pasturage in any  other part of New South Wales. Still it was what supplied the bread of  the natives; and these children of the soil were doing every thing in  their power to assist me, whose wheel tracks would probably bring the  white man's cattle into it. We had followed well-beaten paths of natives  during the whole of this day's ride, and most anxious were my guides and  I to see them; but they avoided us. Our guide was of that country, and  not at all unwilling or timid; but evidently very desirous to introduce  us to the inhabitants, and procure amongst them other guides to lead us  further. The night was very hot, and flies and mosquitos did their utmost  to prevent us from sleeping. Thermometer at sunrise, 75 deg.; at noon, 99 deg.;  at 4 P. M., 105 deg.; at 9, 83 deg.; ditto with wet bulb, 75 deg..    10TH MARCH.--Anxious for an interview with some of the natives, I  continued the pursuit of the Narran's course about five miles higher, but  with no better success. I then turned, after obtaining from our guide,  through Youranigh, what information could be gathered thus, as to the  river's further course, the best bank for the passage of our drays, etc.  We were still, he said, a long way from the \"Culgoa.\" There was no  perceptible change in the aspect of the \"Narran\" as far as we had  examined it, except that where we turned, there were flood-marks, and the  dead logs and river wreck, deposited on the upper side of trees and  banks, showing a current and high floods. The last of these, our guide  said, had occurred about five moons before. In"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9963"],[0,"Elsie's Girlhood (#17)"],[1," as old as he was. And your Aunts Louisa and Lora were both  engaged before they were sixteen. It's not at all uncommon for girls  in this part of the country to marry before they are that old. But I  know I'm not half good enough for you, Elsie. A king might be proud to  win you for his bride, and I'm only a poor, good-for-nothing cripple,  not worth anybody's acceptance.\" And he turned away his face, with  something that sounded very like a sob.    Elsie's kind heart was touched. \"No, Herbert, you must not talk so.  You are a dear, good, noble fellow, worthy of any lady in the land,\"  she said, half playfully, half tenderly and laying her little soft  white hand over his mouth.    He caught it in his and pressed it passionately to his lips, there  holding it fast. \"Oh, Elsie, if it were only mine to keep!\" he cried,  \"I'd be the happiest fellow in the world.\"    She looked at his pale, thin face, worn with suffering, into his eyes  so full of passionate entreaty; thought what a dear lovable fellow he  had always been, and forgot herself entirely--forgot everything but  the desire to relieve and comfort him, and make him happy.    \"Only tell me that you care for me, darling, and that you are willing  some day to belong to me! only give me a little hope; I shall die if  you don't!\"    \"I do care for you, Herbert; I would do anything in my power to make  you happy.\"    \"Then I may call you my own! Oh, darling, God bless you for your  goodness!\"    But the clock was striking nine, and with the sound, a sudden  recollection came to Elsie. \"It is my bed-time, and--and, Herbert, it  will all have to be just as papa says. I belong to him, and cannot  give myself away without his permission. Good-night.\" She hastily  withdrew the hand he still held, and was gone ere he had time to  reply.    \"What had she done--something of which papa would highly disapprove?  Would he be very much vexed with her?\" Elsie asked herself  half-tremblingly, as she sat passively under her old mammy's hands;  for her father's displeasure was the one thing she dreaded above all  others.    She was just ready for bed when a light tap on the door was followed  by the entrance of Mrs. Carrington.    \"I wish to see your young mistress alone for a few moments, Aunt  Chloe,\" she said, and the faithful creature went from the room at  once.    Mrs. Carrington threw her arms around Elsie, folded her in close,  loving embrace, and kissed her fondly again and again, \"My dear child,  how happy you have made me!\" she whispered at last. \"Herbert has told  me all. Dear boy, he could not keep such good news from his mother.  I know of nothing that could have brought me deeper joy and  thankfulness, for I have always had a mother's love for you.\"    Elsie felt bewildered, almost stunned. \"I--I'm afraid you--he has  misunderstood me; it--it must be as papa says,\" she stammered; \"I  cannot decide it for myself, I have no right.\"    \"Certainly, my dear, that is all very right, very proper; parents  should always be consulted in these matters. But your papa loves  you too well to raise any objection when he sees that your heart is  interested. And Herbert is worthy of you, though his mother says it;  he is a noble, true-hearted fellow, well-educated, handsome, talented,  polished in manners, indeed all that anybody could ask, if he were but  well; and we do not despair of seeing him eventually quite restored  to health. But I am keeping you up, and I know that your papa is  very strict and particular about your observance of his rules; so  good-night.\" And, with another caress, she left her.    Thought was very busy in Elsie's brain as she laid her head upon her  pillow. It was delightful to have given such joy and happiness to  Herbert and his mother. Lucy, too, she felt sure would be very glad  to learn that they were to be sisters. But her own papa, how would he  feel--what would he say? Only the other day he had reminded her how  entirely she belonged to him--that no other had the slightest claim  upon her, and as he spoke, the clasp of his arms seemed to say that he  would defy the whole world to take her from him. No, he would never  give her up; and somehow she was not at all miserable at the thought;  but on the contrary it sent a thrill of joy to her heart; it was so  sweet to be so loved and cherished by him, \"her own dear, dear papa!\"    But then another thing came to her remembrance; his pity for poor  suffering Herbert; his expressed willingness to do anything he could  to make him happy--and again she doubted whether he would accept or  reject the boy's suit for her hand.    Carrie and Enna were to leave at an early hour on Monday morning.  They came into Elsie's room for a parting chat while waiting for the  ringing of the breakfast bell; so the three went down together to  answer its summons, and thus she was spared the necessity of entering  the dining room alone--an ordeal she had really dreaded; a strange and  painful shyness toward the whole family at Ashlands having suddenly  come over her. She managed to conceal it pretty well, but carefully  avoided meeting Herbert's eye, or those of his parents.    The girls left directly on the conclusion of the meal, and having seen  them off, Elsie slipped away to her own room. But Lucy followed her  almost immediately, fairly wild with delight at the news Herbert had  just been giving her.    \"Oh, you darling!\" she cried, hugging her friend with all her might.  \"I never was so glad in all my life! To think that I'm to have you for  a sister! I could just eat you up!\"    \"I hope you won't,\" said Elsie, laughing and blushing, as she returned  the embrace as heartily as it was given. \"But we must not be too sure;  I'm not at all certain of papa's consent.\"    \"No, I just expect he'll object to Herbie on account of his lameness,  and his ill health. I don't think we ought to blame him if he does  either.\" And Lucy suddenly sobered down to more than her ordinary  gravity. \"Ah, I forgot,\" she said, a moment after; \"Herbert begs that  you will come down and let him talk with you a little if you are not  particularly engaged.\"    Elsie answering that she had nothing to do, her time was quite at  his disposal, the two tripped downstairs, each with an arm about  the other's waist, as they had done so often in the days of their  childhood.    They found Herbert on the veranda, not lying down, but seated on his  sofa. \"You are better this morning?\" Elsie said with a glad look up  into his face, as he rose, leaning on his crutch, and gave her the  other hand.    \"Yes, thank you, much better. Joy has proved so great a cordial that I  begin to hope it may work a complete cure.\" He drew her to a seat by  his side, and Lucy considerately went away and left them alone.    \"You have not changed your mind, Elsie?\" His tone was low and half  tremulous in its eagerness.    \"No, Herbert; but it all rests with papa, you know.\"    \"I hardly dare ask him for you, it seems like such presumption in a--a  cripple like me.\"    \"Don't say that, Herbert. Would you love me less if I should become  lame or ill?\"    \"No, no, never! but I couldn't bear to have any such calamity come  upon you. I can hardly bear that you should have a lame husband. The  thought of it makes my trial harder to bear than ever.\"    \"It is God's will, and we must not fight against it,\" she said softly.    They conversed for some time longer. He was very anxious to gain Mr.  Dinsmore's consent to their engagement, yet shrank from asking it,  fearing an indignant refusal; most of all, he dreaded a personal  interview; and, but ill able to take the ride to the Oaks, it was  finally decided between them that he should make his application by  letter, doing so at once.    A servant was summoned to bring him his writing materials, and Elsie  left him to his trying task, while she and Lucy and Harry mounted  their horses and were away for a brisk, delightful ride through the  woods and over the hills.    \"It's gone, Elsie,\" Herbert whispered, when she came down dressed for  dinner. \"I wrote it twice; it didn't suit me then, but my strength was  quite exhausted, so it had to go. I hope the answer will come soon,  but oh, I shall be almost afraid to open it.\"    \"Don't feel so; papa is very good and kind. He pities you so much,  too,\" and she repeated what he had said about being willing to do  anything he could for him.    Herbert's face grew bright with hope as he listened. \"And do you think  he'll answer at once?\" he asked.    \"Yes, papa is always very prompt and decided; never keeps one long in  suspense.\"    Mr. Carrington met our heroine at the dinner-table with such a bright,  glad smile, and treated her in so kind and fatherly a manner that she  felt sure he knew all, and was much pleased with the prospect before  them. But she was afraid Harry did not like it--did not want her for a  sister. He was usually very gay and talkative, full of fun and frolic.  He had been so during their ride, but now his manner seemed strangely  altered; he was moody and taciturn, almost cross.          CHAPTER X.      Keen are the pangs    Of hapless love and passion unapproved.      --SMOLLETT'S \"REGICIDE\"      Hardly anything could have been more distasteful to Horace Dinsmore  than the state of affairs revealed to him by Herbert Carrington's  note. He was greatly vexed, not at the lad's manner of preferring his  request, but that it should have been made at all. He was not ready,  yet to listen to such a proposal coming from any person, however  eligible, much less from one so sadly afflicted as poor Herbert. He  sought his wife's presence with the missive in his hand.    \"What is the matter, my dear?\" she asked; \"I have seldom seen you so  disturbed.\"    \"The most absurd nonsense! the most ridiculously provoking affair!  Herbert Carrington asking me to give him my daughter! I don't wonder  at your astonished look, Rose; a couple of silly children. I should  have given"]]]
