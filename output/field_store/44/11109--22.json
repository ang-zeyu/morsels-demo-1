The condition of other stars warrants the conclusion  that this obscuring envelope is the product of a process of  refrigeration which will gradually make the sun more and more variable  until its history ends in extinction. Looking backward, we see a time  when the sun must have been more brilliant than it is now. At that  time it probably shone with the blinding white splendor of such stars  as Sirius, Spica, and Vega; now it resembles the relatively dull  Procyon; in time it will turn ruddy and fall into the closing cycle  represented by Antares. Considering that once it must have been more  radiantly powerful than at present, one is tempted to wonder if that  could have been the time when tropical life flourished within the  earth's polar circles, sustained by a vivific energy in the sun which  it has now lost.    The corona, as we have said, varies with the sun-spot cycle. When the  spots are abundant and active the corona rises strong above the  spotted zones, forming immense beams or streamers, which on one  occasion, at least, had an observed length of ten million miles. At  the time of a spot minimum the corona is less brilliant and has a  different outline. It is then that the curved polar rays are most  conspicuous. Thus the vast banners of the sun, shaken out in the  eclipse, are signals to tell of its varying state, but it will  probably be long before we can read correctly their messages.    The Zodiacal Light Mystery    There is a singular phenomenon in the sky -- one of the most puzzling  of all -- which has long arrested the attention of astronomers,  defying their efforts at explanation, but which probably not one in a  hundred, and possibly not one in a thousand, of the readers of this  book has ever seen. Yet its name is often spoken, and it is a  conspicuous object if one knows when and where to look for it, and  when well seen it exhibits a mystical beauty which at the same time  charms and awes the beholder. It is called ``The Zodiacal Light,''  because it lies within the broad circle of the Zodiac, marking the  sun's apparent annual path through the stars. What it is nobody has  yet been able to find out with certainty, and books on astronomy  usually speak of it with singular reserve. But it has given rise to  many remarkable theories, and a true explanation of it would probably  throw light on a great many other celestial mysteries. The Milky Way  is a more wonderful object to look upon, but its nature can be  comprehended, while there is a sort of uncanniness about the Zodiacal  Light which immediately impresses one upon seeing it, for its part in  the great scheme of extra-terrestrial affairs is not evident.    If you are out-of-doors soon after sunset -- say, on an evening late  in the month of February -- you may perceive, just after the angry  flush of the dying winter's day has faded from the sky, a pale ghostly  presence rising above the place where the sun went down. The writer  remembers from boyhood the first time it was pointed out to him and  the unearthly impression that it made, so that he afterward avoided  being out alone at night, fearful of seeing the spectral thing again.  The phenomenon brightens slowly with the fading of the twilight, and  soon distinctly assumes the shape of an elongated pyramid of pearly  light, leaning toward the south if the place of observation is in the  northern hemisphere. It does not impress the observer at all in the  same manner as the Milky Way; that looks far off and is clearly among  the stars, but the Zodiacal Light seems closer at hand, as if it were  something more intimately concerning the earth. To all it immediately  suggests a connection, also, with the sunken sun. If the night is  clear and the moon absent (and if you are in the country, for city  lights ruin the spectacles of the sky), you will be able to watch the  apparition for a long time. You will observe that the light is  brightest near the horizon, gradually fading as the pyramidal beam  mounts higher, but in favorable circumstances it may be traced nearly  to the meridian south of the zenith, where its apex at last vanishes  in the starlight. It continues visible during the evenings of March  and part of April, after which, ordinarily, it is seen no more, or if  seen is relatively faint and unimpressive. But when autumn comes it  appears again, this time not like a wraith hovering above the westward  tomb of the day-god, but rather like a spirit of the morning  announcing his reincarnation in the east.    The reason why the Zodiacal Light is best seen in our latitudes at the  periods just mentioned is because at those times the Zodiac is more  nearly perpendicular to the horizon, first in the west and then in the  east; and, since the phenomenon is confined within the borders of the  Zodiac, it cannot be favorably placed for observation when the  zodiacal plane is but slightly inclined to the horizon. Its faint  light requires the contrast of a background of dark sky in order to be  readily perceptible. But within the tropics, where the Zodiac is  always at a favorable angle, the mysterious light is more constantly  visible. Nearly all observant travelers in the equatorial regions have  taken particular note of this phenomenon, for being so much more  conspicuous there than in the temperate zones it at once catches the  eye and holds the attention as a novelty. Humboldt mentions it many  times in his works, for his genius was always attracted by things out  of the ordinary and difficult of explanation, and he made many careful  observations on its shape, its brilliancy, and its variations; for  there can be no doubt that it does vary, and sometimes to an  astonishing degree. It is said that it once remained practically  invisible in Europe for several years in succession. During a trip to  South Africa in 1909 an English astronomer, Mr E. W. Maunder, found a  remarkable difference between the appearance of the Zodiacal Light on  his going and coming voyages. In fact, when crossing the equator going  south he did not see it at all; but on returning he had, on March 6th,  when one degree south of the equator, a memorable view of it.      It was a bright, clear night, and the Zodiacal Light was    extraordinarily brilliant -- brighter than he had ever seen it    before. The Milky Way was not to be compared with it. The brightest    part extended 75 deg. from the sun. There was a faint and much narrower    extension which they could just make out beyond the Pleiades along    the ecliptic, but the greater part of the Zodiacal Light showed as    a broad truncated column, and it did not appear nearly as conical    as he had before seen it.    When out of the brief twilight of intertropical lands, where the sun  drops vertically to the horizon and night rushes on like a wave of  darkness, the Zodiacal Light shoots to the very zenith, its color is  described as a golden tint, entirely different from the silvery sheen  of the Milky Way. If I may venture again to refer to personal  experiences and impressions, I will recall a view of the Zodiacal  Light from the summit of the cone of Mt Etna in the autumn of the year  1896 (more briefly described in Astronomy with the Naked Eye). There  are few lofty mountains so favorably placed as Etna for observations  of this kind. It was once resorted to by Prof. George E. Hale, in an  attempt to see the solar corona without an eclipse. Rising directly  from sea-level to an elevation of nearly eleven thousand feet, the  observer on its summit at night finds himself, as it were, lost in the  midst of the sky. But for the black flanks of the great cone on which  he stands he might fancy himself to be in a balloon. On the occasion  to which I refer the world beneath was virtually invisible in the  moonless night. The blaze of the constellations overhead was  astonishingly brilliant, yet amid all their magnificence my attention  was immediately drawn to a great tapering light that sprang from the  place on the horizon where the sun would rise later, and that seemed  to be blown out over the stars like a long, luminous veil. It was the  finest view of the Zodiacal light that I had ever enjoyed -- thrilling  in its strangeness -- but I was almost disheartened by the  indifference of my guide, to whom it was only a light and nothing  more. If he had no science, he had less poetry -- rather a remarkable  thing, I thought, for a child of his clime. The Light appeared to me  to be distinctly brighter than the visible part of the Milky Way which  included the brilliant stretches in Auriga and Perseus, and its color,  if one may speak of color in connection with such an object, seemed  richer than that of the galactic band; but I did not think of it as  yellow, although Humboldt has described it as resembling a golden  curtain drawn over the stars, and Du Chaillu in Equatorial Africa  found it of a bright yellow color. It may vary in color as in  conspicuousness. The fascination of that extraordinary sight has never  faded from my memory. I turned to regard it again and again, although  I had never seen the stellar heavens so brilliant, and it was one of  the last things I looked for when the morning glow began softly to  mount in the east, and Sicily and the Mediterranean slowly emerged  from the profound shadow beneath us.    The Zodiacal Light seems never to have attracted from astronomers in  general the amount of careful attention that it deserves; perhaps  because so little can really be made of it as far as explanation is  concerned. I have referred to the restraint that scientific writers  apparently feel in speaking of it. The grounds for speculation that it  affords may be too scanty to lead to long discussions, yet it piques  curiosity, and as we shall see in a moment has finally led to a most  interesting theory. Once it was the subject of an elaborate series "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6653"],[0,"Voyages of Samuel De Champlain — Volume 01 (#17)"],[1,"_quebio_, or _quebec_, signifying a  _narrowing_, and was descriptive of the form which the river takes at that  place, to which we have already referred.    A few days after their arrival, an event occurred of exciting interest to  Champlain and his little colony. One of their number, Jean du Val, an  abandoned wretch, who possessed a large share of that strange magnetic  power which some men have over the minds of others, had so skilfully  practised upon the credulity of his comrades that he had drawn them all  into a scheme which, aside from its atrocity, was weak and ill-contrived at  every point. It was nothing less than a plan to assassinate Champlain, seize  the property belonging to the expedition, and sell it to the Basque  fur-traders at Tadoussac, under the hallucination that they should be  enriched by the pillage. They had even entered into a solemn compact, and  whoever revealed the secret was to be visited by instant death. Their  purpose was to seize Champlain in an unguarded moment and strangle him, or  to shoot him in the confusion of a false alarm to be raised in the night by  themselves. But before the plan was fully ripe for execution, a barque  unexpectedly arrived from Tadoussac with an instalment of utensils and  provisions for the colony. One of the men, Antoine Natel, who had entered  into the conspiracy with reluctance, and had been restrained from a  disclosure by fear, summoned courage to reveal the plot to the pilot of the  boat, first securing from him the assurance that he should be shielded from  the vengeance of his fellow-conspirators. The secret was forthwith made  known to Champlain, who, by a stroke of finesse, placed himself beyond  danger before he slept. At his suggestion, the four leading spirits of the  plot were invited by one of the sailors to a social repast on the barque,  at which two bottles of wine which he pretended had been given him at  Tadoussac were to be uncorked. In the midst of the festivities, the \"four  worthy heads of the conspiracy,\" as Champlain satirically calls them, were  suddenly clapped into irons. It was now late in the evening, but Champlain  nevertheless summoned all the rest of the men into his presence, and  offered them a full pardon, on condition that they would disclose the whole  scheme and the motives which had induced them to engage in it. This they  were eager to do, as they now began to comprehend the dangerous compact  into which they had entered, and the peril which threatened their own  lives. These preliminary investigations rendered it obvious to Champlain  that grave consequences must follow, and he therefore proceeded with great  caution.    The next day, he took the depositions of the pardoned men, carefully  reducing them to writing. He then departed for Tadoussac, taking the four  conspirators with him. On consultation, he decided to leave them there,  where they could be more safely guarded until Pont Grave and the principal  men of the expedition could return with them to Quebec, where he proposed  to give them a more public and formal trial. This was accordingly done. The  prisoners were duly confronted with the witnesses. They denied nothing, but  freely admitted their guilt. With the advice and concurrence of Pont Grave,  the pilot, surgeon, mate, boatswain, and others, Champlain condemned the  four conspirators to be hung; three of them, however, to be sent home for a  confirmation or revision of their sentence by the authorities in France,  while the sentence of Jean Du Val, the arch-plotter of the malicious  scheme, was duly executed in their presence, with all the solemn forms and  ceremonies usual on such occasions. Agreeably to a custom of that period,  the ghastly head of Du Val was elevated on the highest pinnacle of the fort  at Quebec, looking down and uttering its silent warning to the busy  colonists below; the grim signal to all beholders, that \"the way of the  transgressor is hard.\"    The catastrophe, had not the plot been nipped in the bud, would have been  sure to take place. The final purpose of the conspirators might not have  been realized; it must have been defeated at a later stage; but the hand of  Du Val, prompted by a malignant nature, was nerved to strike a fatal blow,  and the life of Champlain would have been sacrificed at the opening of the  tragic scene.    The punishment of Du Val, in its character and degree, was not only  agreeable to the civil policy of the age, but was necessary for the  protection of life and the maintenance of order and discipline in the  colony. A conspiracy on land, under the present circumstances, was as  dangerous as a mutiny at sea; and the calm, careful, and dignified  procedure of Champlain in firmly visiting upon the criminal a severe though  merited punishment, reveals the wisdom, prudence, and humanity which were  prominent elements in his mental and moral constitution.

Had the distinguished navigators who early visited the coasts of North      America illustrated their narratives by drawings and maps, it would      have added greatly to their value. Capt. John Smith's map, though      necessarily indefinite and general, is indispensable to the      satisfactory study of his still more indefinite \"Description of New      England.\" It is, perhaps, a sufficient apology for the vagueness of      Smith's statements, and therefore it ought to be borne in mind, that      his work was originally written, probably, from memory, at least for      the most part, while he was a prisoner on board a French man-of-war in      1615. This may be inferred from the following statement of Smith      himself. In speaking of the movement of the French fleet, he says:      \"Still we spent our time about the Iles neere _Fyall_: where to keepe      my perplexed thoughts from too much meditation of my miserable estate,      I writ this discourse\" _Vide Description of New England_ by Capt. John      Smith, London, 1616.        While the descriptions of our coast left by Champlain are invaluable to      the historian and cannot well be overestimated, the process of making      these surveys, with his profound love of such explorations and      adventures, must have given him great personal satisfaction and      enjoyment. It would be difficult to find any region of similar extent      that could offer, on a summer's excursion, so much beauty to his eager      and critical eye as this. The following description of the Gulf of      Maine, which comprehends the major part of the field surveyed by      Champlain, that lying between the headlands of Cape Sable and Cape Cod,      gives an excellent idea of the infinite variety and the unexpected and      marvellous beauties that are ever revealing themselves to the voyager      as he passes along our coast.--        \"This shoreland is also remarkable, being so battered and frayed by sea      and storm, and worn perhaps by arctic currents and glacier beds, that      its natural front of some 250 miles is multiplied to an extent of not      less than 2,500 miles of salt-water line; while at an average distance      of about three miles from the mainland, stretches a chain of outposts      consisting of more than three hundred islands, fragments of the main,      striking in their diversity on the west; low, wooded and grassy to the      water's edge, and rising eastward through bolder types to the crowns      and cliffs of Mount Desert and Quoddy Head, an advancing series from      beauty to sublimity: and behind all these are deep basins and broad      river-mouths, affording convenient and spacious harbors, in many of      which the navies of nations might safely ride at anchor.... Especially      attractive was the region between the Piscataqua and Penobscot in its      marvellous beauty of shore and sea, of island and inlet, of bay and      river and harbor, surpassing any other equally extensive portion of the      Atlantic coast, and compared by travellers earliest and latest, with      the famed archipelago of the Aegean.\" _Vide Maine, Her Place in      History_, by Joshua L.

On the 18th of September, 1608, Pont Grave, having obtained his cargo of  furs and peltry, sailed for France.    The autumn was fully occupied by Champlain and his little band of colonists  in completing the buildings and in making such other provisions as were  needed against the rigors of the approaching winter. From the forest trees  beams were hewed into shape with the axe, boards and plank were cut from  the green wood with the saw, walls were reared from the rough stones  gathered at the base of the cliff, and plots of land were cleared near the  settlement, where wheat and rye were sown and grapevines planted, which  successfully tested the good qualities of the soil and climate.
