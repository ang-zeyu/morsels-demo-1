If the society is one that expects to own real estate, it should be  incorporated according to the laws of the state in which it is situated,  and for this purpose, some one on the committee on the Constitution  should consult a lawyer before this second meeting, so that the laws may  be conformed to.  In this case the trustees are usually instructed to  take the proper measures to have the society incorporated.    49. Constitutions, By-Laws, Rules of Order and Standing Rules.  In  forming a Constitution and By-Laws, it is always best to procure copies  of those adopted by several similar societies, and for the committee,  after comparing them, to select one as the basis of their own, amending  each article just as their own report is amended by the Society.  When  they have completed amending the Constitution, it is adopted by the  committee.  The By-Laws are treated in the same way, and then, having  finished the work assigned them, some one moves, \"That the committee  rise, and that the chairman (or some other    === Page 116 ===========================================================    member) report the Constitution and By-Laws to the assembly.\"  If this  is adopted, the Constitution and By-Laws are written out, and a brief  report made of this form:  \"Your committee, appointed to draft a  Constitution and By-Laws, would respectfully submit the following, with  the recommendation that they be adopted as the Constitution and By-Laws  of this society;\" which is signed by all the members of the committee  that concur in it.  Sometimes the report is only signed by the chairman  of the committee.    In the organization just given, it is assumed that both a Constitution  and By-Laws are adopted.  This is not always done; some societies adopt  only a Constitution, and others only By-Laws.  Where both are adopted,  the constitution usually contains only the following:    (1) Name and object of the society.  (2) Qualification of members.  (3) Officers, their election and duties.  (4) Meetings of the society (only including what is essential, leaving      details to the By-Laws).  (5) How to amend the Constitution.    These can be arranged in five articles, each article being subdivided  into sections.  The    === Page 117 ===========================================================    Constitution containing nothing but what is fundamental, it should be  made very difficult to amend; usually previous notice of the amendment  is required, and also a two-thirds or three-fourths vote for its  adoption [Sec. 73].  It is better not to require a larger vote than  two-thirds, and, where the meetings are frequent, an amendment should  not be allowed to be made except at a quarterly or annual meeting, after  having been proposed at the previous quarterly meeting.    The By-Laws contain all the other standing rules of the society, of such  importance that they should be placed out of the power of any one  meeting to modify; or they may omit the rules relating to the conduct of  business in the meetings, which would then constitute the Rules of Order  of the society.  Every society, in its By-Laws or Rules of Order, should  adopt a rule like this:  \"The rules contained in--(specifying the work  on parliamentary practice) shall govern the society in all cases to  which they are applicable, and in which they are not inconsistent with  the Rules of Order (or By-Laws) adopted by the society.\"  Without such a  rule, any one so disposed, could cause great trouble in a meeting.    === Page 118 ===========================================================    In addition to the Constitution, By-Laws and Rules of Order, in nearly  every society resolutions of a permanent nature are occasionally  adopted, which are binding on the society until they are rescinded or  modified.  These are called Standing Rules, and can be adopted by a  majority vote at any meeting.  After they have been adopted, they cannot  be modified at the same session except by a reconsideration [Sec. 60].  At  any future session they can be suspended, modified or rescinded by a  majority vote.  The Standing Rules, then, comprise those rules of a  society which have been adopted like ordinary resolutions, without the  previous notice, etc., required for By-Laws, and consequently, future  sessions of the society are at liberty to terminate them whenever they  please.  No Standing Rule (or other resolution) can be adopted which  conflicts with the Constitution, By-Laws or Rules of Order.* [In  practice these various classes of rules are frequently very much mixed.  The Standing Rules of some societies are really By-Laws, as the society  cannot suspend them, nor can they be amended until previous notice is  given.  This produces confusion without any corresponding benefit.  Standing Rules should contain only such rules as are subject to the will  of the majority of any meeting, and which it may be expedient to change  at any time, without the delay incident to giving previous notice.  Rules of Order should contain only the rules relating to the orderly  transaction of the business in the meetings of the society.  The By-Laws  should contain all the other rules of the society which are of too great  importance to be changed without giving notice to the society of such  change; provided that the most important of these can be placed in a  Constitution instead of in the By-Laws.  These latter three should  provide for their amendment.  The Rules of Order should provide for  their suspension.  The By-Laws sometimes provide for the suspension of  certain articles.  None of these three can be suspended without it is  expressly provided for.    === Page 119 ===========================================================    Art. X. Officers and Committees.    50. Chairman or President.  It is the duty of the chairman to call the  meeting to order at the appointed time, to preside at all the meetings,  to announce the business before the assembly in its proper order, to  state and put all questions properly brought before the assembly, to  preserve order and decorum, and to decide all questions of order  (subject to an appeal).  When he \"puts a question\" to vote, and when  speaking upon an appeal, he should stand;* [In meetings of boards of  managers, committees and other small bodies, the chairman usually  retains his seat, and even members in speaking do not rise.] in all  other cases he can sit.  In all cases where his vote would affect the  result, or where the vote is by ballot, he can vote.  When a member  rises to speak, he    === Page 120 ===========================================================    should say, \"Mr. Chairman,\" and the chairman should reply, \"Mr. A;\" he  should not interrupt a speaker as long as he is in order, but should  listen to his speech, which should be addressed to him and not to the  assembly.  The chairman should be careful to abstain from the appearance  of partizanship, but he has the right to call another member to the  chair while he addresses the assembly on a question; when speaking to a  question of order he does not leave the chair.    51. The Clerk, Secretary or Recording Secretary, as he is variously  called, should keep a record of the proceedings, the character of which  depends upon the kind of meeting.  In an occasional or mass meeting, the  record usually amounts to nothing, but he should always record every  resolution or motion that is adopted.    In a convention it is often desirable to keep a full record for  publication, and where it lasts for several days, it is usual, and  generally best, to appoint one or more assistant clerks.  Frequently it  is a tax on the judgment of the clerk to decide what to enter on the  record, or the \"Minutes,\" as it is usually called.  Sometimes the points  of each speech should be entered,    === Page 121 ===========================================================    and at other times only the remark that the question was discussed by  Messrs. A., B. and C. in the affirmative, and Messrs. D., E. and F. in  the negative.  Every resolution that is adopted should be entered, which  can be done in this form:  \"On motion of Mr. D. it was resolved that,  &c.\"    Sometimes a convention does its work by having certain topics previously  assigned to certain speakers, who deliver formal addresses or essays,  the subjects of which are afterwards open for discussion in short  speeches, of five minutes, for instance.  In such cases the minutes are  very brief, without they are to be published, when they should contain  either the entire addresses or carefully prepared abstracts of them, and  should show the drift of the discussion that followed each one.  In  permanent societies, where the minutes are not published, they consist  of a record of what was done and not what was said, and should be kept  in a book.    The Form of the Minutes can be as follows:    \"At a regular meeting of the M. L. Society, held in their hall, on  Tuesday evening, March 16, 1875, Mr. A. in the chair and Mr. B. acting  as secretary, the minutes of the previous meeting were read and    === Page 122 ===========================================================    approved.  The committee on Applications reported the names of Messrs.  C. and D. as applicants for membership; and on motion of Mr. F. they  were admitted as members.  The committee on --- reported a series of  resolutions, which were thoroughly discussed and amended, and finally  adopted as follows:    \"Resolved, That * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \"    On motion of Mr. L. the society adjourned.  L- B-, Secretary.    If the proceedings are to be published, the secretary should always  examine the published proceedings of similar meetings, so as to conform  to the custom, excepting where it is manifestly improper.    The Constitution, By-Laws"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9104"],[0,"The Naval War of 1812 (#17)"],[1,"herself, while the other would have escaped;  she preferred to run down close so as to insure the capture of both,  knowing that even at close quarters long guns are somewhat better  than short ones (not to mention her other advantages in thick  scantling, speed, etc.). The British carronades often upset in  action; this was either owing to their having been insufficiently  secured, and to this remaining undiscovered because the men were  not exercised at the guns, or else it was because the unpractised  sailors would greatly overcharge them. Our better-trained sailors  on the ocean rarely committed these blunders, but the less-skilled  crews on the lakes did so as often as their antagonists.    But while the Americans thus, as a rule, had heavier and better-fitted  guns, they labored under one or two disadvantages. Our foundries  were generally not as good as those of the British, and our guns,  in consequence, more likely to burst; it was an accident of this  nature which saved the British _Belvidera_; and the _General Pike_,  under Commodore Chauncy, and the new American frigate _Guerrière_  suffered in the same way; while often the muzzles of the guns would  crack. A more universal disadvantage was in the short weight of  our shot. When Captain Blakely sunk the _Avon_ he officially  reported that her four shot which came aboard weighed just 32  pounds apiece, a pound and three quarters more than his _heaviest_;  this would make his average shot about 2 1/2 pounds less, or  rather over 7 per cent. Exactly similar statements were made by  the officers of the _Constitution_ in her three engagements.  Thus when she fought the _Java_, she threw at a broadside, as  already stated, 704 pounds; the _Java_ mounted 28 long 18's, 18  32-pound carronades, 2 long 12's, and one shifting 24-pound  carronade, a broadside of 576 pounds. Yet by the actual weighing  of all the different shot on both sides it was found that the  difference in broadside force was only about 77 pounds, or the  _Constitution's_ shot were about 7 per cent, short weight. The  long 24's of the _United States_ each threw a shot but 4 1/4 pounds  heavier than the long 18's of the _Macedonian_; here again the  difference was about 7 per cent. The same difference existed in  favor of the _Penguin_ and _Epervier_ compared with the _Wasp_  and _Hornet_. Mr. Fenimore Cooper [Footnote: See \"Naval History,\"  i, p. 380.] weighed a great number of shot some time after the war.  The later castings, even weighed nearly 5 per cent, less than the  British shot, and some of the older ones, about 9 per cent. The  average is safe to take at 7 per cent. less, and I shall throughout  make this allowance for ocean cruisers. The deficit was sometimes  owing to windage, but more often the shot was of full size but  defective in density. The effect of this can be gathered from the  following quotation from the work of a British artillerist: \"The  greater the density of shot of like calibres, projected with equal  velocity and elevation, the greater the range, accuracy, and  penetration.\" [Footnote: \"Heavy Ordnance,\" Captain T. F. Simmons,  R. A., London, 1837. James supposes that the \"Yankee captains\"  have in each case hunted round till they could get particularly  small American shot to weigh; and also denies that short weight  is a disadvantage. The last proposition carried out logically  would lead to some rather astonishing results.] This defectiveness  in density might be a serious injury in a contest at a long  distance, but would make but little difference at close quarters  (although it may have been partly owing to their short weight  that so many of the Chesapeake's shot failed to penetrate the  _Shannon's_ hull). Thus in the actions with the _Macedonian_ and  _Java_ the American frigates showed excellent practice when the  contest was carried on within fair distance, while their first  broadsides at long range went very wild; but in the case of the  _Guerrière_, the _Constitution_ reserved her fire for close  quarters, and was probably not at all affected by the short  weight of her shot.    As to the officers and crew of a 44-gun frigate, the following was  the regular complement established by law: [Footnote: See State  Papers, vol. xiv, 159 (Washington, 1834).]      1 captain,    4 lieutenants,    2 lieutenants of marines,    2 sailing-masters,    2 master's mates,    7 midshipmen,    1 purser,    1 surgeon,    2 surgeon's mates,    1 clerk,    1 carpenter,    2 carpenter's mates,    1 boatswain,    2 boatswain's mates,    1 yeoman of gun-room,    1 gunner,   11 quarter gunners,    1 coxswain,    1 sailmaker,    1 cooper,    1 steward,    1 armorer,    1 master of arms,    1 cook,    1 chaplain.   __   50    120 able seamen,  150 ordinary seamen,   30 boys,   50 marines.  ___  400 in all.    An 18-gun ship had 32 officers and petty officers, 30 able seamen,  46 ordinary seamen, 12 boys, and 20 marines--140 in all. Sometimes  ships put to sea without their full complements (as in the case of  the first _Wasp_), but more often with supernumeraries aboard.  The weapons for close quarters were pikes, cutlasses, and a few  axes; while the marines and some of the topmen had muskets, and  occasionally rifles.    In comparing the forces of the contestants I have always given  the number of men in crew; but this in most cases was unnecessary.  When there were plenty of men to handle the guns, trim the sails,  make repairs, act as marines, etc., any additional number simply  served to increase the slaughter on board. The _Guerrière_  undoubtedly suffered from being short-handed, but neither the  _Macedonian_ nor _Java_ would have been benefited by the presence  of a hundred additional men. Barclay possessed about as many men  as Perry, but this did not give him an equality of force. The  _Penguin_ and _Frolic_ would have been taken just as surely had  the _Hornet_ and _Wasp_ had a dozen men less apiece than they did.  The principal case where numbers would help would be in a  hand-to-hand fight. Thus the _Chesapeake_ having fifty more men  than the _Shannon_ ought to have been successful; but she was not,  because the superiority of her crew in numbers was more than  counterbalanced by the superiority of the _Shannon's_ crew in  other respects. The result of the battle of Lake Champlain, which  was fought at anchor, with the fleets too far apart for musketry  to reach, was not in the slightest degree affected by the number  of men on either side, as both combatants had amply enough to  manage the guns and perform every other service.    In all these conflicts the courage of both parties is taken for  granted: it was not so much a factor in gaining the victory, as  one which if lacking was fatal to all chances of success. In the  engagements between regular cruisers, not a single one was gained  by superiority in courage. The crews of both the _Argus_ and  _Epervier_ certainly flinched; but had they fought never so  bravely they were too unskilful to win. The _Chesapeake's_ crew  could hardly be said to lack courage; it was more that they were  inferior to their opponents in discipline as well as in skill.    There was but one conflict during the war where the victory could  be said to be owing to superiority in pluck. This was when the  _Neufchatel_ privateer beat off the boats of the _Endymion_. The  privateersmen suffered a heavier proportional loss than their  assailants, and they gained the victory by sheer ability to stand  punishment.    For convenience in comparing them I give in tabulated form the  force of the three British 38's taken by American 44's (allowing  for short weight of metal of latter).
