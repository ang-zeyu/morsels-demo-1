In  commemoration of having been so well received, Newport erected \"a cross  as a sign of English dominion.\" With sweet words he quieted the  suspicions of Chief Powhatan, his friend. He \"told him that the arms (of  the cross) represented Powhatan and himself, and the middle their united  league.\"    DeSoto and his Spaniards were graciously received by the Indian Princess  Cofachiqui in the South. While on a sight-seeing tour they entered the  ancestral tombs of those Indians. DeSoto \"dipped into the pearls and  gave his two joined hands full to each cavalier to make rosaries of, he  said, to say prayers for their sins on. We imagine if their prayers were  in proportion to their sins they must have spent the most of their time  at their devotions.\"    It was in this fashion that the old world snatched away the fee in the  land of the new. It was in this fashion that America was divided  between the powers of Europe and the aborigines were dispossessed of  their country. The barbaric rule of might from which the paleface had  fled hither for refuge caught up with him again, and in the melee the  hospitable native suffered \"legal disability.\"    History tells that it was from the English and the Spanish our  government inherited its legal victims, the American Indians, whom to  this day we hold as wards and not as citizens of their own freedom  loving land. A long century of dishonor followed this inheritance of  somebody's loot. Now the time is at hand when the American Indian shall  have his day in court through the help of the women of America. The  stain upon America's fair name is to be removed, and the remnant of the  Indian nation, suffering from malnutrition, is to number among the  invited invisible guests at your dinner tables.    In this undertaking there must be cooperation of head, heart and hand.  We serve both our own government and a voiceless people within our  midst. We would open the door of American opportunity to the red man and  encourage him to find his rightful place in our American life. We would  remove the barriers that hinder his normal development.    Wardship is no substitute for American citizenship, therefore we seek  his enfranchisement. The many treaties made in good faith with the  Indian by our government we would like to see equitably settled. By a  constructive program we hope to do away with the \"piecemeal legislation\"  affecting Indians here and there which has proven an exceedingly  expensive and disappointing method.    Do you know what _your_ Bureau of Indian Affairs, in Washington, D.C.,  really is? How it is organized and how it deals with wards of the  nation? This is our first study. Let us be informed of facts and then we  may formulate our opinions. In the remaining space allowed me I shall  quote from the report of the Bureau of Municipal Research, in their  investigation of the Indian Bureau, published by them in the September  issue, 1915, No. 65, \"Municipal Research,\" 261 Broadway, New York City.  This report is just as good for our use today as when it was first made,  for very little, if any, change has been made in the administration of  Indian Affairs since then.      PREFATORY NOTE.    \"While this report was printed for the information of members of  Congress, it was not made a part of the report of the Joint Commission  of Congress, at whose request it was prepared, and is not available for  distribution.\"      UNPUBLISHED DIGEST OF STATUTORY AND TREATY PROVISIONS GOVERNING INDIAN  FUNDS.    \"When in 1913 inquiry was made into the accounting and reporting methods  of the Indian Office by the President's Commission on Economy and  Efficiency, it was found there was no digest of the provisions of  statutes and treaties with Indian tribes governing Indian funds and the  trust obligations of the government. Such a digest was therefore  prepared. It was not completed, however, until after Congress adjourned  March 4, 1913. Then, instead of being published, it found its way into  the pigeon-holes in the Interior Department and the Civil Service  Commission, where the working papers and unpublished reports of the  commission were ordered stored. The digest itself would make a document  of about three hundred pages.\"      UNPUBLISHED OUTLINE OF ORGANIZATION.    \"By order of the President, the commission, in cooperation with various  persons assigned to this work, also prepared at great pains a complete  analysis of the organization of every department, office and commission  of the federal government as of July 1, 1912. This represented a  complete picture of the government as a whole in summary outline; it  also represented an accurate picture of every administrative bureau,  office, and of every operative or field station, and showed in his  working relation each of the 500,000 officers and employes in the public  service. The report in typewritten form was one of the working documents  used in the preparation of the 'budget' submitted by President Taft to  Congress in February, 1913. The 'budget' was ordered printed by  Congress, but the cost thereof was to be charged against the President's  appropriation. There was not enough money remaining in this  appropriation to warrant the printing of the report on organization. It,  therefore, also found repose in a dark closet.\"      TOO VOLUMINOUS TO BE MADE PART OF THIS SERIES.    \"Congress alone could make the necessary provision for the publication  of these materials; the documents are too voluminous to be printed as a  part of this series, even if official permission were granted. It is  again suggested, however, that the data might be made readily accessible  and available to students by placing in manuscript division of the  Library of Congress one copy of the unpublished reports and working  papers of the President's Commission on Economy and Efficiency. This  action was recommended by the commission, but the only official action  taken was to order that the materials be placed under lock and key in  the Civil Service Commission.\"      NEED FOR SPECIAL CARE IN MANAGEMENT.    \"The need for special care in the management of Indian Affairs lies in  the fact that in theory of law the Indian has not the rights of a  citizen. He has not even the rights of a foreign resident. The Indian  individually does not have access to the courts; he can not individually  appeal to the administrative and judicial branches of the public service  for the enforcement of his rights. He himself is considered as a ward of  the United States. His property and funds are held in trust. * * * The  Indian Office is the agency of the government for administering both the  guardianship of the Indian and the trusteeship of his properties.\"      CONDITIONS ADVERSE TO GOOD ADMINISTRATION.    \"The legal status of the Indian and his property is the condition which  makes it incumbent on the government to assume the obligation of  protector. What is of special interest in this inquiry is to note the  conditions under which the Indian Office has been required to conduct  its business. In no other relation are the agents of the government  under conditions more adverse to efficient administration. The  influence which make for the infidelity to trusteeship, for subversion  of properties and funds, for the violation of physical and moral welfare  have been powerful. The opportunities and inducements are much greater  than those which have operated with ruinous effect on other branches of  public service and on the trustees and officers of our great private  corporations. In many instances, the integrity of these have been broken  down.\"      GOVERNMENT MACHINERY INADEQUATE.    \"* * * Behind the sham protection, which operated largely as a blind to  publicity, have been at all times great wealth in the form of Indian  funds to be subverted; valuable lands, mines, oil fields, and other  natural resources to be despoiled or appropriated to the use of the  trader; and large profits to be made by those dealing with trustees who  were animated by motives of gain. This has been the situation in which  the Indian Service has been for more than a century--the Indian during  all this time having his rights and properties to greater or less extent  neglected; the guardian, the government, in many instances, passive to  conditions which have contributed to his undoing.\"      OPPORTUNITIES STILL PRESENT.    \"And still, due to the increasing value of his remaining estate, there  is left an inducement to fraud, corruption, and institutional  incompetence almost beyond the possibility of comprehension. The  properties and funds of the Indians today are estimated at not less than  one thousand millions of dollars. There is still a great obligation to  be discharged, which must run through many years. The government itself  owes many millions of dollars for Indian moneys which it has converted  to its own use, and it is of interest to note that it does not know and  the officers do not know what is the present condition of the Indian  funds in their keeping.\"      PRIMARY DEFECTS.    \"* * * The story of the mismanagement of Indian Affairs is only a  chapter in the history of the mismanagement of corporate trusts. The  Indian has been the victim of the same kind of neglect, the same  abortive processes, the same malpractices as have the life insurance  policyholders, the bank depositor, the industrial and transportation  shareholder. The form of organization of the trusteeship has been one  which does not provide for independent audit and supervision. The  institutional methods and practices have been such that they do not  provide either a fact basis for official judgment or publicity of facts  which, if made available, would supply evidence of infidelity. In the  operation of this machinery, there has not been the means provided for  effective official scrutiny and the public"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10380"],[0,"Bible Stories and Religious Classics (#18)"],[1," so indurate that he would not  let them go, but would that they should make their sacrifice to God in  that land. But Moses would not so, but would go three days' journey in  desert, and sacrifice to God there. Pharaoh said: I will that ye go into  desert, but not far, and come soon again, and pray ye for me. And Moses  prayed for him to our Lord, and the flies voided that there was not one  left. And when they were gone Pharaoh would not keep his promise. Then  the fifth plague was that God showed his hand upon the fields and upon  the horses, asses, camels, sheep and oxen, and was a great pestilence on  all the beasts. And God showed a wonder miracle between the possessions  of the Egyptians and the possessions of his people of Israel, for of the  beasts of the children of Israel there was not one that perished. Yet  was Pharaoh so hard-hearted that he would not suffer the people to  depart. The sixth plague was that Moses took ashes out of the chimney  and cast on the land. And anon all the people of Egypt, as well men as  beasts, were full of blotches, boils, and blains and wounds, and  swellings in such wise that the enchanters could ne might not stand for  pain tofore Pharaoh. Yet would not Pharaoh hear them, nor do as God had  commanded. The seventh plague was a hail so great that there was never  none like tofore, and thunder and fire that it destroyed all the grass  and herbs of Egypt and smote down all that was in the field, men and  beasts. But in the land of Goshen was none heard ne harm done. Yet would  not Pharaoh deliver them. The eighth our Lord sent to them locusts,  which is a manner great fly, called in some place an adder-bolte, which  bit them and ate up all the corn and herbs that was left, in such wise  that the people came to Pharaoh and desired him to deliver, saying that  the land perished. Then Pharaoh gave to the men license to go and make  their sacrifice, and leave their wives and children there still, till  they came again, but Moses and Aaron said they must go all, wherefore he  would not let them depart. The ninth plague and vengeance was that God  sent so great darkness upon all the land of Egypt that the darkness was  so great and horrible that they were palpable, and it endured three days  and three nights. Wheresoever the children of Israel went it was light.    Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said to them: Go ye and make  your sacrifice unto your Lord God, and let your sheep and beasts only  abide. To whom Moses said: We shall take with us such hosties and  sacrifices as we shall offer to our Lord God. All our flocks and beasts  shall go with us, there shall not remain as much as a nail that shall be  necessary in the honor of our Lord God, for we know not what we shall  offer till we come to the place. Pharaoh was so indurate and  hard-hearted that he would not let them go, and bade Moses that he  should no more come in his sight. For when thou comest thou shalt die.  Moses answered: Be it as thou hast said: I shall no more come to thy  presence. And then our Lord said to Moses: There resteth now but one  plague and vengeance, and after that he shall let you go. But first say  to all the people that every man borrow of his friend, and woman of her  neighbor, vessels of gold and silver, and clothes; our Lord shall give  to his people grace and favor to borrow of the Egyptians; and then gave  to them a commandment how they should depart. And our Lord said to  Moses: At midnight I shall enter into Egypt and the first-begotten child  and heir of all Egypt shall die, from the first-begotten son of Pharaoh  that sitteth in his throne unto the first-begotten son of the handmaid  that sitteth at the mill, and all the first-begotten of the beasts.  There shall be a great cry and clamor in all the land of Egypt in such  wise that there was never none like, ne never shall be after, and among  all the children there shall not an hound be hurt, ne woman, ne beast,  whereby ye shall know by what miracle God divideth the Egyptian and  Israel. Moses and Aaron showed all these signs and plagues tofore  Pharaoh, and his heart was so indurate that he would not let them  depart. Then when Moses had said to the children how they should do,  they departed, and ate their paschal lamb, and all other ceremonies as  be expressed in the Bible, for a law to endure ever among them, which  the children of Israel obeyed and accomplished, it was so that at  midnight our Lord smote and slew every first-begotten son throughout all  the land of Egypt, beginning at the first son and heir of Pharaoh unto  the son of the caitiff that lay in prison, and also the first-begotten  of the beasts. Pharaoh arose in the night and all his servants and all  Egypt, and there was a great clamor and sorrowful noise and cry, for  there was not a house in all Egypt but there lay therein one that was  dead. Then Pharaoh did do call Moses and Aaron in the night, and said:  Arise ye and go your way from my people, ye and the children of Israel,  as ye say ye will, take your sheep and beasts with you like as ye  desired, and at your departing bless ye me. The Egyptians constrained  the children to depart and go their way hastily, saying: We all shall  die. The children of Israel took their meal, and put it on their  shoulders as they were commanded, and borrowed vessels of silver and of  gold, and much clothing. Our Lord gave to them such favor tofore the  Egyptians that the Egyptians lent to them all that they desired, and  they spoiled and robbed Egypt.    And so the children of Israel departed, nigh the number of six hundred  thousand footmen, besides women and children which were innumerable, and  an huge great multitude of beasts of divers kinds. The time that the  children of Israel had dwelt in Egypt was four hundred years. And so  they departed out of Egypt, and went not the right way by the  Philistines, but our Lord led them by the way of desert which is by the  Red Sea. And the children descended out of Egypt armed. Moses took with  him the bones of Joseph for he charged them so to do when he died. They  went in the extreme ends of the wilderness, and our Lord went tofore  them by day in a column of a cloud, and by night in a column of fire and  was their leader and duke; the pillar of the cloud failed never by day,  nor the pillar of fire by night tofore the people. Our Lord said to  Moses, I shall make his heart so hard that he shall follow and pursue  you, and I shall be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his host, the  Egyptians shall know that I am Lord. And anon it was told to Pharaoh  that the children of Israel fled, and anon his heart was changed, and  also the heart of his servants, and said: What shall we do, shall we  suffer the children to depart and no more to serve us? Forthwith he took  his chariot and all his people with him. He took with him six hundred  chosen chariots, and all the chariots and wains of Egypt, and the dukes  of all his hosts and he pursued the children of Israel and followed them  in great pride. And when he approached, that the children of Israel saw  him come, they were sore afraid and cried to our Lord God, and said to  Moses: Was there not sepulchre enough for us in Egypt but that we must  now die in wilderness? Said we not to thee: Go from us and let us serve  the Egyptians: It had been much better for us to have served the  Egyptians than to die here in wilderness. And Moses said to the people:  Be ye not afraid, stand and see ye the great wonders that our Lord shall  do for you this day. The Egyptians that ye now see, ye shall never see  them after this day. God shall fight for you, and be ye still. Our Lord  said then to Moses: What criest thou to me? Say to the children of  Israel that they go forth. Take thou and raise the rod, and stretch thy  hand upon the sea, and depart it that the children of Israel may go dry  through the middle of it. I shall so indurate the heart of Pharaoh that  he shall follow you, and all the Egyptians, and I shall be glorified in  Pharaoh, and in all his host, his carts and horsemen. And the Egyptians  shall know that I am Lord when I shall so be glorified. The angel of God  went tofore the castles of Israel, and another came after in the cloud  which stood between them of Egypt and the children of Israel. And the  cloud was dark that the host of Israel might not come to them of all the  night. Then Moses stretched his hand upon the sea, and there came a wind  blowing in such wise that it waxed dry, and the children of Israel went  in through the midst of the Red Sea all dry foot; for the water stood up  as a wall on the right side and on the left side. The Egyptians then  pursuing them followed and entered after them, and all the carts,  chariots and horsemen, through the middle of the sea. And then our Lord  beheld that the children of Israel were passed over and were on the dry  land, on that other side. Anon turned the water on them, and the wheels  on their carts turned up so down, and drowned all the host of Pharaoh,  and sank down into the deep of the sea. Then said the Egyptians: Let us  flee Israel; the Lord fighteth for them against us. And our Lord said to  Moses: Stretch out thine hand upon the sea, and let the water return  upon the Egyptians, and upon their chariots and horsemen. And so Moses  stretched out his hand and the sea returned in to his first place. And  then the Egyptians would have fled, but the water came and overflowed  them in the midst of the flood, and it covered the chariots and  horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh, and there was not one saved of  them. And the children of Israel had passed through the middle of the  dry sea and came a-land.    Thus delivered our Lord the children of Israel from the hand of the  Egyptians, and they saw the Egyptians lying dead upon the brinks of the  sea. And the people then dreaded our Lord and believed in him, and to  Moses his servant. Then Moses and the children"]]]
