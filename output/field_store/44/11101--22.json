It was able to take advantage of its natural resources to  rapidly develop its agricultural and manufacturing industries and to  make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II.  Long-term concerns include pollution, particularly depletion of the ozone  layer, and management and conservation of coastal areas, especially the  Great Barrier Reef. A referendum to change Australia's status, from a  commonwealth headed by the British monarch to an independent republic,  was defeated in 1999.

The state of matters all over the country was so alarming, that George  I shortened his intended stay in Hanover, and returned in all haste to  England. He arrived on the 11th of November, and Parliament was summoned  to meet on the 8th of December. In the mean time, public meetings were  held in every considerable town of the empire, at which petitions were  adopted, praying the vengeance of the Legislature upon the South Sea  directors, who, by their fraudulent practices, had brought the nation to  the brink of ruin. Nobody seemed to imagine that the nation itself was  as culpable as the South Sea Company. Nobody blamed the credulity and  avarice of the people,--the degrading lust of gain, which had swallowed  up every nobler quality in the national character, or the infatuation  which had made the multitude run their heads with such frantic eagerness  into the net held out for them by scheming projectors. These things were  never mentioned. The people were a simple, honest, hard-working people,  ruined by a gang of robbers, who were to be hanged, drawn, and quartered  without mercy.    This was the almost unanimous feeling of the country. The two Houses of  Parliament were not more reasonable. Before the guilt of the South  Sea directors was known, punishment was the only cry. The King, in his  speech from the throne, expressed his hope that they would remember that  all their prudence, temper, and resolution were necessary to find out  and apply the proper remedy for their misfortunes. In the debate on the  answer to the address, several speakers indulged in the most violent  invectives against the directors of the South Sea project. The Lord  Molesworth was particularly vehement. \"It had been said by some, that  there was no law to punish the directors of the South Sea Company, who  were justly looked upon as the authors of the present misfortunes of  the state. In his opinion they ought, upon this occasion, to follow the  example of the ancient Romans, who, having no law against parricide,  because their legislators supposed no son could be so unnaturally wicked  as to embrue his hands in his father's blood, made a law to punish this  heinous crime as soon as it was committed. They adjudged the guilty  wretch to be sown in a sack, and thrown alive into the Tyber. He looked  upon the contrivers and executors of the villanous South Sea scheme as  the parricides of their country, and should be satisfied to see them  tied in like manner in sacks, and thrown into the Thames.\" Other members  spoke with as much want of temper and discretion. Mr. Walpole was more  moderate. He recommended that their first care should be to restore  public credit. \"If the city of London were on fire, all wise men would  aid in extinguishing the flames, and preventing the spread of the  conflagration before they inquired after the incendiaries. Public credit  had received a dangerous wound, and lay bleeding, and they ought to  apply a speedy remedy to it. It was time enough to punish the assassin  afterwards.\" On the 9th of December an address, in answer to his  Majesty's speech, was agreed upon, after an amendment, which was  carried without a division, that words should be added expressive of the  determination of the House not only to seek a remedy for the national  distresses, but to punish the authors of them.    The inquiry proceeded rapidly. The directors were ordered to lay before  the House a full account of all their proceedings. Resolutions were  passed to the effect that the calamity was mainly owing to the vile  arts of stockjobbers, and that nothing could tend more to the  re-establishment of public credit than a law to prevent this infamous  practice. Mr. Walpole then rose, and said, that \"as he had previously  hinted, he had spent some time upon a scheme for restoring public  credit, but that, the execution of it depending upon a position which  had been laid down as fundamental, he thought it proper, before he  opened out his scheme, to be informed whether he might rely upon  that foundation. It was, whether the subscription of public debts and  encumbrances, money subscriptions, and other contracts, made with the  South Sea Company should remain in the present state?\" This question  occasioned an animated debate. It was finally agreed, by a majority of  259 against 117, that all these contracts should remain in their present  state, unless altered for the relief of the proprietors by a general  court of the South Sea Company, or set aside by due course of law. On  the following day Mr. Walpole laid before a committee of the whole  House his scheme for the restoration of public credit, which was, in  substance, to ingraft nine millions of South Sea stock into the Bank  of England, and the same sum into the East India Company, upon certain  conditions. The plan was favourably received by the House. After some  few objections, it was ordered that proposals should be received from  the two great corporations. They were both unwilling to lend their aid,  and the plan met with a warm but fruitless opposition at the general  courts summoned for the purpose of deliberating upon it. They, however,  ultimately agreed upon the terms on which they would consent to  circulate the South Sea bonds, and their report, being presented to  the committee, a bill was brought in, under the superintendence of Mr.  Walpole, and safely carried through both Houses of Parliament.    A bill was at the same time brought in, for restraining the South Sea  directors, governor, sub-governor, treasurer, cashier, and clerks from  leaving the kingdom for a twelvemonth, and for discovering their estates  and effects, and preventing them from transporting or alienating the  same. All the most influential members of the House supported the bill.  Mr. Shippen, seeing Mr. Secretary Craggs in his place, and believing  the injurious rumours that were afloat of that minister's conduct in the  South Sea business, determined to touch him to the quick. He said, he  was glad to see a British House of Commons resuming its pristine vigour  and spirit, and acting with so much unanimity for the public good.  It was necessary to secure the persons and estates of the South Sea  directors and their officers; \"but,\" he added, looking fixedly at Mr.  Craggs as he spoke, \"there were other men in high station, whom, in  time, he would not be afraid to name, who were no less guilty than  the directors.\" Mr. Craggs arose in great wrath, and said, that if the  innuendo were directed against him, he was ready to give satisfaction to  any man who questioned him, either in the House or out of it. Loud cries  of order immediately arose on every side. In the midst of the uproar  Lord Molesworth got up, and expressed his wonder at the boldness of Mr.  Craggs in challenging the whole House of Commons. He, Lord Molesworth,  though somewhat old, past sixty, would answer Mr. Craggs whatever he  had to say in the House, and he trusted there were plenty of young men  beside him, who would not be afraid to look Mr. Craggs in the face, out  of the House. The cries of order again resounded from every side; the  members arose simultaneously; everybody seemed to be vociferating at  once. The Speaker in vain called order. The confusion lasted several  minutes, during which Lord Molesworth and Mr. Craggs were almost the  only members who kept their seats. At last the call for Mr. Craggs  became so violent that he thought proper to submit to the universal  feeling of the House, and explain his unparliamentary expression. He  said, that by giving satisfaction to the impugners of his conduct in  that House, he did not mean that he would fight, but that he would  explain his conduct. Here the matter ended, and the House proceeded to  debate in what manner they should conduct their inquiry into the affairs  of the South Sea Company, whether in a grand or a select committee.  Ultimately, a Secret Committee of thirteen was appointed, with power to  send for persons, papers, and records.    The Lords were as zealous and as hasty as the Commons. The Bishop  of Rochester said the scheme had been like a pestilence. The Duke of  Wharton said the House ought to show no respect of persons; that, for  his part, he would give up the dearest friend he had, if he had been  engaged in the project. The nation had been plundered in a most shameful  and flagrant manner, and he would go as far as anybody in the punishment  of the offenders. Lord Stanhope said, that every farthing possessed  by the criminals, whether directors or not directors, ought to be  confiscated, to make good the public losses.    During all this time the public excitement was extreme. We learn, front  Coxe's Walpole, that the very name of a South Sea director was thought  to be synonymous with every species of fraud and villany. Petitions  from counties, cities, and boroughs, in all parts of the kingdom, were  presented, crying for the justice due to an injured nation and the  punishment of the villanous peculators. Those moderate men, who would  not go to extreme lengths, even in the punishment of the guilty, were  accused of being accomplices, were exposed to repeated insults and  virulent invectives, and devoted, both in anonymous letters and public  writings, to the speedy vengeance of an injured people. The accusations  against Mr. Aislabie, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Craggs,  another member of the ministry, were so loud, that the House of Lords  resolved to proceed at once into the investigation concerning them. It  was ordered, on the 21st of January, that all brokers concerned in the  South Sea scheme should lay before the House an account of the stock  or subscriptions bought or sold by them for any of the officers of the  Treasury or Exchequer, or in trust for any of them, since Michaelmas  1719. When this account was delivered, it appeared that large quantities  of stock had been transferred"]]]
