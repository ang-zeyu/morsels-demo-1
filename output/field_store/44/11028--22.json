[Illustration: A HUNTER'S WAGGON, RHODESIA    Photo by Wilson, Aberdeen]    Of fascinating interest is the story--a story for the most part yet  untold to the world--of Cecil Rhodes' long struggle with the Boers and  Portuguese who attempted to keep the Empire-builder out of the Promised  Land, and of his frequent forestallings of further German expansion at  our expense. The first, the most critical and anxious period of all, was  occupied with the contest for the very gate of the country, the  right-of-way to the north, which we were so nearly losing, and without  which our advance would have been hopelessly barred. The only outlet to  the north from the Cape Colony lay through Bechuanaland, a vast region  that was divided into several independent native kingdoms, and hemmed in  between the Germans, then advancing from the west, and the Transvaal  Boers on the east. This gateway to the north has been likened to the  neck of a bottle; the narrow neck which, once passed, opens out into the  broad and precious Zambesia. Kruger, clever and obstinate, commenced his  career of attempted expansion by seizing this neck with the intention of  thus cutting us off completely from the north. It was his ambition to  extend the Boer rule westward to the German line, eastward to Delagoa  Bay and the Indian Ocean, and northwards over the steppes of Zambesia.  Pretorius had declared that the Transvaal had no boundary on the west,  unless it were the Atlantic Ocean. The first struggle therefore between  Rhodes and Kruger was for this vital point of vantage, the neck. Had  Kruger grasped it the British flag would never have floated on the  northern plateau, the Boers and Germans would have joined hands--there  had been a talk of a German Protectorate over the Transvaal--and theirs,  not ours, would have been the splendid prize. And what is more, seeing  what a vast conspiracy had been organised against us, we should probably  have lost the Cape Colony itself: the foundations of our Empire would  have been shaken. Immense was the threatening peril to which we shut our  eyes. The Transvaal War had left the Cape Colonists in a distinctly  anti-British frame of mind. Disgusted at the follies of the Imperial  Government, even those of British blood sympathised with the Transvaal  Boers, and had no objection to the north falling into the hands of the  Dutch Republicans. Indeed, the general feeling at the Cape at that time  appears to have been republican. Cecil Rhodes had not only to  out-manoeuvre Germany, the Transvaal, and Portugal, but had also to  overcome the opposition of colonial prejudice, and the complete  indifference of the English to all affairs South African. He stood  almost alone, and had to create a party for himself. Not only man of  action, but diplomatist and opportunist in the best sense of the word,  he played his game with wondrous skill, and succeeded at last in winning  over the reluctant colonists to his views. The very Africander Bond  became his ally for a time.    [Illustration: CAPE TO CAIRO RAILWAY. LAYING THE RAILS]    That struggle for the neck of Bechuanaland is an interesting story that  cannot be told here. First Kruger attempted to establish himself in  Mankoroane's territory. Mankoroane, to protect himself, offered to cede  his country to the Cape Colony, which point-blank refused it. Rhodes, in  1882, went himself to the chieftain, and so arranged matters that the  Imperial Government found itself compelled to take over the district.  Thwarted at this point, Kruger attempted to cut us off further to the  north, and sent his agents to establish the freebooting republics of  Goshen and Stellaland. Again Rhodes checked him. Going himself to  Stellaland, he persuaded the Boers in possession to accept the British  flag on the condition that our Government ratified their titles to the  land they had occupied. The Warren expedition, despatched at last in  consequence of the strong representations of Rhodes and his far-seeing  ally, Sir Hercules Robinson, the then High Commissioner, resulted in the  expulsion of the Boer freebooters from Montsioa's country, where  Mafeking now stands, and the extension of our protectorate over the  whole of Bechuanaland. Then Rhodes arranged for the taking over of  Khama's land, and the gateway to the north was won. Foiled again, and  thus hemmed in on the west, the stubborn Kruger sent his very able agent  Grobler to Lobengula to obtain from him a Matabele concession to the  Transvaal. Rhodes found that it was hopeless to attempt to bring the  Imperial Government to a sense of the danger of the position, so now,  before it was too late, he had to act promptly for himself. He sent  Maguire Thomson and Rudd to Lobengula to obtain a concession from him  before Grobler had carried out his mission. They were successful; the  Governor ratified the concession. Dr. Jameson and Dr. Harris went to  Matabeleland to deliver to the king the stipulated arms and ammunition;  and despite the bitter opposition of the Cape statesman and consistently  anti-British Englishman, Mr. Merriman, the deed of concession was  sealed, and its validity was recognised by the Government. And thus in  1888, after years of patient endeavour, Cecil Rhodes at last had made  the way clear for the realisation of his mighty scheme.    The sinews of war had now to be found; and Rhodes, in anticipation,  before the granting of the concession, had made his provisions. First he  had brought about the amalgamation of the diamond-mining companies, and  then, as head of the great De Beers Corporation with its rent-roll of  four millions sterling a year, he, in 1887, effected the alteration of  the De Beers Trust Deed by a liquidation of the Company, so as to give  the De Beers directors power to apply the Company's funds to outside  objects, that is, to the development of the North. Messrs. Barnato and  Beit agreed to this on the condition of being made life governors, and  ever since loyally co-operated with Rhodes in the execution of his  scheme.    The next step was the granting of the charter by the British Government  in 1889, and the creation of the British South Africa Company. Then  Rhodes sent out the famous Pioneer Expedition to Mashonaland, and the  white men established themselves in Rhodesia. It must be borne in mind  that at that time and for years afterwards Rhodes had to be ever closely  watching and cunningly circumventing the German Boers and Portuguese,  who spared no effort to keep us from the north. Bismarck's agent, Count  Pffeil, was sent on a secret mission to South Africa and all but  succeeded in anticipating Rhodes, and in winning for Germany a broad  strip of territory that would have connected her eastern and western  possessions, so forming a bar across Africa from ocean to ocean that  would have effectually shut us out. Then there was the Boer trek into  Mashonaland in 1891, when the Rhodesians guarded the drifts against the  invaders--a scheme of Kruger's that was frustrated without the shedding  of blood. Even when the Pioneer Expedition was on its way, the  energetic Portuguese D'Andrade was distributing the flags of his country  among the chiefs, and attempting to get concessions that would cut  Mashonaland off from Matabeleland. To defeat his plans Rhodes entered  into a treaty with Umtassa, and obtained the Gazaland concession from  Gungunyana, a concession which would have extended the Chartered  Company's possessions to the shores of the Indian Ocean had not Lord  Salisbury refused to ratify it and acknowledged the claims of Portugal.  Then again in 1889 Rhodes, whose Intelligence Department always supplied  him in good time with information as to the doings of his rivals,  hearing that Germany intended to cut us off at the head of Lake Nyassa,  secretly sent Mr. H. H. Johnson to hoist British flags at Port Abercorn  on Lake Tanganyika and other places, as proof of our occupation. The  Portuguese also hoped to erect a wall against our expansion by  connecting her eastern and western territories, and for this purpose an  expedition set out from Angola to seize the Barotse country, but here  Rhodes again forestalled them; his mission was the first to arrive in  the country, and Barotseland was placed under our protection. The way  these things were done by Rhodes' agents, the hardships endured, the  perils incurred by these adventurous men who--unlike the Portuguese  agents who were always accompanied by large bands of armed men--plunged  alone into these savage regions to carry out their hazardous missions,  makes a wonderful story indeed of British pluck and enterprise.    The Pioneer Expedition set out in June 1890. The Pioneer Column, which  had been enrolled by Major Frank Johnson, consisted of 187 men who had  decided to try their fortunes in the new country, and it was accompanied  by 650 mounted police, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Pennefather.  The famous hunter, Selous, acted as guide. The ox-waggons carried  provisions and other stores sufficient to supply the whole force for six  months. For four hundred miles the Pioneers marched into Mashonaland,  constructing a road as they went, and making drifts at the many rivers  to enable the waggons to cross. Forts were built at intervals, and small  garrisons were left in them. At last they came to their objective point,  Mount Hampden; and hard by it they built Fort Salisbury, now the capital  of all Rhodesia. The Pioneer Force was now disbanded, each man  receiving, in addition to his pay, the right to peg out fifteen gold  claims and 3000 acres of land. The men scattered over the country,  prospecting for gold and pegging out their claims and farms. The first  rainy season was a terrible one for them; it was an exceptionally bad  year; all transport was interrupted, supplies fell short; the men had to  live on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#17)"],[1,"from the cheek of a walrus,  he told her, was equal to porterhouse; seal meat wasn't bad, but one  grew tired of it quickly unless he was an Eskimo; polar bear meat was  filling but tough and strong. He liked whale meat, especially the  tail-steaks of narwhal, and cold boiled blubber was good in the winter,  only it was impossible to cook it because of lack of fuel, unless one  was aboard ship or had an alcohol stove in his outfit. The tidbit of  the Eskimo was birds' eggs, gathered by the ton in summer-time, rotten  before cold weather came, and frozen solid as chunks of ice in winter.  Through one starvation period of three weeks he had lived on them  himself, crunching them raw in his mouth as one worries away with a  piece of rock candy. The little lines gathered in Mary Josephine's  forehead at this, but they smoothed away into laughter when he  humorously described the joy of living on nothing at all but air. And  he added to this by telling her how the gluttonous Eskimo at feast-time  would lie out flat on their backs so that their womenfolk could feed  them by dropping chunks of flesh into their open maws until their  stomachs swelled up like the crops of birds overstuffed with grain.    It was a successful breakfast. When it was over, Keith felt that he had  achieved a great deal. Before they rose from the table, he startled  Mary Josephine by ordering Wallie to bring him a cold chisel and a  hammer from Brady's tool-chest.    \"I've lost the key that opens my chest, and I've got to break in,\" he  explained to her.    Mary Josephine's little laugh was delicious. \"After what you told me  about frozen eggs, I thought perhaps you were going to eat some,\" she  said.    She linked her arm in his as they walked into the big room, snuggling  her head against his shoulder so that, leaning over, his lips were  buried in one of the soft, shining coils of her hair. And she was  making plans, enumerating them on the tips of her fingers. If he had  business outside, she was going with him. Wherever he went she was  going. There was no doubt in her mind about that. She called his  attention to a trunk that had arrived while he slept, and assured him  she would be ready for outdoors by the time he had opened his chest.  She had a little blue suit she was going to wear. And her hair? Did it  look good enough for his friends to see? She had put it up in a hurry.    \"It is beautiful, glorious,\" he said.    Her face pinked under the ardency of his gaze. She put a finger to the  tip of his nose, laughing at him. \"Why, Derry, if you weren't my  brother I'd think you were my lover! You said that as though you meant  it TERRIBLY much. Do you?\"    He felt a sudden dull stab of pain, \"Yes, I mean it. It's glorious. And  so are you, Mary Josephine, every bit of you.\"    On tiptoe she gave him the warm sweetness of her lips again. And then  she ran away from him, joy and laughter in her face, and disappeared  into her room. \"You must hurry or I shall beat you,\" she called back to  him.          XIII      In his own room, with the door closed and locked, Keith felt again that  dull, strange pain that made his heart sick and the air about him  difficult to breathe.    \"IF YOU WEREN'T MY BROTHER.\"    The words beat in his brain. They were pounding at his heart until it  was smothered, laughing at him and taunting him and triumphing over him  just as, many times before, the raving voices of the weird wind-devils  had scourged him from out of black night and arctic storm. HER BROTHER!  His hand clenched until the nails bit into his flesh. No, he hadn't  thought of that part of the fight! And now it swept upon him in a  deluge. If he lost in the fight that was ahead of him, his life would  pay the forfeit. The law would take him, and he would hang. And if he  won--she would be his sister forever and to the end of all time! Just  that, and no more. His SISTER! And the agony of truth gripped him that  it was not as a brother that he saw the glory in her hair, the glory in  her eyes and face, and the glory in her slim little, beautiful  body--but as the lover. A merciless preordination had stacked the cards  against him again. He was Conniston, and she was Conniston's sister.    A strong man, a man in whom blood ran red, there leaped up in him for a  moment a sudden and unreasoning rage at that thing which he had called  fate. He saw the unfairness of it all, the hopelessness of it, the  cowardly subterfuge and trickery of life itself as it had played  against him, and with tightly set lips and clenched hands he called  mutely on God Almighty to play the game square. Give him a chance! Give  him just one square deal, only one; let him see a way, let him fight a  man's fight with a ray of hope ahead! In these red moments hope  emblazoned itself before his eyes as a monstrous lie. Bitterness rose  in him until he was drunk with it, and blasphemy filled his heart.  Whichever way he turned, however hard he fought, there was no chance of  winning. From the day he killed Kirkstone the cards had been stacked  against him, and they were stacked now and would be stacked until the  end. He had believed in God, he had believed in the inevitable ethics  of the final reckoning of things, and he had believed strongly that an  impersonal Something more powerful than man-made will was behind him in  his struggles. These beliefs were smashed now. Toward them he felt the  impulse of a maddened beast trampling hated things under foot. They  stood for lies--treachery--cheating--yes, contemptible cheating! It was  impossible for him to win. However he played, whichever way he turned,  he must lose. For he was Conniston, and she was Conniston's sister, AND  MUST BE TO THE END OF TIME.    Faintly, beyond the door, he heard Mary Josephine singing. Like a bit  of steel drawn to a tension his normal self snapped back into place.  His readjustment came with a lurch, a subtle sort of shock. His hands  unclenched, the tense lines in his face relaxed, and because that God  Almighty he had challenged had given to him an unquenchable humor, he  saw another thing where only smirking ghouls and hypocrites had rent  his brain with their fiendish exultations a moment before. It was  Conniston's face, suave, smiling, dying, triumphant over life, and  Conniston was saying, just as he had said up there in the cabin on the  Barren, with death reaching out a hand for him, \"It's queer, old top,  devilish queer--and funny!\"    Yes, it was funny if one looked at it right, and Keith found himself  swinging back into his old view-point. It was the hugest joke life had  ever played on him. His sister! He could fancy Conniston twisting his  mustaches, his cool eyes glimmering with silent laughter, looking on  his predicament, and he could fancy Conniston saying: \"It's funny, old  top, devilish funny--but it'll be funnier still when some other man  comes along and carries her off!\"    And he, John Keith, would have to grin and bear it because he was her  brother!    Mary Josephine was tapping at his door.    \"Derwent Conniston,\" she called frigidly, \"there's a female person on  the telephone asking for you. What shall I say?\"    \"Er--why--tell her you're my sister, Mary Josephine, and if it's Miss  Kirkstone, be nice to her and say I'm not able to come to the 'phone,  and that you're looking forward to meeting her, and that we'll be up to  see her some time today.\"    \"Oh, indeed!\"    \"You see,\" said Keith, his mouth close to the door, \"you see, this Miss  Kirkstone--\"    But Mary Josephine was gone.    Keith grinned. His illimitable optimism was returning. Sufficient for  the day that she was there, that she loved him, that she belonged to  him, that just now he was the arbiter of her destiny! Far off in the  mountains he dreamed of, alone, just they two, what might not happen?  Some day--    With the cold chisel and the hammer he went to the chest. His task was  one that numbed his hands before the last of the three locks was  broken. He dragged the chest more into the light and opened it. He was  disappointed. At first glance he could not understand why Conniston had  locked it at all. It was almost empty, so nearly empty that he could  see the bottom of it, and the first object that met his eyes was an  insult to his expectations--an old sock with a huge hole in the toe of  it. Under the sock was an old fur cap not of the kind worn north of  Montreal. There was a chain with a dog-collar attached to it, a  hip-pocket pistol and a huge forty-five, and not less than a hundred  cartridges of indiscriminate calibers scattered loosely about. At one  end, bundled in carelessly, was a pair of riding-breeches, and under  the breeches a pair of white shoes with rubber soles. There was neither  sentiment nor reason to the collection in the chest. It was junk. Even  the big forty-five had a broken hammer, and the pistol, Keith thought,  might have stunned a fly at close range. He pawed the things over with  the cold chisel, and the last thing he came upon--buried under what  looked like a cast-off sport shirt--was a pasteboard shoe box. He  raised the cover. The box was full of papers.    Here was promise. He transported the box to Brady's table and sat down.  He examined the larger papers first. There were a couple of old game  licenses for Manitoba, half a dozen pencil-marked maps, chiefly of the  Peace River country, and a number of letters from the secretaries of  Boards of Trade pointing out the incomparable possibilities their  respective districts held for the homesteader and the buyer of land.  Last of all came a number of newspaper clippings and a packet of  letters.    Because they were loose he seized upon the clippings first, and as his  eyes fell upon the first paragraph of the first clipping his body  became suddenly tensed in the shock of unexpected discovery and amazed  interest. There were six of the clippings, all from English papers,  English in their terseness, brief"]]]
