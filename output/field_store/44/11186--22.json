Never was thy Romagna without war  In her proud tyrants' bosoms, nor is now:  But open war there left I none.  The state,  Ravenna hath maintain'd this many a year,  Is steadfast.  There Polenta's eagle broods,  And in his broad circumference of plume  O'ershadows Cervia. The green talons grasp  The land, that stood erewhile the proof so long,  And pil'd in bloody heap the host of France.    \"The old mastiff of Verruchio and the young,  That tore Montagna in their wrath, still make,  Where they are wont, an augre of their fangs.    \"Lamone's city and Santerno's range  Under the lion of the snowy lair.  Inconstant partisan! that changeth sides,  Or ever summer yields to winter's frost.  And she, whose flank is wash'd of Savio's wave,  As 'twixt the level and the steep she lies,  Lives so 'twixt tyrant power and liberty.    \"Now tell us, I entreat thee, who art thou?  Be not more hard than others.  In the world,  So may thy name still rear its forehead high.\"    Then roar'd awhile the fire, its sharpen'd point  On either side wav'd, and thus breath'd at last:  \"If I did think, my answer were to one,  Who ever could return unto the world,  This flame should rest unshaken.  But since ne'er,  If true be told me, any from this depth  Has found his upward way, I answer thee,  Nor fear lest infamy record the words.    \"A man of arms at first, I cloth'd me then  In good Saint Francis' girdle, hoping so  T' have made amends.  And certainly my hope  Had fail'd not, but that he, whom curses light on,  The high priest again seduc'd me into sin.  And how and wherefore listen while I tell.  Long as this spirit mov'd the bones and pulp  My mother gave me, less my deeds bespake  The nature of the lion than the fox.  All ways of winding subtlety I knew,  And with such art conducted, that the sound  Reach'd the world's limit.  Soon as to that part  Of life I found me come, when each behoves  To lower sails and gather in the lines;  That which before had pleased me then I rued,  And to repentance and confession turn'd;  Wretch that I was! and well it had bested me!  The chief of the new Pharisees meantime,  Waging his warfare near the Lateran,  Not with the Saracens or Jews (his foes  All Christians were, nor against Acre one  Had fought, nor traffic'd in the Soldan's land),  He his great charge nor sacred ministry  In himself, rev'renc'd, nor in me that cord,  Which us'd to mark with leanness whom it girded.  As in Socrate, Constantine besought  To cure his leprosy Sylvester's aid,  So me to cure the fever of his pride  This man besought: my counsel to that end  He ask'd: and I was silent: for his words  Seem'd drunken: but forthwith he thus resum'd:  'From thy heart banish fear: of all offence  I hitherto absolve thee.  In return,  Teach me my purpose so to execute,  That Penestrino cumber earth no more.  Heav'n, as thou knowest, I have power to shut  And open: and the keys are therefore twain,  The which my predecessor meanly priz'd.'\"    Then, yielding to the forceful arguments,  Of silence as more perilous I deem'd,  And answer'd: \"Father! since thou washest me  Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall,  Large promise with performance scant, be sure,  Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.\"    \"When I was number'd with the dead, then came  Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark  He met, who cried: 'Wrong me not; he is mine,  And must below to join the wretched crew,  For the deceitful counsel which he gave.  E'er since I watch'd him, hov'ring at his hair,  No power can the impenitent absolve;  Nor to repent and will at once consist,  By contradiction absolute forbid.'\"  Oh mis'ry! how I shook myself, when he  Seiz'd me, and cried, \"Thou haply thought'st me not  A disputant in logic so exact.\"  To Minos down he bore me, and the judge  Twin'd eight times round his callous back the tail,  Which biting with excess of rage, he spake:  \"This is a guilty soul, that in the fire  Must vanish.  Hence perdition-doom'd I rove  A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb.\"    When he had thus fulfill'd his words, the flame  In dolour parted, beating to and fro,  And writhing its sharp horn.  We onward went,  I and my leader, up along the rock,  Far as another arch, that overhangs  The foss, wherein the penalty is paid  Of those, who load them with committed sin.          CANTO XXVIII    WHO, e'en in words unfetter'd, might at full  Tell of the wounds and blood that now I saw,  Though he repeated oft the tale? No tongue  So vast a theme could equal, speech and thought  Both impotent alike.  If in one band  Collected, stood the people all, who e'er  Pour'd on Apulia's happy soil their blood,  Slain by the Trojans, and in that long war  When of the rings the measur'd booty made  A pile so high, as Rome's historian writes  Who errs not, with the multitude, that felt  The grinding force of Guiscard's Norman steel,  And those the rest, whose bones are gather'd yet  At Ceperano, there where treachery  Branded th' Apulian name, or where beyond  Thy walls, O Tagliacozzo, without arms  The old Alardo conquer'd; and his limbs  One were to show transpierc'd, another his  Clean lopt away; a spectacle like this  Were but a thing of nought, to the hideous sight  Of the ninth chasm.  A rundlet, that hath lost  Its middle or side stave, gapes not so wide,  As one I mark'd, torn from the chin throughout  Down to the hinder passage: 'twixt the legs  Dangling his entrails hung, the midriff lay  Open to view, and wretched ventricle,  That turns th' englutted aliment to dross.    Whilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze,  He ey'd me, with his hands laid his breast bare,  And cried; \"Now mark how I do rip me! lo!    \"How is Mohammed mangled! before me  Walks Ali weeping, from the chin his face  Cleft to the forelock; and the others all  Whom here thou seest, while they liv'd, did sow  Scandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent.  A fiend is here behind, who with his sword  Hacks us thus cruelly, slivering again  Each of this ream, when we have compast round  The dismal way, for first our gashes close  Ere we repass before him.  But say who  Art thou, that standest musing on the rock,  Haply so lingering to delay the pain  Sentenc'd upon thy crimes?\"--\"Him death not yet,\"  My guide rejoin'd, \"hath overta'en, nor sin  Conducts to torment; but, that he may make  Full trial of your state, I who am dead  Must through the depths of hell, from orb to orb,  Conduct him.  Trust my words, for they are true.\"    More than a hundred spirits, when that they heard,  Stood in the foss to mark me, through amazed,  Forgetful of their pangs.  \"Thou, who perchance  Shalt shortly view the sun, this warning thou  Bear to Dolcino: bid him, if he wish not  Here soon to follow me, that with good store  Of food he arm him, lest impris'ning snows  Yield him a victim to Novara's power,  No easy conquest else.\"  With foot uprais'd  For stepping, spake Mohammed, on the ground  Then fix'd it to depart.  Another shade,  Pierc'd in the throat, his nostrils mutilate  E'en from beneath the eyebrows, and one ear  Lopt off, who with the rest through wonder stood  Gazing, before the rest advanc'd, and bar'd  His wind-pipe, that without was all o'ersmear'd  With crimson stain.  \"O thou!\" said he, \"whom sin  Condemns not, and whom erst (unless too near  Resemblance do deceive me) I aloft  Have seen on Latian ground, call thou to mind  Piero of Medicina, if again  Returning, thou behold'st the pleasant land  That from Vercelli slopes to Mercabo;    \"And there instruct the twain, whom Fano boasts  Her worthiest sons, Guido and Angelo,  That if 't is giv'n us here to scan aright  The future, they out of life's tenement  Shall be cast forth, and whelm'd under the waves  Near to Cattolica, through perfidy  Of a fell tyrant.  'Twixt the Cyprian isle  And Balearic, ne'er hath Neptune seen  An injury so foul, by pirates done  Or Argive crew of old.  That one-ey'd traitor  (Whose realm there is a spirit here were fain  His eye had still lack'd sight of) them shall bring  To conf'rence with him, then so shape his end,  That they shall need not 'gainst Focara's wind  Offer up vow nor pray'r.\"  I answering thus:    \"Declare, as thou dost wish that I above  May carry tidings of thee, who is he,  In whom that sight doth wake such sad remembrance?\"    Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheek-bone  Of one, his fellow-spirit, and his jaws  Expanding, cried: \"Lo! this is he I wot of;  He speaks not for himself: the outcast this  Who overwhelm'd the doubt in Caesar's mind,  Affirming that delay to men prepar'd  Was ever harmful.\"  Oh  how terrified  Methought was Curio, from whose throat was cut  The tongue, which spake that hardy word.  Then one  Maim'd of each hand, uplifted in the gloom  The bleeding stumps, that they with gory spots  Sullied his face, and cried: \"'Remember thee  Of Mosca, too, I who, alas! exclaim'd,  'The deed once done there is an end,' that prov'd  A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race.\"    I added: \"Ay, and death to thine own tribe.\"    Whence heaping woe on woe he hurried off,  As one grief-stung to madness.  But I there  Still linger'd to behold the troop, and saw  Things, such as I may fear without more proof  To tell of, but that conscience makes me firm,  The boon companion, who her strong breast-plate  Buckles on him, that feels no guilt within  And bids him on and fear not.  Without doubt  I saw, and yet it seems to pass before me,  A headless trunk, that even as the rest  Of the sad flock pac'd onward.  By the hair  It bore the sever'd member, lantern-wise  Pendent in hand, which look'd at us and said,    \"Woe's me!\"  The spirit lighted thus himself,  And two there were in one, and one in two.  How that may be he knows who ordereth so."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8795"],[0,"The Divine Comedy (#17)"],[1,"sons upon their mother gaz'd  From sad Lycurgus rescu'd, such my joy  (Save that I more represt it) when I heard  From his own lips the name of him pronounc'd,  Who was a father to me, and to those  My betters, who have ever us'd the sweet  And pleasant rhymes of love.  So nought I heard  Nor spake, but long time thoughtfully I went,  Gazing on him; and, only for the fire,  Approach'd not nearer.  When my eyes were fed  By looking on him, with such solemn pledge,  As forces credence, I devoted me  Unto his service wholly.  In reply  He thus bespake me: \"What from thee I hear  Is grav'd so deeply on my mind, the waves  Of Lethe shall not wash it off, nor make  A whit less lively.  But as now thy oath  Has seal'd the truth, declare what cause impels  That love, which both thy looks and speech bewray.\"    \"Those dulcet lays,\" I answer'd, \"which, as long  As of our tongue the beauty does not fade,  Shall make us love the very ink that trac'd them.\"    \"Brother!\"  he cried, and pointed at a shade  Before him, \"there is one, whose mother speech  Doth owe to him a fairer ornament.  He in love ditties and the tales of prose  Without a rival stands, and lets the fools  Talk on, who think the songster of Limoges  O'ertops him.  Rumour and the popular voice  They look to more than truth, and so confirm  Opinion, ere by art or reason taught.  Thus many of the elder time cried up  Guittone, giving him the prize, till truth  By strength of numbers vanquish'd.  If thou own  So ample privilege, as to have gain'd  Free entrance to the cloister, whereof Christ  Is Abbot of the college, say to him  One paternoster for me, far as needs  For dwellers in this world, where power to sin  No longer tempts us.\"  Haply to make way  For one, that follow'd next, when that was said,  He vanish'd through the fire, as through the wave  A fish, that glances diving to the deep.    I, to the spirit he had shown me, drew  A little onward, and besought his name,  For which my heart, I said, kept gracious room.  He frankly thus began: \"Thy courtesy  So wins on me, I have nor power nor will  To hide me.  I am Arnault; and with songs,  Sorely lamenting for my folly past,  Thorough this ford of fire I wade, and see  The day, I hope for, smiling in my view.  I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up  Unto the summit of the scale, in time  Remember ye my suff'rings.\"  With such words  He disappear'd in the refining flame.          CANTO XXVII    Now was the sun so station'd, as when first  His early radiance quivers on the heights,  Where stream'd his Maker's blood, while Libra hangs  Above Hesperian Ebro, and new fires  Meridian flash on Ganges' yellow tide.    So day was sinking, when the' angel of God  Appear'd before us.  Joy was in his mien.  Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink,  And with a voice, whose lively clearness far  Surpass'd our human, \"Blessed are the pure  In heart,\" he Sang: then near him as we came,  \"Go ye not further, holy spirits!\"  he cried,  \"Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list  Attentive to the song ye hear from thence.\"    I, when I heard his saying, was as one  Laid in the grave.  My hands together clasp'd,  And upward stretching, on the fire I look'd,  And busy fancy conjur'd up the forms  Erewhile beheld alive consum'd in flames.    Th' escorting spirits turn'd with gentle looks  Toward me, and the Mantuan spake: \"My son,  Here torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death.  Remember thee, remember thee, if I  Safe e'en on Geryon brought thee: now I come  More near to God, wilt thou not trust me now?  Of this be sure: though in its womb that flame  A thousand years contain'd thee, from thy head  No hair should perish.  If thou doubt my truth,  Approach, and with thy hands thy vesture's hem  Stretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief.  Lay now all fear, O lay all fear aside.  Turn hither, and come onward undismay'd.\"  I still, though conscience urg'd' no step advanc'd.    When still he saw me fix'd and obstinate,  Somewhat disturb'd he cried: \"Mark now, my son,  From Beatrice thou art by this wall  Divided.\"  As at Thisbe's name the eye  Of Pyramus was open'd (when life ebb'd  Fast from his veins), and took one parting glance,  While vermeil dyed the mulberry; thus I turn'd  To my sage guide, relenting, when I heard  The name, that springs forever in my breast.    He shook his forehead; and, \"How long,\" he said,  \"Linger we now?\"  then smil'd, as one would smile  Upon a child, that eyes the fruit and yields.  Into the fire before me then he walk'd;  And Statius, who erewhile no little space  Had parted us, he pray'd to come behind.    I would have cast me into molten glass  To cool me, when I enter'd; so intense  Rag'd the conflagrant mass.  The sire belov'd,  To comfort me, as he proceeded, still  Of Beatrice talk'd.  \"Her eyes,\" saith he,  \"E'en now I seem to view.\"  From the other side  A voice, that sang, did guide us, and the voice  Following, with heedful ear, we issued forth,  There where the path led upward.  \"Come,\" we heard,  \"Come, blessed of my Father.\"  Such the sounds,  That hail'd us from within a light, which shone  So radiant, I could not endure the view.  \"The sun,\" it added, \"hastes: and evening comes.  Delay not: ere the western sky is hung  With blackness, strive ye for the pass.\"  Our way  Upright within the rock arose, and fac'd  Such part of heav'n, that from before my steps  The beams were shrouded of the sinking sun.    Nor many stairs were overpass, when now  By fading of the shadow we perceiv'd  The sun behind us couch'd: and ere one face  Of darkness o'er its measureless expanse  Involv'd th' horizon, and the night her lot  Held individual, each of us had made  A stair his pallet: not that will, but power,  Had fail'd us, by the nature of that mount  Forbidden further travel.  As the goats,  That late have skipp'd and wanton'd rapidly  Upon the craggy cliffs, ere they had ta'en  Their supper on the herb, now silent lie  And ruminate beneath the umbrage brown,  While noonday rages; and the goatherd leans  Upon his staff, and leaning watches them:  And as the swain, that lodges out all night  In quiet by his flock, lest beast of prey  Disperse them; even so all three abode,  I as a goat and as the shepherds they,  Close pent on either side by shelving rock.    A little glimpse of sky was seen above;  Yet by that little I beheld the stars  In magnitude and rustle shining forth  With more than wonted glory.  As I lay,  Gazing on them, and in that fit of musing,  Sleep overcame me, sleep, that bringeth oft  Tidings of future hap.  About the hour,  As I believe, when Venus from the east  First lighten'd on the mountain, she whose orb  Seems always glowing with the fire of love,  A lady young and beautiful, I dream'd,  Was passing o'er a lea; and, as she came,  Methought I saw her ever and anon  Bending to cull the flowers; and thus she sang:  \"Know ye, whoever of my name would ask,  That I am Leah: for my brow to weave  A garland, these fair hands unwearied ply.  To please me at the crystal mirror, here  I deck me.  But my sister Rachel, she  Before her glass abides the livelong day,  Her radiant eyes beholding, charm'd no less,  Than I with this delightful task.  Her joy  In contemplation, as in labour mine.\"    And now as glimm'ring dawn appear'd, that breaks  More welcome to the pilgrim still, as he  Sojourns less distant on his homeward way,  Darkness from all sides fled, and with it fled  My slumber; whence I rose and saw my guide  Already risen.  \"That delicious fruit,  Which through so many a branch the zealous care  Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day  Appease thy hunger.\"  Such the words I heard  From Virgil's lip; and never greeting heard  So pleasant as the sounds.  Within me straight  Desire so grew upon desire to mount,  Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings  Increasing for my flight.  When we had run  O'er all the ladder to its topmost round,  As there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix'd  His eyes, and thus he spake: \"Both fires, my son,  The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen,  And art arriv'd, where of itself my ken  No further reaches.  I with skill and art  Thus far have drawn thee.  Now thy pleasure take  For guide.  Thou hast o'ercome the steeper way,  O'ercome the straighter.  Lo! the sun, that darts  His beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb,  The arboreta and flowers, which of itself  This land pours forth profuse!  Will those bright eyes  With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste  To succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,  Or wander where thou wilt.  Expect no more  Sanction of warning voice or sign from me,  Free of thy own arbitrement to choose,  Discreet, judicious.  To distrust thy sense  Were henceforth error.  I invest thee then  With crown and mitre, sovereign o'er thyself.\"          CANTO XXVIII    Through that celestial forest, whose thick shade  With lively greenness the new-springing day  Attemper'd, eager now to roam, and search  Its limits round, forthwith I left the bank,  Along the champain leisurely my way  Pursuing, o'er the ground, that on all sides  Delicious odour breath'd.  A pleasant air,  That intermitted never, never veer'd,  Smote on my temples, gently, as a wind  Of softest influence: at which the sprays,  Obedient all, lean'd trembling to that part  Where first the holy mountain casts his shade,  Yet were not so disorder'd, but that still  Upon their top the feather'd quiristers  Applied their wonted art, and with full joy  Welcom'd those hours of prime, and warbled shrill  Amid the leaves, that to their jocund lays  inept tenor; even as from branch to branch,  Along the piney forests on the shore  Of Chiassi, rolls the gath'ring melody,  When Eolus hath from his cavern loos'd  The dripping south.  Already had my steps,  Though slow, so far into that ancient wood  Transported me, I could not ken the place  Where I had enter'd, when behold! my path  Was bounded by a rill, which to the left  With little"]]]
