I have often been irritated, though it would be comic if the  consequences were not so awful, by observing how men shut one  another in a delusion and cannot get out of this magic circle.    The first question, the first doubt of a Russian who is beginning  to think, is a question about the ikons, and still more the  miraculous relics: Is it true that they are genuine, and that  miracles are worked through them?  Hundreds of thousands of men  put this question to themselves, and their principal difficulty in  answering it is the fact that bishops, metropolitans, and all men  in positions of authority kiss the relics and wonder-working  ikons.  Ask the bishops and men in positions of authority why they  do so, and they will say they do it for the sake of the people,  while the people kiss them because the bishops and men in  authority do so.    In spite of all the external varnish of modernity, learning, and  spirituality which the members of the Church begin nowadays to  assume in their works, their articles, their theological journals,  and their sermons, the practical work of the Russian Church  consists of nothing more than keeping the people in their present  condition of coarse and savage idolatry, and worse still,  strengthening and diffusing superstition and religious ignorance,  and suppressing that living understanding of Christianity which  exists in the people side by side with idolatry.    I remember once being present in the monks' bookshop of the Optchy  Hermitage while an old peasant was choosing books for his  grandson, who could read.  A monk pressed on him accounts of  relics, holidays, miraculous ikons, a psalter, etc.  I asked the  old man, \"Has he the Gospel?\"  \"No.\"  \"Give him the Gospel in  Russian,\" I said to the monk.  \"That will not do for him,\"  answered the monk.  There you have an epitome of the work of our  Church.    But this is only in barbarous Russia, the European and American  reader will observe.  And such an observation is just, but only so  far as it refers to the government, which aids the Church in its  task of stultification and corruption in Russia.    It is true that there is nowhere in Europe a government so  despotic and so closely allied with the ruling Church.  And  therefore the share of the temporal power in the corruption of the  people is greatest in Russia.  But it is untrue that the Russian  Church in its influence on the people is in any respect different  from any other church.    The churches are everywhere the same, and if the Catholic, the  Anglican, or the Lutheran Church has not at hand a government as  compliant as the Russian, it is not due to any indisposition to  profit by such a government.    The Church as a church, whatever it may be--Catholic, Anglican,  Lutheran, Presbyterian--every church, in so far as it is a church,  cannot but strive for the same object as the Russian Church.  That object is to conceal the real meaning of Christ's teaching  and to replace it by their own, which lays no obligation on them,  excludes the possibility of understanding the true teaching of  Christ, and what is the chief consideration, justifies the  existence of priests supported at the people's expense.    What else has Catholicism done, what else is it doing in its  prohibition of reading the Gospel, and in its demand for  unreasoning submission to Church authorities and to an infallible  Pope?  Is the religion of Catholicism any other than that of the  Russian Church?  There is the same external ritual, the same  relics, miracles, and wonder-working images of Notre Dame, and the  same processions; the same loftily vague discussions of  Christianity in books and sermons, and when it comes to practice,  the same supporting of the present idolatry.  And is not the same  thing done in Anglicanism, Lutheranism, and every denomination of  Protestantism which has been formed into a church?  There is the  same duty laid on their congregations to believe in the dogmas  expressed in the fourth century, which have lost all meaning for  men of our times, and the same duty of idolatrous worship, if not  of relics and ikons, then of the Sabbath Day and the letter of the  Bible.  There is always the same activity directed to concealing  the real duties of Christianity, and to putting in their place an  external respectability and cant, as it is so well described by  the English, who are peculiarly oppressed by it.  In Protestantism  this tendency is specially remarkable because it has not the  excuse of antiquity.  And does not exactly the same thing show  itself even in contemporary revivalism--the revived Calvinism and  Evangelicalism, to which the Salvation Army owes its origin?    Uniform is the attitude of all the churches to the teaching of  Christ, whose name they assume for their own advantage.    The inconsistency of all church forms of religion with the  teaching of Christ is, of course, the reason why special efforts  are necessary to conceal this inconsistency from people.  Truly,  we need only imagine ourselves in the position of any grown-up  man, not necessarily educated, even the simplest man of the  present day, who has picked up the ideas that are everywhere in  the air nowadays of geology, physics, chemistry, cosmography, or  history, when he, for the first time, consciously compares them  with the articles of belief instilled into him in childhood, and  maintained by the churches--that God created the world in six  days, and light before the sun; that Noah shut up all the animals  in his ark, and so on; that Jesus is also God the Son, who created  all before time was; that this God came down upon earth to atone  for Adam's sin; that he rose again, ascended into heaven, and  sitteth on the right hand of the Father, and will come in the  clouds to judge the world, and so on.  All these propositions,  elaborated by men of the fourth century, had a certain meaning for  men of that time, but for men of to-day they have no meaning  whatever.  Men of the present day can repeat these words with  their lips, but believe them they cannot.  For such sentences as  that God lives in heaven, that the heavens opened and a voice from  somewhere said something, that Christ rose again, and ascended  somewhere in heaven, and again will come from somewhere on the  clouds, and so on, have no meaning for us.    A man who regarded the heavens as a solid, finite vault could  believe or disbelieve that God created the heavens, that the  heavens opened, that Christ ascended into heaven, but for us all  these phrases have no sense whatever.  Men of the present can only  believe, as indeed they do, that they ought to believe in this;  but believe it they cannot, because it has no meaning for them.    Even if all these phrases ought to be interpreted in a figurative  sense and are allegories, we know that in the first place all  Churchmen are not agreed about it, but, on the contrary, the  majority stick to understanding the Holy Scripture in its literal  sense; and secondly, that these allegorical interpretations are  very varied and are not supported by any evidence.    But even if a man wants to force himself to believe in the  doctrines of the Church just as they are taught to him, the  universal diffusion of education and of the Gospel and of  communication between people of different forms of religion  presents a still more insurmountable obstacle to his doing so.    A man of the present day need only buy a Gospel for three copecks and  read through the plain words, admitting of no misinterpretation, that  Christ said to the Samaritan woman \"that the Father seeketh not  worshipers at Jerusalem, nor in this mountain nor in that, but  worshipers in spirit and in truth,\" or the saying that \"the Christian  must not pray like the heathen, nor for show, but secretly, that is, in  his closet,\" or that Christ's follower must call no man master or  father--he need only read these words to be thoroughly convinced that  the Church pastors, who call themselves teachers in opposition to  Christ's precept, and dispute among themselves, constitute no kind of  authority, and that what the Churchmen teach us is not Christianity.  Less even than that is necessary. Even if a man nowadays did continue to  believe in miracles and did not read the Gospel, mere association with  people of different forms of religion and faith, which happens so easily  in these days, compels him to doubt of the truth of his own faith. It  was all very well when a man did not see men of any other form of  religion than his own; he believed that his form of religion was the one  true one. But a thinking man has only to come into contact--as  constantly happens in these days--with people, equally good and bad, of  different denominations, who condemn each other's beliefs, to doubt of  the truth of the belief he professes himself. In these days only a man  who is absolutely ignorant or absolutely indifferent to the vital  questions with which religion deals, can remain in the faith of the  Church.    What deceptions and what strenuous efforts the churches must  employ to continue, in spite of all these tendencies subversive of  the faith, to build churches, to perform masses, to preach, to  teach, to convert, and, most of all, to receive for it all immense  emoluments, as do all these priests, pastors, incumbents,  superintendents, abbots, archdeacons, bishops, and archbishops.  They need special supernatural efforts.  And the churches do, with  ever-increasing intensity and zeal, make such efforts.  With us in  Russia, besides other means, they employ, simple brute force, as  there the temporal power is willing to obey the Church.  Men who  refuse an external assent to the faith, and say so openly, are  either directly punished or deprived of their rights; men who  strictly keep the external forms of religion are rewarded and  given privileges.    That is how the Orthodox clergy proceed; but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46092"],[0,"A Little Pilgrimage in Italy (#17)"],[1,"is still a miracle to me that I should have met her on this  bare hillside.          CHIUSI      Night had fallen when we reached Chiusi Junction. A full-blown  harvest moon hung over the station-yard like a yellow lamp. It  was late, and the lights of Chiusi were a twinkling bunch of  fire-flies on a distant hill. We dined at the excellent station  buffet, resolved not to spoil the propitious hour by arriving in  an unknown city tired and hungry; and afterwards we climbed up to  our mysterious destination at leisure, in the glory of a late moon,  with the night insects singing by the dusky roadside.    They are among the little joys of Italy these late arrivals, on  breathless summer nights, at hill-towns whose features you have  only glimpsed heretofore from the windows of a flying train. A fig  for the discomforts that you risk! They add a touch of salt to  the adventure. The inn you stumble on may be the worst of all bad  inns; the dinner will of course be long-delayed; and if you have  inadvertently walked in upon a festa it may be difficult to find  a place whereon to lay your head. But reckon against these things  the charm of mystery--the complete sense of satisfaction with which  you watch the ruby tail-lights of your train slipping away into  the night, and hear the lessening roar of its engine till your  last link with the familiar world is severed, and you are face to  face with the unknown. And lastly, remember the joy with which you  discover a new world in the morning.    We started in a vettura which was never meant to carry passengers  as well as luggage, but before long we slipped out one by one, for  we were only going at a snail's pace up the long hill which leads  from Chiusi station to Chiusi town, and we could see nothing of  the magic of the night, half-buried in boxes, and with the stars  shut out by tarpaulin. The driver did not notice, but the horses  quickened their pace with the lightened burden, and soon we were  left to find our own way up the hillside. It was not difficult.  The bright moonlight, which flooded the plain below, turned the  road into a band of silver, whose whiteness was barred by the  shadows of giant cypresses towering black against the night. The  chanting of the frogs and the song of the night cricket almost  drowned the jangling bells of our vettura, and high above us we  could see Chiusi, no longer a bunch of fire-flies, but a ghostly  grey hill-city already wrapt in slumber, with a frowning rocca, and  grim old walls. Its silence was a little desolate as we drew near,  and it was a relief to see the hospitable yellow lights of the Leon  d'Oro outside the Porta Romana, giving us a homely welcome into the  mysterious moonlit town.    [Illustration: CITTA DELLA PIEVE FROM CHIUSI.]    I woke early in the morning. It needed but a glance to tell me that  I was back in Umbria. Nowhere else are the dimpled valleys so full  of beauty, or the blue hills so softly moulded; and nowhere else  is that pellucid sky, or that strange clarity of atmosphere which  inspired the landscapes of the Umbrian Quattrocento artists. It was  as though I looked straight into the heart of one of Perugino's  sacred pictures. There was the soft green valley melting in the  distance into the azure folds of mountains; there were the slender  trees cleaving the luminous air; there were the towered cities  crowning the hills; there was the clear pale sky, the spaciousness,  the holiness which Perugino and his school immortalised. But, after  all, this rich plain, from which the waters of an inland sea have  long ago receded, is peculiarly the land of Perugino. Is not that  rose-red city on the crest of the wooded hill which bounds the  southern horizon of Chiusi, Citta della Pieve, the town which gave  him birth? I half expected to see a band of saints walking in the  vineyards, or to find Madonna sitting by the roadside with the  Infant Christ. But another artist had usurped the landscape. Below  my window was a peasant ploughing in his olive-garden. He sang as  he bent forward to throw his weight on the wooden shaft, and his  clothes were as blue as the heavens at mid-day. Two milk-white oxen  moved slowly before him under the tender grey of the olives, and as  they passed they left behind them shining furrows of freshly-turned  earth. It was a poem of labour, as delicate in colour as a  tone-etching, an inspiration for Millet with the poetry of life in  his veins, or for the subtle Corot.    Chiusi, the Clusium of Lars Porsena, the great Etruscan Prince who  championed the Tarquinii after they were expelled from Rome, is a  little self-contained city with an affectation of placing cypresses  at becoming angles. She is rather a coquette this old town. She  is not unconscious of the picturesqueness of her position as she  rises above the shimmering olives which veil her hillsides; she  knows the value of cypress spires when they soar above the bastions  of ancient walls; she deliberately sets herself out to charm the  stranger by filling the gardens of her _trattorie_ with flowering  gourds and purple morning-glories. Her picturesque old cathedral  has been so cleverly redecorated throughout with painted mosaics,  that when we first stepped down into the cool dark nave we were  deceived, and gasped to see such jewels outside Ravenna; and she  has built herself a delightful museum, in the form of a classic  temple, to house her Etruscan treasures.    I think she has never ceased to congratulate herself upon giving  the lie to Dante's ill-omened prophecy, when he quoted her as an  example of a city falling into decay--        'Mark Luni, Urbisaglia mark,    How they are gone, and after them how go    Chiusi and Sinigaglia; and 't will seem    No longer new or strange to thee to hear,    That families fail when cities have their end.'[14]    She may well have seemed a city doomed to him as he rode in haste  through the pestilent marshes of the Val di Chiana, and saw her  desolate towers above him stark against the evening sky, as he  hurried from Rome to Siena to meet his fellow exiles and learn the  story of his fall.    For eight centuries or more Chiusi was a plague spot, and the  vapours of the maremma were more powerful to guard her from  invaders than the strongest walls. So she has fewer mediaeval  palaces, and fewer towers than other hill-cities, and these were  long ago given to neighbouring churches to hang their bells in,  and the ancient Rocca is a garden with a farm-house in its keep.    I have a tender spot in my heart for Chiusi. She is a happy town.  In herself she is not very picturesque: her houses are the plain,  white-washed, green-shuttered homes of modern Italy; there are  few traces of her ancient greatness to be seen except the scanty  Etruscan foundations of her mediaeval fortifications, a quantity of  _cippi_ and reliefs built into walls, and the labyrinth of ancient  sewers which honey-combs the hill.[15] And in comparison with the  other cities of Umbria she contains nothing of the Middle Ages,  certainly nothing Gothic, if we except the exquisite illuminated  missals and psalters by Bindo Fiorentino and Girolamo da Cremona,  which are kept in the sacristy of the cathedral, and which came  originally from the monastery of Monte Oliveto. To the antiquary  she is of the highest interest, for she marks the site of Clusium,  one of the five Etruscan towns which combined against the first of  the Tarquins, and of the earlier Camars, which may have been a city  of the more ancient Umbrians. Her history shows her to have been  one of the oldest and most powerful cities of the Etruscan League;  and the country for miles round her walls has yielded, and still  yields, a rich harvest of antiquities from scattered tombs. There  is a slope to the east of the city which is called 'The Field of  the Jewellers,' because so many _scarabaei_ have been discovered  there by the chance furrow of a plough.    [Illustration: ETRUSCAN CINERARY URNS.]    But I am no antiquary. It is not for me to discuss the possible  site of that improbable mausoleum of Lars Porsena with its  labyrinth and pyramids and windbells, which Varro described  as glibly as Herodotus did the marvels of the labyrinth of  Crocodilopolis. I have not seen the great necropolis of Poggio  Gajella on the hill to the north of Chiusi, which Dennis tells us  is a hive of tombs. To me the charm of Chiusi does not lie in her  antiquity, though like every one else who visits her I have spent  happy hours in her sunny museum, poring over inscriptions and  sarcophagi, and cinerary urns and household implements, and all the  strange paraphernalia of a vanished race which have been garnered  from the fields of Clusium. Nor are the painted tombs of Etruria  as much to me as the wonderful beauty of the olive-gardens through  which we walked to find them, in the golden sunset or the clear  cool dawn.    There are many tombs scattered round the hill of Chiusi. Some of  them empty caves hollowed out of the rock, half full of water,  abandoned to moths and bats; and others which have been opened  and closed up again because the damp and thieves have robbed them  of all interest. A few of the best are kept under lock and key to  preserve them from wanton destruction, but even these are slipping  reluctantly back to oblivion.    Such an one is the Tombe del Colle Casuccini, which is to be found  in an olive-grove to the south-east of the town. It is hollowed in  the rock, and is approached by a levelled path cut in the slope  of the hill. The earth around is full of iris plumes and slender  field flowers; there is a weather-beaten cippus over the lintel,  and a solitary stone-pine which stretches out its branches as  though Nature sought to render homage to the dead by yielding them  a royal canopy. We had lingered so long in the silver olive-gardens  that it was almost the hour of sunset when we reached the tomb. A  melancholy evening "]]]
