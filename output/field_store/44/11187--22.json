This wouldst thou hear; how long since God  Plac'd me high garden, from whose hounds  She led me up in this ladder, steep and long;  What space endur'd my season of delight;  Whence truly sprang the wrath that banish'd me;  And what the language, which I spake and fram'd  Not that I tasted of the tree, my son,  Was in itself the cause of that exile,  But only my transgressing of the mark  Assign'd me.  There, whence at thy lady's hest  The Mantuan mov'd him, still was I debarr'd  This council, till the sun had made complete,  Four thousand and three hundred rounds and twice,  His annual journey; and, through every light  In his broad pathway, saw I him return,  Thousand save sev'nty times, the whilst I dwelt  Upon the earth.  The language I did use  Was worn away, or ever Nimrod's race  Their unaccomplishable work began.  For naught, that man inclines to, ere was lasting,  Left by his reason free, and variable,  As is the sky that sways him.  That he speaks,  Is nature's prompting: whether thus or thus,  She leaves to you, as ye do most affect it.  Ere I descended into hell's abyss,  El was the name on earth of the Chief Good,  Whose joy enfolds me: Eli then 't was call'd  And so beseemeth: for, in mortals, use  Is as the leaf upon the bough; that goes,  And other comes instead.  Upon the mount  Most high above the waters, all my life,  Both innocent and guilty, did but reach  From the first hour, to that which cometh next  (As the sun changes quarter), to the sixth.\"          CANTO XXVII    Then  \"Glory to the Father, to the Son,  And to the Holy Spirit,\" rang aloud  Throughout all Paradise, that with the song  My spirit reel'd, so passing sweet the strain:  And what I saw was equal ecstasy;  One universal smile it seem'd of all things,  Joy past compare, gladness unutterable,  Imperishable life of peace and love,  Exhaustless riches and unmeasur'd bliss.    Before mine eyes stood the four torches lit;  And that, which first had come, began to wax  In brightness, and in semblance such became,  As Jove might be, if he and Mars were birds,  And interchang'd their plumes.  Silence ensued,  Through the blest quire, by Him, who here appoints  Vicissitude of ministry, enjoin'd;  When thus I heard: \"Wonder not, if my hue  Be chang'd; for, while I speak, these shalt thou see  All in like manner change with me.  My place  He who usurps on earth (my place, ay, mine,  Which in the presence of the Son of God  Is void), the same hath made my cemetery  A common sewer of puddle and of blood:  The more below his triumph, who from hence  Malignant fell.\"  Such colour, as the sun,  At eve or morning, paints an adverse cloud,  Then saw I sprinkled over all the sky.  And as th' unblemish'd dame, who in herself  Secure of censure, yet at bare report  Of other's failing, shrinks with maiden fear;  So Beatrice in her semblance chang'd:  And such eclipse in heav'n methinks was seen,  When the Most Holy suffer'd.  Then the words  Proceeded, with voice, alter'd from itself  So clean, the semblance did not alter more.  \"Not to this end was Christ's spouse with my blood,  With that of Linus, and of Cletus fed:  That she might serve for purchase of base gold:  But for the purchase of this happy life  Did Sextus, Pius, and Callixtus bleed,  And Urban, they, whose doom was not without  Much weeping seal'd.  No purpose was of our  That on the right hand of our successors  Part of the Christian people should be set,  And part upon their left; nor that the keys,  Which were vouchsaf'd me, should for ensign serve  Unto the banners, that do levy war  On the baptiz'd: nor I, for sigil-mark  Set upon sold and lying privileges;  Which makes me oft to bicker and turn red.  In shepherd's clothing greedy wolves below  Range wide o'er all the pastures.  Arm of God!  Why longer sleepst thou?  Caorsines and Gascona  Prepare to quaff our blood.  O good beginning  To what a vile conclusion must thou stoop!  But the high providence, which did defend  Through Scipio the world's glory unto Rome,  Will not delay its succour: and thou, son,  Who through thy mortal weight shall yet again  Return below, open thy lips, nor hide  What is by me not hidden.\"  As a Hood  Of frozen vapours streams adown the air,  What time the she-goat with her skiey horn  Touches the sun; so saw I there stream wide  The vapours, who with us had linger'd late  And with glad triumph deck th' ethereal cope.  Onward my sight their semblances pursued;  So far pursued, as till the space between  From its reach sever'd them: whereat the guide  Celestial, marking me no more intent  On upward gazing, said, \"Look down and see  What circuit thou hast compass'd.\"  From the hour  When I before had cast my view beneath,  All the first region overpast I saw,  Which from the midmost to the bound'ry winds;  That onward thence from Gades I beheld  The unwise passage of Laertes' son,  And hitherward the shore, where thou, Europa!  Mad'st thee a joyful burden: and yet more  Of this dim spot had seen, but that the sun,  A constellation off and more, had ta'en  His progress in the zodiac underneath.    Then by the spirit, that doth never leave  Its amorous dalliance with my lady's looks,  Back with redoubled ardour were mine eyes  Led unto her: and from her radiant smiles,  Whenas I turn'd me, pleasure so divine  Did lighten on me, that whatever bait  Or art or nature in the human flesh,  Or in its limn'd resemblance, can combine  Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal,  Were to her beauty nothing.  Its boon influence  From the fair nest of Leda rapt me forth,  And wafted on into the swiftest heav'n.    What place for entrance Beatrice chose,  I may not say, so uniform was all,  Liveliest and loftiest.  She my secret wish  Divin'd; and with such gladness, that God's love  Seem'd from her visage shining, thus began:  \"Here is the goal, whence motion on his race  Starts; motionless the centre, and the rest  All mov'd around.  Except the soul divine,  Place in this heav'n is none, the soul divine,  Wherein the love, which ruleth o'er its orb,  Is kindled, and the virtue that it sheds;  One circle, light and love, enclasping it,  As this doth clasp the others; and to Him,  Who draws the bound, its limit only known.  Measur'd itself by none, it doth divide  Motion to all, counted unto them forth,  As by the fifth or half ye count forth ten.  The vase, wherein time's roots are plung'd, thou seest,  Look elsewhere for the leaves.  O mortal lust!  That canst not lift thy head above the waves  Which whelm and sink thee down!  The will in man  Bears goodly blossoms; but its ruddy promise  Is, by the dripping of perpetual rain,  Made mere abortion: faith and innocence  Are met with but in babes, each taking leave  Ere cheeks with down are sprinkled; he, that fasts,  While yet a stammerer, with his tongue let loose  Gluts every food alike in every moon.  One yet a babbler, loves and listens to  His mother; but no sooner hath free use  Of speech, than he doth wish her in her grave.  So suddenly doth the fair child of him,  Whose welcome is the morn and eve his parting,  To negro blackness change her virgin white.    \"Thou, to abate thy wonder, note that none  Bears rule in earth, and its frail family  Are therefore wand'rers.  Yet before the date,  When through the hundredth in his reck'ning drops  Pale January must be shor'd aside  From winter's calendar, these heav'nly spheres  Shall roar so loud, that fortune shall be fain  To turn the poop, where she hath now the prow;  So that the fleet run onward; and true fruit,  Expected long, shall crown at last the bloom!\"          CANTO XXVII    So she who doth imparadise my soul,  Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life,  And bar'd the truth of poor mortality;  When lo! as one who, in a mirror, spies  The shining of a flambeau at his back,  Lit sudden ore he deem of its approach,  And turneth to resolve him, if the glass  Have told him true, and sees the record faithful  As note is to its metre; even thus,  I well remember, did befall to me,  Looking upon the beauteous eyes, whence love  Had made the leash to take me.  As I turn'd;  And that, which, in their circles, none who spies,  Can miss of, in itself apparent, struck  On mine; a point I saw, that darted light  So sharp, no lid, unclosing, may bear up  Against its keenness.  The least star we view  From hence, had seem'd a moon, set by its side,  As star by side of star.  And so far off,  Perchance, as is the halo from the light  Which paints it, when most dense the vapour spreads,  There wheel'd about the point a circle of fire,  More rapid than the motion, which first girds  The world.  Then, circle after circle, round  Enring'd each other; till the seventh reach'd  Circumference so ample, that its bow,  Within the span of Juno's messenger,  lied scarce been held entire. Beyond the sev'nth,  Follow'd yet other two.  And every one,  As more in number distant from the first,  Was tardier in motion; and that glow'd  With flame most pure, that to the sparkle' of truth  Was nearest, as partaking most, methinks,  Of its reality.  The guide belov'd  Saw me in anxious thought suspense, and spake:  \"Heav'n, and all nature, hangs upon that point.  The circle thereto most conjoin'd observe;  And know, that by intenser love its course  Is to this swiftness wing'd.\"  To whom I thus:  \"It were enough; nor should I further seek,  Had I but witness'd order, in the world  Appointed, such as in these wheels is seen.  But in the sensible world such diff'rence is,  That is each round shows more divinity,  As each is wider from the centre.  Hence,  If in this wondrous and angelic temple,  That hath for confine only light and love,  My wish may have completion I must know,  Wherefore such disagreement is between  Th' exemplar and its copy: for myself,  Contemplating, I fail to pierce the cause.\"    \"It is no marvel, if thy fingers foil'd  Do leave the knot untied: so hard 't is grown "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/884"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 3 (#17)"],[1,"much charcoal, I should  strengthen the suspicion already existing, that I was a coiner of base  money. Another advised me to purchase some place in the magistracy, as  I was already a Doctor of Laws. My relations spoke in terms still more  annoying to me, and even threatened that, if I continued to make such  a fool of myself, they would send a posse of police-officers into my  house, and break all my furnaces and crucibles into atoms. I was wearied  almost to death by this continued persecution; but I found comfort in  my work and in the progress of my experiment, to which I was very  attentive, and which went on bravely from day to day. About this time,  there was a dreadful plague in Paris, which interrupted all intercourse  between man and man, and left me as much to myself as I could desire. I  soon had the satisfaction to remark the progress and succession of the  three colours which, according to the philosophers, always prognosticate  the approaching perfection of the work. I observed them distinctly, one  after the other; and next year, being Easter Sunday, 1550, I made the  great trial. Some common quicksilver, which I put into a small crucible  on the fire, was, in less than an hour, converted into very good gold.  You may judge how great was my joy, but I took care not to boast of it.  I returned thanks to God for the favour he had shown me, and prayed that  I might only be permitted to make such use of it as would redound to his  glory.    \"On the following day, I went towards Toulouse to find the Abbe,  in accordance with a mutual promise that we should communicate our  discoveries to each other. On my way, I called in to see the sage monk  who had assisted me with his counsels; but I had the sorrow to learn  that they were both dead. After this, I would not return to my own home,  but retired to another place, to await one of my relations whom I had  left in charge of my estate. I gave him orders to sell all that belonged  to me, as well movable as immovable--to pay my debts with the proceeds,  and divide all the rest among those in any way related to me who might  stand in need of it, in order that they might enjoy some share of the  good fortune which had befallen me. There was a great deal of talk  in the neighbourhood about my precipitate retreat; the wisest of my  acquaintance imagining that, broken down and ruined by my mad expenses,  I sold my little remaining property that I might go and hide my shame in  distant countries.    \"My relative already spoken of rejoined me on the 1st of July, after  having performed all the business I had intrusted him with. We took  our departure together, to seek a land of liberty. We first retired to  Lausanne, in Switzerland, when, after remaining there for some time,  we resolved to pass the remainder of our days in some of the most  celebrated cities of Germany, living quietly and without splendour.\"    Thus ends the story of Denis Zachaire, as written by himself. He has not  been so candid at its conclusion as at its commencement, and has left  the world in doubt as to his real motives for pretending that he had  discovered the philosopher's stone. It seems probable that the sentence  he puts into the months of his wisest acquaintances was the true reason  of his retreat; that he was, in fact, reduced to poverty, and hid his  shame in foreign countries. Nothing further is known of his life, and  his real name has never yet been discovered. He wrote a work on alchymy,  entitled \"The true Natural Philosophy of Metals.\"    DR. DEE and EDWARD KELLY.    John Dee and Edward Kelly claim to be mentioned together, having been  so long associated in the same pursuits, and undergone so many strange  vicissitudes in each other's society. Dee was altogether a wonderful  man, and had he lived in an age when folly and superstition were less  rife, he would, with the same powers which he enjoyed, have left behind  him a bright and enduring reputation. He was born in London, in the year  1527, and very early manifested a love for study. At the age of fifteen  he was sent to Cambridge, and delighted so much in his books, that he  passed regularly eighteen hours every day among them. Of the other  six, he devoted four to sleep and two for refreshment. Such intense  application did not injure his health, and could not fail to make  him one of the first scholars of his time. Unfortunately, however, he  quitted the mathematics and the pursuits of true philosophy to indulge  in the unprofitable reveries of the occult sciences. He studied alchymy,  astrology, and magic, and thereby rendered himself obnoxious to the  authorities at Cambridge. To avoid persecution, he was at last obliged  to retire to the university of Louvain; the rumours of sorcery that  were current respecting him rendering his longer stay in England not  altogether without danger. He found at Louvain many kindred spirits who  had known Cornelius Agrippa while he resided among them, and by whom he  was constantly entertained with the wondrous deeds of that great master  of the hermetic mysteries. From their conversation he received much  encouragement to continue the search for the philosopher's stone, which  soon began to occupy nearly all his thoughts.    He did not long remain on the Continent, but returned to England in  1551, being at that time in the twenty-fourth year of his age. By the  influence of his friend, Sir John Cheek, he was kindly received at the  court of King Edward VI, and rewarded (it is difficult to say for what)  with a pension of one hundred crowns. He continued for several years  to practise in London as an astrologer; casting nativities, telling  fortunes, and pointing out lucky and unlucky days. During the reign of  Queen Mary he got into trouble, being suspected of heresy, and charged  with attempting Mary's life by means of enchantments. He was tried for  the latter offence, and acquitted; but was retained in prison on the  former charge, and left to the tender mercies of Bishop Bonner. He had  a very narrow escape from being burned in Smithfield, but he, somehow  or other, contrived to persuade that fierce bigot that his orthodoxy was  unimpeachable, and was set at liberty in 1555.    On the accession of Elizabeth, a brighter day dawned upon him. During  her retirement at Woodstock, her servants appear to have consulted him  as to the time of Mary's death, which Circumstance, no doubt, first gave  rise to the serious charge for which he was brought to trial. They now  came to consult him more openly as to the fortunes of their mistress;  and Robert Dudley, the celebrated Earl of Leicester, was sent by command  of the Queen herself to know the most auspicious day for her coronation.  So great was the favour he enjoyed that, some years afterwards,  Elizabeth condescended to pay him a visit at his house in Mortlake,  to view his museum of curiosities, and, when he was ill, sent her own  physician to attend upon him.    Astrology was the means whereby he lived, and he continued to practise  it with great assiduity; but his heart was in alchymy. The philosopher's  stone and the elixir of life haunted his daily thoughts and his nightly  dreams. The Talmudic mysteries, which he had also deeply studied,  impressed him with the belief, that he might hold converse with spirits  and angels, and learn from them all the mysteries of the universe.  Holding the same idea as the then obscure sect of the Rosicrucians,  some of whom he had perhaps encountered in his travels in Germany, he  imagined that, by means of the philosopher's stone, he could summon  these kindly spirits at his will. By dint of continually brooding  upon the subject, his imagination became so diseased, that he at last  persuaded himself that an angel appeared to him, and promised to be his  friend and companion as long as he lived. He relates that, one day, in  November 1582, while he was engaged in fervent prayer, the window of his  museum looking towards the west suddenly glowed with a dazzling light,  in the midst of which, in all his glory, stood the great angel Uriel.  Awe and wonder rendered him speechless; but the angel smiling graciously  upon him, gave him a crystal, of a convex form, and told him that,  whenever he wished to hold converse with the beings of another sphere,  he had only to gaze intently upon it, and they would appear in the  crystal and unveil to him all the secrets of futurity. [The \"crystal\"  alluded to appears to have been a black stone, or piece of polished  coal. The following account of it is given in the Supplement to  Granger's \"Biographical History.\"--\"The black stone into which Dee used  to call his spirits was in the collection of the Earls of Peterborough,  from whence it came to Lady Elizabeth Germaine. It was next the property  of the late Duke of Argyle, and is now Mr. Walpole's. It appears upon  examination to be nothing more than a polished piece of cannel coal; but  this is what Butler means when he says, 'Kelly did all his feats  upon The devil's looking-glass--a stone.'\"] This saying, the angel  disappeared. Dee found from experience of the crystal that it was  necessary that all the faculties of the soul should be concentrated upon  it, otherwise the spirits did not appear. He also found that he could  never recollect the conversations he had with the angels. He therefore  determined to communicate the secret to another person, who might  converse with the spirits while he (Dee) sat in another part of the  room, and took down in writing the revelations which they made.    He had at this time in his service, as his assistant, one Edward Kelly,  who, like himself, was crazy upon the subject of the philosopher's  stone. There was this difference, however, between them, that, while  Dee was more of an enthusiast than an impostor, Kelly was more of an  impostor than an enthusiast. In early life he was a notary, and had the  misfortune to lose both his ears for forgery. This"]]]
