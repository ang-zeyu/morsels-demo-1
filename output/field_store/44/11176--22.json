The night passed with Tarzan still fast bound to the stake, and shortly  after dawn his fears were realized in the discovery of naked black  figures moving stealthily just within the edge of the jungle about the  village.  The blacks were returning.    With daylight their courage would be equal to the demands of a charge  upon the handful of beasts that had routed them from their rightful  abodes.  The result of the encounter seemed foregone if the savages  could curb their superstitious terror, for against their overwhelming  numbers, their long spears and poisoned arrows, the panther and the  apes could not be expected to survive a really determined attack.    That the blacks were preparing for a charge became apparent a few  moments later, when they commenced to show themselves in force upon the  edge of the clearing, dancing and jumping about as they waved their  spears and shouted taunts and fierce warcries toward the village.    These manoeuvres Tarzan knew would continue until the blacks had worked  themselves into a state of hysterical courage sufficient to sustain  them for a short charge toward the village, and even though he doubted  that they would reach it at the first attempt, he believed that at the  second or the third they would swarm through the gateway, when the  outcome could not be aught than the extermination of Tarzan's bold, but  unarmed and undisciplined, defenders.    Even as he had guessed, the first charge carried the howling warriors  but a short distance into the open--a shrill, weird challenge from the  ape-man being all that was necessary to send them scurrying back to the  bush.  For half an hour they pranced and yelled their courage to the  sticking-point, and again essayed a charge.    This time they came quite to the village gate, but when Sheeta and the  hideous apes leaped among them they turned screaming in terror, and  again fled to the jungle.    Again was the dancing and shouting repeated.  This time Tarzan felt no  doubt they would enter the village and complete the work that a handful  of determined white men would have carried to a successful conclusion  at the first attempt.    To have rescue come so close only to be thwarted because he could not  make his poor, savage friends understand precisely what he wanted of  them was most irritating, but he could not find it in his heart to  place blame upon them.   They had done their best, and now he was sure  they would doubtless remain to die with him in a fruitless effort to  defend him.    The blacks were already preparing for the charge.  A few individuals  had advanced a short distance toward the village and were exhorting the  others to follow them.  In a moment the whole savage horde would be  racing across the clearing.    Tarzan thought only of the little child somewhere in this cruel,  relentless wilderness.  His heart ached for the son that he might no  longer seek to save--that and the realization of Jane's suffering were  all that weighed upon his brave spirit in these that he thought his  last moments of life.  Succour, all that he could hope for, had come to  him in the instant of his extremity--and failed.  There was nothing  further for which to hope.    The blacks were half-way across the clearing when Tarzan's attention  was attracted by the actions of one of the apes.  The beast was glaring  toward one of the huts.  Tarzan followed his gaze.  To his infinite  relief and delight he saw the stalwart form of Mugambi racing toward  him.    The huge black was panting heavily as though from strenuous physical  exertion and nervous excitement.  He rushed to Tarzan's side, and as  the first of the savages reached the village gate the native's knife  severed the last of the cords that bound Tarzan to the stake.    In the street lay the corpses of the savages that had fallen before the  pack the night before.  From one of these Tarzan seized a spear and  knob stick, and with Mugambi at his side and the snarling pack about  him, he met the natives as they poured through the gate.    Fierce and terrible was the battle that ensued, but at last the savages  were routed, more by terror, perhaps, at sight of a black man and a  white fighting in company with a panther and the huge fierce apes of  Akut, than because of their inability to overcome the relatively small  force that opposed them.    One prisoner fell into the hands of Tarzan, and him the ape-man  questioned in an effort to learn what had become of Rokoff and his  party.  Promised his liberty in return for the information, the black  told all he knew concerning the movements of the Russian.    It seemed that early in the morning their chief had attempted to  prevail upon the whites to return with him to the village and with  their guns destroy the ferocious pack that had taken possession of it,  but Rokoff appeared to entertain even more fears of the giant white man  and his strange companions than even the blacks themselves.    Upon no conditions would he consent to returning even within sight of  the village.  Instead, he took his party hurriedly to the river, where  they stole a number of canoes the blacks had hidden there.  The last  that had been seen of them they had been paddling strongly up-stream,  their porters from Kaviri's village wielding the blades.    So once more Tarzan of the Apes with his hideous pack took up his  search for the ape-man's son and the pursuit of his abductor.    For weary days they followed through an almost uninhabited country,  only to learn at last that they were upon the wrong trail.  The little  band had been reduced by three, for three of Akut's apes had fallen in  the fighting at the village.   Now, with Akut, there were five great  apes, and Sheeta was there--and Mugambi and Tarzan.    The ape-man no longer heard rumors even of the three who had preceded  Rokoff--the white man and woman and the child.  Who the man and woman  were he could not guess, but that the child was his was enough to keep  him hot upon the trail.  He was sure that Rokoff would be following  this trio, and so he felt confident that so long as he could keep upon  the Russian's trail he would be winning so much nearer to the time he  might snatch his son from the dangers and horrors that menaced him.    In retracing their way after losing Rokoff's trail Tarzan picked it up  again at a point where the Russian had left the river and taken to the  brush in a northerly direction.  He could only account for this change  on the ground that the child had been carried away from the river by  the two who now had possession of it.    Nowhere along the way, however, could he gain definite information that  might assure him positively that the child was ahead of him.  Not a  single native they questioned had seen or heard of this other party,  though nearly all had had direct experience with the Russian or had  talked with others who had.    It was with difficulty that Tarzan could find means to communicate with  the natives, as the moment their eyes fell upon his companions they  fled precipitately into the bush.  His only alternative was to go ahead  of his pack and waylay an occasional warrior whom he found alone in the  jungle.    One day as he was thus engaged, tracking an unsuspecting savage, he  came upon the fellow in the act of hurling a spear at a wounded white  man who crouched in a clump of bush at the trail's side.  The white was  one whom Tarzan had often seen, and whom he recognized at once.    Deep in his memory was implanted those repulsive features--the  close-set eyes, the shifty expression, the drooping yellow moustache.    Instantly it occurred to the ape-man that this fellow had not been  among those who had accompanied Rokoff at the village where Tarzan had  been a prisoner.  He had seen them all, and this fellow had not been  there.  There could be but one explanation--he it was who had fled  ahead of the Russian with the woman and the child--and the woman had  been Jane Clayton.   He was sure now of the meaning of Rokoff's words.    The ape-man's face went white as he looked upon the pasty, vice-marked  countenance of the Swede.  Across Tarzan's forehead stood out the broad  band of scarlet that marked the scar where, years before, Terkoz had  torn a great strip of the ape-man's scalp from his skull in the fierce  battle in which Tarzan had sustained his fitness to the kingship of the  apes of Kerchak.    The man was his prey--the black should not have him, and with the  thought he leaped upon the warrior, striking down the spear before it  could reach its mark.  The black, whipping out his knife, turned to do  battle with this new enemy, while the Swede, lying in the bush,  witnessed a duel, the like of which he had never dreamed to see--a  half-naked white man battling with a half-naked black, hand to hand  with the crude weapons of primeval man at first, and then with hands  and teeth like the primordial brutes from whose loins their forebears  sprung.    For a time Anderssen did not recognize the white, and when at last it  dawned upon him that he had seen this giant before, his eyes went wide  in surprise that this growling, rending beast could ever have been the  well-groomed English gentleman who had been a prisoner aboard the  Kincaid.    An English nobleman!  He had learned the identity of the Kincaid's  prisoners from Lady Greystoke during their flight up the Ugambi.  Before, in common with the other members of the crew of the steamer, he  had not known who the two might be.    The fight was over.  Tarzan had been compelled to kill his antagonist,  as the fellow would not surrender.    The Swede saw the white man leap to his feet beside the corpse of his  foe, and placing one foot upon the broken neck lift his voice in the  hideous challenge of the victorious bull-ape."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8502"],[0,"Common Diseases of Farm Animals (#17)"],[1,", in that the latter possesses the nerve  endings of the olfactory nerve and is the seat of smell. The five pairs of  head sinuses communicate with the nasal cavities. Posteriorly and near the  superior extremity of the nasal passages, are two large openings, the  guttural, that open into the pharyngeal cavity.    _The pharynx_ is a somewhat funnel-shaped cavity. The walls are thin and  formed by muscles and mucous membrane. This is the cross-road between the  digestive and respiratory passages. In the posterior portion of the cavity  there are two openings. The inferior opening leads to the larynx and the  superior one to the oesophagus. All feed on its way to the stomach must  pass over the opening into the larynx. It is impossible, however, for the  feed to enter this opening, unless accidentally when the animal coughs. The  cartilage closing this opening is pressed shut by the base of the tongue  when the bolus of feed is passed back and into the oesophageal opening.    _The larynx_ may be compared to a box open at both ends. The several  cartilages that form it are united by ligaments. It is lined by a mucous  membrane. The posterior extremity is united to the first cartilaginous ring  of the trachea. The anterior opening is closed by the epiglottis. Just  within is a V-shaped opening that is limited laterally by the folds of the  laryngeal mucous membrane, the vocal chords.    _The trachea_ is a cylindrical tube originating at the posterior extremity  of the larynx, and terminating within the chest cavity at a point just  above the heart in the right and left bronchial tubes. It is formed by a  series of cartilaginous rings joined together at their borders by ligaments  and lined by a mucous membrane.    _The bronchial tubes_ resemble the trachea in structure. They enter the  lungs a short distance from their origin, where they subdivide into  branches and sub-branches, gradually decreasing in calibre and losing the  cartilaginous rings, ligaments and muscular layer until only the thin  mucous membrane is left. They become capillary in diameter, and finally  open into the infundibula of the air cells of the lungs.    _The lungs_ take up all of the space in the thoracic cavity not occupied by  the heart, blood-vessels and oesophagus. This cavity resembles a cone in  shape that is cut obliquely downwards and forward at its base. The base is  formed by the diaphragm which is pushed forward at its middle. It is lined  by the pleura, a serous membrane, that is inflected from the wall over the  different organs within the cavity. The median folds of the pleura divide  the cavity into right and left portions. A second method of describing the  arrangement of the pleura is to state that it forms two sacks, right and  left, that enclose the lungs. The lungs are the essential organs of  respiration. The tissue that forms them is light, will float in water, is  elastic and somewhat rose-colored. Each lung is divided into lobes, and  each lobe into a great number of lobules by the supporting connective  tissue. The lobule is the smallest division of the lung and is formed by  capillary bronchial tubes, air cells and blood-vessels. It is here that the  external respiration or the exchange of gases between the capillaries and  the air cells occurs.    VENTILATION.--It is agreed by all persons who have investigated the  subject, that unventilated stable air is injurious to animals. At one time  it was believed that the injurious effects resulting from the breathing of  air charged with gases and moisture from the expired air and the animal's  surroundings, were due to a deficiency in oxygen. It is now believed that  the ill-effects are mainly due to the stagnation of air, the humid  atmosphere, and the irritating gases emanating from the body excretions.    The common impurities found in _stable air_ are carbonic and ammonia gas,  moisture charged with injurious matter and dust from the floor and bodies  of the animals. As a rule, the more crowded and filthy the stable, the more  impurities there are in the air. If any of the animals are affected with an  infectious disease, such as tuberculosis or glanders, the moisture and dust  may act as carriers of the disease-producing germs. Infectious diseases  spread rapidly in crowded, poorly ventilated stables. The two factors  responsible for this rapid spread of disease are the lowered vitality of  the animal, due to breathing the vitiated air, and the greater opportunity  for infection, because of the comparatively large number of bacteria  present in the air.    _The purpose of stable ventilation_ is to replace the stable air with purer  air. The frequency with which the air in the stable should be changed  depends on the cubic feet of air space provided for each animal, and the  sanitary conditions present. The principal factor in stable ventilation is  the force of the wind. In cold weather it is very difficult to properly  ventilate a crowded stable without too much loss of animal heat and  creating draughts.    For practical purposes, the _need of ventilation_ in a stable can be  determined by the odor of the air, the amount of moisture present and the  temperature. It is impossible to keep the air within the stable as pure as  the atmosphere outside.    All dangers from injury by breathing impure air, or by draughts can be  eliminated by proper stable construction, attention to the ventilation and  keeping the quarters clean.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--A case of catarrhal cold.]    CATARRH (COLD IN THE HEAD).--Catarrh is an inflammation of the mucous  membrane lining the nasal cavities that usually extends to the membrane  lining of the sinuses of the head. It may be acute or chronic. The  inflammation very often extends to the pharynx and larynx. Cold in the head  is more common in the horse than in any of the other animals (Fig. 22).    _The most common causes_ of \"colds\" are standing or lying in a draught,  becoming wet, and exposure to the cold. \"Colds\" are common during cold,  changeable weather. Horses that are accustomed to warm stables, are very  apt to take \"cold\" if changed to a cold stable and not protected with a  blanket. Most animals are not affected by the cold weather if given dry  quarters and a dry bed. Irritation to the mucous membrane by dust, gases  and germs is a common cause. Influenza and colt distemper are characterized  by an inflammation of the respiratory mucous membranes. In the horse,  chronic catarrh is commonly caused by diseased teeth, and injuries to the  wall of the maxillary sinus. In sheep, the larvae of the bot-fly may cause  catarrh.    _The early symptoms_ usually pass unnoticed by the attendant. The lining  membrane of the nostrils is at first dry and red. During this stage  sneezing is common. In a few days a discharge appears. This is watery at  first, but may become catarrhal, heavy, mucous-like and turbid. In severe  cases it resembles pus. The lining membrane of the eyelids appears red and  tears may flow from the eye. Sometimes the animal acts dull and feverish,  but this symptom does not last longer than one or two days unless  complicated by sore throat.    _Inflammation of the throat_ is a common complication of \"colds.\" It is  characterized by difficulty in swallowing and partial, or complete loss of  appetite. Drinking or exercising causes the animal to cough. If the larynx  as well as the pharynx is inflamed, distressed and noisy breathing may  occur. Pressure over the region of the throat causes the animal pain.    Common \"cold\" terminates favorably within a week. Chronic catarrh may  persist until the cause is removed and the necessary local treatment  applied. Inflammation of the pharynx and larynx may persist for several  weeks unless properly treated. Abscesses may form in the region of the  throat. Horses frequently become thick winded as a result of severe attacks  of sore throat.    _The treatment_ is both preventive and curative. \"Colds\" and sore throat  can be largely prevented by good care, exercise and properly ventilated  stables. Mild cases require a light diet, comfortable quarters and a dry  bed. Allowing the animal to inhale steam three or four times daily is  useful in relieving the inflammation. Easily digested feeds, and in case  the animal has difficulty in swallowing, soft feeds and gruels, should be  given. The throat may be kept covered with a layer of antiphlogistin and  bandaged. Glycoheroin may be given in from teaspoonful to tablespoonful  doses, depending on the size of the animal. Chlorate of potassium may be  given in the drinking water.    If the animal becomes run down in flesh, as sometimes occurs in chronic  catarrh, bitter tonics should be given. In the latter disease, it is  sometimes necessary to trephine and wash out the sinus or sinuses affected  with an antiseptic solution. It may be necessary to continue this treatment  for several weeks.    BRONCHITIS.--Inflammation of the bronchial tubes may be either acute or  chronic. Acute bronchitis is especially common in the horse, while the  chronic form is more often met with in the smaller animals, especially  hogs. This disease is most common among horses during the changeable  seasons of the years. It is _caused_ by warm, close stables or stalls, and  irritating gases emanating from the floor, or manure in the stall. In  general, the causes are about the same as in cold in the head. In young  animals and hogs, the inhalation of dust, and bronchial and lung worms  commonly cause it. Verminous bronchitis usually becomes chronic.    _In the acute form_ of the disease the _symptoms_ come on very quickly, the  fever is high and the pulse beats and respirations are rapid. Chilling of  the body occurs, and the animal may appear dull and refuse to eat. The  animal coughs frequently. Recovery occurs within a few days, unless  complicated by sore throat and pneumonia. In the horse, bronchitis is not a  serious disease, but in other"]]]
