'Yes, right close to here, jist down the creek where the track to Wall's  branches off. Tommy found him while he was out after the cows. Hangin'  to the branch of a tree with the two saddle-straps.'    Mary stared at her, speechless.    'Tommy came home yellin' with fright. I sent him over to Wall's at once.  After breakfast, the minute my eyes was off them, the children slipped  away and went down there. They came back screamin' at the tops of their  voices. I did give it to them. I reckon they won't want ter see a dead  body again in a hurry. Every time I'd mention it they'd huddle together,  or ketch hold of me skirts and howl.    '\"Yer'll go agen when I tell yer not to,\" I'd say.    '\"Oh no, mother,\" they'd howl.    '\"Yer wanted ter see a man hangin',\" I said.    '\"Oh, don't, mother! Don't talk about it.\"    '\"Yer wouldn't be satisfied till yer see it,\" I'd say; \"yer had to see  it or burst. Yer satisfied now, ain't yer?\"    '\"Oh, don't, mother!\"    '\"Yer run all the way there, I s'pose?\"    '\"Don't, mother!\"    '\"But yer run faster back, didn't yer?\"    '\"Oh, don't, mother.\"    'But,' said Mrs Spicer, in conclusion, 'I'd been down to see it myself  before they was up.'    'And ain't you afraid to live alone here, after all these horrible  things?' asked Mary.    'Well, no; I don't mind. I seem to have got past carin' for anythink  now. I felt it a little when Tommy went away--the first time I felt  anythink for years. But I'm over that now.'    'Haven't you got any friends in the district, Mrs Spicer?'    'Oh yes. There's me married sister near Cobborah, and a married brother  near Dubbo; he's got a station. They wanted to take me an' the children  between them, or take some of the younger children. But I couldn't bring  my mind to break up the home. I want to keep the children together as  much as possible. There's enough of them gone, God knows. But it's a  comfort to know that there's some one to see to them if anythink happens  to me.'         *****    One day--I was on my way home with the team that day--Annie Spicer came  running up the creek in terrible trouble.    'Oh, Mrs Wilson! something terribl's happened at home! A trooper'  (mounted policeman--they called them 'mounted troopers' out there), 'a  trooper's come and took Billy!' Billy was the eldest son at home.    'What?'    'It's true, Mrs Wilson.'    'What for? What did the policeman say?'    'He--he--he said, \"I--I'm very sorry, Mrs Spicer; but--I--I want  William.\"'    It turned out that William was wanted on account of a horse missed from  Wall's station and sold down-country.    'An' mother took on awful,' sobbed Annie; 'an' now she'll only sit  stock-still an' stare in front of her, and won't take no notice of any  of us. Oh! it's awful, Mrs Wilson. The policeman said he'd tell Aunt  Emma' (Mrs Spicer's sister at Cobborah), 'and send her out. But I had to  come to you, an' I've run all the way.'    James put the horse to the cart and drove Mary down.    Mary told me all about it when I came home.    'I found her just as Annie said; but she broke down and cried in my  arms. Oh, Joe! it was awful! She didn't cry like a woman. I heard a man  at Haviland cry at his brother's funeral, and it was just like that. She  came round a bit after a while. Her sister's with her now.... Oh, Joe!  you must take me away from the Bush.'    Later on Mary said--    'How the oaks are sighing to-night, Joe!'         *****    Next morning I rode across to Wall's station and tackled the old man;  but he was a hard man, and wouldn't listen to me--in fact, he ordered  me off the station. I was a selector, and that was enough for him. But  young Billy Wall rode after me.    'Look here, Joe!' he said, 'it's a blanky shame. All for the sake of a  horse! And as if that poor devil of a woman hasn't got enough to put up  with already! I wouldn't do it for twenty horses. I'LL tackle the boss,  and if he won't listen to me, I'll walk off the run for the last time,  if I have to carry my swag.'    Billy Wall managed it. The charge was withdrawn, and we got young Billy  Spicer off up-country.    But poor Mrs Spicer was never the same after that. She seldom came up to  our place unless Mary dragged her, so to speak; and then she would talk  of nothing but her last trouble, till her visits were painful to look  forward to.    'If it only could have been kep' quiet--for the sake of the other  children; they are all I think of now. I tried to bring 'em all up  decent, but I s'pose it was my fault, somehow. It's the disgrace that's  killin' me--I can't bear it.'    I was at home one Sunday with Mary and a jolly Bush-girl named Maggie  Charlsworth, who rode over sometimes from Wall's station (I must tell  you about her some other time; James was 'shook after her'), and we got  talkin' about Mrs Spicer. Maggie was very warm about old Wall.    'I expected Mrs Spicer up to-day,' said Mary. 'She seems better lately.'    'Why!' cried Maggie Charlsworth, 'if that ain't Annie coming running up  along the creek. Something's the matter!'    We all jumped up and ran out.    'What is it, Annie?' cried Mary.    'Oh, Mrs Wilson! Mother's asleep, and we can't wake her!'    'What?'    'It's--it's the truth, Mrs Wilson.'    'How long has she been asleep?'    'Since lars' night.'    'My God!' cried Mary, 'SINCE LAST NIGHT?'    'No, Mrs Wilson, not all the time; she woke wonst, about daylight this  mornin'. She called me and said she didn't feel well, and I'd have to  manage the milkin'.'    'Was that all she said?'    'No. She said not to go for you; and she said to feed the pigs and  calves; and she said to be sure and water them geraniums.'    Mary wanted to go, but I wouldn't let her. James and I saddled our  horses and rode down the creek.         *****    Mrs Spicer looked very little different from what she did when I last  saw her alive. It was some time before we could believe that she was  dead. But she was 'past carin'' right enough.          A Double Buggy at Lahey's Creek.          I. Spuds, and a Woman's Obstinacy.      Ever since we were married it had been Mary's great ambition to have a  buggy. The house or furniture didn't matter so much--out there in the  Bush where we were--but, where there were no railways or coaches, and  the roads were long, and mostly hot and dusty, a buggy was the great  thing. I had a few pounds when we were married, and was going to get  one then; but new buggies went high, and another party got hold of a  second-hand one that I'd had my eye on, so Mary thought it over and at  last she said, 'Never mind the buggy, Joe; get a sewing-machine and I'll  be satisfied. I'll want the machine more than the buggy, for a while.  Wait till we're better off.'    After that, whenever I took a contract--to put up a fence or wool-shed,  or sink a dam or something--Mary would say, 'You ought to knock a buggy  out of this job, Joe;' but something always turned up--bad weather or  sickness. Once I cut my foot with the adze and was laid up; and, another  time, a dam I was making was washed away by a flood before I finished  it. Then Mary would say, 'Ah, well--never mind, Joe. Wait till we are  better off.' But she felt it hard the time I built a wool-shed and  didn't get paid for it, for we'd as good as settled about another  second-hand buggy then.    I always had a fancy for carpentering, and was handy with tools. I made  a spring-cart--body and wheels--in spare time, out of colonial hardwood,  and got Little the blacksmith to do the ironwork; I painted the cart  myself. It wasn't much lighter than one of the tip-drays I had, but it  WAS a spring-cart, and Mary pretended to be satisfied with it: anyway, I  didn't hear any more of the buggy for a while.    I sold that cart, for fourteen pounds, to a Chinese gardener who wanted  a strong cart to carry his vegetables round through the Bush. It was  just before our first youngster came: I told Mary that I wanted the  money in case of extra expense--and she didn't fret much at losing  that cart. But the fact was, that I was going to make another try for  a buggy, as a present for Mary when the child was born. I thought of  getting the turn-out while she was laid up, keeping it dark from her  till she was on her feet again, and then showing her the buggy standing  in the shed. But she had a bad time, and I had to have the doctor  regularly, and get a proper nurse, and a lot of things extra; so the  buggy idea was knocked on the head. I was set on it, too: I'd thought of  how, when Mary was up and getting strong, I'd say one morning, 'Go round  and have a look in the shed, Mary; I've got a few fowls for you,' or  something like that--and follow her round to watch her eyes when she saw  the buggy. I never told Mary about that--it wouldn't have done any good.    Later on I got some good timber--mostly scraps that were given to  me--and made a light body for a spring-cart. Galletly, the coach-builder  at Cudgeegong, had got a dozen pairs of American hickory wheels up from  Sydney, for light spring-carts, and he let me have a pair for cost price  and carriage. I got him to iron the cart, and he put it through  the paint-shop for nothing. He sent it out, too, at the tail of Tom  Tarrant's big van--to increase the surprise. We were swells then for  a while; I heard no more of a buggy until after we'd been settled at  Lahey's Creek for a couple of years.    I told you how I went into the carrying line, and took up a selection at  Lahey's Creek--for a run for the horses and to grow a bit of feed--and  shifted Mary and little Jim out there from Gulgong, with Mary's young  scamp of a brother James to keep them company while I was on the road.  The first year I did well enough carrying, but I never cared for it--it  was too slow; and, besides, I was always anxious when I was away from  home. The game was right enough for a single man--or a married one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10366"],[0,"Freedom's Battle (#18)"],[1,"basis. It is not necessary to comment on  these alterations, but I wish to add that if the Congress accepts the  principle of limiting the number of delegates it would be advisable to  introduce the principle of proportional representation. That would  enable all parties who wish to be represented at the Congress.    I observe that _the Servant of India_ sees an inconsistency between my  implied acceptance of the British Committee, so far as the published  draft constitution is concerned, and my recent article in _Young India_  on that Committee and the newspaper _India_. But it is well known that  for several years I have held my present views about the existence of  that body. It would have been irrelevant for me, perhaps, to suggest to  my colleagues the extinction of that committee. It was not our function  to report on the usefulness or otherwise of the Committee. We were  commissioned only for preparing a new constitution. Moreover I knew that  my colleagues were not averse to the existence of the British Committee.  And the drawing up of a new constitution enabled me to show that where  there was no question of principle I was desirous of agreeing quickly  with my opponents in opinions. But I propose certainly to press for  abolition of the committee as it is at present continued, and the  stopping of its organ _India_.      SWARAJ IN NINE MONTHS    Asked by the _Times_ representative as to his impressions formed as a  result of his activities during the last three months, Mr. Gandhi  said:--\"My own impression of these three months' extensive experience is  that this movement of non-co-operation has come to stay, and it is most  decidedly a purifying movement, in spite of isolated instances of  rowdyism, as for instance at Mrs. Besant's meeting in Bombay, at some  places in Delhi, Bengal, and even in Gujarat. The people are  assimilating day after day the spirit of non-violence, not necessarily  as a creed, but as an inevitable policy. I expect most startling  results, more startling than, say, the discoveries of Sir J.C. Bose, or  the acceptance by the people of non-violence. If the Government could be  assured beyond any possibility of doubt that no violence would ever be  offered by us the Government would from that moment alter its character,  unconsciously and involuntarily, but nonetheless surely on that  account.\"    \"Alter its character,--in what, direction?\" asked the _Times_  representative.    \"Certainly in the direction which we ask it should move--that being in  the direction of Government becoming responsive to every call of  the nation.\"    \"Will you kindly explain further?\" asked the representative.    \"By that I mean,\" said Mr. Gandhi, \"people will be able by asserting  themselves through fixed determination and self-sacrifice to gain the  redress of the Khilafat wrong, the Punjab wrong, and attain the Swaraj  of their choice.\"    \"But what is your Swaraj, and where does the Government come in  there--the Government which, you say will alter its character  unconsciously?\"    \"My Swaraj,\" said Mr. Gandhi, \"is the Parliamentary Government of India  in the modern sense of the term for the time being, and that Government  would be secured to us either through the friendly offices of the  British people or without them.\"    \"What do you mean by the phrase, 'without them!'\" questioned the  interviewer.    \"This movement,\" continued Mr. Gandhi, \"is an endeavour to purge the  present Government of selfishness and greed which determine almost every  one of their activities. Suppose that we have made it impossible by  disassociation from them to feed their greed. They might not wish to  remain in India, as happened in the case of Somaliland, where the moment  its administration ceased to be a paying proposition they evacuated it.\"    \"How do you think,\" queried the representative, \"in practice this will  work out?\"    \"What I have sketched before you,\" said Mr. Gandhi, \"is the final  possibility. What I expect is that nothing of that kind will happen. In  so far as I understand the British people I will recognise the force of  public opinion when it has become real and patent. Then, and only then,  will they realise the hideous injustice which in their name the Imperial  ministers and their representatives in India have perpetrated. They will  therefore remedy the two wrongs in accordance with the wishes of the  people, and they will also offer a constitution exactly in accordance  with the wishes of the people of India, as represented by their  chosen leaders.    \"Supposing that the British Government wish to retire because India is  not a paying concern, what do you think will then be the position  of India?\"    Mr. Gandhi answered: \"At that stage surely it is easy to understand that  India will then have evolved either outstanding spiritual height or the  ability to offer violence, against violence. She will have evolved an  organising ability of a high order, and will therefore be in every way  able to cope with any emergency that might arise.\" \"In other words,\"  observed the _Times_ representative, \"you expect the moment of the  British evacuation, if such a contingency arises, will coincide with the  moment of India's preparedness and ability and conditions favourable for  India to take over the Indian administration as a going concern and work  it for the benefit and advancement of the Nation?\"    Mr. Gandhi answered the question with an emphatic affirmative. \"My  experience during the last months fills me with the hope,\" continued Mr.  Gandhi, \"that within the nine months that remain of the year in which I  have expected Swaraj for India we shall redress the two wrongs and we  shall see Swaraj established in accordance with the wishes of the people  of India.\"    \"Where will the present Government be at the end of the nine months?\"  Asked the _Times_ representative.    Mr. Gandhi, with a significant smile, said: \"The lion will then lie with  the lamb.\"    _Young India, December, 1920._      THE ATTAINMENT OF SWARAJ    Mr. Gandhi in moving his resolution on the creed before the Congress,  said, \"The resolution which I have the honour to move is as follows: The  object of the Indian National Congress is the attainment of Swarajya by  the people of India by all legitimate and peaceful means.\"    There are only two kinds of objections, so far as I understand, that  will be advanced from this platform. One is that we may not to-day think  of dissolving the British connection. What I say is that it is  derogatory to national dignity to think of permanence of British  connection at any cost. We are labouring under a grievous wrong, which  it is the personal duty of every Indian to get redressed. This British  Government not only refused to redress the wrong, but it refuses to  acknowledge _its_ mistake and so long as it retains its attitude, it is  not possible for us to say all that we want to be or all that we want to  get, retaining British connection. No matter what difficulties be in our  path, we must make the clearest possible declaration to the world and to  the whole of India, that we may not possibly have British connection, if  the British people will not do this elementary justice. I do not, for  one moment, suggest that we want to end at the British connection at all  costs, unconditionally. If the British connection is for the advancement  of India, we do not want to destroy it. But if it is inconsistent with  our national self respect, then it is our bounden duty to destroy it.  There is room in this resolution for both--those who believe that, by  retaining British connection, we can purify ourselves and purify British  people, and those who have no belief. As for instance, take the extreme  case of Mr. Andrews. He says all hope for India is gone for keeping the  British connection. He says there must be complete severance--complete  independence. There is room enough in this creed for a man like Mr.  Andrews also. Take another illustration, a man like myself or my brother  Shaukat Ali. There is certainly no room for us, if we have eternally to  subscribe to the doctrine, whether these wrongs are redressed or not, we  shall have to evolve ourselves within the British Empire; there is no  room for me in that creed. Therefore this creed is elastic enough to  take in both shades of opinions and the British people will have to  beware that, if they do not want to do justice, it will be the bounden  duty of every Indian to destroy the Empire.    I want just now to wind up my remarks with a personal appeal, drawing  your attention to an object lesson that was presented in the Bengal  camp yesterday. If you want Swaraj, you have got a demonstration of how  to get Swaraj. There was a little bit of skirmish, a little bit of  squabble, and a little bit of difference in the Bengal camp, as there  will always be differences so long as the world lasts. I have known  differences between husband and wife, because I am still a husband; I  have noticed differences between parents and children, because I am  still a father of four boys, and they are all strong enough to destroy  their father so far as bodily struggle is concerned; I possess that  varied experience of husband and parent; I know that we shall always  have squabbles, we shall always have differences but the lesson that I  want to draw your attention to is that I had the honour and privilege of  addressing both the parties. They gave me their undivided attention and  what is more they showed their attachment, their affection and their  fellowship for me by accepting the humble advice that I had the honour  of tendering to them, and I told them I am not here to distribute  justice that can be awarded only through our worthy president. But I ask  you not to go to the president, you need not worry him. If you are  strong, if you are brave, if you are intent upon getting Swaraj, and if  you really want to revise the creed, then"]]]
