Art on the chokesome cherry bent?        Dost seek the chestnut burr?      _Pale Studént_:      O it is not for the mellow chestnut        That I so far am come,    Nor yet for puckery cherries, but        For Cypripediúm.      A blossom hangs the choke-cherry        And eke the chestnut burr,    And thou a silly fowl must be,        Thou red-head wood-peckére.      _Picas Erythrocephalus_:      Turn back, turn back, thou pale studént,        Nor in the forest go;    There lurks beneath his bosky tent        The deadly mosquitó,      And there the wooden-chuck doth tread,        And from the oak-tree's top    The red, red squirrels on thy head        The frequent acorn drop.      _Pale Studént_:      The wooden-chuck is next of kin        Unto the wood-peckére:    I fear not thine ill-boding din,        And why should I fear her?      What though a score of acorns drop        And squirrels' fur be red!    'Tis not so ruddy as thy top--        So scarlet as thy head.      O rarely blooms the Cypripe-        diúm upon its stalk;    And like a torch it shines to me        Adown the dark wood-walk.      O joy to pluck it from the ground,        To view the purple sac,    To touch the sessile stigma's round--        And shall I then turn back?      _Picus Erytbrocephalus_:      O black and shining is the log        That feeds the sumptuous weed,    Nor stone is found nor bedded log        Where foot may well proceed.      Midmost it glimmers in the mire       Like Jack o' Lanthorn's spark,    Lighting, with phosphorescent fire,        The green umbrageous dark.      There while thy thirsty glances drink        The fair and baneful plant,    Thy shoon within the ooze shall sink        And eke thine either pant.      _Pale Studént_:      Give o'er, give o'er, thou wood-peckóre;        The bark upon the tree,    Thou, at thy will, mayst peck and bore        But peck and bore not me.      Full two long hours I've searched about        And 't would in sooth be rum,    If I should now go back without        The Cypripediúm.      _Picus Erythrocephalus_:      Farewell! Farewell! But this I tell        To thee, thou pale studént,    Ere dews have fell, thou'lt rue it well        That woodward thou didst went:      Then whilst thou blows the drooping nose        And wip'st the pensive eye--    There where the sad _symplocarpus foetidus_ grows,        Then think--O think of I!      Loud flouted there that student wight        Solche warnynge for to hear;    \"I scorn, old hen, thy threats of might,        And eke thine ill grammére.\"      \"Go peck the lice (or green or red)        That swarm the bass-wood tree,    But wag no more thine addled head        Nor clack thy tongue at me.\"      The wood-peck turned to whet her beak,        The student heard her drum,    As through the wood he went to seek        The Cypripediúm.      Alas! and for that pale studént:        The evening bell did ring,    And down the walk the Freshmen went        Unto the prayer-meetíng;      Upon the fence loud rose the song,        The weak, weak tea was o'er--    Ha! who is he that sneaks along        Into South Middle's door?      The mud was on his shoon, and O!        The briar was in his thumb,    His staff was in his hand but no--        No Cypripediúm.                              _Henry A. Beers_.          _COLLUSION BETWEEN A ALEGAITER AND A WATER-SNAIK_      There is a niland on a river lying,    Which runs into Gautimaly, a warm country,    Lying near the Tropicks, covered with sand;    Hear and their a symptum of a Wilow,    Hanging of its umberagious limbs & branches    Over the clear streme meandering far below.    This was the home of the now silent Alegaiter,    When not in his other element confine'd:    Here he wood set upon his eggs asleep    With 1 ey observant of flis and other passing    Objects: a while it kept a going on so:    Fereles of danger was the happy Alegaiter!    But a las! in a nevil our he was fourced to    Wake! that dreme of Blis was two sweet for him.    1 morning the sun arose with unusool splender    Whitch allso did our Alegaiter, coming from the water,    His scails a flinging of the rais of the son back,    To the fountain-head which tha originly sprung from,    But having not had nothing to eat for some time, he    Was slepy and gap'd, in a short time, widely.    Unfoalding soon a welth of perl-white teth,    The rais of the son soon shet his sinister ey    Because of their mutool splendor and warmth.    The evil Our (which I sed) was now come;    Evidently a good chans for a water-snaik    Of the large specie, which soon appeared    Into the horison, near the bank where reposed    Calmly in slepe the Alegaiter before spoken of.    About 60 feet was his Length (not the 'gaiter)    And he was aperiently a well-proportioned snaik.    When he was all ashore he glared upon    The iland with approval, but was soon    \"Astonished with the view and lost to wonder\" (from Wats)    (For jest then he began to see the Alegaiter)    Being a nateral enemy of his'n, he worked hisself    Into a fury, also a ni position.    Before the Alegaiter well could ope    His eye (in other words perceive his danger)    The Snaik had enveloped his body just 19    Times with \"foalds voluminous and vast\" (from Milton)    And had tore off several scails in the confusion,    Besides squeazing him awfully into his stomoc.    Just then, by a fortinate turn in his affairs,    He ceazed into his mouth the careless tale    Of the unreflecting water-snaik!  Grown desperate    He, finding that his tale was fast squesed    Terrible while they roaled all over the iland.      It was a well-conduckted Affair; no noise    Disturbed the harmony of the seen, ecsept    Onct when a Willow was snaped into by the roaling.    Eeach of the combatence hadn't a minit for holering.    So the conflick was naterally tremenjous!    But soon by grate force the tail was bit complete-    Ly of; but the eggzeration was too much    For his delicate Constitootion; he felt a compression    Onto his chest and generally over his body;    When he ecspressed his breathing, it was with    Grate difficulty that he felt inspired again onct more.    Of course this state must suffer a revolootion.    So the alegaiter give but one yel, and egspired.    The water-snaik realed hisself off, & survay'd    For say 10 minits, the condition of    His fo: then wondering what made his tail hurt,    He slowly went off for to cool.                              _J.

"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9408"],[0,"By Water to the Columbian Exposition (#17)"],[1,"increases the number of meliorated contrivances.    The pump exhibit was grouped around a tank of water, comprising an area of  7,500 feet. Here at the junction of the main hall and annex, scores of  modern pumps were in active operation.    Of the foreign countries we found Germany best represented, quantitatively  as well as qualitatively. The other prominent displays were made by  France, Great Britain, Canada, Belgium, Russia, Spain, Italy, Mexico, New  South Wales, Austria, and Switzerland.    Here, the mechanical engineer was enabled to make studies of incalculable  profit for his professional career; and even the lay mind received a vast  amount of information.    We abandoned the Machinery Hall at its northern extremity, and repaired to  the most magnificent structure on the Exposition Grounds. The exterior of  the ADMINISTRATION BUILDING, so rich in architectural treatment, had  compelled our admiration, to be sure; but the interior features even  exceeded it in splendor. The four mammoth entrances were beautifully  adorned by statuaries of emblematic character. There exist but few  edifices of similar character, whose ornamentations rival those of its  interior dome, which rose 200 feet from the floor.    The four corner pavilions, four stories high, contained offices for the  various departments of the Administration; Board and Committee rooms; the  Postoffice; a Bank, etc.    An exhibit, manifesting the unrivaled wealth of the republic, and placed  in the center of the rotunda on the first floor was an excellent  reproduction of the Capitol in Washington in miniature, erected of silver  coins: indeed a master-piece. I shall leave it to the reader to find out  how many of the half dollar-pieces were needed for the construction of  this unique building, contributed by the U.S. Government. To our regret  Mr. George R. Davis, Director-General of the Columbian exposition, whom we  intended to call upon, was absent. So we determined to have the  ELECTRICITY BUILDING next in our programme.    The sundry appliances of electricity dispersed in all parts of the  grounds, gave us already a conception of the incomparable rapidity with  which it has developed--both as an industry and science. The intramural  railway demonstrated the latest application of electric motor power to  elevated railroads.    The illumination of the grounds and buildings showed the marvelous  progress achieved in electric lighting, and the expertness in obtaining  brilliant spectacular effects. The electric launches on the lagoons  manifested the usage of electricity for water-transportation.    All these practical exhibits represented purely commercial features,  whereas the displays in the building--we just had entered--offered a field  of relevations as regards the extraordinary accomplishments in the  electrical science. They embraced all the improvements from the earlier  inventions to the latest marvels.    In the southern portion of the main floor, the United States showed  various devices for creating the three economic commodities--light, heat,  and power.    With great interest we inspected the numerous apparatuses illustrating the  phenomena and laws of electricity--the instruments for electrical  measurements--the electric batteries--and the machines for producing  electrical currents by mechanical power. How transmission and regulation  of these currents are effected, could be studied by a vast number of  devices.    A very interesting group constituted the electric motors and their  manifold applications as to street and other railways; to mining, to  elevators, pumps, printing presses, and domestic appliances.    The creation of light by electricity was beautifully elucidated by the  weird illumination of the Edison Light Tower in the center of the  building, and the Egyptian Temple in its south-eastern portion. Countless  incandescent lamps were glowing in all the colors of the rainbow. The  luminary effect gave us the impression as if a fiery serpent was  meandering along these iridescent glass-tubes with inimitable velocity.    Among the inventions of later date may be reckoned the use of electricity  in heating; especially for industrial operations as electric forging,  welding, brazing, tempering, etc.    The lay mind is almost incapable of estimating the utilarian capacity of  this great property. Even many branches of modern sciences have received  eminent advancement by its utilization; such as surgery, dentistry,  therapeutics, metallurgy, chemistry, etc.    Germany and France made the most commendable foreign display. Great  Britain, Brazil, Austria, Italy, Japan, and Canada had contributed in  accordance with the development of this novel industry within their  territory.    The gallery was devoted to the wire exhibit and lighter scientific  apparatuses. Here were placed all the recent improvements applied to  telephony and telegraphy.    Professor Elisha Gray's sensational invention--the telautograph--in active  operation, attracted many spectators. It is a very ingenious contrivance,  of which I have given a detailed description in my pamphlet on  electricity--recently published in Cincinnati, O., by the Burgheim  Publishing Co.    The great number of exhibits demonstrated the achievements in the economic  usage of electricity during an amazingly short period. In fact, the  electrician has obtained unequaled results in his profession. To him is  due--to a great extent--the high stage of perfection in sciences, arts,  and industries at the present day.    Nevertheless, the field of electrical scientific researches is by no means  exhausted. However, an entirely new era will have dawned, when the  ever-increasing knowledge reveals to an ingenious inventor a method to  apply the electric current to every-day-usage as easily and inexpensively  as we utilize water at present.    Then the epoch has appeared which may be properly styled the \"_Happy_\" or  \"_Golden Age_.\" For, many cares and sorrows will be removed at once.    The conscientious housekeeper, for instance, whose domestic duties often  exhaust her bodily strength, will find her burdens greatly lightened. She  has no more to suffer from the intolerable heat of her cooking-stove,  while furnishing repasts on oppressive summer days. The electric current  will cause the water to boil--the meat to broil--and the potatoes to fry.  Yea, her dinner will be cooked ere she is conscious of that fact.    In like manner the electric flat-iron will smoothen her linen without  fatiguing her. But not only the lady of the house will rejoice; also the  poor, hen-pecked husband will be in transports of delight, as it will make  his path easier in many ways. The constant complaints he was hitherto  obliged to endure, will grow mute for ever, and the curtain lecture will  be no more.    Furthermore, should circumstances compel the active business man to part  with his wife for a long time, the marvelous inventions enable their  mutual intercourse during the separation as if time and space were unknown  factors. The lady need not suffer long from inquietude concerning her  husband's safe arrival; for the receiving instrument of her telautograph  reproduces instantaneously his own handwriting. A parcel, sent to her by  express, contains a cylinder to the improved phonograph. When bringing it  in proper contact with this wonderful instrument, she hears her consort's  voice, just as if he was by her side, and a thousand leagues were but a  few inches. Moreover, Edison's kimetograph portrays the beloved features  of her absent spouse. She is now perfectly consoled; for the radiant  expression of his countenance manifests health and happiness.    Having left the imposing Electricity Building, we repaired to a structure  in close proximity dedicated to exhibits of the mineral kingdom. Never  before, the records of international expositions gave account of a similar  fact; namely, that the display made of MINES AND MINING was so capacious  as to require the erection of a special edifice. Its size and  architectural beauties rivaled those of the great structures in Jackson  Park. The magnificent arched entrance of the north front was richly  embellished with sculptural decorations emblematic of mining and its  allied industries. This spacious gateway led us to the main floor, which  presented a spectacle so weird that its impression cannot be easily  effaced. In temples and pavilions of ineffable gorgeousness were exhibits  of gems and precious metals of dazzling beauty. Useful ores and their  products, building stones, soils, salt, petroleum--indeed, everything that  man furthers from the dark entrails of the earth, was offered to  inspection.    Besides the mineral resources of the world in their original state, the  displays embraced many devices of mining machinery; such as pumps and  engines used in mining, moving, and delivering ores; apparatuses for  breaking out ore and coal; for crushing and pulverizing; for reducing  metals, for instance the extraction of gold and silver by milling,  lixiviation, and fire; furthermore, boring and drilling tools; grinding  and polishing substances, etc.    The galleries containing especially the metallurgical collection, had the  appearance of the scientific department of a museum combined with the  laboratory and library of a university.    Moreover, there were offered to view many interesting and instructive  working models, various unique exhibits, and thousands of geological  specimens.    Germany, France, and New South Wales were the leading foreign countries in  this building. Great Britain and her numerous colonies occupied the  largest collective space. The brilliant outlay of the Cape Colony included  40,000 rough diamonds, and illustrated the method of polishing them.  Canada's mineral showing was so ponderous as to exceed the weight of 125  tons. It comprised every known species of mineral, marble, and granite in  that"]]]
