Nia domo ne estas tre granda, sed gxi  estas nova kaj ni multe sxatas gxin. Gxia salono estas granda, kun belaj  puraj kurtenoj kovrantaj la fenestrojn, kaj mola dika tapisxo kovranta  la plankon. Cxi tie estas kelkaj segxoj, malgranda tablo, kaj longa  kanapo. Personoj vizitantaj nin kutime sidas en cxi tiu cxambro, kaj  dum ni estas sidantaj tie ni nur parolas, anstataux skribi aux legi.  Alia cxambro en la domo estas tre luma kaj agrabla, sed malpli granda.  Cxi tie staras tablo suficxe granda por nia tuta familio, kaj en tiu  cxambro oni mangxas. Ofte ni restas tie longan tempon post la mangxo,  cxar la patro rakontas interesajn rakontojn al ni, kaj ni multe ridas,  kaj demandas pri tiuj rakontoj, kaj tiel bone amuzas nin ke mi preskaux  forgesas pri miaj lecionoj. Tamen mi havas multe da lecionoj por lerni,  kaj ili tute ne estas facilaj. Je tre frua horo matene mi iras al la  lernejo, kun miaj fratoj kaj fratinoj. Nur sabate kaj dimancxe ni ne  iras tien. La lernejo estas malnova kaj malgranda, sed oni estas nun  konstruanta novan pli grandan lernejon apud nia domo. Dum la infanoj  estas lernantaj siajn lecionojn tie, la patrino kutime iras al la  bakejon, por acxeti suficxe da pano, por la mangxoj de la tago. Ofte  sxi iras ankaux al aliaj butikoj. Jxauxdon sxi acxetis kelke da novaj  pizoj, kaj da asparago. Vendredon sxi acxetis kelkajn funtojn da sukero,  skatolon da fragoj, kaj suficxe da kremo kaj lakto. Hodiaux sxi estas  acxetanta brasikon kaj sakon da terpomoj. Sxi volas kuiri tre bonan  mangxon, tamen sxi havas tro multe por fari en la kuirejo, cxar sxi ne  havas servistinon.                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. Who is the woman sitting on the sofa in the parlor? 2. I can not  easily see her, but I hear her voice. 3. I wonder whose voice that is.  4. However, I think that it is the voice of a friend of Mother's. 5. Now  I can see her, although she does not see me. 6. I am well acquainted  with her. 7. She is a friend of our whole family, and is visiting a  neighbor of ours (\"najbaron nian\") in this city. 8. My sister is sitting  on the sofa in another room, and learning her lessons. 9. Soon she  will go to school. 10. Whose book is she reading? 11. That thick book  is mine, but the other books on the table near her are hers. 12. She  prefers to sit in the sewing-room (111) to read or write (98), because  the curtains in front of the windows are not too thick, and so (78)  that room is very light and pleasant. 13. She also likes to look at the  falling snow, and the men and women walking on the muddy streets. 14. On  account of the cold weather, people are wearing thick clothes. 15. The  men and boys are keeping their hands in their pockets while they walk.  16. The girls walking toward the school are friends of my sister's. 17.  In that school they learn to cook. Soon they will be able to bake bread,  and even to cook a whole meal. 18. I think such a custom is very good.  19. Many persons can not cook well enough (\"suficxe bone\").                                      LESSON XXV.                            THE INTERROGATIVE ADJECTIVE.    112. The interrogative adjective related to the interrogative pronoun  \"kiu\", is \"kia\", what kind of, what sort of:       Kiajn vestojn li portis? What sort of clothes did he wear?     Kian panon vi preferas? What kind of bread do you prefer?     Mi miras kia persono li estas. I wonder what sort of a person he is.     Kia vetero estas? What sort of weather is it?     Kia plezuro! What a pleasure!                                THE IMPERFECT TENSE.    113. The compound tense formed by using the present active participle  with the past tense of \"esti\" represents an act or condition as in  progress in past time, but not perfected, and is called the \"imperfect  tense\". The conjugation of \"vidi\" in this tense is as follows:       mi estis vidanta. I was seeing.     vi estis vidanta. you were seeing.     li (sxi, gxi) estis vidanta. he (she, it) was seeing.     ni estis vidantaj. we were seeing.     vi estis vidantaj. you were seeing.     ili estis vidantaj. they were seeing.                           THE PROGRESSIVE FUTURE TENSE.    114. The compound tense formed by using the present active participle  with the future tense of \"esti\" represents an act or condition as in  progress--or a condition as existing continuously--at a future time, and  is called the \"progressive future\" tense. The conjugation of \"vidi\" in  this tense is as follows:       mi estos vidanta. I shall be seeing.     vi estos vidanta. you will be seeing.     li (sxi, gxi) estos vidanta. he (she, it) will be seeing.     ni estos vidantaj. we shall be seeing.     vi estos vidantaj. you will be seeing.     ili estos vidantaj. they will be seeing.                           SALUTATIONS AND EXCLAMATIONS.    exclamation may be regarded as the direct object of a verb which is not  expressed; these words are put in the accusative       Bonan matenon! Good morning! (I wish you \"good morning.\")     Bonan nokton! Good night! (I wish you a \"good night.\")     Multajn salutojn al via patro!        (I send) many greetings to your father!     Dankon! Thanks! (I give to you \"thanks.\")     Cxielon! Heavens! (I invoke the \"heavens.\")                                  WORD FORMATION.    116. The majority of roots have such a meaning that at least two kinds  of words, and often three or four, may be formed from them by use of  the general endings for verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs. (Each  root will hereafter be quoted but once in the vocabularies, with a  hyphen separating it from the ending with which it appears first in the  reading lesson, or with which it is most frequently used.) Following are  examples of word formation from roots already familiar:    VERB.         NOUN.                ADJECTIVE.           ADVERB.    brili         brilo                brila                 brile     to shine      shine, brilliance    shining, brilliant    brilliantly    flori         floro                flora                 flore     to bloom      flower, blossom      floral                florally    gxoji         gxojo                gxoja                 gxoje     to rejoice    joy, gladness        joyful, glad          gladly    kontuzi       kontuzo     to bruise     bruise, contusion                  tuto                 tuta                  tute                   whole                entire, whole, all    entirely                                 \"KONI\" AND \"SCII\".    117. The verb \"koni\", which means \"to know\" in the sense of \"to be  acquainted with\" is used in speaking of persons, languages, places, etc.  \"Koni\" always has a direct object. It is never followed by \"ke\", \"cxu\",  \"kiu\", or any other interrogative word. \"Scii\" means \"to know\" in the  sense of \"to be aware,\" \"to have knowledge.\" It is not used in speaking  of persons.    [Footnote: \"Koni\" is equivalent to German \"kennen\", French \"connaitre\",  Spanish \"conocer\", while \"scii\" is equivalent to German \"wissen\", French  \"savoir\", Spanish \"saber\".]       Cxu vi konas tiun personon? Do you know that person?     Mi scias ke li estas nia najbaro. I know that he is our neighbor.     Mi bone konas Bostonon. I am well acquainted with Boston.     Mi ne scias cxu li konas ilin. I do not know whether he knows them.

LA NEPO VIZITAS LA AVINON.    Hieraux matene mi vizitis la avinon. Sxia hejmo estas apud la granda  nova bakejo. Mi vidis sxin tra la fenestro, cxar la kurtenoj kovrantaj  gxin estas tre maldikaj. Sxi estis sidanta sur la kanapo, kaj skribanta  per plumo sur granda papero. Antaux ol frapi sur la pordo mi vokis sxin  kaj diris \"Bonan matenon, kara avino!\" Tuj sxi demandis \"Kiu estas tie?  Kies vocxon mi auxdas?\" Mi respondis \"Estas via nepo. Cxu vi ne konas  mian vocxon?\" Antaux ol sxi povis veni al la pordo mi estis malfermanta  gxin. Mi iris en la salonon kaj donis al la avino bukedon da floroj.  \"La patrino donas cxi tiujn al vi, kun siaj plej bonaj salutoj,\" mi  diris. La avino respondis \"Nu, kia plezuro! Multan dankon al sxi pro la  bela bukedo, kaj ankaux al vi, cxar vi portis gxin cxi tien por mi!\"  Dum sxi estis metanta la florojn en glason da akvo la avino diris \"Nu,  kiajn lecionojn vi havis hodiaux en la lernejo?\" Mi respondis ke mi  bone konis la lecionojn, cxar mi zorge studis ilin. \"Ni estas lernantaj  la germanan lingvon,\" mi diris, \"kaj ju pli longe ni studas gxin, des  pli multe mi gxin sxatas, kvankam gxi estas tre malfacila.\" Mi rakontis  ankaux pri la lecionoj de geometrio, kaj aliaj lecionoj, sed diris ke la  ekzamenoj estos baldaux komencantaj. \"Je tiu tempo,\" mi diris, \"mi estos  skribanta la respondojn al la ekzamenoj, preskaux la tutan semajnon.\"  La avino demandis kun intereso \"Cxu la demandoj de la ekzamenoj estos  malfacilaj?\" Mi respondis \"Mi ne scias, sed mi timas ke ni estos tre  lacaj post tiom da laboro.\" Post kelke da aliaj demandoj kaj respondoj,  mi opiniis ke estas la horo por foriri. Dum mi estis foriranta, la avino  diris \"Multajn salutojn al la tuta familio!\" Mi dankis sxin, diris  \"Bonan tagon!\" kaj tiam foriris.                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. What sort of noise do I hear outside the door? 2. Are some of my  friends knocking? 3. We were talking yesterday about the examinations in  our school, and these boys came home to study with me. 4. I shall go to  the door to open it and to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/781"],[0,"Sinking of the Titanic and Great Sea Disasters (#17)"],[1,"was unloaded before nine o'clock. Some of  the life-boats were only half filled, the first one having but two men  and eleven women, when it had accommodations for at least forty. There  were few men in the boats. The women were the gamest lot I have ever  seen. Some of the men and women were in evening clothes, and others  among those saved had nothing on but night clothes and raincoats.\"    After the Carpathia had made certain that there were no more passengers  of the Titanic to be picked up, she threaded her way out of the ice  fields for fifty miles. It was dangerous work, but it was managed  without trouble.      AID FOR THE SUFFERING AND HYSTERICAL    The shrieks and cries of the women and men picked up in life-boats by  the Carpathia were horrible. The women were clothed only in night robes  and wrappers. The men were in their night garments. One was lifted on  board entirely nude. All the passengers who could bear nourishment were  taken into the dining rooms and cabins by Captain Rostron and given food  and stimulants. Passengers of the Carpathia gave up their berths and  staterooms to the survivors.    As soon as they were landed on the Carpathia many of the women became  hysterical, but on the whole they behaved splendidly. Men and women  appeared to be stunned all day Monday, the full force of the disaster  not reaching them until Tuesday night. After being wrapped up in  blankets and filled with brandy and hot coffee, the first thoughts were  for their husbands and those at home. Most of them imagined that their  husbands had been picked up by other vessels, and they began flooding  the wireless rooms with messages. It was almost certain that those who  were not on board the Carpathia had gone down to death.    One of the most seriously injured was a woman who had lost both her  children. Her limbs had been severely torn; but she was very patient.    WOMEN SEEKING NEWS    In the first cabin library women of wealth and refinement mingled their  grief and asked eagerly for news of the possible arrival of a belated  boat, or a message from other steamers telling of the safety of their  husbands. Mrs. Henry B. Harris, wife of a New York theatrical manager,  checked her tears long enough to beg that some message of hope be sent  to her father-in-law. Mrs. G. Thorne, Miss Marie Young, Mrs Emil Taussig  and her daughter, Ruth, Mrs. Martin Rothschild, Mrs. William Augustus  Spencer, Mrs. J. Stewart White and Mrs. Walter M. Clark were a few  of those who lay back, exhausted, on the leather cushions and told in  shuddering sentences of their experiences.    Mrs. John Jacob Astor and the Countess of Rothes had been taken to  staterooms soon after their arrival on shipboard.    Before noon, at the captain's request, the first cabin passengers of the  Titanic gathered in the saloon and the passengers of other classes in  corresponding places on the rescue ship. Then the collecting of names  was begun by the purser and the stewards. A second table was served in  both cabins for the new guests, and the Carpathia's second cabin, being  better filled than its first, the second class arrivals had to be sent  to the steerage.      TEARS THEIR ONLY RELIEF    Mrs. Jacques Futrelle, wife of the novelist, herself a writer of note,  sat dry eyed in the saloon, telling her friends that she had given up  hope for her husband. She joined with the rest in inquiries as to the  chances of rescue by another ship, and no one told her what soon came  to be the fixed opinion of the men--that all those saved were on the  Carpathia.    \"I feel better,\" Mrs. Futrelle said hours afterward, \"for I can cry  now.\"    Among the men conversation centered on the accident and the  responsibility for it. Many expressed the belief that the Titanic, in  common with other vessels, had had warning of the ice packs, but that in  the effort to establish a record on the maiden run sufficient heed had  not been paid to the warnings.    \"God knows I'm not proud to be here,\" said a rich New York man. \"I got  on a boat when they were about to lower it and when, from delays below,  there was no woman to take the vacant place. I don't think any man who  was saved is deserving of censure, but I realize that, in contrast with  those who went down, we may be viewed unfavorably.\" He showed a picture  of his baby boy as he spoke.      PITIFUL SCENES OF GRIEF    As the day passed the fore part of the ship assumed some degree of order  and comfort, but the crowded second sabin and rear decks gave forth the  incessant sound of lamentation. A bride of two months sat on the floor  and moaned her widowhood. An Italian mother shrieked the name of her  lost son.    A girl of seven wept over the loss of her Teddy bear and two dolls,  while her mother, with streaming eyes, dared not tell the child that her  father was lost too, and that the money for which their home in England  had been sold had gone down with him. Other children clung to the necks  of the fathers who, because carrying them, had been permitted to take  the boats.    In the hospital and the public rooms lay, in blankets, several others  who had been benumbed by the water. Mrs. Rosa Abbott, who was in the  water for hours, was restored during the day. K. Whiteman, the Titanic's  barber, who declared he was blown off the ship by the second of the two  explosions after the crash, was treated for bruises. A passenger, who  was thoroughly ducked before being picked up, caused much amusement on  this ship, soon after the doctors were through with him, by demanding a  bath.      SURVIVORS AID THE DESTITUTE    Storekeeper Prentice, the last man off the Titanic to reach this ship,  was also soon over the effects of his long swim in the icy waters into  which he leaped from the poop deck.    The physicians of the Carpathia were praised, as was Chief Steward  Hughes, for work done in making the arrivals comfortable and averting  serious illness.    Monday night on the Carpathia was one of rest. The wailing and sobbing  of the day were hushed as widows and orphans slept. Tuesday, save for  the crowded condition of the ship, matters took somewhat their normal  appearance.    The second cabin dining room had been turned into a hospital to care  for the injured, and the first, second and third class dining rooms were  used for sleeping rooms at night for women, while the smoking rooms were  set aside for men. All available space was used, some sleeping in chairs  and some on the floor, while a few found rest in the bathrooms.    Every cabin had been filled, and women and children were sleeping on the  floors in the dining saloon, library and smoking rooms. The passengers  of the Carpathia had divided their clothes with the shipwrecked ones  until they had at least kept warm. It is true that many women had to  appear on deck in kimonos and some in underclothes with a coat thrown  over them, but their lives had been spared and they had not thought of  dress. Some children in the second cabin were entirely without clothes,  but the women had joined together, and with needles and thread they  could pick up from passenger to passenger, had made warm clothes out of  the blankets belonging to the Carpathia.      WOMEN BEFRIENDED ONE ANOTHER    The women aboard the Carpathia did what they could by word and act to  relieve the sufferings of the rescued. Most of the survivors were in  great need of clothing, and this the women of the Carpathia supplied to  them as long as their surplus stock held out.    J. A. Shuttleworth, of Louisville, Ky., befriended Mrs. Lucien Smith,  whose husband went down with the Titanic. Mrs. Smith was formerly Miss  Eloise Hughes, daughter of Representative and Mrs. James A. Hughes, of  Huntington, W. Va., and was on her wedding trip. Mr. Shuttleworth asked  her if there wasn't something he could do for her. She said that all the  money she had was lost on the Titanic, so Mr. Shuttleworth gave her $500      DEATHS ON THE CARPATHIA    Two of the rescued from the Titanic died from shock and exposure before  they reached the Carpathia, and another died a few minutes after being  taken on board. The dead were W. H. Hoyte, first cabin; Abraham Hormer,  third class, and S. C. Sirbert, steward, and they were buried at sea the  morning of April 15th, latitude 41.14 north, longitude 51.24 west. P.  Lyon, able seaman, died and was buried at sea the following morning.    An assistant steward lost his mind upon seeing one of the Titanic's  rescued firemen expire after being lifted to the deck of the Carpathia.    An Episcopal bishop and a Catholic priest from Montreal read services of  their respective churches over the dead.    The bodies were sewed up in sacks, heavily weighted at the feet, and  taken to an opening in the side of the ship on the lower deck not far  above the water line. A long plank tilted at one end served as the  incline down which the weighted sacks slid into the sea.    \"After we got the Titanic's passengers on board our ship,\" said one of  the Carpathia's officers, \"it was a question as to where we should take  them. Some said the Olympic would come out and meet us and take them on  to New York, but others said they would die if they had to be lowered  again into small boats to be taken up by another, so we finally turned  toward New York, delaying the Carpathia's passengers eight days in  reaching Gibraltar.\"      SURVIVORS WATCH NEW BOATS    There were several children on board, who had lost their parents--one  baby of eleven months with a nurse who, coming on board the Carpathia  with the first boat, watched with eagerness and sorrow for each incoming  boat, but to no avail. The parents had gone down.    There was a woman in the second cabin who lost seven children out of  ten, and there were many other losses quite as horrible.      MR. ISMY \"PITIABLE SIGHT\"    Among the rescued ones who came on board the Carpathia was the president  of the White Star Line.    \"Mr. Ismay"]]]
