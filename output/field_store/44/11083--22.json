[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583"],[0,"The Woman in White (#17)"],[1,"obliged me to take you into my confidence under very delicate  circumstances, even my helpless situation would, perhaps, be no excuse  for me.  But as things are I cannot surely be wrong, after all that has  passed between us, in forgetting that you are a friend of only three  months' standing.\"    She gave me the letter.  It began abruptly, without any preliminary  form of address, as follows--      \"Do you believe in dreams? I hope, for your own sake, that you do. See  what Scripture says about dreams and their fulfilment (Genesis xl. 8,  xli. 25; Daniel iv. 18-25), and take the warning I send you before it  is too late.    \"Last night I dreamed about you, Miss Fairlie.  I dreamed that I was  standing inside the communion rails of a church--I on one side of the  altar-table, and the clergyman, with his surplice and his prayer-book,  on the other.    \"After a time there walked towards us, down the aisle of the church, a  man and a woman, coming to be married.  You were the woman.  You looked  so pretty and innocent in your beautiful white silk dress, and your  long white lace veil, that my heart felt for you, and the tears came  into my eyes.    \"They were tears of pity, young lady, that heaven blesses and instead  of falling from my eyes like the everyday tears that we all of us shed,  they turned into two rays of light which slanted nearer and nearer to  the man standing at the altar with you, till they touched his breast.  The two rays sprang ill arches like two rainbows between me and him.  I  looked along them, and I saw down into his inmost heart.    \"The outside of the man you were marrying was fair enough to see. He  was neither tall nor short--he was a little below the middle size.  A  light, active, high-spirited man--about five-and-forty years old, to  look at.  He had a pale face, and was bald over the forehead, but had  dark hair on the rest of his head.  His beard was shaven on his chin,  but was let to grow, of a fine rich brown, on his cheeks and his upper  lip.  His eyes were brown too, and very bright; his nose straight and  handsome and delicate enough to have done for a woman's.  His hands the  same.  He was troubled from time to time with a dry hacking cough, and  when he put up his white right hand to his mouth, he showed the red  scar of an old wound across the back of it.  Have I dreamt of the right  man? You know best, Miss Fairlie and you can say if I was deceived or  not. Read next, what I saw beneath the outside--I entreat you, read,  and profit.    \"I looked along the two rays of light, and I saw down into his inmost  heart.  It was black as night, and on it were written, in the red  flaming letters which are the handwriting of the fallen angel, 'Without  pity and without remorse.  He has strewn with misery the paths of  others, and he will live to strew with misery the path of this woman by  his side.' I read that, and then the rays of light shifted and pointed  over his shoulder; and there, behind him, stood a fiend laughing.  And  the rays of light shifted once more, and pointed over your shoulder;  and there behind you, stood an angel weeping.  And the rays of light  shifted for the third time, and pointed straight between you and that  man.  They widened and widened, thrusting you both asunder, one from  the other.  And the clergyman looked for the marriage-service in vain:  it was gone out of the book, and he shut up the leaves, and put it from  him in despair.  And I woke with my eyes full of tears and my heart  beating--for I believe in dreams.    \"Believe too, Miss Fairlie--I beg of you, for your own sake, believe as  I do.  Joseph and Daniel, and others in Scripture, believed in dreams.  Inquire into the past life of that man with the scar on his hand,  before you say the words that make you his miserable wife.  I don't  give you this warning on my account, but on yours.  I have an interest  in your well-being that will live as long as I draw breath.  Your  mother's daughter has a tender place in my heart--for your mother was  my first, my best, my only friend.\"      There the extraordinary letter ended, without signature of any sort.    The handwriting afforded no prospect of a clue.  It was traced on ruled  lines, in the cramped, conventional, copy-book character technically  termed \"small hand.\" It was feeble and faint, and defaced by blots, but  had otherwise nothing to distinguish it.    \"That is not an illiterate letter,\" said Miss Halcombe, \"and at the  same time, it is surely too incoherent to be the letter of an educated  person in the higher ranks of life.  The reference to the bridal dress  and veil, and other little expressions, seem to point to it as the  production of some woman.  What do you think, Mr. Hartright?\"    \"I think so too.  It seems to me to be not only the letter of a woman,  but of a woman whose mind must be----\"    \"Deranged?\" suggested Miss Halcombe.  \"It struck me in that light too.\"    I did not answer.  While I was speaking, my eyes rested on the last  sentence of the letter: \"Your mother's daughter has a tender place in  my heart--for your mother was my first, my best, my only friend.\" Those  words and the doubt which had just escaped me as to the sanity of the  writer of the letter, acting together on my mind, suggested an idea,  which I was literally afraid to express openly, or even to encourage  secretly.  I began to doubt whether my own faculties were not in danger  of losing their balance.  It seemed almost like a monomania to be  tracing back everything strange that happened, everything unexpected  that was said, always to the same hidden source and the same sinister  influence.  I resolved, this time, in defence of my own courage and my  own sense, to come to no decision that plain fact did not warrant, and  to turn my back resolutely on everything that tempted me in the shape  of surmise.    \"If we have any chance of tracing the person who has written this,\" I  said, returning the letter to Miss Halcombe, \"there can be no harm in  seizing our opportunity the moment it offers.  I think we ought to  speak to the gardener again about the elderly woman who gave him the  letter, and then to continue our inquiries in the village.  But first  let me ask a question.  You mentioned just now the alternative of  consulting Mr. Fairlie's legal adviser to-morrow.  Is there no  possibility of communicating with him earlier? Why not to-day?\"    \"I can only explain,\" replied Miss Halcombe, \"by entering into certain  particulars, connected with my sister's marriage-engagement, which I  did not think it necessary or desirable to mention to you this morning.  One of Sir Percival Glyde's objects in coming here on Monday, is to fix  the period of his marriage, which has hitherto been left quite  unsettled.  He is anxious that the event should take place before the  end of the year.\"    \"Does Miss Fairlie know of that wish?\" I asked eagerly.    \"She has no suspicion of it, and after what has happened, I shall not  take the responsibility upon myself of enlightening her.  Sir Percival  has only mentioned his views to Mr. Fairlie, who has told me himself  that he is ready and anxious, as Laura's guardian, to forward them.  He  has written to London, to the family solicitor, Mr. Gilmore.  Mr.  Gilmore happens to be away in Glasgow on business, and he has replied  by proposing to stop at Limmeridge House on his way back to town.  He  will arrive to-morrow, and will stay with us a few days, so as to allow  Sir Percival time to plead his own cause.  If he succeeds, Mr. Gilmore  will then return to London, taking with him his instructions for my  sister's marriage-settlement.  You understand now, Mr. Hartright, why I  speak of waiting to take legal advice until to-morrow? Mr. Gilmore is  the old and tried friend of two generations of Fairlies, and we can  trust him, as we could trust no one else.\"    The marriage-settlement! The mere hearing of those two words stung me  with a jealous despair that was poison to my higher and better  instincts.  I began to think--it is hard to confess this, but I must  suppress nothing from beginning to end of the terrible story that I now  stand committed to reveal--I began to think, with a hateful eagerness  of hope, of the vague charges against Sir Percival Glyde which the  anonymous letter contained.  What if those wild accusations rested on a  foundation of truth? What if their truth could be proved before the  fatal words of consent were spoken, and the marriage-settlement was  drawn? I have tried to think since, that the feeling which then  animated me began and ended in pure devotion to Miss Fairlie's  interests, but I have never succeeded in deceiving myself into  believing it, and I must not now attempt to deceive others.  The  feeling began and ended in reckless, vindictive, hopeless hatred of the  man who was to marry her.    \"If we are to find out anything,\" I said, speaking under the new  influence which was now directing me, \"we had better not let another  minute slip by us unemployed.  I can only suggest, once more, the  propriety of questioning the gardener a second time, and of inquiring  in the village immediately afterwards.\"    \"I think I may be of help to you in both cases,\" said Miss Halcombe,  rising.  \"Let us go, Mr. Hartright, at once, and do the best we can  together.\"    I had the door in my hand to open it for her--but I stopped, on a  sudden, to ask an important question before we set forth.    \"One of the paragraphs of the anonymous letter,\" I said, \"contains some  sentences of minute personal description.  Sir Percival Glyde's name is  not mentioned, I know--but does that description at all resemble him?\"    \"Accurately--even in stating his age to be forty-five----\"    Forty-five; and she was not yet twenty-one! Men of his age married  wives of her age every day--and experience had shown those marriages to  be often the happiest ones.  I knew that--and yet even the mention of  his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891"],[0,"Travels in West Africa: Congo Français, Corisco and Cameroons (#17)"],[1,"line of the mountain ranges which run  down the west side of the continent; ranges (apparently of very  different geological formations), which have no end of different  names, but about which little is known in detail. {80}    And now we will leave generalisations on West African rivers and go  into particulars regarding one little known in England, and called  by its owners, the French, the greatest strictly equatorial river in  the world--the Ogowe.        CHAPTER IV.  THE OGOWE.        Wherein the voyager gives extracts from the Log of the Move and of  the Eclaireur, and an account of the voyager's first meeting with  \"those fearful Fans,\" also an awful warning to all young persons who  neglect the study of the French language.    On the 20th of May I reached Gaboon, now called Libreville--the  capital of Congo Francais, and, thanks to the kindness of Mr.  Hudson, I was allowed a passage on a small steamer then running from  Gaboon to the Ogowe River, and up it when necessary as far as  navigation by steamer is possible--this steamer is, I deeply regret  to say, now no more.  As experiences of this kind contain such  miscellaneous masses of facts, I am forced to commit the literary  crime of giving you my Ogowe set of experiences in the form of  diary.    June 5th, 1895.--Off on Move at 9.30.  Passengers, Mr. Hudson, Mr.  Woods, Mr. Huyghens, Pere Steinitz, and I.  There are black deck-  passengers galore; I do not know their honourable names, but they  are evidently very much married men, for there is quite a gorgeously  coloured little crowd of ladies to see them off.  They salute me as  I pass down the pier, and start inquiries.  I say hastily to them:  \"Farewell, I'm off up river,\" for I notice Mr. Fildes bearing down  on me, and I don't want him to drop in on the subject of society  interest.  I expect it is settled now, or pretty nearly.  There is a  considerable amount of mild uproar among the black contingent, and  the Move firmly clears off before half the good advice and good  wishes for the black husbands are aboard.  She is a fine little  vessel; far finer than I expected.  The accommodation I am getting  is excellent.  A long, narrow cabin, with one bunk in it and pretty  nearly everything one can wish for, and a copying press thrown in.  Food is excellent, society charming, captain and engineer quite  acquisitions.  The saloon is square and roomy for the size of the  vessel, and most things, from rowlocks to teapots, are kept under  the seats in good nautical style.  We call at the guard-ship to pass  our papers, and then steam ahead out of the Gaboon estuary to the  south, round Pongara Point, keeping close into the land.  About  forty feet from shore there is a good free channel for vessels with  a light draught which if you do not take, you have to make a big  sweep seaward to avoid a reef.  Between four and five miles below  Pongara, we pass Point Gombi, which is fitted with a lighthouse, a  lively and conspicuous structure by day as well as night.  It is  perched on a knoll, close to the extremity of the long arm of low,  sandy ground, and is painted black and white, in horizontal bands,  which, in conjunction with its general figure, give it a pagoda-like  appearance.    Alongside it are a white-painted, red-roofed house for the  lighthouse keeper, and a store for its oil.  The light is either a  flashing or a revolving or a stationary one, when it is alight.  One  must be accurate about these things, and my knowledge regarding it  is from information received, and amounts to the above.  I cannot  throw in any personal experience, because I have never passed it at  night-time, and seen from Glass it seems just steady.  Most  lighthouses on this Coast give up fancy tricks, like flashing or  revolving, pretty soon after they are established.  Seventy-five per  cent. of them are not alight half the time at all.  \"It's the  climate.\"  Gombi, however, you may depend on for being alight at  night, and I have no hesitation in saying you can see it, when it is  visible, seventeen miles out to sea, and that the knoll on which the  lighthouse stands is a grass-covered sand cliff, about forty or  fifty feet above sea-level.  As we pass round Gombi point, the  weather becomes distinctly rough, particularly at lunch-time.  The  Move minds it less than her passengers, and stamps steadily along  past the wooded shore, behind which shows a distant range of blue  hills.  Silence falls upon the black passengers, who assume  recumbent positions on the deck, and suffer.  All the things from  under the saloon seats come out and dance together, and play puss-  in-the-corner, after the fashion of loose gear when there is any sea  on.  As the night comes down, the scene becomes more and more  picturesque.  The moonlit sea, shimmering and breaking on the  darkened shore, the black forest and the hills silhouetted against  the star-powdered purple sky, and, at my feet, the engine-room  stoke-hole, lit with the rose-coloured glow from its furnace,  showing by the great wood fire the two nearly naked Krumen stokers,  shining like polished bronze in their perspiration, as they throw in  on to the fire the billets of red wood that look like freshly-cut  chunks of flesh.  The white engineer hovers round the mouth of the  pit, shouting down directions and ever and anon plunging down the  little iron ladder to carry them out himself.  At intervals he  stands on the rail with his head craned round the edge of the sun  deck to listen to the captain, who is up on the little deck above,  for there is no telegraph to the engines, and our gallant  commander's voice is not strong.  While the white engineer is  roosting on the rail, the black engineer comes partially up the  ladder and gazes hard at me; so I give him a wad of tobacco, and he  plainly regards me as inspired, for of course that was what he  wanted.  Remember that whenever you see a man, black or white,  filled with a nameless longing, it is tobacco he requires.  Grim  despair accompanied by a gusty temper indicates something wrong with  his pipe, in which case offer him a straightened-out hairpin.  The  black engineer having got his tobacco, goes below to the stoke-hole  again and smokes a short clay as black and as strong as himself.  The captain affects an immense churchwarden.  How he gets through  life, waving it about as he does, without smashing it every two  minutes, I cannot make out.    At last we anchor for the night just inside Nazareth Bay, for  Nazareth Bay wants daylight to deal with, being rich in low islands  and sand shoals.  We crossed the Equator this afternoon.    June 6th.--Off at daybreak into Nazareth Bay.  Anxiety displayed by  navigators, sounding taken on both sides of the bows with long  bamboo poles painted in stripes, and we go \"slow ahead\" and \"hard  astern\" successfully, until we get round a good-sized island, and  there we stick until four o'clock, high water, when we come off all  right, and steam triumphantly but cautiously into the Ogowe.  The  shores of Nazareth Bay are fringed with mangroves, but once in the  river the scenery soon changes, and the waters are walled on either  side with a forest rich in bamboo, oil and wine-palms.  These forest  cliffs seem to rise right up out of the mirror-like brown water.  Many of the highest trees are covered with clusters of brown-pink  young shoots that look like flowers, and others are decorated by my  old enemy the climbing palm, now bearing clusters of bright crimson  berries.  Climbing plants of other kinds are wreathing everything,  some blossoming with mauve, some with yellow, some with white  flowers, and every now and then a soft sweet heavy breath of  fragrance comes out to us as we pass by.  There is a native village  on the north bank, embowered along its plantations with some very  tall cocoa-palms rising high above them.    The river winds so that it seems to close in behind us, opening out  in front fresh vistas of superb forest beauty, with the great brown  river stretching away unbroken ahead like a broad road of burnished  bronze.  Astern, it has a streak of frosted silver let into it by  the Move's screw.  Just about six o'clock, we run up to the Fallaba,  the Move's predecessor in working the Ogowe, now a hulk, used as a  depot by Hatton and Cookson.  She is anchored at the entrance of a  creek that runs through to the Fernan Vaz; some say it is six hours'  run, others that it is eight hours for a canoe; all agree that there  are plenty of mosquitoes.    The Fallaba looks grimly picturesque, and about the last spot in  which a person of a nervous disposition would care to spend the  night.  One half of her deck is dedicated to fuel logs, on the other  half are plank stores for the goods, and a room for the black sub-  trader in charge of them.  I know that there must be scorpions which  come out of those logs and stroll into the living room, and goodness  only knows what one might not fancy would come up the creek or rise  out of the floating grass, or the limitless-looking forest.  I am  told she was a fine steamer in her day, but those who had charge of  her did not make allowances for the very rapid rotting action of the  Ogowe water, so her hull rusted through before her engines were a  quarter worn out; and there was nothing to be done with her then,  but put a lot of concrete in, and make her a depot, in which state  of life she is very useful, for during the height of the dry season,  the Move cannot get through the creek to supply the firm's Fernan  Vaz factories.    Subsequently I heard much of the Fallaba, which seems to have been a  celebrated, or rather notorious, vessel.  Every one declared her  engines to have been of immense power, but this I believe to have  been a mere local superstition; because in the same breath, the man  who referred to them, as if it would have been quite unnecessary for  new engines to have been made for H.M.S."]]]
