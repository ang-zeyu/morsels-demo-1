The Misses Biddell and fat Miss Hassett-Bean (the lady of  the marmoset) hinted that the cream of the yacht's social life had  risen to our table, and told me, not only what to lecture about, but  how to treat the rival cliques. My brain felt more and more like a  blotting-pad. I answered at random and longed for the meal to end  --until I remembered my lecture. Then I wished that dinner might go on  indefinitely like the tea party of the Mad Hatter. All too soon the  glory of a French menu flickered down to a dying spark of nuts and  raisins, and hardly had I cracked my first almond (was it an ill omen  that there should be a worm in it?) when a steward handed me a twisted  note from the executioner. \"The rule for conductor's dinner speech is,  rise with the raisins! Hope you won't find your lecture too hard a nut  to crack. Yours sympathetically, Corkran. Bang on the table to make  them stop gabbling. Or shall I do it for you? If you haven't by the  time I count ten, I will.\"    He did. I trust it wasn't my courage that failed. But having a raisin  in my mouth I could not on the instant respond to the lash. And as  Corkran would have said, it takes more than one swallow to make a  speech. Ruthlessly he rapped, seizing what I wished might be his dying  chance to indulge a mania for puns and thumping wood.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he bawled from his comparatively obscure  corner. \"Lord Ernest Borrow will render your last moments the most  enjoyable of the meal, by washing down your nuts and raisins with the  wine of his eloquence. Take your desserts now. We conscientious  conductors hope for ours in heaven.\"    How ardently I desired that these might indeed be the \"last moments\"  not only of my audience but of Colonel Corkran. If the next second had  brought a tidal wave or a collision I should have blessed Providence.  But I got to my feet--and nothing happened. I seemed to be in a dream,  of having shot up to a gigantic height, and having put on the wrong  clothes, or none. My hands weighed two pounds each, and ought to have  been at the butcher's. My mouth was the size of a negro minstrel's, and  so full of large bones which once had been teeth that I could not utter  a syllable. I clacked my jaws, and emitted a hacking cough which  fortunately so much resembled that of a professional lecturer that I  kept my senses. Not only did I keep them, but they seemed suddenly to  become my servants. The thought of a certain fable jumped into my head,  and I began thereupon to speak; although I had forgotten everything I  had ever read of Egyptian history.    \"It happens,\" said I, in a phonographic voice, \"that I was born in  Egypt. I played with clay gods and goddesses instead of tin soldiers. I  preferred stories of Egypt's past and present to tales of adventure. I  confess to you what I fear I didn't confess to Sir Marcus Lark. The  trouble is, I'm stuffed too full of facts about Egypt. I want you to  help me get them out, and not duplicate yours. No doubt all of you, in  travelling to the East, have packed your brains with knowledge as well  as your boxes with guide books. Why should I bore you by telling you  things that you were born knowing? A plan has occurred to me by which  your knowledge can be turned into account. As I said, I beg your help.  And permission to drink a cup of coffee would be first aid.\"    People laughed, whether at me, or with me, I was not sure; yet I felt  that I had tickled their curiosity. Coffee was going round. Corkran was  unctuously sipping his, and had not expected me to receive mine till  after the battle. But I got it in spite of him, and mapped out a  programme as I drank. Then I ceased to tremble before the confused  assemblage or bird-headed gods, cat-faced goddesses, and sacred  vultures that danced or flapped in my brain.    I no longer felt inclined to commit suicide because I could remember  nothing about Egypt except that the Delta was shaped like a lily, with  the Fayum for a bud, and the Nile for its stem: that Alexander the  Macedonian defeated Darius the Persian B. C. three hundred and  something; that ancient Egyptians loved beer, but were forbidden to eat  beans.    \"My proposal is,\" I went on, \"that before I unload any of my knowledge  upon you, I gleam some idea of what you know already. Thus I can spare  you repetitions. Any one who has anything particularly interesting to  say about Egypt, let him--or her--hold up a hand.\"    Now was the crucial moment. If no hand went up, I was lost. But hardly  were the words out of my mouth when there was a waving as if in a  wind-swept wheatfield _Place aux dames!_ I called upon Miss Hassett-Bean  to begin. She rustled silkily up, bowing to me, then directing an  acetylene glare upon Colonel Corkran's end of the room. She was, I  foresaw, about to kill two birds with one stone, to say nothing of the  marmoset, who fell off her arm into General Harlow's coffee and created  a brief diversion. As soon, however, as the monkey was rescued and  before General Harlow's shirt front was dried, the lady began to speak.    \"We all thank Lord Ernest,\" she said, looking from the colonel to the  Reverend Wyman Watts, and back again, \"for sparing us one of those  commonplace inflictions from which we've nightly suffered on board this  yacht. If we didn't know already, such school-book facts as  Christianity being introduced to Egypt by St. Mark in Nero's time, and  Moses and Plato both studying philosophy at Heliopolis, and things like  that, we wouldn't be spending our money with Sir Marcus A. Lark to see  Egypt. Never before have we been encouraged to air our views. Those of  us with political opinions have been snubbed; and we who are interested  in Woman Suffrage have been assured that we'll find nothing to please  us in the land of Veiled Women. At last I am given a chance to state  without being interrupted that Egypt was once the most enlightened  country in her treatment of women. Long before the time of the Greeks,  and even before the Shepherd Kings Mr. Watts has told us so much about,  using his Old Testament as if it were a Baedeker, the women of Ancient  Egypt had rights according to their class. Queens and princesses were  considered equal with their husbands. Women were great musicians,  playing on many instruments, especially the sistrum, sacred to the  goddess Hathor. And weren't all the best gods goddesses, when you come  to think of it? Women used to drive their own chariots, as we do our  motors, and hold salons, like the French ladies. There was Rhodopis,  for instance, who married the brother of Sappho. I wonder if Colonel  Corkran could have told you that the story of Cinderella comes from an  anecdote of Rhodopis? I hardly think that he's been able to spare  enough time from bridge to study Strabo, who was the Baedeker of Egypt  for tourists six hundred years before Christ. An eagle saw Rhodopis  bathing, and stealing one of her sandals flew with it to Memphis, where  he dropped it into the king's lap. It was so small and dainty that King  Hophra scoured Egypt for the owner, and when he found her at last,  according to Strabo, made her his queen.\"    \"If Strabo was right, she lived long before Sappho's day!\" interpolated  the colonel's voice.    \"Of course, Strabo was right. There were two of Rhodopis. Everybody  knows that. The Third Pyramid was built for the tomb of the first one,  _not_ for King Mycineris, _I_ believe. Why shouldn't a woman have a  Pyramid to herself? The Sphinx is a woman, as I will insist to my dying  day, if it were my last word! I hope Lord Ernest won't ram down our  throats any nonsense about that noble and graceful tribute to the  Mystery of Womanhood being a stupid King Harmachis, or Horemkhu. I  wouldn't believe it if I found a hundred nasty stone beards lying  buried in the sand under her chin, instead of one, which could easily  have been put there to deceive people. Probably King Harmachis had the  Sphinx altered to look like him. No wonder she shuddered at such  profanation, and shed her false beard. There you have my theory. And as  for Egypt being now the land of Veiled Women, where Suffragettes find  no sympathy, I've heard that the prophet's order for veiling has been  purposely misconstrued by tyrannical men, with their usual jealousy.  Even Mohammed himself was jealous.\"    With this Miss Hassett-Bean sat down, amid fitful applause; and at my  earnest request, Miss Enid Biddell, the prettier twin, stood bravely  up. She wished, before the subject was changed, to tell some little  things she had read about the girls of Ancient Egypt, how like they  were to girls of to-day, in all their ways, especially in--in things  concerning love. It was they who first questioned the petals of flowers  for their lovers' loyalty. How much they thought about their clothes,  too, getting their best things from foreign countries, as women did  now, from Paris! It was so funny to read how the girls of Old Egypt had  consulted palmists and fortune tellers and astrologers just as girls  did in Bond Street now; and that what 'Billikens' and 'Swasticas' and  birth-stones were to us, images of gods were to the girls of Egypt who  lived before the days of Moses! They had scarab rings with magic  inscriptions, and sacred apes for the symbol of Intelligence, and lucky  eyes of Horus, wounded by the wicked god Set, and cured by the love of  Isis. On their bracelets and necklaces they hung charms, and their  dressing-tables were covered with images of favourite gods and  goddesses. Hathor, the goddess of Love and Joy, was supposed to give  her choicest gifts to girls who wore her special colour (that green-blue  in the Temple of Edfu which Robert Hichens calls \"the colour of  love\") and to those who had her pet stones, emeralds, or turquoises.

The captain's colours were bleached by service; but the  wicket-keeper's were the newest and the bluest of the lot, and as a male  historian I shrink from saying how well they suited him.    \"Teddy Garland looks as though nothing had happened,\" was what I said at  the time, as I peered through my binocular at the padded figure with the  pink face and the gigantic gloves.    \"That's because he knows there's a chance of nothing more happening,\" was  the reply. \"I've seen him and his poor old governor up here since I saw  Dan Levy.\"    I eagerly inquired as to the upshot of the earlier interview, but Raffles  looked as though he had not heard. The Oxford captain had come out to  open the innings with a player less known to fame; the first ball of the  match hurtled down the pitch, and the Oxford captain left it severely  alone. Teddy took it charmingly, and almost with the same movement the  ball was back in the bowler's hands.    \"_He's_ all right!\" muttered Raffles with a long breath. \"So is our Mr.  Shylock, Bunny; we fixed things up in no time after all. But the worst of  it is I shall only be able to stop--\"    He broke off, mouth open as it might have been mine. A ball had been  driven hard to extra cover, and quite well fielded; another had been  taken by Teddy as competently as the first, but not returned to the  bowler. The Oxford captain had played at it, and we heard something even  in Block B.    \"How's that?\" came almost simultaneously in Teddy's ringing voice. Up  went the umpire's finger, and down came Raffles's hand upon my thigh.    \"He's caught him, Bunny!\" he cried in my ear above the Cambridge cheers.  \"The best bat on either side, and Teddy's outed him third ball!\" He  stopped to watch the defeated captain's slow return, the demonstration on  the pitch in Teddy's honour; then he touched me on the arm and dropped  his voice. \"He's forgotten all his troubles now, Bunny, if you like;  nothing's going to worry him till lunch, unless he misses a sitting  chance. And he won't, you'll see; a good start means even more behind the  sticks than in front of 'em.\"    Raffles was quite right. Another wicket fell cheaply in another way; then  came a long spell of plucky cricket, a stand not masterly but dogged and  judicious, in which many a ball outside the off-stump was allowed to pass  unmolested, and a few were unfortunate in just beating the edge of the  bat. On the tricky wicket Teddy's work was cut out for him, and  beautifully he did it. It was a treat to see his lithe form crouching  behind the bails, to rise next instant with the rising ball; his great  gloves were always in the right place, always adhesive. Once only he held  them up prematurely, and a fine ball brushed the wicket on its way for  four byes; it was his sole error all the morning. Raffles sat enchanted;  so in truth did I; but between the overs I endeavoured to obtain  particulars of his latest parley with Dan Levy, and once or twice  extracted a stray detail.    \"The old sinner has a place on the river, Bunny, though I have my  suspicions of a second establishment nearer town. But I'm to find him at  his lawful home all the next few nights, and sitting up for me till two  in the morning.\"    \"Then you're going to Gray's Inn Square this week?\"    \"I'm going there this morning for a peep at the crib; there's no time to  be lost, but on the other hand there's a devil of a lot to learn. I say,  Bunny, there's going to be another change of bowling; the fast stuff,  too, by Jove!\"    A massive youth had taken the ball at the top end, and the wicket-keeper  was retiring to a more respectful distance behind the stumps.    \"You'll let me know when it's to be?\" I whispered, but Raffles only  answered, \"I wonder Jack Studley didn't wait till there was more of a  crust on the mud pie. That tripe's no use without a fast wicket!\"    The technical slang of the modern cricket-field is ever a weariness; at  the moment it was something worse, and I resigned myself to the silent  contemplation of as wild an over as ever was bowled at Lord's. A shocking  thing to the off was sent skipping past point for four. \"Tripe!\" muttered  Raffles to himself. A very good one went over the bails and thud into  Garland's gloves like a round-shot. \"Well bowled!\" said Raffles with less  reserve. Another delivery was merely ignored, both at the wicket and at  my side, and then came a high full-pitch to leg which the batsman hit  hard but very late. It was a hit that might have smashed the pavilion  palings. But it never reached them; it stuck in Teddy's left glove  instead, and none of us knew it till we saw him staggering towards  long-leg, and tossing up the ball as he recovered balance.    \"That's the worst ball that ever took a wicket in this match!\" vowed a  reverend veteran as the din died down.    \"And the best catch!\" cried Raffles. \"Come on, Bunny; that's my _nunc  dimittis_ for the day. There would be nothing to compare with it if I  could stop to see every ball bowled, and I mustn't see another.\"    \"But why?\" I asked, as I followed Raffles into the press behind the  carriages.    \"I've already told you why,\" said he.    I got as close to him as one could in that crowd.    \"You're not thinking of doing it to-night, A.J.?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"But you'll let _me_ know?\"    \"Not if I can help it, Bunny; didn't I promise not to drag you any  further through this particular mire?\"    \"But if _I_ can help _you_?\" I whispered, after a momentary separation in  the throng.    \"Oh! if I can't get on without you,\" said Raffles, not nicely, \"I'll let  you know fast enough. But do drop the subject now; here come old Garland  and Camilla Belsize!\"    They did not see us quite so soon as we saw them, and for a moment one  felt a spy; but it was an interesting moment even to a person smarting  from a snub. The ruined man looked haggard, ill, unfit to be about, the  very embodiment of the newspaper report concerning him. But the spirit  beamed through the shrinking flesh, the poor old fellow was alight with  pride and love, exultant in spite of himself and his misfortunes. He had  seen his boy's great catch; he had heard the cheers, he would hear them  till his dying hour. Camilla Belsize had also seen and heard, but not  with the same exquisite appreciation. Cricket was a game to her, it was  not that quintessence and epitome of life it would seem to be to some of  its devotees; and real life was pressing so heavily upon her that the  trivial consolation which had banished her companion's load could not  lighten hers. So at least I thought as they approached, the man so worn  and radiant, the girl so pensive for all her glorious youth and beauty:  his was the old head bowed with sorrow, his also the simpler and the  younger heart.    \"That catch will console me for a lot,\" I heard him say quite heartily to  Raffles. But Camilla's comment was altogether perfunctory; indeed, I  wondered that so sophisticated a person did not affect some little  enthusiasm. She seemed more interested, however, in the crowd than in the  cricket. And that was usual enough.    Raffles was already saying he must go, with an explanatory murmur to Mr.  Garland, who clasped his hand with a suddenly clouded countenance. But  Miss Belsize only bowed, and scarcely took her eyes off a couple of  outwardly inferior men, who had attracted my attention through hers,  until they also passed out of the ground.    Mr. Garland was on tip-toes watching the game again with mercurial  ardour.    \"Mr. Manders will look after me,\" she said to him, \"won't you, Mr.  Manders?\" I made some suitable asseveration, and she added: \"Mr.  Garland's a member, you know, and dying to go into the Pavilion.\"    \"Only just to hear what they think of Teddy,\" the poor old boy confessed;  and when we had arranged where to meet in the interval, away he hurried  with his keen, worn face.    Miss Belsize turned to me the moment he was gone.    \"I want to speak to you, Mr. Manders,\" she said quickly but without  embarrassment. \"Where can we talk?\"    \"And watch as well?\" I suggested, thinking of the young man at his best  behind the sticks.    \"I want to speak to you first,\" she said, \"where we shan't be overheard.  It's about Mr. Raffles!\" added Miss Belsize as she met my stare.    About Raffles again! About Raffles, after all that she had learnt the  day before! I did not enjoy the prospect as I led the way past the  ivy-mantled tennis-court of those days to the practice-ground, turned for  the nonce into a tented lawn.    \"And what about Raffles?\" I asked as we struck out for ourselves across  the grass.    \"I'm afraid he's in some danger,\" replied Miss Belsize. And she stopped  in her walk and confronted me as frankly as though we had the animated  scene to ourselves.    \"Danger!\" I repeated, guiltily enough, no doubt. \"What makes you think  that, Miss Belsize?\"    My companion hesitated for the first time.    \"You won't tell him I told you, Mr. Manders?\"    \"Not if you don't want me to,\" said I, taken aback more by her manner  than by the request itself.    \"You promise me that?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Then tell me, did you notice two men who passed close to us just after  we had all met?\"    \"There are so many men to notice,\" said I to gain time.    \"But these were not the sort one expects to see here to-day.\"    \"Did they wear bowlers and short coats?\"    \"You did notice them!\"    \"Only because I saw you watching them,\" said I, recalling the  whole scene.    \"They wanted watching,\" rejoined Miss Belsize dryly. \"They followed Mr.  Raffles out of the ground!\"    \"So they did!\" I reflected aloud in my alarm.    \"They were following you both when you met us.\"    \"The dickens they were! Was that the first you saw of them?\"    \"No; the first time was over there at the nets before play began. I"]]]
