The ball came out on the  Wrykyn side, and Allardyce whipped it out to Deacon, who was playing  half with him.    \"Ball's out,\" cried the Ripton half who was taking the scrum. \"Break  up. It's out.\"    And his colleague on the left darted across to stop Trevor, who had  taken Deacon's pass, and was running through on the right.    Trevor ran splendidly. He was a three-quarter who took a lot of  stopping when he once got away. Jevons and the Ripton half met him  almost simultaneously, and each slackened his pace for the fraction of  a second, to allow the other to tackle. As they hesitated, Trevor  passed them. He had long ago learned that to go hard when you have once  started is the thing that pays.    He could see that Rand-Brown was racing up for the pass, and, as he  reached the back, he sent the ball to him, waist-high. Then the back  got to him, and he came down with a thud, with a vision, seen from the  corner of his eye, of the ball bounding forward out of the wing  three-quarter's hands into touch. Rand-Brown had bungled the pass  in the old familiar way, and lost a certain try.    The touch-judge ran up with his flag waving in the air, but the referee  had other views.    \"Knocked on inside,\" he said; \"scrum here.\"    \"Here\" was, Trevor saw with unspeakable disgust, some three yards from  the goal-line. Rand-Brown had only had to take the pass, and he must  have scored.    The Ripton forwards were beginning to find their feet better now, and  they carried the scrum. A truculent-looking warrior in one of those  ear-guards which are tied on by strings underneath the chin, and which  add fifty per cent to the ferocity of a forward's appearance, broke  away with the ball at his feet, and swept down the field with the rest  of the pack at his heels. Trevor arrived too late to pull up the rush,  which had gone straight down the right touch-line, and it was not till  Strachan fell on the ball on the Wrykyn twenty-five line that the  danger ceased to threaten.    Even now the school were in a bad way. The enemy were pressing keenly,  and a real piece of combination among their three-quarters would only  too probably end in a try. Fortunately for them, Allardyce and Deacon  were a better pair of halves than the couple they were marking. Also,  the Ripton forwards heeled slowly, and Allardyce had generally got his  man safely buried in the mud before he could pass.    He was just getting round for the tenth time to bottle his opponent as  before, when he slipped. When the ball came out he was on all fours,  and the Ripton exponent, finding to his great satisfaction that he  had not been tackled, whipped the ball out on the left, where a wing  three-quarter hovered.    This was the man Rand-Brown was supposed to be marking, and once again  did Barry's substitute prove of what stuff his tackling powers were  made. After his customary moment of hesitation, he had at the  Riptonian's neck. The Riptonian handed him off in a manner that  recalled the palmy days of the old Prize Ring--handing off was always  slightly vigorous in the Ripton _v._ Wrykyn match--and dashed over  the line in the extreme corner.    There was anguish on the two touch-lines. Trevor looked savage, but  made no comment. The team lined up in silence.    It takes a very good kick to convert a try from the touch-line. Jevons'  kick was a long one, but it fell short. Ripton led by a try to nothing.    A few more scrums near the halfway line, and a fine attempt at a  dropped goal by the Ripton back, and it was half-time, with the score  unaltered.    During the interval there were lemons. An excellent thing is your lemon  at half-time. It cools the mouth, quenches the thirst, stimulates the  desire to be at them again, and improves the play.    Possibly the Wrykyn team had been happier in their choice of lemons on  this occasion, for no sooner had the game been restarted than Clowes  ran the whole length of the field, dodged through the three-quarters,  punted over the back's head, and scored a really brilliant try, of the  sort that Paget had been fond of scoring in the previous term. The man  on the touch-line brightened up wonderfully, and began to try and  calculate the probable score by the end of the game, on the assumption  that, as a try had been scored in the first two minutes, ten would be  scored in the first twenty, and so on.    But the calculations were based on false premises. After Strachan had  failed to convert, and the game had been resumed with the score at one  try all, play settled down in the centre, and neither side could pierce  the other's defence. Once Jevons got off for Ripton, but Trevor brought  him down safely, and once Rand-Brown let his man through, as before,  but Strachan was there to meet him, and the effort came to nothing. For  Wrykyn, no one did much except tackle. The forwards were beaten by the  heavier pack, and seldom let the ball out. Allardyce intercepted a pass  when about ten minutes of play remained, and ran through to the back.  But the back, who was a capable man and in his third season in the  team, laid him low scientifically before he could reach the line.    Altogether it looked as if the match were going to end in a draw. The  Wrykyn defence, with the exception of Rand-Brown, was too good to be  penetrated, while the Ripton forwards, by always getting the ball in  the scrums, kept them from attacking. It was about five minutes from  the end of the game when the Ripton right centre-three-quarter, in  trying to punt across to the wing, miskicked and sent the ball straight  into the hands of Trevor's colleague in the centre. Before his man  could get round to him he had slipped through, with Trevor backing him  up. The back, as a good back should, seeing two men coming at him, went  for the man with the ball. But by the time he had brought him down, the  ball was no longer where it had originally been. Trevor had got it, and  was running in between the posts.    This time Strachan put on the extra two points without difficulty.    Ripton played their hardest for the remaining minutes, but without  result. The game ended with Wrykyn a goal ahead--a goal and a try to a  try. For the second time in one season the Ripton match had ended in a  victory--a thing it was very rarely in the habit of doing.           *       *       *       *       *    The senior day-room at Seymour's rejoiced considerably that night. The  air was dark with flying cushions, and darker still, occasionally, when  the usual humorist turned the gas out. Milton was out, for he had gone  to the dinner which followed the Ripton match, and the man in command  of the house in his absence was Mill. And the senior day-room had no  respect whatever for Mill.    Barry joined in the revels as well as his ankle would let him, but he  was not feeling happy. The disappointment of being out of the first  still weighed on him.    At about eight, when things were beginning to grow really lively, and  the noise seemed likely to crack the window at any moment, the door was  flung open and Milton stalked in.    \"What's all this row?\" he inquired. \"Stop it at once.\"    As a matter of fact, the row _had_ stopped--directly he came in.    \"Is Barry here?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" said that youth.    \"Congratulate you on your first, Barry. We've just had a meeting and  given you your colours. Trevor told me to tell you.\"          XVII    THE WATCHERS IN THE VAULT      For the next three seconds you could have heard a cannonball drop. And  that was equivalent, in the senior day-room at Seymour's, to a dead  silence. Barry stood in the middle of the room leaning on the stick on  which he supported life, now that his ankle had been injured, and  turned red and white in regular rotation, as the magnificence of the  news came home to him.    Then the small voice of Linton was heard.    \"That'll be six d. I'll trouble you for, young Sammy,\" said Linton. For  he had betted an even sixpence with Master Samuel Menzies that Barry  would get his first fifteen cap this term, and Barry had got it.    A great shout went up from every corner of the room. Barry was one of  the most popular members of the house, and every one had been sorry for  him when his sprained ankle had apparently put him out of the running  for the last cap.    \"Good old Barry,\" said Drummond, delightedly. Barry thanked him in a  dazed way.    Every one crowded in to shake his hand. Barry thanked then all in a  dazed way.    And then the senior day-room, in spite of the fact that Milton had  returned, gave itself up to celebrating the occasion with one of the  most deafening uproars that had ever been heard even in that factory of  noise. A babel of voices discussed the match of the afternoon, each  trying to outshout the other. In one corner Linton was beating wildly  on a biscuit-tin with part of a broken chair. Shoeblossom was busy in  the opposite corner executing an intricate step-dance on somebody  else's box. M'Todd had got hold of the red-hot poker, and was burning  his initials in huge letters on the seat of a chair. Every one, in  short, was enjoying himself, and it was not until an advanced hour that  comparative quiet was restored. It was a great evening for Barry, the  best he had ever experienced.    Clowes did not learn the news till he saw it on the notice-board, on  the following Monday. When he saw it he whistled softly.    \"I see you've given Barry his first,\" he said to Trevor, when they met.  \"Rather sensational.\"    \"Milton and Allardyce both thought he deserved it. If he'd been playing  instead of Rand-Brown, they wouldn't have scored at all probably, and  we should have got one more try.\"    \"That's all right,\" said Clowes. \"He deserves it right enough, and I'm  jolly glad you've given it him. But things will begin to move now,  don't you think? The League ought to have a word to say about the  business. It'll be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6886"],[0,"First Footsteps in East Africa (#17)"],[1,"uthor, in his  treatise on the use of coffee, quotes the following from the writings of  Fakr ood Deen Mekki:--'It is said that the first who introduced coffee was  the illustrious saint Aboo Abdallah Mahomed Dhabhani ibn Said; but we have  learned by the testimony of many persons that the use of coffee in Yemen,  its origin, and first introduction into that country are due to the  learned All Shadeli ibn Omar, one of the disciples of the learned doctor  Nasr ood Deen, who is regarded as one of the chiefs among the order  Shadeli, and whose worth attests the high degree of spirituality to which  they had attained. Previous to that time they made coffee of the vegetable  substance called Cafta, which is the same as the leaf known under the name  of Kat, and not of Boon (the coffee berry) nor any preparation of Boon.  The use of this beverage extended in course of time as far as Aden, but in  the days of Mahomed Dhabhani the vegetable substance from which it was  prepared disappeared from Aden. Then it was that the Sheik advised those  who had become his disciples to try the drink made from the Boon, which  was found to produce the same effect as the Kat, inducing sleeplessness,  and that it was attended with less expense and trouble. The use of coffee  has been kept up from that time to the present.'    \"D'Herbelot states that the beverage called Calmat al Catiat or Caftah,  was prohibited in Yemen in consequence of its effects upon the brain. On  the other hand a synod of learned Mussulmans is said to have decreed that  as beverages of Kat and Cafta do not impair the health or impede the  observance of religious duties, but only increase hilarity and good-  humour, it was lawful to use them, as also the drink made from the boon or  coffee-berry. I am not aware that Kat is used in Aden in any other way  than for mastication. From what I have heard, however, I believe that a  decoction resembling tea is made from the leaf by the Arabs in the  interior; and one who is well acquainted with our familiar beverage  assures me that the effects are not unlike those produced by strong green  tea, with this advantage in favour of Kat, that the excitement is always  of a pleasing and agreeable kind. [Note: \"Mr. Vaughan has transmitted two  specimens called Tubbare Kat and Muktaree Kat, from the districts in which  they are produced: the latter fetches the lower price. Catha edulis  _Forsk._, Nat. Ord. Celastraceae, is figured in Dr. Lindley's Vegetable  Kingdom, p. 588. (London, 1846). But there is a still more complete  representation of the plant under the name of Catha Forskalii _Richard_,  in a work published under the auspices of the French government, entitled,  'Voyage en Abyssinie execute pendant les annees 1839-43, par une  commission scientifique composee de MM. Theophile Lefebvre, Lieut. du  Vaisseau, A. Petit et Martin-Dillon, docteurs medecins, naturalistes du  Museum, Vignaud dessinateur.' The botanical portion of this work, by M.  Achille Richard, is regarded either as a distinct publication under the  title of Tentamen Florae Abyssinicae, or as a part of the Voyage en  Abyssinie. M. Richard enters into some of the particulars relative to the  synonyms of the plant, from which it appears that Vahl referred Forskal's  genus Catha to the Linnaean genus Celastrus, changing the name of Catha  edulis to Celastrus edulis. Hochstetter applied the name of Celastrus  edulis to an Abyssinian species (Celastrus obscurus _Richard_), which he  imagined identical with Forskal's Catha edulis, while of the real Catha  edulis _Forsk._, he formed a new genus and species, under the name of  Trigonotheca serrata _Hochs_. Nat. Ord. Hippocrateaceae. I quote the  following references from the Tentamen Florae Abyssinicae, vol. i. p. 134.:  'Catha Forskalii _Nob._ Catha No. 4. Forsk. loc. cit, (Flor. AEgypt. Arab.  p. 63.) Trigonotheca serrata _Hochs._ in pl. Schimp. Abyss. sect. ii, No.  649. Celastrus edulis _Vahl, Ecl._ 1. 21.' Although In the Flora  AEgyptiaco-Arabica of Forskal no specific name is applied to the Catha at  p. 63, it is enumerated as Catha edulis at p. 107. The reference to  Celastrus edulis is not contained in the Eclogae Americanae of Vahl, but in  the author's Symbolae Botanicae (Hanulae, 1790, fol.) pars i. p. 21. (Daniel  Hanbury signed.)]    [19] This is probably the \"River of Zayla,\" alluded to by Ibn Said and  others. Like all similar features in the low country, it is a mere surface  drain.    [20] In the upper country I found a large variety growing wild in the  Fiumaras. The Bedouins named it Buamado, but ignored its virtues.    [21] This ornament is called Musbgur.    [22] A large brown bird with black legs, not unlike the domestic fowl. The  Arabs call it Dijajat el Barr, (the wild hen): the Somal \"digarin,\" a word  also applied to the Guinea fowl, which it resembles in its short strong  fight and habit of running. Owing to the Bedouin prejudice against eating  birds, it is found in large coveys all over the country.    [23] It has been described by Salt and others. The Somal call it Sagaro,  the Arabs Ghezalah: it is found throughout the land generally in pairs,  and is fond of ravines under the hills, beds of torrents, and patches of  desert vegetation. It is easily killed by a single pellet of shot striking  the neck. The Somal catch it by a loop of strong twine hung round a gap in  a circuit of thorn hedge, or they run it down on foot, an operation  requiring half a day on account of its fleetness, which enables it to  escape the jackal and wild dog. When caught it utters piercing cries. Some  Bedouins do not eat the flesh: generally, however, it is considered a  delicacy, and the skulls and bones of these little animals lie strewed  around the kraals.    [24] The Somal hold the destruction of the \"Tuka\" next in religious merit  to that of the snake. They have a tradition that the crow, originally  white, became black for his sins. When the Prophet and Abubekr were  concealed in the cave, the pigeon hid there from their pursuers: the crow,  on the contrary, sat screaming \"ghar! ghar!\" (the cave! the cave!) upon  which Mohammed ordered him into eternal mourning, and ever to repeat the  traitorous words.    There are several species of crows in this part of Africa. Besides the  large-beaked bird of the Harar Hills, I found the common European variety,  with, however, the breast feathers white tipped in small semicircles as  far as the abdomen. The little \"king-crow\" of India is common: its bright  red eye and purplish plume render it a conspicuous object as it perches  upon the tall camel's back or clings to waving plants.    [25] The Waraba or Durwa is, according to Mr. Blyth, the distinguished  naturalist, now Curator of the Asiatic Society's Museum at Calcutta, the  Canis pictus seu venaticus (Lycaon pictus or Wilde Honde of the Cape  Boers). It seems to be the Chien Sauvage or Cynhyene (Cynhyaena venatica)  of the French traveller M. Delegorgue, who in his \"Voyage dans l'Afrique  Australe,\" minutely and diffusely describes it. Mr. Gordon Cumming  supposes it to form the connecting link between the wolf and the hyaena.  This animal swarms throughout the Somali country, prowls about the camps  all night, dogs travellers, and devours every thing he can find, at times  pulling down children and camels, and when violently pressed by hunger,  men. The Somal declare the Waraba to be a hermaphrodite; so the ancients  supposed the hyaena to be of both sexes, an error arising from the peculiar  appearance of an orifice situated near two glands which secrete an  unctuous fluid.    [26] Men wear for ornament round the neck a bright red leather thong, upon  which are strung in front two square bits of true or imitation amber or  honey stone: this \"Mekkawi,\" however, is seldom seen amongst the Bedouins.  The Audulli or woman's necklace is a more elaborate affair of amber, glass  beads, generally coloured, and coral: every matron who can afford it,  possesses at least one of these ornaments. Both sexes carry round the  necks or hang above the right elbow, a talisman against danger and  disease, either in a silver box or more generally sewn up in a small case  of red morocco. The Bedouins are fond of attaching a tooth-stick to the  neck thong.    [27] Beads are useful in the Somali country as presents, and to pay for  trifling purchases: like tobacco they serve for small change. The kind  preferred by women and children is the \"binnur,\" large and small white  porcelain: the others are the red, white, green, and spotted twisted  beads, round and oblong. Before entering a district the traveller should  ascertain what may be the especial variety. Some kind are greedily sought  for in one place, and in another rejected with disdain.    [28] The Somali word \"Fal\" properly means \"to do;\" \"to bewitch,\" is its  secondary sense.    [29] The price of blood in the Somali country is the highest sanctioned by  El Islam. It must be remembered that amongst the pagan Arabs, the Korayah  \"diyat,\" was twenty she-camels. Abd el Muttaleb, grandfather of Mohammed,  sacrificed 100 animals to ransom the life of his son, forfeited by a rash  vow, and from that time the greater became the legal number. The Somal  usually demand 100 she-camels, or 300 sheep and a few cows; here, as in  Arabia, the sum is made up by all the near relations of the slayer; 30 of  the animals may be aged, and 30 under age, but the rest must be sound and  good. Many tribes take less,--from strangers 100 sheep, a cow, and a  camel;--but after the equivalent is paid, the murderer or one of his clan,  contrary to the spirit of El Islam, is generally killed by the kindred or  tribe of the slain. When blood is shed in the same tribe, the full  reparation, if accepted by the relatives, is always exacted; this serves  the purpose of preventing fratricidal strife, for in such a nation of  murderers, only the Diyat prevents the taking of life.
