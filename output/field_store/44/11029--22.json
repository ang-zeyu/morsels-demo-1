[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4748"],[0,"Baree, Son of Kazan (#17)"],[1,"were at work, clashing and readjusting,  impinging on him a new intelligence--the beginning of a new  understanding. A swift and savage impulse had made him leap at Bush  McTaggart when the factor put his hand on the Willow's head. It was not  reason. It was a hearkening back of the dog to that day long ago when  Kazan, his father, had lulled the man-brute in the tent, the man-brute  who had dared to molest Thorpe's wife, whom Kazan worshiped. Then it  had been the dog--and the woman.    And here again it was the woman. She had appealed to the great hidden  passion that was in Baree and that had come to him from Kazan. Of all  the living things in the world, he knew that he must not hurt this  creature that appeared to him through the door. He trembled as she  knelt before him again, and up through the years came the wild and  glorious surge of Kazan's blood, overwhelming the wolf, submerging the  savagery of his birth--and with his head flat on the floor he whined  softly, and WAGGED HIS TAIL.    Nepeese gave a cry of joy.    \"Baree!\" she whispered, taking his head in her hands. \"Baree!\"    Her touch thrilled him. It sent little throbs through his body, a  tremulous quivering which she could feel and which deepened the glow in  her eyes. Gently her hand stroked his head and his back. It seemed to  Nepeese that he did not breathe. Under the caress of her hand his eyes  closed. In another moment she was talking to him, and at the sound of  her voice his eyes shot open.    \"He will come here--that beast--and he will kill us,\" she was saying.  \"He will kill you because you bit him, Baree. Ugh, I wish you were  bigger, and stronger, so that you could take off his head for me!\"    She was untying the babiche from about the table leg, and under her  breath she laughed. She was not frightened. It was a tremendous  adventure--and she throbbed with exultation at the thought of having  beaten the man-beast in her own way. She could see him in the pool  struggling and beating about like a great fish. He was just about  crawling out of the chasm now--and she laughed again as she caught  Baree up under her arm.    \"Oh--oopi-nao--but you are heavy!\" she gasped, \"And yet I must carry  you--because I am going to run!\"    She hurried outside. Pierrot had not come, and she darted swiftly into  the balsams back of the cabin, with Baree hung in the crook of her arm,  like a sack filled at both ends and tied in the middle. He felt like  that, too. But he still had no inclination to wriggle himself free.  Nepeese ran with him until her arm ached. Then she stopped and put him  down on his feet, holding to the end of the caribou-skin thong that was  tied about his neck. She was prepared for any lunge he might make to  escape. She expected that he would make an attempt, and for a few  moments she watched him closely, while Baree, with his feet on earth  once more, looked about him. And then the Willow spoke to him softly.    \"You are not going to run away, Baree. Non, you are going to stay with  me, and we will kill that man-beast if he dares do to me again what he  did back there.\" She flung back the loose hair from about her flushed  face, and for a moment she forgot Baree as she thought of that  half-minute at the edge of the chasm. He was looking straight up at her  when her glance fell on him again. \"Non, you are not going to run  away--you are going to follow me,\" she whispered. \"Come.\"    The babiche string tightened about Baree's neck as she urged him to  follow. It was like another rabbit snare, and he braced his forefeet  and bared his fangs just a little. The Willow did not pull. Fearlessly  she put her hand on his head again. From the direction of the cabin  came a shout, and at the sound of it she took Baree up under her arm  once more.    \"Bete noir--bete noir!\" she called back tauntingly, but only loud  enough to be heard a few yards away. \"Go back to Lac Bain--owases--you  wild beast!\"    Nepeese began to make her way swiftly through the forest. It grew  deeper and darker, and there were no trails. Three times in the next  half-hour she stopped to put Baree down and rest her arm. Each time she  pleaded with him coaxingly to follow her. The second and third times  Baree wriggled and wagged his tail, but beyond those demonstrations of  his satisfaction with the turn his affairs had taken he would not go.  When the string tightened around his neck, he braced himself; once he  growled--again he snapped viciously at the babiche. So Nepeese  continued to carry him.    They came at last into a clearing. It was a tiny meadow in the heart of  the forest, not more than three or four times as big as the cabin.  Underfoot the grass was soft and green, and thickly strewn with  flowers. Straight through the heart of this little oasis trickled a  streamlet across which the Willow jumped with Baree under her arm, and  on the edge of the rill was a small wigwam made of freshly cut spruce  and balsam boughs. Into her diminutive mekewap the Willow thrust her  head to see that things were as she had left them yesterday. Then, with  a long breath of relief, she put down her four-legged burden and  fastened the end of the babiche to one of the cut spruce limbs.    Baree burrowed himself back into the wall of the wigwam, and with head  alert--and eyes wide open--watched his companion attentively. Not a  movement of the Willow escaped him. She was radiant--and happy. Her  laugh, sweet and wild as a bird's trill, set Baree's heart throbbing  with a desire to jump about with her among the flowers.    For a time Nepeese seemed to forget Baree. Her wild blood raced with  the joy of her triumph over the factor from Lac Bain. She saw him  again, floundering about in the pool--pictured him at the cabin now,  soaked and angry, demanding of mon pere where she had gone. And mon  pere, with a shrug of his shoulders, was telling him that he didn't  know--that probably she had run off into the forest. It did not enter  into her head that in tricking Bush McTaggart in that way she was  playing with dynamite. She did not foresee the peril that in an instant  would have stamped the wild flush from her face and curdled the blood  in her veins--she did not guess that McTaggart had become for her a  deadlier menace than ever.    Nepeese knew that he must be angry. But what had she to fear? Mon pere  would be angry, too, if she told him what had happened at the edge of  the chasm. But she would not tell him. He might kill the man from Lac  Bain. A factor was great. But Pierrot, her father, was greater. It was  an unlimited faith in her, born of her mother. Perhaps even now Pierrot  was sending him back to Lac Bain, telling him that his business was  there. But she would not return to the cabin to see. She would wait  here. Mon pere would understand--and he knew where to find her when the  man was gone. But it would have been such fun to throw sticks at him as  he went!    After a little Nepeese returned to Baree. She brought him water and  gave him a piece of raw fish. For hours they were alone, and with each  hour there grew stronger in Baree the desire to follow the girl in  every movement she made, to crawl close to her when she sat down, to  feel the touch of her dress, of her hand--and to hear her voice. But he  did not show this desire. He was still a little savage of the  forests--a four-footed barbarian born half of a wolf and half of a dog;  and he lay still. With Umisk he would have played. With Oohoomisew he  would have fought. At Bush McTaggart he would have bared his fangs, and  buried them deep when the chance came. But the girl was different. Like  the Kazan of old, he had begun to worship. If the Willow had freed  Baree, he would not have run away. If she had left him, he would  possibly have followed her--at a distance. His eyes were never away  from her. He watched her build a small fire and cook a piece of the  fish. He watched her eat her dinner.    It was quite late in the afternoon when she came and sat down close to  him, with her lap full of flowers which she twined in the long, shining  braids of her hair. Then, playfully, she began beating Baree with the  end of one of these braids. He shrank under the soft blows, and with  that low, birdlike laughter in her throat, Nepeese drew his head into  her lap where the scatter of flowers lay. She talked to him. Her hand  stroked his head. Then it remained still, so near that he wanted to  thrust out his warm red tongue and caress it. He breathed in the  flower-scented perfume of it--and lay as if dead. It was a glorious  moment. Nepeese, looking down on him, could not see that he was  breathing.    There came an interruption. It was the snapping of a dry stick. Through  the forest Pierrot had come with the stealth of a cat, and when they  looked up, he stood at the edge of the open. Baree knew that it was not  Bush McTaggart. But it was a man-beast! Instantly his body stiffened  under the Willow's hand. He drew back slowly and cautiously from her  lap, and as Pierrot advanced, Baree snarled. The next instant Nepeese  had risen and had run to Pierrot. The look in her father's face alarmed  her.    \"What has happened, mon pere?\" she cried.    Pierrot shrugged his shoulders.    \"Nothing, ma Nepeese--except that you have roused a thousand devils in  the heart of the factor from Lac Barn, and that--\"    He stopped as he saw Baree, and pointed at him.    \"Last night when M'sieu the Factor caught him in a snare, he bit  m'sieu's hand. M'sieu's hand is swollen twice its size, and I can see  his blood turning black. It is pechipoo.\"    \"Pechipoo!\" gasped Nepeese.    She looked into Pierrot's eyes. They were dark, and filled with a  sinister gleam--a flash of exultation, she thought.    \"Yes, it is the blood poison,\" said Pierrot. A gleam of cunning shot  into his eyes as he looked over his shoulder, and nodded. \"I have  hidden the medicine--and told him there is no time to lose in getting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47519"],[0,"President Heber C. Kimball's Journal (#17)"],[1," present who did not belong to the Church. After the  meeting was dismissed three persons went forward and were baptized and  confirmed.    On the 10th of July, Elder P. P. Pratt returned from his imprisonment  in Missouri. When I heard that he was in Quincy I went there and  assisted him and his brother Orson up to Commerce. His escape caused  much rejoicing among the Saints.    In a few days afterwards he and I purchased from Hyrum Kimball five  acres each of woodland, situated one mile from the river, and went to  work to cut each a set of logs to build a house 14 by 16 feet, which  we cut in one day. We then invited some of the old citizens, such as  Brother Bozier, 'Squire Wells, Louis Robinson and others, to come and  assist us to put them up, as our people were mostly prostrate with  sickness. I got a man to assist me to hew puncheons for the floor,  and to make some shakes, that is, strips of timber similar to barrel  staves, with which to cover the roof. I also drew the rock and built  a chimney, and just got it built to the ridge of the house, when I  was stricken down with the chills and fever. My wife was also laid  prostrate with the same.    A great amount of sickness prevailed among the inhabitants of Commerce,  in consequence of the sufferings and hardships to which they had been  subjected in being driven from Missouri; so that the time of those  who were able to be about was generally spent in administering to the  sick. Some had faith and were healed; to those who had not faith we  administered mild herbs and nursed them as well as possible under the  circumstances; but many died.    On the morning of the 22nd, the Prophet Joseph Smith arose from his  bed of sickness, when the power of God rested upon him, and he went  forth administering to the sick. He commenced with the sick in his  own house, then visited those who were tenting in his door-yard,  commanding the sick in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to arise from  their beds and be made whole, and they were healed according to his  words. He then went from house to house and from tent to tent, on the  bank of the river, healing the sick by the power of Israel's God as he  went among them. He did not miss a single house, wagon or tent, and  continued this work up to the \"Upper Stone House,\" where he crossed  the river, accompanied by P. P. Pratt, O. Pratt, John Taylor, John E.  Page and myself, and walked into the cabin of Brother Brigham Young,  who was lying very sick, and commanded him in the name of the Lord  Jesus to arise and be made whole. He arose, healed of his sickness,  and accompanied Joseph and his brethren of the Twelve. They went into  the house of Brother Elijah Fordham, who was insensible and considered  by his family and friends to be dying. Joseph stepped to his bedside,  looked him in the eye for a minute without speaking, then took him by  the hand and commanded him in the name of Jesus Christ to arise from  his bed and walk. Brother Fordham instantly leaped out of his bed,  threw off all his poultices and bandages, dressed himself, called for  a bowl of bread and milk, which he ate, and then followed us into the  street.    We then went into the house of Joseph B. Noble, who was also very sick,  and he was healed in the same manner.    Joseph spoke with the voice and power of God.    When he had healed all the sick by the power given unto him, he went  down to the ferry boat, when a stranger rode up almost breathless and  said he had heard that \"Jo\" Smith was raising the dead and healing all  the sick, and his wife begged of him to ride up and get Mr. Smith to  go down and heal his twin children, who were about five months old.  Joseph replied, \"I cannot go, but will send some one.\" In a few minutes  he said to Elder Woodruff, who lived in Montrose, \"You go and heal  those children. Take this pocket handkerchief, and when you administer  to them, wipe their faces with it, and they shall recover.\" Brother  Woodruff did as he was commanded, and the children were healed.    The mob leaders when they saw men, whom they thought were dying, arise  from their beds and pray for others, stood paralyzed with fear, yet  those same men would have killed Joseph and his brethren if they had  had an opportunity.    Joseph recrossed the river and returned to his own house, and I went to  my home, rejoicing in the mercies and goodness of God.    This was a day never to be forgotten by the Saints, nor by the wicked,  for they saw the power of God manifest in the flesh.        CHAPTER XV.    START UPON A MISSION UNDER DISTRESSING CIRCUMSTANCES--INCIDENTS OF THE  JOURNEY--A DRUNKEN DOCTOR GIVES ME A TABLE-SPOONFUL OF MORPHINE--MY  LIFE SAVED THROUGH THE PRAYER OF FAITH--BRETHREN LEAVE ME TO PROCEED TO  KIRTLAND--THEIR FEAR THAT I WOULD DIE--I PREDICT THAT I WOULD RECOVER  AND REACH KIRTLAND BEFORE THEM.    On the 4th of August, the Saints met to partake of the sacrament, and  received an exhortation from the Prophet, impressing upon them the  necessity of being righteous and clean of heart before the Lord, and  commanding the Twelve to go forth without purse or scrip; according to  the revelations of Jesus Christ.    My son David Patten was born during the night of the 23d in the log  cabin which I had put up at the end of the Bozier house, and during the  night we had a heavy thunder storm, but the hand of the Lord was over  us.    As soon as my wife was able, I moved my family into the log house that  I had built. Being without a house, Brother Orson Pratt moved his  family in with mine.    On the 4th of September, President Brigham Young left his home at  Montrose to start upon his mission to England. He was so sick that  he was unable to go to the river, a distance of thirty rods, without  assistance. After he had crossed the river, he rode behind Israel  Barlow on his horse to my house, where he continued sick until the  18th. He left his wife sick with a babe only ten days old, and all his  other children were sick and unable to wait upon one another. Not one  of them was able to go to the well for a pail of water, and they were  without a single change of clothes, for the mob in Missouri had taken  nearly all he had.    On the 17th, Sister Mary Ann Young got a boy to carry her up in his  wagon to my house, that she might nurse and comfort Brother Brigham to  the hour of starting.    On the 18th, Charles Hubbard sent a boy with a wagon and span of horses  to my house to start us on our journey. Our trunks were put into the  wagon by some of the brethren who had come to bid us farewell.    I went to my bed and shook hands with my wife, who was then shaking  with the ague, and had two of our children lying sick by her side. I  embraced her and my children, and bade them farewell. The only child  well was little Heber Parley, and it was with difficulty that he could  carry a couple of quarts of water at a time, to assist in quenching  their thirst.    With some difficulty we got into the wagon and started down the hill  about ten rods. It seemed to me as though my very inmost parts would  melt within me at the thought of leaving my family in such a condition,  as it were almost in the arms of death. I felt as though I could  scarcely endure it. I said to the teamster \"hold up!\" then turning to  Brother Brigham I added, \"This is pretty tough, but let's rise, and  give them a cheer.\" We arose, and swinging our hats three times over  our heads, we cried, \"Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for Israel!\"    My wife, hearing the noise, arose from her bed and came to the door to  see what was up. She had a smile on her face. She and Sister Young then  cried out to us, \"Good bye; God bless you!\" We returned the compliment,  and were pleased to see that they were so cheerful. We then told the  driver to go ahead.    After this I felt a spirit of joy and gratitude at having the  satisfaction of seeing my wife standing upon her feet, instead of  leaving her in bed, knowing well that I should not see her again for  two or three years.    We were without purse or scrip, and were carried across the prairie,  about fourteen miles, to a shanty near the railway, where Brother O. M.  Duell lived.    On arriving there, we were unable to carry our small trunks into the  house, and Sister Duell, seeing our feeble condition, assisted the boy  to carry them in. We were very much fatigued, and as soon as we got  into the house Sister Duell made us a cup of tea; which revived us,  and prepared a bed for us on a one-legged bedstead in a corner of the  house, having two poles running from the house logs to the leg.    In the course of the night our bedstead broke through, and we found  ourselves on the floor, between the poles and the side of the house.    The following day Brother Duell took us in his wagon to Lima, about  twelve miles, when he left us. He gave each of us a dollar to assist us  on our journey. Brother Bidwell then carried us in his wagon to John A.  Mikesell's, near Quincy, about twenty miles.    The fatigue of this day's journey was too much for our feeble health;  we were prostrated, and obliged to tarry a few days in Quincy to  recruit.    The brethren preached a few times in a meeting house close to the  Congregational church. The members of the latter church were in  the habit of commencing their meetings at different hours from the  brethren, but they took a notion to disturb us, by ringing their bell  furiously after we had commenced our meetings. At one time Elder John  E. Page preached so loud as to drown the noise of the bell, and this  brought some hundreds, who otherwise would not have come, to meeting.    I was prostrate with the chills and fever, and stayed most of the time  at the house of Sisters Laura and Abigail Pitkin, who bestowed every  kindness upon me they possibly could. Dr. Orlando Hovey, and Sister  Staley and her daughter were also very kind in administering to me in  my feeble condition.    We left Quincy September 25th,"]]]
