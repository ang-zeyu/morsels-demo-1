The knights had put on their armour, which they had found still lying  in the boat, the pirates, in their haste to pursue, having left her  unexamined, while those who had remained on guard had abstained from  touching anything until the return of their captain and comrades.    \"Whence come you, Sir John, and what is the news? No misfortune has  befallen Ricord's galley, I hope?\" the Spanish knight in command  shouted, as the boat came near enough for him to recognize the features  of its occupants.    \"All is well,\" Sir John shouted back; \"but we have taken more prizes  than we can manage, though not without hard fighting. Seven knights have  fallen, and at least ten others will not be able to buckle their armour  on again for some time to come, so I have been sent here to beg your  assistance; and it is well that it should be given speedily, for if more  pirate vessels come up before you join, Ricord and his companions will  be in a sorry plight.\"    By this time the boat had reached the side of the galley, and as Sir  John and his two companions stepped on board, the knights crowded  round to hear the details of the news. Exclamations of approval and  satisfaction arose when Sir John related the incidents of the fight, and  told them that the four vessels that had fallen into their hands formed  part of Hassan Ali's fleet.    \"That is good news indeed, Boswell,\" Don Santoval said; \"and I would I  had been there to take part in so gallant a fight. It is well you found  us here, for with four prizes on hand, and with half his strength dead  or disabled, Ricord must be in sore need of aid. We will start tomorrow  morning at daybreak. As all the ships were taken, there is little fear  of any of the other pirates hearing news of what has happened.\"    \"I don't know,\" Sir John replied. \"There were, as I told you, some two  hundred pirates left on the island. About half those, we know, seized a  fishing boat and escaped, for they chased us, and we have had as narrow  an escape from death as has ever fallen to my lot, though I have been  in over a score of hard fought battles. The rest may well have taken  another fishing boat and made off also, for we saw several craft along  the shores of the island. If so, they may have made for Hassan Ali's  rendezvous, wherever that may be, just as I made here, and by this time  some of his ships may be on the way there.\"    \"By St. Anthony, this alters the situation gravely!\" Don Santoval said.  \"Fellow knights, we must lose no time in going to Ricord's assistance.  The slaves have had a long row today, but they must start on another.  Let them have a good meal to strengthen them, and a cup of wine each.  Whatever their scruples at other times, they never refuse wine when  there is heavy work to be done, knowing full well that a draught of it  helps them mightily in their labours. Your men must have rowed well, Sir  John, to have brought you here so quickly?\"    \"I have promised them their freedom,\" Sir John said; \"and they shall  have it, even if I have to pay their value into the treasury. As I told  you, we were hotly pursued, for the craft with her sail went faster than  we with our oars; and, knowing the importance of bringing the news here,  I encouraged them by promising them their freedom, should we get away.  Not only did they row right manfully, but they proved faithful in our  extremity, and, when all seemed lost, stuck to us instead of deserting  and joining the pirates.\"    \"But how did you get away, Sir John, if their craft outsailed you?\"    \"I owe my life entirely to the quick wit of my young countryman, Sir  Gervaise Tresham here.\" And Sir John then related the incidents of their  adventure on the island, his narrative eliciting warm expressions of  approval from the knights.    \"Of course, you will go with us, Boswell?\" Don Santoval said, when the  master of the slaves announced that these had eaten their meal, and were  ready.    \"I must do so,\" Sir John replied. \"I want you, on your way, to look in  at that island where we had so narrow an escape, and if we find their  craft still there we can destroy it. The place is directly in our  course; we shall, therefore, lose but little time in looking in. Of  course, they may have gone as soon as they got their vessel afloat,  but it is hardly likely. They would have no idea of my returning with  a galley so soon, and will probably set to to make a dozen more oars  before they start, for she had but four on board, which will scarce  suffice to send her a mile an hour through the water. Therefore, I fancy  they will not put off until tomorrow morning. If that is so, and we  destroy their craft, they will be trapped in the islet, and on our  return we can capture them all. I think of leaving Harcourt and Tresham  in the boat, in order that when Piccolomini's galley comes in, they may  direct him also to join us.\"    \"He may be in at any moment; we met him three days since. He had  captured a pirate, and sent her off under charge of ten of his knights.  We agreed to meet him this evening; and as he is not here, he will  probably be in the first thing in the morning.\"    Gervaise and Harcourt took their places in the boat again. The galley  got up its anchor and started. Just as she reached the mouth of the  inlet another galley rounded the point and nearly ran into her.    \"I am going to Ricord's assistance, Piccolomini,\" Don Santoval shouted.    \"Is it urgent?\" the commander of the galley shouted back. \"We have had  a very long row, and can go no farther, unless his strait is a very sore  one.\"    \"No. Come on in the morning. You will hear all the news from a boat  lying two hundred yards astern. Two young English knights are waiting in  her to give you the news. Ricord has made a fine capture. Row on, men.\"  And the galley proceeded on her way, while the newcomer proceeded up the  harbour.    Harcourt and Gervaise at once went on board, and the former gave the  Italian commander an account of the battle that had taken place, and  the capture of the four pirate vessels. After the exclamations  of satisfaction by the knights had ceased, he recounted their own  adventures, which were heard with lively interest.    \"I hope indeed that Santoval will burn that fishing boat, and that we  shall capture the pirates,\" the commander said. \"We have need of  more slaves to carry out the works at Rhodes. Now, let us to supper,  gentlemen, and then to sleep. In six hours we will be off again, for if  some more of these villains have escaped and carried the news to Hassan  Ali, our swords may be sorely needed by Ricord and Santoval tomorrow.\"        CHAPTER VI KNIGHTED      At three in the morning all on board the galley were astir. A ration  of bread and meat was served out to the slaves, and the boat was soon  afterwards under way. The rowers of the English knight's boat had been  warmly commended by the commander and placed in charge of the overseer,  with instructions that they were to be treated as free men. As soon as  the galley slaves set to work, however, they seated themselves on  the benches and double banked some of the oars, anxious to please the  knights. With the exception of those whose turn it was to be on watch,  most of the knights slept until daybreak.    \"At the rate we are rowing, Gervaise,\" Harcourt said, as they went up  on to the poop together, \"it will not take us very long to join our  friends. We are going through the water at fully six miles an hour; and  as we have already been two hours under way, in another three we shall  be there.\"    An hour and a half later they passed the island where they had landed.  The two young knights pointed out to the others the valley into which  they had descended, and the point round which they had swum. In a few  minutes they caught sight of the landing place.    \"Look, Gervaise, there is something black showing just above the water.\"    \"I see it. I think it is a line of timbers. There were certainly no  rocks there when we ran ashore.\"    \"Then Santoval must have found the craft still there and burnt her,\" one  of the knights standing by remarked, \"and the pirates are caged up. It  will take them some time to make a raft that will carry them to the next  island, and before they can do that we shall be back again. I shall be  sorry if they escape, for they are as ruthless a set of villains as sail  the seas.\"    The galley had traversed half the remaining distance when the sound of  a gun was faintly heard. For a moment there was an absolute hush on the  poop; then three or four shots in rapid succession were heard.    \"Some more pirate ships must have come up,\" the commander exclaimed.  Then he shouted down to the slaves, \"Row, men--row for your lives!  Overseer, do not spare your lash if any hang back from their work.\"    The galley had been travelling fast before, but her speed greatly  increased as the slaves rowed their hardest. Fast as she was travelling,  the impatience of the knights was extreme. They walked up and down the  deck, making vows of candles that should be burnt at the shrine of St.  John if they arrived in time to take a share in the fight, stopping at  times to listen to the sound of artillery, which was now so frequent as  to show that a severe engagement was being fought. Many of the younger  knights ran down to the waist and double banked the oars, and in a  shorter time than it seemed possible the galley arrived at the mouth of  the bay.    A desperate fight was going on. Ricord's ship lay, idle and deserted,  at anchor. Five pirate crafts surrounded Santoval's galley. Two of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4940"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Senior Year at High School (#17)"],[1,"by a loud ringing of the bell. Going to  the door she beheld Anne who was fairly wriggling with excitement. Her  cheeks were flushed and her dark eyes were like stars.    \"Oh, Grace,\" she cried. \"The unexpected has happened!\"    \"What are you talking about, Anne?\" exclaimed Grace laughing. \"Stop  dancing up and down out there. Come in and explain yourself. That is if  you can stand still long enough to do it.\"    \"I have had the surprise of my life to-night, Grace,\" said Anne, as she  entered the hall, while Grace unfastened her fur collar and pulled the  pins from her hat. \"I just couldn't wait until to-morrow to tell you  about it. It's so wonderful I can't believe that it has happened to  insignificant me.\"    \"I know just as much now as I did at first, and perhaps a trifle less,\"  said Grace.    Then taking Anne by the shoulders she marched her into the sitting room,  shoved her into the easy-chair opposite her own and said, \"Now, begin at  the beginning, and don't leave out any details.\"    \"Well,\" said Anne, drawing a long breath, \"when I reached home after  leaving you, I found a letter for me postmarked New York City. For an  instant I thought it was from my father, but the hand writing was not  his. I opened it, and who do you suppose it was from?\"    \"I don't know, and I'm a poor guesser, so tell me,\" responded Grace.    \"It was from Mr. Everett Southard.\"    \"No! Really?\" cried Grace. \"How nice of him to write to you.\"    \"But I haven't told you the nicest part,\" continued Anne. \"He wants me  to go to New York to play a six-weeks' engagement in his company.\"    \"Anne Pierson, you don't mean it,\" ejaculated Grace in intense  astonishment.    \"Grace Harlowe, I do mean it,\" retorted Anne. \"Why it's the very  opportunity that I've been yearning for, but never expected to get. Let  me read you his letter.\"    Unfolding the letter that she had been holding in one hand, Anne read:         \"MY DEAR MISS PIERSON:         \"Remembering your exceptionally fine work as 'Rosalind' in the        production of 'As You Like It,' given at your High School last        year, I now write to offer you the same part in a six weeks'        revival of the same play about to be presented in New York. Your        acceptance will be a source of gratification to me, as it is very        hard to engage actors who are particularly adapted to Shakespearian        roles. The salary will be one hundred dollars per week with all        traveling expenses paid.         \"My sister extends a cordial invitation to you to make our home        yours during your stay in New York, and will write you at once.        I have already written Miss Tebbs regarding my offer. Hoping to        receive an affirmative answer by return mail, with best wishes,        I remain         \"Yours sincerely,         \"EVERETT SOUTHARD.\"    \"Well, I should say the unexpected had happened,\" said Grace, as Anne  finished reading. \"One hundred dollars a week for six weeks! Why, Anne,  think of it! You will have six hundred dollars for six weeks' work. I  had no idea they paid such salaries.\"    \"They pay more than that in companies like Mr. Southard's,\" replied  Anne. \"If I had acquired fame I could command twice that sum. I can't  imagine why he ever chose me. Suppose I should fail entirely.\"    \"Nonsense,\" retorted Grace. \"You couldn't fail if you tried. The only  thing that I am afraid of is that you'll be so carried away with the  stage that you'll forget to come back to us again.\"    \"Don't say that, Grace,\" said Anne quickly. \"I never shall. I am wild to  play this engagement, because it means that I am sure of at least two  years in college, and I think if I can get tutoring to do, I can pull  through the whole four. Aside from that, the stage is the last career in  the world that I should choose. You know my views on that subject.\"    \"I was only jesting, dear,\" Grace assured her, seeing the look of  anxiety that crept into Anne's eyes. \"I know you'll come back. We  couldn't graduate without you. When shall you write to Mr. Southard?\"    \"I have already written,\" replied Anne gravely. \"I knew that nothing  could induce me to refuse, so I settled the matter at once.\"    \"Confess, you bad child,\" said Grace, rising and putting one finger  under Anne's chin. \"Look me straight in the face and tell the truth. You  thought I'd be shocked.\"    Anne colored, laughed a little and then said frankly, \"Yes, I was afraid  you wouldn't look at the matter in the same light. Now, I must go,  because it is after nine and sister worries if I stay out late.\"    \"Wait, I'll go to the corner with you,\" said Grace.    Slipping into her coat, and throwing a silk scarf over her head. Grace  accompanied Anne into the street.    \"Come as far as the next corner,\" begged Anne, and the two girls walked  slowly on.    \"Now I must go back,\" said Grace, as they neared the corner.    Just then Anne exclaimed very softly, \"Look, Grace, isn't that Marian  and her cavalier?\"    \"Where!\" asked Grace, turning quickly.    \"Across the street, coming in this direction. I do believe Marian is  crying, too. They are crossing now, and will pass us. I don't think  they've seen us yet.\"    Completely absorbed in their own affairs the approaching couple had not  noticed either Grace or Anne.    \"How could I have been so foolish!\" the two girls heard Marian say  tearfully.    \"Don't be an idiot,\" her companion answered in rough tones. \"You may win  yet. I had inside information that it was safe to put the money on it.  You act like a baby.\" Then he muttered something that was inaudible to  the listeners.    \"You are very unkind, Henry,\" wailed Marian.    But in the next instant Henry Hammond had seen the two girls. With a  savage \"cut it out, can't you! Don't let every one know your business,\"  his scowling expression changed to the polite smiling mask that he  habitually wore.    But Grace, who in spite of her former disagreement with him, had for  Marian's sake favored him with a cool bow when he happened to cross her  path even after Marian had stopped speaking, was up in arms at his  display of rudeness to the girl who had cut herself off from her dearest  friends to please him.    Marian averted her face as they passed opposite the chums, but her  companion, who was preparing to bow, became suddenly disconcerted by the  steady, scornful gaze of two pairs of eyes, that looked their full  measure of contempt, and hastily turning his attention to Marian passed  by without speaking.    \"Contemptible coward!\" raged Grace. \"Did you hear what he said, Anne?\"    \"I should have cut his acquaintance on the spot.\"    \"There is something queer about all this,\" mused Grace. \"This is the  second conversation of the sort that has taken place between those two  that I have overheard. I wonder if he has persuaded Marian to put money  into his real estate schemes, for I believe they are nothing but  schemes.\"    \"But Marian has no money of her own,\" protested Anne. \"Don't you  remember how delighted she was when she deposited the judge's check and  received her first check book?\"    \"I wonder--\"    Grace paused. A sudden suspicion entered her mind, that she instantly  dismissed.    \"You don't believe--\" began Anne, but Grace stopped her.    \"No, dear,\" she answered firmly. \"We mustn't ever allow ourselves to  entertain such a thought. Marian may have foolishly risked money of her  own that we know nothing of, but as for anything else--Marian is still a  member of our sorority and the honor of the Phi Sigma Tau is above  reproach.\"          CHAPTER XVII    ANNE BECOMES FAMOUS      That Anne Pierson was to play a six weeks' engagement in New York under  the management of the great Southard was a nine days' matter of wonder  in Oakdale.    In spite of the fact that Anne tried to keep the news within her  immediate circle of friends, it spread like wildfire.    \"You'll just have to let me tell it, Anne,\" laughed Nora O'Malley. \"I  can't keep it to myself.\"    Rather to Anne's surprise, there was little disapproval expressed in  regard to her coming engagement. Those who had seen her enact \"Rosalind\"  in the High School production of \"As You Like It,\" fully described in  \"Grace Harlowe's Junior Year at High School,\" had been then  convinced that her ability was little short of genius. But the interest  of the thing deepened when the story crept about that this engagement  meant a college career for her, and Anne became the idol of the hour.    \"The whole town has gone mad over Anne,\" replied Jessica. \"I expect to  see a howling populace at the station when she leaves for New York  to-morrow.\"    The three chums were seated upon the single bed in Anne's little room at  the Pierson cottage, while Anne sat on the floor before an open trunk,  busily engaged in packing.    \"What shall we do without you!\" lamented Grace. \"Positively I have  sorrowfully accompanied departing friends to the station so many times  since school began that it's becoming second nature to me.\"    \"Good-bye, forever; good-bye, forever,\" hummed Nora.    \"Stop it instantly, Nora,\" commanded Grace. \"Don't harrow my feelings  until the time comes.\"    \"Anne, you must write to us often,\" stipulated Jessica.    \"Of course I shall,\" replied Anne. \"Remember you are all coming down to  see me, the very first Saturday that you can. I do hope the boys can  make arrangements to be there at the same time.\"    \"How lovely it was of Mrs. Gibson to suggest a theatre party and offer  to chaperon us,\" said Nora.    \"Everyone has been too sweet for anything,\" replied Anne, looking up  from her task with a fond smile at the three eager faces of her friends.    \"You didn't have the least bit of trouble about getting away from  school, did you?\" asked Jessica.    \"No,\" replied Anne. \"You see, I have enough counts to graduate now. I'm  not depending on any of my June exams. I can easily make up the time  when I come back.\"    \"I imagine Marian Barber wishes that she hadn't"]]]
