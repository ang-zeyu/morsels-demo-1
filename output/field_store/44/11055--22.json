Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 612 (1988) (\"It has not been the Court's  practice, in considering facial challenges to statutes of this  kind, to strike them down in anticipation that particular  applications may result in unconstitutional use of funds.\")  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).      First Amendment overbreadth doctrine creates a limited  exception to this rule by permitting facial invalidation of a  statute that burdens a substantial amount of protected speech,  even if the statute may be constitutionally applied in particular  circumstances.  \"The Constitution gives significant protection  from overbroad laws that chill speech within the First  Amendment's vast and privileged sphere.  Under this principle, [a  law] is unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits a  substantial amount of protected expression.\"  Ashcroft v. Free  Speech Coalition, 122 S. Ct. 1389, 1399 (2002); see also  Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973).  This more  liberal test of a statute's facial validity under the First  Amendment stems from the recognition that where a statute's reach  contemplates a number of both constitutional and unconstitutional  applications, the law's sanctions may deter individuals from  challenging the law's validity by engaging in constitutionally  protected speech that may nonetheless be proscribed by the law.  Without an overbreadth doctrine, \"the contours of regulation  would have to be hammered out case by case  and tested only by  those hardy enough to risk criminal prosecution to determine the  proper scope of regulation.\"  Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S.  479, 487 (1965); see also Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472  U.S. 491, 503 (1985) (\"[A]n individual whose own speech or  expressive conduct may validly be prohibited or sanctioned is  permitted to challenge a statute on its face because it also  threatens others not before the court  those who desire to  engage in legally protected expression but who may refrain from  doing so rather than risk prosecution or undertake to have the  law declared partially invalid.\").      Plaintiffs argue that the overbreadth doctrine is applicable  here, since CIPA \"threatens to chill free speech  because it  will censor a substantial amount of protected speech, because it  is vague, and because the law creates a prior restraint . . . .\"   Unlike the statutes typically challenged as facially overbroad,  however, CIPA does not impose criminal penalties on those who  violate its conditions.  Cf. Freedom of Speech Coalition, 122 S.  Ct. at 1398 (\"With these severe penalties in force, few  legitimate movie producers or book publishers, or few other  speakers in any capacity, would risk distributing images in or  near the uncertain reach of this law.\").  Thus, the rationale for  permitting facial challenges to laws that may be constitutionally  applied in some instances is less compelling in cases such as  this, which involve challenges to Congress's exercise of the  spending power, than in challenges to criminal statutes.  Nonetheless, \"even minor punishments can chill protected  speech,\" id., and absent the ability to challenge CIPA on its  face, public libraries that depend on federal funds may decide to  comply with CIPA's terms, thereby denying patrons access to  substantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech, rather  than refusing to comply with CIPA's terms and consequently losing  the benefits of federal funds.  See 47 C.F.R. Sec. 54.520(e)(1) (\"A  school or library that knowingly fails to ensure the use of  computers in accordance with the certifications required by this  section, must reimburse any funds and discounts received under  the federal universal support service support mechanism for  schools and libraries for the period in which there was  noncompliance.\").  Even in cases where the only penalty for  failure to comply with a statute is the withholding of federal  funds, the Court has sustained facial challenges to Congress's  exercise of the spending power.  See, e.g., Legal Servs. Corp. v.  Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001) (declaring unconstitutional on its  face a federal statute restricting the ability of legal services  providers who receive federal funds to engage in activity  protected by the First Amendment).      The Court's unconstitutional conditions cases, such as  Velazquez, are not strictly controlling, since they do not  require a showing that recipients who comply with the conditions  attached to federal funding will, as state actors, violate  others' constitutional rights, as is the case under the fourth  prong of Dole.  However, they are highly instructive.  The Supreme Court's pronouncements in the unconstitutional  conditions cases on what is necessary for a plaintiff to mount a  successful First Amendment facial challenge to an exercise of  Congress's spending power have not produced a seamless web.  For  example, in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), the Court  rejected a First Amendment facial challenge to federal  regulations prohibiting federally funded healthcare clinics from  providing counseling concerning the use of abortion as a method  of family planning, explaining that:  Petitioners are challenging the facial validity of the  regulations.  Thus, we are concerned only with the  question whether, on their face, the regulations are  both authorized by the Act and can be construed in such  a manner that they can be applied to a set of  individuals without infringing upon constitutionally  protected rights.  Petitioners face a heavy burden in  seeking to have the regulations invalidated as facially  unconstitutional. . . .  The fact that the regulations  might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable  set of circumstances is insufficient to render them  wholly invalid.      Id. at 183 (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation  omitted).  In contrast, NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998), which  also involved a facial First Amendment challenge to an exercise  of Congress's spending power, articulated a somewhat more liberal  test of facial validity than Rust, explaining that \"[t]o prevail,  respondents must demonstrate a substantial risk that application  of the provision will lead to the suppression of speech.\"  Id. at  580.  Against this background, it is unclear to us whether, to  succeed in facially invalidating CIPA on the grounds that it will  \"induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves  be unconstitutional,\" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210, plaintiffs must show  that it is impossible for public libraries to comply with CIPA's  conditions without violating the First Amendment, or rather  simply that CIPA will effectively restrict library patrons'  access to substantial amounts of constitutionally protected  speech, therefore causing many libraries to violate the First  Amendment.  However, we need not resolve this issue.  Rather, we  may assume without deciding, for purposes of this case, that a  facial challenge to CIPA requires plaintiffs to show that any  public library that complies with CIPA's conditions will  necessarily violate the First Amendment and, as explained in  detail below, we believe that CIPA's constitutionality fails even  under this more restrictive test of facial validity urged on us  by the government.  Because of the inherent limitations in  filtering technology, public libraries can never comply with CIPA  without blocking access to a substantial amount of speech that is  both constitutionally protected and fails to meet even the  filtering companies' own blocking criteria.  We turn first to the  governing legal principles to be applied to the facts in order to  determine whether the First Amendment permits a library to use  the filtering technology mandated by CIPA.  3.        Level of Scrutiny Applicable to Content-based Restrictions  on Internet Access in Public Libraries        In analyzing the constitutionality of a public library's use  of Internet filtering software, we must first identify the  appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to this restriction on  patrons' access to speech.  While plaintiffs argue that a public  library's use of such filters is subject to strict scrutiny, the  government maintains that the applicable standard is rational  basis review.  If strict scrutiny applies, the government must  show that the challenged restriction on speech is narrowly  tailored to promote a compelling government interest and that no  less restrictive alternative would further that interest.  United  States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000).  In contrast, under rational basis review, the challenged  restriction need only be reasonable; the government interest that  the restriction serves need not be compelling; the restriction  need not be narrowly tailored to serve that interest; and the  restriction \"need not be the most reasonable or the only  reasonable limitation.\"  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ.  Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 808 (1985).      Software filters, by definition, block access to speech on  the basis of its content, and content-based restrictions on  speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny.  See Playboy,  529 U.S. at 813 (\"[A] content-based speech restriction . . . can  stand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny.\").  Strict scrutiny  does not necessarily apply to content-based restrictions on  speech, however, where the restrictions apply only to speech on  government property, such as public libraries.  \"[I]t is . . .  well settled that the government need not permit all forms of  speech on property that it owns and controls.\"  Int'l Soc'y for  Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 678 (1992).  We  perforce turn to a discussion of public forum doctrine.  1.

Whether or no such voting is for the good of the common weal is beside  our present question. But it is clearly an arrangement which leads to  amity and peace between a man and his womenkind, and through these to  good-will towards all women.    In England everything is different.    If woman suffrage comes in here, it will have come as a surrender to  a very violent feminist agitation--an agitation which we have traced  back to our excess female population and the associated abnormal  physiological conditions.    If ever Parliament concedes the vote to woman in England, it will be  accepted by the militant suffragist, not as an eirenicon, but as a  victory which she will value only for the better carrying on of her  fight _a outrance [to the bitter end]_ against the oppression and  injustice of man.    A conciliation with hysterical revolt is neither an act of peace; nor  will it bring peace.    Nor would the conferring of the vote upon women carry with it any  advantages from the point of view of finding a way out of the material  entanglements in which woman is enmeshed, and thus ending the war  between man and woman.    One has only to ask oneself whether or not it would help the  legislator in remodelling the divorce or the bastardy laws if he had  conjoined with him an unmarried militant suffragist as assessor.    Peace will come again.  It will come when woman ceases to believe and  to teach all manner of evil of man despitefully. It will come when she  ceases to impute to him as a crime her own natural disabilities, when  she ceases to resent the fact that man cannot and does not wish to  work side by side with her. And peace will return when every woman for  whom there is no room in England seeks \"rest\" beyond the sea, \"each  one in the house of her husband,\" and when the woman who remains in  England comes to recognise that she can, without sacrifice of dignity,  give a willing subordination to the husband or father, who, when all  is said and done, earns and lays up money for her.
