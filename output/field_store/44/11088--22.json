One by one  they yielded to the voice of truth, and finally all--including Oliver  Cowdery--confessed that they had been misled by Satan, and that they  knew the Lord's words were not within the power of man to enlarge or  diminish.    Thus, promptly met, was an error rooted out. If unchecked it would  have led away some of those to whom angels had administered. This  showed to Joseph and to all who were with him that constant vigilance  was necessary to protect even the best from the devices of the evil  one. They saw that it was against the elect that Satan directed his  strongest efforts; and that, when blinded by his temptations, they were  unable to see the way of righteousness from which they were departing  or the mire of wickedness into which he was leading their feet. For  some of them the lesson was long effective; but with others it was of  but temporary avail. These latter seemed unable to long restrain their  own eager ambition and vanity, or to close their ears to the tempting  whispers of the adversary, who constantly plotted their downfall.    While Joseph was laboring in Fayette to restore peace to his brethren  and prosperity to the cause, the sectarian preachers were stirring  up the minds of the people at Harmony to think and act evilly toward  the Prophet and his work. As soon as Joseph went back to his home he  found that some persons who had been his friends now spoke and bore  themselves coldly toward him. A Methodist minister in the neighborhood,  taking advantage of Joseph's absence, had spoken all manner of evil  things concerning him, and had succeeded in making the people distrust  the Prophet and the work of God. Isaac Hale and his family were thus  led away. When Joseph had left them to go to Fayette, they were filled  with kindness toward him and his wife. They promised and accorded him  protection and help; and they were examining the principles of the  gospel so earnestly that Joseph hoped soon to welcome his wife's family  into the fold. But the Methodist minister, who was influential with  Isaac Hale, had whispered such untruths concerning the absent Prophet,  and Satan had worked so effectively to blind the eyes and becloud the  understanding of the people of Harmony, that nearly all were ready in  persecution against Joseph. Isaac Hale and his family were turned from  the work, and became from that hour its bitter opponents.    But Joseph must not falter in his labor. The branch of the Church at  Colesville was also suffering persecution; and the Prophet had to  forget for the time all his personal afflictions. In the latter part of  August, 1830, he called to his company John Whitmer, David Whitmer and  Hyrum Smith, and went to comfort and instruct Joseph Knight and those  who were associated with him. Such fierce threats had been uttered by  the mobocrats who sympathized with the Presbyterian ministers, that  Joseph and his brethren felt that they were risking their lives in  thus journeying to Colesville. They joined together in mighty prayer,  beseeching God that He would blind the eyes of their enemies, and  permit them to go and come without recognition by the wicked. The  Prophet informed his companions that their prayer would be answered,  and the angel of the Lord would protect them and cover with a veil  the vision of the murderous mob. They made no effort to disguise  themselves, but traveled through Colesville to the house of Joseph  Knight in broad day, meeting a score of their persecutors. A reward  had been offered to anyone who would give information of Joseph's  return; and among those whom they met were many who would gladly have  earned the money, even at the expense of the Prophet's life. But no one  said a harsh word to Joseph and his companions, and they were treated  merely as ordinary strangers passing through the village. A meeting of  the branch was held that night, and the Spirit of God was poured out  upon the believers in rich abundance. They were all made firm by the  blessing given, and filled with a determination to yield nothing of  their faith, though the anger of the wicked should be visited upon them  through robbery or even death.    The next morning Joseph and his party started back to Harmony. A few  hours after they were gone, a howling mob descended upon the house  of Joseph Knight and demanded the persons of the Prophet and his  companions--swearing to visit vengeance in case of a refusal. This mob  was composed of some of the persons who had been incited by sectarian  ministers on other occasions to offer violence to the Prophet. This  time they were more fierce than ever before. All day long they surged  around the houses of Joseph Knight and his son Newel, cursing and  threatening. Nothing apparently would appease them until, exhausted by  their own evil passions, they were forced to disperse.    The situation in Pennsylvania was not improved; and soon it became  apparent that the Prophet could not work in the vicinity of Harmony  with any degree of vigor and freedom. Persecution flourished on every  side. But while the Prophet was suffering all this in body and in  spirit, a messenger brought an invitation from Peter Whitmer, asking  Joseph once more to come to Fayette and establish his home. The peace  of the Holy Spirit had filled the hearts of the brethren at Fayette,  and they desired to have the Prophet among them, to bless him with  their faith, and aid him by their works in the accomplishment of his  ministry. After a brief time Joseph Knight came to Harmony. Seeing  the situation of the Prophet, he offered his wagon and horses for the  conveyance of Joseph's family to Fayette; and in the last week of  August, 1830, the Prophet found himself established once more in the  house of Peter Whitmer.    Wearied with the buffetings of the world, Joseph would have been glad  to enjoy a little season of peace; but on his arrival at Fayette he  found that the old spirit of vanity had gained an entrance, even  while he was journeying from Harmony. One of the brethren named Hiram  Page, had been inspired by the evil one to make known revelations  which he declared he had received for the Church, through a stone he  had, which were utterly at variance with the spirit of the gospel  and opposed to the commands of God, previously given through Joseph,  the ordained Prophet. These tempting declarations made by Hiram Page  had met with the favor of Oliver Cowdery and some of the Whitmers.  They were deceived by him; they had not yet fully learned that Satan  could give revelations. Joseph rebuked again, and this time more  sternly, the childish folly of these people. They were anxious to do  right; and yet, without his presence, they were certain to do evil.  He demanded that they should forsake the false doctrines which Hiram  Page was promulgating, and that all should unite with him in asking  God to reveal to them His will concerning the manner in which His  commands should be given to the world. The answer to this petition was  that revelation, given to Oliver Cowdery early in September, 1830,  establishing once and forever the order of Heaven concerning God's  revelations to men. It was made known to Oliver therein that God had  but one head for His Church, and that head was His chosen servant,  Joseph Smith. No one else should be appointed by the Church until God  should so direct, to receive commandments; for Joseph held the keys of  the mysteries and the revelations which were sealed, and through him  alone should they be given, until some other should be chosen by the  Lord in his stead. Oliver's place was defined to him: He should receive  revelations, but not to be written by way of command to the Church.  It was his duty to labor in secret with his brother, Hiram Page, and  declare to him that the things which Hiram had written as revelations  from that stone, were not of God and that Satan was deceiving him. When  these things should be finished, Oliver was told, it would be his duty  to go to the land of the Lamanites, or Indians, among whom the gospel  must be proclaimed, and by whose borders a city should be built.    The word of God had its effect, and the evil which had been done was  repented of by all. Hiram Page and the Whitmers forsook that which had  been condemned and asked forgiveness.    Besides settling the grand principle that individuals can receive  revelations for their own comfort, but not as commandments for the  Church, and that the chosen Prophet who stands at the head shall alone  have that authority, the Lord in this revelation informed His children  of a purpose which to them must have been a source of amazement. It was  within this divine purpose that a city of the Saints should be built;  and yet here was but a handful of people, with a Prophet persecuted,  threatened, driven, until he had no place to lay his head, except  through the charity of his brethren.    Doubtless these people, who were now reconciled to Heaven and united  with each other, felt wonder that they should be called upon to engage  in any labor likely to attract anew the vengeful feeling of mobs. But  whatever worldly fear may have assailed them, they were soon blessed  and encouraged by another revelation, which followed in a few days. It  came through Joseph in the presence of six elders at Fayette; and it  declared that they were chosen out of the world to proclaim the gospel  of Jesus Christ with the sound of rejoicing as with the voice of a  trump. They were informed that their duty would be to bring to pass  the gathering of God's people upon the earth. This was the spiritual  inception of that great missionary movement designed by God to bring  out from every nation, kindred, tongue and people to the land which He  should designate as a place of gathering, every honest soul who would  have faith and accept the requirements of the gospel.        CHAPTER XV.    THE SECOND CONFERENCE "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5999"],[0,"Guy Mannering; or, The Astrologer — Complete (#17)"],[1,"used to call for her bearers  as loud, or louder, than a traveller demands post-horses,--even she  shared the same disastrous fate. The 'daft Jock,' who, half knave, half  idiot, had been the sport of each succeeding race of village children for  a good part of a century, was remitted to the county bridewell, where,  secluded from free air and sunshine, the only advantages he was capable  of enjoying, he pined and died in the course of six months. The old  sailor, who had so long rejoiced the smoky rafters of every kitchen in  the country by singing 'Captain Ward' and 'Bold Admiral Benbow,' was  banished from the county for no better reason than that he was supposed  to speak with a strong Irish accent. Even the annual rounds of the pedlar  were abolished by the Justice, in his hasty zeal for the administration  of rural police.    These things did not pass without notice and censure. We are not made of  wood or stone, and the things which connect themselves with our hearts  and habits cannot, like bark or lichen, be rent away without our missing  them. The farmer's dame lacked her usual share of intelligence, perhaps  also the self-applause which she had felt while distributing the awmous  (alms), in shape of a gowpen (handful) of oatmeal, to the mendicant who  brought the news. The cottage felt inconvenience from interruption of the  petty trade carried on by the itinerant dealers. The children lacked  their supply of sugarplums and toys; the young women wanted pins,  ribbons, combs, and ballads; and the old could no longer barter their  eggs for salt, snuff, and tobacco. All these circumstances brought the  busy Laird of Ellangowan into discredit, which was the more general on  account of his former popularity. Even his lineage was brought up in  judgment against him. They thought 'naething of what the like of  Greenside, or Burnville, or Viewforth might do, that were strangers in  the country; but Ellangowan! that had been a name amang them since the  Mirk Monanday, and lang before--HIM to be grinding the puir at that rate!  They ca'd his grandfather the Wicked Laird; but, though he was whiles  fractious aneuch, when he got into roving company and had ta'en the drap  drink, he would have scorned to gang on at this gate. Na, na, the muckle  chumlay in the Auld Place reeked like a killogie in his time, and there  were as mony puir folk riving at the banes in the court, and about the  door, as there were gentles in the ha'. And the leddy, on ilka Christmas  night as it came round, gae twelve siller pennies to ilka puir body  about, in honour of the twelve apostles like. They were fond to ca' it  papistrie; but I think our great folk might take a lesson frae the  papists whiles. They gie another sort o' help to puir folk than just  dinging down a saxpence in the brod on the Sabbath, and kilting, and  scourging, and drumming them a' the sax days o' the week besides.'    Such was the gossip over the good twopenny in every ale-house within  three or four miles of Ellangowan, that being about the diameter of the  orbit in which our friend Godfrey Bertram, Esq., J. P., must be  considered as the principal luminary. Still greater scope was given to  evil tongues by the removal of a colony of gipsies, with one of whom our  reader is somewhat acquainted, and who had for a great many years enjoyed  their chief settlement upon the estate of Ellangowan.              CHAPTER  VII       Come, princes of the ragged regiment,       You of the blood! PRIGS, my most upright lord,       And these, what name or title e'er they bear,       JARKMAN, or PATRICO, CRANKE or CLAPPER-DUDGEON,       PRATER or ABRAM-MAN--I speak of all.              Beggar's Bush.      Although the character of those gipsy tribes which formerly inundated  most of the nations of Europe, and which in some degree still subsist  among them as a distinct people, is generally understood, the reader will  pardon my saying a few words respecting their situation in Scotland.    It is well known that the gipsies were at an early period acknowledged as  a separate and independent race by one of the Scottish monarchs, and that  they were less favourably distinguished by a subsequent law, which  rendered the character of gipsy equal in the judicial balance to that of  common and habitual thief, and prescribed his punishment accordingly.  Notwithstanding the severity of this and other statutes, the fraternity  prospered amid the distresses of the country, and received large  accessions from among those whom famine, oppression, or the sword of war  had deprived of the ordinary means of subsistence. They lost in a great  measure by this intermixture the national character of Egyptians, and  became a mingled race, having all the idleness and predatory habits of  their Eastern ancestors, with a ferocity which they probably borrowed  from the men of the north who joined their society. They travelled in  different bands, and had rules among themselves, by which each tribe was  confined to its own district. The slightest invasion of the precincts  which had been assigned to another tribe produced desperate skirmishes,  in which there was often much blood shed.    The patriotic Fletcher of Saltoun drew a picture of these banditti about  a century ago, which my readers will peruse with astonishment:--    'There are at this day in Scotland (besides a great many poor families  very meanly provided for by the church boxes, with others who, by living  on bad food, fall into various diseases) two hundred thousand people  begging from door to door. These are not only no way advantageous, but a  very grievous burden to so poor a country. And though the number of them  be perhaps double to what it was formerly, by reason of this present  great distress, yet in all times there have been about one hundred  thousand of those vagabonds, who have lived without any regard or  subjection either to the laws of the land or even those of God and nature  . . . No magistrate could ever discover, or be informed, which way one in  a hundred of these wretches died, or that ever they were baptized. Many  murders have been discovered among them; and they are not only a most  unspeakable oppression to poor tenants (who, if they give not bread or  some kind of provision to perhaps forty such villains in one day, are  sure to be insulted by them), but they rob many poor people who live in  houses distant from any neighbourhood. In years of plenty, many thousands  of them meet together in the mountains, where they feast and riot for  many days; and at country weddings, markets, burials, and other the like  public occasions, they are to be seen, both man and woman, perpetually  drunk, cursing, blaspheming, and fighting together.'    Notwithstanding the deplorable picture presented in this extract, and  which Fletcher himself, though the energetic and eloquent friend of  freedom, saw no better mode of correcting than by introducing a system of  domestic slavery, the progress of time, and increase both of the means of  life and of the power of the laws, gradually reduced this dreadful evil  within more narrow bounds. The tribes of gipsies, jockies, or cairds--for  by all these denominations such banditti were known--became few in  number, and many were entirely rooted out. Still, however, a sufficient  number remained to give, occasional alarm and constant vexation. Some  rude handicrafts were entirely resigned to these itinerants, particularly  the art of trencher-making, of manufacturing horn-spoons, and the whole  mystery of the tinker. To these they added a petty trade in the coarse  sorts of earthenware. Such were their ostensible means of livelihood.  Each tribe had usually some fixed place of rendezvous, which they  occasionally occupied and considered as their standing camp, and in the  vicinity of which they generally abstained from depredation. They had  even talents and accomplishments, which made them occasionally useful and  entertaining. Many cultivated music with success; and the favourite  fiddler or piper of a district was often to be found in a gipsy town.  They understood all out-of-door sports, especially otter-hunting,  fishing, or finding game. They bred the best and boldest terriers, and  sometimes had good pointers for sale. In winter the women told fortunes,  the men showed tricks of legerdemain; and these accomplishments often  helped to while away a weary or stormy evening in the circle of the  'farmer's ha'.' The wildness of their character, and the indomitable  pride with which they despised all regular labour, commanded a certain  awe, which was not diminished by the consideration that these strollers  were a vindictive race, and were restrained by no check, either of fear  or conscience, from taking desperate vengeance upon those who had  offended them. These tribes were, in short, the pariahs of Scotland,  living like wild Indians among European settlers, and, like them, judged  of rather by their own customs, habits, and opinions, than as if they had  been members of the civilised part of the community. Some hordes of them  yet remain, chiefly in such situations as afford a ready escape either  into a waste country or into another Jurisdiction. Nor are the features  of their character much softened. Their numbers, however, are so greatly  diminished that, instead of one hundred thousand, as calculated by  Fletcher, it would now perhaps be impossible to collect above five  hundred throughout all Scotland.    A tribe of these itinerants, to whom Meg Merrilies appertained, had long  been as stationary as their habits permitted in a glen upon the estate of  Ellangowan. They had there erected a few huts, which they denominated  their 'city of refuge,' and where, when not absent on excursions, they  harboured unmolested, as the crows that roosted in the old ash-trees  around them. They had been such long occupants that they were considered  in some degree as proprietors of the "]]]
