[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],[0,"The Satyricon â€” Complete (#17)"],[1,"\"  One was called Cerdo--business--, Trimalchio informed us,  the other Lucrio--luck--and the third Felicio--profit--and, when all the  rest had kissed a true likeness of Trimalchio, we were ashamed to pass it  by.          CHAPTER THE SIXTY-FIRST.    After they had all wished each other sound minds and good health,  Trimalchio turned to Niceros.  \"You used to be better company at  dinner,\" he remarked, \"and I don't know why you should be dumb today,  with never a word to say.  If you wish to make me happy, tell about that  experience you had, I beg of you.\"  Delighted at the affability of his  friend, \"I hope I lose all my luck if I'm not tickled to death at the  humor I see you in,\" Niceros replied.  \"All right, let's go the limit for  a good time, though I'm afraid these scholars'll laugh at me, but I'll  tell my tale and they can go as far as they like.  What t'hell do I care  who laughs?  It's better to be laughed at than laughed down.\"  These  words spake the hero, and began the following tale: \"We lived in a narrow  street in the house Gavilla now owns, when I was a slave.  There, by the  will of the gods, I fell in love with the wife of Terentius, the  innkeeper; you knew Melissa of Tarentum, that pretty round-checked little  wench.  It was no carnal passion, so hear me, Hercules, it wasn't; I was  not in love with her physical charms.  No, it was because she was such a  good sport.  I never asked her for a thing and had her deny me; if she  had an as, I had half.  I trusted her with everything I had and never was  done out of anything.  Her husband up and died on the place, one day, so  I tried every way I could to get to her, for you know friends ought to  show up when anyone's in a pinch.\"          CHAPTER THE SIXTY-SECOND.    \"It so happened that our master had gone to Capua to attend to some odds  and ends of business and I seized the opportunity, and persuaded a guest  of the house to accompany me as far as the fifth mile-stone.  He was a  soldier, and as brave as the very devil.  We set out about cock-crow, the  moon was shining as bright as midday, and came to where the tombstones  are.  My man stepped aside amongst them, but I sat down, singing, and  commenced to count them up.  When I looked around for my companion, he  had stripped himself and piled his clothes by the side of the road.  My  heart was in my mouth, and I sat there while he pissed a ring around them  and was suddenly turned into a wolf!  Now don't think I'm joking, I  wouldn't lie for any amount of money, but as I was saying, he commenced  to howl after he was turned into a wolf, and ran away into the forest.  I didn't know where I was for a minute or two, then I went to his  clothes, to pick them up, and damned if they hadn't turned to stone!  Was  ever anyone nearer dead from fright than me?  Then I whipped out my sword  and cut every shadow along the road to bits, till I came to the house of  my mistress.  I looked like a ghost when I went in, and I nearly slipped  my wind.  The sweat was pouring down my crotch, my eyes were staring, and  I could hardly be brought around.  My Melissa wondered why I was out so  late.  \"Oh, if you'd only come sooner,\" she said, \"you could have helped  us: a wolf broke into the folds and attacked the sheep, bleeding them  like a butcher.  But he didn't get the laugh on me, even if he did get  away, for one of the slaves ran his neck through with a spear!\"  I  couldn't keep my eyes shut any longer when I heard that, and as soon as  it grew light, I rushed back to our Gaius' house like an innkeeper beaten  out of his bill, and when I came to the place where the clothes had been  turned into stone, there was nothing but a pool of blood!  And moreover,  when I got home, my soldier was lying in bed, like an ox, and a doctor  was dressing his neck!  I knew then that he was a werewolf, and after  that, I couldn't have eaten a crumb of bread with him, no, not if you had  killed me.  Others can think what they please about this, but as for me,  I hope your geniuses will all get after me if I lie.\"          CHAPTER THE SIXTY-THIRD.    We were all dumb with astonishment, when \"I take your story for granted,\"  said Trimalchio, \"and if you'll believe me, my hair stood on end, and  all the more, because I know that Niceros never talks nonsense: he's  always level-headed, not a bit gossipy.  And now I'll tell you a  hair-raiser myself, though I'm like a jackass on a slippery pavement  compared to him.  When I was a long-haired boy, for I lived a Chian life  from my youth up, my master's minion died.  He was a jewel, so hear me  Hercules, he was, perfect in every facet.  While his sorrow-stricken  mother was bewailing his loss, and the rest of us were lamenting with  her, the witches suddenly commenced to screech so loud that you would  have thought a hare was being run down by the hounds!  At that time, we  had a Cappadocian slave, tall, very bold, and he had muscle too; he  could hold a mad bull in the air!  He wrapped a mantle around his left  arm, boldly rushed out of doors with drawn sword, and ran a woman  through the middle about here, no harm to what I touch.  We heard a  scream, but as a matter of fact, for I won't lie to you, we didn't catch  sight of the witches themselves.  Our simpleton came back presently, and  threw himself upon the bed.  His whole body was black and blue, as if he  had been flogged with whips, and of course the reason of that was she  had touched him with her evil hand!  We shut the door and returned to  our business, but when the mother put her arms around the body of her  son, it turned out that it was only a straw bolster, no heart, no guts,  nothing!  Of course the witches had swooped down upon the lad and put  the straw changeling in his place!  Believe me or not, suit yourselves,  but I say that there are women that know too much, and night-hags, too,  and they turn everything upside down!  And as for the long-haired booby,  he never got back his own natural color and he died, raving mad, a few  days later.\"          CHAPTER THE SIXTY-FOURTH.    Though we wondered greatly, we believed none the less implicitly and,  kissing the table, we besought the night-hags to attend to their own  affairs while we were returning home from dinner.  As far as I was  concerned, the lamps already seemed to burn double and the whole  dining-room was going round, when \"See here, Plocamus,\" Trimalchio spoke  up, \"haven't you anything to tell us?  You haven't entertained us at all,  have you?  And you used to be fine company, always ready to oblige with a  recitation or a song.  The gods bless us, how the green figs have  fallen!\"  \"True for you,\" the fellow answered, \"since I've got the gout  my sporting days are over; but in the good old times when I was a young  spark, I nearly sang myself into a consumption.  How I used to dance!  And take my part in a farce, or hold up my end in the barber shops!  Who  could hold a candle to me except, of course, the one and only Apelles?\"  He then put his hand to his mouth and hissed out some foul gibberish or  other, and said afterwards that it was Greek.  Trimalchio himself then  favored us with an impersonation of a man blowing a trumpet, and when he  had finished, he looked around for his minion, whom he called Croesus, a  blear-eyed slave whose teeth were very disagreeably discolored.  He was  playing with a little black bitch, disgustingly fat, wrapping her up in a  leek-green scarf and teasing her with a half-loaf of bread which he had  put on the couch; and when from sheer nausea, she refused it, he crammed  it down her throat.  This sight put Trimalchio in mind of his own dog and  he ordered Scylax, \"the guardian of his house and home,\" to be brought  in.  An enormous dog was immediately led in upon a chain and, obeying a  kick from the porter, it lay down beside the table. Thereupon Trimalchio  remarked, as he threw it a piece of white bread, \"No one in all my house  loves me better than Scylax.\"  Enraged at Trimalchio's praising Scylax so  warmly, the slave put the bitch down upon the floor and sicked her on to  fight.  Scylax, as might have been expected from such a dog, made the  whole room ring with his hideous barking and nearly shook the life out of  the little bitch which the slave called Pearl.  Nor did the uproar end in  a dog fight, a candelabrum was upset upon the table, breaking the glasses  and spattering some of the guests with hot oil.  As Trimalchio did not  wish to seem concerned at the loss, he kissed the boy and ordered him to  climb upon his own back.  The slave did not hesitate but, mounting his  rocking-horse, he beat Trimalchio's shoulders with his open palms,  yelling with laughter, \"Buck! Buck!  How many fingers do I hold up!\"  When Trimalchio had, in a measure, regained his composure, which took but  a little while, he ordered that a huge vessel be filled with mixed wine,  and that drinks be served to all the slaves sitting around our feet,  adding as an afterthought, \"If anyone refuses to drink, pour it on his  head: business is business, but now's the time for fun.\"          CHAPTER THE SIXTY-FIFTH.    The dainties that followed this display of affability were of such a  nature that, if any reliance is to be placed in my word, the very mention  of them makes me sick at the stomach.  Instead of thrushes, fattened  chickens were served, one to each of us, and goose eggs with pastry caps  on them, which same Trimalchio earnestly entreated us to eat, informing  us that the chickens had all been boned.  Just at that instant, however,  a lictor knocked at the dining-room door, and a reveler, clad in white  vestments, entered, followed by a large retinue.  Startled at such pomp,  I thought that the Praetor had arrived, so I put my bare feet upon the  floor and started to get up, but Agamemnon laughed at my anxiety and  said, \"Keep your seat, you idiot, it's only Habinnas the sevir; he's a  stone mason, and if report"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],[0,"The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#17)"],[1," in the papers, but if it is,         the expense is borne by the family of the         woman. The public announcement is usually         made at some social entertainment--as, a         dinner, tea, or an \"At Home,\" given by either         family.           At a formal dinner given by the family of         the woman, the father takes out his daughter         first and her fiance escorts her mother. At         the proper time the father drinks his future         son-in-law's health and announces the         engagement. All rise, and congratulations         follow.           Notes may be written to intimate friends         informing them of the happy event.      WOMEN. A woman should at once confide in         her parents, and trust to their future         guidance and to their making a full investigation         of the man, his social condition, and business         prospects. They should not mention the         matter to others.           Immediately after the engagement, each of         the two parties should be introduced to the         family of the other party. Before the wedding-cards         are issued the woman should leave her         card personally at the homes of her friends,         but without entering. After the wedding-cards         are issued she should not appear at any         social function, or make any personal visits,         or be seen at any place of amusement.           It is not wise for her to call at the place of         business of her fiance, and if a meeting is         necessary, it is better to make an appointment         elsewhere.      RING. The ring is given by the man immediately         after the announcement of the engagement         to the woman, who wears it on the third finger         of her left hand. It should be a small and         unostentatious one. Diamonds, rubies,         moonstones, sapphires, and other precious stones         may be used.           He may ask the woman to aid him in the         selection, but it is better for him to make the         selection alone. The woman may give the         man an engagement ring or a gift if she         wishes.        ENTERTAINMENTS--CALLS AFTER. See CALLS--MEN--AFTER         ENTERTAINMENTS.        ENVELOPES, ADDRESSING. See ADDRESSING ENVELOPES.        ESQUIRE. Either ESQ. or MR. may be used in         addressing a letter, but never the two at the         same time.        EVENING CALLS. When no special day for receiving         is indicated, calls may be made at any proper         hour, according to the custom of the locality.         Men of leisure may call at the fashionable         hours, from two till five o'clock in the         afternoon, while business and professional men         may call between eight and nine in the         evening, as their obligations prevent them from         observing the fashionable hours.        EVENING DRESS.      Men. Evening dress should be worn on all         formal occasions, consisting of the swallow-         tail coat of black material, made in the         prevailing fashion, with waistcoat and trousers         of the same material; or a white vest may         be worn.           The linen must be white. Studs or shirt-         buttons may be worn, according to fashion.         The collar should be high, and the cravat         white. Low patent-leather shoes and white         kid gloves complete the costume.           Evening dress should be worn at all formal         functions after six o'clock--as, balls, dinners,         suppers, receptions, germans, formal         stag parties, theatre, opera, and fashionable         evening calls where women are present.           The phrase, \"evening dress,\" is now used         in place of full dress.           A Tuxedo should never be worn when         women are present.             See also TUXEDO. CLERGYMAN--EVENING           DRESS.      WEDDINGS, EVENING. Full evening dress is         worn by the groom and ushers. Guests are         likewise in evening dress.      CLERGYMAN. Custom permits a clergyman to         wear his clerical dress at all functions where         other men wear evening dress, or he may         wear evening dress.        EVENING RECEPTIONS. The etiquette is the same as         for an afternoon tea (formal), save that no         cards are left by the guests, and that they         wear evening dress.             See AFTERNOON TEAS (FORMAL).        FACSIMILE CARDS, engraved, are no longer used.        FAMILY OF BRIDE. The family, except the father,         leave the house first, then the bridesmaids,         the maid of honor with the mother, and last         the bride with her father or nearest male         relative. At church the family is seated by the         ushers.           At the conclusion of the ceremony they are         the first to be escorted from their pew and to         take their carriage for the wedding reception         or breakfast.        WEDDING BREAKFAST. The bride's father or         her nearest male relative takes in the groom's         mother, and the bride's mother, as hostess, is         taken in by the groom's father.        WEDDING RECEPTION. The parents of both         bride and groom stand up with the married         couple, and are introduced to the guests.        FAMILY OF GROOM. At the church the family and         relatives of the groom are seated on one side,         while the family of the bride and her         relatives are seated on the other.      WEDDING BREAKFAST. The groom's mother is         taken in by the bride's father, and the groom's         father takes in the bride's mother, who,         acting as hostess, comes last.      WEDDING RECEPTION. The parents of both         bride and groom stand up with the married         couple, and are introduced to the guests.        FAREWELL BACHELOR DINNER. See BACHELOR'S FAREWELL         DINNERS.        FAREWELL BRIDAL LUNCHEON. See BRIDE--FAREWELL         LUNCHEON.        FATHER OF BRIDE.      DEBUTS. When the debut is a formal one, he         stands beside his wife and daughter, and         receives the congratulations of the guests. At         a supper or dinner he escorts the most         distinguished woman. If there is no brother to         escort the debutante, he does so, and she is         seated at his left hand.      DINNER, ENGAGEMENT. At a formal dinner         given by the family of the engaged woman         the father takes out his daughter first and         her fiance escorts her mother. At the proper         time the father drinks to the health of his         future son-in-law, and announces the         engagement. All rise, and congratulations follow.           He wears evening dress.           The father of the bride, or her nearest         male relative, drives to the church with her,         and is there received by the ushers and         bridesmaids, and escorts her in the         procession up the aisle.           After the procession has arrived at the         chancel and the groom comes forward to         take the bride's hand, he steps back a little         way and waits for the clergyman's words:         \"Who giveth this woman away?\" He         then places the bride's right hand in that of         the clergyman, and retires to his seat in the         pew with his family.      WEDDING BREAKFAST. He takes in the mother         of the groom, following the ushers and the         maids of honor.      WEDDING RECEPTION. He escorts the groom's         mother, and receives with the married couple.        FATHER OF GROOM. At a wedding breakfast he should         take in the mother of the bride, and at a         wedding reception he receives with the bride         and groom.           At a church wedding he is, of course, given         a front seat among those reserved for the         groom's family.           He should wear afternoon dress for an         afternoon wedding, and evening dress at an         evening wedding.        FEES.      CHRISTENING. See CHRISTENING--FEES      WEDDING. The wedding fee, preferably gold or         clean bills in sealed envelope, is given by the         best man to the officiating clergyman. Custom         leaves the amount to the groom, who         should give at least five dollars or more, in         proportion to his income and social position.         The clergyman usually gives the fee to his         wife.           A fee should also be paid to the sexton and         the organist        FIANCE, MOURNING FOR. In the event of the death         of a woman's betrothed shortly before the         date of the wedding, she may wear black for         a short period or full mourning for a year.        FINGER-BOWL. The fingers should be dipped in the         water and gently rubbed together, and dried         on the napkins.        FIRST CALLS. Newcomers and brides are called upon         first.           After a country visit, the visitor should call         first upon the hostess when the latter returns         to town.           Other things being equal, the younger or         unmarried woman calls first upon the older         or married woman.           A woman returning to town before another         one would make the first call.           If one woman issues her AT HOME card         before another, she should receive the first         call.        FISH should be eaten with a fork held in the right         hand and a piece of bread held in the left hand.         The bones should be removed from the         mouth with the aid of a fork or with the         fingers. If by the latter, great delicacy         should be used.        FLOWER GIRL. The flower girls--one or two, as may         be the case--follow the maid of honor up the         isle and strew flowers in the path of the         bride, who follows after.           In the procession down the isle they should         follow the bride.           Flower girls and pages are not used now         as much as formerly.        FLOWERS."]]]
