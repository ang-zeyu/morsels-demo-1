The two most important gentlemen looked at each other earnestly and  strangely for a moment, and then retreated to those sacred inner rooms,  where they toil without ceasing for the good of the House.    And the moment they were all in their places--managers, secretaries,  clerks, and porters--they all started, and each looked cautiously round  to see if any one was looking at him. For each thought that he had  fallen asleep for a few minutes, and had dreamed a very odd dream about  the Phoenix and the board-room. And, of course, no one mentioned it  to any one else, because going to sleep at your office is a thing you  simply MUST NOT do.    The extraordinary confusion of the board-room, with the remains of the  incense in the plates, would have shown them at once that the visit of  the Phoenix had been no dream, but a radiant reality, but no one went  into the board-room again that day; and next day, before the office  was opened, it was all cleaned and put nice and tidy by a lady whose  business asking questions was not part of. That is why Cyril read  the papers in vain on the next day and the day after that; because no  sensible person thinks his dreams worth putting in the paper, and no one  will ever own that he has been asleep in the daytime.    The Phoenix was very pleased, but it decided to write an ode for itself.  It thought the ones it had heard at its temple had been too hastily  composed. Its own ode began--         'For beauty and for modest worth       The Phoenix has not its equal on earth.'    And when the children went to bed that night it was still trying to cut  down the last line to the proper length without taking out any of what  it wanted to say.    That is what makes poetry so difficult.        CHAPTER 6. DOING GOOD      'We shan't be able to go anywhere on the carpet for a whole week,  though,' said Robert.    'And I'm glad of it,' said Jane, unexpectedly.    'Glad?' said Cyril; 'GLAD?'    It was breakfast-time, and mother's letter, telling them how they were  all going for Christmas to their aunt's at Lyndhurst, and how father and  mother would meet them there, having been read by every one, lay on the  table, drinking hot bacon-fat with one corner and eating marmalade with  the other.    'Yes, glad,' said Jane. 'I don't want any more things to happen  just now. I feel like you do when you've been to three parties in a  week--like we did at granny's once--and extras in between, toys and  chocs and things like that. I want everything to be just real, and no  fancy things happening at all.' 'I don't like being obliged to keep  things from mother,' said Anthea. 'I don't know why, but it makes me  feel selfish and mean.'    'If we could only get the mater to believe it, we might take her to the  jolliest places,' said Cyril, thoughtfully. 'As it is, we've just got to  be selfish and mean--if it is that--but I don't feel it is.'    'I KNOW it isn't, but I FEEL it is,' said Anthea, 'and that's just as  bad.'    'It's worse,' said Robert; 'if you knew it and didn't feel it, it  wouldn't matter so much.'    'That's being a hardened criminal, father says,' put in Cyril, and he  picked up mother's letter and wiped its corners with his handkerchief,  to whose colour a trifle of bacon-fat and marmalade made but little  difference.    'We're going to-morrow, anyhow,' said Robert. 'Don't,' he added, with  a good-boy expression on his face--'don't let's be ungrateful for our  blessings; don't let's waste the day in saying how horrid it is to keep  secrets from mother, when we all know Anthea tried all she knew to give  her the secret, and she wouldn't take it. Let's get on the carpet and  have a jolly good wish. You'll have time enough to repent of things all  next week.'    'Yes,' said Cyril, 'let's. It's not really wrong.'    'Well, look here,' said Anthea. 'You know there's something about  Christmas that makes you want to be good--however little you wish it at  other times. Couldn't we wish the carpet to take us somewhere where we  should have the chance to do some good and kind action? It would be an  adventure just the same,' she pleaded.    'I don't mind,' said Cyril. 'We shan't know where we're going, and  that'll be exciting. No one knows what'll happen. We'd best put on our  outers in case--'    'We might rescue a traveller buried in the snow, like St Bernard dogs,  with barrels round our necks,' said Jane, beginning to be interested.    'Or we might arrive just in time to witness a will being signed--more  tea, please,' said Robert, 'and we should see the old man hide it away  in the secret cupboard; and then, after long years, when the rightful  heir was in despair, we should lead him to the hidden panel and--'    'Yes,' interrupted Anthea; 'or we might be taken to some freezing garret  in a German town, where a poor little pale, sick child--'    'We haven't any German money,' interrupted Cyril, 'so THAT'S no go. What  I should like would be getting into the middle of a war and getting hold  of secret intelligence and taking it to the general, and he would make  me a lieutenant or a scout, or a hussar.'    When breakfast was cleared away, Anthea swept the carpet, and the  children sat down on it, together with the Phoenix, who had been  especially invited, as a Christmas treat, to come with them and witness  the good and kind action they were about to do.    Four children and one bird were ready, and the wish was wished.    Every one closed its eyes, so as to feel the topsy-turvy swirl of the  carpet's movement as little as possible.    When the eyes were opened again the children found themselves on the  carpet, and the carpet was in its proper place on the floor of their own  nursery at Camden Town.    'I say,' said Cyril, 'here's a go!'    'Do you think it's worn out? The wishing part of it, I mean?' Robert  anxiously asked the Phoenix.    'It's not that,' said the Phoenix; 'but--well--what did you wish--?'    'Oh! I see what it means,' said Robert, with deep disgust; 'it's like  the end of a fairy story in a Sunday magazine. How perfectly beastly!'    'You mean it means we can do kind and good actions where we are? I see.  I suppose it wants us to carry coals for the cook or make clothes  for the bare heathens. Well, I simply won't. And the last day and  everything. Look here!' Cyril spoke loudly and firmly. 'We want to go  somewhere really interesting, where we have a chance of doing something  good and kind; we don't want to do it here, but somewhere else. See?  Now, then.'    The obedient carpet started instantly, and the four children and one  bird fell in a heap together, and as they fell were plunged in perfect  darkness.    'Are you all there?' said Anthea, breathlessly, through the black dark.  Every one owned that it was there.    'Where are we? Oh! how shivery and wet it is! Ugh!--oh!--I've put my  hand in a puddle!'    'Has any one got any matches?' said Anthea, hopelessly. She felt sure  that no one would have any.    It was then that Robert, with a radiant smile of triumph that was quite  wasted in the darkness, where, of course, no one could see anything,  drew out of his pocket a box of matches, struck a match and lighted a  candle--two candles. And every one, with its mouth open, blinked at the  sudden light.    'Well done Bobs,' said his sisters, and even Cyril's natural brotherly  feelings could not check his admiration of Robert's foresight.    'I've always carried them about ever since the lone tower day,' said  Robert, with modest pride. 'I knew we should want them some day. I kept  the secret well, didn't I?'    'Oh, yes,' said Cyril, with fine scorn. 'I found them the Sunday after,  when I was feeling in your Norfolks for the knife you borrowed off me.  But I thought you'd only sneaked them for Chinese lanterns, or reading  in bed by.'    'Bobs,' said Anthea, suddenly, 'do you know where we are? This is  the underground passage, and look there--there's the money and the  money-bags, and everything.'    By this time the ten eyes had got used to the light of the candles, and  no one could help seeing that Anthea spoke the truth.    'It seems an odd place to do good and kind acts in, though,' said Jane.  'There's no one to do them to.'    'Don't you be too sure,' said Cyril; 'just round the next turning we  might find a prisoner who has languished here for years and years, and  we could take him out on our carpet and restore him to his sorrowing  friends.'    'Of course we could,' said Robert, standing up and holding the candle  above his head to see further off; 'or we might find the bones of a  poor prisoner and take them to his friends to be buried properly--that's  always a kind action in books, though I never could see what bones  matter.'    'I wish you wouldn't,' said Jane.    'I know exactly where we shall find the bones, too,' Robert went on.  'You see that dark arch just along the passage? Well, just inside  there--'    'If you don't stop going on like that,' said Jane, firmly, 'I shall  scream, and then I'll faint--so now then!'    'And _I_ will, too,' said Anthea.    Robert was not pleased at being checked in his flight of fancy.    'You girls will never be great writers,' he said bitterly. 'They just  love to think of things in dungeons, and chains, and knobbly bare human  bones, and--'    Jane had opened her mouth to scream, but before she could decide how you  began when you wanted to faint, the golden voice of the Phoenix spoke  through the gloom.    'Peace!' it said; 'there are no bones here except the small but useful  sets that you have inside you. And you did not invite me to come out  with you to hear you talk about bones, but to see you do some good"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8390"],[0,"Buddhism and Buddhists in China (#17)"],[1,"     15.
