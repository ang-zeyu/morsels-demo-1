L'infini d'en bas me repousse et me  terrifie; l'infini d'en haut m'attire et m'affermit.    Je suis suspendu au-dessus de l'abîme sur la dernière lisière qui n'ait  pas encore glissé; je sens que je suis suspendu, mais en regardant en  haut mon effroi disparaît.    Comme il arrive souvent dans les rêves, une voix me dit:    --Fais attention! le voici!    Et je regarde toujours, pendant bien, bien longtemps, l'infini céleste  et je sens qu'en me calmant je commence à me rappeler tout ce qui a  été, et je me souviens comment tout est arrivé: comment j'ai remué des  pieds, comment je fus suspendu, comment je fus terrifié et comment je  me suis sauvé de l'effroi parce que j'ai regardé en haut. Je me demande:    --Eh bien! Maintenant est-ce toujours la même chose? Ce n'est pas  que je me retourne, mais je sens de tout mon corps ce point d'appui  sur lequel je me tiens. Et voilà que je commence à voir, que je ne  suis déjà plus suspendu et que je ne tombe pas, mais que je me tiens  fermement.    Je me demande comment je me tiens, je tâtonne, je me retourne et je  vois que sous moi, juste au milieu, se trouve une lisière et que, tout  en regardant en haut, je suis couché sur elle dans l'équilibre le plus  stable et que ce n'est qu'elle seule qui me tient.    Et, comme cela arrive dans le sommeil, tout le mécanisme, à l'aide  duquel je me tiens, se représente à moi très naturellement,  compréhensiblement et indubitablement, bien qu'en réalité ce mécanisme  n'ait pas le moindre sens.    Je m'étonne même, tout en dormant, que je n'aie pas compris avant que,  sur ma tête, il y avait une tour dont la solidité est incontestable,  quoique cette tour n'ait pas de base. Puis de la tour une corde  est tendue, Dieu sait comment, mais en tout cas d'une manière très  ingénieuse et fort simple en même temps. Si l'on est couché sur cette  corde par le milieu du corps, et si l'on regarde en haut, il ne paraît  même pas qu'il puisse être question d'une chute.    Tout cela m'apparaît clairement et je suis content et tranquille.    Puis quelqu'un me dit:    --Prends garde; rappelle-toi.    Et je me réveillai.    1882.      FIN.

We lived a few days on  these rations and all seemed content.    One day Brother Hampton and I were out and on returning to the fort  we learned that a small herd of buffalo had been seen passing within  three miles of the fort. All hands were excited, as they were the first  seen for a long time. The boys were all sure that Ben and I could get  meat and we could again go to feasting. We started out and soon came in  sight of the buffalo feeding. We dismounted and crept close to them,  but just as we got in shooting distance it commenced to snow so hard  that we could not see to shoot with any certainty. We sat there trying  to get sight of a buffalo until our fingers were too much benumbed to  hold our guns. I had brought an extra gun in anticipation of having  to chase the buffalo on horseback. We concluded to blaze away, hit or  miss, and then take to our horses and have a running shot. At the crack  of our guns all the herd ran away. We mounted and started in pursuit.    The horse I was riding could easily outrun the buffalo, but for the  life of me I could not get him up along side of one. When I would  follow straight behind he would get within about twenty-five yards,  but when I would try to get him up nearer he would bolt and run off to  one side. This game we kept up for some time. Occasionally the buffalo  would get two or three hundred yards away from me, when the horse would  start in after them and soon run up to about the same distance, then he  would bolt again. I felt almost like blowing his brains out. I finally  commenced shooting at the buffalo, but to no purpose. As none were  killed we had to give up the chase and go home without meat, feeling  quite chagrined.    We had not been in camp long until I was informed that there was a  great dissatisfaction being manifested by some of the company about the  rations. I immediately called the company together to see what was the  trouble. Several expressed themselves quite freely, finding fault for  being rationed when provisions could now be had, and saying that they  thought I ought to go and get something to eat and not have them suffer  any more. This grieved me very much as I had a kindly feeling towards  all the company. We had suffered everything that men could suffer and  live. We had often been on the point of starvation. Sometimes becoming  so weak that we could scarcely get our firewood, having to go some  distance to the mountain for it. We were now all in good health and  had, as I understood, willingly agreed to be rationed for a few days,  until relief came from Salt Lake City. I did not care so much for the  trouble of going for provisions, but I felt a great deal of pride in  the grit of the company and this was a sore disappointment for me, for  no one had just reason to find fault. All I said was, \"Well, brethren,  I will go and get you all you want. Now pitch in and eat your fill. I  will have more by the time you eat up what is on hand.\"    Brother Hampton felt very indignant at the faultfinders. He told them  that they would soon be ashamed of themselves; spoke of the hardships  we had endured uncomplainingly, and of the hard labors in hunting, and  many efforts made to keep alive. Now when we were about through and  no one suffering, some had shown their true colors, and marred their  credit for being true men. Ben got warm and finally said, \"You will  regret this. Instead of having to wait twelve days there will be plenty  of provisions here inside of twelve hours, and then you will wish you  had kept still.\" At this he ceased talking, sat down and turned to me  saying a little excitedly, \"What do think? Will it come?\"    I said \"Yes,\" for I felt the prophecy would be fulfilled. Sure enough  that same evening twenty men arrived at our camp bringing nearly a ton  of flour and other provisions.    This company had been sent to strengthen our post. They informed us  that there was a large company of apostates on the road led by Tom  S. Williams. Before leaving Salt Lake some of this company had made  threats that indicated danger to us.    The circumstances leading to the threats were these. The goods we were  guarding belonged to the last season's emigrants. The wagon companies  freighting them through agreed to deliver them in Salt Lake City.  These goods were to be taken in and delivered as by contract. Some of  the owners had become dissatisfied with \"Mormonism\" and were going  back to the States. As their goods had not arrived in Salt Lake City,  they demanded that they should be delivered at Devil's Gate. Quite a  number settled their freight bills and brought orders for their goods  and received them all right. Others refused to settle, but threatened  that if the goods were not given up they would take them by force. Tom  Williams' company was composed largely of this class and their backers.  They numbered about fifty men. The twenty men coming to our relief were  sent under the emergency. This is the way Brother Hampton's prophecy  came to be fulfilled.    Tom Williams knew nothing of this company, as they had slipped out  and got ahead of him and arrived long enough before him for us to get  everything ready. We now had forty men well armed, the twenty sent us  being picked for the occasion. As I cannot remember all their names  I will simply say for the purpose they were all first-class men. Our  old company were reliable. As Ben had said they would be, they were a  little ashamed, but nothing farther was said, and the boys showed their  repentance by doing their duties now.    Our instructions were to deliver no goods to anyone unless they  presented an order from the right parties.    When Williams' company arrived they made camp near our fort. Most of  our men were kept out of sight. There were rooms each side of the front  door, where we had a guard placed.    A person that claimed a lot of goods had come on the evening before and  presented an order that was not genuine. He had reported to his friends  our refusing to let him have his goods. Soon Williams and a few others  came up and said if we did not give up the goods that they would tear  down the fort or have them. Williams was well known to most of us; by  marriage he was my wife's uncle. I informed him that we intended to  obey instructions. He raved and threatened considerable, but to no  purpose. He started to his camp with the avowed intention of returning  and taking the goods.    I now got my company ready for fight if necessary We had prepared port  holes in front of the fort and here I stationed some of the best shots.    Brothers Hampton and Alexander took charge of our company. The company  that came to strengthen us working together under their leader. Soon we  saw Tom Williams approaching with his backers. As he supposed double  our number, but in reality near the same. I did not wish blood shed,  and fully believed that Tom was playing a \"bluff,\" so concluded to try  and beat him at the game. I instructed some of the best marksmen what  to do in case shooting had to be done.    As Williams approached I went out alone and stood about thirty yards  from the fort, having only my pistol. As the company came up near me  I placed my hand on my pistol and told them to halt. They halted but  commenced to threaten and abuse the whole fraternity sparing none. I  explained our situation, being simply custodians of the goods, not  knowing whose they were; but only knew who left us there, and we could  not consistently recognize any orders except from those under whose  instructions we were acting. My reasoning had no effect whatever, but  Tom called on his crowd to say if the goods should be taken. The vote  was to take them.    Now that no one may suppose that I wish to appear brave, I will say  that the way I had my men placed, and the instructions given, if a  weapon had been drawn on me, half Williams' company would have been  shot dead before I could have been harmed.    I said to Williams just hold on one minute and hear what I have to  say: \"We have been here all winter eating poor beef and raw hide to  take care of these goods. We have had but little fun, and would just  as soon have some now as not; in fact would like a little row. If you  think you can take the fort just try it. But I don't think you can take  me to commence with; and the first one that offers any violence to me  is a dead man. Now I dare you to go past me towards the fort.\" This  seemed to take them back. I meant what I said, and some of them knew my  disposition, which in those days, was not the most Christian-like when  a white man was before me as an enemy.    After looking at me a moment Tom said, \"For your family's sake I will  spare you, for I think you d----d fool enough to die before you would  give up the goods.\" I thanked him and said I believed as he did.    After this we had no more trouble. Many times I have thought I should  have shown our force openly to have deterred Williams, but he was such  a known bully and so conceited that I felt just like \"taking him down a  notch,\" and this did it.        CHAPTER XIX.    Ample Food Supplies Arrive--I go to Salt Lake City--My report to  President Young--He approves it--I am accused of Stealing--My  vindication.    The wagons being sent out for the goods soon began to arrive.  Provisions were not in question now, as we had plenty. There was also  a big Y. X. company, Levi Stewart in charge, going down to stock the  road, and a company of Elders traveling with hand-carts came through  from Salt Lake City. It was about one week from the first arrival until  the last of these arrived.    President Young had sent me several letters containing instructions  of various kinds pertaining to my duties; but one particular letter  of definite instructions how to arrange many things, had not arrived.  I kept waiting for it, as there were many things to do that I had no"]]]
