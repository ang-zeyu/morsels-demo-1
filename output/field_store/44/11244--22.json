If we see a  poor man, we say, He is wretched; he has nothing to eat.    We ought then to eradicate these bad opinions, and to this end we should  direct all our efforts. For what is weeping and lamenting? Opinion. What  is bad fortune? Opinion. What is civil sedition, what is divided  opinion, what is blame, what is accusation, what is impiety, what is  trifling? All these things are opinions, and nothing more, and opinions  about things independent of the will, as if they were good and bad. Let  a man transfer these opinions to things dependent on the will, and I  engage for him that he will be firm and constant, whatever may be the  state of things around him. Such as is a dish of water, such is the  soul. Such as is the ray of light which falls on the water, such are the  appearances. When the water is moved, the ray also seems to be moved,  yet it is not moved. And when then a man is seized with giddiness, it is  not the arts and the virtues which are confounded, but the spirit (the  nervous power) on which they are impressed; but if the spirit be  restored to its settled state, those things also are restored.           *       *       *       *       *    MISCELLANEOUS.--When some person asked him how it happened that since  reason has been more cultivated by the men of the present age, the  progress made in former times was greater. In what respect, he answered,  has it been more cultivated now, and in what respect was the progress  greater then? For in that in which it has now been more cultivated, in  that also the progress will now be found. At present it has been  cultivated for the purpose of resolving syllogisms, and progress is  made. But in former times it was cultivated for the purpose of  maintaining the governing faculty in a condition conformable to nature,  and progress was made. Do not then mix things which are different, and  do not expect, when you are laboring at one thing to make progress in  another. But see if any man among us when he is intent upon this, the  keeping himself in a state conformable to nature and living so always,  does not make progress. For you will not find such a man.    It is not easy to exhort weak young men; for neither is it easy to hold  (soft) cheese with a hook. But those who have a good natural  disposition, even if you try to turn them aside, cling still more to  reason.           *       *       *       *       *    TO THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE FREE CITIES WHO WAS AN EPICUREAN.--When the  administrator came to visit him, and the man was an Epicurean, Epictetus  said, It is proper for us who are not philosophers to inquire of you who  are philosophers, as those who come to a strange city inquire of the  citizens and those who are acquainted with it, what is the best thing in  the world, in order that we also after inquiry may go in quest of that  which is best and look at it, as strangers do with the things in cities.  For that there are three things which relate to man--soul, body, and  things external, scarcely any man denies. It remains for you  philosophers to answer what is the best. What shall we say to men? Is  the flesh the best? and was it for this that Maximus sailed as far as  Cassiope in winter (or bad weather) with his son, and accompanied him  that he might be gratified in the flesh? When the man said that it was  not, and added, Far be that from him. Is it not fit then, Epictetus  said, to be actively employed about the best? It is certainly of all  things the most fit. What then do we possess which is better than the  flesh? The soul, he replied. And the good things of the best, are they  better, or the good things of the worse? The good things of the best.  And are the good things of the best within the power of the will or not  within the power of the will? They are within the power of the will. Is  then the pleasure of the soul a thing within the power of the will? It  is, he replied. And on what shall this pleasure depend? On itself? But  that cannot be conceived; for there must first exist a certain substance  or nature ([Greek: ousia]) of good, by obtaining which we shall have  pleasure in the soul. He assented to this also. On what then shall we  depend for this pleasure of the soul? for if it shall depend on things  of the soul, the substance (nature) of the good is discovered; for good  cannot be one thing, and that at which we are rationally delighted  another thing; nor if that which precedes is not good, can that which  comes after be good, for in order that the thing which comes after may  be good, that which precedes must be good. But you would not affirm  this, if you are in your right mind, for you would then say what is  inconsistent both with Epicurus and the rest of your doctrines. It  remains then that the pleasure of the soul is in the pleasure from  things of the body; and again that those bodily things must be the  things which precede and the substance (nature) of the good.    Seek for doctrines which are consistent with what I say, and by making  them your guide you will with pleasure abstain from things which have  such persuasive power to lead us and overpower us. But if to the  persuasive power of these things, we also devise such a philosophy as  this which helps to push us on towards them and strengthens us to this  end, what will be the consequence? In a piece of toreutic art which is  the best part? the silver or the workmanship? The substance of the hand  is the flesh; but the work of the hand is the principal part (that which  precedes and leads the rest). The duties then are also three: those  which are directed towards the existence of a thing; those which are  directed towards its existence in a particular kind; and third, the  chief or leading things themselves. So also in man we ought not to value  the material, the poor flesh, but the principal (leading things, [Greek:  ta proaegoumena]). What are these? Engaging in public business,  marrying, begetting children, venerating God, taking care of parents,  and generally, having desires, aversions ([Greek: echchlinein]),  pursuits of things and avoidances, in the way in which we ought to do  these things, and according to our nature. And how are we constituted by  nature? Free, noble, modest; for what other animal blushes? what other  is capable of receiving the appearance (the impression) of shame? and we  are so constituted by nature as to subject pleasure to these things, as  a minister, a servant, in order that it may call forth our activity, in  order that it may keep us constant in acts which are conformable to  nature.           *       *       *       *       *    HOW WE MUST EXERCISE OURSELVES AGAINST APPEARANCES ([Greek:  phantasias]).--As we exercise ourselves against sophistical questions,  so we ought to exercise ourselves daily against appearances; for these  appearances also propose questions to us. A certain person's son is  dead. Answer; the thing is not within the power of the will: it is not  an evil. A father has disinherited a certain son. What do you think of  it? It is a thing beyond the power of the will, not an evil. Caesar has  condemned a person. It is a thing beyond the power of the will, not an  evil. The man is afflicted at this. Affliction is a thing which depends  on the will: it is an evil. He has borne the condemnation bravely. That  is a thing within the power of the will: it is a good. If we train  ourselves in this manner, we shall make progress; for we shall never  assent to anything of which there is not an appearance capable of being  comprehended. Your son is dead. What has happened? Your son is dead.  Nothing more? Nothing. Your ship is lost. What has happened? Your ship  is lost. A man has been led to prison. What has happened? He has been  led to prison. But that herein he has fared badly, every man adds from  his own opinion. But Zeus, you say, does not do right in these matters.  Why? because he has made you capable of endurance? because he has made  you magnanimous? because he has taken from that which befalls you the  power of being evils? because it is in your power to be happy while you  are suffering what you suffer? because he has opened the door to you,  when things do not please you? Man, go out and do not complain!    Hear how the Romans feel towards philosophers, if you would like to  know. Italicus, who was the most in repute of the philosophers, once  when I was present, being vexed with his own friends and as if he was  suffering something intolerable, said: \"I cannot bear it, you are  killing me; you will make me such as that man is,\" pointing to me.           *       *       *       *       *    TO A CERTAIN RHETORICIAN WHO WAS GOING UP TO ROME ON A SUIT.--When a  certain person came to him, who was going up to Rome on account of a  suit which had regard to his rank, Epictetus inquired the reason of his  going to Rome, and the man then asked what he thought about the matter.  Epictetus replied: If you ask me what you will do in Rome, whether you  will succeed or fail, I have no rule ([Greek: theoraema]) about this.  But if you ask me how you will fare, I can tell you: if you have right  opinions ([Greek: dogmata]), you will fare well; if they are false, you  will fare ill. For to every man the cause of his acting is opinion. For  what is the reason why you desired to be elected governor of the  Cnossians? Your opinion. What is the reason that you are now going up to  Rome? Your opinion. And going in winter, and with danger and expense? I  must go. What tells you this? Your opinion. Then if opinions are the  causes of all actions, and a man has bad opinions, such as the cause may  be, such also is the effect! Have we then all sound opinions, both you  and your adversary? And how do you differ? But have you sounder opinions  than your adversary? Why? You think so. And so does he think that his  opinions are better; and so do madmen. This is a bad criterion. But show  to me that you have "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10662"],[0,"The Night Land (#18)"],[1," to a  strange place.    Then came there a great roar from all the millions that spied from the  embrasures--from nigh five hundred thousand embrasures they did look,  and I count not the great View-Tables. And the shouting rose up like to  the roaring of a mighty wind of triumph, yet was it over-early to sound  for victory. For the counter-force which came from the intensity of so  many wills blent to one intent, was brake, and the Evil Force which came  forth out of the House did draw the Youths again; so that they heeded  not their salvation; but turned once again to their running.    And the Mighty Pyramid was full of a shaken silence, and immediately of  lamentation and sorrow and horror at this thing. But in that moment  there did happen a fresh wonder; for there grew suddenly before those  poor Youths, billows of mist--as it had been of pure white fire, shining  very chill; yet giving no light upon them.    And the mist of cold fire stayed their way, so that we had knowledge  that there fought for the souls of them, one of those sweet Powers of  Goodness, which we had belief did strive to ward our spirits at all  times from those Forces of Evil and Destruction. And all the millions  saw the thing; but some with a great clearness, and many doubtful; yet  were all advanced more in spiritual sight and hearing than the normal  Peoples of this Age.    But of them all, none had the Night-Hearing, to know a soul having  speech in the aether half across the world. Yet, as I have said, some  there had been aforetime who were thus given the Hearing, even as was I.    And there came a Monstruwacan to the Master Monstruwacan to make report  that the Influence had ceased to work upon the Instruments; and by this  thing we knew that in verity the Force which proceeded out from the  House of Silence was cut off from us, and from those Youths; and we had  assurance that there fought a very mighty Power for the salvation of the  souls of the Youths.    And all the Peoples were silent, save for an underbreath of wonder and  talk; for all were utter stirred with hope and fear, perceiving that the  Youths had some chance given unto them to return.    And whilst the Youths yet wavered in their minds, as I perceived with  the Great Spy-Glass, and the knowledge of my soul, and of my natural  wit, lo! the Master Monstruwacan sent once more the great Voice of the  Home-Call abroad into the Land; and immediately besought those Youths  for the sake of their souls and the love which their Mothers had for  them, to come swiftly Homewards, whilst they had yet this great Power  to shield them, and allow them sweet sanity.    And I thought that some did look towards the Pyramid, as that they  answered to the mighty Voice of the Home-Call, and did read the message  which the Master Monstruwacan made to them. But in a moment they faced  about, seeming to have a good obedience to one who did always lead; and  of whom I had inquired, and found to be one named Aschoff, who was a  great athlete of the Nine-Hundredth-City. And this same Aschoff, out of  the boldness and bravery of his heart, did make, unwitting, to destroy  the souls of them all; for he went forward and leapt into the billows of  the bright shining fire that made a Barrier in the way of their  Destruction.    And immediately the fire ceased from its shining, and gave way and sank  and grew to a nothingness; and Aschoff of the Nine-Hundredth-City began  again to run towards the House of Silence; and all they that were with  him, did follow faithfully, and ceased not to run.    And they came presently to the low Hill whereon was that horrid House;  and they went up swiftly--and they were two hundred and fifty, and  wholesome of heart, and innocent; save for a natural waywardness of  spirit.    And they came to the great open doorway that \"hath been open since the  Beginning,\" and through which the cold steadfast light and the  inscrutable silence of Evil \"hath made for ever a silence that may be  felt in all the Land.\" And the great, uncased windows gave out the  silence and the light--aye, the utter silence of an unholy desolation.    And Aschoff ran in through the great doorway of silence, and they that  followed. And they nevermore came out or were seen by any human.    And it must be known that the Mothers and the Fathers of those Youths  looked out into the Night Land, and saw that thing which came to pass.    And all the people were silent; but some said presently that the Youths  would come forth again; yet the people knew in their hearts that the  young men had gone in to Destruction; for, in truth, there was that in  the night which spoke horror to the souls of all, and a sudden utter  quiet in all the Land.    But unto me (that had the Night-Hearing) there came a great Fear of that  which might be whispered into my spirit, out of the Quietness of the  night--of the agony of those young men. Yet there came no sound, to the  hearing of the soul; neither then nor in all the years that were to  come; for, in verity, had those Youths passed into a Silence of which  the heart cannot think.    And here will I tell how that the strange Quiet which did fill all the  Land, seeming to brood within the night, was horrid beyond all the  roarings which had passed over the darkness in the time that went  before; so that it had given my spirit some rest and assurance to hear  but the far-echoing, low thunder of the Great Laughter, or the whining  which was used at times to sound in the night from the South-East, where  were the Silver-fire Holes that opened before the Thing that Nods. Or  the Baying of the Hounds, or the Roaring of the Giants, or any of those  dreadful sounds that did often pass through the night. For they could  not have offended me as did that time of silence; and so shall you judge  how dreadful was that quiet, which did hold so much of horror.    And surely it will be known that none had thinkings now, even in idle  speech, that any should have power to succour the Peoples of the Lesser  Redoubt. Neither, as I have said, had any the knowledge of the place  where it did stand.    And so was it made plain that those Peoples must suffer and come  unhelped and alone to their end; which was a sad and dreadful thought to  any. Yet had those within the Great Pyramid come already to much sorrow  and calamity because that some had made attempt in this matter. And  there had been for gain, only failure, and the sorrow of Mothers, and  the loneliness of Wives, and of kin. And now this dread horror upon us,  which concerned those lost Youths.    Now, as may be conceived, this _sure knowledge_ that we might give no  succour to the People of the Lesser Redoubt, weighed heavy upon my  heart; for I had, maybe with foolishness, held vague hopes and wonders  concerning our power to make expedition secretly into the Night, to  discover that Lesser Pyramid, and rescue those poor thousands; and above  all, as may be thought, had I the thought of that sweet moment in which  I should step forward out of the night and all mystery and terror, and  put forth mine arms to Naani, saying: \"I am That One.\" And knowing, in  my soul, that she that had been mine in that bygone Eternity, should  surely know me upon the instant; and call out swiftly, and come swiftly,  and be again unto me in that age, even as she had been in this.    And to think upon it, and to know that this thing should never be; but  that, even in that moment of thought, she that had been mine in these  olden days of sweetness, might be even then suffering horror in the  Power of some foul Monster, was like a kind of madness; so that nearly I  could seize the Diskos, and run forth unprepared into the evil and  terror of the Night Land, that I should make one attempt to come to that  Place where she abode, or else to cast off my life in the attempt.    And oft did I call to Naani; and always I sent the Master-Word beating  through the night, that she might have assurance that it was indeed I  that did speak unto her spirit, and no foul thing or Monster, spelling  evil and lies unto her.    And oft did I make to instruct her that never should she be tempted  forth from the shelter of that Redoubt in which she did live, by any  message out of the night; but always to await the Master-Word; and,  moreover, to have a sure knowledge that none that was her Friend would  ever seek to entice her into the night.    And this way and that way would I speak with Naani, sending my words  silently with my brain-elements; yet was it doleful and weariful and  dreadful always to have speech into the dark, and never to hear the  answering beat of the Master-Word, and the sweet, faint voice whispering  within my soul. Yet, once and again, would I have knowledge that the  aether did thrill about me, weakly, and to mine inward hearing it would  seem that the Master-Word did beat faintly in the night; and thereafter  would my heart have a little comfort, in that I had assurance, of a  kind, that the love-maid of my memory-dreams did still live.    And constant, I put forth my soul to hark; so that my health failed me,  with the effort of my harking; and I would chide my being, that I had  not a wiser control; and so make a fight to do sanely.    Yet, day by day, did my heart grow more weary and restless; for, indeed,  it did seem that life was but a very little matter, against so great a  loss as my heart did feel to suffer.    And oft, at this time and that, did there come a Voice speaking plainly  out of the night, and did purport to be the voice of Naani; but ever I  did say the Master-Word unto the Voice, and the Voice had no power by  which it could make the one answer. Yet I jeered not at the Voice, to  show contempt of its failing to bewit me; but let the matter bide; and  the Voice would be silent a time; and again would make a calling unto  me; but never did I make speech with it (for therein lies the danger to  the soul), but always"]]]
