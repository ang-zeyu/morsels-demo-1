I was  introduced by one of the canons to the curator of the local museum, who  was, my friend said, more likely to be able to give me information on the  point than anyone else. I told this gentleman of the description of  certain carved figures and arms formerly on the stalls, and asked whether  any had survived. He was able to show me the arms of Dean West and some  other fragments. These, he said, had been got from an old resident, who  had also once owned a figure--perhaps one of those which I was inquiring  for. There was a very odd thing about that figure, he said. 'The old man  who had it told me that he picked it up in a woodyard, whence he had  obtained the still extant pieces, and had taken it home for his children.  On the way home he was fiddling about with it and it came in two in his  hands, and a bit of paper dropped out. This he picked up and, just  noticing that there was writing on it, put it into his pocket, and  subsequently into a vase on his mantelpiece. I was at his house not very  long ago, and happened to pick up the vase and turn it over to see  whether there were any marks on it, and the paper fell into my hand. The  old man, on my handing it to him, told me the story I have told you, and  said I might keep the paper. It was crumpled and rather torn, so I have  mounted it on a card, which I have here. If you can tell me what it means  I shall be very glad, and also, I may say, a good deal surprised.'    He gave me the card. The paper was quite legibly inscribed in an old  hand, and this is what was on it:      When I grew in the Wood    I was water'd w'th Blood    Now in the Church I stand    Who that touches me with his Hand    If a Bloody hand he bear    I councell him to be ware    Lest he be fetcht away    Whether by night or day,    But chiefly when the wind blows high    In a night of February.  This I drempt, 26 Febr. Anno 1699. JOHN AUSTIN.    'I suppose it is a charm or a spell: wouldn't you call it something of  that kind?' said the curator.    'Yes,' I said, 'I suppose one might. What became of the figure in which  it was concealed?'    'Oh, I forgot,' said he. 'The old man told me it was so ugly and  frightened his children so much that he burnt it.'          MARTIN'S CLOSE    Some few years back I was staying with the rector of a parish in the  West, where the society to which I belong owns property. I was to go over  some of this land: and, on the first morning of my visit, soon after  breakfast, the estate carpenter and general handyman, John Hill, was  announced as in readiness to accompany us. The rector asked which part of  the parish we were to visit that morning. The estate map was produced,  and when we had showed him our round, he put his finger on a particular  spot. 'Don't forget,' he said, 'to ask John Hill about Martin's Close  when you get there. I should like to hear what he tells you.' 'What ought  he to tell us?' I said. 'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the rector,  'or, if that is not exactly true, it will do till lunch-time.' And here  he was called away.    We set out; John Hill is not a man to withhold such information as he  possesses on any point, and you may gather from him much that is of  interest about the people of the place and their talk. An unfamiliar  word, or one that he thinks ought to be unfamiliar to you, he will  usually spell--as c-o-b cob, and the like. It is not, however, relevant  to my purpose to record his conversation before the moment when we  reached Martin's Close. The bit of land is noticeable, for it is one of  the smallest enclosures you are likely to see--a very few square yards,  hedged in with quickset on all sides, and without any gate or gap leading  into it. You might take it for a small cottage garden long deserted, but  that it lies away from the village and bears no trace of cultivation. It  is at no great distance from the road, and is part of what is there  called a moor, in other words, a rough upland pasture cut up into largish  fields.    'Why is this little bit hedged off so?' I asked, and John Hill (whose  answer I cannot represent as perfectly as I should like) was not at  fault. 'That's what we call Martin's Close, sir: 'tes a curious thing  'bout that bit of land, sir: goes by the name of Martin's Close, sir.  M-a-r-t-i-n Martin. Beg pardon, sir, did Rector tell you to make inquiry  of me 'bout that, sir?' 'Yes, he did.' 'Ah, I thought so much, sir. I was  tell'n Rector 'bout that last week, and he was very much interested. It  'pears there's a murderer buried there, sir, by the name of Martin. Old  Samuel Saunders, that formerly lived yurr at what we call South-town,  sir, he had a long tale 'bout that, sir: terrible murder done 'pon a  young woman, sir. Cut her throat and cast her in the water down yurr.'  'Was he hung for it?' 'Yes, sir, he was hung just up yurr on the roadway,  by what I've 'eard, on the Holy Innocents' Day, many 'undred years ago,  by the man that went by the name of the bloody judge: terrible red and  bloody, I've 'eard.' 'Was his name Jeffreys, do you think?' 'Might be  possible 'twas--Jeffreys--J-e-f--Jeffreys. I reckon 'twas, and the tale  I've 'eard many times from Mr Saunders,--how this young man  Martin--George Martin--was troubled before his crule action come to light  by the young woman's sperit.' 'How was that, do you know?' 'No, sir, I  don't exactly know how 'twas with it: but by what I've 'eard he was  fairly tormented; and rightly tu. Old Mr Saunders, he told a history  regarding a cupboard down yurr in the New Inn. According to what he  related, this young woman's sperit come out of this cupboard: but I don't  racollact the matter.'    This was the sum of John Hill's information. We passed on, and in due  time I reported what I had heard to the Rector. He was able to show me  from the parish account-books that a gibbet had been paid for in 1684,  and a grave dug in the following year, both for the benefit of George  Martin; but he was unable to suggest anyone in the parish, Saunders being  now gone, who was likely to throw any further light on the story.    Naturally, upon my return to the neighbourhood of libraries, I made  search in the more obvious places. The trial seemed to be nowhere  reported. A newspaper of the time, and one or more news-letters, however,  had some short notices, from which I learnt that, on the ground of local  prejudice against the prisoner (he was described as a young gentleman of  a good estate), the venue had been moved from Exeter to London; that  Jeffreys had been the judge, and death the sentence, and that there had  been some 'singular passages' in the evidence. Nothing further transpired  till September of this year. A friend who knew me to be interested in  Jeffreys then sent me a leaf torn out of a second-hand bookseller's  catalogue with the entry: JEFFREYS, JUDGE: _Interesting old MS. trial for  murder_, and so forth, from which I gathered, to my delight, that I could  become possessed, for a very few shillings, of what seemed to be a  verbatim report, in shorthand, of the Martin trial. I telegraphed for the  manuscript and got it. It was a thin bound volume, provided with a title  written in longhand by someone in the eighteenth century, who had also  added this note: 'My father, who took these notes in court, told me that  the prisoner's friends had made interest with Judge Jeffreys that no  report should be put out: he had intended doing this himself when times  were better, and had shew'd it to the Revd Mr Glanvil, who incourag'd his  design very warmly, but death surpriz'd them both before it could be  brought to an accomplishment.'    The initials W. G. are appended; I am advised that the original reporter  may have been T. Gurney, who appears in that capacity in more than one  State trial.    This was all that I could read for myself. After no long delay I heard of  someone who was capable of deciphering the shorthand of the seventeenth  century, and a little time ago the typewritten copy of the whole  manuscript was laid before me. The portions which I shall communicate  here help to fill in the very imperfect outline which subsists in the  memories of John Hill and, I suppose, one or two others who live on the  scene of the events.    The report begins with a species of preface, the general effect of which  is that the copy is not that actually taken in court, though it is a true  copy in regard to the notes of what was said; but that the writer has  added to it some 'remarkable passages' that took place during the trial,  and has made this present fair copy of the whole, intending at some  favourable time to publish it; but has not put it into longhand, lest it  should fall into the possession of unauthorized persons, and he or his  family be deprived of the profit.    The report then begins:    This case came on to be tried on Wednesday, the 19th of November, between  our sovereign lord the King, and George Martin Esquire, of (I take leave  to omit some of the place-names), at a sessions of oyer and terminer and  gaol delivery, at the Old Bailey, and the prisoner, being in Newgate, was  brought to the bar.    _Clerk of the Crown._ George Martin, hold up thy hand (which he did).    Then the indictment was read, which set forth that the prisoner, 'not  having the fear of God before his eyes, but being moved and seduced by  the instigation of the devil, upon the 15th day of May, in the 36th year  of our sovereign lord King Charles the Second, with force and arms in the  parish aforesaid, in and upon Ann Clark, spinster, of the same place, in  the peace of God and of our said sovereign lord the King then and there  being, feloniously, wilfully, and of your malice aforethought did make an  assault and with a certain knife value a penny the throat of the said Ann  Clark then and there did cut, of the which wound the said Ann Clark then"]]]
