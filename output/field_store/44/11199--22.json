And Ra said unto Horus of Heben, \"O Winged Disk, thou great god  and lord of heaven, seize thou them . . . . . .;\" and he hurled his  lance after them, and he slew them, and worked a great overthrow of  them.  And he brought one hundred and forty-two enemies to the forepart  of the Boat [of Ra], and with them was a male hippopotamus which had  been among those enemies.  And he hacked them in pieces with his knife,  and he gave their entrails to those who were in his following, and he  gave their carcases to the gods and goddesses who were in the Boat of  Ra on the river-bank of the city of Heben.  Then Ra said unto Thoth,  \"See what mighty things Heru-Behutet hath performed in his deeds  against the enemies: verily he hath smitten them!  And of the male  hippopotamus he hath opened the mouth, and he hath speared it, and he  hath mounted upon its back.\"  Then said Thoth to Ra, \"Horus shall be  called 'Winged Disk, Great God, Smiter of the enemies in the town of  Heben' from this day forward, and he shall be called 'He who standeth  on the back' and 'prophet of this god,' from this day forward.\"  These  are the things which happened in the lands of the city of Heben, in a  region which measured three hundred and forty-two measures on the  south, and on the north, on the west, and on the east.        [FN#82]  The goddess Nekhebet was incarnate in a special kind of  serpent, and the centre of her worship was in the city of Nekheb, which  the Greeks called Eileithyiaspolis, and the Arabs Al-Kab.    [FN#83]  The centre of the worship of Uatchet, or Uatchit, was at Per-  Uatchet, a city in the Delta.    [FN#84]  i.e., the enemies.        XV.  Then the enemies rose up before him by the Lake of the North, and  their faces were set towards Uatch-ur[FN#85] which they desired to  reach by sailing; but the god smote their hearts and they turned and  fled in the water, and they directed their course to the water of the  nome of Mertet-Ament, and they gathered themselves together in the  water of Mertet in order to join themselves with the enemies [who  serve] Set and who are in this region.  And Heru-Behutet followed them,  being equipped with all his weapons of war to fight against them.  And  Heru-Behutet made a journey in the Boat of Ra, together with the great  god who was in his boat with those who were his followers, and he  pursued them on the Lake of the North twice, and passed one day and one  night sailing down the river in pursuit of them before he perceived and  overtook them, for he knew not the place where they were.  Then he  arrived at the city of Per-Rehu.  And the Majesty of Ra said unto Heru-  Behutet, \"What hath happened to the enemies?  They have gathered  together themselves in the water to the west (?) of the nome of Mertet  in order to unite themselves with the enemies [who serve] Set, and who  are in this region, at the place where are our staff and sceptre.\"  And  Thoth said unto Ra, \"Uast in the nome of Mertet is called Uaseb because  of this unto this day, and the Lake which is in it is called Tempt.\"  Then Heru-Behutet spake in the presence of his father Ra, saying, \"I  beseech thee to set thy boat against them, so that I may be able to  perform against them that which Ra willeth;\" and this was done.  Then  he made an attack upon them on the Lake which was at the west of this  district, and he perceived them on the bank of the city . . . . . .  which belongeth to the Lake of Mertet.  Then Heru-Behutet made an  expedition against them, and his followers were with him, and they were  provided with weapons of all kinds for battle, and he wrought a great  overthrow among them, and he brought in three hundred and eighty-one  enemies, and he slaughtered them in the forepart of the Boat of Ra, and  he gave one of them to each of those who were in his train.  Then Set  rose up and came forth, and raged loudly with words of cursing and  abuse because of the things which Heru-behutet had done in respect of  the slaughter of the enemies.  And Ra said unto Thoth, \"This fiend  Nehaha-hra uttereth words at the top of his voice because of the things  which Heru-Behutet hath done unto him;\" and Thoth said unto Ra, \"Cries  of this kind shall be called Nehaha-hra unto this day.\"  And Heru-  Behutet did battle with the Enemy for a period of time, and he hurled  his iron lance at him, and he throw him down on the ground in this  region, which is called Pa-Rerehtu unto this day.  Then Heru-Behutet  came and brought the Enemy with him, and his spear was in his neck, and  his chain was round his hands and arms, and the weapon of Horus had  fallen on his mouth and had closed it; and he went with him before his  father Ra, who said, \"O Horus, thou Winged Disk, twice great (Urui-  Tenten) is the deed of valour which thou hast done, and thou hast  cleansed the district.\"  And Ra, said unto Thoth, \"The palace of Heru-  Behutet shall be called, 'Lord of the district which is cleansed'  because of this;\" and [thus is it called] unto this day.  And the name  of the priest thereof is called Ur-Tenten unto this day.  And Ra said  unto Thoth, \"Let the enemies and Set be given over to Isis and her son  Horus, and let them work all their heart's desire upon them.\"  And she  and her son Horus set themselves in position with their spears in him  at the time when there was storm (or, disaster) in the district, and  the Lake of the god was called She-En-Aha from that day to this.  Then  Horus the son of Isis cut off the head of the Enemy [Set], and the  heads of his fiends in the presence of father Ra and of the great  company of the gods, and he dragged him by his feet through his  district with his spear driven through his head and back.  And Ra said  unto Thoth, \"Let the son of Osiris drag the being of disaster through  his territory;\" and Thoth said, \"It shall be called Ateh,\" and this  hath been the name of the region from that day to this.  And Isis, the  divine lady, spake before Ra, saying, \"Let the exalted Winged Disk  become the amulet of my son Horus, who hath cut off the head of the  Enemy and the heads of his fiends.\"        [FN#85]  i.e., the Mediterranean.        XVI.  Thus Heru-Behutet and Horus, the son of Isis, slaughtered that  evil Enemy, and his fiends, and the inert foes, and came forth with  them to the water on the west side of this district.  And Heru-Behutet  was in the form of a man of mighty strength, and he had the face of a  hawk, and his head was crowned with the White Crown and the Red Crown,  and with two plumes and two uraei, and he had the back of a hawk, and  his spear and his chain were in his hands.  And Horus, the son of Isis,  transformed himself into a similar shape, even as Heru-Behutet had done  before him.  And they slew the enemies all together on the west of Per-  Rehu, on the edge of the stream, and this god hath sailed over the  water wherein the enemies had banded themselves to-ether against him  from that day to this.  Now these things took place on the 7th day of  the first mouth of the season Pert.  And Thoth said, \"This region shall  be called AAT-SHATET,\" and this hath been the name of the region from  that day unto this; and the Lake which is close by it hath been called  Temt from that day to this, and the 7th day of the first month of the  season Pert hath been called the Festival of Sailing from that day to  this.      Then Set took upon himself the form of a hissing serpent, and he  entered into the earth in this district without being seen.  And Ra  said, \"Set hath taken upon himself the form of a hissing serpent.  Let  Horus, the son of Isis, in the form of a hawk-headed staff, set himself  over the place where he is, so that the serpent may never more appear.\"  And Thoth said, \"Let this district be called Hemhemet[FN#86] by name;\"  and thus hath it been called from that day to this.  And Horus, the son  of Isis, in the form of a hawk-headed staff, took up his abode there  with his mother Isis; in this manner did these things happen.        [FN#86]  This name means \"the place of the Roarer,\" Hemhemti, being a  well-known name of the Evil One.  Some texts seem to indicate that  peals of thunder were caused by the fiend Set.          Then the Boat of Ra arrived at the town of Het-Aha; its forepart was  made of palm wood, and the hind part was made of acacia wood; thus the  palm tree and the acacia tree have been sacred trees from that day to  this.  Then Heru-Behutet embarked in the Boat of Ra, after he had made  an end of fighting, and sailed; and Ra said unto Thoth, \"Let this Boat  be called . . . . . . .;\" and thus hath it been called from that day to  this, and these things have been done in commemoration in this place  from that day to this.      And Ra said unto Heru-Behutet, \"Behold the fighting of the Smait fiend  and his two-fold strength, and the Smai fiend Set, are upon the water  of the North, and they will sail down stream upon . . . . . .\" [And]  Heru-Behutet said, \"Whatsoever thou commandest shall take place, O Ra,  Lord of the gods.  Grant thou, however, that this thy Boat may pursue  them into every place whithersoever they shall go, and I will do to  them whatsoever pleaseth Ra.\"  And everything was done according to  what he had said.  Then this Boat of Ra was brought by the winged Sun-  disk upon the waters of the Lake of Meh,[FN#87] [and] Heru-Behutet took  in his hands his weapons, his darts, and his harpoon, and all the  chains [which he required] for the fight.        [FN#87]  It is probable that the Lake of Meh, i.e., the Lake of the  North, was situated in the north-east of the Delta, not far from Lake  Manzalah.          And Heru-Behutet looked and saw one [only] of these Sebau[FN#88] fiends  there on the spot, and he was by himself.  And he threw one metal dart,  and brought (or, dragged) them along straightway, and he slaughtered  them in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9457"],[0,"Travels in Arabia; comprehending an account of those territories in Hedjaz which (#17)"],[1,"miles, making in  the whole seventy-two miles. The bearing of the road from Arafat to Tayf  is about twelve or fifteen degrees of the compass, to the southward of  that from Mekka to Arafat; but having had no compass with me, I cannot  give the bearing with perfect accuracy.    [p.70] RESIDENCE AT TAYF.    I ARRIVED at Tayf about mid-day, and alighted at the house of Bosari,  the Pashas physician, with whom I had been well acquainted at Cairo. As  it was now the fast of Ramadhan, during which the Turkish grandees  always sleep in the day-time, the Pasha could not be informed of my  arrival till after sun-set. In the mean while, Bosari, after the usual  Levantine assurances of his entire devotion to my interests, and of the  sincerity of his friendship, asked me what were my views in coming to  the Hedjaz. I answered, to visit Mekka and Medina, and then to return to  Cairo. Of my intention respecting Egypt he seemed doubtful, begged me to  be candid with him as with a friend, and to declare the truth, as he  confessed that he suspected I was going to the East Indies. This I  positively denied; and in the course of our conversation, he hinted that  if I really meant to return to Egypt, I had better remain at head-  quarters with them, till the Pasha himself should proceed to Cairo.  Nothing was said about money, although Bosari was ignorant that my  pecuniary wants had been relieved at Djidda.    In the evening Bosari went privately to the Pasha at his womens  residence, where he only received visits from friends or very intimate  acquaintances. In half an hour he returned, and told me that the Pasha  wished to see me rather late that evening in his public room. He added,  that he found seated with the Pasha    [p.071] the Kadhy of Mekka, who was then at Tayf for his health; and  that the former, when he heard of my desire to visit the holy cities,  observed jocosely, it is not the beard [I wore a beard at this time, as  I did at Cairo, when the Pasha saw me.] alone which proves a man to be a  true Moslem; but turning towards the Kadhy, he said, you are a better  judge in such matters than I am. The Kadhy then observed that, as none  but a Moslem could be permitted to see the holy cities, a circumstance  of which he could not possibly suppose me ignorant, he did not believe  that I would declare myself to be one, unless I really was. When I  learnt these particulars, I told Bosari that he might return alone to  the Pasha; that my feelings had already been much hurt by the orders  given to my guide not to carry me through Mekka; and that I certainly  should not go to the Pashas public audience, if he would not receive me  as a Turk.    Bosari was alarmed at this declaration, and in vain endeavoured to  dissuade me from such a course, telling me that he had orders to conduct  me to the Pasha, which he could not disobey. I however adhered firmly to  what I had said, and he reluctantly went back to Mohammed Aly, whom he  found alone, the Kadhy having left him. When Bosari delivered his  message, the Pasha smiled, and answered that I was welcome, whether Turk  or not. About eight oclock in the evening I repaired to the castle, a  miserable, half-ruined habitation of Sherif Ghaleb, dressed in the new  suit which I had received at Djidda by the Pashas command. I found his  highness seated in a large saloon, with the Kadhy on one hand, and  Hassan Pasha, the chief of the Arnaut soldiers, on the other; thirty or  forty of his principal officers formed a half-circle about the sofa on  which they sat; and a number of Bedouin sheikhs were squatted in the  midst of the semicircle. I went up to the Pasha, gave him the Salam  Aleykum, and kissed his hand. He made a sign for me to sit down by the  side of the    [p.72] Kadhy, then addressed me very politely, inquired after my health,  and if there was any news from the Mamelouks in the Black country which  I had visited; but said nothing whatever on the subject most interesting  to me. Amyn Effendi, his Arabic dragoman, interpreted between us, as I  do not speak Turkish, and the Pasha speaks Arabic very imperfectly. In  about five minutes he renewed the business with the Bedouins, which I  had interrupted. When this was terminated, and Hassan Pasha had left the  room, every body was ordered to withdraw, except the Kadhy, Bosari, and  myself. I expected now to be put to the proof, and I was fully prepared  for it; but not a word was mentioned of my personal affairs, nor did  Mohammed Aly, in any of our subsequent conversations, ever enter further  into them than to hint that he was persuaded I was on my way to the East  Indies. As soon as we were alone, the Pasha introduced the subject of  politics. He had just received information of the entrance of the allies  into Paris, and the departure of Bonaparte for Elba; and several Malta  gazettes, giving the details of these occurrences, had been sent to him  from Cairo. He seemed deeply interested in these important events,  chiefly because he laboured under the impression that, after Bonapartes  downfall, England would probably seek for an augmentation of power in  the Mediterranean, and consequently invade Egypt.    After remaining for two or three hours with the Pasha in private  conversation, either speaking Arabic to him, through the medium of the  Kadhy, who, though a native of Constantinople, knew that language  perfectly, or Italian, through Bosari, who was an Armenian, but had  acquired a smattering of that tongue at Cairo, I took my leave, and the  Pasha said that he expected me again on the morrow at the same hour.    August 29th.--I paid a visit to the Kadhy before sun-set, and found him  with his companion and secretary, a learned man of Constantinople. The  Kadhy Sádik Effendi was a true eastern    [p.73] courtier, of very engaging manners and address, possessing all  that suavity of expression for which the well-bred natives of Stamboul  are so distinguished. After we had interchanged a few complimentary  phrases, I mentioned my astonishment on finding that the Pasha had  expressed any doubts of my being a true Moslem, after I had now been a  proselyte to that faith for so many years. He replied that Mohammed Aly  had allowed that he (the Kadhy) was the best judge in such matters; and  added, that he hoped we should become better acquainted with each other.  He then began to question me about my Nubian travels. In the course of  conversation literary subjects were introduced: he asked me what Arabic  hooks I had read, and what commentaries on the Koran and on the law; and  he probably found me better acquainted, with the titles, at least, of  such works than he had expected, for we did not enter deeply into the  subject. While we were thus conversing, the call to evening prayers  announced the termination of this days fast. I supped with the Kadhy,  and afterwards performed the evening prayers in his company, when I took  great care to chaunt as long a chapter of the Koran as my memory  furnished at the moment; after which we both went to the Pasha, who  again sat up a part of the night in private conversation with me,  chiefly on political affairs, without ever introducing the subject of my  private business.    After another interview, I went every evening, first to the Kadhy, and  then to the Pasha; but, notwithstanding a polite reception at the  castle, I could perceive that my actions were closely watched. Bosari  had asked me if I kept a journal; but I answered that the Hedjaz was not  like Egypt, full of antiquities, and that in these barren mountains I  saw nothing worthy of notice. I was never allowed to be alone for a  moment, and I had reason to suspect that Bosari, with all his assurances  of friendship, was nothing better than a spy. To remain at Tayf for an  indeterminate period, in the situation I now found myself, was little    [p.74] desirable; yet I could not guess the Pashas intentions with  respect to me. I was evidently considered in no other light than as a  spy sent to this country by the English government, to ascertain its  present state, and report upon it in the East Indies. This, I presume,  was the Pashas own opinion: he knew me as an Englishman, a name which I  assumed during my travels (I hope without any discredit to that  country), whenever it seemed necessary to appear as an European; because  at that time none but the subjects of England and France enjoyed in the  East any real security: they were considered as too well protected, both  by their governments at home and their ministers at Constantinople, to  be trifled with by provincial governors. The Pasha, moreover, supposed  me to be a man of some rank, for every Englishman travelling in the East  is styled My lord; and he was the more convinced of this by a certain  air of dignity which it was necessary for me to assume in a Turkish  court, where modesty of behaviour and affability are quite out of place.  Afraid as he then was of Great Britain, he probably thought it imprudent  to treat me ill, though he did nothing whatever to forward my projects.  As far as he knew, I could have only the five hundred piastres which he  had ordered for me at Djidda, and which were not sufficient to pay my  expenses for any length of time in the Hedjaz. Nothing was said to me  either by him or Bosari of taking my bill upon Cairo, as I had requested  him to do; but this favour I did not again solicit, having money enough  for the present, and expecting a fresh supply from Egypt.    To remain for any length of time at Tayf, in a sort of polite  imprisonment, was little to my taste; yet I could not press my departure  without increasing his suspicions. This was manifest after my first  interview with the Pasha and the Kadhy, and I knew that the reports of  Bosari might considerably influence the mind of Mohammed. Under these  circumstances, I thought the best course was to make Bosari tired of me,  and thus induce him    [p."]]]
