I had plenty to  think of, therefore, besides my mind running continually on the kind  of place I was going to--which was an awful speculation. Sometimes, I  remember, I resigned myself to thoughts of home and Peggotty; and to  endeavouring, in a confused blind way, to recall how I had felt, and  what sort of boy I used to be, before I bit Mr. Murdstone: which I  couldn't satisfy myself about by any means, I seemed to have bitten him  in such a remote antiquity.    The night was not so pleasant as the evening, for it got chilly; and  being put between two gentlemen (the rough-faced one and another) to  prevent my tumbling off the coach, I was nearly smothered by their  falling asleep, and completely blocking me up. They squeezed me so hard  sometimes, that I could not help crying out, 'Oh! If you please!'--which  they didn't like at all, because it woke them. Opposite me was an  elderly lady in a great fur cloak, who looked in the dark more like a  haystack than a lady, she was wrapped up to such a degree. This lady had  a basket with her, and she hadn't known what to do with it, for a long  time, until she found that on account of my legs being short, it could  go underneath me. It cramped and hurt me so, that it made me perfectly  miserable; but if I moved in the least, and made a glass that was in the  basket rattle against something else (as it was sure to do), she gave  me the cruellest poke with her foot, and said, 'Come, don't YOU fidget.  YOUR bones are young enough, I'm sure!'    At last the sun rose, and then my companions seemed to sleep easier.  The difficulties under which they had laboured all night, and which had  found utterance in the most terrific gasps and snorts, are not to be  conceived. As the sun got higher, their sleep became lighter, and so  they gradually one by one awoke. I recollect being very much surprised  by the feint everybody made, then, of not having been to sleep at all,  and by the uncommon indignation with which everyone repelled the  charge. I labour under the same kind of astonishment to this day, having  invariably observed that of all human weaknesses, the one to which our  common nature is the least disposed to confess (I cannot imagine why) is  the weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach.    What an amazing place London was to me when I saw it in the distance,  and how I believed all the adventures of all my favourite heroes to be  constantly enacting and re-enacting there, and how I vaguely made it  out in my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness than all the  cities of the earth, I need not stop here to relate. We approached it by  degrees, and got, in due time, to the inn in the Whitechapel district,  for which we were bound. I forget whether it was the Blue Bull, or the  Blue Boar; but I know it was the Blue Something, and that its likeness  was painted up on the back of the coach.    The guard's eye lighted on me as he was getting down, and he said at the  booking-office door:    'Is there anybody here for a yoongster booked in the name of Murdstone,  from Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, to be left till called for?'    Nobody answered.    'Try Copperfield, if you please, sir,' said I, looking helplessly down.    'Is there anybody here for a yoongster, booked in the name of Murdstone,  from Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, but owning to the name of Copperfield, to  be left till called for?' said the guard. 'Come! IS there anybody?'    No. There was nobody. I looked anxiously around; but the inquiry made no  impression on any of the bystanders, if I except a man in gaiters, with  one eye, who suggested that they had better put a brass collar round my  neck, and tie me up in the stable.    A ladder was brought, and I got down after the lady, who was like a  haystack: not daring to stir, until her basket was removed. The coach  was clear of passengers by that time, the luggage was very soon cleared  out, the horses had been taken out before the luggage, and now the coach  itself was wheeled and backed off by some hostlers, out of the way.  Still, nobody appeared, to claim the dusty youngster from Blunderstone,  Suffolk.    More solitary than Robinson Crusoe, who had nobody to look at him  and see that he was solitary, I went into the booking-office, and, by  invitation of the clerk on duty, passed behind the counter, and sat down  on the scale at which they weighed the luggage. Here, as I sat looking  at the parcels, packages, and books, and inhaling the smell of stables  (ever since associated with that morning), a procession of most  tremendous considerations began to march through my mind. Supposing  nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me  there? Would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings? Should I  sleep at night in one of those wooden bins, with the other luggage,  and wash myself at the pump in the yard in the morning; or should I  be turned out every night, and expected to come again to be left till  called for, when the office opened next day? Supposing there was no  mistake in the case, and Mr. Murdstone had devised this plan to get rid  of me, what should I do? If they allowed me to remain there until my  seven shillings were spent, I couldn't hope to remain there when I began  to starve. That would obviously be inconvenient and unpleasant to the  customers, besides entailing on the Blue Whatever-it-was, the risk of  funeral expenses. If I started off at once, and tried to walk back home,  how could I ever find my way, how could I ever hope to walk so far, how  could I make sure of anyone but Peggotty, even if I got back? If I  found out the nearest proper authorities, and offered myself to go for a  soldier, or a sailor, I was such a little fellow that it was most likely  they wouldn't take me in. These thoughts, and a hundred other such  thoughts, turned me burning hot, and made me giddy with apprehension and  dismay. I was in the height of my fever when a man entered and whispered  to the clerk, who presently slanted me off the scale, and pushed me over  to him, as if I were weighed, bought, delivered, and paid for.    As I went out of the office, hand in hand with this new acquaintance,  I stole a look at him. He was a gaunt, sallow young man, with hollow  cheeks, and a chin almost as black as Mr. Murdstone's; but there the  likeness ended, for his whiskers were shaved off, and his hair, instead  of being glossy, was rusty and dry. He was dressed in a suit of black  clothes which were rather rusty and dry too, and rather short in the  sleeves and legs; and he had a white neck-kerchief on, that was not  over-clean. I did not, and do not, suppose that this neck-kerchief was  all the linen he wore, but it was all he showed or gave any hint of.    'You're the new boy?' he said. 'Yes, sir,' I said.    I supposed I was. I didn't know.    'I'm one of the masters at Salem House,' he said.    I made him a bow and felt very much overawed. I was so ashamed to allude  to a commonplace thing like my box, to a scholar and a master at Salem  House, that we had gone some little distance from the yard before I had  the hardihood to mention it. We turned back, on my humbly insinuating  that it might be useful to me hereafter; and he told the clerk that the  carrier had instructions to call for it at noon.    'If you please, sir,' I said, when we had accomplished about the same  distance as before, 'is it far?'    'It's down by Blackheath,' he said.    'Is that far, sir?' I diffidently asked.    'It's a good step,' he said. 'We shall go by the stage-coach. It's about  six miles.'    I was so faint and tired, that the idea of holding out for six miles  more, was too much for me. I took heart to tell him that I had had  nothing all night, and that if he would allow me to buy something to  eat, I should be very much obliged to him. He appeared surprised at  this--I see him stop and look at me now--and after considering for a few  moments, said he wanted to call on an old person who lived not far off,  and that the best way would be for me to buy some bread, or whatever I  liked best that was wholesome, and make my breakfast at her house, where  we could get some milk.    Accordingly we looked in at a baker's window, and after I had made a  series of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop, and  he had rejected them one by one, we decided in favour of a nice little  loaf of brown bread, which cost me threepence. Then, at a grocer's shop,  we bought an egg and a slice of streaky bacon; which still left what  I thought a good deal of change, out of the second of the bright  shillings, and made me consider London a very cheap place. These  provisions laid in, we went on through a great noise and uproar that  confused my weary head beyond description, and over a bridge which, no  doubt, was London Bridge (indeed I think he told me so, but I was half  asleep), until we came to the poor person's house, which was a part of  some alms-houses, as I knew by their look, and by an inscription on a  stone over the gate which said they were established for twenty-five  poor women.    The Master at Salem House lifted the latch of one of a number of little  black doors that were all alike, and had each a little diamond-paned  window on one side, and another little diamond--paned window above; and  we went into the little house of one of these poor old women, who was  blowing a fire to make a little saucepan boil. On seeing the master  enter, the old woman stopped with the bellows on her knee, and said  something that I thought sounded like 'My Charley!' but on seeing me  come in too, she got up, and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of  half curtsey.    'Can you cook this young gentleman's breakfast for him, if you please?'  said the Master at Salem House.    'Can I?' said the old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/770"],[0,"The Story of the Treasure Seekers (#17)"],[1,"called to see your Pa,  miss. Is he at home?'    Alice said again, 'Will you walk in, please?'    Then the person--it sounded like a man--said, 'He is in, then?'    But Alice only kept on saying, 'Will you walk in, please?' so at last  the man did, rubbing his boots very loudly on the mat.    Then Alice shut the front door, and we saw that it was the butcher, with  an envelope in his hand. He was not dressed in blue, like when he is  cutting up the sheep and things in the shop, and he wore knickerbockers.  Alice says he came on a bicycle. She led the way into the dining-room,  where the Castilian Amoroso bottle and the medicine glass were standing  on the table all ready.    The others stayed on the stairs, but Oswald crept down and looked  through the door-crack.    'Please sit down,' said Alice quite calmly, though she told me  afterwards I had no idea how silly she felt. And the butcher sat down.  Then Alice stood quite still and said nothing, but she fiddled with  the medicine glass and put the screw of brown paper straight in the  Castilian bottle.    'Will you tell your Pa I'd like a word with him?' the butcher said, when  he got tired of saying nothing.    'He'll be in very soon, I think,' Alice said.    And then she stood still again and said nothing. It was beginning to  look very idiotic of her, and H. O. laughed. I went back and cuffed him  for it quite quietly, and I don't think the butcher heard.    But Alice did, and it roused her from her stupor. She spoke suddenly,  very fast indeed--so fast that I knew she had made up what she was going  to say before. She had got most of it out of the circular.    She said, 'I want to call your attention to a sample of sherry wine I  have here. It is called Castilian something or other, and at the price  it is unequalled for flavour and bouquet.'    The butcher said, 'Well--I never!'    And Alice went on, 'Would you like to taste it?'    'Thank you very much, I'm sure, miss,' said the butcher.    Alice poured some out.    The butcher tasted a very little. He licked his lips, and we thought  he was going to say how good it was. But he did not. He put down the  medicine glass with nearly all the stuff left in it (we put it back in  the bottle afterwards to save waste) and said, 'Excuse me, miss, but  isn't it a little sweet?--for sherry I mean?'    'The _Real_ isn't,' said Alice. 'If you order a dozen it will come quite  different to that--we like it best with sugar. I wish you _would_ order  some.' The butcher asked why.    Alice did not speak for a minute, and then she said--    'I don't mind telling _you_: you are in business yourself, aren't  you? We are trying to get people to buy it, because we shall have two  shillings for every dozen we can make any one buy. It's called a purr  something.'    'A percentage. Yes, I see,' said the butcher, looking at the hole in the  carpet.    'You see there are reasons,' Alice went on, 'why we want to make our  fortunes as quickly as we can.'    'Quite so,' said the butcher, and he looked at the place where the paper  is coming off the wall.    'And this seems a good way,' Alice went on. 'We paid two shillings for  the sample and instructions, and it says you can make two pounds a week  easily in your leisure time.'    'I'm sure I hope you may, miss,' said the butcher. And Alice said again  would he buy some?    'Sherry is my favourite wine,' he said. Alice asked him to have some  more to drink.    'No, thank you, miss,' he said; 'it's my favourite wine, but it doesn't  agree with me; not the least bit. But I've an uncle drinks it. Suppose I  ordered him half a dozen for a Christmas present? Well, miss, here's the  shilling commission, anyway,' and he pulled out a handful of money and  gave her the shilling.    'But I thought the wine people paid that,' Alice said.    But the butcher said not on half-dozens they didn't. Then he said he  didn't think he'd wait any longer for Father--but would Alice ask Father  to write him?    Alice offered him the sherry again, but he said something about 'Not  for worlds!'--and then she let him out and came back to us with the  shilling, and said, 'How's that?'    And we said 'A1.'    And all the evening we talked of our fortune that we had begun to make.    Nobody came next day, but the day after a lady came to ask for money to  build an orphanage for the children of dead sailors. And we saw her. I  went in with Alice. And when we had explained to her that we had only  a shilling and we wanted it for something else, Alice suddenly said,  'Would you like some wine?'    And the lady said, 'Thank you very much,' but she looked surprised.    She was not a young lady, and she had a mantle with beads, and the beads  had come off in places--leaving a browny braid showing, and she had  printed papers about the dead sailors in a sealskin bag, and the  seal had come off in places, leaving the skin bare. We gave her a  tablespoonful of the wine in a proper wine-glass out of the sideboard,  because she was a lady. And when she had tasted it she got up in a very  great hurry, and shook out her dress and snapped her bag shut, and said,  'You naughty, wicked children! What do you mean by playing a trick like  this? You ought to be ashamed of yourselves! I shall write to your Mamma  about it. You dreadful little girl!--you might have poisoned me. But  your Mamma...'    Then Alice said, 'I'm very sorry; the butcher liked it, only he said it  was sweet. And please don't write to Mother. It makes Father so unhappy  when letters come for her!'--and Alice was very near crying.    'What do you mean, you silly child?' said the lady, looking quite  bright and interested. 'Why doesn't your Father like your Mother to have  letters--eh?'    And Alice said, 'OH, you...!' and began to cry, and bolted out of the  room.    Then I said, 'Our Mother is dead, and will you please go away now?'    The lady looked at me a minute, and then she looked quite different, and  she said, 'I'm very sorry. I didn't know. Never mind about the wine. I  daresay your little sister meant it kindly.' And she looked round the  room just like the butcher had done. Then she said again, 'I didn't  know--I'm very sorry...'    So I said, 'Don't mention it,' and shook hands with her, and let her  out. Of course we couldn't have asked her to buy the wine after what  she'd said. But I think she was not a bad sort of person. I do like  a person to say they're sorry when they ought to be--especially a  grown-up. They do it so seldom. I suppose that's why we think so much of  it.    But Alice and I didn't feel jolly for ever so long afterwards. And when  I went back into the dining-room I saw how different it was from when  Mother was here, and we are different, and Father is different, and  nothing is like it was. I am glad I am not made to think about it every  day.    I went and found Alice, and told her what the lady had said, and when  she had finished crying we put away the bottle and said we would not try  to sell any more to people who came. And we did not tell the others--we  only said the lady did not buy any--but we went up on the Heath, and  some soldiers went by and there was a Punch-and-judy show, and when we  came back we were better.    The bottle got quite dusty where we had put it, and perhaps the dust of  ages would have laid thick and heavy on it, only a clergyman called when  we were all out. He was not our own clergyman--Mr Bristow is our own  clergyman, and we all love him, and we would not try to sell sherry  to people we like, and make two pounds a week out of them in our spare  time. It was another clergyman, just a stray one; and he asked Eliza if  the dear children would not like to come to his little Sunday school. We  always spend Sunday afternoons with Father. But as he had left the name  of his vicarage with Eliza, and asked her to tell us to come, we thought  we would go and call on him, just to explain about Sunday afternoons,  and we thought we might as well take the sherry with us.    'I won't go unless you all go too,' Alice said, 'and I won't do the  talking.'    Dora said she thought we had much better not go; but we said 'Rot!' and  it ended in her coming with us, and I am glad she did.    Oswald said he would do the talking if the others liked, and he learned  up what to say from the printed papers.    We went to the Vicarage early on Saturday afternoon, and rang at the  bell. It is a new red house with no trees in the garden, only very  yellow mould and gravel. It was all very neat and dry. Just before we  rang the bell we heard some one inside call 'Jane! Jane!' and we thought  we would not be Jane for anything. It was the sound of the voice that  called that made us sorry for her.    The door was opened by a very neat servant in black, with a white apron;  we saw her tying the strings as she came along the hall, through the  different-coloured glass in the door. Her face was red, and I think she  was Jane.    We asked if we could see Mr Mallow.    The servant said Mr Mallow was very busy with his sermon just then, but  she would see.    But Oswald said, 'It's all right. He asked us to come.'    So she let us all in and shut the front door, and showed us into a very  tidy room with a bookcase full of a lot of books covered in black cotton  with white labels, and some dull pictures, and a harmonium. And Mr  Mallow was writing at a desk with drawers, copying something out of a  book. He was stout and short, and wore spectacles.    He covered his writing up when we went in--I didn't know why. He looked  rather cross, and we heard Jane or somebody being scolded outside by the  voice. I hope it wasn't for letting us in, but I have had doubts.    'Well,' said the clergyman, 'what is all this about?'    'You asked us to call,' Dora said, 'about your little Sunday school. We  are the Bastables of Lewisham Road.'    'Oh--ah, yes,' he said; 'and shall I expect you all to-morrow?'    He took up his pen and"]]]
