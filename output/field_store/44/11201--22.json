[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#17)"],[1," I spoke a little sternly, for there is seldom harm in infusing a little  fear into a woman's liking for you, and I softened the effect by giving  her a handsome present. Then we dined, and, wrapping my cloak about  my face, with Fritz leading the way, we went downstairs to our horses  again.    It was but half-past eight, and hardly yet dark; the streets were full  for such a quiet little place, and I could see that gossip was all agog.  With the King on one side and the duke on the other, Zenda felt itself  the centre of all Ruritania. We jogged gently through the town, but set  our horses to a sharper pace when we reached the open country.    \"You want to catch this fellow Johann?\" asked Fritz.    \"Ay, and I fancy I've baited the hook right. Our little Delilah will  bring our Samson. It is not enough, Fritz, to have no women in a house,  though brother Michael shows some wisdom there. If you want safety, you  must have none within fifty miles.\"    \"None nearer than Strelsau, for instance,\" said poor Fritz, with a  lovelorn sigh.    We reached the avenue of the chateau, and were soon at the house. As the  hoofs of our horses sounded on the gravel, Sapt rushed out to meet us.    \"Thank God, you're safe!\" he cried. \"Have you seen anything of them?\"    \"Of whom?\" I asked, dismounting.    He drew us aside, that the grooms might not hear.    \"Lad,\" he said to me, \"you must not ride about here, unless with half a  dozen of us. You know among our men a tall young fellow, Bernenstein by  name?\"    I knew him. He was a fine strapping young man, almost of my height, and  of light complexion.    \"He lies in his room upstairs, with a bullet through his arm.\"    \"The deuce he does!\"    \"After dinner he strolled out alone, and went a mile or so into the  wood; and as he walked, he thought he saw three men among the trees;  and one levelled a gun at him. He had no weapon, and he started at a run  back towards the house. But one of them fired, and he was hit, and had  much ado to reach here before he fainted. By good luck, they feared to  pursue him nearer the house.\"    He paused and added:    \"Lad, the bullet was meant for you.\"    \"It is very likely,\" said I, \"and it's first blood to brother Michael.\"    \"I wonder which three it was,\" said Fritz.    \"Well, Sapt,\" I said, \"I went out tonight for no idle purpose, as you  shall hear. But there's one thing in my mind.\"    \"What's that?\" he asked.    \"Why this,\" I answered. \"That I shall ill requite the very great honours  Ruritania has done me if I depart from it leaving one of those Six  alive--neither with the help of God, will I.\"    And Sapt shook my hand on that.            CHAPTER 13    An Improvement on Jacob's Ladder      In the morning of the day after that on which I swore my oath against  the Six, I gave certain orders, and then rested in greater contentment  than I had known for some time. I was at work; and work, though it  cannot cure love, is yet a narcotic to it; so that Sapt, who grew  feverish, marvelled to see me sprawling in an armchair in the sunshine,  listening to one of my friends who sang me amorous songs in a mellow  voice and induced in me a pleasing melancholy. Thus was I engaged when  young Rupert Hentzau, who feared neither man nor devil, and rode through  the demesne--where every tree might hide a marksman, for all he knew--as  though it had been the park at Strelsau, cantered up to where I lay,  bowing with burlesque deference, and craving private speech with me  in order to deliver a message from the Duke of Strelsau. I made all  withdraw, and then he said, seating himself by me:    \"The King is in love, it seems?\"    \"Not with life, my lord,\" said I, smiling.    \"It is well,\" he rejoined. \"Come, we are alone, Rassendyll--\"    I rose to a sitting posture.    \"What's the matter?\" he asked.    \"I was about to call one of my gentlemen to bring your horse, my lord.  If you do not know how to address the King, my brother must find another  messenger.\"    \"Why keep up the farce?\" he asked, negligently dusting his boot with his  glove.    \"Because it is not finished yet; and meanwhile I'll choose my own name.\"    \"Oh, so be it! Yet I spoke in love for you; for indeed you are a man  after my own heart.\"    \"Saving my poor honesty,\" said I, \"maybe I am. But that I keep faith  with men, and honour with women, maybe I am, my lord.\"    He darted a glance at me--a glance of anger.    \"Is your mother dead?\" said I.    \"Ay, she's dead.\"    \"She may thank God,\" said I, and I heard him curse me softly. \"Well,  what's the message?\" I continued.    I had touched him on the raw, for all the world knew he had broken his  mother's heart and flaunted his mistresses in her house; and his airy  manner was gone for the moment.    \"The duke offers you more than I would,\" he growled. \"A halter for  you, sire, was my suggestion. But he offers you safe-conduct across the  frontier and a million crowns.\"    \"I prefer your offer, my lord, if I am bound to one.\"    \"You refuse?\"    \"Of course.\"    \"I told Michael you would;\" and the villain, his temper restored,  gave me the sunniest of smiles. \"The fact is, between ourselves,\" he  continued, \"Michael doesn't understand a gentleman.\"    I began to laugh.    \"And you?\" I asked.    \"I do,\" he said. \"Well, well, the halter be it.\"    \"I'm sorry you won't live to see it,\" I observed.    \"Has his Majesty done me the honour to fasten a particular quarrel on  me?\"    \"I would you were a few years older, though.\"    \"Oh, God gives years, but the devil gives increase,\" laughed he. \"I can  hold my own.\"    \"How is your prisoner?\" I asked.    \"The K--?\"    \"Your prisoner.\"    \"I forgot your wishes, sire. Well, he is alive.\"    He rose to his feet; I imitated him. Then, with a smile, he said:    \"And the pretty princess? Faith, I'll wager the next Elphberg will be  red enough, for all that Black Michael will be called his father.\"    I sprang a step towards him, clenching my hand. He did not move an inch,  and his lip curled in insolent amusement.    \"Go, while your skin's whole!\" I muttered. He had repaid me with  interest my hit about his mother.    Then came the most audacious thing I have known in my life. My friends  were some thirty yards away. Rupert called to a groom to bring him his  horse, and dismissed the fellow with a crown. The horse stood near. I  stood still, suspecting nothing. Rupert made as though to mount; then  he suddenly turned to me: his left hand resting in his belt, his right  outstretched: \"Shake hands,\" he said.    I bowed, and did as he had foreseen--I put my hands behind me. Quicker  than thought, his left hand darted out at me, and a small dagger flashed  in the air; he struck me in the left shoulder--had I not swerved, it  had been my heart. With a cry, I staggered back. Without touching the  stirrup, he leapt upon his horse and was off like an arrow, pursued by  cries and revolver shots--the last as useless as the first--and I  sank into my chair, bleeding profusely, as I watched the devil's brat  disappear down the long avenue. My friends surrounded me, and then I  fainted.    I suppose that I was put to bed, and there lay, unconscious, or half  conscious, for many hours; for it was night when I awoke to my full  mind, and found Fritz beside me. I was weak and weary, but he bade me be  of good cheer, saying that my wound would soon heal, and that meanwhile  all had gone well, for Johann, the keeper, had fallen into the snare we  had laid for him, and was even now in the house.    \"And the queer thing is,\" pursued Fritz, \"that I fancy he's not  altogether sorry to find himself here. He seems to think that when  Black Michael has brought off his coup, witnesses of how it was  effected--saving, of course, the Six themselves--will not be at a  premium.\"    This idea argued a shrewdness in our captive which led me to build  hopes on his assistance. I ordered him to be brought in at once. Sapt  conducted him, and set him in a chair by my bedside. He was sullen, and  afraid; but, to say truth, after young Rupert's exploit, we also had  our fears, and, if he got as far as possible from Sapt's formidable  six-shooter, Sapt kept him as far as he could from me. Moreover, when he  came in his hands were bound, but that I would not suffer.    I need not stay to recount the safeguards and rewards we promised the  fellow--all of which were honourably observed and paid, so that he lives  now in prosperity (though where I may not mention); and we were the more  free inasmuch as we soon learnt that he was rather a weak man than a  wicked, and had acted throughout this matter more from fear of the duke  and of his own brother Max than for any love of what was done. But  he had persuaded all of his loyalty; and though not in their secret  counsels, was yet, by his knowledge of their dispositions within the  Castle, able to lay bare before us the very heart of their devices. And  here, in brief, is his story:    Below the level of the ground in the Castle, approached by a flight of  stone steps which abutted on the end of the drawbridge, were situated  two small rooms, cut out of the rock itself. The outer of the two had no  windows, but was always lighted with candles; the inner had one square  window, which gave upon the moat. In the outer room there lay always,  day and night, three of the Six; and the instructions of Duke Michael  were, that on any attack being made on the outer room, the three were to  defend the door of it so long as they could without risk to themselves.  But, so soon as the door should be in danger of being forced, then  Rupert Hentzau or Detchard (for one of these two was always there)  should leave the others to hold it as long as they could, and himself  pass into the inner room, and, without more ado, kill the King who  lay there, well-treated indeed, but without weapons, and with his arms  confined in fine steel chains, which did not allow him to move his elbow  more than three inches from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/950"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Runabout; Or, The Speediest Car on the Road (#17)"],[1," hearty breakfast, and departed.    \"They told me to tell you they were at the bank,\" said the housekeeper.    \"Did Mr. Pendergast stay all night?\" inquired Tom.    \"I heard some one go away about two o'clock this morning,\" replied the  housekeeper. \"I don't know who it was.\"    \"They must have had a long session,\" thought Tom, as he began on his  bacon, eggs and coffee. \"I'll take a run down to the bank in my  electric in a little while.\"    The car was still in rather crude shape, outwardly, but the mechanism  was now almost perfect. Tom charged the batteries well before starting  out.    The youth had no sooner come in sight of the old Shopton bank, to  distinguish it from the Second National, which Mr. Foger had started,  than he was aware that something unusual had occurred.  There was quite  a crowd about it, and more persons were constantly arriving to swell  the throng.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Tom, of one of the few police officers of  which Shopton boasted, though the lad did not need to be told.    \"Run on the bank,\" was the brief answer. \"It's failed.\"    Tom felt a pang of disappointment. Somehow, he had hoped that his  father and his friends might have been able to stave off ruin. As he  approached nearer Tom was made aware that the crowd was in an ugly mood.    \"Why don't they open the doors and give us our money?\" cried one  excited woman. \"It's ours! I worked hard for mine, an' now they want to  keep it from us. I wish I'd put it in the new bank.\"    \"Yes, that's the best place,\" added another. \"That Mr. Foger has lots  of money.\"    \"I can see the hand of Andy's father, and that of Mr. Berg, at work  here,\" thought Tom, \"They have spread rumors of the bank's trouble, and  hope to profit by it. I wish I could find a way to beat them at their  own game.\"    As the minutes passed, and the bank was not opened, the ugly temper of  the crowd increased. The few police could do nothing with the mob, and  several, bolder than the rest, advocated battering down the doors. Some  went up the steps and began to pound on the portals. Tom looked for a  sight of his father or Mr. Damon, but could not see either.    It was not the regular hour for opening the bank, but when the police  reminded the people of this they only laughed.    \"I guess they ain't going to open anyhow!\" shouted a man.  \"They've got  our money, and they're going to keep it. What difference is an hour,  anyway?\"    \"Yes, if they have the money, why don't they open, and not wait until  ten o'clock?\" cried another. \"I've got a hundred and five dollars in  there, and I want it!\"    More excited persons were arriving every minute. The crowd surged this  way, and that. Many looked anxiously at the clock in the tower of the  town hall. The gilded hands pointed to a few minutes of ten. Would the  bank open its doors when the hour boomed out? Many were anxiously  asking this question.    Tom sat in his electric car, near the front of the bank. The interest  of the crowd, which under ordinary circumstances would have been  centered in the queer vehicle, was not drawn toward it.  The people  were all thinking of their money.    Suddenly one of the two doors of the bank slowly opened. There was a  yell from the crowd, and a rush to get in. But the police managed to  hold the leaders back, and then Tom saw that it was Ned Newton, who  stood in the partly-opened portal. He held up his hand to indicate  silence, and a hush fell over the mob.    \"The bank is open for business,\" Ned announced, \"but there must be no  rush. The building is not large enough to accommodate you all. If you  form a line, you will be admitted in turn. The bank hopes to pay you  all.\"    \"Hopes!\" cried a woman scornfully. \"We can't eat hopes, young man, nor  yet pay the rent with it. Hopes indeed!\"    But Ned had said all he cared to, and, with rather a white face, he  went back inside. The one door remained open and, with a policeman on  either side, a line of anxious depositors was slowly formed. Tom  watched them crowding and surging forward, all eager to be first to get  their cash out, lest there be not enough for all. As he watched, the  young inventor was aware that some was signaling to him from the big  window of the bank. He looked more closely and saw Ned Newton beckoning  to him, and the young cashier was motioning Tom to go around to the  rear, where a door of the bank opened on a small alley. Wondering what  was wanted, Tom slowly ran his machine down the side street, and up the  alley. No one paid any attention to him.    A porter admitted the lad, and he made his way to the private offices,  where he knew his father and Mr. Damon would be. In the corridors he  could hear the murmur of the throng and the chink of money, as the  tellers paid it out.    \"Well, Tom, this is bad business,\" remarked Mr. Swift, as he saw his  son. The lad noticed that Mr. Damon was in the telephone booth.    \"Yes, Dad,\" admitted Tom. \"It's a run, all right. What are you going to  do?\"    \"The best we can. Pay out all the cash we have, and hope that before  that time, the people will come to their senses. The bank is all right  if they would only wait. But I'm afraid they won't and, after we pay  out all the cash we have, we'll have to close the doors. Then there's  sure to be an unpleasant scene, and maybe some of the more hot-headed  ones will advocate violence. We have given orders to the tellers to pay  out as slowly as possible, so as to enable us to gain some time.\"    \"And all you need is money; is that it, Dad?\"    \"That's it, Tom, but we have exhausted every possibility. Mr. Damon is  trying a forlorn hope now, but, even if he is successful--\"    Before Mr. Swift had ceased speaking, Mr. Damon fairly burst from the  telephone booth. He was much excited.    \"I've got it! I've got it!\" he cried.    \"What?\" asked Mr. Swift and Tom in the same breath.    \"The cash, or, what's just as good, the promise of it. I called up Mr.  Chase, of the Clayton National Bank, and he has agreed to take the  railroad securities I offered him as collateral, and let me have sixty  thousand dollars on them! That will give us cash enough to weather the  storm. Hurrah! We're all right now. Bless my check book!\"    \"The Clayton National Bank,\" remarked Mr. Swift, and his voice was  hopeless. \"It's forty miles away, Mr. Damon, and no railroad around  here runs anywhere near it. No one could get there and back with the  cash to-day, in time to save us from ruin. It's impossible! Our last  chance is gone.\"    \"How far did you say it was, Dad?\" asked Tom quickly.    \"Forty miles there, over forty, I guess, and not very good roads. We  would need to have the cash here before three o'clock to be of any  service to us. No, it's out of the question. The bank will have to  fail!\"    \"No!\" cried the young inventor, and his voice rang out through the  room. \"I'll get the cash for you!\"    \"How?\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"You can't get there and back in time?\"    \"Yes, I can!\" cried Tom. \"In my electric runabout! I can make it go a  hundred miles an hour, if necessary! Probably I'll have to run slow  over the bad roads; but I can do it! I know I can.  I'll get the sixty  thousand dollars for you!\"    For a moment there was silence. Then Mr. Damon cried:    \"Good! And I'll go with you and deliver the securities to Mr. Chase.  Come on, Tom Swift! Bless my collar button, but maybe we can yet save  the old bank after all!\"          CHAPTER XVIII    AFTER THE CASH      Tom's proposal as a way out of the difficulty, and the prompt seconding  of it by Mr. Damon, seemed to deprive the other bank officials, Mr.  Swift included, of the power of speech for a few moments. Then, as  there came to the room where the scene had taken place, the sound of  the mob outside, clamoring for cash, Mr. Pendergast, the president,  remarked in a low voice:    \"It seems to be the only way. Do you think you can do it, Tom Swift?\"    \"I'm sure of it, as far as my electric car is concerned,\" replied the  young inventor. \"If we get the cash I'll have it back here on time. The  runabout is all ready for a fast trip.\"    \"Then don't lose any time, Tom,\" advised his father. \"Every minute  counts.\"    \"Yes,\" added Mr. Damon. \"Come on. I've got the securities in my valise,  and we can bring the cash back in the same satchel. Come on, Tom.\"    The eccentric character caught up his valise, and started from the  room. Tom followed.    \"Now, my son, be careful,\" advised his father. \"You know the need of  haste, but don't take unnecessary risks. You'd better go out the back  way, as the crowd is easily excited.\"    Little more was said. Mr. Swift clasped his son's hand in a firm  pressure, and the bank president nervously bade the lad good-by. Then,  slipping out of the bank, by the rear entrance, the porter closing the  door after them, Tom and Mr. Damon took their places in the electric  machine.    \"Just imagine you're racing for that three-thousand-dollar prize,  offered by the Touring Club of America, Tom,\" observed Mr. Damon, as he  deposited the valise at his feet.    \"I don't have to do that,\" replied the youth. \"I'm trying for a bigger  prize than that. I want to save the bank, and defeat the schemes of the  Fogers--father and son.\"    Tom turned on the power, and the machine rolled out on the main street.  As it turned the corner, leaving the impatient crowd of depositors, now  larger than ever, behind, Mr. Damon glanced over at the new bank, and,  as he did so, he called to Tom:    \"There are the Fogers now.\"    The young inventor looked, and saw Andy and his father on the steps of  the new institution.    At the sight of the electric car, speeding along, Andy turned and spoke  to his parent. What he said seemed to impress Mr. Foger, for he  started, and looked more intently at Tom and Mr. Damon. Then, as Tom  watched, he saw the two excitedly conversing, and a moment later Andy  ran off in the direction in which Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey"]]]
