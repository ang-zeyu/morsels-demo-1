Now, till that moment I  had never seen a trace of Grace in his features, nor of him in hers; and  yet as he gazed at me then, there was something of her present in his  face, even battered as it was, so that it seemed as if she looked at me  behind his eyes. And that made me the sorrier for him, and at last I felt  I could not stand by and see him done to death.    When Elzevir had stuck the pin into the candle he never shut the slide  again; and though no wind blew, there was a light breath moving in the  morning off the sea, that got inside the lanthorn and set the flame  askew. And so the candle guttered down one side till but little tallow  was left above the pin; for though the flame grew pale and paler to the  view in the growing morning light, yet it burnt freely all the time. So  at last there was left, as I judged, but a quarter of an hour to run  before the pin should fall, and I saw that Maskew knew this as well as I,  for his eyes were fixed on the lanthorn.    At last he spoke again, but the brave words were gone, and the thin voice  was thinner. He had dropped threats, and was begging piteously for his  life. 'Spare me,' he said; 'spare me, Mr. Block: I have an only daughter,  a young girl with none but me to guard her. Would you rob a young girl of  her only help and cast her on the world? Would you have them find me dead  upon the cliff and bring me back to her a bloody corpse?'    Then Elzevir answered: 'And had I not an only son, and was he not brought  back to me a bloody corpse? Whose pistol was it that flashed in his face  and took his life away? Do you not know? It was this very same that shall  flash in yours. So make what peace you may with God, for you have little  time to make it.'    With that he took the pistol from the ground where it had lain, and  turning his back on Maskew, walked slowly to and fro among the  bramble-plumps.    Though Maskew's words about his daughter seemed but to feed Elzevir's  anger, by leading him to think of David, they sank deep in my heart; and  if it had seemed a fearful thing before to stand by and see a  fellow-creature butchered, it seemed now ten thousand times more fearful.  And when I thought of Grace, and what such a deed would mean to her, my  pulse beat so fierce that I must needs spring to my feet and run to  reason with Elzevir, and tell him this must not be.    He was still walking among the bushes when I found him, and let me say  my say till I was out of breath, and bore with me if I talked fast, and  if my tongue outran my judgement.    'Thou hast a warm heart, lad,' he said, 'and 'tis for that I like thee.  And if thou hast a chief place in thy heart for me, I cannot grumble if  thou find a little room there even for our enemies. Would I could set thy  soul at ease, and do all that thou askest. In the first flush of wrath,  when he was taken plotting against our lives, it seemed a little thing  enough to take his evil life. But now these morning airs have cooled me,  and it goes against my will to shoot a cowering hound tied hand and foot,  even though he had murdered twenty sons of mine. I have thought if  there be any way to spare his life, and leave this hour's agony to read a  lesson not to be unlearned until the grave. For such poltroons dread  death, and in one hour they die a hundred times. But there is no way out:  his life lies in the scale against the lives of all our men, yes, and thy  life too. They left him in my hands well knowing I should take account of  him; and am I now to play them false and turn him loose again to hang  them all? It cannot be.'    Still I pleaded hard for Maskew's life, hanging on Elzevir's arm, and  using every argument that I could think of to soften his purpose; but he  pushed me off; and though I saw that he was loth to do it, I had a  terrible conviction that he was not a man to be turned back from his  resolve, and would go through with it to the end.    We came back together from the brambles to the piece of sward, and there  sat Maskew where we had left him with his back against the stone. Only,  while we were away he had managed to wriggle his watch out of the fob,  and it lay beside him on the turf, tied to him with a black silk riband.  The face of it was turned upwards, and as I passed I saw the hand pointed  to five. Sunrise was very near; for though the cliff shut out the east  from us, the west over Portland was all aglow with copper-red and gold,  and the candle burnt low. The head of the pin was drooping, though very  slightly, but as I saw it droop a month before, and I knew that the final  act was not far off.    Maskew knew it too, for he made his last appeal, using such passionate  words as I cannot now relate, and wriggling with his body as if to get  his hands from behind his back and hold them up in supplication. He  offered money; a thousand, five thousand, ten thousand pounds to be set  free; he would give back the Why Not?; he would leave Moonfleet; and all  the while the sweat ran down his furrowed face, and at last his voice was  choked with sobs, for he was crying for his life in craven fear.    He might have spoken to a deaf man for all he moved his judge; and  Elzevir's answer was to cock the pistol and prime the powder in the pan.    Then I stuck my fingers in my ears and shut my eyes, that I might  neither see nor hear what followed, but in a second changed my mind and  opened them again, for I had made a great resolve to stop this matter,  come what might.    Maskew was making a dreadful sound between a moan and strangled cry; it  almost seemed as if he thought that there were others by him beside  Elzevir and me, and was shouting to them for help. The sun had risen, and  his first rays blazed on a window far away in the west on top of Portland  Island, and then there was a tinkle in the inside of the lanthorn, and  the pin fell.    Elzevir looked full at Maskew, and raised his pistol; but before he had  time to take aim, I dashed upon him like a wild cat, springing on his  right arm, and crying to him to stop. It was an unequal struggle, a lad,  though full-grown and lusty, against one of the powerfullest of men, but  indignation nerved my arms, and his were weak, because he doubted of his  right. So 'twas with some effort that he shook me off, and in the  struggle the pistol was fired into the air.    Then I let go of him, and stumbled for a moment, tired with that bout,  but pleased withal, because I saw what peace even so short a respite had  brought to Maskew. For at the pistol shot 'twas as if a mask of horror  had fallen from his face, and left him his old countenance again; and  then I saw he turned his eyes towards the cliff-top, and thought that he  was looking up in thankfulness to heaven.    But now a new thing happened; for before the echoes of that pistol-shot  had died on the keen morning air, I thought I heard a noise of distant  shouting, and looked about to see whence it could come. Elzevir looked  round too, but Maskew forgetting to upbraid me for making him miss his  aim, still kept his face turned up towards the cliff. Then the voices  came nearer, and there was a mingled sound as of men shouting to one  another, and gathering in from different places. 'Twas from the cliff-top  that the voices came, and thither Elzevir and I looked up, and there too  Maskew kept his eyes fixed. And in a moment there were a score of men  stood on the cliff's edge high above our heads. The sky behind them was  pink flushed with the keenest light of the young day, and they stood out  against it sharp cut and black as the silhouette of my mother that used  to hang up by the parlour chimney. They were soldiers, and I knew the  tall mitre-caps of the 13th, and saw the shafts of light from the sunrise  come flashing round their bodies, and glance off the barrels of their  matchlocks.    I knew it all now; it was the Posse who had lain in ambush. Elzevir saw  it too, and then all shouted at once. 'Yield at the King's command: you  are our prisoners!' calls the voice of one of those black silhouettes,  far up on the cliff-top.    'We are lost,' cries Elzevir; 'it is the Posse; but if we die, this  traitor shall go before us,' and he makes towards Maskew to brain him  with the pistol.    'Shoot, shoot, in the Devil's name,' screams Maskew, 'or I am a  dead man.'    Then there came a flash of fire along the black line of silhouettes,  with a crackle like a near peal of thunder, and a fut, fut, fut, of  bullets in the turf. And before Elzevir could get at him, Maskew had  fallen over on the sward with a groan, and with a little red hole in the  middle of his forehead.    'Run for the cliff-side,' cried Elzevir to me; 'get close in, and they  cannot touch thee,' and he made for the chalk wall. But I had fallen on  my knees like a bullock felled by a pole-axe, and had a scorching pain in  my left foot. Elzevir looked back. 'What, have they hit thee too?' he  said, and ran and picked me up like a child. And then there is another  flash and fut, fut, in the turf; but the shots find no billet this time,  and we are lying close against the cliff, panting but safe.          CHAPTER 10    THE ESCAPE                ... How fearful  And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!     ... I'll look no more  Lest my brain turn--_Shakespeare_      The while chalk was a bulwark between us and the foe; and though one or  two of them loosed off their matchlocks, trying to get at us sideways,  they could not even see their quarry, and 'twas only shooting at a  venture. We were safe. But for how short a time! Safe just for so long as  it should please the soldiers not to come down to take us, safe with a  discharged pistol in our grasp, and a shot man lying at our feet.    Elzevir was the first to speak: 'Can you stand, John? Is the bone  broken?'

So after that Sir Launcelot travelled for a while through the green fields  of that valley, till by and by he passed out of that valley, and came into  a forest through which he travelled for a very long time.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot cometh to a marish country] For it was about the  slanting of the afternoon ere he came forth out of that forest and under  the open sky again. And when he came out of the forest he beheld before him  a country of perfectly level marish, very lush and green, with many ponds  of water and sluggish streams bordered by rushes and sedge, and with  pollard willows standing in rows beside the waters. In the midst of this  level plain of green (which was like to the surface of a table for  flatness) there stood a noble castle, part built of brick and part of  stone, and a town of no great size and a wall about the town. And this  castle and town stood upon an island surrounded by a lake of water, and a  long bridge, built upon stone buttresses, reached from the mainland to the  island. And this castle and town were a very long distance away, though  they appeared very clear and distinct to the sight across the level marish,  like, as it were, to a fine bit of very small and cunning carving.    Now the way that Sir Launcelot travelled, led somewhat toward that town,  wherefore he went along that way with intent to view the place more near  by. So he conveyed by that road for some time without meeting any soul upon  the way. But at last he came of a sudden upon an archer hiding behind an  osier tree with intent to shoot the water-fowl that came to a pond that was  there--for he had several such fowl hanging at his girdle. To him Sir  Launcelot said: \"Good fellow, what town is that yonderway?\" \"Sir,\" said the  yeoman, \"that is called the Town of the Marish because it stands in these  Fenlands. And that castle is called the Castle of the Fenlands for the same  reason.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot talks with a yeoman] Quoth Sir Launcelot: \"What  manner of place is that? Is it a good place, or is it otherwise?\" \"Sir,\"  said the archer, \"that place was one while a very good, happy place; for in  times gone by there was a lord who dwelt there who was both just and noble,  and kind to all folk, wherefore he was loved by all the people. But one  night there came two very grim and horrible giants thither from the Welsh  Mountains and these entered into the castle by treachery and made prisoner  of the lord of the castle. Him they cast into the dungeon of the castle,  where they held him prisoner as an hostage. For they threaten that if  friends of that lord's should send force against them to dispossess them,  they will slay him. As for any other rescue, there is no knight who dareth  to go against them because of their terrible size, and their strength, and  their dreadful, horrible countenances.\"    \"Well,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"that is a pity and I am sorry for that noble  lordling. Now, since there is no other single knight who dareth to  undertake this adventure, I myself will go and encounter these giants.\"    \"Nay, Sir Knight,\" said the yeoman, \"do not do so, for they are not like  mortal men, but rather like monsters that are neither beast nor man.  Wherefore anyone who beholdeth them, feareth them.\"    \"Grammercy for thy thought of me, good fellow,\" quoth Sir Launcelot, \"but  if I shall refuse an adventure because I find it perilous, then I am not  like to undertake any adventure at all.\"    Therewith he bade good den to that yeoman and rode upon his way, directing  his course toward that town at an easy pass.    So he came at last to the long bridge that reached from the land to the  island, and he saw that at the farther end of the bridge was the gateway of  the town and through the arch thereof he could perceive a street of the  town, and the houses upon either side of the street, and the people thereof  coming and going.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot crosses the bridge to the town] So he rode forth  upon the bridge and at the noise of his coming (for the hoofs of his horse  sounded like thunder upon the floor of the bridge) the people of the town  came running to see who it was that dared to come so boldly into their  town.    These, when Sir Launcelot came nigh, began to call to him on high, crying:  \"Turn back, Sir Knight! Turn back! Else you will meet your death at this  place.\"    But Sir Launcelot would not turn back, but advanced very steadfastly upon  his way.    Now somewhat nigh the farther end of that bridge there stood a little lodge  of stone, built to shelter the warden of the bridge from stress of weather.  When Sir Launcelot came nigh to this lodge there started suddenly out from  it a great churl, above seven feet high, who bore in his hand a huge club,  shod with iron and with great spikes of iron at the top. This churl ran to  Sir Launcelot and catched his horse by the bridle-rein and thrust it back  upon its haunches, crying out in a great hoarse voice: \"Whither goest thou,  Sir Knight, for to cross this bridge?\" Sir Launcelot said: \"Let go my  horse's rein, Sir Churl.\" Whereunto the churl made answer: \"I will not let  go thy horse's rein, and thou shalt not cross this bridge.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot slays the huge churl] At this Sir Launcelot waxed  very angry, and he drew his sword and struck the churl a blow with the flat  thereof upon the shoulder, so that he dropped the rein very quickly.  Therewith that churl drew back and took his great iron-shod club in both  hands and struck at Sir Launcelot a blow that would have split a millstone.  But Sir Launcelot put by the blow with his sword so that it did him no  harm. But therewith he waxed so wroth that he ground his teeth together  with anger, and, rising in his stirrups, he lashed that churl so woeful a  blow that he cleft through his iron cap and his head and his breast even to  the paps.    [Sidenote: The folk warn Sir Launcelot] Now when the people of the town  beheld that terrible blow they lifted up their voices in a great outcry,  crying out: \"Turn back, Sir Knight! Turn back! For this is a very woful  thing for thee that thou hast done!\" and some cried out: \"Thou hast killed  the giants' warder of the bridge!\" And others cried: \"Thou art a dead man  unless thou make haste away from this.\" But to all this Sir Launcelot paid  no heed, but wiped his sword and thrust it back into its sheath. Then he  went forward upon his way across the bridge as though nothing had befallen,  and so came to the farther side. Then, without paying any heed to all the  people who were there, he rode straight to the castle and into the gate of  the castle and into the court-yard thereof.    Now by this time all the castle was astir, and in great tumult, and many  people came running to the windows and looked down upon Sir Launcelot. And  Sir Launcelot sat his horse and looked all about him. So he perceived that  beyond the court-yard was a fair space of grass, very smooth and green,  well fitted for battle, wherefore he dismounted from his horse and tied it  to a ring in the wall, and then he went to that green field and made him  ready for whatever might befall.    Meantime all those people who were at the windows of the castle cried out  to him, as the people of the town had done: \"Go away, Sir Knight! Go away  whilst there is still time for you to escape, or else you are a dead man!\"    But Sir Launcelot replied not, but stood there and waited very steadfastly.  Then the great door of the castle hall opened, and there came forth  therefrom those two giants of whom he had heard tell.    [Sidenote: Two giants attack Sir Launcelot] And in truth Sir Launcelot had  never beheld such horrible beings as they; for they were above ten feet  high, and very huge of body and long of limb. And they were clad in armor  of bull-hide with iron rings upon it, and each was armed with a great club,  huge and thick, and shod with iron, and studded with spikes. These came  toward Sir Launcelot swinging their clubs and laughing very hideously and  gnashing their long white teeth, for they thought to make easy work of him.    [Sidenote: How Sir Launcelot slays the first giant] Then Sir Launcelot,  seeing them coming thus, set his shield before him, and made ready for that  assault with great calmness of demeanor. Then the giants rushed suddenly  upon him and struck at him, the both of them together; for they deemed that  by so doing the enemy could not escape both blows, but if one failed the  other would slay him. But Sir Launcelot put aside the blow of one giant  with his sword and of the other with his shield, with marvellous dexterity.  Thereupon, ere they could recover themselves, he turned upon that giant who  was upon his left hand and he struck him so terrible a blow upon the  shoulder that he cut through the armor and through the shoulder and  half-way through the body, so that the head and one arm of the giant leaned  toward one way, and the other arm and the shoulder leaned toward the other  way. Therewith the giant fell down upon the ground bellowing, so that it  was most terrible to hear; and in a little he had died where he had fallen.    [Sidenote: How Sir Launcelot slays the second giant] Now when the fellow  of that giant beheld that dreadful, horrible stroke, he was so possessed  with terror that he stood for a while trembling and like one in a maze. But  when he saw Sir Launcelot turn upon him with intent to make at him also, he  let fall his club and ran away with great and fearful outcry. Therewith he  ran toward the castle and would have entered therein, but those within the  castle had closed the doors and the gates against him, so that he could not  escape in that way. So the giant ran around and around the court with great  outcry, seeking for some escape from his pursuer, and Sir Launcelot ran"]]]
