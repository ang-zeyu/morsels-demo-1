I give him a punch on the nose  an' 'e don't renew the offer: but that night (we're layin' at Port Said)  'e tries to pinch it! I dam' near broke his neck, and 'e don't try any  more. To-night\"--he extended his right arm forensically--\"a deppitation  of Chinks waits on me at the dock gates; they explains as from a  patriotic point of view they feels it to be their dooty to buy that  pigtail off of me, and they bids a quid, a bar of gold--a Jimmy o'  Goblin!\"    He snapped his fingers contemptuously and emptied his pewter. A sense  of what was coming began to dawn on me. That the \"hold-up\" near the  riverside formed part of the scheme was possible, and, reflecting on  my rough treatment of the two Chinamen, I chuckled inwardly. Possibly,  however, the scheme had germinated in my acquaintance's mind merely as  a result of an otherwise common assault, of a kind not unusual in these  parts, but, whether elaborate or comparatively simple, that the story  of the pigtail was a \"plant\" designed to reach my pocket, seemed a  reasonable hypothesis.    \"I told him to go to China,\" concluded the object of my suspicion, again  rapping upon the counter, \"and you see what come of it. All I got to say  is this: If they're so bloody patriotic, I says one thing: I ain't the  man to stand in their way. You done me a good turn to-night, mate; I'm  doing you one. 'Ere's the bloody pigtail, 'ere's my empty mug. Fill the  mug and the pigtail's yours. It's good for a quid at the dock gates any  day!\"    My suspicions vanished; my interest arose to boiling point. I refilled  my acquaintance's mug, pressed a sovereign upon him (in honesty I must  confess that he was loath to take it), and departed with the pigtail  coiled neatly in an inner pocket of my jacket. I entered the house in  Wade Street by the side door, and half an hour later let myself out by  the front door, having cast off my dockland disguise.          II    HOW I LOST IT        It was not until the following evening that I found leisure to examine  my strange acquisition, for affairs of more immediate importance  engrossed my attention. But at about ten o'clock I seated myself at  my table, lighted the lamp, and taking out the pigtail from the table  drawer, placed it on the blotting-pad and began to examine it with the  greatest curiosity, for few Chinese affect the pigtail nowadays.    I had scarcely commenced my examination, however, when it was  dramatically interrupted. The door bell commenced to ring jerkily. I  stood up, and as I did so the ringing ceased and in its place came a  muffled beating on the door. I hurried into the passage as the bell  commenced ringing again, and I had almost reached the door when once  more the ringing ceased; but now I could hear a woman's voice, low but  agitated:    \"Open the door! Oh, for God's sake be quick!\"    Completely mystified, and not a little alarmed, I threw open the door,  and in there staggered a woman heavily veiled, so that I could see  little of her features, but by the lines of her figure I judged her to  be young.    Uttering a sort of moan of terror she herself closed the door, and  stood with her back to it, watching me through the thick veil, while her  breast rose and fell tumultuously.    \"Thank God there was someone at home!\" she gasped.    I think I may say with justice that I had never been so surprised in my  life; every particular of the incident marked it as unique--set it apart  from the episodes of everyday life.    \"Madam,\" I began doubtfully, \"you seem to be much alarmed at something,  and if I can be of any assistance to you------\"    \"You have saved my life!\" she whispered, and pressed one hand to her  bosom. \"In a moment I will explain.\"    \"Won't you rest a little after your evidently alarming experience?\" I  suggested.    My strange visitor nodded, without speaking, and I conducted her to the  study which I had just left, and placed the most comfortable arm-chair  close beside the table so that as I sat I might study this woman who  so strangely had burst in upon me. I even tilted the shaded lamp,  artlessly, a trick I had learned from Harley, in order that the light  might fall upon her face.    She may have detected this device; I know not; but as if in answer to  its challenge, she raised her gloved hands and unfastened the heavy veil  which had concealed her features.    Thereupon I found myself looking into a pair of lustrous black eyes  whose almond shape was that of the Orient; I found myself looking at a  woman who, since she was evidently a Jewess, was probably no older than  eighteen or nineteen, but whose beauty was ripely voluptuous, who might  fittingly have posed for Salome, who, despite her modern fashionable  garments, at once suggested to my mind the wanton beauty of the daughter  of Herodias.    I stared at her silently for a time, and presently her full lips parted  in a slow smile. My ideas were diverted into another channel.    \"You have yet to tell me what alarmed you,\" I said in a low voice, but  as courteously as possible, \"and if I can be of any assistance in the  matter.\"    My visitor seemed to recollect her fright--or the necessity for  simulation. The pupils of her fine eyes seemed to grow larger and  darker; she pressed her white teeth into her lower lips, and resting her  hands upon the table leaned toward me.    \"I am a stranger to London,\" she began, now exhibiting a certain  diffidence, \"and to-night I was looking for the chambers of Mr. Raphael  Philips of Figtree Court.\"    \"This is Figtree Court,\" I said, \"but I know of no Mr. Raphael Philips  who has chambers here.\"    The black eyes met mine despairingly.    \"But I am positive of the address!\" protested my beautiful but strange  caller--from her left glove she drew out a scrap of paper, \"here it is.\"    I glanced at the fragment, upon which, in a woman's hand the words were  pencilled: \"Mr. Raphael Philips, 36-b Figtree Court, London.\"    I stared at my visitor, deeply mystified.    \"These chambers are 36-b!\" I said. \"But I am not Raphael Philips, nor  have I ever heard of him. My name is Malcolm Knox. There is evidently  some mistake, but\"--returning the slip of paper--\"pardon me if I remind  you, I have yet to learn the cause of your alarm.\"    \"I was followed across the court and up the stairs.\"    \"Followed! By whom?\"    \"By a dreadful-looking man, chattering in some tongue I did not  understand!\"    My amazement was momentarily growing greater.    \"What kind of a man?\" I demanded rather abruptly.    \"A yellow-faced man--remember I could only just distinguish him in the  darkness on the stairway, and see little more of him than his eyes at  that, and his ugly gleaming teeth--oh! it was horrible!\"    \"You astound me,\" I said; \"the thing is utterly incomprehensible.\" I  switched off the light of the lamp. \"I'll see if there's any sign of him  in the court below.\"    \"Oh, don't leave me! For heaven's sake don't leave me alone!\"    She clutched my arm in the darkness.    \"Have no fear; I merely propose to look out from this window.\"    Suiting the action to the word, I peered down into the court below. It  was quite deserted. The night was a very dark one, and there were many  patches of shadow in which a man might have lain concealed.    \"I can see no one,\" I said, speaking as confidently as possible, and  relighting the lamp, \"if I call a cab for you and see you safely into  it, you will have nothing to fear, I think.\"    \"I have a cab waiting,\" she replied, and lowering the veil she stood up  to go.    \"Kindly allow me to see you to it. I am sorry you have been subjected to  this annoyance, especially as you have not attained the object of your  visit.\"    \"Thank you so much for your kindness; there must be some mistake about  the address, of course.\"    She clung to my arm very tightly as we descended the stairs, and often  glanced back over her shoulder affrightedly, as we crossed the court.  There was not a sign of anyone about, however, and I could not make  up my mind whether the story of the yellow man was a delusion or a  fabrication. I inclined to the latter theory, but the object of such a  deception was more difficult to determine.    Sure enough, a taxicab was waiting at the entrance to the court; and my  visitor, having seated herself within, extended her hand to me, and even  through the thick veil I could detect her brilliant smile.    \"Thank you so much, Mr. Knox,\" she said, \"and a thousand apologies. I am  sincerely sorry to have given you all this trouble.\"    The cab drove off. For a moment I stood looking after it, in a state of  dreamy incertitude, then turned and slowly retraced my steps. Reopening  the door of my chambers with my key, I returned to my study and sat down  at the table to endeavour to arrange the facts of what I recognized to  be a really amazing episode. The adventure, trifling though it seemed,  undoubtedly held some hidden significance that at present was not  apparent to me. In accordance with the excellent custom of my friend,  Paul Harley, I prepared to make notes of the occurrence while the facts  were still fresh in my memory. At the moment that I was about to begin,  I made an astounding discovery.    Although I had been absent only a few minutes, and had locked my door  behind me, the pigtail was gone!    I sat quite still, listening intently. The woman's story of the yellow  man on the stairs suddenly assumed a totally different aspect--a new and  sinister aspect. Could it be that the pigtail was at the bottom of the  mystery?--could it be that some murderous Chinaman who had been lurking  in hiding, waiting his opportunity, had in some way gained access to my  chambers during that brief absence? If so, was he gone?    From the table drawer I took out a revolver, ascertained that it was  fully loaded, and turning up light after light as I proceeded, conducted  a room-to-room search. It was without result;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/571"],[0,"The 1995 CIA World Factbook (#17)"],[1,"and storage are also important.
