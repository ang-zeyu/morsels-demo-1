He nodded briefly, but without verbal salutation. He seemed to regard  my remark as he would have regarded the unmannerly heckling of some one  at the back of the hall. He proceeded evenly with his speech, and was  still talking when Celia addressed her ball and drove off. Her drive,  coinciding with a sharp rhetorical question from George, wavered in  mid-air, and the ball trickled off into the rough half-way down the  hill. I can see the poor girl's tortured face even now. But she  breathed no word of reproach. Such is the miracle of women's love.    \"Where you went wrong there,\" said George, breaking off his remarks on  Labour, \"was that you have not studied the dynamics of golf  sufficiently. You did not pivot properly. You allowed your left heel to  point down the course when you were at the top of your swing. This  makes for instability and loss of distance. The fundamental law of the  dynamics of golf is that the left foot shall be solidly on the ground  at the moment of impact. If you allow your heel to point down the  course, it is almost impossible to bring it back in time to make the  foot a solid fulcrum.\"    I drove, and managed to clear the rough and reach the fairway. But it  was not one of my best drives. George Mackintosh, I confess, had  unnerved me. The feeling he gave me resembled the self-conscious panic  which I used to experience in my childhood when informed that there was  One Awful Eye that watched my every movement and saw my every act. It  was only the fact that poor Celia appeared even more affected by his  espionage that enabled me to win the first hole in seven.    On the way to the second tee George discoursed on the beauties of  Nature, pointing out at considerable length how exquisitely the silver  glitter of the lake harmonized with the vivid emerald turf near the  hole and the duller green of the rough beyond it. As Celia teed up her  ball, he directed her attention to the golden glory of the sand-pit to  the left of the flag. It was not the spirit in which to approach the  lake-hole, and I was not surprised when the unfortunate girl's ball  fell with a sickening plop half-way across the water.    \"Where you went wrong there,\" said George, \"was that you made the  stroke a sudden heave instead of a smooth, snappy flick of the wrists.  Pressing is always bad, but with the mashie----\"    \"I think I will give you this hole,\" said Celia to me, for my shot had  cleared the water and was lying on the edge of the green. \"I wish I  hadn't used a new ball.\"    \"The price of golf-balls,\" said George, as we started to round the  lake, \"is a matter to which economists should give some attention. I am  credibly informed that rubber at the present time is exceptionally  cheap. Yet we see no decrease in the price of golf-balls, which, as I  need scarcely inform you, are rubber-cored. Why should this be so? You  will say that the wages of skilled labour have gone up. True. But----\"    \"One moment, George, while I drive,\" I said. For we had now arrived at  the third tee.    \"A curious thing, concentration,\" said George, \"and why certain  phenomena should prevent us from focusing our attention---- This brings  me to the vexed question of sleep. Why is it that we are able to sleep  through some vast convulsion of Nature when a dripping tap is enough to  keep us awake? I am told that there were people who slumbered  peacefully through the San Francisco earthquake, merely stirring  drowsily from time to time to tell an imaginary person to leave it on  the mat. Yet these same people----\"    Celia's drive bounded into the deep ravine which yawns some fifty yards  from the tee. A low moan escaped her.    \"Where you went wrong there----\" said George.    \"I know,\" said Celia. \"I lifted my head.\"    I had never heard her speak so abruptly before. Her manner, in a girl  less noticeably pretty, might almost have been called snappish. George,  however, did not appear to have noticed anything amiss. He filled his  pipe and followed her into the ravine.    \"Remarkable,\" he said, \"how fundamental a principle of golf is this  keeping the head still. You will hear professionals tell their pupils  to keep their eye on the ball. Keeping the eye on the ball is only a  secondary matter. What they really mean is that the head should be kept  rigid, as otherwise it is impossible to----\"    His voice died away. I had sliced my drive into the woods on the right,  and after playing another had gone off to try to find my ball, leaving  Celia and George in the ravine behind me. My last glimpse of them  showed me that her ball had fallen into a stone-studded cavity in the  side of the hill, and she was drawing her niblick from her bag as I  passed out of sight. George's voice, blurred by distance to a  monotonous murmur, followed me until I was out of earshot.    I was just about to give up the hunt for my ball in despair, when I  heard Celia's voice calling to me from the edge of the undergrowth.  There was a sharp note in it which startled me.    I came out, trailing a portion of some unknown shrub which had twined  itself about my ankle.    \"Yes?\" I said, picking twigs out of my hair.    \"I want your advice,\" said Celia.    \"Certainly. What is the trouble? By the way,\" I said, looking round,  \"where is your _fiance_?\"    \"I have no _fiance_,\" she said, in a dull, hard voice.    \"You have broken off the engagement?\"    \"Not exactly. And yet--well, I suppose it amounts to that.\"    \"I don't quite understand.\"    \"Well, the fact is,\" said Celia, in a burst of girlish frankness, \"I  rather think I've killed George.\"    \"Killed him, eh?\"    It was a solution that had not occurred to me, but now that it was  presented for my inspection I could see its merits. In these days of  national effort, when we are all working together to try to make our  beloved land fit for heroes to live in, it was astonishing that nobody  before had thought of a simple, obvious thing like killing George  Mackintosh. George Mackintosh was undoubtedly better dead, but it had  taken a woman's intuition to see it.    \"I killed him with my niblick,\" said Celia.    I nodded. If the thing was to be done at all, it was unquestionably a  niblick shot.    \"I had just made my eleventh attempt to get out of that ravine,\" the  girl went on, \"with George talking all the time about the recent  excavations in Egypt, when suddenly--you know what it is when something  seems to snap----\"    \"I had the experience with my shoe-lace only this morning.\"    \"Yes, it was like that. Sharp--sudden--happening all in a moment. I  suppose I must have said something, for George stopped talking about  Egypt and said that he was reminded by a remark of the last speaker's  of a certain Irishman-----\"    I pressed her hand.    \"Don't go on if it hurts you,\" I said, gently.    \"Well, there is very little more to tell. He bent his head to light his  pipe, and well--the temptation was too much for me. That's all.\"    \"You were quite right.\"    \"You really think so?\"    \"I certainly do. A rather similar action, under far less provocation,  once made Jael the wife of Heber the most popular woman in Israel.\"    \"I wish I could think so too,\" she murmured. \"At the moment, you know,  I was conscious of nothing but an awful elation. But--but--oh, he was  such a darling before he got this dreadful affliction. I can't help  thinking of G-George as he used to be.\"    She burst into a torrent of sobs.    \"Would you care for me to view the remains?\" I said.    \"Perhaps it would be as well.\"    She led me silently into the ravine. George Mackintosh was lying on his  back where he had fallen.    \"There!\" said Celia.    And, as she spoke, George Mackintosh gave a kind of snorting groan and  sat up. Celia uttered a sharp shriek and sank on her knees before him.  George blinked once or twice and looked about him dazedly.    \"Save the women and children!\" he cried. \"I can swim.\"    \"Oh, George!\" said Celia.    \"Feeling a little better?\" I asked.    \"A little. How many people were hurt?\"    \"Hurt?\"    \"When the express ran into us.\" He cast another glance around him.  \"Why, how did I get here?\"    \"You were here all the time,\" I said.    \"Do you mean after the roof fell in or before?\"    Celia was crying quietly down the back of his neck.    \"Oh, George!\" she said, again.    He groped out feebly for her hand and patted it.    \"Brave little woman!\" he said. \"Brave little woman! She stuck by me all  through. Tell me--I am strong enough to bear it--what caused the  explosion?\"    It seemed to me a case where much unpleasant explanation might be  avoided by the exercise of a little tact.    \"Well, some say one thing and some another,\" I said. \"Whether it was a  spark from a cigarette----\"    Celia interrupted me. The woman in her made her revolt against this  well-intentioned subterfuge.    \"I hit you, George!\"    \"Hit me?\" he repeated, curiously. \"What with? The Eiffel Tower?\"    \"With my niblick.\"    \"You hit me with your niblick? But why?\"    She hesitated. Then she faced him bravely.    \"Because you wouldn't stop talking.\"    He gaped.    \"Me!\" he said. \"_I_ wouldn't stop talking! But I hardly talk at  all. I'm noted for it.\"    Celia's eyes met mine in agonized inquiry. But I saw what had happened.  The blow, the sudden shock, had operated on George's brain-cells in  such a way as to effect a complete cure. I have not the technical  knowledge to be able to explain it, but the facts were plain.    \"Lately, my dear fellow,\" I assured him, \"you have dropped into the  habit of talking rather a good deal. Ever since we started out this  afternoon you have kept up an incessant flow of conversation!\"    \"Me! On the links! It isn't possible.\"    \"It is only too true, I fear. And that is why this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7037"],[0,"Beric the Briton : a Story of the Roman Invasion (#17)"],[1,"taught so to move together; and that is how the Romans fight,  Beric?\"    \"It is, queen,\" Beric said. \"The exercises are exactly similar to  those of the Romans. I learnt them by heart when I was among them,  and the orders are exactly the same as those given in the  legions--only, of course, they are performed by trained soldiers more  perfectly than we can as yet do them. It is but two months since  we began, and the Romans have practised them for years. Had I time  you would have seen them much more perfect than at present.\"    \"You have performed marvels,\" she said. \"I wish that you had had  more time, and that all the Iceni, and not the Sarci only could  have thus learned to meet the enemy. Do you not think so, chiefs?\"    \"It is wonderful,\" one of the chiefs said; \"but I think that it is  not so terrifying to a foe as the rush of our own men. It is better  for resistance, but not so good for attack. Still it has great  merits; but I think it more suited for men who fight deliberately,  like the Romans, than for our own tribesmen, who are wont to rely  for victory each upon his own strength and valour.\"    \"What say you, Beric?\" the queen asked.    \"It would be presumptuous for me to give my opinion against that  of a great chief,\" Beric said quietly; \"But, so far, strength and  valour have not in themselves succeeded. The men of Caractacus  had both, but they were unavailing against the solid Roman line.  We have never yet won a great victory over the Romans, and yet we  have fought against them valiantly. None can say that a Briton is  not as brave and as strong as a Roman. In our battles we have always  outnumbered them. If we have been beaten, therefore, it has been  surely because the Roman method of fighting is superior to our  own.\"    There was a murmur of assent from several of the chiefs.    \"Beric's argument is a strong one,\" the queen said to the one who  had spoken; \"and I would that all the Iceni had learnt to fight in  this fashion. However, we shall have opportunities of seeing which  is right before we have finished with the Romans. March your men  back again, Beric.\"    Beric sounded his horn, and the line, facing half round, became  a column, and marched in regular order back to the village. The  morning meal was now taken, and at midday the march began. Boadicea  with her daughters, Parta and other women of rank, went first in  their chariots; and the Sarci, who, as lying next to the enemy's  country, were allowed the post of honour, followed in column  behind her, while the rest of the tribesmen made their way in a  miscellaneous crowd through the forest. They halted among the trees  at a distance of four miles from Camalodunum, and then rested, for  the attack was not to take place until daybreak on the next morning.    Late that evening two or three women of the Trinobantes came out,  in accordance with a preconcerted arrangement, to tell them that  there was no suspicion at Camalodunum of the impending danger; and  that, although there was great uneasiness among the inhabitants, no  measures for defence had been taken, and that even the precaution  of sending away the women and children had not been adopted.    No fires had been lighted; the men slept in the open air, simply  wrapping themselves in their mantles and lying down under the trees.  Beric had a long talk with Boduoc and ten of the tribesmen of the  latter's company.    \"You understand,\" Beric said at last, \"that if, as I expect, the  surprise will be complete and no regular resistance be offered,  I shall sound my horn and give the signal for the tribe to break  ranks and scatter. You ten men will, however, keep together, and  at once follow Boduoc and myself. As soon as we enter the house to  which I shall lead you, you will surround the two persons I shall  place in your charge, and will conduct them to the spot where the  chariot will be waiting. You will defend them, if necessary, with  your lives, should any disobey my order to let you pass through  with them. As soon as they are placed in the chariot you will be  free to join in the sack, and if you should be losers by the delay,  I will myself make up your share to that of your comrades. You are  sure, Boduoc, that all the other arrangements are perfect?\"    \"Everything is arranged,\" Boduoc said. \"My brother, who drives the  chariot that brought your mother's attendants, quite understands  that he is to follow as soon as we move off, and keeping a short  way behind us is to stop in front of the last house outside the  gate until we come. As soon as he has taken them up he will drive  off and give them into the charge of our mother, who has promised  you to have everything in readiness for them; the skins for beds,  drinking vessels, food, and everything else necessary was taken  there two days ago. My sisters will see to the comfort of the young  lady, and you can rely upon my mother to carry out all the orders  you have given her. Our hut lies so deeply in the forest that there  is little chance of anyone going near it, especially as the whole  of the men of the tribe are away.\"    Two hours before daylight the Iceni moved forward. They were to  attack at a number of different points, and each chief had had his  position allotted to him. The Sarci were to move directly against  the northern gate and would form the centre of the attack. Each  man, by Beric's order, carried a faggot so that these could be piled  against the wall by the gate and enable them to effect an entrance  without the delay that would be incurred in breaking down the  massive gates. They passed quietly through the cultivated fields,  and past the houses scattered about outside the walls, whose  inhabitants had withdrawn into the city since the alarm spread.  They halted at a short distance from the gate, for sentries would  be on guard there, and remained for nearly an hour, as many of the  other tribesmen had a considerably longer distance to go to reach  their appointed stations. A faint light was beginning to steal  over the sky when, far away on their right, a horn sounded. It was  repeated again and again, each time nearer, and ran along far to  the left; then, raising their war cry, the Sarci dashed forward to  the gate.    The shouts of the sentinels on the walls had arisen as soon as  the first horn sounded, and had scarcely died away when the Sarci  reached the gate. Each man as he arrived threw down his faggot, and  the pile soon reached the top of the wall. Then Beric led the way  up and stood on the Roman work. The sentries, seeing the hopelessness  of resistance, had already fled, and the Sarci poured in. A confused  clamour of shouts and cries rose from the town, above which sounded  the yells of the exulting Iceni. Beric gave the signal for the Sarci  to scatter, and the tribesmen at once began to attack the houses.  Placing himself at the head of Boduoc's chosen party, Beric ran  forward. Already from some of the houses armed men were pouring  out, but disregarding these Beric pressed on until he reached the  house of Caius Muro. His reason for haste was that, standing rather  on the other side of the town, it was nearer the point assailed  by one of the other divisions of the tribe than to the north gate,  and he feared that others might arrive there before him. Reaching  the door he beat upon it with the handle of his sword.    \"Open, Cneius,\" he shouted, \"it is I, Beric.\"    The door was opened at once, and he ran forward into the atrium,  which was filled with frightened slaves, who burst into cries of  terror as, followed by his men, he entered. \"Where are you, Cneius?\"  Beric shouted.    \"I am here,\" the scribe replied from his cubicule, \"I will be with  you in a moment; it is but a minute since we were awoke by the  uproar.\"    \"Be quick!\" Beric said, \"there is not a moment to be lost.    \"Run up to the women's apartments,\" he said to a slave, \"and tell  your mistress to hurry down, for that every minute is precious.\"    Almost immediately Berenice came down the stairs in her disguise as  a British boy, and at the same moment Cneius issued from his room.    \"Come, Berenice,\" Beric said, \"there is not a moment to be lost;  the town is in our hands, and if others of the tribe arrive I might  not be able to save you.\"    Hurrying them from the house he ordered the men to close round them,  and then started on his way back. A terrible din was going on all  round; yells, shouts, and screams arising from every house. Flames  were bursting up at a dozen points. To his great satisfaction Beric  reached the point where the Sarci were at work, breaking into the  houses, before he encountered any of the other Iceni. The men were  too busy to pay any attention to the little group of their own  tribesmen; passing through these they were soon at the gate. It  already stood open, the bolts having been drawn by those who first  entered. Fifty yards from the wall stood the chariot.    \"Now you can leave us,\" Beric said to his followers, \"I will rejoin  you soon.\"    Berenice was crying bitterly, horror stricken at the sounds she had  heard, though happily she had seen nothing, being closely shut in  by the tall forms of her guard.    \"Thanks be to the gods that I have saved you, Berenice,\" Beric said,  \"and you also, Cneius! Now I must commit you to the care of the  driver of the chariot, who is one of my tribesmen. He will take you  to a retreat where you will, I trust, be in perfect safety until  the troubles are over. His mother has promised to do all in her  power for your comfort. You will find one of our huts but a rough  abode, but it will at least be a shelter.\"    \"Cannot you come with us, Beric?\" the girl sobbed.    \"That I cannot do, Berenice. I am a Briton and a chief, and I must  be with my tribe. And now I must away. Farewell, Berenice! may your  gods and mine watch over you! Farewell, my kind teacher!\"    He took off the torque, the collar formed of a number of small "]]]
