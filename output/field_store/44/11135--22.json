It was a large new coop  and built of strong material that made it very heavy.    \"Now,\" said Uncle Daniel, as the boys reached the shore and secured  their boat, \"all take a good hold.\"    Every inch of the rope that crossed the water's edge was soon covered  with somebody's hand.    \"All pull now!\" called Mr. Mason, and with a jerk in came the floating  house, chickens, ducks and all, and down went everybody that had  pulled. The force of the jerk, of course, threw them all to the ground,  but that was only fun and gave the boys a good chance to laugh.    Just as soon as the chickens reached the shore they scampered for  home--some flying, some running, but all making a noise.    \"We may as well finish the job,\" said Mr. Mason. \"Tom, go hitch Sable  up to  the cart and we'll bring the henhouse back where it belongs.\"    By running across the fields that were on the highest part of the road  Tom was able to get to his barn without a boat, and soon he returned  with the cart and Sable.    It took all hands to get the henhouse on the cart, but this was finally  done, and away went Sable up the road with the queer load after him in  the dump cart.    \"You had better put it up on the hill this time,\" Peter told them. \"The  water isn't gone down yet.\" So at last the chicken coop was settled,  and not a hen was missing.    There were many sights to be seen about Meadow Brook that afternoon,  and the boys enjoyed the flood, now that there was no longer any danger  to life.    Bert caught a big salmon and a black-spotted lizard that had been  flooded out from some dark place in the mountains, Harry found a pretty  toy canoe that some small boy had probably been playing with in the  stream before the water rose, and Jack was kept busy towing in all  kinds of stuff that had broken loose from barns along the pond.    Freddie had boots on, and was happy sailing his \"ark\" up and down the  road. He insisted on Snoop taking a ride, but cats do not fancy water  and the black kitten quickly hid himself up in the hay loft, out of  Freddie's reach.    Little by little the water fell, until by the next afternoon there was  no longer a river running through the roads. But there were plenty of  wet places and enough of streams washing down the rain the gutters to  give Freddie a fine canal to sail boats in.    Nan and Flossie had boats too which Bert and Harry made for them. In  fact, all the girls along Meadow Brook road found something that would  sail while the flood days lasted.    As it was still July the hot sun came down and dried things up pretty  quickly, but many haymows were completely spoiled, as were summer  vegetables that were too near the pond and came in for their share of  the washout.    This loss, however, was nothing compared with what had been expected by  the farmers, and all were satisfied that a kind Providence had saved  the valley houses from complete destruction.        CHAPTER XVIII    THE FRESH-AIR CAMP    Quiet had settled down once more upon the little village of Meadow  Brook. The excitement of the flood had died away, and now when the  month of July was almost gone, and a good part of vacation had gone  with it, the children turned their attention to a matter of new  interest--the fresh-air camp.    \"Mildred Manners was over to the camp yesterday,\" Nan told her mother,  \"and she says a whole lot of little girls have come out from the city,  and they have such poor clothes. There is no sickness there that anyone  could catch, she says (for her uncle is the doctor, you know), but  Mildred says her mother is going to show her how to make some aprons  for the little girls.\"    \"Why, that would be nice for all you little girls to do,\" said Mrs.  Bobbsey. \"Suppose you start a sewing school, and all see what you can  make!\"    \"Oh, that would be lovely!\" exclaimed Nan. \"When can we start?\"    \"As soon as we get the materials,\" the mother replied. \"We will ask  Aunt Sarah to drive over to the camp this afternoon; then we can see  what the children need.\"    \"Can I go?\" asked Flossie, much interested in the fresh-air work.    \"I guess so,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"If we take the depot wagon there will  be room for you and Freddie.\"    So that was how it came about that our little friends became interested  in the fresh-air camp. Nan and Mildred, Flossie and Freddie, with Aunt  Sarah and Mrs. Bobbsey, visited the camp in the afternoon.    \"What a queer place it is!\" whispered Flossie, as they drove up to the  tents on the mountain-side.    \"Hush,\" said Nan; \"they might hear you.\"    \"Oh, these are war-camps!\" exclaimed Freddie when he saw the white  tents. \"They're just like the war-pictures in my story book!\"    The matron who had charge of the camp came up, and when Mrs. Bobbsey  explained her business, the matron was pleased and glad to show them  through the place.    \"Oh, it was your boys who brought us all that money from the circus?\"  said the woman. \"That's why we have all the extra children here--the  circus money has paid for them, and they are to have two weeks on this  beautiful mountain.\"    \"I'm glad the boys were able to help,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"It really  was quite a circus.\"    \"It must have been, when they made so much money,\" the other answered.    \"And we are going to help now,\" spoke up Nan. \"We are starting a sewing  school.\"    \"Oh, I'm so glad somebody has thought of clothes,\" said the matron. \"We  often get gifts of food, but we need clothes so badly.\"    \"There is no sickness?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey, as they started on a tour  of the camp.    \"No; we cannot take sick children here now,\" said the matron. \"We had  some early in the season, but this is such a fine place for romping we  decided to keep this camp for the healthy children and have another for  those who are sick.\"    By this time numbers of little girls and boys crowded around the  visitors. They were quite different from the children of Meadow Brook  or Lakeport. Somehow they were smaller, but looked older. Poor children  begin to worry so young that they soon look much older than they really  are.    Nan and Mildred spoke kindly to the girls, while Freddie and Flossie  soon made friends with the little boys. One small boy, smaller than  Freddie, with sandy hair and beautiful blue eyes, was particularly  happy with Freddie. He looked better than the others, was almost as fat  as Freddie, and he had such lovely clear skin, as if somebody loved to  wash it.    \"Where do you lib?\" he lisped to Freddie.    \"At Uncle Daniel's,\" Freddie answered. \"Where do you live?\"    \"With mamma,\" replied the little boy. Then he stopped a minute. \"Oh,  no; I don't live with mamma now,\" he corrected himself, \"'cause she's  gone to heaven, so I live with Mrs. Manily.\"    Mrs. Manily was the matron, and numbers of the children called her  mamma.    \"Can I come over and play with you?\" asked the boy. \"What's your name?\"    \"His name is Freddie and mine is Flossie,\" said the latter. \"What is  your name?\"    \"Mine is Edward Brooks,\" said the little stranger, \"but everybody calls  me Sandy. Do you like Sandy better than Edward?\"    \"No,\" replied Flossie. \"But I suppose that's a pet name because your  hair is that color.\"    \"Is it?\" said the boy, tossing his sunny curls around. \"Maybe that's  why!\"    \"Guess it is,\" said Freddie. \"But will Mrs. Man let you come over to  our house?\"    \"Mrs. Manily, you mean,\" said Sandy. \"I'll just go and ask her.\"    \"Isn't he cute!\" exclaimed Flossie, and the pretty little boy ran in  search of Mrs. Manily.    \"I'm going to ask mamma if we can bring him home,\" declared Freddie.  \"He could sleep in my bed.\"    The others of the party were now walking through the big tents.    \"This is where we eat,\" the matron explained, as the dining room was  entered. The tent was filled with long narrow tables and had benches at  the  sides. The tables were covered with oilcloth, and in the center of  each was a beautiful bunch of fresh wild flowers--the small pretty kind  that grow in the woods.    \"You ought to see our poor children eat,\" remarked the matron. \"We have  just as much as we can do to serve them, they have such good appetites  from the country air.\"    \"We must send you some fresh vegetables,\" said Aunt Sarah, \"and some  fruit for Sunday.\"    \"We would be very grateful,\" replied Mrs Manily, \"for of course we  cannot afford much of a variety.\"    Next to the dining room was the dormitory or sleeping tent.    \"We have a little boys' brigade,\" said the matron, \"and every pleasant  evening they march around with drums and tin fifes. Then, when it is  bedtime, we have a boy blow the 'taps' on a tin bugle, just like real  soldiers do.\"    Freddie and Sandy had joined the sightseers now, and Freddie was much  interested in the brigade.    \"Who is the captain?\" he asked of Mrs. Manily.    \"Oh, we appoint a new captain each week from the very best boys we  have. We only let a very good boy be captain,\" the matron told him.    In the dormitory were rows and rows of small white cots. They looked  very clean and comfortable, and the door of this tent was closed with a  big green mosquito netting.    \"How old are your babies?\" asked Aunt Sarah.    \"Sandy is our baby!\" replied the matrons patting the little boy fondly,  \"and he is four years old. We cannot take them any younger without  their mothers.\"    \"Freddie is four also,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"What a dear sweet child  Sandy is!\"    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Manily, \"he has just lost a good mother and his father  cannot care for him--that is, he cannot afford to pay his board or hire  a housekeeper, so he brought him to the Aid Society. He is the pet of  the camp, and you can "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7140"],[0,"The Great Conspiracy, Complete (#17)"],[1," it is  said that 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are  created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain  inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted  among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.'  There, is the origin of Popular Sovereignty.  Who, then, shall come in  at this day and claim that he invented it?  The Lecompton Constitution  connects itself with this question, for it is in this matter of the  Lecompton Constitution that our friend, Judge Douglas, claims such vast  credit.  I agree that in opposing the Lecompton Constitution, so far as  I can perceive, he was right.  * * *  All the Republicans in the Nation  opposed it, and they would have opposed it just as much without Judge  Douglas's aid as with it.  They had all taken ground against it long  before he did.  Why, the reason that he urges against that Constitution,  I urged against him a year before.  I have the printed speech in my hand  now.  The argument that he makes, why that Constitution should not be  adopted, that the people were not fairly represented nor allowed to  vote, I pointed out in a speech a year ago which I hold in my hand now,  that no fair chance was to be given to the people.  * * *  The Lecompton  Constitution, as the Judge tells us, was defeated.  The defeat of it was  a good thing or it was not.  He thinks the defeat of it was a good  thing, and so do I, and we agree in that.  Who defeated it?  [A voice  --'Judge Douglas.']  Yes, he furnished himself, and if you suppose he  controlled the other Democrats that went with him, he furnished three  votes, while the Republicans furnished twenty.  That is what he did to  defeat it.  In the House of Representatives he and his friends furnished  some twenty votes, and the Republicans furnished ninety odd.  Now, who  was it that did the work?  * * *  Ground was taken against it by the  Republicans long before Douglas did it.  The proportion of opposition to  that measure is about five to one.\"    Mr. Lincoln then proceeded to take up the issues which Mr. Douglas had  joined with him the previous evening.  He denied that he had said, or  that it could be fairly inferred from what he had said, in his  Springfield speech, that he was in favor of making War by the North upon  the South for the extinction of Slavery, \"or, in favor of inviting the  South to a War upon the North, for the purpose of nationalizing  Slavery.\"  Said he: \"I did not even say that I desired that Slavery  should be put in course of ultimate extinction.  I do say so now,  however; so there need be no longer any difficulty about that.  * * *  I  am tolerably well acquainted with the history of the Country and I know  that it has endured eighty-two years half Slave and half Free.  I  believe--and that is what I meant to allude to there--I believe it has  endured, because during all that time, until the introduction of the  Nebraska Bill, the public mind did rest all the time in the belief that  Slavery was in course of ultimate extinction.  That was what gave us the  rest that we had through that period of eighty-two years; at least, so I  believe.    \"I have always hated Slavery, I think, as much as any Abolitionist--I  have been an Old Line Whig--I have always hated it, but I have always  been quiet about it until this new era of the introduction of the  Nebraska Bill began.  I always believed that everybody was against it,  and that it was in course of ultimate extinction.  * * *  The great mass  of the Nation have rested in the belief that Slavery was in course of  ultimate extinction.  They had reason so to believe.  The adoption of  the Constitution and its attendant history led the People to believe so,  and that such was the belief of the framers of the Constitution itself.  Why did those old men about the time of the adoption of the Constitution  decree that Slavery should not go into the new territory, where it had  not already gone?  Why declare that within twenty years the African  Slave Trade, by which Slaves are supplied, might be cut off by Congress?  Why were all these acts?  I might enumerate more of these acts--but  enough.  What were they but a clear indication that the framers of the  Constitution intended and expected the ultimate extinction of that  institution?    \"And now, when I say, as I said in my speech that Judge Douglas has  quoted from, when I say that I think the opponents of Slavery will  resist the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind  shall rest with the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction,  I only mean to say, that they will place it where the founders of this  Government originally placed it.  I have said a hundred times, and I  have now no inclination to take it back, that I believe there is no  right, and ought to be no inclination in the people of the Free States,  to enter into the Slave States, and interfere with the question of  Slavery at all.  I have said that always; Judge Douglas has heard me say  it--if not quite a hundred times, at least as good as a hundred times;  and when it is said that I am in favor of interfering with Slavery where  it exists, I know that it is unwarranted by anything I have ever  intended, and as I believe, by anything I have ever said.  If, by any  means, I have ever used language which could fairly be so construe (as,  however, I believe I never have) I now correct it.  So much, then, for  the inference that Judge Douglas draws, that I am in favor of setting  the Sections at War with one another.    \"Now in relation to his inference that I am in favor of a general  consolidation of all the local institutions of the various States * * *  I have said, very many times in Judge Douglas's hearing, that no man  believed more than I in the principle of self-government from beginning  to end.  I have denied that his use of that term applies properly.  But  for the thing itself, I deny that any man has ever gone ahead of me in  his devotion to the principle, whatever he may have done in efficiency  in advocating it.  I think that I have said it in your hearing--that I  believe each individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases with  himself and the fruit of his labor, so far as it in no wise interferes  with any other man's rights--that each community, as a State, has a  right to do exactly as it pleases with all the concerns within that  State that interfere with the rights of no other State, and that the  General Government, upon principle, has no right to interfere with  anything other than that general class of things that does concern the  whole.  I have said that at all times.    \"I have said, as illustrations, that I do not believe in the right of  Illinois to interfere with the cranberry laws of Indiana, the oyster  laws of Virginia, or the liquor laws of Maine.  I have said these things  over and over again, and I repeat them here as my sentiments.  * *   *  What can authorize him to draw any such inference?  I suppose there  might be one thing that at least enabled him to draw such an inference  that would not be true with me or many others, that is, because he looks  upon all this matter of Slavery as an exceedingly little thing--this  matter of keeping one-sixth of the population of the whole Nation in a  state of oppression and tyranny unequaled in the World.    \"He looks upon it as being an exceedingly little thing only equal to the  cranberry laws of Indiana--as something having no moral question in it  --as something on a par with the question of whether a man shall pasture  his land with cattle, or plant it with tobacco--so little and so small a  thing, that he concludes, if I could desire that anything should be done  to bring about the ultimate extinction of that little thing, I must be  in favor of bringing about an amalgamation of all the other little  things in the Union.    \"Now it so happens--and there, I presume, is the foundation of this  mistake--that the Judge thinks thus; and it so happens that there is a  vast portion of the American People that do not look upon that matter as  being this very little thing.  They look upon it as a vast moral evil;  they can prove it as such by the writings of those who gave us the  blessings of Liberty which we enjoy, and that they so looked upon it,  and not as an evil merely confining itself to the States where it is  situated; while we agree that, by the Constitution we assented to, in  the States where it exists we have no right to interfere with it,  because it is in the Constitution; and we are by both duty and  inclination to stick by that Constitution in all its letter and spirit,  from beginning to end.  * * *  The Judge can have no issue with me on a  question of establishing uniformity in the domestic regulations of the  States.  * * *    \"Another of the issues he says that is to be made with me, is upon his  devotion to the Dred Scott decision, and my opposition to it.  I have  expressed heretofore, and I now repeat, my opposition to the Dred Scott  decision; but I should be allowed to state the nature of that  opposition.  * * *  What is fairly implied by the term Judge Douglas has  used, 'resistance to the decision?'  I do not resist it.  If I wanted to  take Dred Scott from his master, I would be interfering with property  and that terrible difficulty that Judge Douglas speaks of, of  interfering with property, would arise.  But I am doing no such thing as  that, but all that I am doing is refusing to obey it, as a political  rule.  If I were in Congress, and a vote should come up on a question  whether Slavery should be prohibited in a new Territory, in spite of the  Dred Scott decision, I would vote that it should.  That is what I would  do.    \"Judge Douglas said last night, that before the decision he might  advance his opinion, and it might be contrary to the"]]]
