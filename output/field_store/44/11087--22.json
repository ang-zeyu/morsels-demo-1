Within two months his discerning  physician recognized that the self-interest which had started in the  physical damage of rapid eating of rich foods was developing into an  obsession more detrimental than the original physical disorder, and  thought it wise for him to discontinue study and return home to rest  for the summer. The thread was tangled.    The home-coming was not happy. From the first meal, the specialist's  warnings were in conflict with the home diet, and resentments were not  withheld from the good old dishes which had for a generation bedecked  the home table. The delicacy instinctive to the family and to his  earlier life was cast aside, and the subjects of food and its  digestion, of food-poisoning and its consequences, made unpleasant  every meal. Innocently and seriously the mother pointed to her good  health and to rugged ancestors who had lived long and hale,  unconsciously superior to food and drink. He brooked none of her  suggestions, and finally when she honestly could not see it all his  way, in the heat of his intensity he accused her of being to blame for  all his trouble: she had fed him wrong from the first; she had fed his  father wrong; the New York doctor had told him that certain mental  diseases could be caused by food-poisoning, and his father would not  have been a mental wreck, nor his own career cut short, had she only  known what wives and mothers of this generation should know, and set a  table which was not a laboratory of poison. These ideas, once  accepted, never left him. They formed a theme which, after finding  expression, recurred with ominously increasing frequency. A year  before, Harold Weston was a kindly fellow, almost retiring, but with a  peculiar lighting of his face in response which endeared him to  feminine hearts. On a variety of subjects he was well-informed, his  professors bespoke for him a high and honorable standing in the  judiciary, but, from the mass of this fine mind's possibilities, a  second wretched choice was now made. \"Father's typhoid affected his  mind, his brain must have been defective; my heredity is imperfect; my  first illness damages my class work. I can never go on in my  profession, there is no future for me but suffering.\" From this  wrecking thought it was an easy step to condemnation of his father for  his fatherhood, which, with his near-enmity toward his mother for her  \"criminal ignorance\" in rearing him, introduced a sordidly  demoralizing element into his mind which forever viciously tinctured  memories and relations which should have been his sacred helpers. The  normal mind can select well its world--miserably his mind lived with  these dregs of his own choice. The power of normal selection will, in  the best mind, be gradually lost through habitual surrender to the  morbid.    For the next year he lived unhappily in a home which he made unhappy.  Naturally thoughtful, he daily took long walks, brooding over his  wrongs--walks which brought him little benefit physically, as he  considered himself unable to put into them sufficient effort to wring  perspiration from his brow or toxins from his muscles. False  interpretation of his own symptoms increased with the abnormal  closeness of his scrutiny of them. His superficial knowledge he  accepted as final. Ignorant of the limitations of heredity, will and  judgment became subservient to pessimism, and the days marked a  gradual, deepening depression. The skein was asnarl.    A relative physician responded to the mother's call of distress and  spent a week in the home, then took Harold under his personal care to  a series of specialists--but not stomach specialists. Serious  treatment was carried out at home with a young physician as companion.  Two institutions offered the best help of their elaborate equipments  and perfected methods. Three years of badly discounted usefulness  passed. Long since had any call of responsibility ceased to elicit  response. Toward the end of this time he seemed better, and was  spending the summer at a health-resort, living a relatively normal  life. Fate then seemed to smile--dainty fingers appeared from the  nowhere, which promised gently, patiently, surely to loosen each  tangled snarl.    Eva Worth was another only child of affluence. She, too, was  recuperating, spending the summer at the same resort as Harold.  \"Overwork at college,\" it was said. Petite of person, pleasing in  manner, sweetly spoiled, with sympathies quickly born but usually  displaced by fresher interests, she was bright and responsive in mind,  and her attraction to Harold Weston gave promise of being the touch  needed to complete his restoration. Providence only knows the  possibilities latent in a union of these poor children of wealth. For  him there was an unquestioned awakening. The somber clouds of his  moods seemed destined to be transformed into delicate pastels by the  promises of love. It was more than an infatuation for them both, and  an understanding which was virtually an engagement left them happy  even in their parting. But happiness was not a word for Harold  Weston's conjuring. Throughout the weeks of his association with this  fair girl, the first woman for whom he had ever cared, the thought had  repeatedly come that he owed her a full and explicit explanation of  his illness and of his \"defective heredity.\" At home where the  brooding habit had grown strong and fixed, this idea became so  insistent, within two weeks, that he relieved the tension of its  demands by a long letter of details, which even to the sympathetic ear  of love were more than disquieting. The letter ended with a question  of her willingness to indicate a final decision in her response. The  appeal of his fine eyes was not there to help--other eyes were nearer.  Eva Worth was but twenty-two. Home training, the reading of much fine  literature, a college education, her own poor little heart, all failed  to bespeak for her wisdom in this crisis. An impulsive, almost  resentful refusal was sent. Second thoughts held more wisdom, for  woman's pity was now wisdom, so another day saw another letter, one  with a few saving words of hope. The first reply was handed to Harold  after luncheon. Quietly he left the house, apparently for one of his  afternoon walks. By morning he had not returned and a general alarm  went out. Some days later two boys, fishing in the river from an old  log, saw a cap in an eddy. No more has been seen or heard of Harold  Weston. A hasty hand, a hasty touch had broken the thread.    Two women were left to suffer. The elder, haunted by the re-echoings  of an only son's condemnation, lives out her years in a loneliness  which will not break, harrowed by questions of the wisdom of her  mother-love, the best she had to give. Some mother's son she may yet  help save, for she knows the vital error which shielded and guarded  her boy till he reached his majority, never having met trial,  hopelessly untrained in coping with adversity. The younger, sobered by  the voice of self-accusation, ever feels the weight of the  consciousness of a grave duty slighted; she was made more wise in a  day of deep reality than by twenty years of conventional training.  Tested again she would give as she has never known giving, give that  she might protect.          CHAPTER XII    THE TROUBLED SEA      A young woman, of rather striking appearance attired in her street  clothing, is standing beside her dresser. She has just returned from  town. She is of medium height, trim of figure, weighing about one  hundred and forty, with skin of a soft ivory tint and cheeks showing a  faint flush of health--or of excitement. Her dark hair waves  gracefully and the scattering strands of gray quite belie her youth.  The eyes are well placed, nearly black, and can sparkle on occasion.  Her rather poorly formed hands of many restless habits, are the only  apparent defect in this, externally attractive, young woman. She has  just broken the seal of a heavy vellum envelope addressed in a strange  feminine hand. It is an engraved announcement which reads:    \"Mrs. Pinkney Rogers announces the marriage of her daughter, Pearl  May, to Mr. Lee Burnham\"--    She never read the rest. She never saw the--\"on Tuesday, May thirtieth  nineteen hundred and one. At Home, Rome, Georgia, after July fifth.\"  Her sister, Addie, coming up the stairs, thought she heard a moan and  hurried in to find Stella lying in a crumpled heap. Addie's quick eye  noticed the announcement. She read it all, and destroyed it, and  through the years it was never mentioned by either of them. She,  alone, knew its relation to her sister's collapse, but with proverbial  southern pride never voiced her opinion of the tragic cause of her  older sister's years of nervous ill-health.    Mr. Beckman, Stella's father, was at this time about fifty-five. He  was the brunette parent from whom many of her more attractive physical  qualities had been inherited. He was proprietor of the best men's  furnishing store of the county's metropolis. His business was  moderately successful, built up, he felt, entirely through years of  his personal thought and attention, and it was practically his only  interest. Even his interesting family was a matter of course--though  the amount of the day's sales never became so. Mr. Beckman had a  single diversion. The store closed at ten o'clock Saturday nights;  between twelve and one its proprietor would reach home in an exalted  state, and for two hours poor Mrs. Beckman would hear his plans for  developing the biggest gent's clothing-business in the state, for  becoming a merchant-prince, emphasized with many a hearty slap on her  back. This weekly relaxation was always followed by a miserable Sunday  morning, invariably referred to by every member of the family as  \"another of Papa's sick headaches.\" Mrs. Beckman never lisped the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#17)"],[1,"which the body of      the sacrificed captive was disposed of--remains yet to be told. It      was delivered to the warrior who had taken him in battle, and by      him, after being dressed, was served up in an entertainment to his      friends. This was not the coarse repast of famished cannibals, but      a banquet teeming with delicious beverages and delicate viands,      prepared with art, and attended by both sexes, who, as we shall see      hereafter, conducted themselves with all the decorum of civilized      life. Surely, never were refinement and the extreme of barbarism      brought so closely in contact with each other. [32]    Such are the depths of depravity to which a people may sink when  once the Spirit of God is withdrawn from them. It is not to excite  reflections upon this condition of refined barbarism, however, that  these quotations are made. I am interested here only in pointing out  the fact that these revolting customs found among the native Americans  confirms the statement made in the Book of Mormon, that such horrible  customs had their origin among their Nephite and Lamanite ancestors.    IV.    _Burying the Hatchet._    Doubtless the native American custom of \"burying the hatchet\" (that  is, in concluding a war, it is the native custom, as a testimony  that hostilities have ceased, and as a sign of peace, to bury the  war-hatchet or other weapons of war), had its origin in the following  Book of Mormon incident: Early in the first century B. C., a number of  Nephites, sons of King Mosiah II., succeeded in converting a number of  Lamanites to the Christian religion; and such became their abhorrence  of war, which aforetime had been one of their chief delights, that they  entered into a covenant of peace and determined no more to shed the  blood of their fellow men. In token of this covenant they buried their  weapons of war, their leader saying:        And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to destroy us, behold,      we will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them deep in      the earth, that they may be kept bright. * * * * And now it came      to pass that when the king had made an end of these sayings, and      all the people were assembled together, they took their swords, and      all the weapons which were used for the shedding of man's blood,      and they did bury them up deep in the earth; and this they did, it      being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they      never would use weapons again for shedding a man's blood. [33]    This circumstance of burying weapons of war in token of peace is  several times afterwards alluded to in the Book of Mormon.    V.    _Hagoth's Marine Migrations Preserved in Native Legend._    Another historical event very apt to live in the native traditions is  the first Nephite migration in ships after their landing in the western  hemisphere. This event took place in the latter half of the century  immediately preceding the birth of Christ. One Hagoth, described in the  Book of Mormon as \"an exceedingly curious man,\"        Went forth and built a large ship on the borders of the land      Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launched it forth in the      west sea, by the narrow neck which led into the land northward.      And behold, there were many of the Nephites who did enter therein      and did sail forth with much provisions, and also many women and      children; and they took their course northward. [34]    Subsequently other ships were built and the first returned, and  migration by this method of travel was kept up for some time. Finally  two of the vessels conducting this migration by the way of the west  sea, were lost; and the Nephites supposed them to have been wrecked  in the depths of the sea. [35] So marked a circumstance as this, I  repeat, occurring as it did among a people that can not be considered  as a sea-faring people, would be apt to live in the traditions of their  descendants. Such a tradition, I believe, exists. Bancroft, speaking  of a war of conquest waged by the Miztec and Zapotec kings against  a people inhabiting the southern shores of Tehuantepec, called the  Huaves, says:        The Huaves are said to have come from the south, from Nicaragua,      or Peru, say some authors. The causes that led to their migrations      are unknown; but the story goes that after coasting northward, and      attempting to disembark at several places, they finally effected      a landing at Tehuantepec. Here they found the Mijes, the original      possessors of the country; but these they drove out, or, as some      say, mingled with them, and soon made themselves masters of the      soil. * * * * * * * But the easy life they led in this beautiful      and fertile region soon destroyed their ancient energy, and they      subsequently fell an unresisting prey to the Zapotec kings. [36]    A tradition which locates the landing of a similar maritime expedition  still further north is related by Nadaillac. Speaking of the  \"Kitchen-Middens\" or shell-heaps found here and there on the Pacific  coast, and which our author takes as indicating the location of the  former homes of numerous tribes, says:        When the Indians were questioned about them [the shell-heaps]      they generally answered that they are very old, and are the work      of people unknown to them or to their fathers. As an exception to      this rule, however, the Californians attributed a large shell heap      formed of mussel shells and the bones of animals, on Point St.      George, near San Francisco, to the Hohgates, the name they give to      seven mythical strangers who arrived in the country from the sea,      and who were the first to build and live in houses. The Hohgates      killed deer, sea-lions, and seals; they collected the mussels      which were very abundant on the neighboring rocks, and the refuse      of their meals became piled up about their homes. One day when      fishing, they saw a gigantic seal; they managed to drive a harpoon      into it, but the wounded animal fled seaward, dragging the boat      rapidly with it toward the fathomless abysses of the Charekwin.      At the moment when the Hohgates were about to be engulfed in the      depths, where those go who are to endure eternal cold, the rope      broke the seal disappeared, and the boat was flung up into the air.      Since then the Hohgates, changed into brilliant stars, return no      more to earth, where the shell heaps remain as witness of their      former residence. [37]    The word \"Hohgates,\" I believe is but a variation of the word \"Hagoth,\"  the name of the man who started these maritime expeditions, and it  would be altogether in keeping with Nephite customs [38] for those who  sailed away in his vessels to be called \"Hagothites\" or \"Hohgates.\"  The vessel of this tradition may be one of those lost to the Nephites,  which finally found its way to the Californian coast where its  occupants landed with their ideas of Nephite civilization, and lived  as described in the tradition. One is tempted to smile at the childish  ending of the tradition; but under it may not one see that it is but  the legendary account of the fact that the vessel sailed away from the  California shores and was lost, or, at least, was heard of no more by  the natives of those shores.    VI.    _Native American Race Unity._    The subject of American antiquities should not be closed without a  brief reference, at least, to the unity of the American race. Barring  such migrations of other races to America as may have taken place since  the fall of the Nephites at Cumorah, at the close of the fourth century  A. D., and such as to a limited extent may have been going on in the  extreme north via Behring Strait at an earlier date, the Book of Mormon  requires substantial unity of race in the later native American people.  That is to say, they ought to be of Israelitish descent, a mixture of  the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh and Judah--but chiefly, if not all, of  Hebrew descent; and even the Jaredites were but a more ancient branch  of the same stock. [39]    On this subject, as upon all others pertaining to American antiquities  and peoples, writers are divided; yet it is not difficult to marshal in  support of race unity for native Americans the very highest authority;  and what is of most importance is the facts are beyond question behind  their theory.    Citing the facts on which certain authors rely to establish the unity  of the American race, Bancroft says:        It was obvious to the Europeans when they first beheld the natives      of America, that these were unlike the intellectual white-skinned      race of Europe, the barbarous blacks of Africa, or any nation or      people which they had hitherto encountered, yet were strikingly      like each other. Into whatsoever part of the newly discovered      lands they penetrated, they found a people seemingly one in color,      physiognomy, customs, and in mental and social traits. Their      vestiges of antiquity and their languages presented a coincidence      which was generally observed by early travelers. Hence physical      and psychological comparisons are advanced to prove ethnological      resemblances among all the peoples of America. * * * * * * Morton      and his confreres, the originators of the American homogeneity      theory, even go so far as to claim for the American man an origin      as indigenous as that of the fauna and flora. They classify all the      tribes of America, excepting only the Esquimaux who wandered over      from Asia, as the American race, and divided it into the American      family and the Toltecan family. Blumenbach classifies the Americans      as a distinct species. The American Mongolidae of Dr. Latham are      divided into Esquimaux and American Indians. Dr. Morton perceives      the same characteristic lineaments on the face of the Fuegian and      the"]]]
