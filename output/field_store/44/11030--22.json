Now, so  far as legislation is concerned, the growth of crime in France  certainly cannot be attributed to the relaxation of punishment.  The legislative reforms which have taken place, especially in 1832  and 1863, on the general revision of the penal code, modified  punishments to some extent, but with the definite purpose and  result, as shown by the same official records of criminal  statistics, of strengthening the repressive power of the law by  providing for the application of less aggravated punishments.  The  repugnance of juries and judges against excessive punishments, and  their preference for acquittal, is, indeed, a psychological law.  Moreover, it is well known that if there is in Europe a penal code  less mild than any of the rest, it is that of France, which is the  oldest of those now in force, and still retains much of the  military rigour of its origin.  And it must be added that for  certain crimes, as for rapes and indecent assaults, which are  nevertheless constantly increasing in France, the punishments have  been increased by several successive enactments.  The same is true  of extortion by threats of exposure, which occurs more and more  frequently, as M. Joly also observes, in spite of the severe  punishments of the law of 1863.  <p 86>    The question, therefore, is reduced to judicial repression, the  progress whereof must be observed in the past half-century, for it  has evidently the greatest influence upon crime.  Laws, in fact,  have no real operation if they are not applied more or less  rigorously; for in the social strata which contribute most to  criminality the laws are known only by their practical  application, which is also the only truly defensive function,  carrying with it a special preventive of the repetition of the  crime by the person condemned.    Thus the arguments of jurists and legislators have not much value  for the criminal sociologist when they are based solely on the  psychological illusion that the dangerous classes trouble  themselves about the shaping of a penal code, as the more  instructed and less numerous classes might well do.  The dangerous  classes attend to the sentences of the judges, and still more to  the execution of those sentences, than to the articles of a code.  In this connection I cannot agree with the forecast of Garofalo as  to the perilous effect of the abolition of capital punishment in  Italy on the imagination of the people; for he was well aware  that, though it is defined in various articles of the old code,  and in about sixty sentences every year, the punishment of death  has not been carried out, which is the essential point, for the  last fifteen years.    The elements which determine the greater or less severity of  judicial repression are of two kinds:--    1.  The ratio of persons acquitted to the total number of  prisoners put on their trial.    2.  The ratio of the severest punishments to the total number of  prisoners condemned.  <p 87>    Certainly the proportion of acquittals ought not to indicate a  difference in the severity of repression as such, for condemnation  or acquittal ought to point merely to the certainty or otherwise  of guilt, the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence.  But,  as a matter of fact, the proportional increase of convictions does  partly represent greater severity on the part of the judges, and  still more of the juries, who display it by attaching weight to  somewhat unconvincing evidence, or in too readily admitting  circumstances which tend to aggravate the offence.  This is  confirmed also by the rarity of acquittals in cases of contumacy.    Of these two factors the former is certainly the more important,  for it is a psychological law that man, in regard to punishment as  to any other kind of suffering, is more affected by the certainty  than by the gravity of the infliction.  And it is to the credit of  criminal theorists of the classical school that they have steadily  maintained that a mild yet certain punishment is more effectual  than one which, being severe in itself, holds out a stronger hope  of escaping it.  Nevertheless it is a fact that they have carried  the theory too far, by seeking to obtain excessive mitigations and  abbreviations of punishment, without exerting themselves to secure  certainty by reforms of procedure and police administration.    The diminution of the rate of acquittal is evident and continuous,  both at the Assizes and in the Tribunals, except for the last  quadrennial period.  This may of course indicate a more careful  management of the trials by the judges; but it certainly shows  <p 88>an undoubted tendency towards increased judicial severity,  which, meanwhile, has not arrested the growth of crime.

The number  has, in fact, constantly diminished, especially in summary  proceedings, which is just where the greatest increase of crime is  manifest.    Passing now to the other factor of judicial repression, that is to  the percentage of persons sentenced to graver kinds of punishment,  we have to take into account, amongst assize cases in France, the  prisoners <p 89>sentenced to death, penal servitude, and solitary  imprisonment, excluding such as are sentenced to correctional  punishment (simple imprisonment and fines) as well as young  prisoners sent to reformatories; and in regard to the Tribunals,  we must take the percentages of those who are condemned to  imprisonment, which is the most serious punishment, the remainder  being fined, or handed over to their parents, or sent to  reformatories.

On the other hand, we  can see that, in the assize cases, excluding the first period,  before the revision of 1832, whilst capital punishment shows a  certain diminution (especially due to the laws of 1832, 1848, &c.,  which reduced the number of cases involving the death penalty),  though continuing at a certain level since 1861, sentences of  penal servitude and solitary confinement show a con<p 90>tinued  increase from the second period, and especially since 1851.    So also at the Tribunals, except for a few oscillations, as in the  ninth period, there is a sustained increase of repression.    And the fact that this increased ratio of the more serious  punishments actually indicates a greater severity on the part of  the judges can only be contested on the ground of a simultaneous  increase of the more serious crimes and offences.  On the other  hand, we note in France a general decrease of crimes against the  person (except for assaults on children), and still more of crimes  against property.    There is also a striking confirmation in the corresponding  acquittals and condemnations of a more serious character.  We see,  in fact, that the more serious condemnations increase precisely  when the acquittals decrease (as in the 4th, 6th, 7th, and 10th  periods at the Assizes, and the 2nd, 5th, and 8th periods at the  Tribunals); whilst in the years of more frequent acquittals there  is also a diminution of more serious punishments, as in the 5th  and 8th periods at the Assizes.  That is to say, the two sets of  statistics actually indicate a greater or less severity on the  part of juries and judges.    This firmer repression is demonstrated in spite of the continued  increase of attenuating circumstances, which rose at the Assizes  from 50 per cent. in 1833 to 73 per cent. in 1806, and at the  Tribunals from 54 per cent. in 1851 to 65 per cent. in 1886.  Nevertheless it is a fact that the number of cases tried by  default at the Assizes has continuously decreased <p 91>from a  yearly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47703"],[0,"Wilford Woodruff, Fourth President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day (#17)"],[1,"r's, Weakley County, Tennessee. After the meeting, Mr. Crider was  baptized. A mob gathered and threatened us, and poisoned our horses, so  that the one I rode, belonging to Samuel West, died a few days after.  This horse had carried me thousands of miles while preaching the gospel.    \"I continued to travel with Brothers Smoot, Patten, and Parrish in  Tennessee and Kentucky, and we baptized all who would receive our  testimony. On the 2nd day of December we held a general conference at  Damon Creek Branch. Elder Thomas B. Marsh, President of the Twelve  Apostles, presided. All the branches in Tennessee and Kentucky were  represented. Brothers Randolph Alexander, Benjamin L. Clapp, and  Johnson F. Lane were ordained elders, and Lindsay Bradey was ordained  to the lesser priesthood. I assisted President Marsh to obtain fifteen  hundred dollars from the Southern brethren to enter land in Missouri  for the Church. The brethren made me a present of fifty dollars, which  I sent by President Marsh to enter forty acres of land for me. Elder  Smoot and I were released from the Southern mission, with permission to  go to Kirtland.\"    During his mission, Wilford Woodruff organized a company of Saints, and  went with them a short distance, starting them on the way to Zion--a  portion of the work of gathering in which he did so much subsequently,  both in the United States and Great Britain. Most of his travels for  over two years had been on {62} foot. Since leaving Richland, New York,  he had journeyed over six thousand miles. Under his administration the  sick were healed, mobacrats were destroyed by the power of God, light  from heaven had been sent in the darkness of the night to lead him from  a lost condition in the forest and to save him from being dashed to  pieces over a rocky precipice, other miracles were wrought, and Wilford  Woodruff, in his early youth and manhood, had become in a marked degree  a choice witness for God and for the divine mission of Joseph Smith,  the Prophet.    Let it be remembered, too, that to enjoy all this power it was not  necessary to be an apostle, a patriarch, a high priest, or a seventy.  For the greater part of his mission, Wilford Woodruff was only a  priest after the order of Aaron. Like John the Baptist, he magnified  his calling; his soul was in the work; he loved his fellowbeings, and  yearned for their salvation. His whole experience is a striking lesson  worthy of being learned, and an example to be followed profitably by  all the young men and elders of Israel. More than once, thousands of  the Saints have heard Wilford Woodruff say in assemblies of worship  that in all his life he never had enjoyed more of the spirit and power  of God than when he was a priest doing missionary work in the Southern  States.    His first mission being completed, he approached the city of the  Saints--Kirtland--whence he had departed over two years previously.  \"The Temple of the Lord,\" says he, \"came in sight--first in importance  to our vision. I truly rejoiced when the House of the Lord rose into  view as we drew near to this Stake of Zion. It was the first time I  had seen the Temple of God--the first Temple built in this generation.  After my long absence, I rejoiced greatly to strike hands with the  Prophet Joseph, and with many others engaged in rolling on the mighty  work of the Lord in the last days.    \"Two years and a half had elapsed,\" he writes further, \"since I left  Kirtland with my brethren in poverty to go up to visit our brethren  in tribulation in Zion. The Saints at Kirtland were then poor,  despised, and looked upon by the pomp of Babylon with disdain, and  people watched with eager eyes to behold them sink into forgetfulness.  But what a change has come! Now I behold a cheerfulness beaming from  every countenance, {63} and the scenes around indicate prosperity. The  noise of the ax and the hammer, the stir of their bank and market, and  especially the presence of the House of God, speak in language loud  as thunder that the Saints will have a city in spite of all the false  prophets of Baal, and in spite of even earth and hell combined, because  God is with them, and His Temple stands in honor of His Kingdom, while  Babylon begins to wonder and soon will perish.\"    {64}        CHAPTER 8.    IN KIRTLAND, 1836.    Wilford's First Attendance at Meeting in the Temple.--Called to  Speak.--Church's Attitude Toward the Use of Liquor.--Wilford in the  First Quorum of Seventy.--Receives Temple Endowments.--Troubles  in Kirtland.--Greatness of the Prophet Joseph.--Wilford's  Marriage.--Receives a Patriarchal Blessing.    The missionary experiences of Wilford Woodruff in the Southern States  gave to him a firmness and a comprehension that came from the testimony  of the spirit of God. From the day he joined the Church, he was in  active service. He was not among those who required special training  and who needed the constant guidance of the leaders to keep them within  the bounds of the Church. His first experience was in Zion's Camp. He  remained a short time in Missouri and then set out upon his mission.  His life was therefore governed by the workings of the spirit within  him. That spirit was his guide--the rock upon which his faith and  understanding were established. His return, therefore, to Kirtland did  not subject him to the temptations of evil, nor to the rebukes of the  Prophet. He knew that he was about his Father's business and was not  swerved by the sophistries of men, or the speculative spirit of those  times.    When he entered the city, he beheld, to his great joy, the Temple of  the Lord. It contained for him grand opportunities. Its ordinances  which he so fervently revered gave comfort and consolation to his life.  On Sunday the 27th, 1836, he attended his first public meeting in the  Temple. He had visited the building previously and viewed with pleasure  its sacred apartments. On the forenoon of that day in company with  Elders Warren Parrish and A. O. Smoot, he listened with pleasure to  the words of Elder S. Carter, and to an impressive discourse from the  Prophet Joseph.    In the afternoon of the same day, Elders Woodruff and A. O. Smoot  were invited to address the congregation. Elder Woodruff first opened  by prayer and then turned at random to a page in the Bible. To his  surprise, he opened to the 56th chapter of Isaiah, the same chapter he  had turned to on the night of his {65} eventful prayer in Connecticut.  Here the memories of that night flashed upon his mind, and he told  the incidents thereof with impressive force and inspiration upon the  congregation. The people were greatly interested. Those who knew the  voice of the good shepherd recognized in him a man truly born of the  spirit of God, a fit companion of prophets and apostles.    On the 1st of December, 1836, he attended for the first time in his  life a meeting called for the purpose of giving certain persons their  patriarchal blessings. Father Joseph Smith was the patriarch of the  Church in those days. This new experience brought to him new evidences  that the God of the Bible, the God of the patriarchs of old,--Abraham,  Isaac, and Jacob,--was truly the God of the new dispensation whose  spirit and purposes were kindred to those in ancient times when the  patriarchs of old blest the people.    The spiritual manifestations of those times in Kirtland brought with  them heartfelt desires to observe every rule of correct living. That  spirit was not at all in harmony with the use of intoxicating liquors;  and whatever became an obstacle to the spirit of worship must be  removed if the worship were to be enjoyed. It was important that the  use of liquor should be discontinued, and Elder Woodruff records in  his journal that on the 4th day of December, that year, Sidney Rigdon  called for a vote of the people on the discontinuance of the use of  liquor in the Church both in sickness and in health. An exception to  the rule was made in the case of the washing of the bodies; and under  proper regulations, wine might be used for the Sacrament. The vote was  unanimous.    On the 11th of December, the Prophet sharply rebuked the Kirtland  Saints for their sins and backsliding. He warned them to repent,  lest judgment should come upon them as it had come upon the Saints  in Jackson County, Missouri. Those were trying times. They were days  of separation when it became necessary to separate the unworthy from  those who were of the household of faith. Kirtland was not to be the  abiding place of the Saints. They must give up their possessions and  their love for the city they had striven so hard to adorn. Many had  placed themselves in opposition to a divine purpose whose wisdom they  could not comprehend. That opposition invited the {66} presence of the  evil one who both tempted and beguiled them. Wilford Woodruff, however,  was among those who could say then, as he ever after kept himself in a  condition to say, \"Thy will, not mine be done.\"    Before the close of 1836, there came to Elder Woodruff one of those  choice blessings which he esteemed so highly. He was advanced in the  priesthood to a place in the first quorum of seventies. His faithful  friend and missionary companion, A. O. Smoot, was likewise ordained  to the office of a seventy. This ordination of his friend was in  fulfillment of a prophesy which he had pronounced upon the head of  Elder Smoot on the 30th day of June, that year, while they were  together in Tennessee. The call of Wilford Woodruff to take his place  in the first quorum of seventy took place on the 3rd day of January,  1837, though he had been ordained to his new calling in the priesthood  on the 20th of the preceeding December. His love for missionary service  made this calling one of special honor to him. To be a witness for  Jesus Christ to the nations was his soul's delight. The manner in which  he honored that calling is known to all who are at all "]]]
