Another of her sons, Alberic,  so called from his supposed father, jealous of his brother John, cast  him and his mother Marozia into prison. After a time Alberic's son was  elected pope, A. D. 956; he assumed the title of John XII., the amorous  Marozia thus having given a son and a grandson to the papacy. John was  only nineteen years old when he thus became head of Christendom. His  reign was characterized by the most shocking immoralities, so that  the Emperor Otho I. was compelled by the German clergy to interfere.  A synod was summoned for his trial in the Church of St. Peter, before  which it appeared that John had received bribes for the consecration  of bishops, that he had ordained one who was but ten years old, and  had performed that ceremony over another in a stable; he was charged  with incest with one of his father's concubines, and with so many  adulteries that the Lateran Palace had become a brothel; he put out  the eyes of one ecclesiastic and castrated another, both dying in  consequence of their injuries; he was given to drunkenness, gambling,  and the invocation of Jupiter and Venus. When cited to appear before  the council, he sent word that 'he had gone out hunting;' and to the  fathers who remonstrated with him, he threateningly remarked 'that  Judas, as well as the other disciples, received from his master the  power of binding and loosing, but that as soon as he proved traitor  to the common cause, the only power he retained was that of binding  his own neck.' Hereupon he was deposed, and Leo VIII. elected in his  stead, A. D. 963; but subsequently getting the upper hand, he seized  his antagonists, cut off the hand of one, the nose, finger, tongue of  others. His life was eventually brought to an end by the vengeance of a  man whose wife he had seduced.    \"After such details it is almost needless to allude to the annals of  succeeding popes; to relate that John XIII. was strangled in prison;  that Boniface VII. imprisoned Benedict VII., and killed him by  starvation; that John XIV. was secretly put to death in the dungeons  of the castle of St. Angelo; that the corpse of Boniface was dragged  by the populace through the streets. The sentiment of reverence for  the sovereign pontiff, nay, even of respect, had become extinct in  Rome; throughout Europe the clergy were so shocked at the state of  things that, in their indignation, they began to look with approbation  on the intention of the Emperor Otho to take from the Italians their  privilege of appointing the successor of St. Peter, and confine it to  his own family. But his kinsman, Gregory V., whom he placed on the  pontifical throne, was very soon compelled by the Romans to fly; his  excommunications and religious thunders were turned into derision by  them; they were too well acquainted with the true nature of these  terrors; they were living behind the scenes. A terrible punishment  awaited the Anti-pope John XVI. Otho returned into Italy, seized  him, put out his eyes, cut off his nose and tongue, and sent him  through the streets mounted on an ass, with his face to the tail, and  a wine-bladder on his head. It seemed impossible that things could  become worse; yet Rome had still to see Benedict IX., A. D. 1033, a  boy of less than twelve years, raised to the apostolic throne. Of this  pontiff, one of his successors, Victor III., declared that his life was  so shameful, so foul, so execrable, that he shuddered to describe it.  He ruled like a captain of a banditti rather than a prelate. The people  at last, unable to bear his adulteries, homicides and abominations any  longer, rose against him. In despair of maintaining his position, he  put up the papacy to auction. It was bought by a presbyter named John,  who became Gregory V., A. D. 1045.\"    \"More than a thousand years had elapsed since the birth of our Savior,  and such was the condition of Rome. Well may the historian shut the  annals of those times in disgust; well may the heart of the Christian  sink within him at such a catalogue of hideous crime; well may he ask,  Were these the viceregents of God upon earth--those who had truly  reached that goal beyond which the last effort of human wickedness  cannot pass?\" [21]    Is it not difficult to reconcile one's mind to the thought that  these men who ruled the Catholic Church for three centuries were the  viceregents of God on earth? Or that through them a divine authority  and a divine mission has been transmitted to later and happier times?  To do so one would be under the necessity of maintaining that no amount  of immorality, however infamous, can possibly disqualify men from  acting as God's representatives. And such a position would be contrary  to all the evidence of scripture, as well as revolting to sound reason.    Footnotes    1. Compare Luke x with Matt. x.    2. Acts xiv: 23.

This also is the view of Clement of Rome  who, in writing to the Corinthians in the third century, says of the  apostles: \"So preaching everywhere in country and town, they appointed  their first fruits when they had proved them by the spirit, to be  bishops and deacons unto them that should believe. And this they did do  in no new fashion; for indeed it had been written concerning bishops  and deacons from very ancient times; for thus saith the scriptures in a  certain place: 'I will appoint their bishops in righteousness and their  deacons in faith.'\"    4.

In this connection it may be observed that the vacancy in the  quorum of the Twelve, occasioned by the apostasy of Judas, was filled  (Acts i: 24-26). Paul, too, though not in the original Twelve was an  Apostle, and so subscribes himself in nearly all his letters. Clement  of Alexandria, an elder and writer of the second century, calls Clement  of Rome, the \"Apostle Clement.\" Though whether this is meant in a  rather loose sense or because he had been ordained such by one of the  apostles--for he was an associate of both Peter and Paul--does not  appear.

It yet remains to note some of those changes in the public worship of  the church, and in the ordinances of the gospel, which contributed to  the great apostasy.    The simplicity of the Christian religion was made a reproach to the  Church of Christ by the pagan priests. \"The Christians have no temples,  therefore they have no gods,\" was an argument sufficiently convincing  to the heathens. It was but natural, perhaps, to seek to cast off this  reproach; but the effort to do so led to the introduction of many  ceremonies quite at variance with the gospel. The early Christian  Saints were accustomed to meet on the first day of the week for public  worship; the meetings, during the first century at least, being held,  for the most part, in private houses. The ceremonies were of the  simplest character. They consisted of reading the scriptures, the  exhortation of the president of the assembly--\"neither eloquent nor  long, but full of warmth and love,\" [1]--the testimony of such as felt  moved upon by the Holy Ghost to bear testimony, exhort or prophesy; the  singing of hymns; the administration of the sacrament and prayers.    But all this was soon changed. The bishops and other public teachers in  the third century, framed their discourses and exhortations according  to the rules of Grecian eloquence; \"and were better adapted,\" says a  learned writer, [2] \"to call forth the admiration of the rude multitude  who love display, than to amend the heart. And that no folly and no  senseless custom might be omitted in their public assemblies, the  people were allowed to applaud their orators, as had been practiced  in the forums and theatres; nay, they were instructed both to applaud  and to clap the preachers.\" This was a wide departure from that spirit  of meekness and humility enjoined by Messiah upon his ministers. And  when to these customs was added the splendid vestments of the clergy,  the magnificence of the temples, with all the pageantry of altars,  surrounded with burning tapers, clouds of incense, beautiful images,  the chanting of choirs, processions and other mummeries without  number--one sees but little left of that simple worship instituted by  the Messiah and his apostles.    About the third century incense began to be used. The Christians of  the first and second centuries abhorred the use of incense in public  worship as being a part of the worship of idols. [3] It first became a  custom to use it at funerals against offensive smells; then in public  worship to disguise the bad air of crowded assemblies; then at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],[0,"The Romance of Book-Collecting (#17)"],[1,"also, but, since  wigs had escaped the fashion of fifty years before, it merely clung to  his hair instead, and powdered it gray before its time.  Half a century  ago the England which for the most part was free from the shriek of the  railway-whistle and the rumble of traffic harboured such men as these in  their hundreds.  They came from the last century, and the further their  pilgrimage in this the more they haunted the rustic element in which  they moved.  They were, in their way, magicians, wearing the consecrated  pentacles of Agrippa, 'that man of parts, who dived into the secrets of  all arts, that second Solomon, the mighty Hee, that try'de them all, and  found them Vanity.'    Naturally enough, when one of these old-time bookworms left his  seclusion to mix with the whirl and throng of the London thoroughfares,  he was swallowed up, as though he had never been, in a huge vortex of  unappreciative apathy, for the man in the street never has time to  dream, and such books as he affects are ledgers.  But he might have  strayed into some square which the tide, ebbing westward, had left  desolate, and met his counterpart sitting, as he himself did when at  home, in the midst of vellum-bound classics far into the night.  Indeed,  when he came to London, which was but seldom, it would be to visit  another bookworm, just as the stage-doorkeeper of the present day spends  his evening off at the entrance to another theatre, because he cannot  get away, even in spirit, from his life's work and enterprise. Were we  to look for these old book-men now, we should look in vain, for the  century is fast drawing to its close, and a younger generation has  occupied their seats.    The transition from the old to the new in the matter of books and all  that pertains to them, has been very gradual.  It commenced about fifty  years ago, or a little earlier, and was due, perhaps, to the spirit of  unrest fostered by an improved and quicker system of communication in a  country of very small area, absolutely incapable of enlargement.  We see  a mighty change in everything external, and it is not surprising that  our social habits should have experienced a revolution.  Round goes the  wheel, slowly and persistently, and we go with it, though daily custom  and daily experience has a tendency to mask its motion.  One day, sooner  or later, we start up and look for the familiar landmarks.  They are  gone.  New ones, not at all familiar, but still recognisable, have taken  their place, and then we know that time has slipped away while we were  dreaming, and that nothing can possibly be done but to take the future  by the forelock, and to rush on for a brief space with the rest.    And so it is with books, and ever has been. Fifty years and more ago,  time waited upon them and stood still; now they are carried along  unceasingly, and have no rest.  Every year the speed increases.  Old  companions of the shelf are whirled into space and parted for ever; the  very men who buy them are changed in their aspirations, their tastes,  and their desires, and in a very short time they will change again, and  yet again. They are swayed and driven by Fashion, and this is how  Fashion lives.    There was something about the dry-as-dust bookworm which, however  consonant with antiquated modes of thought and action, was nevertheless  felt to be utterly unsuitable to changed conditions.  Men must and will  read, and to accumulate is equally natural.  A life of easy contentment  engenders one mode of thought, a life of enterprise another; and the  transition from the narrow limits of a prison-bound study to the open  air is precisely what might have been expected to occur.    Men there were, as I have said, in plenty, who refused to quit the  time-honoured traditions of their race; but on every side of them were  being born lighter spirits, to whom colossal and intricate volumes were  as heavy as lead.  We see the changed nature of their tastes in the  craving for art, and the outcome of it in scores and hundreds of  miscellanies which began to be published about the year 1830, and held  imperial sway on drawing-room tables for ten years or more.    Fisher's 'Scrap-Book,' and numerous other artistically got up volumes  full of excerpts and elegant extracts, illustrated by some of the first  engravers of the time, were extremely fashionable in those days, and for  light and casual reading very probably supplied all that was necessary.  The poets, from the Earl of Surrey onward, were served up in dainty  plats, and the best prose authors were disembowelled with remarkable  skill. The ingenious Martin Tupper, observing this transformation scene,  brought joy into many households by laying down, in the form of explicit  statements, matters of theological controversy which had in their day  fed the Smithfield fires till they roared and blazed like those of  Moloch.    These books were for the cultured, to whom the random books of Pierce  Egan and William Combe were positively distasteful, and who, having  neither the time nor the inclination to bury themselves deeply in  classic lore, eagerly welcomed anything which appealed to their better  selves and, at the same time, did not too severely tax their brains.  The very style and nature of the books which were published at this  period show as conclusively as anything can do the great change which  was gradually creeping over the public mind.    Smollett and Swift were becoming coarse, and Hogarth, in his realm of  art, was already much worse.  Mrs. Radcliffe and the Rev. Mr. Maturin  stalked like a couple of terrifying ghosts hung about with chains,  wailing their lost home.  They invariably spoke of haunted caverns, and  the wind rumbling itself to sleep in the recesses of ruined chimneys.  Their novels were the delight of these same dry-as-dusts, to whom the  new age had said farewell, but who, in their impenetrable fastnesses,  still revelled, though in numbers yearly decreasing, in 'The Raven,'  with its soul-quaking refrain, in the 'Castle of Otranto,' and 'The  Bravo of Venice.'  Things of graver mood they could not find had they  searched the entire catalogue of English literature, from the metrical  poems of Caedmon, chanted to the winds of Whitby, down to the newest  poem or novel.    The new school called the old 'unhealthy,' that being a not inapt  adjective with which to express the absence of brightness and chic,  qualities which came, as everything else comes, when called for, and  which were embodied to a nicety in 'Sketches by \"Boz,\"' 'The Pickwick  Papers,' and later on in 'The Yellowplush Correspondence,' and 'The  Paris Sketch-Book.'  The new poetry was represented by Tennyson,  Browning, Longfellow, and many more, and essays of better, or, at any  rate, more taking, style than those of the Rev. Vicessimus Knox, were  published every day, and what is more to the point, extensively read and  hoarded.    Collections which had their beginnings in materials such as these  authors afforded were, and necessarily must be, totally different in  every possible way from those of the prior century; this we find to be  the case on looking at the catalogues of sales by auction which were  issued under the new regime.  Fashion had indeed changed, and at this  particular period Hakluyt and Coryat, to say nothing of curious authors  like Brathwaite and Seller, were comparatively neglected.  They have  recovered themselves since, because a revulsion of feeling has taken  place in their favour, and many of the old books which were of immense  importance sixty or seventy years ago are, after suffering a period of  neglect, once more in vogue, and can hardly be met with when sought  after, so great is the demand for them.  That is the case now, but there  is a wide intervening period which needs to be analyzed.    In my opinion, Dickens among novelists, and Tennyson among poets, had  the greatest amount of influence upon modern collectors as a body. The  former was the more powerful at first, since he had the good fortune to  meet with extremely talented artists like George Cruikshank, Hablot  Browne, Seymour and Leech, to illustrate his works.  Cruikshank was  fresh from the glories of 'Life in London,' and 'The Life of Napoleon,'  which had between them carried his name far and wide, and Browne hit off  the meaning of the author in such a marvellous way, that he may almost  be said to have discovered him. Seymour's opportunities were few, as his  seven etchings for the 'Pickwick Papers' were all he ever accomplished  for Dickens; but these were, in their way, masterly, and no doubt  contributed greatly to the success of the earlier parts in which they  appeared.    Slowly but surely the collectors began to turn their thoughts to the new  author and the artists who were assisting him, and to accumulate the  numbers in which it was the fashion to issue illustrated novels at that  time.  We often see them now, almost as clean and fresh as when they  were first published, showing conclusively that every care has been  bestowed upon them. In later days, up to within a year or two in fact,  there was a great rush for any books or parts by popular authors  containing first-rate illustrations. There is a demand for them now, but  only when their condition is immaculate, for fashion has recently  changed in a marked degree, owing, perhaps, to the number of rich  collectors, who would have these things at any price, and, of course,  had their way to the exclusion of the vast majority who were not  sufficiently well off to compete with them.  And this fashion was the  parent, not of another fashion, but of a craze, which raged for two  years or more.    The years 1893 and 1894 I take to be those in which people, despairing  of obtaining their heart's desire, turned their attention to what were  known 'Limited Editions,' and raged furiously.
