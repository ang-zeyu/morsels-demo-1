She had risen from her seat, and stood  again with her hands clasped before him in an attitude of petition;  feeling himself unable to contend longer with his feelings, he made a  hurried excuse for a temporary absence, and left the room. Frances  followed him, and, obedient to the direction of her eye, the soldier  reentered the apartment in which had been their first interview.    \"Major Dunwoodie,\" said Frances, in a voice barely audible, as she  beckoned to him to be seated; her cheek, which had been of a chilling  whiteness, was flushed with a suffusion that crimsoned her whole  countenance. She struggled with herself for a moment, and continued, \"I  have already acknowledged to you my esteem; even now, when you most  painfully distress me, I wish not to conceal it. Believe me, Henry is  innocent of everything but imprudence. Our country can sustain no  wrong.\" Again she paused, and almost gasped for breath; her color  changed rapidly from red to white, until the blood rushed into her face,  covering her features with the brightest vermilion; and she added  hastily, in an undertone, \"I have promised, Dunwoodie, when peace shall  be restored to our country, to become your wife. Give to my brother his  liberty on parole, and I will this day go with you to the altar, follow  you to the camp, and, in becoming a soldier's bride, learn to endure a  soldier's privations.\"    Dunwoodie seized the hand which the blushing girl, in her ardor, had  extended towards him, and pressed it for a moment to his bosom; then  rising from his seat, he paced the room in excessive agitation.    \"Frances, say no more, I conjure you, unless you wish to break my  heart.\"    \"You then reject my offered hand?\" she said, rising with dignity, though  her pale cheek and quivering lip plainly showed the conflicting  passions within.    \"Reject it! Have I not sought it with entreaties--with tears? Has it not  been the goal of all my earthly wishes? But to take it under such  conditions would be to dishonor both. We will hope for better things.  Henry must be acquitted; perhaps not tried. No intercession of mine  shall be wanting, you must well know; and believe me, Frances, I am not  without favor with Washington.\"    \"That very paper, that abuse of his confidence, to which you alluded,  will steel him to my brother's case. If threats or entreaties could move  his stern sense of justice, would Andre have suffered?\" As Frances  uttered these words she fled from the room in despair.    Dunwoodie remained for a minute nearly stupefied; and then he followed  with a view to vindicate himself, and to relieve her apprehensions. On  entering the hall that divided the two parlors, he was met by a small  ragged boy, who looked one moment at his dress, and placing a piece of  paper in his hands, immediately vanished through the outer door of the  building. The bewildered state of his mind, and the suddenness of the  occurrence, gave the major barely time to observe the messenger to be a  country lad, meanly attired, and that he held in his hand one of those  toys which are to be bought in cities, and which he now apparently  contemplated with the conscious pleasure of having fairly purchased, by  the performance of the service required. The soldier turned his eyes to  the subject of the note. It was written on a piece of torn and soiled  paper, and in a hand barely legible, but after some little labor, he was  able to make out as follows--    \"The rig'lars are at hand, horse and foot.\" [Footnote: There died a few  years since, in Bedford, Westchester, a yeoman named Elisha H--- This  person was employed by Washington as one of his most confidential spies.  By the conditions of their bargain, H--- was never to be required to  deal with third parties, since his risks were too imminent. He was  allowed to enter also into the service of Sir Henry Clinton, and so much  confidence had Washington in his love of country and discretion, that he  was often intrusted with the minor military movements, in order that he  might enhance his value with the English general, by communicating them.  In this manner H--- had continued to serve for a long period, when  chance brought him into the city (then held by the British) at a moment  when an expedition was about to quit it, to go against a small post  established at Bedford, his native village, where the Americans had a  depot of provisions. H--- easily ascertained the force and destination  of the detachment ordered on this service, but he was at a loss in what  manner to communicate his information to the officer in command at  Bedford, without betraying his own true character to a third person.  There was not time to reach Washington, and under the circumstances, he  finally resolved to hazard a short note to the American commandant,  stating the danger, and naming the time when the attack might be  expected. To this note he even ventured to affix his own initials, E H,  though he had disguised the hand, under a belief that, as he knew  himself to be suspected by his countrymen, it might serve to give more  weight to his warning. His family being at Bedford, the note was  transmitted with facility and arrived in good season, H--- himself  remaining in New York. The American commandant did what every sensible  officer, in a similar case, would have done. He sent a courier with the  note to Washington, demanding orders, while he prepared his little party  to make the best defense in his power. The headquarters of the American  army were, at that time, in the Highlands. Fortunately, the express met  Washington, on a tour of observation, near their entrance. The note was  given to him, and he read it in the saddle, adding, in pencil, \"Believe  all that E H tells you. George Washington\" He returned it to the  courier, with an injunction to ride for life or death. The courier  reached Bedford after the British had made their attack. The commandant  read the reply, and put it in his pocket. The Americans were defeated,  and their leader killed. The note of H---, with the line written on it  by Washington, was found on his person. The following day H--- was  summoned to the presence of Sir Henry Clinton. After the latter had put  several general questions, he suddenly gave the note to the spy, and  asked if he knew the handwriting, and demanded who the E H was \"It is  Elijah Hadden, the spy you hanged yesterday at Powles Hook.\" The  readiness of this answer, connected with the fact that a spy having the  same initials had been executed the day before, and the coolness of  H----, saved him. Sir Henry Clinton allowed him to quit his presence,  and he never saw him afterwards.]    Dunwoodie started; and, forgetting everything but the duties of a  soldier, he precipitately left the house. While walking rapidly towards  the troops, he noticed on a distant hill a vidette riding with speed.  Several pistols were fired in quick succession; and the next instant the  trumpets of the corps rang in his ears with the enlivening strain of \"To  arms!\" By the time he had reached the ground occupied by his squadron,  the major saw that every man was in active motion. Lawton was already in  the saddle, eying the opposite extremity of the valley with the  eagerness of expectation, and crying to the musicians, in tones but  little lower than their own,--    \"Sound away, my lads, and let these Englishmen know that the Virginia  horse are between them and the end of their journey.\"    The videttes and patrols now came pouring in, each making in succession  his hasty report to the commanding officer, who gave his orders coolly,  and with a promptitude that made obedience certain. Once only, as he  wheeled his horse to ride over the ground in front, did Dunwoodie trust  himself with a look at the cottage, and his heart beat with unusual  rapidity as he saw a female figure standing, with clasped hands, at a  window of the room in which he had met Frances. The distance was too  great to distinguish her features, but the soldier could not doubt that  it was his mistress. The paleness of his cheek and the languor of his  eye endured but for a moment longer. As he rode towards the intended  battle ground, a flush of ardor began to show itself on his sunburnt  features; and his dragoons, who studied the face of their leader, as the  best index to their own fate, saw again the wonted flashing of the eyes,  and the cheerful animation, which they had so often witnessed on the eve  of battle. By the additions of the videttes and parties that had been  out, and which now had all joined, the whole number of the horse was  increased to nearly two hundred. There was also a small body of men,  whose ordinary duties were those of guides, but who, in cases of  emergency, were embodied and did duty as foot soldiers; these were  dismounted, and proceeded, by the order of Dunwoodie, to level the few  fences which might interfere with the intended movements of the cavalry.  The neglect of husbandry, which had been occasioned by the war, left  this task comparatively easy. Those long lines of heavy and durable  walls, which now sweep through every part of the country, forty years  ago were unknown. The slight and tottering fences of stone were then  used more to clear the land for the purposes of cultivation than as  permanent barriers, and required the constant attention of the  husbandman, to preserve them against the fury of the tempests and the  frosts of winter. Some few of them had been built with more care  immediately around the dwelling of Mr. Wharton; but those which had  intersected the vale below were now generally a pile of ruins, over  which the horses of the Virginians would bound with the fleetness of the  wind. Occasionally a short line yet preserved its erect appearance; but  as none of those crossed the ground on which Dunwoodie intended to act,  there "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],[0,"The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#17)"],[1,"Jewish maxim for the tourist. How  necessary this rule was, may be seen from what happened to Rabbi Petachiah,  who travelled from Prague to Nineveh, in 1175, or thereabouts. At Nineveh  he fell sick, and the king's physicians attended him and pronounced his  death certain. Now Petachiah had travelled in most costly attire, and in  Persia the rule was that if a Jewish traveller died, the physicians took  half his property. Petachiah saw through the real danger that threatened  him, so he escaped from the perilous ministrations of the royal doctors,  had himself carried across the Tigris on a raft, and soon recovered.  Clearly, it was imprudent of a Jewish traveller to excite the rapacity of  kings or bandits by wearing rich dresses. But it was also desirable for the  Jew, if he could, to evade recognition as such altogether. Jewish opinion  was very sensible on this head. It did not forbid a Jew's disguising  himself even as a priest of the Church, joining a caravan, and mumbling  Latin hymns. In times of danger, he might, to save his life, don the turban  and pass as a Mohammedan even in his home. Most remarkable concession of  all, the Jewess on a journey might wear the dress of a man. The law of the  land was equally open to reason. In Spain, the Jew was allowed to discard  his yellow badge while travelling; in Germany, he had the same privilege,  but he had to pay a premium for it. In some parts, the Jewish community as  a whole bought the right to travel and to discard the badge on journeys,  paying a lump sum for the general privilege, and itself exacting a communal  tax to defray the general cost. In Rome, the traveller was allowed to lodge  for ten days before resuming his hated badge. But, curiously enough, the  legal relaxation concerning the badge was not extended to the markets. The  Jew made the medieval markets, yet he was treated as an unwelcome guest, a  commodity to be taxed. This was especially so in Germany. In 1226, Bishop  Lorenz, of Breslau, ordered Jews who passed through his domain to pay the  same toll as slaves brought to market. The visiting Jew paid toll for  everything; but he got part of his money back. He received a yellow badge,  which he was forced to wear during his whole stay at the market, the  finances of which he enriched, indirectly by his trade, and directly by his  huge contributions to the local taxes.    The Jewish traveller mostly left his wife at home. In certain circumstances  he could force her to go with him, as, for instance, if he had resolved to  settle in Palestine. On the other hand, the wife could prevent her husband  from leaving her during the first year after marriage. It also happened  that families emigrated together. Mostly, however, the Jewess remained at  home, and only rarely did she join even the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This  is a striking contrast to the Christian custom, for it was the Christian  woman that was the most ardent pilgrim; in fact, pilgrimages to the Holy  Land only became popular in Church circles because of the enthusiasm of  Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, especially when, in 326, she found  the true cross. We, however, read of an aged Jewess who made a pilgrimage  to all the cities of Europe, for the purpose of praying in the synagogues  on her route.    We now know, from the Chronicle of Achimaaz, that Jews visited Jerusalem in  the tenth century. Aronius records a curious incident. Charles the Great,  between the years 787 and 813, ordered a Jewish merchant, who often used to  visit Palestine and bring precious and unknown commodities thence to the  West, to hoax the Archbishop of Mainz, so as to lower the self-conceit of  this vain dilettante. The Jew thereupon sold him a mouse at a high price,  persuading him that it was a rare animal, which he had brought with him  from Judea. Early in the eleventh century there was a fully organized  Jewish community with a Beth-Din at Ramleh, some four hours' drive from  Jaffa. But Jews did not visit Palestine in large numbers, until Saladin  finally regained the Holy City for Mohammedan rule, towards the end of the  twelfth century. From that time pilgrimages of Jews became more frequent;  but the real influx of Jews into Palestine dates from 1492, when many of  the Spanish exiles settled there, and formed the nucleus of the present  Sefardic population.    On the whole, it may be said that in the Middle Ages the journey to  Palestine was fraught with so much danger that it was gallantry that  induced men to go mostly without their wives. And, generally speaking, the  Jew going abroad to earn a living for his family, could not dream of  allowing his wife to share the dangers and fatigues of the way. In Ellul,  1146, Rabbi Simeon the Pious returned from England, where he had lived many  years, and betook himself to Cologne, thence to take ship home to Trier. On  the way, near Cologne, he was slain by Crusaders, because he refused  baptism. The Jewish community of Cologne bought the body from the citizens,  and buried it in the Jewish cemetery.    No doubt it was often a cruel necessity that separated husband and wife.  The Jewish law, even in lands where monogamy was not legally enforced, did  not allow the Jew, however, to console himself with one wife at home and  another abroad. Josephus, we know, had one wife in Tiberias and another in  Alexandria, and the same thing is told us of royal officers in the Roman  period; but the Talmudic legislation absolutely forbids such license, even  though it did not formally prohibit a man from having more than one wife at  home. We hear occasionally of the wife's growing restive in her husband's  absence and taking another husband. In 1272, Isaac of Erfurt went on a  trading journey, and though he was only gone from March 9, 1271, to July,  1272, he found, on his return, that his wife had wearied of waiting for  him. Such incidents on the side of the wife were very rare; the number of  cases in which wife-desertion occurred was larger. In her husband's  absence, the wife's lot, at best, was not happy. \"Come back,\" wrote one  wife, \"or send me a divorce.\" \"Nay,\" replied the husband, \"I can do  neither. I have not yet made enough provision for us, so I cannot return.  And, before Heaven, I love you, so I cannot divorce you.\" The Rabbi advised  that he should give her a conditional divorce, a kindly device, which  provided that, in case the husband remained away beyond a fixed date, the  wife was free to make other matrimonial arrangements. The Rabbis held that  travelling diminishes family life, property, and reputation. Move from  house to house, and you lose a shirt; go from place to place, and you lose  a life--so ran the Rabbinic proverb. This subject might be enlarged upon,  but enough has been said to show that this breaking up of the family life  was one of the worst effects of the Jewish travels of the Middle Ages, and  even more recent times.    Whether his journey was devotional or commercial, the rites of religion  formed part of the traveller's preparations for the start. The Prayer for  Wayfarers is Talmudic in origin. It may be found in many prayer books, and  I need not quote it. But one part of it puts so well, in a few pregnant  words, the whole story of danger, that I must reproduce them. On  approaching a town, the Jew prayed, \"May it be Thy will, O Lord, to bring  me safely to this town.\" When he had entered, he prayed, \"May it be Thy  will, O Lord, to take me safely from this town.\" And when he actually left,  he uttered similar words, pathetic and painfully significant.    In the first century of the Christian era, much travelling was entailed by  the conveyance of the didrachmon, sent by each Jew to the Temple from  almost every part of the known world. Philo says of the Jews beyond the  Euphrates: \"Every year the sacred messengers are sent to convey large sums  of gold and silver to the Temple, which have been collected from all the  subordinate Governments. They travel over rugged and difficult and almost  impassable roads, which, however, they look upon as level and easy,  inasmuch as they serve to conduct them to piety.\" And the road was made  easy in other ways.    It must often have been shortened to the imagination by the prevalent  belief that by supernatural aid the miles could be actually lessened. Rabbi  Natronai was reported to be able to convey himself a several days' journey  in a single instant. So Benjamin of Tudela tells how Alroy, who claimed to  be the Messiah in the twelfth century, not only could make himself visible  or invisible at will, but could cross rivers on his turban, and, by the aid  of the Divine Name, could travel a ten days' journey in ten hours. Another  Jewish traveller calmed the sea by naming God, another by writing the  sacred Name on a shard, and casting it into the sea. \"Have no care,\" said  he, on another occasion, to his Arab comrade, as the shadows fell on a  Friday afternoon, and they were still far from home, \"have no care, we  shall arrive before nightfall,\" and, exercising his wonderworking powers,  he was as good as his word. We read in Achimaaz of the exploits of a  tenth-century Jew who traversed Italy, working wonders, being received  everywhere with popular acclamations. This was Aaron of Bagdad, son of a  miller, who, finding that a lion had eaten the mill-mule, caught the lion  and made him do the grinding. His father sent him on his travels as a  penalty for his dealings with magic: after three years he might return. Fie  went on board a ship, and assured the sailors that they need fear neither  foe nor storm, for he could use the Name. He landed at Gaeta in Italy,  where he restored to human form the son of his host, whom a witch had  turned into an ass. This was the beginning of many miracles. But he did not  allow one place to monopolize him. Next we find him in Benvenuto. He goes  to the synagogue, recognizes that a lad omits the name of God from his"]]]
