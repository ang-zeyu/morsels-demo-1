CHAPTER X    [7] _Mr Burke's graduated scale of the sublime_: There must be some  mistake in this, for the whole honourable band of gentlemen-pensioners  has resolved unanimously, that Mr Burke was a very sublime person,  particularly after he had prostituted his own soul, and betrayed his  country and mankind, for 1200_l_. a year: yet he does not appear to  have been a very terrible personage, and certainly went off with a  very small portion of human respect, though he contrived to excite,  in a great degree, the astonishment of all honest men. Our immaculate  laureate (who gives us to understand that, if he had not been purified  by holy matrimony into a mystical type, he would have died a virgin,)  is another sublime gentleman of the same genus: he very much  astonished some persons when he sold his birthright for a pot of sack;  but not even his _Sosia_ has a grain of respect for him, though,  doubtless, he thinks his name very terrible to the enemy, when he  flourishes his criticopoeticopolitical tomahawk, and sets up his  Indian yell for the blood of his old friends: but, at best, he is a  mere political scarecrow, a man of straw, ridiculous to all who know  of what materials he is made; and to none more so, than to those who  have stuffed him, and set him up, as the Priapus of the garden of the  golden apples of corruption.

Good-by again.\" And so he was gone.        CHAPTER 17      Down the Bear Creek road Terence Hollis rode as he had never ridden  before. To be sure, it was not the first time that El Sangre had  stretched to the full his mighty strength, but on those other occasions  he had fought the burst of speed, straining back in groaning stirrup  leathers, with his full weight wresting at the bit. Now he let the rein  play to such a point that he was barely keeping the power of the stallion  in touch. He lightened his weight as only a fine horseman can do,  shifting a few vital inches forward, and with the burden falling more  over his withers, El Sangre fled like a racer down the valley. Not that  he was fully extended. His head was not stretched out as a cow-pony's  head is stretched when he runs; he held it rather high, as though he  carried in his big heart a reserve strength ready to be called on for any  emergency. For all that, it was running such as Terry had never known.    The wind became a blast, jerking the brim of his sombrero up and  whistling in his hair. He was letting the shame, the grief, the thousand  regrets of that parting with Aunt Elizabeth be blown out of his soul. His  mind was a whirl; the thoughts became blurs. As a matter of fact, Terry  was being reborn.    He had lived a life perfectly sheltered. The care of Elizabeth Cornish  had surrounded him as the Blue Mountains and Sleep Mountain surrounded  Bear Valley and fenced off the full power of the storm winds. The reality  of life had never reached him. Now, all in a day, the burden was placed  on his back, and he felt the spur driven home to the quick. No wonder  that he winced, that his heart contracted.    But now that he was awakening, everything was new. Uncle Vance, whom he  had always secretly despised, now seemed a fine character, gentle,  cultured, thoughtful of others. Aunt Elizabeth Cornish he had accepted as  a sort of natural fact, as though there were a blood tie between them.  Now he was suddenly aware of twenty-four years of patient love. The  sorrow of it, that only the loss of that love should have brought him  realization of it. Vague thoughts and aspirations formed in his mind. He  yearned toward some large and heroic deed which should re-establish  himself in her respect. He wished to find her in need, in great trouble,  free her from some crushing burden with one perilous effort, lay his  homage at her feet.    All of which meant that Terry Hollis was a boy--a bewildered, heart-  stricken boy. Not that he would have undone what he had done. It seemed  to him inevitable that he should resent the story of the sheriff and  shoot him down or be shot down himself. All that he regretted was that he  had remained mute before Aunt Elizabeth, unable to explain to her a thing  which he felt so keenly. And for the first time he realized the flinty  basis of her nature. The same thing that enabled her to give half a  lifetime to the cherishing of a theory, also enabled her to cast all the  result of that labor out of her life. It stung him again to the quick  every time he thought of it. There was something wrong. He felt that a  hundred hands of affection gave him hold on her. And yet all those grips  were brushed away.    The torment was setting him on fire. And the fire was burning away the  smug complacency which had come to him during his long life in the  valley.    When El Sangre pulled out of his racing gallop and struck out up a slope  at his natural gait, the ground-devouring pace, Terry Hollis was panting  and twisting in the saddle as though the labor of the gallop had been  his. They climbed and climbed, and still his mind was involved in a haze  of thought. It cleared when he found that there were no longer high  mountains before him. He drew El Sangre to a halt with a word. The great  stallion turned his head as he paused and looked back to his master with  a confiding eye as though waiting willingly for directions. And all at  once the heart of Terence went out to the blood-bay as it had never gone  before to any creature, dumb or human. For El Sangre had known such pain  as he himself was learning at this moment. El Sangre was giving him true  trust, true love, and asking him for no return.    The stallion, following his own will, had branched off from the Bear  Creek trail and climbed through the lower range of the Blue Peaks. They  were standing now on a mountain-top. The red of the sunset filled the  west and brought the sky close to them with the lower drifts of stained  clouds. Eastward the winding length of Bear Creek was turning pink and  purple. The Cornish ranch had never seemed so beautiful to Terry as it  was at this moment. It was a kingdom, and he was leaving, the  disinherited heir.    He turned west to the blare of the sunset. Blue Mountains tumbled away in  lessening ranges--beyond was Craterville, and he must go there today.  That was the world to him just then. And something new passed through  Terry. The world was below him; it lay at his feet with its hopes and its  battles. And he was strong for the test. He had been living in a dream.  Now he would live in fact. And it was glorious to live!    And when his arms fell, his right hand lodged instinctively on the butt  of his revolver. It was a prophetic gesture, but there, again, was  something that Terry Hollis did not understand.    He called to El Sangre softly. The stallion responded with the faintest  of whinnies to the vibrant power in the voice of the master; and at that  smooth, effortless pace, he glided down the hillside, weaving dexterously  among the jagged outcroppings of rock. A period had been placed after  Terry's old life. And this was how he rode into the new.    The long and ever-changing mountain twilight began as he wound through  the lower ranges. And when the full dark came, he broke from the last  sweep of foothills and El Sangre roused to a gallop over the level toward  Craterville.    He had been in the town before, of course. But he felt this evening that  he had really never seen it before. On other days what existed outside of  Bear Valley did not very much matter. That was the hub around which the  rest of the world revolved, so far as Terry was concerned. It was very  different now. Craterville, in fact, was a huddle of broken-down houses  among a great scattering of boulders with the big mountains plunging up  on every side to the dull blue of the night sky.    But Craterville was also something more. It was a place where several  hundred human beings lived, any one of whom might be the decisive  influence in the life of Terry. Young men and old men were in that town,  cunning and strength; old crones and lovely girls were there. Whom would  he meet? What should he see? A sudden kindness toward others poured  through Terry Hollis. After all, every man might be a treasure to him. A  queer choking came in his throat when he thought of all that he had  missed by his contemptuous aloofness.    One thing gave him check. This was primarily the sheriff's town, and by  this time they knew all about the shooting. But what of that? He had  fought fairly, almost too fairly.    He passed the first shapeless shack. The hoofs of El Sangre bit into the  dust, choking and red in daylight, and acrid of scent by the night. All  was very quiet except for a stir of voices in the distance here and  there, always kept hushed as though the speaker felt and acknowledged the  influence of the profound night in the mountains. Someone came down the  street carrying a lantern. It turned his steps into vast spokes of  shadows that rushed back and forth across the houses with the swing of  the light. The lantern light gleamed on the stained flank of El Sangre.    \"Halloo, Jake, that you?\"    The man with the lantern raised it, but its light merely served to blind  him. Terry passed on without a word and heard the other mutter behind  him: \"Some damn stranger!\"    Perhaps strangers were not welcome in Craterville. At least, it seemed so  when he reached the hotel after putting up his horse in the shed behind  the old building. Half a dozen dark forms sat on the veranda talking in  the subdued voices which he had noted before. Terry stepped through the  lighted doorway. There was no one inside.    \"Want something?\" called a voice from the porch. The widow Rickson came  in to him.    \"A room, please,\" said Terry.    But she was gaping at him. \"You! Terence--Hollis!\"    A thousand things seemed to be in that last word, which she brought out  with a shrill ring of her voice. Terry noted that the talking on the  porch was cut off as though a hand had been clapped over the mouth of  every man.    He recalled that the widow had been long a friend of the sheriff and he  was suddenly embarrassed.    \"If you have a spare room, Mrs. Rickson. Otherwise, I'll find--\"    Her manner had changed. It became as strangely ingratiating as it had  been horrified, suspicious, before.    \"Sure I got a room. Best in the house, if you want it. And--you'll be  hungry, Mr.--Hollis?\"    He wondered why she insisted so savagely on that newfound name? He  admitted that he was very hungry from his ride, and she led him back to  the kitchen and gave him cold ham and coffee and vast slices of bread and  butter.    She did not talk much while he ate, and he noted that she asked no  questions. Afterwards she led him through the silence of the place up to  the second story and gave him a room at the corner of the building. He  thanked her. She paused at the door with her hand on the knob, and her  eyes fixed him through and through with a glittering, hostile stare. A  wisp of gray hair had fallen across her cheek, and there it was plastered  to the skin with sweat, for the evening was, warm.    \"No trouble,\" she muttered at length. \"None at all. Make yourself to  home, Mr.--Hollis!\"        CHAPTER 18      When the door"]]]
