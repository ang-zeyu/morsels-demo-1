I will not refuse so kind an offer, for I doubt  greatly whether I could keep awake to-night.\"    \"Now let us say no more about it, for we may be quite sure that the man  is still on your track, and there may be other Neapolitan agents on  board. We cannot be too careful. It may be that old man who was sitting  facing us at the table, it may be that little fellow who looks like the  agent of a commercial house, and it may be one of the two men who say  they come from South America; there is no telling. But at any rate, let  us drop the subject altogether. We have said nothing at present that  even a spy could lay hold of, beyond the fact that you are going to the  Villa Spinola, which means to Garibaldi.\"    They did not go up on deck again after dinner, but sat chatting in the  saloon until nine o'clock, when Frank said that he could keep his eyes  open no longer. After allowing him time to get into his berth, Rubini  came in, took off his coat and waistcoat, pulled the mattress and  bedding from the other bunk, and lay down on it with his head close to  the door.    \"Will you take one of my pistols, Rubini?\" for by this time they called  each other simply by their surnames.    \"No, thank you; if the scoundrel tries to open the door and finds that  he cannot do so, you may be sure that he will move off at once. He has  been taught that you are handy with your weapons.\"    Frank was sleeping soundly when he was woke by Rubini's sharp challenge,  \"Who goes there?\" It was pitch dark, and he was about to leap from his  bunk, when Rubini said,--    \"It is no use getting up. By the time I got this bed away and opened the  door, the fellow would be at the other end of the boat. We may as well  lie quiet. He is not likely to try again; and, indeed, I should not  care about going outside the door, for it is pitch dark, and he might  at the present moment be crouching outside in readiness to stab you as  you came out. However, he is more likely to be gone now, for directly he  heard us talking he would know that his game was up.\" He struck a match.  \"It is just two o'clock,\" he said; \"we may as well have four hours' more  sleep.\"    In a few minutes Frank was sound asleep again, and when he awoke it was  daylight. Looking at the watch, he found that it was seven o'clock.  \"Seven o'clock, Rubini!\" he said.    The Italian sat up and stretched his arms and yawned. \"I have had a  capital night. However, it is time to get up; we must turn out at once.  We can't be far from Genoa now; we are due there at eight o'clock, so we  shall just have comfortable time for a wash and a cup of coffee before  going ashore.\"    Frank dressed hastily, and then ran up on deck, where he stood admiring  the splendid coast, and the town of Genoa climbing up the hill, with its  churches, campaniles, and its suburbs embedded in foliage. They were  just entering the port when Maffio came up to him.    \"Coffee is ready,\" he said. \"You had better come down and take it while  it is hot. We shall have the custom-house officers off before we land,  so there is no hurry.\"    After making a meal on coffee with an abundance of milk, rolls and  butter, Frank went up again. He then, at the advice of Rubini, drew the  charges of his pistols and placed them in his portmanteau.    \"We must go ashore in a boat,\" Sarto said. \"I have just heard the  captain say that the wharves are so full that he may not be able to take  the vessel alongside for a couple of hours.\"    \"Are you going anywhere in particular when you land?\" Frank asked.    \"We all belong to Genoa, and have friends here. Why do you ask?\"    \"Could you spare me an hour of your time to-day? I should not ask you,  but it is rather important.\"    \"Certainly; we are all at your service,\" Rubini said in some surprise.  \"At what hour shall we meet you, and where?\"    \"I am going to the Hotel Europa. Any time will suit me, so that it is a  couple of hours before dusk. I will tell you what it is when you meet  me; it is better not to speak of it here.\"    The young men consulted together. \"We will go to our friends,\" Rubini  said, \"take our things there and spend an hour, and will call upon you,  if convenient, at eleven o'clock.\"    \"Thank you; and you will see, when I have explained my reason for  troubling you, that I have not done so wantonly.\"    They landed at the step of the customs. \"Have you anything to declare?\"  the official asked Frank, after his passport had been examined and  stamped.    \"I have nothing but this small portmanteau, which contains only clothes  and a brace of pistols. I suppose one can land with them on payment of  duty.\"    \"Certainly, monsieur; but why should an Englishman want them?\"    \"I intend to make a walking tour through Italy\"--speaking as before in  English; \"and there are parts of the country where, after dark, I should  feel more comfortable for having them in my pockets.\"    \"You are strange people, you Englishmen,\" the officer said; \"but, after  all, you are not far wrong, though it seems to me that it would be wiser  to give up what you carry about you than to make a show of resistance  which would end in getting your throat cut.\" He glanced at the pistols,  named the amount of duty chargeable; and when this was paid, Frank  nodded to his companions, who were being much more rigorously examined,  took one of the vehicles standing outside the custom-house, and drove to  the Hotel Europa.          CHAPTER VI.    THE VILLA SPINOLA      After taking a room and seeing his portmanteau carried up there, Frank  went out for an hour and looked at the shops in the principal street;  then he returned to the hotel, and stood at the entrance until his three  friends arrived. He had again loaded his pistols and placed them in his  pocket, and had engaged an open vehicle that was now standing at the  door.    \"Let us start at once,\" he said; \"gentlemen, if you will take your  places with me, I will explain the matter to you as we drive along.\"    They took their seats.    \"Drive to the Strada de Livourno,\" he said to the coachman; \"I will tell  you the house when we get there. Now, my friends,\" he went on, as the  carriage started, \"I will explain what may seem singular to you. My  mother has sent out a letter which contained, I may say, a considerable  sum to be used by the general for the purposes of this expedition. It  had been intended that I should bring it; but when we discovered that  there was a spy in the house, and that our cabinets had been ransacked  and our conversation overheard, it was thought almost certain that an  attempt would be made to rob me of the letter on the way. Finally, after  much discussion, it was agreed to send the letter by post to the care of  the Countess of Mongolfiere, who is an old friend of Signora Forli, my  grandmother; she was convinced that I should be watched from the moment  I landed, and advised me not to go to see the countess until I could  take three of Garibaldi's followers with me, and that after accompanying  me to her house, they should drive with me to the Villa Spinola. Now you  will understand why I have asked you to give up a portion of your first  day to come to aid me.\"    \"I think your friends were very right in giving you the advice,  Percival. After the two attempts that have been made--I will not say to  kill you--but to search you and your luggage, it is certain that  Francisco's agents must have obtained information that you were carrying  money, and perhaps documents of importance, and that they would not take  their eyes off you until either they had gained their object or  discovered that you had handed the parcel over to the general. I have no  doubt that they are following you now in some vehicle or other.\"    On arrival at the villa of the Countess of Mongolfiere, Frank sent in  his card, and on this being taken in, was at once invited to enter. The  countess was a lady of about the same age as Signora Forli.    \"I am glad to see you, Signor Percival,\" she said. \"I have received the  letter from Madame Forli with its enclosure.\"    \"I have brought you another note from her, madame la contessa,\" he said,  presenting it, \"as a proof of my identity; for the matter is of  importance, as you may well suppose, from the manner in which this  letter was sent to you, instead of by the post direct to me.\"    \"So I supposed, signor. Signora Forli said that it concerned the good of  the cause; and the manner in which she begged me to lock it up at once  on my receiving it, was sufficient to show that it either contained  money for the cause or secrets that the agents of the foes of freedom  would be glad to discover. The mere fact that she gave no particulars  convinced me that she considered it best that I should be in the dark,  so that, should the letter fall into other hands, I could say truly that  I had not expected its arrival, and knew nothing whatever of the matter  to which it related.\"    \"It contains drafts for a considerable sum of money, signora, for the  use of Garibaldi. The general, being ignorant of my father's death, had  written to him, asking him to join him, and recalling his promise to  assist with money. My father, unfortunately, could no longer give  personal service, but as he had for years put by a certain portion of  his income for this purpose, my mother had it in her power to send this  money. It was intended that I should bring it; but we found that all our  doings were watched, and that, therefore, there was considerable danger  of my being followed and robbed upon the way; and Signora Forli then  suggested that she should send it direct to you, as possibly a letter  addressed to me here might fall into the hands of the Neapolitan  agents.\"    \"It was a very good plan,\" the countess said. \"And have you been  molested on the way?\"    \"Attempts have been made on two occasions--once in the train on my way  to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558"],[0,"Barry Lyndon (#17)"],[1,"frightened by it. He offered five guineas to be carried into the town,  which was hard by; and I and another man, taking him up in a cloak,  managed to transport him into a place of decent appearance, where we put  him to bed, and where a young surgeon (who desired nothing better than  to take himself out of the fire of the musketry) went presently to dress  his wound.    In order to get into the house, we had been obliged, it must be  confessed, to fire into the locks with our pieces; which summons brought  an inhabitant of the house to the door, a very pretty and black-eyed  young woman, who lived there with her old half-blind father, a retired  Jagdmeister of the Duke of Cassel, hard by. When the French were in the  town, Meinherr's house had suffered like those of his neighbours; and  he was at first exceedingly unwilling to accommodate his guests. But the  first knocking at the door had the effect of bringing a speedy answer;  and Mr. Fakenham, taking a couple of guineas out of a very full purse,  speedily convinced the people that they had only to deal with a person  of honour.    Leaving the doctor (who was very glad to stop) with his patient, who  paid me the stipulated reward, I was returning to my regiment with my  other comrade--after having paid, in my German jargon, some deserved  compliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, and thinking, with no  small envy, how comfortable it would be to be billeted there--when the  private who was with me cut short my reveries by suggesting that we  should divide the five guineas the lieutenant had given me.    'There is your share,' said I, giving the fellow one piece; which was  plenty, as I was the leader of the expedition. But he swore a dreadful  oath that he would have half; and when I told him to go to a quarter  which I shall not name, the fellow, lifting his musket, hit me a blow  with the butt-end of it, which sent me lifeless to the ground: when I  awoke from my trance, I found myself bleeding with a large wound in the  head, and had barely time to stagger back to the house where I had left  the lieutenant, when I again fell fainting at the door.    Here I must have been discovered by the surgeon on his issuing out; for  when I awoke a second time I found myself in the ground-floor of the  house, supported by the black-eyed girl, while the surgeon was copiously  bleeding me at the arm. There was another bed in the room where the  lieutenant had been laid,--it was that occupied by Gretel, the servant;  while Lischen, as my fair one was called, had, till now, slept in the  couch where the wounded officer lay.    'Who are you putting into that bed?' said he languidly, in German; for  the ball had been extracted from his side with much pain and loss of  blood.    They told him it was the corporal who had brought him.    'A corporal?' said he, in English; 'turn him out.' And you may be sure  I felt highly complimented by the words. But we were both too faint to  compliment or to abuse each other much, and I was put to bed carefully;  and, on being undressed, had an opportunity to find that my pockets  had been rifled by the English soldier after he had knocked me down.  However, I was in good quarters: the young lady who sheltered me  presently brought me a refreshing drink; and, as I took it, I could not  help pressing the kind hand that gave it me; nor, in truth, did this  token of my gratitude seem unwelcome.    This intimacy did not decrease with further acquaintance. I found  Lischen the tenderest of nurses. Whenever any delicacy was to be  provided for the wounded lieutenant, a share was always sent to the  bed opposite his, and to the avaricious man's no small annoyance. His  illness was long. On the second day the fever declared itself; for some  nights he was delirious; and I remember it was when a commanding  officer was inspecting our quarters, with an intention, very likely, of  billeting himself on the house, that the howling and mad words of the  patient overhead struck him, and he retired rather frightened. I had  been sitting up very comfortably in the lower apartment, for my hurt was  quite subsided; and it was only when the officer asked me, with a  rough voice, why I was not at my regiment, that I began to reflect how  pleasant my quarters were to me, and that I was much better here than  crawling under an odious tent with a parcel of tipsy soldiers, or going  the night-rounds or rising long before daybreak for drill.    The delirium of Mr. Fakenham gave me a hint, and I determined forthwith  to GO MAD. There was a poor fellow about Brady's Town called 'Wandering  Billy,' whose insane pranks I had often mimicked as a lad, and I  again put them in practice. That night I made an attempt upon Lischen,  saluting her with a yell and a grin which frightened her almost out of  her wits; and when anybody came I was raving. The blow on the head had  disordered my brain; the doctor was ready to vouch for this fact. One  night I whispered to him that I was Julius Caesar, and considered him  to be my affianced wife Queen Cleopatra, which convinced him of my  insanity. Indeed, if Her Majesty had been like my Aesculapius, she must  have had a carroty beard, such as is rare in Egypt.    A movement on the part of the French speedily caused an advance on our  part. The town was evacuated, except by a few Prussian troops, whose  surgeons were to visit the wounded in the place; and, when we were well,  we were to be drafted to our regiments. I determined that I never would  join mine again. My intention was to make for Holland, almost the only  neutral country of Europe in those times, and thence to get a passage  somehow to England, and home to dear old Brady's Town.    If Mr. Fakenham is now alive, I here tender him my apologies for my  conduct to him. He was very rich; he used me very ill. I managed to  frighten away his servant who came to attend him after the affair of  Warburg, and from that time would sometimes condescend to wait upon the  patient, who always treated me with scorn; but it was my object to  have him alone, and I bore his brutality with the utmost civility and  mildness, meditating in my own mind a very pretty return for all his  favours to me. Nor was I the only person in the house to whom the worthy  gentleman was uncivil. He ordered the fair Lischen hither and thither,  made impertinent love to her, abused her soups, quarrelled with her  omelettes, and grudged the money which was laid out for his maintenance;  so that our hostess detested him as much as, I think, without vanity,  she regarded me.    For, if the truth must be told, I had made very deep love to her during  my stay under her roof; as is always my way with women, of whatever  age or degree of beauty. To a man who has to make his way in the world,  these dear girls can always be useful in one fashion or another; never  mind, if they repel your passion; at any rate, they are not offended  with your declaration of it, and only look upon you with more favourable  eyes in consequence of your misfortune. As for Lischen, I told her such  a pathetic story of my life (a tale a great deal more romantic than that  here narrated,--for I did not restrict myself to the exact truth in that  history, as in these pages I am bound to do), that I won the poor girl's  heart entirely, and, besides, made considerable progress in the  German language under her instruction. Do not think me very cruel and  heartless, ladies; this heart of Lischen's was like many a town in the  neighbourhood in which she dwelt, and had been stormed and occupied  several times before I came to invest it; now mounting French colours,  now green and yellow Saxon, now black and white Prussian, as the case  may be. A lady who sets her heart upon a lad in uniform must prepare to  change lovers pretty quickly, or her life will be but a sad one.    The German surgeon who attended us after the departure of the English  only condescended to pay our house a visit twice during my residence;  and I took care, for a reason I had, to receive him in a darkened room,  much to the annoyance of Mr. Fakenham, who lay there: but I said the  light affected my eyes dreadfully since my blow on the head; and so I  covered up my head with clothes when the doctor came, and told him that  I was an Egyptian mummy, or talked to him some insane nonsense, in order  to keep up my character.    'What is that nonsense you were talking about an Egyptian mummy,  fellow?' asked Mr. Fakenham peevishly.    'Oh! you'll know soon, sir,' said I.    The next time that I expected the doctor to come, instead of receiving  him in a darkened room, with handkerchiefs muffled, I took care to be  in the lower room, and was having a game at cards with Lischen as the  surgeon entered. I had taken possession of a dressing-jacket of the  lieutenant's, and some other articles of his wardrobe, which fitted me  pretty well; and, I flatter myself, was no ungentlemanlike figure.    'Good-morrow, Corporal,' said the doctor, rather gruffly, in reply to my  smiling salute.    'Corporal! Lieutenant, if you please,' answered I, giving an arch look  at Lischen, whom I had instructed in my plot.    'How lieutenant?' asked the surgeon. 'I thought the lieutenant was'--    'Upon my word, you do me great honour,' cried I, laughing; 'you mistook  me for the mad corporal upstairs. The fellow has once or twice pretended  to be an officer, but my kind hostess here can answer which is which.'    'Yesterday he fancied he was Prince Ferdinand,' said Lischen; 'the day  you came he said he was an Egyptian mummy.'    'So he did,' said the doctor; 'I remember; but, ha! ha! do you know,  Lieutenant, I have in my notes made a mistake in you two?'    'Don't talk to me about his malady; he is calm now.'    Lischen and I laughed at this error as at the most ridiculous thing  in the world; and when the surgeon went up to examine his patient, I  cautioned him not to talk to him about "]]]
