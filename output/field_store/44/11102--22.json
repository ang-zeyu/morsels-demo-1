Oh, it was uncanny.\" She shuddered. \"The first time I heard it I  had been lying awake listening. I was nervous. Madame de Staemer had  told me that morning that the Colonel had seen someone lurking about  the lawns on the previous night. Then, as I lay awake listening for  the slightest sound, I suddenly detected these footsteps; and they  paused--right outside my door.\"    \"Good heavens!\" I exclaimed. \"What did you do?\"    \"Frankly, I was too frightened to do anything. I just lay still with my  heart beating horribly, and presently they passed on, and I heard them  no more.\"    \"Was your door locked?\"    \"No.\" She laughed nervously. \"But it has been locked every night since  then!\"    \"And these sounds were repeated on other nights?\"    \"Yes, I have often heard them, Mr. Knox. What makes it so strange is  that all the servants sleep out in the west wing, as you know, and Pedro  locks the communicating door every night before retiring.\"    \"It is certainly strange,\" I muttered.    \"It is horrible,\" declared the girl, almost in a whisper. \"For what can  it mean except that there is someone in Cray's Folly who is never seen  during the daytime?\"    \"But that is incredible.\"    \"It is not so incredible in a big house like this. Besides, what other  explanation can there be?\"    \"There must be one,\" I said, reassuringly. \"Have you spoken of this to  Madame de Staemer?\"    \"Yes.\"    Val Beverley's expression grew troubled.    \"Had she any explanation to offer?\"    \"None. Her attitude mystified me very much. Indeed, instead of  reassuring me, she frightened me more than ever by her very silence.  I grew to dread the coming of each night. Then--\" she hesitated again,  looking at me pathetically--\"twice I have been awakened by a loud cry.\"    \"What kind of cry?\"    \"I could not tell you, Mr. Knox. You see I have always been asleep when  it has come, but I have sat up trembling and dimly aware that what had  awakened me was a cry of some kind.\"    \"You have no idea from whence it proceeded?\"    \"None whatever. Of course, all these things may seem trivial to you, and  possibly they can be explained in quite a simple way. But this feeling  of something pending has grown almost unendurable. Then, I don't  understand Madame and the Colonel at all.\"    She suddenly stopped speaking and flushed with embarrassment.    \"If you mean that Madame de Staemer is in love with her cousin, I agree  with you,\" I said, quietly.    \"Oh, is it so evident as that?\" murmured Val Beverley. She laughed to  cover her confusion. \"I wish I could understand what it all means.\"    At this point our tete-a-tete was interrupted by the return of Madame de  Staemer.    \"Oh, la la!\" she cried, \"the Colonel must have allowed himself to become  too animated this evening. He is threatened with one of his attacks and  I have insisted upon his immediate retirement. He makes his apologies,  but knows you will understand.\"    I expressed my concern, and:    \"I was unaware that Colonel Menendez's health was impaired,\" I said.    \"Ah,\" Madame shrugged characteristically. \"Juan has travelled too much  of the road of life on top speed, Mr. Knox.\" She snapped her white  fingers and grimaced significantly. \"Excitement is bad for him.\"    She wheeled her chair up beside Val Beverley, and taking the girl's hand  patted it affectionately.    \"You look pale to-night, my dear,\" she said. \"All this bogey business is  getting on your nerves, eh?\"    \"Oh, not at all,\" declared the girl. \"It is very mysterious and  annoying, of course.\"    \"But M. Paul Harley will presently tell us what it is all about,\"  concluded Madame. \"Yes, I trust so. We want no Cuban devils here at  Cray's Folly.\"    I had hoped that she would speak further of the matter, but having thus  apologized for our host's absence, she plunged into an amusing account  of Parisian society, and of the changes which five years of war had  brought about. Her comments, although brilliant, were superficial, the  only point I recollect being her reference to a certain Baron Bergmann,  a Swedish diplomat, who, according to Madame, had the longest nose and  the shortest memory in Paris, so that in the cold weather, \"he even  sometimes forgot to blow his nose.\"    Her brightness I thought was almost feverish. She chattered and laughed  and gesticulated, but on this occasion she was overacting. Underneath  all her vivacity lay something cold and grim.    Harley rejoined us in half an hour or so, but I could see that he was  as conscious of the air of tension as I was. All Madame's high spirits  could not enable her to conceal the fact that she was anxious to retire.  But Harley's evident desire to do likewise surprised me very greatly;  for from the point of view of the investigation the day had been an  unsatisfactory one. I knew that there must be a hundred and one things  which my friend desired to know, questions which Madame de Staemer could  have answered. Nevertheless, at about ten o'clock we separated for  the night, and although I was intensely anxious to talk to Harley, his  reticent mood had descended upon him again, and:    \"Sleep well, Knox,\" he said, as he paused at my door. \"I may be  awakening you early.\"    With which cryptic remark and not another word he passed on and entered  his own room.          CHAPTER XI    THE SHADOW ON THE BLIND        Perhaps it was childish on my part, but I accepted this curt dismissal  very ill-humouredly. That Harley, for some reason of his own, wished  to be alone, was evident enough, but I resented being excluded from his  confidence, even temporarily. It would seem that he had formed a theory  in the prosecution of which my cooeperation was not needed. And what  with profitless conjectures concerning its nature, and memories of  Val Beverley's pathetic parting glance as we had bade one another  good-night, sleep seemed to be out of the question, and I stood for a  long time staring out of the open window.    The weather remained almost tropically hot, and the moon floated in a  cloudless sky. I looked down upon the closely matted leaves of the box  hedge, which rose to within a few feet of my window, and to the left I  could obtain a view of the close-hemmed courtyard before the doors of  Cray's Folly. On the right the yews began, obstructing my view of the  Tudor garden, but the night air was fragrant, and the outlook one of  peace.    After a time, then, as no sound came from the adjoining room, I turned  in, and despite all things was soon fast asleep.    Almost immediately, it seemed, I was awakened. In point of fact, nearly  four hours had elapsed. A hand grasped my shoulder, and I sprang up in  bed with a stifled cry, but:    \"It's all right, Knox,\" came Harley's voice. \"Don't make a noise.\"    \"Harley!\" I said. \"Harley! what has happened?\"    \"Nothing, nothing. I am sorry to have to disturb your beauty sleep, but  in the absence of Innes I am compelled to use you as a dictaphone,  Knox. I like to record impressions while they are fresh, hence my having  awakened you.\"    \"But what has happened?\" I asked again, for my brain was not yet fully  alert.    \"No, don't light up!\" said Harley, grasping my wrist as I reached out  toward the table-lamp.    His figure showed as a black silhouette against the dim square of the  window.    \"Why not?\"    \"Well, it's nearly two o'clock. The light might be observed.\"    \"Two o'clock?\" I exclaimed.    \"Yes. I think we might smoke, though. Have you any cigarettes? I have  left my pipe behind.\"    I managed to find my case, and in the dim light of the match which I  presently struck I saw that Paul Harley's face was very fixed and grim.  He seated himself on the edge of my bed, and:    \"I have been guilty of a breach of hospitality, Knox,\" he began. \"Not  only have I secretly had my own car sent down here, but I have had  something else sent, as well. I brought it in under my coat this  evening.\"    \"To what do you refer, Harley?\"    \"You remember the silken rope-ladder with bamboo rungs which I brought  from Hongkong on one occasion?\"    \"Yes--\"    \"Well, I have it in my bag now.\"    \"But, my dear fellow, what possible use can it be to you at Cray's  Folly?\"    \"It has been of great use,\" he returned, shortly.    \"It enabled me to descend from my window a couple of hours ago and to  return again quite recently without disturbing the household. Don't  reproach me, Knox. I know it is a breach of confidence, but so is the  behaviour of Colonel Menendez.\"    \"You refer to his reticence on certain points?\"    \"I do. I have a reputation to lose, Knox, and if an ingenious piece of  Chinese workmanship can save it, it shall be saved.\"    \"But, my dear Harley, why should you want to leave the house secretly at  night?\"    Paul Harley's cigarette glowed in the dark, then:    \"My original object,\" he replied, \"was to endeavour to learn if any one  were really watching the place. For instance, I wanted to see if all  lights were out at the Guest House.\"    \"And were they?\" I asked, eagerly.    \"They were. Secondly,\" he continued, \"I wanted to convince myself that  there were no nocturnal prowlers from within or without.\"    \"What do you mean by within or without?\"    \"Listen, Knox.\" He bent toward me in the dark, grasping my shoulder  firmly. \"One window in Cray's Folly was lighted up.\"    \"At what hour?\"    \"The light is there yet.\"    That he was about to make some strange revelation I divined. I detected  the fact, too, that he believed this revelation would be unpleasant to  me; and in this I found an explanation of his earlier behaviour. He had  seemed distraught and ill at ease when he had joined Madame de Staemer,  Miss Beverley, and myself in the drawing room. I could only suppose that  this and the abrupt parting with me outside my door had been due to  his holding "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64"],[0,"The Gods of Mars (#17)"],[1,"bound, we were  thrown into a small compartment which contained a single port-hole.  As  our escort left us they barred the door behind them.    We could hear the men working on the broken propellers, and from the  port-hole we could see that the vessel was drifting lazily toward the  south.    For some time neither of us spoke.  Each was occupied with his own  thoughts.  For my part I was wondering as to the fate of Tars Tarkas  and the girl, Thuvia.    Even if they succeeded in eluding pursuit they must eventually fall  into the hands of either red men or green, and as fugitives from the  Valley Dor they could look for but little else than a swift and  terrible death.    How I wished that I might have accompanied them.  It seemed to me that  I could not fail to impress upon the intelligent red men of Barsoom the  wicked deception that a cruel and senseless superstition had foisted  upon them.    Tardos Mors would believe me.  Of that I was positive.  And that he  would have the courage of his convictions my knowledge of his character  assured me.  Dejah Thoris would believe me.  Not a doubt as to that  entered my head.  Then there were a thousand of my red and green  warrior friends whom I knew would face eternal damnation gladly for my  sake.  Like Tars Tarkas, where I led they would follow.    My only danger lay in that should I ever escape the black pirates it  might be to fall into the hands of unfriendly red or green men.  Then  it would mean short shrift for me.    Well, there seemed little to worry about on that score, for the  likelihood of my ever escaping the blacks was extremely remote.    The girl and I were linked together by a rope which permitted us to  move only about three or four feet from each other.  When we had  entered the compartment we had seated ourselves upon a low bench  beneath the porthole.  The bench was the only furniture of the room.  It was of sorapus wood.  The floor, ceiling and walls were of  carborundum aluminum, a light, impenetrable composition extensively  utilized in the construction of Martian fighting ships.    As I had sat meditating upon the future my eyes had been riveted upon  the port-hole which was just level with them as I sat.  Suddenly I  looked toward Phaidor.  She was regarding me with a strange expression  I had not before seen upon her face.  She was very beautiful then.    Instantly her white lids veiled her eyes, and I thought I discovered a  delicate flush tingeing her cheek.  Evidently she was embarrassed at  having been detected in the act of staring at a lesser creature, I  thought.    \"Do you find the study of the lower orders interesting?\" I asked,  laughing.    She looked up again with a nervous but relieved little laugh.    \"Oh very,\" she said, \"especially when they have such excellent  profiles.\"    It was my turn to flush, but I did not.  I felt that she was poking fun  at me, and I admired a brave heart that could look for humour on the  road to death, and so I laughed with her.    \"Do you know where we are going?\" she said.    \"To solve the mystery of the eternal hereafter, I imagine,\" I replied.    \"I am going to a worse fate than that,\" she said, with a little shudder.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I can only guess,\" she replied, \"since no thern damsel of all the  millions that have been stolen away by black pirates during the ages  they have raided our domains has ever returned to narrate her  experiences among them.  That they never take a man prisoner lends  strength to the belief that the fate of the girls they steal is worse  than death.\"    \"Is it not a just retribution?\" I could not help but ask.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Do not the therns themselves do likewise with the poor creatures who  take the voluntary pilgrimage down the River of Mystery?  Was not  Thuvia for fifteen years a plaything and a slave?  Is it less than just  that you should suffer as you have caused others to suffer?\"    \"You do not understand,\" she replied.  \"We therns are a holy race.  It  is an honour to a lesser creature to be a slave among us.  Did we not  occasionally save a few of the lower orders that stupidly float down an  unknown river to an unknown end all would become the prey of the plant  men and the apes.\"    \"But do you not by every means encourage the superstition among those  of the outside world?\" I argued.  \"That is the wickedest of your deeds.  Can you tell me why you foster the cruel deception?\"    \"All life on Barsoom,\" she said, \"is created solely for the support of  the race of therns.  How else could we live did the outer world not  furnish our labour and our food?  Think you that a thern would demean  himself by labour?\"    \"It is true then that you eat human flesh?\" I asked in horror.    She looked at me in pitying commiseration for my ignorance.    \"Truly we eat the flesh of the lower orders.  Do not you also?\"    \"The flesh of beasts, yes,\" I replied, \"but not the flesh of man.\"    \"As man may eat of the flesh of beasts, so may gods eat of the flesh of  man.  The Holy Therns are the gods of Barsoom.\"    I was disgusted and I imagine that I showed it.    \"You are an unbeliever now,\" she continued gently, \"but should we be  fortunate enough to escape the clutches of the black pirates and come  again to the court of Matai Shang I think that we shall find an  argument to convince you of the error of your ways.  And--,\" she  hesitated, \"perhaps we shall find a way to keep you as--as--one of us.\"    Again her eyes dropped to the floor, and a faint colour suffused her  cheek.  I could not understand her meaning; nor did I for a long time.  Dejah Thoris was wont to say that in some things I was a veritable  simpleton, and I guess that she was right.    \"I fear that I would ill requite your father's hospitality,\" I  answered, \"since the first thing that I should do were I a thern would  be to set an armed guard at the mouth of the River Iss to escort the  poor deluded voyagers back to the outer world.  Also should I devote my  life to the extermination of the hideous plant men and their horrible  companions, the great white apes.\"    She looked at me really horror struck.    \"No, no,\" she cried, \"you must not say such terribly sacrilegious  things--you must not even think them.  Should they ever guess that you  entertained such frightful thoughts, should we chance to regain the  temples of the therns, they would mete out a frightful death to you.  Not even my--my--\"  Again she flushed, and started over.  \"Not even I  could save you.\"    I said no more.  Evidently it was useless.  She was even more steeped  in superstition than the Martians of the outer world.  They only  worshipped a beautiful hope for a life of love and peace and happiness  in the hereafter.  The therns worshipped the hideous plant men and the  apes, or at least they reverenced them as the abodes of the departed  spirits of their own dead.    At this point the door of our prison opened to admit Xodar.    He smiled pleasantly at me, and when he smiled his expression was  kindly--anything but cruel or vindictive.    \"Since you cannot escape under any circumstances,\" he said, \"I cannot  see the necessity for keeping you confined below.  I will cut your  bonds and you may come on deck.  You will witness something very  interesting, and as you never shall return to the outer world it will  do no harm to permit you to see it.  You will see what no other than  the First Born and their slaves know the existence of--the subterranean  entrance to the Holy Land, to the real heaven of Barsoom.    \"It will be an excellent lesson for this daughter of the therns,\" he  added, \"for she shall see the Temple of Issus, and Issus, perchance,  shall embrace her.\"    Phaidor's head went high.    \"What blasphemy is this, dog of a pirate?\" she cried.  \"Issus would  wipe out your entire breed an' you ever came within sight of her  temple.\"    \"You have much to learn, thern,\" replied Xodar, with an ugly smile,  \"nor do I envy you the manner in which you will learn it.\"    As we came on deck I saw to my surprise that the vessel was passing  over a great field of snow and ice.  As far as the eye could reach in  any direction naught else was visible.    There could be but one solution to the mystery.  We were above the  south polar ice cap.  Only at the poles of Mars is there ice or snow  upon the planet.  No sign of life appeared below us.  Evidently we were  too far south even for the great fur-bearing animals which the Martians  so delight in hunting.    Xodar was at my side as I stood looking out over the ship's rail.    \"What course?\" I asked him.    \"A little west of south,\" he replied.  \"You will see the Otz Valley  directly.  We shall skirt it for a few hundred miles.\"    \"The Otz Valley!\" I exclaimed; \"but, man, is not there where lie the  domains of the therns from which I but just escaped?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Xodar.  \"You crossed this ice field last night in the  long chase that you led us.  The Otz Valley lies in a mighty depression  at the south pole.  It is sunk thousands of feet below the level of the  surrounding country, like a great round bowl.  A hundred miles from its  northern boundary rise the Otz Mountains which circle the inner Valley  of Dor, in the exact centre of which lies the Lost Sea of Korus.  On  the shore of this sea stands the Golden Temple of Issus in the Land of  the First Born.  It is there that we are bound.\"    As I looked I commenced to realize why it was that in all the ages only  one had escaped from the Valley Dor.  My only wonder was that even the  one had been successful.  To cross this frozen, wind-swept waste of  bleak ice alone and on foot would be impossible.    \"Only by air boat could the journey be made,\" I finished aloud.    \"It was thus that one did escape the therns in bygone times; but none  has ever escaped the First Born,\" said Xodar, with a touch of pride in  his voice.    We had now reached the southernmost extremity of the great ice barrier."]]]
