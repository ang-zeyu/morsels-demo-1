We glanced back at the  camp, which was in full sight. Our companions, inspired by emulation,  were leveling their tents and driving in their cattle and horses.    \"Take the horse out,\" said I.    I took the saddle from Pontiac and put it upon Hendrick; the former  was harnessed to the cart in an instant. \"Avance donc!\" cried Delorier.  Pontiac strode up the hill, twitching the little cart after him as if  it were a feather's weight; and though, as we gained the top, we saw the  wagons of our deserted comrades just getting into motion, we had little  fear that they could overtake us. Leaving the trail, we struck directly  across the country, and took the shortest cut to reach the main stream  of the Platte. A deep ravine suddenly intercepted us. We skirted its  sides until we found them less abrupt, and then plunged through the best  way we could. Passing behind the sandy ravines called \"Ash Hollow,\" we  stopped for a short nooning at the side of a pool of rain-water; but  soon resumed our journey, and some hours before sunset were descending  the ravines and gorges opening downward upon the Platte to the west of  Ash Hollow. Our horses waded to the fetlock in sand; the sun scorched  like fire, and the air swarmed with sand-flies and mosquitoes.    At last we gained the Platte. Following it for about five miles, we saw,  just as the sun was sinking, a great meadow, dotted with hundreds of  cattle, and beyond them an emigrant encampment. A party of about a dozen  came out to meet us, looking upon us at first with cold and suspicious  faces. Seeing four men, different in appearance and equipment from  themselves, emerging from the hills, they had taken us for the van  of the much-dreaded Mormons, whom they were very apprehensive of  encountering. We made known our true character, and then they greeted  us cordially. They expressed much surprise that so small a party should  venture to traverse that region, though in fact such attempts are not  unfrequently made by trappers and Indian traders. We rode with them to  their camp. The wagons, some fifty in number, with here and there a tent  intervening, were arranged as usual in a circle; in the area within the  best horses were picketed, and the whole circumference was glowing with  the dusky light of the fires, displaying the forms of the women and  children who were crowded around them. This patriarchal scene was  curious and striking enough; but we made our escape from the place with  all possible dispatch, being tormented by the intrusive curiosity of the  men who crowded around us. Yankee curiosity was nothing to theirs. They  demanded our names, where we came from, where we were going, and what  was our business. The last query was particularly embarrassing; since  traveling in that country, or indeed anywhere, from any other motive  than gain, was an idea of which they took no cognizance. Yet they were  fine-looking fellows, with an air of frankness, generosity, and even  courtesy, having come from one of the least barbarous of the frontier  counties.    We passed about a mile beyond them, and encamped. Being too few in  number to stand guard without excessive fatigue, we extinguished our  fire, lest it should attract the notice of wandering Indians; and  picketing our horses close around us, slept undisturbed till morning.  For three days we traveled without interruption, and on the evening of  the third encamped by the well-known spring on Scott's Bluff.    Henry Chatillon and I rode out in the morning, and descending the  western side of the Bluff, were crossing the plain beyond. Something  that seemed to me a file of buffalo came into view, descending the  hills several miles before us. But Henry reined in his horse, and keenly  peering across the prairie with a better and more practiced eye, soon  discovered its real nature. \"Indians!\" he said. \"Old Smoke's lodges, I  b'lieve. Come! let us go! Wah! get up, now, Five Hundred Dollar!\" And  laying on the lash with good will, he galloped forward, and I rode by  his side. Not long after, a black speck became visible on the prairie,  full two miles off. It grew larger and larger; it assumed the form of  a man and horse; and soon we could discern a naked Indian, careering at  full gallop toward us. When within a furlong he wheeled his horse in  a wide circle, and made him describe various mystic figures upon the  prairie; and Henry immediately compelled Five Hundred Dollar to execute  similar evolutions. \"It IS Old Smoke's village,\" said he, interpreting  these signals; \"didn't I say so?\"    As the Indian approached we stopped to wait for him, when suddenly he  vanished, sinking, as it were, into the earth. He had come upon one of  the deep ravines that everywhere intersect these prairies. In an instant  the rough head of his horse stretched upward from the edge and the rider  and steed came scrambling out, and bounded up to us; a sudden jerk of  the rein brought the wild panting horse to a full stop. Then followed  the needful formality of shaking hands. I forget our visitor's name.  He was a young fellow, of no note in his nation; yet in his person and  equipments he was a good specimen of a Dakota warrior in his ordinary  traveling dress. Like most of his people, he was nearly six feet high;  lithely and gracefully, yet strongly proportioned; and with a skin  singularly clear and delicate. He wore no paint; his head was bare; and  his long hair was gathered in a clump behind, to the top of which was  attached transversely, both by way of ornament and of talisman, the  mystic whistle, made of the wingbone of the war eagle, and endowed with  various magic virtues. From the back of his head descended a line of  glittering brass plates, tapering from the size of a doubloon to that of  a half-dime, a cumbrous ornament, in high vogue among the Dakotas, and  for which they pay the traders a most extravagant price; his chest and  arms were naked, the buffalo robe, worn over them when at rest, had  fallen about his waist, and was confined there by a belt. This, with the  gay moccasins on his feet, completed his attire. For arms he carried a  quiver of dogskin at his back, and a rude but powerful bow in his hand.  His horse had no bridle; a cord of hair, lashed around his jaw, served  in place of one. The saddle was of most singular construction; it was  made of wood covered with raw hide, and both pommel and cantle rose  perpendicularly full eighteen inches, so that the warrior was wedged  firmly in his seat, whence nothing could dislodge him but the bursting  of the girths.    Advancing with our new companion, we found more of his people seated in  a circle on the top of a hill; while a rude procession came straggling  down the neighboring hollow, men, women, and children, with horses  dragging the lodge-poles behind them. All that morning, as we moved  forward, tall savages were stalking silently about us. At noon we  reached Horse Creek; and as we waded through the shallow water, we saw a  wild and striking scene. The main body of the Indians had arrived before  us. On the farther bank stood a large and strong man, nearly naked,  holding a white horse by a long cord, and eyeing us as we approached.  This was the chief, whom Henry called \"Old Smoke.\" Just behind him his  youngest and favorite squaw sat astride of a fine mule; it was covered  with caparisons of whitened skins, garnished with blue and white beads,  and fringed with little ornaments of metal that tinkled with every  movement of the animal. The girl had a light clear complexion, enlivened  by a spot of vermilion on each cheek; she smiled, not to say grinned,  upon us, showing two gleaming rows of white teeth. In her hand, she  carried the tall lance of her unchivalrous lord, fluttering with  feathers; his round white shield hung at the side of her mule; and his  pipe was slung at her back. Her dress was a tunic of deerskin, made  beautifully white by means of a species of clay found on the prairie,  and ornamented with beads, arrayed in figures more gay than tasteful,  and with long fringes at all the seams. Not far from the chief stood a  group of stately figures, their white buffalo robes thrown over their  shoulders, gazing coldly upon us; and in the rear, for several acres,  the ground was covered with a temporary encampment; men, women, and  children swarmed like bees; hundreds of dogs, of all sizes and colors,  ran restlessly about; and, close at hand, the wide shallow stream was  alive with boys, girls, and young squaws, splashing, screaming, and  laughing in the water. At the same time a long train of emigrant  wagons were crossing the creek, and dragging on in their slow, heavy  procession, passed the encampment of the people whom they and their  descendants, in the space of a century, are to sweep from the face of  the earth.    The encampment itself was merely a temporary one during the heat of the  day. None of the lodges were erected; but their heavy leather coverings,  and the long poles used to support them, were scattered everywhere  around, among weapons, domestic utensils, and the rude harness of mules  and horses. The squaws of each lazy warrior had made him a shelter  from the sun, by stretching a few buffalo robes, or the corner of a  lodge-covering upon poles; and here he sat in the shade, with a favorite  young squaw, perhaps, at his side, glittering with all imaginable  trinkets. Before him stood the insignia of his rank as a warrior, his  white shield of bull-hide, his medicine bag, his bow and quiver, his  lance and his pipe, raised aloft on a tripod of three poles. Except the  dogs, the most active and noisy tenants of the camp were the old women,  ugly as Macbeth's witches, with their hair streaming loose in the wind,  and nothing but the tattered fragment of an old buffalo robe to hide  their shriveled wiry limbs. The day of their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10163"],[0,"Mohammedanism (#18)"],[1,"e,  contrasted with her rights against him, is a still more serious impediment  to the development of family life than the institution of polygamy; more  serious, also, than veiling and seclusion of women. Where the general  opinion is favourable to the improvement of the position of women in  society, there is always found a way to secure it to them without  conflicting with the divine law; but a radical reform will remain most  difficult so long as that law which allows the man to repudiate his wife  without any reason, whereas it delivers the woman almost unarmed into the  power of her husband, is considered to be one of the permanent treasures of  Islam.    It is a pity indeed that thus far women vigorously striving for liberation  from those mediaeval institutions are rare exceptions in Mohammedan  countries. Were Mohammedan women capable of the violent tactics of  suffragettes, they would rather try to blow up the houses of feminists than  those of the patrons of the old regime. The ordinary Mohammedan woman looks  upon the endeavour of her husband to induce her to partake freely in public  life as a want of consideration; it makes on her about the same impression  as that which a respectable woman in our society would receive from her  husband encouraging her to visit places generally frequented by people of  bad reputation. It is the girls' school that will awaken those sleeping  ones and so, slowly and gradually, prepare a better future, when the Moslim  woman will be the worthy companion of her husband and the intelligent  educator of her children. This will be due, then, neither to the Prophet's  Sunnah nor to the infallible Agreement of the Community of the first  centuries of Islam, but to the irresistible power of the evolution of human  society, which is merciless to laws even of divine origin and transfers  them, when their time is come, from the treasury of everlasting goods to a  museum of antiquities.    Slavery, and in its consequence free intercourse of a man with his own  female slaves without any limitation as to their number, has also been  incorporated into the sacred law, and therefore has been placed on the  wrong side of the border that is to divide eternal things from temporal  ones. This should not be called a mediaeval institution; the most civilized  nations not having given it up before the middle of the nineteenth century.  The law of Islam regulated the position of slaves with much equity, and  there is a great body of testimony from people who have spent a part of  their lives among Mohammedan nations which does justice to the benevolent  treatment which bondmen generally receive from their masters there. Besides  that, we are bound to state that in many Western countries or countries  under Western domination whole groups of the population live under  circumstances with which those of Mohammedan slavery may be compared to  advantage.    The only legal cause of slavery in Islam is prisonership of war or birth  from slave parents. The captivity of enemies of Islam has not at all  necessarily the effect of enslaving them; for the competent authorities  may dispose of them in any other way, also in the way prescribed by modern  international law or custom. In proportion to the realization of the  political ideal of Islam the number of its enemies must diminish and the  possibilities of enslaving men must consequently decrease. Setting slaves  free is one of the most meritorious pious works, and, at the same time,  the regular atonement for certain transgressions of the sacred law. So,  according to Mohammedan principles, slavery is an institution destined  to disappear. When, in the last century, Mohammedan princes signed  international treaties for the suppression of slavery, from their point of  view this was a premature anticipation of a future political and social  development--a step which they felt obliged to take out of consideration  for the great powers. In Arabia, every effort of the Turkish Government to  put such international agreements into execution has thus far given rise to  popular sedition against the Ottoman authority. Therefore, the promulgation  of decrees of abolition was stopped; and slavery continued to exist. The  import of slaves from Africa has, in fact, considerably diminished; but I  am not quite sure of the proportional increase of the liberty which the  natives of that continent enjoy at home.    Slavery as well as polygamy is in a certain sense to Mohammedans a sacred  institution, being incorporated in their Holy Law; but the practice of  neither of the two institutions is indispensable to the integrity of Islam.    All those antiquated institutions, if considered from the point of view of  modern international intercourse, are only a trifle in comparison with the  legal prescriptions of Islam concerning the attitude of the Mohammedan  community against the parts of the world not yet subject to its authority,  \"the Abode of War\" as they are technically called. It is a principal duty  of the Khalif, or of the chiefs considered as his substitutes in different  countries, to avail themselves of every opportunity to extend by force the  dominion of Allah and His Messenger. With unsubdued unbelievers _peace_  is not _allowed_; a _truce_ for a period not exceeding ten years may be  concluded if the interest of Islam requires it.    The chapters of the Mohammedan law on holy war and on the conditions on  which the submission of the adherents of tolerated religions is to be  accepted seem to be a foolish pretension if we consider them by the light  of the actual division of political power in the world. But here, too, to  understand is better than to ridicule. In the centuries in which the system  of Islam acquired its maturity, such an aspiration after universal dominion  was not at all ridiculous; and many Christian states of the time were  far from reaching the Mohammedan standard of tolerance against heterodox  creeds. The delicate point is this, that the petrification or at least the  process of stiffening that has attacked the whole spiritual life of Islam  since about 1000 A.D. makes its accommodation to the requirements of modern  intercourse a most difficult problem.    But it is not only the Mohammedan community that needed misfortune and  humiliation before it was able to appreciate liberty of conscience; or that  took a long time to digest those painful lessons of history. There  are still Christian Churches which accept religious liberty only in  circumstances that make supreme authority unattainable to them; and which,  elsewhere, would not disdain the use of material means to subdue spirits to  what they consider the absolute truth.    To judge such things with equity, we must remember that every man possessed  of a firm conviction of any kind is more or less a missionary; and the  belief in the possibility of winning souls by violence has many adherents  everywhere. One of my friends among the young-Turkish state officials,  who wished to persuade me of the perfect religious tolerance of Turkey of  today, concluded his argument by the following reflection: \"Formerly men  used to behead each other for difference of opinion about the Hereafter.  Nowadays, praise be to Allah, we are permitted to believe what we like; but  people continue to kill each other for political or social dissension. That  is most pitiful indeed; for the weapons in use being more terrible and more  costly than before, mankind lacks the peace necessary to enjoy the liberty  of conscience it has acquired.\"    The truthful irony of these words need not prevent us from considering the  independence of spiritual life and the liberation of its development from  material compulsion as one of the greatest blessings of our civilization.  We feel urged by missionary zeal of the better kind to make the Mohammedan  world partake in its enjoyment. In the Turkish Empire, in Egypt, in many  Mohammedan countries under Western control, the progressive elements of  Moslim society spontaneously meet us half-way. But behind them are the  millions who firmly adhere to the old superstition and are supported by  the canonists, those faithful guardians of what the infallible Community  declared almost one thousand years ago to be the doctrine and rule of life  for all centuries to come. Will it ever prove possible to move in one  direction a body composed of such different elements, or will this body be  torn in pieces when the movement has become irresistible?    We have more than once pointed to the catholic character of orthodox Islam.  In fact, the diversity of spiritual tendencies is not less in the Moslim  world than within the sphere of Christian influence; but in Islam, apart  from the political schisms of the first centuries, that diversity has not  given rise to anything like the division of Christianity into sects. There  is a prophetic saying, related by Tradition, which later generations have  generally misunderstood to mean that the Mohammedan community would be  split into seventy-three different sects. Moslim heresiologists have been  induced by this prediction to fill up their lists of seventy-three numbers  with all sorts of names, many of which represent nothing but individual  opinions of more or less famous scholars on subordinate points of doctrine  or law. Almost ninety-five per cent. of all Mohammedans are indeed bound  together by a spiritual unity that may be compared with that of the Roman  Catholic Church, within whose walls there is also room for religious and  intellectual life of very different origin and tendency. In the sense of  broadness, Islam has this advantage, that there is no generally recognized  palpable authority able to stop now and then the progress of modernism or  similar deviations from the trodden path with an imperative \"Halt!\" There  is no lack indeed of mutual accusation of heresy; but this remains without  serious consequences because "]]]
