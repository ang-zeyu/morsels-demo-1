The term fallow, in Agriculture, designates that period in which the  soil, left to the influence of the atmosphere, becomes enriched with  those soluble mineral constituents. Fallow, however, does not  generally imply an entire cessation of cultivation, but only an  interval in the growth of the cerealia. That store of silicates and  alkalies which is the principal condition of their success is  obtained, if potatoes or turnips are grown upon the same fields in  the intermediate periods, since these crops do not abstract a  particle of silica, and therefore leave the field equally fertile  for the following crop of wheat.    The preceding remarks will render it obvious to you, that the  mechanical working of the soil is the simplest and cheapest method  of rendering the elements of nutrition contained in it accessible to  plants.    But it may be asked, Are there not other means of decomposing the  soil besides its mechanical subdivision?--are there not substances,  which by their chemical operation will equally well or better render  its constituents suitable for entering into vegetable organisms?  Yes: we certainly possess such substances, and one of them, namely,  quick-lime, has been employed for the last century past in England  for this purpose; and it would be difficult to find a substance  better adapted to this service, as it is simple, and in almost all  localities cheap and easily accessible.    In order to obtain correct views respecting the effect of quick-lime  upon the soil, let me remind you of the first process employed by  the chemist when he is desirous of analysing a mineral, and for this  purpose wishes to bring its elements into a soluble state. Let the  mineral to be examined be, for instance, feldspar; this substance,  taken alone, even when reduced to the finest powder, requires for  its solution to be treated with an acid for weeks or months; but if  we first mix it with quick-lime, and expose the mixture to a  moderately strong heat, the lime enters into chemical combination  with certain elements of the feldspar, and its alkali (potass) is  set free. And now the acid, even without heat, dissolves not only  the lime, but also so much of the silica of the feldspar as to form  a transparent jelly. The same effect which the lime in this process,  with the aid of heat, exerts upon the feldspar, it produces when it  is mixed with the alkaline argillaceous silicates, and they are for  a long time kept together in a moist state.    Common potters' clay, or pipe-clay, diffused through water, and  added to milk of lime, thickens immediately upon mixing; and if the  mixture is kept for some months, and then treated with acid, the  clay becomes gelatinous, which would not occur without the admixture  with the lime. The lime, in combining with the elements of the clay,  liquifies it; and, what is more remarkable, liberates the greater  part of its alkalies. These interesting facts were first observed by  Fuchs, at Munich: they have not only led to a more intimate  knowledge of the nature and properties of the hydraulic cements,  but, what is far more important, they explain the effects of caustic  lime upon the soil, and guide the agriculturist in the application  of an invaluable means of opening it, and setting free its  alkalies--substances so important, nay, so indispensable to his  crops.    In the month of October the fields of Yorkshire and Oxfordshire look  as it they were covered with snow. Whole square miles are seen  whitened over with quicklime, which during the moist winter months,  exercises its beneficial influence upon the stiff, clayey soil, of  those counties.    According to the humus theory, quick-lime ought to exert the most  noxious influence upon the soil, because all organic matters  contained in it are destroyed by it, and rendered incapable of  yielding their humus to a new vegetation. The facts are indeed  directly contrary to this now abandoned theory: the fertility of the  soil is increased by the lime. The cerealia require the alkalies and  alkaline silicates, which the action of the lime renders fit for  assimilation by the plants. If, in addition to these, there is any  decaying organic matter present in the soil supplying carbonic acid,  it may facilitate their development; but it is not essential to  their growth. If we furnish the soil with ammonia, and the  phosphates, which are indispensable to the cerealia, with the  alkaline silicates, we have all the conditions necessary to ensure  an abundant harvest. The atmosphere is an inexhaustible store of  carbonic acid.    A no less favourable influence than that of lime is exercised upon  the soil of peaty land by the mere act of burning it: this greatly  enhances its fertility. We have not long been acquainted with the  remarkable change which the properties of clay undergo by burning.  The observation was first made in the process of analysing the clay  silicates. Many of these, in their natural state, are not acted on  by acids, but they become perfectly soluble if heated to redness  before the application of the acid. This property belongs to  potters' clay, pipe-clay, loam, and many different modifications of  clay in soils. In their natural state they may be boiled in  concentrated sulphuric acid, without sensible change; but if feebly  burned, as is done with the pipe-clay in many alum manufactories,  they dissolve in the acid with the greatest facility, the contained  silica being separated like jelly in a soluble state. Potters' clay  belongs to the most sterile kinds of soil, and yet it contains  within itself all the constituent elements essential to a most  luxurious growth of plants; but their mere presence is insufficient  to secure this end. The soil must be accessible to the atmosphere,  to its oxygen, to its carbonic acid; these must penetrate it, in  order to secure the conditions necessary to a happy and vigorous  development of the roots. The elements present must be brought into  that peculiar state of combination which will enable them to enter  into plants. Plastic clay is wanting in these properties; but they  are imparted to it by a feeble calcination.    At Hardwicke Court, near Gloucester, I have seen a garden (Mr.  Baker's) consisting of a stiff clay, which was perfectly sterile,  become by mere burning extremely fertile. The operation was extended  to a depth of three feet. This was an expensive process, certainly;  but it was effectual.    The great difference in the properties of burnt and unburnt clay is  illustrated by what is seen in brick houses, built in moist  situations. In the town of Flanders, for instance, where most  buildings are of brick, effloresences of salts cover the surfaces of  the walls, like a white nap, within a few days after they are  erected. If this saline incrustation is washed away by the rain, it  soon re-appears; and this is even observed on walls which, like the  gateway of Lisle, have been erected for centuries. These saline  incrustations consist of carbonates and sulphates, with alkaline  bases; and it is well known these act an important part in  vegetation. The influence of lime in their production is manifested  by their appearing first at the place where the mortar and brick  come into contact.    It will now be obvious to you, that in a mixture of clay with lime,  all the conditions exist for the solution of the silicated clay, and  the solubility of the alkaline silicates. The lime gradually  dissolving in water charged with carbonic acid, acts like milk of  lime upon the clay. This explains also the favourable influence  which marl (by which term all those varieties of clay rich in chalk  are designated) exerts upon most kinds of soil. There are marly  soils which surpass all others in fertility for all kinds of plants;  but I believe marl in a burnt state must be far more effective, as  well as other materials possessing a similar composition; as, for  instance, those species of limestone which are adapted to the  preparation of hydraulic cements,--for these carry to the soil not  only the alkaline bases useful to plants, but also silica in a state  capable of assimilation.    The ashes of coals and lignite are also excellent means of  ameliorating the soil, and they are used in many places for this  purpose. The most suitable may be readily known by their property of  forming a gelatinous mass when treated with acids, or by becoming,  when mixed with cream of lime, like hydraulic cement,--solid and  hard as stone.    I have now, I trust, explained to your satisfaction, that the  mechanical operations of agriculture--the application of lime and  chalk to lands, and the burning of clay--depend upon one and the  same scientific principle: they are means of accelerating the  decomposition of the alkaline clay silicates, in order to provide  plants, at the beginning of a new vegetation, with certain inorganic  matters indispensable for their nutrition.          LETTER XIV      My dear Sir,    I treated, in my last letter, of the means of improving the  condition of the soil for agricultural purposes by mechanical  operations and mineral agents. I have now to speak of the uses and  effects of animal exuviae, and vegetable matters or manures--properly  so called.    In order to understand the nature of these, and the peculiarity of  their influence upon our fields, it is highly important to keep in  mind the source whence they are derived.    It is generally known, that if we deprive an animal of food, the  weight of its body diminishes during every moment of its existence.  If this abstinence is continued for some time, the diminution  becomes apparent to the eye; all the fat of the body disappears, the  muscles decrease in firmness and bulk, and, if the animal is allowed  to die starved, scarcely anything but skin, tendon, and bones,  remain. This emaciation which occurs in a body otherwise healthy, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45303"],[0,"The Life of John Taylor (#17)"],[1,"all  who have advocated it in the face of the fierce opposition it provoked,  or who spoke out in its defense both at home and abroad, there was not  one whose arguments carried more weight than did his.    Meantime Nauvoo had arisen from the bogs of Commerce, and was now an  incorporated city, divided into four wards, with a population of nearly  five thousand. A glorious temple and other public buildings were in  course of construction, a periodical--the _Times and Seasons_--was  being published, and there was every prospect of the city becoming a  commercial and manufacturing center as well as the headquarters of the  Church.    It is scarcely necessary to say that the Twelve were heartily welcomed  home by the Prophet. He at once rolled on their shoulders much of the  responsibility he had carried during their absence; and called upon  them to assist in gathering the people to Nauvoo and to build up the  Stakes of Zion.    The Twelve forthwith published a proclamation to the Saints in the  British Isles, calling upon them to gather to Zion and to assist in  founding manufactories and other enterprises. Another was issued  denouncing thieves who began to infest Nauvoo, and whose villainy was  charged to the Saints; another calling for aid in the construction of  the temple. In all these labors Elder Taylor took a prominent part. He  was also elected a member of the City Council, made a member of the  Board of Regents for the Nauvoo University, and chosen Judge Advocate  with the rank of colonel in the Nauvoo Legion, a position that made him  the responsible adviser of the court and also the public prosecutor in  affairs military.    These labors, in connection with his private business, occupied his  attention after his return from England until February, 1842, when he  was chosen associate editor of the _Times and Seasons_, the Prophet  Joseph being editor-in-chief. This appointment introduced him into a  field of labor for which he was admirably adapted, and in which, during  his lifetime--notwithstanding his labors in that sphere were frequently  interrupted by the drivings of the Church and calls to other kinds of  employments--he accomplished much good, and became well known as a  powerful writer.    He occupied the position of associate editor on the _Times and Seasons_  for about a year, when the Prophet's increasing cares made it necessary  for him to resign his place as editor-in-chief. Elder Taylor was  appointed to take his place. He continued to edit and publish that  periodical until the Church was driven out of Nauvoo in the spring of  1846.    In addition to his labors on the _Times and Seasons_, within a year  he became the editor and proprietor of another paper, the _Nauvoo  Neighbor_, a large imperial sheet issued weekly, and devoted \"to the  dissemination of useful knowledge of every description--the arts,  science, religion, literature, agriculture, manufactures, trade,  commerce and the general news of the day.\" In both these periodicals he  ably defended the truth against all comers, and did much to stem the  flood of falsehood that set in against the character of the Prophet  Joseph.    The progress of Nauvoo was now by leaps and bounds, rapidly increasing  in trade, commerce and population. The Prophet Joseph's career, too,  was approaching its zenith. He was the most prominent man in the  State of Illinois, and much courted because of his supposed political  influence. Some of the most prominent men in the State sought his  friendship, but it too frequently happened that it was for selfish  purposes they courted him. No one was more sensitively aware of that  fact than Elder Taylor. He knew them to be flatterers of the Prophet,  that political thrift might follow fawning. They were heartless  parasites, clinging to him in his hour of prosperity, but ready to fall  away from and even betray him should the tide of his fortunes begin to  ebb, or their interests require his immolation to satisfy the clamor of  a prejudiced populace.    It was to remove the Prophet out of the filthy slough of party  politics, that he and his people might not be the shuttle-cock for the  battledoors of political demagogues--that he and they might not be the  subjects of fulsome praise on the one hand, nor of fierce denunciation  or unseemly vituperation on the other, that Elder Taylor urged the  Prophet's nomination for the presidency of the United States, in  February, 1844.    In a long editorial in the _Neighbor_, in which he nominates the  Prophet for President, he represents that as Henry Clay--then one of  the prominent candidates for President--inclined strongly to the old  school of federalists, his political principles were diametrically  opposed to those entertained by the people of Nauvoo, and hence they  could not conscientiously vote for him; and they had even stronger  objections to Mr. Van Buren, who, when the Saints appealed to him to  redress the outrages put upon them in Missouri, admitted the justice of  their cause, but claimed that he was powerless to assist them; he also  held that Congress was powerless to redress their grievances.    \"But all these things are tolerable to what we have yet to state,\" says  Elder Taylor. \"We have been informed from a respectable source, that  there is an understanding between Mr. Benton [Senator], of Missouri,  and Mr. Van Buren, and a conditional compact entered into that if Mr.  Benton will use his influence to get Mr. Van Buren elected, that Mr.  Van Buren, when elected, shall use his executive influence to wipe  away the stain from Missouri by a further persecution of the Mormons,  wreaking vengeance on their heads, either by extermination or by some  other summary process. We could scarcely credit the statement, and we  hope yet, for the sake of humanity, that the suggestion is false; but  we have too good reason to believe that we are correctly informed.\"    Then, after enlarging upon the fitness of the Prophet for the high  office of President of the United States, he adds:    \"One great reason that we have for pursuing our present course is that  at every election we have been made a political target for the filthy  demagogues in the country to shoot their loathsome arrows at. And every  story has been put into circulation to blast our fame, from the old  fabrication of 'walk on the water' down to the 'murder of Governor  Boggs.' The journals have teemed with this filthy trash, and even men  who ought to have more respect for themselves--men contending for the  gubernatorial chair--have made use of terms so degrading, so mean, so  humiliating, that a Billingsgate fisherwoman would have considered  herself disgraced with. We refuse any longer to be thus bedaubed for  either party; we tell all such to let their filth flow in its own  legitimate channel, for we are sick of the loathsome smell. * * * Under  existing circumstances we have no other alternative [than that of  withdrawing from both political parties,] and if we can accomplish our  object, well; if not we shall have the satisfaction of knowing we have  acted conscientiously and have used our best judgment; and if we have  to throw away our votes, we had better do so upon a worthy, rather than  upon an unworthy individual, who might make use of the weapon we put in  his hand to destroy us.    Then the Prophet was put before the country for President of the  United States. He published his views on the powers and policy of the  government, and called upon his friends to support him.    By adopting this policy there was a candidate in the field the Saints  could vote for conscientiously; and if their candidate from the  beginning was sure of defeat, they had at least removed themselves and  their religion from the filthy vortex of political controversy.

A RETROSPECT--A STATE'S CRIME--TROUBLE BREWING.    Thus far I have spoken only of those prosperous events which befell the  Saints at Nauvoo from the return of the Twelve from England, in July,  1841, to the nomination of the Prophet Joseph for president of the  United States, February, 1843. It now becomes necessary to note some of  those unfortunate events which befell them during the same period, with  all of which Elder Taylor had more or less to do.    Missouri was not satisfied with robbing the Saints wholesale and  expelling them from her borders, her hatred followed them to Illinois.  Of course the Prophet Joseph was the chief object of their fury. In  the fall of 1841 he was arrested upon a requisition from the Governor  of Missouri on the old charge of \"theft, arson and murder,\" assumed to  have been committed in Caldwell and Daviess Counties, in the autumn of  1838. He obtained a writ of _habeas corpus_ and the case came up before  Judge Stephen A. Douglass, at Monmouth, who found the writ on which he  was held illegal, and discharged the prisoner.    In the spring of 1842 an attempt was made to assassinate ex-Governor  Boggs of Missouri, and as soon as he recovered from the injuries  received, he charged Joseph Smith with being accessory before the  fact to the attempted murder. Again the Prophet was arrested under a  requisition from the Governor of Missouri, and again he obtained a writ  of _habeas corpus_ and went before the circuit court of the United  States, Judge Pope of Springfield, Illinois, presiding. Elder Taylor  and a few others accompanied him. The Prophet was anxious to have the  case tried on its merits, but this Judge Pope held to be unnecessary as  he was entitled to be discharged because of defects in the affidavit on  which the demand for his surrender to Missouri was made.    As the state legislature at the time was in session, there were  gathered in Springfield the principal men of the state; and as  they were all anxious to learn something of \"M"]]]
