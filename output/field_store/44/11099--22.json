Its position to the west of  an immense continent, and its insulated situation in the midst of  the sea, are no doubt the causes of this phenomenon. Navigators are  well aware that even the smallest islets, and those which are  without mountains, collect and harbour the clouds. The decrement of  heat is also different above the plains of Africa, and above the  surface of the Atlantic; and the strata of air, brought by the  trade winds, cool in proportion as they advance towards the west.  If the air has been extremely dry above the burning sands of the  desert, it is very quickly saturated when it enters into contact  with the surface of the sea, or with the air that lies on that  surface. It is easy to conceive, therefore, why vapours become  visible in the atmospherical strata, which, at a distance from the  continent, have no longer the same temperature as when they began  to be saturated with water. The considerable mass of a mountain,  rising in the midst of the Atlantic, is also an obstacle to the  clouds, which are driven out to sea by the winds.    On entering the streets of Santa Cruz, we felt a suffocating heat,  though the thermometer was not above twenty-five degrees. Those who  have for a long time inhaled the air of the sea suffer every time  they land; not because this air contains more oxygen than the air  on shore, as has been erroneously supposed, but because it is less  charged with those gaseous combinations, which the animal and  vegetable substances, and the mud resulting from their  decomposition, pour into the atmosphere. Miasms that escape  chemical analysis have a powerful effect on our organs, especially  when they have not for a long while been exposed to the same kind  of irritation.    Santa Cruz, the Anaza of the Guanches, is a neat town, with a  population of 8000 souls. I was not struck with the vast number of  monks and secular ecclesiastics, which travellers have thought  themselves bound to find in every country under the Spanish  government; nor shall I stop to enter into the description of the  churches; the library of the Dominicans, which contains scarcely a  few hundred volumes; the mole, where the inhabitants assemble to  inhale the freshness of the evening breeze; or the famed monument  of Carrara marble, thirty feet high, dedicated to Our Lady of  Candelaria, in memory of the miraculous appearance of the Virgin,  in 1392, at Chimisay, near Guimar. The port of Santa Cruz may be  considered as a great caravanserai, on the road to America and the  Indies. Every traveller who writes the narrative of his adventures,  begins by a description of Madeira and Teneriffe; and if in the  natural history of these islands there yet remains an immense field  untrodden, we must admit that the topography of the little towns of  Funchal, Santa Cruz, Laguna, and Orotava, leaves scarcely anything  untold.    The recommendation of the court of Madrid procured for us, in the  Canaries, as in all the other Spanish possessions, the most  satisfactory reception. The captain-general gave us immediate  permission to examine the island. Colonel Armiaga, who commanded a  regiment of infantry, received us into his house with kind  hospitality. We could not cease admiring the banana, the papaw  tree, the Poinciana pulcherrima, and other plants, which we had  hitherto seen only in hot-houses, cultivated in his garden in the  open air. The climate of the Canaries however is not warm enough to  ripen the real Platano Arton, with triangular fruit from seven to  eight inches long, and which, requiring a temperature of 24  centesimal degrees, does not flourish even in the valley of  Caracas. The bananas of Teneriffe are those named by the Spanish  planters Camburis or Guineos, and Dominicos. The Camburi, which  suffers least from cold, is cultivated with success even at Malaga,  where the temperature is only 18 degrees; but the fruit we see  occasionally at Cadiz comes from the Canary Islands by vessels  which make the passage in three or four days. In general, the musa,  known by every people under the torrid zone, though hitherto never  found in a wild state, has as great a variety of fruit as our apple  and pear trees. These varieties, which are confounded by the  greater part of botanists, though they require very different  climates, have become permanent by long cultivation.    We went to herborize in the evening in the direction of the fort of  Passo Alto, along the basaltic rocks that close the promontory of  Naga. We were very little satisfied with our harvest, for the  drought and dust had almost destroyed vegetation. The Cacalia  Kleinia, the Euphorbia canariensis, and several other succulent  plants, which draw their nourishment from the air rather than the  soil on which they grow, reminded us by their appearance, that this  group of islands belongs to Africa, and even to the most arid part  of that continent.    Though the captain of the Pizarro had orders to stop long enough at  Teneriffe to give us time to scale the summit of the peak, if the  snows did not prevent our ascent, we received notice, on account of  the blockade of the English ships, not to expect a longer delay  than four or five days. We consequently hastened our departure for  the port of Orotava, which is situated on the western declivity of  the volcano, where we were sure of finding guides. I could find no  one at Santa Cruz who had mounted the peak, and I was not surprised  at this. The most curious objects become less interesting, in  proportion as they are near to us; and I have known inhabitants of  Schaffhausen, in Switzerland, who had never seen the fall of the  Rhine but at a distance.    On the 20th of June, before sunrise, we began our excursion by  ascending to the Villa de Laguna, estimated to be at the elevation  of 350 toises above the port of Santa Cruz. We could not verify  this estimate of the height, the surf not having permitted us to  return on board during the night, to take our barometers and  dipping-needle. As we foresaw that our expedition to the peak would  be very precipitate, we consoled ourselves with the reflection that  it was well not to expose instruments which were to serve us in  countries less known by Europeans. The road by which we ascended to  Laguna is on the right of a torrent, or baranco, which in the rainy  season forms fine cascades; it is narrow and tortuous. Near the  town we met some white camels, which seemed to be very slightly  laden. The chief employment of these animals is to transport  merchandise from the custom-house to the warehouses of the  merchants. They are generally laden with two chests of Havannah  sugar, which together weigh 900 pounds; but this load may be  augmented to thirteen hundred-weight, or 52 arrobas of Castile.  Camels are not numerous at Teneriffe, whilst they exist by  thousands in the two islands of Lancerota and Forteventura; the  climate and vegetation of these islands, which are situated nearer  Africa, are more analogous to those of that continent. It is very  extraordinary, that this useful animal, which breeds in South  America, should be seldom propagated at Teneriffe. In the fertile  district of Adexe only, where the plantations of the sugar-cane are  most considerable, camels have sometimes been known to breed. These  beasts of burden, as well as horses, were brought into the Canary  Islands in the fifteenth century by the Norman conquerors. The  Guanches were previously unacquainted with them; and this fact  seems to be very well accounted for by the difficulty of  transporting an animal of such bulk in frail canoes, without the  necessity of considering the Guanches as a remnant of the people of  Atlantis, or a different race from that of the western Africans.    The hill, on which the town of San Christobal de la Laguna is  built, belongs to the system of basaltic mountains, which,  independent of the system of less ancient volcanic rocks, form a  broad girdle around the peak of Teneriffe. The basalt on which we  walked was darkish brown, compact, half-decomposed, and when  breathed on, emitted a clayey smell. We discovered amphibole,  olivine,* (* Peridot granuliforme. Hauy.) and translucid pyroxenes,  * (* Augite.--Werner.) with a perfectly lamellar fracture, of a  pale olive green, and often crystallized in prisms of six planes.  The first of these substances is extremely rare at Teneriffe; and I  never found it in the lavas of Vesuvius; but those of Etna contain  it in abundance. Notwithstanding the great number of blocks, which  we stopped to break, to the great regret of our guides, we could  discover neither nepheline, leucite,* (* Amphigene.--Hauy.) nor  feldspar. This last, which is so common in the basaltic lavas of  the island of Ischia, does not begin to appear at Teneriffe, till  we approach the volcano. The rock of Laguna is not columnar, but is  divided into ledges, of small thickness, and inclined to the east  at an angle of 30 or 40 degrees. It has nowhere the appearance of a  current of lava flowing from the sides of the peak. If the present  volcano has given birth to these basalts, we must suppose, that,  like the substances which compose the Somma, at the back of  Vesuvius, they are the effect of a submarine effusion, in which the  liquid mass has formed strata. A few arborescent Euphorbias, the  Cacalia Kleinia, and Indian figs (Cactus), which have become wild  in the Canary Islands, as well as in the south of Europe and the  whole continent of Africa, are the only plants we see on these arid  rocks. The feet of our mules were slipping every moment on beds of  stone, which were very steep. We nevertheless recognized the  remains of an ancient pavement. In these colonies we discover at  every step some traces of that activity which characterized the  Spanish nation in the 16th century.    As we approached Laguna, we felt the temperature of the atmosphere  gradually become"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6340"],[0,"Literary Lapses (#17)"],[1,"amateur theatricals.    Finally, to pay for the costumes for the theatricals,  the rector felt it his duty to dispense with the curate.    So that is where the church stands just at present. What  they chiefly want to do, is to raise enough money to buy  a suitable gold watch as a testimonial to the curate.  After that they hope to be able to do something for the  Armenians. Meantime, of course, the Armenians, the ones  right there in the town, are getting very troublesome.  To begin with, there is the Armenian who rented the  costumes for the theatricals: he has to be squared. Then  there is the Armenian organ dealer, and the Armenian who  owned the magic lantern. They want relief badly.    The most urgent case is that of the Armenian who holds  the mortgage on the parsonage; indeed it is generally  felt in the congregation, when the rector makes his  impassioned appeals at the special services on behalf of  the suffering cause, that it is to this man that he has  special reference.    In the meanwhile the general public subscription is not  getting along very fast; but the proprietor of the big  saloon further down the street and the man with the short  cigar that runs the Doogalville Midway Plaisance have  been most liberal in their contributions.          A Study in Still Life.--The Country Hotel    The country hotel stands on the sunny side of Main Street.  It has three entrances.    There is one in front which leads into the Bar. There is  one at the side called the Ladies' Entrance which leads  into the Bar from the side. There is also the Main Entrance  which leads into the Bar through the Rotunda.    The Rotunda is the space between the door of the bar-room  and the cigar-case.    In it is a desk and a book. In the book are written down  the names of the guests, together with marks indicating  the direction of the wind and the height of the barometer.  It is here that the newly arrived guest waits until he  has time to open the door leading to the Bar.    The bar-room forms the largest part of the hotel. It  constitutes the hotel proper. To it are attached a series  of bedrooms on the floor above, many of which contain  beds.    The walls of the bar-room are perforated in all directions  with trap-doors. Through one of these drinks are passed  into the back sitting-room. Through others drinks are  passed into the passages. Drinks are also passed through  the floor and through the ceiling. Drinks once passed  never return. The Proprietor stands in the doorway of  the bar. He weighs two hundred pounds. His face is  immovable as putty. He is drunk. He has been drunk for  twelve years. It makes no difference to him. Behind the  bar stands the Bar-tender. He wears wicker-sleeves, his  hair is curled in a hook, and his name is Charlie.    Attached to the bar is a pneumatic beer-pump, by means  of which the bar-tender can flood the bar with beer.  Afterwards he wipes up the beer with a rag. By this means  he polishes the bar. Some of the beer that is pumped up  spills into glasses and has to be sold.    Behind the bar-tender is a mechanism called a cash-register,  which, on being struck a powerful blow, rings a bell,  sticks up a card marked NO SALE, and opens a till from  which the bar-tender distributes money.    There is printed a tariff of drinks and prices on the wall.    It reads thus:      Beer . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 cents.       Whisky. . . . . . . . . . 5 cents.    Whisky and Soda. . . . . . . 5 cents.       Beer and Soda . . . . . . 5 cents.    Whisky and Beer and Soda . . 5 cents.       Whisky and Eggs . . . . . 5 cents.       Beer and Eggs . . . . . . 5 cents.          Champagne. . . . . . . 5 cents.          Cigars . . . . . . . . 5 cents.    Cigars, extra fine . . . . . 5 cents.    All calculations are made on this basis and are worked  out to three places of decimals. Every seventh drink is  on the house and is not followed by a distribution of  money.    The bar-room closes at midnight, provided there are enough  people in it. If there is not a quorum the proprietor  waits for a better chance. A careful closing of the bar  will often catch as many as twenty-five people. The bar  is not opened again till seven o'clock in the morning;  after that the people may go home. There are also,  nowadays, Local Option Hotels. These contain only one  entrance, leading directly into the bar.          An Experiment With Policeman Hogan    Mr. Scalper sits writing in the reporters' room of The  Daily Eclipse. The paper has gone to press and he is  alone; a wayward talented gentleman, this Mr. Scalper,  and employed by The Eclipse as a delineator of character  from handwriting. Any subscriber who forwards a specimen  of his handwriting is treated to a prompt analysis of  his character from Mr. Scalper's facile pen. The literary  genius has a little pile of correspondence beside him,  and is engaged in the practice of his art. Outside the  night is dark and rainy. The clock on the City Hall marks  the hour of two. In front of the newspaper office Policeman  Hogan walks drearily up and down his beat. The damp misery  of Hogan is intense. A belated gentleman in clerical  attire, returning home from a bed of sickness, gives him  a side-look of timid pity and shivers past. Hogan follows  the retreating figure with his eye; then draws forth a  notebook and sits down on the steps of The Eclipse building  to write in the light of the gas lamp. Gentlemen of  nocturnal habits have often wondered what it is that  Policeman Hogan and his brethren write in their little  books. Here are the words that are fashioned by the big  fist of the policeman:    \"Two o'clock. All is well. There is a light in Mr.  Scalper's room above. The night is very wet and I am  unhappy and cannot sleep--my fourth night of insomnia.  Suspicious-looking individual just passed. Alas, how  melancholy is my life! Will the dawn never break! Oh,  moist, moist stone.\"    Mr. Scalper up above is writing too, writing with the  careless fluency of a man who draws his pay by the column.  He is delineating with skill and rapidity. The reporters'  room is gloomy and desolate. Mr. Scalper is a man of  sensitive temperament and the dreariness of his surroundings  depresses him. He opens the letter of a correspondent,  examines the handwriting narrowly, casts his eye around  the room for inspiration, and proceeds to delineate:    \"G.H. You have an unhappy, despondent nature; your  circumstances oppress you, and your life is filled with  an infinite sadness. You feel that you are without hope--\"    Mr. Scalper pauses, takes another look around the room,  and finally lets his eye rest for some time upon a tall  black bottle that stands on the shelf of an open cupboard.  Then he goes on:    \"--and you have lost all belief in Christianity and a  future world and human virtue. You are very weak against  temptation, but there is an ugly vein of determination  in your character, when you make up your mind that you  are going to have a thing--\"    Here Mr. Scalper stops abruptly, pushes back his chair,  and dashes across the room to the cupboard. He takes the  black bottle from the shelf, applies it to his lips, and  remains for some time motionless. He then returns to  finish the delineation of G.H. with the hurried words:    \"On the whole I recommend you to persevere; you are doing  very well.\" Mr. Scalper's next proceeding is peculiar.  He takes from the cupboard a roll of twine, about fifty  feet in length, and attaches one end of it to the neck  of the bottle. Going then to one of the windows, he opens  it, leans out, and whistles softly. The alert ear of  Policeman Hogan on the pavement below catches the sound,  and he returns it. The bottle is lowered to the end of  the string, the guardian of the peace applies it to his  gullet, and for some time the policeman and the man of  letters remain attached by a cord of sympathy. Gentlemen  who lead the variegated life of Mr. Scalper find it well  to propitiate the arm of the law, and attachments of this  sort are not uncommon. Mr. Scalper hauls up the bottle,  closes the window, and returns to his task; the policeman  resumes his walk with a glow of internal satisfaction.  A glance at the City Hall clock causes him to enter  another note in his book.    \"Half-past two. All is better. The weather is milder with  a feeling of young summer in the air. Two lights in Mr.  Scalper's room. Nothing has occurred which need be brought  to the notice of the roundsman.\"    Things are going better upstairs too. The delineator  opens a second envelope, surveys the writing of the  correspondent with a critical yet charitable eye, and  writes with more complacency.    \"William H. Your writing shows a disposition which, though  naturally melancholy, is capable of a temporary  cheerfulness. You have known misfortune but have made up  your mind to look on the bright side of things. If you  will allow me to say so, you indulge in liquor but are  quite moderate in your use of it. Be assured that no harm  ever comes of this moderate use. It enlivens the intellect,  brightens the faculties, and stimulates the dormant fancy  into a pleasurable activity. It is only when carried to  excess--\"    At this point the feelings of Mr. Scalper, who had been  writing very rapidly, evidently become too much for him.  He starts up from his chair, rushes two or three times  around the room, and finally returns to finish the  delineation thus: \"it is only when carried to excess that  this moderation becomes pernicious.\"    Mr. Scalper succumbs to the train of thought suggested  and gives an illustration of how moderation to excess  may be avoided, after which he lowers the bottle to  Policeman Hogan with a cheery exchange of greetings.    The half-hours pass on. The delineator is writing busily  and feels that he is writing well. The characters of his  correspondents lie bare to his keen eye and flow from  his facile pen. From time to time he"]]]
