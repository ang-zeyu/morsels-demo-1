It came  down, down, in regular succession. Peter, James and John had it given  to them, and they gave it to others. Christ is the Great High Priest:  Adam next.\"--(Ibid, 386-388.)    Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery.--Peter, James and John--not as mortal  men, but as ministering angels, sent from heaven for the purpose--gave  the Melchizedek Priesthood to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery; and  prior to the coming of that Priesthood, they received the Aaronic  Priesthood from John the Baptist, also acting as an angel. The exact  date of the restoration of the Melchizedek Priesthood is not given in  the Church records, but the event must have taken place between May 15,  1829, when the Aaronic Priesthood was conferred upon Joseph and Oliver,  and April 6, 1830, the date of the Church's organization, when they  were sustained, respectively, as the First and Second Elders thereof.    Spirits Foreordained.--In view of the fact that these ordinations were  subsequent to the Prophet's vision, in the spring of 1820, when the  Father and the Son appeared to him, some have found it difficult to  interpret the divine declaration, that no man without the Melchizedek  Priesthood \"can see the face of God, even the Father, and live.\" (D&C  84:19-22.) But the problem is easy of solution, in the light of the  Prophet's teachings. Did he not give the key to it when he said that  certain men, called to minister to the inhabitants of this world, were  ordained to that very purpose before the world was? (Compendium, p.  285.) I have already cited the examples of Abraham and Jeremiah, who  were \"chosen\" and \"ordained\" before they were born. That Joseph Smith  was likewise preordained, seems to me a necessary inference, in view of  the facts presented. For if no man without the Melchizedek Priesthood  can see the face of God the Father and live, and Joseph Smith, nine  years before he received either of the Priesthoods from those heavenly  messengers, looked upon the faces of both the Father and the Son and  survived, it indicates, in accordance with his own statement and the  examples given, that certain spirits are ordained to certain callings  before they tabernacle in the flesh, and that he himself held the  Melchizedek Priesthood when he saw the face of God at the opening of  the last gospel dispensation.    An ordination in the flesh, after an ordination in the spirit, seems  perfectly consistent; for the body was not present when the spirit was  ordained, and it is the soul, spirit and body, that God is dealing  with and acting through, in this stage of existence. That supplemental  ordinations are sometimes in order, is evident from the fact that  Joseph and Oliver ordained each other, after they had been ordained by  the angel, or angels; and that, too, by divine commandment.--(\"Pearl of  Great Price,\"--\"Writings of Joseph Smith,\" 2:71.)    Natural and Spiritual Eyes.--There is another interpretation, which  holds that the necessity for the Melchizedek Priesthood, in the case of  those who look upon the countenance of Deity, applies only to such as  behold him with the natural eye, and that it has no reference to those  who see God by means of the spiritual vision. Joseph's experience, when  he beheld the Father and the Son, was probably a parallel to that of  Moses, when he saw God face to face, and testified as follows:    \"Mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual  eyes; for my natural eyes could not have beheld; for I should have  withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me, and I  beheld his face; for I was transfigured before him.\"--(Moses 1:11.)    That this was the way in which Joseph saw God, is virtually affirmed in  the following passage:    \"We, Joseph Smith, Jr., and Sidney Rigdon, being in the Spirit, * * *  by the power of the Spirit our eyes were opened, and our understandings  were enlightened, so as to see and understand the things of God * * *  whom we saw and with whom we conversed in the heavenly vision.\"--(D.  and C. 76:11, 12, 14.)    In other words, Joseph and Sidney saw God (Jesus Christ) with their  spiritual eyes (the eyes of their spirits), reinforced by the  all-revealing Spirit of God.    Qualifications for the Priesthood.--The qualifications required in  those whom the Lord ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood are thus  outlined in the Book of Mormon:    \"My brethren,\" [it is the Prophet Alma who is speaking]. \"I would that  ye should remember that the Lord God ordained priests, after his holy  order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto  the people.    \"And those priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in a  manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look  forward to his Son for redemption.    \"And this is the manner after which they were ordained: being called  and prepared from the foundation of the world, according to the  foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good  works: in the first place being left to choose good or evil: therefore  they having chosen good, and exercising exceeding great faith, are  called with a holy calling, * * * while others would reject the Spirit  of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of  their minds, while, if it had not been for this, they might had as  great privilege as their brethren.    * * * * * * * * * * *    \"Now they were ordained after this manner: Being called with a holy  calling, and ordained with a holy ordinance, and taking upon them the  High Priesthood of the holy order, which calling and ordinance and High  Priesthood is without beginning or end:    \"Thus they become High Priests for ever, after the order of the Son,  the Only Begotten of the Father. * * * *    \"Now as I said concerning the holy order of this High Priesthood:  there were many who were ordained and became High Priests of God: and  it was on account of their exceeding faith and repentance, and their  righteousness before God.\"--(Alma 13:1-10.)        CHAPTER III.    The Church Organization.    An Incomparable System.--The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints is conceded to be an almost perfect system, even by men  outside its pale. Such a one has said of it: \"It is the most perfect  organization in existence, except the German army.\" The eulogy involves  an anticlimax--as if one were to affirm: The sun is the brightest  luminary in the heavens--except the moon. The German army represents,  perhaps, the quintessence of human military wisdom: but like the moon,  it borrows its brilliance. The case is different with the Church  of God. Like the sun, it shines with original light, with divine  intelligence, of which it is the product. Between it and any creation  of man's, no comparison is possible.    A Counterpart of the Church in Heaven.--The Church of Christ on earth  is a counterpart, so far as conditions will permit, of the Church of  Christ in heaven. How it came hither was indicated by Joseph the Seer  while giving direction for the organization of the various councils  and quorums of the Priesthood. Thus: \"And it is according to the  vision, showing the order of the seventy, that they should have seven  presidents to preside over them.\"--(D. and C. 107:93.) Mark the words,  \"It is according to the vision.\" Evidently the Prophet organized the  Priesthood after some model that he had seen in vision: and what more  probable than that this model was the Church of the First Born, as  it exists in all its perfection in the celestial worlds? While the  Church on earth is not yet as perfect as it will one day be, it is  approximating toward that perfection, and is destined to attain it. It  is doubtful that the Church, in any former dispensation, had so perfect  an organization as it possesses at the present time. This admirable and  wonderful scheme of spiritual-temporal government was revealed from  above and established here below, that the will of God might be done on  earth even as it is done in heaven.    The Original Offices.--The original offices of the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints were elder, priest, teacher, and deacon;  all, except elder, callings in the Aaronic Priesthood. Other offices,  pertaining to the Priesthood of Melchizedek, were evolved as fast as  they became necessary. For instance, the first bishops were ordained  in 1831, nearly a year after the Church was organized. There was no  First Presidency until 1832, and no stake organization until 1834.  The twelve apostles were not chosen until 1835, nor the first quorums  of seventy. But all these offices and callings were inherent in the  Priesthood, conferred upon Joseph Smith before the Church had any  organization at all. They who find fault with the Church,--as some who  have left it do,--on the ground that the Lord organized it with elders,  priests, teachers and deacons, and that men have added such titles and  dignities as high priest, president, patriarch, etc., would be no more  inconsistent were they to criticize a human being for not remaining  a child, for growing up to manhood or womanhood and fulfiling their  measure of creation.    First Lesser, then Greater.--As already shown, the first priesthood  that came to earth in this dispensation was the Aaronic Priesthood,  conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, May 15, 1829. According  to the critical wiseacre, that should have ended the matter: there  should have been no further ordination, no organization of the Church,  no further development in the work of the Lord. But there was to be,  nevertheless. As in the case of John the Baptist, who ordained Joseph  and Oliver, it is the mission of the Lesser Priesthood to go before  the Greater, preparing the way. In due time came the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5061"],[0,"The Children's Book of Christmas Stories (#17)"],[1,"begged so hard that Papa Goldfinch soberly  said: 'Try it, my son, but do find a warm place to stay in at night.'  Then off they flew, and Thistle was alone. For a while he was happy. The  sun shone warm through the middle of the day, and there were fields and  meadows full of seeds. You all remember how sweetly he sang for us then.  But by and by the cold North Wind came whistling through the trees, and  chilly Thistle woke up one gray morning to find the air full of whirling  snowflakes He didn't mind the light snows, golden-rod and some high  grasses were too tall to be easily covered, and he got seeds from them.  But now that the heavy snows have come, the poor little fellow is almost  starved, and if he doesn't have a warm place to sleep in these cold  nights, he'll surely die!\"    Mrs. Chickadee paused a minute. The birds were so still one could hear  the pine trees whisper. Then she went on: \"I comforted the poor little  fellow as best I could, and showed him where to find a few seeds; then I  flew home, for it was bedtime. I tucked my head under my wing to keep it  warm, and thought, and thought, and thought; and here's my plan:    \"We Chickadees have a nice warm home here in the spruce trees, with  their thick, heavy boughs to shut out the snow and cold. There is plenty  of room, so Thistle could sleep here all winter. We would let him perch  on a branch, when we Chickadees would nestle around him until he was as  warm as in the lovely summer tine. These cones are so full of seeds that  we could spare him a good many; and I think that you Robins might  let him come over to your pines some day and share your seeds. Downy  Woodpecker must keep his eyes open as he hammers the trees, and if he  spies a supply of seeds he will let us know at once. Snow Bunting is  only a visitor, so I don't expect him to help, but I wanted him to hear  my plan with the rest of you. Now you WILL try, won't you, EVERY ONE?\"    \"Cheerup, cheerup, ter-ra-lee! Indeed we'll try; let's begin right away!  Don't wait until to-morrow; who'll go and find Thistle?\"    \"I will,\" chirped Robin Rusty-breast, and off he flew to the place which  Mrs. Chickadee had told of, at the other side of the wood. There, sure  enough, he found Thistle Goldfinch sighing: \"Dear-ie me! dear-ie me! The  winter is so cold and I'm here all alone!\" \"Cheerup, chee-chee!\" piped  the Robin:         \"Cheerup, cheerup, I'm here!       I'm here and I mean to stay.       What if the winter is drear--       Cheerup, cheerup, anyway!\"    \"But the snow is so deep,\" said Thistle, and the Robin replied:         \"Soon the snows'll be over and gone,       Run and rippled away;       What's the use of looking forlorn?       Cheerup, cheerup, I say!\"    Then he told Thistle all their plans, and wasn't Thistle surprised? Why,  he just couldn't believe a word of it till they reached Mrs. Chickadee's  and she said it was all true. They fed him and warmed him, then settled  themselves for a good night's rest.    Christmas morning they were chirping gaily, and Thistle was trying to  remember the happy song he sang in the summer time, when there came a  whirr of wings as Snow Bunting flew down.    \"Ter-ra-lee, ter-ra-lee, ter-ra-lee,\" said he, \"can you fly a little  way?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" replied Thistle. \"I THINK I could fly a LONG way.\"    \"Come on, then,\" said Snow Bunting. \"Every one who wants a Christmas  dinner, follow me!\" That was every word he would say, so what could they  do but follow?    Soon they came to the edge of the wood, and then to a farmhouse. Snow  Bunting flew straight up to the piazza, and there stood a dear little  girl in a warm hood and cloak, with a pail of bird-seed on her arm, and  a dish of bread crumbs in her hand. As they flew down, she said:    \"And here are some more birdies who have come for a Christmas dinner.  Of course you shall have some, you dear little things!\" and she laughed  merrily to see them dive for the crumbs.    After they had finished eating, Elsie (that was the little girl's name)  said: \"Now, little birds, it is going to be a cold winter, you would  better come here every day to get your dinner. I'll always be glad to  see you.\"    \"Cheerup chee-chee, cheerup chee-chee! thank you, thank you,\" cried  the Robins. \"Ter-ra-lee, ter-ra-lee, ter-ra-lee! thank you, thank you!\"  twittered Snow Bunting.    \"Chick-a-dee-dee-dee-dee, chick-a-dee-dee-dee-dee,  chick-a-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee! how kind you are!\" sang the Chickadees.    And Thistle Goldfinch? Yes, he remembered his summer song, for he sang  as they flew away:    \"Swee-e-et-sweet-sweet-sweet-a-twitter-witter-witter-witter--wee-twea!\"    notes.--l. The Robin's song is from \"Bird Talks,\" by Mrs. A.D.T.  Whitney. 2. The fact upon which this story is based--that is of the  other birds adopting and warming the solitary Thistle Goldfinch--was  observed near Northampton, Mass., where robins and other migratory birds  sometimes spend the winter in the thick pine woods.          XIV. THE LITTLE SISTER'S VACATION*    * This story was first published in the Youth's Companion, vol. 77.    WINIFRED M. KIRKLAND    It was to be a glorious Christmas at Doctor Brower's. All \"the  children\"--little Peggy and her mother always spoke of the grown-up ones  as \"the children\"--were coming home. Mabel was coming from Ohio with  her big husband and her two babies, Minna and little Robin, the year-old  grandson whom the home family had never seen; Hazen was coming all the  way from the Johns Hopkins Medical School, and Arna was coming home from  her teaching in New York. It was a trial to Peggy that vacation did not  begin until the very day before Christmas, and then continued only one  niggardly week. After school hours she had helped her mother in the  Christmas preparations every day until she crept into bed at night with  aching arms and tired feet, to lie there tossing about, whether from  weariness or glad excitement she did not know.    \"Not so hard, daughter,\" the doctor said to her once.    \"Oh, papa,\" protested her mother, \"when we're so busy, and Peggy is so  handy!\"    \"Not so hard,\" he repeated, with his eyes on fifteen-year-old Peggy's  delicate face, as, wearing her braids pinned up on her head and a  pinafore down to her toes, she stoned raisins and blanched almonds,  rolled bread crumbs and beat eggs, dusted and polished and made ready  for the children.    Finally, after a day of flying about, helping with the many last thing,  Peggy let down her braids and put on her new crimson shirtwaist, and  stood with her mother in the front doorway, for it was Christmas Eve at  last, and the station 'bus was rattling up with the first homecomers,  Arna and Hazen.    Then there were voices ringing up and down the dark street, and there  were happy tears in the mother's eyes, and Arna had taken Peggy's face  in her two soft-gloved hands and lifted it up and kissed it, and Hazen  had swung his little sister up in the air just as of old. Peggy's tired  feet were dancing for joy. She was helping Arna take off her things, was  carrying her bag upstairs--would have carried Hazen's heavy grip, too,  only her father took it from her.    \"Set the kettle to boil, Peggy,\" directed her mother; \"then run upstairs  and see if Arna wants anything. We'll wait supper till the rest come.\"    The rest came on the nine o'clock train, such a load of them--the big,  bluff brother-in-law, Mabel, plump and laughing, as always, Minna, elfin  and bright-eyed, and sleepy Baby Robin. Such hugging, such a hubbub of  baby talk! How many things there seemed to be to do for those precious  babies right away!    Peggy was here and there and everywhere. Everything was in joyous  confusion. Supper was to be set on, too. While the rest ate, Peggy sat  by, holding Robin, her own little nephew, and managing at the same  time to pick up the things--napkin, knife, spoon, bread--that Minna,  hilarious with the late hour, flung from her high chair.    It seemed as if they would never be all stowed away for the night. Some  of them wanted pitchers of warm water, some of them pitchers of cold,  and the alcohol stove must be brought up for heating the baby's milk at  night. The house was crowded, too. Peggy had given up her room to Hazen,  and slept on a cot in the sewing room with Minna.    The cot had been enlarged by having three chairs piled with pillows, set  along the side. But Minna preferred to sleep in the middle of the cot,  or else across it, her restless little feet pounding at Peggy's ribs;  and Peggy was unused to any bedfellow.    She lay long awake thinking proudly of the children; of Hazen, the  tall brother, with his twinkling eyes, his drolleries, his teasing; of  graceful Arna who dressed so daintily, talked so cleverly, and had been  to college. Arna was going to send Peggy to college, too--it was so  good of Arna! But for all Peggy's admiration for Arna, it was Mabel, the  eldest sister, who was the more approachable. Mabel did not pretend even  to as much learning as Peggy had herself; she was happy-go-lucky and  sweet-tempered. Then her husband was a great jolly fellow, with whom it  was impossible to be shy, and the babies--there never were such cunning  babies, Peggy thought. Just here her niece gave her a particularly  vicious kick, and Peggy opposed to her train of admiring thoughts, \"But  I'm so tired.\"    It did not seem to Peggy that she had been asleep at all when she was  waked with a vigorous pounding on her chest and a shrill little voice in  her ear:    \"Ch'is'mus, Ch'is'mus, Ch'is'mus! It's mornin'! It's Ch'is'mus!\"    \"Oh, no, it isn't, Minna!\" pleaded Peggy, struggling with sleepiness.  \"It's all dark still.\"    \"Ch'is'mus, Ch'is'mus, Ch'is'mus!\" reiterated Minna continuing to pound.    \"Hush, dear! You'll wake Aunt Arna, and she's feed after being all day  on the chou-chou cars.\"    \"Merry Ch'is'mus, Aunty Arna!\" shouted the irrepressible Minna.    \"Oh, darling, be quiet! We'll play little pig goes"]]]
