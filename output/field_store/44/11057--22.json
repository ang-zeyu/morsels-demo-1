ABADESA: A propósito.                   Of course.    DON GONZALO: Escuchad.                  Listen, closely!  Se me acaba de decir                    I have only now been  que han visto a su dueña ir             told her Duenna was seen  ha poco por la ciudad                   walking through the city  hablando con el criado                  talking with the servant  de un don Juan, de tal renombre         of a certain Don Juan, he of such fame  que no hay en la tierra otro hombre     there's no man on earth I could name.  tan audaz ni tan malvado.               as audacious or as errant.  En tiempo atrás se pensó                Some time ago I intended, you see,  con él a mi hija casar,                 to have him marry my daughter,  y hoy, que se la fui a negar,           and today, when I forbade him to                                          court her,  robármela me juró.                      he swore he'd steal her from me.  Que por el torpe doncel                 This young man of sin  ganada la dueña está                    has won over her Duenna, I'm sure,  no puedo dudarlo ya:                    I can doubt it no more:  debo, pues, guardarme de él.            I must guard her from him.  Y un día, una hora quizás               In just one day that man,  de imprevisión le bastara,              a careless hour would do it,  para que mi honor manchara,             would steal my honour, or stain it,  a ese hijo de Satanás.                  that very son of Satan.

DON GONZALO:  No sabéis quién es don Juan.            You do not know who Don Juan is.    ABADESA: Aunque le pintáis tan          Though you paint him as an evil  malo,                                   case,  yo os puedo decir de mí,                I say to you, have no fear,  que mientra Inés esté aquí,             for while Inés is here,  segura está, Don Gonzalo.               Don Gonzalo, she is safe.    DON GONZALO:  Lo creo; mas las razones                I believe it, but lets choose  abreviemos; entregadme                  to end this speech: hand over "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5210"],[0,"The Borough (#17)"],[1," and to numbers run,  Themselves to strengthen, or themselves to shun;  But though to this our weakness may be prone,  Let's learn to live, for we must die, alone.        LETTER XI.        All the comforts of life in a Tavern are known,  'Tis his home who possesses not one of his own;  And to him who has rather too much of that one,  'Tis the house of a friend where he's welcome to run;  The instant you enter my door you're my Lord,  With whose taste and whose pleasure I'm proud to accord,  And the louder you call, and the longer you stay,  The more I am happy to serve and obey.    To the house of a friend if you're pleased to retire,  You must all things admit, you must all tilings admire;  You must pay with observance the price of your treat,  You must eat what is praised, and must praise what you eat,  But here you may come, and no tax we require,  You may loudly condemn what you greatly admire;  You may growl at our wishes and pains to excel,  And may snarl at the rascals who please you so well.    At your wish we attend, and confess that your speech  On the nation's affairs might the minister teach;  His views you may blame, and his measures oppose,  There's no Tavern-treason--you're under the Rose;  Should rebellions arise in your own little state,  With me you may safely their consequence wait;  To recruit your lost spirits 'tis prudent to come,  And to fly to a friend when the devil's at home.    That I've faults is confess'd; but it won't be denied,  'Tis my interest the faults of my neighbours to hide;  If I've sometimes lent Scandal occasion to prate,  I've often conceal'd what she lov'd to relate;  If to Justice's bar some have wander'd from mine,  'Twas because the dull rogues wouldn't stay by their wine;  And for brawls at my house, well the poet explains,  That men drink shallow draughts, and so madden their brains.                     ------------------------    INNS.    A difficult Subject for Poetry--Invocation of the Muse--Description  of the principal Inn and those of the first Class--The large  deserted Tavern--Those of a second Order--Their Company--One of  particular Description--A lower kind of Public-Houses; yet  distingushed among themselves--Houses on the Quays for Sailors--The  Green Man; its Landlord, and the Adventure of his Marriage, &c.    MUCH do I need, and therefore will I ask,  A Muse to aid me in my present task;  For then with special cause we beg for aid,  When of our subject we are most afraid:  INNS are this subject--'tis an ill-drawn lot,  So, thou who gravely triflest, fail me not;  Fail not, but haste, and to my memory bring  Scenes yet unsung, which few would choose to sing;  Thou mad'st a Shilling splendid; thou hast thrown  On humble themes the graces all thine own;  By thee the Mistress of a Village-school  Became a queen enthroned upon her stool;  And far beyond the rest thou gav'st to shine  Belinda's Lock--that deathless work was thine.     Come, lend thy cheerful light, and give to please,  These seats of revelry, these scenes of ease;  Who sings of Inns much danger has to dread,  And needs assistance from the fountain-head.     High in the street, o'erlooking all the place,  The rampant Lion shows his kingly face;  His ample jaws extend from side to side,  His eyes are glaring, and his nostrils wide;  In silver shag the sovereign form is dress'd,  A mane horrific sweeps his ample chest;  Elate with pride, he seems t'assert his reign,  And stands the glory of his wide domain.     Yet nothing dreadful to his friends the sight,  But sign and pledge of welcome and delight.  To him the noblest guest the town detains  Flies for repast, and in his court remains;  Him too the crowd with longing looks admire,  Sigh for his joys, and modestly retire;  Here not a comfort shall to them be lost  Who never ask or never feel the cost.     The ample yards on either side contain  Buildings where order and distinction reign; -  The splendid carriage of the wealthier guest,  The ready chaise and driver smartly dress'd;  Whiskeys and gigs and curricles are there,  And high-fed prancers many a raw-boned pair.  On all without a lordly host sustains  The care of empire, and observant reigns;  The parting guest beholds him at his side,  With pomp obsequious, bending in his pride;  Round all the place his eyes all objects meet,  Attentive, silent, civil, and discreet.  O'er all within the lady-hostess rules,  Her bar she governs, and her kitchen schools;  To every guest th' appropriate speech is made,  And every duty with distinction paid;  Respectful, easy, pleasant, or polite -  \"Your honour's servant\"--\"Mister Smith, good night.\"     Next, but not near, yet honour'd through the town,  There swing, incongruous pair! the Bear and Crown:  That Crown suspended gems and ribands deck,  A golden chain hangs o'er that furry neck:  Unlike the nobler beast, the Bear is bound,  And with the Crown so near him, scowls uncrown'd;  Less his dominion, but alert are all  Without, within, and ready for the call;  Smart lads and light run nimbly here and there,  Nor for neglected duties mourns the Bear.     To his retreats, on the Election-day,  The losing party found their silent way;  There they partook of each consoling good,  Like him uncrown'd, like him in sullen mood -  Threat'ning, but bound.--Here meet a social kind,  Our various clubs for various cause combined;  Nor has he pride, but thankful takes as gain  The dew-drops shaken from the Lion's mane:  A thriving couple here their skill display,  And share the profits of no vulgar sway.     Third in our Borough's list appears the sign  Of a fair queen--the gracious Caroline;  But in decay--each feature in the face  Has stain of Time, and token of disgrace.  The storm of winter, and the summer-sun,  Have on that form their equal mischief done;  The features now are all disfigured seen,  And not one charm adorns th' insulted queen.  To this poor face was never paint applied,  Th' unseemly work of cruel Time to hide;  Here we may rightly such neglect upbraid,  Paint on such faces is by prudence laid.  Large the domain, but all within combine  To correspond with the dishonoured sign;  And all around dilapidates; you call -  But none replies--they're inattentive all:  At length a ruin'd stable holds your steed,  While you through large and dirty rooms proceed,  Spacious and cold; a proof they once had been  In honour,--now magnificently mean;  Till in some small half-furnish'd room you rest,  Whose dying fire denotes it had a guest.  In those you pass'd, where former splendour reign'd,  You saw the carpets torn, the paper stain'd;  Squares of discordant glass in windows fix'd,  And paper oil'd in many a space betwixt;  A soil'd and broken sconce, a mirror crack'd,  With table underpropp'd, and chairs new back'd;  A marble side-slab with ten thousand stains,  And all an ancient Tavern's poor remains.     With much entreaty, they your food prepare,  And acid wine afford, with meagre fare;  Heartless you sup; and when a dozen times  You've read the fractured window's senseless rhymes,  Have been assured that Phoebe Green was fair,  And Peter Jackson took his supper there;  You reach a chilling chamber, where you dread  Damps, hot or cold, from a tremendous bed;  Late comes your sleep, and you are waken'd soon  By rustling tatters of the old festoon.     O'er this large building, thus by time defaced,  A servile couple has its owner placed,  Who not unmindful that its style is large,  To lost magnificence adapt their charge:  Thus an old beauty, who has long declined,  Keeps former dues and dignity in mind;  And wills that all attention should be paid  For graces vanish'd and for charms decay'd.     Few years have pass'd, since brightly 'cross the way,  Lights from each window shot the lengthen'd ray,  And busy looks in every face were seen,  Through the warm precincts of the reigning Queen;  There fires inviting blazed, and all around  Was heard the tinkling bells' seducing sound;  The nimble waiters to that sound from far  Sprang to the call, then hasteri'd to the bar,  Where a glad priestess of the temple sway'd,  The most obedient, and the most obey'd;  Rosy and round, adorn'd in crimson vest,  And flaming ribands at her ample breast:  She, skill'd like Circe, tried her guests to move,  With looks of welcome and with words of love;  And such her potent charms, that men unwise  Were soon transform'd and fitted for the sties.     Her port in bottles stood, a well-stain'd row,  Drawn for the evening from the pipe below;  Three powerful spirits filled a parted case,  Some cordial bottles stood in secret place;  Fair acid-fruits in nets above were seen,  Her plate was splendid, and her glasses clean;  Basins and bowls were ready on the stand,  And measures clatter'd in her powerful hand.     Inferior Houses now our notice claim,  But who shall deal them their appropriate fame?  Who shall the nice, yet known distinction, tell,  Between the peal complete and single Bell?     Determine ye, who on your shining nags  Wear oil-skin beavers, and bear seal-skin bags;  Or ye, grave topers, who with coy delight  Snugly enjoy the sweetness of the night;  Ye travellers all, superior Inns denied  By moderate purse, the low by decent pride;  Come and determine,--will you take your place  At the full Orb, or half the lunar Face?  With the Black-Boy or Angel will ye dine?  Will ye approve the Fountain or the Vine?  Horses the white or black will ye prefer?  The Silver-Swan or Swan opposed to her -  Rare bird! whose form the raven-plumage decks,  And graceful curve her three alluring necks?  All these a decent entertainment give,  And by their comforts comfortably live.     Shall I pass by the Boar?--there are who cry,  \"Beware the Boar,\" and pass determined by:  Those dreadful tusks, those little peering eyes  And churning chaps, are tokens to the wise.  There dwells a kind old Aunt, and there you see  Some kind young Nieces in her company;  Poor village nieces,"]]]
