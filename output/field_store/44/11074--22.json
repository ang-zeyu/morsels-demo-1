Move the sponge more slowly; there, that is better.\"    Polly shifted her position from one aching knee to another, set her  lips closer together, and bent all her young energies to gentler  effects. But Mrs. Chatterton cried out irritably:    \"Have you never taken care of a sick person, pray tell, or is it all  your back-country training that makes you so heavy-handed?\"    \"I helped mother take care of Phronsie when she had the measles, and  Ben and Joel,\" said Polly, \"five years ago; we haven't been sick  lately.\"    \"Humph!\" ejaculated Mrs. Chatterton, not very elegantly. But what was  the use of a fine manner when there was nobody but a little  back-country maiden to see it?    \"I shall have to endure it till Hortense returns,\" she said with a  sigh; \"besides, it is my duty to give you something useful to do in  this house. You should be thankful that I allow you to bathe me.\"    Polly's eyes flashed, and the hand holding the sponge trembled. Nothing  but the fear of troubling Mamsie, and dear old Mr. King whose  forbearance was worn to the finest of threads, kept her at her post.    \"Now get the violet water,\" said Mrs. Chatterton, with an air she would  never have dared employ towards Hortense; \"it is the bottle in the  lower left-hand corner of the case.\"    Polly got up from her knees, and stiffly stumbled across the room to  the case of silver-mounted toilet articles: in her tumult bringing away  the upper right-hand corner vial.    \"Stupide!\" exclaimed Mrs. Chatterton among her pillows. \"Go back, and  do as I bid you, girl; the lower left-hand corner bottle!\"    Without a word Polly returned, and bringing the right vial set about  its use as directed, in a rapidly growing dismay at the evil feelings  surging through her, warning her it would not be safe to stay in the  room much longer.    \"Do you understand,\" presently began Mrs. Chatterton, fastening her  cold blue eyes upon her, \"what your position is in this house?  Everybody else appears to be blind and idiotic to the last degree; you  seem to have a little quickness to catch an idea.\"    As Polly did not answer, the question was repeated very sharply: \"Do  you understand what your position is in this house?\"    \"Yes,\" said Polly, in a low voice, and dashing out the violet water  with a reckless hand, \"I do.\"    \"Take care,\" impatiently cried Mrs. Chatterton. Then she pushed her  pillow into a better position, and returned to the charge.    \"What is it, pray, since you understand it so well?\"    \"I understand that I am here in this house,\" said Polly, quite cold and  white, \"because dear Mr. King wants me to be here.\"    \"DEAR Mr. King!\" echoed Mrs. Chatterton, in shrill disdain. \"Stuff and  nonsense,\" and she put her head back for an unpleasant cackle; it could  hardly be called a laugh. \"What an idiot the man is to have the wool  pulled over his eyes in this fashion. I'll tell you, Polly\"--and she  raised herself up on her elbow, the soft lace falling away from the  white, and yet shapely arm. This member had been one of her strongest  claims to beauty, and even in her rage, Mrs. Chatterton paused a second  to glance complacently at it in its new position--\"you are, when all is  said about your dear Mr. King, and your absurd assumption of equality  with refined people who frequent this house, exactly the same underbred  country girl as you were in your old brown house, goodness knows  wherever that is.\"    \"I'm glad I am,\" declared Polly. And she actually laughed merrily,  while she squared her sturdy shoulders. Nothing could be sweeter than  to hear it said she was worthy of the dear little old brown house, and  didn't disgrace Mamsie's bringing up.    The laugh was the last feather that overthrew Mrs. Chatterton's  restraint. She was actually furious now that she, widow of Algernon  Chatterton, who was own cousin to Jasper Horatio King, should be faced  by such presumption, and her words put aside with girlish amusement.    \"And I'll tell you more,\" she went on, sitting quite erect now on the  bed, \"your mother thinks she is doing a fine thing to get all her  family wormed in here in this style, but she'll\"--    Polly Pepper, the girlish gladness gone from heart and face, waited for  no more. \"OUR MOTHER!\" she cried stormily, unable to utter another  word--\"oh--oh!\" Her breath came in quick, short gasps, the hot  indignant blood mounting to the brown waves of hair on her brow, while  she clasped her hands so tightly together, the pain at any other time  would have made her scream.    Mrs. Chatterton, aghast at the effect of her words, leaned back once  more against her pillows. \"Don't try to work up a scene,\" she  endeavored to say carelessly. But she might as well have remonstrated  with the north wind. The little country maiden had a temper as well as  her own, and all the more for its long restraint, now on breaking  bounds, it rushed at the one who had provoked it, utterly regardless  that it was the great Mrs. Algernon Chatterton.    For two minutes, so breathlessly did Polly hurl the stinging sentences  at the figure on the bed, Cousin Eunice was obliged to let her have her  own way. Then as suddenly, the torrent ceased. Polly grew quite white.  \"What have I done--oh! what have I done?\" she cried, and rushed out of  the room.    \"Polly--Polly!\" called Jasper's voice below. She knew he wanted her to  try a new duet he had gone down town to purchase; but how could she  play with such a storm in her heart? and, worse than all else, was the  consciousness that she had spoken to one whose gray hairs should have  made her forget the provocation received, words that now plunged her  into a hot shame to recall.    She flew over the stairs--up, away from every one's sight, to a long,  dark lumber room, partially filled with trunks, and a few articles of  furniture, prized as heirlooms, but no longer admissible in the family  apartments. Polly closed the door behind her, and sank down in the  shadow of a packing box half filled with old pictures, in a distress  that would not even let her think. She covered her face with her hands,  too angry with herself to cry; too aghast at the mischief she had done,  to even remember the dreadful words Mrs. Chatterton had said to her.    \"For of course, now she will complain to Mamsie, and I'm really afraid  Mr. King will find it out; and it only needs a little thing to make him  send her off. He said yesterday Dr. Valentine told him there was  nothing really the matter with her--and--dear! I don't know what will  happen.\"    To poor Polly, crouching there on the floor in the dim and dusty  corner, it seemed as if her wretchedness held no hope. Turn whichever  way she might, the dreadful words she had uttered rang through her  heart. They could not be unsaid; they were never to be forgotten but  must always stay and rankle there.    \"Oh--oh!\" she moaned, clasping her knees with distressed little palms,  and swaying back and forth, \"why didn't I remember what Mamsie has  always told us--that no insult can do us harm if only we do not say or  do anything in return. Why--why couldn't I have remembered it?\"    How long she stayed there she never knew. But at last, realizing that  every moment there was only making matters worse, she dragged herself  up from the little heap on the floor, and trying to put a bit of  cheerfulness into a face she knew must frighten Mamsie, she went slowly  out, and down the stairs.    But no one looked long enough at her face to notice its change of  expression. Polly, the moment she turned towards the household life  again, could feel that the air was charged with some intense  excitement. Hortense met her on the lower stairs; the maid was startled  out of her usual nonchalance, and was actually in a hurry.    \"What is the matter?\" cried Polly.    \"Oh! the Madame is eel,\" said the maid; \"the doctaire says it is not a  lie dees time,\" and she swept past Polly.    Polly clung to the stair-railing, her face whitening, and her gaze  fastened upon Mrs. Chatterton's door, where Hortense was now  disappearing. Inside, was a sound of voices, and that subdued stir that  gives token of a sick room.    \"I have killed her!\" cried Polly's heart. For one wild moment she was  impelled to flight; anywhere, she did not care where, to shake off by  motion in the free air this paralysis of fear. But the next she started  and, rushing down the stairs and into Mr. King's room, cried out, \"Oh!  dear Grandpapa, will Mrs. Chatterton die?\"    \"No, no, I think not,\" replied the old gentleman, surprised at her  feeling. \"Cousin Eunice never did show much self-control; but then, I  don't believe this piece of bad news will kill her.\"    \"Bad news?\" gasped Polly, hanging to the table where Mr. King was  writing letters. \"Oh, Grandpapa! what do you mean?\"    \"Bless me! where have you been, Polly Pepper,\" said Mr. King, settling  his eyeglass to regard her closely, \"not to hear the uproar in this  house? Yes, Mrs. Chatterton received a telegram a half-hour since that  her nephew, the only one that she was very fond of among her relatives,  was drowned at sea, and she has been perfectly prostrated by it, till  she really is quite ill.\"    Polly waited to hear no more, but on the wings of the wind, flew out  and up the stairs once more.    \"Where have you been, Polly?\" cried Jasper, coming out of a side  passage in time to catch a dissolving view of her flying figure.  \"Polly--Polly!\" and he took three steps to her one, and gained her side.    \"Oh! don't stop me,\" begged Polly, flying on, \"don't, Jasper.\"    He took a good look at her face. \"Anything I can help you about?\" he  asked quickly.    She suddenly stopped, her foot on the stair above. \"Oh, Jasper!\" she  cried, with clasped hands, \"you don't know--she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5637"],[0,"Literary and Philosophical Essays: French, German and Italian (#17)"],[1,"and lice. And  that other man, whom Plutarke would have perswaded to agree with his  brother, answered, \"I care not a straw the more for him, though he  came out of the same wombe I did.\" Verily the name of Brother is a  glorious name, and full of loving kindnesse, and therefore did he  and I terme one another sworne brother: but this commixture,  dividence, and sharing of goods, this joyning wealth to wealth, and  that the riches of one shall be the povertie of another, doth  exceedingly distemper and distract all brotherly alliance, and  lovely conjunction: If brothers should conduct the progresse of  their advancement and thrift in one same path and course, they must  necessarily oftentimes hinder and crosse one another. Moreover, the  correspondencie and relation that begetteth these true and mutually  perfect amities, why shall it be found in these? The father and the  sonne may very well be of a farre differing complexion, and so many  brothers: He is my sonne, he is my kinsman; but he may be a foole, a  bad, or a peevish-minded man. And then according as they are  friendships which the law and dutie of nature doth command us, so  much the lesse of our owne voluntarie choice and libertie is there  required unto it: And our genuine libertie hath no production more  properly her owne, than that of affection and amitie. Sure I am,  that concerning the same I have assaied all that might be, having  had the best and most indulgent father that ever was, even to his  extremest age, and who from father to sonne was descended of a  famous house, and touching this rare-seene vertue of brotherly  concord very exemplare:           ----et ipse       Notus in fratres animi paterni.       [Footnote: Hor. 1. ii. Qd. li. 6.]         To his brothers knowne so kinde.       As to beare a fathers minde.    To compare the affection toward women unto it, although it proceed  from our owne free choice, a man cannot, nor may it be placed in  this ranke: Her fire, I confesse it to be more         (---neque enim est dea nescia nostri       Quae dulcem curis miscet amaritiem.)       [Footnote: Catul. Epig. lxvi.]         (Nor is that Goddesse ignorant of me,       Whose bitter-sweets with my cares mixed be.)    active, more fervent, and more sharpe. But it is a rash and wavering  fire, waving and divers: the fire of an ague subject to fits and  stints, and that hath but slender hold-fast of us. In true  friendship, it is a generall and universall heat, and equally  tempered, a constant and setled heat, all pleasure and smoothnes,  that hath no pricking or stinging in it, which the more it is in  lustfull love, the more is it but a raging and mad desire in  following that which flies us,         Come segue la lepre il cacciatore       Alfreddo, al caldo, alia montagna, a lito,       Ne pin l'estima poi che presa vede,       E sol dietro a chi fugge affretta il piede.       [Footnote: Ariost. can. x. st. 7.]         Ev'n as the huntsman doth the hare pursue,       In cold, in heat, on mountaines, on the shore,       But cares no more, when he her ta'en espies       Speeding his pace only at that which flies.    As soone as it creepeth into the termes of friendship, that is to  say, in the agreement of wits, it languisheth and vanisheth away:  enjoying doth lose it, as having a corporall end, and subject to  satietie. On the other side, friendship is enjoyed according as it  is desired, it is neither bred, nourished, nor increaseth but in  jovissance, as being spirituall, and the minde being refined by use  custome. Under this chiefe amitie, these fading affections have  sometimes found place in me, lest I should speake of him, who in his  verses speakes but too much of it. So are these two passions entered  into me in knowledge one of another, but in comparison never: the  first flying a high, and keeping a proud pitch, disdainfully  beholding the other to passe her points farre under it. Concerning  marriage, besides that it is a covenant which hath nothing free but  the entrance, the continuance being forced and constrained,  depending else-where than from our will, and a match ordinarily  concluded to other ends: A thousand strange knots are therein  commonly to be unknit, able to break the web, and trouble the whole  course of a lively affection; whereas in friendship there is no  commerce or busines depending on the same, but it selfe. Seeing (to  speake truly) that the ordinary sufficiency of women cannot answer  this conference and communication, the nurse of this sacred bond:  nor seeme their mindes strong enough to endure the pulling of a knot  so hard, so fast, and durable. And truly, if without that, such a  genuine and voluntarie acquaintance might be contracted, where not  only mindes had this entire jovissance, [Footnote: Enjoyment.] but  also bodies, a share of the alliance, and where a man might wholly  be engaged: It is certaine, that friendship would thereby be more  compleat and full: But this sex could never yet by any example  attaine unto it, and is by ancient schooles rejected thence. And  this other Greeke licence is justly abhorred by our customes, which  notwithstanding, because according to use it had so necessarie a  disparitie of ages, and difference of offices betweene lovers, did  no more sufficiently answer the perfect union and agreement, which  here we require: Quis est enim iste amor amicitiae? cur neque  deformem adolescentem quisquam amat, neque formosum senem?  [Footnote: Cic. Tusc. Qu. lv. c. 33.] \"For, what love is this of  friendship? why doth no man love either a deformed young man, or a  beautifull old man?\" For even the picture the Academic makes of it,  will not (as I suppose) disavowe mee, to say thus in her behalfe:  That the first furie, enspired by the son of Venus in the lovers  hart, upon the object of tender youths-flower, to which they allow  all insolent and passionate violences, an immoderate heat may  produce, was simply grounded upon an externall beauty; a false image  of corporall generation: for in the spirit it had no power, the  sight whereof was yet concealed, which was but in his infancie, and  before the age of budding. For, if this furie did seize upon a base  minded courage, the meanes of its pursuit were riches, gifts, favour  to the advancement of dignities, and such like vile merchandice,  which they reprove. If it fell into a more generous minde, the  interpositions [Footnote: Means of approach.] were likewise  generous: Philosophicall instructions, documents [Footnote:  Teachings.] to reverence religion, to obey the lawes, to die for the  good of his countrie: examples of valor, wisdome and justice; the  lover endevoring and studying to make himselfe acceptable by the  good grace and beauty of his minde (that of his body being long  since decayed) hoping by this mentall society to establish a more  firme and permanent bargaine. When this pursuit attained the effect  in due season (for by not requiring in a lover, he should bring  leasure and discretion in his enterprise, they require it exactly in  the beloved; forasmuch as he was to judge of an internall beauty, of  difficile knowledge, and abstruse discovery) then by the  interposition of a spiritual beauty was the desire of a spiritual  conception engendred in the beloved. The latter was here chiefest;  the corporall, accidentall and second, altogether contrarie to the  lover. And therefore doe they preferre the beloved, and verifie that  the gods likewise preferre the same: and greatly blame the Poet  AEschylus, who in the love betweene Achilles and Patroclus ascribeth  the lovers part unto Achilles, who was in the first and beardlesse  youth of his adolescency, and the fairest of the Graecians. After  this general communitie, the mistris and worthiest part of it,  predominant and exercising her offices (they say the most availefull  commodity did thereby redound both to the private and publike). That  it was the force of countries received the use of it, and the  principall defence of equitie and libertie: witnesse the comfortable  loves of Hermodius and Aristogiton. Therefore name they it sacred  and divine, and it concerns not them whether the violence of  tyrants, or the demisnesse of the people be against them: To  conclude, all that can be alleged in favour of the Academy, is to  say, that it was a love ending in friendship, a thing which hath no  bad reference unto the Stoical definition of love: Amorem conatum  esse amicitiae faciendae ex pulchritudinis specie: [Footnote: Cic.  Tusc. Qu. ir. c. 34. ] \"That love is an endevour of making  friendship, by the shew of beautie.\" I returne to my description in  a more equitable and equall manner. Omnino amicitiae, corroboratis  jam confirmatisque ingeniis et aetatibus, judicandae sunt.  [Footnote: Cic. Amic.] \"Clearely friendships are to be judged by  wits, and ages already strengthened and confirmed.\" As for the rest,  those we ordinarily call friendes and amities, are but acquaintances  and familiarities, tied together by some occasion or commodities, by  meanes whereof our mindes are entertained. In the amitie I speake  of, they entermixe and confound themselves one in the other, with so  universall a commixture, that they weare out and can no more finde  the seame that hath conjoined them together. If a man urge me to  tell wherefore I loved him, I feele it cannot be expressed, but by  answering; Because it was he, because it was my selfe. There is  beyond all my discourse, and besides what I can particularly report  of it, I know not what inexplicable and fatall power, a meane and  Mediatrix of this indissoluble union. We sought one another before  we had scene one another, and by the reports we heard one of  another; which wrought a greater violence in us, than the reason of  reports may well beare; I thinke by some secret ordinance of the  heavens, we embraced one another by our names. And at our first  meeting, which was by chance at a great"]]]
