For our trembling sister        Humbly we beg    That thy first wild rage be calmed.    WOTAN      Weak-hearted    And womanish brood!    Is this your valour,    Given by me?    For this have I reared you    Bold for the fight,    Made you relentless    And hard of heart    That ye wild ones might weep and whine    When my wrath on a faithless one falls?        Learn, wretched whimperers,        What was the crime        Of her for whom        Ye are shedding those tears.        No one but she    Knew what most deeply I brooded;        No one but she    Pierced to the source of my being;        Through her deeds    All, I wished to be, came to birth.        This sacred bond        So completely she broke        That she defied me,        Opposing my will,        Her master's command        Openly mocked,    And against me pointed the spear    That she held from me alone.

Through my will only        Wert thou at all,    Yet against my will thou hast worked;        Thy part it was        To fulfil my commands,    Yet against me thou hast commanded;        Wish-maid        Thou wert to me,    Yet thy wish has dared to cross mine;        Shield-maid        Thou wert to me,    Yet against me raised was thy shield;        Lot-chooser        Thou wert to me:    Against me the lot thou hast chosen;        Hero-rouser        Thou wert to me:    Thou hast roused up heroes against me.        What once thou wert        Wotan has told thee:        What thou art now,        Demand of thyself!

Among heaven's hosts        Numbered no longer,        Outcast art thou        From the kinship of Gods;    Our bond is broken in twain,    And from my sight henceforth thou now          art banned.

BRÜNNHILDE          All that thou gavest        Thou dost recall?    WOTAN      Conquering thee, one shall take all!        For here on the rock        Bound thou shalt be,        Defenceless in sleep,        Charmed and enchained;    The man who chances this way    And awakes her, shall master the maid.    THE VALKYRIES            [_Come down from the height in great excitement,          and in terrified groups surround Brünnhilde, who          lies half kneeling before Wotan._          O stay, Father!        The sentence recall.        Shall the maiden droop        And be withered by man?        O dread one, avert thou        The crying disgrace:    For as sisters share we her shame.    WOTAN           Have ye not heard         Wotan's decree?         From out your band     Shall your traitorous sister be banished,         No more to ride     Through the clouds her swift steed to the           battle;         Her maidenhood's flower         Will fade away;         Her grace and her favour         Her husband's will be;         Her husband will rule her         And she will obey;     Beside the hearth she will spin,     To all mockers a mark for scorn.
