His old friend, General Marbeuf, was no longer in condition to  help him; and, indeed, Napoleon's pride would not permit him to receive  aid from friends, even when it was forced upon him.    \"I am too poor to run into debt,\" he declared.    So he became again a hermit, as in the early days at Brienne school. He  applied himself to his studies, read much, and longed for the day when  he should be transferred from the school to the army.    The day came sooner than even he expected. He had scarcely been a  year at the Paris school when he was ordered to appear for his final  examination. Whether it was because his teachers pitied his poverty, and  wished him to have a chance for himself, or whether because, as some  would have us believe, they wished to be rid of a scholar who criticised  their methods, and was fault-finding, unsocial, and \"exasperating,\" it  is at least certain that the boy took his examinations, and passed them  satisfactorily, standing number forty in a class of fifty-eight.    \"You are a lucky boy, my Napoleon,\" said his roommate, Alexander des  Mazes; \"see! you are ahead of me. I am number fifty-six; pretty near to  the foot that, eh?\"    \"Near enough, Alexander,\" Napoleon replied; \"but I love you fifty-six  times better than any of the other boys; and what would you have, my  friend? Are not we two of the six selected for the artillery? That is  some compensation. Now let us apply for an appointment in the same  regiment.\"    They did so, and secured each a lieutenancy in an artillery regiment.  This, however, was not hard to secure; for the artillery service was  considered the hardest in the army; and the lazy young nobles and  gentlemen of the Paris military school had no desire for real work.    The certificate given to Napoleon upon his graduation read thus:--\"This  young man is reserved and studious, he prefers study to any amusement,  and enjoys reading the best authors, applies himself earnestly to the  abstract sciences, cares little for anything else. He is silent, and  loves solitude. He is capricious, haughty, and excessively egotisical,  talks little, but is quick and energetic in his replies, prompt and  severe in his repartees, has great pride and ambition, aspiring to any  thing. The young man is worthy of patronage.\"    And upon the margin of the report one of the examining officers wrote this  extra indorsement--    \"A Corsican by character and by birth. If favored by circumstances, this  young man will rise high.\"    Napoleon's school-life was over. On the first of September, 1785, he  received the papers appointing him second-lieutenant in the artillery  regiment, named La Fere (or \"the sword\"), and was ordered to report at  the garrison at Valence. His room-mate and friend, Alexander des Mazes,  was appointed to the same regiment.    It was a proud day for the boy of sixteen. At last his school-life was  at an end. He was to go into the world as a man and a soldier.    I am afraid he did not look very much like a man, even if he felt that  he was one. But he put on his uniform of lieutenant, and in high spirits  set off to visit his friends, the Permons.    They lived in a house on one of the river streets--Monsieur and Madame  Permon, and their two daughters, Cecilia and Laura.    Now, both these daughters were little girls, and as ready to see the  funny side of things as little girls usually are.    So when Lieutenant Napoleon Bonaparte, aged sixteen, came into the room,  proud of his new uniform, and feeling that he looked very smart, Laura  glanced at Cecilia, and Cecilia smiled at Laura, and then both girls  began to laugh.    Madam Permon glanced at them reprovingly, while welcoming the young  lieutenant with pleasant words.    But the boy felt that the girls were laughing at him, and he turned to  look at himself in the mirror to see what was wrong.    Nothing was wrong. It was simply Napoleon; but Napoleon just then  was not a handsome boy. Longhaired, large-headed, sallow-faced,  stiff-stocked, and feeling very new in his new uniform (which could not  be very gorgeous, however, because the boy's pocket would not admit of  any extras in the way of adornment on decoration), he was, I expect,  rather a pinched-looking, queer-looking boy; and, moreover, his boots  were so big, and his legs were so thin, that the legs appeared lost in  the boots.    As he glanced at himself in the mirror, the girls giggled again, and  their mother said,--    \"Silly ones, why do you laugh? Is our new uniform so marvellous a change  that you do not recognize Lieutenant Bonaparte?\"    \"Lieutenant Bonaparte, mamma!\" cried fun-loving Laura. \"No, no! not  that. See! is not Napoleon for all the world like--like Lieutenant  Puss-in-Boots?\"    Whereupon they laughed yet more merrily, and Napoleon laughed with them.    \"My boots are big, indeed,\" he said; \"too big, perhaps; but I hope to  grow into them. How was it with Puss-in-Boots, girls? He filled his well  at last, did he not? You will be sorry you laughed at me, some day, when  I march into your house, a big, fat general. Come, let us go and see  Eliza. They may go with me, eh, Madame?\"    \"Yes; go with the lieutenant, children,\" said Madame Permon.    [Illustration: _\"Like--like Lieutenant Puss-in-Boots!\"_]    So they all went to call on Eliza, at the school of St. Cyr, and you may  be sure that she admired her brother, the new lieutenant, boots and all.  And as they came home, Napoleon took the little girls into a toy-store,  and bought for them a toy-carriage, in which he placed a doll dressed as  Puss-in-boots.    \"It is the carriage of the Marquis of Carabas, my children,\" he said, as  they went to the Permons' house by the river. \"And when I am at Valence,  you will look at this, and think again of your friend, Lieutenant  Puss-in-Boots.\"    But between the date of his commission and his orders to join his  regiment at Valence a whole month passed, in which time Napoleon's funds  ran very low. Indeed, he was so completely penniless, that, when the  orders did come, Napoleon had nothing; and his friend Alexander had just  enough to get them both to Lyons.    \"What shall we do? I have nothing left, Napoleon,\" said Alexander; \"and  Valence is still miles away.\"    \"We can walk, Alexander,\" said Napoleon.    \"But one must eat, my friend,\" Alexander replied ruefully. For boys of  sixteen have good appetites, and do not like to go hungry.    \"True, one must eat,\" said Napoleon. \"Ah, I have it! We will call upon  Monsieur Barlet.\" Now, Monsieur Barlet was a friend of the Bonapartes,  and had once lived in Corsica. So both boys hunted him up, and Napoleon  told their story.    \"Well, my valiant soldiers of the king,\" laughed Monsieur Barlet, \"what  is the best way out? Come; fall back on your training at the military  school. What line of conduct, my Napoleon, would you adopt, if you were  besieged in a fortress and were destitute of provisions?\"    \"My faith, sir,\" answered Napoleon promptly, \"so long as there were any  provisions in the enemy's camp I would never go hungry.\"    Monsieur Barlet laughed heartily.    \"By which you mean,\" he said, \"that I am the enemy's camp, and you  propose to forage on me for provisions, eh? Good, very good, that! See,  then, I surrender. Accept, most noble warriors, a tribute from the  enemy.\"    And with that he gave the boys a little money, and a letter of  introduction to his friend at Valence, the Abbe (or Reverend) Saint  Raff.    But Lyons is a pleasant city, where there is much to see and plenty  to do. So, when the boys left Lyons, they had spent most of Monsieur  Barlet's \"tip\"; and, to keep the balance for future use, they fell  back on their original intention, and walked all the way from Lyons to  Valence.    Thus it was that Napoleon joined his regiment; and on the fifth of  November 1785, he and Alexander, foot-sore, but full of boyish spirits,  entered the old garrison-town of Valence in Southern France, and were  warmly welcomed by Alexander's older brother, Captain Gabriel des Mazes,  of the La Fere regiment, who at once took the boys in charge, and  introduced them to their new life as soldiers of the garrison of  Valence.          CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.    DARK DAYS.    It does not take boys and girls long to find out that realization is not  always equal to anticipation. Especially is this so with thoughtful,  sober-minded boys like the young Napoleon.    At first, on his arrival at Valence, as lieutenant in his regiment, he  set out to have a good time.    He took lodging with an old maid who let out rooms to young officers,  in a house on Grand Street, in the town of Valence. Her name was  Mademoiselle Bon. She kept a restaurant and billiard--room; and  Napoleon's room was on the first floor, fronting the street, and next to  the noisy billiard--room. This was not a particularly favorable place  for a boy to pursue his studies; and at first Napoleon seem disposed to  make the most of what boys would call his \"freedom.\" He went to balls  and parties; became a \"great talker;\" took dancing lessons of Professor  Dautre, and tried to become what is called a \"society man.\"    But it suited neither his tastes nor his desires, and made a large hole  in his small pay as lieutenant. Indeed, after paying for his board and  lodging, he had left only about seven dollars a month to spend for  clothes and \"fun.\" So he soon tired of this attempt to keep up  appearances on a little money. He took to his books again, studying  philosophy, geography, history, and mathematics. He thought he might  make a living by his pen, and concluded to become an author. So he began  writing a history of his native island--Corsica.    He even tried a novel, but boys of seventeen are not very well fitted  for real literary work, and his first attempts were but poor affairs.  His"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/949"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat; Or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure (#17)"],[1,"as run the risk of  lots of other troubles which are always present when sailing under  water,\" observed Mr Damon, who wandered about the submarine like the  nervous person he was. \"Bless my shirt-studs! Can't we blow them up, or  cripple them in some way? They have no right to go after our treasure.\"    \"Well, I guess they've got as much right as we have,\" declared Tom. \"It  goes to whoever reaches the wreck first.  But what I don't like is  their mean, sneaking way of doing it. If they went off on their own  hook and looked for it I wouldn't say a word. But they expect us to  lead them to the wreck, and then they'll rob us if they can. That's not  fair.\"    \"Indeed, it isn't,\" agreed Captain Weston, \"if I may be allowed the  expression. We ought to find some way of stopping them. But, if I'm not  mistaken,\" he added quickly, looking from one of the port bull's-eyes,  \"the phosphorescent glow is lessening. I believe we are running beyond  that part of the ocean.\"    There was no doubt of it, the glow was growing less and less, and ten  minutes later the Advance was speeding along through a sea as black as  night. Then, to avoid running into some wreck, it was necessary to turn  on the searchlight.    \"Are they still after us?\" asked Mr. Swift of his son, as he emerged  from the engine-room, where he had gone to make some adjustments to the  machinery, with the hope of increasing the speed.    \"I'll go look,\" volunteered the lad. He climbed up into the conning  tower again, and for a moment, as he gazed back into the black waters  swirling all about, he hoped that they had lost the Wonder. But a  moment later his heart sank as he caught sight, through the liquid  element, of the flickering gleams of another searchlight, the rays  undulating through the sea.    \"Still following,\" murmured the young inventor. \"They're not going to  give up. But we must make 'em--that's all.\"    He went down to report what he had seen, and a consultation was held.  Captain Weston carefully studied the charts of that part of the ocean,  and finding that there was a great depth of water at hand, proposed a  series of evolutions.    \"We can go up and down, shoot first to one side and then to the other,\"  he explained. \"We can even drop down to the bottom and rest there for a  while. Perhaps, in that way, we can shake them off.\"    They tried it. The Advance was sent up until her conning tower was out  of the water, and then she was suddenly forced down until she was but a  few feet from the bottom. She darted to the left, to the right, and  even doubled and went back over the course she had taken. But all to no  purpose.  The Wonder proved fully as speedy, and those in her seemed to  know just how to handle the submarine, so that every evolution of the  Advance was duplicated. Her rival could not be shaken off.    All night this was kept up, and when morning came, though only the  clocks told it, for eternal night was below the surface, the rival  gold-seekers were still on the trail.    \"They won't give up,\" declared Mr. Swift hopelessly.    \"No, we've got to race them for it, just as Berg proposed,\" admitted  Tom. \"But if they want a straightaway race we'll give it to 'em. Let's  run her to the limit, dad.\"    \"That's what we've been doing, Tom.\"    \"No, not exactly, for we've been submerged a little too much to get the  best speed out of our craft. Let's go a little nearer the surface, and  give them the best race they'll ever have.\"    Then the race began; and such a contest of speed as it was! With her  propellers working to the limit, and every volt of electricity that was  available forced into the forward and aft plates, the Advance surged  through the water, about ten feet below the surface. But the Wonder  kept after her, giving her knot for knot. The course of the leading  submarine was easy to trace now, in the morning light which penetrated  ten feet down.    \"No use,\" remarked Tom again, when, after two hours, the Wonder was  still close behind them. \"Our only chance is that they may have a  breakdown.\"    \"Or run out of air, or something like that,\" added Captain Weston.  \"They are crowding us pretty close. I had no idea they could keep up  this speed. If they don't look out,\" he went on as he looked from one  of the aft observation windows, \"they'll foul us, and--\"    His remarks were interrupted by a jar to the Advance. She seemed to  shiver and careened to one side. Then came another bump.    \"Slow down!\" cried the captain, rushing toward the pilot house.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Tom, as he threw the engines and electrical  machines out of gear. \"Have we hit anything?\"    \"No. Something has hit us,\" cried the captain. \"Their submarine has  rammed us.\"    \"Rammed us!\" repeated Mr. Swift. \"Tom, run out the electric cannon!  They're trying to sink us! We'll have to fight them. Run out the stern  electric gun and we'll make them wish they'd not followed us.\"          Chapter Eighteen    The Electric Gun      There was much  excitement aboard the Advance. The submarine came to a  stop in the water, while the treasure-seekers waited anxiously for what  was to follow. Would they be rammed again? This time, stationary as  they were, and with the other boat coming swiftly on, a hole might be  stove through the Advance, in spite of her powerful sides.    They had not long to wait. Again there came a jar, and once more the  Swifts' boat careened. But the blow was a glancing one and,  fortunately, did little damage.    \"They certainly must be trying to sink us,\" agreed Captain Weston.  \"Come, Tom, we'll take a look from the stern and see what they're up  to.\"    \"And get the stern electric gun ready to fire,\" repeated Mr. Swift. \"We  must protect ourselves. Mr. Sharp and I will go to the bow. There is no  telling what they may do. They're desperate, and may ram us from in  front.\"    Tom and the captain hurried aft. Through the thick plate-glass windows  they could see the blunt nose of the Wonder not far away, the rival  submarine having come to a halt.  There she lay, black and silent, like  some monster fish waiting to devour its victim.    \"There doesn't appear to be much damage done back here,\" observed Tom.  \"No leaks. Guess they didn't puncture us.\"    \"Perhaps it was due to an accident that they rammed us,\" suggested the  captain.    \"Well, they wouldn't have done it if they hadn't followed us so close,\"  was the opinion of the young inventor.  \"They're taking too many  chances. We've got to stop 'em.\"    \"What is this electric gun your father speaks of?\"    \"Why, it's a regular electric cannon. It fires a solid ball, weighing  about twenty-five pounds, but instead of powder, which would hardly do  under water, and instead of compressed air, which is used in the  torpedo tubes of the Government submarines, we use a current of  electricity. It forces the cannon ball out with great energy.\"    \"I wonder what they will do next?\" observed the captain, peering  through a bull's eye.    \"We can soon tell,\" replied the youth. \"We'll go ahead, and if they try  to follow I'm going to fire on them.\"    \"Suppose you sink them?\"    \"I won't fire to do that; only to disable them. They brought it on  themselves. We can't risk having them damage us. Help me with the  cannon, will you please, captain?\"    The electric cannon was a long, steel tube in the after part of the  submarine. It projected a slight distance from the sides of the ship,  and by an ingenious arrangement could be swung around in a ball and  socket joint, thus enabling it to shoot in almost any direction.    It was the work of but a few minutes to get it ready and, with the  muzzle pointing toward the Wonder, Tom adjusted the electric wires and  inserted the solid shot.    \"Now we're prepared for them!\" he cried. \"I think a good plan will be  to start ahead, and if they try to follow to fire on them. They've  brought it on themselves.\"    \"Correct,\" spoke Captain Weston.    Tom hurried forward to tell his father of this plan.    \"We'll do it!\" cried Mr. Swift. \"Go ahead, Mr. Sharp, and we'll see if  those scoundrels will follow.\"    The young inventor returned on the run to the electric cannon. There  was a whir of machinery, and the Advance moved forward. She increased  her speed, and the two watchers in the stern looked anxiously out of  the windows to see what their rivals would do.    For a moment no movement was noticeable on the part of the Wonder.  Then, as those aboard her appeared to realize that the craft on which  they depended to pilot them to the sunken treasure was slipping away,  word was given to follow. The ship of Berg and his employers shot after  the Advance.    \"Here they come!\" cried Captain Weston. \"They're going to ram us again!\"    \"Then I'm going to fire on them!\" declared Tom savagely.    On came the Wonder, nearer and nearer. Her speed was rapidly  increasing. Suddenly she bumped the Advance, and then, as if it was an  unavoidable accident, the rear submarine sheered off to one side.    \"They're certainly at it again!\" cried Tom, and peering from the  bull's-eye he saw the Wonder shoot past the mouth of the electric  cannon. \"Here it goes!\" he added.    He shoved over the lever, making the proper connection.  There was no  corresponding report, for the cannon was noiseless, but there was a  slight jar as the projectile left the muzzle. The Wonder could be seen  to heel over.    \"You hit her! You hit her!\" cried Captain Weston. \"A good shot!\"    \"I was afraid she was past me when I pulled the lever,\" explained Tom.  \"She went like a flash.\"    \"No, you caught her on the rudder,\" declared the captain.  \"I think  you've put her out of business. Yes, they're rising to the surface.\"    The lad rapidly inserted another ball, and recharged the cannon. Then  he peered out into the water, illuminated by the light of day overhead,  as they were not far down. He could see the Wonder rising to the  surface. Clearly something had happened.  "]]]
