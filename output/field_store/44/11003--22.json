Yet we see, by the passage of  Polybius[277] which enumerates the mercantile exports of this province  with their prices, that its agricultural products were very  abundant.[278]    The prosperity of Spain appears also from the vast amount of its  population. According to some authors, Tiberius Gracchus took from the  Celtiberians three hundred _oppida_. In Turdetania (_part of  Andalusia_), according to Strabo, there were counted no less than two  hundred towns.[279] Appian, the historian of the Spanish wars, points  out the multitude of petty tribes which the Romans had to reduce,[280]  and during the campaign of Cn. Scipio, more than a hundred and twenty  submitted.[281]    Thus the Iberian peninsula was at that time reckoned among the most  populous and richest regions of Europe.      [Sidenote: Southern Gaul.]    IV. The part of Gaul which is bathed by the Mediterranean offers a  spectacle no less satisfactory. Numerous migrations, arriving from the  East, had pushed back the population of the Seine and the Loire towards  the mouths of the Rhone, and already, in the middle of the fourth  century before our era, the Gauls found themselves straitened in their  frontiers. More civilised than the Iberians, but not less energetic,  they combined gentle and hospitable manners with great activity, which  was further developed by their contact with the Greek colonies spread  from the maritime Alps to the Pyrenees. The cultivation of the fields  and the breeding of cattle furnished their principal wealth, and their  industry found support in the products of the soil and in its herds.  Their manufacture consisted of says, not less in repute than those of  the Celtiberians, and exported in great quantities to Italy. Good  sailors, the Gauls transported by water, on the Seine, the Rhine, the  Saone, the Rhone, and Loire, the merchandise and timber which, even from  the coasts of the Channel, were accumulated in the Phocaean trading  places on the Mediterranean.[282] Agde (_Agatha_), Antibes  (_Antipolis_), Nice (_Nicaea_), the isles of Hyeres (_Stoechades_),  Monaco (_Portus Herculis Monoecei_), were so many naval stations which  maintained relations with Spain and Italy.[283]    Marseilles possessed but a very circumscribed territory, but its  influence reached far into the interior of Gaul. It is to this town we  owe the acclimatisation of the vine and the olive. Thousands of oxen  came every year to feed on the thyme in the neighbourhood of  Marseilles.[284] The Massilian merchants traversed Gaul in all  directions to sell their wines and the produce of their  manufactures.[285] Without rising to the rank of a great maritime power,  still the small Phocaean republic possessed sufficient resources to make  itself respected by Carthage; it formed an early alliance with the  Romans. Massilian houses had, as early as the fifth century of Rome,  established at Syracuse, as they did subsequently at Alexandria,  factories which show a great commercial activity.[286]      [Sidenote: Liguria, Cisalpine Gaul, Venetia, and Illyria.]    V. Alone in the Tyrrhene Sea, the Ligures had not yet risen out of that  almost savage life which the Iberians, sprung from the same stock, had  originally led. If some towns on the Ligurian coast, and especially  Genoa (_Genua_), carried on a maritime commerce, they supported  themselves by piracy[287] rather than by regular traffic.[288]    On the contrary, Cisalpine Gaul, properly so called, supported, as early  as the time of Polybius, a numerous population. We may form some idea of  it from the losses this province sustained during a period of  twenty-seven years, from 554 to 582; Livy gives a total of 257,400 men  killed, taken, or transported.[289] The Gaulish tribes settled in the  Cisalpine, though preserving their original manners, had, through their  contact with the Etruscans, arrived at a certain degree of civilisation.  The number of towns in this country was not very considerable, but it  contained a great abundance of villages.[290] Addicted to agriculture  like the other Gauls, the Cisalpines bred in their forests droves of  swine in such numbers, that they would have been sufficient, in the time  of Strabo, to provision all Rome.[291] The coins of pure gold, which in  recent times have been found in Cisalpine Gaul, especially between the  Po and the Adda, and which were struck by the Boii and some of the  Ligurian populations, furnish evidence of the abundance of that metal,  which was collected in the form of gold sand in the waters of the  rivers.[292] Moreover, certain towns of Etruscan origin, such as Mantua  (_Mantua_) and Padua (_Patavium_), preserved vestiges of the prosperity  they had reached at the time when the peoples of Tuscany extended their  dominion beyond the Po. At once a maritime town and a place of commerce,  Padua, at a remote epoch, possessed a vast territory, and could raise an  army of 120,000 men.[293] The transport of goods was facilitated by  means of canals crossing Venetia, partly dug by the Etruscans. Such  were those especially which united Ravenna with Altinum (_Altino_),  which became at a later period the grand store-house of the Cisalpine  territory.[294]    The commercial relations entertained by Venetia with Germany, Illyria,  and Rhaetia, go back far beyond the Roman epoch, and, at a remote  antiquity, it was Venetia which received the amber from the shores of  the Baltic.[295] All the traffic which was afterwards concentrated at  Aquileia, founded by the Romans after the submission of the Veneti, had  then for its centre the towns of Venetia; and the numerous colonies  established by the Romans in this part of the peninsula are proofs of  its immense resources. Moreover, the Veneti, occupied in cultivating  their lands and breeding horses, had peaceful manners which facilitated  commercial relations, and contrasted with the piratical habits of the  populations spread over the north and north-eastern coasts of the  Adriatic.    The Istrians, the Liburni, and the Illyrians were the nations most  formidable, both by their corsairs and by their armies; their light and  rapid barques covered the Adriatic, and troubled the navigation between  Italy and Greece. In the year 524, the Illyrians sent to sea a hundred  _lembi_,[296] while their land army counted hardly more than 5,000  men.[297] Illyria was poor, and offered few resources to the Romans,  notwithstanding the fertility of its soil. Agriculture was neglected,  even in the time of Strabo. Istria contained a population much more  considerable, in proportion to its extent.[298] Yet she had, no more  than Dalmatia and the rest of Illyria, attained, at the epoch of which  we are speaking, that high degree of prosperity which she acquired  afterwards by the foundation of Tergeste (_Trieste_) and Pola. The Roman  conquest delivered the Adriatic from the pirates who infested it,[299]  and then only, the ports of Dyrrhachium and Apollonia obtained a  veritable importance.      [Sidenote: Epirus.]    VI. Epirus, a country of pastures and shepherds, intersected by  picturesque mountains, was a sort of Helvetia. Ambracia (now _Arta_),  which Pyrrhus had chosen for his residence, had become a very fine town,  and possessed two theatres. The palace of the king (_Pyrrheum_) formed a  veritable museum for it furnished for the triumph of M. Fulvius  Nobilior, in 565, two hundred and eighty-five statues in bronze, two  hundred and thirty in marble,[300] and paintings by Zeuxis, mentioned in  Pliny.[301] The town paid also, on this occasion, five hundred talents  (2,900,000 francs, [L116,000]), and offered the consul a crown of gold  weighing a hundred and fifty thousand talents (nearly 4,000  kilogrammes).[302] It appears that before the war of Paulus AEmilius,  this country contained a rather numerous population, and counted seventy  towns, most of them situated in the country of the Molossi.[303]. After  the battle of Pydna, the Roman general made so considerable a booty,  that, without reckoning the treasury's share, each foot-soldier received  200 denarii (about 200 francs [L8]), and each horse-soldier 400; in  addition to which the sale of slaves arose to the enormous number of  150,000.      [Sidenote: Greece.]    VII. At the beginning of the first Punic War, Greece proper was divided  into four principal powers: Macedonia, AEtolia, Achaia, and Sparta. All  the continental part, which extends northward of the Gulf of Corinth as  far as the mountains of Pindus, was under the dependence of Philip; the  western part belonged to the AEtolians. The Peloponnesus was shared  between the Achaeans, the tyrant of Sparta, and independent towns. Greece  had been declining during about a century, and seen her warlike spirit  weaken and her population diminish; and yet Plutarch, comprising under  this name the peoples of the Hellenic race, pretends that their country  furnished King Philip with the money, food, and provisions of his  army.[304] The Greek navy had almost disappeared. The Achaean league,  which comprised Argolis, Corinth, Sicyon, and the maritime cities of  Achaea, had few ships. On land the Hellenic forces were less  insignificant. The AEtolian league possessed an army of 10,000"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45464"],[0,"The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion (#17)"],[1," of their conception of man.  Sympathy, and love, and fatherly kindness, and forgiving mercy, have  evaporated in the crucible of their philosophy; and what is the _caput  mortuum_ that remains, but only the sterner features of humanity  exhibited in repulsive nakedness? The God who listens to prayer, we  are told, appears in the likeness of human mutability. Be it so. What  is the God who does not listen, but the likeness of human obstinacy?  Do we ascribe to him a fixed purpose? Our conception of a purpose is  human. Do we speak of him as continuing unchanged? Our conception of  continuance is human. Do we conceive him as knowing and determining?  What are knowledge and determination but modes of human consciousness?  and what know we of consciousness itself, but as the contrast between  successive mental states? But our rational philosopher stops short in  his reasoning. He strips off from humanity just so much as suits his  purpose; 'and the residue thereof he maketh a God less pious in his  idolatry than the carver of the graven image, in that he does not fall  down unto it and pray unto it, but is content to stand off and reason  concerning it. And why does he retain any conception of God at all, but  that he retains some portions of an imperfect humanity? Man is still  the residue that is left; deprived indeed of all that is amiable in  humanity, but in the darker features which remain, still man. Man in  his purposes; man in his inflexibility; man in that relation to time  from which no philosophy, whatever its pretensions, can wholly free  itself; pursuing with indomitable resolutions a preconceived design;  deaf to the yearning instincts which compel his creatures to call upon  him. Yet this, forsooth, is a philosophical conception of the Deity,  more worthy of an enlightened reason than the human imagery of the  Psalmist: 'The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears  are open unto their prayers.' Surely downright idolatry is better  than this rational worship of a fragment of humanity. Better is the  superstition which sees the image of God in the wonderful whole which  God has fashioned, than the philosophy which would carve for itself a  Deity out of the remnant which man has mutilated. Better to realize  the satire of the eleatic philosopher, (Xenophanes) to make God in the  likeness of man, even as the ox or the horse might conceive gods in the  form of oxen or horses, than to adorn some half-hewn Hermes, the head  of a man joined to a misshapen block. Better to fall down before that  marvelous compound of human consciousness whose elements God has joined  together, and no man can put asunder, than to strip reason of those  cognate elements which together furnish all that we can conceive or  imagine of conscious or personal existence, and to deify the emptiest  of all abstractions, a something or nothing, with just enough of its  human original left to form a theme for the disputation of philosophy,  but not enough to furnish a single ground of appeal to the human  feelings of love, of reverence, and of fear. Unmixed idolatry is more  religious than this. Undisguised atheism is more logical.\" (Limits of  Religious Thought, Mansel, pp. 56-58).    Notwithstanding this passage, however, it should be remarked that  Dean Mansel holds on the very next page of this treatise that there  is a principle of truth of which this philosophy is the perversion.  \"Surely,\" he remarks, \"there is a sense in which we may not think of  God as though he were a man; as there is also a sense in which we  cannot help so thinking of him. * * * * * We feel that there is a true  foundation for the system which denies human attributes to God; _though  the superstructure, which has been raised upon it, logically involves  the denial of his very existence_.\" The position of the Dean, as is  well known, is that such are the limitations of the human mind--such  the limitations of religious thought, that man may not hope to  understand the divine nature, but as an act of faith must accept what  is revealed concerning that nature.]    But the strangest part of the Reverend gentleman's contention on  the matter now in hand is that the Latter-day Saints understand the  anthropomorphic expressions in the scriptures as he explains them; and  cites our catechisms (chapter 5, question 9) in proof of it![A] I quote  the reference given:    [Footnote A: This is a thing so astonishing for Mr. Van Der Donckt to  say, that lest the reader should think I had misunderstood him. I place  before him in this note Mr. Van Der Donckt's statement at length. \"It  is a well known fact that all men after the example of the inspired  writings, make frequent use of the figure called anthropomorphism,  attributing to the Deity a human body, human members, human passions,  etc.; and that is done, not to imply that God is possessed of form,  limbs, etc., but simply to make spiritual things or certain truths more  intelligible to man, who, while he tarries in this world, can perceive  things and even ideas only through his senses, or through bodily organs.    \"That even the Latter-day Saints thus understand such expressions is  evident from their catechism (chapter 5: question 9), etc., etc.\"]          9. Q. If God is a person, how can he be everywhere present? A. His      person cannot be in more than one place at the same time, but he is      everywhere present by his Holy Spirit.    This is preceded by the following passages from the same book and  chapter:          1. Q. What kind of a being is God?        A. He is in the form of a man.        2. Q. How do you learn this?        A. The scriptures declare that man was made in the image of God. *      * *        3. Q. Have you any further proof of God's being in the form of a      man?        A. Yes, Jesus Christ was in the form of a man, and was at the same      time in the image of God's person. * * *        4. Q. Is it not said that God is a spirit?        A. Yes; the scriptures say so. (John 4:24.) * * *        5. Q. How, then, can God be like man?        A. Man has a spirit, though clothed with a body, and God is      similarly constituted.        6. Q. Has God a body then?        A. Yes; like unto man's body in figure.        7. Q. Is the person of God very glorious?        A. Yes; infinitely glorious.        8. Q. Is God everywhere present?        A. Yes; He is in all parts of the universe.    Then follows, of course, question nine and its answer, quoted above and  by Mr. V.; and yet the gentleman, in the very face of these explicit  statements concerning the reality of God's form in our faith, would  have it believed that the Latter-day Saints understand the expressions  of scripture ascribing human forms, limbs and organs to God as he  explains them--not to imply that God is possessed of form, limbs, etc.,  but simply to make spiritual things more intelligible to man! This is a  splendid illustration of Mr. V.'s ability to misunderstand.    Mr. V. next takes up the subject of understanding the language of the  Bible literally. He says it is from anthropomorphic passages of the  Bible that the Latter-day Saints conclude that God has a body--such  passages as speak of the face, hands feet and other limbs and organs of  God. He holds these passages to be figurative. \"I contend,\" he remarks,  \"that if we must understand the Bible literally in those passages  ('God created man in his own image') from which they attempt to prove  that God has a body, we must interpret it literally in _other similar  passages_.\"[A] I assent to that. It is well known that the language of  the Bible is highly figurative, almost extravagantly so in places, and  much allowance must be made for the inclination to imagery of prophetic  natures, which, like poetic temperaments, are given to imagery; and  hyperbole is the vice of oriental speech. But Mr. V. is not true to  this canon of interpretation he lays down, _viz_., _the same rule  of interpretation must be applied to passages that are similar in  character_. After laying down this principle of interpretation, he  proceeds to depart from it by placing for comparison very _dissimilar  passages_. What similarity is there, for example, in the plain, matter  of fact statement, \"God created man in his own image, in the image of  God created he him;\" and the passage he quotes from Psalms: \"If I take  my wings early in the morning, and dwell in the uttermost part of the  sea, even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold  me\"? And this also: \"Whither shall I flee from thy face. If I ascend  into heaven, thou art there; If I descend into hell thou art there?\"  Has not the Reverend gentleman placed for comparison here the most  dissimilar passages that perhaps could be found in the whole Bible?  Yet he insists that the prosy passage from Genesis must be regarded as  equally figurative with David's poetry, and insists that if \"Mormons\"  believe literally that God made man in his own image and likeness,  or that Moses and seventy elders saw the God of Israel, as plainly  declared by Moses, then \"They must believe that God had such a very  long hand as to extend to the uttermost parts of the sea;\" and \"such an  extremely long face, reaching from heaven to hell;\" and \"conclude that  David had wings!\" Further remarks on this head are not necessary. One  is under no obligation to seriously discuss nonsense.    [Footnote A: Italics are mine--R.]    Of the Incarnation or the Son or God.    Another case of misapprehension of \"Mormon\" ideas will be found in what  Mr. Van Der Donckt says with reference to the Latter-day Saints' sacred  books not teaching the Christian truth of the incarnation of Deity in  the person of Jesus Christ. The sacred books of the Latter-day Saints  may not contain the verbiage of so-called Christian literature on the  subject; but if full recognition of the fact that Jesus was in the  beginning with the Father--was the \"Word,\""]]]
