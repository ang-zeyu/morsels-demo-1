And Kaw of  North Britain came and shaved his beard, skin and flesh clean off to  the very bone from ear to ear.    \"Art thou shaved, man?\" said Kilhuch.    \"I am shaved,\" answered he.    \"Is thy daughter mine now?\"    \"She is thine, but therefore needst thou not thank me, but Arthur who  hath accomplished this for thee. By my free will thou shouldst never  have had her, for with her I lose my life.\"    Then Goreu the son of Custennin seized him by the hair of his head and  dragged him after him to the keep, and cut off his head and placed it  on a stake on the citadel.    Thereafter the hosts of Arthur dispersed themselves each man to his own  country.    Thus did Kilhuch son of Kelython win to wife Olwen, the daughter of  Yspathaden Penkawr.          JACK AND HIS COMRADES    Once there was a poor widow, as often there has been, and she had one  son. A very scarce summer came, and they didn't know how they'd live  till the new potatoes would be fit for eating. So Jack said to his  mother one evening, \"Mother, bake my cake, and kill my hen, till I go  seek my fortune; and if I meet it, never fear but I'll soon be back to  share it with you.\"    So she did as he asked her, and he set out at break of day on his  journey. His mother came along with him to the yard gate, and says she,  \"Jack, which would you rather have, half the cake and half the hen with  my blessing, or the whole of 'em with my curse?\"    \"O musha, mother,\" says Jack, \"why do you ax me that question? sure you  know I wouldn't have your curse and Damer's estate along with it.\"    \"Well, then, Jack,\" says she, \"here's the whole lot of 'em with my  thousand blessings along with them.\" So she stood on the yard fence and  blessed him as far as her eyes could see him.    Well, he went along and along till he was tired, and ne'er a farmer's  house he went into wanted a boy. At last his road led by the side of a  bog, and there was a poor ass up to his shoulders near a big bunch of  grass he was striving to come at.    \"Ah, then, Jack asthore,\" says he, \"help me out or I'll be drowned.\"    \"Never say't twice,\" says Jack, and he pitched in big stones and sods  into the slob, till the ass got good ground under him.    \"Thank you, Jack,\" says he, when he was out on the hard road; \"I'll do  as much for you another time. Where are you going?\"    \"Faith, I'm going to seek my fortune till harvest comes in, God bless  it!\"    \"And if you like,\" says the ass, \"I'll go along with you; who knows  what luck we may have!\"    \"With all my heart, it's getting late, let us be jogging.\"    Well, they were going through a village, and a whole army of gossoons  were hunting a poor dog with a kettle tied to his tail. He ran up to  Jack for protection, and the ass let such a roar out of him, that the  little thieves took to their heels as if the ould boy was after them.    \"More power to you, Jack,\" says the dog.    \"I'm much obleeged to you: where is the baste and yourself going?\"    \"We're going to seek our fortune till harvest comes in.\"    \"And wouldn't I be proud to go with you!\" says the dog, \"and get rid of  them ill conducted boys; purshuin' to 'em.\"    \"Well, well, throw your tail over your arm, and come along.\"    They got outside the town, and sat down under an old wall, and Jack  pulled out his bread and meat, and shared with the dog; and the ass  made his dinner on a bunch of thistles. While they were eating and  chatting, what should come by but a poor half-starved cat, and the  moll-row he gave out of him would make your heart ache.    \"You look as if you saw the tops of nine houses since breakfast,\" says  Jack; \"here's a bone and something on it.\"    \"May your child never know a hungry belly!\" says Tom; \"it's myself  that's in need of your kindness. May I be so bold as to ask where yez  are all going?\"    \"We're going to seek our fortune till the harvest comes in, and you may  join us if you like.\"    \"And that I'll do with a heart and a half,\" says the cat, \"and thank'ee  for asking me.\"'    Off they set again, and just as the shadows of the trees were three  times as long as themselves, they heard a great cackling in a field  inside the road, and out over the ditch jumped a fox with a fine black  cock in his mouth.    \"Oh, you anointed villain!\" says the ass, roaring like thunder.    \"At him, good dog!\" says Jack, and the word wasn't out of his mouth  when Coley was in full sweep after the Red Dog. Reynard dropped his  prize like a hot potato, and was off like shot, and the poor cock came  back fluttering and trembling to Jack and his comrades.    \"O musha, naybours!\" says he, \"wasn't it the height o' luck that threw  you in my way! Maybe I won't remember your kindness if ever I find you  in hardship; and where in the world are you all going?\"    \"We're going to seek our fortune till the harvest comes in; you may  join our party if you like, and sit on Neddy's crupper when your legs  and wings are tired.\"    Well, the march began again, and just as the sun was gone down they  looked around, and there was neither cabin nor farm house in sight.    \"Well, well,\" says Jack, \"the worse luck now the better another time,  and it's only a summer night after all. We'll go into the wood, and  make our bed on the long grass.\"    No sooner said than done. Jack stretched himself on a bunch of dry  grass, the ass lay near him, the dog and cat lay in the ass's warm lap,  and the cock went to roost in the next tree.    Well, the soundness of deep sleep was over them all, when the cock took  a notion of crowing.    \"Bother you, Black Cock!\" says the ass: \"you disturbed me from as nice  a wisp of hay as ever I tasted. What's the matter?\"    \"It's daybreak that's the matter: don't you see light yonder?\"    \"I see a light indeed,\" says Jack, \"but it's from a candle it's coming,  and not from the sun. As you've roused us we may as well go over, and  ask for lodging.\"    So they all shook themselves, and went on through grass, and rocks, and  briars, till they got down into a hollow, and there was the light  coming through the shadow, and along with it came singing, and  laughing, and cursing.    \"Easy, boys!\" says Jack: \"walk on your tippy toes till we see what sort  of people we have to deal with.\"    So they crept near the window, and there they saw six robbers inside,  with pistols, and blunderbushes, and cutlashes, sitting at a table,  eating roast beef and pork, and drinking mulled beer, and wine, and  whisky punch.    \"Wasn't that a fine haul we made at the Lord of Dunlavin's!\" says one  ugly-looking thief with his mouth full, \"and it's little we'd get only  for the honest porter! here's his purty health!\"    \"The porter's purty health!\" cried out every one of them, and Jack bent  his finger at his comrades.    \"Close your ranks, my men,\" says he in a whisper, \"and let every one  mind the word of command.\"    So the ass put his fore-hoofs on the sill of the window, the dog got on  the ass's head, the cat on the dog's head, and the cock on the cat's  head. Then Jack made a sign, and they all sung out like mad.    \"Hee-haw, hee-haw!\" roared the ass; \"bow-wow!\" barked the dog;  \"meaw-meaw!\" cried the cat; \"cock-a-doodle-doo!\" crowed the cock.    \"Level your pistols!\" cried Jack, \"and make smithereens of 'em. Don't  leave a mother's son of 'em alive; present, fire!\"  With that they gave  another halloo, and smashed every pane in the window. The robbers were  frightened out of their lives. They blew out the candles, threw down  the table, and skelped out at the back door as if they were in earnest,  and never drew rein till they were in the very heart of the wood.    Jack and his party got into the room, closed the shutters, lighted the  candles, and ate and drank till hunger and thirst were gone. Then they  lay down to rest;--Jack in the bed, the ass in the stable, the dog on  the door-mat, the cat by the fire, and the cock on the perch.    At first the robbers were very glad to find themselves safe in the  thick wood, but they soon began to get vexed.    \"This damp grass is very different from our warm room,\" says one.    \"I was obliged to drop a fine pig's foot,\" says another.    \"I didn't get a tayspoonful of my last tumbler,\" says another.    \"And all the Lord of Dunlavin's gold and silver that we left behind!\"  says the last.    \"I think I'll venture back,\" says the captain, \"and see if we can  recover anything.\"    \"That's a good boy!\" said they all, and away he went.    The lights were all out, and so he groped his way to the fire, and  there the cat flew in his face, and tore him with teeth and claws. He  let a roar out of him, and made for the room door, to look for a candle  inside. He trod on the dog's tail, and if he did, he got the marks of  his teeth in his arms, and legs, and thighs.    \"Thousand murders!\" cried he; \"I wish I was out of this unlucky house.\"    When he got to the street door, the cock dropped down upon him with his  claws and bill, and what the cat and dog done to him was only a  flay-bite to what he got from the cock.    \"Oh, tattheration to you all, you unfeeling vagabones!\" says he, when  he recovered his breath; and he staggered and spun round and round till  he reeled into the stable, back foremost, but the ass received him with  a kick on the broadest part of his small clothes, and laid him  comfortably on the dunghill.    When he came to himself, he scratched his head, and began to think what  happened him; and as soon as he found that his legs were able to carry  him, he crawled away, dragging one foot after another, till he reached  the wood.    \"Well, well,\" cried them all, when he came within hearing, \"any chance  of our property?\"    \"You may say chance,\" says he, \"and it's itself is the poor chance all  out. Ah, will any of you pull a bed of dry grass for me?

You see the  famous abbey from here.\"    They ran aground on a beach of big pebbles covered with slime.    \"And it can't be very far away,\" he added. \"Dalbreque did not spend the  whole night running about.\"    A tow-path followed the deserted bank. Another path led away from it. They  chose the second and, passing between orchards enclosed by hedges, came to  a landscape that seemed strangely familiar to them. Where had they seen  that pool before, with the willows overhanging it? And where had they seen  that abandoned hovel?    Suddenly both of them stopped with one accord:    \"Oh!\" said Hortense. \"I can hardly believe my eyes!\"    Opposite them was the white gate of a large orchard, at the back of which,  among groups of old, gnarled apple-trees, appeared a cottage with blue  shutters, the cottage of the Happy Princess.    \"Of course!\" cried Renine. \"And I ought to have known it, considering  that the film showed both this cottage and the forest close by. And isn't  everything happening exactly as in _The Happy Princess_? Isn't  Dalbreque dominated by the memory of it? The house, which is certainly the  one in which Rose Andree spent the summer, was empty. He has shut her up  there.\"    \"But the house, you told me, was in the Seine-inferieure.\"    \"Well, so are we! To the left of the river, the Eure and the forest of  Brotonne; to the right, the Seine-inferieure. But between them is the  obstacle of the river, which is why I didn't connect the two. A hundred and  fifty yards of water form a more effective division than dozens of miles.\"    The gate was locked. They got through the hedge a little lower down and  walked towards the house, which was screened on one side by an old wall  shaggy with ivy and roofed with thatch.    \"It seems as if there was somebody there,\" said Hortense. \"Didn't I hear  the sound of a window?\"    \"Listen.\"    Some one struck a few chords on a piano. Then a voice arose, a woman's  voice softly and solemnly singing a ballad that thrilled with restrained  passion. The woman's whole soul seemed to breathe itself into the melodious  notes.    They walked on. The wall concealed them from view, but they saw a  sitting-room furnished with bright wall-paper and a blue Roman carpet. The  throbbing voice ceased. The piano ended with a last chord; and the singer  rose and appeared framed in the window.    \"Rose Andree!\" whispered Hortense.    \"Well!\" said Renine, admitting his astonishment. \"This is the last thing  that I expected! Rose Andree! Rose Andree at liberty! And singing Massenet  in the sitting room of her cottage!\"    \"What does it all mean? Do you understand?\"    \"Yes, but it has taken me long enough! But how could we have guessed ...?\"    Although they had never seen her except on the screen, they had not the  least doubt that this was she. It was really Rose Andree, or rather,  the Happy Princess, whom they had admired a few days before, amidst the  furniture of that very sitting-room or on the threshold of that very  cottage. She was wearing the same dress; her hair was done in the same way;  she had on the same bangles and necklaces as in _The Happy Princess_;  and her lovely face, with its rosy cheeks and laughing eyes, bore the same  look of joy and serenity.    Some sound must have caught her ear, for she leant over towards a clump of  shrubs beside the cottage and whispered into the silent garden:    \"Georges ... Georges ... Is that you, my darling?\"    Receiving no reply, she drew herself up and stood smiling at the happy  thoughts that seemed to flood her being.    But a door opened at the back of the room and an old peasant woman entered  with a tray laden with bread, butter and milk:    \"Here, Rose, my pretty one, I've brought you your supper. Milk fresh from  the cow....\"    And, putting down the tray, she continued:    \"Aren't you afraid, Rose, of the chill of the night air? Perhaps you're  expecting your sweetheart?\"    \"I haven't a sweetheart, my dear old Catherine.\"    \"What next!\" said the old woman, laughing. \"Only this morning there were  footprints under the window that didn't look at all proper!\"    \"A burglar's footprints perhaps, Catherine.\"    \"Well, I don't say they weren't, Rose dear, especially as in your calling  you have a lot of people round you whom it's well to be careful of. For  instance, your friend Dalbreque, eh? Nice goings on his are! You saw the  paper yesterday. A fellow who has robbed and murdered people and carried  off a woman at Le Havre ...!\"    Hortense and Renine would have much liked to know what Rose Andree thought  of the revelations, but she had turned her back to them and was sitting at  her supper; and the window was now closed, so that they could neither hear  her reply nor see the expression of her features.    They waited for a moment. Hortense was listening with an anxious face. But  Renine began to laugh:    \"Very funny, really funny! And such an unexpected ending! And we who were  hunting for her in some cave or damp cellar, a horrible tomb where the poor  thing was dying of hunger! It's a fact, she knew the terrors of that first  night of captivity; and I maintain that, on that first night, she was  flung, half-dead, into the cave. Only, there you are: the next morning  she was alive! One night was enough to tame the little rogue and to  make Dalbreque as handsome as Prince Charming in her eyes! For see the  difference. On the films or in novels, the Happy Princesses resist or  commit suicide. But in real life ... oh, woman, woman!\"    \"Yes,\" said Hortense, \"but the man she loves is almost certainly dead.\"    \"And a good thing too! It would be the best solution. What would be the  outcome of this criminal love for a thief and murderer?\"    A few minutes passed. Then, amid the peaceful silence of the waning day,  mingled with the first shadows of the twilight, they again heard the  grating of the window, which was cautiously opened. Rose Andree leant over  the garden and waited, with her eyes turned to the wall, as though she saw  something there.    Presently, Renine shook the ivy-branches.    \"Ah!\" she said. \"This time I know you're there! Yes, the ivy's moving.  Georges, Georges darling, why do you keep me waiting? Catherine has gone.  I am all alone....\"    She had knelt down and was distractedly stretching out her shapely arms  covered with bangles which clashed with a metallic sound:    \"Georges!... Georges!...\"    Her every movement, the thrill of her voice, her whole being expressed  desire and love. Hortense, deeply touched, could not help saying:    \"How the poor thing loves him! If she but knew....\"    \"Ah!\" cried the girl. \"You've spoken. You're there, and you want me to come  to you, don't you? Here I am, Georges!...\"    She climbed over the window-ledge and began to run, while Renine went round  the wall and advanced to meet her.    She stopped short in front of him and stood choking at the sight of this  man and woman whom she did not know and who were stepping out of the very  shadow from which her beloved appeared to her each night.    Renine bowed, gave his name and introduced his companion:    \"Madame Hortense Daniel, a pupil and friend of your mother's.\"    Still motionless with stupefaction, her features drawn, she stammered:    \"You know who I am?... And you were there just now?... You heard what I  was saying ...?\"    Renine, without hesitating or pausing in his speech, said:    \"You are Rose Andree, the Happy Princess. We saw you on the films the other  evening; and circumstances led us to set out in search of you ... to Le  Havre, where you were abducted on the day when you were to have left for  America, and to the forest of Brotonne, where you were imprisoned.\"    She protested eagerly, with a forced laugh:    \"What is all this? I have not been to Le Havre. I came straight here.  Abducted? Imprisoned? What nonsense!\"    \"Yes, imprisoned, in the same cave as the Happy Princess; and you broke off  some branches to the right of the cave.\"    \"But how absurd! Who would have abducted me? I have no enemy.\"    \"There is a man in love with you: the one whom you were expecting just  now.\"    \"Yes, my lover,\" she said, proudly. \"Have I not the right to receive whom I  like?\"    \"You have the right; you are a free agent. But the man who comes to see you  every evening is wanted by the police. His name is Georges Dalbreque. He  killed Bourguet the jeweller.\"    The accusation made her start with indignation and she exclaimed:    \"It's a lie! An infamous fabrication of the newspapers! Georges was in  Paris on the night of the murder. He can prove it.\"    \"He stole a motor car and forty thousand francs in notes.\"    She retorted vehemently:    \"The motor-car was taken back by his friends and the notes will be  restored. He never touched them. My leaving for America had made him lose  his head.\"    \"Very well. I am quite willing to believe everything that you say. But the  police may show less faith in these statements and less indulgence.\"    She became suddenly uneasy and faltered:    \"The police.... There's nothing to fear from them.... They won't know....\"    \"Where to find him? I succeeded, at all events. He's working as a  woodcutter, in the forest of Brotonne.\"    \"Yes, but ... you ... that was an accident ... whereas the police....\"    The words left her lips with the greatest difficulty. Her voice was  trembling. And suddenly she rushed at Renine, stammering:    \"He is arrested?... I am sure of it!... And you have come to tell me....  Arrested! Wounded! Dead perhaps?... Oh, please, please!...\"    She had no strength left. All her pride, all the certainty of her great  love gave way to an immense despair and she sobbed out.    \"No, he's not dead, is he? No, I feel that he's not dead. Oh, sir, how  unjust it all is! He's the gentlest man, the best that ever lived. He has  changed my whole life."]]]
