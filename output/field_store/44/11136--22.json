Next morning Steelman was sitting beside Brown's bed with a saucer of  vinegar, some brown paper, a raw beef-steak, and a bottle of soda.    \"Well, what have you got to say for yourself now, Brown?\" he said,  sternly. \"Ain't you jolly well ashamed of yourself to come home in the  beastly state you did last night, and insult a guest in your house, to  say nothing of an old friend--and perhaps the best friend you ever had,  if you only knew it? Anybody else would have given you in charge and got  you three months for the assault. You ought to have some consideration  for your wife and children, and your own character--even if you haven't  any for your old mate's feelings. Here, drink this, and let me fix you  up a bit; the missus has got the breakfast waiting.\"        DRIFTED BACK        The stranger walked into the corner grocery with the air of one who had  come back after many years to see someone who would be glad to see him.  He shed his swag and stood it by the wall with great deliberation;  then he rested his elbow on the counter, stroked his beard, and grinned  quizzically at the shopman, who smiled back presently in a puzzled way.    \"Good afternoon,\" said the grocer.    \"Good afternoon.\"    Pause.    \"Nice day,\" said the grocer.    Pause.    \"Anything I can do for you?\"    \"Yes; tell the old man there's a chap wants to speak to him for a  minute.\"    \"Old man? What old man?\"    \"Hake, of course--old Ben Hake! Ain't he in?\"    The grocer smiled.    \"Hake ain't here now. I'm here.\"    \"How's that?\"    \"Why, he sold out to me ten years ago.\"    \"Well, I suppose I'll find him somewhere about town?\"    \"I don't think you will. He left Australia when he sold out. He's--he's  dead now.\"    \"Dead! Old Ben Hake?\"    \"Yes. You knew him, then?\"    The stranger seemed to have lost a great deal of his assurance. He  turned his side to the counter, hooked his elbow on it, and gazed out  through the door along Sunset Track.    \"You can give me half a pound of nailrod,\" he said, in a quiet tone--\"I  s'pose young Hake is in town?\"    \"No; the whole family went away. I think there's one of the sons in  business in Sydney now.\"    \"I s'pose the M'Lachlans are here yet?\"    \"No; they are not. The old people died about five years ago; the sons  are in Queensland, I think; and both the girls are married and in  Sydney.\"    \"Ah, well!... I see you've got the railway here now.\"    \"Oh, yes! Six years.\"    \"Times is changed a lot.\"    \"They are.\"    \"I s'pose--I s'pose you can tell me where I'll find old Jimmy Nowlett?\"    \"Jimmy Nowlett? Jimmy Nowlett? I never heard of the name. What was he?\"    \"Oh, he was a bullock-driver. Used to carry from the mountains before  the railway was made.\"    \"Before my time, perhaps. There's no one of that name round here now.\"    \"Ah, well!... I don't suppose you knew the Duggans?\"    \"Yes, I did. The old man's dead, too, and the family's gone away--Lord  knows where. They weren't much loss, to all accounts. The sons got into  trouble, I b'lieve--went to the bad. They had a bad name here.\"    \"Did they? Well, they had good hearts--at least, old Malachi Duggan and  the eldest son had.... You can give me a couple of pounds of sugar.\"    \"Right. I suppose it's a long time since you were here last?\"    \"Fifteen years.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"Yes. I don't s'pose I remind you of anyone you know around here?\"    \"N--no!\" said the grocer with a smile. \"I can't say you do.\"    \"Ah, well! I s'pose I'll find the Wilds still living in the same place?\"    \"The Wilds? Well, no. The old man is dead, too, and--\"    \"And--and where's Jim? He ain't dead?\"    \"No; he's married and settled down in Sydney.\"    Long pause.    \"Can you--\" said the stranger, hesitatingly; \"did you--I suppose you  knew Mary--Mary Wild?\"    \"Mary?\" said the grocer, smilingly. \"That was my wife's maiden name.  Would you like to see her?\"    \"No, no! She mightn't remember me!\"    He reached hastily for his swag, and shouldered it.    \"Well, I must be gettin' on.\"    \"I s'pose you'll camp here over Christmas?\"    \"No; there's nothing to stop here for--I'll push on. I did intend  to have a Christmas here--in fact, I came a long way out of my road  a-purpose.... I meant to have just one more Christmas with old Ben Hake  an' the rest of the boys--but I didn't know as they'd moved on so far  west. The old bush school is dyin' out.\"    There was a smile in his eyes, but his bearded lips twitched a little.    \"Things is changed. The old houses is pretty much the same, an' the old  signs want touchin' up and paintin' jest as had as ever; an' there's  that old palin' fence that me an' Ben Hake an' Jimmy Nowlett put up  twenty year ago. I've tramped and travelled long ways since then. But  things is changed--at least, people is.... Well, I must be goin'. There's  nothing to keep me here. I'll push on and get into my track again. It's  cooler travellin' in the night.\"    \"Yes, it's been pretty hot to-day.\"    \"Yes, it has. Well, s'long.\"    \"Good day. Merry Christmas!\"    \"Eh? What? Oh, yes! Same to you! S'long!\"    \"Good day!\" He drifted out and away along Sunset Track.          REMAILED        There is an old custom prevalent in Australasia--and other parts, too,  perhaps, for that matter--which, we think, deserves to be written up.  It might not be an \"honoured\" custom from a newspaper manager's or  proprietor's point of view, or from the point of view (if any)  occupied by the shareholders on the subject; but, nevertheless, it is  a time-honoured and a good old custom. Perhaps, for several reasons,  it was more prevalent among diggers than with the comparatively settled  bushmen of to-day--the poor, hopeless, wandering swaggy doesn't count  in the matter, for he has neither the wherewithal nor the opportunity  to honour the old custom; also his movements are too sadly uncertain  to permit of his being honoured by it. We refer to the remailing of  newspapers and journals from one mate to another.    Bill gets his paper and reads it through conscientiously from beginning  to end by candle or slush-lamp as he lies on his back in the hut or tent  with his pipe in his mouth; or, better still, on a Sunday afternoon as  he reclines on the grass in the shade, in all the glory and comfort of  a clean pair of moleskins and socks and a clean shirt. And when he has  finished reading the paper--if it is not immediately bespoke--he turns  it right side out, folds it, and puts it away where he'll know where to  find it. The paper is generally bespoke in the following manner:    \"Let's have a look at that paper after you, Bill, when yer done with  it,\" says Jack.    And Bill says:    \"I just promised it to Bob. You can get it after him.\"    And, when it is finally lent, Bill says:    \"Don't forget to give that paper back to me when yer done with it. Don't  let any of those other blanks get holt of it, or the chances are I won't  set eyes on it again.\"    But the other blanks get it in their turn after being referred to Bill.  \"You must ask Bill,\" says Jack to the next blank, \"I got it from him.\"  And when Bill gets his paper back finally--which is often only after  much bush grumbling, accusation, recrimination, and denial--he severely  and carefully re-arranges theme pages, folds the paper, and sticks it  away up over a rafter, or behind a post or batten, or under his pillow  where it will safe. He wants that paper to send to Jim.    Bill is but an indifferent hand at folding, and knows little or nothing  about wrappers. He folds and re-folds the paper several times and in  various ways, but the first result is often the best, and is finally  adopted. The parcel looks more ugly than neat; but Bill puts a weight  upon it so that it won't fly open, and looks round for a piece of string  to tie it with. Sometimes he ties it firmly round the middle, sometimes  at both ends; at other times he runs the string down inside the folds  and ties it that way, or both ways, or all the ways, so as to be sure it  won't come undone--which it doesn't as a rule. If he can't find a piece  of string long enough, he ties two bits together, and submits the result  to a rather severe test; and if the string is too thin, or he has to use  thread, he doubles it. Then he worries round to find out who has got the  ink, or whether anyone has seen anything of the pen; and when he gets  them, he writes the address with painful exactitude on the margin of the  paper, sometimes in two or three places. He has to think a moment before  he writes; and perhaps he'll scratch the back of his head afterwards  with an inky finger, and regard the address with a sort of mild, passive  surprise. His old mate Jim was always plain Jim to him, and nothing  else; but, in order to reach Jim, this paper has to be addressed to--        MR JAMES MITCHELL,      c/o J.  W.  Dowell, Esq.,      Munnigrub Station--    and so on. \"Mitchell\" seems strange--Bill couldn't think of it for the  moment--and so does \"James.\"    And, a week or so later, over on Coolgardie, or away up in northern  Queensland, or bush-felling down in Maoriland, Jim takes a stroll up to  the post office after tea on mail night. He doesn't expect any letters,  but there might be a paper from Bill. Bill generally sends him a  newspaper. They seldom write to each other, these old mates.    There were points, of course, upon which Bill and Jim couldn't  agree--subjects upon which they argued long and loud and often in the  old days; and it sometimes happens that Bill across an article or a  paragraph which agrees with and, so to speak, barracks for a pet theory  of his as against one held by Jim; and Bill marks it with a chuckle and  four crosses at the corners--and an extra one at each side perhaps--and  sends it on to Jim; he reckons it'll rather corner old Jim. The crosses  are not over ornamental nor artistic, but very distinct; Jim sees them  from the reverse side of the sheet first, maybe, and turns it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7188"],[0,"Higher Lessons in English: A work on English grammar and composition (#17)"],[1,"the interest that the Ruth of the Bible awakens in us      this allusion gathers about so common a thing as memory.]           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 48.

ARRANGEMENT--USUAL ORDER.    TO THE TEACHER.--If, from lack of time or from the necessity of conforming  to a prescribed course of study, it is found desirable to abridge these  Lessons on Arrangement and Contraction, the exercises to be written may be  omitted, and the pupil may be required to illustrate the positions of the  different parts, in both the Usual and the Transposed order, and then to  read the examples given, making the required changes orally.    The eight following Lessons may thus be reduced to two or three.    Let us recall the +Usual Order+ of words and phrases in a simple  declarative sentence.    The verb follows the subject, and the object complement follows the verb.    +Example+.--_Drake circumnavigated the globe_.    +Direction+.--_Observing this order, write three sentences each with an  object complement._    An adjective or a possessive modifier precedes its noun, and an explanatory  modifier follows it.    +Examples+.--_Man's life is a brief span. Moses, the lawgiver_, came down  from the Mount.    +Direction+.--_Observing this order, write four sentences, two with  possessive modifiers and two with explanatory, each sentence containing an  adjective._    The attribute complement, whether noun or adjective, follows the verb, the  objective complement follows the object complement, and the indirect object  precedes the direct.    +Examples+.--Egypt _is the valley_ of the Nile. Eastern life _is dreamy_.  They made _Bonaparte consul_. They offered _Caesar a crown_.    +Direction+.--_Observing this order, write four sentences illustrating the  positions of the noun and of the adjective when they perform these  offices_.    If adjectives are of unequal rank, the one most closely modifying the noun  stands nearest to it; if of the same rank, they stand in the order of their  length--the shortest first.    +Examples+.--_Two honest young_ men enlisted. Cassino has a _lean_ and  _hungry_ look. A rock, _huge_ and _precipitous_, stood in our path.    +Direction+.--_Observing this order, write three sentences illustrating the  relative position of adjectives before and after the noun_.    An adverb precedes the adjective, the adverb, or the phrase which it  modifies; precedes or follows (more frequently follows) the simple verb or  the verb with its complement; and follows one or more words of the verb if  the verb is compound.    +Examples+.--The light _far in the distance_ is _so very bright_. I _soon  found him_. I _hurt him badly_. He _had often been there_.    +Direction+.--_Observing this order, write sentences illustrating these  several positions of the adverb_.    Phrases follow the words they modify; if a word has two or more phrases,  those most closely modifying it stand nearest to it.    +Examples+.--_Facts once established_ are facts forever. He _sailed for  Liverpool on Monday_.    +Direction+.--_Observing this order, write sentences illustrating the  positions of participle and prepositional phrases_.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 52.    ARRANGEMENT--TRANSPOSED ORDER.    +Introductory Hints+.--The usual order of words, spoken of in the preceding  Lesson, is not the only order admissible in an English sentence; on the  contrary, great freedom in the placing of words and phrases is sometimes  allowable. Let the relation of the words be kept obvious and, consequently,  the thought clear, and in poetry, in impassioned oratory, in excited speech  of any kind, one may deviate widely from this order.    A writer's meaning is never distributed evenly among his words; more of it  lies in some words than in others. Under the influence of strong feeling,  one may move words out of their accustomed place, and, by thus attracting  attention to them, give them additional importance to the reader or hearer.    When any word or phrase in the predicate stands out of its usual place,  appearing either at the front of the sentence or at the end, we have what  we may call the +Transposed Order+. _I dare not venture to go down into the  cabin--Venture to go down into the cabin I dare not. You shall die--Die you  shall. Their names will forever live on the lips of the people--Their names  will, on the lips of the people, forever live_.    When the word or phrase moved to the front carries the verb, or the  principal word of it, before the subject, we have the extreme example of  the transposed order; as, _A yeoman had he. Strange is the magic of a  turban._ The whole of a verb is not placed at the beginning of a  declarative sentence except in poetry; as, _Flashed all their sabers bare_.    TO THE TEACHER.----Where, in our directions in these Lessons on Arrangement  and Contraction, we say _change, transpose_, or _restore_, the pupils need  not write the sentences. They should study them and be able to read them.  Require them to show what the sentence has lost or gained in the change.    +Direction+.--_Change these sentences from the usual to the transposed  order by moving words or phrases to the front, and explain the effect_:--    1. He could not avoid it.  2. They were pretty lads.  3. The great Queen died in the year 1603.  4. He would not escape.  5. I must go.  6. She seemed young and sad.  7. He cried, \"My son, my son!\"  8. He ended his tale here.  9. The moon shone bright.  10. A frozen continent lies beyond the sea.  11. He was a contentious man.  12. It was quoted so.  13. Monmouth had never been accused of cowardice.    +Direction+.--_Change these sentences from the transposed order to the  usual, and explain the effect_:--    1. Him, the Almighty Power hurled headlong.  2. Volatile he was.  3. Victories, indeed, they were.  4. Of noble race the lady came.  5. Slowly and sadly we laid him down.  6. Once again we'll sleep secure.  7. This double office the participle performs.  8. That gale I well remember.  9. Churlish he often seemed.  10. One strong thing I find here below.  11. Overhead I heard a murmur.  12. To their will we must succumb.  13. Him they hanged.  14. Freely ye have received.    +Direction+.--_Write five sentences, each with one of the following nouns  or adjectives as a complement; and five, each with one of the adverbs or  phrases as predicate modifier; then transpose the ten with these same words  moved to the front, and explain the effect_:--    Giant, character, happy, him, serene, often, in the market, long and  deeply, then, under foot.    +Direction+.--_Transpose these sentences by placing the italicized words  last, and note the effect_:--    1. The clouds lowering upon our house are _buried_ in the deep bosom of the     ocean.  2. Aeneas did _bear_ from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder the old     Anchises.  3. Such a heart _beats_ in the breast of my people.  4. The great fire _roared_ up the deep and wide chimney.    +Direction+.--_Change these to the usual order_:--    1. No woman was ever in this wild humor wooed and won.  2. Let a shroud, stripped from some privileged corpse, be, for its proper     price, displayed.  3. An old clock, early one summer's morning, before the stirring of the     family, suddenly stopped.  4. Treasures of gold and of silver are, in the deep bosom of the earth,     concealed.  5. Ease and grace in writing are, of all the acquisitions made in school,     the most difficult and valuable.    +Direction+.--_Write three sentences, each with the following noun or  adjective or phrase in its usual "]]]
