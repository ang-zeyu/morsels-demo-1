Let us put a complex entree  into a simple old gentleman; let us not put a simple entree into a  complex old gentleman.  So long as human society will leave my  spiritual inside alone, I will allow it, with a comparative submission,  to work its wild will with my physical interior.  I will submit to  cigars. I will meekly embrace a bottle of Burgundy.  I will humble  myself to a hansom cab.  If only by this means I may preserve to myself  the virginity of the spirit, which enjoys with astonishment and fear. I  do not say that these are the only methods of preserving it. I incline  to the belief that there are others.  But I will have nothing to do  with simplicity which lacks the fear, the astonishment, and the joy  alike.  I will have nothing to do with the devilish vision of a child  who is too simple to like toys.    The child is, indeed, in these, and many other matters, the best guide.  And in nothing is the child so righteously childlike, in nothing does  he exhibit more accurately the sounder order of simplicity, than in the  fact that he sees everything with a simple pleasure, even the complex  things.  The false type of naturalness harps always on the distinction  between the natural and the artificial. The higher kind of naturalness  ignores that distinction. To the child the tree and the lamp-post are  as natural and as artificial as each other; or rather, neither of them  are natural but both supernatural.  For both are splendid and  unexplained. The flower with which God crowns the one, and the flame  with which Sam the lamplighter crowns the other, are equally of the  gold of fairy-tales. In the middle of the wildest fields the most  rustic child is, ten to one, playing at steam-engines. And the only  spiritual or philosophical objection to steam-engines is not that men  pay for them or work at them, or make them very ugly, or even that men  are killed by them; but merely that men do not play at them. The evil  is that the childish poetry of clockwork does not remain. The wrong is  not that engines are too much admired, but that they are not admired  enough.  The sin is not that engines are mechanical, but that men are  mechanical.    In this matter, then, as in all the other matters treated in this book,  our main conclusion is that it is a fundamental point of view, a  philosophy or religion which is needed, and not any change in habit or  social routine.  The things we need most for immediate practical  purposes are all abstractions.  We need a right view of the human lot,  a right view of the human society; and if we were living eagerly and  angrily in the enthusiasm of those things, we should, ipso facto, be  living simply in the genuine and spiritual sense. Desire and danger  make every one simple.  And to those who talk to us with interfering  eloquence about Jaeger and the pores of the skin, and about Plasmon and  the coats of the stomach, at them shall only be hurled the words that  are hurled at fops and gluttons, \"Take no thought what ye shall eat or  what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be clothed.  For after all  these things do the Gentiles seek. But seek first the kingdom of God  and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.\"  Those amazing words are not only extraordinarily good, practical  politics; they are also superlatively good hygiene.  The one supreme  way of making all those processes go right, the processes of health,  and strength, and grace, and beauty, the one and only way of making  certain of their accuracy, is to think about something else. If a man  is bent on climbing into the seventh heaven, he may be quite easy about  the pores of his skin.  If he harnesses his waggon to a star, the  process will have a most satisfactory effect upon the coats of his  stomach.  For the thing called \"taking thought,\" the thing for which  the best modern word is \"rationalizing,\" is in its nature, inapplicable  to all plain and urgent things. Men take thought and ponder  rationalistically, touching remote things--things that only  theoretically matter, such as the transit of Venus. But only at their  peril can men rationalize about so practical a matter as health.        XI Science and the Savages    A permanent disadvantage of the study of folk-lore and kindred subjects  is that the man of science can hardly be in the nature of things very  frequently a man of the world.  He is a student of nature; he is  scarcely ever a student of human nature. And even where this difficulty  is overcome, and he is in some sense a student of human nature, this is  only a very faint beginning of the painful progress towards being  human.  For the study of primitive race and religion stands apart in  one important respect from all, or nearly all, the ordinary scientific  studies. A man can understand astronomy only by being an astronomer; he  can understand entomology only by being an entomologist (or, perhaps,  an insect); but he can understand a great deal of anthropology merely  by being a man.  He is himself the animal which he studies. Hence  arises the fact which strikes the eye everywhere in the records of  ethnology and folk-lore--the fact that the same frigid and detached  spirit which leads to success in the study of astronomy or botany leads  to disaster in the study of mythology or human origins. It is necessary  to cease to be a man in order to do justice to a microbe; it is not  necessary to cease to be a man in order to do justice to men.  That  same suppression of sympathies, that same waving away of intuitions or  guess-work which make a man preternaturally clever in dealing with the  stomach of a spider, will make him preternaturally stupid in dealing  with the heart of man. He is making himself inhuman in order to  understand humanity. An ignorance of the other world is boasted by many  men of science; but in this matter their defect arises, not from  ignorance of the other world, but from ignorance of this world.  For  the secrets about which anthropologists concern themselves can be best  learnt, not from books or voyages, but from the ordinary commerce of  man with man. The secret of why some savage tribe worships monkeys or  the moon is not to be found even by travelling among those savages and  taking down their answers in a note-book, although the cleverest man  may pursue this course.  The answer to the riddle is in England; it is  in London; nay, it is in his own heart.  When a man has discovered why  men in Bond Street wear black hats he will at the same moment have  discovered why men in Timbuctoo wear red feathers. The mystery in the  heart of some savage war-dance should not be studied in books of  scientific travel; it should be studied at a subscription ball.  If a  man desires to find out the origins of religions, let him not go to the  Sandwich Islands; let him go to church. If a man wishes to know the  origin of human society, to know what society, philosophically  speaking, really is, let him not go into the British Museum; let him go  into society.    This total misunderstanding of the real nature of ceremonial gives rise  to the most awkward and dehumanized versions of the conduct of men in  rude lands or ages.  The man of science, not realizing that ceremonial  is essentially a thing which is done without a reason, has to find a  reason for every sort of ceremonial, and, as might be supposed, the  reason is generally a very absurd one--absurd because it originates not  in the simple mind of the barbarian, but in the sophisticated mind of  the professor.  The teamed man will say, for instance, \"The natives of  Mumbojumbo Land believe that the dead man can eat and will require food  upon his journey to the other world.  This is attested by the fact that  they place food in the grave, and that any family not complying with  this rite is the object of the anger of the priests and the tribe.\" To  any one acquainted with humanity this way of talking is topsy-turvy. It  is like saying, \"The English in the twentieth century believed that a  dead man could smell.  This is attested by the fact that they always  covered his grave with lilies, violets, or other flowers. Some priestly  and tribal terrors were evidently attached to the neglect of this  action, as we have records of several old ladies who were very much  disturbed in mind because their wreaths had not arrived in time for the  funeral.\"  It may be of course that savages put food with a dead man  because they think that a dead man can eat, or weapons with a dead man  because they think that a dead man can fight. But personally I do not  believe that they think anything of the kind. I believe they put food  or weapons on the dead for the same reason that we put flowers, because  it is an exceedingly natural and obvious thing to do.  We do not  understand, it is true, the emotion which makes us think it obvious and  natural; but that is because, like all the important emotions of human  existence it is essentially irrational.  We do not understand the  savage for the same reason that the savage does not understand himself.  And the savage does not understand himself for the same reason that we  do not understand ourselves either.    The obvious truth is that the moment any matter has passed through the  human mind it is finally and for ever spoilt for all purposes of  science.  It has become a thing incurably mysterious and infinite; this  mortal has put on immortality.  Even what we call our material desires  are spiritual, because they are human. Science can analyse a pork-chop,  and say how much of it is phosphorus and how much is protein; but  science cannot analyse any man's wish for a pork-chop, and say how much  of it is hunger, how much custom, how much nervous fancy, how much a  haunting love of the beautiful.  The man's desire for the pork-chop  remains literally as mystical and ethereal as his desire for heaven."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47109"],[0,"Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F. Smith (#17)"],[1,"created all things, is limited in his  dominion over earthly things to the capacities of mortal men.--_Apr. C.  R.,_ 1914, p. 4.    MISFORTUNE AND EVIL NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WILL OF GOD. We have it  enunciated in the revelations to Joseph the Prophet, in the Book of  Doctrine and Covenants, that the Lord is greatly displeased only with  those who do not confess or acknowledge \"his hand in all things, and  obey not his commandments.\" Many things occur in the world in which  it seems very difficult for most of us to find a solid reason for the  acknowledgment of the hand of the Lord. I have come to the belief  that the only reason I have been able to discover by which we should  acknowledge the band of God in some occurrences is the fact that the  thing which has occurred has been permitted of the Lord. When two men  give way to their passions, their selfishness and anger, to contend  and quarrel with each other, and this quarrel and contention leads  to physical strife and violence between them, it has been difficult  for me to discover the hand of the Lord {70} in that transaction;  other than that the men who thus disagree, quarrel and contend with  each other, have received from God the freedom of their own agency to  exercise their own intelligence, to judge between the right and wrong  for themselves, and to act according to their own desire. The Lord  did not design or purpose that these two men should quarrel, or give  way to their anger to such an extent that it would lead to violence  between them, and, perhaps, to bloodshed. God has never designed such  a thing as that, nor can we charge such things to the Almighty. People  become sick, suffer pain, sorrow and anguish. They linger for months,  and perhaps for years, in feebleness of body and of mind. The question  arises in them: Why does the Lord suffer it? Is the hand of God in that  suffering? Has God designed persons to suffer? Has he touched them  with his hand of affliction? Has he caused the evil that has come to  them? Too many of us are inclined to think, or lean toward the feeble  thought, that the illness that comes to us, the afflictions that we  suffer, the accidents that we meet with in life, and the troubles that  beset us on our way in the journey of life, are attributable either  to the mercy or the displeasure of God. Sometimes we are prone to  charge God with causing our afflictions and our troubles; but if we  could see as God sees, if we could understand as he understands, if  we could trace the effects back to the cause, and that truly, by the  spirit of correct understanding, we would unquestionably discover that  our troubles, or suffering, or affliction are the result of our own  indiscretion or lack of knowledge, or of wisdom. It was not the band  of God that put affliction and trouble upon us. The agency that he has  given to us left us to act for ourselves--to do things if we will that  are not right, that are contrary to the laws of life and health, that  are not wise or prudent--and the results may be serious to us, because  of our ignorance or of our determination to persist in that which we  desire, rather than {71} to yield to the requirements which God makes  of us.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol. 20, p. 821, July, 1917.    GOD'S WARFARE. God is the greatest man of war of all, and his Son is  next to him, and their warfare is for the salvation of the souls of  men. It would not be necessary for them to use violence or force,  nor to permit their children to use violence nor force in order to  conquer if they would but humble themselves, and obey the truth. For,  after all, nothing will conquer, nothing will win but the truth; and  so far as the wars that are going on in the world are concerned, we  not only want to see peace established among the children of men, but  also justice, but above all things, truth, that justice, peace and  righteousness may be built upon this foundation and not depend upon  the covetousness, pride, vanity, evil desire, and just for power in  man.--_Oct. C. R.,_ 1914, p. 129.    WE ARE IN GOD'S IMAGE. When Brother Penrose shall pray, he will pray  unto the Father of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in whose image  and likeness we are made, or were born into the world, and in whose  likeness and image we are, for we are God's children, and therefore  must resemble his Son in person, and also spiritually, so far as we  will obey the principles of the gospel of eternal truth. For, we were  foreordained and predestined to become conformed to his likeness  through the wise and proper use of our free agency.--_Oct. C. R.,_  1914, p. 8.    GOD'S REST. The ancient prophets speak of \"entering into God's rest;\"  what does it mean? To my mind, it means entering into the knowledge  and love of God, having faith in his purpose and in his plan, to such  an extent that we know we are right, and that we are not hunting for  something else, we are not disturbed by every wind of doctrine, or by  the cunning and craftiness of men who lie in wait to deceive. We know  of the doctrine that it is of God, and we do not ask any questions of  anybody about it; they are welcome to {72} their opinions, to their  ideas and to their vagaries. The man who has reached that degree of  faith in God that all doubt and fear have been cast from him, he has  entered into \"God's rest,\" and he need not fear the vagaries of men,  nor their cunning and craftiness, by which they seek to deceive and  mislead him from the truth. I pray that we may all enter into God's  rest--rest from doubt, from fear, from apprehension of danger, rest  from the religious turmoil of the world; from the cry that is going  forth, here and there--lo, here is Christ; lo, there is Christ; lo, he  is in the desert, come ye out to meet him. The man who has found God's  rest will not be disturbed by these vagaries of men, for the Lord has  told him, and does tell us: Go not out to seek them: Go not out to hunt  them; for when Christ shall come, he will come with the army of heaven  with him in the clouds of glory, and all eyes shall see him. We do not  need to be hunting for Christ here or Christ there, or prophets here  and prophets there.--_Oct. C. R.,_ 1909, p. 8.    IMPORTANCE OF BEING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. The one  thing now that I desire to impress upon the minds of my brethren  bearing the Holy Priesthood is that we should live so near to the  Lord, be so humble in our spirits, so tractable and pliable, under the  influence of the Holy Spirit, that we will be able to know the mind  and will of the Father concerning us as individuals and as officers  in the Church of Christ under all circumstances. And when we live so  that we can hear and understand the whisperings of the still, small  voice of the Spirit of God, let us do whatsoever that Spirit directs  without fear of the consequences. It does not make any difference  whether it meet the minds of carpers or critics, or of the enemies of  the kingdom of God, or not. Is it agreeable to the will of the Lord? Is  it compatible with the spirit of the great latter-day work in which we  are engaged? Is the end aimed at likely to advance the Church and to  strengthen it in the earth? If its {73} trend is in that direction, let  us do it, no matter what men may say or think.--_Oct. C. R.,_ 1903, p.  86.    HOLY GHOST, HOLY SPIRIT, COMFORTER. The Holy Ghost, who is a member of  the Trinity in the Godhead, has not a body of flesh and bones, like the  Father and the Son, but is a personage of Spirit. (Doc. and Cov., Sec.  130:22.)    The Holy Spirit, or Spirit of God, both of which terms are sometimes  used interchangeably with the Holy Ghost, is the influence of Deity,  the light of Christ, or of Truth, which proceeds forth from the  presence of God to fill the immensity of space, and to quicken the  understanding of men. (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 88:6-13.)    If a man is baptized and ordained to the Holy Priesthood, and is  called upon to perform duties which pertain to that priesthood, it  does not follow that he must always have the Holy Ghost in person  present with him when he performs his duty, but every righteous act  which he may perform legally will be in force and effect, and will be  acknowledged of God, and the more of the Spirit of God he possesses in  his ministrations, the better for himself, and those will not suffer  any loss unto whom he administers.    Therefore, the presentation or \"gift\" of the Holy Ghost simply confers  upon a man the right to receive at any time, when he is worthy of  it and desires it, the power and light of truth of the Holy Ghost,  although he may often be left to his own spirit and judgment.    The Holy Ghost as a personage of Spirit can no more be omnipresent  in person than can the Father or the Son, but by his intelligence,  his knowledge, his power and influence, over and through the laws of  nature, he is and can be omnipresent throughout all the works of God.  It is not the Holy Ghost who in person lighteth every man who is born  into the world, but it is the light of Christ, the Spirit of Truth,  which proceeds from the source of intelligence, which {74} permeates  all nature, which lighteth every man and fills the immensity of space.  You may call it the Spirit of God, you may call it the influence  of God's intelligence, you may call it the substance of his power,  no matter what it is called, it is the spirit of intelligence that  permeates the universe and gives to the spirits of men understanding,  just as job has said. (Job 32:8; Doc. and Cov. 88:3-13.)    Every elder of the Church who has received the Holy Ghost by the  laying on of hands, by one having authority, has power to confer that  gift upon another; it does not follow that a man who has received  the presentation or gift of the Holy Ghost shall always receive the  recognition and witness and presence of the Holy Ghost himself, or he  may receive all these, and yet the Holy Ghost"]]]
