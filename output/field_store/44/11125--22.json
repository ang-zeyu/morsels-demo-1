[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#17)"],[1,"I am.  I foresee that we shall make an ideal team. Together, we will toil  early and late till we whoop up this domestic journal into a shining  model of what a domestic journal should be. What that is, at present, I  do not exactly know. Excursion trains will be run from the Middle West  to see this domestic journal. Visitors from Oshkosh will do it before  going on to Grant's tomb. What exactly is your name?\"    Betty hesitated. Yes, perhaps it would be better. \"Brown,\" she said.    \"Mine is Smith. The smiling child in the outer office is Pugsy Maloney,  one of our most prominent citizens. Homely in appearance, perhaps, but  one of us. You will get to like Comrade Maloney. And now, to touch on a  painful subject--work. Would you care to start in now, or have you any  other engagements? Perhaps you wish to see the sights of this beautiful  little city before beginning? You would prefer to start in now?  Excellent. You could not have come at a more suitable time, for I was  on the very point of sallying out to purchase about twenty-five cents'  worth of lunch. We editors, Comrade Brown, find that our tissues need  constant restoration, such is the strenuous nature of our duties. You  will find one or two letters on that table. Good-by, then, for the  present.\"    He picked up his hat, smoothed it carefully and with a courtly  inclination of his head, left the room.    Betty sat down, and began to think. So she was really earning her own  living! It was a stimulating thought. She felt a little bewildered. She  had imagined something so different. Mrs. Oakley had certainly said  that _Peaceful Moments_ was a small paper, but despite that, her  imagination had conjured up visions of bustle and activity, and a  peremptory, overdriven editor, snapping out words of command. Smith,  with his careful speech and general air of calm detachment from the  noisy side of life, created an atmosphere of restfulness. If this was a  sample of life in the office, she thought, the paper had been well  named. She felt soothed and almost happy.    Interesting and exciting things, New York things, began to happen at  once. To her, meditating, there entered Pugsy Maloney, the guardian of  the gate of this shrine of Peace, a nonchalant youth of about fifteen,  with a freckled, mask-like face, the expression of which never varied,  bearing in his arms a cat. The cat was struggling violently, but he  appeared quite unconscious of it. Its existence did not seem to occur  to him.    \"Say!\" said Pugsy.    Betty was fond of cats.    \"Oh, don't hurt her!\" she cried anxiously.    Master Maloney eyed the cat as if he were seeing it for the first time.    \"I wasn't hoitin' her,\" he said, without emotion. \"Dere was two fresh  kids in the street sickin' a dawg on to her. And I comes up and says,  'G'wan! What do youse t'ink youse doin', fussin' de poor dumb animal?'  An' one of de guys, he says, 'G'wan! Who do youse t'ink youse is?' An'  I says, 'I'm de guy what's goin' to swat youse on de coco, smarty, if  youse don't quit fussin' de poor dumb animal.' So wit' dat he makes a  break at swattin' me one, but I swats him one, an' I swats de odder  feller one, an' den I swats dem bote some more, an' I gits de kitty,  an' I brings her in here, cos I t'inks maybe youse'll look after her. I  can't be boddered myself. Cats is foolishness.\"    And, having finished this Homeric narrative, Master Maloney fixed an  expressionless eye on the ceiling, and was silent.    \"How splendid of you, Pugsy!\" cried Betty. \"She might have been killed,  poor thing.\"    \"She had it pretty fierce,\" admitted Master Maloney, gazing  dispassionately at the rescued animal, which had escaped from his  clutch and taken up a strong position on an upper shelf of the  bookcase.    \"Will you go out and get her some milk, Pugsy? She's probably starving.  Here's a quarter. Will you keep the change?\"    \"Sure thing,\" assented Master Maloney.    He strolled slowly out, while Betty, mounting a chair, proceeded to  chirrup and snap her fingers in the effort to establish the foundations  of an _entente cordiale_ with the cat.    By the time Pugsy returned, carrying a five-cent bottle of milk, the  animal had vacated the shelf, and was sitting on the table, polishing  her face. The milk having been poured into the lid of a tobacco tin, in  lieu of a saucer, she suspended her operations and adjourned for  refreshments, Pugsy, having no immediate duties on hand, concentrated  himself on the cat.    \"Say!\" he said.    \"Well?\"    \"Dat kitty. Pipe de leather collar she's wearin'.\"    Betty had noticed earlier in the proceedings that a narrow leather  collar encircled the animal's neck.    \"Guess I know where dat kitty belongs. Dey all has dose collars. I  guess she's one of Bat Jarvis's kitties. He's got twenty-t'ree of dem,  and dey all has dose collars.\"    \"Bat Jarvis?\"    \"Sure.\"    \"Who is he?\"    Pugsy looked at her incredulously.    \"Say! Ain't youse never heard of Bat Jarvis? He's--he's Bat Jarvis.\"    \"Do you know him?\"    \"Sure, I knows him.\"    \"Does he live near here?\"    \"Sure, he lives near here.\"    \"Then I think the best thing for you to do is to run round and tell him  that I am taking care of his cat, and that he had better come and fetch  it. I must be getting on with my work, or I shall never finish it.\"    She settled down to type the letters Smith had indicated. She attacked  her task cautiously. She was one of those typists who are at their best  when they do not have to hurry.    She was putting the finishing touches to the last of the batch, when  there was a shuffling of feet in the outer room, followed by a knock on  the door. The next moment there entered a short, burly young man,  around whom there hung, like an aroma, an indescribable air of  toughness, partly due, perhaps, to the fact that he wore his hair in a  well-oiled fringe almost down to his eyebrows, thus presenting the  appearance of having no forehead at all. His eyes were small and set  close together. His mouth was wide, his jaw prominent. Not, in short,  the sort of man you would have picked out on sight as a model citizen.  He blinked furtively, as his eyes met Betty's, and looked round the  room. His face lighted up as he saw the cat.    \"Say!\" he said, stepping forward, and touching the cat's collar.  \"Ma'am, mine!\"    \"Are you Mr. Jarvis?\" asked Betty.    The visitor nodded, not without a touch of complacency, as of a monarch  abandoning his incognito.    For Mr. Jarvis was a celebrity.    By profession he was a dealer in animals, birds, and snakes. He had a  fancier's shop on Groome Street, in the heart of the Bowery. This was  on the ground floor. His living abode was in the upper story of that  house, and it was there that he kept the twenty-three cats whose necks  were adorned with leather collars.    But it was not the fact that he possessed twenty-three cats with  leather collars that had made Mr. Jarvis a celebrity. A man may win a  local reputation, if only for eccentricity, by such means. Mr. Jarvis'  reputation was far from being purely local. Broadway knew him, and the  Tenderloin. Tammany Hall knew him. Long Island City knew him. For Bat  Jarvis was the leader of the famous Groome Street Gang, the largest and  most influential of the four big gangs of the East Side.    To Betty, so little does the world often know of its greatest men, he  was merely a decidedly repellent-looking young man in unbecoming  clothes. But his evident affection for the cat gave her a feeling of  fellowship toward him. She beamed upon him, and Mr. Jarvis, who was  wont to face the glare of rivals without flinching, avoided her eye and  shuffled with embarrassment.    \"I'm so glad she's safe!\" said Betty. \"There were two boys teasing her  in the street. I've been giving her some milk.\"    Mr. Jarvis nodded, with his eyes on the floor.    There was a pause. Then he looked up, and, fixing his gaze some three  feet above her head, spoke.    \"Say!\" he said, and paused again. Betty waited expectantly.    He relaxed into silence again, apparently thinking.    \"Say!\" he said. \"Ma'am, obliged. Fond of de kit. I am.\"    \"She's a dear,\" said Betty, tickling the cat under the ear.    \"Ma'am,\" went on Mr. Jarvis, pursuing his theme, \"obliged. Sha'n't  fergit it. Any time you're in bad, glad to be of service. Bat Jarvis.  Groome Street. Anybody'll show youse where I live.\"    He paused, and shuffled his feet; then, tucking the cat more firmly  under his arm, left the room. Betty heard him shuffling downstairs.    He had hardly gone, when the door opened again, and Smith came in.    \"So you have had company while I was away?\" he said. \"Who was the  grandee with the cat? An old childhood's friend? Was he trying to sell  the animal to us?\"    \"That was Mr. Bat Jarvis,\" said Betty.    Smith looked interested.    \"Bat! What was he doing here?\"    Betty related the story of the cat. Smith nodded thoughtfully.    \"Well,\" he said, \"I don't know that Comrade Jarvis is precisely the  sort of friend I would go out of my way to select. Still, you never  know what might happen. He might come in useful. And now, let us  concentrate ourselves tensely on this very entertaining little journal  of ours, and see if we cannot stagger humanity with it.\"          CHAPTER XIV    A CHANGE OF POLICY      The feeling of tranquillity which had come to Betty on her first  acquaintance with _Peaceful Moments_ seemed to deepen as the days  went by, and with each day she found the sharp pain at her heart less  vehement. It was still there, but it was dulled. The novelty of her  life and surroundings kept it in check. New York is an egotist. It will  suffer no divided attention. \"Look at me!\" says the voice of the city  imperiously, and its children obey. It snatches their thoughts from  their inner griefs, and concentrates them on the pageant that rolls  unceasingly from one end of the island to the other. One may despair in  New York, but it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6980"],[0,"Tales of St. Austin's (#17)"],[1,"late Macbeth, the cat i' the adage, and numerous other  celebrities. She evidently had plenty of remarks to make on the subject  in hand, but refrained from motives of prudence.    Charteris had no such scruples. The feeling of fatigue that had been  upon him had vanished, and his temper, which had been growing steadily  worse for some twenty minutes, now boiled over gleefully at the  prospect of something solid to work itself off upon. Even without a  cause Charteris detested the Rural Hooligan. Now that a real,  copper-bottomed motive for this dislike had been supplied to him, he  felt himself capable of dealing with a whole regiment of the breed. The  criminal with the bicycle had just let it fall with a crash to the  ground when Charteris went for him low, in the style which the Babe  always insisted on seeing in members of the First Fifteen on the  football field, and hove him without comment into a damp ditch.  'Charles his friend' uttered a shout of disapproval and rushed into the  fray. Charteris gave him the straight left, of the type to which the  great John Jackson is reported to have owed so much in the days of the  old Prize Ring, and Charles, taking it between the eyes, stopped in a  discouraged and discontented manner, and began to rub the place.  Whereupon Charteris dashed in, and, to use an expression suitable to  the deed, 'swung his right at the mark'. The 'mark', it may be  explained for the benefit of the non-pugilistic, is that portion of the  anatomy which lies hid behind the third button of the human waistcoat.  It covers--in a most inadequate way--the wind, and even a gentle tap in  the locality is apt to produce a fleeting sense of discomfort. A  genuine flush hit on the spot, shrewdly administered by a muscular arm  with the weight of the body behind it, causes the passive agent in the  transaction to wish fervently, as far as he is at the moment physically  capable of wishing anything, that he had never been born. 'Charles his  friend' collapsed like an empty sack, and Charteris, getting a grip of  the outlying portions of his costume, dragged him to the ditch and  rolled him in on top of his friend, who had just recovered sufficiently  to be thinking about getting out again. The pair of them lay there in a  tangled heap. Charteris picked up the bicycle and gave it a cursory  examination. The enamel was a good deal scratched, but no material  damage had been done. He wheeled it across to its owner.    'It isn't much hurt,' he said, as they walked on slowly together. 'Bit  scratched, that's all.'    'Thanks _awfully_,' said the small lady.    'Oh, not at all,' replied Charteris. 'I enjoyed it.' (He felt he had  said the right thing there. Your real hero always 'enjoys it'.) 'I'm  sorry those bargees frightened you.'    'They did rather. But'--she added triumphantly after a pause--'I didn't  cry.'    'Rather not,' said Charteris. 'You were awfully plucky. I noticed. But  hadn't you better ride on? Which way were you going?'    'I wanted to get to Stapleton.'    'Oh. That's simple enough. You've merely got to go straight on down  this road, as straight as ever you can go. But, look here, you know,  you shouldn't be out alone like this. It isn't safe. Why did they let  you?'    The lady avoided his eye. She bent down and inspected the left pedal.    'They shouldn't have sent you out alone,' said Charteris, 'why did  they?'    'They--they didn't. I came.'    There was a world of meaning in the phrase. Charteris felt that he was  in the same case. They had not let _him_. He had come. Here was a  kindred spirit, another revolutionary soul, scorning the fetters of  convention and the so-called authority of self-constituted rules, aha!  Bureaucrats!    'Shake hands,' he said, 'I'm in just the same way.'    They shook hands gravely.    'You know,' said the lady, 'I'm awfully sorry I did it now. It was very  naughty.'    'I'm not sorry yet,' said Charteris, 'I'm rather glad than otherwise.  But I expect I shall be sorry before long.'    'Will you be sent to bed?'    'I don't think so.'    'Will you have to learn beastly poetry?'    'Probably not.'    She looked at him curiously, as if to enquire, 'then if you won't have  to learn poetry and you won't get sent to bed, what on earth is there  for you to worry about?'    She would probably have gone on to investigate the problem further, but  at that moment there came the sound of a whistle. Then another, closer  this time. Then a faint rumbling, which increased in volume steadily.  Charteris looked back. The railway line ran by the side of the road. He  could see the smoke of a train through the trees. It was quite close  now, and coming closer every minute, and he was still quite a hundred  and fifty yards from the station gates.    'I say,' he cried. 'Great Scott, here comes my train. I must rush.  Good-bye. You keep straight on.'    His legs had had time to grow stiff again. For the first few strides  running was painful. But his joints soon adapted themselves to the  strain, and in ten seconds he was sprinting as fast as he had ever  sprinted off the running-track. When he had travelled a quarter of the  distance the small cyclist overtook him.    'Be quick,' she said, 'it's just in sight.'    Charteris quickened his stride, and, paced by the bicycle, spun along  in fine style. Forty yards from the station the train passed him. He  saw it roll into the station. There were still twenty yards to go,  exclusive of the station's steps, and he was already running as fast as  it lay in him to run. Now there were only ten. Now five. And at last,  with a hurried farewell to his companion, he bounded up the steps and  on to the platform. At the end of the platform the line took a sharp  curve to the left. Round that curve the tail end of the guard's van was  just disappearing.    'Missed it, sir,' said the solitary porter, who managed things at  Rutton, cheerfully. He spoke as if he was congratulating Charteris on  having done something remarkably clever.    'When's the next?' panted Charteris.    'Eight-thirty,' was the porter's appalling reply.    For a moment Charteris felt quite ill. No train till eight-thirty! Then  was he indeed lost. But it couldn't be true. There must be some sort of  a train between now and then.    'Are you certain?' he said. 'Surely there's a train before that?'    'Why, yes, sir,' said the porter gleefully, 'but they be all exprusses.  Eight-thirty be the only 'un what starps at Rootton.'    'Thanks,' said Charteris with marked gloom, 'I don't think that'll be  much good to me. My aunt, what a hole I'm in.'     The porter made a sympathetic and interrogative noise at the back of  his throat, as if inviting him to explain everything. But Charteris  felt unequal to conversation. There are moments when one wants to be  alone. He went down the steps again. When he got out into the road, his  small cycling friend had vanished. Charteris was conscious of a feeling  of envy towards her. She was doing the journey comfortably on a  bicycle. He would have to walk it. Walk it! He didn't believe he could.  The strangers' mile, followed by the Homeric combat with the two  Hooligans and that ghastly sprint to wind up with, had left him  decidedly unfit for further feats of pedestrianism. And it was eight  miles to Stapleton, if it was a yard, and another mile from Stapleton  to St Austin's. Charteris, having once more invoked the name of his  aunt, pulled himself together with an effort, and limped gallantly on  in the direction of Stapleton. But fate, so long hostile to him, at  last relented. A rattle of wheels approached him from behind. A thrill  of hope shot through him at the sound. There was the prospect of a  lift. He stopped, and waited for the dog-cart--it sounded like a  dog-cart--to arrive. Then he uttered a shout of rapture, and began to  wave his arms like a semaphore. The man in the dog-cart was Dr Adamson.    'Hullo, Charteris,' said the Doctor, pulling up his horse, 'what are  you doing here?'    'Give me a lift,' said Charteris, 'and I'll tell you. It's a long yarn.  Can I get in?'    'Come along. Plenty of room.'    Charteris climbed up, and sank on to the cushioned seat with a sigh of  pleasure. What glorious comfort. He had never enjoyed anything more in  his life.    'I'm nearly dead,' he said, as the dog-cart went on again. 'This is how  it all happened. You see, it was this way--'    And he embarked forthwith upon his narrative.        _Chapter 6_    By special request the Doctor dropped Charteris within a hundred yards  of Merevale's door.    'Good-night,' he said. 'I don't suppose you will value my advice at  all, but you may have it for what it is worth. I recommend you stop  this sort of game. Next time something will happen.'    'By Jove, yes,' said Charteris, climbing painfully down from the  dog-cart, 'I'll take that advice. I'm a reformed character from this  day onwards. This sort of thing isn't good enough. Hullo, there's the  bell for lock-up. Good-night, Doctor, and thanks most awfully for the  lift. It was frightfully kind of you.'    'Don't mention it,' said Dr Adamson, 'it is always a privilege to be in  your company. When are you coming to tea with me again?'    'Whenever you'll have me. I must get leave, though, this time.'    'Yes. By the way, how's Graham? It is Graham, isn't it? The fellow who  broke his collar-bone?'    'Oh, he's getting on splendidly. Still in a sling, but it's almost well  again now. But I must be off. Good-night.'    'Good-night. Come to tea next Monday.'    'Right,' said Charteris; 'thanks awfully.'    He hobbled in at Merevale's gate, and went up to his study. The Babe  was in there talking to Welch.    'Hullo,' said the Babe, 'here's Charteris.'    'What's left of him,' said Charteris.    'How did it go off?'    'Don't, please.'    'Did you win?' asked Welch.    'No. Second. By a yard. Oh, Lord, I am dead.'    'Hot race?'    'Rather. It wasn't that, though. I had"]]]
