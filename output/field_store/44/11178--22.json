When she saw Kent pass the gate, she hurried up and threw it open,  wondering a little that Kent should forget his horse. He had told her to  see that he was turned loose if the fire could not be stopped--and now he  seemed to have forgotten it.    Michael, with a snort and an upward toss of his head to throw the dragging  reins away from his feet, left the corral with one jump, and clattered  away, past the house and up the hill, on the trail which led toward home.  Val stood for a moment watching him. Could he out-run the fire? He was  holding his head turned to one side now, so that the reins dangled away  from his pounding feet; once he stumbled to his knees, but he was up in a  flash, and running faster than ever. He passed out of sight over the hill,  and Val, with eyes smarting and cheeks burning from the heat, drew a long  breath and started after Kent.    Kent was backing, step by step, away from the heat of the burning stacks.  The roar, and the crackle, and the heat were terrific; it was as if the  whole world was burning around them, and they only were left. A brand flew  low over Val's head as she ran staggeringly, with a bewildered sense that  she must hurry somewhere and do something immediately, to save something  which positively must be saved. A spark from the brand fell upon her hand,  and she looked up stupidly. The heat and the smoke were choking her so that  she could scarcely breathe.    A new crackle was added to the uproar of flames. Kent, still backing from  the furnace of blazing hay, turned, and saw that the stable, with its roof  of musty hay, was afire. And, just beyond, Val, her face covered with her  sooty hands, was staggering drunkenly. He reached her as she fell to her  knees.    \"I--can't--fight--any more,\" she whispered faintly.    He picked her up in his arms and hesitated, his face toward the house; then  ran straight away from it, stumbled across the dry ditch and out across the  blackened strip which their own back fire had swept clean of grass. The hot  earth burned his feet through the soles of his riding boots, but the wind  carried the heat and the smoke away, behind them. Clumps of bushes were  still burning at the roots, but he avoided them and kept on to the far side  hill, where a barren, yellow patch, with jutting sandstone rocks, offered  a resting place. He set Val down upon a rock, placed himself beside her so  that she was leaning against him, and began fanning her vigorously with his  hat.    \"Thank the Lord, we're behind that smoke, anyhow,\" he observed, when he  could get his breath. He felt that silence was not good for the woman  beside him, though he doubted much whether she was in a condition to  understand him. She was gasping irregularly, and her body was a dead weight  against him. \"It was sure fierce, there, for a few minutes.\"    He looked out across the coulee at the burning stables, and waited for the  house to catch. He could not hope that it would escape, but he did not  mention the probability of its burning.    \"Keep your eyes shut,\" he said. \"That'll help some, and soon as we can  we'll go to the spring and give our faces and hands a good bath.\" He untied  his silk neckerchief, shook out the cinders, and pressed it against her  closed eyes. \"Keep that over 'em,\" he commanded, \"till we can do better. My  eyes are more used to smoke than yours, I guess. Working around branding  fires toughens 'em some.\"    Still she did not attempt to speak, and she did not seem to have energy  enough left to keep the silk over her eyes. The wind blew it off without  her stirring a finger to prevent, and Kent caught it just in time to save  it from sailing away toward the fire. After that he held it in place  himself, and he did not try to keep talking. He sat quietly, with his arm  around her, as impersonal in the embrace as if he were holding a strange  partner in a dance, and watched the stacks burn, and the stables. He saw  the corral take fire, rail by rail, until it was all ablaze. He saw hens  and roosters running heavily, with wings dragging, until the heat toppled  them over. He saw a cat, with white spots upon its sides, leave the bushes  down by the creek and go bounding in terror to the house.    And still the house stood there, the curtains flapping in and out through  the open windows, the kitchen door banging open and shut as the gusts of  wind caught it. The fire licked as close as burned ground and rocky creek  bed would let it, and the flames which had stayed behind to eat the  spare gleanings died, while the main line raged on up the hillside and  disappeared in a huge, curling wave of smoke. The stacks burned down  to blackened, smoldering butts. The willows next the spring, and the  chokecherries and wild currants withered in the heat and waved charred,  naked arms impotently in the wind. The stable crumpled up, flared, and  became a heap of embers. The corral was but a ragged line of smoking,  half-burned sticks and ashes. Spirals of smoke, like dying camp fires, blew  thin ribbons out over the desolation.    Kent drew a long breath and glanced down at the limp figure in his arms.  She lay so very still that in spite of a quivering breath now and then he  had a swift, unreasoning fear she might be dead. Her hair was a tangled  mass of gold upon her head, and spilled over his arm. He carefully picked a  flake or two of charred grass from the locks on her temples, and discovered  how fine and soft was the hair. He lifted the grimy neckerchief from her  eyes and looked down at her face, smoke-soiled and reddened from the heat.  Her lips were drooped pitifully, like a hurt child. Her lashes, he noticed  for the first time, were at least four shades darker than her hair. His  gaze traveled on down her slim figure to her ringed fingers lying loosely  in her lap, a long, dry-looking blister upon one hand near the thumb; down  to her slippers, showing beneath her scorched skirt. And he drew another  long breath. He did not know why, but he had a strange, fleeting sense of  possession, and it startled him into action.    \"You gone to sleep?\" he called gently, and gave her a little shake. \"We can  get to the spring now, if you feel like walking that far; if you don't, I  reckon I'll have to carry you--for I sure do want a drink!\"    She half lifted her lashes and let them drop again, as if life were not  worth the effort of living. Kent hesitated, set his lips tightly together,  and lifted her up straighter. His eyes were intent and stern, as though  some great issue was at stake, and he must rouse her at once, in spite of  everything.    \"Here, this won't do at all,\" he said--but he was speaking to himself and  his quivering nerves, more than to her.    She sighed, made a conscious effort, and half opened her eyes again. But  she seemed not to share his anxiety for action, and her mental and physical  apathy were not to be mistaken. The girl was utterly exhausted with  fire-fighting and nervous strain.    \"You seem to be all in,\" he observed, his voice softly complaining. \"Well,  I packed you over here, and I reckon I better pack you back again--if you  _won't_ try to walk.\"    She muttered something, of which Kent only distinguished \"a minute.\" But  she was still limp, and absolutely without interest in anything, and so,  after a moment of hesitation, he gathered her up in his arms and carried  her back to the house, kicked the door savagely open, took her in through  the kitchen, and laid her down upon the couch, with a sigh of relief that  he was rid of her.    The couch was gay with a bright, silk spread of \"crazy\" patchwork, and  piled generously with dainty cushions, too evidently made for ornamental  purposes than for use. But Kent piled the cushions recklessly around her,  tucked her smudgy skirts close, went and got a towel, which he immersed  recklessly in the water pail, and bathed her face and hands with clumsy  gentleness, and pushed back her tangled hair. The burn upon her hand showed  an angry red around the white of the blister, and he laid the wet towel  carefully upon it. She did not move.    He was a man, and he had lived all his life among men. He could fight  anything that was fightable. He could save her life, but after this slight  attention to her comfort he had reached the limitations set by his purely  masculine training. He lowered the shades so that the room was dusky and as  cool as any other place in that fire-tortured land, and felt that he could  no do more for her.    He stood for a moment looking down at the inert, grimy little figure  stretched out straight, like a corpse, upon the bright-hued couch, her eyes  closed and sunken, with blue shadows beneath, her lips pale and still with  that tired, pitiful droop. He stooped and rearranged the wet towel on her  burned hand, held his face close above hers for a second, sighed, frowned,  and tiptoed out into the kitchen, closing the door carefully behind him.          CHAPTER X. DESOLATION    For more than two hours Kent sat outside in the shade of the house, and  stared out over the black desolation of the coulee. His horse was gone, so  that he could not ride anywhere--and there was nowhere in particular to  ride. For twenty miles around there was no woman whom he could bring to  Val's assistance, even if he had been sure that she needed assistance.  Several times he tiptoed into the kitchen, opened the door into the front  room an inch or so, and peered in at her. The third time, she had relaxed  from the corpselike position, and had thrown an arm up over her face, as if  she were shielding her eyes from something. He took heart at that, and went  out and foraged for firewood.    There was a hard-beaten zone around the corral and stables, which had kept  the fire from spreading toward the house, and the wind had borne the sparks  and embers back toward the spring, so that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8547"],[0,"Pirke Avot: The Sayings of the Jewish Fathers (#17)"],[1,"am?
