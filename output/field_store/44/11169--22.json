I was getting so light that I  felt that, when the old man kicked me, I should just soar up to the  ceiling like an air balloon.    The club was one of those large clubs that look like prisons. I used  to go there to lunch with my uncle, the one who left me his money, and  I always hated the place. It was one of those clubs that are all red  leather and hushed whispers.    I'm bound to say, though, there wasn't much hushed whispering when I  started my interview with old man Craye. His voice was one of my  childhood's recollections.    He was most extraordinarily like Florence. He had just the same eyes.  I felt boneless from the start.    \"Good morning,\" I said.    \"What?\" he said. \"Speak up. Don't mumble.\"    I hadn't known he was deaf. The last time we'd had any  conversation--on the subject of razors--he had done all the talking.  This seemed to me to put the lid on it.    \"I only said 'Good morning,'\" I shouted.    \"Good what? Speak up. I believe you're sucking candy. Oh, good  morning? I remember you now. You're the boy who spoiled my razor.\"    I didn't half like this reopening of old wounds. I hurried on.    \"I came about Edwin,\" I said.    \"Who?\"    \"Edwin. Your son.\"    \"What about him?\"    \"Florence told me to see you.\"    \"Who?\"    \"Florence. Your daughter.\"    \"What about her?\"    All this vaudeville team business, mind you, as if we were bellowing  at each other across the street. All round the room you could see old  gentlemen shooting out of their chairs like rockets and dashing off at  a gallop to write to the governing board about it. Thousands of  waiters had appeared from nowhere, and were hanging about, dusting  table legs. If ever a business wanted to be discussed privately, this  seemed to me to be it. And it was just about as private as a  conversation through megaphones in Longacre Square.    \"Didn't she write to you?\"    \"I got a letter from her. I tore it up. I didn't read it.\"    Pleasant, was it not? It was not. I began to understand what a  shipwrecked sailor must feel when he finds there's something gone  wrong with the life belt.    I thought I might as well get to the point and get it over.    \"Edwin's going to marry a palmist,\" I said.    \"Who the devil's Harry?\"    \"Not Harry. Marry. He's going to marry a palmist.\"    About four hundred waiters noticed a speck of dust on an ash tray at  the table next to ours, and swooped down on it.    \"Edwin is going to marry a palmist?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"She must be mad. Hasn't she seen Edwin?\"    And just then who should stroll in but Edwin himself. I sighted him  and gave him a hail.    He curveted up to us. It was amazing the way the fellow had altered.  He looked like a two-year-old. Flower in his button-hole and a  six-inch grin, and all that. The old man seemed surprised, too. I  didn't wonder. The Edwin he remembered was a pretty different kind of  a fellow.    \"Hullo, dad,\" he said. \"Fancy meeting you here. Have a cigarette?\"    He shoved out his case. Old man Craye helped himself in a sort of  dazed way.    \"You _are_ Edwin?\" he said slowly.    I began to sidle out. They didn't notice me. They had moved to a  settee, and Edwin seemed to be telling his father a funny story.    At least, he was talking and grinning, and the old man was making a  noise like distant thunder, which I supposed was his way of chuckling.  I slid out and left them.    Some days later Duggie called on me. The old boy was looking scared.    \"Reggie,\" he said, \"what do doctors call it when you think you see  things when you don't? Hal-something. I've got it, whatever it is.  It's sometimes caused by overwork. But it can't be that with me,  because I've not been doing any work. You don't think my brain's going  or anything like that, do you?\"    \"What do you mean? What's been happening?\"    \"It's like being haunted. I read a story somewhere of a fellow who  kept thinking he saw a battleship bearing down on him. I've got it,  too. Four times in the last three days I could have sworn I saw my  father and Edwin. I saw them as plainly as I see you. And, of course,  Edwin's at home and father's in Europe somewhere. Do you think it's  some sort of a warning? Do you think I'm going to die?\"    \"It's all right, old top,\" I said. \"As a matter of fact, they are both  in New York just now.\"    \"You don't mean that? Great Scot, what a relief! But, Reggie, old fox,  it couldn't have been them really. The last time was at Louis  Martin's, and the fellow I mistook for Edwin was dancing all by  himself in the middle of the floor.\"    I admitted it was pretty queer.    I was away for a few days after that in the country. When I got back I  found a pile of telegrams waiting for me. They were all from Florence,  and they all wanted me to go to Madison Avenue. The last of the batch,  which had arrived that morning, was so peremptory that I felt as if  something had bitten me when I read it.    For a moment I admit I hung back. Then I rallied. There are times in a  man's life when he has got to show a flash of the old bulldog pluck,  don't you know, if he wants to preserve his self-respect. I did then.  My grip was still unpacked. I told my man to put it on a cab. And in  about two ticks I was bowling off to the club. I left for England next  day by the _Lusitania_.    About three weeks later I fetched up at Nice. You can't walk far at  Nice without bumping into a casino. The one I hit my first evening was  the Casino Municipale in the Place Massena. It looked more or less of  a Home From Home, so I strolled in.    There was quite a crowd round the boule tables, and I squashed in. And  when I'd worked through into the front rank I happened to look down  the table, and there was Edwin, with a green Tyrolese hat hanging over  one ear, clutching out for a lot of five-franc pieces which the  croupier was steering toward him at the end of a rake.    I was feeling lonesome, for I knew no one in the place, so I edged  round in his direction.    Halfway there I heard my name called, and there was Mrs. Darrell.    I saw the whole thing in a flash. Old man Craye hadn't done a thing to  prevent it--apart from being eccentric, he was probably glad that  Edwin had had the sense to pick out anybody half as good a sort--and  the marriage had taken place. And here they were on their honeymoon.    I wondered what Florence was thinking of it.    \"Well, well, well, here we all are,\" I said. \"I've just seen Edwin. He  seems to be winning.\"    \"Dear boy!\" she said. \"He does enjoy it so. I think he gets so much  more out of life than he used to, don't you?\"    \"Sure thing. May I wish you happiness? Why didn't you let me know and  collect the silver fish-slice?\"    \"Thank you so much, Mr. Pepper. I did write to you, but I suppose you  never got the letter.\"    \"Mr. Craye didn't make any objections, then?\"    \"On the contrary. He was more in favor of the marriage than anyone.\"    \"And I'll tell you why,\" I said. \"I'm rather a chump, you know, but I  observe things. I bet he was most frightfully grateful to you for  taking Edwin in hand and making him human.\"    \"Why, you're wonderful, Mr. Pepper. That is exactly what he said  himself. It was that that first made us friends.\"    \"And--er--Florence?\"    She sighed.    \"I'm afraid Florence has taken the thing a little badly. But I hope to  win her over in time. I want all my children to love me.\"    \"All your what?\"    \"I think of them as my children, you see, Mr. Pepper. I adopted them  as my own when I married their father. Did you think I had married  Edwin? What a funny mistake. I am very fond of Edwin, but not in that  way. No, I married Mr. Craye. We left him at our villa tonight, as he  had some letters to get off. You must come and see us, Mr. Pepper. I  always feel that it was you who brought us together, you know. I  wonder if you will be seeing Florence when you get back? Will you give  her my very best love?\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8220"],[0,"Remarks (#17)"],[1,"it first-rate and takes  it good naturedly. She claims 16,000 people, some of whom I met at the  opera house there. If the rest of the 16,000 are as pleasant as those I  conversed with that evening, Duluth must be a pleasant place to live in.  Duluth has a very pleasant and beautiful opera house that seats 1,000  people. A few more could have elbowed their way into the opera house the  evening that I spoke there, but they preferred to suffer on at home.    Lake Superior is one of the largest aggregations of fresh wetness in the  world, if not the largest. When I stop to think that some day all this  cold, cold water will have to be absorbed by mankind, it gives me a cramp  in the geographical center.    Around the west end of Lake Superior there is a string of towns which  stretches along the shore for miles under one name or another, all waiting  for the boom to strike and make the northern Chicago. You cannot visit  Duluth or Superior without feeling that at any moment the tide of trade  will rise and designate the point where the future metropolis of the  northern lakes is to be. I firmly believe that this summer will decide it,  and my guess is that what is now known as West Superior is to get the  benefit. For many years destiny has been hovering over the west end of  this mighty lake, and now the favored point is going to be designated.  Duluth has past prosperity and expensive improvements in her favor, and in  fact the whole locality is going to be benefited, but if I had a block in  West Superior with a roller rink on it, I would wear my best clothes every  day and claim to be a millionaire in disguise. Ex-President R. B. Hayes  has a large brick block in Duluth, but he does not occupy it. Those who go  to Duluth hoping to meet Mr. Hayes will be bitterly disappointed.    The streams that run into Lake Superior are alive with trout, and next  summer I propose to go up there and roast until I have so thoroughly  saturated my system with trout that the trout bones will stick out through  my clothes in every direction and people will regard me as a beautiful  toothpick holder.    Still there will be a few left for those who think of going up there. All  I will need will be barely enough to feed Albert Victor and myself from  day to day. People who have never seen a crowned head with a peeled nose  on it are cordially invited to come over and see us during office hours.  Albert is not at all haughty, and I intend to throw aside my usual reserve  this summer also--for the time. P. Wales' son and I will be far from the  cares that crowd so thick and fast on greatness. People who come to our  cedar bark wigwam to show us their mosquito bites, will be received as  cordially as though no great social chasm yawned between us.    Many will meet us in the depths of the forest and go away thinking that we  are just common plugs of whom the world wots not; but there is where they  will fool themselves.    Then, when the season is over, we will come back into the great maelstrom  of life, he to wait for his grandmother's overshoes and I to thrill  waiting millions from the rostrum with my \"Tale of the Broncho Cow.\" And  so it goes with us all. Adown life's rugged pathway some must toil on from  daylight to dark to earn their meagre pittance as kings, while others are  born to wear a swallow-tail coat every evening and wring tears of genuine  anguish from their audiences.    They tell some rather wide stories about people who have gone up there  total physical wrecks and returned strong and well. One man said that he  knew a young college student, who was all run down and weak, go up there  on the Brule and eat trout and fight mosquitoes a few months, and when he  returned to his Boston home he was so stout and well and tanned up that  his parents did not know him. There was a man in our car who weighed 300  pounds. He seemed to be boiling out through his clothes everywhere. He was  the happiest looking man I ever saw. All he seemed to do in this life was  to sit all day and whistle and laugh and trot his stomach, first on one  knee and then on the other.    He said that he went up into the pine forests of the Great Lake region a  broken-down hypochondriac and confirmed consumptive. He had been measured  for a funeral sermon three times, he said, and had never used either of  them. He knew a clergyman named Brayley who went up into that region with  Bright's justly celebrated disease. He was so emaciated that he couldn't  carry a watch. The ticking of the watch rattled his bones so that it made  him nervous, and at night they had to pack him in cotton so that he  wouldn't break a leg when he turned over. He got to sleeping out nights on  a bed of balsam and spruce boughs and eating venison and trout.    When he came down in the spring, he passed through a car of lumbermen and  one of them put a warm, wet quid of tobacco in his plug hat for a joke.  There were a hundred of these lumbermen when the preacher began, and when  the train got into Eau Claire there were only three of them well enough to  go around to the office and draw their pay.    This is just as the story was given to me and I repeat it to show how  bracing the climate near Superior is. Remember, if you please, that I do  not want the story to be repeated as coming from me, for I have nothing  left now but my reputation for veracity, and that has had a very hard  winter of it.          I Tried Milling.    I think I was about 18 years of age when I decided that I would be a  miller, with flour on my clothes and a salary of $200 per month. This was  not the first thing I had decided to be, and afterward changed my mind  about.    I engaged to learn my profession of a man called Sam Newton, I believe; at  least I will call him that for the sake of argument. My business was to  weigh wheat, deduct as much as possible on account of cockle, pigeon grass  and wild buckwheat, and to chisel the honest farmer out of all he would  stand. This was the programme with Mr. Newton; but I am happy to say that  it met with its reward, and the sheriff afterward operated the mill.    On stormy days I did the book-keeping, with a scoop shovel behind my ear,  in a pile of middlings on the fifth floor. Gradually I drifted into doing  a good deal of this kind of brain work. I would chop the ice out of the  turbine wheel at 5 o'clock A.M., and then frolic up six flights of stairs  and shovel shorts till 9 o'clock P.M.    By shoveling bran and other vegetables 16 hours a day, a general knowledge  of the milling business may be readily obtained. I used to scoop middlings  till I could see stars, and then I would look out at the landscape and  ponder.    I got so that I piled up more ponder, after a while, than I did middlings.    One day the proprietor came up stairs and discovered me in a brown study,  whereupon he cursed me in a subdued Presbyterian way, abbreviated my  salary from $26 per month to $18 and reduced me to the ranks.    Afterward I got together enough desultory information so that I could  superintend the feed stone. The feed stone is used to grind hen feed and  other luxuries. One day I noticed an odor that reminded me of a hot  overshoe trying to smother a glue factory at the close of a tropical day.  I spoke to the chief floor walker of the mill about it, and he said \"dod  gammit\" or something that sounded like that, in a course and brutal  manner. He then kicked my person in a rude and hurried tone of voice, and  told me that the feed stone was burning up.    He was a very fierce man, with a violent and ungovernable temper, and,  finding that I was only increasing his brutal fury, I afterward resigned  my position. I talked it over with the proprietor, and both agreed that it  would be best. He agreed to it before I did, and rather hurried up my  determination to go.    [Illustration: HE MADE IT AN OBJECT FOR ME TO GO.]    I rather hated to go so soon, but he made it an object for me to go, and I  went. I started in with the idea that I would begin at the bottom of the  ladder, as it were, and gradually climb to the bran bin by my own  exertions, hoping by honesty, industry, and carrying two bushels of wheat  up nine flights of stairs, to become a wealthy man, with corn meal in my  hair and cracked wheat in my coat pocket, but I did not seem to accomplish  it.    Instead of having ink on my fingers and a chastened look of woe on my  clear-cut Grecian features, I might have poured No. 1 hard wheat and  buckwheat flour out of my long taper ears every night, if I had stuck to  the profession. Still, as I say, it was for another man's best good that I  resigned. The head miller had no control over himself and the proprietor  had rather set his heart on my resignation, so it was better that way.    Still I like to roll around in the bran pile, and monkey in the cracked  wheat. I love also to go out in the kitchen and put corn meal down the  back of the cook's neck while my wife is working a purple silk Kensington  dog, with navy blue mane and tail, on a gothic lambrequin.    I can never cease to hanker for the rumble and grumble of the busy mill,  and the solemn murmur of the millstones and the machinery are music to me.  More so than the solemn murmur of the proprietor used to be when he came  in at an inopportune moment, and in that impromptu and extemporaneous  manner of his, and found me admiring the wild and beautiful scenery. He  may have been a good miller, but he had no love for the beautiful. Perhaps  that is why he was always so cold and cruel toward me. My slender, willowy  grace and mellow, bird-like voice never seemed to melt his stony heart.          Our Forefathers.    Seattle, W.T., December 12.--I am up here on the Sound in two senses.
