But on the 6th of May the _William Wallace_ arrived, and  \"this sight,\" says the Governor with characteristic sincerity, \"was, I  presume, the most interesting I ever beheld.\" From there they marched  to the mouth of Rock River, and thence General Whitesides proceeded  with his volunteers up the river some ninety miles to Dixon, where  they halted to await the arrival of General Atkinson with the regular  troops and provisions. There they found two battalions of fresh  horsemen under Majors Stillman and Bailey, who had as yet seen no  service and were eager for the fray. Whitesides's men were tired with  their forced march, and besides, in their ardor to get forward, they  had thrown away a good part of their provisions and left their baggage  behind. It pleased the Governor, therefore, to listen to the prayers  of Stillman's braves, and he gave them orders to proceed to the head  of Old Man's Creek, where it was supposed there were some hostile  Indians, and coerce them into submission. \"I thought,\" says the  Governor in his memoirs, \"they might discover the enemy.\"    [Illustration:   A SOLDIER'S DISCHARGE FROM THE BLACK HAWK WAR, SIGNED  BY A. LINCOLN, CAPTAIN. IN THE POSSESSION OF O. H. OLDROTD,  SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS.]    The supposition was certainly well founded. They rode merrily away,  came to Old Man's Creek, thereafter to be called Stillman's Run, and  encamped for the night. By the failing light a small party of Indians  was discovered on the summit of a hill a mile away, and a few  courageous gentlemen hurriedly saddled their horses, and, without  orders, rode after them. The Indians retreated, but were soon  overtaken, and two or three of them killed. The volunteers were now  strung along a half mile of hill and valley, with no more order or  care than if they had been chasing rabbits. Black Hawk, who had been  at supper when the running fight began, hastily gathered a handful of  warriors and attacked the scattered whites. The onset of the savages  acted like an icy bath on the red-hot valor of the volunteers; they  turned and ran for their lives, stampeding the camp as they fled.  There was very little resistance--so little that Black Hawk, fearing a  ruse, tried to recall his warriors from the pursuit, but in the  darkness and confusion could not enforce his orders. The Indians  killed all they caught up with; but the volunteers had the fleeter  horses, and only eleven were overtaken. The rest reached Dixon by twos  and threes, rested all night, and took courage. General Whitesides  marched out to the scene of the disaster the next morning, but the  Indians were gone. They had broken up into small parties, and for  several days they reaped the bloody fruit of their victory in the  massacre of peaceful settlements in the adjacent districts.    The time of enlistment of the volunteers had now come to an end, and  the men, seeing no prospect of glory or profit, and weary of the work  and the hunger which were the only certain incidents of the campaign,  refused in great part to continue in service. But it is hardly  necessary to say that Captain Lincoln was not one of these homesick  soldiers. Not even the trammels of rank, which are usually so strong  among the trailers of the saber, could restrain him from what he  considered his simple duty. As soon as he was mustered out of his  captaincy, he re-enlisted on the same day, May 27, as a private  soldier. Several other officers did the same, among them General  Whitesides and Major John T. Stuart. Lincoln became a member of  Captain Elijah Iles's company of mounted volunteers, sometimes called  the \"Independent Spy Battalion,\" an organization unique of its kind,  if we may judge from the account given by one of its troopers. It was  not, says Mr. George M. Harrison, \"under the control of any regiment  or brigade, but received orders directly from the Commander-in-Chief,  and always, when with the army, camped within the lines, and had many  other privileges, such as having no camp duties to perform and drawing  rations as much and as often as we pleased,\" which would seem to liken  this battalion as nearly as possible to the fabled \"regiment of  brigadiers.\" With this _elite_ corps Lincoln served through his  second enlistment, though it was not his fortune to take part in  either of the two engagements in which General James D. Henry, at the  Wisconsin Bluffs and the Bad Axe, broke and destroyed forever the  power of Black Hawk and the British band of Sacs and Foxes.    After Lincoln was relieved of the weight of dignity involved in his  captaincy, the war became a sort of holiday, and the tall private from  New Salem enjoyed it as much as any one. He entered with great zest  into the athletic sports with which soldiers love to beguile the  tedium of camp. He was admitted to be the strongest man in the army,  and, with one exception, the best wrestler. Indeed, his friends never  admitted the exception, and severely blamed Lincoln for confessing  himself defeated on the occasion when he met the redoubtable Thompson,  and the two fell together on the turf. His popularity increased from  the beginning to the end of the campaign, and those of his comrades  who still survive always speak with hearty and affectionate praise of  his character and conduct in those rough yet pleasantly remembered  days.    [Sidenote: MS. Letters from Thomas, Gregg and others.]    The Spy Battalion formed no part of General Henry's forces when, by a  disobedience of orders as prudent as it was audacious, he started with  his slender force on the fresh trail which he was sure would lead him  to Black Hawk's camp. He found and struck the enemy at bay on the  bluffs of the Wisconsin River on the 21st of July, and inflicted upon  them a signal defeat. The broken remnant of Black Hawk's power then  fled for the Mississippi River, the whole army following in close  pursuit--General Atkinson in front and General Henry bringing up the  rear. Fortune favored the latter once more, for while Black Hawk with  a handful of men was engaging and drawing away the force under  Atkinson, General Henry struck the main trail, and brought on the  battle of the Bad Axe, if that could be called a battle which was an  easy slaughter of the weary and discouraged savages, fighting without  heart or hope, an army in front and the great river behind. Black Hawk  escaped the fate of his followers, to be captured a few days later  through the treachery of his allies. He was carried in triumph to  Washington and presented to President Jackson, to whom he made this  stern and defiant speech, showing how little age or disaster could do  to tame his indomitable spirit: \"I am a man and you are another. I did  not expect to conquer the white people. I took up the hatchet to  avenge injuries which could no longer be borne. [Footnote: It is a  noteworthy coincidence that President Lincoln's proclamation at the  opening of the war calls for troops \"to redress wrongs already long  enough endured.\"] Had I borne them longer my people would have said:  'Black Hawk is a squaw; he is too old to be a chief; he is no Sac.'  This caused me to raise the war-whoop. I say no more of it; all is  known to you.\" He returned to Iowa, and died on the 3d of October,  1838, at his camp on the river Des Moines. He was buried in gala  dress, with cocked hat and sword, and the medals presented him by two  governments. He was not allowed to rest even in his grave. His bones  were exhumed by some greedy wretch and sold from hand to hand till  they came at last to the Burlington Museum, where they were destroyed  by fire.    [Illustration:   BLACK HAWK]    It was on the 16th of June, a month before the slaughter of the Bad  Axe, that the battalion to which Lincoln belonged was at last mustered  out, at Whitewater, Wisconsin. His final release from the service was  signed by a young lieutenant of artillery, Robert Anderson, who,  twenty-nine years later, in one of the most awful crises in our  annals, was to sustain to Lincoln relations of prodigious importance,  on a scene illuminated by the flash of the opening guns of the civil  war. [Transcriber's Note: Lengthy footnote relocated to chapter end.]  The men started home the next day in high spirits, school-boys for  their holidays. Lincoln had need, like Horatio, of his good spirits,  for they were his only outfit for the long journey to New Salem, he  and his mess-mate Harrison [Footnote: George M. Harrison, who gives an  account of his personal experiences in Lamon, p. 116.] having had  their horses stolen the day before by some patriot over-anxious to  reach home. But, as Harrison says, \"I laughed at our fate, and he  joked at it, and we all started off merrily. The generous men of our  company walked and rode by turns with us, and we fared about equal  with the rest. But for this generosity our legs would have had to do  the better work; for in that day this dreary route furnished no horses  to buy or to steal; and, whether on horse or afoot, we always had  company, for many of the horses' backs were too sore for riding.\" It  is not hard to imagine with what quips and quirks of native fancy  Lincoln and his friends beguiled the way through forest and prairie.  With youth, good health, and a clear conscience, and even then the  dawn of a young and undefiled ambition in his heart, nothing was  wanting to give zest and spice to this long, sociable walk of a  hundred leagues. One joke is preserved, and this one is at the expense  of Lincoln. One chilly morning he complained of being cold. \"No  wonder,\" said some facetious cavalier, \"there is so much of you on the  ground.\" [Footnote: Dr. Holland gives this homely joke (Life of  Lincoln, p. 71), but transfers it to a time four years"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6818"],[0,"The Arctic Prairies : a Canoe-Journey of 2,000 Miles in Search of the Caribou; (#17)"],[1,"   ON THE NYARLING        All night it rained; in the morning it was dull, foggy, and showery.  Everything was very depressing, especially in view of this second  defeat. The steady diet of Moose and tea was debilitating; my legs  trembled under me. I fear I should be a poor one to stand starvation,  if so slight a brunt should play such havoc with my strength.    We set out early to retrace the course of the Nyarling, which in  spite of associated annoyances and disappointments will ever shine  forth in my memory as the \"Beautiful River.\"    It is hard, indeed, for words to do it justice. The charm of a  stream is always within three feet of the surface and ten feet of  the bank. The broad Slave, then, by its size wins in majesty but  must lose most all its charm; the Buffalo, being fifty feet wide,  has some waste water; but the Nyarling, half the size, has its  birthright compounded and intensified in manifold degree. The water  is clear, two or three feet deep at the edge of the grassy banks,  seven to ten feet in mid-channel, without bars or obstructions  except the two log-jambs noted, and these might easily be removed.  The current is about one mile and a half an hour, so that canoes  can readily pass up or down; the scenery varies continually and is  always beautiful. Everything that I have said of the Little Buffalo  applies to the Nyarling with fourfold force, because of its more  varied scenery and greater range of bird and other life. Sometimes,  like the larger stream, it presents a long, straight vista of a  quarter-mile through a solemn aisle in the forest of mighty spruce  trees that tower a hundred feet in height, all black with gloom,  green with health, and gray with moss.    Sometimes its channel winds in and out of open grassy meadows that  are dotted with clumps of rounded trees, as in an English park.  Now it narrows to a deep and sinuous bed, through alders so rank  and reaching that they meet overhead and form a shade of golden  green; and again it widens out into reedy lakes, the summer home  of countless Ducks, Geese, Tattlers Terns, Peetweets, Gulls, Rails,  Blackbirds, and half a hundred of the lesser tribes. Sometimes the  foreground is rounded masses of kinnikinnik in snowy flower, or  again a far-strung growth of the needle bloom, richest and reddest  of its tribe--the Athabaska rose. At times it is skirted by tall  poplar woods where the claw-marks on the trunks are witness of the  many Blackbears, or some tamarack swamp showing signs and proofs  that hereabouts a family of Moose had fed to-day, or by a broad  and broken trail that told of a Buffalo band passing weeks ago.  And while we gazed at scribbled records, blots, and marks, the loud  \"slap plong\" of a Beaver showed from time to time that the thrifty  ones had dived at our approach.    On the way up Jarvis had gone first in the small canoe; he saw 2  Bears, 3 Beaver, and 1 Lynx; I saw nothing but birds. On the way  down, being alone, the luck came my way.    At the first camp, after he left, we heard a loud \"plong\" in the  water near the boat. Bezkya glided to the spot; I followed--here  was a large Beaver swimming. The Indian fired, the Beaver plunged,  and we saw nothing more of it. He told Billy, who told me, that it  was dead, because it did not slap with its tail as it went down.  Next night another splashed by our boat.    This morning as we paddled we saw a little stream, very muddy,  trickling into the river. Bezkya said, \"Beaver at work on his dam  there.\" Now that we were really heading for flour, our Indian showed  up well. He was a strong paddler, silent but apparently cheerful,  ready at all times to work. As a hunter and guide he was of course  first class. About 10.30 we came on a large Beaver sunning himself  on a perch built of mud just above the water. He looked like a  huge chestnut Muskrat. He plunged at once but came up again yards  farther down, took another look and dived, to be seen no more.    At noon we reached our old camp, the last where all had been  together. Here we put up a monument on a tree, and were mortified  to think we had not done so at our farthest camp.    There were numbers of Yellowlegs breeding here; we were surprised  to see them resting on trees or flying from one branch to another.    A Great Gray-owl sitting on a stump was a conspicuous feature of  our landscape view; his white choker shone like a parson's.    Early in the morning we saw a Kingbird. This was our northernmost  record for the species.    We pressed on all day, stopping only for our usual supper of Moose  and tea, and about 7 the boys were ready to go on again. They  paddled till dark at 10. Camped in the rain, but every one was  well pleased, for we had made 40 miles that day and were that much  nearer to flour.    This journey had brought us down the Nyarling and 15 miles down  the Buffalo.    It rained all night; next morning the sun came out once or twice but  gave it up, and clouds with rain sprinklings kept on. We had struck  a long spell of wet; it was very trying, and fatal to photographic  work.    After a delicious, appetising, and inspiring breakfast of straight  Moose, without even salt, and raw tea, we pushed on along the line  of least resistance, i.e., toward flour.    A flock of half a dozen Bohemian Waxwings were seen catching flies  among the tall spruce tops; probably all were males enjoying a stag  party while their wives were home tending eggs or young.    Billy shot a female Bufflehead Duck; she was so small-only 8 inches  in slack girth--that she could easily have entered an ordinary  Woodpecker hole. So that it is likely the species nest in the abandoned  holes of the Flicker. A Redtailed Hawk had its nest on a leaning  spruce above the water. It was a most striking and picturesque  object; doubtless the owner was very well pleased with it, but a  pair of Robins militant attacked him whenever he tried to go near  it.    A Beaver appeared swimming ahead; Bezkya seized his rifle and  removed the top of its head, thereby spoiling a splendid skull but  securing a pelt and a new kind of meat. Although I was now paying  his wages the Beaver did not belong to me. According to the custom  of the country it belonged to Bezkya. He owed me nothing but service  as a guide. Next meal we had Beaver tail roasted and boiled; it  was very delicious, but rather rich and heavy.    At 3.45 we reached Great Slave Lake, but found the sea so high  that it would have been very dangerous to attempt crossing to Fort  Resolution, faintly to be seen a dozen miles away.    We waited till 7, then ventured forth; it was only 11 miles across  and we could send that canoe at 5 1/2 miles an hour, but the wind  and waves against us were so strong that it took 3 1/2 hours to  make the passage. At 10.30 we landed at Resolution and pitched our  tent among 30 teepees with 200 huge dogs that barked, scratched,  howled, yelled, and fought around, in, and over the tent-ropes  all night long. Oh, how different from the tranquil woods of the  Nyarling!          CHAPTER XXI    FORT RESOLUTION AND ITS FOLK        Early next morning Preble called on his old acquaintance, Chief  Trader C. Harding, in charge of the post. Whenever we have gone to  H. B. Co. officials to do business with them, as officers of the  company, we have found them the keenest of the keen; but whenever  it is their personal affair, they are hospitality out-hospitalled.  They give without stint; they lavish their kindness on the stranger  from the big world. In a few minutes Preble hastened back to say  that we were to go to breakfast at once.    That breakfast, presided over by a charming woman and a genial,  generous man, was one that will not be forgotten while I live.  Think of it, after the hard scrabble on the Nyarling! We had real  porridge and cream, coffee with veritable sugar and milk, and  authentic butter, light rolls made of actual flour, unquestionable  bacon and potatoes, with jam and toast--the really, truly things--and  we had as much as we could eat! We behaved rather badly--intemperately,  I fear--we stopped only when forced to do it, and yet both of us  came away with appetites.    It was clear that I must get some larger craft than my canoe to  cross the lake from Fort Resolution and take the 1,300 pounds of  provisions that had come on the steamer. Harding kindly offered the  loan of a York boat, and with the help chiefly of Charlie McLeod  the white man, who is interpreter at the fort, I secured a crew to  man it. But oh, what worry and annoyance it was! These Great Slave  Lake Indians are like a lot of spoiled and petulant children,  with the added weakness of adult criminals; they are inconsistent,  shiftless, and tricky. Pike, Whitney, Buffalo Jones, and others  united many years ago in denouncing them as the most worthless and  contemptible of the human race, and since then they have considerably  deteriorated. There are exceptions, however, as will be seen by  the record.    One difficulty was that it became known that on the Buffalo expedition  Bezkya had received three dollars a day, which is government  emergency pay. I had agreed to pay the regular maximum, two dollars  a day with presents and keep. All came and demanded three dollars.  I told them they could go at once in search of the hottest place  ever pictured by a diseased and perfervid human imagination.    If they went there they decided not to stay, because in an hour  they were back offering to compromise. I said I could run back to  Fort Smith (it sounds like nothing) and get all the men I needed  at one dollar and a half. (I should mortally have hated to try.)  One by one the crew resumed. Then another bombshell. I had offended  Chief Snuff by not calling and consulting with him; he now gave  it out that I was here to take out live Musk-ox, which meant that  all the rest would follow to seek their lost relatives. Again my  crew resigned. I went to see Snuff. Every"]]]
