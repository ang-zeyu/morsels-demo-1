More and more convinced that he had found the garden of Australia -- he  afterwards named this region Australia Felix -- Mitchell kept steadily on  until he came to the Wimmera, that deceptive river which afterwards  nearly lured Eyre to a death of thirst. On the last day of July he  discovered the beautiful Glenelg, and launched his boat on its waters. At  the outset he was stopped by a fall, was compelled to take to the land  once more, and proceeded along the bank, occasionally crossing to examine  the other side. On the 18th the boats were again used, the river being  much broader, and in two days he reached the coast, a little to the east  of Cape Northumberland.    The whole expedition then moved homewards, and reached Portland Bay,  where they found that the Henty family from Van Diemen's Land had been  established on a farm for about two years. From them Mitchell received  some assistance in the way of necessary supplies, and then resumed his  journey for home. On the 19th the party separated; Mitchell pushed ahead,  leaving Stapylton, his second, to rest the tired animals for a while and  then to follow slowly. On his homeward way Mitchell ascended Mount  Macedon, and from the summit saw and identified Port Phillip. His return,  with his glowing report of the splendid country he had discovered --  country fitted for the immediate occupation of the grazier and the farmer  -- at once stimulated its settlement, and as the man whose explorations  were of immediate benefit to the community in general -- Mitchell's name  stands first on the roll of explorers.    7.5. DISCOVERY OF THE BARCOO.    Some years elapsed before Mitchell -- now Sir Thomas -- again took to the  field of active exploration. The settlement of the upper Darling and the  Darling Downs had caused numerous speculations as to the nature of the  unknown territory comprising the northern half of Australia. In 1841,  communications had passed between the Governor and Captain Sturt, and in  December of the same year Eyre, not long returned from his march round  the Great Bight, wrote offering his services, provided that no prior  claim had been advanced by Sturt. Governor Gipps asked for an estimate of  the expenses, but considered Eyre's estimate of five thousand pounds too  high, and nothing further was done. In 1843, Sir Thomas Mitchell  submitted a plan of exploration to the Governor, who consulted the  Legislative Council. The Council approved it and voted one thousand  pounds towards expenses. The Governor referred the matter to Lord  Stanley, whose reply was favourable, but the project still hung fire. In  1844 Eyre again wrote offering to make the journey at a much more  reasonable rate, but his offer was however declined as Mitchell's  proposals held the field. In 1845 the fund was increased to two thousand  pounds, and Sir George Gipps ordered the Surveyor-General to make his  preparations.    Mitchell favoured the search for a practicable road to the Gulf of  Carpentaria, and hoped also that he would at last find his long-sought  northern-flowing river. In a letter which he then received from a  well-known grazier, Walter Bagot, there is mention of an aboriginal  description of a large river running northward to the west of the  Darling. But as natives in their descriptions frequently confuse flowing  to and flowing from, they probably had Cooper's Creek in mind.    During the earlier part of the year, Commissioner Mitchell, the son of  Sir Thomas, who was afterwards drowned during a passage to Newcastle, had  made a flying survey towards the Darling, and the discovery of the  Narran, Balonne, and Culgoa rivers has been attributed to him.    On the 15th of December, 1845, Mitchell started from Buree with a very  large company, including E.B. Kennedy as second in command, and W.  Stephenson as surgeon and collector. He struck the Darling much higher  than Fort Bourke, and it was not until he was across the river that he  passed the outermost cattle-stations, which had sprung rapidly into  existence since his last visit to the neighbourhood. The Narran was then  followed up until the Balonne was reached. This river, in his superlative  style, Mitchell pronounced to be the finest in Australia, with the  exception of the Murray. He then struck and followed the Culgoa upwards  until it divided into two branches; he skirted the main one, which  retained the name of the Balonne. On the 12th of April he came to the  natural bridge of rocks which he called St. George's bridge, and which is  the site of the present town of St. George. Here a temporary camp was  formed; Kennedy was left in charge to bring the main body on more slowly;  Mitchell with a few men went ahead. He followed up the Balonne to the  Maranoa, but as the little he saw of that tributary did not tempt him to  further investigation of it, he kept on his course up the main stream  until he reached the junction of a stream which he named the Cogoon. This  riverlet led him on into a magnificent pastoral district, in the midst of  which stood a solitary hill that he named Mount Abundance. It is in his  description of this region in his journal that we first find an allusion  to the bottle tree.    The party wandered on over a low watershed and came down out on to a  river which, from its direction and position, he surmised to be the  Maranoa, the stream he had not followed. At this new point it was full of  deep reaches of water, and drained a tract of most pleasing land. On its  banks he determined to await Kennedy's arrival.    Kennedy overtook him on the 1st of June, bringing from Sir Thomas's son  Roderick despatches which had reached the party after the leader's  departure. Amongst other items of news in the despatches was the report  of Leichhardt's return, and of the hearty reception that he had been  accorded in Sydney. One piece of random information, a mere floating  newspaper surmise, but enough to arouse Mitchell's suspicious temper,  annoyed him greatly. \"We understand,\" it ran, \"the intrepid Dr.  Leichhardt is about to start another expedition to the Gulf, keeping to  the westward of the coast ranges.\"    As this seemed to indicate an intention of trespassing on Mitchell's  present field of operations, he naturally felt some resentment not likely  to be allayed by such a paragraph as the following: \"Australia Felix and  the discoveries of Sir Thomas Mitchell now dwindle into comparative  insignificance.\"    Again leaving Kennedy, he set out to make a very extended excursion.  Traversing the country from the head of the Maranoa, he discovered the  Warrego River. Keeping north, over the watershed, for a time he fondly  imagined that he had reached northward-flowing waters; but the direction  of the rivers that he found, the Claude and the Nogoa, soon convinced him  of his error, and that he was on rivers of the east coast. Even when he  had reached the Belyando, a river which he named and followed down for a  short distance, he still deluded himself that he had reached inland  waters. Intensely mortified at finding that he was on a tributary of the  Burdekin, and approaching the ground already trodden by Leichhardt, he  returned to the head of the Nogoa, once more subdivided his party, and  formed a stationary camp to await his return from a westward trip.    This time, however, he was blessed with the most splendid success. He  found the Barcoo, a river that seemed to him to promise all he sought  for. The direction of its upper course easily led him to believe that it  was an affluent of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and after tracing it for some  distance he returned to camp. The newly-discovered river he named the  Victoria, thinking it would prove to be the same as that found by Captain  Stokes on his survey expedition. It was on the Barcoo, or Victoria, that  Mitchell first noticed the now famous grass that bears his name. On their  return journey, they followed down the Maranoa, and at the old camp at  St. George's Bridge, they were told by the natives that white men had  visited the place during their long absence. It was a singular and  welcome feature of Mitchell's discoveries that they had always proved to  be adjacent to civilisation, and to be suitable for immediate occupation.    The discovery of the Barcoo was the last feather in the cap of the  Surveyor-General. He was doomed to learn soon that it was not the river  of his dreams, but only the head waters of that central stream discovered  by Sturt, Cooper's Creek; but meanwhile the delusion must have been very  gratifying.    In 1851 Mitchell was sent out to report on the Bathurst goldfields, and  on a subsequent visit to England he took with him the first specimen of  gold and the first diamond found in Australia. He was for a short time  one of the members for the Port Phillip electorate, but resigned, as he  found faithful discharge of the duties to be incompatible with his  office. He patented the boomerang screw propeller, and was the author of  many educational and other works, including a translation of the Lusiad  of Camoens. Although a strict martinet in his official duties, and  subject to a choleric temper, he was strenuous in his devotion to the  advancement of Australia, among whose makers he must always occupy a  proud position. He died on the 5th of October, 1855, at Carthona, his  private residence at Darling Point, Sydney, New South Wales. His wife was  a daughter of Colonel Blount.        CHAPTER 8.
