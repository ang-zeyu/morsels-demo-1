This should be braced round the  stovepipe and left open at the end next the stove. At its entrance into  the chimney, a perforated collar should separate it from the stovepipe.]  The required difference of temperature is kept up with little difficulty.  The fresh air admitted to the room should then be heated [Footnote:  Ventilation is change of air, and, unless scientifically arranged, and  especially unless the incoming volume of air be warmed in cold weather,  such change of atmosphere means cold currents, with their attendant train  of catarrhs, bronchitis, neuralgia, rheumatism, and all the evils that  spring from these diseases. The raw, damp, frosty air of our ever-changing  winter temperature ought not to have uncontrolled and constant ingress to  our dwellings. Air out of doors is suited to out of door habits. It is  healthy and bracing when the body is coated and wrapped, and prepared to  meet it, and when exercise can be taken to keep up the circulation; but to  live under cover is to live artificially, and such essential conditions  must be observed as suit an abnormal state. All the evils attaching to  ventilation, as it is generally effected, spring from the neglect of this  consistency.--_Westminster Review_.] either by a furnace, or by  passing over a stove, or through a coil of steam pipes. This cold air  should always be taken directly from out of doors, and not from a cellar,  or from under a piazza, where contamination is possible.    3. In order to remove the impure air, there should be ventilators provided  at or near the floor, opening into air shafts, or pipes leading upward  through the roof, with proper orifices at the top. These ventilating pipes  should be heated artificially so as to produce a draught. They may form  one of the flues of a chimney in which there is a constant fire; or be  carried upward in a large flue through the center of which runs the smoke  pipe of the furnace or stove; [Footnote: This plan has been adopted in the  newer school buildings of Elmira, N. Y. The older buildings were provided  with ventilating pipes, not heated artificially, and hence of no service.  These pipes are rendered effective, however, by conducting them into a  small room in the garret, heated by a coal stove. From this room, a large  exit pipe leads to the roof, where it terminates in an Emerson's  ventilator. So strong a draught is thus established that throughout the  building air is taken from the floors, and consequently the cooler portion  of the rooms, at a velocity of three to five feet per second or one  hundred and eighty to three hundred cubic feet per minute for each square  foot of flue opening. In perpendicular flues, heated throughout with a  smoke flue from the furnace, ten feet per second is attained.] or the  ventilating pipe be itself conveyed through the center of the larger  chimney flue. If the register for hot air be on the floor at one side of  the room, two or more ventilators may be placed near the floor on the  opposite side. The warm air will thus make the complete circuit of the  room, and thoroughly warm it before passing out.    If the ventilating shaft be not heated artificially; the ventilator must  be placed at the top of the room in order that the hot air may escape  through it, thus producing an upward draught. But the objection to this  method is that it allows the warmer air to escape, while economy requires  that the cooler air at the bottom of the room should be removed and the  warm air be made to descend, thus securing uniformity of temperature.    4. In the summer, ventilation may be commonly provided for by opening  windows _at the top and the bottom_, on the sheltered side of the  building, so as to avoid draughts of air injurious to the occupants. On a  dull, still, hot day, when there is little difference of temperature  between the inner and the outer air, ventilation can be secured only by  having a fire provided in the ventilating shaft; this, by exhausting the  air from the room, will cause a fresh current to pour in through the open  windows. At recess, all the children should, if the weather permit, be  sent out of doors, to allow their clothing to be exposed to the purifying  influence of the open air; meantime, the windows should be thrown wide  open, that the room may be thoroughly ventilated during their absence. In  bad weather, rapid marching or calisthenic exercises will furnish  exercise, and also permit the airing of the room.    5. The school and the church are the centers for spreading contagious  diseases. The former offers especially dangerous facilities for scattering  disease germs. Great pains, therefore, should be taken to exclude pupils  attacked by or recovering from diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping cough,  etc., and even those who live in houses where such sickness exists.    6. In our houses [Footnote: The air of our homes is often contaminated by  decaying vegetables and other filth in the cellar; by bad air drawn up  from the soil into the cellar, by the powerful draughts that our fires  create; by defective gas and waste pipes that let the foul air from  cesspool or sewer spread through the house; and by piles of refuse, or  puddles of slops emptied at the back door. Too often, also, the water in  our wells, or in the streams that supply our towns and cities, receives  the drainage from outhouses and barnyards, and so introduces into our  systems, in the liquid--and thus easily assimilated--form, the most  dangerous poisons. The question of sanitary precautions is one that  presses upon every observant mind, and demands constant and thoughtful  attention. (See p. 305.)] open fireplaces are efficient ventilators, and  they should never be closed for any cause. Fresh air admitted by a hot-air  register and impure air passed out by a chimney, form a simple and  thorough system. Our sleeping apartments demand especial care. As soon as  the occupants leave the room, the bedclothes should be removed, and laid  on the backs of chairs to air; the bed be shaken up; and the windows  thrown open. In the summer, the windows may be closed before the sun is  high; the house is then left filled with the cool morning air. In damp and  cold weather, a fire should be lighted in sleeping apartments,  particularly if used by children [Footnote: In winter, children should  always be given a moderately warm, well-ventilated bedroom, with light,  fleecy bed coverings. Says a recent English writer: \"The loving care which  prescribes for children a cold bedroom and a hot, sweltering bed is of the  nature that kills. Buried in blankets, their delicate skins become  overheated and relaxed, while they are irritated by perspiration; at the  same time, the most delicate tissues of all, in the lungs, are dealing  with air abnormally frigid. The poor little victims of combined ignorance  and kindness thus toss and dream, feverish and troubled, under a mass of  bedclothes, while the well-meaning mother, soothed by a bedroom fire,  slumbers peacefully through this working out of the sad process of the  'survival of the fittest.'\"] or delicate persons, to dry the bedclothing,  and also to prevent a chill on the part of the occupants. It is not  necessary to go shivering to bed in order to harden one's constitution.    WONDERS OF RESPIRATION.--The perfection of the organs of respiration  challenges our admiration. So delicate are they that the least pressure  would cause exquisite pain, yet tons of air surge to and fro through their  intricate passages, and bathe their innermost cells. We yearly perform at  least seven million acts of breathing, inhaling one hundred thousand cubic  feet of air, and purifying over three thousand five hundred tons of blood.  This gigantic process goes on constantly, never wearies or worries us, and  we wonder at it only when science reveals to us its magnitude. In  addition, by a wise economy, the process of respiration is made to  subserve a second use no less important, and the air we exhale, passing  through the organs of voice, is transformed into prayers of faith, songs  of hope, and words of social cheer.

[Illustration: A, _the natural position of the internal organs._ B  _when deformed by tight lacing Marshall says that the liver and the  stomach have, in this way, been forced downward almost as low as the  pelvis._]    DISEASES, ETC.--1. _Constriction of the Lungs_ is produced by tight  clothing. The ribs are thus forced inward, the size of the chest is  diminished, and the amount of inhaled air decreased. Stiff clothing, and  especially a garment that will not admit of a full breath without  inconvenience, will prevent that free movement of the ribs so essential to  health. Any infraction of the laws of respiration, even though it be  fashionable, will result in diminished vitality and vigor, and will be  fearfully punished by sickness and weakness through the whole life.    2. _Bronchitis_ (bron-ki'-tis) is an inflammation (see Inflammation)  of the mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes. It is accompanied by an  increased secretion of mucus, and consequent coughing.    3. _Pleurisy_ is an inflammation of the pleura. It is sometimes  caused by an injury to the ribs, and results in a secretion of water  within the membrane.    4. _Pneumonia_ (_pneuma_, breath) is an inflammation of the  lungs, affecting chiefly the air cells.    5. _Consumption_ is a disease which destroys the substance of the  lungs. Like other lung difficulties, it is caused largely by a want of  pure air, a liberal supply of which is the best treatment that can be  prescribed for it. [Footnote: If I were seriously ill of consumption, I  would live outdoors day and night, except in rainy weather or midwinter;  then I would sleep in an unplastered log house.

Therefore the Spaniards were obliged to unload the ship and  take all the cargo ashore close to the town, to a stockade which was  given them for that purpose. For the time being the Japanese gave the  Spaniards a good reception, but as to repairing the ship and leaving  port again, the latter were given to understand that it could not be  done without permission and license from Taicosama, the sovereign of  Japon, who was at his court in Miaco, one hundred leguas from that  port. General Don Matia de Landecho and his companions, in order  to lose no time, resolved to send their ambassadors to court with a  valuable gift from the ship's cargo for Taicosama, to beg him to order  their departure. They sent on this mission Christoval de Mercado,  three other Spaniards, Fray Juan Pobre, of the Franciscan order,  and Fray Juan Tamayo, of the Augustinian order, who were aboard the  vessel. They were to confer concerning this affair with Taico in Miaco,  and were to avail themselves of the Franciscan fathers who were in  Miaco. The latter had gone as ambassadors from the Filipinas to settle  matters between Xapon and Manila, and were residing at court in a  permanent house and hospital, with Taico's sufferance. There they were  making a few converts, although with considerable opposition from the  religious of the Society of Jesus established in the same kingdom. The  latter asserted other religious to be forbidden by apostolic briefs and  royal decrees to undertake or engage in the conversion of Japon. The  king of Hurando, although to all appearances friendly and kind to  the Spaniards in his port, took great care to keep them and their  merchandise secure. He immediately sent word to court that that ship of  foreigners called Nambajies [85] had been wrecked there, and that the  Spaniards had brought great riches. This kindled Taicosama's greed,  who, in order to get possession of them, sent Ximonojo, one of his  favorites and a member of his council, to Hurando. Ximonojo, upon his  arrival, took possession of all the merchandise, and imprisoned the  Spaniards within a well-guarded palisade, after having forced them to  give up all their possessions and what they had hid, under pain of  death. Having exercised great rigor therein, he returned to court,   after granting permission to the general and others of his suite to go   to Miaco. The ambassadors who had been sent before to Miaco with the   present, were unable to see Taico, although the present was accepted;   nor did they succeed in making any profitable arrangement, although   father Fray Pedro Baptista, superior of the Franciscan religious   residing there, employed many methods for the purpose of remedying the   grievance of the Spaniards. These attempts only served to intensify   the evil; for the favorites, who were infidels and hated the religious   for making converts at court, on seeing Taico so bent upon the riches   of the ship and so unwilling to listen to any restitution, not only   did not ask him to do so, but in order to make the matter easier, and   taking advantage of the occasion, set Taicosama against the Spaniards;   telling him that the religious and the men from the ship were all   subjects of one sovereign, and conquerors of others' kingdoms. They   said that the Spaniards did this by first sending their religious   to the kingdoms, and then entered after with their arms, and that   they would do this with Xapon. They were aided in this purpose by   the fact that when the favorite, who went to seize the property of   the ship, was in Hurando, its pilot, Francisco de Sanda, had shown   him the sea-chart in which could be seen all the countries which had   been discovered, and España and the other kingdoms possessed by his   Majesty, among which were Piru and Nueva España. When the favorite   asked how those distant kingdoms had been gained, the pilot replied   that the religious had entered first and preached their religion,   and then the soldiers had followed and subdued them. It is true that   the said pilot imprudently gave those reasons, which Ximonojo noted   well and kept in mind, in order to relate them to Taicosama whenever   a suitable opportunity should present itself, which he now did.    All this, together with the persistency with which the religious begged  Taico to restore the merchandise to the Spaniards, resulted in angering  him thoroughly, and like the barbarous and so avaricious tyrant that  he was, he gave orders to crucify them all and all the religious  who preached the religion of Namban  [86] in his kingdoms. Five  religious who were in the house at Miaco were immediately seized,  together with another from the \"San Felipe\" who had joined them, and  all the Japanese preachers and teachers. [87] It was also understood  that the persecution would extend to the other orders and Christians  in Japon, whereupon all received great fear and confusion. But later  Taico's wrath was moderated, for, allowing himself to be entreated,  he declared that only the religious who had been found in the house  at Miaco, and their companions, the Japanese preachers and teachers,  who were arrested, would be crucified; and that all the others,  together with the Spaniards of the ship, would be allowed to return  to Manila. Fonzanbrandono, brother of Taracabadono, governor of  Nangasaqui, was entrusted with the execution of the order. He placed  all those who were taken from the house of the Franciscan religious at  Miaco on ox-carts, under a strong guard; namely, Fray Pedro Baptista,  Fray Martin de Aguirre, Fray Felipe de las Casas, Fray Gonçalo,  Fray Francisco Blanco, Fray Francisco de San Miguel, and twenty-six  [sic] Japanese preachers and teachers with two boys who were in the  service of the religious. Their right ears were cut off, and they were  paraded through the streets of Miaco and through those of the cities  of Fugimen, Usaca, and Sacai, [88] to the great grief and sorrow  of all Christians who saw their sufferings. The sentence and cause  of their martyrdom was written on a tablet in Chinese characters,  which was carried hanging on a spear; and read as follows.    Sentence of the Combaco, [89] lord of Xapon, against the discalced  religious and their teachers, whom he has ordered to be martyred  in Nangasaqui.    Inasmuch as these men came from the Luzones, from the island of Manila,  in the capacity of ambassadors, and were allowed to remain in the city  of Miaco, preaching the Christian religion, which in former years I  have strictly forbidden: I order that they be executed together with  the Japanese who embraced their religion. Therefore these twenty-four  [sic] men will be crucified in the city of Nangasaqui. And whereas  I again forbid the teaching of this religion henceforward: let all  understand this. I command that this decree be carried out; and should  any person dare to violate this order, he shall be punished together  with his whole family. Given on the first of Echo, and second of the  moon. [90]    Thus these holy men were taken to Nangasaqui. There, on a hill sown  with wheat, in sight of the town and port, and near a house and  hospital called San Lazaro, established in Nangasaqui by the said  religious on their first coming from the Filipinas, before going  up to the capital, they were all crucified in a row. The religious  were placed in the middle and the others on either side upon high  crosses, with iron staples at their throats, hands, and feet, and  with long, sharp iron lances thrust up from below and crosswise  through their sides.  [91] Thus did they render their souls to their  Creator for whom they died with great resolution, on the fifth of  February, day of St. Agueda, of the year one thousand five hundred and  ninety-seven. They left behind in that ploughed field, and through it  in all that kingdom, a great quantity of seed sown, which they watered  with their blood, and from which we hope to gather abundant fruit of  a numerous conversion to our holy Catholic faith. Before these holy  men were crucified, they wrote a letter to Doctor Antonio de Morga,  in Manila, by the hand of Fray Martin de Aguirre, which reads word  for word as follows.    To Doctor Morga, lieutenant-governor of Manila, whom may God protect,  etc., Manila.    Farewell, Doctor! farewell! Our Lord, not regarding my sins, has,  in His mercy, been pleased to make me one of a band of twenty-four  [sic] servants of God, who are about to die for love of Him. Six of  us are friars of St. Francis, and eighteen are native Japanese. With  hopes that many more will follow in the same path, may your Grace  receive the last farewell and the last embraces of all this company,  for we all acknowledge the support which you have manifested toward  the affairs of this conversion. And now, in taking leave, we beg  of you--and I especially--to make the protection of this field of  Christendom the object of your special care. Since you are a father,  and look with favor upon all things which may concern the mission of  the religious in this conversion, so may your Grace find one who will  protect and intercede for you before God in time of need. Farewell  sir! Will your Grace give my last adieu to Doña Juana. May our Lord  preserve, etc. From the road to execution, January twenty-eight,  one thousand five hundred and ninety-seven.    This king's greed has been much whetted by what he stole from the  \"San Felipe.\" It is said that next year he will go to Luzon, and that  he does not go this year because of being busy with the Coreans. In  order to gain his end, he intends to take the islands of Lequios [92]  and Hermosa, throw forces from them into Cagayan, and thence to fall  upon Manila, if God does not first put a stop to his advance. Your  Graces will attend to what is fitting and necessary. [93]"]]]
