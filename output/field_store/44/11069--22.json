We kids went to school while Dode and Papa went about farming the  small farm and improving the large one.  The dry weather  prevailed throughout the year.  Grazing dried up and cattle got  poor.  Papa did what he could to feed his family and his  livestock.    The United States was at war with Germany and, luckily for us,  Uncle Sam was buying rabbits.  Jackrabbits brought ten cents each  and cottontails brought six or eight cents.  When we killed a  rabbit, all we had to do was cut open his abdomen and sling his  intestines out.  Then we pitched the rabbits into the wagon and  took them to town in the next two or three days.    We were looking for most any honorable way to pick up an extra  dollar.  I have seen Papa and Mama take a 22 rifle and a lunch  and some horse feed for their team and go out in a wagon and stay  all day, while we kids were in school.  Before night they would  come home with rabbits piled eight or ten inches deep all over  the wagon bed.    One man bought a single-shot 22-rifle and some shells on credit--  about eight dollars worth.  In one week he brought in enough  rabbits to pay off the debt.  That was one time you might say  rabbits saved our lives.    During the dry weather, while we were slowly losing about  everything we ever had, Papa hired out to haul cottonseed cake in  his wagon to ranchers somewhere west of Lamesa.  I didn't know  where he was taking it but there were times I didn't see him more  than once or twice a week.    Monroe Hamilton was one of our neighbors.  He and his family  lived about a mile from us.  During the drought of 1917 his work  horses got so weak and poor that they became exhausted while  plowing in the field.  They stopped in the middle of the field  and had to be unhitched and walked home.  He began feeding them  more and working them less while they regained their strength.  Mid-afternoon was about as long as they could keep working.    By the time the horses were strong enough to work all day again,  they had become accustomed to stopping their work about mid-  afternoon and they refused to pull the plow after that time of  day.    One day Monroe became so unhappy with them that he unhitched them  in the field where they had staged their sit-down strike, drove  them to the barn, hitched them to his wagon and trotted them  eight miles to Lamesa to get the mail.  Then he trotted them  eight miles back home.  They had never experienced becoming  exhausted while pulling a wagon out on the road.  They were not  smart enough to pull a sit-down strike anywhere except plowing in  the field.    During World War I, Frank wanted to join the Army.  But Mama and  Papa did their part in talking him out of it.  He was too young  to be drafted.  But he wasn't at home much after that.  He worked  here and there in defense work.  He told us he worked awhile in a  powder factory in West Virginia.  After the war was over, he came  home in 1919 and worked some for Dawson County, doing some  mechanical work on a road grader tractor.  Finally, Papa bought a  big truck and let Frank take it and go wherever he could find a  job, hauling whatever anyone would pay him to haul.    Another source of income for us during the dry weather was in  gathering and selling dry bones.  There was a ready market for  bones in Lamesa.  A lot of cows had died here and there due to  dry weather and cold weather.  We hauled and sold quite a few  bones.    We also salvaged a lot of rawhides--dry rawhides.  We couldn't  sell them but we could use them ourselves.  They were hard and  stiff, but by soaking them in water we were able to straighten  them out, cut them into strips and use the strips for braiding  whips and making other useful articles to be used on the farm.    Despite all the work, we boys had some time off for fun and  adventure.  There were times after rains when it was too wet to  plow.  But then there might be bushes to be grubbed or we might  have to build fence or maybe chop wood or do any one of a dozen  things that kept bobbing up to be done.  If and when we got all  those things done, and then if it was still too wet to plow or  hoe weeds, then we had some time off for ourselves.  Also on  Saturday afternoons we took time off, unless there was something  which just had to be done.    We always had Sundays off for rest and play, but never for work  of any kind, that is, work which was of any monetary value,  except routine work like milking cows and feeding the livestock.  The question of work came up one Sunday afternoon when we put  some new tires on our car to go watch an airplane at Lamesa.  But  then, that was regarded as play since it involved only recreation  and had nothing to do with work which could in any way produce  anything of value.  Sunday was a day for going to church,  resting, visiting friends, playing games, reading, or just  sitting.    Now, if we boys wanted to go out into the pasture and kill a  snake or two with sticks, that was okay.  And if we could get a  rabbit without a gun, that was all right too.  But, no guns on  Sundays.  When a rabbit ran into a prairie dog hole, we could  twist him out with a barbed wire.  That was okay on Sunday.    We would run a barbed wire down into the hole and twist it by  means of a crank at the upper end, which was nothing more than  the wire itself bent in the shape of a small crank.  As the wire  revolved over and over down in the hole, it would get the barbs  entangled in the rabbit's fur and we could pull him out of the  hole.  That was called \"rabbit-twisting.\"    The idea of sin being connected with shooting a gun on Sunday had  probably been handed down from pioneer days when men lived by  hunting game.  In those days hunting was a means of making a  living, therefore it was work, and work was not to be done on  Sunday.    Despite the dry weather that seemed to threaten our very  existence, we used water from our well and grew quite a bit of  garden produce.  Our garden was like an oasis in a dust bowl.  And then, one day we received a bit of news that was like an  oasis of good news in our desert of bad news.    Uncle Robert got word to us that Old Scotch had returned home to  the Exum place.  Papa began getting the car ready immediately and  went after him.  I think maybe Joel went with Papa.    A family named Bristow was living on the Exum farm when Old  Scotch returned.  Mr. Bristow thought this might be our dog, but  he was not sure.  He said it looked as though the dog had  traveled a long, long way.  The first thing Old Scotch did was  lie down in the yard and rest.  Then he chased all the chickens  out of the yard as he had done many times before.  Next he went  into the house and slowly looked through all the rooms, as if  looking for something familiar to him.  Finding no one he knew,  he went back out into the yard to rest again.    Then Mr. Bristow phoned Robert Johnson to see if he might know  our dog.  Robert drove over in his Buick.  Old Scotch met him way  down the road and leaped for joy beside the car all the way back  to the house.  He had finally found new hope.  The Buick motor  was music to his ears and, although Robert was not home folks, at  least the dog knew him as a friendly neighbor.    When Robert got out of his car, Old Scotch leaped up into the  front seat, sat down and put his paws on the steering wheel.  When Robert saw him do that, he turned to Mr. Bristow and said,  \"That's their dog all right.\"    We had no telephone on our farm on the plains.  And we were ten  miles from Lamesa.  I don't know how Robert got word to us about  Old Scotch, but Papa lost no time in bringing him home.  The  round trip was 280 miles.    When Papa brought the dog home he was covered with lice, there  were sores on his body, some of his beautiful coat had fallen  away and his feet were sore from traveling so far.  He had lost a  lot of weight, was poor and half starved.    We believe that some Gypsies stole him and tied him to their  wagon.  Gypsies came by our farm now and then, and both we and  our neighbors had a low opinion of them.  Theirs were the only  poor, skinny dogs we ever saw.    Anyway, we were mighty glad to have Old Scotch back with us and  we soon had him as fat and sassy and as good looking as ever.  And he was right there with us all the rest of his life.    Now that we had our dog back home, it was time again to settle  down to facing the realities of dry weather and sandstorms.  One  day there came a sandstorm from the southwest, as usual.  We had  many sandstorms but this one was not just one of the ordinary  ones.  This was an extra special--the granddaddy of all  sandstorms.  We kids were in school at Ballard and it got so dark  in the schoolhouse we couldn't see to read.  We could only sit  and talk or play games.  You could clean the dust from the top of  your desk, and two minutes later write your name with your finger  in the new dust.    When school was out at four o'clock in the afternoon, it was so  dark the teacher was afraid some of us couldn't make it home.  She held us there until our parents came for us.  The wind was  still very strong.  Everyone drove with their lights on, not to  see the road but to see each other.    We couldn't see the sunset--couldn't even see where the sun was  supposed to set.  We didn't believe there were any clouds, only  sand and dust.  But we really couldn't tell.  Anyway, dark came  way before its time.    At suppertime that night there was so much sand and dust in the  air in our kitchen that we ate supper with the tablecloth still  spread over the table, over the food, and over the plates we were  eating out of.  We held the cloth up with one hand to shelter our  plates while we reached under the cloth with the other hand to  bring food from our plates to our mouths.    During the afternoon, sand blinded the rabbits and they couldn't  find their way to their burrows.  Jackrabbits don't"]]]
