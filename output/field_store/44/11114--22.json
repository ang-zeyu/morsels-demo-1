But brave Ancaios the helmsman cheered up  their hearts once more, and bade them leap on land, and haul the ship  with ropes and rollers for many a weary day, whether over land, or mud,  or ice, I know not, for the song is mixed and broken like a dream.  And  it says next, how they came to the rich nation of the famous long-lived  men; and to the coast of the Cimmerians, who never saw the sun, buried  deep in the glens of the snow mountains; and to the fair land of  Hermione, where dwelt the most righteous of all nations; and to the gates  of the world below, and to the dwelling-place of dreams.    And at last Ancaios shouted, 'Endure a little while, brave friends, the  worst is surely past; for I can see the pure west wind ruffle the water,  and hear the roar of ocean on the sands.  So raise up the mast, and set  the sail, and face what comes like men.'    Then out spoke the magic bough, 'Ah, would that I had perished long ago,  and been whelmed by the dread blue rocks, beneath the fierce swell of the  Euxine!  Better so, than to wander for ever, disgraced by the guilt of my  princes; for the blood of Absyrtus still tracks me, and woe follows hard  upon woe.  And now some dark horror will clutch me, if I come near the  Isle of Ierne. {132}  Unless you will cling to the land, and sail  southward and southward for ever, I shall wander beyond the Atlantic, to  the ocean which has no shore.'    Then they blest the magic bough, and sailed southward along the land.  But ere they could pass Ierne, the land of mists and storms, the wild  wind came down, dark and roaring, and caught the sail, and strained the  ropes.  And away they drove twelve nights, on the wide wild western sea,  through the foam, and over the rollers, while they saw neither sun nor  stars.  And they cried again, 'We shall perish, for we know not where we  are.  We are lost in the dreary damp darkness, and cannot tell north from  south.'    But Lynceus the long-sighted called gaily from the bows, 'Take heart  again, brave sailors; for I see a pine-clad isle, and the halls of the  kind Earth-mother, with a crown of clouds around them.'    But Orpheus said, 'Turn from them, for no living man can land there:  there is no harbour on the coast, but steep-walled cliffs all round.'    So Ancaios turned the ship away; and for three days more they sailed on,  till they came to Aiaia, Circe's home, and the fairy island of the West.  {133}    And there Jason bid them land, and seek about for any sign of living man.  And as they went inland Circe met them, coming down toward the ship; and  they trembled when they saw her, for her hair, and face, and robes shone  like flame.    And she came and looked at Medeia; and Medeia hid her face beneath her  veil.    And Circe cried, 'Ah, wretched girl, have you forgotten all your sins,  that you come hither to my island, where the flowers bloom all the year  round?  Where is your aged father, and the brother whom you killed?  Little do I expect you to return in safety with these strangers whom you  love.  I will send you food and wine: but your ship must not stay here,  for it is foul with sin, and foul with sin its crew.'    And the heroes prayed her, but in vain, and cried, 'Cleanse us from our  guilt!' But she sent them away, and said, 'Go on to Malea, and there you  may be cleansed, and return home.'    Then a fair wind rose, and they sailed eastward by Tartessus on the  Iberian shore, till they came to the Pillars of Hercules, and the  Mediterranean Sea.  And thence they sailed on through the deeps of  Sardinia, and past the Ausonian islands, and the capes of the Tyrrhenian  shore, till they came to a flowery island, upon a still bright summer's  eve.  And as they neared it, slowly and wearily, they heard sweet songs  upon the shore.  But when Medeia heard it, she started, and cried,  'Beware, all heroes, for these are the rocks of the Sirens.  You must  pass close by them, for there is no other channel; but those who listen  to that song are lost.'    Then Orpheus spoke, the king of all minstrels, 'Let them match their song  against mine.  I have charmed stones, and trees, and dragons, how much  more the hearts of men!'  So he caught up his lyre, and stood upon the  poop, and began his magic song.    And now they could see the Sirens on Anthemousa, the flowery isle; three  fair maidens sitting on the beach, beneath a red rock in the setting sun,  among beds of crimson poppies and golden asphodel.  Slowly they sung and  sleepily, with silver voices, mild and clear, which stole over the golden  waters, and into the hearts of all the heroes, in spite of Orpheus' song.    And all things stayed around and listened; the gulls sat in white lines  along the rocks; on the beach great seals lay basking, and kept time with  lazy heads; while silver shoals of fish came up to hearken, and whispered  as they broke the shining calm.  The Wind overhead hushed his whistling,  as he shepherded his clouds toward the west; and the clouds stood in mid  blue, and listened dreaming, like a flock of golden sheep.    And as the heroes listened, the oars fell from their hands, and their  heads drooped on their breasts, and they closed their heavy eyes; and  they dreamed of bright still gardens, and of slumbers under murmuring  pines, till all their toil seemed foolishness, and they thought of their  renown no more.    Then one lifted his head suddenly, and cried, 'What use in wandering for  ever?  Let us stay here and rest awhile.'  And another, 'Let us row to  the shore, and hear the words they sing.'  And another, 'I care not for  the words, but for the music.  They shall sing me to sleep, that I may  rest.'    And Butes, the son of Pandion, the fairest of all mortal men, leapt out  and swam toward the shore, crying, 'I come, I come, fair maidens, to live  and die here, listening to your song.'    Then Medeia clapped her hands together, and cried, 'Sing louder, Orpheus,  sing a bolder strain; wake up these hapless sluggards, or none of them  will see the land of Hellas more.'    Then Orpheus lifted his harp, and crashed his cunning hand across the  strings; and his music and his voice rose like a trumpet through the  still evening air; into the air it rushed like thunder, till the rocks  rang and the sea; and into their souls it rushed like wine, till all  hearts beat fast within their breasts.    And he sung the song of Perseus, how the Gods led him over land and sea,  and how he slew the loathly Gorgon, and won himself a peerless bride; and  how he sits now with the Gods upon Olympus, a shining star in the sky,  immortal with his immortal bride, and honoured by all men below.    So Orpheus sang, and the Sirens, answering each other across the golden  sea, till Orpheus' voice drowned the Sirens', and the heroes caught their  oars again.    And they cried, 'We will be men like Perseus, and we will dare and suffer  to the last.  Sing us his song again, brave Orpheus, that we may forget  the Sirens and their spell.'    And as Orpheus sang, they dashed their oars into the sea, and kept time  to his music, as they fled fast away; and the Sirens' voices died behind  them, in the hissing of the foam along their wake.    But Butes swam to the shore, and knelt down before the Sirens, and cried,  'Sing on! sing on!'  But he could say no more, for a charmed sleep came  over him, and a pleasant humming in his ears; and he sank all along upon  the pebbles, and forgot all heaven and earth, and never looked at that  sad beach around him, all strewn with the bones of men.    Then slowly rose up those three fair sisters, with a cruel smile upon  their lips; and slowly they crept down towards him, like leopards who  creep upon their prey; and their hands were like the talons of eagles as  they stept across the bones of their victims to enjoy their cruel feast.    But fairest Aphrodite saw him from the highest Idalian peak, and she  pitied his youth and his beauty, and leapt up from her golden throne; and  like a falling star she cleft the sky, and left a trail of glittering  light, till she stooped to the Isle of the Sirens, and snatched their  prey from their claws.  And she lifted Butes as he lay sleeping, and  wrapt him in golden mist; and she bore him to the peak of Lilybaeum, and  he slept there many a pleasant year.    But when the Sirens saw that they were conquered, they shrieked for envy  and rage, and leapt from the beach into the sea, and were changed into  rocks until this day.    Then they came to the straits by Lilybaeum, and saw Sicily, the  three-cornered island, under which Enceladus the giant lies groaning day  and night, and when he turns the earth quakes, and his breath bursts out  in roaring flames from the highest cone of AEtna, above the chestnut  woods.  And there Charybdis caught them in its fearful coils of wave, and  rolled mast-high about them, and spun them round and round; and they  could go neither back nor forward, while the whirlpool sucked them in.    And while they struggled they saw near them, on the other side the  strait, a rock stand in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6782"],[0,"The Robbers (#17)"],[1,"throws himself on the sofa in great  confusion). Only keep my council till--till I have collected my  thoughts.    HERMANN. I suppose till you have hired a dozen assassins to silence my  tongue forever! Is it not so! But (in his ear) the secret is committed  to paper, which my heirs will publish.                              [Exit.]                          SCENE IX.                   FRANCIS, solus.    Francis! Francis! Francis! What is all this? Where was thy courage?  where thy once so fertile wit? Woe! Woe! And to be betrayed by thy  own instruments! The pillars of my good fortune are tottering to their  fall, the fences are broken down, and the raging enemy is already  bursting in upon me. Well! this calls for some bold and sudden resolve!  What if I went in person--and secretly plunged this sword in his body?  A wounded man is but a child. Quick! I'll do it. (He walks with a  resolute step to the end of the stage, but stops suddenly as if overcome  by sensations of horror). Who are these gliding behind me? (Rolling  his eyes fearfully) Faces such as I have never yet beheld. What  hideous yells do I hear! I feel that I have courage--courage! oh yes to  overflowing! But if a mirror should betray me? or my shadow! or the  whistling of the murderous stroke! Ugh! Ugh! How my hair bristles! A  shudder creeps through my frame. (He lets a poigniard fall from under  his clothes.) I am no coward--perhaps somewhat too tenderhearted. Yes!  that is it! These are the last struggles of expiring virtue. I revere  them. I should indeed be a monster were I to become the murderer of my  own brother. No! no! no! That thought be far from me! Let me cherish  this vestige of humanity. I will not murder. Nature, thou hast  conquered. I still feel something here that seems like--affection. He  shall live.                              [Exit.]                 Enter HERMANN, timidly.    HERMANN. Lady Amelia! Lady Amelia!    AMELIA. Unhappy man! why dost thou disturb me?    HERMANN. I must throw this weight from my soul before it drags it down  to hell. (Falls down before her.) Pardon! pardon! I have grievously  injured you, Lady Amelia!    AMELIA. Arise! depart! I will hear nothing. (Going.)    HERMANN (detaining her). No; stay! In the name of Heaven! In the name  of the Eternal! You must know all!    AMELIA. Not another word. I forgive you. Depart in peace. (In the  act of going.)    HERMANN. Only one word--listen; it will restore all your peace of mind.    AMELIA (turning back and looking at him with astonishment). How,  friend? Who in heaven or on earth can restore my peace of mind?    HERMANN. One word from my lips can do it. Hear me!    AMELIA (seizing his hand with compassion). Good sir! Can one word from  thy lips burst asunder the portals of eternity?    HERMANN. (rising). Charles lives!    AMELIA (screaming). Wretch!    HERMANN. Even so. And one word more. Your uncle--    AMELIA. (rushing upon him). Thou liest!    HERMANN. Your uncle--    AMELIA. Charles lives?    HERMANN. And your uncle--    AMELIA. Charles lives?    HERMANN. And your uncle too--betray me not!                  (HERMANN runs off)    AMELIA (stands a long while like one petrified; after which she starts  up wildly, and rushes after HERMANN.) Charles lives!                    SCENE II.--Country near the Danube.         THE ROBBERS (encamped on a rising ground, under trees,             their horses are grazing below.)    CHARLES. Here must I lie (throwing himself upon the ground). I feel as  if my limbs were all shattered. My tongue is as dry as a potsherd  (SCHWEITZER disappears unperceived.) I would ask one of you to bring me  a handful of water from that stream, but you are all tired to death.    SCHWARZ. Our wine-flasks too are all empty.    CHARLES. See how beautiful the harvest looks! The trees are breaking  with the weight of their fruit. The vines are full of promise.    GRIMM. It is a fruitful year.    CHARLES. Do you think so? Then at least one toil in the world will be  repaid. One? Yet in the night a hailstorm may come and destroy it all.    SCHWARZ. That is very possible. It all may be destroyed an hour before  the reaping.    CHARLES. Just what I say. All will be destroyed. Why should man  prosper in that which he has in common with the ant, while he fails in  that which places him on a level with the gods. Or is this the aim and  limit of his destiny?    SCHWARZ. I know not.    CHARLES. Thou hast said well; and wilt have done better, if thou never  seekest to know. Brother, I have looked on men, their insect cares and  their giant projects,--their god-like plans and mouse-like occupations,  their intensely eager race after happiness--one trusting to the  fleetness of his horse,--another to the nose of his ass,--a third to his  own legs; this checkered lottery of life, in which so many stake their  innocence and their leaven to snatch a prize, and,--blanks are all they  draw--for they find, too late, that there was no prize in the wheel. It  is a drama, brother, enough to bring tears into your eyes, while it  shakes your sides with laughter.    SCHWARZ. How gloriously the sun is setting yonder!    CHARLES (absorbed in the scene). So dies a hero! Worthy of adoration!    SCHWARZ. You seem deeply moved.    CHARLES. When I, was but a boy--it was my darling thought to live like  him, like him to die--(with suppressed grief.) It was a boyish thought!    GRIMM. It was, indeed.    CHARLES. There was a time--(pressing his hat down upon his face).  I would be alone, comrades.    SCHWARZ. Moor! Moor! Why, what the deuce! How his color changes.    GRIMM. By all the devils! What ails him? Is he ill?    CHARLES. There was a time when I could not have slept had I forgotten  my evening prayers.    GRIMM. Are you beside yourself? Would you let the remembrances of your  boyish years school you now?    CHARLES (lays his head upon the breast of GRIMM). Brother! Brother!    GRIMM. Come! Don't play the child--I pray you    CHARLES. Oh that I were-that I were again a child!    GRIMM. Fie! fie!    SCHWARZ. Cheer up! Behold this smiling landscape--this delicious  evening!    CHARLES. Yes, friends, this world is very lovely--    SCHWARZ. Come, now, that was well said.    CHARLES. This earth so glorious!--    GRIMM. Right--right--I love to hear you talk thus.    CHARLES. (sinking back). And I so hideous in' this lovely world--  a monster on this glorious earth!    GRIMM. Oh dear! oh dear!    CHARLES. My innocence! give me back my innocence! Behold, every living  thing is gone forth to bask in the cheering rays of the vernal sun--why  must I alone inhale the torments of hell out of the joys of heaven? All  are so happy, all so united in brotherly love, by the spirit of peace!  The whole world one family, and one Father above--but He not my father!  I alone the outcast, I alone rejected from the ranks of the blessed--the  sweet name of child is not for me--never for me the soul-thrilling  glance of her I love--never, never the bosom friend's embrace--(starting  back wildly)--surrounded by murderers--hemmed in by hissing vipers--  riveted to vice with iron fetters--whirling headlong on the frail reed  of sin to the gulf of perdition--amid the blooming flowers of a glad  world, a howling Abaddon!    SCHWARZ (to the others). How strange! I never saw him thus before.    CHARLES (with melancholy). Oh, that I might return again to my mother's  womb. That I might be born a beggar! I should desire no more,--no  more, oh heaven!--but that I might be like one of those poor laborers!  Oh, I would toil till the blood streamed down my temples--to buy myself  the luxury of one guiltless slumber--the blessedness of a single tear.    GRIMM (to the others). A little patience--the paroxysm is nearly over.    CHARLES. There was a time when my tears flowed so freely. Oh, those  days of peace! Dear home of my fathers--ye verdant halcyon vales!  O all ye Elysian scenes of my childhood!--will you never return?--will  your delicious breezes never cool my burning bosom? Mourn with me,  Nature, mourn! They will never return! never will their delicious  breezes cool my burning bosom! They are gone! gone! irrevocably gone!             Enter SCHWEITZER with water in his hat.    SCHWEITZER (offering him water in his hat). Drink, captain; here is  plenty of water, and cold as ice.    SCHWARZ. You are bleeding! What have you been doing?    SCHWEITZER. A bit of a freak, you fool, which had well-nigh cost me two  legs and a neck. As I was frolicking along the steep sandbanks of the  river, plump, in a moment, the whole concern slid from under me, and I  after it, some ten fathoms deep;--there I lay, and, as I was recovering  my five senses, lo and behold, the most sparkling water in the gravel!  Not so much amiss this time, said I to myself, for the caper I have cut.  The captain will be sure to relish a drink.    CHARLES (returns him the hat and wipes his face). But you are covered  with mud, Schweitzer, and we can't see the scar which the Bohemian  horseman marked on your forehead--your water was good, Schweitzer--and  those scars become you well.    SCHWEITZER. Bah! There's room for a score or two more yet.    CHARLES. Yes, boys--it was a hot day's work--and only one man lost.  Poor Roller! he died a noble death. A marble monument would be erected  to his memory had he died in any other cause than mine. Let this  suffice. (He wipes the tears from his eyes.) How many, did you say, of  the enemy were left on the field?    SCHWEITZER. A hundred and sixty huzzars, ninety-three dragoons, some  forty chasseurs--in all about three hundred.    CHARLES. Three hundred for one! Every one of you has a claim upon this  head. (He bares his head.) By this uplifted dagger! As my Soul liveth,  I will never forsake you!    SCHWEITZER. Swear not! You do not know but you may yet be happy, and  repent your oath.    CHARLES. By the ashes of my Roller! I will never forsake you.                   Enter KOSINSKY."]]]
