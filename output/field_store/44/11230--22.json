The fens of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, before   the rivers were embanked, the water pumped off, the forests felled,   and the reed-beds ploughed up, were exactly in the same state.  The   vast deposits of peat between Cambridge and the sea, often filled   with timber-trees, either fallen or upright as they grew, and often   mixed with beds of sand or mud, brought down in floods, were formed   in exactly the same way; and if they had remained undrained, then   that slow sinking, which geologists say is going on over the whole   area of the Fens, would have brought them gradually, but surely,   below the sea-level, to be covered up by new forests, and converted   in due time into coal.  And future geologists would have found--they   may find yet, if, which God forbid, England should become barbarous   and the trees be thrown out of cultivation--instead of fossil   Lepidodendra and Sigillariae, Calamites and ferns, fossil ashes and   oaks, alders and poplars, bulrushes and reeds.  Almost the only   fossil fern would have been that tall and beautiful Lastraea   Thelypteris, once so abundant, now all but destroyed by drainage and   the plough.    We need not, therefore, fancy any extraordinary state of things on   this planet while our English coal was being formed.  The climate of   the northern hemisphere--Britain, at least, and Nova Scotia--was   warmer than now, to judge from the abundance of ferns; and especially   of tree-ferns; but not so warm, to judge from the presence of   conifers (trees of the pine tribe), as the Tropics.  Moreover, there   must have been, it seems to me, a great scarcity of animal-life.    Insects are found, beautifully preserved; a few reptiles, too, and   land-shells; but very few.  And where are the traces of such a   swarming life as would be entombed were a tropic forest now sunk;   which is found entombed in many parts of our English fens?  The only   explanation which I can offer is this--that the club-mosses, tree-  ferns, pines, and other low-ranked vegetation of the coal afforded   little or no food for animals, as the same families of plants do to   this day; and if creatures can get nothing to eat, they certainly   cannot multiply and replenish the earth.  But, be that as it may, the   fact that coal is buried forest is not affected.    Meanwhile, the shape and arrangements of sea and land must have been   utterly different from what they are now.  Where was that great land,   off which great rivers ran to deposit our coal-measures in their   deltas?  It has been supposed, for good reasons, that north-western   France, Belgium, Holland, and Germany were then under the sea; that   Denmark and Norway were joined to Scotland by a continent, a tongue   of which ran across the centre of England, and into Ireland, dividing   the northern and southern coal-fields.  But how far to the west and   north did that old continent stretch?  Did it, as it almost certainly   did long ages afterwards, join Greenland and North America with   Scotland and Norway?  Were the northern fields of Nova Scotia, which   are of the same geological age as our own, and contain the same   plants, laid down by rivers which ran off the same continent as ours?    Who can tell now?  That old land, and all record of it, save what   these fragmentary coal-measures can give, are buried in the dark   abyss of countless ages; and we can only look back with awe, and   comfort ourselves with the thought--Let Time be ever so vast, yet   Time is not Eternity.    One word more.  If my readers have granted that all for which I have   argued is probable, they will still have a right to ask for further   proof.    They will be justified in saying:  \"You say that coal is transformed   vegetable matter; but can you show us how the transformation takes   place?  Is it possible according to known natural laws?\"    The chemist must answer that.  And he tells us that wood can become   lignite, or wood-coal, by parting with its oxygen, in the shape of   carbonic acid gas, or choke-damp; and then common or bituminous coal,   by parting with its hydrogen, chiefly in the form of carburetted   hydrogen--the gas with which we light our streets.  That is about as   much as the unscientific reader need know.  But it is a fresh   corroboration of the theory that coal has been once vegetable fibre,   for it shows how vegetable fibre can, by the laws of nature, become   coal.  And it certainly helps us to believe that a thing has been   done, if we are shown that it can be done.    This fact explains, also, why in mines of wood-coal carbonic acid,   i.e. choke-damp, alone is given off.  For in the wood-coal a great   deal of the hydrogen still remains.  In mines of true coal, not only   is choke-damp given off, but that more terrible pest of the miners,   fire-damp, or explosive carburetted hydrogen and olefiant gases.  Now   the occurrence of that fire-damp in mines proves that changes are   still going on in the coal:  that it is getting rid of its hydrogen,   and so progressing toward the state of anthracite or culm--stone-coal   as it is sometimes called.  In the Pennsylvanian coal-fields some of   the coal has actually done this, under the disturbing force of   earthquakes; for the coal, which is bituminous, like our common coal,   to the westward where the strata are horizontal, becomes gradually   anthracite as it is tossed and torn by the earthquake faults of the   Alleghany and Appalachian mountains.    And is a further transformation possible?  Yes; and more than one.    If we conceive the anthracite cleared of all but its last atoms of   oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, till it has become all but pure   carbon, it would become--as it has become in certain rocks of immense   antiquity, graphite--what we miscall black-lead.  And, after that, it   might go through one transformation more, and that the most startling   of all.  It would need only perfect purification and crystallisation   to become--a diamond; nothing less.  We may consider the coal upon   the fire as the middle term of a series, of which the first is live   wood, and the last diamond; and indulge safely in the fancy that   every diamond in the world has probably, at some remote epoch, formed   part of a growing plant.    A strange transformation; which will look to us more strange, more   truly poetical, the more steadily we consider it.    The coal on the fire; the table at which I write--what are they made   of?  Gas and sunbeams; with a small percentage of ash, or earthy   salts, which need hardly be taken into account.    Gas and sunbeams.  Strange, but true.    The life of the growing plant--and what that life is who can tell?--  laid hold of the gases in the air and in the soil; of the carbonic   acid, the atmospheric air, the water--for that too is gas.  It drank   them in through its rootlets:  it breathed them in through its leaf-  pores, that it might distil them into sap, and bud, and leaf, and   wood.  But it has to take in another element, without which the   distillation and the shaping could never have taken place.  It had to   drink in the sunbeams--that mysterious and complex force which is for   ever pouring from the sun, and making itself partly palpable to our   senses as heat and light.  So the life of the plant seized the   sunbeams, and absorbed them, buried them in itself--no longer as   light and heat, but as invisible chemical force, locked up for ages   in that woody fibre.    So it is.  Lord Lytton told us long ago, in a beautiful song, how      The Wind and the Beam loved the Rose.      But Nature's poetry was more beautiful than man's.  The wind and the   beam loved the rose so well that they made the rose--or rather, the   rose took the wind and the beam, and built up out of them, by her own   inner life, her exquisite texture, hue, and fragrance.    What next?  The rose dies; the timber tree dies; decays down into   vegetable fibre, is buried, and turned to coal:  but the plant cannot   altogether undo its own work.  Even in death and decay it cannot set   free the sunbeams imprisoned in its tissue.  The sun-force must stay,   shut up age after age, invisible, but strong; working at its own   prison-cells; transmuting them, or making them capable of being   transmuted by man, into the manifold products of coal--coke,   petroleum, mineral pitch, gases, coal-tar, benzole, delicate aniline   dyes, and what not, till its day of deliverance comes.    Man digs it, throws it on the fire, a black, dead-seeming lump.  A   corner, an atom of it, warms till it reaches the igniting point; the   temperature at which it is able to combine with oxygen.    And then, like a dormant live thing, awaking after ages to the sense   of its own powers, its own needs, the whole lump is seized, atom   after atom, with an infectious hunger for that oxygen which it lost   centuries since in the bottom of the earth.  It drinks the oxygen in   at every pore; and burns.    And so the spell of ages is broken.  The sun-force bursts its prison-  cells, and blazes into the free atmosphere, as light and heat once   more; returning in a moment into the same forms in which it entered   the growing leaf a thousand centuries since.    Strange it all is, yet true.  But of nature, as of the heart of man,   the old saying stands--that truth is stranger than fiction.        V.  THE LIME IN THE MORTAR        I shall presume in all my readers some slight knowledge about lime.    I shall take for granted, for instance, that all are better informed   than a certain party of Australian black fellows were a few years   since.    In prowling on the track of a party of English settlers, to see what   they could pick up, they came--oh joy!--on a sack of flour, dropped   and left behind in the bush at a certain creek.  The poor savages had   not had such a prospect of a good meal for many a day.  With endless   jabbering and dancing, the whole tribe gathered round the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1027"],[0,"The Lone Star Ranger: A Romance of the Border (#18)"],[1,"  put you back. You raved a lot, and that worried me, because I couldn't  stop you. Anybody trailing us could have heard you a good ways. I don't  know whether I was scared most then or when you were quiet, and it was  so dark and lonely and still all around. Every day I put a stone in your  hat.\"    \"Jennie, you saved my life,\" said Duane.    \"I don't know. Maybe. I did all I knew how to do,\" she replied. \"You  saved mine--more than my life.\"    Their eyes met in a long gaze, and then their hands in a close clasp.    \"Jennie, we're going to get away,\" he said, with gladness. \"I'll be well  in a few days. You don't know how strong I am. We'll hide by day and  travel by night. I can get you across the river.\"    \"And then?\" she asked.    \"We'll find some honest rancher.\"    \"And then?\" she persisted.    \"Why,\" he began, slowly, \"that's as far as my thoughts ever got. It  was pretty hard, I tell you, to assure myself of so much. It means your  safety. You'll tell your story. You'll be sent to some village or town  and taken care of until a relative or friend is notified.\"    \"And you?\" she inquired, in a strange voice.    Duane kept silence.    \"What will you do?\" she went on.    \"Jennie, I'll go back to the brakes. I daren't show my face among  respectable people. I'm an outlaw.\"    \"You're no criminal!\" she declared, with deep passion.    \"Jennie, on this border the little difference between an out law and a  criminal doesn't count for much.\"    \"You won't go back among those terrible men? You, with your gentleness  and sweetness--all that's good about you? Oh, Duane, don't--don't go!\"    \"I can't go back to the outlaws, at least not Bland's band. No, I'll go  alone. I'll lone-wolf it, as they say on the border. What else can I do,  Jennie?\"    \"Oh, I don't know. Couldn't you hide? Couldn't you slip out of Texas--go  far away?\"    \"I could never get out of Texas without being arrested. I could hide,  but a man must live. Never mind about me, Jennie.\"    In three days Duane was able with great difficulty to mount his horse.  During daylight, by short relays, he and Jennie rode back to the main  trail, where they hid again till he had rested. Then in the dark they  rode out of the canons and gullies of the Rim Rock, and early in the  morning halted at the first water to camp.    From that point they traveled after nightfall and went into hiding  during the day. Once across the Nueces River, Duane was assured of  safety for her and great danger for himself. They had crossed into  a country he did not know. Somewhere east of the river there were  scattered ranches. But he was as liable to find the rancher in touch  with the outlaws as he was likely to find him honest. Duane hoped his  good fortune would not desert him in this last service to Jennie. Next  to the worry of that was realization of his condition. He had gotten  up too soon; he had ridden too far and hard, and now he felt that any  moment he might fall from his saddle. At last, far ahead over a barren  mesquite-dotted stretch of dusty ground, he espied a patch of green and  a little flat, red ranch-house. He headed his horse for it and turned a  face he tried to make cheerful for Jennie's sake. She seemed both happy  and sorry.    When near at hand he saw that the rancher was a thrifty farmer. And  thrift spoke for honesty. There were fields of alfalfa, fruit-trees,  corrals, windmill pumps, irrigation-ditches, all surrounding a neat  little adobe house. Some children were playing in the yard. The way  they ran at sight of Duane hinted of both the loneliness and the fear  of their isolated lives. Duane saw a woman come to the door, then a man.  The latter looked keenly, then stepped outside. He was a sandy-haired,  freckled Texan.    \"Howdy, stranger,\" he called, as Duane halted. \"Get down, you an' your  woman. Say, now, air you sick or shot or what? Let me--\"    Duane, reeling in his saddle, bent searching eyes upon the rancher. He  thought he saw good will, kindness, honesty. He risked all on that one  sharp glance. Then he almost plunged from the saddle.    The rancher caught him, helped him to a bench.    \"Martha, come out here!\" he called. \"This man's sick. No; he's shot, or  I don't know blood-stains.\"    Jennie had slipped off her horse and to Duane's side. Duane appeared  about to faint.    \"Air you his wife?\" asked the rancher.    \"No. I'm only a girl he saved from outlaws. Oh, he's so paler Duane,  Duane!\"    \"Buck Duane!\" exclaimed the rancher, excitedly. \"The man who killed  Bland an' Alloway? Say, I owe him a good turn, an' I'll pay it, young  woman.\"    The rancher's wife came out, and with a manner at once kind and  practical essayed to make Duane drink from a flask. He was not so far  gone that he could not recognize its contents, which he refused, and  weakly asked for water. When that was given him he found his voice.    \"Yes, I'm Duane. I've only overdone myself--just all in. The wounds I  got at Bland's are healing. Will you take this girl in--hide her awhile  till the excitement's over among the outlaws?\"    \"I shore will,\" replied the Texan.    \"Thanks. I'll remember you--I'll square it.\"    \"What 're you goin' to do?\"    \"I'll rest a bit--then go back to the brakes.\"    \"Young man, you ain't in any shape to travel. See here--any rustlers on  your trail?\"    \"I think we gave Bland's gang the slip.\"    \"Good. I'll tell you what. I'll take you in along with the girl, an'  hide both of you till you get well. It'll be safe. My nearest neighbor  is five miles off. We don't have much company.\"    \"You risk a great deal. Both outlaws and rangers are hunting me,\" said  Duane.    \"Never seen a ranger yet in these parts. An' have always got along with  outlaws, mebbe exceptin' Bland. I tell you I owe you a good turn.\"    \"My horses might betray you,\" added Duane.    \"I'll hide them in a place where there's water an' grass. Nobody goes to  it. Come now, let me help you indoors.\"    Duane's last fading sensations of that hard day were the strange feel of  a bed, a relief at the removal of his heavy boots, and of Jennie's soft,  cool hands on his hot face.    He lay ill for three weeks before he began to mend, and it was another  week then before he could walk out a little in the dusk of the evenings.  After that his strength returned rapidly. And it was only at the end  of this long siege that he recovered his spirits. During most of his  illness he had been silent, moody.    \"Jennie, I'll be riding off soon,\" he said, one evening. \"I can't impose  on this good man Andrews much longer. I'll never forget his kindness.  His wife, too--she's been so good to us. Yes, Jennie, you and I will  have to say good-by very soon.\"    \"Don't hurry away,\" she replied.    Lately Jennie had appeared strange to him. She had changed from the  girl he used to see at Mrs. Bland's house. He took her reluctance to say  good-by as another indication of her regret that he must go back to the  brakes. Yet somehow it made him observe her more closely. She wore a  plain, white dress made from material Mrs. Andrews had given her. Sleep  and good food had improved her. If she had been pretty out there in the  outlaw den now she was more than that. But she had the same paleness,  the same strained look, the same dark eyes full of haunting shadows.  After Duane's realization of the change in her he watched her more, with  a growing certainty that he would be sorry not to see her again.    \"It's likely we won't ever see each other again,\" he said. \"That's  strange to think of. We've been through some hard days, and I seem to  have known you a long time.\"    Jennie appeared shy, almost sad, so Duane changed the subject to  something less personal.    Andrews returned one evening from a several days' trip to Huntsville.    \"Duane, everybody's talkie' about how you cleaned up the Bland outfit,\"  he said, important and full of news. \"It's some exaggerated, accordin'  to what you told me; but you've shore made friends on this side of the  Nueces. I reckon there ain't a town where you wouldn't find people to  welcome you. Huntsville, you know, is some divided in its ideas. Half  the people are crooked. Likely enough, all them who was so loud in  praise of you are the crookedest. For instance, I met King Fisher, the  boss outlaw of these parts. Well, King thinks he's a decent citizen.  He was tellin' me what a grand job yours was for the border an' honest  cattlemen. Now that Bland and Alloway are done for, King Fisher will  find rustlin' easier. There's talk of Hardin movie' his camp over to  Bland's. But I don't know how true it is. I reckon there ain't much  to it. In the past when a big outlaw chief went under, his band almost  always broke up an' scattered. There's no one left who could run thet  outfit.\"    \"Did you hear of any outlaws hunting me?\" asked Duane.    \"Nobody from Bland's outfit is huntin' you, thet's shore,\" replied  Andrews. \"Fisher said there never was a hoss straddled to go on your  trail. Nobody had any use for Bland. Anyhow, his men would be afraid to  trail you. An' you could go right in to Huntsville, where you'd be some  popular. Reckon you'd be safe, too, except when some of them fool saloon  loafers or bad cowpunchers would try to shoot you for the glory in it.  Them kind of men will bob up everywhere you go, Duane.\"    \"I'll be able to ride and take care of myself in a day or two,\" went on  Duane. \"Then I'll go--I'd like to talk to you about Jennie.\"    \"She's welcome to a home here with us.\"    \"Thank you, Andrews. You're a kind man. But I want Jennie to get farther  away from the Rio Grande. She'd never be safe here. Besides, she may be  able to find relatives. She has some, though she doesn't know where they  are.\"    \"All right, Duane. Whatever you think best. I reckon now you'd better  take her to some town. Go north an' strike for Shelbyville or Crockett.  Them's both good towns. I'll tell Jennie the names of men who'll help  her. You needn't"]]]
