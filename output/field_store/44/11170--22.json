Like the preceding,  this corrido is known only in Tagalog, and is written in 12-syllable  assonanced lines.      Of these two printed versions, I give below a literal translation  of the first (A), not only because it is short (264 lines),  but also because it will be seen to be closely connected with the  folk-tales. For help in making this translation I am under obligation  to Mr. Salvador Unson, which I gratefully acknowledge. The second story  (B) I give only in partial summary. It is much too long to be printed  in full, and, besides, contains many incidents that have nothing to do  with our cycle. It will be noticed that \"Rodolfo\" (B) resembles rather  the European forms of the story; while A and the three folk-tales  are more Oriental, despite the conventional historical setting of A.        TALE A      \"Cay Calabasa: The Life of a Shepherdess born in a town, who became  the Wife of a King because of a Pumpkin.\"    1. Ye holy angels in the heavens, help my tongue to express and to  relate the story I will tell.    2. In early times, when Adoveneis, King of Borgona, was still alive,  he went out into the plains to hunt for deer, and accidentally became  separated from his companions.    3. In his wandering about, he saw a hut, which had a garden surrounding  it. A beautiful young maiden took care of the garden, in which were  growing melons and pumpkins.    4. The king spoke to the maiden, and asked, \"What plants are you  growing here?\" The girl replied, \"I am raising pumpkins and melons.\"    5. Now, the king happened to be thirsty, and asked her for but  a drink. \"We were hunting in the heat of the day, and I felt this  thirst come on me.\"    6. The maiden replied, \"O illustrious king! we have water in a mean  jar, but it is surely not fitting that your Majesty should drink from  a jar!    7. \"If we had a jar of pure gold, in which we could put water from a  blest fountain, then it would be proper for your Majesty. It is not  right or worthy that you should drink from a base jar.\"    8. The king replied to the girl, \"Never mind the jar, provided the  water is cool.\" The maiden went into the house, and presently the  king drank his fill.    9. After he had drunk, he handed her back the jar; but when the maiden  had received it (in her hands), she suddenly struck it against the  staircase. The jar was shattered to bits.    10. The king saw the act and wondered at it, and in his heart he  thought that the maiden had no manners. For the impudence of her  action, he decided to punish her.    11. (He said) \"You see in me, the traveller, a noble king, and (you  know) that I hold the crown. Why did you shatter that jar of yours,  received from my hands?\"    12. The maiden replied, \"The reason I broke the jar, long kept for  many years by my mother, O king! is that I should not like to have  it used by another.\"    13. After hearing that, the king made no reply, but returned (back)  towards the city, believing in his heart that the woman to whom he  had spoken was virtuous.    14. After some time the king one day ordered a soldier to carry  to the maiden a new narrow-necked jar, into which she was to put a  pumpkin entire.    15. He also ordered the soldier to tell the girl that she should not  break the jar, but that the jar and pumpkin should remain entire.    16. Inasmuch as the maiden was clever, her perception good, and her  understanding bold, she answered with another problem: she sent him  back a jar that already had a pumpkin in it.    17. She delivered it to the soldier, and the upshot of her reply was  this: \"The pumpkin and the jar are whole. The king must remove the  pumpkin without breaking the jar.\"    18. The soldier shouldered it and went back to the king, and told him  that her answer was that he should take the pumpkin out of the jar,  and leave both whole.    19. When the king saw the jar, he said nothing; but he thought in  his heart that he would send her another puzzle.    20. Again by the soldier he sent her a bottle, and requested that it  be filled with the milk of a bull. (He further added,) that, if the  order was not complied with, she should be punished.    21. The girl's answer to the king was this: \"Last night my father gave  birth to a child; and even though you order it, it is impossible for  me to get (you?) any bull's milk (to-day?).\"    22. Who would not wonder, when he comes to hear of it, at the language  back and forth between the king and the girl! For what man can give  birth to a child, and what bull can give milk?    23. At a great festival which the king gave, attended by knights and  counts, he sent a pipit [32] to the girl, and ordered her to cook  seven dishes of it.    24. The maiden (in reply) sent the king a needle, and asked him to  make a steel frying-pan, knife, and spit out of it, which she might  use in cooking the pipit.    25. The king again sent to her with this word: \"If you are really  very intelligent and if you are truly wise, you will catch the waves  and bind them.\"    26. The soldier returned at once to the maiden, and told her that  the orders of the king were that she should catch and bind the waves.    27. The maiden sent back word by the soldier that it is not proper  to disobey a king. \"Tell the king to make me a rope out of the loam  I am sending.\"    28. Again the soldier returned to the palace, and, taking the black  earth to the king, he said, \"Make her a rope out of this loam, with  which she will catch and bind the waves.\"    29. After the soldier had delivered his message, the king was almost  shaking with rage. \"Who under heaven can make a rope out of loam?\"    30. Now he ordered the soldier to fetch the maiden. \"And for her  impudence,\" he said, \"I will punish her.\"    31. He ordered the soldier to make haste and to return at once. The  maiden did not resist her punishment, and was placed in a well.    32. Now, this well into which she was cast lay in front of the window  of the king, so that whenever he should look out of the window he  might see her.    33. One morning, as he looked out and saw her there below him, she  asked him to give her fire.    34. The king said to her, \"I am a world-famed king, and it is not  my desire to descend just because of your request. Go ask fire from  the mountain.\"    35. The girl made no answer to his jesting reply. Some time later  the king held some games, and ordered that the maiden be taken out  of the well.    36. The king told her that she was pardoned for all her offences. \"But  as long as I have visitors (?),\" he said, \"you are to be my cook.\"    37. Then this order was given to the girl: \"You are to cook the  food. Everything must be well prepared. All the food must be palatable  and tasty.\"    38. The maiden, however, deliberately left all the food unsalted;  but she fastened to the bottom of the plate the necessary salt.    39. When at the table the king and his council were not satisfied  with the food, because there was no salt in it, the maiden was again  summoned.    40. \"I ordered you to cook because you were clever; but you took no  care of the cooking. Why am I thus insulted and my honor destroyed  before my guests?\"    41. The maiden at once returned answer to the council and to his  Majesty: \"Look underneath the plates; and if there is not the necessary  salt, my lord, condemn me as you see fit.\"    42. She had those near the king lift their plates, and she had him  look under. The salt was found not lacking, and the king ceased from  his contention and thought about the matter.    43. Then he said, \"If you had mixed in a little with the food, then  it would have been good and palatable. Explain to me the significance  of your act.\"    44. \"O great king!\" answered the maiden, \"I can easily reply to your  question. By leaving the salt out, I meant me, and no one else [i.e.,  she meant to suggest her own case when she was in the well].    45. \"You instructed me to get fire from the mountain. Why can you  not taste this salt, which is just under the plate?    46. \"Because I am an unfortunate person, an unworthy shepherdess from  the woods. If I were a city-bred person, even though most ordinary,  I should be honored in your presence.\"    47. To the reply of the girl the king shook his head, and pressed  his forehead (in thought). He had fallen in love, and his heart was  oppressed. He determined to marry her.    48. They were married at once, and at once she was clothed as a queen;  although she was only a lowly shepherdess, she was loved because of  the sweetness of her voice.    49. After living together a long time, they had a quarrel: the king  had conceived a dislike for her cleverness.    50. \"Return at once to your father and mother,\" he said. \"Go back to  the mountains and live there.    51. \"I will allow you to take with you whatever you want,--gold,  silver, dresses. Take with you also two maids.\"    52. The queen could not utter a word; silently she let her tears  fall. She thought that bad fortune had come upon her.    53. To be brief, the king got up from his chair and lay down in his  bed. He pretended to go to sleep in order that he might not see the  queen depart.    54. When the queen saw that the king was really sleeping, she covered  him up (in her sorrow), and summoned the servants.    55. She ordered them to lift him up and carry him to the mountains. \"In  carrying him, be careful not to wake him until the mountains are  reached.\"    56. They lifted the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/830"],[0,"The Argonautica (#17)"],[1,"back from the mountain on the self-same track.  And at night, by the skill of Argus, they reached broad-flowing Phasis,  and the utmost bourne of the sea.    (ll. 1262-1276) And straightway they let down the sails and the yard-arm  and stowed them inside the hollow mast-crutch, and at once they lowered  the mast itself till it lay along; and quickly with oars they entered  the mighty stream of the river; and round the prow the water surged as  it gave them way. And on their left hand they had lofty Caucasus and  the Cytaean city of Aea, and on the other side the plain of Ares and the  sacred grove of that god, where the serpent was keeping watch and ward  over the fleece as it hung on the leafy branches of an oak. And Aeson's  son himself from a golden goblet poured into the river libations of  honey and pure wine to Earth and to the gods of the country, and to the  souls of dead heroes; and he besought them of their grace to give kindly  aid, and to welcome their ship's hawsers with favourable omen. And  straightway Ancaeus spake these words:    (ll. 1277-1280) \"We have reached the Colchian land and the stream of  Phasis; and it is time for us to take counsel whether we shall make  trial of Aeetes with soft words, or an attempt of another kind shall be  fitting.\"    (ll. 1281-1285) Thus he spake, and by the advice of Argus Jason bade  them enter a shaded backwater and let the ship ride at anchor off shore;  and it was near at hand in their course and there they passed the night.  And soon the dawn appeared to their expectant eyes.          BOOK III    (ll. 1-5) Come now, Erato, stand by my side, and say next how Jason  brought back the fleece to Iolcus aided by the love of Medea. For thou  sharest the power of Cypris, and by thy love-cares dost charm unwedded  maidens; wherefore to thee too is attached a name that tells of love.    (ll. 6-10) Thus the heroes, unobserved, were waiting in ambush amid the  thick reed-beds; but Hera and Athena took note of them, and, apart  from Zeus and the other immortals, entered a chamber and took counsel  together; and Hera first made trial of Athena:    (ll. 11-16) \"Do thou now first, daughter of Zeus, give advice. What must  be done? Wilt thou devise some scheme whereby they may seize the golden  fleece of Aeetes and bear it to Hellas, or can they deceive the king  with soft words and so work persuasion? Of a truth he is terribly  overweening. Still it is right to shrink from no endeavour.\"    (ll. 17-21) Thus she spake, and at once Athena addressed her: \"I too  was pondering such thoughts in my heart, Hera, when thou didst ask me  outright. But not yet do I think that I have conceived a scheme to aid  the courage of the heroes, though I have balanced many plans.\"    (ll. 22-29) She ended, and the goddesses fixed their eyes on the ground  at their feet, brooding apart; and straightway Hera was the first to  speak her thought: \"Come, let us go to Cypris; let both of us accost her  and urge her to bid her son (if only he will obey) speed his shaft at  the daughter of Aeetes, the enchantress, and charm her with love for  Jason. And I deem that by her device he will bring back the fleece to  Hellas.\"    (ll. 30-31) Thus she spake, and the prudent plan pleased Athena, and she  addressed her in reply with gentle words:    (ll. 32-35) \"Hera, my father begat me to be a stranger to the darts of  love, nor do I know any charm to work desire. But if the word pleases  thee, surely I will follow; but thou must speak when we meet her.\"    (ll. 36-51) So she said, and starting forth they came to the mighty  palace of Cypris, which her husband, the halt-footed god, had built for  her when first he brought her from Zeus to be his wife. And entering the  court they stood beneath the gallery of the chamber where the goddess  prepared the couch of Hephaestus. But he had gone early to his forge and  anvils to a broad cavern in a floating island where with the blast  of flame he wrought all manner of curious work; and she all alone  was sitting within, on an inlaid seat facing the door. And her white  shoulders on each side were covered with the mantle of her hair and  she was parting it with a golden comb and about to braid up the long  tresses; but when she saw the goddesses before her, she stayed and  called them within, and rose from her seat and placed them on couches.  Then she herself sat down, and with her hands gathered up the locks  still uncombed. And smiling she addressed them with crafty words:    (ll. 52-54) \"Good friends, what intent, what occasion brings you here  after so long? Why have ye come, not too frequent visitors before, chief  among goddesses that ye are?\"    (ll. 55-75) And to her Hera replied: \"Thou dost mock us, but our hearts  are stirred with calamity. For already on the river Phasis the son of  Aeson moors his ship, he and his comrades in quest of the fleece. For  all their sakes we fear terribly (for the task is nigh at hand) but most  for Aeson's son. Him will I deliver, though he sail even to Hades to  free Ixion below from his brazen chains, as far as strength lies in  my limbs, so that Pelias may not mock at having escaped an evil  doom--Pelias who left me unhonoured with sacrifice. Moreover Jason was  greatly loved by me before, ever since at the mouth of Anaurus in flood,  as I was making trial of men's righteousness, he met me on his return  from the chase; and all the mountains and long ridged peaks were  sprinkled with snow, and from them the torrents rolling down were  rushing with a roar. And he took pity on me in the likeness of an old  crone, and raising me on his shoulders himself bore me through the  headlong tide. So he is honoured by me unceasingly; nor will Pelias pay  the penalty of his outrage, unless thou wilt grant Jason his return.\"    (ll. 76-82) Thus she spake, and speechlessness seized Cypris. And  beholding Hera supplicating her she felt awe, and then addressed her  with friendly words: \"Dread goddess, may no viler thing than Cypris ever  be found, if I disregard thy eager desire in word or deed, whatever my  weak arms can effect; and let there be no favour in return.\"    (ll. 83-89) She spake, and Hera again addressed her with prudence:  \"It is not in need of might or of strength that we have come. But just  quietly bid thy boy charm Aeetes' daughter with love for Jason. For if  she will aid him with her kindly counsel, easily do I think he will win  the fleece of gold and return to Iolcus, for she is full of wiles.\"    (ll. 90-99) Thus she spake, and Cypris addressed them both: \"Hera and  Athena, he will obey you rather than me. For unabashed though he is,  there will be some slight shame in his eyes before you; but he has no  respect for me, but ever slights me in contentious mood. And, overborne  by his naughtiness, I purpose to break his ill-sounding arrows and his  bow in his very sight. For in his anger he has threatened that if I  shall not keep my hands off him while he still masters his temper, I  shall have cause to blame myself thereafter.\"    (ll. 100-105) So she spake, and the goddesses smiled and looked at each  other. But Cypris again spoke, vexed at heart: \"To others my sorrows are  a jest; nor ought I to tell them to all; I know them too well myself.  But now, since this pleases you both, I will make the attempt and coax  him, and he will not say me nay.\"    (ll. 106-110) Thus she spake, and Hera took her slender hand and gently  smiling, replied: \"Perform this task, Cytherea, straightway, as  thou sayest; and be not angry or contend with thy boy; he will cease  hereafter to vex thee.\"    (ll. 111-128) She spake, and left her seat, and Athena accompanied her  and they went forth both hastening back. And Cypris went on her way  through the glens of Olympus to find her boy. And she found him apart,  in the blooming orchard of Zeus, not alone, but with him Ganymedes, whom  once Zeus had set to dwell among the immortal gods, being enamoured of  his beauty. And they were playing for golden dice, as boys in one house  are wont to do. And already greedy Eros was holding the palm of his left  hand quite full of them under his breast, standing upright; and on  the bloom of his cheeks a sweet blush was glowing. But the other sat  crouching hard by, silent and downcast, and he had two dice left which  he threw one after the other, and was angered by the loud laughter of  Eros. And lo, losing them straightway with the former, he went off empty  handed, helpless, and noticed not the approach of Cypris. And she stood  before her boy, and laying her hand on his lips, addressed him:    (ll. 129-144) \"Why dost thou smile in triumph, unutterable rogue? Hast  thou cheated him thus, and unjustly overcome the innocent child? Come,  be ready to perform for me the task I will tell thee of, and I will  give thee Zeus' all-beauteous plaything--the one which his dear nurse  Adrasteia made for him, while he still lived a child, with childish  ways, in the Idaean cave--a well-rounded ball; no better toy wilt thou  get from the hands of Hephaestus. All of gold are its zones, and round  each double seams run in a circle; but the stitches are hidden, and a  dark blue spiral overlays them all. But if thou shouldst cast it with  thy hands, lo, like a star, it sends a flaming track through the sky.  This I will give thee; and do thou strike with thy shaft and charm the  daughter of Aeetes with love for Jason; and let there be no loitering.  For then my thanks would be the slighter.\"    (ll. 145-150) Thus she spake, and welcome were her words to the  listening boy. And he threw down all his toys, and eagerly seizing her  robe on this side and on that, clung to the goddess. And he implored  her to bestow the gift at once; but she, facing him with kindly words,  touched his cheeks, kissed him and drew him to her, and replied with a  smile:    (ll. 151-153) \"Be witness now thy dear head and mine, that surely I will  give thee the gift and deceive"]]]
