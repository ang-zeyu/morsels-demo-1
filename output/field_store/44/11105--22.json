Then I lost sight of him for years and  years; then I published _anonymously_ a little poem--which he, to my  inexpressible delight, praised and expounded in a gallant article in a  magazine of which he was the editor; then I found him out again; he got  a publisher for 'Paracelsus' (I read it to him in manuscript) and is in  short 'my literary father'. Pretty nearly the same thing did he for  Miss Martineau, as she has said somewhere. God knows I forget what the  'talk', table-talk was about--I think she must have told you the results  of the whole day we spent tete-a-tete at Ascot, and that day's, the  dinner-day's morning at Elstree and St. Albans. She is to give me advice  about my worldly concerns, and not before I need it!    I cannot say or sing the pleasure your way of writing gives me--do go  on, and tell me all sorts of things, 'the story' for a beginning; but  your moralisings on 'your age' and the rest, are--now what _are_ they?  not to be reasoned on, disputed, laughed at, grieved about: they are  'Fanny's crotchets'. I thank thee, Jew (lia), for teaching me that word.    I don't know that I shall leave town for a month: my friend Monclar  looks piteous when I talk of such an event. I can't bear to leave him;  he is to take my portrait to-day (a famous one he _has_ taken!) and very  like he engages it shall be. I am going to town for the purpose. . . .    Now, then, do something for me, and see if I'll ask Miss M----to help  you! I am going to begin the finishing 'Sordello'--and to begin thinking  a Tragedy (an Historical one, so I shall want heaps of criticisms on  'Strafford') and I want to have _another_ tragedy in prospect, I write  best so provided: I had chosen a splendid subject for it, when I learned  that a magazine for next, this, month, will have a scene founded on my  story; vulgarizing or doing no good to it: and I accordingly throw it  up. I want a subject of the most wild and passionate love, to contrast  with the one I mean to have ready in a short time. I have many  half-conceptions, floating fancies: give me your notion of a thorough  self-devotement, self-forgetting; should it be a woman who loves thus,  or a man? What circumstances will best draw out, set forth this feeling?  . . .      The tragedies in question were to be 'King Victor and King Charles', and  'The Return of the Druses'.    This letter affords a curious insight into Mr. Browning's mode of work;  it is also very significant of the small place which love had hitherto  occupied in his life. It was evident, from his appeal to Miss Haworth's  'notion' on the subject, that he had as yet no experience, even  imaginary, of a genuine passion, whether in woman or man. The experience  was still distant from him in point of time. In circumstance he was  nearer to it than he knew; for it was in 1839 that he became acquainted  with Mr. Kenyon.    When dining one day at Serjeant Talfourd's, he was accosted by a  pleasant elderly man, who, having, we conclude, heard who he was, asked  leave to address to him a few questions: 'Was his father's name Robert?  had he gone to school at the Rev. Mr. Bell's at Cheshunt, and was he  still alive?' On receiving affirmative answers, he went on to say that  Mr. Browning and he had been great chums at school, and though they had  lost sight of each other in after-life, he had never forgotten his  old playmate, but even alluded to him in a little book which he had  published a few years before.*         * The volume is entitled 'Rhymed Plea for Tolerance' (1833),       and contains a reference to Mr. Kenyon's schooldays,       and to the classic fights which Mr. Browning had instituted.    The next morning the poet asked his father if he remembered a  schoolfellow named John Kenyon. He replied, 'Certainly! This is his  face,' and sketched a boy's head, in which his son at once recognized  that of the grown man. The acquaintance was renewed, and Mr. Kenyon  proved ever afterwards a warm friend. Mr. Browning wrote of him, in a  letter to Professor Knight of St. Andrews, Jan. 10, 1884: 'He was one  of the best of human beings, with a general sympathy for excellence  of every kind. He enjoyed the friendship of Wordsworth, of Southey, of  Landor, and, in later days, was intimate with most of my contemporaries  of eminence.' It was at Mr. Kenyon's house that the poet saw most of  Wordsworth, who always stayed there when he came to town.    In 1840 'Sordello' appeared. It was, relatively to its length, by far  the slowest in preparation of Mr. Browning's poems. This seemed, indeed,  a condition of its peculiar character. It had lain much deeper in the  author's mind than the various slighter works which were thrown off in  the course of its inception. We know from the preface to 'Strafford'  that it must have been begun soon after 'Paracelsus'. Its plan may have  belonged to a still earlier date; for it connects itself with 'Pauline'  as the history of a poetic soul; with both the earlier poems, as the  manifestation of the self-conscious spiritual ambitions which were  involved in that history. This first imaginative mood was also  outgrowing itself in the very act of self-expression; for the tragedies  written before the conclusion of 'Sordello' impress us as the product of  a different mental state--as the work of a more balanced imagination and  a more mature mind.    It would be interesting to learn how Mr. Browning's typical poet became  embodied in this mediaeval form: whether the half-mythical character  of the real Sordello presented him as a fitting subject for imaginative  psychological treatment, or whether the circumstances among which he  moved seemed the best adapted to the development of the intended type.  The inspiration may have come through the study of Dante, and his  testimony to the creative influence of Sordello on their mother-tongue.  That period of Italian history must also have assumed, if it did not  already possess, a great charm for Mr. Browning's fancy, since he  studied no less than thirty works upon it, which were to contribute  little more to his dramatic picture than what he calls 'decoration', or  'background'. But the one guide which he has given us to the reading of  the poem is his assertion that its historical circumstance is only to  be regarded as background; and the extent to which he identified himself  with the figure of Sordello has been proved by his continued belief that  its prominence was throughout maintained. He could still declare,  so late as 1863, in his preface to the reprint of the work, that his  'stress' in writing it had lain 'on the incidents in the development of  a soul, little else' being to his mind 'worth study'. I cannot therefore  help thinking that recent investigations of the life and character of  the actual poet, however in themselves praiseworthy and interesting,  have been often in some degree a mistake; because, directly or  indirectly, they referred Mr. Browning's Sordello to an historical  reality, which his author had grasped, as far as was then possible, but  to which he was never intended to conform.    Sordello's story does exhibit the development of a soul; or rather,  the sudden awakening of a self-regarding nature to the claims of other  men--the sudden, though slowly prepared, expansion of the narrower into  the larger self, the selfish into the sympathetic existence; and this  takes place in accordance with Mr. Browning's here expressed belief that  poetry is the appointed vehicle for all lasting truths; that the true  poet must be their exponent. The work is thus obviously, in point of  moral utterance, an advance on 'Pauline'. Its metaphysics are,  also, more distinctly formulated than those of either 'Pauline' or  'Paracelsus'; and the frequent use of the term Will in its metaphysical  sense so strongly points to German associations that it is difficult to  realize their absence, then and always, from Mr. Browning's mind. But  he was emphatic in his assurance that he knew neither the German  philosophers nor their reflection in Coleridge, who would have seemed a  likely medium between them and him. Miss Martineau once said to him  that he had no need to study German thought, since his mind was German  enough--by which she possibly meant too German--already.    The poem also impresses us by a Gothic richness of detail,* the  picturesque counterpart of its intricacy of thought, and, perhaps for  this very reason, never so fully displayed in any subsequent work. Mr.  Browning's genuinely modest attitude towards it could not preclude  the consciousness of the many imaginative beauties which its unpopular  character had served to conceal; and he was glad to find, some years  ago, that 'Sordello' was represented in a collection of descriptive  passages which a friend of his was proposing to make. 'There is a great  deal of that in it,' he said, 'and it has always been overlooked.'         * The term Gothic has been applied to Mr. Browning's work, I       believe, by Mr. James Thomson, in writing of 'The Ring and       the Book', and I do not like to use it without saying so.       But it is one of those which must have spontaneously       suggested themselves to many other of Mr. Browning's       readers.    It was unfortunate that new difficulties of style should have added  themselves on this occasion to those of subject and treatment; and the  reason of it is not generally known. Mr. John Sterling had made some  comments on the wording of 'Paracelsus'; and Miss Caroline Fox, then  quite a young woman, repeated them, with additions, to Miss Haworth,  who, in her turn, communicated them to Mr. Browning, but without making  quite clear to him the source from which they sprang.

I shall see  No throngs like this again; wring no more praise  Out of their hearts; forego that instant joy  --Let those who have not known it count it vain--  When human souls at once respond to yours.  Here, on the brink of fortune and of fame,  As men account these things, the moment comes  When I must choose between them and the stars;  And I have chosen.                     Handel, good old friend,  We part to-night. Hereafter, I must watch  That other wand, to which the worlds keep time.    What has decided me? That marvelous night  When--ah, how difficult it will be to guide,  With all these wonders whirling through my brain!--  After a Pump-room concert I came home  Hot-foot, out of the fluttering sea of fans,  Coquelicot-ribboned belles and periwigged beaux,  To my Newtonian telescope.                             The design  Was his; but more than half the joy my own,  Because it was the work of my own hand,  A new one, with an eye six inches wide,  Better than even the best that Newton made.  Then, as I turned it on the _Gemini_,  And the deep stillness of those constant lights,  Castor and Pollux, lucid pilot-stars,  Began to calm the fever of my blood,  I saw, O, first of all mankind I saw  The disk of my new planet gliding there  Beyond our tumults, in that realm of peace.    What will they christen it? Ach--not _Herschel_, no!  Nor _Georgium Sidus_, as I once proposed;  Although he scarce could lose it, as he lost  That world in 'seventy-six.                             Indeed, so far  From trying to tax it, he has granted me  How much?--two hundred golden pounds a year,  In the great name of science,--half the cost  Of one state-coach, with all those worlds to win!  Well--well--we must be grateful. This mad king  Has done far more than all the worldly-wise,  Who'll charge even this to madness.                                      I believe  One day he'll have me pardoned for that...crime,  When I escaped--deserted, some would say--  From those drill-sergeants in my native land;  Deserted drill for music, as I now  Desert my music for the orchestral spheres.  No. This new planet is only new to man.  His majesty has done much. Yet, as my friend  Declared last night, \"Never did monarch buy  Honour so cheaply\"; and--he has not bought it.  I think that it should bear some ancient name,  And wear it like a crown; some deep, dark name,  Like _Uranus_, known to remoter gods.    How strange it seems--this buzzing concert-room!  There's Doctor Burney bowing and, behind him,  His fox-eyed daughter Fanny.                               Is it a dream,  These crowding midgets, dense as clustering bees  In some great bee-skep?                          Now, as I lift my wand,  A silence grips them, and the strings begin,  Throbbing. The faint lights flicker in gusts of sound.  Before me, glimmering like a crescent moon,  The dim half circle of the choir awaits  Its own appointed time.                          Beside me now,  Watching my wand, plump and immaculate  From buckled shoes to that white bunch of lace  Under his chin, the midget tenor rises,  Music in hand, a linnet and a king.  The bullfinch bass, that other emperor,  Leans back indifferently, and clears his throat  As if to say, \"This prelude leads to _Me_!\"  While, on their own proud thrones, on either hand,  The sumptuously bosomed midget queens,  Contralto and soprano, jealously eye  Each other's plumage.                        Round me the music throbs  With an immortal passion. I grow aware  Of an appalling mystery.... We, this throng  Of midgets, playing, listening, tense and still,  Are sailing on a midget ball of dust  We call our planet; will have sailed through space  Ten thousand leagues before this music ends.  What does it mean? Oh, God, what _can_ it mean?--  This weird hushed ant-hill with a thousand eyes;  These midget periwigs; all those little blurs,  Tier over tier, of faces, masks of flesh,  Corruptible, hiding each its hopes and dreams,  Its tragi-comic dreams.                          And all this throng  Will be forgotten, mixed with dust, crushed out,  Before this book of music is outworn  Or that tall organ crumbles. Violins  Outlast their players. Other hands may touch  That harpsichord; but ere this planet makes  Another threescore journeys round its sun,  These breathing listeners will have vanished. Whither?  I watch my moving hands, and they grow strange!  What is it moves this body? What am I?  How came I here, a ghost, to hear that voice  Of infinite compassion, far away,  Above the throbbing strings, hark! _Comfort ye_...    If music lead us to a cry like this,  I think I shall not lose it in the skies.  I do but follow its own secret law  As long ago I sought to understand  Its golden mathematics; taught myself  The way to lay one stone upon another,  Before I dared to dream that I might build  My Holy City of Song. I gave myself  To all its branches. How they stared at me,  Those men of \"sensibility,\" when I said  That algebra, conic sections, fluxions, all  Pertained to music. Let them stare again.  Old Kepler knew, by instinct, what I now  Desire to learn. I have resolved to leave  No tract of heaven unvisited.                                To-night  --The music carries me back to it again!--  I see beyond this island universe,  Beyond our sun, and all those other suns  That throng the Milky Way, far, far beyond,  A thousand little wisps, faint nebulae,  Luminous fans and milky streaks of fire;  Some like soft brushes of electric mist  Streaming from one bright point; others that spread  And branch, like growing systems; others discrete,  Keen, ripe, with stars in clusters; others drawn back  By central forces into one dense death,  Thence to be kindled into fire, reborn,  And scattered abroad once more in a delicate spray  Faint as the mist by one bright dewdrop breathed  At dawn, and yet a universe like our own;  Each wisp a universe, a vast galaxy  Wide as our night of stars.                              The Milky Way  In which our sun is drowned, to these would seem  Less than to us their faintest drift of haze;  Yet we, who are borne on one dark grain of dust  Around one indistinguishable spark  Of star-mist, lost in one lost feather of light,  Can by the strength of our own thought, ascend  Through universe after universe; trace their growth  Through boundless time, their glory, their decay;  And, on the invisible road of law, more firm  Than granite, range through all their length and breadth,  Their height and depth, past, present and to come.  So, those who follow the great Work-master's law  From small things up to great, may one day learn  The structure of the heavens, discern the whole  Within the part, as men through Love see God.  Oh, holy night, deep night of stars, whose peace  Descends upon the troubled mind like dew,  Healing it with the sense of that pure reign  Of constant law, enduring through all change;  Shall I not, one day, after faithful years,  Find that thy heavens are built on music, too,  And hear, once more, above thy throbbing worlds  This voice of all compassion, _Comfort ye,--_  Yes--_comfort ye, my people, saith your God?_          VII    SIR JOHN HERSCHEL REMEMBERS      True type of all, from his own father's hand  He caught the fire; and, though he carried it far  Into new regions; and, from southern fields  Of yellow lupin, added host on host  To those bright armies which his father knew,  Surely the crowning hour of all his life  Was when, his task accomplished, he returned  A lonely pilgrim to the twilit shrine  Of first beginnings and his father's youth.  There, in the Octagon Chapel, with bared head  Grey, honoured for his father and himself,  He touched the glimmering keyboard, touched the books  Those dear lost hands had touched so long ago.    \"Strange that these poor inanimate things outlast  The life that used them.                           Yes. I should like to try  This good old friend of his. You'll leave me here  An hour or so?\"                  His hands explored the stops;  And, while the music breathed what else were mute,  His mind through many thoughts and memories ranged.  Picture on picture passed before him there  In living colours, painted on the gloom:  Not what the world acclaimed, the great work crowned,  But all that went before, the years of toil;  The years of infinite patience, hope, despair.  He saw the little house where all began,  His father's first resolve to explore the sky,  His first defeat, when telescopes were found  Too costly for a music-master's purse;  And then that dogged and all-conquering will  Declaring, \"Be it so. I'll make my own,  A better than even the best that Newton made.\"  He saw his first rude telescope--a tube  Of pasteboard, with a lens at either end;  And then,--that arduous growth to size and power  With each new instrument, as his knowledge grew;  And, to reward each growth, a deeper heaven.  He saw the good Aunt Caroline's dismay  When her trim drawing-room, as by wizardry, turned  Into a workshop, where her brother's hands  Cut, ground and burnished, hour on aching hour,  Month after month, new mirrors of the sky.    Yet, while from dawn to dark her brother moved  Around some new-cut mirror, burnishing it,  Knowing that if he once removed his hands  The surface would be dimmed and must forego  Its heaven for ever, her quiet hands would raise  Food to his lips; or, with that musical voice  Which once--for she, too, offered her sacrifice--  Had promised her fame, she whiled away the hours  Reading how, long ago, Aladdin raised  The djinns, by burnishing that old battered lamp;  Or, from Cervantes, how one crazy soul  Tilting at windmills, challenged a purblind world.    He saw her seized at last by that same fire,  Burning to help, a sleepless Vestal, dowered  With lightning-quickness, rushing from desk to clock,  Or measuring distances at dead of night "]]]
