I will not sleep  to-night.\"    It was well that he thus resolved, for in the middle of the night the  man rose up, and taking a sword in his hand, rushed to the prince with  the intention of killing him. But he rose up and spoke.    \"Do not slay me,\" he said. \"What profit would you get from my death?  If you killed me you would be sorry afterwards, like that man who  killed his dog.\"    \"What man? What dog?\" he asked.    \"I will tell you,\" said the prince, \"if you will give me that sword.\"    So he gave him the sword, and the prince began his story:    \"Once upon a time there lived a wealthy merchant who had a pet dog. He  was suddenly reduced to poverty, and had to part with his dog. He got  a loan of five thousand rupees from a brother merchant, leaving the  dog as a pledge, and with the money began business again. Not long  after this the other merchant's shop was broken into by thieves and  completely sacked. There was hardly ten rupees' worth left in the  place. The faithful dog, however, knew what was going on, and went and  followed the thieves, and saw where they deposited the things, and  then returned.    \"In the morning there was great weeping and lamentation in the  merchant's house when it was known what had happened. The merchant  himself nearly went mad. Meanwhile the dog kept on running to the  door, and pulling at his master's shirt and paijamas, as though  wishing him to go outside. At last a friend suggested that, perhaps,  the dog knew something of the whereabouts of the things, and advised  the merchant to follow its leadings. The merchant consented, and went  after the dog right up to the very place where the thieves had hidden  the goods. Here the animal scraped and barked, and showed in various  ways that the things were underneath. So the merchant and his friends  dug about the place, and soon came upon all the stolen property.  Nothing was missing. There was everything just as the thieves had  taken them.    \"The merchant was very glad. On returning to his house, he at once  sent the dog back to its old master with a letter rolled under the  collar, wherein he had written about the sagacity of the beast, and  begged his friend to forget the loan and to accept another five  thousand rupees as a present. When this merchant saw his dog coming  back again, he thought, 'Alas! my friend is wanting the money. How can  I pay him? I have not had sufficient time to recover myself from my  recent losses. I will slay the dog ere he reaches the threshold, and  say that another must have slain it. Thus there will be an end of my  debt. No dog, no loan.' Accordingly he ran out and killed the poor  dog, when the letter fell out of its collar. The merchant picked it up  and read it. How great was his grief and disappointment when he knew  the facts of the case!    \"Beware,\" continued the prince, \"lest you do that which afterwards you  would give your life not to have done.\"    By the time the prince had concluded this story it was nearly morning,  and he went away, after rewarding the man.    The prince then visited the country belonging to his brother-in-law.  He disguised himself as a jogi, and sitting down by a tree near the  palace, pretended to be absorbed in worship. News of the man and of  his wonderful piety reached the ears of the king. He felt interested  in him, as his wife was very ill; and he had sought for hakims to cure  her, but in vain. He thought that, perhaps, this holy man could do  something for her. So he sent to him. But the jogi refused to tread  the halls of a king, saying that his dwelling was the open air, and  that if his Majesty wished to see him he must come himself and bring  his wife to the place. Then the king took his wife and brought her to  the jogi. The holy man bade her prostrate herself before him, and when  she had remained in this position for about three hours, he told her  to rise and go, for she was cured.    In the evening there was great consternation in the palace, because  the queen had lost her pearl rosary, and nobody knew anything about  it. At length some one went to the jogi, and found it on the ground by  the place where the queen had prostrated herself. When the king heard  this he was very angry, and ordered the jogi to be executed. This  stern order, however, was not carried out, as the prince bribed the  men and escaped from the country. But he knew that the second bit of  advice was true.    Clad in his own clothes, the prince was walking along one day when he  saw a potter crying and laughing alternately with his wife and  children. \"O fool,\" said he, \"what is the matter? If you laugh, why do  you weep? If you weep, why do you laugh?\"    \"Do not bother me,\" said the potter. \"What does it matter to you?\"    \"Pardon me,\" said the prince, \"but I should like to know the reason.\"    \"The reason is this, then,\" said the potter. \"The king of this country  has a daughter whom he is obliged to marry every day, because all her  husbands die the first night of their stay with her. Nearly all the  young men of the place have thus perished, and our son will be called  on soon. We laugh at the absurdity of the thing--a potter's son  marrying a princess, and we cry at the terrible consequence of the  marriage. What can we do?\"    \"Truly a matter for laughing and weeping. But weep no more,\" said the  prince. \"I will exchange places with your son, and will be married to  the princess instead of him. Only give me suitable garments, and  prepare me for the occasion.\"    So the potter gave him beautiful raiment and ornaments, and the prince  went to the palace. At night he was conducted to the apartment of the  princess. \"Dread hour!\" thought he; \"am I to die like the scores of  young men before me?\" He clenched his sword with firm grip, and lay  down on his bed, intending to keep awake all the night and see what  would happen. In the middle of the night he saw two Shahmars come out  from the nostrils of the princess. They stole over towards him,  intending to kill him, like the others who had been before him: but he  was ready for them. He laid hold of his sword, and when the snakes  reached his bed he struck at them and killed them. In the morning the  king came as usual to inquire, and was surprised to hear his daughter  and the prince talking gaily together. \"Surely,\" said he, \"this man  must be her husband, as he only can live with her.\"    \"Where do you come from? Who are you?\" asked the king, entering the  room.    \"O king!\" replied the prince, \"I am the son of a king who rules over  such-and-such a country.\"    When he heard this the king was very glad, and bade the prince to  abide in his palace, and appointed him his successor to the throne.  The prince remained at the palace for more than a year, and then asked  permission to visit his own country, which was granted. The king gave  him elephants, horses, jewels, and abundance of money for the expenses  of the way and as presents for his father, and the prince started.    On the way he had to pass through the country belonging to his  brother-in-law, whom we have already mentioned. Report of his arrival  reached the ears of the king, who came with rope-tied hands and  haltered neck to do him homage. He most humbly begged him to stay at  his palace, and to accept what little hospitality could be provided.  While the prince was staying at the palace he saw his sister, who  greeted him with smiles and kisses. On leaving he told her how she and  her husband had treated him at his first visit, and how he had  escaped; and then gave them two elephants, two beautiful horses,  fifteen soldiers, and ten lacs rupees' worth of jewels.    Afterwards he went to his own home, and informed his mother and father  of his arrival. Alas! his parents had both become blind from weeping  about the loss of their son. \"Let him come in,\" said the king, \"and  put his hands upon our eyes, and we shall see again.\" So the prince  entered, and was most affectionately greeted by his old parents; and  he laid his hands on their eyes, and they saw again.    Then the prince told his father all that had happened to him, and how  he had been saved several times by attending to the advice that he had  purchased from the Brahmani. Whereupon the king expressed his sorrow  for having sent him away, and all was joy and peace again.          The Gold-giving Serpent      Now in a certain place there lived a Brahman named Haridatta. He was a  farmer, but poor was the return his labour brought him. One day, at  the end of the hot hours, the Brahman, overcome by the heat, lay down  under the shadow of a tree to have a doze. Suddenly he saw a great  hooded snake creeping out of an ant-hill near at hand. So he thought  to himself, \"Sure this is the guardian deity of the field, and I have  not ever worshipped it. That's why my farming is in vain. I will at  once go and pay my respects to it.\"    When he had made up his mind, he got some milk, poured it into a bowl,  and went to the ant-hill, and said aloud: \"O Guardian of this Field!  all this while I did not know that you dwelt here. That is why I have  not yet paid my respects to you; pray forgive me.\" And he laid the  milk down and went to his house. Next morning he came and looked, and  he saw a gold denar in the bowl, and from that time onward every day  the same thing occurred: he gave milk to the serpent and found a gold  denar.    One day the Brahman had to go to the village, and so he ordered his  son to take the milk to the ant-hill. The son brought the milk, put  it down, and went back home. Next day he went again and found a  denar, so he thought to himself: \"This ant-hill is surely full  of golden denars; I'll kill the serpent, and take them all for  myself.\" So next day, while he was giving the milk to the serpent, the  Brahman's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/713"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 2 (#17)"],[1,"called upon to pay their quota, but sent  a deputation to the King, begging him to be contented with the aid of  their prayers, as they were too poor to contribute in any other shape.  Philip Augustus knew better, and by way of giving them a lesson,  employed three nobles of the vicinity to lay waste the church lands.  The clergy, informed of the outrage, applied to the King for redress.  \"I will aid you with my prayers,\" said the Monarch condescendingly,  \"and will intreat those gentlemen to let the church alone.\" He did as  he had promised, but in such a manner, that the nobles, who appreciated  the joke, continued their devastations as before. Again the clergy  applied to the King. \"What would you have of me?\" he replied, in answer  to their remonstrances: \"You gave me your prayers in my necessity, and  I have given you mine in yours.\" The clergy understood the argument,  and thought it the wiser course to pay their quota of Saladin's tithe  without further parley.    This anecdote shows the unpopularity of the Crusade. If the clergy  disliked to contribute, it is no wonder that the people felt still  greater antipathy. But the chivalry of Europe was eager for the affray:  the tithe was rigorously collected, and armies from England, France,  Burgundy, Italy, Flanders, and Germany, were soon in the field; The two  kings who were to have led it, were, however, drawn into broils by an  aggression of Richard; Duke of Guienne, better known as Richard Coeur  de Lion, upon the territory of the Count of Toulouse, and the proposed  journey to Palestine was delayed. War continued to rage between France  and England, and with so little probability of a speedy termination,  that many of the nobles, bound to the Crusade, left the two Monarchs to  settle their differences at their leisure, and proceeded to Palestine  without them.    Death at last stepped in and removed Henry II. from the hostility of  his foes, and the treachery and ingratitude of his children. His son  Richard immediately concluded an alliance with Philip Augustus, and the  two young, valiant, and impetuous Monarchs, united all their energies  to forward the Crusade. They met with a numerous and brilliant retinue  at Nonancourt in Normandy, where, in sight of their assembled chivalry,  they embraced as brothers, and swore to live as friends and true  allies, until a period of forty days after their return from the Holy  Land. With a view of purging their camp from the follies and vices  which had proved so ruinous to preceding expeditions, they drew up a  code of laws for the government of the army. Gambling had been carried  to a great extent, and had proved the fruitful source of quarrels and  bloodshed, and one of their laws prohibited any person in the army,  beneath the degree of a knight, from playing at any game for money.  [Strutt's \"Sports and Pastimes.\"] Knights and clergymen might play for  money, but no one was permitted to lose or gain more than twenty  shillings in a day, under a penalty of one hundred shillings. The  personal attendants of the Monarchs were also allowed to play to the  same extent. The penalty in their case for infraction was that they  should be whipped naked through the army for the space of three days.  Any crusader, who struck another and drew blood, was ordered to have  his hand cut off; and whoever slew a brother crusader was condemned to  be tied alive to the corpse of his victim and buried with him. No young  women were allowed to follow the army, to the great sorrow of many  vicious and of many virtuous dames, who had not courage to elude the  decree by dressing in male attire.  But many high-minded and  affectionate maidens and matrons, bearing the sword or the spear,  followed their husbands and lovers to the war in spite of King Richard,  and in defiance of danger. The only women allowed to accompany the army  in their own habiliments, were washerwomen, of fifty years complete,  and any others of the fair sex who had reached the same age.    These rules having been promulgated, the two monarchs marched together  to Lyons, where they separated, agreeing to meet again at Messina.  Philip proceeded across the Alps to Genoa, where he took ship, and was  conveyed in safety to the place of rendezvous. Richard turned in the  direction of Marseilles, where he also took ship for Messina. His  impetuous disposition hurried him into many squabbles by the way, and  his knights and followers, for the most part as brave and as foolish as  himself, imitated him very zealously in this particular.  At Messina  the Sicilians charged the most exorbitant prices for every necessary of  life. Richard's army in vain remonstrated. From words they came to  blows, and, as a last resource, plundered the Sicilians, since they  could not trade with them. Continual battles were the consequence, in  one of which Lebrun, the favourite attendant of Richard, lost his life.  The peasantry from far and near came flocking to the aid of the  townspeople, and the battle soon became general.  Richard, irritated at  the loss of his favourite, and incited by a report that Tancred, the  King of Sicily, was fighting at the head of his own people, joined the  melee with his boldest knights, and, beating back the Sicilians,  attacked the city, sword in hand, stormed the battlements, tore down  the flag of Sicily, and planted his own in its stead. This collision  gave great offence to the King of France, who became from that time  jealous of Richard, and apprehensive that his design was not so much to  re-establish the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem, as to make conquests  for himself. He, however, exerted his influence to restore peace  between the English and Sicilians, and shortly afterwards set sail for  Acre, with distrust of his ally germinating in his heart.    Richard remained behind for some weeks, in a state of inactivity quite  unaccountable in one of his temperament. He appears to have had no more  squabbles with the Sicilians, but to have lived an easy luxurious life,  forgetting, in the lap of pleasure, the objects for which he had  quitted his own dominions and the dangerous laxity he was introducing  into his army. The superstition of his soldiers recalled him at length  to a sense of his duty: a comet was seen for several successive nights,  which was thought to menace them with the vengeance of Heaven for their  delay. Shooting stars gave them similar warning; and a fanatic, of the  name of Joachim, with his drawn sword in his hand, and his long hair  streaming wildly over his shoulders, went through the camp, howling all  night long, and predicting plague, famine, and every other calamity, if  they did not set out immediately.  Richard did not deem it prudent to  neglect the intimations; and, after doing humble penance for his  remissness, he set sail for Acre.    A violent storm dispersed his fleet, but he arrived safely at Rhodes  with the principal part of the armament. Here he learned that three of  his ships had been stranded on the rocky coasts of Cyprus, and that the  ruler of the island, Isaac Comnenus, had permitted his people to  pillage the unfortunate crews, and had refused shelter to his betrothed  bride, the Princess Berengaria, and his sister, who, in one of the  vessels, had been driven by stress of weather into the port of Limisso.  The fiery monarch swore to be revenged, and, collecting all his  vessels, sailed back to Limisso. Isaac Comnenus refused to apologize or  explain, and Richard, in no mood to be trifled with, landed on the  island, routed with great loss the forces sent to oppose him, and laid  the whole country under contribution.    On his arrival at Acre, he found the whole of the chivalry of Europe  there before him. Guy of Lusignan, the King of Jerusalem, had long  before collected the bold Knights of the Temple, the Hospital, and St.  John, and had laid siege to Acre, which was resolutely defended by the  Sultan Saladin, with an army magnificent both for its numbers and its  discipline. For nearly two years the crusaders had pushed the siege,  and made efforts almost superhuman to dislodge the enemy. Various  battles had taken place in the open fields with no decisive advantage  to either party, and Guy of Lusignan had begun to despair of taking  that strong position without aid from Europe. His joy was extreme on  the arrival of Philip with all his chivalry, and he only awaited the  coming of Coeur de Lion to make one last decisive attack upon the town.  When the fleet of England was first seen approaching the shores of  Syria, a universal shout arose from the Christian camp; and when  Richard landed with his train, one louder still pierced to the very  mountains of the south, where Saladin lay with all his army.    It may be remarked as characteristic of this Crusade, that the  Christians and the Moslems no longer looked upon each other as  barbarians, to whom mercy was a crime. Each host entertained the  highest admiration for the bravery and magnanimity of the other, and in  their occasional truces met upon the most friendly terms. The Moslem  warriors were full of courtesy to the Christian knights, and had no  other regret than to think that such fine fellows were not Mahomedans.  The Christians, with a feeling precisely similar, extolled to the skies  the nobleness of the Saracens, and sighed to think that such generosity  and valour should be sullied by disbelief in the Gospel of Jesus. But  when the strife began, all these feelings disappeared, and the struggle  became mortal.    The jealousy excited in the mind of Philip by the events of Messina  still rankled, and the two monarchs refused to act in concert.  Instead  of making a joint attack upon the town, the French monarch assailed it  alone, and was repulsed. Richard did the same, and with the same  result. Philip tried to seduce the soldiers of Richard from their  allegiance by the offer of three gold pieces per month to every knight  "]]]
