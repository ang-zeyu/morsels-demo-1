GELATINE DESSERTS are those in which gelatine forms the basis.  GELATINE is an odorless, tasteless substance extracted from the bones  and various tissues of animals. It is used in a variety of forms, such  as glue and isinglass, but is also purified and prepared commercially  for use in desserts. When it is to be used as a thickening agent in  dessert making, it is ground and sold in this form, or it is mixed with  sugar, flavoring, and acid, when all that is necessary to make it an  appetizing dessert is that it be dissolved in hot water. In both of  these forms, it is sold under different trade names. The gelatine itself  does not provide any appreciable food value, but it is a means of  conveying various foods, such as eggs, milk, sugar, and many kinds of  fruit and fruit juices, all of which are more or less valuable for their  constituents. In addition, it produces desserts that are appetizing and  that may be garnished and served in many attractive ways.    43. To be most satisfactory, gelatine desserts should usually be made  just heavy enough with gelatine to retain the desired shape. The heavier  they become, the more rubbery they are in consistency and the less  dainty and agreeable. Their consistency can be regulated by the  proportion of liquid to gelatine that is used.    The general method of preparation followed when plain gelatine is used  in desserts consists in first soaking the gelatine in sufficient cold  water to moisten it, then dissolving it in hot liquid as near the  boiling point as possible, and finally cooling it in order to allow it  to solidify. As cold is absolutely essential for the mixture to  solidify, it is often difficult to prepare a gelatine dessert in the  summer time. Therefore, when a dessert of this kind is desired in the  warm weather, it should always be begun long enough before it is to be  served to allow it to become thoroughly solid. As it is usually  difficult to tell how much time this requires on a warm day, even with a  refrigerator or other cold place, it is much safer to overestimate the  time required than to underestimate it.    44. Boiling does not, as was formerly thought, destroy the power of  coagulation in gelatine for at least some time. Therefore, when  necessary, it may be boiled for 10 or 15 minutes without causing any  change. One fruit that will prevent gelatine from solidifying, however,  is raw pineapple. This is an important point to remember in connection  with gelatine desserts. If it is desired to use fresh pineapple with  gelatine, it will first be necessary to bring the pineapple to the  boiling point in order to destroy the property that prevents the  gelatine from solidifying.    45. The proportion of liquid to gelatine is another factor to be  reckoned with in the successful making of gelatine desserts. This  differs in the various kinds of gelatine, but the proper proportion is  usually stated on the package in which the gelatine comes or on a folder  inside the package. The amount mentioned is usually what is considered  to be ideal for the preparation of gelatine dishes and may generally be  relied on. In hot weather, however, it is advisable to use just a little  less liquid than the directions require.    In using the different brands of unsweetened and unflavored gelatines,  the proportion of liquid to gelatine is usually similar. 1/2 ounce of  this granulated gelatine, which is 1/2 of the amount usually put up in a  package, will solidify 1 quart of liquid. If this proportion is kept in  mind, little difficulty will be experienced in using this form of  gelatine. For convenience in measuring small amounts of the granulated  gelatine, it will be well to remember that 1 ounce of this material  equals 4-1/2 tablespoonfuls. Thus, if a recipe calls for 1/2 ounce of  gelatine, it is simply necessary to measure 2-1/4 tablespoonfuls to get  the required amount to solidify 1 quart of liquid.      RECIPES FOR GELATINE DESSERTS    46. PLAIN GELATINE.--A very good dessert can be made of fruit juice  solidified by means of gelatine. Any canned fruit juice or any mixture  of juices that will blend well and produce a jelly of agreeable flavor  may be used for this purpose. These are usually brought to the boiling  point before being added, but in case juices that may be injured by  heating are used, they may be added cold and the gelatine dissolved in  boiling water. When this is done, a little additional lemon will be  necessary in order to increase the flavor.    Plain jelly made according to the accompanying recipe may be served in  various attractive ways. One method of serving it is shown in Fig. 4. To  prepare it in this manner, pour the gelatine mixture into stemmed  glasses and allow it to solidify. When partly solid, decorate the top  with wedge-shaped pieces of pineapple and place a cherry in the center,  as illustrated. When entirely solid, place the glass on a small plate  and serve. The fruit may be omitted if desired and whipped cream served  on the gelatine.    [Illustration: FIG. 4, A dish of plain gelatine.]    Plain jelly is also attractive when poured into a large mold, allowed to  solidify, and then turned out on a plate. If the mold is moistened with  cold water before the gelatine is poured into it, no difficulty will be  experienced in removing the jelly when it becomes solid. The center of  the mold may be filled with whipped cream before it is put on the table  or the jelly may be served plain and the whipped cream then added to  each serving from another dish.    PLAIN GELATINE  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1/2 oz. or 2-1/4 Tb. unflavored gelatine  1/2 c. cold water  3 c. fruit juice  Juice of 1 lemon  Sugar    Soak the gelatine in the cold water until it is well moistened. Strain  the fruit juices, heat to boiling point, and pour over the gelatine.  Add the lemon juice and a sufficient amount of sugar to sweeten. Allow  to solidify and serve in any desired manner.    47. ORANGE JELLY.--An excellent dessert is the result when orange juice  is used for flavoring and gelatine for thickening. This jelly may be  poured into molds that have been moistened with cold water, or, as shown  in Fig. 5, it may be poured into orange skins made to resemble baskets  and then garnished with whipped cream.    ORANGE JELLY  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1/2 oz. or 2-1/4 Tb. unflavored gelatine  1/2 c. cold water  1 c. boiling water  1 c. sugar  1/2 c. lemon juice  1-1/2 c. orange juice    Soak the gelatine in the cold water until it is well moistened, and  dissolve with the boiling water. Add the sugar and the lemon and orange  juice strained. Pour into a large mold or individual molds and set aside  to solidify. Serve in any desired way.    [Illustration: FIG. 5, Orange jelly in orange-skin basket.]    48. COFFEE JELLY.--If fruit juices are difficult to obtain, coffee  jelly, which will be found to be very pleasing, may be used  occasionally. However, it is necessary that whipped cream be served with  coffee jelly in order to make it a really delightful dessert.    COFFEE JELLY  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 c. clear, strong coffee  1/2 oz. or 2-1/4 Tb. unflavored gelatine  1/2 c. cold water  1 c. boiling water  Three-quarters c. sugar    Prepare the coffee freshly and make it stronger than that which would  ordinarily be used for the table. Be sure that it contains no grounds.  Soak the gelatine in the cold water, and dissolve in the boiling water.  Add the sugar and coffee. Pour into moistened molds and allow to cool.  Serve with sweetened whipped cream.    49. FRUIT GELATINE.--Almost any combination of fruit juices, as well as  any single fruit juice, may be used with gelatine in the making of fruit  gelatine. The accompanying recipe contains fruits that may be used, but  other fruits than those given may perhaps be found to be even more  agreeable.    FRUIT GELATINE  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1/44 oz. or 1-1/8 Tb. unflavored gelatine  1/4 c. cold water  1/2 c. boiling water  1/2 c. sugar  1/2 c. pineapple juice  1/4 c. orange juice  1/4 c. lemon juice  2 slices pineapple  2 oranges  1 banana  6 English walnuts    Moisten the gelatine in the cold water and dissolve in the boiling  water. Add the sugar and the orange, pineapple, and lemon juice, and  allow this to cool. Dice the pineapple. Prepare the oranges by peeling  them, removing the pulp from the sections, and cutting it into small  pieces. Slice or dice the banana and break each nut into six or eight  pieces. Mix the fruits and nuts, place in a mold that has been moistened  with cold water, and pour the cold jelly over them. Allow this to  solidify, turn from the mold, and serve with whipped cream.    50. LEMON SNOW.--If a light, spongy dessert to serve with a heavy dinner  is desired, lemon snow should be tried. It may be made with other  sour-fruit juice and is particularly agreeable if the color of the fruit  juice used is a pretty one. Fruit coloring may be used in the  preparation of dishes of this sort if desired.    LEMON SNOW  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1/2 oz. or 2-1/4 Tb. unflavored gelatine  1/2 c. cold water  1-1/2 c. boiling water  1 c. sugar  1/2 c. lemon juice  Whites of two eggs    Soak the gelatine in the cold water, dissolve it in the boiling water,  and add the sugar. When cold, add the strained lemon juice. When the  gelatine mixture is just beginning to solidify, add the egg whites,  beating with a rotary beater until the mixture begins to hold its shape.  If desired, a fruit of some kind may be placed in a mold that has been  moistened with cold water and the mixture poured over it, or the plain  mixture may be poured into the mold without the fruit. Whipped cream or  custard sauce improves this dessert to a large extent.    51. SPANISH CREAM.--A gelatine dish containing eggs is usually a  delightful dessert, and Spanish cream is no exception to this rule. If  it is properly made, a part of the mold will have the consistency of a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9939"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 5: Fruit and Fruit Desserts; (#17)"],[1,"R.--For canning by steam pressure, a  number of different kinds of pressure cookers are to be had, but in  principle they are all alike and they are always made of heavy material,  so as to withstand the severe steam pressure generated in them. In Fig.  20 is shown one type of pressure cooker. It is provided with a bail, or  handle, for carrying it and with clamps that hold the cover firmly in  place. Attached to the cover is a steam gauge, which indicates the steam  pressure inside the cooker, and a pet-cock, which is used to regulate  the pressure. On some cookers, a thermometer is also attached to the  cover. Also, inside of some, resting on the bottom, is an elevated rack  for supporting the jars of food that are to be sterilized and cooked. In  operating a pressure cooker, water for generating steam is poured in  until it reaches the top of this rack, but it should not be allowed to  cover any part of the jars of food. Steam is generated by applying heat  to the bottom of the cooker, and the longer the heat is applied the  higher the steam pressure will go.    It is possible to secure a steam pressure of 5 to 25 pounds per square  inch in a cooker of this kind. This means that the temperature reached  will vary from a few degrees above boiling to about 275 degrees  Fahrenheit. At a pressure of 20 pounds, the temperature will be about  260 degrees. The heavier the material used for a cooker and the more  solid the construction, the higher may go the steam pressure, and, of  course, the temperature. Some cookers of light construction will not  permit of a pressure greater than 5 pounds, but even such cookers are  very satisfactory. It is the high temperature that may be developed in a  pressure cooker that greatly shortens the time required for cooking jars  of food and making them sterile.      CANNING WITH TIN CANS    46. For canning food in some tin cans, it is necessary to have a  soldering outfit for properly closing them. This consists of a capping  steel, a tipping iron, solder in small strips and in powder form, a  small can of sal ammoniac, and a bottle of flux, which is a fluid that  makes solder stick to tin.    47. Prepare the food that is to be canned in tin cans in the same way as  for canning in jars by the cold-pack method; likewise, pack the cans in  the same way, but allow the liquid and fruit or vegetables to come to  within only 1/4 inch of the top. Then proceed to close the cans. Apply  the flux to the groove in the top of each can where the solder is to be  melted, using for this purpose a small brush or a small stick having a  piece of cloth wrapped around one end. Heat the capping steel, which  should be thoroughly clean, until it is almost red hot, dip it quickly  into a little of the flux, and then put it into a mixture consisting of  equal parts of sal ammoniac and powdered solder until it is covered with  bright solder. Put the cap on the can and apply the hot capping steel  covered with the solder. Hold this device firmly, press it downwards,  and turn it slowly as the solder melts and thus joins the cap to  the can.    48. After the caps are soldered in place, the air inside the cans must  be driven out through the small vent, or opening, usually in the center  of the cap, and the cans made air-tight. Therefore, place the cans into  boiling water to within 1/2 inch of the top and let them remain there  for a few minutes. Usually, 3 minutes in boiling water is sufficient.  Immediately after _exhausting_, as this process is called, apply a  little of the flux as in capping, and, with the tipping iron well heated  and a strip of solder, seal the hole in the caps. After this is done,  test each can for leaks by submerging it in water. If bubbles arise, it  is an indication that the cover is not tight and must be resoldered.    49. The next step consists in processing the cans of food. This may be  done either in a water bath or in a pressure cooker. If the cans are to  be processed in a water bath, keep them in the boiling water just as  long as glass jars of food would be kept there. If a pressure cooker is  to be used, keep the cans in it for 6 to 40 minutes, depending on the  steam pressure employed, the ripeness of the food or the necessity for  cooking it, and the size of the cans employed. For canning meat or fish,  processing in a pressure cooker is the most successful, as the high  temperature reached in it kills bacteria, which are difficult to destroy  at the boiling point.    As soon as the cans of food are removed from the water bath or the  pressure cooker, plunge them into cold water to stop the cooking and  prevent the food from getting soft and mushy. Then label the cans, so  that no mistake will be made as to their contents.    50. In another method, the tin cans may be closed without soldering the  caps on. The caps used in this case are different from those which must  be soldered. They are forced in place by a hand-pressure machine that  may be attached to a table. Otherwise the procedure is the same as that  just given.      OVEN METHOD    51. The OVEN METHOD oven method of canning is thought to be very  satisfactory by many housewives, but, as it is necessary to remove the  covers after cooking the contents of the jars, food canned in this way  is subjected to contamination, just as in the open-kettle method. In  addition, the jars are difficult to handle in the oven, owing to the  extreme heat that is required to cook the food in the jars.    52. In canning by the oven method, proceed by preparing the food as for  the cold-pack canning method; also, fill the jars with fruit or  vegetables and with liquid or sirup as in this method. Put the covers on  the jars loosely, omitting the jar rubbers. Place the jars in a shallow  pan of water, as in Fig. 21, and set the pan containing the jars into a  stove oven, which should be only slightly warm. At the same time place  the jar rubbers in a pan of boiling water, so that they may be  sterilized as the food cooks. When the jars are in the oven, increase  the heat gradually until the food in them boils. Then keep up a  temperature that will allow the food to boil quietly for a period long  enough to cook it soft and sterilize it. Usually, 30 to 45 minutes after  boiling has begun will be sufficient. During the cooking some of the  liquid in the jars evaporates. Therefore, when the jars of food are  ready to be removed from the oven, have boiling water or sirup ready,  remove the cover of each jar in turn, and fill the jar brimful with the  liquid. Then place a sterilized rubber in place and fasten the cover  down tight. The procedure from this point on is the same as in the other  canning methods.    [Illustration: FIG. 21]           *       *       *       *       *    CANNING VEGETABLES AND FRUITS    PREPARATION FOR CANNING    53. In canning, as in all other tasks related to cookery, the  housewife's aim should be to do the greatest amount of work, and do it  well, with the least effort on her part. The results she gets in  canning, then, will depend considerably on the orderly arrangement of  the utensils and materials with which she is to do the work. But of  greater importance is the preparation she makes to eliminate as much as  she can the possibilities of contamination, for, as has been repeatedly  pointed out, success in canning depends on the absence of  dangerous bacteria.    54. From what has just been mentioned, it is essential that everything  about the person who is to do the work and the place in which the work  is to done should be clean. Clean dresses and aprons should be worn, and  the hands and finger nails should be scrupulously clean. The kitchen  floor should be scrubbed and the furniture dusted with a damp cloth. Any  unnecessary utensils and kitchen equipment should be put out of the way  and those required for canning assembled and made ready for the work.  The jars should be washed and the covers tested by fitting them on  without the rubbers. If a glass cover rocks, it does not fit correctly;  and if a screw cover will not screw down tight, it should be discarded.  Without the rubber, there should be just enough space between the cover  and the jar to permit the thumb nail to be inserted as is shown in Fig.  3. The edge of each jar and each glass cover should be carefully  examined every time it is used, so that none with pieces chipped off  will be used, as these will admit air. This examination is made by  running the finger over the edge of the jar and the cover, as is shown  in Fig. 4. The jars, covers, and rubbers should be put into pans of cold  water, and the water should be brought to the boiling point and allowed  to boil for 15 minutes or more while the fruit or vegetables are being  prepared for canning. They should be kept in the hot water until the  food is ready to be placed in them. In the one-period cold-pack method,  it is not necessary to boil the jars, rubbers, and covers, but this may  be done if desired.    To produce good-looking jars of food, the fruit or vegetables to be  canned should be graded to some extent; that is, the finest of the  fruits or vegetables should be separated and used by themselves, as  should also those of medium quality. Often it is wise to use the poorest  foods for purposes other than canning. The food may then be canned  according to the chosen method, but by no means should methods be mixed.  In handling the product after it has been cooked by the open-kettle  method, any spoon, funnel, or other utensil must be thoroughly  sterilized in the same way as the jars and their covers and rubbers;  indeed, no unsterile utensil should ever be allowed to touch the food  when a jar is being filled.    [Illustration: FIG. 22]    55. It is by the observance of such precautions as these, some of them  seemingly unimportant, that the housewife will be repaid for her efforts  in canning and be able to produce canned fruits and vegetables like  those"]]]
