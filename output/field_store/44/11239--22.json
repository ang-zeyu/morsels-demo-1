Ethelwolf, impelled by the  urgency of the danger, marched against them at the head of the West  Saxons, and carrying with him his second son, Ethelbald, gave them  battle at Okely, and gained a bloody victory over them.  This  advantage procured but a short respite to the English.  The Danes  still maintained their settlement in the Isle of Thanet, and being  attacked by Ealher and Huda, governors of Kent and Surrey, though  defeated in the beginning of the action, they finally repulsed the  assailants [MN 853.], and killed both the governors.  They removed  thence to the Isle of Shepey; where they took up their winter  quarters, that they might farther extend their devastation and  ravages.  [FN [r] H. Hunt. lib. 5  Ethelward, lib. 3. cap. 3.  Simeon Dunelm. p.  120.  [s] Chron. Sax. p. 74.  Asserius, p. 2.]    This unsettled state of England hindered not Ethelwolf from making a  pilgrimage to Rome, whither he carried his fourth and favourite son,  Alfred, then only six years of age [t].  He passed there a twelvemonth  in exercises of devotion, and failed not in that most essential part  of devotion, liberality to the church of Rome.  Besides giving  presents to the more distinguished ecclesiastics, he made a perpetual  grant of three hundred mancuses [u] a year to that see; one-third to  support the lamps of St. Peter's, another those of St. Paul's, a third  to the pope himself [w].  In his return home he married Judith,  daughter of the emperor, Charles the Bald, but on his landing in  England, he met with an opposition which he little looked for.  [FN [t] Asserius, p. 2.  Chron. Sax. 76.  Hunt. lib. 5.  [u] A mancus  was about the weight of our present half-crown: see Spellman's  Glossary, IN VERBO Mancus.  [w] W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap 2.]    His eldest son, Athelstan, being dead, Ethelbald, his second, who had  assumed the government, formed, in concert with many of the nobles,  the project of excluding his father from a throne, which his weakness  and superstition seemed to have rendered him so ill-qualified to fill.  The people were divided between the two princes, and a bloody civil  war, joined to all the other calamities under which the English  laboured, appeared inevitable, when Ethelwolf had the facility to  yield to the greater part of his son's pretensions.  He made with him  a partition of the kingdom, and taking to himself the eastern part,  which was always at that time esteemed the least considerable, as well  as the most exposed [x], he delivered over to Ethelbald the  sovereignty of the western.  Immediately after, he summoned the states  of the whole kingdom, and with the same facility conferred a perpetual  and important donation on the church.  [FN [x] Asserius, p. 3.  W. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 2.  Matth. West. p.  1, 8.]    The ecclesiastics, in those days of ignorance, made rapid advances in  the acquisition of power and grandeur; and inculcating the most absurd  and most interested doctrines, though they sometimes met, from the  contrary interests of the laity, with an opposition which it required  time and address to overcome, they found no obstacle in their reason  or understanding.  Not content with the donations of land made them by  the Saxon princes and nobles, and with temporary oblations, from the  devotion of the people, they had cast a wishful eye on a vast revenue,  which they claimed as belonging to them by a sacred and indefeasible  title.  However little versed in the Scriptures, they had been able to  discover that, under the Jewish law, a tenth of all the produce of  land was conferred on the priesthood; and forgetting, what they  themselves taught, that the moral part only of that law was obligatory  on Christians, they insisted that this donation conveyed a perpetual  property, inherent by divine right in those who officiated at the  altar.  During some centuries, the whole scope of sermons and homilies  was directed to this purpose, and one would have imagined, from the  general tenor of these discourses, that all the practical parts of  Christianity were comprised in the exact and faithful payment of  tithes to the clergy [y].  Encouraged by their success in inculcating  these doctrines, they ventured farther than they were warranted even  by the Levitical law, and pretended to draw the tenth of all industry,  merchandise, wages of labourers, and pay of soldiers [z]; nay, some  canonists went so far as to affirm, that the clergy were entitled to  the tithe of the profits made by courtesans in the exercise of their  profession [a].  Though parishes had been instituted in England by  Honorius, Archbishop of Canterbury, near two centuries before [b], the  ecclesiastics had never yet been able to get possession of the tithes;  they therefore seized the present favourable opportunity of making  that acquisition, when a weak, superstitious prince filled the throne,  and when the people, discouraged by their losses from the Danes, and  terrified with the fear of future invasions, were susceptible of any  impression which bore the appearance of religion [c].  So meritorious  was this concession deemed by the English, that trusting entirely to  supernatural assistance, they neglected the ordinary means of safety,  and agreed, even in the present desperate extremity, that the revenues  of the church should be exempted from all burthens, though imposed for  national defence and security [d].

Beverl. p. 95]    [MN Ethelbald and Ethelbert. 857.]  Ethelwolf lived only two years after making this grant, and by his  will he shared England between his two eldest sons, Ethelbald and  Ethelbert; the west being assigned to the former, the east to the  latter.  Ethelbald was a profligate prince, and marrying Judith, his  mother-in-law, gave great offence to the people; but, moved by the  remonstrances of Swithin, Bishop of Winchester, he was at last  prevailed on to divorce her.  His reign was short; and Ethelbert, his  brother, succeeding to the government [MN 860.], behaved himself,  during a reign of five years, in a manner more worthy of his birth and  station.  The kingdom, however, was still infested by the Danes, who  made an inroad and sacked Winchester, but were there defeated.  A body  also of these pirates, who were quartered in the Isle of Thanet,  having deceived the English by a treaty, unexpectedly broke into Kent,  and committed great outrages.    [MN Ethered 866.]  Ethelbert was succeeded by his brother Ethered, who, though he  defended himself with bravery, enjoyed, during his whole reign, no  tranquillity from those Danish irruptions.  His younger brother,  Alfred, seconded him in all his enterprises, and generously sacrificed  to the public good all resentment which he might entertain on account  of his being excluded by Ethered from a large patrimony which had been  left him by his father.    The first landing of the Danes in the reign of Ethered was among the  East Angles, who, more anxious for their present safety than for the  common interest, entered into a separate treaty with the enemy, and  furnished them with horses, which enabled them to make an irruption by  land into the kingdom of Northumberland.  They there seized the city  of York, and defended it against Osbricht and Aella, two Northumbrian  princes, who perished in the assault [f].  Encouraged by these  successes, and by the superiority which they had acquired in arms,  they now ventured, under the command of Hinguar and Hubba, to leave  the sea-coast, and penetrating into Mercia, they took up their winter  quarters at Nottingham, where they threatened the kingdom with a final  subjection.  The Mercians, in this extremity, applied to Ethered for  succour, and that prince, with his brother Alfred, conducting a great  army to Nottingham, obliged the enemy to dislodge [MN 870.], and to  retreat into Northumberland.  Their restless disposition, and their  avidity for plunder, allowed them not to remain long in those  quarters; they broke into East Anglia, defeated and took prisoner  Edmund, the king of that country, whom they afterwards murdered in  cool blood, and committing the most barbarous ravages on the people,  particularly on the monasteries, they gave the East Angles cause to  regret the temporary relief which they had obtained by assisting the  common enemy.  [FN [f] Asser. p. 6.  Chron Sax. p. 79.]    [MN 871.] The next station of the Danes was at Reading, whence they  infested the neighbouring country by their incursions.  The Mercians,  desirous of shaking off their dependence on Ethered, refused to join  him with their forces; and that prince, attended by Alfred, was  obliged to march against the enemy with the West Saxons alone, his  hereditary subjects.  The Danes, being defeated in an action, shut  themselves up in their garrison; but quickly making thence an  irruption, they routed the West Saxons, and obliged them to raise the  siege.  An action soon after ensued at Aston, in Berkshire, where the  English, in the beginning of the day, were in danger of a total  defeat.  Alfred, advancing with one division of the army, was  surrounded by the enemy in disadvantageous ground; and Ethered, who  was at that time hearing mass, refused to march to his assistance till  prayers should be finished [g]: but as he afterwards obtained the  victory, this success, not the danger of Alfred, was ascribed by the  monks to the piety of that monarch.  This battle of Aston did not  terminate the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#18)"],[1,"with the high state of efficiency  to which he has brought us. At any rate I hope--\"    There was a sound of hurried footsteps outside the door, and Sharpe, a  member of the senior day room, burst excitedly in. He seemed amused.    \"I say, have you chaps seen Sammy?\"    \"Seen who?\" said Stone. \"Sammy? Why?\"    \"You'll know in a second. He's just outside. Here, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy!  Sam! Sam!\"    A bark and a patter of feet outside.    \"Come on, Sammy. Good dog.\"    There was a moment's silence. Then a great yell of laughter burst forth.  Even Psmith's massive calm was shattered. As for Jellicoe, he sobbed  in a corner.    Sammy's beautiful white coat was almost entirely concealed by a thick  covering of bright-red paint. His head, with the exception of the ears,  was untouched, and his serious, friendly eyes seemed to emphasise the  weirdness of his appearance. He stood in the doorway, barking and  wagging his tail, plainly puzzled at his reception. He was a popular  dog, and was always well received when he visited any of the houses, but  he had never before met with enthusiasm like this.    \"Good old Sammy!\"    \"What on earth's been happening to him?\"    \"Who did it?\"    Sharpe, the introducer, had no views on the matter.    \"I found him outside Downing's, with a crowd round him. Everybody seems  to have seen him. I wonder who on earth has gone and mucked him up  like that!\"    Mike was the first to show any sympathy for the maltreated animal.    \"Poor old Sammy,\" he said, kneeling on the floor beside the victim, and  scratching him under the ear. \"What a beastly shame! It'll take hours to  wash all that off him, and he'll hate it.\"    \"It seems to me,\" said Psmith, regarding Sammy dispassionately through  his eyeglass, \"that it's not a case for mere washing. They'll either  have to skin him bodily, or leave the thing to time. Time, the Great  Healer. In a year or two he'll fade to a delicate pink. I don't see why  you shouldn't have a pink bull terrier. It would lend a touch of  distinction to the place. Crowds would come in excursion trains to see  him. By charging a small fee you might make him self-supporting. I think  I'll suggest it to Comrade Downing.\"    \"There'll be a row about this,\" said Stone.    \"Rows are rather sport when you're not mixed up in them,\" said Robinson,  philosophically. \"There'll be another if we don't start off for chapel  soon. It's a quarter to.\"    There was a general move. Mike was the last to leave the room. As he was  going, Jellicoe stopped him. Jellicoe was staying in that Sunday, owing  to his ankle.    \"I say,\" said Jellicoe, \"I just wanted to thank you again about that--\"    \"Oh, that's all right.\"    \"No, but it really was awfully decent of you. You might have got into a  frightful row. Were you nearly caught?\"    \"Jolly nearly.\"    \"It _was_ you who rang the bell, wasn't it?\"    \"Yes, it was. But for goodness' sake don't go gassing about it, or  somebody will get to hear who oughtn't to, and I shall be sacked.\"    \"All right. But, I say, you _are_ a chap!\"    \"What's the matter now?\"    \"I mean about Sammy, you know. It's a jolly good score off old Downing.  He'll be frightfully sick.\"    \"Sammy!\" cried Mike. \"My good man, you don't think I did that, do you?  What absolute rot! I never touched the poor brute.\"    \"Oh, all right,\" said Jellicoe. \"But I wasn't going to tell anyone, of  course.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"You _are_ a chap!\" giggled Jellicoe.    Mike walked to chapel rather thoughtfully.        18    MR. DOWNING ON THE SCENT      There was just one moment, the moment in which, on going down to the  junior day room of his house to quell an unseemly disturbance, he was  boisterously greeted by a vermilion bull terrier, when Mr. Downing was  seized with a hideous fear lest he had lost his senses. Glaring down at  the crimson animal that was pawing at his knees, he clutched at his  reason for one second as a drowning man clutches at a life belt.    Then the happy laughter of the young onlookers reassured him.    \"Who--\" he shouted, \"WHO has done this?\"    \"Please, sir, we don't know,\" shrilled the chorus.    \"Please, sir, he came in like that.\"    \"Please, sir, we were sitting here when he suddenly ran in, all red.\"    A voice from the crowd: \"Look at old Sammy!\"    The situation was impossible. There was nothing to be done. He could not  find out by verbal inquiry who had painted the dog. The possibility of  Sammy being painted red during the night had never occurred to Mr.  Downing, and now that the thing had happened he had no scheme of action.  As Psmith would have said, he had confused the unusual with the  impossible, and the result was that he was taken by surprise.    While he was pondering on this, the situation was rendered still more  difficult by Sammy, who, taking advantage of the door being open,  escaped and rushed into the road, thus publishing his condition to all  and sundry. You can hush up a painted dog while it confines itself to  your own premises, but once it has mixed with the great public, this  becomes out of the question. Sammy's state advanced from a private  trouble into a row. Mr. Downing's next move was in the same direction  that Sammy had taken, only, instead of running about the road, he went  straight to the headmaster.    The Head, who had had to leave his house in the small hours in his  pajamas and a dressing gown, was not in the best of tempers. He had a  cold in the head, and also a rooted conviction that Mr. Downing, in  spite of his strict orders, had rung the bell himself on the previous  night in order to test the efficiency of the school in saving themselves  in the event of fire. He received the housemaster frostily, but thawed  as the latter related the events which had led up to the ringing of  the bell.    \"Dear me!\" he said, deeply interested. \"One of the boys at the school,  you think?\"    \"I am certain of it,\" said Mr. Downing.    \"Was he wearing a school cap?\"    \"He was bareheaded. A boy who breaks out of his house at night would  hardly run the risk of wearing a distinguishing cap.\"    \"No, no, I suppose not. A big boy, you say?\"    \"Very big.\"    \"You did not see his face?\"    \"It was dark and he never looked back--he was in front of me all the  time.\"    \"Dear me!\"    \"There is another matter ...\"    \"Yes?\"    \"This boy, whoever he was, had done something before he rang the  bell--he had painted my dog Sampson red.\"    The headmaster's eyes protruded from their sockets. \"He--he--_what_, Mr.  Downing?\"    \"He painted my dog red--bright red.\" Mr. Downing was too angry to see  anything humorous in the incident. Since the previous night he had been  wounded in his tenderest feelings, his Fire Brigade system had been most  shamefully abused by being turned into a mere instrument in the hands of  a malefactor for escaping justice, and his dog had been held up to  ridicule to all the world. He did not want to smile; he wanted revenge.    The headmaster, on the other hand, did want to smile. It was not his  dog, he could look on the affair with an unbiased eye, and to him there  was something ludicrous in a white dog suddenly appearing as a red dog.    \"It is a scandalous thing!\" said Mr. Downing.    \"Quite so! Quite so!\" said the headmaster hastily. \"I shall punish the  boy who did it most severely. I will speak to the school in the Hall  after chapel.\"    Which he did, but without result. A cordial invitation to the criminal  to come forward and be executed was received in wooden silence by the  school, with the exception of Johnson III, of Outwood's, who, suddenly  reminded of Sammy's appearance by the headmaster's words, broke into a  wild screech of laughter, and was instantly awarded two hundred lines.    The school filed out of the Hall to their various lunches, and Mr.  Downing was left with the conviction that, if he wanted the criminal  discovered, he would have to discover him for himself.    The great thing in affairs of this kind is to get a good start, and  Fate, feeling perhaps that it had been a little hard upon Mr. Downing,  gave him a most magnificent start. Instead of having to hunt for a  needle in a haystack, he found himself in a moment in the position of  being set to find it in a mere truss of straw.    It was Mr. Outwood who helped him. Sergeant Collard had waylaid the  archaeological expert on his way to chapel, and informed him that at  close on twelve the night before he had observed a youth, unidentified,  attempting to get into his house _via_ the water pipe. Mr. Outwood,  whose thoughts were occupied with apses and plinths, not to mention  cromlechs, at the time, thanked the sergeant with absent minded  politeness and passed on. Later he remembered the fact apropos of some  reflections on the subject of burglars in medieval England, and passed  it on to Mr. Downing as they walked back to lunch.    \"Then the boy was in your house!\" exclaimed Mr. Downing.    \"Not actually in, as far as I understand. I gather from the sergeant  that he interrupted him before--\"    \"I mean he must have been one of the boys in your house.\"    \"But what was he doing out at that hour?\"    \"He had broken out.\"    \"Impossible, I think. Oh yes, quite impossible! I went around the  dormitories as usual at eleven o'clock last night, and all the boys were  asleep--all of them.\"    Mr. Downing was not listening. He was in a state of suppressed  excitement and exultation, which made it hard for him to attend to his  colleague's slow utterances. He had a clue! Now that the search had  narrowed itself down to Outwood's house, the rest was comparatively  easy. Perhaps Sergeant Collard had actually recognized the boy. On  reflection he dismissed this as unlikely, for the sergeant would  scarcely have kept a thing like that to himself; but he might very well  have seen more of him than he, Downing, had seen. It was only with an  effort that he could keep himself from rushing to the sergeant then and  there, and "]]]
