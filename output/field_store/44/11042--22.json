It has always seemed to me better in such cases to make people follow  one's own wishes by seeming to consult theirs, rather than by a direct  order. Acting on this plan, though with my own mind made up, I consulted  with my two mates. I felt sure that Jim would agree with me, from a remark  he had made to a mutual friend to the effect that \"he would follow me to  h--l.\" Of paddy I was not so sure; nor was I mistaken. He strongly  advised turning back, but, having agreed to abide by the majority, said no  more, and so to the hills we turned our steps.    Our hopes that the two lakes were separate were soon shattered, for before  us lay a narrow neck connecting the two. There was nothing for it but to  go straight ahead. The lightest-packed camel crossed without mischance,  but not so the other two; down they went, too weak to struggle, and again  the toil of digging them out, and driving and hauling them foot by foot,  had to be gone through. Then the packs had to be carried piece by piece,  for we sank too deep in the sticky mud with a heavy load, and our weary  legs had to be dragged step after step from the bog. Hungry and thirsty,  blistered by the glare of the salt in the pitiless sun, we struggled on,  with a wondering thought of what the end would be.    Think of us, picture us, ye city magnates, toiling and struggling that  your capacious pockets may be filled by the fruits of our labour: think of  us, I say, and remember that our experiences are but as those of many  more, and that hardly a mine, out of which you have made all the profit,  has been found without similar hardships and battles for life! Not a  penny would you have made from the wealth of West Australia but for us  prospectors--and what do we get for our pains? A share in the bare sale of  the mine if lucky; if not, God help us! for nothing but curses and  complaints will be our portion. The natural rejoinder to this is, \"Why,  then, do you go?\" To which I can only answer that one must make a living  somehow, and that some like to make money hard, and some to make it  easily. Perhaps I belong to the former class.    Whatever the reason, the fact remains that in the heat of the summer we  were ploughing our way through salt-bogs, without water or any immediate  prospect of getting any, and realised, not for the first time, that the  prospector's life in West Australia is not \"all beer and skittles.\"    The lake negotiated, we decided to rest under the scanty shade of a mulga  tree, and regaled ourselves on oatmeal washed down with a mouthful of  water, the last, hot from the iron casks. At a time when water is  plentiful it can be carried and kept cool in canvas bags; but it owes  this coolness to evaporation, and consequent waste of water. During the  hot weather, when water is scarce, I never allowed canvas bags to be used,  and so saved water, not only by avoiding evaporation, but from the fact  that water carried in galvanised-iron casks becomes so hot and unpalatable  that one is not tempted to take a big draught, and thus the supply is eked  out.    That night we camped in the thick mulga, and from one of the larger trees  I could see the hills, dead on our course, and not more than two miles  off. But we were too tired to go further that night, and in any case could  have done but little good in the dark. The poor camels were too dry to  eat the mulga we cut for them, too dry even to chew the cud; and lay  silent, tied down beside us--the stillness of the night being unbroken by  the rhythmical \"crunch\" of their jaws.    Before sunrise we were packed and away, and shortly reached the hills  which we found to be, as we had hoped, bare granite rocks. Leaving the  camels, we spread out, and searched every hole and corner without success.  Every rock-hole was dry. One native soak we found, from which we scraped  about half gallon of water none too clear, and the less tempting from the  close proximity of the dead body of a gin, a young native woman,  fortunately not long dead. The ashes of a native camp but lately deserted,  could be seen close by; no doubt they had moved off as the supply of water  was so nearly done. Whether they had left the body to become a skeleton,  before making a bundle of the bones (a practice common to some Australian  tribes), or whether it is their usual custom to leave the dead where they  die, I do not know. I know, however, that this body was subsequently  moved, not by the blacks, but by those snarling scavengers, the dingoes.    This finding of a corpse at the mouth of the only soak we had seen was  hardly encouraging; but still there was a large extent of rocks that we  had not yet visited. Shortly before sunset, as I stood on the summit of  the highest rock, I was astonished by the sight of some horses grazing in  a little valley beneath. I could hardly believe that I saw aright; it  seemed incredible that horsemen should have reached this drought-begirt  spot. Little time was wasted in idle speculation, and the appearance of  our camels soon proved the horses to be flesh and blood, and not mere  phantoms of the brain, unless indeed phantoms can snort and plunge!    The owner of the horses soon made his appearance, and, with reluctant  resignation, showed us the soak from which his horses were watered. He and  his mates, he said, were sinking for water in a likely spot some half-mile  away; in the meantime they used the soak, though it was evident it would  not last much longer. We must have water for our camels, and must use the  soak, I said, until their thirst was somewhat relieved, then in our turn  we would dig for soaks round the rocks. In the hottest time of the year  our poor patient beasts had been eight days without food, except of the  driest description, and eight days without water, struggling and kicking  in the salt-bogs. It was indeed a delight to quench their thirst at last.  All that night we worked without a minute's rest, digging, scraping, and  bailing, and secured enough to keep the camels going. For the next two  days we were engaged in sinking trial holes for soakages; no water,  however, rewarded our labours until the night of the second day, when we  struck a splendid supply, and for the time being our troubles were over.  Pitching a \"fly\" to keep off the sun's rays in the daytime, we were  content to do nothing but rest for the whole of the next day. Here again I  was fortunate in shooting an emu, a welcome addition to our provisions.    McIlwraith and his mates (the owners of the horses) had also struck a good  supply. From them we got the news which we already suspected that a new  find of gold had been made not five miles from the rocks. An apparently  rich find too! How strangely things turn out. Our ill-fortune in failing  to find the Erlistoun had forced us into a most unpleasant experience,  and yet that ill-fortune was turning into good. For here we were on the  scene of newly-discovered reefs and nuggets, at the new rush, the  existence of which we had gravely doubted. We were the third party on the  field, and from Messrs. Rogers and friends I heard the history of its  discovery.          CHAPTER V        GOLD AT LAKE DARLOT      About the month of October, 1894, Rogers and party, with their camels,  were camped at Cutmore's (or Doyle's) Well, and, on studying the map of  the Elder Exploring Expedition, they saw that Mr. Wells had marked the  country north of Lake Darlot as \"probably auriferous.\" This they  determined to visit, and, more fortunate than ourselves, were not caught  in the intricacies of the salt lake.    Returning in disgust, having found no signs of gold, they passed the  granites, where they got water, and camped on a promising piece of  country, where they soon found gold in the the reefs. Here they worked for  some time with but little encouragement, until after Christmas, when  alluvial gold was found on the surface by a member of another party who  came upon the original discoverers in a somewhat startling manner.    Cable, Janet, and Pickering had pushed out also from Cutmore's Well, and  by finding water on a granite between the two, had reached the rocks near  Lake Darlot. Here they found camped a tribe of aboriginals, to whom they  showed kindness--too much kindness it appears, for the treacherous  thieves, having tasted the white man's food, conceived the bold idea of  raiding the camp, killing its occupants, and annexing their provisions.  At midnight the prospectors were attacked, Cable and Janet being speared  as they lay in their blankets, Cable through the stomach and Janet in  the arm, Pickering escaping, for he had laid down his blanket under a  tree, away from the packs, to get shade from the moon. He is, too, a man  of exceptionally small stature, and so eluded the quick sight of the  black-fellow.    In spite of the disadvantage under which they were placed by the sudden  attack and wounds, the white men overpowered and dispersed their  treacherous foes. In what a terrible position they were now placed,  fifty-five miles from Cutmore's Well, the nearest certain water, for the  chances that the water found between would be dried up, were great! Only  one man unwounded and one suffering the most awful tortures of pain; and  nobody with the smallest medical skill, within God knows how many miles!  Death seemed certain, but while life remained they were not the men to  give in, and they thought of a plan whereby the life of their mate might  be saved if only their horses held out. They travelled five miles, then  camped, and the available man returned to the rocks to water the horses  at the risk of being again attacked by the niggers. And thus dot and go  one, they hoped to reach Cutmore's.    So much endurance could not remain unrewarded and the two wounded men were  overjoyed by the report of a shot (a dynamite shot as it afterwards  transpired, fired by Rogers,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4985"],[0,"Ruth Fielding of the Red Mill; Or, Jasper Parloe's Secret (#17)"],[1,"miller's real nature to coax him, or to reason with him  regarding this gruff decision he had made. She had to make up her mind  that, unless something unexpected happened to change Uncle Jabez, she  was cut off from much future association with her dear chum, Helen  Cameron.    She got up in a little while, bathed her face and eyes, and kissed  Aunt Alvirah warmly.    \"You are a dear!\" she declared, hugging the little old woman. \"Come! I  won't cry any more. I'll come down stairs with you, Auntie, and help  get dinner.\"    But Ruth could eat none herself. She did not feel as though she could  even sit at the table with Uncle Jabez that noon, and remained outside  while the miller ate. He never remarked upon her absence, or paid her  the least attention. Oh, how heartily Ruth wished now that she had  never come away from Darrowtown and had never seen the Red Mill.    The next Monday morning the rural mail carrier brought her a long  letter from Helen. Uncle Jabez had not said anything against a  correspondence; indeed, Ruth did not consider that he had more than  refused to have the Camerons come to see her or she to return their  visits. If she met them on the road, or away from the house, she did  not consider that it would be disobeying Uncle Jabez to associate with  Helen and Tom.    This letter from Helen was very bitter against the miller and wildly  proposed that Ruth should run away from the Red Mill and come to  Overlook to live. She declared that her papa would not object--  indeed, that everybody would warmly welcome the appearance of Ruth  Fielding \"even if she came like a tramp \"; and that Tom would linger  about the Red Mill for an hour or two every evening so that Ruth could  slip out and communicate with her friends, or could be helped away if  she wanted to leave without the miller's permission.    But Ruth, coming now to consider her situation more dispassionately,  simply wrote a loving letter in reply to Helen's, entrusting it to the  post, and went on upon her usual way, helping Aunt Alviry, going to  school, and studying harder than ever. She missed Helen's  companionship vastly; she often wet her pillow with tears at night  (and that was not like Ruth) and felt very miserable indeed at times.    But school and its routine took up a deal of the girl's thought. Her  studies confined her more and more as the end of the term approached.  And in addition to the extra work assigned the girl at the Red Mill by  Miss Cramp, there was a special study which Ruth wished to excel in.  Miss Cramp was old-fashioned enough to believe that spelling was the  very best training for the mind and the memory and that it was a  positive crime for any child to grow up to be a slovenly speller. Four  times a year Miss Cramp held an old-fashioned \"spelling-bee\" at the  schoolhouse, on designated Friday evenings; and now came the last of  the four for this school year.    Ruth had never been an extra good speller, but because her kind  teacher was so insistent upon the point, the girl from the Red Mill  put forth special efforts to please Miss Cramp in this particular. She  had given much spare time to the study of the spelling book, and  particularly did she devote herself to that study now that she hadn't  her chum to associate with.    The spelling-bees were attended by the parents of the pupils and all  the neighbors thereabout, and Helen wrote that she and Tom were going  to attend on the evening in question and that Tom said he hoped to see  Ruth \"just eat up those other girls\" when it came to spelling. But  Ruth Fielding much doubted her cannibalistic ability in this line.  Julia Semple had borne off the honors on two occasions during the  winter, and her particular friend Rosa Ball, had won the odd trial.  Now it was generally considered that the final spelling-bee would be  the occasion of a personal trial of strength between the two friendly  rivals. Either Julia or Rosa must win.    But Ruth was the kind of a person who, in attempting a thing, did her  very best to accomplish it. She had given some time and thought to the  spelling book. She was not likely to \"go down\" before any easy, or  well-known word. Indeed, she believed herself letter perfect in the  very hardest page of the spelling-book some time before the fateful  evening.    \"Oh, perhaps you think you know them all, Ruth Fielding!\" exclaimed  one of the little girls one day when the spelling-bee was being  discussed at recess. \"But Miss Cramp doesn't stick to the speller. You  just wait till she tackles the dictionary.\"    \"The dictionary!\" cried Ruth.    \"That's what Miss Cramp does,\" the child assured her. \"If she can't  spell them down out of the speller, she begins at the beginning of the  dictionary and gives words out until she finds one that floors them  all. You wait and see!\"    So Ruth thought it would do no harm to study the dictionary a little,  and taking her cue from what the little girls said, she remained in  between sessions and began with \"aperse,\" committing to memory as well  as she could those words that looked to be \"puzzlers.\" Before the day  of the spelling-bee she believed that, if Miss Cramp didn't go beyond  the first letter of the alphabet, she would be fairly well grounded in  the words as they came in rotation.    Ruth knew that every other pupil in the school would have friends in  the audience that evening save herself. She wished that Aunt Alvirah  could have attended the spelling-bee; but of course her back and her  bones precluded her walking so far, and neither of them dared ask  Uncle Jabez to hitch up and take them to the schoolhouse in his wagon.    The schoolhouse was crowded, all the extra seats that could be  provided were arranged in rows, and, it being a mild evening, the men  and bigger boys stood outside the open windows. There was a great  bustle and whispering until Miss Cramp's tinkling bell called the  audience as well as the pupils to order.    The scholars took their places according to their class standing in a  long row around the room. As one was spelled down he or she took a  seat again, and so the class was rapidly thinned out, for many of the  little folk missed on the very easiest words in the speller. Ruth  stood within ten pupils of the head of the line at the beginning and  when the spelling began she had an encouraging smile and nod from  Helen, who, with her brother, sat where they could see the girl from  the Red Mill Ruth determined to do her best.      CHAPTER XIX     THE STING OF POVERTY    At first Miss Cramp's \"giving out\" of the words was like repeated  volleys of small-arms in this orthographical battle. Every pupil well  knew the pages of two-syllable words beginning, \"baker, maker, poker,  broker, quaker, shaker\" and even the boys rattled these off, grinning  the while in a most sheepish fashion at their elder brothers or their  women-folk, who beamed in pride upon them until such lists as \"food,  soup, meat, bread, dough, butter\" bowled over the more shaky ones.    The first failures (and usually upon comparatively easy words) were  greeted with some laughter, and the ridiculed spellers sought their  seats with hanging heads. By and by, however, the failures were not  all at the bottom of the class; here and there such lists as \"inane,  profane, humane, insane, mundane, urbane,\" or, \"staid, unlaid,  mermaid, prayed, weighed, portrayed\" began to pick out uncertain ones  the entire length of the line.    Miss Cramp shot out word after word, her spectacles gleaming and her  eyes twinkling. The grim little smile upon her lips when one big girl  above Ruth went down before \"forswear,\" spelling it with an extra \"e,\"  showed that the teacher considered the miss deserved to fail because  of her heedlessness. Then, when she reached the list ending in \"ay, ey  and eigh\" they fell like ripe huckleberries all down the line.  \"Inveigh\" dropped so many that it was indeed a massacre, and some of  the nervous spellers got together such weird combinations of letters  to represent that single word that the audience was soon in a very  hilarious state.    \"Move up,\" commanded Miss Cramp to the pupils left standing, and there  was a great clumping of feet as the line closed up. Not more than two  dozen were standing by this time, and half an hour had not passed. But  after that it was another story. The good spellers remained. They  spelled carefully and quietly and a hush fell upon the whole room as  Miss Cramp gave out the words with less haste and more precision.    The \"seeds,\" as all the children called the puzzling list, floored  two, and several of the best spellers had to think carefully while the  list was being given out: \"proceed, succeed, exceed, accede, secede,  recede, impede, precede, concede, antecede, intercede, supersede.\"  Fortunately Ruth, who now kept her eyes upon Miss Cramp's face,  spelled carefully and correctly, without any sign of hesitancy. The  match went on then, for page after page, without a pupil failing.  Perhaps there was hesitation at times, but Miss Cramp gave any  deserving scholar ample time.    Page after page of the spelling-book was turned. That tricksey little  list of \"goblin, problem, conduct, rocket, pontiff, compact, prospect,  ostrich\" finally left but three scholars between Ruth and Julia at the  head of the class. One of these was Oliver Shortsleeves, a French  Canadian lad whose parents had Anglicised their name when they came  down into New York State. He was as sharp as could be and he had  pushed Julia Semple and Rosa Ball hard before in the spelling matches.  But he was the only boy left standing within the next few minutes, and  again the pupils moved up. There were but fifteen of them. Rosa Ball  came next to Ruth, below her, and the girl from the Red Mill knew very  well that Miss Ball would only be too delighted to spell her, Ruth,  down.    Indeed, when Ruth waited a moment before spelling \"seraglio,\" Rosa in  her haste"]]]
