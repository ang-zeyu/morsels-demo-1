Even in  the narrower confine of the latter, the fires of revolution are either  violently burning, or, at least, smouldering. Two of the oldest empires  in the world, which, together, have more than half of its population  (China and Russia) are in a welter of anarchy; while many lesser nations  are in a stage of submerged revolt. If the revolt were confined to  autocratic governments, we might see in it merely a reaction against  tyranny; but even in the most stable of democracies and among the most  enlightened peoples, the underground rumblings of revolution may be  heard.    The Government of Italy has been preserved from overthrow, not alone by  its constituted authorities, but by a band of resolute men, called the  \"fascisti,\" who have taken the law into their own hands, as did the  vigilance committees in western mining camps, to put down worse  disorders.    Even England, the mother of democracies, and the most stable of all  Governments in the maintenance of law, has been shaken to its very  foundations in the last three years, when powerful groups of men  attempted to seize the State by the throat and compel submission to  their demands by threatening to starve the community. This would be  serious enough if it were only the world-old struggle between capital  and labour and had only involved the conditions of manual toil. But the  insurrection against the political state in England was more political  than it was economic. It marked, on the part of millions of men, a  portentous decay of belief in representative government and its chosen  organ--the ballot box. Great and powerful groups had suddenly  discovered--and it may be the most portentous political discovery of the  twentieth century--that the power involved in their control over the  necessaries of life, as compared with the power of the voting franchise,  was as a forty-two centimetre cannon to the bow and arrow. The end  sought to be attained, namely the nationalization of the basic  industries, and even the control of the foreign policy of Great Britain,  vindicated the truth of the British Prime Minister's statement that  these great strikes involved something more than a mere struggle over  the conditions of labour, and that they were essentially seditious  attempts against the life of the State.[5]    [Footnote 5: I am here speaking of the conditions of 1920. I appreciate  the great improvement, which seems to me to justify the Lincoln-like  patience of Lloyd George.]    Nor were they altogether unsuccessful; for, when the armies of Lenin and  Trotsky were at the gates of Warsaw, in the summer of 1920, the attempts  of the Governments of England and Belgium to afford assistance to the  embattled Poles were paralysed by the labour groups of both countries,  who threatened a general strike if those two nations joined with France  in aiding Poland to resist a possibly greater menace to Western  civilization than has occurred since Attila and his Huns stood on the  banks of the Marne.    Of greater significance to the welfare of civilization is the complete  subversion during the world war of nearly all the international laws  which had been slowly built up in a thousand years. These principles, as  codified by the two Hague Conventions, were immediately swept aside in  the fierce struggle for existence, and civilized man, with his liquid  fire and poison gas and his deliberate; attacks upon undefended cities  and their women and children, waged war with the unrelenting ferocity of  primitive times.    Surely, this fierce war of extermination, which caused the loss of three  hundred billion dollars in property and thirty millions of human lives,  did mark for the time being the \"twilight of civilization.\" The hands on  the dial of time had been put back--temporarily, let us hope and pray--a  thousand years.    Nor will many question the accuracy of the second count in Pope  Benedict's indictment. The war to end war only ended in unprecedented  hatred between nation and nation, class and class, and man and man.  Victors and vanquished are involved in a common ruin. And if in this  deluge of blood, which has submerged the world, there is a Mount Ararat,  upon which the ark of a truer and better peace can find refuge, it has  not yet appeared above the troubled surface of the waters.    Still less can one question the closely related third and fourth counts  in Pope Benedict's indictment, namely the unprecedented aversion to  work, when work is most needed to reconstruct the foundations of  prosperity, or the excessive thirst for pleasure which preceded,  accompanied, and now has followed the most terrible tragedy in the  annals of mankind. The true spirit of work seems to have vanished from  millions of men; that spirit of which Shakespeare made his Orlando  speak when he said of his true servant, Adam:      \"O good old man! how well in thee appears    The constant service of the antique world.    When service sweat for duty, not for meed!\"    The _moral_ of our industrial civilization has been shattered. Work for  work's sake, as the most glorious privilege of human faculties, has  gone, both as an ideal and as a potent spirit. The conception of work as  a degrading servitude, to be done with reluctance and grudging  inefficiency, seems to be the ideal of millions of men of all classes  and in all countries.    The spirit of work is of more than sentimental importance. It may be  said of it, as Hamlet says of death: \"The readiness is all.\" All of us  are conscious of the fact that, given a love of work, and the capacity  for it seems almost illimitable--as witness Napoleon, with his  thousand-man power, or Shakespeare, who in twenty years could write  more than twenty masterpieces.    On the other hand, given an aversion to work, and the less a man does  the less he wants to do, or is seemingly capable of doing.    The great evil of the world to-day is this aversion to work. As the  mechanical era diminished the element of physical exertion in work, we  would have supposed that man would have sought expression for his  physical faculties in other ways. On the contrary, the whole history of  the mechanical era is a persistent struggle for more pay and less work,  and to-day it has culminated in world-wide ruin; for there is not a  nation in civilization which is not now in the throes of economic  distress, and many of them are on the verge of ruin. In my judgment, the  economic catastrophe of 1921 is far greater than the politico-military  catastrophe of 1914.    The results of these two tendencies, measured in the statistics of  productive industry, are literally appalling.    Thus, in 1920, Italy, according to statistics of her Minister of  Labour, lost 55,000,000 days of work because of strikes alone. From July  to September, many great factories were in the hands of revolutionary  communists. A full third of these strikes had for their end political  and not economic purposes.    In Germany, the progressive revolt of labour against work is thus  measured by competent authority: There were lost in strikes in 1917,  900,000 working days; in 1918, 4,900,000, and, in 1919, 46,600,000.    Even in our own favoured land, the same phenomena are observable. In the  State of New York alone for 1920, there was a loss due to strikes of  over 10,000,000 working days.    In all countries the losses by such cessations from labour are little as  compared with those due to the spirit which in England is called  \"ca'-canny\" or the shirking of performance of work, and of sabotage,  which means the deliberate destruction of machinery in operation.  Everywhere the phenomenon has been observed that, with the highest wages  known in the history of modern times, there has been an unmistakable  lessening of efficiency, and that with an increase in the number of  workers, there has been a decrease in output. Thus, the transportation  companies in the United States have seriously made a claim against the  United States Government for damages to their roads, amounting to  $750,000,000, claimed to be due to the inefficiency of labour during the  period of governmental operation.    Accompanying this indisposition to work efficiently has been a mad  desire for pleasure, such as, if it existed in like measure in preceding  ages, has not been seen within the memory of living man. Man has danced  upon the verge of a social abyss, and, as previously suggested, the  dancing has, both in form and in accompanying music, lost its former  grace and reverted to the primitive forms of crude vulgarity.    which gives the spectators the maximum of emotional expression with the  minimum of mental effort, had not been eclipsed by the splendour of a  Dempsey or a Carpentier.    Of the last count in Pope Benedict's indictment, I shall say but little.  It is more appropriate for the members of that great and noble  profession which is more intimately concerned with the spiritual advance  of mankind. It is enough to say that, while the Church as an institution  continues to exist, the belief in the supernatural and even in the  spiritual has been supplanted in the souls of millions of men by a gross  and debasing materialism.    If my reader agrees with me in my premises then we are not likely to  disagree in the conclusion that the causes of these grave symptoms are  not ephemeral or superficial; but must have their origin in some  deep-seated and world-wide change in human society. If there is to be a  remedy, we must first diagnose this malady of the human soul.    For example, let us not \"lay the flattering unction to our souls\" that  this spirit is solely the reaction of the great war.    The present weariness and lassitude of human spirit and the  disappointment and disillusion as to the aftermath of the harvest of  blood, may have aggravated, but they could not cause the symptoms of  which I speak; for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10066"],[0,"Gunman's Reckoning (#18)"],[1,"his  right forearm with his left hand.    The crowd hesitated still for a second, as though it feared to  interfere; but Donnegan had already put up his weapon. A wave of the  curious spectators rushed across the street and gathered around the  injured man. They found that he had been shot through the fleshy part of  the thumb, and the bullet, ranging down the arm, had sliced a furrow to  the bone all the way to the elbow. It was a grisly wound.    Big George Washington Green came running to the door of the dance hall  with a sprig of something green in his hand; one glance assured him that  all was well; and once more that wide, confident grin spread upon his  face. He came to the master and offered the mint; and Donnegan, raising  it to his face, inhaled the scent deeply.    \"Good,\" he said. \"And now for a julep, George! Let's go home!\"    Across the street a dark-eyed girl had clasped the arm of her companion  in hysterical excitement.    \"Did you see?\" she asked of her tall companion.    \"I saw a murderer shoot down a man; he ought to be hung for it!\"    \"But the mint! Did you see him smile over it? Oh, what a devil he is;  and what a man!\"    Jack Landis flashed a glance of suspicion down at her, but her dancing  eyes had quite forgotten him. They were following the progress of  Donnegan down the street. He rode slowly, and George kept that formal  distance, just a length behind.          18      Before Milligan's the crowd began to buzz like murmuring hornets around  a nest that has been tapped, when they pour out and cannot find the  disturber. It was a rather helpless milling around the wounded man, and  Nelly Lebrun was the one who worked her way through the crowd and came  to Andy Lewis. She did not like Andy. She had been known to refer to him  as a cowardly hawk of a man; but now she bullied the crowd in a shrill  voice and made them bring water and cloth. Then she cleansed and  bandaged the wound in Andy Lewis' arm and had some of them take him  away.    By this time the outskirts of the crowd had melted away; but those who  had really seen all parts of the little drama remained to talk. The  subject was a real one. Had Donnegan aimed at the hand of Andy and  risked his own life on his ability to disable the other without killing  him? Or had he fired at Lewis' body and struck the hand and arm only by  a random lucky chance?    If the second were the case, he was only a fair shot with plenty of  nerve and a great deal of luck. If the first were true, then this was a  nerve of ice-tempered steel, an eye vulture-sharp, and a hand,  miraculous, fast, and certain. To strike that swinging hand with a snap  shot, when a miss meant a bullet fired at his own body at deadly short  range--truly it would take a credulous man to believe that Donnegan had  coldly planned to disable his man without killing him.    \"A murderer by intention,\" exclaimed Milligan. He had hunted long and  hard before he found a man with a face like that of Lewis, capable of  maintaining order by a glance; now he wanted revenge. \"A murder by  intention!\" he cried to the crowd, standing beside the place where the  imprint of Andy's knees was still in the sand. \"And like a murderer he  ought to be treated. He aimed to kill Andy; he had luck and only broke  his hand. Now, boys, I say it ain't so much what he's done as the way  he's done it. He's given us the laugh. He's come in here in his dude  clothes and tried to walk over us. But it don't work. Not in The Corner.  If Andy was dead, I'd say lynch the dude. But he ain't, and all I say  is: Run him out of town.\"    Here there was a brief outburst of applause, but when it ended, it was  observed that there was a low, soft laughter. The crowd gave way between  Milligan and the mocker. It was seen that he who laughed was old Lebrun,  rubbing his olive-skinned hands together and showing his teeth in his  mirth. There was no love lost between Lebrun and Milligan, even if Nelly  was often in the dance hall and the center of its merriment.    \"It takes a thief to catch a thief,\" said Lebrun enigmatically, when he  saw that he had the ear of the crowd, \"and it takes a man to catch a  man.\"    \"What the devil do you mean by that?\" a dozen voices asked.    \"I mean, that if you got men enough to run out this man Donnegan, The  Corner is a better town than I think.\"    It brought a growl, but no answer. Lebrun had never been seen to lift  his hand, but he was more dreaded than a rattler.    \"We'll try,\" said Milligan dryly. \"I ain't much of a man myself\"--there  were dark rumors about Milligan's past and the crowd chuckled at this  modesty--\"but I'll try my hand agin' him with a bit of backing. And  first I want to tell you boys that they ain't any danger of him having  aimed at Andy's hand. I tell you, it ain't possible, hardly, for him to  have planned to hit a swingin' target like that. Maybe some could do it.  I dunno.\"    \"How about Lord Nick?\"    \"Sure, Lord Nick might do anything. But Donnegan ain't Lord Nick.\"    \"Not by twenty pounds and three inches.\"    This brought a laugh. And by comparison with the terrible and familiar  name of Lord Nick, Donnegan became a smaller danger. Besides, as  Milligan said, it was undoubtedly luck. And when he called for  volunteers, three or four stepped up at once. The others made a general  milling, as though each were trying to get forward and each were  prevented by the crowd in front. But in the background big Jack Landis  was seriously trying to get to the firing line. He was encumbered with  the clinging weight of Nelly Lebrun.    \"Don't go, Jack,\" she pleaded. \"Please! Please! Be sensible. For my  sake!\"    She backed this appeal with a lifting of her eyes and a parting of her  lips, and Jack Landis paused.    \"You won't go, dear Jack?\"    Now, Jack knew perfectly well that the girl was only half sincere. It is  the peculiar fate of men that they always know when a woman is playing  with them, but, from Samson down, they always go to the slaughter with  open eyes, hoping each moment that the girl has been seriously impressed  at last. As for Jack Landis, his slow mind did not readily get under the  surface of the arts of Nelly, but he knew that there was at least a  tinge of real concern in the girl's desire to keep him from the posse  which Milligan was raising.    \"But they's something about him that I don't like, Nelly. Something sort  of familiar that I don't like.\" For naturally enough he did not  recognize the transformed Donnegan, and the name he had never heard  before. \"A gunfighter, that's what he is!\"    \"Why, Jack, sometimes they call you the same thing; say that you hunt  for trouble now and then!\"    \"Do they say that?\" asked the young chap quickly, flushing with vanity.  \"Oh, I aim to take care of myself. And I'd like to take a hand with this  murdering Donnegan.\"    \"Jack, listen! Don't go; keep away from him!\"    \"Why do you look like that? As if I was a dead one already.\"    \"I tell you, Jack, he'd kill you!\"    Something in her terrible assurance whitened the cheeks of Landis, but  he was also angered. When a very young man becomes both afraid and angry  he is apt to be dangerous. \"What do you know of him?\" he asked  suspiciously.    \"You silly! But I saw his face when he lifted that mint. He'd already  forgotten about the man he had just shot down. He was thinking of  nothing but the scent of the mint. And did you notice his giant servant?  He never had a moment's doubt of Donnegan's ability to handle the entire  crowd. I tell you, it gave me a chill of ghosts to see the big black  fellow's eyes. He knew that Donnegan would win. And Donnegan won! Jack,  you're a big man and a strong man and a brave man, and we all know it.  But don't be foolish. Stay away from Donnegan!\"    He wavered just an instant. If she could have sustained her pleading  gaze a moment longer she would have won him, but at the critical instant  her gaze became distant. She was seeing the calm face of Donnegan as he  raised the mint. And as though he understood, Jack Landis hardened.    \"I'm glad you don't want me shot up, Nelly,\" he said coldly. \"Mighty  good of you to watch out for me. But--I'm going to run this Donnegan out  of town!\"    \"He's never harmed you; why--\"    \"I don't like his looks. For a man like me that's enough!\"    And he strode away toward Milligan. He was greeted by a cheer just as  the girl reached the side of her father.    \"Jack is going,\" she said. \"Make him come back!\"    But the old man was still rubbing his hands; there seemed to be a  perpetual chill in the tips of the fingers.    \"He is a jackass. The moment I first saw his face I knew that he was  meant for gun fodder--buzzard food! Let him go. Bah!\"    The girl shivered. \"And then the mines?\" she asked, changing her  tactics.    \"Ah, yes. The mines! But leave that to Lord Nick. He'll handle it well  enough!\"    So Jack Landis strode up the hill first and foremost of the six stalwart  men who wished to correct the stranger's apparent misunderstandings of  the status of The Corner. They were each armed to the teeth and each  provided with enough bullets to disturb a small city. All this in honor  of Donnegan.    They found the shack wrapped in the warm, mellow light of the late  afternoon; and on a flat-topped rock outside it big George sat  whittling a stick into a grotesque imitation of a snake coiled. He did  not rise when the posse approached. He merely rocked back upon the rock,  embraced his knees in both of his enormous arms, and, in a word,  transformed himself into a round ball of mirth. But having hugged away  his laughter he was able to convert his joy into a vast grin. That smile  stopped the posse. When a mob starts for a scene of violence the least  exhibition of fear incenses it, but mockery is apt to pour water on its  flames of anger.    Decidedly the fury of the posse was chilled by the grin of George.  Milligan, who had lived south of the Mason-Dixon "]]]
