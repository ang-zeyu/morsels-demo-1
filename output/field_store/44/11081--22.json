[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5803"],[0,"Not that it Matters (#17)"],[1,"with you, on the  subject (let us say) of heredity, a subject to which you had  devoted a good deal of study, I took it for granted that you had  read Ommany's Approximations, would you make it quite clear to me  that you had not read it? Or would you let me carry on the  discussion on the assumption that you knew it well; would you,  even, in answer to a direct question, say shamefacedly that  though you had not--er--actually read it, you--er--knew about it,  of course, and had--er--read extracts from it? Somehow I think  that I could lead you on to this; perhaps even make you say that  you had actually ordered it from your library, before I told you  the horrid truth that Ommany's Approximations was an invention of  my own.    It is absurd that we (I say \"we,\" for I include you now) should  behave like this, for there is no book over which we need be  ashamed, either to have read it or not to have read it. Let us,  therefore, be frank. In order to remove the unfortunate  impression of myself which I have given you, I will confess that  I have only read three of Scott's novels, and begun, but never  finished, two of Henry James'. I will also confess --and here I  am by way of restoring that unfortunate impression--that I do  quite well in Scottish and Jacobean circles on those five books.  For, if a question arises as to which is Scott's masterpiece, it  is easy for me to suggest one of my three, with the air of one  who has chosen it, not over two others, but over twenty. Perhaps  one of my three is the acknowledged masterpiece; I do not know.  If it is, then, of course, all is well. But if it is not, then I  must appear rather a clever fellow for having rejected the  obvious. With regard to Henry James, my position is not quite so  secure; but at least I have good reason for feeling that the two  novels which I was unable to finish cannot be his best, and with  a little tact I can appear to be defending this opinion hotly  against some imaginary authority who has declared in favour of  them. One might have read the collected works of both authors,  yet make less of an impression.    Indeed, sometimes I feel that I have read their collected works,  and Ommany's Approximations, and many other books with which you  would be only too glad to assume familiarity. For in giving  others the impression that I am on terms with these masterpieces,  I have but handed on an impression which has gradually formed  itself in my own mind. So I take no advantage of them; and if it  appears afterwards that we have been deceived together, I shall  be at least as surprised and indignant about it as they.          A Question of Form      The latest invention on the market is the wasp gun. In theory it  is something like a letter clip; you pull the trigger and the  upper and lower plates snap together with a suddenness which  would surprise any insect in between. The trouble will be to get  him in the right place before firing. But I can see that a lot of  fun can be got out of a wasp drive. We shall stand on the edge of  the marmalade while the beaters go through it, and, given  sufficient guns, there will not be many insects to escape. A  loader to clean the weapon at regular intervals will be a  necessity.    Yet I am afraid that society will look down upon the wasp gun.  Anything useful and handy is always barred by the best people. I  can imagine a bounder being described as \"the sort of person who  uses a wasp gun instead of a teaspoon.\" As we all know, a hat-  guard is the mark of a very low fellow. I suppose the idea is  that you and I, being so dashed rich, do not much mind if our  straw hat does blow off into the Serpentine; it is only the poor  wretch of a clerk, unable to afford a new one every day, who must  take precautions against losing his first. Yet how neat, how  useful, is the hat-guard. With what pride its inventor must have  given birth to it. Probably he expected a statue at the corner of  Cromwell Road, fitting reward for a public benefactor. He did not  understand that, since his invention was useful, it was probably  bad form.    Consider, again, the Richard or \"dicky.\" Could there be anything  neater or more dressy, anything more thoroughly useful? Yet you  and I scorn to wear one. I remember a terrible situation in a  story by Mr. W. S. Jackson. The hero found himself in a foreign  hotel without his luggage. To that hotel came, with her father,  the girl whom he adored silently. An invitation was given him to  dinner with them, and he had to borrow what clothes he could from  friendly waiters. These, alas! included a dicky. Well, the dinner  began well; our hero made an excellent impression; all was  gaiety. Suddenly a candle was overturned and the flame caught the  heroine's frock. The hero knew what the emergency demanded. He  knew how heroes always whipped off their coats and wrapped them  round burning heroines. He jumped up like a bullet (or whatever  jumps up quickest) and --remembered.    He had a dicky on! Without his coat, he would discover the dicky  to the one person of all from whom he wished to hide it. Yet if  he kept his coat on, she might die. A truly horrible dilemma. I  forget which horn he impaled himself upon, but I expect you and I  would have kept the secret of the Richard at all costs. And what  really is wrong with a false shirt-front? Nothing except that it  betrays the poverty of the wearer. Laundry bills don't worry us,  bless you, who have a new straw hat every day; but how terrible  if it was suspected that they did.    Our gentlemanly objection to the made-up tie seems to rest on a  different foundation; I am doubtful as to the psychology of that.  Of course it is a deception, but a deception is only serious when  it passes itself off as something which really matters. Nobody  thinks that a self-tied tie matters; nobody is really proud of  being able to make a cravat out of a length of silk. I suppose it  is simply the fact that a made-up tie saves time which condemns  it; the safety razor was nearly condemned for a like reason. We  of the leisured classes can spend hours over our toilet; by all  means let us despise those who cannot.    As far as dress goes, a man only knows the things which a man  mustn't do. It would be interesting if women would tell us what  no real lady ever does. I have heard a woman classified  contemptuously as one who does her hair up with two hair-pins,  and no doubt bad feminine form can be observed in other shocking  directions. But again it seems to be that the semblance of  poverty, whether of means or of leisure, is the one thing which  must be avoided.    Why, then, should the wasp gun be considered bad form? I don't  know, but I have an instinctive feeling that it will be. Perhaps  a wasp gun indicates a lack of silver spoons suitable for lethal  uses. Perhaps it shows too careful a consideration of the  marmalade. A man of money drowns his wasp in the jar with his  spoon, and carelessly calls for another pot to be opened. The  poor man waits on the outskirts with his gun, and the marmalade,  void of corpses, can still be passed round. Your gun proclaims  your poverty; then let it be avoided.    All the same I think I shall have one. I have kept clear of hat-  guards and Richards and made-up ties without quite knowing why,  but honestly I have not felt the loss of them. The wasp gun is  different; having seen it, I feel that I should be miserable  without it. It is going to be excellent sport, wasp-shooting; a  steady hand, a good eye, and a certain amount of courage will be  called for. When the season opens I shall be there, good form or  bad form. We shall shoot the apple-quince coverts first. \"Hornet  over!\"          A Slice of Fiction      This is a jolly world, and delightful things go on in it. For  instance, I had a picture post card only yesterday from William  Benson, who is staying at Ilfracombe. He wrote to say that he had  gone down to Ilfracombe for a short holiday, and had been much  struck by the beauty of the place. On one of his walks he  happened to notice that there was to be a sale of several plots  of land occupying a quite unique position in front of the sea. He  had immediately thought of me in connection with it. My readiness  to consider a good investment had long been known to him, and in  addition he had heard rumours that I might be coming down to  Ilfracombe in order to recruit my health. If so, here was a  chance which should be brought to my knowledge. Further  particulars ... and so on. Which was extremely friendly of  William Benson. In fact, my only complaint of William is that he  has his letters lithographed--a nasty habit in a friend. But I  have allowed myself to be carried away. It was not really of Mr.  Benson that I was thinking when I said that delightful things go  on in this world, but of a certain pair of lovers, the tragedy of  whose story has been revealed to me in a two-line \"agony\" in a  morning paper. When anything particularly attractive happens in  real life, we express our appreciation by saying that it is the  sort of thing which one reads about in books --perhaps the  highest compliment we can pay to Nature. Well, the story  underlying this advertisement reeks of the feuilleton and the  stage.    \"PAT, I was alone when you called. You heard me talking to the  dog. PLEASE make appointment. --DAISY.\"    You will agree with me when you read this that it is almost too  good to be true. There is a freshness and a naivete, about it  which is only to be found in American melodrama. Let us  reconstruct the situation, and we shall see at once how  delightfully true to fiction real life can be.    Pat was in love with Daisy--engaged to her we may say with  confidence (for a reason which will appear in a moment). But even  though she had plighted her troth to him, he was jealous,  miserably jealous, of every male being who approached her. One  day last week he called on her at the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5805"],[0,"The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel (#17)"],[1,"next morning Agnes de Lucines received, through an anonymous  messenger, the packet of letters which would so gravely have compromised  Arnould Fabrice. Though the weather was more inclement than ever, she  ran out into the streets, determined to seek out the old Public  Letter-Writer and thank him for his mediation with the English milor,  who surely had done this noble action.    But the old scarecrow had disappeared.          V    A FINE BIT OF WORK      I    \"Sh!... sh!... It's the Englishman. I'd know his footstep anywhere--\"    \"God bless him!\" murmured petite maman fervently.    Pere Lenegre went to the door; he stepped cautiously and with that  stealthy foot-tread which speaks in eloquent silence of daily, hourly  danger, of anguish and anxiety for lives that are dear.    The door was low and narrow--up on the fifth floor of one of the huge  tenement houses in the Rue Jolivet in the Montmartre quarter of Paris. A  narrow stone passage led to it--pitch-dark at all times, but dirty, and  evil-smelling when the concierge--a free citizen of the new  democracy--took a week's holiday from his work in order to spend whole  afternoons either at the wineshop round the corner, or on the Place du  Carrousel to watch the guillotine getting rid of some twenty aristocrats  an hour for the glorification of the will of the people.    But inside the small apartment everything was scrupulously neat and  clean. Petite maman was such an excellent manager, and Rosette was busy  all the day tidying and cleaning the poor little home, which Pere  Lenegre contrived to keep up for wife and daughter by working fourteen  hours a day in the government saddlery.    When Pere Lenegre opened the narrow door, the entire framework of it was  filled by the broad, magnificent figure of a man in heavy caped coat and  high leather boots, with dainty frills of lace at throat and wrist, and  elegant chapeau-bras held in the hand.    Pere Lenegre at sight of him, put a quick finger to his own quivering  lips.    \"Anything wrong, vieux papa?\" asked the newcomer lightly.    The other closed the door cautiously before he made reply. But petite  maman could not restrain her anxiety.    \"My little Pierre, milor?\" she asked as she clasped her wrinkled hands  together, and turned on the stranger her tear-dimmed restless eyes.    \"Pierre is safe and well, little mother,\" he replied cheerily. \"We got  him out of Paris early this morning in a coal cart, carefully hidden  among the sacks. When he emerged he was black but safe. I drove the cart  myself as far as Courbevoie, and there handed over your Pierre and those  whom we got out of Paris with him to those of my friends who were going  straight to England. There's nothing more to be afraid of, petite  maman,\" he added as he took the old woman's wrinkled hands in both his  own; \"your son is now under the care of men who would die rather than  see him captured. So make your mind at ease, Pierre will be in England,  safe and well, within a week.\"    Petite maman couldn't say anything just then because tears were choking  her, but in her turn she clasped those two strong and slender hands--the  hands of the brave Englishman who had just risked his life in order to  save Pierre from the guillotine--and she kissed them as fervently as she  kissed the feet of the Madonna when she knelt before her shrine in  prayer.    Pierre had been a footman in the household of unhappy Marie Antoinette.  His crime had been that he remained loyal to her in words as well as in  thought. A hot-headed but nobly outspoken harangue on behalf of the  unfortunate queen, delivered in a public place, had at once marked him  out to the spies of the Terrorists as suspect of intrigue against the  safety of the Republic. He was denounced to the Committee of Public  Safety, and his arrest and condemnation to the guillotine would have  inevitably followed had not the gallant band of Englishmen, known as the  League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, succeeded in effecting his escape.    What wonder that petite maman could not speak for tears when she clasped  the hands of the noble leader of that splendid little band of heroes?  What wonder that Pere Lenegre, when he heard that his son was safe  murmured a fervent: \"God bless you, milor, and your friends!\" and that  Rosette surreptitiously raised the fine caped coat to her lips, for  Pierre was her twin-brother, and she loved him very dearly.    But already Sir Percy Blakeney had, with one of his characteristic  cheery words, dissipated the atmosphere of tearful emotion which  oppressed these kindly folk.    \"Now, Papa Lenegre,\" he said lightly, \"tell me why you wore such a  solemn air when you let me in just now.\"    \"Because, milor,\" replied the old man quietly, \"that d----d concierge,  Jean Baptiste, is a black-hearted traitor.\"    Sir Percy laughed, his merry, infectious laugh.    \"You mean that while he has been pocketing bribes from me, he has  denounced me to the Committee.\"    Pere Lenegre nodded: \"I only heard it this morning,\" he said, \"from one  or two threatening words the treacherous brute let fall. He knows that  you lodge in the Place des Trois Maries, and that you come here  frequently. I would have given my life to warn you then and there,\"  continued the old man with touching earnestness, \"but I didn't know  where to find you. All I knew was that you were looking after Pierre.\"    Even while the man spoke there darted from beneath the Englishman's  heavy lids a quick look like a flash of sudden and brilliant light out  of the lazy depths of his merry blue eyes; it was one of those glances  of pure delight and exultation which light up the eyes of the true  soldier when there is serious fighting to be done.    \"La, man,\" he said gaily, \"there was no cause to worry. Pierre is safe,  remember that! As for me,\" he added with that wonderful insouciance  which caused him to risk his life a hundred times a day with a shrug of  his broad shoulders and a smile upon his lips; \"as for me, I'll look  after myself, never fear.\"    He paused awhile, then added gravely: \"So long as you are safe, my good  Lenegre, and petite maman, and Rosette.\"    Whereupon the old man was silent, petite maman murmured a short prayer,  and Rosette began to cry. The hero of a thousand gallant rescues had  received his answer.    \"You, too, are on the black list, Pere Lenegre?\" he asked quietly.    The old man nodded.    \"How do you know?\" queried the Englishman.    \"Through Jean Baptiste, milor.\"    \"Still that demmed concierge,\" muttered Sir Percy.    \"He frightened petite maman with it all this morning, saying that he  knew my name was down on the Sectional Committee's list as a 'suspect.'  That's when he let fall a word or two about you, milor. He said it is  known that Pierre has escaped from justice, and that you helped him to  it.    \"I am sure that we shall get a domiciliary visit presently,\" continued  Pere Lenegre, after a slight pause. \"The gendarmes have not yet been,  but I fancy that already this morning early I saw one or two of the  Committee's spies hanging about the house, and when I went to the  workshop I was followed all the time.\"    The Englishman looked grave: \"And tell me,\" he said, \"have you got  anything in this place that may prove compromising to any of you?\"    \"No, milor. But, as Jean Baptiste said, the Sectional Committee know  about Pierre. It is because of my son that I am suspect.\"    The old man spoke quite quietly, very simply, like a philosopher who has  long ago learned to put behind him the fear of death. Nor did petite  maman cry or lament. Her thoughts were for the brave milor who had saved  her boy; but her fears for her old man left her dry-eyed and dumb with  grief.    There was silence in the little room for one moment while the angel of  sorrow and anguish hovered round these faithful and brave souls, then  the Englishman's cheery voice, so full of spirit and merriment, rang out  once more--he had risen to his full, towering height, and now placed a  kindly hand on the old man's shoulder:    \"It seems to me, my good Lenegre,\" he said, \"that you and I haven't many  moments to spare if we mean to cheat those devils by saving your neck.  Now, petite maman,\" he added, turning to the old woman, \"are you going  to be brave?\"    \"I will do anything, milor,\" she replied quietly, \"to help my old man.\"    \"Well, then,\" said Sir Percy Blakeney in that optimistic, light-hearted  yet supremely authoritative tone of which he held the secret, \"you and  Rosette remain here and wait for the gendarmes. When they come, say  nothing; behave with absolute meekness, and let them search your place  from end to end. If they ask you about your husband say that you believe  him to be at his workshop. Is that clear?\"    \"Quite clear, milor,\" replied petite maman.    \"And you, Pere Lenegre,\" continued the Englishman, speaking now with  slow and careful deliberation, \"listen very attentively to the  instructions I am going to give you, for on your implicit obedience to  them depends not only your own life but that of these two dear women. Go  at once, now, to the Rue Ste. Anne, round the corner, the second house  on your right, which is numbered thirty-seven. The porte cochere stands  open, go boldly through, past the concierge's box, and up the stairs to  apartment number twelve, second floor. Here is the key of the  apartment,\" he added, producing one from his coat pocket and handing it  over to the old man. \"The rooms are nominally occupied by a certain  Maitre Turandot, maker of violins, and not even the concierge of the  place knows that the hunchbacked and snuffy violin-maker and the  meddlesome Scarlet Pimpernel, whom the Committee of Public Safety would  so love to lay by the heels, are one and the same person. The apartment,  then, is mine; one of the many which I occupy in Paris at different  times,\" he went on. \"Let yourself in quietly with this key, walk  straight across the"]]]
