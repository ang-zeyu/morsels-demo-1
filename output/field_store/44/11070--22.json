Brown (#17)"],[1,"the camp  with orders to the officers to form their companies into line, the men  were commanded to fall in, and all was rustle and bustle.    The writer had been up relieving his stomach of half-boiled wheat,  corn and peas, and had just got settled back in bed when the alarm  was fired, so he heard all that was going on. As we all slept in our  pantaloons, the first thing I thought of in that country of prickly  pears was my boots; and while reaching for these and bumping heads with  comrades, some of the men whose muskets were used for uprights for the  tent thought these the first articles in the emergency and seized them,  the tent coming down and the ridge-pole making another bump on heads.  At the same time we were all trapped in the fallen tent, which was  pinned down tight. I was trying to get the left boot on the right foot,  and my footwear being rather small I had no easy job. All being caught  in the tent-trap, the thought came how easy it would be for a body of  Mexican cavalry in a charge to cut us to pieces, and we soon burst  through the tent and fell into line.    For the first time in the whole march the writer brought up the rear  in getting to his place, and received a rebuke from the officer  in command, George P. Dykes. Right here, however, in that brief  experience, I learned a lesson I have never forgotten, namely, order  in dressing and undressing. We had been in the habit of putting  our clothing anywhere and each throwing his on top of another's,  if convenience appeared to suggest it, so that in the dark it was  difficult for each to get into his own raiment. I realized then how  important it was to have \"a place for everything and everything in its  place;\" hence to put every article of wearing apparel down so that in  the darkest hour of night I knew where to place my hand on it, and when  armed always to have my weapons in the best possible order and where  the hand might be laid on them without any mistakes.    Notwithstanding all the confusion, it seemed to me we were in line of  battle in very short order, awaiting an attack of Mexican cavalry.  There was a few minutes' breathless silence after we were ready for the  assault, and no enemy appearing, reconnoitering parties were sent out  to ascertain the true situation. We were held in readiness an hour or  more, then learning that everything was quiet, were permitted to retire  to our tents, but not without some apprehension of danger until the  dawn of day, which came bright and peaceful, and we began our march out  on what was known as the Ninety-five Mile Desert, which lay between us  and the Gila River.    After the first day's march on that awful stretch of barren waste, we  began to straggle along, and before the Gila was reached the command  was scattered along on the clay beds and sand strips for twenty miles.  We traveled night and day, not stopping at any one place more than six  hours.    The command was in a most deplorable condition on this journey. Many  were the men that lay down by the wayside without a hope that they  would live to reach water, and often thinking that they were behind the  command. But after they had rested for a few hours and perhaps dozed  long enough to dream that they died on the desert, and that the wolves  that were howling around were dragging their emaciated carcasses over  the sands or perchance in the alkali pools, so strongly impregnated  with poisonous stuff that it would consume, in a short time, the flesh  if not the bones also, then the thought of home and loved ones would  come; and what was sometimes last, though not the least, would be the  memory of the promises which the servants of God had made when we left  the dear ones of home. Then the worn and weary soldier would stagger  to his feet, survey the surroundings, and perhaps would catch sight,  in the distance, of some comrade who was staggering and reeling onward  toward the setting sun, and would follow in his path.    So the almost dead soldier would go on, his feet playing pit-a-pat as  they dragged past each other, until his limbs would refuse to carry him  farther, and down he would go and repeat the agonizing experience of  a few hours previous. He would also chew a buckshot or two to induce  moisture in his parching tongue, and would offer an earnest prayer from  his humble soul--a further exertion which he would not have brought his  wearied mind to do if it had not been for the confidence he placed in  the promises of God, made through His faithful servants.    Thus, dear reader, the renowned Mormon Battalion passed forward across  the great Gila Desert, almost without a human reason to hope that they  would reach the goal, and only able to accomplish their aim through  divine grace. When they succeeded in reaching the banks of the river,  their clothes were so tattered and torn that it was with difficulty  they could cover their nakedness.        CHAPTER X.

WHERE we reached the Gila River it was a lovely stream, four or live  rods wide; but the country was covered with alkali grass and mesquit  brush. We rested part of a day, then proceeded down the river eight  or ten miles, coming to a Pima Indian village. The Pima Indians were  superior to any that we had fallen in with heretofore. They were an  agricultural people, peacefully inclined, and kind and loving toward  each other. Those in the village appeared the picture of good health.  They came and went by twos, the males and females keeping each sex,  to themselves. They seemed the most affectionate people I had ever  met; happy and innocent in appearance--a large and handsome class of  persons. Each Indian was wrapped in a large home-made blanket.    The Pimas had corn, wheat, pumpkins, beans, and, I think, peas. Some  of the Indians noted our wretched and starved condition, and cut up a  lot of pumpkins--as we cut them for cows. These they boiled, and handed  to the soldiers as the latter passed by and took the proffered food in  anything they could get to hold the steaming hot vegetables. The men  were indeed thankful for these favors, although they came from Indians.    It was between the 20th and 25th of December when we left the Pima  Indian village, and passed down the Gila River to a broad, open,  fertile valley in the Maricopa Indian country. At the Maricopa Indian  villages we met many fine specimens of the native inhabitants. We  traded brass buttons for food. One brass button had more purchasing  power than a five dollar gold piece.    It was some five or six days before we passed out of the Maricopas'  farming country. There was a large bend in the river, and we traveled  three days over a rough, sandy country before we came to the stream  again. On this march we camped without water. The writer was one of  those who stood guard around the stock. The feed was so scarce that  we were kept running all night. I was so completely worn out next day  that at about eleven a.m. I sought rest by dropping out of the command  and hiding from the rearguard behind a clump of brush that grew on a  sand knoll. No sooner had I laid down than I fell into a sound slumber,  oblivious to all danger.    When the writer awakened from that sleep the rearguard had passed on  long before; the sun had changed position so that the drowsy soldier  felt perfectly lost, but gradually he came to realize that it was three  or four o'clock p.m. Some six or eight feet from where he had been  lying he found fresh bear tracks, telling him of the wild beast that  had been viewing him while wrapt in slumber. He hurried forward on the  trail, and reached camp just as the night guards were being posted and  his comrades were becoming greatly concerned for his safety.    Our route lay down the river, through deep sand and mesquit brush,  where we had not only to chop and clear away the brush, but had to push  and pull the wagons until our souls as well as our bodies were worn  out. We gathered mesquit and a kind of pod to feed our mules. We were  six days traveling sixty miles, to the crossing of the Colorado River,  or Red River, as it was called by some.    The reader will not wonder that on reaching this point a mountain of  gloom rested upon the whole command, causing the men almost to despair  as they, on the 10th day of January, 1847, stood on the banks of the  swift-flowing Colorado--the stream being half a mile wide at that  place--with no alternative but to wade across, pulling and pushing at  the wagons, then to cut and burn their way out, through the thick brush  on the bottom land, to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54335"],[0,"The Women of Mormondom (#17)"],[1,"em, as well as several of her grandsons, upwards  of six feet in height, with a score of great-grandchildren of various  sizes intermixed; surely the sight was not an uninteresting one. To her  it was very exciting--too much so for her years. Feverish symptoms,  which were apparent on the following day, indicated that her nervous  system had been overtaxed. She took her bed, and survived but a few  days. I was with her, and saw her calmly fall asleep. About ten minutes  before she expired, she saw a group of angels in the room; and pointing  towards them she exclaimed, \"O, how beautiful! but they do not speak.\"  It would seem that they were waiting to escort her spirit to its bright  abode.    But to return to the temple. After its dedication, the \"Kirtland High  School\" was taught in the attic story, by H. M. Hawes, professor of  Greek and Latin. The school numbered from one hundred and thirty to  one hundred and forty students, divided into three departments--the  classics, where only languages were taught; the English department,  where mathematics, common arithmetic, geography, English grammar,  reading and writing were taught; and the juvenile department. The  two last were under assistant instructors. The school was commenced  in November, 1836, and the progress of the several classes, on  examinations before trustees of the school, parents and guardians, was  found to be of the highest order.    Not only did the Almighty manifest his acceptance of that house, at  its dedication, but an abiding holy heavenly influence was realized;  and many extraordinary manifestations of his power were experienced on  subsequent occasions. Not only were angels often seen within, but a  pillar of light was several times seen resting down upon the roof.    Besides being devoted to general meetings for worship and the  celebration of the Lord's Supper every first day of the week, the  temple was occupied by crowded assemblies on the first Thursday in each  month, that day being observed strictly, by the Latter-day Saints, as a  day of fasting and prayer. These, called fast-meetings, were hallowed  and interesting beyond the power of language to describe. Many, many  were the pentecostal seasons of the outpouring of the spirit of God  on those days, manifesting the gifts of the gospel and the power of  healing, prophesying, speaking in tongues, the interpretation of  tongues, etc. I have there seen the lame man, on being administered to,  throw aside his crutches and walk home perfectly healed; and not only  were the lame made to walk, but the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the  dumb to speak, and evil spirits to depart.    On those fast days, the curtains, or veils, mentioned in a preceding  chapter, which intersected at right angles, were dropped, dividing the  house into four equal parts. Each of these sections had a presiding  officer, and the meeting in each section was conducted as though no  other were in the building, which afforded opportunity for four persons  to occupy the same time. These meetings commenced early in the day  and continued without intermission till four P.M. One hour previous  to dismissal, the veils were drawn up and the four congregations  brought together, and the people who, in the forepart of the day were  instructed to spend much of the time in prayer, and to speak, sing and  pray, mostly in our own language, lest a spirit of enthusiasm should  creep in, were permitted, after the curtains were drawn, to speak or  sing in tongues, prophesy, pray, interpret tongues, exhort or preach,  however they might feel moved upon to do. Then the united faith of the  saints brought them into close fellowship with the spirits of the just,  and earth and heaven seemed in close proximity.    On fast days, Father Smith's constant practice was to repair to the  temple very early, and offer up his prayers before sunrise, and there  await the coming of the people; and so strictly disciplined himself  in the observance of fasting, as not even to wet his lips with water  until after the dismissal of the meeting at four P.M. One morning,  when he opened meeting, he prayed fervently that the spirit of the  Most High might be poured out as it was at Jerusalem, on the day of  pentecost--that it might come \"like a mighty rushing wind.\" It was not  long before it did come, to the astonishment of all, and filled the  house. It appeared as though the old gentleman had forgotten what he  had prayed for. When it came, he was greatly surprised, and exclaimed,  \"What! is the house on fire?\"    While the faithful saints were enjoying those supernal privileges, \"the  accuser of the brethren\" did not sleep. Apostasy, with its poisonous  fangs, crept into the hearts of some who but a few months before were  in quorum meetings, when heavenly hosts appeared; and where, in all  humility of soul, they united with their brethren in sublime shouts of  hosanna to God and the Lamb. And now, full of pride and self-conceit,  they join hands with our enemies and take the lead in mobocracy against  the work which they had advocated with all the energies of their souls.    What a strange and fearful metamorphosis! How suddenly people become  debased when, having grieved away the spirit of God, the opposite takes  possession of their hearts! We read that angels have fallen, and that  one of our Saviour's chosen twelve was Judas, the traitor. Inasmuch  as the same causes produce the same effects in all ages, it is no  wonder that Joseph Smith, in introducing the same principles, should  have to suffer what was to the philosophic Paul the greatest of all  trials--that among false brethren.    Illegal, vexatious lawsuits, one after another, were successively  instituted, and the leading officers of the church dragged into court,  creating great annoyance and expenditure. This not being sufficient to  satisfy the greed of persecution, the lives of some of the brethren  were sought, and they left Kirtland, and sought safety in the West.    At this time my father was residing one mile south of the temple. About  twelve o'clock one bitter cold night he was startled by a knock at the  door, and who should enter but Father Smith, the patriarch! A State's  warrant had been served on him for an alleged crime, and the officer in  whose custody he was placed, although an enemy to the church, knowing  the old gentleman to be innocent, had preconcerted a stratagem by which  he had been let down from a window in the room to which he had taken  him, ostensibly for private consultation but purposely to set him at  liberty, having previously prepared a way by which he could reach the  ground uninjured. He also told him where to go for safety, directing  him to my father's house. The officer returned to the court-room as  though Father Smith followed in the rear, when, on a sudden, he looked  back, and not seeing his prisoner, he hurried back to the private room,  examining every point, and returned in great apparent amazement and  confusion, declaring that the prisoner had gone in an unaccountable  manner, saying, ludicrously, \"This, gentlemen, is another Mormon  miracle.\" No vigorous search was made--all must have been convinced  that the proceedings were as unjust as illegal. To return to my  father's house: We were proud of our guest, and all of the family took  pleasure in anticipating and supplying his wants. He remained with us  two weeks, and in the meantime settled up all his business matters,  and, having been joined by his youngest son, Don Carlos, and five other  brethren, whose lives had been threatened, he bade a final adieu to  Kirtland, at one hour past midnight, on the 21st of December, 1837. The  night was intensely cold, but, as they had no conveyance except one  horse, they had sufficient walking exercise to prevent freezing. They  found a few Latter-day Saints in a southern county of Ohio, where they  stayed till spring, when they left for Missouri.    The pressure of opposition increased, and before spring the prophet and  his brother Hyrum had to leave; and, in the spring and summer of 1838,  the most of the church followed; leaving our homes, and our sacred,  beautiful temple, the sanctuary of the Lord God of Hosts.        CHAPTER XIV.    AN ILLUSTRIOUS MORMON WOMAN--THE FIRST WIFE OF THE IMMORTAL HEBER C.  KIMBALL--OPENING CHAPTER OF HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY--HER WONDERFUL VISION--AN  ARMY OF ANGELS SEEN IN THE HEAVENS.    One of the very queens of Mormondom, and a woman beloved by the whole  church, during her long eventful lifetime, was the late Vilate Kimball.  To-day she sleeps by the side of her great husband, for Heber C.  Kimball was one of the world's remarkable men. He soon followed her to  the grave; a beautiful example she of the true love existing between  two kindred souls notwithstanding polygamy. Her sainted memory is  enshrined in the hearts of her people, and ever will be as long as the  record of the sisters endures.    \"My maiden name,\" she says, in her autobiography, \"was Vilate Murray. I  am the youngest daughter of Roswell and Susannah Murray. I was born in  Florida, Montgomery county, New York, June 1st, 1806. I was married to  Heber Chase Kimball November 7, 1822, having lived until that time with  my parents in Victor, Ontario county.    \"After marriage my husband settled in Mendon, Monroe county. Here we  resided until we gathered in Kirtland in the fall of 1833.    \"About three weeks before we heard of the latter-day work we were  baptized into the Baptist Church.    \"Five elders of the Church of Latter-day Saints came to the town of  Victor, which was five miles from Mendon, and stopped at the house of  Phineas Young, the brother of Brigham. Their names were Eleazer Miller,  Elial Strong, Alpheus Gifford, Enos Curtis and Daniel Bowen.    \"Hearing of these men, curiosity prompted Mr. Kimball to go and see  them. Then for the first time he heard the fullness of the everlasting  gospel and was convinced of its truth."]]]
