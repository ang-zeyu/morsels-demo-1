The new peas wouldn't hurt enough. They're so soft they'd  just squash flat.\"    \"I'll tell you,\" said Peter, \"I'll pick up a lot of those little round  pebbles on Mr. King's front walk. They'll be just as good as peas.\"    \"You'll do nothing of the sort,\" said Aunt Janet. \"Sara must not do  penance in that way. She would wear holes in her stockings, and might  seriously bruise her feet.\"    \"What would you say if I took a whip and whipped my bare shoulders till  the blood came?\" demanded the Story Girl aggrieved.    \"I wouldn't SAY anything,\" retorted Aunt Janet. \"I'd simply turn you  over my knee and give you a sound, solid spanking, Miss Sara. You'd find  that penance enough.\"    The Story Girl was crimson with indignation. To have such a remark made  to you--when you were fourteen and a half--and before the boys, too!  Really, Aunt Janet could be very dreadful.    It was vacation, and there was not much to do that day; we were soon  free to seek the orchard. But the Story Girl would not come. She had  seated herself in the darkest, hottest corner of the kitchen, with a  piece of old cotton in her hand.    \"I am not going to play to-day,\" she said, \"and I'm not going to tell a  single story. Aunt Janet won't let me put pebbles in my shoes, but I've  put a thistle next my skin on my back and it sticks into me if I lean  back the least bit. And I'm going to work buttonholes all over this  cotton. I hate working buttonholes worse than anything in the world, so  I'm going to work them all day.\"    \"What's the good of working buttonholes on an old rag?\" asked Felicity.    \"It isn't any good. The beauty of penance is that it makes you feel  uncomfortable. So it doesn't matter what you do, whether it's useful or  not, so long as it's nasty. Oh, I wonder how Sara is this morning.\"    \"Mother's going down this afternoon,\" said Felicity. \"She says none  of us must go near the place till we know whether it is the measles or  not.\"    \"I've thought of a great penance,\" said Cecily eagerly. \"Don't go to the  missionary meeting to-night.\"    The Story Girl looked piteous.    \"I thought of that myself--but I CAN'T stay home, Cecily. It would be  more than flesh and blood could endure. I MUST hear that missionary  speak. They say he was all but eaten by cannibals once. Just think how  many new stories I'd have to tell after I'd heard him! No, I must go,  but I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll wear my school dress and hat. THAT  will be penance. Felicity, when you set the table for dinner, put the  broken-handled knife for me. I hate it so. And I'm going to take a dose  of Mexican Tea every two hours. It's such dreadful tasting stuff--but  it's a good blood purifier, so Aunt Janet can't object to it.\"    The Story Girl carried out her self-imposed penance fully. All day she  sat in the kitchen and worked buttonholes, subsisting on bread and water  and Mexican Tea.    Felicity did a mean thing. She went to work and made little raisin pies,  right there in the kitchen before the Story Girl. The smell of raisin  pies is something to tempt an anchorite; and the Story Girl was  exceedingly fond of them. Felicity ate two in her very presence, and  then brought the rest out to us in the orchard. The Story Girl could see  us through the window, carousing without stint on raisin pies and Uncle  Edward's cherries. But she worked on at her buttonholes. She would not  look at the exciting serial in the new magazine Dan brought home from  the post-office, neither would she open a letter from her father. Pat  came over, but his most seductive purrs won no notice from his mistress,  who refused herself the pleasure of even patting him.    Aunt Janet could not go down the hill in the afternoon to find out how  Sara was because company came to tea--the Millwards from Markdale. Mr.  Millward was a doctor, and Mrs. Millward was a B.A. Aunt Janet was very  desirous that everything should be as nice as possible, and we were  all sent to our rooms before tea to wash and dress up. The Story Girl  slipped over home, and when she came back we gasped. She had combed her  hair out straight, and braided it in a tight, kinky, pudgy braid; and  she wore an old dress of faded print, with holes in the elbows and  ragged flounces, which was much too short for her.    \"Sara Stanley, have you taken leave of your senses?\" demanded Aunt  Janet. \"What do you mean by putting on such a rig! Don't you know I have  company to tea?\"    \"Yes, and that is just why I put it on, Aunt Janet. I want to mortify  the flesh--\"    \"I'll 'mortify' you, if I catch you showing yourself to the Millwards  like that, my girl! Go right home and dress yourself decently--or eat  your supper in the kitchen.\"    The Story Girl chose the latter alternative. She was highly indignant.  I verily believe that to sit at the dining-room table, in that shabby,  outgrown dress, conscious of looking her ugliest, and eating only bread  and water before the critical Millwards would have been positive bliss  to her.    When we went to the missionary meeting that evening, the Story Girl wore  her school dress and hat, while Felicity and Cecily were in their pretty  muslins. And she had tied her hair with a snuff-brown ribbon which was  very unbecoming to her.    The first person we saw in the church porch was Mrs. Ray. She told us  that Sara had nothing worse than a feverish cold.    The missionary had at least seven happy listeners that night. We were  all glad that Sara did not have measles, and the Story Girl was radiant.    \"Now you see all your penance was wasted,\" said Felicity, as we walked  home, keeping close together because of the rumour that Peg Bowen was  abroad.    \"Oh, I don't know. I feel better since I punished myself. But I'm going  to make up for it to-morrow,\" said the Story Girl energetically. \"In  fact, I'll begin to-night. I'm going to the pantry as soon as I get  home, and I'll read father's letter before I go to bed. Wasn't the  missionary splendid? That cannibal story was simply grand. I tried  to remember every word, so that I can tell it just as he told it.  Missionaries are such noble people.\"    \"I'd like to be a missionary and have adventures like that,\" said Felix.    \"It would be all right if you could be sure the cannibals would be  interrupted in the nick of time as his were,\" said Dan. \"But sposen they  weren't?\"    \"Nothing would prevent cannibals from eating Felix if they once caught  him,\" giggled Felicity. \"He's so nice and fat.\"    I am sure Felix felt very unlike a missionary at that precise moment.    \"I'm going to put two cents more a week in my missionary box than I've  been doing,\" said Cecily determinedly.    Two cents more a week out of Cecily's egg money, meant something of a  sacrifice. It inspired the rest of us. We all decided to increase  our weekly contribution by a cent or so. And Peter, who had had no  missionary box at all, up to this time, determined to start one.    \"I don't seem to be able to feel as int'rested in missionaries as you  folks do,\" he said, \"but maybe if I begin to give something I'll get  int'rested. I'll want to know how my money's being spent. I won't be  able to give much. When your father's run away, and your mother goes out  washing, and you're only old enough to get fifty cents a week, you can't  give much to the heathen. But I'll do the best I can. My Aunt Jane was  fond of missions. Are there any Methodist heathen? I s'pose I ought to  give my box to them, rather than to Presbyterian heathen.\"    \"No, it's only after they're converted that they're anything in  particular,\" said Felicity. \"Before that, they're just plain heathen.  But if you want your money to go to a Methodist missionary you can give  it to the Methodist minister at Markdale. I guess the Presbyterians can  get along without it, and look after their own heathen.\"    \"Just smell Mrs. Sampson's flowers,\" said Cecily, as we passed a trim  white paling close to the road, over which blew odours sweeter than the  perfume of Araby's shore. \"Her roses are all out and that bed of Sweet  William is a sight by daylight.\"    \"Sweet William is a dreadful name for a flower,\" said the Story Girl.  \"William is a man's name, and men are NEVER sweet. They are a great many  nice things, but they are NOT sweet and shouldn't be. That is for women.  Oh, look at the moonshine on the road in that gap between the spruces!  I'd like a dress of moonshine, with stars for buttons.\"    \"It wouldn't do,\" said Felicity decidedly. \"You could see through it.\"    Which seemed to settle the question of moonshine dresses effectually.        CHAPTER XII. THE BLUE CHEST OF RACHEL WARD    \"It's utterly out of the question,\" said Aunt Janet seriously. When Aunt  Janet said seriously that anything was out of the question it meant that  she was thinking about it, and would probably end up by doing it. If a  thing really was out of the question she merely laughed and refused to  discuss it at all.    The particular matter in or out of the question that opening day of  August was a project which Uncle Edward had recently mooted. Uncle  Edward's youngest daughter was to be married; and Uncle Edward had  written over, urging Uncle Alec, Aunt Janet and Aunt Olivia to go down  to Halifax for the wedding and spend a week there.    Uncle Alec and Aunt Olivia were eager to go; but Aunt Janet at first  declared it was impossible.    \"How could we go away and leave the place to the mercy of all those  young ones?\" she demanded. \"We'd come home and find them all sick, and  the house burned down.\"    \"Not a bit of fear of it,\" scoffed Uncle Roger. \"Felicity is as good a  housekeeper as you are; and I shall be here to look after them all, and  keep them from burning the house down.

He retired before Surrey's advance, and wished to retire to  France, but was prevented by the Scottish lords. Again the Border raids  went on with their merciless slaughter and plunder, amidst which was  developed the sternness and severity which still mark the character of  the northern folk.    Still, though the Scots might be defeated in the field, their defeat and  suffering only served to strengthen the spirit of national independence.  The subjugation of Scotland to England was hindered, not helped, by the  alliance with the Emperor, which only drew Scotland nearer to France,  and kept alive the old feeling of hostility. It was hard to see what  England had to gain from the imperial alliance, and events soon proved  that Charles V. pursued his own interests without much thought of the  wishes of Henry VIII.    On 14th September died Pope Adrian VI., a weary and disappointed man.  Again there was a prospect of Wolsey's election to the papacy; again it  might be seen how much Charles V. would do for his English ally. Wolsey  had little hope of his good offices, and was his own negotiator in the  matter. He was not sanguine about his prospects of success, as he knew  that Cardinal Medici was powerful in Rome; and the disasters of the  pontificate of Adrian VI. led the cardinals to wish for a return to the  old policy of Leo X., of which Medici held the threads. So two letters  were sent to the English representatives in Rome, one in behalf of  Wolsey, the other in behalf of Medici. If things were going for Medici,  Wolsey was not to be pressed; only in case of a disagreement was Wolsey  to be put forward, and then no effort was to be spared; money was to be  of no object, as Henry would make good any promises made on his behalf  to secure Wolsey's election.    The conclave was protracted; it sat from 1st October to 17th November,  and there was ample opportunity for Charles to have made his influence  felt in Wolsey's behalf. He professed to Henry that he was doing so. He  wrote a letter recommending Wolsey to his envoy in Rome, and then gave  orders that the courier who carried the letter should be detained on the  way. Really his influence was being used for Medici, and though a strong  party in the conclave opposed Medici's election, it does not appear that  Wolsey was ever put forward as a competitor. The cardinals would hear  nothing of a foreigner, and the stubbornness of Medici's party was at  length rewarded by his election. There is no trace that Wolsey was  keenly disappointed at this result. In announcing it to Henry VIII., he  wrote, \"For my part, as I take God to record, I am more joyous thereof  than if it had fortuned upon my person, knowing his excellent qualities  most meet for the same, and how great and sure a friend your Grace and  the Emperor be like to have of him, and I so good a father.\"    Few popes came to their office amid greater expectations, and few more  entirely disappointed them than did Guilio de' Medici. Clement VII.,  whose election Charles, Henry, and Wolsey united in greeting with joy,  suffered in a brief space entire humiliation at the hands of Charles,  caused the downfall of Wolsey, and drove Henry to sever the bond between  the English Church and the Holy See. It is impossible not to think how  different would have been the course of events if Wolsey had presided  over the destinies of the Church.           CHAPTER VII   RENEWAL OF PEACE   1523-1527      The events of the year 1523 had practically made an end of the imperial  alliance. Henry VIII. was not in a position to go to war again, and his  confidence in Charles V.'s good intentions towards him was dispelled.  Charles and Francis had had enough of war, and both of them secretly  desired peace, but neither would make the first move towards it. Wolsey  watched their movements keenly, and strove that English interests should  not be entirely sacrificed in the pacification which seemed imminent. He  strove to induce Charles to allow proposals of peace to proceed from  England, which should arbitrate on the differences between him and  Francis. He urged that in any negotiations which Charles himself  undertook he was bound to consider how Henry could be recompensed for  his losses. Moreover, he secretly opened up negotiations of his own with  the French Court, and used the imperial alliance as a means to heighten  England's value to France.    The more Wolsey watched events the more he became convinced that the  best thing was to make a separate peace with France, yet in such a way  as to avoid an open breach with the Emperor. There were other reasons  besides the failure of military expeditions, and the distrust in any  good result from their continuance, which impelled Wolsey to a pacific  policy. He knew only too well that war was impossible, and that the  country could not bear the continued drain on its resources. If Henry  VII. had developed the royal power by a parsimony which enabled him to  be free from parliamentary control, Henry VIII. had dazzled his people  by the splendour of royalty, and had displayed his magnificence to such  an extent that Englishmen were beginning to doubt if they could afford  much longer to be so important, or rather if England's importance in  Continental affairs were worth all the money that it cost. Of late years  the weight of taxation had become oppressive, and the expenses of the  last campaign were difficult to meet.    There was no difference between the national revenue and the royal  revenue in Wolsey's days. The king took all the money he could get, and  spent it as he thought good; if he went to war he expected his people to  pay for it. In an ordinary way the king was well provided for by his  feudal dues and the proceeds of customs, tonnage and poundage, and the  tax on wool, wool-fells, and leather. When extraordinary expenses were  incurred Parliament was summoned, and granted taxes to the king. Their  vote was reckoned on an old assessment of tenths and fifteenths of the  value of chattels possessed by the baronage and the commons; and when  Parliament made this grant the clergy in their convocation granted a  tenth of clerical incomes. The value of a tenth and fifteenth was  £30,000; of a clerical tenth £10,000; so that the usual grant in case of  an emergency amounted to £40,000 from the whole realm. For his  expedition of 1513 Henry obtained a vote of two tenths and fifteenths,  besides a subsidy of a graduated income and property tax which was  estimated to produce £160,000, and this had to be supplemented by a  further grant of tenths and fifteenths in 1515.    It was in 1515 that Wolsey became Chancellor, and with that office  assumed the entire responsibility for all affairs of state. He managed  to introduce some order into the finances, and during the years of  pacific diplomacy things went tolerably well. But the French expeditions  were costly, and in April 1523 Parliament had to be summoned to pay the  king's debts. The war against France was popular, and men were willing  to contribute.    So on 15th April Henry VIII. opened Parliament, and Tunstal, Bishop of  London, delivered the usual oration in praise of the king and grief over  the evils of the time. The Commons departed, and elected as their  Speaker Sir Thomas More, who had already abandoned the quiet paths of  literature for the stormy sea of politics. The king's assent was given  in the usual manner to his appointment, and the session was adjourned.  The Commons doubtless began to take financial matters under their  consideration, but it was thought desirable that they should have a  definite statement of the national needs. On 29th April Wolsey went to  the House, and after urging the importance of the interests at stake in  the war, proposed a subsidy of £800,000, to be raised according to an  old method, by a tax of four shillings in the pound on all goods and  lands. Next day there was much debate on this proposal; it was urged  that the sudden withdrawal of so large an amount of ready money would  seriously affect the currency, and was indeed almost impossible. A  committee was appointed to represent to Wolsey that this was the sense  of the House, and beg him to induce the king to moderate his demands.  Wolsey answered that he would rather have his tongue pulled out with  red-hot pincers than carry such a message to the king.    The Commons in a melancholy mood renewed their debate till Wolsey  entered the House and desired to reason with those who opposed his  demands. On this Sir Thomas More, as Speaker, defended the privilege of  the House by saying, \"That it was the order of that House to hear and  not to reason save among themselves.\" Whereupon Wolsey was obliged to  content himself with answering such objections as had come to his ear.  He argued, it would seem with vigour, that the country was much richer  than they thought, and he told them some unpleasant truths, which came  with ill grace from himself, about the prevalence of luxury. After his  departure the debate continued till the House agreed to grant two  shillings in the pound on all incomes of £20 a year and upwards; one  shilling on all between £20 and £2; and fourpence on all incomes under  £2; this payment to be extended over two years. This was increased by a  county member, who said, \"Let us gentlemen of £50 a year and upwards  give the king of our lands a shilling in the pound, to be paid in two  years.\" The borough members stood aloof, and allowed the landholders to  tax themselves an extra shilling in the pound if they chose to do so.  This was voted on 21st May, and Parliament was prorogued till 10th June.  Meanwhile popular feeling was greatly moved by rumours of an  unprecedented tax, and what was really done was grossly exaggerated on  all sides. As the members left the House an angry crowd greeted them  with jeers. \"We hear say that you will grant four shillings in"]]]
