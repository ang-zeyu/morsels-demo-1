I      stop with one sleeve off and one on to settle matters      with him. Having planted him bolt upright and gone all      up and down the chamber barefoot to get pillows and      blankets to prop him up, I finish putting my frock on      and hurry down to satisfy myself by actual observation      that the breakfast is in progress. Then back I come      into the nursery, where, remembering that it is washing      day and that there is a great deal of work to be done,      I apply myself vigorously to sweeping, dusting, and the      setting to rights so necessary where there are three      little mischiefs always pulling down as fast as one can      put up.        Then there are Miss H---- and Miss E----, concerning      whom Mary will furnish you with all suitable      particulars, who are chattering, hallooing, or singing      at the tops of their voices, as may suit their various      states of mind, while the nurse is getting their      breakfast ready. This meal being cleared away, Mr.      Stowe dispatched to market with various memoranda      of provisions, etc., and the baby being washed and      dressed, I begin to think what next must be done.      I start to cut out some little dresses, have just      calculated the length and got one breadth torn off when      Master Henry makes a doleful lip and falls to crying      with might and main. I catch him up and turning round      see one of his sisters flourishing the things out of      my workbox in fine style. Moving it away and looking      the other side I see the second little mischief seated      by the hearth chewing coals and scraping up ashes with      great apparent relish. Grandmother lays hold upon her      and charitably offers to endeavor to quiet baby while      I go on with my work. I set at it again, pick up a      dozen pieces, measure them once more to see which is      the right one, and proceed to cut out some others, when      I see the twins on the point of quarreling with each      other. Number one pushes number two over. Number two      screams: that frightens the baby and he joins in. I      call number one a naughty girl, take the persecuted one      in my arms, and endeavor to comfort her by trotting to      the old lyric:--        \"So ride the gentlefolk,       And so do we, so do we.\"        Meanwhile number one makes her way to the slop jar and      forthwith proceeds to wash her apron in it. Grandmother      catches her by one shoulder, drags her away, and sets      the jar up out of her reach. By and by the nurse comes      up from her sweeping. I commit the children to her, and      finish cutting out the frocks.        But let this suffice, for of such details as these are      all my days made up. Indeed, my dear, I am but a mere      drudge with few ideas beyond babies and housekeeping.      As for thoughts, reflections, and sentiments, good      lack! good lack!        I suppose I am a dolefully uninteresting person at      present, but I hope I shall grow young again one of      these days, for it seems to me that matters cannot      always stand exactly as they do now.        Well, Georgy, this marriage is--yes, I will speak well      of it, after all; for when I can stop and think long      enough to discriminate my head from my heels, I must      say that I think myself a fortunate woman both in      husband and children. My children I would not change      for all the ease, leisure, and pleasure that I could      have without them. They are money on interest whose      value will be constantly increasing.    In 1839 Mrs. Stowe received into her family as a servant a colored  girl from Kentucky. By the laws of Ohio she was free, having been  brought into the State and left there by her mistress. In spite of  this, Professor Stowe received word, after she had lived with them some  months, that the girl's master was in the city looking for her, and  that if she were not careful she would be seized and conveyed back into  slavery. Finding that this could be accomplished by boldness, perjury,  and the connivance of some unscrupulous justice, Professor Stowe  determined to remove the girl to some place of security where she might  remain until the search for her should be given up. Accordingly he and  his brother-in-law, Henry Ward Beecher, both armed, drove the fugitive,  in a covered wagon, at night, by unfrequented roads, twelve miles back  into the country, and left her in safety with the family of old John  Van Zandt, the fugitive's friend.    It is from this incident of real life and personal experience that Mrs.  Stowe conceived the thrilling episode of the fugitives' escape from Tom  Loker and Marks in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\"    An amusing and at the same time most interesting account of her  struggles to accomplish literary work amid her distracting domestic  duties at this time is furnished by the letter of one of her intimate  friends, who writes:--    \"It was my good fortune to number Mrs. Stowe among my friends, and  during a visit to her I had an opportunity one day of witnessing the  combined exercise of her literary and domestic genius in a style that  to me was quite amusing.    \"'Come Harriet,' said I, as I found her tending one baby and watching  two others just able to walk, 'where is that piece for the \"Souvenir\"  which I promised the editor I would get from you and send on next week?  You have only this one day left to finish it, and have it I must.'    \"'And how will you get it, friend of mine?' said Harriet. 'You will  at least have to wait till I get house-cleaning over and baby's teeth  through.'    \"'As to house-cleaning, you can defer it one day longer; and as to  baby's teeth, there is to be no end to them, as I can see. No, no;  to-day that story must be ended. There Frederick has been sitting by  Ellen and saying all those pretty things for more than a month now, and  she has been turning and blushing till I am sure it is time to go to  her relief. Come, it would not take you three hours at the rate you can  write to finish the courtship, marriage, catastrophe, eclaircissement,  and all; and this three hours' labor of your brains will earn enough to  pay for all the sewing your fingers could do for a year to come. Two  dollars a page, my dear, and you can write a page in fifteen minutes!  Come, then, my lady housekeeper, economy is a cardinal virtue; consider  the economy of the thing.'    \"'But, my dear, here is a baby in my arms and two little pussies by  my side, and there is a great baking down in the kitchen, and there  is a \"new girl\" for \"help,\" besides preparations to be made for  house-cleaning next week. It is really out of the question, you see.'    \"'I see no such thing. I do not know what genius is given for, if it  is not to help a woman out of a scrape. Come, set your wits to work,  let me have my way, and you shall have all the work done and finish the  story too.'    \"'Well, but kitchen affairs?'    \"'We can manage them too. You know you can write anywhere and anyhow.  Just take your seat at the kitchen table with your writing weapons, and  while you superintend Mina fill up the odd snatches of time with the  labors of your pen.'    \"I carried my point. In ten minutes she was seated; a table with flour,  rolling-pin, ginger, and lard on one side, a dresser with eggs, pork,  and beans and various cooking utensils on the other, near her an oven  heating, and beside her a dark-skinned nymph, waiting orders.    \"'Here, Harriet,' said I, 'you can write on this atlas in your lap; no  matter how the writing looks, I will copy it.'    \"'Well, well,' said she, with a resigned sort of amused look. 'Mina,  you may do what I told you, while I write a few minutes, till it is  time to mould up the bread. Where is the inkstand?'    \"'Here it is, close by, on the top of the tea-kettle,' said I.    \"At this Mina giggled, and we both laughed to see her merriment at our  literary proceedings.    \"I began to overhaul the portfolio to find the right sheet.    \"'Here it is,' said I. 'Here is Frederick sitting by Ellen, glancing at  her brilliant face, and saying something about \"guardian angel,\" and  all that--you remember?'    \"'Yes, yes,' said she, falling into a muse, as she attempted to recover  the thread of her story.    \"'Ma'am, shall I put the pork on the top of the beans?' asked Mina.    \"'Come, come,' said Harriet, laughing. 'You see how it is. Mina is a  new hand and cannot do anything without me to direct her. We must give  up the writing for to-day.'    \"'No, no; let us have another trial. You can dictate as easily as you  can write. Come, I can set the baby in this clothes-basket and give him  some mischief or other to keep him quiet; you shall dictate and I will  write. Now, this is the place where you left off: you were describing  the scene between Ellen and her lover; the last sentence was, \"Borne  down by the tide of agony, she leaned her head on her hands, the tears  streamed through her fingers, and her whole frame shook with convulsive  sobs.\" What shall I write next?'    \"'Mina, pour a little milk into this pearlash,' said Harriet.    \"'Come,' said I. '\"The tears streamed through her fingers and her whole  frame shook with convulsive sobs.\" What next?'    \"Harriet paused and looked musingly out of the window, as she turned  her mind to her story. 'You may write now,' said she, and she dictated  as follows:    \"'\"Her lover wept with her, nor dared he again to touch the point so  sacredly guarded\"--Mina, roll that crust a little thinner. \"He spoke in  soothing tones\"--Mina, poke the coals in the oven.'    \"'Here,' said I, 'let me direct Mina about these matters, and write a  while yourself.'    \"Harriet took the pen and patiently set herself to the work.

Passengers on the roof stood up to get a good view.  There was some cheering.    Psmith and Mike reached the tram ten yards to the good; and, if it had  been ready to start then, all would have been well. But Bill and his  friends had arrived while the driver and conductor were both out in the  road.    The affair now began to resemble the doings of Horatius on the bridge.  Psmith and Mike turned to bay on the platform at the foot of the tram  steps. Bill, leading by three yards, sprang on to it, grabbed Mike, and  fell with him on to the road. Psmith, descending with a dignity  somewhat lessened by the fact that his hat was on the side of his head,  was in time to engage the runners-up.    Psmith, as pugilist, lacked something of the calm majesty which  characterized him in the more peaceful moments of life, but he was  undoubtedly effective. Nature had given him an enormous reach and a  lightness on his feet remarkable in one of his size; and at some time  in his career he appeared to have learned how to use his hands. The  first of the three runners, the walking-stick manipulator, had the  misfortune to charge straight into the old Etonian's left. It was a  well-timed blow, and the force of it, added to the speed at which the  victim was running, sent him on to the pavement, where he spun round  and sat down. In the subsequent proceedings he took no part.    The other two attacked Psmith simultaneously, one on each side. In  doing so, the one on the left tripped over Mike and Bill, who were  still in the process of sorting themselves out, and fell, leaving  Psmith free to attend to the other. He was a tall, weedy youth. His  conspicuous features were a long nose and a light yellow waistcoat.  Psmith hit him on the former with his left and on the latter with his  right. The long youth emitted a gurgle, and collided with Bill, who had  wrenched himself free from Mike and staggered to his feet. Bill, having  received a second blow in the eye during the course of his interview on  the road with Mike, was not feeling himself. Mistaking the other for an  enemy, he proceeded to smite him in the parts about the jaw. He had  just upset him, when a stern official voice observed, ''Ere, now,  what's all this?'    There is no more unfailing corrective to a scene of strife than the  'What's all this?' of the London policeman. Bill abandoned his  intention of stamping on the prostrate one, and the latter, sitting up,  blinked and was silent.    'What's all this?' asked the policeman again. Psmith, adjusting his hat  at the correct angle again, undertook the explanations.    'A distressing scene, officer,' he said. 'A case of that unbridled  brawling which is, alas, but too common in our London streets. These  two, possibly till now the closest friends, fall out over some point,  probably of the most trivial nature, and what happens? They brawl.  They--'    'He 'it me,' said the long youth, dabbing at his face with a  handkerchief and pointing an accusing finger at Psmith, who regarded  him through his eyeglass with a look in which pity and censure were  nicely blended.    Bill, meanwhile, circling round restlessly, in the apparent hope of  getting past the Law and having another encounter with Mike, expressed  himself in a stream of language which drew stern reproof from the  shocked constable.    'You 'op it,' concluded the man in blue. 'That's what you do. You 'op  it.'    'I should,' said Psmith kindly. 'The officer is speaking in your best  interests. A man of taste and discernment, he knows what is best. His  advice is good, and should be followed.'    The constable seemed to notice Psmith for the first time. He turned and  stared at him. Psmith's praise had not had the effect of softening him.  His look was one of suspicion.    'And what might _you_ have been up to?' he inquired coldly. 'This  man says you hit him.'    Psmith waved the matter aside.    'Purely in self-defence,' he said, 'purely in self-defence. What else  could the man of spirit do? A mere tap to discourage an aggressive  movement.'    The policeman stood silent, weighing matters in the balance. He  produced a notebook and sucked his pencil. Then he called the conductor  of the tram as a witness.    'A brainy and admirable step,' said Psmith, approvingly. 'This rugged,  honest man, all unused to verbal subtleties, shall give us his plain  account of what happened. After which, as I presume this tram--little  as I know of the habits of trams--has got to go somewhere today, I  would suggest that we all separated and moved on.'    He took two half-crowns from his pocket, and began to clink them  meditatively together. A slight softening of the frigidity of the  constable's manner became noticeable. There was a milder beam in the  eyes which gazed into Psmith's.    Nor did the conductor seem altogether uninfluenced by the sight.    The conductor deposed that he had bin on the point of pushing on,  seeing as how he'd hung abart long enough, when he see'd them two  gents, the long 'un with the heye-glass (Psmith bowed) and t'other 'un,  a-legging of it dahn the road towards him, with the other blokes  pelting after 'em. He added that, when they reached the trem, the two  gents had got aboard, and was then set upon by the blokes. And after  that, he concluded, well, there was a bit of a scrap, and that's how it  was.    'Lucidly and excellently put,' said Psmith. 'That is just how it was.  Comrade Jackson, I fancy we leave the court without a stain on our  characters. We win through. Er--constable, we have given you a great  deal of trouble. Possibly--?'    'Thank you, sir.' There was a musical clinking. 'Now then, all of you,  you 'op it. You're all bin poking your noses in 'ere long enough. Pop  off. Get on with that tram, conductor.' Psmith and Mike settled  themselves in a seat on the roof. When the conductor came along, Psmith  gave him half a crown, and asked after his wife and the little ones at  home. The conductor thanked goodness that he was a bachelor, punched  the tickets, and retired.    'Subject for a historical picture,' said Psmith. 'Wounded leaving the  field after the Battle of Clapham Common. How are your injuries,  Comrade Jackson?'    'My back's hurting like blazes,' said Mike. 'And my ear's all sore  where that chap got me. Anything the matter with you?'    'Physically,' said Psmith, 'no. Spiritually much. Do you realize,  Comrade Jackson, the thing that has happened? I am riding in a tram. I,  Psmith, have paid a penny for a ticket on a tram. If this should get  about the clubs! I tell you, Comrade Jackson, no such crisis has ever  occurred before in the course of my career.'    'You can always get off, you know,' said Mike.    'He thinks of everything,' said Psmith, admiringly. 'You have touched  the spot with an unerring finger. Let us descend. I observe in the  distance a cab. That looks to me more the sort of thing we want. Let us  go and parley with the driver.'          17. Sunday Supper      The cab took them back to the flat, at considerable expense, and Psmith  requested Mike to make tea, a performance in which he himself was  interested purely as a spectator. He had views on the subject of  tea-making which he liked to expound from an armchair or sofa, but he  never got further than this. Mike, his back throbbing dully from the  blow he had received, and feeling more than a little sore all over,  prepared the Etna, fetched the milk, and finally produced the finished  article.    Psmith sipped meditatively.    'How pleasant,' he said, 'after strife is rest. We shouldn't have  appreciated this simple cup of tea had our sensibilities remained  unstirred this afternoon. We can now sit at our ease, like warriors  after the fray, till the time comes for setting out to Comrade Waller's  once more.'    Mike looked up.    'What! You don't mean to say you're going to sweat out to Clapham  again?'    'Undoubtedly. Comrade Waller is expecting us to supper.'    'What absolute rot! We can't fag back there.'    'Noblesse oblige. The cry has gone round the Waller household, \"Jackson  and Psmith are coming to supper,\" and we cannot disappoint them now.  Already the fatted blanc-mange has been killed, and the table creaks  beneath what's left of the midday beef. We must be there; besides,  don't you want to see how the poor man is? Probably we shall find him  in the act of emitting his last breath. I expect he was lynched by the  enthusiastic mob.'    'Not much,' grinned Mike. 'They were too busy with us. All right, I'll  come if you really want me to, but it's awful rot.'    One of the many things Mike could never understand in Psmith was his  fondness for getting into atmospheres that were not his own. He would  go out of his way to do this. Mike, like most boys of his age, was  never really happy and at his ease except in the presence of those of  his own years and class. Psmith, on the contrary, seemed to be bored by  them, and infinitely preferred talking to somebody who lived in quite  another world. Mike was not a snob. He simply had not the ability to be  at his ease with people in another class from his own. He did not know  what to talk to them about, unless they were cricket professionals.  With them he was never at a loss.    But Psmith was different. He could get on with anyone. He seemed to  have the gift of entering into their minds and seeing things from their  point of view.    As regarded Mr Waller, Mike liked him personally, and was prepared, as  we have seen, to undertake considerable risks in his defence; but he  loathed with all his heart and soul the idea of supper at his house. He  knew that he would have"]]]
