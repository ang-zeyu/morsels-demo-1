Gray was bidding good-bye to Wastralls, at least for a  time; and the green box she had brought with her had been packed ready  for him to fetch away. For immediate necessities however she was taking  with her a brown leathern bag, which had been given her by her aunt and  which bore the initials G.R., initials Gray was never to change.    In an otherwise empty drawer lay a little pile of garments of superfine  quality and workmanship; and for these, after cleansing herself from the  stains of butter-making and household work, the girl exchanged her  everyday clothes.  Jim had made her a moleskin cap and necklet and in  the latter, she pinned the little bunch of violets.    \"It don't seem hardly possible!\" she said dreamily, on her return to the  kitchen, where Mrs. Byron was kneading the dough.    Memory carried the older woman back to a like day in her own life.  \"Well, my dear,\" she said, from the other side of Time's river, \"you'll  know all about'n by to-morrow.\"  She contemplated the blushing girl for  a moment then turned to practical matters.  \"Did you think about  bringin' out the list for groceries?\"    \"Never thought nothing about it.\"  She ran off, returning with a  blue-lined page, torn from a penny account book.    \"Whatever you do, don't 'ee forget yer uncle's pipe.\"    No man shall instruct deaf ears or open the eyes of the blind.  Already  Sabina's optimism was reasserting itself.  She had exaggerated the  import of her husband's look.  Leadville, poor chap, had been  disappointed and had shown it.  No need for her to make 'the worst of a  bad bargain.'    Christmas is a time of good-will and Christmas was coming.  She had  noticed he was in need of a new pipe and who knew whether such an  offering might not prove a milestone on the difficult road to  reconciliation?    \"No, I won't forget,\" said Gray, who saw the commission as yet another  instance of nobility exercised towards the entirely undeserving.  She  kissed her aunt warmly.  \"You are a darlin',\" she said.  \"I feel awful  to leave you to do all this work,\" she glanced from the dough to the  bread-tins, \"I can't bear going.\"    \"Well, my dear,\" Sabina felt the pleasantness of this young and partisan  affection, \"'tis only for a little while.  Richbell will do so well as  she can.\"    \"Richbell'll never think to make your cocoa of a night or to get your  hot-bottle and make you comfortable.\"    \"Please God, I'll 'av you back again soon.  Now you go on and be 'appy  and don't you think about me.  I shall be all right.  There--\" she  glanced through the diamond panes of the window, \"the mare's being  tackled up, make haste.\"    A slight frost had hardened the mud of the yard and above St. Cadic Mill  the December sun had risen into a sky of little far-off clouds.  Between  the shafts of the wagon stood Lady, the young mare, glad to exchange the  warm dark stable for the adventure of the public road.  Jim Rosevear, in  well-brushed clothes and with a tie that matched the blue of his eyes,  was fastening the last buckle as Gray came out, with a basket of eggs  and butter in one hand and her bag in the other.  A larger basket,  containing poultry, was already in place and, beside it, lay a piece of  broken mechanism which was to be left at the smithy.  As the girlish  figure stepped out of the dark house Leadville, who, with frowning brow,  had been watching the preparations, came forward. Gray had a momentary  qualm; but saw with relief that he had not made any change in his dress.  In old clothes and without a collar even Leadville, though he set many  conventions at defiance, would not think of going to Stowe.    \"Hullo!\" said he, \"what be yer gwine do wi' that bag?\"    \"I'm going to stay home to-night.\"    \"'Ome?  This is yer 'ome 'ere.\"    \"Well, I'm going to stay to mammy's for a change,\" she spoke lightly,  willing to placate him and hasten her escape.    \"I think you ought to 'av ask me if you can stay 'ome or no.\"  He had  stepped between her and the wagon; and his eyes had the smouldering  light which she had learnt to dread.    With her heart fluttering, she controlled her voice to a pleasant,  \"Well, what is there to hinder me?\"    Her docility appeased him.  After all she was only going to the butter  market.    \"Well, can I?  Can I stay to mammy's?\" asked the singing voice with its  rising inflexion on the last word.    \"I s'pose you can,\" he said reluctantly.  \"You can go if you'm a good  maid and bring me back something.\"    \"I'll bring you back something that'll surprise you,\" promised Gray, her  eyes soft and smiling, but an edge of malice under her tongue.    He towered over her, ardent and dominating.  \"There's only one thing I  want and that you know.\"    She knew and was both angered and afraid.  In vain she tried to think of  Leadville as wicked, for her he was worse than that, he was terrifying.  She did not know what he might do, whether there was any limit.    Jim having finished harnessing the mare, came up on the other side of  the wagon.  Gray, glancing aside from her tormentor, saw his courageous  eyes and took heart of grace.  She had a protector and this was the last  time, the very last, that she would be at Leadville's mercy.    \"Come now, Uncle Leadville,\" she said and her young voice, carrying  across the wagon, dissipated an incipient jealousy, \"I want to be gone.\"    He drew back as if he had received a blow and, in a moment, the girl was  climbing nimbly to her place on a bag of chaff which Jim had placed  ready.  As she turned, a little anxious as to the effect of her words,  but glad on any terms to have got away, she was met by a black scowl of  wrath.  \"Mind I never 'ear yer call me that again.\"    With a graceful swing, Jim sprang on to the rail of the wagon and the  mare, fresh from her oats, began to move.  Gray, secure at last, looked  down on Byron with an air of innocent inquiry and the lad beside her  smiled. For some time he had had a suspicion that the other was more  attentive to her than became a married man; and this suspicion had  stimulated a wooing which might otherwise have seemed too tame.    As the wagon wheels turned, Leadville perforce gave way, but  unwillingly, for in his heart was suspicion, a fear of all men, a  shaking terror lest one should have been before him.  The memory of her  supple yielding form yet thrilled him with its promise.  For a moment  she had abandoned herself and though she had drawn away at once the  yielding had betrayed her.  Gray was no longer a chrysalis of cool dim  life and unfolded wings. Emotion was quick in her, she was ready for  full experiences, the blue sun-warmed air and the flight.  Instinct,  teaching Leadville she was no unawakened maid, was brought up short by  the word she had flung at him. Uncle?  What did it mean?  Had some  younger man dared to approach her?  Had she listened, listened because  he was the first and young love is sweet?  Was there some light fancy  that must be extinguished before she could be wholly his?  Surely not.  Surely she had meant to mark the gulf between herself and Sabina's  husband, to point out to him that he was married.  The theory explained  her momentary yielding, her quick withdrawal, her words.  He smiled to  himself.  If Gray imagined that, because long ago he had gone through a  form of words with another woman, they were to bind him now that for the  first time in his life he loved with passion, she should learn that she  was mistaken.  As soon as she returned to Wastralls, he would show her  in what estimation he held the worn unwelcome bond.    From the low window of the kitchen Mrs. Byron had watched the scene.  Jim's handsome head had been bent over the mare's shiny coat as he  thrust the tongues of the buckles through the brass.  He moved easily  and well, for life had not yet taken advantage of his strength and she  saw him as a proper lad.  When Gray came out, Mrs. Byron felt a motherly  pride in the little rounded figure, the soft fair face between the furs  of cap and necklet.  \"An' she've pinned they vi'lets on, trust her for  that.\"    Leadville's appearance cast a shadow on the scene. In the bright winter  sunshine he loomed up, a threatening unhappy figure, the incarnation of  a desire which might not be gratified.  The light fell on his uncovered  head with its thick black hair, on his muscular figure, growing heavy  with years but still a wonder for its strength, on his eager face.  Sabina, in a reaction from the blow she had received, felt that the time  was come for her to assert herself.  Anxious not to drive him farther  away she had played a gentle self-obliterating part and she felt that in  doing so she had made a mistake.  She would grasp her nettle more  firmly, let him know that Gray was bespoken.  Conscious, as she went, of  envy, she began to push herself towards the porch.  What a thing it was  to have an old body, a body that had 'gone abroad' and a young heart!  Jim and Leadville hung about Gray with the same hope.  Sabina, for all  her vitality and strength, had no longer anything to give. She was old  and done, while Gray, to them and every man, was incarnate promise.    The wagon was turning out of the gate as Mrs. Byron reached her  husband's side and the off-wheel rose over a stone.  The body of the  cart swayed and lurched and Gray, with a little cry, caught at Jim  Rosevear's arm.    Byron swore fiercely.  \"If anything 'appen to her I'll wring his neck.\"    \"You needn' fear.  He'll take care of she.\"    The man turned and stared at the distorted figure in the cone of  basket-work.  He had not heard her come up but his mind was too deeply  occupied with other matters for him to be startled.  \"Why?\"    \"Because they'm courtin'.\"    She had thought it would be difficult to tell him but the words sprang  out of her resentment at the way in which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],[0,"Star of India (#17)"],[1,"eyes, and no trace of \"airs\" in his bearing, unless a  certain well-bred self-confidence could be imputed to conceit.    Philip Flint was taken aback in his turn. If he had thought about his  chief's wife at all, save as a personage to be called upon without delay  as in duty bound, he had certainly foreseen an amiable, middle-aged  memsahib who would perhaps rescue him good-naturedly from the  discomforts of the Government rest house until he could find suitable  quarters for himself. Here, instead, was one of the prettiest girls he  had ever beheld, incredibly young, unless indeed she was the daughter,  not the wife, of the Commissioner.    As he entered she was standing in the centre of the big room, a slim,  white-gowned figure beneath the slow-swaying punkah, and its movement  stirred gently the bright little curls on her forehead--adorable curls.  And what eyes, with thick, feathery lashes upcurved at the tips. Great  Cæsar! what luck, after all, that Rassih should have been his portion.  And to think how he had grumbled at the prospect of such exile even for  a few months!    \"Miss Crayfield?\" he said tentatively, and at the same moment he caught  sight of her wedding ring, the only ring she was wearing. \"I  mean\"--correcting himself hastily, with a sense of acute  disappointment--\"Mrs. Crayfield.\" Solemnly they shook hands. Then their  eyes met and they both laughed. That mutual, spontaneous laughter sealed  an instinctive friendship. Stella waved him to a chair and took one  herself. Previous to his arrival she had been feeling so languid, so  dull; now everything was different; the very atmosphere became cheerful,  the heat less oppressive.    \"You must forgive my mistake,\" he said, and his blue eyes twinkled, \"but  it was your fault. You don't look quite like a Mrs. Commissioner, at  least, not the kind I am accustomed to.\"    \"Oh, you're not the first person to reproach me for being young,\" Stella  told him, thinking of Mrs. Cuthell. \"I really shall have to do something  if the hot weather refuses to turn my hair grey.\"    \"What did the other people say?\" he inquired lightly, though in truth he  felt curious to know if these same other people had been men who, like  himself, were nonplussed by the sight of her beauty and youth.    \"Nothing at all nice, so perhaps we'd better talk about something else.  Tell me, what do you think of Rassih?\"    \"Until this morning I thought it a God-forsaken hole!\"    She blushed, divining the bold insinuation. He watched the bright  colour creep into her cheeks, delighting in her moment of embarrassment.  Then he came to her aid with commonplace remarks as to the climate, the  surroundings, the new railway line.    \"It doesn't strike a new-comer as a tempting spot, but it must be  interesting for anyone with a weakness for Indian history.\"    \"Oh, _don't_ begin about the mutiny and this dreadful old house!\"  protested Stella.    He glanced at her, puzzled. \"But I wasn't thinking so much of the  mutiny. Did you never hear of George Thomas?\"    \"George Thomas! Who was he?\"    \"One of the old military adventurers who paved the way for the British  occupation of India. He very nearly conquered the Punjab, and  established himself in this district, coining his own rupees, and  manufacturing his own arms and ammunition, and he was always for his  King and country. But he failed, beaten by the French under Perron, and  through treachery among his native followers; also partly, I'm afraid,  because at critical moments he was generally drunk!\"    \"Oh, poor dear!\" Stella's eyes shone with interest. \"And what happened  to him?\"    \"He died on his way down country with his wife and family,  broken-hearted, more or less a fugitive, but still, it is said, having  certain possessions in the shape of money and jewels and shawls. His  tomb has never been found, nor is it known what became of his  descendants. I often wonder if any of them are living to-day. There is  a story that on one occasion, when he was looking at a map of India, in  which British territory was then, as now, coloured red, he ran his hand  over the whole of the map and said, 'All this ought to be red.' That was  the real spirit of his ambitions. I'll lend you a book about him if you  like.\"    \"_Like!_ Please let me have it to-day--to-morrow.\"    He laughed at her enthusiasm. \"Very well, directly my things are  unpacked. His career would make a fine subject for a romance.\"    \"Why don't you write it?\"    He paused reflectively.    \"_Are_ you writing it? Do tell me,\" urged Stella.    \"No, but I should like to try. Will you help me?\"    \"How on earth could _I_ help you?\"    \"By allowing me to read you my efforts as they go along. There is  nothing so stimulating to a would-be author as a long-suffering  listener.\"    Wily Philip Ferguson Flint! Mentally he congratulated himself on having  hit on a subtle device whereby he might secure a delightful intimacy  with this captivating young person. He pictured long hours alone in her  company countenanced by a reasonable excuse. The romance should be  started immediately. Blessings on the memory of poor, stout-hearted,  tipsy George Thomas!    \"I should be only too delighted. There would be nothing long-suffering  about it.\" Then doubt crept into her mind as to how Robert would regard  such a plan. Probably he would grudge her this pleasure as he grudged  her all others, with the exception of riding and petty occupations.  Well, if he did she must contrive to hoodwink him somehow. For this  morning at least she could enjoy Mr. Flint's society. He seemed in no  hurry to go, and she told him all about the Carringtons, and her regret  that, being a girl, she could not follow in their footsteps; confided to  him how she had craved to reach India, disclosed, perhaps unconsciously,  the vague dissatisfaction she felt with her daily life now that her wish  was accomplished.    \"Why did _you_ choose to come to India?\" she asked him with frank  curiosity, and was thrilled sympathetically when he told her that he too  had been born with an hereditary call in his blood for the East.    \"I come of an old Anglo-Indian stock myself. I'm the fifth generation of  my family to serve the Indian Government. It seemed somehow inevitable  that I should come out here. I passed high enough for the English Civil,  but I chose India without hesitation. Apart from family links with the  country, I didn't fancy being mewed up in an office from morning till  night, with little prospect of getting to the top of the ladder, and not  enough money for sport and the kind of amusements I like. Dances and  dinners and tea-parties are not in my line. Out here I can afford a good  horse and unlimited cartridges, and I know I can be useful to India in  my small way. I mean to end up with a Lieutenant-Governorship at least.\"    \"You are very ambitious,\" exclaimed Stella; but it was as if she cried  \"Hear, hear.\"    \"Call it a passion for success,\" he said, smiling; and Stella felt that  deep determination lay beneath the smile and in his nature, and with her  whole being she applauded his aspirations.    \"You will get the Star of India,\" she said, hardly knowing why the  particular reward should suddenly have recurred to her.    \"A star worth striving for,\" he said seriously, \"even if it should burn  one's wings.\"    \"Oh, how I envy you!\" Tears rose to her eyes. \"And I, who love India  too, can do nothing--can never be useful!\"    \"Who knows? Your chance may come.\"    \"If it does you may be sure I shall take it.\" Just then Stella looked  up, to see Sher Singh standing in the doorway, and she realised that for  the last few moments the man had been coughing gently to attract her  attention. Was she never to be free from this perpetual spying and  watching?    \"What is it?\" she asked impatiently in Hindustani.    \"Your highness\"--with a low salaam--\"the sahib has sent a message. Will  Fer-lint Sahib go to the office? The Commissioner-Sahib desires his  presence.\"    Mr. Flint rose. \"Well, good-bye, Mrs. Crayfield. Needs must when  official devildom drives. I will tell you when the George Thomas romance  is well started.\"    \"Don't forget the book about him you promised to lend me,\" said Stella  eagerly. But when he had gone she gave herself over to a frenzy of  suspicion. Had Sher Singh told Robert that she was laughing and talking  with \"Fer-lint Sahib\"? and had the message been sent with a purpose? She  dreaded yet looked for Robert's return, so that she might know where she  stood in regard to Mr. Flint's visit. Perhaps it was all her  imagination. The summons might have been perfectly free from intrigue on  the part of Sher Singh; yet she was uneasy, and she wandered from room  to room, a victim to apprehension, her condition aggravated by the  knowledge that she had found such pleasure in this new friendship,  fearful as she was that it might be denied her.    To her astonished relief, when Robert appeared for the midday breakfast  he was accompanied by Mr. Flint, and the two seemed already to be on  excellent terms.    \"I've persuaded Mr. Flint to join us at breakfast,\" Robert explained to  her pompously; but after this he took no notice of his wife, talking  \"shop\" persistently with his new subordinate--all about revenue, and  boundaries, and agricultural prospects, of the danger of famine should  the monsoon fail or be fatally late. Stella listened with interest,  though perforce she was excluded from the conversation, and  instinctively she understood why Mr. Flint made no attempt to draw her  into it. Mr. Flint was setting himself to please his superior, for which  intention she felt thankful to him; also she was dimly aware that his  object was two-fold, that he meant to make friends with Robert in order  that he might the more easily be permitted to make friends with her. She  effaced herself purposely, and welcomed the sudden intrusion of an  excited fox terrier, who rushed into the room"]]]
