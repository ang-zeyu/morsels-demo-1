And then in this graveyard stood  the church,--an imposing church, I can assure you, with a vault upon  which hell was faithfully represented on one side and heaven on  the other. Near our window there was also a great fir, which was  worth a whole forest in itself, and which sheltered a formidable  number of crows. If, however, in spite of this double attraction one  found no pleasure in contemplating the view from that side, we had  another façade to resort to,--a façade opening upon an immense and  magnificent garden. There you might have looked down upon a patch  of cabbage, a patch of French beans, of peas, of carrots, and of  potatoes. We had flowers too,--so many flowers, so many vegetables,  and so much fruit, that we made gratuitous distributions of them  every Sunday. Besides our apple-trees, the branches of which bent  under the weight of the fruit, we had pear-trees, cherry-trees, and  plum-trees. My father, who had travelled considerably, particularly  through the South, prided himself upon his enterprising spirit. Every  year when the plums had been picked, he collected them in great  piles; from these piles the best were chosen, put upon a species of  riddles, and the riddles were laid in the sun. This was with a view  to making prunes. The plums rotted in a few days; the birds and other  animals ate them; and soon there was nothing left but the stones.  These were then thrown into the street, where we used to pick them  up, in order to make piles and stick a little flag in the top. The  next year my father proceeded to make prunes in precisely the same  manner.    We were very proud of our rose-bushes, which furnished roses for  the altars, and of our apple-trees, from which we obtained a most  excellent cider. We had our wine-press, our kneading-trough, our  oven, and our laundrying basins. We had pastures for our cows,  wheat-fields, fields of buckwheat and of rye. We sowed just enough  to supply our wants. There was no mill in our village, so we were  compelled to send our grain to Pontécouvrant. When it was ground, it  was brought back and made into very good rye bread for our daily use.  We also made a great loaf of wheat bread once a week, which we used  for the soup.    Every morning my father started out, gun on shoulder,--for in those  days there were no rural constables nor gendarmes (the gendarmes were  at Plumelec), and one could hunt all the year round. He came in at  noon for dinner, and at six o'clock for supper. My greatest delight  consisted in running to meet him and looking into his game-bag. I  never found any game in it, but it often contained a big trout or  some fine eels. We eventually discovered that the hunt was a mere  pretext, and that his real passion was fishing. He was extremely  taciturn, as all of his children have been after him, and I believe  that to be one of the essential qualities of an angler.    During dinner he never breathed a word. In the evening at supper he  described the events of the day, when he had been lucky. We took  our meals in the kitchen, which was vast and cleanly. There were  twenty of us at table, and sometimes more, owing to the legendary  Breton hospitality. The table formed a long rectangle. My mother  occupied one end of it with my sisters and myself; my father sat at  the other end alone; while the two long sides were reserved for the  servants. These were no less than twelve in number: the gardener,  the ploughman, the shepherd, the stable-boy, and the maid-servants.  This will no doubt give you the impression of the household of a  wealthy farmer or a country gentleman. Not at all. In the beautiful  borough of St. Jean Brévelay there was neither butcher, baker, nor  grocer. The only merchants that I ever saw there were a mercer and  a tavern-keeper. One was compelled to send to Vannes, seven leagues  away, for everything, or else live like Robinson Crusoe on his island.    I have learned since that the ploughman, who was our first man,  earned only thirty francs a year. I leave you to judge of the rest.  It was a poor country, and one could enjoy all the comforts which it  afforded with an income of twelve hundred francs a year. One of our  chief pleasures consisted in the care of our garden. My mother had  a little bed in which roses, tulips, pansies, and daisies grew in  abundance. She was particularly fond of mignonette and honey-suckle.  The hedge around our kitchen-garden was covered with honey-suckle,  elder, and a whole family of sweet-smelling creepers, over which  our bees hovered and buzzed. There was seldom a day when we did not  walk around the garden once, and that was quite a journey. We had  another habit which I do not understand as well, and which consisted  in walking around Colas' field every day after dinner; that is, at  one o'clock. We first went down a hollow road where the mud was not  wanting when it had rained. The flowers were not wanting there either  in summer; we walked under a real vault of them. This road led to the  blacksmith's shop, where I always found something to admire,--the  great bellows, the incandescent iron, the sparks flying from the  furnace like joyous fireworks. Next to the blacksmith's shop stood  Marion's house,--the last house at the end of the village. Marion  was a girl of twenty who had lost her mother when she was eighteen.  Everybody had advised her to go into service; but she had preferred  to engage herself to my mother as a seamstress, by the year. Her  house--\"Marion's house,\" as it was always spoken of--belonged to  her. It was not a great dowry. It consisted of two rooms under a  thatched roof, and a little yard where she raised her chickens. She  had been warned against the dangers of living alone at her age, and  in a comparatively isolated place; but she was a fearless girl and  somewhat unsociable. She had discovered, I do not know where,--in one  of the neighboring farms, perhaps,--a widow who was only too happy to  occupy one of her rooms gratuitously, and who was a companion and a  protection to her when she came home after her day's work.    Colas' field began at Marion's door. It was surely not what one would  call beautiful. We walked straight before us, and got back to our  starting-point at the end of an hour without having seen anything  but apple-trees and furrows. On Sunday when this task had been  accomplished, we found Marion in her yard among her chickens, waiting  to go to vespers with us. I always took her hand, and she told me  stories of Poulpiquets.    I led a joyful life. My mother, too, seemed happy. Her chief  occupation lay in nursing the sick, and her heaviest expense in  providing them with broth and drugs; the latter were sent for to  the druggist's at Bignan. I had never seen a doctor until I went  to Lorient to enter school. Whenever she had a perplexing case,  she called my father into consultation. As he had been a soldier,  nothing surprised him. His method was to bleed. He one day undertook  to vaccinate the entire population, and succeeded in doing so by  offering five cents to all those who consented to honor him with  their trust. This philanthropic operation must have made a great hole  in the household budget.    We had a library which contained fully twenty volumes. My sisters  spent their time in taking them from my mother's room, and my mother  in taking them from their hands. There were,--\"Celina, or, The  Child of Mystery and of Love;\" \"Alexis, or, The Wooden Cottage;\"  \"The Helmet and the Square Cap, or, Both suited him.\" We also had,  \"The Evenings at the Château,\" by Madame de Genlis, \"The Yellow  Tales,\" and \"Robinson Crusoe.\" I was of course not permitted to  touch the novels. I was allowed \"Robinson Crusoe,\" \"The Yellow  Tales,\" and \"The Evenings at the Château,\" of which permission I  availed myself eagerly, for I was ever a great reader. \"Robinson  Crusoe\" particularly delighted me, and I read it three or four times  a year. I had also a tender feeling for \"Celina,\" which I only  half understood. In the first place, it represented the forbidden  fruit; and in the next place, it had pictures. I never got to the  _dénouement_, because my mother, seeing that I was incorrigible,  resolved to burn the _cuerpo del delito_.    If I add that in rummaging through the closets and wardrobes I had  found \"L'Esprit des Lois\" and an odd volume of the \"Political and  Philosophical History of the Two Indies,\" and that I read them, you  will no doubt believe that I am trying to make myself out an infant  prodigy. It was quite the reverse, for I preferred the Abbé Raynal to  Montesquieu, and what I was most charmed with in the Abbé Raynal was  some absurd rant about a mistress called Catchinka, whom he had lost,  and who in some remarkable way formed a part of the Philosophical  History of the Two Indies. This strange library produced a veritable  chaos in my poor little brain, over which floated \"Robinson.\" It was  the genuine \"Robinson\" too,--a translation of the work of Daniel  Defoe, which, as every one knows, contains as many sermons as it does  events.    But what I liked better than \"Robinson,\" better than \"Celina,\" better  than my garden, better than the eternal walks around Colas' field,  was the church service on religious holidays, the \"pompous grandeur  of its ceremonies.\" Yes, the \"pompous grandeur,\"--I will not retract.  Since then I have seen St. Peter's, the cathedrals of Cologne and  Toledo, and, I believe, all the finest churches in the world; yet I  never attended service anywhere without recalling the poor little  church of St. Jean Brévelay. The difference between the palace of a  king and the thatched cottage of a peasant is far greater than that  between the august basilica and the poor little tottering chapel of  a Breton village.

Isn't that dreadful? The blessed Saver shield ye from it,  darlint, any how.\"    \"And to think that your own folly had placed you in such,\" I observed,  not minding nurse.    \"Then I am quite sure,\" said Miss Vernon, \"that a steadfast resignation  to what you brought on yourself, an unmurmuring struggle to retrieve,  would work its own cure; there is so much strength in perfect  submission!\"    \"Ay, for woman.\"    \"And for man too; how can your boldness and wisdom guard against the  future any more than our dependence? we can only use the present to the  best of our abilities, and leave the rest to God.\"    I remained silently pondering over her words, while she turned to  Nurse.--\"Dear Nurse, I forgot, indeed, what real poverty was as I  spoke; many a one is sinking in such a struggle as you describe, I  fear; still there's rest before them.\"    \"Thrue for ye, the Heavens be their bed! Amen.\"    \"How did we come to scare ourselves with such gloomy thoughts, Captain  Egerton? Let us enjoy this lovely day, and leave the sorrows we cannot  remove in better hands. There is the keeper's cottage; will you sit  here until we have spoken to his daughter? we will not be long.\"    A young woman, supporting a sickly-looking child, appeared in the  porch; a tolerably long conference ensued. Nurse opened the basket,  the contents of which were received with great pleasure, and the pale  boy tried to climb into Kate's arms; she sat down and spoke to him  with a smile, to which he responded, as if glad to be with her. Cormac  sat gravely by me, making some advances towards greater intimacy in a  dignified way.    I see the whole picture before me even now; the keeper's pretty  cottage, with the rich back ground of autumnal trees, the rustic porch,  Nurse and the girl emptying the basket, and Miss Vernon, her shawl  falling off one shoulder, bending over the child, who looked up at her  with a sort of half wondering, half pleased expression.    At length the visit was over, Kate put down the child; and followed for  a few steps by its curtseying attendant, rejoined me; Cormac rose as if  his responsibility was at an end, and we turned towards home.    Dismissing all the gloomy forebodings Miss Vernon's words had conjured  up, I determined to do away with any evil impression my observations  might have created, and our walk back was a \"right _merrie_\" one. Mrs.  O'Toole, throwing in from time to time her shrewd caustic remarks, and  Kate's sweet joyous laugh, rousing the echoes from their slumbers; many  a half forgotten incident of our former acquaintance was recalled, and  Nurse's reminiscences of our exploits, when I used occasionally to join  her nursling in a game of romps, called up many a smile on my side, and  a few blushes on that of Miss Vernon.    We could perceive the Colonel on the look out for us, when we reached  the top of the bank. Mrs. O'Toole having satisfied herself that David  Jones had taken more than the ghost of a throut, hurried forward to  exercise her skill on the fruit of his labours, leaving the garden gate  open for our more tardy approach. The Colonel received me with his  accustomed polished kindness; Nurse surpassed herself in the exquisite  dressing of the trout; Gilpin dropped in to tea, joined in praising my  sketches, sang a duet with Kate, and played some beautiful airs, while  the Colonel was beating me in three consecutive games of chess. The  three succeeding days winged themselves away with wonderful rapidity; I  sketched and argued with Winter; prescribed for his wife's pug dog, who  was affected with the snuffles; and lounged in and out of the Priory,  as if I was one of its rightful inmates. What pleasant mornings they  were! sometimes reading aloud to the Colonel and his granddaughter;  sometimes assisting the latter in the garden; occasionally learning  the second in a duet, and getting a scolding for inattention; while  Miss Vernon pursued her usual avocations of work or writing, or obeyed  Nurse's summons to disentangle accounts, or consult about dinner,  in the same easy unembarrassed manner, I have before endeavoured to  describe; always real, always earnest, her every occupation seemed  graceful and suitable; and the calm continuance of her usual routine,  completely removed the uncomfortable idea of being in the way, which  more ceremonious attention would have conveyed.    How dangerous all this! how thoroughly I felt my heart imbued with  the sweet homelike influence of this every day companionship, yet I  was astonishingly prudent, not altogether in consequence of Burton's  admonitions; I dreaded to break the repose of our intercourse,  and more than all, the frankness and friendliness of Miss Vernon's  manner, opposed a stronger barrier to the least approach to \"love  making,\" than the stiffest prudery that ever was inculcated in a  first-rate establishment for young ladies. Once, and only once, when  some expression of the irrepressible tenderness and admiration I felt  growing on me, escaped my lips almost unconsciously, Miss Vernon  blushed and started, as if some sudden revelation had flashed across  her mind, and, for a moment looked grave, almost displeased, but the  next instant, apparently dismissing whatever thought had disturbed her,  she was her own unembarrassed self again.    The Saturday after my return to A---- was Miss Vernon's birthday, and  Winter surprised her with an admirably painted and life-like likeness  of her grandfather.    The delight of Kate, the exclamations of Nurse, the enjoyment of  Winter, may be imagined; the whole party, including Gilpin, assisted  at its formal induction in the place of honour over the mantel-piece,  _vice_ John Anderson transferred to a position at the end of the room,  Kate professing a great regard for the print; I distinguished myself on  the occasion by my skilful picture-hanging, Mrs. O'Toole holding the  ladder, on which I mounted to perform the service.    We had a very merry party at dinner, and drank Miss Vernon's health,  and everybody's health.    I proposed Mrs. O'Toole's in an eloquent oration, to which she (having  been called in to honour the toast of the evening) replied, \"Success to  ye Captin, musha, but ye'r a grate spaker entirely. Here's your health,  Miss Kate, and blessins on ye, me darlin; more power to the masther,  and long may he reign over us, I pray God.\"    Before we separated Winter proposed a sketching expedition to a ruin  of much beauty and some interest, about eight miles from A----, and  Miss Vernon suggested a pic nic to include the party there assembled.  \"We can hire Edward's phaeton, and Mr. Winter is independent of livery  stables; Cyclops will no doubt leave us far behind, but we will  endeavour to come in for the fragments of the feast.\"    \"If you promise to behave yourself,\" replied he, \"I'll give you a seat  in my buggy.\"    \"Suppose, my dear,\" said Mrs. Winter, \"we were to take tea at the farm,  on our return; it is about half way?\"    \"Thank you, my dear, an excellent idea.\"    \"A delightful suggestion, Mrs. Winter,\" said Miss Vernon.    \"Then the programme is,\" said Winter, \"an early drive over to Mowbray  Castle, a good morning's work there; dinner at two o'clock and tea at  five, and syllabubs at the farm.\"    \"An admirable plan,\" observed the Colonel.    \"There is nothing I like better than a real impromptu pic nic,\" I  observed.    \"And, Mrs. Winter, the gentlemen must not be too _exigeants_,\" said  Miss Vernon, \"but be content with what our larders afford; there will  be no time for preparation.\"    \"Content!\" cried I.    \"Oh! we all know you would rather prefer a few herbs with water from  the neighbouring spring,\" said Miss Vernon archly.    A few more words as to the hour of starting and place of rendezvous,  which was to be at the Priory, as it was on the road to the Ruins, and  we exchanged good nights.    What a contrast Sunday at A---- presented to almost every other Sunday  I had ever spent. The grey old church, with its exquisitely carved  screen and pulpit, black polished oak, its heavy massive pillars, and  quaint scanty congregation. How distinguished the Colonel and Miss  Vernon looked amongst them! Gilpin's almost inspired strains on the  organ, contrasted rather forcibly with the drowsiness of the service,  doled out by a little mummy in spectacles, evidently minus several  teeth, essential to a clear enunciation. We all sat in Winter's pew,  and Miss Araminta Cox was there in a yellow bonnet, the turban, I  suppose, done up in a different shape.    After church we had an early dinner, luncheon rather, then a stroll  along the river, where we found Elijah Bush preaching to a mob of boys  and girls; it seemed curious, too, not having any dinner at the regular  hour.    The old church looked dim and solemn at evening service, its only  lights were those partially illuminating the little mummy in his task  of deciphering his own hieroglyphics. Then came a social cup of coffee,  a parting injunction to be punctual, and we separated for the night.    Monday rose clear and bright, a warm sun and cool bracing air. I  reached the Priory in good time for their early breakfast, and found  Colonel Vernon and his granddaughter in high spirits, the latter  looking lovely, her colour heightened by the clear morning air, and her  whole countenance beaming with a joyous expression, the reflection of  her pure happy heart.    Soon after ten o'clock the unwonted sound of carriages in the  churchyard announced the arrival of the rest of the party, and we all  assembled at the entrance gate to arrange the order of proceeding.    Cyclops already showed symptoms of improved feeding, but was as rough  and shaggy as ever, as he"]]]
