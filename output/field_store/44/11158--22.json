To account for the absence of Pleyel  became once more the scope of my conjectures. How many incidents might  occur to raise an insuperable impediment in his way? When I was a child,  a scheme of pleasure, in which he and his sister were parties, had been,  in like manner, frustrated by his absence; but his absence, in that  instance, had been occasioned by his falling from a boat into the river,  in consequence of which he had run the most imminent hazard of being  drowned. Here was a second disappointment endured by the same persons,  and produced by his failure. Might it not originate in the same cause?  Had he not designed to cross the river that morning to make some  necessary purchases in Jersey? He had preconcerted to return to his  own house to dinner; but, perhaps, some disaster had befallen him.  Experience had taught me the insecurity of a canoe, and that was the  only kind of boat which Pleyel used: I was, likewise, actuated by  an hereditary dread of water. These circumstances combined to bestow  considerable plausibility on this conjecture; but the consternation  with which I began to be seized was allayed by reflecting, that if  this disaster had happened my brother would have received the speediest  information of it. The consolation which this idea imparted was ravished  from me by a new thought. This disaster might have happened, and his  family not be apprized of it. The first intelligence of his fate may  be communicated by the livid corpse which the tide may cast, many days  hence, upon the shore.    Thus was I distressed by opposite conjectures: thus was I tormented by  phantoms of my own creation. It was not always thus. I can ascertain the  date when my mind became the victim of this imbecility; perhaps it was  coeval with the inroad of a fatal passion; a passion that will never  rank me in the number of its eulogists; it was alone sufficient to the  extermination of my peace: it was itself a plenteous source of  calamity, and needed not the concurrence of other evils to take away the  attractions of existence, and dig for me an untimely grave.    The state of my mind naturally introduced a train of reflections upon  the dangers and cares which inevitably beset an human being. By no  violent transition was I led to ponder on the turbulent life and  mysterious end of my father. I cherished, with the utmost veneration,  the memory of this man, and every relique connected with his fate was  preserved with the most scrupulous care. Among these was to be numbered  a manuscript, containing memoirs of his own life. The narrative was by  no means recommended by its eloquence; but neither did all its value  flow from my relationship to the author. Its stile had an unaffected and  picturesque simplicity. The great variety and circumstantial display of  the incidents, together with their intrinsic importance, as descriptive  of human manners and passions, made it the most useful book in my  collection. It was late; but being sensible of no inclination to sleep,  I resolved to betake myself to the perusal of it.    To do this it was requisite to procure a light. The girl had long since  retired to her chamber: it was therefore proper to wait upon myself.  A lamp, and the means of lighting it, were only to be found in the  kitchen. Thither I resolved forthwith to repair; but the light was of  use merely to enable me to read the book. I knew the shelf and the spot  where it stood. Whether I took down the book, or prepared the lamp in  the first place, appeared to be a matter of no moment. The latter was  preferred, and, leaving my seat, I approached the closet in which, as I  mentioned formerly, my books and papers were deposited.    Suddenly the remembrance of what had lately passed in this closet  occurred. Whether midnight was approaching, or had passed, I knew not. I  was, as then, alone, and defenceless. The wind was in that direction  in which, aided by the deathlike repose of nature, it brought to me  the murmur of the water-fall. This was mingled with that solemn and  enchanting sound, which a breeze produces among the leaves of pines. The  words of that mysterious dialogue, their fearful import, and the wild  excess to which I was transported by my terrors, filled my imagination  anew. My steps faultered, and I stood a moment to recover myself.    I prevailed on myself at length to move towards the closet. I touched  the lock, but my fingers were powerless; I was visited afresh by  unconquerable apprehensions. A sort of belief darted into my mind, that  some being was concealed within, whose purposes were evil. I began to  contend with those fears, when it occurred to me that I might, without  impropriety, go for a lamp previously to opening the closet. I receded  a few steps; but before I reached my chamber door my thoughts took a new  direction. Motion seemed to produce a mechanical influence upon me. I  was ashamed of my weakness. Besides, what aid could be afforded me by a  lamp?    My fears had pictured to themselves no precise object. It would be  difficult to depict, in words, the ingredients and hues of that phantom  which haunted me. An hand invisible and of preternatural strength,  lifted by human passions, and selecting my life for its aim, were parts  of this terrific image. All places were alike accessible to this foe, or  if his empire were restricted by local bounds, those bounds were utterly  inscrutable by me. But had I not been told by some one in league with  this enemy, that every place but the recess in the bank was exempt from  danger? I returned to the closet, and once more put my hand upon the  lock. O! may my ears lose their sensibility, ere they be again assailed  by a shriek so terrible! Not merely my understanding was subdued by the  sound: it acted on my nerves like an edge of steel. It appeared to cut  asunder the fibres of my brain, and rack every joint with agony.    The cry, loud and piercing as it was, was nevertheless human. No  articulation was ever more distinct. The breath which accompanied it did  not fan my hair, yet did every circumstance combine to persuade me that  the lips which uttered it touched my very shoulder.    \"Hold! Hold!\" were the words of this tremendous prohibition, in whose  tone the whole soul seemed to be wrapped up, and every energy converted  into eagerness and terror.    Shuddering, I dashed myself against the wall, and by the same  involuntary impulse, turned my face backward to examine the mysterious  monitor. The moon-light streamed into each window, and every corner of  the room was conspicuous, and yet I beheld nothing!    The interval was too brief to be artificially measured, between the  utterance of these words, and my scrutiny directed to the quarter whence  they came. Yet if a human being had been there, could he fail to have  been visible? Which of my senses was the prey of a fatal illusion? The  shock which the sound produced was still felt in every part of my frame.  The sound, therefore, could not but be a genuine commotion. But that I  had heard it, was not more true than that the being who uttered it was  stationed at my right ear; yet my attendant was invisible.    I cannot describe the state of my thoughts at that moment. Surprize  had mastered my faculties. My frame shook, and the vital current was  congealed. I was conscious only to the vehemence of my sensations. This  condition could not be lasting. Like a tide, which suddenly mounts to  an overwhelming height, and then gradually subsides, my confusion slowly  gave place to order, and my tumults to a calm. I was able to deliberate  and move. I resumed my feet, and advanced into the midst of the room.  Upward, and behind, and on each side, I threw penetrating glances. I was  not satisfied with one examination. He that hitherto refused to be  seen, might change his purpose, and on the next survey be clearly  distinguishable.    Solitude imposes least restraint upon the fancy. Dark is less fertile  of images than the feeble lustre of the moon. I was alone, and the walls  were chequered by shadowy forms. As the moon passed behind a cloud and  emerged, these shadows seemed to be endowed with life, and to move. The  apartment was open to the breeze, and the curtain was occasionally  blown from its ordinary position. This motion was not unaccompanied with  sound. I failed not to snatch a look, and to listen when this motion  and this sound occurred. My belief that my monitor was posted near,  was strong, and instantly converted these appearances to tokens of his  presence, and yet I could discern nothing.    When my thoughts were at length permitted to revert to the past, the  first idea that occurred was the resemblance between the words of the  voice which I had just heard, and those which had terminated my dream in  the summer-house. There are means by which we are able to distinguish a  substance from a shadow, a reality from the phantom of a dream. The pit,  my brother beckoning me forward, the seizure of my arm, and the voice  behind, were surely imaginary. That these incidents were fashioned in my  sleep, is supported by the same indubitable evidence that compels me to  believe myself awake at present; yet the words and the voice were the  same. Then, by some inexplicable contrivance, I was aware of the danger,  while my actions and sensations were those of one wholly unacquainted  with it. Now, was it not equally true that my actions and persuasions  were at war? Had not the belief, that evil lurked in the closet, gained  admittance, and had not my actions betokened an unwarrantable security?  To obviate the effects of my infatuation, the same means had been used.    In my dream, he that tempted me to my destruction, was my brother. Death  was ambushed in my path. From what evil was I now rescued? What minister  or implement of ill was shut up in this recess? Who was it whose  suffocating grasp I was to feel, should I dare to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7937"],[0,"Journal of an African Cruiser (#17)"],[1,"re,  proposed that King Freeman should sell his land on the Cape, receiving a  fair equivalent from the colony, and should transplant his town across the  river, or elsewhere. But the King showed no inclination to comply; nor did  the Commodore, apparently, deem it his province to support Governor  Russwurm, or take any part in the question. The point was accordingly  given up; the Governor merely requesting King Freeman to \"look his head,\"  that is, consider--and let him know his determination.    There was also a complaint made, on the part of the missionaries, that the  natives had cut off their supplies, and had attempted to take away the  native children, who had been given them to educate. I was subsequently  informed, however, by the Rev. Mr. Hazlehurst, that the missionaries had  no difficulty with the natives, and did not wish their affairs to be  identified with those of the colonists. The above representation,  therefore, appears to have been unauthorized by the mission establishment.  And here, without presuming to offer an opinion as respects their conduct  at this particular juncture, I must be allowed to say, that the  missionaries at Liberia have shown themselves systematically disposed to  claim a position entirely independent of the colonies. They are supported  by wealthy and powerful societies at home; they have been accustomed to  look upon their own race as superior to the colored people; they are  individually conscious, no doubt, in many cases, of an intellectual  standing above that of the persons prominent among the emigrants; and they  are not always careful to conceal their sense of such general or  particular superiority. It is certain, too, that the native Africans  regard the whites with much greater respect than those of their own color.  Hence, it is almost impossible but that jealousy of missionary influence  should exist in the minds of the colonial authorities. The latter  perceive, in the midst of their commonwealth, an alien power, exercised by  persons not entitled to the privileges of citizenship, and to whom it was  never intended to allow voice or action in public affairs. By such a state  of things, the progress of Christianity and civilisation must be rather  retarded than advanced.    There is reason, therefore, to doubt whether the labors of white  missionaries, in the territory over which the colonists exercise  jurisdiction, is, upon the whole, beneficial. If removed beyond those  limits, and insulated among the natives, they may accomplish infinite  good; but not while assuming an anomalous position of independence, and  thwarting the great experiment which the founders of Liberia had in view.  One grand object of these colonies is, to test the disputed and doubtful  point, whether the colored race be capable of sustaining themselves  without the aid or presence of the whites. In order to a fair trial of the  question, it seems essential that none but colored missionaries should be  sent hither. The difficulties between the Government and the Methodist  Episcopal mission confirm these views. At a former period, that mission  possessed power almost sufficient to subvert the Colonial rule.    Let it not be supposed, that these remarks are offered in any spirit of  hostility to missionaries. My intercourse with them in different parts of  the world, has been of the most friendly nature. I owe much to their  kindness, and can bear cheerful testimony to the laborious, self-devoting  spirit in which they do their duty. At Athens, I have seen them toiling  unremittingly, for years, to educate the ignorant and degraded descendants  of the ancient Greeks, and was proud that my own country--in a hemisphere  of which Plato never dreamed--should have sent back to Greece a holier  wisdom than he diffused from thence. In the unhealthy isle of Cyprus, I  have beheld them perishing without a murmur, and their places filled with  new votaries, stepping over the graves of the departed, and not less ready  to spend and be spent in the cause of their Divine Master. I have  witnessed the flight of whole families from the mountains of Lebanon,  where they had lingered until its cedars were prostrate beneath the storm  of war, and only then came to shelter themselves under the flag of their  country. Everywhere, the spirit of the American Missionaries has been  honorable to their native land; nor, whatever be their human  imperfections, is it too much to term them holy in their lives, and often  martyrs in their deaths. And none more so than the very men of whom I now  speak, in these sickly regions of Africa, where I behold them sinking,  more or less gradually, but with certainty, and destitute of almost every  earthly comfort, into their graves. I criticise portions of their conduct,  but reverence their purity of motive; and only regret, that, while  divesting themselves of so much that is worldly, they do not retain either  more wisdom of this world, or less aptness to apply a disturbing influence  to worldly affairs.    But it is time to return from this digression. Matters being now in a good  train at Cape Palmas, we go to use our pacific influence elsewhere.    10.--We sailed at daylight, and anchored this evening at Rock Boukir.    11.--In the morning, twelve armed boats were sent ashore from the three  ships. We landed on an open beach, all in safety, but more or less  drenched by the dangerous surf. One or two boats took in heavy seas,  broached to, and rolled over and over in the gigantic surf-wave. On  landing, we found a body of armed natives, perhaps fifty in number, drawn  up in a line. Their weapons were muskets, iron war-spears, long  fish-spears of wood, and broad knives. They made no demonstrations of  opposing us, but stood stoutly in their ranks, showing more independence  of bearing and less fear, than any natives whom we have met with. They  were evidently under military rule, and, as well as the remainder of the  tribe, evinced a degree of boldness, amounting almost to insolence, which,  it must be owned, would have made our party the more ready for a tustle,  on any reasonable pretext.    The town of Rock Boukir is enclosed by palisades, about eight feet high,  with small gates on every side. It was not the purpose of the natives to  admit us within their walls; but a rain made it desirable that the palaver  should be held in a sheltered place, instead of on the beach, as had been  originally intended.    We therefore marched in, took possession of the place, and stationed  sentinels at every gate. The town was entirely deserted; for the warriors  had gone forth to fight, if a fight there was to be; and the women and  children were sent for security into the \"bush.\" In the central square  stood the Palaver House, beneath the shadow of a magnificent  wide-spreading tree, which had perhaps mingled the murmur of its leaves  with the eloquence of the native orators, for at least a century. Here we  posted ourselves, and awaited the King of Rock Boukir.    The messengers announced, that he wished to bring his armed men within the  walls, and occupy one side of the town, while our party held the other. As  this proposition was not immediately acceded to, and as the King would not  recede, it seemed doubtful whether there would be any palaver, after all.  At length, however, the Commodore ordered the removal of our sentinels  from the gates, on one side of the town, and consented that the native  warriors should come in. A further delay was accounted for, on the plea  that the King was putting on his robes of state. Finally, he entered the  Palaver House and seated himself; an old man of sinister aspect, meanly  dressed, and having for his only weapon a short sword, with a curved  blade, six inches wide. Governor Roberts now opened the palaver, by  informing the king that his tribe were suspected of having participated in  the plunder of the Mary Carver, and the murder of her captain and crew. I  subjoin a brief narrative of this affair.    Two years since, the schooner Mary Carver, of Salem, commanded by Captain  Farwell of Vassalboro', was anchored at Half Berebee, for the purpose of  trading with the natives. Her cargo was valued at twelve thousand dollars.  Captain Farwell felt great confidence in the people of Half Berebee,  although warned not to trust them too far, as they had the character of  being fierce and treacherous. One day, being alone on shore, the natives  knocked him down, bound him, and delivered him to the women and children,  to be tortured by sticking thorns into his flesh. After three hours of  this horrible agony, the men despatched him. As soon as the captain was  secured, a large party was sent on board the vessel, to surprise and  murder the mate and crew. In this they were perfectly successful; not a  soul on board escaped. They then took part of the goods out, and ran the  schooner ashore, where she was effectually plundered. Within a space of  twelve miles along the beach, there are five or six families of Fishmen,  ruled by different members of the Cracko family, of which Ben Cracko of  Half Berebee is the head. All these towns were implicated in the plot, and  received a share of the plunder. A Portuguese schooner had been taken, and  her crew murdered, at the same place, a year before. The business had  turned out so profitably, that other tribes on the coast began to envy the  good fortune of the Crackos, and declared that they likewise were going to  \"catch\" a vessel.    The object of our present palaver was to inquire into the alleged agency  of the tribe at Rock Boukir in the above transaction. The King, speaking  in his own language, strenuously denied the charge; at the same time  touching his ears and drawing his tongue over his short curved  broad-sword. By these symbols and hieroglyphics, I supposed him to mean,  that he had merely heard of the affair, and that his sword was innocent of  the blood imputed to him. It"]]]
