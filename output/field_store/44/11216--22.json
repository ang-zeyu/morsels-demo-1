Which is which?\" asked Betty.    \"Flatterer!\" laughed Helen, shaking her finger.    \"And a married man, too!\" continued Betty.    \"Well, being married has not affected my poetical sentiment, nor  impaired my eyesight.\"    \"But it has seriously inconvenienced your old propensity of making  love to the girls. Not that you wouldn't if you dared,\" replied Betty  with mischief in her eye.    \"Now, Will, what do you think of that? Isn't it real sisterly regard?  Come, we'll go and look at my thoroughbreds,\" said Colonel Zane.    \"Where is Jonathan?\" Helen asked presently. \"Something happened at  Metzar's yesterday. Papa wouldn't tell me, and I want to ask  Jonathan.\"    \"Jack is down by the spring. He spends a great deal of his time there.  It's shady and cool, and the water babbles over the stones.\"    \"How much alone he is,\" said Helen.    Betty took her former position on the steps, but did not raise her  eyes while she continued speaking. \"Yes, he's more alone than ever  lately, and quieter, too. He hardly ever speaks now. There must be  something on his mind more serious than horse-thieves.\"    \"What?\" Helen asked quickly.    \"I'd better not tell--you.\"    A long moment passed before Helen spoke.    \"Please tell me!\"    \"Well, Helen, we think, Eb and I, that Jack is in love for the first  time in his life, and with you, you adorable creature. But Jack's a  borderman; he is stern in his principles, thinks he is wedded to his  border life, and he knows that he has both red and white blood on his  hands. He'd die before he'd speak of his love, because he cannot  understand that would do any good, even if you loved him, which is, of  course, preposterous.\"    \"Loves me!\" breathed Helen softly.    She sat down rather beside Betty, and turned her face away. She still  held the young woman's hand which she squeezed so tightly as to make  its owner wince. Betty stole a look at her, and saw the rich red blood  mantling her cheeks, and her full bosom heave.    Helen turned presently, with no trace of emotion except a singular  brilliance of the eyes. She was so slow to speak again that Colonel  Zane and Will returned from the corral before she found her voice.    \"Colonel Zane, please tell me about last night. When papa came home to  supper he was pale and very nervous. I knew something had happened.  But he would not explain, which made me all the more anxious. Won't  you please tell me?\"    Colonel Zane glanced again at her, and knew what had happened. Despite  her self-possession those tell-tale eyes told her secret.  Ever-changing and shadowing with a bounding, rapturous light, they  were indeed the windows of her soul. All the emotion of a woman's  heart shone there, fear, beauty, wondering appeal, trembling joy, and  timid hope.    \"Tell you? Indeed I will,\" replied Colonel Zane, softened and a little  remorseful under those wonderful eyes.    No one liked to tell a story better than Colonel Zane. Briefly and  graphically he related the circumstances of the affair leading to the  attack on Helen's father, and, as the tale progressed, he became quite  excited, speaking with animated face and forceful gestures.    \"Just as the knife-point touched your father, a swiftly-flying object  knocked the weapon to the floor. It was Jonathan's tomahawk. What  followed was so sudden I hardly saw it. Like lightning, and flexible  as steel, Jonathan jumped over the table, smashed Case against the  wall, pulled him up and threw him over the bank. I tell you, Helen, it  was a beautiful piece of action; but not, of course, for a woman's  eyes. Now that's all. Your father was not even hurt.\"    \"He saved papa's life,\" murmured Helen, standing like a statue.    She wheeled suddenly with that swift bird-like motion habitual to her,  and went quickly down the path leading to the spring.           *       *       *       *       *    Jonathan Zane, solitary dreamer of dreams as he was, had never been in  as strange and beautiful a reverie as that which possessed him on this  Sabbath morning.    Deep into his heart had sunk Betty's words. The wonder of it, the  sweetness, that alone was all he felt. The glory of this girl had  begun, days past, to spread its glamour round him. Swept irresistibly  away now, he soared aloft in a dream-castle of fancy with its painted  windows and golden walls.    For the first time in his life on the border he had entered the little  glade and had no eye for the crystal water flowing over the pebbles  and mossy stones, or the plot of grassy ground inclosed by tall, dark  trees and shaded by a canopy of fresh green and azure blue. Nor did he  hear the music of the soft rushing water, the warbling birds, or the  gentle sighing breeze moving the leaves.    Gone, vanished, lost to-day was that sweet companionship of nature.  That indefinable and unutterable spirit which flowed so peacefully to  him from his beloved woods; that something more than merely affecting  his senses, which existed for him in the stony cliffs, and breathed  with life through the lonely aisles of the forest, had fled before the  fateful power of a woman's love and beauty.    A long time that seemed only a moment passed while he leaned against a  stone. A light step sounded on the path.    A vision in pure white entered the glade; two little hands pressed  his, and two dark-blue eyes of misty beauty shed their light on him.    \"Jonathan, I am come to thank you.\"    Sweet and tremulous, the voice sounded far away.    \"Thank me? For what?\"    \"You saved papa's life. Oh! how can I thank you?\"    No voice answered for him.    \"I have nothing to give but this.\"    A flower-like face was held up to him; hands light as thistledown  touched his shoulders; dark-blue eyes glowed upon him with all  tenderness.    \"May I thank you--so?\"    Soft lips met his full and lingeringly.    Then came a rush as of wind, a flash of white, and the patter of  flying feet. He was alone in the glade.          CHAPTER X    June passed; July opened with unusually warm weather, and Fort Henry  had no visits from Indians or horse-thieves, nor any inconvenience  except the hot sun. It was the warmest weather for many years, and  seriously dwarfed the settlers' growing corn. Nearly all the springs  were dry, and a drouth menaced the farmers.    The weather gave Helen an excuse which she was not slow to adopt. Her  pale face and languid air perplexed and worried her father and her  friends. She explained to them that the heat affected her  disagreeably.    Long days had passed since that Sunday morning when she kissed the  borderman. What transports of sweet hope and fear were hers then! How  shame had scorched her happiness! Yet still she gloried in the act. By  that kiss had she awakened to a full consciousness of her love. With  insidious stealth and ever-increasing power this flood had increased  to full tide, and, bursting its bonds, surged over her with  irresistible strength.    During the first days after the dawning of her passion, she lived in  its sweetness, hearing only melodious sounds chiming in her soul. The  hours following that Sunday were like long dreams. But as all things  reach fruition, so this girlish period passed, leaving her a  thoughtful woman. She began to gather up the threads of her life where  love had broken them, to plan nobly, and to hope and wait.    Weeks passed, however, and her lover did not come. Betty told her that  Jonathan made flying trips at break of day to hold council with  Colonel Zane; that he and Wetzel were on the trail of Shawnees with  stolen horses, and both bordermen were in their dark, vengeful,  terrible moods. In these later days Helen passed through many stages  of feeling. After the exalting mood of hot, young love, came reaction.  She fell into the depths of despair. Sorrow paled her face, thinned  her cheeks and lent another shadow, a mournful one, to her great eyes.  The constant repression of emotion, the strain of trying to seem  cheerful when she was miserable, threatened even her magnificent  health. She answered the solicitude of her friends by evasion, and  then by that innocent falsehood in which a sensitive soul hides its  secrets. Shame was only natural, because since the borderman came not,  nor sent her a word, pride whispered that she had wooed him,  forgetting modesty.    Pride, anger, shame, despair, however, finally fled before affection.  She loved this wild borderman, and knew he loved her in return  although he might not understand it himself. His simplicity, his lack  of experience with women, his hazardous life and stern duty regarding  it, pleaded for him and for her love. For the lack of a little  understanding she would never live unhappy and alone while she was  loved. Better give a thousand times more than she had sacrificed. He  would return to the village some day, when the Indians and the thieves  were run down, and would be his own calm, gentle self. Then she would  win him, break down his allegiance to this fearful border life, and  make him happy in her love.    While Helen was going through one of the fires of life to come out  sweeter and purer, if a little pensive and sad, time, which waits not  for love, nor life, nor death, was hastening onward, and soon the  golden fields of grain were stored. September came with its fruitful  promise fulfilled.    Helen entered once more into the quiet, social life of the little  settlement, taught her class on Sundays, did all her own work, and  even found time to bring a ray of sunshine to more than one sick  child's bed. Yet she did not forget her compact with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9935"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery.

All  fruit should be looked over occasionally, and those which show signs of  spoiling should be removed.      MENUS AND RECIPES    58. As practically every woman knows, a MENU, or _bill of fare_,  consists of a certain number of dishes given in the order in which they  are to be served; likewise, she knows that the dishes called for in a  menu must be prepared according to a RECIPE, or _receipt_, which is the  list of ingredients of a mixture giving the exact proportions to be  used, together with proper directions for compounding. In all good  recipes the items are tabulated in the order in which they are needed,  so as to save time and produce good results. Items tabulated in this  manner also serve to minimize the danger of omitting some of the  ingredients of a recipe, for they can be easily checked up when they are  given in the proper order.    59. In preparing recipes, the beginner in cookery usually has difficulty  in judging the size of a recipe. The experienced housewife will not  follow a recipe exactly when she thinks it will produce more food than  she needs to meet the requirements of her family; instead, she will  reduce the quantities to suit her wants. Likewise, if a recipe will not  provide enough, she will increase the quantities accordingly. Just how  to judge whether or not a recipe will make what is wanted comes only  with experience, but the beginner may be guided by the fact that it is  never wise to prepare more than enough of one kind of dish, unless, of  course, it can be used to good advantage as a left-over. On the other  hand, if a recipe is for food that can be kept and used for another meal  later, it often pays to make up more, so as to save time, fuel, and  labor. In any event, it is always advisable to follow explicitly the  directions that are given, for if the recipe is of the right kind they  will be given so that success will result from carrying them out  in detail.    60. In order that the beginner in cookery may form a definite idea of  the manner in which the dishes of a menu, or bill of fare, may be  prepared so that they will be ready to serve in their proper order at  meal time, there is here given a simple dinner menu, together with the  recipes for preparing the dishes called for and the order in which they  should be prepared. While these recipes are not intended to teach  methods of cookery, which are taken up later, the student is advised to  prepare the menu for her own satisfaction and so that she will be able  to report on the success she has had with each dish.    MENU    Pan-Broiled Chops  Mashed Potatoes  Creamed Peas  Cabbage Salad  Orange Fluff with Sauce           *       *       *       *       *    RECIPES    PAN-BROILED CHOPS    Buy the necessary number of pork, veal, or lamb chops, and proceed to  cook them according to the directions previously given for pan broiling.  Season with salt and pepper just before removing the chops from the pan.    MASHED POTATOES    Peel the desired number of potatoes, put to cook in a sufficient amount  of boiling salted water to cover well, and cook until the potatoes are  tender enough to be easily pierced with a fork. Remove from the fire and  drain off the water. Mash the potatoes with a wooden or a wire potato  masher, being careful to reduce all the particles to a pulpy mass in  order to prevent lumps, or put them through a ricer. When sufficiently  mashed, season with additional salt, a dash of pepper, and a small piece  of butter, and add hot milk until they are thinned to a mushy  consistency, but not too soft to stand up well when dropped from a  spoon. Then beat the potatoes vigorously with a large spoon until they  are light and fluffy.    CREAMED PEAS    Boil until they are soft, two cupfuls of fresh peas in 1 quart of water  to which have been added 1 tablespoonful of salt and 2 of sugar, and  then drain; or, use 1 can of peas, heat them to the boiling point in  their liquid, and then drain. A part of the water in which the fresh  peas were cooked or the liquid on the canned peas may be used with an  equal amount of milk to make a sauce for the peas, or all milk may  be used.    SAUCE FOR PEAS    1 c. of milk, or 1/2 c. liquid from peas and  1/2 c. milk  1 Tb. butter  1/2 tsp. salt  1 Tb. flour    Melt the butter in a saucepan or a double boiler, work in the flour and  salt until a smooth paste is formed, and add the liquid that has been  heated. Stir until thick and smooth. Add to the peas, reheat, and serve.    CABBAGE SALAD    1/2 medium-sized head of cabbage  1/2 tsp. salt  1 small red or green sweet pepper  Dash of pepper  1 small onion  Salad dressing    Shred the cabbage finely by cutting across the leaves with a sharp knife  or a cabbage shredder. Chop the pepper and onion into very small pieces  and add to the cabbage. Mix well and add the salt and pepper.    CABBAGE-SALAD DRESSING    3/4 c. vinegar  1/2 tsp. mustard, if desired  1/4 c. water  1/2 tsp. salt  2 Tb. butter  3 Tb. sugar  1 Tb. flour    Heat the water and the vinegar; melt the butter in a saucepan, add to it  the flour, mustard, salt, and sugar, stir until well blended, and then  pour in the hot liquid. Cook for a few minutes, stirring constantly to  prevent the formation of lumps. Pour over the cabbage while hot; allow  it to cool and then serve on plates garnished with lettuce.    ORANGE FLUFF    1/2 c. sugar  1/4 c. orange juice  5 Tb. corn starch  1 Tb. lemon juice  Pinch of salt  2 egg whites  1 pt. boiling water    Mix the corn starch and sugar and salt, stir into the boiling water, and  cook directly over the fire until the mixture thickens. Continue to  cook, stirring constantly for 10 minutes, or place in a double boiler  and cook 1/2 hour. Beat the egg whites until they are stiff.    When the corn starch is cooked, remove from the fire and mix thoroughly  with the fruit juices. Pour over the beaten egg whites and stir slightly  until the eggs and corn starch are mixed. Pour into sherbet glasses or  molds wet with cold water and set aside until ready to serve.    SAUCE FOR ORANGE FLUFF    1 Tb. corn starch  3/4 c. boiling water  2 Tb. butter  3/4 c. sugar  2 egg yolks  1/4 c. orange juice  1 Tb. lemon juice    Moisten the corn starch with a little cold water and stir in 1/2 cupful  of the boiling water. Cook for 10 or 15 minutes. Cream the butter, add  the sugar and egg yolks, beat the mixture with a fork, and add the  remaining 1/4 cupful of boiling water. Stir this into the corn starch  and cook until the eggs thicken slightly. Remove from the fire and add  the orange and lemon juices. Serve cold over the orange fluff.    61. In the preparation of a meal, it is impossible to follow the order  of service given in a menu, because of the different lengths of time  required to prepare the different dishes. The order in which the menu  here given should be prepared will therefore serve to show the way in  which other meals may be planned or other menus carried out. Each recipe  for this menu is planned to serve six persons, but it can be easily  changed in case a different number are to be served. For instance, if  there are only four in the family, two-thirds of each ingredient should  be used; and if only three, just one-half of each. If eight are to be  served, one-third will have to be added to each of the amounts. As has  been pointed out, just a little thought will show how other numbers may  be provided for.    62. In preparing the foods called for in this menu, the dessert, which  is the last thing given, should be prepared first, because time must be  allowed for it to cool before serving. In fact, it may be prepared a  half day before it is to be served. So as to allow sufficient time to  mash the potatoes after they have boiled, they should be made ready to  put on the stove about 3/4 hour before the meal is to be served. After  the potatoes have been put on to boil, the peas, provided fresh ones are  to be used, should be put on to cook, and then the sauce for them should  be made. If canned peas are to be used, the sauce should be made after  the potatoes have been put on the stove and the peas should be heated  and combined with the sauce just before broiling the chops. The cabbage  salad may then be prepared, and put in a cool place until it is to be  served. The chops should be broiled last, because it is necessary that  they be served immediately upon being taken from the fire.      TERMS USED IN COOKERY    63. It is important that every person who is engaged in the preparation  of food be thoroughly familiar with the various terms that are used in  cookery. Many of these are not understood by the average person, because  they are foreign terms or words that are seldom employed in other  occupations. However, as they occur frequently in recipes, cook books,  menus, etc., familiarity with them will enable one to follow recipes and  to make up menus in a more intelligent manner.    In view of these facts, a table of terms that are made use of in cookery  is here given, together with definitions of the words and, wherever it  has been deemed necessary, with as accurate pronunciations as can be  obtained. The terms are given in bold-faced type, and for easy reference  are arranged alphabetically. It is recommended that constant use be made  of this table, for much of the success achieved in cookery depends on a  clear understanding of the words and expressions that are peculiar to  this science.    A la; au; aux (ah lah; o; o).--With; dressed in a certain style; as,  smelts a la tartare, which means smelts with tartare sauce.    Au gratin (o gra-tang).--Literally, dressed with brown crumbs. In actual  practice, also flavored with grated cheese.    Au naturel (o nat-ue-rayl).--A term applied to uncooked vegetables, to  indicate that they are served in their natural state without sauce or  dressing applied. Potatoes au naturel are served cooked;"]]]
