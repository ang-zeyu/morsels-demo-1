[FN#20] The author has forgotten to mention one of the principal  advantages of slaves, namely, the prospect of arriving at the highest  rank of the empire. The Pasha of the Syrian caravan with which I  travelled to Damascus, had been the slave of a slave, and he is but a  solitary instance of cases perpetually occuring in all Moslem lands.  \"C'est un homme de bonne famille,\" said a Turkish officer in Egypt, \"il  a ete achete.\"  [FN#21] A \"Barbarian\" from Nubia and Upper Egypt. Some authorities, Mr.  Lane for instance, attribute the good reputation of these people to  their superior cunning. Sonnini says, \"they are intelligent and handy  servants, but knaves.\" Others believe in them. As far as I could find  out, they were generally esteemed more honest than the Egyptians, and  they certainly possess a certain sense of honour unknown to their  northern brethren. \"Berberi\" is a term of respect; \"Masri\" (corrupted  from Misri) in the mouth of a Badawi or an Arab of Arabia is a  reproach. \"He shall be called an Egyptian,\" means \"he shall belong to a  degraded race.\"  [FN#22] Who becomes responsible, and must pay for any theft his protege  may commit. Berberis, being generally \"les Suisses\" of respectable  establishments, are expected to be honest. But I can assert from  experience that, as a native, you will never recover the value of a  stolen article without having recourse to the police. For his valuable  security, the Shaykh demands a small fee (7 or 8 piastres), which,  despite the urgent remonstrances of protector and protege, you deduct  from the latter's wages. The question of pay is a momentous one; too  much always spoils a good servant, too little leaves you without one.  An Egyptian of the middle class would pay his Berberi about 40 piastres  a month, besides board, lodging, some small perquisites, and presents  on certain occasions. This, however, will not induce a man to travel,  especially to cross the sea.  [FN#23] A man from the Sa'id or Upper Egypt.  [FN#24] A favourite way of annoying the Berberis is to repeat the  saying, \"we have eaten the clean, we have eaten the unclean,\"-meaning,  that they are by no means cunning in the difference between right and  wrong, pure and impure. I will relate the origin of the saying, as I  heard it differently, from Mansfield Parkyns, (Life in Abyssinia, chap.  31.) A Berberi, said my informant, had been carefully fattening a fine  sheep for a feast, when his cottage was burned by an accident. In the  ashes he found roasted meat, which looked tempting to a hungry man: he  called his neighbours, and all sat down to make merry over the mishap;  presently they came to the head, which proved to be that of a dog, some  enemy having doubtless stolen the sheep and put the impure animal in  its place. Whereupon, sadly perplexed, all the Berberis went to their  priest, and dolefully related the circumstance, expecting absolution,  as the offence was involuntary. \"You have eaten filth,\" said the man of  Allah. \"Well,\" replied the Berberis, falling upon him with their fists,  \"filth or not, we have eaten it.\" The Berberi, I must remark, is the  \"Paddy\" of this part of the world, celebrated for bulls and blunders.  [FN#25] The generic name given by Indians to English officials.  [FN#26] There are four kinds of tobacco smoked in Egypt. The first and  best is the well-known Latakia, generally called \"Jabali,\" either from  a small seaport town about three hours' journey south of Latakia, or  more probably because grown on the hills near the ancient Laodicea.  Pure, it is known by its blackish colour, fine shredding, absence of  stalk, and an undescribable odour, to me resembling that of creosote;  the leaf, too, is small, so that when made into cigars it must be  covered over with a slip of the yellow Turkish tobacco called Bafra.  Except at the highest houses unadulterated Latakia is not to be had in  Cairo. Yet, mixed as it is, no other growth exceeds it in flavour and  fragrance. Miss Martineau smoked it, we are told, without  inconvenience, and it differs from our Shag, Bird's-eye, and Returns,  in degree, as does Chateau Margeau from a bottle of cheap strong  Spanish wine. To bring out its flavour, the connoisseur smokes it in  long pipes of cherry, jasmine, maple, or rosewood, and these require a  servant skilled in the arts of cleaning and filling them. The best  Jabali at Cairo costs about seven piastres the pound; after which a  small sum must be paid to the Farram or chopper, who prepares it for  use.  2nd. Suri (Tyrian), or Shami, or Suryani, grown in Syria, an inferior  growth, of a lighter colour than Latakia, and with a greenish tinge;  when cut, its value is about three piastres per pound. Some smokers mix  this leaf with Jabali, which, to my taste, spoils the flavour of the  latter without improving the former. The strongest kind, called Korani  or Jabayl, is generally used for cigarettes; it costs, when of  first-rate quality, about five piastres per pound.  3rd. Tumbak, or Persian tobacco, called Hijazi, because imported from  the Hijaz, where everybody smokes it, and supposed to come from Shiraz,  Kazerun, and other celebrated places in Persia. It is all but  impossible to buy this article unadulterated, except from the caravans  returning after the pilgrimage. The Egyptians mix it with native  growths, which ruins its flavour and gives it an acridity that \"catches  the throat,\" whereas good tumbak never yet made a man cough. Yet the  taste of this tobacco, even when second-rate, is so fascinating to some  smokers that they will use no other. To be used it should be wetted and  squeezed, and it is invariably inhaled through water into the lungs:  almost every town has its favourite description of pipe, and these are  of all kinds, from the pauper's rough cocoa-nut mounted with two reeds,  to the prince's golden bowl set with the finest stones. Tumbak is  cheap, costing about four piastres a pound, but large quantities of it  are used.  4th. Hummi, as the word signifies, a \"hot\" variety of the tumbak, grown  in Al-Yaman and other countries. It is placed in the tile on the buri  or cocoa-nut pipe, unwetted, and has a very acrid flavour. Being  supposed to produce intoxication, or rather a swimming in the head,  hummi gives its votaries a bad name: respectable men would answer \"no\"  with rage if asked whether they are smoking it, and when a fellow tells  you that he has seen better days, but that now he smokes Hummi in a  buri, you understand him that his misfortunes have affected either his  brain or his morality. Hence it is that this tobacco is never put into  pipes intended for smoking the other kinds. The price of Hummi is about  five piastres per pound.  [FN#26] A study essential to the learned, as in some particular  portions of the Koran a mispronunciation becomes a sin.  [FN#27] The Shafe'i, to quote but one point of similarity, abuse Yazid,  the Syrian tyrant, who caused the death of the Imam Husayn: this  expression of indignation is forbidden by the Hanafi doctors, who  rigidly order their disciples to \"judge not.\"  [FN#28] A systematic concealment of doctrine, and profession of popular  tenets, technically called by the Shi'ahs \"Takiyah:\" the literal  meaning of the word is \"fear,\" or \"caution.\"  [FN#29] One of the most esteemed chapters of the Koran, frequently  recited as a Wazifah or daily task by religious Moslems in Egypt.  [FN#30] The Mastabah here is a long earthen bench plastered over with  clay, and raised about two feet from the ground, so as to bring the  purchaser's head to a level with the shop. Mohammed Ali ordered the  people to remove them, as they narrowed the streets; their place is now  supplied by \"Kafas,\" cages or stools of wicker-work.  [FN#31] A great age in Lower Egypt, where but few reach the 12th  lustre. Even the ancients observed that the old Egyptians, despite  their attention to diet and physic, were the most short-lived, and the  Britons, despite their barbarism, the longest lived of men.  [FN#32] This is the \"imposition\" of Oxford and Cambridge.  [FN#33] The Hammam, or hot bath, being a kind of religious  establishment, is one of the class of things-so uncomfortably numerous  in Eastern countries-left 'ala jud'ak, \"to thy generosity.\"  Consequently, you are pretty sure to have something disagreeable there,  which you would vainly attempt to avoid by liberality. The best way to  deal with all such extortioners, with the Lawingi (undresser) of a  Cairo Hammam, or the \"jarvey\" of a London Hansom, is to find out the  fare, and never to go beyond it-never to be generous. The Hammam has  been too often noticed to bear another description: one point, however,  connected with it I must be allowed to notice. Mr. Lane (Modern  Egyptians) asserts that a Moslem should not pray nor recite the Koran  in it, as the bath is believed to be a favourite resort of Jinnis (or  genii). On the contrary, it is the custom of some sects to recite a  Ruk'atayn (two-bow) prayer immediately after religious ablution in the  hot cistern. This, however, is makruh, or improper without being  sinful, to the followers of Abu Hanifah. As a general rule, throughout  Al-Islam, the Farz (obligatory) prayers may be recited everywhere, no  matter how impure the place may be: but those belonging to the classes  sunnat (traditionary) and nafilah (supererogatory) are makruh, though  not actually unlawful, in certain localities. I venture this remark on  account of the extreme accuracy of the work referred to. A wonderful  contrast to the generality of Oriental books, it amply deserves a  revision in the rare places requiring care.  [FN#34] Europeans so seldom see the regular old Shaykh, whose place is  now taken by polite young men educated in England or France, that this  scene may be new even to those who have studied of late years on the  banks of the Nile.  [FN#35] This word is often used to signify simply \"yes.\" It is  corrupted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4658"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 2 (#17)"],[1,"the lips. The beard is represented by two tangled  tufts upon the chin; where whisker should be, the place is either bare  or is thinly covered with straggling pile.    The Badawin of Al-Hijaz are short men, about the height of the Indians  near Bombay, but weighing on an average a stone more. As usual in this  stage of society, stature varies little; you rarely see a giant, and  scarcely ever a dwarf. Deformity is checked by the Spartan restraint  upon population, and no weakly infant can live through a Badawi life.  The figure, though spare, is square and well knit; fulness of limb  seldom appears but about spring, when milk abounds: I have seen two or  three muscular figures, but never a fat man. The neck is sinewy, the  chest broad, the flank thin, and the stomach in-drawn; the legs, though  fleshless, are well made, especially when the knee and ankle are not  bowed by too early riding. The shins do not bend cucumber-like to the  front as in the African race.[FN#11] The arms are thin, with muscles  like whipcords, and the hands and feet are, in point of size and  delicacy, a link between Europe and India. As in the Celt, the Arab  thumb is remarkably long, extending almost to the first joint of the  index,[FN#12] which, with its easy rotation, makes it a perfect  prehensile instrument: the palm also is fleshless, small-boned, and  [p.84] elastic. With his small active figure, it is not strange that  the wildest Badawi gait should be pleasing; he neither unfits himself  for walking, nor distorts his ankles by turning out his toes according  to the farcical rule of fashion, and his shoulders are not dressed like  a drill-sergeants, to throw all the weight of the body upon the heels.  Yet there is no slouch in his walk; it is light and springy, and errs  only in one point, sometimes becoming a strut.    Such is the Badawi, and such he has been for ages. The national type  has been preserved by systematic intermarriage. The wild men do not  refuse their daughters to a stranger, but the son-in-law would be  forced to settle among them, and this life, which has its charms for a  while, ends in becoming wearisome. Here no evil results are anticipated  from the union of first cousins, and the experience of ages and of a  mighty nation may be trusted. Every Badawi has a right to marry his  fathers brothers daughter before she is given to a stranger; hence cousin  (Bint Amm) in polite phrase signifies a wife.[FN#13] Our  physiologists[FN#14] adduce the Sangre Azul of Spain and the case of  the lower animals to prove that degeneracy inevitably follows  breeding-in.[FN#15]    [p.85] Either they have theorised from insufficient facts, or  civilisation and artificial living exercise some peculiar influence, or  Arabia is a solitary exception to a general rule. The fact which I have  mentioned is patent to every Eastern traveller.    After this long description, the reader will perceive with pleasure  that we are approaching an interesting theme, the first question of  mankind to the wandererWhat are the women like? Truth compels me to state  that the women of the Hijazi Badawin are by no means comely. Although  the Benu Amur boast of some pretty girls, yet they are far inferior to  the high-bosomed beauties of Nijd. And I warn all men that if they run  to Al-Hijaz in search of the charming face which appears in my  sketch-book as a Badawi girl, they will be bitterly disappointed: the  dress was Arab, but it was worn by a fairy of the West. The Hijazi  womans eyes are fierce, her features harsh, and her face haggard; like  all people of the South, she soon fades, and in old age her appearance  is truly witch-like. Withered crones abound in the camps, where old men  are seldom seen. The sword and the sun are fatal to    A green old age, unconscious of decay.    The manners of the Badawin are free and simple: vulgarity and  affectation, awkwardness and embarrassment, are weeds of civilised  growth, unknown to the People of the Desert.[FN#16] Yet their manners  are sometimes dashed with a strange ceremoniousness. When two frends  meet, they either embrace or both extend the right hands, clapping palm  to palm; their foreheads are either pressed together, or their heads  are moved from side to side, whilst for minutes together mutual  inquiries are made and answered. It is a breach of decorum, even when  eating, to turn the back upon a person, and if a Badawi    [p.86] does it, he intends an insult. When a man prepares coffee, he  drinks the first cup: the Sharbat Kajari of the Persians, and the  Sulaymani of Egypt,[FN#17] render this precaution necessary. As a  friend approaches the camp,it is not done to strangers for fear of  startling them,those who catch sight of him shout out his name, and  gallop up saluting with lances or firing matchlocks in the air. This is  the well-known Laab al-Barut, or gunpowder play. Badawin are generally  polite in language, but in anger temper is soon shown, and, although  life be in peril, the foulest epithetsdog, drunkard, liar, and infidelare  discharged like pistol-shots by both disputants.    The best character of the Badawi is a truly noble compound of  determination, gentleness, and generosity. Usually they are a mixture  of worldly cunning and great simplicity, sensitive to touchiness,  good-tempered souls, solemn and dignified withal, fond of a jest, yet  of a grave turn of mind, easily managed by a laugh and a soft word, and  placable after passion, though madly revengeful after injury. It has  been sarcastically said of the Benu-Harb that there is not a man    Que sil ne violoit, voloit, tuoit, bruloit  Ne fut assez bonne personne.    The reader will inquire, like the critics of a certain modern  humourist, how the fabric of society can be supported by such material.  In the first place, it is a kind of societe leonine, in which the  fiercest, the strongest, and the craftiest obtains complete mastery  over his fellows, and this gives a    [p.87] keystone to the arch. Secondly, there is the terrible  blood-feud, which even the most reckless fear for their posterity. And,  thirdly, though the revealed law of the Koran, being insufficient for  the Desert, is openly disregarded, the immemorial customs of the Kazi  al-Arab (the Judge of the Arabs)[FN#18] form a system stringent in the  extreme.    The valour of the Badawi is fitful and uncertain. Man is by nature an  animal of prey, educated by the complicated relations of society, but  readily relapsing into his old habits. Ravenous and sanguinary  propensities grow apace in the Desert, but for the same reason the  recklessness of civilisation is unknown there. Savages and  semi-barbarians are always cautious, because they have nothing valuable  but their lives and limbs. The civilised man, on the contrary, has a  hundred wants or hopes or aims, without which existence has for him no  charms. Arab ideas of bravery do not prepossess us. Their romances,  full of foolhardy feats and impossible exploits, might charm for a  time, but would not become the standard works of a really fighting  people.[FN#19] Nor would a truly valorous race admire    [p.88] the cautious freebooters who safely fire down upon Caravans from  their eyries. Arab wars, too, are a succession of skirmishes, in which  five hundred men will retreat after losing a dozen of their number. In  this partisan-fighting the first charge secures a victory, and the  vanquished fly till covered by the shades of night. Then come cries and  taunts of women, deep oaths, wild poetry, excitement, and reprisals,  which will probably end in the flight of the former victor. When peace  is to be made, both parties count up their dead, and the usual  blood-money is paid for excess on either side. Generally, however, the  feud endures till, all becoming weary of it, some great man, as the  Sharif of Meccah, is called upon to settle the terms of a treaty, which  is nothing but an armistice. After a few months peace, a glance or a  word will draw blood, for these hates are old growths, and new  dissensions easily shoot up from them.    But, contemptible though their battles be, the Badawin are not cowards.  The habit of danger in raids and blood-feuds, the continual uncertainty  of existence, the desert, the chase, the hard life and exposure to the  air, blunting the nervous system; the presence and the practice of  weapons, horsemanship, sharpshooting, and martial exercises, habituate  them to look death in the face like men, and powerful motives will make  them heroes. The English, it is said, fight willingly for liberty, our  neighbours for glory; the Spaniard fights, or rather fought, for  religion and the Pundonor; and the Irishman fights for the fun of  fighting. Gain and revenge draw the Arabs sword; yet then he uses it  fitfully enough, without the gay gallantry of the  [p.89] French or the persistent stay of the Anglo-Saxon. To become  desperate he must have the all-powerful stimulants of honour and of  fanaticism. Frenzied by the insults of his women, or by the fear of  being branded as a coward, he is capable of any mad deed.[FN#20] And  the obstinacy produced by strong religious impressions gives a  steadfastness to his spirit unknown to mere enthusiasm. The history of  the Badawi tells this plainly. Some unobserving travellers, indeed,  have mistaken his exceeding cautiousness for stark cowardice. The  incongruity is easily read by one who understands the principles of  Badawi warfare; with them, as amongst the Red Indians, one death dims a  victory. And though reckless when their passions are thoroughly  aroused, though heedless of danger when the voice of honour calls them,  the Badawin will not sacrifice themselves for light motives. Besides,  they have, as has been said, another and a potent incentive to  cautiousness. Whenever peace is concluded, they must pay for victory.    There are two things which tend to soften the ferocity of Badawi"]]]
