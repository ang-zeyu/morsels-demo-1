Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"all, one can scarcely pity her, since she had not yet in reality known  that great passion which comes but once in life. So far she had learned  only a sort of feeble cynicism, which she expressed in letters and in  such sayings as these:    \"There are sweet errors which I would not venture to commit again. My  experiences, all too sad, have served to illumine my reason.\"    \"I am utterly weary of love and prodigiously tempted to have no more of  it for the rest of my life; because, after all, I don't wish either to  die or to go mad.\"    Yet she also said: \"I know too well that no one dies of grief.\"    She had had, indeed, some very unfortunate experiences. Men of rank had  loved her and had then cast her off. An actor, one Clavel, would have  married her, but she would not accept his offer. A magistrate in  Strasburg promised marriage; and then, when she was about to accept  him, he wrote to her that he was going to yield to the wishes of his  family and make a more advantageous alliance. And so she was  alternately caressed and repulsed--a mere plaything; and yet this was  probably all that she really needed at the time--something to stir her,  something to make her mournful or indignant or ashamed.    It was inevitable that at last Adrienne Lecouvreur should appear in  Paris. She had won such renown throughout the provinces that even those  who were intensely jealous of her were obliged to give her due  consideration. In 1717, when she was in her twenty-fifth year, she  became a member of the Comedie Franchise. There she made an immediate  and most brilliant impression. She easily took the leading place. She  was one of the glories of Paris, for she became the fashion outside the  theater. For the first time the great classic plays were given, not in  the monotonous singsong which had become a sort of theatrical  convention, but with all the fire and naturalness of life.    Being the fashion, Mlle. Lecouvreur elevated the social rank of actors  and of actresses. Her salon was thronged by men and women of rank.  Voltaire wrote poems in her honor. To be invited to her dinners was  almost like receiving a decoration from the king. She ought to have  been happy, for she had reached the summit of her profession and  something more.    Yet still she was unhappy. In all her letters one finds a plaintive  tone, a little moaning sound that shows how slightly her nature had  been changed. No longer, however, did she throw herself away upon  dullards or brutes. An English peer--Lord Peterborough--not realizing  that she was different from other actresses of that loose-lived age,  said to her coarsely at his first introduction:    \"Come now! Show me lots of wit and lots of love.\"    The remark was characteristic of the time. Yet Adrienne had learned at  least one thing, and that was the discontent which came from light  affairs. She had thrown herself away too often. If she could not love  with her entire being, if she could not give all that was in her to be  given, whether of her heart or mind or soul, then she would love no  more at all.    At this time there came to Paris a man remarkable in his own century,  and one who afterward became almost a hero of romance. This was  Maurice, Comte de Saxe, as the French called him, his German name and  title being Moritz, Graf von Sachsen, while we usually term him, in  English, Marshal Saxe. Maurice de Saxe was now, in 1721, entering his  twenty-fifth year. Already, though so young, his career had been a  strange one; and it was destined to be still more remarkable. He was  the natural son of Duke Augustus II. of Saxony, who later became King  of Poland, and who is known in history as Augustus the Strong.    Augustus was a giant in stature and in strength, handsome, daring,  unscrupulous, and yet extremely fascinating. His life was one of  revelry and fighting and display. When in his cups he would often call  for a horseshoe and twist it into a knot with his powerful fingers.  Many were his mistresses; but the one for whom he cared the most was a  beautiful and high-spirited Swedish girl of rank, Aurora von  Konigsmarck. She was descended from a rough old field-marshal who in  the Thirty Years' War had slashed and sacked and pillaged and plundered  to his heart's content. From him Aurora von Konigsmarck seemed to have  inherited a high spirit and a sort of lawlessness which charmed the  stalwart Augustus of Poland.    Their son, Maurice de Saxe, inherited everything that was good in his  parents, and a great deal that was less commendable. As a mere child of  twelve he had insisted on joining the army of Prince Eugene, and had  seen rough service in a very strenuous campaign. Two years later he  showed such daring on the battle-field that Prince Eugene summoned him  and paid him a compliment under the form of a rebuke.    \"Young man,\" he said, \"you must not mistake mere recklessness for  valor.\"    Before he was twenty he had attained the stature and strength of his  royal father; and, to prove it, he in his turn called for a horseshoe,  which he twisted and broke in his fingers. He fought on the side of the  Russians and Poles, and again against the Turks, everywhere displaying  high courage and also genius as a commander; for he never lost his  self-possession amid the very blackest danger, but possessed, as  Carlyle says, \"vigilance, foresight, and sagacious precaution.\"    Exceedingly handsome, Maurice was a master of all the arts that  pleased, with just a touch of roughness, which seemed not unfitting in  so gallant a soldier. His troops adored him and would follow wherever  he might choose to lead them; for he exercised over these rude men a  magnetic power resembling that of Napoleon in after years. In private  life he was a hard drinker and fond of every form of pleasure. Having  no fortune of his own, a marriage was arranged for him with the  Countess von Loben, who was immensely wealthy; but in three years he  had squandered all her money upon his pleasures, and had, moreover, got  himself heavily in debt.    It was at this time that he first came to Paris to study military  tactics. He had fought hard against the French in the wars that were  now ended; but his chivalrous bearing, his handsome person, and his  reckless joviality made him at once a universal favorite in Paris. To  the perfumed courtiers, with their laces and lovelocks and mincing  ways, Maurice de Saxe came as a sort of knight of old--jovial, daring,  pleasure-loving. Even his broken French was held to be quite charming;  and to see him break a horseshoe with his fingers threw every one into  raptures.    No wonder, then, that he was welcomed in the very highest circles.  Almost at once he attracted the notice of the Princesse de Conti, a  beautiful woman of the blood royal. Of her it has been said that she  was \"the personification of a kiss, the incarnation of an embrace, the  ideal of a dream of love.\" Her chestnut hair was tinted with little  gleams of gold. Her eyes were violet black. Her complexion was  dazzling. But by the king's orders she had been forced to marry a  hunchback--a man whose very limbs were so weakened by disease and evil  living that they would often fail to support him, and he would fall to  the ground, a writhing, screaming mass of ill-looking flesh.    It is not surprising that his lovely wife should have shuddered much at  his abuse of her and still more at his grotesque endearments. When her  eyes fell on Maurice de Saxe she saw in him one who could free her from  her bondage. By a skilful trick he led the Prince de Conti to invade  the sleeping-room of the princess, with servants, declaring that she  was not alone. The charge proved quite untrue, and so she left her  husband, having won the sympathy of her own world, which held that she  had been insulted. But it was not she who was destined to win and hold  the love of Maurice de Saxe.    Not long after his appearance in the French capital he was invited to  dine with the \"Queen of Paris,\" Adrienne Lecouvreur. Saxe had seen her  on the stage. He knew her previous history. He knew that she was very  much of a soiled dove; but when he met her these two natures, so  utterly dissimilar, leaped together, as it were, through the  indescribable attraction of opposites. He was big and powerful; she was  small and fragile. He was merry, and full of quips and jests; she was  reserved and melancholy. Each felt in the other a need supplied.    At one of their earliest meetings the climax came. Saxe was not the man  to hesitate; while she already, in her thoughts, had made a full  surrender. In one great sweep he gathered her into his arms. It  appeared to her as if no man had ever laid his hand upon her until that  moment. She cried out:    \"Now, for the first time in my life, I seem to live!\"    It was, indeed, the very first love which in her checkered career was  really worthy of the name. She had supposed that all such things were  passed and gone, that her heart was closed for ever, that she was  invulnerable; and yet here she found herself clinging about the neck of  this impetuous soldier and showing him all the shy fondness and the  unselfish devotion of a young girl. From this instant Adrienne  Lecouvreur never loved another man and never even looked at any other  man with the slightest interest. For nine long years the two were bound  together, though there were strange events to ruffle the surface of  their love.    Maurice de Saxe had been sired by a king. He had the lofty ambition to  be a king himself, and he felt the stirrings of that genius which in  after years was to make him a great soldier, and to win the brilliant  victory of Fontenoy, which to this very day the French are never tired  of recalling. Already Louis XV. had made him a marshal of France; and a  certain restlessness came over him. He loved Adrienne; yet he felt that  to remain in the enjoyment of her witcheries ought not to be the whole "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4693"],[0,"Famous Affinities of History: The Romance of Devotion. Vol 1-4, Complete (#17)"],[1,"of the stage and its mimic griefs  satisfied her only while she was actually upon the boards. Love offered  her an emotional excitement that endured and that was always changing.  It was \"the profoundest instinct of her being\"; and she once wrote:  \"What could one do in the world without loving?\"    Still, through these ten years she seems to have loved only that she  might be unhappy. There was a strange twist in her mind. Men who were  honorable and who loved her with sincerity she treated very badly. Men  who were indifferent or ungrateful or actually base she seemed to choose  by a sort of perverse instinct. Perhaps the explanation of it is that  during those ten years, though she had many lovers, she never really  loved. She sought excitement, passion, and after that the mournfulness  which comes when passion dies. Thus, one man after another came into her  life--some of them promising marriage--and she bore two children, whose  fathers were unknown, or at least uncertain. But, after all, one can  scarcely pity her, since she had not yet in reality known that great  passion which comes but once in life. So far she had learned only a sort  of feeble cynicism, which she expressed in letters and in such sayings  as these:    \"There are sweet errors which I would not venture to commit again. My  experiences, all too sad, have served to illumine my reason.\"    \"I am utterly weary of love and prodigiously tempted to have no more of  it for the rest of my life; because, after all, I don't wish either to  die or to go mad.\"    Yet she also said: \"I know too well that no one dies of grief.\"    She had had, indeed, some very unfortunate experiences.
