Nothing is more irreligious than to persecute the seekers of truth in  order to keep up absurdities and superstitions of bygone ages.  Nothing is more inhuman than the commission of 'devout cruelty' under  the mask of love of God and man.  Is it not the misfortune, not only  of Christianity, but of whole mankind, to have the Bible encumbered  with legendary histories, stories of miracles, and a crude cosmology,  which from time to time come in conflict with science?    The Buddhist Scriptures are also overloaded with Indian superstitions  and a crude cosmology, which pass under the name of Buddhism.  Accordingly, Buddhist scholars have confused not seldom the doctrine  of the Buddha with these absurdities, and thought it impious to  abandon them.  Kaiseki,[FN#121] for instance, was at a loss to  distinguish Buddhism from the Indian astronomy, which is utterly  untenable in the face of the fact.  He taxed his reason to the utmost  to demonstrate the Indian theory and at the same time to refute the  Copernican theory.  One day he called on Yeki-do[FN#122] a  contemporary Zen master, and explained the construction of the Three  Worlds as described in the Scriptures, saying that Buddhism would  come to naught if the theory of the Three Worlds be overthrown by the  Copernican. Then Yeki-do exclaimed: \"Buddhism aims to destroy the  Three Worlds and to establish Buddha's Holy Kingdom throughout the  universe.  Why do you waste your energy in the construction of the  Three Worlds?\"[FN#123]      [FN#121]  A learned Japanese Buddhist scholar, who died in 1882.    [FN#122]  A famous Zen master, the abbot of the So-ji-ji Monastery,  who died in 1879.    [FN#123]  Kin-sei-zen-rin-gen-ko-roku.      In this way Zen does not trouble itself about unessentials of the  Scriptures, on which it never depends for its authority.  Do-gen, the  founder of the Japanese So To Sect, severely condemns (in his  Sho-bo-gen-zo) the notions of the impurity of women inculcated in the  Scriptures.  He openly attacks those Chinese monks who swore that  they would not see any woman, and ridicules those who laid down rules  prohibiting women from getting access to monasteries.  A Zen master  was asked by a Samurai whether there was hell in sooth as taught in  the Scriptures.  \"I must ask you,\" replied he, \"before I give you an  answer.  For what purpose is your question?  What business have you,  a Samurai, with a thing of that sort?  Why do you bother yourself  about such an idle question?  Surely you neglect your duty and are  engaged in such a fruitless research.  Does this not amount to your  stealing the annual salary from your lord?\"  The Samurai, offended  not a little with these rebukes, stared at the master, ready to draw  his sword at another insult.  Then the teacher said smilingly: \"Now  you are in Hell.  Don't you see?\"    Does, then, Zen use no scripture?  To this question we answer both  affirmatively and negatively: negatively, because Zen regards all  sutras as a sort of pictured food which has no power of appeasing  spiritual hunger; affirmatively, because it freely makes use of them  irrespective of Mahayana or Hinayana.  Zen would not make a bonfire  of the Scriptures as Caliph Omar did of the Alexandrian library.  A  Zen master, having seen a Confucianist burning his books on the  thought that they were rather a hindrance to his spiritual growth,  observed: \"You had better burn your books in mind and heart, but not  the books in black and white.\"[FN#124]      [FN#124]  Ukiyo-soshi.      As even deadly poison proves to be medicine in the band of a good  doctor, so a heterodox doctrine antagonistic to Buddhism is used by  the Zen teachers as a finger pointing to the principle of Zen.  But  they as a rule resorted to Lankavatara-sutra,[FN#125]  Vajracchedika-prajnya-paramita-sutra,[FN#126]  Vimalakirtti-nirdeca-sutra[FN#127]  Mahavaipulya-purnabuddha-sutra[FN#128]  Mababuddhosnisa-tathagata-guhyahetu-saksatkrta-prasannatha-sarvabhodhi  sattvacarya-surangama-sutra,[FN#129] Mahapari-nirvana-sutra,[FN#130]  Saddharma-pundarika-sutra, Avatamsaka-sutra, and so forth.      [FN#125]  This book is the nearest approach to the doctrine of Zen,  and is said to have been pointed out by Bodhidharma as the best book  for the use of his followers.  See Nanjo's Catalogue, Nos. 175, 1761  177.    [FN#126]  The author of the sutra insists on the unreality of all  things.  The book was first used by the Fifth Patriarch, as we have  seen in the first chapter.  See Nanjo's Catalogue, Nos. 10, 11, 12,  13, 14, 15.    [FN#127]   The sutra agrees with Zen in many respects, especially in  its maintaining that the highest truth can only be realized in mind,  and cannot be expressed by word of mouth.  See Nanjo's Catalogue,  Nos. 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149.    [FN#128]  The sutra was translated into Chinese by Buddhatrata in the  seventh century.  The author treats at length of Samadhi, and sets  forth a doctrine similar to Zen, so that the text was used by many  Chinese Zenists.  See Nanjo's Catalogue, Nos. 427 and 1629.    [FN#129]  The sutra was translated into Chinese by Paramiti and  Mikacakya, of the Tang dynasty (618-907).  The author conceives  Reality as Mind or Spirit.  The book belongs to the Mantra class,  although it is much used by Zenists.  See Nanjo's Catalogue, No. 446.    [FN#130]  The author of the book sets forth his own conception of  Nirvana and of Buddha, and maintains that all beings are endowed with  Buddha-nature.  He also gives in detail an incredible account about  Gotama's death.        5. A Sutra Equal in Size to the Whole World.    The holy writ that Zen masters admire is not one of parchment nor of  palm-leaves, nor in black and white, but one written in heart and  mind.  On one occasion a King of Eastern India invited the venerable  Prajnyatara, the teacher of Bodhidharma, and his disciples to dinner  at his own palace.    Finding all the monks reciting the sacred sutras with the single  exception of the master, the King questioned Prajnyatara: \"Why do you  not, reverend sir, recite the Scriptures as others do?\"  \"My poor  self, your majesty,\" replied he, \"does not go out to the objects of  sense in my expiration nor is it confined within body and mind in my  inspiration.  Thus I constantly recite hundreds, thousands, and  millions of sacred sutras.\"  In like manner the Emperor Wu, of the  Liang dynasty, once requested Chwen Hih (Fu Dai-shi) to give a  lecture on the Scriptures.  Chwen went upon the platform, struck the  desk with a block of wood, and came down.  Pao Chi (Ho-shi), a  Buddhist tutor to the Emperor, asked the perplexed monarch: \"Does  your Lordship understand him?\"  \"No,\" answered His Majesty.  \"The  lecture of the Great Teacher is over.\"  As it is clear to you from  these examples, Zen holds that the faith must be based not on the  dead Scriptures, but on living facts, that one must turn over not the  gilt pages of the holy writ, but read between the lines in the holy  pages of daily life, that Buddha must be prayed not by word of mouth,  but by actual deed and work, and that one must split open, as the  author of Avatamsaka-sutra allegorically tells us, the smallest grain  of dirt to find therein a sutra equal in size to the whole world.  \"The so-called sutra,\" says Do-gen, \"covers the whole universe. It  transcends time and space.  It is written with the characters of  heaven, of man, of beasts, of Asuras,[FN#13l] of hundreds of grass,  and of thousands of trees.  There are characters, some long, some  short, some round, some square, some blue, some red, some yellow, and  some white-in short, all the phenomena in the universe are the  characters with which the sutra is written.\"  Shakya Muni read that  sutra through the bright star illuminating the broad expanse of the  morning skies, when he sat in meditation under the Bodhi Tree.      [FN#13l]  The name of a demon.      Ling Yun (Rei-un) read it through the lovely flowers of a peach-tree  in spring after some twenty years of his research for Light, and said:    \"A score of years I looked for Light:  There came and went many a spring and fall.  E'er since the peach blossoms came in my sight,  I never doubt anything at all.\"    Hian Yen (Kyo-gen) read it through the noise of bamboo, at which he  threw pebbles.  Su Shih (So-shoku) read it through a waterfall, one  evening, and said:    \"The brook speaks forth the Tathagata's words divine,  The hills reveal His glorious forms that shine.\"        6. Great Men and Nature.    All great men, whether they be poets or scientists or religious men  or philosophers, are not mere readers of books, but the perusers of  Nature.  Men of erudition are often lexicons in flesh and blood, but  men of genius read between the lines in the pages of life.  Kant, a  man of no great erudition, could accomplish in the theory of  knowledge what Copernicus did in astronomy.  Newton found the law of  gravitation not in a written page, but in a falling apple.  Unlettered Jesus realized truth beyond the comprehension of many  learned doctors.  Charles Darwin, whose theory changed the whole  current of the world's thought, was not a great reader of books, but  a careful observer of facts.  Shakespeare, the greatest of poets, was  the greatest reader of Nature and life.  He could hear the music even  of heavenly bodies, and said:    \"There's not the smallest orb which thou beholdest,  But in his motion like an angel sings.\"    Chwang Tsz (So-shi), the greatest of Chinese philosophers, says:  \"Thou knowest the music of men, but not the music of the earth. Thou  knowest the music of the earth, but not the music of the  heaven.\"[FN#132]   Goethe, perceiving a profound meaning in Nature,  says: \"Flowers are the beautiful hieroglyphics of Nature with which  she indicates how much she loves us.\"      [FN#132]  Chwang Tsz, vol. i., p. 10.      Son-toku[FN#133] (Ninomiya), a great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/518"],[0,"The Enchanted Island of Yew (#17)"],[1,"the blond ones both  flushed with humiliation and anger, and said:    \"The captains fought against you, even as we did.\"    \"Yet the captains only obeyed your orders,\" returned the High Ki.  \"So  I hold them blameless.\"    \"And what is to become of us now?\" asked the former Ki-Ki.    \"You will belong to the common people, and earn your living playing  tunes for them to dance by,\" answered the High Ki.  And at this retort  every one laughed, so that the handsome youths turned away with twin  scowls upon their faces and departed amidst the jeers of the crowd.    \"Better hang 'em to a tree, little one,\" shouted Wul-Takim, in his big  voice; \"they won't enjoy life much, anyhow.\"    But the maid shook her pretty head and turned to the prince.    \"Will you stay here and help me to rule my kingdom?\" she asked.    \"I can not do that,\" replied Prince Marvel, \"for I am but a wandering  adventurer and must soon continue my travels.  But I believe you will  be able to rule your people without my help.\"    \"It is not so easy a task,\" she answered, sighing.  \"For I am singular  and my people are all double.\"    \"Well, let us hold a meeting in your palace,\" said the prince, \"and  then we can decide what is best to be done.\"    So they dismissed the people, who cheered their High Ki  enthusiastically, returning quietly to their daily tasks and the gossip  that was sure to follow such important events as they had witnessed.    The army of King Terribus and the fifty-nine reformed thieves went to  the twin palaces of the Ki and the Ki-Ki and made merry with feasting  and songs to celebrate their conquest.  And the High Ki, followed by  the prince, Nerle, King Terribus and Wul-Takim, as well as by the Ki  and the newly-appointed Ki-Ki, mounted the silver steps and passed over  the wall to the royal palaces.  The green High Ki followed them, still  weeping disconsolately.    When they had all reached the throne-room, the High Ki seated herself  on one of the beautiful thrones and said:    \"By some strange chance, which I am unable to explain, my twin and I  have become separated; so that instead of thinking and acting alike, we  are now individuals--as are all the strange men who have passed through  the hole in the hedge.  And, being individuals, we can no longer agree,  nor can one of us lawfully rule over the Kingdom of Twi, where all the  subjects are twins, thinking and acting in unison.\"    Said Prince Marvel:    \"Your Highness, I alone can explain why you became separated from your  twin.  By means of a fairy enchantment, which I learned years ago, I  worked upon you a spell, which compelled your brain to work independent  of your sister's brain.  It seems to me that it is better each person  should think her own thoughts and live her own life, rather than be  yoked to another person and obliged to think and act as a twin, or  one-half of a complete whole.  And since you are now the one High Ki,  and the acknowledged ruler of this country, I will agree to work the  same fairy spell on all your people, so that no longer will there be  twin minds in all this Land of Twi.\"    \"But all the cows and dogs and horses and other animals are double, as  well as the people,\" suggested the old Ki, blinking their little eyes  in amazement at the thought of being forever separated from each other.    \"I can also work the spell upon all the twin animals,\" said the prince,  after a moment's hesitation.    \"And all our houses are built double, with twin doors and windows and  chimneys, to accommodate our twin people,\" continued the High Ki.  \"And  the trees and flowers--and even the blades of grass--are all double.  And our roads are double, and--and everything else is double.  I alone,  the ruler of this land, am singular!\"    Prince Marvel became thoughtful now, for he did not know how to  separate trees and flowers, and it would be a tedious task to separate  the twin houses.    \"Why not leave the country as it is?\" asked King Terribus of Spor.  \"The High Ki is welcome to come to my castle to live, and then she need  no longer bother about the Land of Twi, which seems to me a poor place,  after all.\"    \"And your sister may come with me to my cave, and be the queen of the  reformed thieves, which is a much more important office than being High  Ki of Twi,\" added big Wul-Takim, who had placed the maiden in green  upon a cushion at his feet, and was striving to comfort her by gently  stroking her silken hair with his rough hand.    \"But I love my country, and do not wish to leave it,\" answered the  yellow High Ki.  \"And I love my twin sister, and regret that our minds  have become separated,\" she continued, sadly.    \"I have it!\" exclaimed Nerle.  \"Let the prince reunite you, making you  regular twins of Twi again, and then you can continue to rule the  country as the double High Ki, and everything will be as it was before.\"    The yellow High Ki clapped her pink hands with delight and looked  eagerly at the prince.    \"Will you?\" she asked.  \"Will you please reunite us?  And then all our  troubles will be ended!\"    This really seemed to Marvel the best thing to be done.  So he led the  maid in green to the other throne, where she had once sat, and after  replacing the golden crown upon her brow he whispered a fairy spell of  much mystical power.    Then the prince stepped back and regarded the maidens earnestly, and  after a moment both the High Ki smiled upon him in unison and  said--speaking the same words in the same voices and with the same  accents:    \"Thank you very much!\"        20.  Kwytoffle, the Tyrant    Having restored the High Ki to their former condition, to the great joy  of the ancient Ki, Prince Marvel led his friends back to the palaces  where his men were waiting.    They were just in time to prevent serious trouble, for the fifty-eight  reformed thieves had been boasting of their prowess to the huge giants  and tiny dwarfs of King Terribus, and this had resulted in a quarrel as  to which were the best fighters.  Had not their masters arrived at the  right moment there would certainly have been a fierce battle and much  bloodshed,--and all over something of no importance.    Terribus and Wul-Takim soon restored order, and then they accompanied  the Ki and the Ki-Ki to the public square, where the people were  informed that their Supreme Highnesses, the High Ki, had been reunited  and would thereafter rule them with twin minds as well as twin bodies.  There was great rejoicing at this news, for every twin in Twi was glad  to have his troubles ended so easily and satisfactorily.    That night the ryls and knooks and other invisible friends of Prince  Marvel came and removed the dividing wall between the twin palaces of  the High Ki, repairing speedily all the damage that had been done.  And  when our friends called upon the High Ki the next morning they found  the two maids again dressed exactly alike in yellow robes, with strings  of sparkling emeralds for ornament.  And not even Prince Marvel could  now tell one of the High Ki from the other.    As for the maids themselves, it seemed difficult to imagine they had  ever existed apart for a single moment.    They were very pleasant and agreeable to their new friends, and when  they heard that Prince Marvel was about to leave them to seek new  adventures they said:    \"Please take us with you!  It seems to us that we ought to know  something of the big outside world from whence you came.  If we see  other kingdoms and people we shall be better able to rule our own  wisely.\"    \"That seems reasonable,\" answered Marvel, \"and I shall be very glad to  have you accompany me.  But who will rule the Land of Twi in your  absence?\"    \"The Ki-Ki shall be the rulers,\" answered the High Ki, \"and we will  take the Ki with us.\"    \"Then I will delay my departure until to-morrow morning,\" said the  prince, \"in order that your Highnesses may have time to prepare for the  journey.\"    And then he went back to the palaces of the other rulers, where the Ki  expressed themselves greatly pleased at the idea of traveling, and the  new Ki-Ki were proud to learn they should rule for some time the Land  of Twi.    Wul-Takim also begged to join the party, and so also did King Terribus,  who had never before been outside of his own Kingdom of Spor; so Prince  Marvel willingly consented.    The fifty-eight reformed thieves, led by Gunder, returned to their  cave, where they were living comfortably on the treasure Prince Marvel  had given them; and the Gray Men and giants and dwarfs of Spor departed  for their own country.    In the morning Prince Marvel led his own gay cavalcade through the hole  in the hedge, and they rode merrily away in search of adventure.    By his side were the High Ki, mounted upon twin chestnut ponies that  had remarkably slender limbs and graceful, arched necks.  The ponies  moved with exactly the same steps, and shook their manes and swished  their tails at exactly the same time.  Behind the prince and the High  Ki were King Terribus, riding his great white charger, and Wul-Takim on  a stout horse of jet-black color.  The two ancient Ki and Nerle, being  of lesser rank than the others, brought up the rear.    \"When we return to our Land of Twi,\" said the High Ki, \"we shall close  up for all time the hole you made in the hedge; for, if we are  different from the rest of the world, it is better that we remain in  seclusion.\"    \"I think it is right you should do that,\" replied Prince Marvel.  \"Yet  I do not regret that I cut a hole in your hedge.\"    \"It was the hedge that delayed us in coming more promptly to your  assistance,\" said Terribus; \"for we had hard work to find the hole you  had made, and so lost much valuable time.\"    \"All is well that ends well!\" laughed the prince.  \"You certainly came  in good time to rescue us from our difficulties.\"    They turned into a path that led to Auriel, which Nerle had heard  spoken of as \"the Kingdom of the Setting Sun.\"   "]]]
