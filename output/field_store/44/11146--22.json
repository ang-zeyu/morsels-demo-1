[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7452"],[0,"Autobiography of a Yogi (#17)"],[1,"by the arrival of a conceited acquaintance  who burdened us with a lengthy discourse.    \"I see this man doesn't please you.\" The saint's whisper to me was  unheard by the egotist, spellbound by his own monologue. \"I have  spoken to Divine Mother about it; She realizes our sad predicament.  As soon as we get to yonder red house, She has promised to remind  him of more urgent business.\"    My eyes were glued to the site of salvation. Reaching its red gate,  the man unaccountably turned and departed, neither finishing his  sentence nor saying good-by. The assaulted air was comforted with  peace.    Another day found me walking alone near the Howrah railway station.  I stood for a moment by a temple, silently criticizing a small group  of men with drum and cymbals who were violently reciting a chant.    \"How undevotionally they use the Lord's divine name in mechanical  repetition,\" I reflected. My gaze was astonished by the rapid  approach of Master Mahasaya. \"Sir, how come you here?\"    The saint, ignoring my question, answered my thought. \"Isn't it  true, little sir, that the Beloved's name sounds sweet from all  lips, ignorant or wise?\" He passed his arm around me affectionately;  I found myself carried on his magic carpet to the Merciful Presence.    \"Would you like to see some bioscopes?\" This question one afternoon  from Master Mahasaya was mystifying; the term was then used in India  to signify motion pictures. I agreed, glad to be in his company in  any circumstances. A brisk walk brought us to the garden fronting  Calcutta University. My companion indicated a bench near the GOLDIGHI  or pond.    \"Let us sit here for a few minutes. My Master always asked me  to meditate whenever I saw an expanse of water. Here its placidity  reminds us of the vast calmness of God. As all things can be  reflected in water, so the whole universe is mirrored in the lake  of the Cosmic Mind. So my GURUDEVA often said.\"    Soon we entered a university hall where a lecture was in progress.  It proved abysmally dull, though varied occasionally by lantern  slide illustrations, equally uninteresting.    \"So this is the kind of bioscope the master wanted me to see!\" My  thought was impatient, yet I would not hurt the saint by revealing  boredom in my face. But he leaned toward me confidentially.    \"I see, little sir, that you don't like this bioscope. I have  mentioned it to Divine Mother; She is in full sympathy with us  both.  She tells me that the electric lights will now go out, and  won't be relit until we have a chance to leave the room.\"    As his whisper ended, the hall was plunged into darkness. The  professor's strident voice was stilled in astonishment, then remarked,  \"The electrical system of this hall appears to be defective.\" By  this time, Master Mahasaya and I were safely across the threshold.  Glancing back from the corridor, I saw that the scene of our  martyrdom had again become illuminated.    \"Little sir, you were disappointed in that bioscope, {FN9-2} but I  think you will like a different one.\" The saint and I were standing  on the sidewalk in front of the university building. He gently  slapped my chest over the heart.    A transforming silence ensued. Just as the modern \"talkies\" become  inaudible motion pictures when the sound apparatus goes out of  order, so the Divine Hand, by some strange miracle, stifled the  earthly bustle. The pedestrians as well as the passing trolley cars,  automobiles, bullock carts, and iron-wheeled hackney carriages were  all in noiseless transit. As though possessing an omnipresent eye,  I beheld the scenes which were behind me, and to each side, as  easily as those in front. The whole spectacle of activity in that  small section of Calcutta passed before me without a sound. Like  a glow of fire dimly seen beneath a thin coat of ashes, a mellow  luminescence permeated the panoramic view.    My own body seemed nothing more than one of the many shadows,  though it was motionless, while the others flitted mutely to and  fro. Several boys, friends of mine, approached and passed on; though  they had looked directly at me, it was without recognition.    The unique pantomime brought me an inexpressible ecstasy. I drank  deep from some blissful fount. Suddenly my chest received another  soft blow from Master Mahasaya. The pandemonium of the world burst  upon my unwilling ears. I staggered, as though harshly awakened  from a gossamer dream. The transcendental wine removed beyond my  reach.    \"Little sir, I see you found the second bioscope to your liking.\"  The saint was smiling; I started to drop in gratitude on the ground  before him. \"You can't do that to me now; you know God is in your  temple also! I won't let Divine Mother touch my feet through your  hands!\"    If anyone observed the unpretentious master and myself as we walked  away from the crowded pavement, the onlooker surely suspected  us of intoxication. I felt that the falling shades of evening  were sympathetically drunk with God. When darkness recovered from  its nightly swoon, I faced the new morning bereft of my ecstatic  mood. But ever enshrined in memory is the seraphic son of Divine  Mother-Master Mahasaya!    Trying with poor words to do justice to his benignity, I wonder if  Master Mahasaya, and others among the deep-visioned saints whose  paths crossed mine, knew that years later, in a Western land,  I would be writing about their lives as divine devotees. Their  foreknowledge would not surprise me nor, I hope, my readers, who  have come thus far with me.    {FN9-1} These are respectful titles by which he was customarily  addressed. His name was Mahendra Nath Gupta; he signed his literary  works simply \"M.\"    {FN9-2} The Oxford English Dictionary gives, as rare, this definition  of BIOSCOPE: A view of life; that which gives such a view.    Master Mahasaya's choice of a word was, then, peculiarly justified.        CHAPTER: 10    I MEET MY MASTER, SRI YUKTESWAR    \"Faith in God can produce any miracle except one-passing an  examination without study.\" Distastefully I closed the book I had  picked up in an idle moment.    \"The writer's exception shows his complete lack of faith,\" I thought.  \"Poor chap, he has great respect for the midnight oil!\"    My promise to Father had been that I would complete my high school  studies. I cannot pretend to diligence. The passing months found me  less frequently in the classroom than in secluded spots along the  Calcutta bathing GHATS. The adjoining crematory grounds, especially  gruesome at night, are considered highly attractive by the yogi.  He who would find the Deathless Essence must not be dismayed by a  few unadorned skulls. Human inadequacy becomes clear in the gloomy  abode of miscellaneous bones. My midnight vigils were thus of a  different nature from the scholar's.    The week of final examinations at the Hindu High School was fast  approaching. This interrogatory period, like the sepulchral haunts,  inspires a well-known terror. My mind was nevertheless at peace.  Braving the ghouls, I was exhuming a knowledge not found in lecture  halls. But it lacked the art of Swami Pranabananda, who easily  appeared in two places at one time. My educational dilemma was  plainly a matter for the Infinite Ingenuity. This was my reasoning,  though to many it seems illogic. The devotee's irrationality springs  from a thousand inexplicable demonstrations of God's instancy in  trouble.    \"Hello, Mukunda! I catch hardly a glimpse of you these days!\" A  classmate accosted me one afternoon on Gurpar Road.    \"Hello, Nantu! My invisibility at school has actually placed me  there in a decidedly awkward position.\" I unburdened myself under  his friendly gaze.    Nantu, who was a brilliant student, laughed heartily; my predicament  was not without a comic aspect.    \"You are utterly unprepared for the finals! I suppose it is up to  me to help you!\"    The simple words conveyed divine promise to my ears; with alacrity  I visited my friend's home. He kindly outlined the solutions to  various problems he considered likely to be set by the instructors.    \"These questions are the bait which will catch many trusting boys  in the examination trap. Remember my answers, and you will escape  without injury.\"    The night was far gone when I departed. Bursting with unseasoned  erudition, I devoutly prayed it would remain for the next few  critical days. Nantu had coached me in my various subjects but,  under press of time, had forgotten my course in Sanskrit. Fervently  I reminded God of the oversight.    I set out on a short walk the next morning, assimilating my new  knowledge to the rhythm of swinging footsteps. As I took a short  cut through the weeds of a corner lot, my eye fell on a few loose  printed sheets. A triumphant pounce proved them to be Sanskrit verse.  I sought out a pundit for aid in my stumbling interpretation. His  rich voice filled the air with the edgeless, honeyed beauty of the  ancient tongue. {FN10-1}    \"These exceptional stanzas cannot possibly be of aid in your Sanskrit  test.\" The scholar dismissed them skeptically.    But familiarity with that particular poem enabled me on the following  day to pass the Sanskrit examination. Through the discerning help  Nantu had given, I also attained the minimum grade for success in  all my other subjects.    Father was pleased that I had kept my word and concluded my secondary  school course. My gratitude sped to the Lord, whose sole guidance  I perceived in my visit to Nantu and my walk by the unhabitual route  of the debris-filled lot. Playfully He had given a dual expression  to His timely design for my rescue.    I came across the discarded book whose author had denied God  precedence in the examination halls. I could not restrain a chuckle  at my own silent comment:    \"It would only add to this fellow's confusion, if I were to tell  him that divine meditation among the cadavers is a short cut to a  high school diploma!\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7471"],[0,"The Man with Two Left Feet, and Other Stories (#17)"],[1,".    They walked on in silence. Katie's heart was beating with a rapidity  that forbade speech. Nothing like this very direct young man had ever  happened to her before. She had grown so accustomed to regarding  herself as something too insignificant and unattractive for the notice  of the lordly male that she was overwhelmed. She had a vague feeling  that there was a mistake somewhere. It surely could not be she who was  proving so alluring to this fairy prince. The novelty of the situation  frightened her.    'Come here often?' asked her companion.    'I've never been here before.'    'Often go to Coney?'    'I've never been.'    He regarded her with astonishment.    'You've never been to Coney Island! Why, you don't know what this sort  of thing is till you've taken in Coney. This place isn't on the map  with Coney. Do you mean to say you've never seen Luna Park, or  Dreamland, or Steeplechase, or the diving ducks? Haven't you had a look  at the Mardi Gras stunts? Why, Coney during Mardi Gras is the greatest  thing on earth. It's a knockout. Just about a million boys and girls  having the best time that ever was. Say, I guess you don't go out much,  do you?'    'Not much.'    'If it's not a rude question, what do you do? I been trying to place you  all along. Now I reckon your friend works in a store, don't she?'    'Yes. She's a cloak-model. She has a lovely figure, hasn't she?'    'Didn't notice it. I guess so, if she's what you say. It's what they  pay her for, ain't it? Do you work in a store, too?'    'Not exactly. I keep a little shop.'    'All by yourself?'    'I do all the work now. It was my father's shop, but he's dead. It  began by being my grandfather's. He started it. But he's so old now  that, of course, he can't work any longer, so I look after things.'    'Say, you're a wonder! What sort of a shop?'    'It's only a little second-hand bookshop. There really isn't much to  do.'    'Where is it?'    'Sixth Avenue. Near Washington Square.'    'What name?'    'Bennett.'    'That's your name, then?'    'Yes.'    'Anything besides Bennett?'    'My name's Kate.'    The young man nodded.    'I'd make a pretty good district attorney,' he said, disarming possible  resentment at this cross-examination. 'I guess you're wondering if I'm  ever going to stop asking you questions. Well, what would you like to  do?'    'Don't you think we ought to go back and find your friend and  Genevieve? They will be wondering where we are.'    'Let 'em,' said the young man briefly. 'I've had all I want of Jenny.'    'I can't understand why you don't like her.'    'I like you. Shall we have some ice-cream, or would you rather go on  the Scenic Railway?'    Katie decided on the more peaceful pleasure. They resumed their walk,  socially licking two cones. Out of the corner of her eyes Katie cast  swift glances at her friend's face. He was a very grave young man.  There was something important as well as handsome about him. Once, as  they made their way through the crowds, she saw a couple of boys look  almost reverently at him. She wondered who he could be, but was too shy  to inquire. She had got over her nervousness to a great extent, but  there were still limits to what she felt herself equal to saying. It  did not strike her that it was only fair that she should ask a few  questions in return for those which he had put. She had always  repressed herself, and she did so now. She was content to be with him  without finding out his name and history.    He supplied the former just before he finally consented to let her go.    They were standing looking over the river. The sun had spent its force,  and it was cool and pleasant in the breeze which was coming up the  Hudson. Katie was conscious of a vague feeling that was almost  melancholy. It had been a lovely afternoon, and she was sorry that it  was over.    The young man shuffled his feet on the loose stones.    'I'm mighty glad I met you,' he said. 'Say, I'm coming to see you. On  Sixth Avenue. Don't mind, do you?'    He did not wait for a reply.    'Brady's my name. Ted Brady, Glencoe Athletic Club,' he paused. 'I'm on  the level,' he added, and paused again. 'I like you a whole lot. There's  your friend, Genevieve. Better go after her, hadn't you? Good-bye.' And  he was gone, walking swiftly through the crowd about the bandstand.    Katie went back to Genevieve, and Genevieve was simply horrid. Cold and  haughty, a beautiful iceberg of dudgeon, she refused to speak a single  word during the whole long journey back to Sixth Avenue. And Katie,  whose tender heart would at other times have been tortured by this  hostility, leant back in her seat, and was happy. Her mind was far away  from Genevieve's frozen gloom, living over again the wonderful  happenings of the afternoon.    Yes, it had been a wonderful afternoon, but trouble was waiting for her  in Sixth Avenue. Trouble was never absent for very long from Katie's  unselfish life. Arriving at the little bookshop, she found Mr Murdoch,  the glazier, preparing for departure. Mr Murdoch came in on Mondays,  Wednesdays, and Fridays to play draughts with her grandfather, who was  paralysed from the waist, and unable to leave the house except when  Katie took him for his outing in Washington Square each morning in his  bath-chair.    Mr Murdoch welcomed Katie with joy.    'I was wondering whenever you would come back, Katie. I'm afraid the  old man's a little upset.'    'Not ill?'    'Not ill. Upset. And it was my fault, too. Thinking he'd be interested,  I read him a piece from the paper where I seen about these English  Suffragettes, and he just went up in the air. I guess he'll be all  right now you've come back. I was a fool to read it, I reckon. I kind  of forgot for the moment.'    'Please don't worry yourself about it, Mr Murdoch. He'll be all right  soon. I'll go to him.'    In the inner room the old man was sitting. His face was flushed, and he  gesticulated from time to time.    'I won't have it,' he cried as Katie entered. 'I tell you I won't have  it. If Parliament can't do anything, I'll send Parliament about its  business.'    'Here I am, grandpapa,' said Katie quickly. 'I've had the greatest  time. It was lovely up there. I--'    'I tell you it's got to stop. I've spoken about it before. I won't have  it.'    'I expect they're doing their best. It's your being so far away that  makes it hard for them. But I do think you might write them a very  sharp letter.'    'I will. I will. Get out the paper. Are you ready?' He stopped, and  looked piteously at Katie. 'I don't know what to say. I don't know how  to begin.'    Katie scribbled a few lines.    'How would this do? \"His Majesty informs his Government that he is  greatly surprised and indignant that no notice has been taken of his  previous communications. If this goes on, he will be reluctantly  compelled to put the matter in other hands.\"'    She read it glibly as she had written it. The formula had been a  favourite one of her late father, when roused to fall upon offending  patrons of the bookshop.    The old man beamed. His resentment was gone. He was soothed and happy.    'That'll wake 'em up,' he said. 'I won't have these goings on while I'm  king, and if they don't like it, they know what to do. You're a good  girl, Katie.'    He chuckled.    'I beat Lord Murdoch five games to nothing,' he said.    It was now nearly two years since the morning when old Matthew Bennett  had announced to an audience consisting of Katie and a smoky blue cat,  which had wandered in from Washington Square to take pot-luck, that he  was the King of England.    This was a long time for any one delusion of the old man's to last.  Usually they came and went with a rapidity which made it hard for  Katie, for all her tact, to keep abreast of them. She was not likely to  forget the time when he went to bed President Roosevelt and woke up the  Prophet Elijah. It was the only occasion in all the years they had  passed together when she had felt like giving way and indulging in the  fit of hysterics which most girls of her age would have had as a matter  of course.    She had handled that crisis, and she handled the present one with equal  smoothness. When her grandfather made his announcement, which he did  rather as one stating a generally recognized fact than as if the  information were in any way sensational, she neither screamed nor  swooned, nor did she rush to the neighbours for advice. She merely gave  the old man his breakfast, not forgetting to set aside a suitable  portion for the smoky cat, and then went round to notify Mr Murdoch of  what had happened.    Mr Murdoch, excellent man, received the news without any fuss or  excitement at all, and promised to look in on Schwartz, the stout  saloon-keeper, who was Mr Bennett's companion and antagonist at  draughts on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and, as he expressed  it, put him wise.    Life ran comfortably in the new groove. Old Mr Bennett continued to  play draughts and pore over his second-hand classics. Every morning he  took his outing in Washington Square where, from his invalid's chair,  he surveyed somnolent Italians and roller-skating children with his old  air of kindly approval. Katie, whom circumstances had taught to be  thankful for small mercies, was perfectly happy in the shadow of the  throne. She liked her work; she liked looking after her grandfather;  and now that Ted Brady had come into her life, she really began to look  on herself as an exceptionally lucky girl, a spoilt favourite of  Fortune.    For Ted Brady had called, as he said he would, and from the very first  he had made plain in his grave, direct way the objects of his visits.  There was no subtlety about Ted, no finesse. He was as frank as a  music-hall love song.    On his first visit, having handed Katie a large bunch of roses with the  stolidity of a messenger boy handing over a parcel, he had proceeded,  by way of establishing his"]]]
