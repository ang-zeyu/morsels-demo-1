I'm  delighted to have met you personally but I don't see the point of  wasting our time unless I know what I am putting my money into.\"    \"Tell him, Harry,\" Sales urged. \"We can trust Tompkins not to take  advantage of our plans. The way we're set up we could block him easy  if he tried to double-cross us.\"    \"That's right,\" I said. \"It's your plan and you have the inside track.\"    \"Well, then,\" Willamer explained, \"here's our first operation. The  Army and Navy have huge stocks of atabrine and quinine--left over from  Africa and the South-west Pacific. As soon as the fighting stops,  Colonel Finogan and Commander Coonley will declare these stocks surplus  to be sold at spot-sales where they are. We will be the only bidders  and we get a world-corner on malaria. The whole world needs that stuff  and if we move fast, during the confusion after victory, we can sew it  up and make the world pay our price. We ought to double our money in  three months.\"    \"Double!\" snorted Sales. \"We ought to quintuple it like Papa Dionne.  South America is just lousy with dollars and here's a way to get 'em  back home. Malaria's a big item down there. No quinine, no oil.\"    \"Well, gentlemen,\" I told the Inter-Alia boys, \"I'll have to think  it over. As Mr. Willamer knows, I'm pretty heavily committed in the  present market. Get in touch with me about the end of the month and  I might be able to put--say, twenty thousand dollars--into your  proposition.\"    Willamer smiled unpleasantly. \"Come, Tompkins,\" he said, \"you can do  much better than that. Perhaps you don't realize that the S.E.C. might  just decide to investigate your firm's market-position. You can afford  to put in at least $100,000 now and, when you get out of your present  operation, make up the balance of that half million.\"    I went to the dumbwaiter and pushed the buzzer. \"Tammy,\" I spoke into  the phone, \"will you come up here and show these gentlemen out of the  club. We've finished our talk.\"    \"Nothing doing,\" I said to the others. \"I don't shake down well.\"    Willamer blinked his watery blue eyes at me. \"That's libelous,\" he  stated. \"I'm a lawyer and I ought to know. You can't accuse me of  blackmail in the presence of witnesses. By God, Tompkins, I'll have the  examiners in your office at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. And I'll sue  you for damages.\"    \"Oh no, you won't,\" I informed him. \"I didn't call you a blackmailer  and I doubt that your friends will care to testify. You didn't  know--perhaps I forgot to mention it--but this room is wired for  dictaphones and a complete phonographic record of this conversation is  already on wire. I'll send it over to the F.B.I. in the morning, unless  you--\"    \"Excuse me, Harry,\" said Commander Coonley with an air of decision. \"I  didn't hear any reference to blackmail by Mr. Tompkins. I'd better be  getting back to my office.\"    \"Me, too,\" chimed Lt. Col. George Finogan.    \"Nice to have met you, Tompkins,\" Winston Sales observed as he strode  briskly for the exit.    Harry Willamer turned to me, not without dignity. \"You son of a bitch!\"  he remarked feelingly, and followed the others.    I waited until it was reasonably sure that the Inter-Alia group had  left the building. Then I went downstairs to the bar and found Tammy  alone.    \"Tammy,\" I said. \"You overheard our conversation down the dummy, didn't  you?\"    \"Oh no, sir. Not at all, Mr. Tompkins. I--\"    \"Of course you did, Tammy. You heard these gentlemen try to blackmail  me and you heard me tell them to go to hell, didn't you?\"    I languidly waved a twenty-dollar bill under his snubby nose.    \"Now that you put it that way, sir,\" the little bar-steward admitted,  \"I do remember hearing that Mr. Willamer say that unless you gave him  $100,000 he'd start investigating your books.\"    \"Splendid!\" I congratulated him. \"Just remember that, when the time  comes. Now see if you can get me Mr. Merriwether Vail on the phone.  He's in the Manhattan Directory--a lawyer.\"    \"Merry?\" I asked, after we had been connected. \"I have a feeling I'm  going to need your legal services.... No, it's not that one ... it's  another kind of jam ... I'm being blackmailed.... No, you dope, it's  not a woman, it's an official.... Yes, I'll stick here until you can  get over.... What shall I order for you, a double Scotch?... Right! At  the Pond Club.\"    There was one more move to make. I called Bedford Hills,  person-to-person call, and asked for my wife. After the usual duel  between local and suburban operators, Jimmie's voice answered.  \"Winnie,\" she said. \"Thank goodness you telephoned me. You'd better  come out at once. The most dreadful things have been happening.\"    \"It's not so wonderful here either,\" I told her. \"Listen, Jimmie, you  come on in--\"    \"It's Ponto,\" she said, paying absolutely no attention to what I was  saying. \"He's drunk--yes, drunk! He managed to upset that decanter of  old brandy you keep on your night table and lapped it up. Now he's  howling and hiccoughing like mad and I'm afraid to go near him.\"    \"Oh, Jimmie, to hell with Ponto. Let him sleep it off. You come on  in to town. We've got to do some fast thinking. I'll meet you in the  Little Bar at the Ritz at five o'clock. Bring your night things, and  mine, too. We may have to leave town in a hurry. I'll explain when I  see you.\"          CHAPTER 13      Merry Vail listened to my account of the encounter with the Inter-Alia  gang and then rolled his eyes toward heaven.    \"Poor old Winnie!\" he expostulated. \"Why didn't you try something  comparatively safe, like robbing a she bear of her whelps or yelling  'Hurray for Hitler' in Union Square? Harry Willamer is a vindictive guy  and his aunt or his mother-in-law is related to Jesse Jones. At least  that's what the Street believes.\"    \"What can he do to me?\" I asked. \"I have him cold on a charge of  blackmail.\"    \"Like hell you do!\" said Merry. \"First thing he'll check with the  F.B.I. to find out if there is a recording of your talk. And there  isn't. So it's your word and Tammy's against that of four high-ranking  government officials. You ask what they can do to you? You just call  Phil Cone at your office and see if they haven't started doing it  already.\"    The steward made the phone connection and in a few minutes Cone's  languid voice was complaining over the wire.    \"Say, Winnie, what the hell have you been up to?\"    \"Nothing, Phil. Why?\" I asked.    \"It's just that the word's been passed to lay off Tompkins, Wasson  & Cone. The brokers don't want to handle our orders. You know Manny  Oppenheimer of Auchincloss, Morton, Caton, Beauregard & Oppenheimer?  You know how he used to lick your boots if you stood still long enough  for him to kneel down and stick his tongue out? Well, Manny cut me.  Yeah, that's right. Cut me! What's cooking? Even my best friends won't  tell me whether it's B.O. or dishpan hands.\"    \"Just keep on plugging, Phil,\" I urged. \"They can't refuse to handle  our orders if we insist. I'll put in some calls on this.... Yeah, I'm  up at the Pond Club with my attorney ... I'll try to call you back.  That guy Willamer is back of this because I wouldn't go along with his  proposition.\"    \"Oh-oh!\" Phil observed dismally. \"That's enough for me. Think I'd  better join the Marines?\"    \"You keep away from the recruiting-sergeant until we finish this  operation,\" I told him.    I turned to Vail. \"Merry,\" I said, \"this is one for you to handle.  Brokers are trying to get out of handling our orders and tenth-raters  like Manny Oppenheimer are high-hatting Phil Cone. You put in a call  and find out what it's all about.\"    Vail meditated. \"Okay,\" he said at last. \"You understand I'm acting as  your attorney now?\"    \"Sure,\" I agreed.    He dialed a number. \"I'd like to speak to the U.S. Attorney's office,\"  he told the switch-board operator. \"Yes, I'll wait.... Yes.... Oh,  Ned?... This is Merry Vail. I've been retained by Winfred Tompkins.  What I want to know is whether there are any charges against him....  Yeah, he's with me now.... No, he won't try to leave town. Suspicion of  kidnapping?... No fooling?... That's cockeyed.... Listen, counselor, my  client is innocent and stands ready to answer all charges--\"    He turned to me. \"Hell, he hung up!\"    \"What was that about kidnapping?\" I asked.    \"Oh, something completely screw-ball,\" my attorney said. \"It's only  that his office has received an anonymous charge accusing you of having  kidnapped Winnie Tompkins and masquerading in his place. Ned also told  me you were in trouble with other governmental agencies and said he'd  see me in court.\"    \"Damn!\" I objected. \"That sounds like Virginia Rutherford's idea of  a snappy way to find out where I was before Easter. It doesn't make  sense. If I kidnapped Tompkins, who am I supposed to be? I'm ready to  take a finger-print test any time, even with these bandages on my right  hand.\"    Vail clucked his tongue. \"That attitude won't help,\" he said. \"If you  don't look out they'll say your prints prove that you're the man who  kidnapped Charley Ross. No, Ned is full of prunes and he doesn't put  much stock in this kidnapping angle, but the wolves are after you all  right. Now I've passed the word, you can't leave the State, of course.\"    \"Damn you, Merry,\" I objected. \"I never told you--\"    \"You retained me, Winnie. That's enough. You'd be a damn fool to pull  out now. Every G-man in America would be after you. My advice is  to stick around. Today's the eleventh, Wednesday. Well, you have a  week-end coming up, so you might just as well go on commuting between  your office and Bedford Hills as be pulled off the fast freight at  Oneonta.\"    \"Damn that Rutherford woman!\" I remarked. \"She is the one who turned  me in to the District Attorney. Up to now I've just had a few friendly  passes from a nice guy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/520"],[0,"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (#17)"],[1,"\"    Then he began to climb out again, and found it hard work--the space  being so small.  And on his way up he noticed a thin, round pipe  sticking through the side of the chimney, but could not guess what it  was for.    Finally he reached the roof and said to the reindeer:    \"There was no need of my going down that chimney, for I could find no  fireplace through which to enter the house.  I fear the children who  live there must go without playthings this Christmas.\"    Then he drove on, but soon came to another new house with a small  chimney.  This caused Santa Claus to shake his head doubtfully, but he  tried the chimney, nevertheless, and found it exactly like the other.  Moreover, he nearly stuck fast in the narrow flue and tore his jacket  trying to get out again; so, although he came to several such chimneys  that night, he did not venture to descend any more of them.    \"What in the world are people thinking of, to build such useless  chimneys?\" he exclaimed.  \"In all the years I have traveled with my  reindeer I have never seen the like before.\"    True enough; but Santa Claus had not then discovered that stoves had  been invented and were fast coming into use.  When he did find it out  he wondered how the builders of those houses could have so little  consideration for him, when they knew very well it was his custom to  climb down chimneys and enter houses by way of the fireplaces.  Perhaps  the men who built those houses had outgrown their own love for toys,  and were indifferent whether Santa Claus called on their children or  not.  Whatever the explanation might be, the poor children were forced  to bear the burden of grief and disappointment.    The following year Santa Claus found more and more of the new-fashioned  chimneys that had no fireplaces, and the next year still more.  The  third year, so numerous had the narrow chimneys become, he even had a  few toys left in his sledge that he was unable to give away, because he  could not get to the children.    The matter had now become so serious that it worried the good man  greatly, and he decided to talk it over with Kilter and Peter and Nuter  and Wisk.    Kilter already knew something about it, for it had been his duty to run  around to all the houses, just before Christmas, and gather up the  notes and letters to Santa Claus that the children had written, telling  what they wished put in their stockings or hung on their Christmas  trees.  But Kilter was a silent fellow, and seldom spoke of what he saw  in the cities and villages.  The others were very indignant.    \"Those people act as if they do not wish their children to be made  happy!\" said sensible Peter, in a vexed tone.  \"The idea of shutting  out such a generous friend to their little ones!\"    \"But it is my intention to make children happy whether their parents  wish it or not,\" returned Santa Claus.  \"Years ago, when I first began  making toys, children were even more neglected by their parents than  they are now; so I have learned to pay no attention to thoughtless or  selfish parents, but to consider only the longings of childhood.\"    \"You are right, my master,\" said Nuter, the Ryl; \"many children would  lack a friend if you did not consider them, and try to make them happy.\"    \"Then,\" declared the laughing Wisk, \"we must abandon any thought of  using these new-fashioned chimneys, but become burglars, and break into  the houses some other way.\"    \"What way?\" asked Santa Claus.    \"Why, walls of brick and wood and plaster are nothing to Fairies.  I  can easily pass through them whenever I wish, and so can Peter and  Nuter and Kilter.  Is it not so, comrades?\"    \"I often pass through the walls when I gather up the letters,\" said  Kilter, and that was a long speech for him, and so surprised Peter and  Nuter that their big round eyes nearly popped out of their heads.    \"Therefore,\" continued the Fairy, \"you may as well take us with you on  your next journey, and when we come to one of those houses with stoves  instead of fireplaces we will distribute the toys to the children  without the need of using a chimney.\"    \"That seems to me a good plan,\" replied Santa Claus, well pleased at  having solved the problem.  \"We will try it next year.\"    That was how the Fairy, the Pixie, the Knook and the Ryl all rode in  the sledge with their master the following Christmas Eve; and they had  no trouble at all in entering the new-fashioned houses and leaving toys  for the children that lived in them.    And their deft services not only relieved Santa Claus of much labor,  but enabled him to complete his own work more quickly than usual, so  that the merry party found themselves at home with an empty sledge a  full hour before daybreak.    The only drawback to the journey was that the mischievous Wisk  persisted in tickling the reindeer with a long feather, to see them  jump; and Santa Claus found it necessary to watch him every minute and  to tweak his long ears once or twice to make him behave himself.    But, taken all together, the trip was a great success, and to this day  the four little folk always accompany Santa Claus on his yearly ride  and help him in the distribution of his gifts.    But the indifference of parents, which had so annoyed the good Saint,  did not continue very long, and Santa Claus soon found they were really  anxious he should visit their homes on Christmas Eve and leave presents  for their children.    So, to lighten his task, which was fast becoming very difficult indeed,  old Santa decided to ask the parents to assist him.    \"Get your Christmas trees all ready for my coming,\" he said to them;  \"and then I shall be able to leave the presents without loss of time,  and you can put them on the trees when I am gone.\"    And to others he said: \"See that the children's stockings are hung up  in readiness for my coming, and then I can fill them as quick as a  wink.\"    And often, when parents were kind and good-natured, Santa Claus would  simply fling down his package of gifts and leave the fathers and  mothers to fill the stockings after he had darted away in his sledge.    \"I will make all loving parents my deputies!\" cried the jolly old  fellow, \"and they shall help me do my work.  For in this way I shall  save many precious minutes and few children need be neglected for lack  of time to visit them.\"    Besides carrying around the big packs in his swift-flying sledge old  Santa began to send great heaps of toys to the toy-shops, so that if  parents wanted larger supplies for their children they could easily get  them; and if any children were, by chance, missed by Santa Claus on his  yearly rounds, they could go to the toy-shops and get enough to make  them happy and contented.  For the loving friend of the little ones  decided that no child, if he could help it, should long for toys in  vain.  And the toy-shops also proved convenient whenever a child fell  ill, and needed a new toy to amuse it; and sometimes, on birthdays, the  fathers and mothers go to the toy-shops and get pretty gifts for their  children in honor of the happy event.    Perhaps you will now understand how, in spite of the bigness of the  world, Santa Claus is able to supply all the children with beautiful  gifts.  To be sure, the old gentleman is rarely seen in these days; but  it is not because he tries to keep out of sight, I assure you.  Santa  Claus is the same loving friend of children that in the old days used  to play and romp with them by the hour; and I know he would love to do  the same now, if he had the time.  But, you see, he is so busy all the  year making toys, and so hurried on that one night when he visits our  homes with his packs, that he comes and goes among us like a flash; and  it is almost impossible to catch a glimpse of him.    And, although there are millions and millions more children in the  world than there used to be, Santa Claus has never been known to  complain of their increasing numbers.    \"The more the merrier!\" he cries, with his jolly laugh; and the only  difference to him is the fact that his little workmen have to make  their busy fingers fly faster every year to satisfy the demands of so  many little ones.    \"In all this world there is nothing so beautiful as a happy child,\"  says good old Santa Claus; and if he had his way the children would all  be beautiful, for all would be happy."]]]
