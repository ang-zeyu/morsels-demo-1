Well, the time has come to  teach the British Lion that others have learned the trick of gaining  power. But I do not need to tell you about England. Your Fuehrer knows  all about England, and how to handle her.\"    Dave was sorely tempted to shout, \"Sure! Like his cockeyed Luftwaffe  tried to handle her last September, hey?\" but of course he breathed  not a word. Instead he nodded his head and looked very wise and self  satisfied ... and waited, seething inside with anger.    \"For weeks,\" Serrangi went on, \"I have been maintaining contact with  the secret Japanese headquarters at Raja, by airplane, and radio. No,  the plane has not been mine. My friend serving with the Royal Air  Force here at Singapore, but with a prayer for England's complete  defeat in his heart. He has taken the information I have given him and  flown with it far out to sea when on what you call, solo patrol. At a  certain rendezvous he has contacted a Japanese submarine and dropped  the information to the water. From the submarine the information has  been radioed to Tokio, and from there southward to Raja. But I dare not  trust that method any longer.\"    \"You don't trust this ... this R.A.F. pilot?\" Dave asked as the other  paused.    \"No, not him,\" Serrangi said with a laugh. \"He would not dare! I hold  his life between my thumb and forefinger as I might hold a wingless  fly. It is the British I do not trust. They know that trouble is coming  from Japan. They don't know when, and I do not believe there is an  Englishman in all Singapore who so much as dreams _how close_ that time  is! Nevertheless they have become very much more on the alert. From  one hour to the next I am not sure if my flying friend will be caught,  or continue to work unhindered. And the British are watching the seas  with eyes of eagles, these days. They might sink the very submarine to  which my flying friend had dropped the vital information. And there is  but one more set of information figures to send to Raja. They cover  everything here in the Far East. I cannot run the risk that they might  become lost.\"    \"So we are to steal a plane and fly them to Raja?\" Freddy Farmer spoke  up as the Sumatran fell silent. \"Is that what we are to do?\"    \"That is what you are to do!\" Serrangi said with a short nod. \"You will  steal a plane and escape to Raja. When you arrive you will be treated  as great heroes. I can assure you of that. Any honor you desire will be  yours. And I ... I will have triple the wealth of any man in Singapore  for my reward.\"    \"It can be done,\" Dave grunted. Then giving the Devil's Den owner a  keen look. \"One thing, though. My Fuehrer's teaching compels me to make  sure of all things. You say you cannot run the risk of the information  becoming lost. Supposing we fail to steal a plane? Supposing we are  caught? What then, eh?\"    Serrangi smiled, and indeed it was the smile of Satan's own son.    \"I should have added, _and not know it_,\" the Sumatran said. \"If you  fail and are caught, I shall know it almost at the same instant. Then I  shall have to find another way.\"    \"But the information!\" Freddy Farmer cried in true German bewilderment.  \"What if it falls into the hands of the British?\"    \"The very least of my worries, for it is no worry at all,\" Serrangi  replied promptly. \"It would do them no good. It would give them  headaches, and it would probably drive them mad in the end. But they  would never be able to decipher what it meant. That, my two friends, is  why Serrangi holds the position he does. No man alive can read my code  without the key. And only _one_ other man knows the key at a time!\"    Dave frowned, started to ask what that meant, and then the truth of the  statement hit him right between the eyes. To be given Serrangi's code  key was to be handed your death warrant. When you had served his evil  purpose, no matter what it might be, you died ... and the next man in  Serrangi's death and blood dealings was given the key.    \"The one who knows the key now is at Raja?\" Dave grunted.    \"That is so,\" the Sumatran said. \"And one of the Japanese Emperor's  most trusted generals. To him I gave it personally. And I know the  thoughts that fill your mind, now. When I have closed my work, my  business, with him? Perhaps, and perhaps not. When the Japanese take  Singapore there must be some one to govern and rule. Perhaps I will  tire of operating the Devil's Den. Who knows ... but myself? But enough  of this talk. Our work is not yet done.\"    Serrangi gave a wave of his hand to dismiss the loose talk, and for a  moment frowned at the thread of grey smoke that spiralled upward from  his cigarette. Then suddenly he nodded as though he had made up his  mind on something.    \"There are many Royal Air Force fields here in Singapore,\" he grunted.  \"Perhaps, though, it would be best to steal your plane from the  Municipal Airport which the Government has taken over. I happen to know  that it is not so well guarded as the others.\"    \"What about the planes there?\" Dave asked in a voice he had to fight to  keep steady. \"We would want nothing bigger than a two seater. To steal  a bomber would be impossible. Too much to do before taking it off.\"    \"There is no need to worry!\" Serrangi said a bit sharply. \"There are  planes of all types at the Municipal Airport. And the fools ... they  keep them all lined up in rows, as though they had them on display for  sale. I do not feel that you will have much difficulty. True, there  are armed guards about the field. But you two have heard the sound of  rifles and machine guns shooting at you before now, eh?\"    \"More often than not,\" Dave said as the cold lumps of lead started  rolling around in his stomach. \"But when do we steal this plane? When  do we make the flight? And...?\"    Dave stopped as Serrangi whipped up one hand in a curt signal to shut  up.    \"If you will stop that chatter of the jungle monkeys, I will give you  complete instructions!\" the Sumatran grated. \"First, the attempt should  be made just before dawn, during the darkest hour of the night. Second,  you will receive a certain amount of assistance from my men. They will  do what they can to attract the attention of the field guards while you  steal the plane. Third, be sure you steal an airplane that is well  marked with R.A.F. insignia.\"    \"Why not any plane?\" Freddy Farmer wanted to know as Serrangi paused  for breath.    \"For very good reasons!\" came the curt reply. \"All civilian flying has  been stopped between here and Burma. If you stole a civilian plane your  position would be immediately reported by any official who sighted you.  Also, you would get into trouble if you came upon British Air Force  planes on patrol. Flying an R.A.F. plane, however, would not attract  their attention. Now, of course, when you once get into the air you  are to head in the _opposite_ direction to your real objective. You  will fly south toward Java until you have reached an altitude where you  cannot be seen from below. You will then double back and fly up the  middle of the South China Sea until you have reached the southern tip  of French Indo-China. Then follow the coast northwest to Thailand, and  then north to your destination.\"    The Sumatran stopped short, leaned forward and touched a bony finger to  the map Dave and Freddy held between them.    \"Study that map, and learn it well,\" he said. \"The course is well  marked on it. A course that should take you safely past all spots of  possible trouble. Study also the markings of the terrain about Raja.  If you have never been to Raja, it is a village of perhaps twenty  bamboo huts. It is completely surrounded by wild country where no white  man could survive for long. I have been told that from an airplane you  cannot see a patch of ground level enough for a man to lie down on.  High mountains, deep valleys, and jungle filled gorges. But there _is_  flat ground there. An area big enough for five hundred airplanes to  use. The Japanese have made it so, in secret. But you would never be  able to find the place in a hundred years ... without this map. See  where the mountain range coming down from the north meets the one that  extends straight across Burma? See the blue mark made on the map? That  is the spot where you will land when you have given your signal, and  have received a signal in return.\"    \"Signals?\" Dave prompted as Serrangi paused again.    \"Certainly,\" the Sumatran replied and flung him a scornful look. \"You  will circle the spot five times ... no more and no less ... to let  General Kashomia know that you come from me. You will circle around  at six thousand feet exactly. A red flare will be your order to come  lower. Other flares will be fired to show you where to land on the  hidden field. You will be escorted straight to General Kashomia when  you have landed, and your plane has stopped. But, mark you well! Do  just as I am directing you; do not make any mistakes when you reach  this spot. Guns will be trained on you, and at General Kashomia's  orders they could shoot you and your plane into small pieces in the  matter of split seconds. Now, you have further questions before we get  under way?\"    \"Get under way?\" Freddy Farmer echoed sharply. \"You mean now, this  night?\"    \"And why not?\" Serrangi demanded suspiciously. \"The sooner you deliver  my report to General Kashomia, the sooner the blow can be struck. Yes,  tonight! Within two hours I shall see that you are taken as close to  the Municipal Airport as is possible. It will then be the darkest hour,  and the risk of being caught will be less. But, you object?\"    \"Of course not!\" Dave spoke up quickly before Freddy could say  anything. \"But there is one thing that makes me very curious. This  friend of yours who is a pilot and wears the uniform of the Royal Air  Force. It is a great honor for whoever makes this flight. I am curious  why your friend ... who has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5067"],[0,"The Rainbow Trail (#17)"],[1," her.  She bowed her head in acquiescence. And Shefford began his story. Did  she grow still, like stone, or was that only his vivid imagination?  He told her of Venters and Bess--of Lassiter and Jane--of little Fay  Larkin--of the romance, and then the tragedy of Surprise Valley.    \"So, when my Church disowned me,\" he concluded, \"I conceived the idea  of wandering into the wilds of Utah to save Fay Larkin from that canyon  prison. It grew to be the best and strongest desire of my life. I think  if I could save her that it would save me. I never loved any girl.  I can't say that I love Fay Larkin. How could I when I've never seen  her--when she's only a dream girl? But I believe if she were to become a  reality--a flesh-and-blood girl--that I would love her.\"    That was more than Shefford had ever confessed to any one, and it  stirred him to his depths. Mary bent her head on her hands in strange,  stonelike rigidity.    \"So here I am in the canyon country,\" he continued. \"Withers tells me  it is a country of rainbows, both in the evanescent air and in the  changeless stone. Always as a boy there had been for me some haunting  promise, some treasure at the foot of the rainbow. I shall expect the  curve of a rainbow to lead me down into Surprise Valley. A dreamer, you  will call me. But I have had strange dreams come true.... Mary, do you  think THIS dream will come true?\"    She was silent so long that he repeated his question.    \"Only--in heaven,\" she whispered.    He took her reply strangely and a chill crept over him.    \"You think my plan to seek to strive, to find--you think that idle,  vain?\"    \"I think it noble.... Thank God I've met a man like you!\"    \"Don't praise me!\" he exclaimed, hastily. \"Only help me.... Mary, will  you answer a few little questions, if I swear by my honor I'll never  reveal what you tell me?\"    \"I'll try.\"    He moistened his lips. Why did she seem so strange, so far away? The  hovering shadows made him nervous. Always he had been afraid of the  dark. His mood now admitted of unreal fancies.    \"Have you ever heard of Fay Larkin?\" he asked, very low.    \"Yes.\"    \"Was there only one Fay Larkin?\"    \"Only one.\"    \"Did you--ever see her?\"    \"Yes,\" came the faint reply.    He was grateful. How she might be breaking faith with creed or duty!  He had not dared to hope so much. All his inner being trembled at the  portent of his next query. He had not dreamed it would be so hard to  put, or would affect him so powerfully. A warmth, a glow, a happiness  pervaded his spirit; and the chill, the gloom were as if they had never  been.    \"Where is Fay Larkin now?\" he asked, huskily.    He bent over her, touched her, leaned close to catch her whisper.    \"She is--dead!\"    Slowly Shefford rose, with a sickening shock, and then in bitter pain he  strode away into the starlight.          VII. SAGO-LILIES      The Indian returned to camp that night, and early the next day, which  was Sunday, Withers rode in, accompanied by a stout, gray-bearded  personage wearing a long black coat.    \"Bishop Kane, this is my new man, John Shefford,\" said the trader.    Shefford acknowledged the introduction with the respectful courtesy  evidently in order, and found himself being studied intently by clear  blue eyes. The bishop appeared old, dry, and absorbed in thought; he  spoke quaintly, using in every speech some Biblical word or phrase; and  he had an air of authority. He asked Shefford to hear him preach at the  morning service, and then he went off into the village.    \"Guess he liked your looks,\" remarked Withers.    \"He certainly sized me up,\" replied Shefford.    \"Well, what could you expect? Sure I never heard of a deal like this--a  handsome young fellow left alone with a lot of pretty Mormon women!  You'll understand when you learn to know Mormons. Bishop Kane's a square  old chap. Crazy on religion, maybe, but otherwise he's a good fellow.  I made the best stand I could for you. The Mormons over at Stonebridge  were huffy because I hadn't consulted them before fetching you over  here. If I had, of course you'd never have gotten here. It was Joe Lake  who made it all right with them. Joe's well thought of, and he certainly  stood up for you.\"    \"I owe him something, then,\" replied Shefford. \"Hope my obligations  don't grow beyond me. Did you leave Joe at Stonebridge?\"    \"Yes. He wanted to stay, and I had work there that'll keep him awhile.  Shefford, we got news of Shadd--bad news. The half-breed's cutting up  rough. His gang shot up some Piutes over here across the line. Then he  got run out of Durango a few weeks ago for murder. A posse of cowboys  trailed him. But he slipped them. He's a fox. You know he was trailing  us here. He left the trail, Nas Ta Bega said. I learned at Stonebridge  that Shadd is well disposed toward Mormons. It takes the Mormons to  handle Indians. Shadd knows of this village and that's why he shunted  off our trail. But he might hang down in the pass and wait for us. I  think I'd better go back to Kayenta alone, across country. You stay here  till Joe and the Indian think it safe to leave. You'll be going up on  the slope of Navajo to load a pack-train, and from there it may be well  to go down West Canyon to Red Lake, and home over the divide, the way  you came. Joe'll decide what's best. And you might as well buckle on a  gun and get used to it. Sooner or later you'll have to shoot your way  through.\"    Shefford did not respond with his usual enthusiasm, and the omission  caused the trader to scrutinize him closely.    \"What's the matter?\" he queried. \"There's no light in your eye to-day.  You look a little shady.\"    \"I didn't rest well last night,\" replied Shefford. \"I'm depressed this  morning. But I'll cheer up directly.\"    \"Did you get along with the women?\"    \"Very well indeed. And I've enjoyed myself. It's a strange, beautiful  place.\"    \"Do you like the women?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Have you seen much of the Sago Lily?\"    \"No. I carried her bucket one night--and saw her only once again. I've  been with the other women most of the time.\"    \"It's just as well you didn't run often into Mary. Joe's sick over her.  I never saw a girl with a face and form to equal hers. There's danger  here for any man, Shefford. Even for you who think you've turned your  back on the world! Any of these Mormon women may fall in love with you.  They CAN'T love their husbands. That's how I figure it. Religion holds  them, not love. And the peculiar thing is this: they're second, third,  or fourth wives, all sealed. That means their husbands are old, have  picked them out for youth and physical charms, have chosen the very  opposite to their first wives, and then have hidden them here in this  lonely hole.... Did you ever imagine so terrible a thing?\"    \"No, Withers, I did not.\"    \"Maybe that's what depressed you. Anyway, my hunch is worth taking. Be  as nice as you can, Shefford. Lord knows it would be good for these poor  women if every last one of them fell in love with you. That won't hurt  them so long as you keep your head. Savvy? Perhaps I seem rough and  coarse to a man of your class. Well, that may be. But human nature is  human nature. And in this strange and beautiful place you might love  an Indian girl, let alone the Sago Lily. That's all. I sure feel better  with that load off my conscience. Hope I don't offend.\"    \"No indeed. I thank you, Withers,\" replied Shefford, with his hand  on the trader's shoulder. \"You are right to caution me. I seem to be  wild--thirsting for adventure--chasing a gleam. In these unstable days  I can't answer for my heart. But I can for my honor. These unfortunate  women are as safe with me as--as they are with you and Joe.\"    Withers uttered a blunt laugh.    \"See here, son, look things square in the eye. Men of violent, lonely,  toilsome lives store up hunger for the love of woman. Love of a STRANGE  woman, if you want to put it that way. It's nature. It seems all the  beautiful young women in Utah are corralled in this valley. When I  come over here I feel natural, but I'm not happy. I'd like to make love  to--to that flower-faced girl. And I'm not ashamed to own it. I've told  Molly, my wife, and she understands. As for Joe, it's much harder for  him. Joe never has had a wife or sweetheart. I tell you he's sick, and  if I'd stay here a month I'd be sick.\"    Withers had spoken with fire in his eyes, with grim humor on his lips,  with uncompromising brutal truth. What he admitted was astounding to  Shefford, but, once spoken, not at all strange. The trader was a man who  spoke his inmost thought. And what he said suddenly focused Shefford's  mental vision clear and whole upon the appalling significance of the  tragedy of those women, especially of the girl whose life was lonelier,  sadder, darker than that of the others.    \"Withers, trust me,\" replied Shefford.    \"All right. Make the best of a bad job,\" said the trader, and went off  about his tasks.    Shefford and Withers attended the morning service, which was held in the  school-house. Exclusive of the children every inhabitant of the village  was there. The women, except the few eldest, were dressed in white and  looked exceedingly well. Manifestly they had bestowed care upon this  Sabbath morning's toilet. One thing surely this dress occasion brought  out, and it was evidence that the Mormon women were not poor, whatever  their misfortunes might be. Jewelry was not wanting, nor fine lace. And  they all wore beautiful wild flowers of a kind unknown to Shefford. He  received many a bright smile. He looked for Mary, hoping to see her face  for the first time in the daylight, but she sat far forward and did not  turn. He saw her graceful white neck, the fine lines of her throat, and  her colorless cheek. He recognized her, yet in the light she seemed a  stranger.    The service began with a short prayer and was followed by the singing of  a hymn. Nowhere had Shefford heard"]]]
