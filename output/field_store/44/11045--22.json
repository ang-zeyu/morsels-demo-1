Joseph returned to Quincy in company with the sheriff's posse and  secured a writ of _habeas corpus_ from Charles A. Warren, master in  chancery. The same evening, Saturday, June 5th, Judge Stephen A.  Douglass arrived in Quincy, and appointed the hearing on the writ to  take place the following Tuesday, at Monmouth, Warren County.    In the meantime the news of Joseph's arrest reached Nauvoo and created  no little excitement. A party of seven men, under the leadership of  Hosea Stout, left Nauvoo for Quincy, Sunday morning, in a skiff, to  render the Prophet any assistance in their power, and prevent if  possible his enemies taking him to Missouri. They struggled against  a head-wind all day, but reached Quincy at dusk, only to learn that  Joseph had gone to Nauvoo in charge of Sheriff King and another  officer; there was nothing for them to do but to return.    Sheriff King was taken sick at Nauvoo, but Joseph nursed him with all  the tenderness of a brother, and the day following Monday, started for  Monmouth, accompanied by a large number of the leading men of Nauvoo,  and the sheriff, whom Joseph cared for personally during the journey of  seventy-five miles. The party arrived at Monmouth on Tuesday, but at  the request of the State attorney, who claimed he was not prepared on  the case, the hearing was postponed until the next day.    The appearance of Joseph in Monmouth caused considerable excitement. He  was invited to preach, but thought it best, as he was a prisoner, not  to do so; but he appointed Amasa Lyman to preach in the court room on  Wednesday evening.    The prejudice of the people of Monmouth was as excessive as it was  blind. They employed at their own expense several attorneys to assist  the prosecution, and declared that if there were any lawyers in the  district who would even undertake the defense of the Prophet, they  never need look to the people of that county again for political  favors. But there were strong men in attendance at the court, men not  to be frightened by such threats, and whose souls despised the petty  minds that could frame them; Joseph, therefore, was ably defended by  Messrs. Charles A. Warren, Sidney H. Little, O. H. Browning, James H.  Ralston, Cyrus Walker, and Archibald Williams.    The pleadings of the lawyers for the defense were peculiarly affecting,  since all of them were more or less acquainted with the condition of  the Saints when they fled from the violence of Missourians to Illinois.  O. H. Browning had seen several of these companies of Saints in their  flight and could trace them by the blood left in their footprints on  the snow; his recital of their sufferings moved Judge Douglass, most  of the officers of the court and the spectators to tears. One of the  brethren present who wrote an account of the trial for the Nauvoo  papers says:        He [Mr. Browning] concluded his remarks by saying, To tell the      prisoner to go to Missouri for a trial was adding insult to injury,      and then said: \"Great God! Have I not seen it? Yes, my eyes have      beheld the blood-stained traces of innocent women and children, in      the dreary winter, who had traveled hundreds of miles barefoot,      through frost and snow, to seek a refuge from their savage      pursuers. 'Twas a scene of horror, sufficient to have enlisted the      sympathy of an adamantine heart. And shall this unfortunate man,      whom their fury has seen proper to select for sacrifice, be driven      into such a savage land, where none dare to enlist in the cause of      justice? If there was no other voice under heaven ever to be heard      in this cause, gladly would I stand alone, and proudly spend my      latest breath in defense of an American citizen.\"    The lawyers for the prosecution, according to Joseph's own account,  acted honorably and confined themselves to the merits of the case,  excepting two--Messrs. Knowlton and Jennings. They made an appeal both  to the passions and prejudices of the people, and sought to create an  excitement over the matter. Judge Douglass, however, was impartial  in his rulings, and doubtless one officer of the court--the sheriff  of Warren County--thought him severe in his efforts to protect the  prisoner. The court room was densely packed and the judge ordered the  sheriff to keep the spectators back; but this he neglected and the  judge fined him ten dollars. In a few minutes the order to keep the  spectators from crowding the prisoner and witnesses was repeated, and  the sheriff told the court that he had ordered a constable to do it.  \"Clerk,\" said Judge Douglass, \"add ten dollars more to that fine.\" This  was effectual, the sheriff after that did his duty.    Joseph claimed in this case that he was unlawfully held a prisoner, and  he could prove that the indictment upon which he was arrested had been  obtained by fraud, bribery and duress. This line of defense, however,  raised the question as to whether the court had the right to inquire  into the merits of the case. A long debate between opposing counsel  followed. But it will be remembered that an attempt to arrest Joseph  on the requisition from the governor of Missouri had been made in  September previous; and it appears that after the fruitless effort to  make the arrest, the sheriff of Hancock County returned the writ; and  the defense claimed that after the return of the writ to the executive,  the defendant could not be again legally arrested upon it. It was upon  this point that the court set Joseph at liberty. Following is Judge  Douglass' decision on this point:        The writ being once returned to the executive by the sheriff of      Hancock County was dead, and stood in the same relationship as      any other writ which might issue from the circuit court, and      consequently the defendant cannot be held in custody on that writ.    On the other point in the case--as to whether evidence in the case was  admissible--the judge withheld his opinion for further consideration,  as the question was a grave one, involving the future conduct of the  States in their relationship with each other; but on the ground that  the writ was void, dead by reason of a former return being made on  it by the sheriff of Hancock County, he ordered the discharge of the  prisoner. And Missouri was again foiled in her designs upon the life of  the Prophet.    At the conclusion of the trial Joseph ordered dinner for his company,  which numbered by that time some sixty men. \"And when I called for the  tavern bill,\" says Joseph, \"the unconscientious fellow replied, 'only  one hundred and sixty dollars.'\" Some time after this, in September  following, Joseph sent the costs of this trial to the sheriff of Adams  County, of which the following is a copy:                                              NAUVOO, September 30, 1841.        _To the Deputy Sheriff of Adams County_:        The following is a statement of my expenses, costs and liabilities,      consequent upon my arrest and trial while in your custody, to-wit:               To amount of fees to Esquires Ralston, Warren & Co...$250.00                To Esquires Little, Williams, Walker and Browning...$100.00        To seven days for self, horse and carriage, @$5.00 per day...$35.00            To money spent during that time consequent upon arrest...$60.00                                              To twelve witnesses...$240.00                                                             ____________                                                                    $685.00    To which was added this note:        DEAR SIR.--You will please take such measures as to put me in      possession of the above amount, which is justly due me as above      stated; to say nothing of false imprisonment and other expenses.        * * *        Receive my respects, etc.                                                          JOSEPH SMITH.    With the exception of the difficulty just considered, the summer of  1841 glided pleasantly by, bringing to the busy inhabitants of Nauvoo  many occasions of social and spiritual enjoyment.        CHAPTER XIX.    EVENTS OF THE SUMMER OF 1841.    NAUVOO was the most promising and thrifty city in Illinois, and the  fame thereof extended throughout the nation, due, in part, of course,  to the peculiar religion of its inhabitants. Strangers from far and  near made it a point to visit Nauvoo, and the peace, sobriety, industry  and public spirit of the citizens challenged their admiration, whatever  views they might entertain respecting their religion. A large bowery  was constructed just west of the temple site where the people assembled  for worship. Here the Prophet Joseph preached some of his most powerful  discourses, and taught his people in the doctrine of the heavenly  kingdom; and not infrequently it happened that        Fools who came to mock, remained to pray.    The Saints never intended to make either their city or the Nauvoo  Legion exclusively Mormon. [1] On the contrary, the people at Nauvoo  expressed a willingness to unite with their fellow-citizens in every  good work and enterprise, and tolerate religious differences. Indeed,  repeated invitations were sent out to the honorable men, not only of  the State of Illinois, but of the United States, to men of capital  and of influence and of integrity, asking them to come to Nauvoo, and  assist in building up a glorious city.    In July, Sidney H. Little, of the State senate, was killed by leaping  from his carriage while his horse was unmanageable; and that the  \"Saints might mourn with those who are called to mourn,\" the eighteenth  day of July"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],[0,"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#17)"],[1," his  father Jacob. In the second verse we read:        \"For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief      ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's.\"    Before we leave this chapter in Chronicles let me state that if Joseph  received the birthright, and if the birthright and the Presidency of  the Church were inseparable, then it should have been through Joseph  that the Messiah should have come; but we learn that Judah prevailed  above his brethren in this particular.    So you see Hyrum was blessed with Joseph's blessing, and in his dying  blessing his father declared that it should be verified! I maintain  that the birthright therefore was not the blessing of his progenitors  that was given to Joseph, neither to Samuel Smith.    Our friends have solemnly informed us there was \"no blessing to the  children of Hyrum Smith.\" I desire to call your attention to a few  expressions in the blessing which I have just read. The promise is  here given that the posterity of Hyrum Smith shall be numbered with  the house of Ephraim and shall stand up with their father to crown the  tribes of Israel when they come shouting to Zion. Now, how can they  crown the tribes of Israel unless they hold the Priesthood and are  faithful men? Again, the promise is made to them that they shall have  an inheritance in Zion and possess it from generation to generation,  and their names never were to be blotted out. Now, how could this be  unless they were members of the Church holding the Priesthood? For  the faithless and unbelieving and the apostate was not to be numbered  in Zion, but his name was to be blotted out. I think you will agree  with me that these gentlemen in their preface to these blessings spoke  rather hastily of the children of Hyrum Smith.    I have here another blessing. This was given by the Prophet Joseph to  his brother Hyrum December 18, 1833, at Kirtland, and is also recorded  in the handwriting of Oliver Cowdery and is on file in the Historian's  office, Salt Lake City. This blessing shows to us that the Prophet  Joseph Smith recognized the fact that his brother Hyrum had received  the birthright. He says:        \"Blessed of the Lord is my brother Hyrum, for the integrity of his      heart; he shall be girt about with strength, and faithfulness shall      be the strength of his loins; from generation to generation he      shall be a shaft in the hands of his God to execute judgment upon      His enemies.\"    I will pause here. We are told that faithfulness shall be the strength  of his loins. This is a figure. We all understand what it means. It  means that the children of Hyrum Smith shall be faithful and from  generation to generation shall be a shaft in the hands of God to  execute His judgments. That is what it means!    But the blessing continues:        \"And he shall be hid by the hand of the Lord, that none of his      secret parts shall be discovered unto his enemies unto his hurt.      * * * He shall stand in the tracks of his father, and be numbered      among those who hold the right of Patriarchal Priesthood, even the      Evangelical Priesthood and power shall be upon him. His children      shall be many and his posterity numerous, and they shall rise up      and call him blessed.\"    Here we have the Prophet acknowledging that his brother Hyrum should  receive the birthright, for it was the right of Patriarchal Priesthood,  even the Evangelical Priesthood that was conferred upon the first born,  and not the office of President of the Church.    We learn from the Doctrine and Covenants that there are two offices  in the Church that descend from father to son. One is that of the  Bishopric, for upon Aaron and his sons the Lord conferred this  Priesthood (section 68:16-18). The other is that of the Evangelist.  This we learn in section 107, but our friends misconstrue this section  and try to make it appear that it is the Melchizedek Priesthood that is  meant.[2]    I will read it and you may judge for yourselves:        \"It is the duty of the Twelve, in all large branches of the Church      to ordain Evangelical ministers, as they shall be designated unto      them by revelation.        \"The order of this Priesthood was confirmed to be handed down from      father to son, and rightly belongs to the literal descendants of      the chosen seed, to whom the promises were made.        \"This order was instituted in the days of Adam, and came down by      lineage in the following manner,\" etc.    Now, Hyrum Smith obtained this birthright from his father. The Prophet  Joseph Smith declared in his blessing upon the head of his brother  Hyrum that it was his right to walk in the footsteps of his father.  Let's see what the Lord says about this: In section 124, verse 91, we  read:        \"And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant William (Law) be      appointed, ordained, and anointed, as a counselor unto my servant      Joseph in the room of my servant Hyrum, that my servant Hyrum may      take the office of Priesthood and Patriarch, which was appointed      unto him by his father, by blessing and also BY RIGHT!\"    The fact that the Lord has made two exceptions in the order of the  Priesthood, and has so plainly indicated them proves beyond the need of  controversy that the other offices do not so descend, for if they did,  the Lord would not make special mention of these two. Another thing,  if the first born son was to receive the office of Patriarch, that is  sufficient proof that the Presidency of the High Priesthood did not  so descend, for if it did one man must of necessity hold them both.  Again we learn that this evangelical order came down from father to son  and was instituted in the days of Adam. Let us see if the office of  president has come down in that manner.    Reorganites sometimes quote to us the following from section 81, but  for the life of me I do not understand why, since it destroys their  position:        \"Verily, verily I say unto you my servant Frederick G. Williams      listen to the voice of him who speaketh, to the word of the Lord,      your God; and hearken to the calling wherewith you are called, even      to be a High Priest in my Church, and a counselor unto my servant      Joseph Smith, Jun.        \"Unto whom I have given the keys of the kingdom, which belongeth      always unto the Presidency of the High Priesthood.\"    If the keys of the kingdom belongeth always to the Presidency of the  High Priesthood, then Peter was President of the High Priesthood for  the Lord conferred upon him the keys of the kingdom (Matt. 16:19), and  he conferred them upon Joseph Smith (Doc. & Cov. 27 and 128 sections)  even when we go back in ancient Israel we find Moses of the tribe of  Levi ordaining Joshua the son of Nun as his successor,[3] and not  his own son; Joseph, son of Jacob, receiving the birthright, but his  brother Levi receiving the Priesthood in Israel, and Judah the promise  of the Messiah. Even in Book of Mormon times, Nephi was the younger  brother of Sam, a faithful man, and Nephi ordained his brother Jacob,  not his son. Alma who became the High Priest of the Nephite church  was not a son of Mosiah who by right of birth became the king of the  people. And thus we might go on. It is a peculiar law indeed when the  Lord ignores it almost if not quite every time, and we may conclude  that it is a man-made doctrine concocted to bolster up the claim of an  aspiring set of men, not inspired of the Lord.      CHOSEN BY HIS FATHER.    We will now consider the claim that the president of the \"Reorganized\"  Church was appointed by his father. They base their claim on the  testimony of the following witnesses: (1) the statement of the  president of the \"Reorganization,\" (2) the statement of Lyman Wight,  (3) the statement of James Whitehead, (4) the statement of John S.  Carter, (5) and the statement of William Smith.    The president of their church declares that he was blessed in Liberty  Jail, twice afterwards before the fall of 1843, and again publicly in  the Grove at Nauvoo. (True Succession, p. 40). However, he is very  careful in the wording of his statement and deals with glittering  generalities. All he dare tell us is that the \"promise and blessing  of a life of usefulness to the cause of truth was pronounced upon his  head.\" Lyman Wight declares that the Prophet blessed his son in Liberty  Jail in 1839 as his successor. In another place he states that this  blessing was given shortly after they came out of Liberty Jail. (See  Succession, pp. 51-2). So you see that Lyman Wight contradicts himself.  We will further examine his statement. Sidney Rigdon, Caleb Baldwin  and Alexander McRae were fellow prisoners with the Prophet Joseph,  Patriarch Hyrum and Lyman Wight in Liberty. If any such blessing or  ordination, or whatever you desire to call it, had taken place at  that time these brethren would have known something of it. Moreover,  Hyrum Smith and Sidney Rigdon were counselors to the President, and  in such an appointment they would in all reason have been called on  to assist in such blessing; an account of it would have been made on  the records of the Church. In other words it would have been done in  an official way, and not in a corner. These fellow prisoners with the  Prophet and Patriarch, even including Lyman Wight, knew nothing of  such an appointment, calling or ordination while in Liberty prison.  No record of such a thing was made. Again, that such a blessing did  not take place, either in or shortly after they came out of that  prison, is quite evident from the fact that Sidney Rigdon, August 8,  1844, while making his claim to the \"guardianship\" of the Church,  declared that there could be no successor to Joseph Smith. It is also  quite evident that this expression was an afterthought on the part  of Lyman Wight from the fact that on that memorable 8th of August,  1844, he voted to sustain the Twelve Apostles as the"]]]
