We saw the hooks of those chains, by which the prisoners were  fastened by their necks to the walls of their cells; many of which being  below the level of the water were in a constant state of humidity; from  which issued a noxious vapour, which more than once extinguished the  candles. Since the destruction of the building many subterraneous cells  have been discovered under a piece of ground, which seemed only a bank  of solid earth before the horrid secrets of this prison-house were  disclosed. Some skeletons were found in these recesses with irons still  fastened to their decayed bones.\" Letters from France, by H.M. Williams,  p. 24.]      395    VII. \"GNOMES! YOU then taught volcanic airs to force       Through bubbling Lavas their resistless course,       O'er the broad walls of rifted Granite climb,       And pierce the rent roof of incumbent Lime,       Round sparry caves metallic lustres fling,  400  And bear phlogiston on their tepid wing.      [_And pierce the rent roof_. l. 398. The granite rocks and the limestone  rocks have been cracked to very great depths at the time they were  raised up by subterranean fires; in these cracks are found most of the  metallic ores, except iron and perhaps manganese, the former of which is  generally found in horizontal strata, and the latter generally near the  surface of the earth.    Philosophers possessing so convenient a test for the discovery of iron  by the magnet, have long since found it in all vegetable and animal  matters; and of late Mr. Scheele has discovered the existence of  manganese in vegetable ashes. Scheele, 56 mem. Stock. 1774. Kirwan. Min.  353. Which accounts for the production of it near the surface of earth,  and thence for its calciform appearance, or union with vital air.  Bergman has likewise shewn, that the limestones which become bluish or  dark coloured when calcined, possess a mixture of manganese, and are  thence preferable as a cement to other kinds of lime. 2. Bergman, 229.  Which impregnation with manganese has probably been received from the  decomposition of superincumbent vegetable matters.    These cracks or perpendicular caverns in the granite or limestone pass  to unknown depths; and it is up these channels that I have endeavoured  to shew that the steam rises which becomes afterwards condensed and  produces the warm springs of this island, and other parts of the world.  (See note on Fucus, Vol. II.) And up these cracks I suppose certain  vapours arise, which either alone, or by meeting with something  descending into them from above, have produced most of the metals; and  several of the materials in which they are bedded. Thus the ponderous  earth, Barytes, of Derbyshire, is found in these cracks, and is  stratified frequently with lead-ore, and frequently surrounds it. This  ponderous earth has been found by Dr. Hoepfner in a granite in  Switzerland, and may have thus been sublimed from immense depths by  great heat, and have obtained its carbonic or vitriolic acid from above.  Annales de Chimie. There is also reason to conclude that something from  above is necessary to the formation of many of the metals: at Hawkstone  in Shropshire, the seat of Sir Richard Hill, there is an elevated rock  of siliceous sand which is coloured green with copper in many places  high in the air; and I have in my possession a specimen of lead formed  in the cavity of an iron nodule, and another of lead amid spar from a  crack of a coal-stratum; all which countenance the modern production of  those metals from descending materials. To which should be added, that  the highest mountains of granite, which have therefore probably never  been covered with marine productions on account of their early  elevation, nor with vegetable or animal matters on account of their  great coldness, contain no metallic ores, whilst the lower ones contain  copper and tin in their cracks or veins, both in Saxony, Silesia, and  Cornwall. Kirwan's Mineral. p. 374.    The transmutation of one metal into another, though hitherto  undiscovered by the alchymists, does not appear impossible; such  transmutations have been supposed to exist in nature, thus lapis  calaminaris may have been produced from the destruction of lead-ore, as  it is generally found on the top of the veins of lead, where it has been  calcined or united with air, and because masses of lead-ore are often  found intirely inclosed in it. So silver is found mixed in almost all  lead-ores, and sometimes in seperate filaments within the cavities of  lead-ore, as I am informed by Mr. Michell, and is thence probably a  partial transmutation of the lead to silver, the rapid progress of  modern chemistry having shewn the analogy between metallic calces and  acids, may lead to the power of transmuting their bases: a discovery  much to be wished.]             \"HENCE glows, refulgent Tin! thy chrystal grains,       And tawny Copper shoots her azure veins;       Zinc lines his fretted vault with sable ore,       And dull Galena tessellates the floor;  405  On vermil beds in Idria's mighty caves       The living Silver rolls its ponderous waves;       With gay refractions bright Platina shines,       And studs with squander'd stars his dusky mines;       Long threads of netted gold, and silvery darts,  410  Inlay the Lazuli, and pierce the Quartz;--       --Whence roof'd with silver beam'd PERU, of old,       And hapless MEXICO was paved with gold.           \"Heavens! on my sight what sanguine colours blaze!

Mr. Savery or Mr. Volney in their Travels  through Egypt has given a curious description of one of the pyramids,  with the operose method of closing them, and immuring the body, (as they  supposed) for six thousand years.

They  should be kept up and fed with corn at least six weeks before they  are killed, or their flesh will acquire a disagreeable taste from  the trash and offal which they eat when running at large. The  Portuguese pork, which is fed on chestnuts, is perhaps the finest  in the world.    If the meat is young, the lean will break on being pinched, and  the skin will dent by nipping it with the fingers; the fat will be  white, soft, and pulpy. If the skin or rind is rough, and cannot  he nipped, it is old.    Hams that have short shank-bones, are generally preferred. If you  put a knife under the bone of a ham, and it comes out clean, the  meat is good; but quite the contrary if the knife appears smeared  and slimy. In good bacon the fat is white, and the lean sticks  close to the bone; if it is streaked with yellow, the meat is  rusty, and unfit to eat.    Pork in every form should be thoroughly cooked. If the least  under-done, it is disgusting and unwholesome.      TO ROAST A PIG.    Begin your preparations by making the stuffing. Take a sufficient  quantity of grated stale bread, and mix it with sage and sweet  marjoram rubbed fine or powdered; also some grated lemon-peel.  Season it with pepper, salt, powdered nutmeg and mace; mix in  butter enough to moisten it, and some beaten yolk of egg to bind  it. Let the whole be very well incorporated.    The pig should be newly killed, (that morning if possible,) nicely  cleaned, fat, and not too large. Wash it well in cold water, and  cut off the feet close to the joints, leaving some skin all round  to fold over the ends. Take out the liver and heart, and reserve  them, with the feet, to make the gravy. Truss back the legs. Fill  the body with the stuffing (it must be quite full) and then sew it  up, or tie it round with a buttered twine. Put the pig on the  spit, and place it before a clear brisk fire, but not too near  lest it scorch. The fire should be largest at the ends, that the  middle of the pig may not be done before the extremities. If you  find the heat too great in the centre, you may diminish it by  placing a flat-iron before the fire. When you first put it down,  wash the pig all over with salt and water; afterwards rub it  frequently with a feather dipped in sweet oil, or with fresh  butter tied in a rag. If you baste it with any thing else, or with  its own dripping, the skin will not be crisp. Take care not to  blister or burn the outside by keeping it too near the fire. A  good sized pig will require at least three hours' roasting.    Unless a pig is very small it is seldom sent to table whole. Take  the spit from the fire, and place it across a large dish: then,  having cut off the head with a sharp knife, and cut down the back,  slip the spit out. Lay the two halves of the body close together  in the dish, and place half the head on each side. Garnish with  sliced lemon.    For the gravy,--take, that from the dripping-pan and skim it well.  Having boiled the heart, liver, and feet, with some minced sage in  a very little water, cut the meat from the feet, and chop it. Chop  also the liver and heart. Put all into a small sauce-pan, adding a  little of the water that they were boiled in, and some bits of  butter rolled in flour. Flavour it with a glass of Madeira, and  some grated nutmeg. Give it a boil up, and send it to table in a  gravy-boat.    You may serve up with the pig, apple-sauce, cranberry sauce, or  bread-sauce in a small tureen; or currant jelly.    If you bake the pig instead of roasting it, rub it from time to  time with fresh butter tied in a rag.      TO ROAST A LEG OF PORK.    Take a sharp knife and score the skin across in narrow stripes  (you may cross it again so as to form diamonds) and rub in some  powdered sage. Raise the skin at the knuckle, and put in a  stuffing of minced onion and sage, bread-crumbs, pepper, salt, and  beaten yolk of egg. Fasten it down with a buttered string, or with  skewers. You may make deep incisions in the meat of the large end  of the leg, and stuff them also; pressing in the filling very  hard. Rub a little sweet oil all over the skin with a brush or a  goose feather, to make it crisp and of a handsome brown. Do not  place the spit too near the fire, lest the skin should burn and  blister. A leg of pork will require from three to four hours to  roast. Moisten it all the time by brushing it with sweet oil, or  with fresh butter tied in a rag. To baste it with its own dripping  will make the skin tough and hard. Skim the fat carefully from the  gravy, which should be thickened with a little flour.    A roast leg of pork should always be accompanied by apple-sauce,  and by mashed potato and mashed turnips.      TO ROAST A LOIN OF PORK.    Score the skin in narrow strips, and rub it all over with a  mixture of powdered sage leaves, pepper and salt. Have ready a  force-meat or stuffing of minced onions and sage, mixed with a  little grated bread and beaten yolk of egg, and seasoned with  pepper and salt. Make deep incisions between the ribs and fill  them with this stuffing. Put it on the spit before a clear fire  and moisten it with butter or sweet oil, rubbed lightly over it.  It will require three hours to roast.    Having skimmed the gravy well, thicken it with a little flour, and  serve it up in a boat. Have ready some apple-sauce to eat with the  pork. Also mashed turnips and mashed potatoes.    You may roast in the same manner, a shoulder, spare-rib, or chine  of pork; seasoning it with sage and onion.      TO ROAST A MIDDLING OR SPRING PIECE OF PORK.    Make a force-meat of grated bread, and minced onion and sage,  pepper, salt, and beaten yolk of egg; mix it well, and spread it  all over the inside of the pork. Then roll up the meat, and with a  sharp knife score it round in circles, rubbing powdered sage into  the cuts. Tie a buttered twine round the roll of meat so as to  keep it together in every direction. Put a hook through one end,  and roast the pork before a clear brisk fire, moistening the skin  occasionally with butter. Or you may bake it in a Dutch oven. It  is a good side dish. Thicken the gravy with a little flour, and  flavour it with a glass of wine. Have currant jelly to eat with  it.    It should be delicate young pork.      TO STEW PORK.    Take a nice piece of the fillet or leg of fresh pork; rub it with  a little salt, and score the skin. Put it into a pot with  sufficient water to cover it, and stew it gently for two hours or  more, in proportion to its size. Then put into the same pot a  dozen or more sweet potatoes, scraped, split, and cut in pieces.  Let the whole stew gently together for an hour and a half, or till  all is thoroughly done, skimming it frequently. Serve up all  together in a large dish.    This stew will be found very good. For sweet potatoes you may  substitute white ones mixed with sliced turnips, or parsnips  scraped or split.      TO BOIL CORNED PORK.    Take a nice piece of fresh pork, (the leg is the best,) rub it  with salt, and let it lie in the salt two days. Boil it slowly in  plenty of water, skimming it well. When the meat is about half  done, you may put into the same pot a fine cabbage, washed clean  and quartered. The pork and the cabbage should be thoroughly done,  and tender throughout. Send them to table in separate dishes,  having drained and squeezed all the water out of the cabbage. Take  off the skin of the pork, and touch the outside at intervals with  spots of cayenne pepper. Eat mustard with it.    Pork is never boiled unless corned or salted.      PICKLED PORK AND PEASE PUDDING.    Soak the pork all night in cold water, and wash and scrape it  clean. Put it on early in the day, as it will take a long time to  boil, and must boil slowly. Skim it frequently. Boil in a separate  pot greens or cabbage to eat with it; also parsnips and potatoes.    Pease pudding is a frequent accompaniment to pickled pork, and is  very generally liked. To make a small pudding, you must have ready  a quart of dried split pease, which have been soaked all night in  cold water. Tie them in a cloth, (leaving room for them to swell,)  and boil them slowly till they are tender. Drain them, and rub  them through a cullender or a sieve into a deep dish; season them  with pepper and salt, and mix with them an ounce of butter, and  two beaten eggs. Beat all well together till thoroughly mixed. Dip  a clean cloth in hot water, sprinkle it with flour, and put the  pudding into it. Tie it up very tightly, leaving a small space  between the mixture and the tying, (as the pudding will still  swell a little,) and boil it an hour longer. Send it to table and  eat it with the pork.    You may make a pease pudding in a plain and less delicate way, by  simply seasoning the pease with pepper and salt, (having first  soaked them well,) tying them in a cloth, and putting them to boil  in the same pot with the pork, taking care to make the string very  tight, so that the water may not get in. When all is done, and you  turn out the pudding, cut it into thick slices and lay it round  the pork.    Pickled pork is frequently accompanied by dried beans and hominy.      PORK AND BEANS.    Allow two pounds of pickled pork to two quarts of dried beans. If  the meat is very salt put it in soak over night. Put the beans  into a pot with cold water, and let them hang all night over the  embers of the fire, or set them in the chimney corner, that they  may warm as well as soak. Early in the morning rinse them through  a cullender. Score the rind of the pork, (which should not be a  very fat piece,) and put the meat into a clean pot with the beans,  which must be seasoned with pepper. Let them boil slowly together  for about two hours, and carefully remove all the scum and fat  that rises to the top. Then take them out; lay the pork in a tin  pan, and cover the meat with the beans, adding a very little  water. Put it into an oven, and bake it four "]]]
