The trapper, as had been his invariable custom, had carefully noted  the contour of the surrounding prairie, before they had committed the  important act of encamping in the gorge or hollow. He remembered the  grove at some distance, and was satisfied that the barbarians had left  their horses there, while they had gathered behind the wall to wait  the critical moment.    By the time these thoughts had fairly taken shape in his brain it was  beginning to grow light, and with a premonitary yawn and kick he rose  to his feet and began stirring the fire. He was well aware that  although he and his companions were a fair target for the rifles of  their enemies, yet they would not fire. Their plan of action did not  comprehend that, though it would have settled everything in their  favor without delay.    'I declare I have been asleep!' exclaimed Brainerd, as he began  rubbing his eyes.    'Yes. You're a purty feller to make a sentinel of, ain't you?' replied  the trapper, in disgust.    'I hope nothing has happened.' answered Johnny, feeling that he  deserved all the blame that could be laid upon him.    'Not much, exceptin' while yer war snoozin' the reds have come down  and got us all in a nice box.'    The boy was certain he was jesting until he saw the expression of his  face.    'Surely, Baldy, it is not as bad as that?'    'Do you see that ar?' demanded the trapper, pointing toward the wall,  which the youngster could not help observing.    'How comes that to be there?'    'The red-skins put it thar. Can yer steam man walk over that?'    'Certainly not; but we can remove them.'    'Do yer want to try it, younker?'    'I'm willing to help.'    'Do yer know that ar' somethin' less nor a hundred red-skins ahind  them, jist waitin' fur yer to try that thing?'    'Good heavens! can it be possible?'    'Ef you don't b'l'eve it, go out and look for yerself, that's all.'    The boy, for the first time, comprehends the peril in which he had  brought his friends by his own remissness, and his self-accusation was  so great, that, for a few moments, he forgot the fact that he was  exposed to the greatest danger of his life.    By this time Ethan and Mickey awoke, and were soon made to understand  their predicament. As a matter of course, they were all disposed to  blame the author of this; but when they saw how deeply he felt his own  shortcoming, all three felt a natural sympathy for him.    'There's no use of talkin' how we came to get hyar,' was the  philosophical remark of the trapper; 'it's 'nongh to know that we are  hyar, with a mighty slim chance of ever gettin' out ag'in.'    'It's enough to make a chap feel down in the mouth, as me friend Jonah  observed when he went down the throat of the whale,' said Mickey.    'How is it they don't shoot us?' asked Hopkins; 'we can't git out of  their way, and they've got us in fair range.'    'What's the use of doin' that? Ef they kill us, that'll be the end  on't; but ef they put thar claws on us, they've got us sure, and can  have a good time toastin' us while they yelp and dance around.'    All shuddered at the fearful picture drawn by the hunter.    'Jerusalem! don't I wish I was to hum in Connecticut!'    'And it's myself that would be plaised to be sitting in the parlor at  Ballyduff wid me own Bridget Moghlaghigbogh, listenin' while she  breathed swate vows, after making her supper upon praties and inions.'    'I think I'd ruther be hyar,' was the commentary of the trapper upon  the expressed wish of the Irishman.    'Why can't yees touch up the staammau, and make him hop owver them  shtones?' asked Mickey, turning toward the boy, whom, it was noted,  appeared to be in deep reverie again.    Not until he was addressed several times did he look up. Then he  merely shook his head, to signify that the thing was impossible.    'Any fool might know better than that.' remarked the Yankee, 'for if  he could jump over, where would be the wagon?'    'That 'ud foller, av coorse.'    'No; there's no way of getting the steam man out of here. He is a gone  case, sure, and it looks as though we were ditto. Jerusalem! I wish  all the gold was back in Wolf Ravine, and we war a thousand miles from  this place.'    'Wishing'll do no good; there's only one chance I see, and that ain't  no chance at all.'    All, including the boy, eagerly looked up to hear the explanation.    'Some distance from hyar is some timbers, and in thar the reds have  left their animals. Ef we start on a run for the timbers, git thar  ahead of the Ingins, mount thar hosses and put, thar'll be some  chance. Yer can see what chance thar is fur that.'    It looked as hopeless as the charge of the Light Brigade.    Young Brainerd now spoke.    'It was I who got you into trouble, and it is I, that, with the  blessing of Heaven, am going to get you out of it.'    The three now looked eagerly at him.    'Is there no danger of the Indians firing upon us?' he asked of the  hunter.    'Not unless we try to run away.'    'All right; it is time to begin.'    The boy's first proceeding was to kindle a fire in the boiler of the  steam man. When it was fairly blazing, he continued to heap in wood,  until a fervent heat was produced such as it had never experienced  before. Still he threw in wood, and kept the water low in the boiler,  until there was a most prodigious pressure of steam, making its escape  at half a dozen orifices.    When all the wood was thrown in that it could contain, and portions of  the iron sheeting could be seen becoming red-hot, he ceased this, and  began trying the steam.    'How much can he hold?' inquired Hopkins.    'One hundred and fifty pounds.'    'How much is on now?'    'One hundred and forty-eight, and rising.'    'Good heavens! it will blow up!' was the exclamation, as the three  shrunk back, appalled at the danger.    'Not for a few minutes; have you the gold secured, and the guns, so as  to be ready to run?'    They were ready to run at any moment; the gold was always secured  about their persons and it required but a moment to snatch up the  weapons.    'When it blows up, run!' was the admonition of the boy.    The steam man was turned directly toward the wall, and a full head of  steam let on. It started away with a bound, instantly reaching a speed  of forty miles an hour.    The next moment it struck the bowlders with a terrific crash, shot on  over its face, leaving the splintered wagon behind, and at the instant  of touching ground upon the opposite side directly among the  thunderstruck Indians, it exploded its boiler!    The shock of the explosion was terrible. It was like the bursting of  an immense bomb-shell, the steam man being blown into thousands of  fragments, that scattered death and destruction in every direction.  Falling in the very center of the crouching Indians, it could but make  a terrible destruction of life, while those who escaped unharmed, were  beside themselves with consternation.    This was the very thing upon which young Brainerd had counted, and for  which he made his calculations. When he saw it leap toward the wall in  such a furious manner, he knew the inevitable consequence, and gave  the word to his friends to take to their legs.    All three dashed up the bank, and reaching the surface of the prairie,  Baldy Bicknell took the lead, exclaiming:    'Now fur the wood yonder!'    As they reached the grove, one or two of the number glanced back, but  saw nothing of the pursuing Indians. They had not yet recovered from  their terror.    Not a moment was to be lost. The experienced eye of the trapper lost  no time in selecting the very best Indian horses, and a moment later  all four rode out from the grove at a full gallop, and headed toward  the Missouri.    The precise result of the steam man's explosion was never learned. How  many wore killed and wounded could only be conjectured; but the number  certainly was so great that our friends saw nothing more of them.    They evidently had among their number those who had become pretty well  acquainted with the steam man, else they would not have laid the plan  which they did for capturing him.    Being well mounted, the party made the entire journey to Independence  on horseback. From this point they took passage to St. Louis, where  the gold was divided, and the party separated, and since then have  seen nothing of each other.    Mickey McSquizzle returned to Ballyduff Kings County, Ireland, where,  we heard, he and his gentle Bridget, are in the full enjoyment of the  three thousand pounds he carried with him.    Ethan Hopkins settled down with the girl of his choice in Connecticut,  where, at last accounts, he was doing as well as could be expected.    Baldy Bicknell, although quite a wealthy man, still clings to his  wandering habits, and spends the greater portion of his time on the  prairies.    With the large amount of money realized from his western trip, Johnny  Brainerd is educating himself at one of the best schools in the  country. When he shall have completed his course, it is his intention  to construct another steam man, capable of more wonderful performances  than the first.    So let our readers and the public generally be on the lookout.        THE END."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7509"],[0,"The Logbooks of the Lady Nelson (#17)"],[1," officer and five armed men to the river for fresh water...at 10  A.M. stood further up the harbour.    \"Tuesday, 8th December. At 4 P.M. came to an anchor off Lady Nelson's  Point and I went on shore and shot a few birds. At 2 P.M. came on board;  up anchor and ran over into 2 fathoms water as near the mouth of river as  possible. A.M. I went in the gig to Churchill's Island and there found  everything as we left it--I mean the remains of our fires and huts; the  wheat and corn that Lieutenant Grant had sown in April last was in full  vigour, 6 ft. high and almost ripe--the onions also were grown into seed;  the potatoes have disappeared--I fancy that the different animals that  inhabit the island must have eaten or otherwise destroyed them. I regret  not having time or men to spare to clear a large spot and sow the wheat  already grown, as the next crop would be large. I never saw finer wheat  or corn in my life, the straw being very near as large as young  sugar-cane.    \"Wednesday, 9th December. At 1 P.M. the first officer in the launch  returned on board with a load of water; on his examining the river he  reported that everything seemed the same as when we left it--a strong  presumption that no vessel had been there, as naturally they would have  replaced their water. The river has been flooded since last April, as a  temporary hut we built was found with part of the bank washed away; the  banks of the river were found all in a high state of verdure and in many  places the view is truly romantic and wild. No signs of native canoes or  huts have been discovered, indeed, there is less appearance of natives  now than when we were here last; for then many remains of huts, part of a  canoe and their beaten tracks were to be found on all parts of the banks  of this little river, all of which have vanished. The party caught and  shot 5 pairs of swans, out of which 3 pairs were young, and brought on  board alive, the others were old and we made some fresh meals from them;  they also brought on board a pair of young geese which however are very  scarce, but few parrots--the ducks are as shy as ever...At 3 P.M. sent  the second mate to Churchill's Island to cut down the wheat on purpose to  feed the young swans with it, at sundown they returned on board with it  in the whole perhaps a bushel in quantity with a good deal mixed with  oats and barley all fine of their kind--some potatoes were also found and  2 onions. At 8 A.M. the launch returned with a load of water, the officer  reported that George Yates had gone to sleep on watch, left the launch  deep loaded in imminent danger of being swamped as the tide rose, and  moreover the whole boat's crew in danger of being surprised by natives if  any should be about, for which crimes I punished him with two dozen  lashes this being an old offence of his--I pardoned him three different  times some time back for sleeping on his watch at Sydney...    \"Friday, 11th December. The very favourable weather we have had since our  arrival here is to be thanked for enabling us to so soon fill our water  as I expected this business would have detained me 9 or 10 days. At noon  ran over to Lady Nelson's Point and there anchored in the mouth of Salt  Water Lagoon--7 fathoms.    \"Saturday, 12th December. Sent the first mate up Salt Water Lagoon to get  swans; he, however, found none but in afternoon and evening shot two  large ones at Lady Nelson's Point. P.M. Having discovered that Robert  Warren had laid an infamous plan to get the first mate, Mr. Bowen, broke  and otherwise disgraced by acquainting me and all the company belonging  to the vessel that he was a notorious thief and embezzler of King's  stores, I, upon the fullest and clearest investigation of the matter,  finding it to be a most diabolical falsehood put Warren in double irons  intending to deliver him up to the rigour of the civil law on our arrival  at Sydney should a speedier way of sending him not occur during the  cruise. A.M. Sent the first mate to the north-west Branch in the gig to  look for water swans and birds.    \"Sunday, 13th December. At 8 A.M. the first mate returned in the gig  having shot 9 large and small swans, the large ones when fit for use  weighed 8 and 9 pounds each. At sunset native fires on ye distant hills.    \"Monday, 14th December. Sent the first mate and party in a launch to  overhaul the back of Tortoise Point.    \"Tuesday, 15th December. A.M. Hove up and ran over into Elizabeth's Cove  where we anchored. Sent first mate and boat's crew down to Seal Island to  procure some skins...    \"Wednesday, 16th December. I walked along the beach 6 or 7 miles, but saw  no signs of any strangers being here since we left this place.    \"At 4 P.M. I returned on board, the launch also came on board, they  knocked down a few seals but there was too much surf, in consequence the  officer returned, he reported that no person could have visited that  island since we left this harbour as the seals were as plentiful as ever  and several thousand pups lying on shore. As it continued calm all night,  and seeing we could proceed to sea this day; I again sent him with a  party to Seal Island to get some of the skins both as specimens for  Government and for our own uses as several of the people were without  hats or shoes...Served out fishing line and 4 hooks to each mess, the  crew of the launch having yesterday caught several rock fish at Grant's  Point.    \"Thursday, 17th December. Making ready for sea. Observed that for these  several days past the native fires had advanced nearer to us, and this  day saw one fire that could be no more than 4 or 5 miles inland.    \"Friday, 18th December. At 2 P.M. the first mate and party returned from  Seal Island with some skins which run very small...This time the officer  found remains of fires and a number of bamboo pegs, also a club. The  Harrington must have been here, but where she could have lain at anchor  we could not discover; if any place along this beach, it is curious that  not the least signs of her are to be found--as I walked down from one end  almost to the other. P.M. I sent Bond and Missing, two soldiers, to cut  some more wood, doing which they were fortunate enough to discover a  spring of water...I went on shore and found on clearing it with our hands  that at once we got 100 gallons of very good water...In the morning a  spring was found that proved equal to the watering in a few days a line  of battleships. Pleased with this circumstance took a gang of hands on  shore and made a good road to it, we also cleared the spring of all the  dirt, roots and boughs of fallen and decayed trees that had got into  it...we bailed out of it at least 2 or 3 tons of water and found the  bottom to be a rock of very large stones collected together...in half an  hour after it was entirely empty it was again quite full of clear good  water. We now filled all our empty casks and everything on board that  would hold water intending to go to sea when the wind would permit. As in  this cove wood is in plenty, and the water is not above 50 yards from the  seaside; a vessel of any size may be wooded and watered in two or three  days and ride secure from all wind either close in or further out. It is  the best place in the harbour for any vessel to lay in whether her stay  is short or long...The soil of this island as far as we have penetrated  is very sandy; no black mould is seen, the trees are very small and very  decayed, nor does the small shrubbery grow with much vigour although  pleasing to the eye; in short this cove and island can supply a ship in  abundance with what is generally considered the greatest of her wants yet  I fancy it would poorly pay a settler. To-day we saw a fire which I fancy  could not have been more than 4 miles from Tortoise Point and perhaps 7  from the vessel.    \"Saturday, 19th December. Finished the pathway to watering-place, having  made it level and fit  to roll butts on. At 5 P.M. saw a large fire lighted on the opposite  beach nearer the entrance of the harbour, it might be 6 or 7 miles from  the vessel, and in a little time it was left, and nearer to us, at a  little distance from the beach, another very large fire was made.  Expecting from this that in the morning I should be able to speak to them  I made a large fire abreast of where we lay, the natives could not miss  seeing it. In the morning no fires were to be seen which was rather odd,  as besides this nearest fire, last night there were several others in  sight...A.M. I got a large board hung up at the entrance of the road to  the well or spring on which was painted, in oil colours, directions for  any stranger how to get to the watering-place...    \"Friday, 25th December. At noon suddenly taken with most violent squall  at West...this hurricane of wind increased so rapidly and with such fury  that we were obliged to let go the best bower and till all 3 anchors bore  the strain she dragged a little, struck top-gallant-mast. This squall  continued for 4 hours, then settled into a westerly gale with constant  thunder and lightning and at intervals very hard rain and also more sea  than I supposed possible in this cove. At 11 P.M. parted our warp, my  uneasiness at this was not a little however the S.B.* (* Small bower,  that is the port bower.) a little relieved by best bower held on at  night...    \"Saturday, 26th December. From noon till 3 P.M. the gale continued to  increase and a sea got up still higher than it had yet been at any time  since the gale began...Made all as snug as possible for riding out the  gale, the hardest by far I ever saw in this country, and as it blew dead  on the shore outside nothing less than the greatest providence could have  saved us had we got to sea either of the times I attempted it. At  half-past 6 P.M. a lull with the appearance of good weather...7 P.M. the  weather looking very bad, made a run for Lady Nelson's Point, the gale  following"]]]
