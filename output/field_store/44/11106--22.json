Just a few are found with the courage to  say they were deluded, and warn other aspirants. Meeting such a one, call  him a good man, a true and an honest; nay, call him philosopher, if you  will; to my mind, the name is his or no one's; the rest either have no  knowledge of the truth, though they think they have, or else have  knowledge and hide it, shamefaced cowards clinging to reputation.    But now for goodness' sake let us drop all this, cover it up with an  amnesty, and let it be as if it had not been said; let us, assume that  the Stoic philosophy, and no other, is correct; then we can examine  whether it is practicable and possible, or its disciples wasting their  pains; it makes wonderful promises, I am told, about the Happiness in  store for those who reach the summit; for none but they shall enter into  full possession of the true Good. The next point you must help me with--  whether you have ever met such a Stoic, such a pattern of Stoicism, as to  be unconscious of pain, untempted by pleasure, free from wrath, superior  to envy, contemptuous of wealth, and, in one word, Happy; such should the  example and model of the Virtuous life be; for any one who falls short in  the slightest degree, even though he is better than other men at all  points, is not complete, and in that case not yet Happy.    _Her_. I never saw such a man.    _Ly_. I am glad you do not palter with the truth. But what are your hopes  in pursuing philosophy, then? You see that neither your own teacher, nor  his, nor his again, and so on to the tenth generation, has been absolutely  wise and so attained Happiness. It will not serve you to say that it is  enough to get near Happiness; that is no good; a person on the doorstep is  just as much outside and in the air as another a long way off, though with  the difference that the former is tantalized by a nearer view. So it is to  get into the neighbourhood of Happiness--I will grant you so much--that  you toil like this, wearing yourself away, letting this great portion of  your life slip from you, while you are sunk in dullness and wakeful  weariness; and you are to go on with it for twenty more years at the  least, you tell me, to take your place when you are eighty--always  assuming some one to assure you that length of days--in the ranks of the  not yet Happy. Or perhaps you reckon on being the exception; you are to  crown your pursuit by attaining what many a good man before you, swifter  far, has pursued and never overtaken.    Well, overtake it, if that is your plan, grasp it and have it whole, this  something, mysterious to me, of which the possession is sufficient reward  for such toils; this something which I wonder how long you will have the  enjoyment of, old man that you will be, past all pleasure, with one foot  in the grave; ah, but perhaps, like a brave soul, you are getting ready  for another life, that you may spend it the better when you come to it,  having learned how to live: as though one should take so long preparing  and elaborating a superlative dinner that he fainted with hunger and  exhaustion!    However, there is another thing I do not think you have observed: Virtue  is manifested, of course, in action, in doing what is just and wise and  manly; but you--and when I say you, I mean the most advanced  philosophers--you do not seek these things and ensue them, but spend the  greater part of your life conning over miserable sentences and  demonstrations and problems; it is the man who does best at these that  you hail a glorious victor. And I believe that is why you admire this  experienced old professor of yours: he nonplusses his associates, knows  how to put crafty questions and inveigle you into pitfalls; so you pay no  attention to the fruit--which consists in action--, but are extremely  busy with the husks, and smother each other with the leaves in your  debates; come now, Hermotimus, what else are you about from morning to  night?    _Her_. Nothing; that is what it comes to.    _Ly_. Is it wronging you to say that you hunt the shadow or the snake's  dead slough, and neglect the solid body or the creeping thing itself? You  are no better than a man pouring water into a mortar and braying it with  an iron pestle; he thinks he is doing a necessary useful job, whereas, let  him bray till all's blue (excuse the slang), the water is as much water as  ever it was.    And here let me ask you whether, putting aside his discourse, you would  choose to resemble your master, and be as passionate, as sordid, as  quarrelsome, ay, and as addicted to pleasure (though that trait of his is  not generally known). Why no answer, Hermotimus? Shall I tell you a plea  for philosophy which I lately heard? It was from the mouth of an old, old  man, who has quite a company of young disciples. He was angrily demanding  his fees from one of these; they were long overdue, he said; the day  stated in the agreement was the first of the month, and it was now the  fifteenth.    The youth's uncle was there, a rustic person without any notion of your  refinements; and by way of stilling the storm, _Come, come, sir_, says he,  _you need not make such a fuss because we have bought words of you and not  yet settled the bill. As to what you have sold us, you have got it still;  your stock of learning is none the less; and in what I really sent the boy  to you for, you have not improved him a bit; he has carried off and  seduced neighbour Echecrates's daughter, and there would have been an  action for assault, only Echecrates is a poor man; but the prank cost me a  couple of hundred. And the other day he struck his mother; she had tried  to stop him when he was smuggling wine out of the house, for one of his  club-dinners, I suppose. As to temper and conceit and impudence and brass  and lying, he was not half so bad twelve months ago as he is now. That is  where I should have liked him to profit by your teaching; and we could  have done, without his knowing the stuff he reels of at table every day:  'a crocodile [Footnote: See _Puzzles_ in Notes.] seized hold of a baby,'  says he, 'and promised to give it back if its father could answer'--the  Lord knows what; or how, 'day [Footnote: See _Puzzles_ in Notes.] being,  night cannot be'; and sometimes his worship twists round what we say  somehow or other, till there we are with horns [Footnote: See _Puzzles_ in  Notes.] on our heads! We just laugh at it--most of all when he stuffs up  his ears and repeats to himself what he calls temperaments and conditions  and conceptions and impressions, and a lot more like that. And he tells us  God is not in heaven, but goes about in everything, wood and stone and  animals--the meanest of them, too; and if his mother asks him why he talks  such stuff, he laughs at her and says if once he gets the 'stuff' pat off,  there will be nothing to prevent him from being the only rich man, the  only king, and counting every one else slaves and offscourings._    When he had finished, mark the reverend philosopher's answer. _You should  consider_, he said, _that if he had never come to me, he would have  behaved far worse--very possibly have come to the gallows. As it is,  philosophy and the respect he has for it have been a check upon him, so  that you find he keeps within bounds and is not quite unbearable; the  philosophic system and name tutor him with their presence, and the  thought of disgracing them shames him. I should be quite justified in  taking your money, if not for any positive improvement I have effected,  yet for the abstentions due to his respect for philosophy; the very  nurses will tell you as much: children should go to school, because, even  if they are not old enough to learn, they will at least be out of  mischief there. My conscience is quite easy about him; if you like to  select any of your friends who is acquainted with Stoicism and bring him  here to-morrow, you shall see how the boy can question and answer, how  much he has learnt, how many books he has read on axioms, syllogisms,  conceptions, duty, and all sorts of subjects. As for his hitting his  mother or seducing girls, what have I to do with that? am I his keeper?_    A dignified defence of philosophy for an old man! Perhaps _you_ will say  too that it is a good enough reason for pursuing it, if it will keep us  from worse employments. Were our original expectations from philosophy  at all of a different nature, by the way? did they contemplate anything  beyond a more decent behaviour than the average? Why this obstinate  silence?    _Her_. Oh, why but that I could cry like a baby? It cuts me to the  heart, it is all so true; it is too much for me, when I think of my  wretched, wasted years--paying all that money for my own labour, too! I  am sober again after a debauch, I see what the object of my maudlin  affection is like, and what it has brought upon me.    _Ly_. No need for tears, dear fellow; that is a very sensible fable  of Aesop's. A man sat on the shore and counted the waves breaking;  missing count, he was excessively annoyed. But the fox came up and said  to him: 'Why vex yourself, good sir, over the past ones? you should let  them go, and begin counting afresh.' So you, since this is your mind, had  better reconcile yourself now to living like an ordinary man; you will  give up your extravagant haughty hopes and put yourself on a level with  the commonalty; if you are sensible, you will not be ashamed to unlearn  in your old age, and change your course for a better.    Now I beg you not to fancy that I have said all this as an anti-Stoic,  moved by any special dislike of your school; my arguments hold against  all schools. I should have said just the same if you had chosen Plato or  Aristotle,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6593"],[0,"History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (#17)"],[1,"ocence, though he  admitted he had made the above-mentioned confession; which he however  endeavoured to account for, by protesting that he was forced into it  by the continued importunity she used: who vowed, that, as she was  sure of his guilt, she would never leave tormenting him till he had  owned it; and faithfully promised, that, in such case, she would never  mention it to him more. Hence, he said, he had been induced falsely to  confess himself guilty, though he was innocent; and that he believed  he should have confest a murder from the same motive.    Mrs Partridge could not bear this imputation with patience; and having  no other remedy in the present place but tears, she called forth a  plentiful assistance from them, and then addressing herself to Mr  Allworthy, she said (or rather cried), \"May it please your worship,  there never was any poor woman so injured as I am by that base man;  for this is not the only instance of his falsehood to me. No, may it  please your worship, he hath injured my bed many's the good time and  often. I could have put up with his drunkenness and neglect of his  business, if he had not broke one of the sacred commandments. Besides,  if it had been out of doors I had not mattered it so much; but with my  own servant, in my own house, under my own roof, to defile my own  chaste bed, which to be sure he hath, with his beastly stinking  whores. Yes, you villain, you have defiled my own bed, you have; and  then you have charged me with bullocking you into owning the truth. It  is very likely, an't please your worship, that I should bullock him? I  have marks enow about my body to show of his cruelty to me. If you had  been a man, you villain, you would have scorned to injure a woman in  that manner. But you an't half a man, you know it. Nor have you been  half a husband to me. You need run after whores, you need, when I'm  sure--And since he provokes me, I am ready, an't please your worship,  to take my bodily oath that I found them a-bed together. What, you  have forgot, I suppose, when you beat me into a fit, and made the  blood run down my forehead, because I only civilly taxed you with  adultery! but I can prove it by all my neighbours. You have almost  broke my heart, you have, you have.\"    Here Mr Allworthy interrupted, and begged her to be pacified,  promising her that she should have justice; then turning to Partridge,  who stood aghast, one half of his wits being hurried away by surprize  and the other half by fear, he said he was sorry to see there was so  wicked a man in the world. He assured him that his prevaricating and  lying backward and forward was a great aggravation of his guilt; for  which the only atonement he could make was by confession and  repentance. He exhorted him, therefore, to begin by immediately  confessing the fact, and not to persist in denying what was so plainly  proved against him even by his own wife.    Here, reader, I beg your patience a moment, while I make a just  compliment to the great wisdom and sagacity of our law, which refuses  to admit the evidence of a wife for or against her husband. This, says  a certain learned author, who, I believe, was never quoted before in  any but a law-book, would be the means of creating an eternal  dissension between them. It would, indeed, be the means of much  perjury, and of much whipping, fining, imprisoning, transporting, and  hanging.    Partridge stood a while silent, till, being bid to speak, he said he  had already spoken the truth, and appealed to Heaven for his  innocence, and lastly to the girl herself, whom he desired his worship  immediately to send for; for he was ignorant, or at least pretended to  be so, that she had left that part of the country.    Mr Allworthy, whose natural love of justice, joined to his coolness of  temper, made him always a most patient magistrate in hearing all the  witnesses which an accused person could produce in his defence, agreed  to defer his final determination of this matter till the arrival of  Jenny, for whom he immediately dispatched a messenger; and then having  recommended peace between Partridge and his wife (though he addressed  himself chiefly to the wrong person), he appointed them to attend  again the third day; for he had sent Jenny a whole day's journey from  his own house.    At the appointed time the parties all assembled, when the messenger  returning brought word, that Jenny was not to be found; for that she  had left her habitation a few days before, in company with a  recruiting officer.    Mr Allworthy then declared that the evidence of such a slut as she  appeared to be would have deserved no credit; but he said he could not  help thinking that, had she been present, and would have declared the  truth, she must have confirmed what so many circumstances, together  with his own confession, and the declaration of his wife that she had  caught her husband in the fact, did sufficiently prove. He therefore  once more exhorted Partridge to confess; but he still avowing his  innocence, Mr Allworthy declared himself satisfied of his guilt, and  that he was too bad a man to receive any encouragement from him. He  therefore deprived him of his annuity, and recommended repentance to  him on account of another world, and industry to maintain himself and  his wife in this.    There were not, perhaps, many more unhappy persons than poor  Partridge. He had lost the best part of his income by the evidence of  his wife, and yet was daily upbraided by her for having, among other  things, been the occasion of depriving her of that benefit; but such  was his fortune, and he was obliged to submit to it.    Though I called him poor Partridge in the last paragraph, I would have  the reader rather impute that epithet to the compassion in my temper  than conceive it to be any declaration of his innocence. Whether he  was innocent or not will perhaps appear hereafter; but if the historic  muse hath entrusted me with any secrets, I will by no means be guilty  of discovering them till she shall give me leave.    Here therefore the reader must suspend his curiosity. Certain it is  that, whatever was the truth of the case, there was evidence more than  sufficient to convict him before Allworthy; indeed, much less would  have satisfied a bench of justices on an order of bastardy; and yet,  notwithstanding the positiveness of Mrs Partridge, who would have  taken the sacrament upon the matter, there is a possibility that the  schoolmaster was entirely innocent: for though it appeared clear on  comparing the time when Jenny departed from Little Baddington with  that of her delivery that she had there conceived this infant, yet it  by no means followed of necessity that Partridge must have been its  father; for, to omit other particulars, there was in the same house a  lad near eighteen, between whom and Jenny there had subsisted  sufficient intimacy to found a reasonable suspicion; and yet, so blind  is jealousy, this circumstance never once entered into the head of the  enraged wife.    Whether Partridge repented or not, according to Mr Allworthy's advice,  is not so apparent. Certain it is that his wife repented heartily of  the evidence she had given against him: especially when she found Mrs  Deborah had deceived her, and refused to make any application to Mr  Allworthy on her behalf. She had, however, somewhat better success  with Mrs Blifil, who was, as the reader must have perceived, a much  better-tempered woman, and very kindly undertook to solicit her  brother to restore the annuity; in which, though good-nature might  have some share, yet a stronger and more natural motive will appear in  the next chapter.    These solicitations were nevertheless unsuccessful: for though Mr  Allworthy did not think, with some late writers, that mercy consists  only in punishing offenders; yet he was as far from thinking that it  is proper to this excellent quality to pardon great criminals  wantonly, without any reason whatever. Any doubtfulness of the fact,  or any circumstance of mitigation, was never disregarded: but the  petitions of an offender, or the intercessions of others, did not in  the least affect him. In a word, he never pardoned because the  offender himself, or his friends, were unwilling that he should be  punished.    Partridge and his wife were therefore both obliged to submit to their  fate; which was indeed severe enough: for so far was he from doubling  his industry on the account of his lessened income, that he did in a  manner abandon himself to despair; and as he was by nature indolent,  that vice now increased upon him, by which means he lost the little  school he had; so that neither his wife nor himself would have had any  bread to eat, had not the charity of some good Christian interposed,  and provided them with what was just sufficient for their sustenance.    As this support was conveyed to them by an unknown hand, they  imagined, and so, I doubt not, will the reader, that Mr Allworthy  himself was their secret benefactor; who, though he would not openly  encourage vice, could yet privately relieve the distresses of the  vicious themselves, when these became too exquisite and  disproportionate to their demerit. In which light their wretchedness  appeared now to Fortune herself; for she at length took pity on this  miserable couple, and considerably lessened the wretched state of  Partridge, by putting a final end to that of his wife, who soon after  caught the small-pox, and died.    The justice which Mr Allworthy had executed on Partridge at first met  with universal approbation; but no sooner had he felt its  consequences, than his neighbours began to relent, and to  compassionate his case; and presently after, to blame that as rigour  and severity which they before called justice. They now exclaimed  against punishing in cold blood, and sang forth the praises of mercy  and forgiveness.    These cries were considerably increased by "]]]
