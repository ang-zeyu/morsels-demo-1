On the 12th the caravan reached Mussoudi, on the Ungerengeri river.  Happily for our patient donkeys this march was free from all the  annoying troubles of the jungle. Happily for ourselves also, for we had  no more the care of the packs and the anxiety about arriving at camp  before night. The packs once put firmly on the backs of our good  donkeys, they marched into camp--the road being excellent--without a  single displacement or cause for one impatient word, soon after leaving  Kisemo. A beautiful prospect, glorious in its wild nature, fragrant with  its numerous flowers and variety of sweetly-smelling shrubs, among which  I recognised the wild sage, the indigo plant, &c., terminated only  at the foot of Kira Peak and sister cones, which mark the boundaries  between Udoe and Ukami, yet distant twenty miles. Those distant  mountains formed a not unfit background to this magnificent picture  of open plain, forest patches, and sloping lawns--there was enough of  picturesqueness and sublimity in the blue mountains to render it one  complete whole. Suppose a Byron saw some of these scenes, he would be  inclined to poetize in this manner:    Morn dawns, and with it stern Udoe's hills, Dark Urrugum's rocks, and  Kira's peak, Robed half in mist, bedewed with various rills, Arrayed in  many a dun and purple streak.    When drawing near the valley of Ungerengeri, granite knobs and  protuberances of dazzling quartz showed their heads above the reddish  soil. Descending the ridge where these rocks were prominent, we found  ourselves in the sable loam deposit of the Ungerengeri, and in the midst  of teeming fields of sugar-cane and matama, Indian corn, muhogo,  and gardens of curry, egg, and cucumber plants. On the banks of the  Ungerengeri flourished the banana, and overtopping it by seventy feet  and more, shot up the stately mparamusi, the rival in beauty of the  Persian chenar and Abyssinian plane. Its trunk is straight and comely  enough for the mainmast of a first, class frigate, while its expanding  crown of leafage is distinguished from all others by its density and  vivid greenness. There were a score of varieties of the larger kind of  trees, whose far-extending branches embraced across the narrow but swift  river. The depressions of the valley and the immediate neighbourhood of  the river were choked with young forests of tiger-grass and stiff reeds.    Mussoudi is situated on a higher elevation than the average level of the  village, and consequently looks down upon its neighbours, which number a  hundred and more. It is the western extremity of Ukwere. On the western  bank of the Ungerengeri the territory of the Wakami commences. We had to  halt one day at Mussoudi because the poverty of the people prevented us  from procuring the needful amount of grain. The cause of this scantiness  in such a fertile and populous valley was, that the numerous caravans  which had preceded us had drawn heavily for their stores for the  upmarches.    On the 14th we crossed the Ungerengeri, which here flows southerly to  the southern extremity of the valley, where it bends easterly as far as  Kisemo. After crossing the river here, fordable at all times and only  twenty yards in breadth, we had another mile of the valley with its  excessively moist soil and rank growth of grass. It then ascended into  a higher elevation, and led through a forest of mparamusi, tamarind,  tamarisk, acacia, and the blooming mimosa. This ascent was continued for  two hours, when we stood upon the spine of the largest ridge, where we  could obtain free views of the wooded plain below and the distant ridges  of Kisemo, which we had but lately left. A descent of a few hundred feet  terminated in a deep but dry mtoni with a sandy bed, on the other side  of which we had to regain the elevation we had lost, and a similar  country opened into view until we found a newly-made boma with  well-built huts of grass rear a pool of water, which we at once occupied  as a halting-place for the night. The cart gave us considerable trouble;  not even our strongest donkey, though it carried with ease on its back  196 lbs., could draw the cart with a load of only 225 lbs. weight.    Early on the morning of the 15th we broke camp and started for Mikeseh.  By 8.30 A.M. we were ascending the southern face of the Kira Peak. When  we had gained the height of two hundred feet above the level of the  surrounding country, we were gratified with a magnificent view of a land  whose soil knows no Sabbath.    After travelling the spine of a ridge abutting against the southern  slope of Kira we again descended into the little valley of Kiwrima,  the first settlement we meet in Udoe, where there is always an abundant  supply of water. Two miles west of Kiwrima is Mikiseh.    On the 16th we reached Ulagalla after a few hours' march. Ulagalla is  the name of a district, or a portion of a district, lying between the  mountains of Uruguru, which bound it southerly, and the mountains of  Udoe, lying northerly and parallel with them, and but ten miles apart.  The principal part of the basin thus formed is called Ulagalla.    Muhalleh is the next settlement, and here we found ourselves in  the territory of the Waseguhha. On this march we were hemmed in by  mountains--on our left by those of Uruguru, on our right by those of  Udoe and Useguhha--a most agreeable and welcome change to us after  the long miles of monotonous level we had hitherto seen. When tired of  looking into the depths of the forest that still ran on either side  of the road, we had but to look up to the mountain's base, to note its  strange trees, its plants and vari-coloured flowers, we had but to raise  our heads to vary this pleasant occupation by observing the lengthy and  sinuous spine of the mountains, and mentally report upon their outline,  their spurs, their projections and ravines, their bulging rocks and deep  clefts, and, above all, the dark green woods clothing them from summit  to base. And when our attention was not required for the mundane task  of regarding the donkeys' packs, or the pace of the cautious-stepping  pagazis, it was gratifying to watch the vapours play about the mountain  summits--to see them fold into fleecy crowns and fantastic clusters,  dissolve, gather together into a pall that threatened rain, and sail  away again before the brightening sun.    At Muhalleh was the fourth caravan under Maganga with three more sick  men, who turned with eager eyes to myself, \"the dispenser of medicine,\"  as I approached. Salvos of small arms greeted me, and a present of rice  and ears of Indian corn for roasting were awaiting my acceptance; but,  as I told Maganga, I would have preferred to hear that his party were  eight or ten marches ahead. At this camp, also, we met Salim bin Rashid,  bound eastward, with a huge caravan carrying three hundred ivory tusks.  This good Arab, besides welcoming the new comer with a present of rice,  gave me news of Livingstone. He had met the old traveller at Ujiji, had  lived in the next but to him for two weeks, described him as looking  old, with long grey moustaches and beard, just recovered from severe  illness, looking very wan; when fully recovered Livingstone intended to  visit a country called Manyema by way of Marungu.    The valley of the Ungerengeri with Muhalleh exhibits wonderful  fertility. Its crops of matama were of the tallest, and its Indian  corn would rival the best crops ever seen in the Arkansas bottoms. The  numerous mountain-fed streams rendered the great depth of loam very  sloppy, in consequence of which several accidents occurred before we  reached the camp, such as wetting cloth, mildewing tea, watering sugar,  and rusting tools; but prompt attention to these necessary things saved  us from considerable loss.    There was a slight difference noticed in the demeanour and bearing of  the Waseguhha compared with the Wadoe, Wakami, and Wakwere heretofore  seen. There was none of that civility we had been until now pleased to  note: their express desire to barter was accompanied with insolent  hints that we ought to take their produce at their own prices. If  we remonstrated they became angry; retorting fiercely, impatient of  opposition, they flew into a passion, and were glib in threats. This  strange conduct, so opposite to that of the calm and gentle Wakwere,  may be excellently illustrated by comparing the manner of the hot-headed  Greek with that of the cool and collected German. Necessity compelled us  to purchase eatables of them, and, to the credit of the country and its  productions, be it said, their honey had the peculiar flavour of that of  famed Hymettus.    Following the latitudinal valley of the Ungerengeri, within two hours on  the following morning we passed close under the wall of the capital of  Useguhha--Simbamwenni. The first view of the walled town at the  western foot of the Uruguru mountains, with its fine valley abundantly  beautiful, watered by two rivers, and several pellucid streams of water  distilled by the dew and cloud-enriched heights around, was one that  we did not anticipate to meet in Eastern Africa. In Mazanderan, Persia,  such a scene would have answered our expectations, but here it was  totally unexpected. The town may contain a population of 3,000, having  about 1,000 houses; being so densely crowded, perhaps 5,000 would more  closely approximate. The houses in the town are eminently African, but  of the best type of construction. The fortifications are on an Arabic  Persic model--combining Arab neatness with Persian plan. Through a ride  of 950 miles in Persia I never met a town outside of the great cities  better fortified than Simbamwenni. In Persia the fortifications were  of mud, even those of Kasvin, Teheran, Ispahan, and Shiraz; those  of Simbamwenni are of stone, pierced with two rows of loopholes for  musketry. The area "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/517"],[0,"The Emerald City of Oz (#17)"],[1,"was covered with regular bars of dark brown, and his hoofs  were delicate as those of a deer.    \"Good evening, friend Zebra,\" said Omby Amby, in reply to the  creature's greeting.  \"Can we do anything for you?\"    \"Yes,\" answered the zebra.  \"I should like you to settle a dispute that  has long been a bother to me, as to whether there is more water or land  in the world.\"    \"Who are you disputing with?\" asked the Wizard.    \"With a soft-shell crab,\" said the zebra.  \"He lives in a pool where I  go to drink every day, and he is a very impertinent crab, I assure you.  I have told him many times that the land is much greater in extent than  the water, but he will not be convinced.  Even this very evening, when  I told him he was an insignificant creature who lived in a small pool,  he asserted that the water was greater and more important than the  land.  So, seeing your camp, I decided to ask you to settle the dispute  for once and all, that I may not be further annoyed by this ignorant  crab.\"    When they had listened to this explanation Dorothy inquired:    \"Where is the soft-shell crab?\"    \"Not far away,\" replied the zebra.  \"If you will agree to judge between  us I will run and get him.\"    \"Run along, then,\" said the little girl.    So the animal pranced into the forest and soon came trotting back to  them.  When he drew near they found a soft-shell crab clinging fast to  the stiff hair of the zebra's head, where it held on by one claw.    \"Now then, Mr. Crab,\" said the zebra, \"here are the people I told you  about; and they know more than you do, who lives in a pool, and more  than I do, who lives in a forest.  For they have been travelers all  over the world, and know every part of it.\"    \"There is more of the world than Oz,\" declared the crab, in a stubborn  voice.    \"That is true,\" said Dorothy; \"but I used to live in Kansas, in the  United States, and I've been to California and to Australia and so has  Uncle Henry.\"    \"For my part,\" added the Shaggy Man, \"I've been to Mexico and Boston  and many other foreign countries.\"    \"And I,\" said the Wizard, \"have been to Europe and Ireland.\"    \"So you see,\" continued the zebra, addressing the crab, \"here are  people of real consequence, who know what they are talking about.\"    \"Then they know there's more water in the world than there is land,\"  asserted the crab, in a shrill, petulant voice.    \"They know you are wrong to make such an absurd statement, and they  will probably think you are a lobster instead of a crab,\" retorted the  animal.    At this taunt the crab reached out its other claw and seized the  zebra's ear, and the creature gave a cry of pain and began prancing up  and down, trying to shake off the crab, which clung fast.    \"Stop pinching!\" cried the zebra.  \"You promised not to pinch if I  would carry you here!\"    \"And you promised to treat me respectfully,\" said the crab, letting go  the ear.    \"Well, haven't I?\" demanded the zebra.    \"No; you called me a lobster,\" said the crab.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" continued the zebra, \"please pardon my poor  friend, because he is ignorant and stupid, and does not understand.  Also the pinch of his claw is very annoying.  So pray tell him that the  world contains more land than water, and when he has heard your  judgment I will carry him back and dump him into his pool, where I hope  he will be more modest in the future.\"    \"But we cannot tell him that,\" said Dorothy, gravely, \"because it would  not be true.\"    \"What!\" exclaimed the zebra, in astonishment; \"do I hear you aright?\"    \"The soft-shell crab is correct,\" declared the Wizard.  \"There is  considerably more water than there is land in the world.\"    \"Impossible!\" protested the zebra.  \"Why, I can run for days upon the  land, and find but little water.\"    \"Did you ever see an ocean?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Never,\" admitted the zebra.  \"There is no such thing as an ocean in  the Land of Oz.\"    \"Well, there are several oceans in the world,\" said Dorothy, \"and  people sail in ships upon these oceans for weeks and weeks, and never  see a bit of land at all.  And the joggerfys will tell you that all the  oceans put together are bigger than all the land put together.\"    At this the crab began laughing in queer chuckles that reminded Dorothy  of the way Billina sometimes cackled.    \"NOW will you give up, Mr. Zebra?\" it cried, jeeringly; \"now will you  give up?\"    The zebra seemed much humbled.    \"Of course I cannot read geographys,\" he said.    \"You could take one of the Wizard's School Pills,\" suggested Billina,  \"and that would make you learned and wise without studying.\"    The crab began laughing again, which so provoked the zebra that he  tried to shake the little creature off.  This resulted in more  ear-pinching, and finally Dorothy told them that if they could not  behave they must go back to the forest.    \"I'm sorry I asked you to decide this question,\" said the zebra,  crossly.  \"So long as neither of us could prove we were right we quite  enjoyed the dispute; but now I can never drink at that pool again  without the soft-shell crab laughing at me.  So I must find another  drinking place.\"    \"Do!  Do, you ignoramus!\" shouted the crab, as loudly as his little  voice would carry.  \"Rile some other pool with your clumsy hoofs, and  let your betters alone after this!\"    Then the zebra trotted back to the forest, bearing the crab with him,  and disappeared amid the gloom of the trees.  And as it was now getting  dark the travelers said good night to one another and went to bed.    Dorothy awoke just as the light was beginning to get strong next  morning, and not caring to sleep any later she quietly got out of bed,  dressed herself, and left the tent where Aunt Em was yet peacefully  slumbering.    Outside she noticed Billina busily pecking around to secure bugs or  other food for breakfast, but none of the men in the other tent seemed  awake.  So the little girl decided to take a walk in the woods and try  to discover some path or road that they might follow when they again  started upon their journey.    She had reached the edge of the forest when the Yellow Hen came  fluttering along and asked where she was going.    \"Just to take a walk, Billina; and maybe I'll find some path,\" said  Dorothy.    \"Then I'll go along,\" decided Billina, and scarcely had she spoken when  Toto ran up and joined them.    Toto and the Yellow Hen had become quite friendly by this time,  although at first they did not get along well together.  Billina had  been rather suspicious of dogs, and Toto had had an idea that it was  every dog's duty to chase a hen on sight.  But Dorothy had talked to  them and scolded them for not being agreeable to one another until they  grew better acquainted and became friends.    I won't say they loved each other dearly, but at least they had stopped  quarreling and now managed to get on together very well.    The day was growing lighter every minute and driving the black shadows  out of the forest; so Dorothy found it very pleasant walking under the  trees.  She went some distance in one direction, but not finding a  path, presently turned in a different direction.  There was no path  here, either, although she advanced quite a way into the forest,  winding here and there among the trees and peering through the bushes  in an endeavor to find some beaten track.    \"I think we'd better go back,\" suggested the Yellow Hen, after a time.  \"The people will all be up by this time and breakfast will be ready.\"    \"Very well,\" agreed Dorothy.  \"Let's see--the camp must be over this  way.\"    She had probably made a mistake about that, for after they had gone far  enough to have reached the camp they still found themselves in the  thick of the woods.  So the little girl stopped short and looked around  her, and Toto glanced up into her face with his bright little eyes and  wagged his tail as if he knew something was wrong.  He couldn't tell  much about direction himself, because he had spent his time prowling  among the bushes and running here and there; nor had Billina paid much  attention to where they were going, being interested in picking bugs  from the moss as they passed along.  The Yellow Hen now turned one eye  up toward the little girl and asked:    \"Have you forgotten where the camp is, Dorothy?\"    \"Yes,\" she admitted; \"have you, Billina?\"    \"I didn't try to remember,\" returned Billina.  \"I'd no idea you would  get lost, Dorothy.\"    \"It's the thing we don't expect, Billina, that usually happens,\"  observed the girl, thoughtfully.  \"But it's no use standing here.  Let's go in that direction,\" pointing a finger at random.  \"It may be  we'll get out of the forest over there.\"    So on they went again, but this way the trees were closer together, and  the vines were so tangled that often they tripped Dorothy up.    Suddenly a voice cried sharply:    \"Halt!\"    At first, Dorothy could see nothing, although she looked around very  carefully.  But Billina exclaimed:    \"Well, I declare!\"    \"What is it?\" asked the little girl: for Toto began barking at  something, and following his gaze she discovered what it was.    A row of spoons had surrounded the three, and these spoons stood  straight up on their handles and carried swords and muskets.  Their  faces were outlined in the polished bowls and they looked very stern  and severe.    Dorothy laughed at the queer things.    \"Who are you?\" she asked.    \"We're the Spoon Brigade,\" said one.    \"In the service of his Majesty King Kleaver,\" said another.    \"And you are our prisoners,\" said a third.    Dorothy sat down on an old stump and looked at them, her eyes twinkling  with amusement.    \"What would happen,\" she inquired, \"if I should set my dog on your  Brigade?\"    \"He would die,\" replied one of the spoons, sharply.  \"One shot from our  deadly muskets would kill him, big as he is.\"    \"Don't risk it, Dorothy,\" advised the Yellow Hen.  \"Remember this is a  fairy"]]]
