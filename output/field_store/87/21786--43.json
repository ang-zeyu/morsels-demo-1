They had endured together the trials of pioneer  life; their close relations continued for many years after, and were  cemented by frequent intermarriage.    Mrs. Lincoln's mother was named Lucy Hanks; her sisters were Betty,  Polly, and Nancy who married Thomas Sparrow, Jesse Friend, and Levi  Hall. The childhood of Nancy was passed with the Sparrows, and she was  oftener called by their name than by her own. The whole family  connection was composed of people so little given to letters that it  is hard to determine the proper names and relationships of the younger  members amid the tangle of traditional cousinships. [Footnote: The  Hanks family seem to have gone from Pennsylvania and thence to  Kentucky about the same time with the Lincolns. They also belonged to  the Communion of Friends.--\"Historical Collections of Gwynnedd,\" by H.  M. Jenkins.] Those who went to Indiana with Thomas Lincoln, and grew  up with his children, are the only ones that need demand our  attention.    There was no hint of future glory in the wedding or the bringing home  of Nancy Lincoln. All accounts represent her as a handsome young woman  of twenty-three, of appearance and intellect superior to her lowly  fortunes. She could read and write,--a remarkable accomplishment in  her circle,--and even taught her husband to form the letters of his  name. He had no such valuable wedding gift to bestow upon her; he  brought her to a little house in Elizabethtown, where he and she and  want dwelt together in fourteen feet square. The next year a daughter  was born to them; and the next the young carpenter, not finding his  work remunerative enough for his growing needs, removed to a little  farm which he had bought on the easy terms then prevalent in Kentucky.  It was on the Big South Fork of Nolin Creek, in what was then Hardin  and is now La Rue County, three miles from Hodgensville. The ground  had nothing attractive about it but its cheapness. It was hardly more  grateful than the rocky hill slopes of New England. It required full  as earnest and intelligent industry to persuade a living out of those  barren hillocks and weedy hollows, covered with stunted and scrubby  underbrush, as it would amid the rocks and sands of the northern  coast.    Thomas Lincoln settled down in this dismal solitude to a deeper  poverty than any of his name had ever known; and there, in the midst  of the most unpromising circumstances that ever witnessed the advent  of a hero into this world, Abraham Lincoln was born on the 12th day of  February, 1809.    Four years later, Thomas Lincoln purchased a fine farm of 238 acres on  Knob Creek, near where it flows into the Rolling Fork, and succeeded  in getting a portion of it into cultivation. The title, however,  remained in him only a little while, and after his property had passed  out of his control he looked about for another place to establish  himself.    [Illustration:   This Certificate, or Marriage List (here shown in  reduced fac-simile), written by the Rev. Jesse Head, was lost sight of  for many years, and about 1886 was discovered through the efforts of  W. F. Booker, Clerk of Washington County, Kentucky.]    Of all these years of Abraham Lincoln's early childhood we know almost  nothing. He lived a solitary life in the woods, returning from his  lonesome little games to his cheerless home. He never talked of these  days to his most intimate friends. [Transcriber's Note: Lengthy  footnote (2) relocated to chapter end.] Once, when asked what he  remembered about the war with Great Britain, he replied: \"Nothing but  this. I had been fishing one day and caught a little fish which I was  taking home. I met a soldier in the road, and, having been always told  at home that we must be good to the soldiers, I gave him my fish.\"  This is only a faint glimpse, but what it shows is rather  pleasant--the generous child and the patriotic household. But there is  no question that these first years of his life had their lasting  effect upon the temperament of this great mirthful and melancholy man.  He had little schooling. He accompanied his sister Sarah [Footnote:  This daughter of Thomas Lincoln is sometimes called Nancy and  sometimes Sarah. She seems to have borne the former name during her  mother's life-time, and to have taken her stepmother's name after Mr.  Lincoln's second marriage.] to the only schools that existed in their  neighborhood, one kept by Zachariah Riney, another by Caleb Hazel,  where he learned his alphabet and a little more. But of all those  advantages for the cultivation of a young mind and spirit which every  home now offers to its children, the books, toys, ingenious games, and  daily devotion of parental love, he knew absolutely nothing.    [Relocated Footnote: Soon after Mr. Lincoln arrived in Washington in  1861, he received the following letter from one of his Virginia  kinsmen, the last communication which ever came from them. It was  written on paper adorned with a portrait of Jefferson Davis, and was  inclosed in an envelope emblazoned with the Confederate flag:    \"To ABRAHAM LINCOLN, Esq., _President of the Northern Confederacy_.    \"SIR: Having just returned from a trip through Virginia, North  Carolina, and Tennessee, permit me to inform you that you will get  whipped out of your boots. To-day I met a gentleman from Anna,  Illinois, and although he voted for you he says that the moment your  troops leave Cairo they will get the spots knocked out of them. My  dear sir, these are facts which time will prove to be correct.    \"I am, sir, with every consideration, yours respectfully,    \"MINOR LINCOLN,    \"Of the Staunton stock of Lincolns.\"    There was a young Abraham Lincoln on the Confederate side in the  Shenandoah distinguished for his courage and ferocity. He lay in wait  and shot a Drunkard preacher, whom he suspected of furnishing  information to the Union army. (Letter from Samuel W. Pennypacker.)]    [Relocated Footnote: In giving to the wife of the pioneer Lincoln the  name of Mary Shipley we follow the tradition in his family. The Hon.  J. L. Nall, of Missouri, grandson of Nancy (Lincoln) Brumfield,  Abraham Lincoln's youngest child, has given us so clear a statement of  the case that we cannot hesitate to accept it, although it conflicts  with equally positive statements from other sources. The late Gideon  Welles, Secretary of the Navy, who gave much intelligent effort to  genealogical researches, was convinced that the Abraham Lincoln who  married Miss Hannah Winters, a daughter of Ann Boone, sister of the  famous Daniel, was the President's grandfather. Waddell's \"Annals of  Augusta County\" says he married Elizabeth Winter, a cousin of Daniel  Boone. The Boone and Lincoln families were large and there were  frequent intermarriages among them, and the patriarchal name of  Abraham was a favorite one. There was still another Lincoln, Hannaniah  by name, who was also intimately associated with the Boones. His  signature appears on the surveyor's certificate for Abraham Lincoln's  land in Jefferson County, and he joined Daniel Boone in 1798 in the  purchase of the tract of land on the Missouri River where Boone died.  (Letter from Richard V. B. Lincoln, printed in the \"Williamsport  [Pa.] Banner,\" Feb. 25, 1881.)]    [Relocated Footnote: In the possession of Colonel Reuben T. Durrett,  of Louisville, a gentleman who has made the early history of his State  a subject of careful study, and to whom we are greatly indebted for  information in regard to the settlement of the Lincolns in Kentucky.  He gives the following list of lands in that State owned by Abraham  Lincoln:    1. Four hundred acres on Long Run, a branch of Floyd's Fork, in  Jefferson County, entered May 29, 1780, and surveyed May 7, 1785. We  have in our possession the original patent issued by Governor Garrard,  of Kentucky, to Abraham Lincoln for this property. It was found by  Col. A. C. Matthews, of the 99th Illinois, in 1863, at an abandoned  residence near Indianola, Texas.    2. Eight hundred acres on Green River, near Green River Lick, entered  June 7, 1780, and surveyed October 12, 1784.    3. Five hundred acres in Campbell County, date of entry not known, but  surveyed September 27, 1798, and patented June 30, 1799--the survey  and patent evidently following his entry after his death. It is  possible that this was the five-hundred-acre tract found in Boone's  field-book, in the possession of Lyman C. Draper, Esq., Secretary of  the Wisconsin Historical Society, and erroneously supposed by some to  have been in Mercer County. Boone was a deputy of Colonel Thomas  Marshall, Surveyor of Fayette County.]    [Relocated Footnote (1): The following is a copy of the marriage bond:    \"Know all men by these presents, that we, Thomas Lincoln and Richard  Berry, are held and firmly bound unto his Excellency, the Governor of  Kentucky, in the just and full sum of fifty pounds current money to the  payment of which well and truly to be made to the said Governor and his  successors, we bind ourselves, our heirs, etc., jointly and severally,  firmly by these presents, sealed with our seals and dated this 10th day  of June, 1806. The condition of the above obligation is such that  whereas there is a marriage shortly intended between the above bound  Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, for which a license has issued, now if  there be no lawful cause to obstruct the said marriage, then this  obligation to be void, else to remain in full force and virtue in law.      \"THOMAS LINCOLN [Seal].    \"RICHARD BERRY [Seal].    \"_Witness_, JOHN H. PARROTT, Guardian.\"    Richard Berry was a connection of Lincoln; his wife was a Shipley.]    [Relocated Footnote (2): There is still living (1886) near Knob Creek  in Kentucky, at the age of eighty, a man who claims to have known  Abraham Lincoln in his childhood--Austin Gollaher. He says he used to  play with Abe Lincoln in the shavings of his father's carpenter shop.  He "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6818"],[0,"The Arctic Prairies : a Canoe-Journey of 2,000 Miles in Search of the Caribou; (#6)"],[1,"to write it  as it was told to me.    His alleged offspring are everywhere in the country, and most  travellers on their return from this region, sound a note of warning:  \"Look out for every one of the name of Beaulieu. They are a queer  lot.\" And now we had committed ourselves and our fortunes into the  hands of Beaulieu's second or twenty-second son--I could not make  sure which. He is a typical half-breed, of medium height, thin,  swarthy, and very active, although he must be far past 60. Just how  far is not known, whether 59 69 or 79, he himself seemed uncertain,  but he knows there is a 9 in it. The women of Smith's Landing say  59, the men say 79 or 89.    He is clad in what might be the cast-off garments of a white tramp,  except for his beaded moccasins. However sordid these people may be  in other parts of their attire, I note that they always have some  redeeming touch of color and beauty about the moccasins which  cover their truly shapely feet. Sousi's rifle, a Winchester, also  was clad in a native mode. An embroidered cover of moose leather  protected it night and day, except when actually in use; of  his weapons he took most scrupulous care. Unlike the founder of  the family, Sousi has no children of his own. But he has reared a  dozen waifs under prompting of his own kind heart. He is quite a  character--does not drink or smoke, and I never heard him swear.  This is not because he does not know how, for he is conversant with  the vigor of all the five languages of the country, and the garment  of his thought is like Joseph's coat--Ethnologically speaking, its  breadth and substance are French, but it bears patches of English,  with flowers and frills, strophes, and classical allusions of Cree  and Chipewyan--the last being the language of his present \"home  circle.\"    There was one more peculiarity of our guide that struck me forcibly.  He was forever considering his horse. Whenever the trail was very  bad, and half of it was, Sousi dismounted and walked--the horse  usually following freely, for the pair were close friends.    This, then, was the dark villain against whom we had been warned.  How he lived up to his reputation will be seen later.    After four hours' march through a level, swampy country, forested  with black and white spruce, black and white poplar, birch, willow,  and tamarack, we came to Salt River, a clear, beautiful stream,  but of weak, salty brine.    Not far away in the woods was a sweet spring, and here we camped  for the night. Close by, on a place recently burnt over, I found  the nest of a Green-winged Teal. All cover was gone and the nest  much singed, but the down had protected the 10 eggs. The old one  fluttered off, played lame, and tried to lead me away. I covered  up the eggs and an hour later found she had returned and resumed  her post.    That night, as I sat by the fire musing, I went over my life when  I was a boy in Manitoba, just too late to see the Buffalo, recalling  how I used to lie in some old Buffalo wallow and peer out over the  prairie through the fringe of spring anemones and long to see the  big brown forms on the plains. Once in those days I got a sensation,  for I did see them. They turned out to be a herd of common cattle,  but still I got the thrill.    Now I was on a real Buffalo hunt, some twenty-five years too late.  Will it come? Am I really to see the Wild Buffalo on its native  plains? It is too good to be true; too much like tipping back the  sands of time.          CHAPTER VII    THE BUFFALO HUNT        We left camp on Salt River at 7.45 in the morning and travelled  till 11 o'clock, covering six miles. It was all through the same  level country, in which willow swamps alternated with poplar and  spruce ridges. At 11 it began to rain, so we camped on a slope under  some fine, big white spruces till it cleared, and then continued  westward. The country now undulated somewhat and was varied with  openings.    Sousi says that when first he saw this region, 30 years ago, it  was all open prairie, with timber only in hollows and about water.  This is borne out by the facts that all the large trees are in such  places, and that all the level open stretches are covered with  sapling growths of aspen and fir. This will make a glorious settlement  some day. In plants, trees, birds, soil, climate, and apparently  all conditions, it is like Manitoba.    We found the skeleton of a cow Buffalo, apparently devoured  by Wolves years ago, because all the big bones were there and the  skull unbroken.    About two in the afternoon we came up a 200-foot rise to a beautiful  upland country, in which the forests were diversified with open  glades, and which everywhere showed a most singular feature. The  ground is pitted all over with funnel-shaped holes, from 6 to 40  feet deep, and of equal width across the rim; none of them contained  water. I saw one 100 feet across and about 50 feet deep; some expose  limestone; in one place we saw granite.    At first I took these for extinct geysers, but later I learned that  the whole plateau called Salt Mountain is pitted over with them.  Brine is running out of the mountain in great quantities, which  means that the upper strata are being undermined as the salt washes  out, and, as these crack, the funnels are formed no doubt by the  loose deposits settling.    In the dry woods Bear tracks became extremely numerous; the whole  country, indeed, was marked with the various signs. Practically  every big tree has bearclaw markings on it, and every few yards  there is evidence that the diet of the bears just now is chiefly  berries of Uva ursi.    As we rode along Sousi prattled cheerfully in his various tongues;  but his steady flow of conversation abruptly ended when, about 2  P. M., we came suddenly on some Buffalo tracks, days old, but still  Buffalo tracks. All at once and completely he was the hunter. He  leaped from his horse and led away like a hound.    Ere long, of course, the trail was crossed by two fresher ones;  then we found some dry wallows and several very fresh tracks. We  tied up the horses in an old funnel pit and set about an elaborate  hunt. Jarvis minded the stock, I set out with Sousi, after he had  tried the wind by tossing up some grass. But he stopped, drew a  finger-nail sharply across my canvas coat, so that it gave a little  shriek, and said \"Va pa,\" which is \"Cela ne va pas\" reduced to its  bony framework. I doffed the offending coat and we went forward as  shown on the map. The horses were left at A; the wind was east. First  we circled a little to eastward, tossing grass at intervals, but,  finding plenty of new sign, went northerly and westward till most  of the new sign was east of us. Sousi then led for C, telling me to  step in his tracks and make no noise. I did so for long, but at  length a stick cracked under my foot; he turned and looked reproachfully  at me. Then a stick cracked under his foot; I gave him a poke in the  ribs. When we got to the land between the lake at D, Sousi pointed  and said, \"They are here.\" We sneaked with the utmost caution that  way--it was impossible to follow any one trail--and in 200 yards Sousi  sank to the ground gasping out, \"La! la! maintenon faites son portrait  au taut que vous voudrez.\" I crawled forward and saw, not one, but  half a dozen Buffalo. \"I must be nearer,\" I said, and, lying flat  on my breast, crawled, toes and elbows, up to a bush within 75  yards, where I made shot No. 1, and saw here that there were 8 or  9 Buffalo, one an immense bull.    Sousi now cocked his rifle-I said emphatically: \"Stop! you must not  fire.\" \"No?\" he said in astonished tones that were full of story  and comment. \"What did we come for?\" Now I saw that by backing  out and crawling to another bunch of herbage I could get within 50  yards.    \"It is not possible,\" he gasped.    \"Watch me and see,\" I replied. Gathering all the near vines  and twisting them around my neck, I covered my head with leaves  and creeping plants, then proceeded to show that it was possible,  while Sousi followed. I reached the cover and found it was a bed  of spring anemones on the far side of an old Buffalo wallow, and  there in that wallow I lay for a moment revelling in the sight. All  at once it came to me: Now, indeed, was fulfilled the long-deferred  dream of my youth, for in shelter of those flowers of my youth, I  was gazing on a herd of wild Buffalo. Then slowly I rose above the  cover and took my second picture.    But the watchful creatures, more shy than Moose here, saw the  rising mass of herbage, or may have caught the wind, rose lightly  and went off. I noticed now, for the first time, a little red calf;  ten Buffalo in all I counted. Sousi, standing up, counted 13. At  the edge of the woods they stopped and looked around, but gave no  third shot for the camera.    I shook Sousi's hand with all my heart, and he, good old fellow,  said: \"Ah! it was for this I prayed last night; without doubt it  was in answer to my prayer that the Good God has sent me this great  happiness.\"    Then back at camp, 200 yards away, the old man's tongue was loosed,  and he told me how the chiefs in conference, and every one at the  Fort, had ridiculed him and his Englishmen--\"who thought they  could walk up to Buffalo and take their pictures.\"    We had not been long in camp when Sousi went off to get some water,  but at once came running back, shouting excitedly, \"My rifle,  my rifle!\" Jarvis handed it to him; he rushed off to the woods. I  followed in time to see him shoot an old Bear and two cubs out of  a tree. She fell, sobbing like a human being, \"Oh! Oh! Oh-h-h-h!\"  It was too late to stop him, and he finished her as she lay helpless.  The little ones were too small to live alone, so shared her fate.    It seems, as Sousi went to the water hole, he came on an old Bear  and her two cubs. She gave a warning \"koff, koff.\" The only enemies  they knew about and feared, were"]]]
