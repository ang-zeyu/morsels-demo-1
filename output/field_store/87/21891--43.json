What are you up to Ned? Same  old story?\"    \"Liberty Bonds--yes. Your father just took some more.\"    \"And so will I, Ned. I can do that, anyhow, even if I don't enlist. Put  me down for another two thousand dollars' worth.\"    \"Say, Tom, that's fine! That will make my share bigger than I counted  on. Shopton will beat the record.\"    \"That's good. We ought to pull strong and hearty for our home town.  How's everything else?\"    \"Oh, so-so. I see Koku and Eradicate trying to outdo one another in  guarding that part of your plant,\" and Ned nodded toward the big new  building.    \"Yes, I had to let Rad play detective. Not that he can do  anything--he's too old. But it keeps him and Koku from quarreling all  the while. I've got to be pretty careful about that shop. It's got a  secret in it that--Well, the less said about it the better.\"    \"You're getting my curiosity aroused, Tom,\" remarked Ned.    \"It'll have to go unsatisfied for a while. Wait a bit and I'll give you  a ride. I've got to go over to Sackett on business, and if you're going  that way I'll take you.\"    \"What in?\"    \"The Hawk.\"    \"That's me!\" cried Ned. \"I haven't been in an aircraft for some time.\"    \"Tell Miles to run her out,\" requested Tom. \"I've got to go in and say  hello to dad a minute, and then I'll be with you.\"    \"Seems like something was in the wind, Tom--big doings?\" hinted Ned.    \"Yes, maybe there is. It all depends on how she turns out.\"    \"You might be speaking of the Hawk or--Mary Nestor!\" said Ned, with a  sidelong look at his chum.    \"As it happens, it's neither one,\" said Tom, and then he hastened away,  to return shortly and guide his fleet little airship, the Hawk, on her  aerial journey.    From then on, at least for some time, neither Tom nor Ned mentioned the  matters they had been discussing--Tom's failure to enlist, his  exemption, and what was being built in the closely guarded shop.    Tom's business in Sackett did not take him long, and then he and Ned  went for a little ride in the air.    \"It's like old times!\" exclaimed Ned, his eyes shining, though Tom  could not see them for two reasons. One was that Ned was sitting behind  him, and the other was that Ned wore heavy goggles, as did the young  pilot. Also, they had to carry on their talk through the speaking tube  arrangement.    \"Yes, it is a bit like old times,\" agreed Tom. \"We've had some great  old experiences together, Ned, haven't we?\"    \"We surely have! I wonder if we'll have any more? When we were in the  submarine, and in your big airship. Say, that big one is the one I  always liked! I like big things.\"    \"Do you?\" asked Tom. \"Well, maybe, when I get--\"    But Tom did not finish, for the Hawk unexpectedly poked her nose into  an empty pocket in the air just then, and needed a firm hand on the  controls. Furthermore, Tom decided against making the confidence that  was on the tip of his tongue.    At last the aircraft was straightened out and the pilot guided her on  toward the army encampment.    \"That's the place I'd like to be,\" called Ned through the tube as the  faint, sweet notes of a bugle floated up from the parade ground.    \"Yes, it would be great,\" admitted Tom. \"But there are other things to  do for Uncle Sam besides wearing khaki.\"    \"Tom's up to some game,\" mused Ned. \"I mustn't judge him too hastily,  or I might make a mistake. And Mary mustn't, either. I'll tell her so.\"    For Mary Nestor had spoken to Ned concerning Tom, and the curiously  secretive air about certain of his activities. And the girl, moreover,  had spoken rather coldly of her friend.  Ned did not like this. It was  not like Mary and Tom to be at odds.    Once more the Hawk came to the ground, this time near the airship sheds  adjoining the Swift works. Just as Tom and Ned alighted, one of the  workmen summoned the young inventor toward the shop, which was so  closely guarded by Koku and Eradicate on the outside.    \"I'll have to leave you, Ned,\" remarked Tom, as he turned away from his  chum. \"There's a conference on about a new invention.\"    \"Oh, that's all right. Business is business, you know.  I've got some  bond calls to make myself. I'll see you later.\"    \"Oh, by the way, Ned!\" exclaimed Tom, turning back for a moment, \"I met  an old friend the other day; or rather an old enemy.\"    \"Hum! When you spoke first, I thought you might mean Professor  Swyington Bumper, that delightful scientist,\" remarked Ned. \"But he  surely was no enemy.\"    \"No; but I meant some one I met about the same time. I met Blakeson,  one of the rival contractors when I helped dig the big tunnel.\"    \"Is that so? Where'd you meet him?\"    \"Right around here. It was certainly a surprise, and at first I  couldn't place him. Then the memory of his face came back to me,\" and  Tom related the incident which had taken place the day he and Mr. Damon  were out in the Hawk.    \"What's he doing around here?\" asked Ned.    \"That's more than I can say,\" Tom answered.    \"Up to no good, I'll wager!\"    \"I agree with you,\" came from Tom. \"But I'm on the watch.\"    \"That's wise, Tom. Well, I'll see you later.\"    During the week which followed this talk Ned was very busy on Liberty  Bond work, and, he made no doubt, his chum was engaged also. This  prevented them from meeting, but finally Ned, one evening, decided to  walk over to the Swift home.    \"I'll pay Tom a bit of a call,\" he mused. \"Maybe he'll feel more like  talking now. Some of the boys are asking why he doesn't enlist, and  maybe if I tell him that he'll make some explanation that will quiet  things down a bit. It's a shame that Tom should be talked about.\"    With this intention in view, Ned kept on toward his chum's house, and  he was about to turn in through a small grove of trees, which would  lead to a path across the fields, when the young bond salesman was  surprised to hear some one running toward him. He could see no one, for  the path wound in and out among the trees, but the noise was plain.    \"Some one in a hurry,\" mused Ned.    A moment later he caught sight of a small lad named Harry Telford  running toward him. The boy had his hat in his hand, and was speeding  through the fast-gathering darkness as though some one were after him.    \"What's the rush?\" asked Ned. \"Playing cops and robbers?\" That was a  game Tom and Ned had enjoyed in their younger days.    \"I--I'm runnin' away!\" panted Harry. \"I--I seen something!\"    \"You saw something?\" repeated Ned. \"What was it--a ghost?\" and he  laughed, thinking the boy would do the same.    \"No, it wasn't no ghost!\" declared Harry, casting a look over his  shoulder. \"It was a wild elephant that I saw, and it's down in a big  yard with a fence around it.\"    \"Where's that?\" asked Ned. \"The circus hasn't come to town this  evening, has it?\"    \"No,\" answered Harry, \"it wasn't no circus. I saw this elephant down in  the big yard back of one of Mr. Swift's factories.\"    \"Oh, down there, was it!\" exclaimed Ned. \"What was it like?\"    \"Well, I was walking along the top of the hill,\" explained Harry, \"and  there's one place where, if you climb a tree, you can look right down  in the big fenced-in yard. I guess I'm about the only one that knows  about it.\"    \"I don't believe Tom does,\" mused Ned, \"or he'd have had that tree cut  down. He doesn't want any spying, I take it.  Well, what'd you see?\" he  asked Harry aloud.    \"Saw an elephant, I tell you!\", insisted the younger boy.  \"I was in  the tree, looking down, for a lot of us kids has tried to peek through  the fence and couldn't I wanted to see what was there.\"    \"And did you?\" asked Ned.    \"I sure did! And it scared me, too,\" admitted Harry. \"All at once, when  I was lookin', I saw the big doors at the back of the shed open, and  the elephant waddled out.\"    \"Are you sure you weren't 'seeing things,' like the little boy in the  story?\" asked Ned.    \"Well, I sure did see something!\" insisted Harry. \"It was a great big  gray thing, bigger'n any elephant I ever saw in any circus. It didn't  seem to have any tail or trunk, or even legs, but it went slow, just  like an elephant does, and it shook the ground, it stepped so hard!\"    \"Nonsense!\" cried Ned.    \"Sure I saw it!\" cried Harry. \"Anyhow,\" he added, after a moment's  thought, \"it was as big as an elephant, though not like any I ever saw.\"    \"What did it do?\" asked Ned.    \"Well, it moved around and then it started for the fence nearest me,  where I was up in the tree. I thought it might have seen me, even  though it was gettin' dark, and it might bust through; so I ran!\"    \"Hum! Well, you surely were seeing things,\" murmured Ned, but, while he  made light of what the boy told him, the young bank clerk was thinking:  \"What is Tom up to now?\"          Chapter VII    Up a Tree      \"Want to come and have a look?\" asked Harry, as Ned paused in the patch  of woods, which were in deeper darkness than the rest of the  countryside, for night was fast falling.    \"Have a look at what?\" asked Ned, who was thinking many thoughts just  then.    \"At the elephant I saw back of the Swift factory. I wouldn't be skeered  if you came along.\"    \"Well, I'm going over to see Tom Swift, anyhow,\" answered Ned, \"so I'll  walk that way. You can come if you like. I don't care about spying on  other people's property--\"    \"I wasn't spyin'!\" exclaimed Harry quickly. \"I just happened to look.  And then I seen something.\"    \"Well, come on,\" suggested Ned. \"If there's anything there, we'll have  a peep at it.\"    His idea was not to try to see what Tom was evidently endeavoring to  conceal, but it was to observe whence Harry had made his observation,  and be in a position to tell Tom to guard against unexpected lookers-on  from that direction.    During the walk back along the course over which Harry had run so  rapidly a little while before, Ned and the boy talked of what the  latter had seen.    \"Do you think it could "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#6)"],[1,"ouldn't ask for it.\"    \"All right,\" returned Ojo, trying not to feel discouraged; \"I'll try to  find it.\"    The Magician looked at the little Munchkin boy in a doubtful way and  said:    \"All this will mean a long journey for you; perhaps several long  journeys; for you must search through several of the different  countries of Oz in order to get the things I need.\"    \"I know it, sir; but I must do my best to save Unc Nunkie.\"    \"And also my poor wife Margolotte. If you save one you will save the  other, for both stand there together and the same compound will restore  them both to life. Do the best you can, Ojo, and while you are gone I  shall begin the six years job of making a new batch of the Powder of  Life. Then, if you should unluckily fail to secure any one of the  things needed, I will have lost no time. But if you succeed you must  return here as quickly as you can, and that will save me much tiresome  stirring of four kettles with both feet and both hands.\"    \"I will start on my journey at once, sir,\" said the boy.    \"And I will go with you,\" declared the Patchwork Girl.    \"No, no!\" exclaimed the Magician. \"You have no right to leave this  house. You are only a servant and have not been discharged.\"    Scraps, who had been dancing up and down the room, stopped and looked  at him.    \"What is a servant?\" she asked.    \"One who serves. A--a sort of slave,\" he explained.    \"Very well,\" said the Patchwork Girl, \"I'm going to serve you and your  wife by helping Ojo find the things you need. You need a lot, you know,  such as are not easily found.\"    \"It is true,\" sighed Dr. Pipt. \"I am well aware that Ojo has undertaken  a serious task.\"    Scraps laughed, and resuming her dance she said:        \"Here's a job for a boy of brains:      A drop of oil from a live man's veins;      A six-leaved clover; three nice hairs      From a Woozy's tail, the book declares      Are needed for the magic spell,      And water from a pitch-dark well.      The yellow wing of a butterfly      To find must Ojo also try,      And if he gets them without harm,      Doc Pipt will make the magic charm;      But if he doesn't get 'em, Unc      Will always stand a marble chunk.\"      The Magician looked at her thoughtfully.    \"Poor Margolotte must have given you some of the quality of poesy, by  mistake,\" he said. \"And, if that is true, I didn't make a very good  article when I prepared it, or else you got an overdose or an  underdose. However, I believe I shall let you go with Ojo, for my poor  wife will not need your services until she is restored to life. Also I  think you may be able to help the boy, for your head seems to contain  some thoughts I did not expect to find in it. But be very careful of  yourself, for you're a souvenir of my dear Margolotte. Try not to get  ripped, or your stuffing may fall out. One of your eyes seems loose,  and you may have to sew it on tighter. If you talk too much you'll wear  out your scarlet plush tongue, which ought to have been hemmed on the  edges. And remember you belong to me and must return here as soon as  your mission is accomplished.\"    \"I'm going with Scraps and Ojo,\" announced the Glass Cat.    \"You can't,\" said the Magician.    \"Why not?\"    \"You'd get broken in no time, and you couldn't be a bit of use to the  boy and the Patchwork Girl.\"    \"I beg to differ with you,\" returned the cat, in a haughty tone. \"Three  heads are better than two, and my pink brains are beautiful. You can  see 'em work.\"    \"Well, go along,\" said the Magician, irritably. \"You're only an  annoyance, anyhow, and I'm glad to get rid of you.\"    \"Thank you for nothing, then,\" answered the cat, stiffly.    Dr. Pipt took a small basket from a cupboard and packed several things  in it. Then he handed it to Ojo.    \"Here is some food and a bundle of charms,\" he said. \"It is all I can  give you, but I am sure you will find friends on your journey who will  assist you in your search. Take care of the Patchwork Girl and bring  her safely back, for she ought to prove useful to my wife. As for the  Glass Cat--properly named Bungle--if she bothers you I now give you my  permission to break her in two, for she is not respectful and does not  obey me. I made a mistake in giving her the pink brains, you see.\"    Then Ojo went to Unc Nunkie and kissed the old man's marble face very  tenderly.    \"I'm going to try to save you, Unc,\" he said, just as if the marble  image could hear him; and then he shook the crooked hand of the Crooked  Magician, who was already busy hanging the four kettles in the  fireplace, and picking up his basket left the house.    The Patchwork Girl followed him, and after them came the Glass Cat.          Chapter Six    The Journey      Ojo had never traveled before and so he only knew that the path down  the mountainside led into the open Munchkin Country, where large  numbers of people dwelt. Scraps was quite new and not supposed to know  anything of the Land of Oz, while the Glass Cat admitted she had never  wandered very far away from the Magician's house. There was only one  path before them, at the beginning, so they could not miss their way,  and for a time they walked through the thick forest in silent thought,  each one impressed with the importance of the adventure they had  undertaken.    Suddenly the Patchwork Girl laughed. It was funny to see her laugh,  because her cheeks wrinkled up, her nose tipped, her silver button eyes  twinkled and her mouth curled at the corners in a comical way.    \"Has something pleased you?\" asked Ojo, who was feeling solemn and  joyless through thinking upon his uncle's sad fate.    \"Yes,\" she answered. \"Your world pleases me, for it's a queer world,  and life in it is queerer still. Here am I, made from an old bedquilt  and intended to be a slave to Margolotte, rendered free as air by an  accident that none of you could foresee. I am enjoying life and seeing  the world, while the woman who made me is standing helpless as a block  of wood. If that isn't funny enough to laugh at, I don't know what is.\"    \"You're not seeing much of the world yet, my poor, innocent Scraps,\"  remarked the Cat. \"The world doesn't consist wholly of the trees that  are on all sides of us.\"    \"But they're part of it; and aren't they pretty trees?\" returned  Scraps, bobbing her head until her brown yarn curls fluttered in the  breeze. \"Growing between them I can see lovely ferns and wild-flowers,  and soft green mosses. If the rest of your world is half as beautiful I  shall be glad I'm alive.\"    \"I don't know what the rest of the world is like, I'm sure,\" said the  cat; \"but I mean to find out.\"    \"I have never been out of the forest,\" Ojo added; \"but to me the trees  are gloomy and sad and the wild-flowers seem lonesome. It must be nicer  where there are no trees and there is room for lots of people to live  together.\"    \"I wonder if any of the people we shall meet will be as splendid as I  am,\" said the Patchwork Girl. \"All I have seen, so far, have pale,  colorless skins and clothes as blue as the country they live in, while  I am of many gorgeous colors--face and body and clothes. That is why I  am bright and contented, Ojo, while you are blue and sad.\"    \"I think I made a mistake in giving you so many sorts of brains,\"  observed the boy. \"Perhaps, as the Magician said, you have an overdose,  and they may not agree with you.\"    \"What had you to do with my brains?\" asked Scraps.    \"A lot,\" replied Ojo. \"Old Margolotte meant to give you only a  few--just enough to keep you going--but when she wasn't looking I added  a good many more, of the best kinds I could find in the Magician's  cupboard.\"    \"Thanks,\" said the girl, dancing along the path ahead of Ojo and then  dancing back to his side. \"If a few brains are good, many brains must  be better.\"    \"But they ought to be evenly balanced,\" said the boy, \"and I had no  time to be careful. From the way you're acting, I guess the dose was  badly mixed.\"    \"Scraps hasn't enough brains to hurt her, so don't worry,\" remarked the  cat, which was trotting along in a very dainty and graceful manner.  \"The only brains worth considering are mine, which are pink. You can  see 'em work.\"    After walking a long time they came to a little brook that trickled  across the path, and here Ojo sat down to rest and eat something from  his basket. He found that the Magician had given him part of a loaf of  bread and a slice of cheese. He broke off some of the bread and was  surprised to find the loaf just as large as it was before. It was the  same way with the cheese: however much he broke off from the slice, it  remained exactly the same size.    \"Ah,\" said he, nodding wisely; \"that's magic. Dr. Pipt has enchanted  the bread and the cheese, so it will last me all through my journey,  however much I eat.\"    \"Why do you put those things into your mouth?\" asked Scraps, gazing at  him in astonishment. \"Do you need more stuffing? Then why don't you use  cotton, such as I am stuffed with?\"    \"I don't need that kind,\" said Ojo.    \"But a mouth is to talk with, isn't it?\"    \"It is also to eat with,\" replied the boy. \"If I didn't put food into  my mouth, and eat it, I would get hungry and starve.    \"Ah, I didn't know that,\" she said. \"Give me some.\"    Ojo handed her a bit of the bread and she put it in her mouth.    \"What next?\" she asked, scarcely able to speak.    \"Chew it and swallow it,\" said the boy.    Scraps tried that. Her pearl teeth were unable to chew the bread and  beyond her mouth there was no opening. Being unable to swallow she  threw away the bread and laughed.    \"I must get hungry and starve, for I can't eat,\" she said.    \"Neither can I,\" announced the cat; \"but I'm not fool enough to try.  Can't you understand that you and I are superior people and not made  like these poor humans?\"    \"Why should I understand that, or anything else?\" asked the girl.  \"Don't bother my head by asking conundrums, I beg of you."]]]
