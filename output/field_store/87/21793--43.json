As a rule, the  constant strain of being on the _qui vive_, playing a lone hand  against the most powerful influences often unknown, having one's plans  upset at the last moment and continually pitting one's own brain  against some of the acutest and shrewdest minds of the world, the  knowledge that the slightest blunder means loss of liberty, often of  life, is wearing, to say the least.    I have known men and women, courageous to a degree, who have broken  dowm under the strain; sooner or later one is bound to succumb.  I  have known of a dozen men and women who have mysteriously disappeared,  \"dropped out of sight,\" caught or killed--_not always by their  opponents_.    To cite but two cases, one of a woman, the other of a man.    Olga Bruder was a spy.  She worked for Germany and for the Service  Bureau in Brussels.  A few years ago it was announced in the European  newspapers that a woman known as Olga Bruder had committed suicide in  a hotel at Memel on the Russian border.  Fraulein Bruder had been sent  after the plans of a Russian fort.  In Berlin they learned that she  had obtained them, but becoming involved in a love affair with a  Russian officer was holding them out, planning to restore them to him.  Also, contrary to the service regulations, she knew four foreign  agents well.  Later reports from Danzig revealed the fact that she had  become enamored with a sectional chief of the Russian Service and that  she was about to give up everything to him.  So Olga Bruder committed  suicide.  _She was poisoned_.    As for Lieutenant von Zastrov, an ex-army officer in the German Secret  Service, he was killed in a duel.  Zastrov was suspected of flirting  with Russian agents--only suspected.  He knew too much to be  imprisoned.  He was a civilian and under the German law entitled to a  public hearing.  Had he still been a military man, a secret tribunal  would have been possible, but being the scion of an old aristocratic  house and knowing official secrets, it was not wise to put him in  against the regular machinery of elimination.  So Zastrov was  challenged to a duel.  He killed the first man the Service chiefs sent  against him, yet no sooner was that duel over than he was challenged  again.  In half an hour Zastrov was dead.    Yes, your own employers often think it advisable at times to eliminate  a too clever or knowing member of their service, unless that same  member has procured for himself a solid good \"life insurance\" in the  nature of documentary evidence of such character that to meddle with  him brings danger of disclosure.  Of late there have been no attempts  on my life.      Chapter III. Into the East      Reclining in my deck chair on the N. D. L. liner _Bayern_, bound for  Singapore, I was smoking a pipe and idly speculating.  I had  cultivated the acquaintance of my table neighbor, a Japanese, Baron  Huraki, and was at the moment, expecting him to come up the  companionway and take his place in his deck chair beside me.  Instead  came two officers of the Second Siberian Rifles, strolling along the  deck.  It was obvious that, although it still lacked three hours of  noon, these gentlemen had been quite frequently to the shrine of  Bacchus.  I had no fault to find with that, as long as they did not  interfere with my own personal comfort.  When they began tacking  along, talking at the top of their voices on that part of the deck  known by experienced travelers to be reserved for repose and reading,  however, they began to irritate me.  When one of them threw himself  into the Baron's chair and displayed that beastly annoying habit of  continually wriggling and creaking the chair, meanwhile shouting to  his companion at the top of his lungs, I lost all patience.  It only  needed Baron Huraki's appearance and quiet request for the evacuation  of his deck chair, and the insolent stare and non-compliance of the  Russian, to make me chip in with:    \"Damn it, sir!  You don't own the whole world yet.\"    I went on in terse military German which eighty per cent. of all  Russian officers know and the trend of which is never misunderstood.  I pointed out that any further encroaching would be resented in a most  drastic and sudden manner.  The usual farcical exchange of cards,  permitting all sorts of bluffs, does not impress a Russian, but the  imminent chance of blows from fists does.  A pair of astonished  bulging eyes, a muttered apology and quietness reigned.    With a mild smile Baron Huraki dropped into his chair, but I did not  like the expression in his eyes.  Knowing the prowess of the Baron as  an exponent of his national system of self-defense (I had seen him  harmlessly toss about the biggest sailor on the _Bayern_, the chief  butcher, who was as strong as an ox), I said:    \"It's a wonder to me, Baron, that you didn't throw that boor half way  across the deck.\"    I shall never forget his answer.    \"We of the Samurai never fight when there is nothing behind it.  It is  not the time.\"    I did not like the expression in his eyes.    All this transpired because I was on the road to Singapore, away from  Berlin, on my first important mission in the German Secret Service.  The Intelligence Department had instructed me to ascertain the extent  of the new docks and fortifications in course of completion in the  Straits Settlements--an assignment calling for exact topographical  data, photographs and plans.    Leaving port, I had found the _Bayern_ comfortably crowded.  In the  East war clouds were gathering and among the passengers were a number  of Japanese called home, as I afterwards learned, for the impending  struggle.  At Port Said we had taken on a Russian contingent, quite a  few of whom were officers bound for Port Arthur, Dalny and  Vladivostock, and in view of the gathering conflict I found the  relative conduct and bearing of representatives of these races that  were soon to clash, vastly interesting.    And after my experience with the Russians, I was to know more.  From  that time on, I began to notice a subtle change in Baron Huraki's  attitude toward me.  Quite of his own accord he discussed with me the  customs, ideals and aspirations of his caste and country.  Wrapped in  a Shuai kimono, his gift to me, we spent many hot and otherwise  tedious nights, sprawled in our deck chairs, discussing unreservedly  the questions of the East.  What I learned then and the insight I got  into the aims and character of Nippon, were invaluable to me.  Baron  Huraki, now high in the services of the Mikado, is my friend still.  Once a year he sends me _Shuraino-Ariki_, a wonderful spray of cherry  blossoms, the Japanese symbol of rejuvenating friendship.    A Secret Service agent, although making no friends or acquaintances,  always makes it his business to converse with and study his fellow  travelers.  Following my usual habit, I went out of my way to  cultivate the acquaintance of the Japanese, particularly Huraki.  A  scholar of no mean attainments was the Baron.    Quietly, without being didactic, he upheld his end in most discussions  on applied sciences or philosophic arguments, putting forth his deep  knowledge in an unobtrusive way.  I found this trait to be an  invariable rule with most of the Japanese with whom I came in contact.  Once or twice during our lengthy and pleasant chats I tried to veer  the subject round to the all-engrossing Eastern question, only to be  met with the maddening bland smile of the East.  I was rather  inexperienced in the fathomless, undefinable ways of the Orient, but  on the _Bayern_ I learned rapidly the truths that Western methods and  strategy are absolutely useless against the impenetrable stoicism of  an Asiatic and that only personal regard and obligation on their part  will produce results.  In striking contrast to the Japanese, small and  sinewy, any two of them weighing no more than one Russian, quiet,  taciturn, genial and abstemious, were the children of the \"Little  White Father.\"  The Russians were an aggressive, big, well set up,  heavy type of men, by no means teetotalers, talkative, with  overbearing swagger, always posing, talking contemptuously about the  possible struggle in the East, invariably referring to the Japanese as  \"little monkey men.\"  Fortunate for me was it that the _Bayern_ was  carrying both Russians and Japanese; the knowledge I acquired from  Baron Huraki of the Asiatics was invaluable in Singapore; what I  learned of Russians, I needed at Port Arthur.  But I am anticipating  my narrative.    Arriving in Singapore, I put up at the Hotel de la Paix on the Marine  Parade.  I posed as an ordinary tourist with a leaning toward hunting  and a fad of doing research work in tropical botany.  I gradually  became acquainted with a number of English officers and was introduced  at their clubs.  The information obtained through these channels about  the new naval base was merely theoretical and I soon found that to  obtain practical results I would have to get in touch with the native  clerks.  In the English Eastern possessions, you see, most clerical  and minor mechanical positions are held by natives.  It soon was  brought home to me, though, that this cultivating natives was by no  means easy and a rather dangerous thing to do.  To be in any way  successful, I had to find a native of a higher caste, one with  sufficient influence to command the clerks.  If I could get hold of  one of the numerable discontented petty rajahs, for instance, there  might be a chance of obtaining what I sought.    In one of the clubs, I found a clue.  A young Rajah, one of the  numerous coterie of petty princes--fair play compels me to withhold  his name--had got himself into some trouble and the paternal  government had promptly suspended his income.  Here was my chance.  I  soon ascertained young Rajah's haunts and made it my business to  frequent them.  One day I found him on the veranda of the Marine "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6952"],[0,"By Pike and Dyke: a Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic (#6)"],[1," in the Netherlands at once and  forever, as he believed, at an end, but he saw in this destruction  of the Protestants of France a great step in the direction he had  so much at heart--the entire extirpation of heretics throughout  Europe. He wrote letters of the warmest congratulation to the King  of France, with whom he had formerly been at enmity; while the  Pope, accompanied by his cardinals, went to the church of St. Mark  to render thanks to God for the grace thus singularly vouchsafed  to the Holy See and to all Christendom. To the Prince of Orange  the news came as a thunderclap. His troops wholly lost heart, and  refused to keep the field. The prince himself almost lost his life  at the hands of the mutineers, and at last, crossing the Rhine, he  disbanded his army and went almost alone to Holland to share the  fate of the provinces that adhered to him. He went there expecting  and prepared to die.    \"There I will make my sepulcher,\" was his expression in the letter  in which he announced his intention to his brother. Count Louis  of Nassau had now nothing left before him but to surrender. His  soldiers, almost entirely French, refused any longer to resist,  now that the king had changed his intentions, and the city was  surrendered, the garrison being allowed to retire with their weapons.    The terms of the capitulation were so far respected; but instead  of the terms respecting the townspeople being adhered to, a council  of blood was set up, and for many months from ten to twenty of the  inhabitants were hanged, burned, or beheaded every day. The news  of the massacre of St. Bartholomew, of the treachery of the King  of France towards the inhabitants of the Netherlands, and of the  horrible cruelties perpetrated upon the inhabitants of Mechlin and  other towns that had opened their gates to the Prince of Orange,  excited the most intense indignation among the people of England.    The queen put on mourning, but was no more inclined than before  to render any really efficient aid to the Netherlands. She allowed  volunteers to pass over, furnished some meagre sums of money, but  held aloof from any open participation in the war; for if before,  when France was supposed to be favourable to the Netherlands and  hostile to Spain, she felt unequal to a war with the latter power,  still less could she hope to cope with Spain when the deed of St.  Bartholomew had reunited the two Catholic monarchs.    Captain Martin, married to a native of the Netherlands, and mixing  constantly with the people in his trade, was naturally ardent, even  beyond the majority of his countrymen, in their cause, and over  and over again declared that were he sailing by when a sea fight  was going on between the Dutch and the Spaniards, he would pull  down his English flag, hoist that of Holland, and join in the fray;  and Ned, as was to be expected, shared to the utmost his father's  feelings on the subject. Early in September the Good Venture started  with a cargo for Amsterdam, a city that almost alone in Holland  adhered to the Spanish cause.    Sophie Martin was pleased when she heard that this was the ship's  destination; for she was very anxious as to the safety of her  father and brothers, from whom she had not heard for a long time.  Postage was dear and mails irregular. Few letters were written or  received by people in England, still more seldom letters sent across  the sea. There would, therefore, under the ordinary circumstances,  have been no cause whatever for uneasiness had years elapsed without  news coming from Amsterdam; and, indeed, during her whole married  life Sophie Martin had only received one or two letters by post from  her former home, although many communications had been brought by  friends of her husband's trading there. But as many weeks seldom  passed without the Good Venture herself going into Amsterdam, for  that town was one of the great trading centres of Holland, there  was small occasion for letters to pass. It happened, however, that  from one cause or another, eighteen months had passed since Captain  Martin's business had taken him to that port, and no letter had  come either by post or hand during that time.    None who had friends in the Netherlands could feel assured that  these must, either from their station or qualities, be safe from  the storm that was sweeping over the country. The poor equally  with the rich, the artisan equally with the noble, was liable to  become a victim of Alva's Council of Blood. The net was drawn so  as to catch all classes and conditions; and although it was upon  the Protestants that his fury chiefly fell, the Catholics suffered  too, for pretexts were always at hand upon which these could also  be condemned.    The Netherlands swarmed with spies and informers, and a single  unguarded expression of opinion was sufficient to send a man to  the block. And, indeed, in a vast number of cases, private animosity  was the cause of the denunciation; for any accusation could be  safely made where there was no trial, and the victims were often  in complete ignorance as to the nature of the supposed crime for  which they were seized and dragged away to execution.    When the vessel sailed Sophie Martin gave her husband a letter  to her father and brothers, begging them to follow the example of  thousands of their countrymen, and to leave the land where life and  property were no longer safe, and to come over to London. They would  have no difficulty in procuring work there, and could establish  themselves in business and do as well as they had been doing at  home.    They had, she knew, money laid by in London; for after the troubles  began her father had sold off the houses and other property he had  purchased with his savings, and had transmitted the result to England  by her husband, who had intrusted it for investment to a leading  citizen with whom he did business. As this represented not only  her father's accumulations but those of her brothers who worked  as partners with him, it amounted to a sum that in those days was  regarded as considerable.    \"I feel anxious, Ned,\" Captain Martin said as he sailed up the Zuider  Zee towards the city, \"as to what has befallen your grandfather and  uncles. I have always made the best of the matter to your mother,  but I cannot conceal from myself that harm may have befallen them.  It is strange that no message has come to us through any of our  friends trading with the town, for your uncles know many of my  comrades and can see their names in the shipping lists when they  arrive. They would have known how anxious your mother would be  at the news of the devil's work that is going on here, and, being  always tender and thoughtful for her, would surely have sent her  news of them from time to time as they had a chance. I sorely fear  that something must have happened. Your uncles are prudent men,  going about their work and interfering with none; but they are men,  too, who speak their mind, and would not, like many, make a false  show of affection when they feel none.    \"Well, well; we shall soon know. As soon as the ship is moored and  my papers are declared in order, you and I will go over to Vordwyk  and see how they are faring. I think not that they will follow  your mother's advice and sail over with us; for it was but the last  time I saw them that they spoke bitterly against the emigrants,  and said that every man who could bear arms should, however great  his danger, wait and bide the time until there was a chance to strike  for his religion and country. They are sturdy men these Dutchmen,  and not readily turned from an opinion they have taken up; and  although I shall do my best to back up your mother's letter by my  arguments, I have but small hope that I shall prevail with them.\"    In the evening they were moored alongside the quays of Amsterdam,  at that time one of the busiest cities in Europe. Its trade was  great, the wealth of its citizens immense. It contained a large number  of monasteries, its authorities were all Catholics and devoted to  the cause of Spain, and although there were a great many well wishers  to the cause of freedom within its walls, these were powerless to  take action, and the movement which, after the capture of Brill  and Flushing, had caused almost all the towns of Holland to declare  for the Prince of Orange, found no echo in Amsterdam. The vessel  anchored outside the port, and the next morning after their papers  were examined and found in order she ranged up alongside the crowded  tiers of shipping. Captain Martin went on shore with Ned, visited  the merchants to whom his cargo was consigned, and told them that  he should begin to unload the next day.    He then started with Ned to walk to Vordwyk, which lay two miles  away. On reaching the village they stopped suddenly. The roof of  the house they had so often visited was gone, its walls blackened  by fire. After the first exclamation of surprise and regret they  walked forward until opposite the ruin, and stood gazing at it.  Then Captain Martin stepped up to a villager, who was standing at  the door of his shop, and asked him when did this happen, what had  become of the old man Plomaert?    \"You are his son-in-law, are you not?\" the man asked in reply. \"I  have seen you here at various times.\" Captain Martin nodded. The  man looked round cautiously to see that none were within sound of  his voice.    \"You have not heard, then?\" he said. \"It was a terrible business,  though we are growing used to it now. One day, it is some eight  months since, a party of soldiers came from Amsterdam and hauled  away my neighbour Plomaert and his three sons. They were denounced  as having attended the field preaching a year ago, and you know  what that means.\"    \"And the villains murdered them?\" Captain Martin asked in horror  stricken tones.    The man nodded. \"They were hung together next day, together with  Gertrude, the wife"]]]
