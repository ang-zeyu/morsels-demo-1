If Melendez himself had come to me with flushed face and laughing eyes,  and sat down on the grass at my side to recite one of his most  enchanting poems, I should, with finger on lip, have enjoined silence;  for in the mood I was then in at that sequestered spot, with the  landscape outside my shady green pavilion bathed and quivering in the  brilliant sunshine, this small bird had suddenly become to me more than  any other singer, feathered or human. And yet the tree-pipit is not very  highly regarded among British melodists, on account of the little  variety there is in its song. Nevertheless, it is most sweet--perhaps the  sweetest of all. It is true that there are thousands, nay, millions of  things--sights and sounds and perfumes--which are or may be described as  sweet, so common is the metaphor, and this too common use has perhaps  somewhat degraded it; but in this case there is no other word so well  suited to describe the sensation produced.    The tree-pipit has a comparatively short song, repeated, with some  variation in the number and length of the notes, at brief intervals. The  opening notes are thick and throaty, and similar in character to the  throat-notes of many other species in this group, a softer sound than  the throat-notes of the skylark and woodlark, which they somewhat  resemble. The canary-like trills and thin piping notes, long drawn out,  which follow vary greatly in different individuals, and in many cases  the trills are omitted. But the concluding notes of the song I am  considering--which is only one note repeated again and again--are clear  and beautifully inflected, and have that quality of sweetness, of  lusciousness, I have mentioned. The note is uttered with a downward  fall, more slowly and expressively at each repetition, as if the singer  felt overcome at the sweetness of life and of his own expression, and  languished somewhat at the close; its effect is like that of the perfume  of the honeysuckle, infecting the mind with a soft, delicious languor, a  wish to lie perfectly still and drink of the same sweetness again and  again in larger measure.    To some who are familiar with this by no means uncommon little bird, it  may seem that I am overstating the charm of its melody. I can only say  that the mood I was then in made me very keenly appreciative; also that  I have never heard any other individual of this species able to produce  precisely the same effect. We know that there are quite remarkable  differences in the songs of birds of the same species, that among  several that appear to be perfect and to sing alike one will possess a  charm above the other. The truth is they are not alike; they affect us  differently, but the sense is not fine enough or not sufficiently  trained to detect the cause. The poet's words may be used of this  natural melody as well as of the works of art:      \"O the little more and how much it is!\"    There were about the village, within a few minutes' walk of the cottage,  not fewer than half-a-dozen tree-pipits, each inhabiting a favourite  spot where I could always count on finding and hearing him at almost any  hour of the day from sunrise to sunset. Yet I cared not for these. To  the one chosen bird I returned daily to spend the hot hours, lying in  the shade and listening to his strain. Finally, I allowed two or three  days to slip by, and when I revisited the old spot the secret charm had  vanished. The bird was there, and rose and fell as formerly, pouring out  his melody; but it was not the same: something was missing from those  last sweet, languishing notes. Perhaps in the interval there had been  some disturbing accident in his little wild life, though I could hardly  believe it, since his mate was still sitting about thirty yards from the  tree on the five little mottled eggs in her nest. Or perhaps his  midsummer's music had reached its highest point, and was now in its  declension. And perhaps the fault was in me. The virtue that draws and  holds us does not hold us always, nor very long; it departs from all  things, and we wonder why. The loss is in ourselves, although we do not  know it. Nature, the chosen mistress of our heart, does not change  towards us, yet she is now, even to-day--      \"Less full of purple colour and hid spice,\"    and smiles and sparkles in vain to allure us, and when she touches us  with her warm, caressing touch, there is, compared with yesterday, only  a faint response.          V      Coming back from the waterside through the wood, after the hottest hours  of the day were over, the crooning of the turtle-doves would be heard  again on every side--that summer beech-wood lullaby that seemed never to  end. The other bird voices were of the willow-wren, the wood-wren, the  coal-tit, and the now somewhat tiresome chiffchaff; from the distance  would come the prolonged rich strain of the blackbird, and occasionally  the lyric of the chaffinch. The song of this bird gains greatly when  heard from a tall tree in the woodland silence; it has then a resonance  and wildness which it appears to lack in the garden and orchard. In the  village I had been glad to find that the chaffinch was not too common,  that in the tangle of minstrelsy one could enjoy there his vigorous  voice was not predominant.    Of all these woodland songsters the wood-wren impressed me the most. He  could always be heard, no matter where I entered the wood, since all  this world of tall beeches was a favoured haunt of the wood-wren, each  pair keeping to its own territory of half-an-acre of trees or so, and  somewhere among those trees the male was always singing, far up,  invisible to eyes beneath, in the topmost sunlit foliage of the tall  trees. On entering the wood I would, stand still for a few minutes to  listen to the various sounds until that one fascinating sound would come  to my ears from some distance away, and to that spot I would go to find  a bed of last year's leaves to sit upon and listen. It was an enchanting  experience to be there in that woodland twilight with the green cloud of  leaves so far above me; to listen to the silence, to the faint whisper  of the wind-touched leaves, then to little prelusive drops of musical  sound, growing louder and falling faster until they ran into one  prolonged trill. And there I would sit listening for half-an-hour or a  whole hour; but the end would not come; the bird is indefatigable and  with his mysterious talk in the leaves would tire the sun himself and send  him down the sky: for not until the sun has set and the wood has grown  dark does the singing cease.    On emerging from the deep shade of the beeches into the wide grassy road  that separated the wood from the orchards and plantations of fruit  trees, and pausing for a minute to look down on the more than  half-hidden village, invariably the first loud sounds that reached my  ear were those of the cuckoo, thrush, and blackbird. At all hours in the  village, from early morning to evening twilight, these three voices  sounded far and near above the others. I considered myself fortunate  that no large tree near the cottage had been made choice of by a  song-thrush as a singing-stand during the early hours. The nearest tree  so favoured was on the further side of a field, so that when I woke at  half-past three or four o'clock, the shrill indefatigable voice came in  at the open window, softened by distance and washed by the dewy  atmosphere to greater purity. Throstle and skylark to be admired must be  heard at a distance. But at that early hour when I sat by the open  window, the cuckoo's call was the commonest sound; the birds were  everywhere, bird answering bird far and near, so persistently repeating  their double note that this sound, which is in character unlike any  other sound in nature, which one so listens and longs to hear in spring,  lost its old mystery and charm, and became of no more account than the  cackle of the poultry-yard. It was the cuckoo's village; sometimes three  or four birds in hot pursuit of each other would dash through the trees  that lined the further side of the lane and alight on that small tree at  the gate which the nightingale was accustomed to visit later in the day.    Other birds that kept themselves very much out of sight during most of  the time also came to the same small tree at that early hour. It was  regularly visited, and its thin bole industriously examined, by the  nuthatch and the quaint little mouse-like creeper. Doubtless they  imagined that five o'clock was too early for heavy human creatures to be  awake, and were either ignorant of my presence or thought proper to  ignore it.    But where, during the days when the vociferous cuckoo, with hoarse  chuckle and dissyllabic call and wild bubbling cry was so much with  us--where, in this period of many pleasant noises was the cuckoo's mate,  or maid, or messenger, the quaint and beautiful wryneck? There are few  British birds, perhaps not one--not even the crafty black and white  magpie, or mysterious moth-like goatsucker, or tropical kingfisher--more  interesting to watch. At twilight I had lingered at the woodside, also  in other likely places, and the goatsucker had failed to appear, gliding  and zig-zagging hither and thither on his dusky-mottled noiseless wings,  and now this still heavier disappointment was mine. I could not find the  wryneck.

Remarks      Of the tale of the peasant and the workman three copies, more or less  imperfect, remain to us. At Berlin are two papyri, Nos. 2 and 4,  containing parts of the tale, published in facsimile in the \"Denkmaler\"  of Lepsius vi. 108-110 and 113; while portions of another copy exist in  the Butler papyrus; and lately fragments of the same have been collated  in the collection of Lord Amherst of Hackney. These last have been  published in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,  xiv. 558. The number of copies seem to show that this was a popular tale  in early times; it certainly is of a more advanced type than the earlier  tales of magic, though it belongs to a simpler style than the tales  which follow. It has been translated partially by Chabas and Goodwin,  and also by Maspero, but most completely by Griffith in the Proceedings  of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, referred to above.    The beginning of the tale is lost in all the copies, and an introductory  sentence is here added in brackets, to explain the position of affairs  at the opening of the fragment. The essence of the tale is the  difference in social position between the Sekhti, or peasant, and the  Hemti, or workman--the _fellah_ and the client of the noble; and the  impossibility of getting justice against a client, unless by some  extraordinary means of attracting his patron's attention, is the basis  of the action. There is not a single point of incident here which might  not be true in modern times; every turn of it seems to live, as one  reads it in view of country life in Egypt.    The region of the tale is Henenseten, or Herakleopolis, now Ahnas, a  little south of the Fayum. This was the seat of the IXth and Xth  Dynasties, apparently ejected from Memphis by a foreign invasion of the  Delta; and here it is that the High Steward lives and goes to speak to  the king. The district of the Sekhti is indicated by his travelling  south to Henenseten, and going with asses and not by boat. Hence we are  led to look for the Sekhet Hemat, or salt country, in the borders of the  Fayum lake, whence the journey would be southward, and across the  desert. This lake was not regulated artificially until the XIIth  Dynasty; and hence at the period of this tale it was a large sheet of  water, fluctuating with each rise and fall of the Nile, and bordered by  lagoons where rushes would flourish, and where salt and natron would  accumulate daring the dry season of each year. At the present time the  lake of the Fayum is brackish, and the cliffs which border it contain so  much salt that rain pools which collect on them are not drinkable. The  paths and roads of Egypt are not protected by law as in Western  countries. Each person encroaches on a path or diverts it as may suit  his purpose, only checked by the liberties taken by passers-by in  trespassing if a path be insufficient. Hence, it is very usual to see a  house built over half of a path, and driving the traffic into the  field or almost over the river bank. In this case the Hemti had taken  in as much of the path as he could, and left it but a narrow strip  along the top of the canal bank. The frequent use of the public way  for drying clothes, or spreading out property, gave the idea of  choking the way altogether, and leaving no choice but trespassing on  the crops. No sooner does a donkey pause, or even pass, by a field of  corn than he snatches a mouthful, and in a delay or altercation such  as this the beast is sure to take the advantage.  Donkeys carrying  loads by cornfields are usually muzzled with rope nets, to prevent  their feeding; and even sheep and goats are also fended in the same  way.    The proverb, \"A poor man's name is only his own matter,\" refers to the  independent _fellah_ having no patron or protector who will take up and  defend his name from accusations, as the interests of clients and serfs  would be protected. This being the case, Hemti therefore seizes on the  property, and drives the asses into his own pasture field.    The scene of Meruitensa laying the case before the nobles who sat with  him is interesting as showing that even simple cases were not decided by  one judge, but referred to a council. Similarly, Una lays stress on the  private trial of the queen being confided to him and only one other  judge. Apparently, referring cases to a bench of judges was the means of  preventing corruption.    The speeches of the Sekhti were given at full length in the papyrus, but  owing to injuries we cannot now entirely recover them; they are all in  much the same strain, only the first and last are translated here, and  the others are passed over. The style of these speeches was evidently  looked on as eloquent in those days, and this papyrus really seems to  show the time when long-drawn comparisons and flowery wishes were in  fashion. It is far different from later compositions, as it is also from  the earlier simple narration of crude marvels in the tales of the  magicians.    The close of the tale is defective, but from the remains it appears to  have ended by the gift of the Hemti's property to the oppressed Sekhti  and the triumph of the injured peasant.          GOING TO WAWAT, XIITH DYNASTY          THE SHIPWRECKED SAILOR      The wise servant said, \"Let thy heart be satisfied, O my lord, for  that we have come back to the country; after we have long been on board,  and rowed much, the prow has at last touched land. All the people  rejoice, and embrace us one after another. Moreover, we have come back  in good health, and not a man is lacking; although we have been to the  ends of Wawat, and gone through the land of Senmut, we have returned in  peace, and our land--behold, we have come back to it. Hear me, my  lord; I have no other refuge. Wash thee, and turn the water over thy  ringers; then go and tell the tale to the majesty.\"    His lord replied, \"Thy heart continues still its wandering words! but  although the mouth of a man may save him, his words may also cover his  face with confusion. Wilt thou do then as thy heart moves thee? This  that thou wilt say, tell quietly.\"    The sailor then answered, \"Now I shall tell that which has happened to  me, to my very self I was going to the mines of Pharaoh, and I went down  on the sea on a ship of 150 cubits long and 40 cubits wide, with 150  sailors of the best of Egypt, who had seen heaven and earth, and whose  hearts were stronger than lions. They had said that the wind would not  be contrary, or that there would be none. But as we approached the land  the wind arose, and threw up waves eight cubits high. As for me, I  seized a piece of wood; but those who were in the vessel perished,  without one remaining. A wave threw me on an island, after that I had  been three days alone, without a companion beside my own heart. I laid  me in a thicket, and the shadow covered me. Then stretched I my limbs  to try to find something for my mouth. I found there figs and grapes,  all manner of good herbs, berries and grain, melons of all kinds,  fishes and birds. Nothing was lacking.  And I satisfied myself; and  left on the ground that which was over, of what my arms had been  filled withal. I dug a pit, I lighted a fire, and I made a  burnt-offering unto the gods.    \"Suddenly I heard a noise as of thunder, which I thought to be that of a  wave of the sea. The trees shook, and the earth was moved. I uncovered  my face, and I saw that a serpent drew near. He was thirty cubits long,  and his beard greater than two cubits; his body was as overlayed with  gold, and his colour as that of true lazuli. He coiled himself before me.    \"Then he opened his mouth, while that I lay on my face before him, and  he said to me, 'What has brought thee, what has brought thee, little  one, what has brought thee? If thou sayest not speedily what has  brought thee to this isle, I will make thee know thyself; as a flame  thou shalt vanish, if thou tellest me not something I have not heard,  or which I knew not, before thee.'    \"Then he took me in his mouth and carried me to his resting-place, and  layed me down without any hurt. I was whole and sound, and nothing was  gone from me. Then he opened his mouth against me, while that I lay on  my face before him, and he said, 'What has brought thee, what has  brought thee, little one, what has brought thee to this isle which is in  the sea, and of which the shores are in the midst of the waves?'    \"Then I replied to him, and holding my arms low before him, I said to  him,' I was embarked for the mines by the order of the majesty, in a  ship, 150 cubits was its length, and the width of it 40 cubits. It had  150 sailors of the best of Egypt, who had seen heaven and earth, and  the hearts of whom were stronger than lions. They said that the wind  would not be contrary, or that there would be none. Each of them  exceeded his companion in the prudence of his heart and the strength  of his arm, and I was not beneath any of them. A storm came upon us  while we were on the sea. Hardly could we reach to the shore when the  wind waxed yet greater, and the waves rose even eight cubits. As for  me, I seized a piece of wood, while those who were in the boat  perished without one being left with me for three days.  Behold me now  before thee, for I was brought to this isle by a wave of the sea.'    \"Then said he to me, 'Fear not, fear not, little one, and make not thy  face sad. If thou hast come to me, it is God who has let thee live. For  it is He who has brought thee to this isle of the blest, where nothing  is lacking, and"]]]
