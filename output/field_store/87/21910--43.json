Melas took  the toad in his hand, formed the others in line, and then solemnly headed  the procession as the five walked slowly round the entire field, carrying  the toad. When they got back to the scarecrow again, Melas put the toad  in the jar and sealed it. Then he buried the jar in the middle of the  field, beside the scarecrow.    \"There,\" said Lydia, when it was done, \"that's the very strongest spell  there is. If that doesn't protect the corn, I don't know another thing to  do.\"    Whether it was the scarecrow, or the curse, or the spell, I cannot say,  but it is certain that the corn grew well that summer, and when harvest  time came, Melas was so proud of his crop that he decided to have an  extra celebration. So one day in late summer every one on the entire  farm rose with the dawn and hastened to the fields. It was the twelfth  day of the month, which was counted a lucky day for harvesting, and every  one was gay, as, with sickles in hand, slaves and master alike entered  the field of ripe grain. Melas and two other men led the way, cutting the  stalks and leaving them on the ground to be gathered into sheaves and  stacked by others who followed after.    Meanwhile Lydia, Chloe, and the other women prepared an out-of-door  feast. A calf had been killed and cut up for cooking, and in the  afternoon a huge fire was built. Lydia had charge of the cooking. She set  great pieces of meat before the fire to roast, and told the children to  sit by and turn them often to keep them from burning. Dion and Daphne  also brought wood for the fire, while the slave women mixed cakes of meal  and baked them in the ashes, or went to the spring for water, or carried  refreshing drinks to the workers in the field.    It was sundown when the last sheaf was stacked and Melas gave the signal  to stop work. Chloe at once brought cool water from the spring to the  tired harvesters, and when they had washed their hot hands and faces,  Melas made a rude altar of stones, kindled a fire upon it, and, calling  the people together, offered upon it a handful of the new grain and made  a prayer of thanks to Demeter, the Goddess of the fields, for the rich  harvest. When this was done, the feast was ready. The meat and cakes and  wine were passed to the men by the women, and when they had been well  served, the women too sat down under a tree and ate their supper. It was  a gay party. After supper there were jokes and songs, and Dromas played  upon his shepherd's pipe, until the night came on and the moon showed her  round face over the crest of the hills.    Then Lycias, the oldest slave of all, began to tell stories. He had seen  the battle of Salamis, and he told how he had watched the Persian ships  go down, one after another, before the victorious Greeks. \"And the King  sat right on the high rocks north of the Piraeus and saw 'em go down,\" he  chuckled. \"It was a great sight.\"    When Lycias had finished his story, Dromas told the tale of how the God  Pan had appeared to a shepherd he knew, as he was watching his sheep  along on the hills. \"It's all true,\" he declared, as the story ended. \"I  knew the man myself. All sorts of things happen when you're out alone on  the hillsides.\"    The fire, meanwhile, had died down to a heap of brands and gleaming  coals, and Melas told the Twins to bring some wood to replenish it. They  had been gone only a short time on this errand when the group around the  fire was amazed to see them come darting back into the circle, all out of  breath and with eyes as big as saucers.    \"What is it?\" cried Lydia, springing to her feet.    \"We don't know,\" gasped Dion. \"It's big--and black--and there's two of  it. It's right out by the brush-pile.\"    \"We were just going to get an armful of brush,\" added Daphne, \"when all  of a sudden there it was--right beside us! We didn't wait to see it any  more. We just ran like everything!\"    Lydia poked the coals into a blaze and peered out into the surrounding  darkness.    \"It was wolves, I'll go bail,\" cried Lycias, and he started at once to  climb a tree.    \"Wolves!\" shrieked Chloe, and got behind her mistress. The Twins were  already holding to her skirts.    \"Wolves!\" howled the slaves, \"a whole pack of them!\" and as there was  nothing for them to climb, each hastily tried to get behind some one  else. In the struggle Dromas got crowded back and sat down on a hot coal.  He hadn't many clothes on, so he got up very quickly, and the next howl  he gave was not wholly on account of wolves. Only Lydia and Melas stood  their ground beside the fire. Melas waved a burning brand in the air and  shouted at the top of his lungs, \"Fools! Rabbits! Don't you know wolves  won't come near a fire?\" but nothing soothed the frightened slaves.  Something was coming, and if it wasn't wolves, they thought it was likely  to be a worse creature. They could see two black figures bounding along  in the moonlight, and behind them came a huge dog, barking with all his  might. Bang into the row of cowering slaves they ran, and the biggest  black thing roared \"baa,\" and the little one bleated \"maa,\" right into  Dromas' ear. The \"whole pack of wolves\" was just the old black ewe and  her little black lamb. Argos was chasing them and when he came tearing  into the circle about the fire and saw the sheep safe with Dromas, he sat  down panting, with his tongue hanging out, and looked very much pleased  with himself. Dromas seized the lamb in his arms.    \"It's a fine young ram,\" he cried, \"and it's nothing short of a miracle  that the wolves haven't got it, and its mother too, long before this!'    \"I always said that old ewe was bewitched,\" quavered Lycias. \"It's magic,  I say. And the lamb is as black as Erebus too. No good will come of  this!\"    \"Come, come! We must take them up to the farm-yard at once,\" said Melas,  \"before the old sheep takes it into her head to run away again. Dromas,  you and Argos attend to her, and I'll carry the lamb myself.\"    \"We will all go,\" said Lydia. \"It is time for bed anyway.\" So the remains  of the feast were gathered up, the fire was put out, and the whole  company trailed back over the hill to the farm-house, Melas at the head  of the procession, carrying the lamb in his arms. When the old sheep was  corraled once more with the flock, and the slaves had gone home to their  huts, Melas came in from the farm-yard with the lamb. He seemed strangely  excited.    \"Light the fire on the hearth, wife,\" he said to Lydia. \"There's  something queer about this lamb.\"    Lydia uncovered the coals, laid on some wood, and blew the fire to a  blaze. By its light Melas examined the lamb carefully. Then he said to  Lydia, who stood near with the Twins, \"This ram has but one horn!\"    \"It can't be!\" gasped Lydia. \"Whoever heard of a ram with only one horn?\"    \"Feel it,\" said Melas briefly. Lydia felt it.    \"By all the Gods,\" she cried, \"here is a strange thing!\"    \"Let us feel,\" begged Dion and Daphne. They both felt. There was only one  little budding horn to be found, and that was right in the middle of the  lamb's forehead.    \"What does it mean?\" cried Lydia. \"Is it a miracle? Is it a portent? Does  it mean good luck or bad luck?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Melas. \"Only a priest could tell that.\"    \"Then take it to a priest,\" said Lydia.    \"It is not my sheep,\" said Melas. \"It belongs to Pericles.\"    \"Then you must take it to him and let him decide what shall be done with  it,\" cried Lydia. \"And go soon, I beg of you. I don't wish to have the  creature in the house. It may be bewitched. It may bring all kinds of bad  luck to us.\"    \"It is just as likely to bring good luck as bad,\" said Melas.    \"Is Father really going to take the lamb to Athens?\" asked Dion.    \"Yes,\" answered Melas, with surprising promptness, \"to-morrow.\"    \"Oh,\" cried Dion and Daphne at the same instant, \"_please_ let me go  too.\"    \"No,\" said Lydia at once, but Melas said, \"Not so fast, wife. Seek  guidance of the Gods. The children would learn much from such a journey,  and their chances for learning are few. We should be gone but two days,  if the sea is calm.\"    Lydia was silent for a moment while the Twins stood by breathless with  suspense. At last she said, \"Well,--if the Gods so will,--we will seek an  omen. You could spend the night at the house of my brother, Phaon, the  stone-cutter, I suppose. I have seen him but seldom since he married his  Athenian wife, but no doubt he would make you welcome for the night.\"    She rose slowly as she spoke, and threw a handful of grain upon the  family altar, at the same time praying to Hermes, the God of travelers,  for guidance. Then she ran round the court with her hands over her ears,  and as she came back to the group beside the hearth, suddenly uncovered  them again. The Twins were talking together in low tones.    \"Oh, do you suppose they will let _me_ go?\" Daphne was saying to Dion,  and just at that moment Lydia took her hands from her ears. \"Go\" was the  first word she heard.    \"The omen is favorable,\" cried Lydia. \"You are to go! I prayed to Hermes,  then closed my ears, well knowing that the first word I should hear when  I uncovered them would be the answer to my prayer. That word was 'Go.'  Hasten to bed, my children, for you must make an early start to-morrow.\"    Daphne could scarcely believe her ears. Not a word had been said about  her staying at home because she was a girl! She flew upstairs to bed lest  some one should suddenly think of it.          V    THE TWINS GO TO ATHENS      In the gray dawn of the following morning Lydia stood in the doorway of  her house and watched the three figures disappear down the road toward  the little seaport town of Ambelaca. Melas walked ahead, carrying the  lamb wrapped in his cloak, and the Twins followed, bearing between them a  basket in which Lydia had carefully packed two dressed fowls, some fresh  eggs, and a cheese, to be taken to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9976"],[0,"Hernani (#6)"],[1,"outlived all parties and groups and associations of  which he was a member in that early time, and his life subsequent to  the exciting days of 1830 was a steady development and contains in  itself a reflection of nearly everything that was going on in France.    We may consider him under three aspects: as dramatist, novelist, and  lyric poet. He is greatest under the last aspect. Through all his life  he expressed himself in song. Perhaps no other poet has done this so  thoroughly, so beautifully, and for so long a period. So I shall speak  of his personality and actual experiences when I come to consider his  lyric poetry, and shall first give an account of his work for the  stage and in prose fiction.    In 1827 appeared a so-called historical drama, «Cromwell», which was  not remarkable for much except its lack of historical truth, and its  preface, in which the young man outlined his theories and laid down  the programme of attack upon the classical ideas. This attack was in  reality first made with «Hernani» in 1830. «Marion De Lorme», which  appeared in 1831, is a much weaker play, and abounds in all the  excesses to which Romanticism was prone. Apart from the substance,  which is repulsive and harrowing, when not trivial and weak, the form  of the drama is loose, and one can very easily understand how such a  production would offend an ear trained to the stately, chaste, and  elegant dialogue of the elder poets. If this is all Romanticism has  to offer, let us have back our Corneille and Racine. «Le Roi s'amuse»  (1832) suffers from the same faults, and offends even more against  good taste. These pieces are both strong in the main, though there are  weak passages in both, but their strength is not healthy or beautiful.  Victor Hugo himself called attention to the fact that he depended for  his effect, in these two plays, upon the principle of contrast. It is  a principle which he has employed in nearly all his work, and which is  indeed one of the strongest elements of artistic effect, always and  everywhere, with all writers. Hugo, however, uses it too deliberately  and too exclusively. In «Le Roi s'amuse», for example, he has chosen  a most repulsive figure, Triboulet, whom lie makes hideous both  externally and internally, by every device known to art, and in this  character he implants a pure flower of paternal love. Then he stands  off and says: «Behold what I have done! How deformity looks black  behind that white virtue!» The principle is useful, but he makes a  forced application of it. In his novels, too, every reader will recall  instances where a contrast has been insisted upon till one's patience  is exhausted.    «Lucréce Borgia» (1833) illustrates the same point. It is a piling  of horror upon horror for the sake, apparently, of bringing into  sufficient relief a few passages of great moral beauty. This is as  undignified as it is useless. Virtue needs no such setting. M. Vinet  says that in this drama Hugo pandered to the false taste of the age,  which demanded horrors and violence and sensuous appeals, instead of  leading it, as he could, to follow better principles of taste.    «Marie Tudor» (1833) is, like «Cromwell», unhistorical. It is not one  of Hugo's greatest plays, nor is «Angelo» (1835), another drama,  in prose, founded on history; but «Ruy Blas» (1838) is generally  acknowledged to be, after «Hernani», the best of his dramas. It was  followed, in 1843, by «Les Burgraves», the last of his plays  written for the stage. My judgment may be too unenthusiastic, and  I acknowledge that only time can sift the true from the false, the  excellent from the second-rate; but I would not exchange the little  volume of Musset's unpretending «Comédies et Proverbes» for all the  «Hernanis» and «Ruy Blas» in the world, and that for the simple reason  that Musset is more sincere.    We have seen that at a very early age Victor Hugo wrote two stories,  «Bug Jargal» and «Han d'Islande». In 1831, while in the full heat of  his dramatic activity, he yet found time, by shutting himself up and  going out but once for six months, to write «Notre Dame de Paris»,  which is one of his masterpieces of prose, an historical novel built  on a scale of gigantic proportions, and presupposing exhaustive  archaeological research. It is a vast picture, full of glaring lights  and awful shadows, of Paris in the Middle Ages, with the cathedral of  Notre Dame as background, and indeed as one of the characters.    A man who had produced so many strong plays and this remarkable novel,  not to mention his lyric poetry, could not longer be refused admission  into the national galaxy of great men, and in 1841 Hugo was elected  a member of the Academy. Two years later he was created a peer of  France. In spite of these anchors to conservatism, as one would  suppose them, a title of rank and a seat among the immortals, Hugo  became more and more radical in politics, drifting gradually  towards the conception of an ideal republic, and bending his course  thitherward. When Louis Bonaparte, not content with his election to  the presidency in 1848, overthrew the government, and proclaimed  himself Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, by the infamous _coup  d'état_ of December 1851, there was no enemy more irreconcilable than  Victor Hugo. The brave poet was banished, and did not touch the soil  of France again till 1870, after Sedan, when the wicked Empire had  ignominiously dissolved. Although included in an amnesty, he had not  been willing to return until the Babylonian woe was past. Most of his  exile he spent on the island of Jersey, under the English flag. From  there he issued a political pamphlet, «Napoléon le Petit», and a  succession of volumes of poetry. His second great work of fiction,  «Les Misérables», appeared in 1862, followed by «Les Travailleurs de  la Mer», in 1866, and by «Quatre-vingt-treize», in 1874. «L'Homme qui  Rit», 1866, was an unsuccessful attempt at an historical novel, with  the scene in England. Of his novels «Les Misérables» is incomparably  the best. «Les Travailleurs de la Mer», while powerful in its unity  and intensity, is too full of technical terms and of idiosyncrasies  to be either easy or pleasant reading. «Notre Dame de Paris» and  «Quatre-vingt-treize» are the most popular, next to «Les Misérables».  In «Les Misérables» Hugo employed that short, choppy style which  has come to be known as Hugoesque. To many readers it is decidedly  wearisome, though by others it is considered the acme of nervous,  terse expression.    But it is as a lyric poet, I fancy, far more than as a dramatist, a  novelist, or a political pamphleteer, that Victor Hugo will be known,        «When time has swept both friends and foes.»    Unfortunately, foreign students of French literature are less likely  to seek acquaintance with his poems than with his plays and novels.  The peculiar character of French versification repels us. We,  accustomed to a more heavily accented line, cannot quickly sharpen our  ears to the delicate modulations we encounter there. But when once the  ear is attuned to these fainter harmonies, a wonderful revelation is  made to us in the long succession of songs that rose from the lips of  Victor Hugo; and I think it is safe to say that lie is at least the  greatest French lyric poet.    His poetry is so intimately the product of his life, that to  appreciate it we must know something more of that life, especially  the emotions and incidents connected with his home and family. His  marriage relation was one of perfect harmony, if one may judge of such  matters; and he was happy in his home. His wife was evidently the  companion of his thought. His children were two sons and a daughter.  In this daughter the poet's deepest love was centred, and her graces  are the theme of many of his loveliest songs, while her premature  death by drowning, with her young husband, in 1843, was the occasion  for that one of his lyrics which contains the fullest portion of moral  grandeur, «A Villequier». It is the heartbroken cry of a strong man  whom the hand of God has at last led back to faith and submission  along paths of darkest sorrow. For it must be remarked that Victor  Hugo, intoxicated with success and the atmosphere of protest which he  himself had done so much to create, had for many years apparently lost  sight of his young manhood's conviction of the immanence of a God  in the lives of men. After his daughter's death it was upon his  granddaughter Jeanne that his affection took root--the same Jeanne  whom he afterwards celebrated, throughout his old age, in the poems  which are found in the volume entitled «L'Art d'être Grand-père», and  who was the idol of the French nation. She was married a few years ago  to a son of Alphonse Daudet.    In the volumes of lyrics from 1822 to 1853, including «Odes et  Ballades», «Les Orientales», «Les Feuilles d'Automne», «Les Chants du  Crépuscule», and «Les Voix intérieures», there is a marked change in  the views of the author as to religion and politics, from conservatism  to radicalism, from conviction to uncertainty and almost indifference;  and there seems to be a loss of energy when we compare the first with  the last productions, though there is a gain, of course, in technical  skill. But in all that time there was only an evolution, not a deep  moral change imposed from without, for the life of his heart was, all  those years, serene. But his exile broke this succession of tranquil  years and growing thoughts, and from 1852 to 1870, from «Les  Châtiments» to «L'Année terrible», there runs through his volumes  a deep undertone of solicitude for the welfare of France, and more  especially of sad personal yearning to be back upon her soil. «L'Année  terrible», the year of the invasion of France, the siege of Paris, and  the Commune, brought him back. The very day that Napoléon le Petit  followed his conquerors out of French territory, Victor"]]]
