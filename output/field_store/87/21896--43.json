No--not another word--it would be more distressing to you than you  imagine, perhaps. Now there is just one thing I want to say. I feel that  I am really indirectly responsible for this illness of yours, and I think  I ought to defray the expense which it has--eh?'    But this offer was quite distinctly declined. Mr Eldred, not pressing it,  left almost at once: not, however, before Mr Garrett had insisted upon  his taking a note of the class-mark of the Tractate Middoth, which, as he  said, Mr Eldred could at leisure get for himself. But Mr Eldred did not  reappear at the library.           *       *       *       *       *    William Garrett had another visitor that day in the person of a  contemporary and colleague from the library, one George Earle. Earle had  been one of those who found Garrett lying insensible on the floor just  inside the 'class' or cubicle (opening upon the central alley of a  spacious gallery) in which the Hebrew books were placed, and Earle had  naturally been very anxious about his friend's condition. So as soon as  library hours were over he appeared at the lodgings. 'Well,' he said  (after other conversation), 'I've no notion what it was that put you  wrong, but I've got the idea that there's something wrong in the  atmosphere of the library. I know this, that just before we found you I  was coming along the gallery with Davis, and I said to him, \"Did ever you  know such a musty smell anywhere as there is about here? It can't be  wholesome.\" Well now, if one goes on living a long time with a smell of  that kind (I tell you it was worse than I ever knew it) it must get into  the system and break out some time, don't you think?'    Garrett shook his head. 'That's all very well about the smell--but it  isn't always there, though I've noticed it the last day or two--a sort of  unnaturally strong smell of dust. But no--that's not what did for me. It  was something I _saw_. And I want to tell you about it. I went into that  Hebrew class to get a book for a man that was inquiring for it down  below. Now that same book I'd made a mistake about the day before. I'd  been for it, for the same man, and made sure that I saw an old parson in  a cloak taking it out. I told my man it was out: off he went, to call  again next day. I went back to see if I could get it out of the parson:  no parson there, and the book on the shelf. Well, yesterday, as I say, I  went again. This time, if you please--ten o'clock in the morning,  remember, and as much light as ever you get in those classes, and there  was my parson again, back to me, looking at the books on the shelf I  wanted. His hat was on the table, and he had a bald head. I waited a  second or two looking at him rather particularly. I tell you, he had a  very nasty bald head. It looked to me dry, and it looked dusty, and the  streaks of hair across it were much less like hair than cobwebs. Well, I  made a bit of a noise on purpose, coughed and moved my feet. He turned  round and let me see his face--which I hadn't seen before. I tell you  again, I'm not mistaken. Though, for one reason or another I didn't take  in the lower part of his face, I did see the upper part; and it was  perfectly dry, and the eyes were very deep-sunk; and over them, from the  eyebrows to the cheek-bone, there were _cobwebs_--thick. Now that closed  me up, as they say, and I can't tell you anything more.'           *       *       *       *       *    What explanations were furnished by Earle of this phenomenon it does not  very much concern us to inquire; at all events they did not convince  Garrett that he had not seen what he had seen.           *       *       *       *       *    Before William Garrett returned to work at the library, the librarian  insisted upon his taking a week's rest and change of air. Within a few  days' time, therefore, he was at the station with his bag, looking for a  desirable smoking compartment in which to travel to Burnstow-on-Sea,  which he had not previously visited. One compartment and one only seemed  to be suitable. But, just as he approached it, he saw, standing in front  of the door, a figure so like one bound up with recent unpleasant  associations that, with a sickening qualm, and hardly knowing what he  did, he tore open the door of the next compartment and pulled himself  into it as quickly as if death were at his heels. The train moved off,  and he must have turned quite faint, for he was next conscious of a  smelling-bottle being put to his nose. His physician was a nice-looking  old lady, who, with her daughter, was the only passenger in the carriage.    But for this incident it is not very likely that he would have made any  overtures to his fellow-travellers. As it was, thanks and inquiries and  general conversation supervened inevitably; and Garrett found himself  provided before the journey's end not only with a physician, but with a  landlady: for Mrs Simpson had apartments to let at Burnstow, which seemed  in all ways suitable. The place was empty at that season, so that Garrett  was thrown a good deal into the society of the mother and daughter. He  found them very acceptable company. On the third evening of his stay he  was on such terms with them as to be asked to spend the evening in their  private sitting-room.    During their talk it transpired that Garrett's work lay in a library.  'Ah, libraries are fine places,' said Mrs Simpson, putting down her work  with a sigh; 'but for all that, books have played me a sad turn, or  rather _a_ book has.'    'Well, books give me my living, Mrs Simpson, and I should be sorry to say  a word against them: I don't like to hear that they have been bad for  you.'    'Perhaps Mr Garrett could help us to solve our puzzle, mother,' said Miss  Simpson.    'I don't want to set Mr Garrett off on a hunt that might waste a  lifetime, my dear, nor yet to trouble him with our private affairs.'    'But if you think it in the least likely that I could be of use, I do beg  you to tell me what the puzzle is, Mrs Simpson. If it is finding out  anything about a book, you see, I am in rather a good position to do it.'    'Yes, I do see that, but the worst of it is that we don't know the name  of the book.'    'Nor what it is about?'    'No, nor that either.'    'Except that we don't think it's in English, mother--and that is not much  of a clue.'    'Well, Mr Garrett,' said Mrs Simpson, who had not yet resumed her work,  and was looking at the fire thoughtfully, 'I shall tell you the story.  You will please keep it to yourself, if you don't mind? Thank you. Now it  is just this. I had an old uncle, a Dr Rant. Perhaps you may have heard  of him. Not that he was a distinguished man, but from the odd way he  chose to be buried.'    'I rather think I have seen the name in some guidebook.'    'That would be it,' said Miss Simpson. 'He left directions--horrid old  man!--that he was to be put, sitting at a table in his ordinary clothes,  in a brick room that he'd had made underground in a field near his house.  Of course the country people say he's been seen about there in his old  black cloak.'    'Well, dear, I don't know much about such things,' Mrs Simpson went on,  'but anyhow he is dead, these twenty years and more. He was a clergyman,  though I'm sure I can't imagine how he got to be one: but he did no duty  for the last part of his life, which I think was a good thing; and he  lived on his own property: a very nice estate not a great way from here.  He had no wife or family; only one niece, who was myself, and one nephew,  and he had no particular liking for either of us--nor for anyone else, as  far as that goes. If anything, he liked my cousin better than he did  me--for John was much more like him in his temper, and, I'm afraid I must  say, his very mean sharp ways. It might have been different if I had not  married; but I did, and that he very much resented. Very well: here he  was with this estate and a good deal of money, as it turned out, of which  he had the absolute disposal, and it was understood that we--my cousin  and I--would share it equally at his death. In a certain winter, over  twenty years back, as I said, he was taken ill, and I was sent for to  nurse him. My husband was alive then, but the old man would not hear of  _his_ coming. As I drove up to the house I saw my cousin John driving  away from it in an open fly and looking, I noticed, in very good spirits.  I went up and did what I could for my uncle, but I was very soon sure  that this would be his last illness; and he was convinced of it too.  During the day before he died he got me to sit by him all the time, and I  could see there was something, and probably something unpleasant, that he  was saving up to tell me, and putting it off as long as he felt he could  afford the strength--I'm afraid purposely in order to keep me on the  stretch. But, at last, out it came. \"Mary,\" he said,--\"Mary, I've made my  will in John's favour: he has everything, Mary.\" Well, of course that  came as a bitter shock to me, for we--my husband and I--were not rich  people, and if he could have managed to live a little easier than he was  obliged to do, I felt it might be the prolonging of his life. But I said  little or nothing to my uncle, except that he had a right to do what he  pleased: partly because I couldn't think of anything to say, and partly  because I was sure there was more to come: and so there was. \"But, Mary,\"  he said, \"I'm not very fond of John, and I've made another will in _your_  favour. _You_ can have everything. Only you've got to find the will, you  see: and I don't mean to tell you where it is.\" Then he chuckled to  himself, and I waited, for again I was sure he hadn't finished. \"That's a  good girl,\" he said after a time,--\"you wait, and I'll tell you as much  as I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#6)"],[1,"that  he had met his match, for Robin warded and parried all of them, and,  before the Tinker thought, he gave him a rap upon the ribs in return. At  this Robin laughed aloud, and the Tinker grew more angry than ever, and  smote again with all his might and main. Again Robin warded two of the  strokes, but at the third, his staff broke beneath the mighty blows of  the Tinker. \"Now, ill betide thee, traitor staff,\" cried Robin, as it  fell from his hands; \"a foul stick art thou to serve me thus in mine  hour of need.\"    \"Now yield thee,\" quoth the Tinker, \"for thou art my captive; and if  thou do not, I will beat thy pate to a pudding.\"    To this Robin Hood made no answer, but, clapping his horn to his lips,  he blew three blasts, loud and clear.    \"Ay,\" quoth the Tinker, \"blow thou mayest, but go thou must with me to  Nottingham Town, for the Sheriff would fain see thee there. Now wilt  thou yield thee, or shall I have to break thy pretty head?\"    \"An I must drink sour ale, I must,\" quoth Robin, \"but never have I  yielded me to man before, and that without wound or mark upon my  body. Nor, when I bethink me, will I yield now. Ho, my merry men! Come  quickly!\"    Then from out the forest leaped Little John and six stout yeomen clad in  Lincoln green.    \"How now, good master,\" cried Little John, \"what need hast thou that  thou dost wind thy horn so loudly?\"    \"There stands a tinker,\" quoth Robin, \"that would fain take me to  Nottingham, there to hang upon the gallows tree.\"    \"Then shall he himself hang forthwith,\" cried Little John, and he and  the others made at the Tinker, to seize him.    \"Nay, touch him not,\" said Robin, \"for a right stout man is he. A metal  man he is by trade, and a mettled man by nature; moreover, he doth sing  a lovely ballad. Say, good fellow, wilt thou join my merry men all?  Three suits of Lincoln green shalt thou have a year, besides forty marks  in fee; thou shalt share all with us and lead a right merry life in  the greenwood; for cares have we not, and misfortune cometh not upon  us within the sweet shades of Sherwood, where we shoot the dun deer and  feed upon venison and sweet oaten cakes, and curds and honey. Wilt thou  come with me?\"    \"Ay, marry, will I join with you all,\" quoth the Tinker, \"for I love a  merry life, and I love thee, good master, though thou didst thwack my  ribs and cheat me into the bargain. Fain am I to own thou art both a  stouter and a slyer man than I; so I will obey thee and be thine own  true servant.\"    So all turned their steps to the forest depths, where the Tinker was to  live henceforth. For many a day he sang ballads to the band, until the  famous Allan a Dale joined them, before whose sweet voice all others  seemed as harsh as a raven's; but of him we will learn hereafter.          The Shooting Match at Nottingham Town    THEN THE SHERIFF was very wroth because of this failure to take jolly  Robin, for it came to his ears, as ill news always does, that the people  laughed at him and made a jest of his thinking to serve a warrant upon  such a one as the bold outlaw. And a man hates nothing so much as  being made a jest of; so he said: \"Our gracious lord and sovereign King  himself shall know of this, and how his laws are perverted and despised  by this band of rebel outlaws. As for yon traitor Tinker, him will  I hang, if I catch him, upon the very highest gallows tree in all  Nottinghamshire.\"    Then he bade all his servants and retainers to make ready to go to  London Town, to see and speak with the King.    At this there was bustling at the Sheriff's castle, and men ran hither  and thither upon this business and upon that, while the forge fires of  Nottingham glowed red far into the night like twinkling stars, for  all the smiths of the town were busy making or mending armor for the  Sheriff's troop of escort. For two days this labor lasted, then, on  the third, all was ready for the journey. So forth they started in the  bright sunlight, from Nottingham Town to Fosse Way and thence to Watling  Street; and so they journeyed for two days, until they saw at last the  spires and towers of great London Town; and many folks stopped, as  they journeyed along, and gazed at the show they made riding along the  highways with their flashing armor and gay plumes and trappings.    In London King Henry and his fair Queen Eleanor held their court, gay  with ladies in silks and satins and velvets and cloth of gold, and also  brave knights and gallant courtiers.    Thither came the Sheriff and was shown into the King's presence.    \"A boon, a boon,\" quoth he, as he knelt upon the ground.    \"Now what wouldst thou have?\" said the King. \"Let us hear what may be  thy desires.\"    \"O good my Lord and Sovereign,\" spake the Sheriff, \"in Sherwood Forest  in our own good shire of Nottingham, liveth a bold outlaw whose name is  Robin Hood.\"    \"In good sooth,\" said the King, \"his doings have reached even our own  royal ears. He is a saucy, rebellious varlet, yet, I am fain to own, a  right merry soul withal.\"    \"But hearken, O my most gracious Sovereign,\" said the Sheriff. \"I sent  a warrant to him with thine own royal seal attached, by a right lusty  knave, but he beat the messenger and stole the warrant. And he killeth  thy deer and robbeth thine own liege subjects even upon the great  highways.\"    \"Why, how now,\" quoth the King wrathfully. \"What wouldst thou have  me do? Comest thou not to me with a great array of men-at-arms and  retainers, and yet art not able to take a single band of lusty knaves  without armor on breast, in thine own county! What wouldst thou have  me do? Art thou not my Sheriff? Are not my laws in force in  Nottinghamshire? Canst thou not take thine own course against those that  break the laws or do any injury to thee or thine? Go, get thee gone, and  think well; devise some plan of thine own, but trouble me no further.  But look well to it, Master Sheriff, for I will have my laws obeyed by  all men within my kingdom, and if thou art not able to enforce them thou  art no sheriff for me. So look well to thyself, I say, or ill may befall  thee as well as all the thieving knaves in Nottinghamshire. When the  flood cometh it sweepeth away grain as well as chaff.\"    Then the Sheriff turned away with a sore and troubled heart, and sadly  he rued his fine show of retainers, for he saw that the King was angry  because he had so many men about him and yet could not enforce the  laws. So, as they all rode slowly back to Nottingham, the Sheriff was  thoughtful and full of care. Not a word did he speak to anyone, and no  one of his men spoke to him, but all the time he was busy devising some  plan to take Robin Hood.    \"Aha!\" cried he suddenly, smiting his hand upon his thigh \"I have it  now! Ride on, my merry men all, and let us get back to Nottingham Town  as speedily as we may. And mark well my words: before a fortnight  is passed, that evil knave Robin Hood will be safely clapped into  Nottingham gaol.\"    But what was the Sheriff's plan?    As a usurer takes each one of a bag of silver angels, feeling each coin  to find whether it be clipped or not, so the Sheriff, as all rode slowly  and sadly back toward Nottingham, took up thought after thought in turn,  feeling around the edges of each but finding in every one some flaw.  At last he thought of the daring soul of jolly Robin and how, as he the  Sheriff knew, he often came even within the walls of Nottingham.    \"Now,\" thought the Sheriff, \"could I but persuade Robin nigh to  Nottingham Town so that I could find him, I warrant I would lay hands  upon him so stoutly that he would never get away again.\" Then of a  sudden it came to him like a flash that were he to proclaim a great  shooting match and offer some grand prize, Robin Hood might be  overpersuaded by his spirit to come to the butts; and it was this  thought which caused him to cry \"Aha!\" and smite his palm upon his  thigh.    So, as soon as he had returned safely to Nottingham, he sent messengers  north and south, and east and west, to proclaim through town, hamlet,  and countryside, this grand shooting match, and everyone was bidden that  could draw a longbow, and the prize was to be an arrow of pure beaten  gold.    When Robin Hood first heard the news of this he was in Lincoln Town, and  hastening back to Sherwood Forest he soon called all his merry men about  him and spoke to them thus:    \"Now hearken, my merry men all, to the news that I have brought from  Lincoln Town today. Our friend the Sheriff of Nottingham hath proclaimed  a shooting match, and hath sent messengers to tell of it through all the  countryside, and the prize is to be a bright golden arrow. Now I fain  would have one of us win it, both because of the fairness of the prize  and because our sweet friend the Sheriff hath offered it. So we will  take our bows and shafts and go there to shoot, for I know right well  that merriment will be a-going. What say ye, lads?\"    Then young David of Doncaster spoke up and said, \"Now listen, I pray  thee, good master, unto what I say. I have come straight from our friend  Eadom o' the Blue Boar, and there I heard the full news of this same  match. But, master, I know from him, and he got it from the Sheriff's  man Ralph o' the Scar, that this same knavish Sheriff hath but laid a  trap for thee in this shooting match and wishes nothing so much as to  see thee there. So go not, good master, for I know right well he doth  seek to beguile thee, but stay within the greenwood lest we all meet  dole and woe.\"    \"Now,\" quoth Robin, \"thou art a wise lad and keepest thine ears open and  thy mouth shut, as becometh a wise and crafty woodsman. But shall we let  it be said that the Sheriff of Nottingham did cow bold Robin Hood and  sevenscore as fair archers as are in all merry England? Nay, good David,  what thou tellest me maketh me to desire the prize even more than I else  should do. But what sayeth our good gossip "]]]
