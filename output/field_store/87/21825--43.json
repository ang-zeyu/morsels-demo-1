Some were  lying down to drink the water flowing in the gutters, which water was  often tinged with human blood, for the rain was by this time washing  away many of the dark spots in the streets. Others lay coiled up in  heaps under their soaking _ponchos_, trying to sleep a little, their  arms stacked close at hand. There were men to all appearances fast  asleep, standing with their arms in the reins of the horses which had  borne them safely through the leaden hail of that day of terror.  Numerous were the jokes and loud was the coarse laughter of many who  next day would be lying stiff in death, but little thought seemed to be  expended on that possibility.    Men looted the stores and feasted, or wantonly destroyed valuables they  had no use for. None stopped this havoc, for the officers were  quartered in the adjacent houses, themselves holding high revelry.  Lawless hordes visited the police offices, threw their furniture into  the streets, tore to shreds all the books, papers and records found,  and created general havoc. They gorged and cursed, using swords for  knives, and lay down in the soaking streets or leaned against the guns  to smoke the inevitable _cigarillo_. A few looked up at the gilded keys  of St. Peter adorning the front of the cathedral, perhaps wondering if  they would be used to admit them to a better world.    Next day, as I sallied forth to the dismal duty of caring for the dead  and dying, the guns of the Argentine fleet [Footnote: British-built  vessels of the latest and most approved types.] in the river opposite  the city blazed forth upon the quarter held by the Government's loyal  troops. One hundred and fifty-four shots were fired, two of the largest  gunboats firing three-hundred and six-hundred pounders. Soon every  square was a shambles, and the mud oozed with blood. The Buenos Ayres  _Standard_, describing that day of fierce warfare, stated:    \"At dawn, the National troops, quartered in the Plaza Libertad, made  another desperate attack on the Revolutionary positions in the Plaza  Lavalle. The Krupp guns, mitrailleuses and gatlings went off at a  terrible rate, and volleys succeeded each other, second for second,  from five in the morning till half-past nine. The work of death was  fearful, and hundreds of spectators were shot down as they watched from  their balconies or housetops. Cannon balls riddled all the houses near  the Cinco Esquinas. In the attack on the Plaza Lavalle, three hundred  men must have fallen.\"    [Illustration]    \"At ten a.m. the white flag of truce was hoisted on both sides, and the  dismal work of collecting the dead and wounded began. The ambulances of  the Asistencia Publica, the cars of the tram companies and the wagons  of the Red Cross were busily engaged all day in carrying away the dead.  It is estimated that in the Plaza Lavalle above 600 men were wounded  and 300 killed. Considering that the Revolutionists defended an  entrenched position, whilst the National troops attacked, we may  imagine that the losses of the latter were enormous.\"    \"General Lavalle, commander-in-chief of the National forces, gave  orders for a large number of coffins, which were not delivered, as the  undertaker wished to be paid cash. It is to be supposed that these  coffins were for the dead officers.\"    \"When the white flags were run up, Dr. Del Valle, Senator of the  Nation, sent, in the name of the Revolutionary Committee, an ultimatum  to the National Government, demanding the immediate dismissal of the  President of the Republic and dissolution of Congress. Later on it was  known that both parties had agreed on an armistice, to last till  mid-day on Monday.\"    Of the third day's sanguinary fighting, the _Standard_ wrote:    \"The Plaza Libertad was taken by General Lavalle at the head of the  National troops under the most terrible fire, but the regiments held  well together and carried the position in a most gallant manner,  confirming the reputation of indomitable valor that the Argentine  troops won at the trenches of Curupayti. Our readers may imagine the  fire they suffered in the straight streets swept by Krupp guns,  gatlings and mitrailleuses, while every housetop was a fortress whence  a deadly fire was poured on the heads of the soldiers. Let anybody take  the trouble to visit the Calles [Footnote: Streets] Cerrito, Libertad  and Talcahuano, the vicinity of the Plazas Parque and Lavalle, and he  will be staggered to see how all the houses have been riddled by  mitrailleuses and rifle bullets. The passage of cannon balls is marked  on the iron frames of windows, smashed frames and demolished balconies  of the houses.    \"The Miro Palace, in the Plaza Parque, is a sorry picture of wreckage:  the 'mirador' is knocked to pieces by balls and shells; the walls are  riddled on every side, and nearly all the beautiful Italian balconies  and buttresses have been demolished. The firing around the palace must  have been fearful, to judge by the utter ruin about, and all the  telephone wires dangling over the street in meshes from every house.  Ruin and wreckage everywhere.    \"By this time the hospitals of the city, the churches and public  buildings were filled with the wounded and dying, borne there on  stretchers made often of splintered and shattered doors. Nearly a  hundred men were taken into the San Francisco convent alone.\" Yet with  all this the lust for blood was not quenched. It could still be written  of the fourth day:    \"At about half-past two, a sharp attack was made by the Government  troops on the Plaza Parque, and a fearful fire was kept up. Hundreds  and hundreds fell on both sides, but the Government troops were finally  repulsed. People standing at the corners of the streets cheering for  the Revolutionists were fired on and many were killed. Bodies of  Government troops were stationed at the corners of the streets leading  to the Plaza, Large bales of hay had been heaped up to protect them  from the deadly fire of the Revolutionists.    \"It was at times difficult to remember that heavy slaughter was going  on around. In many parts of the city people were chatting, joking and  laughing at their doors. The attitude of the foreign population was  more serious; they seemed to foresee the heavy responsibilities of the  position and to accurately forecast the result of the insurrection.    \"The bulletins of the various newspapers during the revolution were  purchased by the thousand and perused with the utmost avidity; fancy  prices were often paid for them. The Sunday edition of _The Standard_  was sold by enterprising newsboys in the suburbs as high as $3.00 per  copy, whilst fifty cents was the regulation price for a momentary peep  at our first column.\"    Towards the close of that memorable 29th of July the hail of bullets  ceased, but the insurgent fleet still kept up its destructive  bombardment of the Government houses for four hours.    The Revolutionists were defeated, or, as was seriously affirmed, had  been sold for the sum of one million Argentine dollars.    _\"Estamos vendidos!\" \"Estamos vendidos!\"_ (We are sold! We are sold!)  was heard on every hand. Because of this surrender officers broke their  swords and men threw away their rifles as they wept with rage. A  sergeant exclaimed: \"And for this they called us out--to surrender  without a struggle! Cowards! Poltroons!\" And then with a stern glance  around he placed his rifle to his breast and shot himself through the  heart. After the cessation of hostilities both sides collected their  dead, and the wounded were placed under the care of surgeons, civil as  well as military.    Notwithstanding the fact that the insurgents were said to be defeated,  the President, Dr. Celman, fled from the city, and the amusing  spectacle was seen of men and youths patrolling the streets wearing  cards in their hats which read: _\"Ya se fue el burro\"_ (At last the  donkey has gone). A more serious sight, however, was when the effigy of  the fleeing President was crucified.    Thus ended the insurrection of 1890, a rising which sent three thousand  brave men into eternity.    What changes had taken place in four short days! At the Plaza Libertad  the wreckage was most complete. The beautiful partierres were trodden  down by horses; the trees had been partially cut down for fuel; pools  of blood, remnants of slaughtered animals, offal, refuse everywhere.    Since the glorious days of the British invasion--glorious from an  Argentine point of view--Buenos Ayres had never seen its streets turned  into barricades and its housetops into fortresses. In times of  electoral excitement we had seen electors attack each other in bands  many years, but never was organized warfare carried on as during this  revolution. The Plaza Parque was occupied by four or five thousand  Revolutionary troops; all access to the Plaza was defended by armed  groups on the house-tops and barricades in the streets, Krupp guns and  that most infernal of modern inventions, the mitrailleuse, swept all  the streets, north, south, east and west. The deadly grape swept the  streets down to the very river, and not twenty thousand men could have  taken the Revolutionary position by storm, except by gutting the houses  and piercing the blocks, as Colonel Garmendia proposed, to avoid the  awful loss of life suffered in the taking of the Plaza Libertad on  Saturday morning.    At the close of the revolution the great city found itself suffering  from a quasi-famine. High prices were asked for everything. In some  districts provisions could not be obtained even at famine prices. The  writer for the first time in his life had to go here and there to beg a  loaf of bread for his family's needs.    A reporter of the _Argentine News_, July 31st of that same year, wrote:    \"There is a revolution going on in Rosario. It began on Saturday, when  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7506"],[0,"The Huge Hunter; Or, The Steam Man of the Prairies (#6)"],[1,"y.    'Yes, that there is what I call the important question,' added Ethan.    'That it is, of the greatest account, as me grandmither observed, whin  she fell off the staaple, and axed whether her pipe was broke.'    'It's in thar,' was the reply of the hunter, as he pointed to the  wildest-looking portion of the ravine.    'Let's geit it then.'    'Thar be some other things that have got to be looked after first,'  was the reply, 'and we've got to find a place to stow ourselves away.'    This was a matter of considerable difficulty: but they succeeded at  last in discovering a retreat in the rocks, where they were secure  from any attack, no matter by how formidable a number made.    After this, they hunted up a grazing place for their animals, which  were turned loose.    They soon found that the trapper had not deceived them. There was an  unusually rich deposit of gold in one portion of the ravine, and the  men fell to work with a will, conscious that they would reap a rich  reward for their labor.    The name, Wolf Ravine, had been given to it by the trapper, because on  his first discovery of it he had shot a large mountain wolf, that was  clambering up the side; but none others were seen afterward.    But there was one serious drawback to this brilliant prospect of  wealth. Indians of the most treacherous and implacable kind were all  around them, and were by no means disposed to-let them alone.    On the second day after their labor, a horde of them came screeching  down upon them; and had it not been for the safe retreat, which the  trapper's foresight had secured, all three would have been massacred.    As it was, they had a severe fight, and were penned up for the better  part of two days, by which time they had slain too many of their  enemies that the remaining ones were glad to withdraw.    But when the trapper stole out on a visit to his horses he found that  every one had been completely riddled by balls. The treacherous dogs  had taken every means of revenge at hand.    'Skin me fur a skunk, but we've stood this long as we ought to!'  exclaimed Baldy Bicknell, when he returned. 'You take care of  yourselves till I come back again!'    With which speech he slung his rifle over his shoulder and started for  St. Louis.                      CHAPTER VII. THE STEAM MAN ON HIS TRAVELS.    YOUNG BRAINERD had a mortal fear that the existence of the steam man  would be discovered by some outsider, when a large crowd would  probably collect around his house, and his friends would insist on a  display of the powers of the extraordinary mechanism.    But there was no one in the secret except his mother, and there was no  danger of her revealing it. So the boy experimented with his invention  until there was nothing more left for him to do, except to sit and  watch its workings.    Finally, when he began to wonder at the prolonged delay of the  trapper, who had visited him some weeks before, he made his appearance  as suddenly as if he had risen from the ground, with the inquiry:    'Have you got that thundering old thing ready?'    'Yes: he has been ready for a week, and waiting.'    'Wal, start her out then, fur I'm in a hurry.'    'You will have to wait awhile, for we can't get ready under half a  day.'    It was the hunter's supposition that the boy was going to start the  man right off up street, and then toward the West; but he speedily  revealed a far different plan.    It was to box up the man and take it to Independence by steamboat. At  that place they would take it out upon the prairie, set it up and  start it off, without any fear of disturbance from the crowds which  usually collect at such places, as they could speedily run away from  them.    When the plan was explained to Baldy, he fully indorsed it, and the  labor was begun at once. The legs of the steam man being doubled up,  they were able to get it in a box, which gave it the appearance of an  immense piano under transportation. This, with considerable  difficulty, was transported to the wharf, where, with much grumbling  upon the part of the men, it was placed on board the steamboat,  quickly followed by the wagon and the few necessary tools.    The boy then bade his mother good-by, and she, suspecting he would be  gone but a short time, said farewell to him, with little of the regret  she would otherwise have felt, and a few hours later the party were  steaming rapidly up the 'Mad Missouri.'    Nothing worthy of notice occurred on the passage, and they reached  Independence in safety. They secured a landing somewhat above the  town, on the western side, where they had little fear of disturbance.    Here the extraordinary foresight and skill of the boy was manifest,  for, despite the immense size of the steam man, it was so put together  that they were able to load it upon the wagon, and the two, without  any other assistance, were able to drag it out upon the prairie.    'You see, it may break down entirely,' remarked young Brainerd, 'and  then we can load it on the wagon and drag it along.'    'That must be a powerful strong wagon to carry such a big baby in if,  as that.'    'So it is; it will hold five times the weight without being hurt in  the least.'    It was early in the forenoon when they drew It out upon the prairie in  this manner, and began putting it together. It certainly had a  grotesque and fearful look when it was stripped of all its bandages,  and stood before them in all its naked majesty.    It had been so securely and carefully put away, that it was found  uninjured in the least. The trapper could not avoid laughing when the  boy clambered as nimbly up its shoulder as another Gulliver, and made  a minute examination of every portion of the machinery.    While thus employed, Baldy took the shafts of the wagon, and trotted  to a farm-house, which he descried in the distance, where he loaded it  down with wood and filled the tank with water. By the time he  returned, Johnny had everything in readiness, and they immediately  began 'firing up.'    In this they bore quite a resemblance to the modern steam fire  engines, acquiring a head of steam with remarkable quickness. As the  boy had never yet given the man such an opportunity to stretch his  legs as he was now about to do, he watched its motions with  considerable anxiety.    Everything was secured in the most careful manner, a goodly quantity  of fuel piled on, the boiler filled with water, and they patiently  waited the generation of a sufficient head of steam.    'Is it all good prairie land in that direction?' inquired the boy,  pointing to the West.    'Thar's all yer kin want.'    'Then we'll start. Look out!'    Despite the warning thus kindly given, the steam man started with a  sudden jerk, that both of them came near being thrown out of the  wagon.    The prairie was quite level and hard, so that everything was  favorable, and the wagon went bounding over the ground at a rate so  fast that both the occupants were considerably frightened, and the boy  quickly brought it down to a more moderate trot.    This speed soon became monotonous, and as it ran so evenly, Baldy  said:    'Let her go, younker, and show us what she can do.'    The rod controlling the valve was given a slight pull, and away they  went, coursing like a locomotive over the prairies, the wheels  spinning round at a tremendous rate, while the extraordinary speed  caused the wind thus created almost to lift the caps from their heads,  and a slight swell in the prairie sent the wagon up with a bound that  threatened to unseat them both.    It worked splendidly. The black smoke puffed rapidly from the top of  the hat, and the machinery worked so smoothly that there was scarcely  a click heard. The huge spiked feet came lightly to the ground, and  were lifted but a short distance from it, and their long sweep and  rapid movement showed unmistakably that the steam man was going at a  pace which might well defy anything that had yet swept the prairies.    As there was no little risk in running at this speed, and as young  Brainerd had not yet become accustomed to controlling it, he slackened  the rate again, so that it sank to an easy gliding motion, equal to  the rapid trot of an ordinary horse.    Fully ten minutes were passed in this manner, when steam was entirely  shut off, whereupon the giant came to such a sudden halt that both  were thrown violently forward and bruised somewhat.    'Skulp me! but don't stop quite so sudden like,' said the hunter.  'It's a little unhandy fur me to hold up so quick!'    'I'll soon learn to manage it,' replied Johnny. 'I see it won't do to  shut off all at once.'    Descending from his perch, he examined every portion of the engine.  Several parts were found heated, and the fuel was getting low. The  water in the boiler, however, was just right, the engineer having been  able to control that from his seat in the wagon.    Throwing in a lot of wood, they remounted to their perch and started  forward again. There was an abundance of steam, and the boy readily  acquired such a familiarity with the working of his man, that he  controlled it with all the skill of an experienced engineer.    The speed was slackened, then increased. It stopped and then started  forward again with all the ease and celerity that it could have done  if really human, while it showed a reserve of power and velocity  capable of performing wonders, if necessary.    As yet they had seen nothing of any travelers. They were quite anxious  to come across some, that they might show them what they were capable  of doing.    'There must be some passing over the plains,' remarked Johnny, when  they had passed some thirty or forty miles.    'Plenty of 'em; but we've got out of the track of 'em. If you'll turn  off summat to the left, we'll run foul of 'em afore dark.'    The boy did as directed, and the rattling pace was kept up for several  hours. When it was noon they helped themselves to a"]]]
