There was an  established system of traffic between the Hurons and the Algonquins of  the Ottawa and Lake Nipissing: the Hurons exchanging wampum,  fishing-nets, and corn for fish and furs. [19] From various relics found  in their graves, it may be inferred that they also traded with tribes of  the Upper Lakes, as well as with tribes far southward, towards the Gulf  of Mexico. Each branch of traffic was the monopoly of the family or clan  by whom it was opened. They might, if they could, punish interlopers, by  stripping them of all they possessed, unless the latter had succeeded in  reaching home with the fruits of their trade,--in which case the  outraged monopolists had no further right of redress, and could not  attempt it without a breaking of the public peace, and exposure to the  authorized vengeance of the other party. [20] Their fisheries, too, were  regulated by customs having the force of laws. These pursuits, with  their hunting,--in which they were aided by a wolfish breed of dogs  unable to bark,--consumed the autumn and early winter; but before the  new year the greater part of the men were gathered in their villages.    [19] Champlain (1627), 84.  [20] BrÃ©beuf, Relation des Hurons, 1636, 156 (Cramoisy).    Now followed their festal season; for it was the season of idleness for  the men, and of leisure for the women. Feasts, gambling, smoking, and  dancing filled the vacant hours. Like other Indians, the Hurons were  desperate gamblers, staking their all,--ornaments, clothing, canoes,  pipes, weapons, and wives. One of their principal games was played with  plum-stones, or wooden lozenges, black on one side and white on the  other. These were tossed up in a wooden bowl, by striking it sharply  upon the ground, and the players betted on the black or white. Sometimes  a village challenged a neighboring village. The game was played in one  of the houses. Strong poles were extended from side to side, and on  these sat or perched the company, party facing party, while two players  struck the bowl on the ground between. Bets ran high; and BrÃ©beuf  relates, that once, in midwinter, with the snow nearly three feet deep,  the men of his village returned from a gambling visit, bereft of their  leggins, and barefoot, yet in excellent humor. [21] Ludicrous as it may  appear, these games were often medical prescriptions, and designed as a  cure of the sick.    [21] BrÃ©beuf, Relation des Hurons, 1636, 113.--This game is still a  favorite among the Iroquois, some of whom hold to the belief that they  will play it after death in the realms of bliss. In all their important  games of chance, they employed charms, incantations, and all the  resources of their magical art, to gain good luck.    Their feasts and dances were of various character, social, medical, and  mystical or religious. Some of their feasts were on a scale of  extravagant profusion. A vain or ambitious host threw all his substance  into one entertainment, inviting the whole village, and perhaps several  neighboring villages also. In the winter of 1635 there was a feast at  the village of Contarrea, where thirty kettles were on the fires, and  twenty deer and four bears were served up. [22] The invitation was  simple. The messenger addressed the desired guest with the concise  summons, \"Come and eat\"; and to refuse was a grave offence. He took his  dish and spoon, and repaired to the scene of festivity. Each, as he  entered, greeted his host with the guttural ejaculation, Ho! and ranged  himself with the rest, squatted on the earthen floor or on the platform  along the sides of the house. The kettles were slung over the fires in  the midst. First, there was a long prelude of lugubrious singing. Then  the host, who took no share in the feast, proclaimed in a loud voice the  contents of each kettle in turn, and at each announcement the company  responded in unison, Ho! The attendant squaws filled with their ladles  the bowls of all the guests. There was talking, laughing, jesting,  singing, and smoking; and at times the entertainment was protracted  through the day.    [22] BrÃ©beuf, Relation des Hurons, 1636, 111.    When the feast had a medical or mystic character, it was indispensable  that each guest should devour the whole of the portion given him,  however enormous. Should he fail, the host would be outraged, the  community shocked, and the spirits roused to vengeance. Disaster would  befall the nation,--death, perhaps, the individual. In some cases, the  imagined efficacy of the feast was proportioned to the rapidity with  which the viands were despatched. Prizes of tobacco were offered to the  most rapid feeder; and the spectacle then became truly porcine. [23]  These festins Ã  manger tout were much dreaded by many of the Hurons,  who, however, were never known to decline them.    [23] This superstition was not confined to the Hurons, but extended to  many other tribes, including, probably, all the Algonquins, with some of  which it holds in full force to this day. A feaster, unable to do his  full part, might, if he could, hire another to aid him; otherwise, he  must remain in his place till the work was done.    Invitation to a dance was no less concise than to a feast. Sometimes a  crier proclaimed the approaching festivity through the village. The  house was crowded. Old men, old women, and children thronged the  platforms, or clung to the poles which supported the sides and roof.  Fires were raked out, and the earthen floor cleared. Two chiefs sang at  the top of their voices, keeping time to their song with tortoise-shell  rattles. [24] The men danced with great violence and gesticulation; the  women, with a much more measured action. The former were nearly divested  of clothing,--in mystical dances, sometimes wholly so; and, from a  superstitious motive, this was now and then the case with the women.  Both, however, were abundantly decorated with paint, oil, beads, wampum,  trinkets, and feathers.    [24] Sagard gives specimens of their songs. In both dances and feasts  there was no little variety. These were sometimes combined. It is  impossible, in brief space, to indicate more than their general  features. In the famous \"war-dance,\"--which was frequently danced, as it  still is, for amusement,--speeches, exhortations, jests, personal  satire, and repartee were commonly introduced as a part of the  performance, sometimes by way of patriotic stimulus, sometimes for  amusement. The music in this case was the drum and the war-song. Some of  the other dances were also interspersed with speeches and sharp  witticisms, always taken in good part, though Lafitau says that he has  seen the victim so pitilessly bantered that he was forced to hide his  head in his blanket.    Religious festivals, councils, the entertainment of an envoy, the  inauguration of a chief, were all occasions of festivity, in which  social pleasure was joined with matter of grave import, and which at  times gathered nearly all the nation into one great and harmonious  concourse. Warlike expeditions, too, were always preceded by feasting,  at which the warriors vaunted the fame of their ancestors, and their own  past and prospective exploits. A hideous scene of feasting followed the  torture of a prisoner. Like the torture itself, it was, among the  Hurons, partly an act of vengeance, and partly a religious rite. If the  victim had shown courage, the heart was first roasted, cut into small  pieces, and given to the young men and boys, who devoured it to increase  their own courage. The body was then divided, thrown into the kettles,  and eaten by the assembly, the head being the portion of the chief. Many  of the Hurons joined in the feast with reluctance and horror, while  others took pleasure in it. [25] This was the only form of cannibalism  among them, since, unlike the wandering Algonquins, they were rarely  under the desperation of extreme famine.    [25] \"Il y en a qui en mangent auec plaisir.\"--BrÃ©beuf, Relation des  Hurons, 1636, 121.--Le Mercier gives a description of one of these  scenes, at which he was present. (Ibid., 1637, 118.) The same horrible  practice prevailed to a greater extent among the Iroquois. One of the  most remarkable instances of Indian cannibalism is that furnished by a  Western tribe, the Miamis, among whom there was a clan, or family, whose  hereditary duty and privilege it was to devour the bodies of prisoners  burned to death. The act had somewhat of a religious character, was  attended with ceremonial observances, and was restricted to the family  in question.--See Hon. Lewis Cass, in the appendix to Colonel Whiting's  poem, \"Ontwa.\"    A great knowledge of simples for the cure of disease is popularly  ascribed to the Indian. Here, however, as elsewhere, his knowledge is in  fact scanty. He rarely reasons from cause to effect, or from effect to  cause. Disease, in his belief, is the result of sorcery, the agency of  spirits or supernatural influences, undefined and indefinable. The  Indian doctor was a conjurer, and his remedies were to the last degree  preposterous, ridiculous, or revolting. The well-known Indian  sweating-bath is the most prominent of the few means of cure based on  agencies simply physical; and this, with all the other natural remedies,  was applied, not by the professed doctor, but by the sufferer himself,  or his friends. [26]    [26] The Indians had many simple applications for wounds, said to have  been very efficacious; but the purity of their blood, owing to the  absence from their diet of condiments and stimulants, as well as to  their active habits, aided the remedy. In general, they were remarkably  exempt from disease or deformity, though often seriously injured by  alternations of hunger and excess. The Hurons sometimes died from the  effects of their festins Ã  manger tout.    The Indian doctor beat, shook, and pinched his patient, howled, whooped,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6934"],[0,"The Radio Amateur's Hand Book (#6)"],[1,"are had when it is connected to one end as shown at A in Fig.  4, in which case it is called an _inverted L aerial_, or when it is  connected to it at the middle as shown at B, when it is called a _T  aerial_. The leading-in wire must be carefully insulated from the  outside of the building and also where it passes through it to the  inside. This is done by means of an insulating tube known as a  _leading-in insulator_, or _bulkhead insulator_ as it is sometimes  called.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 4.--Inverted L Aerial.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 4.--T Aerial.]    As a protection against lightning burning out your instruments you can  use either: (1) an _air-gap lightning arrester,_ (2) a _vacuum tube  protector_, or (3) a _lightning switch_, which is better. Whichever  of these devices is used it is connected in between the aerial and an  outside ground wire so that a direct circuit to the earth will be  provided at all times except when you are sending or receiving. So  your aerial instead of being a menace really acts during an electrical  storm like a lightning rod and it is therefore a real protection. The  air-gap and vacuum tube lightning arresters are little devices that  can be used only where you are going to receive, while the lightning  switch must be used where you are going to send; indeed, in some  localities the _Fire Underwriters_ require a large lightning switch to  be used for receiving sets as well as sending sets.    How to Put Up a Cheap Receiving Aerial.--The kind of an aerial wire  system you put up will depend, chiefly, on two things, and these are:  (1) your pocketbook, and (2) the place where you live.    A Single Wire Aerial.--This is the simplest and cheapest kind of a  receiving aerial that can be put up. The first thing to do is to find  out the length of wire you need by measuring the span between the two  points of support; then add a sufficient length for the leading-in  wire and enough more to connect your receiving set with the radiator  or water pipe.    You can use any size of copper or aluminum wire that is not smaller  than _No. 16 Brown and Sharpe gauge._ When you buy the wire get also  the following material: (1) two _porcelain insulators_ as shown at A  in Fig. 5; (2) three or four _porcelain knob insulators_, see B; (3)  either (a) an _air gap lightning arrester,_ see C, or (b) a _lightning  switch_ see D; (4) a _leading-in porcelain tube insulator,_ see E, and  (5) a _ground clamp_, see F.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Material for a Simple Aerial Wire System.]    To make the aerial slip each end of the wire through a hole in each  insulator and twist it fast; next cut off and slip two more pieces of  wire through the other holes in the insulators and twist them fast and  then secure these to the supports at the ends of the building. Take  the piece you are going to use for the leading-in wire, twist it  around the aerial wire and solder it there when it will look like A in  Fig. 6. Now if you intend to use the _air gap lightning arrester_  fasten it to the wall of the building outside of your window, and  bring the leading-in wire from the aerial to the top binding post of  your arrester and keep it clear of everything as shown at B. If your  aerial is on the roof and you have to bring the leading-in wire over  the cornice or around a corner fix a porcelain knob insulator to the  one or the other and fasten the wire to it.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 6.--Single Wire Aerial for Receiving.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 6.--Receiving Aerial with Air Gap Lightning  Arrester.]    [Illustration: (C) Fig. 6.--Aerial with Lightning Switch.]    Next bore a hole through the frame of the window at a point nearest  your receiving set and push a porcelain tube 5/8 inch in diameter and  5 or 6 inches long, through it. Connect a length of wire to the top  post of the arrester or just above it to the wire, run this through  the leading-in insulator and connect it to the slider of your tuning  coil. Screw the end of a piece of heavy copper wire to the lower post  of the arrester and run it to the ground, on porcelain knobs if  necessary, and solder it to an iron rod or pipe which you have driven  into the earth. Finally connect the fixed terminal of your tuning coil  with the water pipe or radiator inside of the house by means of the  ground clamp as shown in the diagrammatic sketch at B in Fig. 6 and  you are ready to tune in.    If you want to use a lightning switch instead of the air-gap arrester  then fasten it to the outside wall instead of the latter and screw the  free end of the leading-in wire from the aerial to the middle post of  it as shown at C in Fig. 6. Run a wire from the top post through the  leading-in insulator and connect it with the slider of your tuning  coil. Next screw one end of a length of heavy copper wire to the lower  post of the aerial switch and run it to an iron pipe in the ground as  described above in connection with the spark-gap lightning arrester;  then connect the fixed terminal of your tuning coil with the radiator  or water pipe and your aerial wire system will be complete as shown at  C in Fig. 6.    A Two-wire Aerial.--An aerial with two wires will give better results  than a single wire and three wires are better than two, but you must  keep them well apart. To put up a two-wire aerial get (1) enough _No.  16_, or preferably _No. 14_, solid or stranded copper or aluminum  wire, (2) four porcelain insulators, see B in Fig. 5, and (3) two  sticks about 1 inch thick, 3 inches wide and 3 or 4 feet long, for the  _spreaders_, and bore 1/8-inch hole through each end of each one. Now  twist the ends of the wires to the insulators and then cut off four  pieces of wire about 6 feet long and run them through the holes in the  wood spreaders. Finally twist the ends of each pair of short wires to  the free ends of the insulators and then twist the free ends of the  wires together.    For the leading-in wire that goes to the lightning switch take two  lengths of wire and twist one end of each one around the aerial wires  and solder them there. Twist the short wire around the long wire and  solder this joint also when the aerial will look like Fig. 7. Bring  the free end of the leading-in wire down to the middle post of the  lightning switch and fasten it there and connect up the receiver to it  and the ground as described under the caption of _A Single Wire  Aerial_.    [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Two Wire Aerial.]    Connecting in the Ground.--If there is a gas or water system or a  steam-heating plant in your house you can make your ground connection  by clamping a ground clamp to the nearest pipe as has been previously  described. Connect a length of bare or insulated copper wire with it  and bring this up to the table on which you have your receiving set.  If there are no grounded pipes available then you will have to make a  good ground which we shall describe presently and lead the ground wire  from your receiving set out of the window and down to it.    How to Put Up a Good Aerial.--While you can use the cheap aerial  already described for a small spark-coil sending set you should have a  better insulated one for a 1/2 or a 1 kilowatt transformer set. The  cost for the materials for a good aerial is small and when properly  made and well insulated it will give results that are all out of  proportion to the cost of it.    An Inexpensive Good Aerial.--A far better aerial, because it is more  highly insulated, can be made by using _midget insulators_ instead of  the porcelain insulators described under the caption of _A Single Wire  Aerial_ and using a small _electrose leading-in insulator_ instead of  the porcelain bushing. This makes a good sending aerial for small sets  as well as a good receiving aerial.    The Best Aerial that Can Be Made.--To make this aerial get the  following material together: (1) enough _stranded or braided wire_ for  three or four lengths of parallel wires, according to the number you  want to use (2) six or eight _electrose ball insulators_, see B, Fig.  8; (3) two 5-inch or 10-inch _electrose strain insulators_, see C; (4)  six or eight _S-hooks_, see D; one large _withe_ with one eye for  middle of end spreader, see E; (6) two smaller _withes_ with one eye  each for end spreader, see E; (7) two still smaller _withes_, with two  eyes each for the ends of the end spreaders, see E (8) two _thimbles_,  see F, for 1/4-inch wire cable; (9) six or eight _hard rubber tubes_  or _bushings_ as shown at G; and (10) two _end spreaders_, see H; one  _middle spreader_, see I; and one _leading-in spreader_, see J.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 8--Part of a Good Aerial.]    [Illustration: (B) Fig. 8.--The Spreaders.]    For this aerial any one of a number of kinds of wire can be used and  among these are (a) _stranded copper wire;_ (b) _braided copper wire;_  (c) _stranded silicon bronze wire,_ and (d) _stranded phosphor bronze  wire_. Stranded and braided copper wire is very flexible as it is  formed of seven strands of fine wire twisted or braided together and  it is very good for short and light aerials. Silicon bronze wire is  stronger than copper wire and should be used where aerials are more  than 100 feet long, while phosphor bronze wire is the strongest aerial  wire made and is used for high grade aerials by the commercial  companies and the Government for their high-power stations.    The spreaders should be made of spruce, and should be 4 feet 10 inches  long for a three-wire aerial and 7 feet 1 inch long for a four-wire  aerial as the distance between the wires should be about 27 inches.  The end spreaders can be turned cylindrically but it makes a better  looking job if they taper from the middle to the ends. They should be  2-1/4 inches in diameter at the middle and 1-3/4 inches at the ends.  The middle spreader can be cylindrical and 2 inches in diameter. It  must have holes bored through it at equidistant points for the hard  "]]]
