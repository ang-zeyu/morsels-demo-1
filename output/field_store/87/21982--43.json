[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11440"],[0,"Tales of Three Hemispheres (#7)"],[1," a  trading bark named the _Bird of the River_ and returning safe to  Ireland, set down in a tale that is called _Idle Days on the Yann_,  the wonders of that voyage.  Now the tale being one of marvellous  beauty, found its way into a volume we call _A Dreamer's Tales_ where  it may be found to this day with other wondrous tales of that same  poet.    As the days went by the lure of the river and pleasant memories of his  shipmates bore in with a constant urge on the soul of the poet that he  might once more journey Beyond the Fields We Know and come to the  floor of Yann; and one day it fell out that turning into Go-by Street  that leads up from the Embankment toward the Strand and which you and  I always do go by and perhaps never see in passing, he found the door  which one enters on the way to the Land of Dream.    Twice of late has Lord Dunsany entered that door in Go-by Street and  returned to the Valley of the Yann and each time come back with a  tale; one, of his search for the _Bird of the River,_ the other of the  mighty hunter who avenged the destruction of Perdondaris, where on his  earlier voyage the captain tied up his ship and traded within the  city.  That all may be clear to those who read these new tales and to  whom no report has previously come Beyond the Fields We Know the  publishers reprint in this volume _Idle Days on the Yann_.          IDLE DAYS ON THE YANN    So I came down through the wood to the bank of Yann and found, as had  been prophesied, the ship _Bird of the River_ about to loose her  cable.    The captain sate cross-legged upon the white deck with his scimitar  lying beside him in its jewelled scabbard, and the sailors toiled to  spread the nimble sails to bring the ship into the central stream of  Yann, and all the while sang ancient soothing songs. And the wind of  the evening descending cool from the snowfields of some mountainous  abode of distant gods came suddenly, like glad tidings to an anxious  city, into the wing-like sails.    And so we came into the central stream, whereat the sailors lowered  the greater sails. But I had gone to bow before the captain, and to  inquire concerning the miracles, and appearances among men, of the  most holy gods of whatever land he had come from. And the captain  answered that he came from fair Belzoond, and worshipped gods that  were the least and humblest, who seldom sent the famine or the  thunder, and were easily appeased with little battles. And I told how  I came from Ireland, which is of Europe, whereat the captain and all  the sailors laughed, for they said, \"There are no such places in all  the land of dreams.\" When they had ceased to mock me, I explained that  my fancy mostly dwelt in the desert of Cuppar-Nombo, about a beautiful  city called Golthoth the Damned, which was sentinelled all round by  wolves and their shadows, and had been utterly desolate for years and  years, because of a curse which the gods once spoke in anger and could  never since recall. And sometimes my dreams took me as far as Pungar  Vees, the red walled city where the fountains are, which trades with  the Isles and Thul. When I said this they complimented me upon the  abode of my fancy, saying that, though they had never seen these  cities, such places might well be imagined. For the rest of that  evening I bargained with the captain over the sum that I should pay  him for my fare if God and the tide of Yann should bring us safely as  far as the cliffs by the sea, which are named Bar-Wul-Yann, the Gate  of Yann.    And now the sun had set, and all the colours of the world and heaven  had held a festival with him, and slipped one by one away before the  imminent approach of night. The parrots had all flown home to the  jungle on either bank, the monkeys in rows in safety on high branches  of the trees were silent and asleep, the fireflies in the deeps of the  forest were going up and down, and the great stars came gleaming out  to look on the face of Yann. Then the sailors lighted lanterns and  hung them round the ship, and the light flashed out on a sudden and  dazzled Yann, and the ducks that fed along his marshy banks all  suddenly arose, and made wide circles in the upper air, and saw the  distant reaches of the Yann and the white mist that softly cloaked the  jungle, before they returned again into their marshes.    And then the sailors knelt on the decks and prayed, not all together,  but five or six at a time. Side by side there kneeled down together  five or six, for there only prayed at the same time men of different  faiths, so that no god should hear two men praying to him at once. As  soon as any one had finished his prayer, another of the same faith  would take his place. Thus knelt the row of five or six with bended  heads under the fluttering sail, while the central stream of the River  Yann took them on towards the sea, and their prayers rose up from  among the lanterns and went towards the stars. And behind them in the  after end of the ship the helmsman prayed aloud the helmsman's prayer,  which is prayed by all who follow his trade upon the River Yann, of  whatever faith they be. And the captain prayed to his little lesser  gods, to the gods that bless Belzoond.    And I too felt that I would pray. Yet I liked not to pray to a jealous  God there where the frail affectionate gods whom the heathen love were  being humbly invoked; so I bethought me, instead, of Sheol Nugganoth,  whom the men of the jungle have long since deserted, who is now  unworshipped and alone; and to him I prayed.    And upon us praying the night came suddenly down, as it comes upon all  men who pray at evening and upon all men who do not; yet our prayers  comforted our own souls when we thought of the Great Night to come.    And so Yann bore us magnificently onwards, for he was elated with  molten snow that the Poltiades had brought him from the Hills of Hap,  and the Marn and Migris were swollen full with floods; and he bore us  in his might past Kyph and Pir, and we saw the lights of Goolunza.    Soon we all slept except the helmsman, who kept the ship in the  midstream of Yann.    When the sun rose the helmsman ceased to sing, for by song he cheered  himself in the lonely night. When the song ceased we suddenly all  awoke, and another took the helm, and the helmsman slept.    We knew that soon we should come to Mandaroon. We made a meal, and  Mandaroon appeared. Then the captain commanded, and the sailors loosed  again the greater sails, and the ship turned and left the stream of  Yann and came into a harbour beneath the ruddy walls of Mandaroon.  Then while the sailors went and gathered fruits I came alone to the  gate of Mandaroon. A few huts were outside it, in which lived the  guard. A sentinel with a long white beard was standing in the gate,  armed with a rusty pike. He wore large spectacles, which were covered  with dust. Through the gate I saw the city. A deathly stillness was  over all of it. The ways seemed untrodden, and moss was thick on  doorsteps; in the market-place huddled figures lay asleep. A scent of  incense and burned poppies, and there was a hum of the echoes of  distant bells. I said to the sentinel in the tongue of the region of  Yann, \"Why are they all asleep in this still city?\"    He answered: \"None may ask questions in this gate for fear they wake  the people of the city. For when the people of this city wake the gods  will die. And when the gods die men may dream no more.\" And I began to  ask him what gods that city worshipped, but he lifted his pike because  none might ask questions there. So I left him and went back to the  _Bird of the River_.    Certainly Mandaroon was beautiful with her white pinnacles peering  over her ruddy walls and the green of her copper roofs.    When I came back again to the _Bird of the River_, I found the sailors  were returned to the ship. Soon we weighed anchor, and sailed out  again, and so came once more to the middle of the river. And now the  sun was moving towards his heights, and there had reached us on the  River Yann the song of those countless myriads of choirs that attend  him in his progress round the world. For the little creatures that  have many legs had spread their gauze wings easily on the air, as a  man rests his elbows on a balcony and gave jubilant, ceremonial  praises to the sun, or else they moved together on the air in wavering  dances intricate and swift, or turned aside to avoid the onrush of  some drop of water that a breeze had shaken from a jungle orchid,  chilling the air and driving it before it, as it fell whirring in its  rush to the earth; but all the while they sang triumphantly. \"For the  day is for us,\" they said, \"whether our great and sacred father the  Sun shall bring up more life like us from the marshes, or whether all  the world shall end to-night.\" And there sang all those whose notes  are known to human ears, as well as those whose far more numerous  notes have never been heard by man.    To these a rainy day had been as an era of war that should desolate  continents during all the lifetime of a man.    And there came out also from the dark and steaming jungle to behold  and rejoice in the Sun the huge and lazy butterflies. And they danced,  but danced idly, on the ways of the air, as some haughty queen of  distant conquered lands might in her poverty and exile dance, in some  encampment of the gipsies, for the mere bread to live by, but beyond  that would never abate her pride to dance for a fragment more.    And the butterflies sung of strange and painted things, of purple  orchids and of lost pink cities and the monstrous colours of the  jungle's decay. And they, too, were among those whose voices are not  discernible by human ears. And as they floated above the river, going  from forest to forest, their splendour was matched by the inimical  beauty of the birds who darted out to pursue them.

Why  did Providence make children? and why does not some wise Draconic law  banish them for ever to the nursery?    The general merit of nick-nacks is unquestioned.

But then perfection is their only merit; and a crack or a  flaw destroys all the pleasure of a sensible beholder.

No. 81, of this truly excellent work had not reached us in time for the  close reading which it demands, and our \"Notes\" from it at present are  consequently few. The first in the number is a powerful paper on Dr.  Southey's _Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society_--\"a  beautiful book,\" says the reviewer, \"full of wisdom and devotion--of  poetry and feeling; conceived altogether in the spirit of other times,  such as the wise men of our own day may scoff at, but such as Evelyn, or  Isaak Walton, or Herbert would have delighted to honour.\" The work is in  general too polemical and political for our pages; but we may hereafter  be tempted to carve out a few pastoral pictures of the delightful  country round Keswick, where Dr. Southey resides. The present Review  contains but few extracts to our purpose, and is rather a paper on the  spirit of the _Colloquies_, than analytical of their merits. We take,  for example, the following admirable passage on the progress of  religious indifference; in which we break off somewhat hastily,  premising that the reader will be induced to turn to the Review itself  for the remainder of the article:--    There was a time, since the worship of images, (and happy would it have  been if the religious habits of the country had thenceforth stood  fixed,) when appropriate texts adorned the walls of the dwelling-rooms,  and children received at night a father's blessing;--and \"let us worship  God\" was said with solemn air, by the head of the household; and  churches were resorted to daily; and \"the parson in journey\" gave notice  for prayers in the hall of the inn--\"for prayers and provender,\" quoth  he, \"hinder no man;\" and the cheerful angler, as he sat under the  willow-tree, watching his quill, trolled out a Christian catch. \"Here we  may sit and pray, before death stops our breath;\" and the merchant (like  the excellent Sutton, of the Charter House) thought how he could make  his merchandize subservient to the good of his fellow-citizens and the  glory of his God, and accordingly endowed some charitable, and learned,  and religious foundation, worthy of the munificence of a crowned head;  and the grave historian (Lord Clarendon himself does so) chose a text in  his Bible as a motto for his chapter on politics; and religion, in  short, reached unto every place, and, like Elisha stretched on the dead  child, (to use one of Jeremy Taylor's characteristic illustrations),  gave life and animation to every part of the body politic. But years  rolled on; and the original impulse given at the Reformation, and  augmented at the Rebellion, to undervalue all outward forms, has  silently continued to prevail, till, with the form of godliness, (much  of it, up doubt, objectionable, but much of it wholesome), the power in  a considerable degree expired too.    Accordingly, our churches are now closed in the week-days, for we are  too busy to repair to them; our politicians crying out, with Pharaoh,  \"Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore would ye go and do sacrifice to the  Lord.\" Our cathedrals, it is true, are still open; but where are the  worshippers? Instead of entering in, the citizen avails himself of the  excellent clock which is usually attached to them, sets his watch, and  hastens upon 'Change, where the congregation is numerous and punctual,  and where the theological speculations are apt to run in Shylock's vein  pretty exclusively. If a church will answer, then, indeed, a joint-stock  company springs up; and a church is raised with as much alacrity, and  upon the same principles, as a play-house. The day when the people  brought their gifts is gone by. The \"_solid temples_,\" that heretofore  were built as if not to be dissolved till doomsday, have been succeeded  by thin emaciated structures, bloated out by coats of flatulent plaster,  and supported upon cast-metal pegs, which the courtesy of the times  calls pillars of the church. The painted windows, that admitted a dim  religious light, have given place to the cheap house-pane and dapper  green curtain. The front, with its florid reliefs and capacious crater,  has dwindled into a miserable basin.           *       *       *       *       *      AN ARTIST'S FAME.        _Painter._ Let none call happy one whose art's deep source    They know not--or what thorny paths he trode    To reach its dazzling goal!    _Marquis._                 What dost thou mean?    _Painter._ I'll seek a simile--Some gorgeous cloud    Oft towers in wondrous majesty before ye--    It bathes its bosom in pure ether's flood,    Evening twines crowns of roses for its head,    And for its mantle weaves a fringe of gold;    Ye gaze on it admiring and enchanted--    Yet know not whence its airy structure rose!

Thomson:--\"Two lovers were loitering on the margin  of a lake on a fine summer's evening, when the maiden espied some of the  flowers of Myosotis growing on the water, close to the bank of an  island, at some distance from the shore. She expressed a desire to  possess them, when the knight, in the true spirit of chivalry, plunged  into the water, and swimming to the spot, cropped the wished for plant,  but his strength was unable to fulfill the object of his achievement,  and feeling that he could not regain the shore, although very near it,  he threw the flowers upon the bank, and casting a last affectionate look  upon his lady-love, he cried 'Forget me not!' and was buried in the  waters.\"--_Gardener's Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      HOME.        _Leonhard._ See here what spacious halls: how all around    Us breathes magnificence!      _Spinarosa._              A princely pile!
