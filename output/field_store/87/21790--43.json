As well set traps  along our public streets, or worse than that.\"      CHAPTER X.    \"That, then, was the way in which I was captured. I was in love, as  it is called; not only did she appear to me a perfect being, but I  considered myself a white blackbird. It is a commonplace fact that there  is no one so low in the world that he cannot find some one viler than  himself, and consequently puff with pride and self-contentment. I was in  that situation. I did not marry for money. Interest was foreign to the  affair, unlike the marriages of most of my acquaintances, who married  either for money or for relations. First, I was rich, she was poor.  Second, I was especially proud of the fact that, while others married  with an intention of continuing their polygamic life as bachelors, it  was my firm intention to live monogamically after my engagement and the  wedding, and my pride swelled immeasurably.    \"Yes, I was a wretch, convinced that I was an angel. The period of  my engagement did not last long. I cannot remember those days without  shame. What an abomination!    \"It is generally agreed that love is a moral sentiment, a community of  thought rather than of sense. If that is the case, this community of  thought ought to find expression in words and conversation. Nothing of  the sort. It was extremely difficult for us to talk with each other.  What a toil of Sisyphus was our conversation! Scarcely had we thought of  something to say, and said it, when we had to resume our silence and try  to discover new subjects. Literally, we did not know what to say to each  other. All that we could think of concerning the life that was before us  and our home was said.    \"And then what? If we had been animals, we should have known that we had  not to talk. But here, on the contrary, it was necessary to talk, and  there were no resources! For that which occupied our minds was not a  thing to be expressed in words.    \"And then that silly custom of eating bon-bons, that brutal gluttony  for sweetmeats, those abominable preparations for the wedding, those  discussions with mamma upon the apartments, upon the sleeping-rooms,  upon the bedding, upon the morning-gowns, upon the wrappers, the linen,  the costumes! Understand that if people married according to the old  fashion, as this old man said just now, then these eiderdown coverlets  and this bedding would all be sacred details; but with us, out of ten  married people there is scarcely to be found one who, I do not say  believes in sacraments (whether he believes or not is a matter of  indifference to us), but believes in what he promises. Out of a hundred  men, there is scarcely one who has not married before, and out of fifty  scarcely one who has not made up his mind to deceive his wife.    \"The great majority look upon this journey to the church as a condition  necessary to the possession of a certain woman. Think then of the  supreme significance which material details must take on. Is it not a  sort of sale, in which a maiden is given over to a debauche, the sale  being surrounded with the most agreeable details?\"      CHAPTER XI.    \"All marry in this way. And I did like the rest. If the young people who  dream of the honeymoon only knew what a disillusion it is, and always a  disillusion! I really do not know why all think it necessary to conceal  it.    \"One day I was walking among the shows in Paris, when, attracted by a  sign, I entered an establishment to see a bearded woman and a water-dog.  The woman was a man in disguise, and the dog was an ordinary dog,  covered with a sealskin, and swimming in a bath. It was not in the least  interesting, but the Barnum accompanied me to the exit very courteously,  and, in addressing the people who were coming in, made an appeal to my  testimony. 'Ask the gentleman if it is not worth seeing! Come in, come  in! It only costs a franc!' And in my confusion I did not dare to answer  that there was nothing curious to be seen, and it was upon my false  shame that the Barnum must have counted.    \"It must be the same with the persons who have passed through the  abominations of the honeymoon. They do not dare to undeceive their  neighbor. And I did the same.    \"The felicities of the honeymoon do not exist. On the contrary, it is a  period of uneasiness, of shame, of pity, and, above all, of ennui,--of  ferocious ennui. It is something like the feeling of a youth when he is  beginning to smoke. He desires to vomit; he drivels, and swallows his  drivel, pretending to enjoy this little amusement. The vice of marriage  . . .\"    \"What! Vice?\" I said. \"But you are talking of one of the most natural  things.\"    \"Natural!\" said he. \"Natural! No, I consider on the contrary that it  is against nature, and it is I, a perverted man, who have reached this  conviction. What would it be, then, if I had not known corruption? To  a young girl, to every unperverted young girl, it is an act extremely  unnatural, just as it is to children. My sister married, when very  young, a man twice her own age, and who was utterly corrupt. I remember  how astonished we were the night of her wedding, when, pale and covered  with tears, she fled from her husband, her whole body trembling, saying  that for nothing in the world would she tell what he wanted of her.    \"You say natural? It is natural to eat; that is a pleasant, agreeable  function, which no one is ashamed to perform from the time of his birth.  No, it is not natural. A pure young girl wants one thing,--children.  Children, yes, not a lover.\" . . .    \"But,\" said I, with astonishment, \"how would the human race continue?\"    \"But what is the use of its continuing?\" he rejoined, vehemently.    \"What! What is the use? But then we should not exist.\"    \"And why is it necessary that we should exist?\"    \"Why, to live, to be sure.\"    \"And why live? The Schopenhauers, the Hartmanns, and all the Buddhists,  say that the greatest happiness is Nirvana, Non-Life; and they are right  in this sense,--that human happiness is coincident with the annihilation  of 'Self.' Only they do not express themselves well. They say that  Humanity should annihilate itself to avoid its sufferings, that its  object should be to destroy itself. Now the object of Humanity cannot  be to avoid sufferings by annihilation, since suffering is the result  of activity. The object of activity cannot consist in suppressing its  consequences. The object of Man, as of Humanity, is happiness, and, to  attain it, Humanity has a law which it must carry out. This law consists  in the union of beings. This union is thwarted by the passions. And  that is why, if the passions disappear, the union will be accomplished.  Humanity then will have carried out the law, and will have no further  reason to exist.\"    \"And before Humanity carries out the law?\"    \"In the meantime it will have the sign of the unfulfilled law, and  the existence of physical love. As long as this love shall exist, and  because of it, generations will be born, one of which will finally  fulfil the law. When at last the law shall be fulfilled, the Human Race  will be annihilated. At least it is impossible for us to conceive of  Life in the perfect union of people.\"      CHAPTER XII.    \"Strange theory!\" cried I.    \"Strange in what? According to all the doctrines of the Church, the  world will have an end. Science teaches the same fatal conclusions.  Why, then, is it strange that the same thing should result from moral  Doctrine? 'Let those who can, contain,' said Christ. And I take this  passage literally, as it is written. That morality may exist between  people in their worldly relations, they must make complete chastity  their object. In tending toward this end, man humiliates himself. When  he shall reach the last degree of humiliation, we shall have moral  marriage.    \"But if man, as in our society, tends only toward physical love, though  he may clothe it with pretexts and the false forms of marriage, he will  have only permissible debauchery, he will know only the same immoral  life in which I fell and caused my wife to fall, a life which we call  the honest life of the family. Think what a perversion of ideas must  arise when the happiest situation of man, liberty, chastity, is looked  upon as something wretched and ridiculous. The highest ideal, the best  situation of woman, to be pure, to be a vestal, a virgin, excites fear  and laughter in our society. How many, how many young girls sacrifice  their purity to this Moloch of opinion by marrying rascals that they  may not remain virgins,--that is, superiors! Through fear of finding  themselves in that ideal state, they ruin themselves.    \"But I did not understand formerly, I did not understand that the words  of the Gospel, that 'he who looks upon a woman to lust after her has  already committed adultery,' do not apply to the wives of others, but  notably and especially to our own wives. I did not understand this, and  I thought that the honeymoon and all of my acts during that period  were virtuous, and that to satisfy one's desires with his wife is an  eminently chaste thing. Know, then, that I consider these departures,  these isolations, which young married couples arrange with the  permission of their parents, as nothing else than a license to engage in  debauchery.    \"I saw, then, in this nothing bad or shameful, and, hoping for great  joys, I began to live the honeymoon. And very certainly none of these  joys followed. But I had faith, and was determined to have them,  cost what they might. But the more I tried to secure them, the less  I succeeded. All this time I felt anxious, ashamed, and weary. Soon I  began to suffer. I believe that on the third or fourth day I found my  wife sad and asked her the reason.

That which is now to be  expropriated is no longer the laborer working for himself,  but the capitalist exploiting many laborers. This  expropriation is accomplished by the action of the immanent  laws of capitalistic production itself, by the  centralization of capital. One capitalist always kills  many, and in hand with this centralization, or this  expropriation of many capitalists by few, develop, on  an ever extending scale, the co-operative form of the  labor-process, the conscious technical application of  science, the methodical cultivation of the soil, the  transformation of the instruments of labor into instruments  of labor only usable in common, the economizing of all  means of production by their use as the means of production  of combined, socialized labor, the entanglement  of all peoples in the net of the world-market, and with  this, the international character of the capitalistic regime.  Along with the constantly diminishing number of the  magnates of capital, who usurp and monopolize all  advantages of this process of transformation, grows the  mass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, exploitation;  but with this, too, grows the revolt of the working-  class, a class always increasing in numbers, and disciplined,  united, organized by the very mechanism of the  process of capitalist production itself. The monopoly of  capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production,  which has sprung up and flourished along with, and  under it. Centralization of the means of production and  socialization of labor at last reach a point where they  become incompatible with their capitalist integument.  This integument is burst asunder. The knell of capitalist  private property sounds. The expropriators are  expropriated,[8]      [8] Vol. i pp. 788, 789.      That is all. Hardly another word from beginning  to end is allowed to relieve the gloom, and in this  relentless pressure upon the mind of the reader lies  a great part of the power which this book has  acquired.    Two questions are raised by Marx's work: First,  Are his laws of historical development true? Second,  Is Socialism desirable? The second of these questions  is quite independent of the first. Marx professes  to prove that Socialism must come, but scarcely concerns  himself to argue that when it comes it will be  a good thing. It may be, however, that if it comes,  it will be a good thing, even though all Marx's arguments  to prove that it must come should be at fault.  In actual fact, time has shown many flaws in Marx's  theories. The development of the world has been  sufficiently like his prophecy to prove him a man of  very unusual penetration, but has not been sufficiently  like to make either political or economic history  exactly such as he predicted that it would be.  Nationalism, so far from diminishing, has increased,  and has failed to be conquered by the cosmopolitan  tendencies which Marx rightly discerned in finance.  Although big businesses have grown bigger and have  over a great area reached the stage of monopoly,  yet the number of shareholders in such enterprises  is so large that the actual number of individuals  interested in the capitalist system has continually  increased. Moreover, though large firms have grown  larger, there has been a simultaneous increase in  firms of medium size. Meanwhile the wage-earners,  who were, according to Marx, to have remained at  the bare level of subsistence at which they were in  the England of the first half of the nineteenth century,  have instead profited by the general increase  of wealth, though in a lesser degree than the capitalists.  The supposed iron law of wages has been  proved untrue, so far as labor in civilized countries  is concerned. If we wish now to find examples of  capitalist cruelty analogous to those with which  Marx's book is filled, we shall have to go for most  of our material to the Tropics, or at any rate to  regions where there are men of inferior races to  exploit. Again: the skilled worker of the present day  is an aristocrat in the world of labor. It is a question  with him whether he shall ally himself with the  unskilled worker against the capitalist, or with the  capitalist against the unskilled worker. Very often  he is himself a capitalist in a small way, and if he  is not so individually, his trade union or his friendly  society is pretty sure to be so. Hence the sharpness  of the class war has not been maintained. There  are gradations, intermediate ranks between rich and  poor, instead of the clear-cut logical antithesis  between the workers who have nothing and the capitalists  who have all. Even in Germany, which  became the home of orthodox Marxianism and developed  a powerful Social-Democratic party, nominally  accepting the doctrine of ``Das Kapital'' as all but  verbally inspired, even there the enormous increase  of wealth in all classes in the years preceding the  war led Socialists to revise their beliefs and to adopt  an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary attitude.  Bernstein, a German Socialist who lived long in  England, inaugurated the ``Revisionist'' movement  which at last conquered the bulk of the party. His  criticisms of Marxian orthodoxy are set forth in  his ``Evolutionary Socialism.''[9] Bernstein's work,  as is common in Broad Church writers, consists  largely in showing that the Founders did not hold  their doctrines so rigidly as their followers have  done. There is much in the writings of Marx and  Engels that cannot be fitted into the rigid orthodoxy  which grew up among their disciples. Bernstein's  main criticisms of these disciples, apart from such as  we have already mentioned, consist in a defense of  piecemeal action as against revolution. He protests  against the attitude of undue hostility to Liberalism  which is common among Socialists, and he blunts the  edge of the Internationalism which undoubtedly is  part of the teachings of Marx. The workers, he  says, have a Fatherland as soon as they become  citizens, and on this basis he defends that degree of  nationalism which the war has since shown to be  prevalent in the ranks of Socialists. He even goes  so far as to maintain that European nations have a  right to tropical territory owing to their higher  civilization. Such doctrines diminish revolutionary  ardor and tend to transform Socialists into a left  wing of the Liberal Party. But the increasing prosperity  of wage-earners before the war made these  developments inevitable. Whether the war will have  altered conditions in this respect, it is as yet  impossible to know. Bernstein concludes with the wise  remark that: ``We have to take working men as they  are. And they are neither so universally paupers as  was set out in the Communist Manifesto, nor so free  from prejudices and weaknesses as their courtiers  wish to make us believe.''      [9] Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben  der Sozial-Demokratie.''    In March, 1914, Bernstein delivered a lecture in Budapest  in which he withdrew from several of the positions he had taken  up (vide Budapest ``Volkstimme,'' March 19, 1914).      Berstein represents the decay of Marxian orthodoxy  from within. Syndicalism represents an attack  against it from without, from the standpoint of a  doctrine which professes to be even more radical and  more revolutionary than that of Marx and Engels.  The attitude of Syndicalists to Marx may be seen in  Sorel's little book, ``La Decomposition du Marxisme,''  and in his larger work, ``Reflections on  Violence,'' authorized translation by T. E. Hulme  (Allen & Unwin, 1915). After quoting Bernstein,  with approval in so far as he criticises Marx, Sorel  proceeds to other criticisms of a different order. He  points out (what is true) that Marx's theoretical  economics remain very near to Manchesterism: the  orthodox political economy of his youth was accepted  by him on many points on which it is now known to  be wrong. According to Sorel, the really essential  thing in Marx's teaching is the class war. Whoever  keeps this alive is keeping alive the spirit of Socialism  much more truly than those who adhere to the  letter of Social-Democratic orthodoxy. On the basis  of the class war, French Syndicalists developed a  criticism of Marx which goes much deeper than those  that we have been hitherto considering. Marx's  views on historical development may have been in a  greater or less degree mistaken in fact, and yet the  economic and political system which he sought to  create might be just as desirable as his followers  suppose. Syndicalism, however, criticises, not only  Marx's views of fact, but also the goal at which he  aims and the general nature of the means which he  recommends. Marx's ideas were formed at a time  when democracy did not yet exist. It was in the  very year in which ``Das Kapital'' appeared that  urban working men first got the vote in England and  universal suffrage was granted by Bismarck in  Northern Germany. It was natural that great hopes  should be entertained as to what democracy would  achieve. Marx, like the orthodox economists,  imagined that men's opinions are guided by a more  or less enlightened view of economic self-interest, or  rather of economic class interest. A long experience  of the workings of political democracy has shown  that in this respect Disraeli and Bismarck were  shrewder judges of human nature than either Liberals  or Socialists. It has become increasingly difficult  to put trust in the State as a means to liberty,  or in political parties as instruments sufficiently  powerful to force the State into the service of the  people. The modern State, says Sorel, ``is a body of  intellectuals, which is invested with privileges, and  which possesses means of the kind called"]]]
