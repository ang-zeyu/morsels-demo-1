[1] In England we frequently meet with the surname Pilling and Billing;  it might have happened, that a man had met with an English woman of that  name, and had married her, and, as is usual in brides, she might have  been, though married, called by her maiden name, and the appellation  might have been continued to her posterity.--_Authors Note_.    The name Billing and Belling is the family name of one of the oldest  Cornish (Keltic) families--a fact that suggests other possibilities.--P.  H. E.          THE LONG-LIVED ANCESTORS.    The Eagle of Gwernabwy had been long married to his female, and had by  her many children; she died, and he continued a long time a widower; but  at length be proposed a marriage with the Owl of Cwm Cwmlwyd; but afraid  of her being young, so as to have children by her, and thereby degrade  his own family, he first of all went to inquire about her age amongst  the aged of the world. Accordingly he applied to the Stag of Rhedynfre,  whom he found lying close to the trunk of an old oak, and requested to  know the Owl's age.    \"I have seen,\" said the Stag, \"this oak an acorn, which is now fallen  to the ground through age, without either bark or leaves, and never  suffered any hurt or strain except from my rubbing myself against it  once a day, after getting up on my legs; but I never remember to have  seen the Owl you mention younger or older than she seems to be at  this day. But there is one older than I am, and that is the Salmon of  Glynllifon.\"    The Eagle then applied to the Salmon for the age of the Owl. The Salmon  answered, \"I am as many years old as there are scales upon my skin, and  particles of spawn within my belly; yet never saw I the Owl you mention  but the same in appearance. But there is one older than I am, and that  is the Blackbird of Cilgwri.\"    The Eagle next repaired to the Blackbird of Cilgwri, whom he found  perched upon a small stone, and enquired of him the Owl's age.    \"Dost thou see this stone upon which I sit,\" said the Blackbird, \"which  is now no bigger than what a man can carry in his hand? I have seen this  very stone of such weight as to be a sufficient load for a hundred oxen  to draw, which has suffered neither rubbing nor wearing, save that I rub  my bill on it once every evening, and touch the tips of my wings on it  every morning, when I expand them to fly; yet I have not seen the Owl  either older or younger than she appears to be at this day. But there is  one older than I am, and that is the Frog of Mochno Bog, and if he does  not know her age, there is not a creature living that does know it.\"    The Eagle went last of all to the Frog and desired to know the Owl's  age. He answered, \"I never ate anything but the dust from the spot which  I inhabit, and that very sparingly, and dost thou see these great hills  that surround and overawe this bog where I lie? They are formed only  of the excrements from my body since I have inhabited this place, yet I  never remember to have seen the Owl but an old hag, making that  hideous noise, Too, hoo, hoo! always frightening the children in the  neighbourhood.\"    So the Eagle of Gwernabwy, the Stag of Rhedynfre, the Salmon of  Glynllifon, the Blackbird of Cilgwri, the Frog of Mochno Bog, and the  Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd are the oldest creatures in the whole world!          THE GIANTESS'S APRON-FULL.    A huge giant, in company with his wife, travelling towards the island of  Mona, with an intention of settling amongst the first inhabitants that  had removed there, and having been informed that there was but a narrow  channel which divided it from the continent, took up two large stones,  one under each arm, to carry with him as a preparatory for making a  bridge over this channel, and his lady had her apron filled with small  stones for the same purpose; but, meeting a man on this spot with a  large parcel of old shoes on his shoulders, the giant asked him how far  it was to Mona. The man replied, that it was so far, that he had worn  out those shoes in travelling from Mona to that place. The giant on  hearing this dropped down the stones, one on each side of him, where  they now stand upright, about a hundred yards or more distant from each  other; the space between them was occupied by this Goliah's body.  His mistress at the same time opened her apron, and dropped down the  contents of it, which formed this heap.          GWRGAN FARFDRWCH'S FABLE.    Hear me, O ye Britons! On the top of a high rock in Arvon there stood  a goat, which a lion perceiving from the valley below, addressed her in  this manner:--    \"My dearest neighbour, why preferrest thou that dry barren rock to  feed on? Come down to this charming valley, where thou mayest feed  luxuriously upon all sorts of dainties, amongst flowers in shady groves,  made fruitful by meandering brooks.\"    \"I am much obliged to you, master,\" replied the goat; \"perhaps you mean  well, and tell me the truth, but you have very bad neighbours, whom I  do not like to trust, and those are your teeth, so, with your leave, I  prefer staying where I am.\"          THE STORY OF THE PIG-TROUGH.    In the beginning of the century, Hughes went as military substitute for  a farmer's son. He got L80, a watch, and a suit of clothes. His mother  was loath to let him go, and when he joined his regiment, she followed  him from Amlych to Pwlheli to try and buy him off. He would not hear of  it. \"Mother,\" he said, \"the whole of Anglesey would not keep me, I want  to be off, and see the world.\"    The regiment was quartered in Edinboro', and Hughes married the daughter  of the burgess with whom he was billeted. Thence, leaving a small son,  as hostage to the grandparents, they went to Ireland, and Hughes and his  wife were billeted on a pork-butcher's family in Dublin. One day, the  mother of the pork-butcher, an old granny, told them she had seen the  fairies.    \"Last night, as I was abed, I saw a bright, bright light come in, and  afterwards a troop of little angels. They danced all over my bed, and  they played and sang music--oh! the sweetest music ever I heard. I lay  and watched them and listened. By-and-bye the light went out and the  music stopped, and I saw them no more. I regretted the music very much.  But directly after another smaller light appeared, and a tall dark man  came up to my bed, and with something in his hand he tapped me on the  temple; it felt like some one drawing a sharp pin across my temple then  he went too. In the morning my pillow was covered with blood. I thought  and thought, and then I knew I had moved the pig's trough and must have  put it in the fairies' path and the fairies were angered, and the king  of the fairies had punished me for it.\" She moved the trough back to its  old place the next day, and received no more visits from the wee folk.          BILLY DUFFY AND THE DEVIL.    Billy Duffy was an Irishman, a blacksmith, and a drunkard. He had the  Keltic aversion from steady work, and stuck to his forge only long  enough to get money for drink; when that was spent, he returned to work.    Billy was coming home one day after one of these drinking-bouts, soberer  than usual, when he exclaimed to himself, for the thirst was upon him,  \"By God! I would sell myself to the devil if I could get some more  drink.\"    At that moment a tall gentleman in black stepped up to him, and said,  \"What did you say?\"    \"I said I would sell myself to the devil if I could get a drink.\"    \"Well, how much do you want for seven years, and the devil to get you  then?\"    \"Well, I can't tell exactly, when it comes to the push.\"    \"Will L700 do you?\"    \"Yes; I'd take L700.\"    \"And the devil to get you then?\"    \"Oh, yes; I don't care about that.\"    When Billy got home he found the money in his smithy. He at once shut  the smithy, and began squandering the money, keeping open house.    Amongst the people who flocked to get what they could out of Billy came  an old hermit, who said, \"I am very hungry, and nearly starved. Will you  give me something to eat and drink?\"    \"Oh, yes; come in and get what you like.\"    The hermit disappeared, after eating and drinking, and did not reappear  for several months, when he received the same kindly welcome, again  disappearing. A few months afterwards he again appeared.    \"Come in, come in!\" said Billy.    After he had eaten and drunk his full, the hermit said to Billy: \"Well,  three times have you been good and kind to me. I'll give you three  wishes, and whatever you wish will be sure to come true.\"    \"I must have time to consider,\" said Billy.    \"Oh, you shall have plenty of time to consider, and mind they are good  wishes.\"    Next morning Billy told the hermit he was ready. \"Well, go on; be sure  they're good wishes,\" said the hermit.    \"Well, I've got a big sledge-hammer in the smithy, and I wish whoever  gets hold of that hammer shall go on striking the anvil, and never break  it, till I tell him to stop.\"    \"Oh, that's a bad wish, Billy.\"    \"Oh, no; you'll see it's good. Next thing I wish for is a purse so that  no one can take out whatever I put into it.\"    \"Oh, Billy, Billy! that's a bad wish. Be careful now about the third  wish,\" said the hermit.    \"Well, I have got an armchair upstairs, and I wish that whoever may sit  in that armchair will never be able to get up till I let them.\"    \"Well, well, indeed; they are not very good wishes.\"    \"Oh, yes; I've got my senses about me. I think I'll make them good  wishes, after all.\"    The seven years, all but three days, had passed, and Billy was back  working at his forge, for all his money was gone, when the dark  gentleman stepped in and said:    \"Now, Billy, during these last three days you may have as much money as  you like,\" and he disappeared.    On the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8694"],[0,"The Abbot's Ghost, or Maurice Treherne's Temptation: A Christmas Story (#6)"],[1,"moment I learned that you did not get the note I was sure she had  it, and, knowing that she must have seen me put it there, in spite of  her apparent innocence, I quietly asked her for it. This surprised her,  this robbed the affair of any mystery, and I finished her perplexity by  sending it to the major the moment she returned it to me, as if it had  been intended for him. She begged pardon, said her brother was  thoughtless, and she watched over him lest he should get into mischief;  professed to think I meant the line for him, and behaved like a charming  simpleton, as she is.\"    \"Quite a tumult about nothing. Poor little Tavie! You doubtlessly  frightened her so that we may safely correspond hereafter.\"    \"You may give me an answer, now and here.\"    \"Very well, meet me on the terrace tomorrow morning; the peacocks will  make the meeting natural enough. I usually loiter away an hour or two  there, in the sunny part of the day.\"    \"But the girl?\"    \"I'll send her away.\"    \"You speak as if it would be an easy thing to do.\"    \"It will, both easy and pleasant.\"    \"Now you are mysterious or uncomplimentary. You either care nothing for  a tete-a-tete with her, or you will gladly send her out of my way.  Which is it?\"    \"You shall decide. Can I have this?\"    She looked at him as he touched a rose with a warning glance, for the  flower was both an emblem of love and of silence. Did he mean to hint  that he recalled the past, or to warn her that someone was near? She  leaned from the shadow of the curtain where she sat, and caught a  glimpse of a shadow gliding away.    \"Who was it?\" she asked, below her breath.    \"A Rose,\" he answered, laughing. Then, as if the danger was over, he  said, \"How will you account to the major for the message you sent him?\"    \"Easily, by fabricating some interesting perplexity in which I want sage  counsel. He will be flattered, and by seeming to take him into my  confidence, I can hoodwink the excellent man to my heart's content, for  he annoys me by his odd way of mounting guard over me at all times. Now  take me in to dinner, and be your former delightful self.\"    \"That is impossible,\" he said, yet proved that it was not.          Chapter IV      FEEDING THE PEACOCKS    It was indeed a charming sight, the twelve stately birds perched on the  broad stone balustrade, or prancing slowly along the terrace, with the  sun gleaming on their green and golden necks and the glories of their  gorgeous plumes, widespread, or sweeping like rich trains behind them.  In pretty contrast to the splendid creatures was their young mistress,  in her simple morning dress and fur-trimmed hood and mantle, as she  stood feeding the tame pets from her hand, calling their fanciful names,  laughing at their pranks, and heartily enjoying the winter sunshine, the  fresh wind, and the girlish pastime. As Treherne slowly approached, he  watched her with lover's eyes, and found her very sweet and blithe, and  dearer in his sight than ever. She had shunned him carefully all the day  before, had parted at night with a hasty handshake, and had not come as  usual to bid him good-morning in the library. He had taken no notice of  the change as yet, but now, remembering his promise to his aunt, he  resolved to let the girl know that he fully understood the relation  which henceforth was to exist between them.    \"Good-morning, cousin. Shall I drive you away, if I take a turn or two  here?\" he said, in a cheerful tone, but with a half-reproachful glance.    She looked at him an instant, then went to him with extended hand and  cheeks rosier than before, while her frank eyes filled, and her voice  had a traitorous tremor in it, as she said, impetuously: \"I _will_ be  myself for a moment, in spite of everything. Maurice, don't think me  unkind, don't reproach me, or ask my leave to come where I am. There is  a reason for the change you see in me; it's not caprice, it is  obedience.\"    \"My dear girl, I know it. I meant to speak of it, and show you that I  understand. Annon is a good fellow, as worthy of you as any man can be,  and I wish you all the happiness you deserve.\"    \"Do you?\" And her eyes searched his face keenly.    \"Yes; do you doubt it?\" And so well did he conceal his love, that  neither face, voice, nor manner betrayed a hint of it.    Her eyes fell, a cloud passed over her clear countenance, and she  withdrew her hand, as if to caress the hungry bird that gently pecked at  the basket she held. As if to change the conversation, she said  playfully, \"Poor Argus, you have lost your fine feathers, and so all  desert you, except kind little Juno, who never forgets her friends.  There, take it all, and share between you.\"    Treherne smiled, and said quickly, \"I am a human Argus, and you have  been a kind little Juno to me since I lost my plumes. Continue to be so,  and you will find me a very faithful friend.\"    \"I will.\" And as she answered, her old smile came back and her eyes met  his again.    \"Thanks! Now we shall get on happily. I don't ask or expect the old  life--that is impossible. I knew that when lovers came, the friend  would fall into the background; and I am content to be second, where I  have so long been first. Do not think you neglect me; be happy with  your lover, dear, and when you have no pleasanter amusement, come and  see old Maurice.\"    She turned her head away, that he might not see the angry color in her  cheeks, the trouble in her eyes, and when she spoke, it was to say  petulantly, \"I wish Jasper and Mamma would leave me in peace. I hate  lovers and want none. If Frank teases, I'll go into a convent and so be  rid of him.\"    Maurice laughed, and turned her face toward himself, saying, in his  persuasive voice, \"Give him a trial first, to please your mother. It can  do no harm and may amuse you. Frank is already lost, and, as you are  heart-whole, why not see what you can do for him? I shall have a new  study, then, and not miss you so much.\"    \"You are very kind; I'll do my best. I wish Mrs. Snowdon would come, if  she is coming; I've an engagement at two, and Frank will look tragical  if I'm not ready. He is teaching me billiards, and I really like the  game, though I never thought I should.\"    \"That looks well. I hope you'll learn a double lesson, and Annon find a  docile pupil in both.\"    \"You are very pale this morning; are you in pain, Maurice?\" suddenly  asked Octavia, dropping the tone of assumed ease and gaiety under which  she had tried to hide her trouble.    \"Yes, but it will soon pass. Mrs. Snowdon is coming. I saw her at the  hall door a moment ago. I will show her the peacocks, if you want to go.  She won't mind the change, I dare say, as you don't like her, and I do.\"    \"No, I am sure of that. It was an arrangement, perhaps? I understand. I  will not play Mademoiselle De Trop.\"    Sudden fire shone in the girl's eyes, sudden contempt curled her lip,  and a glance full of meaning went from her cousin to the door, where  Mrs. Snowdon appeared, waiting for her maid to bring her some additional  wrappings.    \"You allude to the note you stole. How came you to play that prank,  Tavie?\" asked Treherne tranquilly.    \"I saw her put it under the urn. I thought it was for Jasper, and I took  it,\" she said boldly.    \"Why for Jasper?\"    \"I remembered his speaking of meeting her long ago, and describing her  beauty enthusiastically--and so did you.\"    \"You have a good memory.\"    \"I have for everything concerning those I love. I observed her manner  of meeting my brother, his devotion to her, and, when they stood  laughing together before the fire, I felt sure that she wished to charm  him again.\"    \"Again? Then she did charm him once?\" asked Treherne, anxious to know  how much Jasper had told his sister.    \"He always denied it, and declared that you were the favorite.\"    \"Then why not think the note for me?\" he asked.    \"I do now\" was the sharp answer.    \"But she told you it was for the major, and sent it.\"    \"She deceived me; I am not surprised. I am glad Jasper is safe, and I  wish you a pleasant tete-a-tete.\"    Bowing with unwonted dignity, Octavia set down her basket, and walked  away in one direction as Mrs. Snowdon approached in another.    \"I have done it now,\" sighed Treherne, turning from the girlish figure  to watch the stately creature who came sweeping toward him with  noiseless grace.    Brilliancy and splendor became Mrs. Snowdon; she enjoyed luxury, and her  beauty made many things becoming which in a plainer woman would have  been out of taste, and absurd. She had wrapped herself in a genuine  Eastern burnous of scarlet, blue, and gold; the hood drawn over her head  framed her fine face in rich hues, and the great gilt tassels shone  against her rippling black hair. She wore it with grace, and the  barbaric splendor of the garment became her well. The fresh air touched  her cheeks with a delicate color; her usually gloomy eyes were brilliant  now, and the smile that parted her lips was full of happiness.    \"Welcome, Cleopatra!\" cried Treherne, with difficulty repressing a  laugh, as the peacocks screamed and fled before the rustling amplitude  of her drapery.    \"I might reply by calling you Thaddeus of Warsaw, for you look very  romantic and Polish with your pale, pensive face, and your splendid  furs,\" she answered, as she paused beside him with admiration very  visibly expressed in her eyes.    Treherne disliked the look, and rather abruptly said, as he offered her  the basket of bread, \"I have disposed of my cousin, and offered to do  the honors of the peacocks. Here they are--will you feed them?\"    \"No, thank you--I care nothing for the fowls, as you know; I came to  speak to you,\" she said impatiently.    \"I am at your service.\"    \"I wish to ask you a question or two--is it permitted?\"    \"What man ever refused Mrs. Snowdon a request?\"    \"Nay, no compliments; from you they are only satirical evasions. I was  deceived when"]]]
