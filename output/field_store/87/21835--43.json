At the mat where the  photographs were she stopped.  \"Look at this!\" she cried.  \"My  photographs really have been put in the wrong places.  Oh, that's  horrible.  Someone really has been in my room without permission.\"  K.  nodded, and quietly cursed Kaminer who worked at his bank and who was  always active doing things that had neither use nor purpose.  \"It is  odd,\" said Miss Buerstner, \"that I'm forced to forbid you to do something  that you ought to have forbidden yourself to do, namely to come into my  room when I'm not here.\"  \"But I did explain to you,\" said K., and went  over to join her by the photographs, \"that it wasn't me who interfered  with your photographs; but as you don't believe me I'll have to admit  that the investigating committee brought along three bank employees with  them, one of them must have touched your photographs and as soon as I  get the chance I'll ask to have him dismissed from the bank.  Yes, there  was an investigating committee here,\" added K., as the young lady was  looking at him enquiringly.  \"Because of you?\" she asked.  \"Yes,\"  answered K.  \"No!\" the lady cried with a laugh.  \"Yes, they were,\" said  K., \"you believe that I'm innocent then, do you?\"  \"Well now, innocent  ...\" said the lady, \"I don't want to start making any pronouncements  that might have serious consequences, I don't really know you after all,  it means they're dealing with a serious criminal if they send an  investigating committee straight out to get him.  But you're not in  custody now - at least I take it you've not escaped from prison  considering that you seem quite calm - so you can't have committed any  crime of that sort.\"  \"Yes,\" said K., \"but it might be that the  investigating committee could see that I'm innocent, or not so guilty as  had been supposed.\"  \"Yes, that's certainly a possibility,\" said Miss  Buerstner, who seemed very interested.  \"Listen,\" said K., \"you don't  have much experience in legal matters.\"  \"No, that's true, I don't,\"  said Miss Buerstner, \"and I've often regretted it, as I'd like to know  everything and I'm very interested in legal matters.  There's something  peculiarly attractive about the law, isn't there?  But I'll certainly be  perfecting my knowledge in this area, as next month I start work in a  legal office.\"  \"That's very good,\" said K., \"that means you'll be able  to give me some help with my trial.\"  \"That could well be,\" said Miss  Buerstner, \"why not?  I like to make use of what I know.\"  \"I mean it  quite seriously,\" said K., \"or at least, half seriously, as you do.  This affair is too petty to call in a lawyer, but I could make good use  of someone who could give me advice.\"  \"Yes, but if I'm to give you  advice I'll have to know what it's all about,\" said Miss Buerstner.  \"That's exactly the problem,\" said K., \"I don't know that myself.\"  \"So  you have been making fun of me, then,\" said Miss Buerstner exceedingly  disappointed, \"you really ought not to try something like that on at  this time of night.\"  And she stepped away from the photographs where  they had stood so long together.  \"Miss Buerstner, no,\" said K., \"I'm not  making fun of you.  Please believe me!  I've already told you everything  I know.  More than I know, in fact, as it actually wasn't even an  investigating committee, that's just what I called them because I don't  know what else to call them.  There was no cross questioning at all, I  was merely arrested, but by a committee.\"  Miss Buerstner sat on the  ottoman and laughed again.  \"What was it like then?\" she asked.  \"It was  terrible\" said K., although his mind was no longer on the subject, he  had become totally absorbed by Miss Buerstner's gaze who was supporting  her chin on one hand - the elbow rested on the cushion of the ottoman -  and slowly stroking her hip with the other.  \"That's too vague,\" said  Miss Buerstner.  \"What's too vague?\" asked K.  Then he remembered himself  and asked, \"Would you like me to show you what it was like?\"  He wanted  to move in some way but did not want to leave.  \"I'm already tired,\"  said Miss Buerstner.  \"You arrived back so late,\" said K.  \"Now you've  started telling me off.  Well I suppose I deserve it as I shouldn't have  let you in here in the first place, and it turns out there wasn't even  any point.\"  \"Oh, there was a point, you'll see now how important a  point it was,\" said K.  \"May I move this table away from your bedside  and put it here?\"  \"What do you think you're doing?\" said Miss Buerstner.  \"Of course you can't!\"  \"In that case I can't show you,\" said K., quite  upset, as if Miss Buerstner had committed some incomprehensible offence  against him.  \"Alright then, if you need it to show what you mean, just  take the bedside table then,\" said Miss Buerstner, and after a short  pause added in a weak voice,  \"I'm so tired I'm allowing more than I  ought to.\"  K. put the little table in the middle of the room and sat  down behind it.  \"You have to get a proper idea of where the people were  situated, it is very interesting.  I'm the supervisor, sitting over  there on the chest are two policemen, standing next to the photographs  there are three young people.  Hanging on the handle of the window is a  white blouse - I just mention that by the way.  And now it begins.  Ah  yes, I'm forgetting myself, the most important person of all, so I'm  standing here in front of the table.  The supervisor is sitting  extremely comfortably with his legs crossed and his arm hanging over the  backrest here like some layabout.  And now it really does begin.  The  supervisor calls out as if he had to wake me up, in fact he shouts at  me, I'm afraid, if I'm to make it clear to you, I'll have to shout as  well, and it's nothing more than my name that he shouts out.\"  Miss  Buerstner, laughing as she listened to him, laid her forefinger on her  mouth so that K. would not shout, but it was too late.  K. was too  engrossed in his role and slowly called out, \"Josef K.!\".  It was not as  loud as he had threatened, but nonetheless, once he had suddenly called  it out, the cry seemed gradually to spread itself all round the room.            There was a series of loud, curt and regular knocks at the door of  the adjoining room.  Miss Buerstner went pale and laid her hand on her  heart.  K. was especially startled, as for a moment he had been quite  unable to think of anything other than the events of that morning and  the girl for whom he was performing them.  He had hardly pulled himself  together when he jumped over to Miss Buerstner and took her hand.  \"Don't  be afraid,\" he whispered, \"I'll put everything right.  But who can it  be?  It's only the living room next door, nobody sleeps in there.\"  \"Yes  they do,\" whispered Miss Buerstner into K.'s ear, \"a nephew of Mrs.  Grubach's, an captain in the army, has been sleeping there since  yesterday.  There's no other room free.  I'd forgotten about it too.  Why did you have to shout like that?  You've made me quite upset.\"  \"There is no reason for it,\" said K., and, now as she sank back onto the  cushion, kissed her forehead.  \"Go away, go away,\" she said, hurriedly  sitting back up, \"get out of here, go, what is it you want, he's  listening at the door he can hear everything.  You're causing me so much  trouble!\"  \"I won't go,\" said K., \"until you've calmed down a bit.  Come  over into the other corner of the room, he won't be able to hear us  there.\"  She let him lead her there. \"Don't forget,\" he said, \"although  this might be unpleasant for you you're not in any real danger.  You  know how much esteem Mrs. Grubach has for  me, she's the one who will  make all the decisions in this, especially as the captain is her nephew,  but she believes everything I say without question.  What's more, she  has borrowed a large sum of money from me and that makes her dependent  on me.  I will confirm whatever you say to explain our being here  together, however inappropriate it might be, and I guarantee to make  sure that Mrs. Grubach will not only say she believes the explanation in  public but will believe it truly and sincerely.  You will have no need  to consider me in any way.  If you wish to let it be known that I have  attacked you then Mrs. Grubach will be informed of such and she will  believe it without even losing her trust in me, that's how much respect  she has for me.\"  Miss Buerstner looked at the floor in front of her,  quiet and a little sunk in on herself.  \"Why would Mrs. Grubach not  believe that I've attacked you?\" added K. He looked at her hair in front  of him, parted, bunched down, reddish and firmly held in place.  He  thought she would look up at him, but without changing her manner she  said, \"Forgive me, but it was the suddenness of the knocking that  startled me so much, not so much what the consequences of the captain  being here might be.  It was all so quiet after you'd shouted, and then  there was the knocking, that's was made me so shocked, and I was sitting  right by the door, the knocking was right next to me.  Thank you for  your suggestions, but I won't accept them.  I can bear the  responsibility for anything that happens in my room myself, and I can do  so with anyone.  I'm surprised you don't realise just how insulting your  suggestions are and what they imply about me, although I certainly  acknowledge your good intentions.  But now, please go, leave me alone, I  need you to go now even more than I did earlier.  The couple of minutes  you asked for have grown into half an hour, more than half an hour now.\"  K. took hold of her hand, and then of her wrist, \"You're not cross with  me, though?\" he said.  She pulled her hand away and answered, \"No, no,  I'm never cross with anyone.\"  He grasped her wrist once more, she  tolerated it now and, in that way, lead him to the door.  He had fully  intended to leave.  But when he reached the door he came to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7853"],[0,"Quentin Durward (#6)"],[1,"own  companion, who answered him with one of the downcast lowering smiles  which gleamed along his countenance, enlivening it as a passing meteor  enlivens a winter sky.    The young Scot suddenly stopped, pulled his bonnet over his right  eyebrow, as one that would not be ridiculed, and said firmly, \"My  masters, and especially you, sir, the elder, and who should be the  wiser, you will find, I presume, no sound or safe jesting at my expense.  I do not altogether like the tone of your conversation. I can take a  jest with any man, and a rebuke, too, from my elder, and say thank you,  sir, if I know it to be deserved; but I do not like being borne in  hand as if I were a child, when, God wot, I find myself man enough to  belabour you both, if you provoke me too far.\"    The eldest man seemed like to choke with laughter at the lad's  demeanour--his companion's hand stole to his sword hilt, which the youth  observing, dealt him a blow across the wrist, which made him incapable  of grasping it, while his companion's mirth was only increased by the  incident.    \"Hold, hold,\" he cried, \"most doughty Scot, even for thine own  dear country's sake, and you, gossip, forbear your menacing look.  Pasques-dieu! let us be just traders, and set off the wetting against  the knock on the wrist, which was given with so much grace and  alacrity.--And hark ye, my young friend,\" he said to the young man, with  a grave sternness which, in spite of all the youth could do, damped  and overawed him, \"no more violence. I am no fit object for it, and my  gossip, as you may see, has had enough of it. Let me know your name.\"    \"I can answer a civil question civilly,\" said the youth; \"and will  pay fitting respect to your age, if you do not urge my patience with  mockery. Since I have been here in France and Flanders, men have called  me, in their fantasy, the Varlet with the Velvet Pouch, because of this  hawk purse which I carry by my side; but my true name, when at home, is  Quentin Durward.\"    \"Durward!\" said the querist; \"is it a gentleman's name?\"    \"By fifteen descents in our family,\" said the young man; \"and that makes  me reluctant to follow any other trade than arms.\"    \"A true Scot! Plenty of blood, plenty of pride, and right great scarcity  of ducats, I warrant thee.--Well, gossip,\" he said to his companion,  \"go before us, and tell them to have some breakfast ready yonder at the  Mulberry grove; for this youth will do as much honour to it as a starved  mouse to a housewife's cheese. And for the Bohemian--hark in thy ear.\"    His comrade answered by a gloomy but intelligent smile, and set forward  at a round pace, while the elder man continued, addressing young  Durward, \"You and I will walk leisurely forward together, and we may  take a mass at Saint Hubert's Chapel in our way through the forest; for  it is not good to think of our fleshly before our spiritual wants.\"    [This silvan saint... was passionately fond of the chase, and used to  neglect attendance on divine worship for this amusement. While he was  once engaged in this pastime, a stag appeared before him, having a  crucifix bound betwixt his horns, and he heard a voice which menaced  him with eternal punishment if he did not repent of his sins. He retired  from the world and took orders... Hubert afterwards became Bishop of  Maestrecht and Liege. S.]    Durward, as a good Catholic, had nothing to object against this  proposal, although he might probably have been desirous, in the first  place; to have dried his clothes and refreshed himself. Meanwhile, they  soon lost sight of their downward looking companion, but continued to  follow the same path which he had taken, until it led them into a wood  of tall trees, mixed with thickets and brushwood, traversed by long  avenues, through which were seen, as through a vista, the deer  trotting in little herds with a degree of security which argued their  consciousness of being completely protected.    \"You asked me if I were a good bowman,\" said the young Scot. \"Give me  a bow and a brace of shafts, and you shall have a piece of venison in a  moment.\"    \"Pasques dieu! my young friend,\" said his companion, \"take care of that;  my gossip yonder hath a special eye to the deer; they are under his  charge, and he is a strict keeper.\"    \"He hath more the air of a butcher than of a gay forester,\" answered  Durward. \"I cannot think yon hang dog look of his belongs to any one who  knows the gentle rules of woodcraft.\"    \"Ah, my young friend,\" answered his companion, \"my gossip hath  somewhat an ugly favour to look upon at the first; but those who become  acquainted with him never are known to complain of him.\"    Quentin Durward found something singularly and disagreeably significant  in the tone with which this was spoken; and, looking suddenly at the  speaker, thought he saw in his countenance, in the slight smile that  curled his upper lip, and the accompanying twinkle of his keen dark eye,  something to justify his unpleasing surprise. \"I have heard of robbers,\"  he thought to himself, \"and of wily cheats and cutthroats--what if  yonder fellow be a murderer, and this old rascal his decoy duck! I will  be on my guard--they will get little by me but good Scottish knocks.\"    While he was thus reflecting, they came to a glade, where the large  forest trees were more widely separated from each other, and where the  ground beneath, cleared of underwood and bushes, was clothed with a  carpet of the softest and most lovely verdure, which, screened from the  scorching heat of the sun, was here more beautifully tender than it  is usually to be seen in France. The trees in this secluded spot were  chiefly beeches and elms of huge magnitude, which rose like great hills  of leaves into the air. Amidst these magnificent sons of the earth there  peeped out, in the most open spot of the glade, a lowly chapel, near  which trickled a small rivulet. Its architecture was of the rudest and  most simple kind; and there was a very small lodge beside it, for the  accommodation of a hermit or solitary priest, who remained there for  regularly discharging the duty of the altar. In a small niche over the  arched doorway stood a stone image of Saint Hubert, with the bugle horn  around his neck, and a leash of greyhounds at his feet. The situation of  the chapel in the midst of a park or chase, so richly stocked with game,  made the dedication to the Sainted Huntsman peculiarly appropriate.    Towards this little devotional structure the old man directed his steps,  followed by young Durward; and, as they approached, the priest, dressed  in his sacerdotal garments, made his appearance in the act of proceeding  from his cell to the chapel, for the discharge, doubtless, of his holy  office. Durward bowed his body reverently to the priest, as the respect  due to his sacred office demanded; whilst his companion, with an  appearance of still more deep devotion, kneeled on one knee to receive  the holy man's blessing, and then followed him into church, with a step  and manner expressive of the most heartfelt contrition and humility.    The inside of the chapel was adorned in a manner adapted to the  occupation of the patron saint while on earth. The richest furs of such  animals as are made the objects of the chase in different countries  supplied the place of tapestry and hangings around the altar and  elsewhere, and the characteristic emblazonments of bugles, bows,  quivers, and other emblems of hunting, surrounded the walls, and were  mingled with the heads of deer, wolves, and other animals considered  beasts of sport. The whole adornments took an appropriate and silvan  character; and the mass itself, being considerably shortened, proved to  be of that sort which is called a hunting mass, because in use before  the noble and powerful, who, while assisting at the solemnity, are  usually impatient to commence their favourite sport.    Yet, during this brief ceremony, Durward's companion seemed to pay the  most rigid and scrupulous attention; while Durward, not quite so much  occupied with religious thoughts, could not forbear blaming himself  in his own mind for having entertained suspicions derogatory to the  character of so good and so humble a man. Far from now holding him as  a companion and accomplice of robbers, he had much to do to forbear  regarding him as a saint-like personage.    When mass was ended, they retired together from the chapel, and the  elder said to his young comrade, \"It is but a short walk from hence  to the village--you may now break your fast with an unprejudiced  conscience--follow me.\"    Turning to the right, and proceeding along a path which seemed gradually  to ascend, he recommended to his companion by no means to quit the  track, but, on the contrary, to keep the middle of it as nearly as he  could. Durward could not help asking the cause of this precaution.    \"You are now near the Court, young man,\" answered his guide; \"and,  Pasques-dieu! there is some difference betwixt walking in this region  and on your own heathy hills. Every yard of this ground, excepting  the path which we now occupy, is rendered dangerous, and well nigh  impracticable, by snares and traps, armed with scythe blades, which  shred off the unwary passenger's limb as sheerly as a hedge bill lops a  hawthorn sprig--and calthrops that would pierce your foot through,  and pitfalls deep enough to bury you in them for ever; for you are now  within the precincts of the royal demesne, and we shall presently see  the front of the Chateau.\"    \"Were I the King of France,\" said the young man, \"I would not take so  much trouble with traps and gins, but would try instead to govern so  well that no man should dare to come near my dwelling with a bad intent;  and for those who came there in peace and goodwill, why, the more of  them the merrier we should be.\"    His companion looked round affecting an alarmed gaze, and said, \"Hush,  hush, Sir Varlet"]]]
