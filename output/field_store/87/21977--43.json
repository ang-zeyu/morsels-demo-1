About six of the clock at night, he returned home to his  wife living in Rosemary-lane, and gave her the money, saying, that it  was the deerest money that ever he earned in his life, for it would cost  him his life; which prophetical words were soon made manifest, for it  appeared, that ever since he hath been in a most sad condition, and upon  the Almightie's first scourging of him with the rod of sicknesse, and  the friendly admonition of divers friends for the calling of him to  repentance, yet he persisted on in his vicious vices, and would not  hearken thereunto, but lay raging and swearing, and still pointing at  one thing or another, which he conceived to be still visible before  him.\"    \"About three days before he dy'd, he lay speechlesse, uttering many a  sigh and heavy groan, and so in a most desperate manner departed from  his bed of sorrow. For the buriall whereof great store of wines were  sent in by the sheriff of the city of London, and a great multitude of  people stood wayting to see his corpse carryed to the church-yard, some  crying act, 'Hang him, rogue!' 'Bury him in the dunghill;' others  pressing upon him, saying, they would quarter him for executing of the  king: insomuch that the churchwardens and masters of the parish were  fain to come for the suppressing of them, and (with great difficulty) he  was at last carryed to White Chappell church-yard, having (as it is  said) a bunch of rosemary at each end of the coffin, on the top thereof,  with a rope tyed crosse from one end to the other.    \"And a merry conceited cook living at the sign of the Crown, having a  black fan (worth the value of thirty shillings), took a resolution to  rent the same in pieces, and to every feather tied a piece of  pack-thread dyed in black ink, and gave them to divers persons, who (in  derision) for a while wore them in their hats.    \"Thus have I given thee an exact account and perfect relation of the  life and death of Richard Brandon, to the end that the world may be  convinced of those calumnious speeches and erroneous suggestions which  are dayly spit from the mouth of envy against divers persons of great  worth and eminency, by casting an odium upon them for the executing of  the king; it being now made manifest that the aforesaid executioner was  the only man who gave the fatal blow, and his man that wayted upon him,  was a ragman (of the name of Ralph Jones) living in  Rosemary-lane.\"--_Ellis's Historical Inquiries._           *       *       *       *       *      A MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE.      The night was rather dark, and we had not seen the figure of our  postilion, or even heard his voice; but we suspected, by the slowness of  his movements, that he was some old crony of his master. On arriving  towards the end of the relay, he began to blow a bugle with all his  might, surprising us with a number of flourishes. Mr. Koch informed me  that we were going to cross a small river, and that the blast with which  we had been regaled was a warning for the bargeman. Our vehicle then  stopped before the door of an inn, which stood on an elevated spot, and  the postilion, alighting, asked Mr. Koch's permission to enter the inn  to drink a glass of brandy, whilst the bargeman answered his sign. It  was midnight, and we expected soon to cross the river; but after waiting  a quarter of an hour for his return, and seeing that the fellow did not  come out, I alighted, and proceeded towards a window, where a light was  perceivable. As I looked through it, I saw what I certainly did not  expect, but what convinced me that the flourishes of his bugle were  addressed to a very different person from the bargeman. Our postilion  was sitting near a table, with a huge flagon beside him, and a wench on  his knee. Provoked beyond expression at this unseasonable courtship, I  shook the window till it flew open, and, before my companion had time to  alight and witness the scene, both the hero and the heroine came to the  door of the inn, the latter holding a lantern in her hand, by which I  observed she was an ugly kitchen wench of about eighteen, and he a young  man of five-and-twenty. Displeased with my interruption, he muttered  something at my impatience, and at the unseasonableness of my call, and  again blew his bugle, though by no means so vigorously as he had before  done; after which we gained the barge, and continued our way without  farther interruption.--_Van Halen's Narrative._           *       *       *       *       *      BARBARISM OF THE CAUCASIAN TRIBES.      Opposite to our encampment, on the other side of the Alazann, and at a  distance of eighteen or twenty wersts, is the city of Belohakan,  situated at the foot of the Caucasus, and inhabited by the Eingalos, a  people whom the Lesghis keep in the most horrible state of slavery, and  who formerly belonged to Georgia; but who being too industrious, and  attached to their native soil, would never abandon it, during the  different revolutions which that country has undergone, and became  subject to their present masters. That city carries on a great trade  with Teflis, principally in bourkas, which are manufactured there; and  as the traders pass through Karakhach, our colonel, who was the  commandant of this district, and from whom they must obtain a passport  for Georgia, was obliged to have near him an Eingalo, who understood the  Russian language, and served as interpreter. This man had become so  familiarized with the officers, that the colonel allowed him to sit at  our table. One day we remarked that the interpreter was absent, a  circumstance which seldom occurred; but, as we were finishing our  dessert, he entered the dining-room in high spirits, bringing under his  arm a bundle, carefully tied, which, he said, contained a fine water  melon for our dessert. This fruit, in the middle of December, is  considered a great delicacy, and we all expressed a wish that he should  produce it, when he immediately untied the bundle, and, to our great  Horror, we beheld the head of a Lesghi, whom he had killed in fight on  the other side of the Alazann during a sporting expedition, roll on the  table. Disgusted at this action, which among these barbarous  mountaineers would pass as an excellent joke, we all rose from table,  and retired to another apartment, whilst the Eingalo sat down to dinner,  and, at every mouthful he took, amused himself with turning the head,  which he kept close to his plate, first one way and then  another.--_Ibid_.           *       *       *       *       *        MISCELLANIES             *       *       *       *       *      RELIGIOUS FORTUNE TELLING.      The _Sortes Sanctorum_, or _Sortes Sacrae_, of the Christians, has been  illustrated in the _Classical Journal_.    These, the writer observes, were a species of divination practised in  the earlier ages of Christianity, and consisted in casually opening the  Holy Scriptures, and from the words which first presented themselves  deducing the future lot of the inquirer. They were evidently derived  from the _Sortes Homerica_ and _Sortes Virgilanae_ of the Pagans, but  accommodated to their own circumstances by the Christians.    Complete copies of the Old and New Testaments being rarely met with  prior to the invention of printing, the Psalms, the Prophets, or the  four Gospels, were the parts of holy writ principally made use of in  these consultations, which were sometimes accompanied with various  ceremonies, and conducted with great solemnity, especially on public  occasions. Thus the emperor Heraclius in the war against the Persians,  being at a loss whether to advance or retreat, commanded a public fast  for three days, at the end of which he applied to the four Gospels, and  opened upon a text which he regarded as an oracular intimation to winter  in Albania. Gregory, of Tours, also relates that Meroveus, being  desirous of obtaining the kingdom of Chilperic, his father consulted a  female fortune-teller, who promised him the possession of royal estates;  but to prevent deception and to try the truth of her prognostications,  he caused the Psalter, the Book of Kings, and the four Gospels to be  laid upon the shrine of St. Martin, and after fasting and solemn prayer,  opened upon passages which not only destroyed his former hopes, but  seemed to predict the unfortunate events which afterwards befel him.    A French writer, in 506, says, \"this abuse was introduced by the  superstition of the people, and afterwards gained ground by the  ignorance of the bishops.\" This appears evident from Pithon's Collection  of Canons, containing some forms under the title of _The Lot of the  Apostles_. These were found at the end of the Canons of the Apostles in  the Abbey of Marmousier. Afterwards, various canons were made in the  different councils and synods against this superstition; these continued  to be framed in the councils of London under Archbishop Lanfranc in  1075, and Corboyl in 1126.    The founder of the Francisians, it seems, having denied himself the  possession of any thing but coats and a cord, and still having doubts  whether he might not possess books, first prayed, and then casually  opened upon Mark, chapter iv, \"Unto you it is given to know the mystery  of the kingdom of God; but unto them that are without, all these things  are done in parables;\" from which he drew the conclusion, that books  were not necessary for him.    One Peter of Thoulouse being accused of heresy, and having denied it  upon oath, one of those who stood by, in order to judge of the truth of  his oath, seized the book upon which he had sworn, and opening it  hastily, met with the words of the devil to our Saviour, \"What have we  to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?\" and from thence concluded that  the accused was guilty, and had nothing to do with Christ!

If death  befall, what wonder? since man and horse are mortal; but death loves  better a wide soft bed with quiet curtains and darkened windows in a  still room, the clergyman in the one corner with his prayers, and the  physician in another with his pills, making assurance doubly sure, and  preventing all possibility of the dying Christian's escape.

(_A Fragment._)      To thee--O palest phantom--clothed in white raiment, not like unto a  ghost risen with its grave-clothes to appal, but like a seraph  descending from the skies to bless--unto thee will we dare to speak, as  through the mist of years back comes thy yet unfaded beauty, charming  us, while we cannot choose but weep, with the self-same vision that  often glided before us long, long ago in the wilderness, and at the  sound of our voice would pause for a little while, and then pass by,  like a white bird from the sea, floating unscared close by the  shepherd's head, or alighting to trim its plumes on a knoll far up an  inland glen! Death seems not to have touched that face, pale though it  be--life-like is the waving of those gentle hands--and the soft, sweet,  low music which now we hear, steals not sure from lips hushed by the  burial-mould! Restored by the power of love, she stands before us as she  stood of yore. Not one of all the hairs of her golden head was singed by  the lightning that shivered the tree under which the child had run for  shelter from the flashing sky. But in a moment the blue light in her  dewy eyes was dimmed--and never again did she behold either flower or  star. Yet all the images of all the things she had loved remained in her  memory, clear and distinct as the things themselves before  unextinguished eyes--and ere three summers had flown over head, which,  like the blossom of some fair perennial flower, in heaven's gracious dew  and sunshine each season lifted its loveliness higher and higher in the  light--she could trip her singing way through the wide wilderness, all  by her joyful self, led, as all believed, nor erred they in so  believing, by an angel's hand! When the primroses peeped through the  reviving grass upon the vernal braes, they seemed to give themselves  into her hand; and 'twas thought they hung longer unfaded round her neck  or forehead than if they had been left to drink the dew on their native  bed. The linnets ceased not their lays, though her garment touched the  broomstalk on which they sung. The cushat, as she thrid her way through  the wood, continued to croon in her darksome tree--and the lark,  although just dropped from the cloud, was cheered by her presence into a  new passion of song, and mounted over her head, as if it were his first  matin hymn. All the creatures of earth and air manifestly loved the  Wanderer of the Wilderness--and as for human beings, she was named, in  their pity, their wonder, and their delight, the Blind Beauty of the  Moor!    She was an only child, and her mother had died in giving her birth. And  now her father, stricken by one of the many cruel diseases that shorten  the lives of shepherds on the hills, was bed-ridden--and he was poor. Of  all words ever syllabled by human lips, the most blessed is--Charity. No  manna now in the wilderness is rained from heaven--for the mouths of the  hungry need it not in this our Christian land. A few goats feeding among  the rocks gave them milk, and there was bread for them in each  neighbour's house--neighbour though miles afar--as the sacred duty came  round--and the unrepining poor sent the grateful child away with their  prayers.    One evening, returning to the hut with her usual song, she danced up to  her father's face on his rushy bed, and it was cold in death. If she  shrieked--if she fainted--there was but one ear that heard, one eye that  saw her in her swoon. Not now floating light like a small moving cloud  unwilling to leave the flowery braes, though it be to melt in heaven,  but driven along like a shroud of flying mist before the tempest, she  came upon us in the midst of that dreary moss; and at the sound of our  quaking voice, fell down with clasped hands at our feet--\"My father's  dead!\" Had the hut put already on the strange, dim, desolate look of  mortality? For people came walking fast down the braes, and in a little  while there was a group round us, and we bore her back again to her  dwelling in our arms. As for us, we had been on our way to bid the fair  creature and her father farewell. How could she have lived--an utter  orphan--in such a world! The holy power that is in Innocence would for  ever have remained with her; but Innocence longs to be away, when her  sister Joy has departed; and 'tis sorrowful to see the one on earth,  when the other has gone to heaven! This sorrow none of us had long to  see; for though a flower, when withered at the root, and doomed ere eve  to perish, may yet look to the careless eye the same as when it  blossomed in its pride,--its leaves, still green, are not as once they  were,--its bloom, though fair, is faded--and at set of sun, the dews  shall find it in decay, and fall unfelt on all its petals. Ere Sabbath  came, the orphan child was dead. Methinks we see now her little funeral.  Her birth had been the humblest of the humble; and though all in life  had loved her, it was thought best that none should be asked to the  funeral of her and her father, but two or three friends; the old  clergyman himself walked at the head of the father's coffin--we at the  head of the daughter's--for this was granted unto our exceeding  love;--and thus passed away for ever the Blind Beauty of the  Moor!--_Ibid_.           *       *       *       *       *      THE GATHERER      A snapper up of unconsidered trifles,    SHAKSPEARE.             *       *       *       *       *      EPICURISM.    (_For the Mirror_.)      At a public dinner, Captain R. commencing a conversation with a  gentleman next to him, was astonished at not being able to elicit one  word in answer. At length his silent neighbour turned to him, and said,  with a look and tone suitable to the _importance_ of the communication,  \"Sir, whenever you are at a venison feast, let me advise you _never to  speak during dinner_. In endeavouring to reply to you, I have actually  at this moment swallowed _entire_ a fine piece of fat, _without tasting  it_!\"    J.G.R.           *       *       *       *       *    An Englishman, named _Drinkwater_, was nearly drowned the other day off  Boulogne; on hearing which, a wag observed that he had \"almost taken a  drop too much.\"           *       *       *       *       *      FLY WATER.
