Si uno pregunta por estas voces verbales a un Indio; v.g.: que hay por  Andar, le dice: _Guate_, o _Gine_; y esto no tiene conexion con el _Yu_.  Lo mismo si preguntamos por Aguardar, v.g.: dice: _Tusun: Suti: Tugisi:  utrasi_: y esto en nada se parece a _Yehela_; y lo mismo a cerca de  todas las expresiones o verbos dichos, y las que siguen.      _Ittie_,            Vamonos.    _Ochico_,           No quiero.    _Huimacsi_,         Lo siento, Me compadezco.    _Catshi_,           Silencio, o callense.    _Gire_,             Mira, Reflexiona.    _Mots_,             Pregunto.    _?Motsos?_          ?Ya esta? ?Es asi?    _Cooy_,             Asi es.    _Que_,              Oye: Mira: Atiende.    _Quie_,             Quien sabe.    _Yu nan_,           Vamos a ver: a ver.    _Itque_,            Apartate: dexame.    _Ayuguspu_,         Quitate, o apartate.    _Mini_,             Oye: escucha.    _Eshierse_,         No dicen, &c.    _Eshierase_,        No han dicho.    _Nu attia_,         Si (segun lo que se hable.)    Todas estas expresiones, y otras que se veran en lo restante de este  trabajito, causan una confusion mas que mediana, porque no tienen  proporcion, o tienen muy poca con nuestros modos de hablar.          CAPITULO VI.    Del Participio.    Participio es el que tiene casos, y significa tiempo, y participa del  nombre y del verbo. Mas examinada bien la natura del Participio, veo que  en esta lengua rigurosamente, ni el de presente, ni el de preterito, ni  el de futuro; ni encuentro que se use en expresion alguna. Esta oracion,  v.g.: el que ama a Dios, es bueno: _Amans Deum, bonus est_; resuelto el  Participio: _Ille qui amat Deum, bonus est_. Para hacer esta oracion por  participio en lengua de estos Indios, no hay voces: es preciso resolver  el Participio, y decir: _Numan muisin Dios, miste_. Lo mismo digo de los  Participios de preterito, y futuro; se han de resolver, si se quiere  persuadir, o disuadir alguno cosa, usando, o hablando con Participio.  _Tatagte_; barrido: _Topogte_; acabado:_Sicsaste_; manchado: _Cauyiste_;  secado: _Pasquiste_; harto, o hartado, &c., aunque en castilla suenan, y  son todos estos Participios de Preterito; en lengua materialmente dichas  palabras dicen: _Se barrio; se acabo; se mancho; se seco; se harto_: y  no son estos Participios, sino verbos y tiempos de preterito; y de  consiguente como carece del verbo substantivo _Ser, Tener, Haber_, y  otros auxiliares, no conoce este idioma Participio activos, ni pasivos:  mas quanto nosotros podemos decir con los Participios, sin ellos lo  dicen, y pueden decir los de esta lengua de un modo expresivo e  inteligible que no tiene semejanza al nuestro, ni le es necesario; pues  asi como la lengua es distinta, tiene distinto modo para expresarse, sin  que por esto pueda calificarse de defectuosa, como dixe quando hable del  verbo substantivo _Ser_.          CAPITULO VII.    Del Adverbio.    El Adverbio, para modificar su significacion, es el que se junta al  verbo, y a otras partes de la oracion; v.g.: al adjetivo, y participio,  y alguna vez al substantivo. En esta lengua no solo se junta al verbo,  y al adjetivo, sino a los pronombres, pero siempre abreviado, o con  figura, como vimos en las conjugaciones del verbo, a quien se le  anteponen y posponen con mucha elegancia. Hay varias clases de  adverbios, y los iremos tratando separadamente en sus lugares;  y comienzo por los adverbios de tiempo por haber muchos de esta clase,  aunque no dexa de haber muchos de cada una de las 23 que nos ensenaron  en la gramatica latina, y este idioma no puede contar tantas, como  veremos luego.      Adverbios de Tiempo.      Hoy,            _Naha_. o: este dia              _Neppe tsugis_    Manana,         _Aruta_--Ayer,                   _Huica_    Poco ha,        _Itsa_--Despues,                 _Yete_    Ahora,          _Naha_--Hace muchisimo tiempo,   _Hocse munna_    Al principio,   _Innihuig_--Alguna vez,          _Aipire_    De manana,      _Arua_--Pronto,                  _Quechigueesi_    A la tarde,     _Huniacse_--Tarde,               _Itti_    Luego,          _Inaha_--Siempre,                _Imi_    Nunca,          _Ecue et_--Otra vez,             _Oisigo_    Hasta ahora,    _Tapua_--Entonces,               _Piuagnai_    Nunca jamas,    _Ecue imi_--Siempre jamas,       _Imi ietattia_    Jamas,          _Ecue et_--Un ratito,            _Ipsiun_    Ahora mismo,    _Chien_--Antes,                  _Aru_    Se ponen aqui las cosas siguientes, no porque sean adverbios, sino por  ser tocantes al tiempo.      Al ponerse el sol,               _Pilpilte_.    Al anochecer,                    _Sosoronin_.    Se ha hecho tarde,               _Huicaste_.

Y asi de los demas adverbios de lugar.    ADVERBIOS DE SIMILITUD.      Como,          _Cata_.         Asi como,       _Cati Cata_.    ADVERBIOS DE QUANTIDAD, O CANTIDAD.

Parecera extraordinario algun adverbio; mas dexo otros, porque tienen un  modo de adverbiar estos Naturales, que en su lengua son adverbios, y en  la nuestra no. Digo que son adverbios, porque no son otra parte de la  oracion en su sintaxis: Tambien digo que este idioma no tiene adverbios  comparativos, y muy pocos de similitud, y con los de esta clase se  suplen los comparativos; y en esto sigue a la Hebrea, la que vale de la  preposicion _prae_ que los latinos vierten en _ab_ en los comparativos.  Tampoco tiene genitivo dicha Hebrea, y en esta lo he puesto, no porque  se distingue de la terminacion del nominativo, sino porque en el  sintaxis en cosas que piden rigurosamente genitivo, usan de aquella voz  que se parece al genitivo; y muches veces en la latina lo mismo suena,  (como dixe en otro lugar) el nominativo, el acusativo, el vocativo,  y sin embargo por el sintaxis conocemos que caso es.          CAPITULO VIII.    DE LA PREPOSICION Y POSPOSICION.    Si la Preposicion en nuestra gramatica es la que se antepone a las demas  partes de la oracion para guiarlas al verdadero sentido de relacion,  o respeto que tienen entre si las cosas que significan; la Posposicion  en esta lengua es la que se pospone a las demas partes de la oracion,  y hace los mismos"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11093"],[0,"Trailin'! (#7)"],[1,"if they reached the end of an agreed course, the two whirled at the  same instant, the metal in their hands glinted in an upward semicircle,  and two guns barked hoarsely across the lawns.    One of them stood with his gun still poised; the other leaned gradually  forward and toppled at full length on the grass. The victor strode out  toward the fallen, but hearing the wild yell of Anthony he stopped,  turned his head, and then fled into the grove of trees which topped the  next rise of ground. After him, running as he had never before raced,  went Anthony; his hand, as he sprinted, already tensed for the coming  battle; two hundred yards at the most and he would reach the lumbering  figure which had plunged into the night of the trees; but a call reached  him as sharp as the crack of the guns a moment before: \"Anthony!\"    His head twitched to one side and he saw John Bard rising to his elbow.  His racing stride shortened choppily.    \"Anthony!\"    He could not choose but halt, groaning to give up the chase, and then  sped back to the fallen man. At his coming John Bard collapsed on the  grass, and when Anthony knelt beside him a voice in rough dialect began,  as if an enforced culture were brushed away and forgotten in the crisis:  \"Anthony, there ain't no use in followin' him!\"    \"Where did the bullet strike you? Quick!\"    \"A place where it ain't no use to look. I know!\"    \"Let me follow him; it's not too late--\"    The dying man struggled to one elbow.    \"Don't follow, lad, if you love me.\"    \"Who is he? Give me his name and--\"    \"He's acted in the name of God. You have no right to hunt him down.\"    \"Then the law will do that.\"    \"Not the law. For God's sake swear--\"    \"I'll swear anything. But now lie quiet; let me--\"    \"Don't try. This couldn't end no other way for John Bard.\"    \"Is that your real name?\"    \"Yes. Now listen, Anthony, for my time's short.\"    He closed his eyes as if fighting silently for strength.    Then: \"When I was a lad like you, Anthony--\" That was all. The massive  body relaxed; the head fell back into the dewy grass. Anthony pressed  his head against the breast of John Bard and it seemed to him that there  was still a faint pulse. With his pocket knife he ripped away the coat  from the great chest and then tore open the shirt. On the expanse of the  hairy chest there was one spot from which the purple blood welled; a  deadly place for a wound, and yet the bleeding showed that there must  still be life.    He had no chance to bind the wound, for John Bard opened his eyes again  and said, as if in his dream he had still continued his tale to Anthony.    \"So that's all the story, lad. Do you forgive me?\"    \"For what, sir? In God's name, for what?\"    \"Damnation! Tell me; do you forgive John Bard?\"    He did not hear the answer, for he murmured: \"Even Joan would forgive,\"  and died.          CHAPTER VII      BLUEBEARD'S ROOM    As Anthony Woodbury, he knelt beside the dying. As Anthony Bard he rose  with the dead man in his arms a mighty burden even for his supple  strength; yet he went staggering up the slope, across a level terrace,  and back to the house. There it was Peters who answered his call, Peters  with a flabby face grown grey, but still the perfect servant who asked  no questions; together they bore the weight up the stairs and placed it  on John Bard's bed. While Anthony kept his steady vigil by the dead man,  it was Peters again who summoned the police and the useless doctor.    To the old, uniformed sergeant, Anthony told a simple lie. His father  had gone for a walk through the grounds because the night was fine, and  Anthony was to join him there later, but when he arrived he found a  dying man who could not even explain the manner of his death.    \"Nothin' surprises me about a rich man's death,\" said the sergeant,  \"not in these here days of anarchy. Got a place to write? I want to make  out my report.\"    So Anthony led the grizzled fellow to the library and supplied him with  what he wished. The sergeant, saying good-bye, shook hands with a  lingering grip.    \"I knew John Woodbury,\" he said, \"just by sight, but I'm here to tell  the world that you've lost a father who was just about all man. So long;  I'll be seein' you again.\"    Left alone, Anthony Bard went to the secret room. The key fitted  smoothly into the lock. What the door opened upon was a little grey  apartment with an arched ceiling, a place devoid of a single article of  furniture save a straight-backed chair in the centre. Otherwise Anthony  saw three things-two pictures on the wall and a little box in the  corner. He went about his work very calmly, for here, he knew, was the  only light upon the past of John Bard, that past which had lain passive  so long and overwhelmed him on this night.    First he took up the box, as being by far the most promising of the  three to give him what he wished to know; the name of the slayer, the  place where he could be found, and the cause of the slaying. It held  only two things; a piece of dirty silk and a small oil can; but the oil  can and the black smears on the silk made him look closer, closer until  the meaning struck him in a flare, as the glow of a lighted match  suddenly illumines, even if faintly, an entire room.    In that box the revolver had lain, and here every day through all the  year, John Bard retired to clean and oil his gun, oil and reclean it,  keeping it ready for the crisis. That was why he went to the secret room  as soon as he heard the call from the garden, and carrying that gun with  him he had walked out, prepared. The time had come for which he had  waited a quarter of a century, knowing all that time that the day must  arrive. It was easy to understand now many an act of the big grim man;  but still there was no light upon the slayer.    As he sat pondering he began to feel as if eyes were fastened upon him,  watching, waiting, mocking him, eyes from behind which stared until a  chill ran up his back. He jerked his head up, at last, and flashed a  glance over his shoulder.    Indeed there was mockery in the smile with which she stared down to him  from her frame, down to him and past him as if she scorned in him all  men forever. It was not that which made Anthony close his eyes. He was  trying with all his might to conjure up his own image vividly. He  looked again, comparing his picture with this portrait on the wall, and  then he knew why the grey man at the Garden had said: \"Son, who's your  mother?\" For this was she into whose eyes he now stared.    She had the same deep, dark eyes, the same black hair, the same rather  aquiline, thin face which her woman's eyes and lovely mouth made  beautiful, but otherwise the same. He was simply a copy of that head  hewn with a rough chisel--a sculptor's clay model rather than a smoothly  finished re-production.    Ah, and the fine spirit of her, the buoyant, proud, scornful spirit! He  stretched out his arms to her, drew closer, smiling as if she could meet  and welcome his caress, and then remembered that this was a thing of  canvas and paint--a bright shadow; no more.    To the second picture he turned with a deeper hope, but his heart fell  at once, for all he saw was an enlarged photograph, two mountains,  snow-topped in the distance, and in the foreground, first a mighty pine  with the branches lopped smoothly from the side as though some  tremendous ax had trimmed it, behind this a ranch-house, and farther  back the smooth waters of a lake.    He turned away sadly and had reached the door when something made him  turn back and stand once more before the photograph. It was quite the  same, but it took on a different significance as he linked it with the  two other objects in the room, the picture of his mother and the  revolver box. He found himself searching among the forest for the  figures of two great grey men, equal in bulk, such Titans as that wild  country needed.    West it must be, but where? North or South? West, and from the West  surely that grey man at the Garden had come, and from the West John Bard  himself. Those two mountains, spearing the sky with their sharp  horns--they would be the pole by which he steered his course.    A strong purpose is to a man what an engine is to a ship. Suppose a hull  lies in the water, stanchly built, graceful in lines of strength and  speed, nosing at the wharf or tugging back on the mooring line, it may  be a fine piece of building but it cannot be much admired. But place an  engine in the hull and add to those fine lines the purr of a  motor--there is a sight which brings a smile to the lips and a light in  the eyes. Anthony had been like the unengined hulk, moored in gentle  waters with never the hope of a voyage to rough seas. Now that his  purpose came to him he was calmly eager, almost gay in the prospect of  the battle.    On the highest hill of Anson Place in a tomb overlooking the waters of  the sound, they lowered the body of John Bard.    Afterward Anthony Bard went back to the secret room of his father. The  old name of Anthony Woodbury he had abandoned; in fact, he felt almost  like dating a new existence from the moment when he heard the voice  calling out of the garden: \"John Bard, come out to me!\" If life was a  thread, that voice was the shears which snapped the trend of his life  and gave him a new beginning. As Anthony Bard he opened once more the  door of the chamber.    He had replaced the revolver of John Bard in the box with the oiled  silk. Now he took it out again and shoved it into his back trouser  pocket, and then stood a long moment under the picture of the woman he  knew was his mother. As he stared he felt himself receding to youth, to  boyhood, to child days, finally to a helpless infant which that woman,  perhaps, had held and loved. In those dark, brooding eyes he strove to  read the mystery of his existence, but they remained as unriddled as the  free stars of heaven.    He repeated"]]]
