The comparison of the Pharisees with the Stoics is again  misleading, and based on nothing more than the formal likeness of their  doctrines about Providence. The Pharisees were essentially the party  that upheld the whole tradition and the separateness of Israel. They  numbered in their ranks the most popular teachers, and politically,  though opposed to Rome and all its ways, they counseled submission so  long as religious liberty was not infringed. It may be that Josephus  only professed his attachment to them after his surrender, because, as  pacifists and believers in moral as against physical force, they were  favorably regarded by the Romans; but even if as a young and ambitious  priest he attached himself to their body early in life in order to gain  influence among the people, he was not a representative Pharisee. He  obtained a certain acquaintance with the teaching of the Pharisees, and  partly shared their political views, though not from the same motives as  their true leaders. Yet the very next step in his life that he  chronicles marks his outlook as fundamentally different.    At the age of twenty-six, after seven years in Jerusalem, during which  he exercised his priestly functions, he journeyed to Rome. The cause of  his voyage, on which he was picturesquely wrecked and had to swim for  his life through the night, was the deliverance from prison of certain  priests closely related to him, who had been sent there as prisoners by  Felix, the tyrannical Roman governor. At Rome, through his acquaintance  with Aliturius, an actor of plays, a favorite of Nero, and by birth a  Jew, he came into touch with the profligate court. To the genuine  Pharisee a Jewish play-actor would have been an abomination. Josephus  used his acquaintance to obtain an introduction to Poppaea Sabina, the  Emperor's wife for the time. Though a by-word for shamelessness of life,  she was herself one of \"the fearers of the Lord\" ([Greek: sebomenoi]),  who professed adherence to the Jewish creed without accepting the Jewish  law. Josephus won her favor, and through it procured the liberation of  the priests. The Imperial city was then at the height of its material  magnificence, and must have made an immense impression of power upon the  young Jewish aristocrat. Having acquired a lasting admiration for Rome  and a desire to enter her society and a conviction of her invincibility,  he returned to Palestine in triumph--and with the spirit of an  opportunist. This at least is the picture he draws of himself, but a  more kindly interpretation might see in the moment of his return the  indication of a genuine patriotic feeling.    When he arrived in Jerusalem, in the year 65 C.E., he found his country  seething with rebellion. The crisis soon came to a head. Gessius Florus,  who owed his governorship, as Josephus owed the success of his errand,  to the favor of the \"God-fearing\" Poppaea, roused the people to fury by  his pillage of the Temple, and the moderates could no longer hold the  masses in check. The Zealots seized the fortress of Antonia, which  overlooked the Temple, and, having become masters of the city, murdered  the high priest Ananias. Eleazar, whom Josephus, perhaps confusedly,  describes as his son, an intense nationalist among the priests, became  the leader in counsel, and sealed the rebellion by persuading the people  to discontinue the daily sacrifice offered in the name of the Roman  Emperor.    At the same time the extermination of the Jews in the Hellenistic  cities, Caesarea, Scythopolis, and Damascus, by the infuriated Syrians,  who organized a kind of Palestinian Vespers, convinced the people that  they were engaged in a war to the death. The Herodian party, as the  royal house and its supporters were called, endeavored to preserve  peace, by dwelling on the overpowering might of Rome and the inevitable  end of the insurrection, but in vain. In fear the priests withdrew to  their duties in the Temple, and did not venture out till the Zealots  were for a time dislodged. The Roman legate of Syria, Cestius Gallus,  after the defeat of the Romanizing party by the Zealots, himself marched  on Jerusalem in the autumn of 68 C.E. with two legions. But he failed  ignominiously to quell the revolt. The Roman garrison in the city was  put to the sword, and the legate, while beating a hasty retreat, was  routed in the defiles of Beth-Horon, where two centuries before the  Syrian hosts had been decimated by Judas the Maccabee. The two legions  were cut to pieces. The fierce valor of the untrained national levies  had broken the serried cohorts of the Roman veterans, and in the  unexpectedness of this deliverance the party of rebellion for a time was  triumphant among all sections of the Jewish people.    Even those who had been the most determined Romanizers, such as the  high-priestly circle, were induced, either by a belief in the chances of  success or from a desire to protect themselves by a seeming adherence to  the national cause, to throw in their lot with the war party. It might  have been better for their people, had they, like Agrippa, joined the  Romans. Half-hearted at best in their support of the struggle, yet by  their wealth and position able at first to obtain a commanding part in  the conduct of the war, they used it to temporize with the foe and to  dull the edge of the popular feeling. Josephus unfortunately does not  enlighten us as to the inner movements in Judea at this crisis. He  merely relates that the Sanhedrin became a council of war, and Palestine  was divided into seven military districts, over most of which commanders  of the Herodian faction were placed. Joseph the son of Gorion and  Ananias the high priest, both members of the moderate party, were chosen  as governors of Jerusalem, with a particular charge to repair the walls,  and the Zealot leader Eleazar the son of Simon was passed over.    Josephus himself, though he possessed no military experience, and had  apparently taken no part in the opening campaign, was made governor of  Lower and Upper Galilee, the most important military post of all; for  Galilee was the bulwark of Judea, and if the Romans could be  successfully resisted there, the rebellion might hope for victory. It  lay in a strategic position between the Roman outposts, Ptolemais (the  modern Acre) on the coast and Agrippa's kingdom in the east. It was a  country made for defense, a country of rugged mountains and natural  fastnesses, and inhabited by a hardy and warlike population, which, for  half a century, had been in constant insurrection. Thence had come the  founders of the Zealots and the still more violent band of the Sicarii,  and each town in the region had its popular leader. Josephus was  expected to hold it with its own resources, for little help could be  spared from the center of Palestine. Guerrilla fighting was the natural  resource of an insurgent people, which had to win its freedom against  well-trained and veteran armies. It had been the method of Judas  Maccabaeus against Antiochus amid the hills of Judea. Josephus, however,  made no attempt to practise it, and showed no vestige of appreciation of  the needs of the case.    It is difficult to gather the reason of his appointment, unless it be  that in his writings he deliberately kept back from the Romans the more  enthusiastic part he had played at the outset of the struggle. So far as  his own account goes, neither devotion to the national cause, nor  experience, nor prestige, nor power of leadership, nor knowledge of the  country recommended him. His distinguished birth and his friendship for  Rome were hardly sufficient qualifications for the post. The influence  of his friend, the ex-high priest Joshua ben Gamala, may have prevailed,  and one is fain to surmise that those who sent him, as well as he  himself, were anxious to pretend resistance to Rome, but really to work  for resistance to the rebellion.    At all events, at the end of the autumn of 67, Josephus repaired to his  command, taking with him two priests, Joazar and Judas, as  representatives of the Sanhedrin at Jerusalem. In the record which he  gives of his exploits in the _Wars_, he says that his first care was to  gain the good-will of the people, drill his troops, and prepare the  country to meet the threatened invasion. In the _Life_, which he wrote  some twenty years later, when he had perforce to cultivate a more  complete servility of mind, and was anxious to convince the Romans that  he was a double-dealing traitor to his country, he represents that he  set himself from the beginning to betray the province. The record of his  actions points to the conclusion that he fell between the stools of  covert treachery and half-hearted loyalty, that he was neither as  villainous in design nor as heroic in action as he makes himself out to  be. He made some show of preparation at the beginning, but from the  moment the Roman army arrived under Vespasian, and he realized that Rome  was in earnest, he abandoned all hope of success, and set himself to  make his own position secure with the conqueror.    The chief cities of Galilee were Sepphoris, situated on the lower spurs  of the hills near the plain of Esdraelon, which divides the country from  Samaria and Judea; Tiberias, a city founded by Herod Antipas on the  western borders of the Lake of Gennesareth, and Tarichea, also an  Herodian foundation, situate probably at the southeast corner of the  lake. All these Josephus fortified; and he strengthened with walls other  smaller towns and natural fortresses, such as Jotapata, Salamis, and  Gamala.[1] He says also that he appointed a Sanhedrin of seventy members  for the province, and in each town established a court of seven judges,  as though he were come to exercise a civil government. He did, however,  get together an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9799"],[0,"It Happened in Egypt (#6)"],[1," of excitement on the decks and in the ivy draped  veranda cafe. Those who had been studying Baedeker gabbled history,  ancient and modern, until the conquest of Alexander and the bombardment  of '82 became a hopeless jumble in the ears of the ignorant. Bores who  had travelled inflicted advice on victims who had not. People told each  other pointless anecdotes of \"the last time I was in Egypt,\" while  those forced to listen did so with the air of panthers waiting to  pounce. A pause for breath on the part of the enemy gave the wished-for  opportunity to spring into the breach with an adventure of their own.    We took an Arab pilot on board--the first Arab ever seen by the ladies  of my party--and before the red torch of sunset had burned down to  dusky purple, tenders like big, black turtles were swimming out to the  _Laconia_. We slaves of the Rose, however, had surrendered all personal  interest in these objects. The word of Miss Gilder had gone forth, and,  unless Rechid Bey changed his mind at the last minute, we were all to  lurk in ambush until he appeared with his wife. Then, somehow, Monny  was to snatch her chance for a word with the Ship's Mystery; and  whatever happened, none of us were to stir until it had been snatched.    Arguments, even from Biddy, were of no avail, and mine were silenced by  cold permission to go away by myself if I chose. It was terrible, it  was wicked to talk of people making their own beds and then lying in  them. It was nonsense to say that, even if the wife of Rechid Bey asked  for help, we could do nothing. Of course, we would do something! If the  girl wanted to be saved, she should be saved, if Monny had to act  alone. Whatever happened, Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Bailey must remain in  the background, as the very sight of them would drive \"Wretched Bey\"  _wild!_    I was thinking of Anthony's surprise when one after the other, two  tenders should reach the quay without me; and if the Gilded Rose had  not been so sweet, her youthful cocksureness would have made me yearn  to slap her. In spite of all, however, the girl's excitement became  contagious as passengers crowded down the gangway and Rechid Bey did  not appear.    \"Allah--Allah!\" cried the boatman and the Arab porters as they hauled  huge trunks off the ship onto a float. Then one after the other the two  tenders puffed away, packed from stem to stern. A few people for whom  there was no room embarked in small boats manned by jabbering Arabs.  Two of these cockle-shells still moved up and down under the black,  mountainous side of the ship, and the officer whose duty it was to see  the passengers off was visibly restless. He wanted to know if my  lordship was ready; and my lordship's brain was straining after an  excuse for further delay, when a man and woman arrived opportunely;  Rechid Bey and a veiled, muffled form hooked to his arm; a slender,  appealing little figure: and through the veil I fancied that I caught a  gleam of large, wistful, anxious eyes.    The ladies were lying in wait out of sight, and I dodged behind the  sturdy blue shoulders guarding the gangway. This was my first glimpse  of the Ship's Mystery; and though I did not like my job (I had to  surprise Rechid Bey and take his mind off his wife) my curiosity was  pricked. The figure in sealskin looked very girlish; the veiled head  was bowed. The mystery took on human personality for me, and Monny  Gilder was no longer obstinate; she was a loyal friend. I did not see  that we could be of use to the poor little fool who had married a Turk,  yet I was suddenly ready to do what I could. As Rechid Bey brought his  wife to the top of the gangway, I lounged out, and spoke. Disconcerted,  the stout, good-looking man of thirty let drop the arm of the girl,  putting her behind him. And this was what Monny wanted. They would have  an instant for a few disjointed words: Monny might perhaps have time to  promise help which the girl dared not ask, even behind her husband's  back.    \"Good evening,\" I said in French, taking advantage of a smoke-room  acquaintance. \"Is that smart boat down there for you? I was trying to  secure it, in my best Arabic, but the fellow said it was engaged.\"    \"Yes, it is mine,\" Rechid answered, civilly, trying to hide his  annoyance. \"I telegraphed from Naples to a friend in Alexandria to send  me a private boat. I do not like crowds.\"    \"Neither do I, so I waited, too,\" I explained. \"They told me there were  always boats, and my big luggage has gone. I suppose yours has, too?\"    \"No doubt,\" said Rechid Bey. \"Good night, Milord Borrow.\"    He turned quickly to his wife, as if to catch her at something, but the  slim veiled mystery stood meekly awaiting his will. To my intense  relief Monny and her friends were invisible. I could hardly wait until  the two figures had passed out of sight down the gangway, to know  whether my skirmishing attack had been successful.    \"Well?\" I asked, as Miss Gilder, \"Mrs. Jones,\" Cleopatra, Rachel Guest,  and two maids filed out from concealment. \"Did I give you time enough?  Did you get the chance you wanted?\"    \"Yes, thank you ever so much,\" said Monny, with one of those dazzling  smiles that would make her a beauty even if she were not the favourite  Sunday supplement heiress. \"I counted on you--and _she_ had counted on  me. She must have known I wouldn't fail her, for she had this bit of  paper ready. When I jumped out she slipped it into my hand. We didn't  need to say a word, and Wretched Bey has no idea I came near her.\"    \"A bit of paper?\" I echoed, with interest. For it sounded the obvious  secret thing; a bit of paper stealthily slid from hand to hand.    \"Yes, with her address on it--nothing more in writing: but two other  words, pricked with a pin. '_Save me._' Don't you see, if her husband  had pounced on it, no harm would have been done. He wouldn't have  noticed the pin-pricks, as a woman would. I thought she was going to  live in Cairo, and I believe she thought so too, at first. But she's  written down the name of a house in a place called Asiut. Did you ever  hear of such a town, Lord Ernest?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said I. \"The Nile boats stop there and people see tombs and  mummied cats and buy silver shawls.\"    \"Good!\" said Monny. \"_My_ boat shall stop there, but not only for tombs  or cats or silver shawls. I have an idea that the poor girl is  frightened, and wants me to help her escape.\"    \"Great heavens!\" I exclaimed. \"You mustn't on any account get mixed up  in an adventure of that sort! Remember, this is Egypt----\"    \"I don't care,\" said Monny, \"if it's the moon.\"    She believed that this settled the matter. I believed the exact  opposite. But I left it at that, for the moment, as the boat was  waiting, and Asiut seemed a long way off.    This was my first lesson in what Brigit called \"Monny's little ways\";  but the second lesson was on the heels of the first.          CHAPTER III    A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A DRAGOMAN      It was a blow not to see Anthony on the quay. And other blows rained  thick and fast. My two consolations were that I was actually in Egypt;  and that in the confusion Rechid Bey with the veiled figure of his  silent bride had slipped away without further incidents. Their  disappearance was regretted by no one save Monny, unless it was Neill  Sheridan, and he was discreet enough to keep his feelings to himself.  The girl was not. She protested on principle, although she had the  Asiut address. But where all men, black and brown and white, were  yelling with the whole force of their lungs, and pitching and tossing  luggage (mostly the wrong luggage) with all the force of their arms,  nobody heard or cared what she said. For once Monny Gilder was  disregarded by a crowd of men. This could happen only at the departure  of a boat train! But if I was not thinking about her, I was thinking  about her fifteen trunks, and Cleopatra's sixteen and Biddy's and Miss  Guest's two. The maids were worse than useless, and I had no valet. I  have never had a valet. I clawed, I fought, I wrestled in an arena  where it was impossible to tell the wild beasts from the martyrs. I  rescued small bags from under big boxes, and dashed off with a few  samples to the train, in order to secure places. All other able-bodied  men, including Sheridan and the artist sculptor Bailey, were engaged in  the same pursuit, and our plan was to \"bag\" a whole compartment between  us in the boat-special for Cairo. But we never met again till we  reached our destination. One expects Egypt to warm the heart with its  weather, but the cold was bitter; so was the disappointment about  Anthony. Both cut through me like knives. Darkness had fallen before I  was ready to join the ladies--if I could. In passing earlier, I had  shouted to the maids where to find the places, grabbed with difficulty,  for their mistresses. Whether they had found them, or whether any of  the party still existed, was the next question; and it was settled only  as the train began to move. The compartment I had selected was boiling  over with a South American president and his effects; but as I stood  transfixed by this transformation scene, Cleopatra's maid hailed me  from the end of the corridor. _Les quatres dames_ were in the  restaurant car. Why? Ah, it was the Arab they had engaged as dragoman,  who had advised the change in milord's absence. He said it would be  better, as of course they would want dinner. He himself was looking  after the small _baggages_, except the little sacks of the hand which  the maids kept.    What, the ladies had engaged a dragoman! And they had trusted him--a  stranger--with luggage? Then it was as good as gone! But no, mildly  ventured Cleopatra's handmaiden. The dragoman came recommended. He had  a letter from a friend of milord.    My thoughts jumped, of course, to Anthony. Yet how could he have known  that I was travelling with ladies? And if by some Marconian miracle he  had heard, why"]]]
