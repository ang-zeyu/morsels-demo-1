They not only attend personally to  public business, but are continually practising manly exercises, and engage  in field sports with all the ardour of a race who cherish the habits of  their Tartar ancestors. The present king is an expert marksman and an  excellent horseman; few weeks pass without his partaking in the pleasures  of the chase. The king has always a historiographer and a chief poet. The  one writes the annals of his reign; the other, who has a high rank at  court, composes odes in his praise, and, with grateful ardour, celebrates  the munificence of his patron. A giant and a dwarf were at one period of  the present reign part of the royal establishment; and it is never without  a jester, who enjoys an extraordinary latitude of speech, and, both in his  dress and manner, assumes the habit and appearance of folly. It is usual to  laugh at the witticisms of these jesters, even when they are the most  severe; and the sovereign himself respects their privilege. The tribe to  which Kerreem Khan belonged, speak a language which, from its rudeness, is  denominated \"the barbarous dialect.\" As this prince was one day sitting in  public, he commanded his jester to go and bring him word what a dog, that  was barking very loud, wanted. The courtiers smiled at this sally of their  monarch. The jester went, and, after appearing to listen for some time with  profound attention, returned, and said, with a grave air, \"Your majesty  must send one of the chief officers of your own family to report what that  gentleman says: he speaks no language except \"the barbarous dialect,\" with  which they are familiar, but of which I do not understand one word.\" The  good-humoured monarch laughed heartily at this jest, and gave the wit a  present. This anecdote, to which many similar might be added, shows that  there is little difference between the office of jester at the modern court  of Persia, and that which some centuries ago existed at every court in  Europe. A resemblance even in trifling forms merits attention, as it may  lead to conclusions on the progress of knowledge and the condition of  society; and from the character of their amusements, we may perhaps judge  as correctly as from their more serious occupations, of the degree of  civilization which a people has attained. In the court there is always a  person who bears the name of \"story-teller to his majesty;\" and the duties  of his office require a man of no mean acquirements. Though passionately  fond of public exhibitions, the Persians have none that deserve the name of  theatrical entertainments; but though strangers to the regular drama, their  stories are often dramatic; and those whose occupation is to tell them,  sometimes display so extraordinary a skill, and such varied powers, that we  can hardly believe, while we look on their altered countenances and listen  to their changed tones, that it is the same person, who at one moment tells  a plain narrative in his natural voice, then speaks in the hoarse and angry  tone of offended authority, and next subdues the passions he has excited by  the softest sounds of feminine tenderness. The art of relating stories is  attended both with profit and reputation. Great numbers attempt it, but few  succeed.    The person whose office it is to amuse his majesty with these stories is  always in attendance. It is equally his duty to beguile the fatigue of a  long march, and to soothe the mind when disturbed by the toils of public  affairs; and his tales are artfully made to suit the disposition and  momentary humour of the monarch. Sometimes he recites a story of the genii;  at others he speaks of the warlike deeds of former sovereigns, or of the  love of some wandering prince. Often the story is of coarser materials, and  the king is entertained with low and obscene adventures. In no court is  more rigid attention paid to ceremony. Looks, words, the motions of the  body, are all regulated by the strictest forms. When the king is seated in  public, his sons, ministers, and courtiers, stand erect, with their hands  crossed, and in the exact place belonging to their rank. They watch his  looks, and a glance is a command. If he speaks to them, you hear a voice  reply, and see the lips move, but not a motion or gesture betrays that  there is animation in any other part of the frame. The monarch often speaks  in the third person: \"The king is pleased,\" \"The king commands.\" His  ministers usually style him \"The object of the world's regard.\" They are as  particular in forms of speech as in other ceremonies; and superiority and  inferiority of rank, in all their gradations, are implied by the terms used  in the commonest conversations.    _Sir J. Malcolm's History of Persia._           *       *       *       *       *        THE COSMOPOLITE.           *       *       *       *       *      We love an occasional stroll into the environs of London--_on foot_--and  _alone_. On foot, because we hate the machinery of a coach--and alone,  because we have only our own leisure to consult, and there is no time lost  in \"making up minds.\" On such occasions we have no set object in view, but  we determine to make \"good in every thing.\" A book, great or small, is then  to us a great evil; and putting a map into one's pocket is about as absurd  as Peter Fin's taking Cook's Voyages on his journey to Brighton. We read  the other day of a reviewer who started from Charing Cross with a blue bag  filled with books for his criticship: he read at Camberwell, and he read at  Dulwich--he wrote in the sanded and smoke-dried parlour of the Lion, the  Lamb, or the Fox--and he wrote whilst his steak was grilling at the  _auberge_ at Dulwich--and he went home in a hackney-coach: \"Lord how he  went out--Lord how he came in.\" Another brother talks of rambling in a  secluded village field with Gilbert White's \"Natural History of Selborne,\"  or the \"Journal of a Naturalist,\" in his hand. All this is very pleasant  and mighty pretty; but it is not true; and we stake our critical character  that neither Gilbert White nor our \"Naturalist\" did such things, or if they  did, that they were not essential to their writings. Making notes and  comparing them with others, after a long walk, is another matter; but to  walk out into the country to read a book on natural philosophy is not  indicative of a susceptible mind. For our own part, we want no book but the  broad volume of Nature--but to derive profit as well as pleasure, we must  go out with some of the philosophy of Nature in our hearts--for walking is  like travelling, (which is only a long walk,)--\"a man must carry knowledge  with him, if he would bring home knowledge.\" We think Mr. Hazlitt talks of  lying a whole day on Salisbury Plain as one of his greatest enjoyments, and  he is doubtless sincere. When we set out on such a walk as we are about to  take, with the reader's consent, we quote Thomson for our exordium:--      To me be Nature's volume broad display'd;    And to peruse its all instructive page,      *       *       *       *       *      My sole delight; as through the falling glooms    Pensive I stray, or with the rising dawn    On Fancy's eagle wing excursive soar;    --and starting from our metropolis, we love to watch the ebbing of  population, the dwindling from groves of chimneys and worlds of bricks and  mortar to tricksy cottages marshalled with the plumb-line, or sprinkled  over \"farmy fields\" facing Macadamized roads, and collecting more dust in  one month than would have ransomed all the captive kings of history, sacred  or profane. There we love to trace the ramifications of art from the steam  and gas chimneys of the metropolis to the quiet dell, in whose seclusion  you might imagine yourself a hundred miles from town, were it not for the  hum of the great tun that is fretting and working at a distance. On the  road you enjoy scenes that are to be found in no printed book. Nay, every  sign-board is a study. Those near the town would do honour to the  President's pencil; as you advance, they retrograde--and as Art declines,  Nature smiles still sweeter and softer in never-ending successions of woods  and groves, hills and dales, glassy lakes and pebbly streams, with all the  variegated charms of rustic life.    But we are getting too _rural_; for our \"Suburban Stroll\" extended but to  Dulwich and back, about four miles south of London. Twenty years since, we  remember, the parish of Camberwell (which includes Peckham and Dulwich) was  a pleasant village, with several mansions inhabited by citizens of  property, who retired hither for air and recreation; now the whole district  is crowded with lath and plaster cottages, and sugar-bakers' boxes, which  appear well adapted for twelfth-cake kings and queens.[7] Twenty years ago,  we enjoyed the embowered walk of Camberwell Grove, and above all, _Grove  Hill_, the retreat of Dr. John Coakley Lettsom, till his benevolence  overmuch obliged him to part with this delightful residence. Well do we  remember the picturesque effect of Grove Hill, the unostentatious,  casino-like villa, ornamented with classic figures of Liberality, Plenty,  and Flora--and the sheet of water whose surface was broken by a stream from  a dank and moss-crusted fountain in its centre. Then, the high, overarching  grove, and its summit, traditionally said to be the spot where George  Barnwell murdered his uncle, the incident that gave rise to Lillo's  pathetic tragedy. But the march of improvement has extended hither--the  walk can scarcely be traced: still there is abundance of timber, for the  grove has disappeared, and scores of new houses have sprung up with almost  magical effect--and the whole scene reminds us of one of the change-scenes  of a pantomime. The builder's _share_ has turned over nearly every inch of  the ground, and fresh gravel and loose loam remind the philosophical  pedestrian that all is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11340"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

He states,  that at another time it produced copious bleeding at the nose; the  same effect was produced also upon his lady, who was almost rendered  incapable of walking. The strange accounts naturally excite the  attention and wonder of all classes of people; the learned and the  vulgar were equally desirous of experiencing so singular a sensation,  and great numbers of half-taught electricians wandered through every  part of Europe to gratify this universal curiosity.    It is on the nervous system that the most considerable action of  electricity is exerted. A strong charge passed through the head, gave  to Mr. Singer the sensation of a violent but universal blow, and was  followed by a transient loss of memory and indistinctness of vision.  If a charge be sent through the head of a bird, its optic nerve is  usually injured or destroyed, and permanent blindness induced; and a  similar shock given to larger animals, produces a tremulous state of  the muscles, with general prostration of strength. If a person who is  standing receive a charge through the spine, he loses his power over  the muscles to such a degree, that he either drops on his knees, or  falls prostrate on the ground; if the charge be sufficiently powerful,  it will produce immediate death, in consequence, probably, of the  sudden exhaustion of the whole energy of the nervous system. Small  animals, such as mice and sparrows, are instantly killed by a shock  from thirty square inches of glass. Van Marum found that eels are  irrecoverably deprived of life when a shock is sent through their  whole body; but when only a part of the body is included in the  circuit, the destruction of irritability is confined to that  individual part, while the rest retains the power of motion. Different  persons are affected in very different degrees by electricity,  according to their peculiar constitutional susceptibility. Dr. Young  remarks, that a very minute tremor, communicated to the most elastic  parts of the body, in particular the chest, produces an agitation of  the nerves, which is not wholly unlike the effect of a weak  electricity.    The bodies of animals killed by electricity, rapidly undergo  putrefaction, and the action of electricity upon the flesh of animals  is also found to accelerate this process in a remarkable degree.  The same effect has been observed in the bodies of persons destroyed  by lightning. It is also a well-established fact, that the blood does  not coagulate after death from this cause.      _Transplanting Shrubs in full Growth_.      Dig a narrow trench round the plant, leaving its roots in the middle  in an isolated ball of earth; fill the trench with plaster of Paris,  which will become hard in a few minutes, and form a case to the ball  and plant, which may be lifted and removed any where at  pleasure.--_French Paper_.      _Freezing Mixture_.      A cheap and powerful freezing mixture may be made by pulverizing  Glauber's salts finely, and placing it level at the bottom of a glass  vessel. Equal parts of sal ammoniac and nitre are then to be finely  powdered, and mixed together, and subsequently added to the Glauber's  salts, stirring the powders well together; after which adding water  sufficient to dissolve the salts, a degree of cold will be produced,  frequently below Zero of Fahrenheit. But Mr. Walker states, that  nitrate of ammonia, phosphate of soda, and diluted nitric acid, will  on the instant produce a reduction of temperature amounting to 80  degrees. It is desirable to reduce the temperature of the substances  previously, if convenient, by placing the vessels in water, with nitre  powder thrown in occasionally.      _Microscopic Examination of the Blood_.      By the aid of Tulley's achromatic microscope, and under highly  magnifying powers, it has recently been discovered that the globules  of the blood congeal into flat circular bodies, and arrange themselves  in rows, one body being placed partly underneath another, and in like  manner as a pile of similar coins, when thrown gently down, would be  found to arrange themselves. This curious effect has been attributed  to the vitality yet remaining in the blood, during the act of  congealing. At any rate it is a most singular fact, for although we  might naturally conceive that the flattened circular plates would  place themselves in juxtaposition, yet we never could have supposed  that they would have partly slipped underneath each other. In order to  make this very curious experiment, it is necessary that the blood, as  freshly drawn, be slightly and thinly smeared over the surface of a  slip of crown, or window glass, and be covered with a very thin slip  of Bohemian plate glass; and thus some slight inequalities in the  thickness of the layer of blood between them will be produced, and  which are necessary to succeed in producing the very curious  appearances abovementioned.--_Gilt's Repository_.      _To make the Liqueur Curacoa_.      Put into a large bottle, nearly filled with alcohol, at thirty-four  degrees of Baume (or thirty-six) the peels of six fine Portugal  oranges, which are smooth skinned, and let them infuse for fifteen  days. At the end of this time, put into a large stone or glass vessel,  11 ounces of brandy at eighteen degrees, 4-1/2 ounces of white sugar,  and 4-1/2 ounces of river water. When the sugar is dissolved, add a  sufficient quantity of the above infusion of orange peels, to give it  a predominant flavour; and aromatise with 3 grammes of fine cinnamon,  and as much mace, both well bruised. Lastly, throw into the liqueur 31  grammes (1 ounce) of Brazil wood, in powder. Leave the whole in  infusion ten days, being stirred three or four times a day. At the end  of this time taste the liqueur; and if it be too strong and sweet, add  more water to it; if too weak, add alcohol, at 30 degrees; and if it  be not sweet enough, put syrup to it. Give it colour with caramel when  you would tinge it.--_From the French_.      _Subterraneous Growth of Potatoes_.      A mixture of two parts Danube sand, and one part common earth, was  laid in a layer an inch thick, in one corner of my cellar; and, in  April, thirty-two yellow potatoes with their skins placed upon its  surface. They threw out stalks on all sides; and, at the end of the  following November, more than a quarter of a bushel of the best  potatoes were gathered, about a tenth part of which were about the  size of apples--the rest as large as nuts. The skin was very thin; the  pulp farinaceous, white, and of a good taste. No attention was given  to the potatoes during the time they remained on the sand, and they  grew without the influence of the sun or light. This trial may be  advantageously applied in fortified places, hospitals, houses of  correction, and, in general, in all places where cellars or  subterraneous places occur, being neither too cold nor too moist; and  where it is important to procure a cheap, but abundant nourishment for  many individuals.--_From the French_.           *       *       *       *       *          Retrospective Gleanings.           *       *       *       *       *      CHILTERN HUNDREDS.      The three Hundreds of Desborough, Stoke, and Burnham, in Bucks, are  called the \"Chiltern Hundreds,\" and take their name from the Chalk  Hills which run through Bucks and the neighbouring counties. The  property of these Hundreds remaining in the Crown, a Steward is  appointed at a salary of 20_s_. and all fees, which nominal office is  accepted by any Member of Parliament who wishes to vacate his seat.           *       *       *       *       *      PEG TANKARDS.      At Braintree and Booking, in Essex, when topers partake of a pot of  ale, it is divided into three parts or draughts, the first of which is  called _neckum_, the second _sinkum_, and the third _swankum_. In  Bailey's Dictionary, _swank_ is said to be \"that remainder of liquor  at the bottom of a tankard, pot, or cup, which is just sufficient for  one draught, which it is not accounted good manners to divide with the  left-hand man, and according to the quantity is called either a large  or little swank.\"           *       *       *       *       *      CHIMNEYS.      Has the precise period been ascertained when chimneys upon the present  mode were first constructed in England? It was apparently not sooner  than Henry the Eighth's time; for Leland, when he visited Bolton  Castle, in Yorkshire, seems to have been greatly surprised by the  novelty and ingenuity of the contrivance. \"One thing (says he) I much  notyd in the haull of Bolton, how chimneys was conveyed by tunnills  made in the sydds of the waulls, betwixt the lights; and by this  meanes is the smoke of the harthe wonder strangely convayed.\"    The front of St. John's Hospital at Lichfield, presents one of the  most curious ancient specimens extant of this part of our early  domestic architecture. This building was erected 1495, but it is  possible that the remarkable chimneys may have been subsequently  added.           *       *       *       *       *      OLD LONDON.
