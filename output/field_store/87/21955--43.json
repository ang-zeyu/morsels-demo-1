The latter, after merely looking over the estate, entered the forest,  in order to visit his relatives there. His fellow monkeys, who knew of  his marriage with the princess, believed him to be of some importance,  and begged him to save them from the famine which was devastating the  forest. This Amo-Mongo, with much boasting of his wealth, promised to  do, declaring that at the time of harvest he would give them plenty  of rice.    When Pusong and his companion returned to the palace they were asked by  the king how many acres they had cleared. They replied that they had  cleared and planted about one thousand acres. The king was satisfied  with their answer, and, at Amo-Mongo's request, gave orders for a  large quantity of rice to be carried from the storehouse to the spot  in the forest where his son-in-law had promised the monkeys that they  should find it.    On the other hand, Singalong during the day did nothing, and as the  king never saw him at work he disliked his third son-in-law very  much. Yet every morning there were great piles of fish and vegetables  in the palace kitchen. Amo-Mongo, knowing that his brother-in-law  usually went out at night in order to bring something home, contrived  to get up early and see what there was in the kitchen, so as to present  it to the king as the result of his own labors. In this way, Amo-Mongo  became each day dearer and dearer to the king, while Singalong became  more and more disliked. Maria knew that her husband procured their  food in some way, for every morning he said to her: \"All that you  see here I have brought.\" However, the king knew nothing of all this.    When the early harvest time came, the king commanded Amo-Mongo to  bring rice to make pilipig. (Rice pounded into flakes and toasted,  a dish of which Filipinos are very fond.) Amo-Mongo did not know  where he could find it, but set out in the direction from which he  had seen Singalong coming each morning, and soon came to an extensive  rice-field bearing an abundant crop. He took a goodly portion of it  and, returning to the palace, had the pilipig prepared and set before  the king and his household. Every one ate of it, except Singalong,  who was the real owner, and his wife, who had been secretly notified  by him of the truth of the matter.    Maria was greatly perplexed by what her husband had told her, so she  determined one night to watch him. She discovered that, as soon as  the other people were asleep, her husband became transformed into  a handsome prince and left the palace, leaving behind him his cat's  dress. As soon as he had gone, Maria took the cast-off clothing of  her husband and cast it into the fire. Singalong smelt it burning and  returned to the palace, where he found his wife and begged her to  return to him his cat's dress. This she was unable to do, since it  was entirely consumed. As a result, Singalong was obliged to retain  the form of a prince, but he was afraid to appear before the king in  this guise, and so hid himself.    In the morning, Maria went to the king and told him the truth about  her husband. Her father, however, thought that she was crazy, and  when she insisted, invited her to accompany him to Amo-Mongo's farm,  in order to convince her of her error. Many people went with them,  and Amo-Mongo led them to the farm, which was really Singalong's,  but told them that it belonged to himself. Besides other things,  Singalong had planted many fruits, among them atimon and candol.    Amo-Mongo, seeing the diversity of fruits, began to eat all he could,  until he became unable to move a step. Whenever his wife urged him  to come away, he would take an atimon under his arm and a candol or  so in his hands, until at last his wife, angry at his greediness,  gave him a push which caused him to fall headlong, striking his head  against a stone and being instantly killed.    Then Singalong, who had secretly followed the crowd from the palace,  showed himself to the king in his proper form. After making suitable  explanations, he led them to a fine palace in the middle of the  hacienda. There they all lived together, but Pusong and his wife,  who in former times had treated Singalong very harshly, giving him  only the bones and scraps from the table, were now obliged to act as  servants in the kitchen of the king's new palace.      CHAPTER 8    The Enchanted Ring.    There was once a king who had suffered for a long time with a painful  disease, in spite of all the efforts of the doctors to cure it. At  last he caused a proclamation to be made that whoever could cure him  should marry his daughter as a reward.    One day a snake appeared before the king and asked permission to cure  him. The king at first refused, but the snake said that his body  contained some gall whose power to cure was wonderful, so the king  consented to try it, and was soon cured.    The snake was really a prince who had been changed into this form  by enchantment. Every night he took on his proper form and went for  a walk around the city. His wife once saw him do this, so she asked  him to tell her the truth. The snake told her his secret, but forbade  her to tell any one, on pain of his leaving her.    One day the other daughters of the king consulted as to how they  should find out the truth about their sister's husband. They took  their sister into the garden and asked her many questions, but Maria  kept silent about the snake's secret. So her sisters fastened her  to a tree at the bottom of which was an ant's nest. Maria could not  long endure the pain of the bites of the ants and told her sisters the  truth. They let her go back home, but she could not find her husband  anywhere, and set out to look for him. She asked the birds she met  if they had seen him, but they answered that they had flown over all  the country around, for hundreds of miles, without seeing him. She  was very sorrowful, and at last, worn out with grief and weariness,  lay down to sleep under a tree which was barren of leaves, except  for three large ones at the very top.    Maria dreamed that her husband was in a house not far away and was  dangerously ill. She dreamed, also, that the leaves on the top  of the tree under which she was sleeping were the only cure for  his sickness. As soon as she awoke, she climbed the tree and got  the leaves and took them with her to the house, where she found her  husband, just as she had dreamed.    When she came to the door of the house she met a black woman whom she  asked about Don Juan, which was the prince's name. The black woman  told her that he was sick, and asked her why she had come. Maria  replied that she had learned of his sickness and had come to cure him  with some leaves. As soon as the negress learned about the leaves,  she took them and gave them to the prince, who immediately recovered  from his sickness.    The prince had promised to marry any woman who could cure him,  and as the black woman had cured him he married her. The negress,  seeing that she was ugly, tried to make Maria so also, so she took  her as a servant and painted her black; but Maria had an enchanted  ring which gave her the power of changing her form. Every night in  her room Maria made use of her ring, obtaining by means of it her  maids of honor, fine dresses, and a band which played sweet music.    It chanced one night that Don Juan was awakened by the sound of  music. He traced it to a certain room, and looking through the keyhole,  saw all that was going on in Maria's room. He was greatly astonished  and stood watching for a long time. Suddenly he saw Maria take from  her ring a pair of scissors. These at a sign suspended themselves in  the air, ready, when Maria should give the signal, to fall and pierce  her heart. Don Juan rushed into the room and caught the scissors just  as they were falling.    Then Maria told him all that had happened to her. She was proclaimed  as the prince's true wife, and the black woman was put to death as  a punishment for her deception.      CHAPTER 9    The Enchanted Shell.    In the olden time there lived a man and his wife who had no son. They  prayed that they might have a son, even if he were only like a little  shell. When their son was born, he was very small, and just like a  shell, so he was named Shell.    One day Shell asked permission of his mother to go and get some  food. His mother at first would not let him, as she was afraid he  would meet some animal which would kill him; but at last she consented,  and he set out.    He went to the river, where some women were catching fish and putting  them into baskets. One of them laid her basket on the grass near  the river and Shell crept into it. In a few minutes the woman picked  up her basket and started for home. All at once Shell began to cry  \"Rain! Rain!\" The woman was so frightened at hearing the fishes talk,  as she supposed, that she threw down her basket and ran away. Then  Shell took the basket full of fish to his mother.    The next day Shell went out again. He saw an old man walking along  the road and carrying the head of a cow, so he followed him. The old  man went into the house of a friend, leaving the cow's head hanging  on the fence. Shell climbed up the fence and got into the cow's ear,  keeping very quiet. When the old man came out of the house he took  the head and continued his walk. As he reached a desert place called  Cahana-an, the head began to say: \"Ay! Ay!\" The old man became so  frightened that he threw the head away, and Shell carried it home.    Days passed. Shell told his mother that he was in love with a beautiful  daughter of the chief and must have her for his wife. The poor mother  was amazed and did not want to present his request to the chief. \"My  dear Shell,\" she said, \"you are beside yourself."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11029"],[0,"American Hero-Myths: A Study in the Native Religions of the Western Continent (#7)"],[1,"to give ground. His son drove  him across rivers and over mountains and lakes, and at last, he came to  the brink of the world. 'Hold!' cried he, 'my son, you know my power, and  that it is impossible to kill me.'\" The combat ceased, the West  acknowledging the Supremacy of his mighty son.[2]    [Footnote 1: In the Ojibway dialect of the Algonkins, the word for day,  sky or heaven, is _gijig_. This same word as a verb means to be an adult,  to be ripe (of fruits), to be finished, complete. Rev. Frederick Baraga,  _A Dictionary of the Olchipwe Language_, Cincinnati, 1853. This seems to  correspond with the statement in the myth.]    [Footnote 2: H.E. Schoolcraft, _Algic Researches_, vol. i, pp. 135, et  seq.]    It is scarcely possible to err in recognizing under this thin veil of  imagery a description of the daily struggle between light and darkness,  day and night. The maiden is the dawn from whose virgin womb rises the sun  in the fullness of his glory and might, but with his advent the dawn  itself disappears and dies. The battle lasts all day, beginning when the  earliest rays gild the mountain tops, and continues until the West is  driven to the edge of the world. As the evening precedes the morning, so  the West, by a figure of speech, may be said to fertilize the Dawn.    In another form of the story the West was typified as a flint stone, and  the twin brother of Michabo. The feud between them was bitter, and the  contest long and dreadful. The face of the land was seamed and torn by the  wrestling of the mighty combatants, and the Indians pointed out the huge  boulders on the prairies as the weapons hurled at each other by the  enraged brothers. At length Michabo mastered his fellow twin and broke him  into pieces. He scattered the fragments over the earth, and from them grew  fruitful vines.    A myth which, like this, introduces the flint stone as in some way  connected with the early creative forces of nature, recurs at other  localities on the American continent very remote from the home of the  Algonkins. In the calendar of the Aztecs the day and god Tecpatl, the  Flint-Stone, held a prominent position. According to their myths such a  stone fell from heaven at the beginning of things and broke into sixteen  hundred pieces, each of which became a god. The Hun-pic-tok, Eight  Thousand Flints, of the Mayas, and the Toh of the Kiches, point to the  same association.[1]    [Footnote 1: Brasseur de Bourbourg, _Dissertation sur les Mythes de  l'Antiquite Americaine_, Sec.vii.]    Probably the association of ideas was not with the flint as a fire-stone,  though the fact that a piece of flint struck with a nodule of pyrites will  emit a spark was not unknown. But the flint was everywhere employed for  arrow and lance heads. The flashes of light, the lightning, anything that  darted swiftly and struck violently, was compared to the hurtling arrow or  the whizzing lance. Especially did this apply to the phenomenon of the  lightning. The belief that a stone is shot from the sky with each  thunderclap is shown in our word \"thunderbolt,\" and even yet the vulgar in  many countries point out certain forms of stones as derived from this  source. As the refreshing rain which accompanies the thunder gust instills  new life into vegetation, and covers the ground parched by summer droughts  with leaves and grass, so the statement in the myth that the fragments of  the flint-stone grew into fruitful vines is an obvious figure of speech  which at first expressed the fertilizing effects of the summer showers.    In this myth Michabo, the Light-God, was represented to the native mind as  still fighting with the powers of Darkness, not now the darkness of night,  but that of the heavy and gloomy clouds which roll up the sky and blind  the eye of day. His weapons are the lightning and the thunderbolt, and the  victory he achieves is turned to the good of the world he has created.    This is still more clearly set forth in an Ojibway myth. It relates that  in early days there was a mighty serpent, king of all serpents, whose home  was in the Great Lakes. Increasing the waters by his magic powers, he  began to flood the land, and threatened its total submergence. Then  Michabo rose from his couch at the sun-rising, attacked the huge reptile  and slew it by a cast of his dart. He stripped it of its skin, and  clothing himself in this trophy of conquest, drove all the other serpents  to the south.[1] As it is in the south that, in the country of the  Ojibways, the lightning is last seen in the autumn, and as the Algonkins,  both in their language and pictography, were accustomed to assimilate the  lightning in its zigzag course to the sinuous motion of the serpent,[2]  the meteorological character of this myth is very manifest.    [Footnote 1: H.R. Schoolcraft, _Algic Researches_, Vol. i, p. 179, Vol.  ii, p. 117. The word _animikig_ in Ojibway means \"it thunders and  lightnings;\" in their myths this tribe says that the West Wind is created  by Animiki, the Thunder. (Ibid. _Indian Tribes_, Vol. v, p. 420.)]    [Footnote 2: When Father Buteux was among the Algonkins, in 1637, they  explained to him the lightning as \"a great serpent which the Manito vomits  up.\" (_Relation de la Nouvelle France_, An. 1637, p. 53.) According to  John Tanner, the symbol for the lightning in Ojibway pictography was a  rattlesnake. (_Narrative_, p. 351.)]    Thus we see that Michabo, the hero-god of the Algonkins, was both the god  of light and day, of the winds and rains, and the creator, instructor and  teacher of mankind. The derivation of his name shows unmistakably that the  earliest form under which he was a mythological existence was as the  light-god. Later he became more familiar as god of the winds and storms,  the hero of the celestial warfare of the air-currents.    This is precisely the same change which we are enabled to trace in the  early transformations of Aryan religion. There, also, the older god of the  sky and light, Dyaus, once common to all members of the Indo-European  family, gave way to the more active deities, Indra, Zeus and Odin,  divinities of the storm and the wind, but which, after all, are merely  other aspects of the ancient deity, and occupied his place to the  religious sense.[1] It is essential, for the comprehension of early  mythology, to understand this twofold character, and to appreciate how  naturally the one merges into and springs out of the other.    [Footnote 1: This transformation is well set forth in Mr. Charles Francis  Keary's _Outlines of Primitive Belief Among the Indo-European Races_  (London, 1882), chaps, iv, vii. He observes: \"The wind is a far more  physical and less abstract conception than the sky or heaven; it is also a  more variable phenomenon; and by reason of both these recommendations the  wind-god superseded the older Dyaus. * * * Just as the chief god of  Greece, having descended to be a divinity of storm, was not content to  remain only that, but grew again to some likeness of the older Dyaus, so  Odhinn came to absorb almost all the qualities which belong of right to a  higher god. Yet he did this without putting off his proper nature. He was  the heaven as well as the wind; he was the All-father, embracing all the  earth and looking down upon mankind.\"]    In almost every known religion the _bird_ is taken as a symbol of the sky,  the clouds and the winds. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that by  the Algonkins birds were considered, especially singing birds, as  peculiarly sacred to Michabo. He was their father and protector. He  himself sent forth the east wind from his home at the sun-rising; but he  appointed an owl to create the north wind, which blows from the realms of  darkness and cold; while that which is wafted from the sunny south is sent  by the butterfly.[1]    [Footnote 1: H.R. Schoolcraft, _Algic Researches_, Vol. i, p. 216. _Indian  Tribes_, Vol. v, p. 420.]    Michabo was thus at times the god of light, at others of the winds, and as  these are the rain-bringers, he was also at times spoken of as the god of  waters. He was said to have scooped out the basins of the lakes and to  have built the cataracts in the rivers, so that there should be fish  preserves and beaver dams.[1]    [Footnote 1: \"Michabou, le Dieu des Eaux,\" etc. Charlevoix, _Journal  Historique_, p. 281 (Paris, 1721).]    In his capacity as teacher and instructor, it was he who had pointed out  to the ancestors of the Indians the roots and plants which are fit for  food, and which are of value as medicine; he gave them fire, and  recommended them never to allow it to become wholly extinguished in their  villages; the sacred rites of what is called the _meday_ or ordinary  religious ceremonial were defined and taught by him; the maize was his  gift, and the pleasant art of smoking was his invention.[1]    [Footnote 1: John Tanner, _Narrative of Captivity and Adventure_, p. 351.  Schoolcraft, _Indian Tribes_, Vol. v, p. 420, etc.]    A curious addition to the story was told the early Swedish settlers on the  river Delaware by the Algonkin tribe which inhabited its shores. These  related that their various arts of domestic life and the chase were taught  them long ago by a venerable and eloquent man who came to them from a  distance, and having instructed them in what was desirable for them to  know, he departed, not to another region or by the natural course of  death, but by ascending into the sky. They added that this ancient and  beneficent teacher _wore a long beard_.[1] We might suspect that this last  trait was thought of after the bearded Europeans had been seen, did it not  occur so often in myths elsewhere on the continent, and in relics of art  finished long before the discovery, that another explanation must be found  for it. What this is I shall discuss when I come to speak of the more  Southern myths, whose heroes were often \"white and bearded men from the  East.\"    [Fo"]]]
