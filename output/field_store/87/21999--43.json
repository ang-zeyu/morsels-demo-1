To Ben Edwards the time was full of diversions, for every afternoon on  his way home from school he stopped at the Kennel to curry and brush  Baldy or help George and Danny in the care of the other dogs whose  condition was of such moment now.    When George felt that he should give Spot special training to fit him  for his new position as leader, or took Queen out under the strict  discipline he knew would be necessary to prepare her for the ordeal, he  would ask Ben to hitch Baldy to one of the small sleds and give him a  run.    Baldy's nature had always expressed itself best in action, and Ben was  delighted with the ease with which he adjusted himself to serious sled  work. There were no more romps, no more games, but his pace became even  and steady, and he required no threats and no inducements to make him do  his best.    \"There's one thing about Baldy,\" admitted George freely, \"you don't have  t' jolly him along all the time. Why, even with Spot I have to say  'Snowbirds' an' 'Rabbits' every little while when I want him to go  faster, an' then you should see him mush. You know that's what Father  says t' Tom, Dick 'an' Harry, an' Rover an' Irish. It's fine with any of  'em that's got bird-dog blood, an' you know Spot's part pointer. O'  course they don't have t' really see snowbirds an' rabbits, but they  just love t' hear about 'em, an' begin t' look ahead right away. An' if  they do happen t' see 'em, they pretty nearly jump out o' their harness,  they're so crazy for 'em.\"    \"Baldy's part bird-dog, too,\" said Ben, \"but I been watchin' him close,  an' it ain't anythin' outside that makes him want t' go; it's more like  he feels a sort o' duty about doin' the very best he kin fer any one  that's usin' him. He's allers willin' t' do more'n his share; an' he's  lots happier when he's workin' hard than when he's just lyin' idle in  the stable, or bein' trotted out by Matt fer a walk.\"    \"I wisht I was like that,\" muttered Danny gloomily. \"That bein' happiest  when you're workin' hard must be great; but I guess it's only dogs an'  mebbe some men that's like that. I don't know o' any boys that's got  such feelin's.\"    [Illustration: NOME, ALASKA, FROM BERING SEA]    When the day of the Boys' Race arrived, a day clear, and beautiful, and  only a degree or two below zero, it seemed as if all of Nome had decided  to celebrate the momentous occasion; going in crowds to the starting  place, which was a broad, open thoroughfare on the outskirts of town.  Those especially interested in the individual teams gathered at the  various kennels to see the dogs harnessed and the young drivers prepared  for their test as trailsmen in the coming struggle.    It was Saturday, and a general holiday, and Ben's mother had given him  permission to go to the Kennel early; so that when George and Dan  arrived they found their dogs smooth and shining from the energetic  grooming that Ben had given them.    \"It's awful good of you, Ben,\" said George appreciatively. \"Danny an' me  came in plenty o' time t' do it ourselves, an' Matt said he'd help us  too; an' now you've got 'em lookin' finer'n silk. I'll bet even  Father'll say they're as fine as a Sweepstakes Team, an' he's mighty  partic'lar, I can tell you. But I don't see how you got Queen t' stand  for it.\"    \"I talked to 'er jest the way you do, an' then walked straight up to 'er  so's she'd see I wasn't afeared. Moose Jones says it's no use tryin' t'  do anything with a dog that knows you're scared. He told me the reason  your father made a good dog out o' Jack McMillan was because he wasn't  afeared of him, an' give the dog an even break in the terrible fight  they had.\"    \"Father always does that,\" responded George proudly. \"He believes you  got t' show a dog once for all that you're master of him at his very  best. If you tie a dog o' McMillan's spirit, an' beat him t' make him  obey, he always thinks he hadn't a fair chance. But if you can show him  that he can't down you, no matter how good a scrap he puts up, he'll  respect you an' like you the way Jack does Dad.\"    \"I don't believe me an' Queen'd ever have any trouble now,\" observed Ben  thoughtfully. \"Some way I guess we kinda understand each other better'n  we did before.\"    \"Well, it sure shows you got courage,\" exclaimed Dan admiringly. \"I  wouldn't touch that snarlin' brute o' George's, not if I could win this  race by it, an' you know what I'd do fer that.\" He examined Judge,  Jimmie, and Pete, with profound satisfaction. They were compactly built,  of an even tan color, short haired, bob-tailed, and all about the same  size, being brothers in one litter. Their sturdy legs suggested strength  and their intelligent faces spoke of amiability as well as alertness.  They were indeed worthy sons of the fleet hound mother--Mego--whose  puppies rank so high in the racing world beyond the frozen sea. \"They  just glisten, Ben. You must 'a' worked hard t' get 'em lookin' as smooth  an' shinin' as the fur neck-pieces the girls wear.\"    \"O' course I wanted t' git Baldy ready fer his first race; an' doin'  little things fer the other dogs is about the only way I kin pay  everybody round here fer all they're doin' fer him.\"    Baldy was fast learning not to despise the detail that had made the new  life so irksome before he realized how necessary it is in a large  Kennel; and he now stood patiently waiting for his harness, while long  discussions took place as to the adjustment of every strap, and the  position of every buckle.    \"Scotty\" and Matt had come in to be ready with counsel and service, if  necessary; then the Allan girls and many of the children from the  neighborhood arrived, and later the Woman appeared with the Big Man whom  Baldy some way associated invariably with her, and a yellow malamute  whom Baldy invariably associated with him.    The Big Man always spoke pleasantly to the dogs, and had won Baldy's  approval by not interfering--as did the Woman--in Kennel affairs; and  the malamute--the Yellow Peril, as the Woman had named him--was plainly  antagonistic to the Racers, at whom he growled with much enthusiasm. And  so Baldy was glad to see the Big Man and the Peril amongst the  acquaintances and strangers who were thronging into the place.    George brought out a miniature racing sled--his most prized  possession--and a perfect reproduction of the one \"Scotty\" used in the  Big Races, being built strongly, but on delicate lines. Danny pulled  another, only a trifle less rakish, beside it. They were conversing in  low tones. \"We got pretty nearly half an hour t' wait, Dan, an' it's  fierce t' have all these people that don't know a blame thing about  racin' standin' round here givin' us fool advice. Why, if we was t' do  what they're tellin', we'd be down an' out before we reached Powell's  dredge on Bourbon Creek. Most of 'em don't know any more 'bout dogs 'n I  do 'bout--'bout--\"    \"'Rithmetic,\" suggested Danny promptly.    \"Well, anyway, we got t' run our own race. Dad says there ain't any cut  an' dried rules for dog racin' beyond knowin' your dogs, an' usin'  common sense. Each time it's different, 'cordin' t' the dogs, the  distance, the trail an' the weather. An' you have t' know just what it's  best t' do whatever happens, even if it never happened before.\"    \"Gee,\" sighed Danny heavily, \"winnin' automobile races an' horse races  is takin' candy from babies besides this here dog racin'. I hadn't any  idea how much there was to it till we begun t' train the dogs, an' talk  it over with your father. I was awful nervous last night, I don't  believe I slept hardly any, worryin' about the things that can go wrong,  no matter how careful you are.\"    \"I didn't sleep any, either. I got t' thinkin' about Queen hatin'  Eskimos, an' chasin' 'em every time she gets a chance. It 'ud be a  terrible thing if she saw one out on the tundra, an' left the trail t'  try and ketch him; or if she smelled some of 'em in the crowd an' made a  break for 'em just when she ought t' be ready t' start. An' you know  there's bound t' be loads of Eskimos, 'cause they'd rather see a dog  race than eat a seal-blubber banquet.\"    \"That's so; but Spot is good friends with all the natives 'round town,  an' he's stronger'n Queen, an' wouldn't leave the trail for anything but  snowbirds or rabbits, so he'd hold 'er down. An' I guess Baldy'd be  kinda neutral, 'cause he don't pay attention t' Eskimos or anything when  he's workin'. I never saw a dog mind his own business like Baldy. That's  worth somethin' in a race.\" The inactivity was becoming unbearable.  \"George, if you and Ben'll get the dogs into harness, I'll go an' see  what's doin' with some of the others. It'll sort o' fill in time.\"    Ben and George hitched the dogs to the respective sleds after Spot, in  the exuberant joy of a prospective run, had dashed madly about, barking  boisterously, a thing absolutely prohibited in that well-ordered  household. \"Scotty\" and Matt refrained from all criticism of George's  leader, knowing that both the boy and dog were unduly excited by the  noisy, laughing groups surrounding them. Queen, while she waited with  very scant patience for the strange situation, diverted herself by  nipping viciously at any one who went past, and Baldy stood quiet and  different save when Ben Edwards was near, or \"Scotty\" spoke kindly to  him.    Mego's sons, as was natural with such a parent, and with Allan's  training since they were born, behaved with perfect propriety; and there  were many compliments for Dan's team, which manifested a polite interest  in the development of affairs.    Shortly Dan returned with somewhat encouraging information about the  rival teams.    \"Bob's got three dogs better matched 'n yours as t' size,\" he remarked  judicially, \"but his leader, old Nero, 's most twelve, you remember, 'nd  wants t' stop an' wag his tail, an' give his paw t' every kid that  speaks to him.

(1) Feats indeed!--the feats of horses with a strong dislike to being  ridden--up to all sorts of ugly and ungainly tricks. On the contrary,  let the horse be taught to be ridden on a loose bridle, and to hold  his head high and arch his neck, and you will practically be making him  perform the very acts which he himself delights or rather exults in; and  the best proof of the pleasure which he takes is, that when he is let  loose with other horses, and more particularly with mares, you will  see him rear his head aloft to the full height, and arch his neck with  nervous vigour, (2) pawing the air with pliant legs (3) and waving his  tail on high. By training him to adopt the very airs and graces which he  naturally assumes when showing off to best advantage, you have got what  you are aiming at--a horse that delights in being ridden, a splendid and  showy animal, the joy of all beholders.     (1) Al. \"the animals are so scared that, the chances are, they are      thrown into disorder.\"     (2) {gorgoumenos}, with pride and spirit, but with a suggestion of      \"fierceness and rage,\" as of Job's war-horse.     (3) \"Mollia crura reponit,\" Virg. \"Georg.\" iii. 76; Hom. \"Hymn. ad      Merc.\"    How these desirable results are, in our opinion, to be produced, we will  now endeavour to explain. In the first place, then, you ought to have  at least two bits. One of these should be smooth, with discs of a good  size; the other should have heavy and flat discs (4) studded with sharp  spikes, so that when the horse seizes it and dislikes the roughness he  will drop it; then when the smooth is given him instead, he is delighted  with its smoothness, and whatever he has learnt before upon the rough,  he will perform with greater relish on the smooth. He may certainly, out  of contempt for its very smoothness, perpetually try to get a purchase  on it, and that is why we attach large discs to the smooth bit, the  effect of which is to make him open his mouth, and drop the mouthpiece.  It is possible to make the rough bit of every degree of roughness by  keeping it slack or taut.     (4) See Morgan, op. cit. p. 144 foll.    But, whatever the type of bit may be, let it in any case be flexible.  If it be stiff, at whatever point the horse seizes it he must take it up  bodily against his jaws; just as it does not matter at what point a  man takes hold of a bar of iron, (5) he lifts it as a whole. The other  flexibly constructed type acts like a chain (only the single point  at which you hold it remains stiff, the rest hangs loose); and while  perpetually hunting for the portion which escapes him, he lets the  mouthpiece go from his bars. (6) For this reason the rings are hung in  the middle from the two axles, (7) so that while feeling for them with  his tongue and teeth he may neglect to take the bit up against his jaws.     (5) Or, \"poker,\" as we might say; lit. \"spit.\"     (6) Schneid. cf. Eur. \"Hippol.\" 1223.     (7) See Morgan, note ad loc. Berenger (i. 261) notes: \"We have a small      chain in the upset or hollow part of our bits, called a 'Player,'      with which the horse playing with his tongue, and rolling it      about, keeps his mouth moist and fresh; and, as Xenophon hints, it      may serve likewise to fix his attention and prevent him from      writhing his mouth about, or as the French call it, 'faire ses      forces.'\"    To explain what is meant by flexible and stiff as applied to a bit, we  will describe the matter. A flexible bit is one in which the axles have  their points of junction broad and smooth, (8) so as to bend easily; and  where the several parts fitting round the axles, being large of aperture  and not too closely packed, have greater flexibility; whereas, if the  several parts do not slide to and fro with ease, and play into each  other, that is what we call a stiff bit. Whatever the kind of bit may  be, the rider must carry out precisely the same rules in using it, as  follows, if he wishes to turn out a horse with the qualities described.  The horse's mouth is not to be pulled back too harshly so as to make  him toss his head aside, nor yet so gently that he will not feel the  pressure. But the instant he raises his neck in answer to the pull, give  him the bit at once; and so throughout, as we never cease repeating, at  every response to your wishes, whenever and wherever the animal performs  his service well, (9) reward and humour him. Thus, when the rider  perceives that the horse takes a pleasure in the high arching and  supple play of his neck, let him seize the instant not to impose severe  exertion on him, like a taskmaster, but rather to caress and coax  him, as if anxious to give him a rest. In this way the horse will be  encouraged and fall into a rapid pace.     (8) i.e. \"the ends of the axles (at the point of junction) which work      into each other are broad and smooth, so as to play freely at the      join.\"     (9) \"Behaves compliantly.\"    That a horse takes pleasure in swift movement, may be shown  conclusively. As soon as he has got his liberty, he sets off at a  trot or gallop, never at a walking pace; so natural and instinctive a  pleasure does this action afford him, if he is not forced to perform  it to excess; since it is true of horse and man alike that nothing is  pleasant if carried to excess. (10)     (10) L. Dind. cf. Eur. \"Med.\" 128, {ta de' uperballont oudena kairon}.    But now suppose he has attained to the grand style when ridden--we have  accustomed him of course in his first exercise to wheel and fall into  a canter simultaneously; assuming then, he has got that lesson well  by heart, if the rider pulls him up with the bit while simultaneously  giving him one of the signals to be off, the horse, galled on the one  hand by the bit, and on the other collecting himself in obedience to the  signal \"off,\" will throw forward his chest and raise his legs aloft with  fiery spirit; though not indeed with suppleness, for the supple play  of the limbs ceases as soon as the horse feels annoyance. But now,  supposing when his fire is thus enkindled (11) you give him the rein,  the effect is instantaneous. Under the pleasurable sense of freedom,  thanks to the relaxation of the bit, with stately bearing and legs  pliantly moving he dashes forward in his pride, in every respect  imitating the airs and graces of a horse approaching other horses.  Listen to the epithets with which spectators will describe the type of  horse: the noble animal! and what willingness to work, what paces, (12)  what a spirit and what mettle; how proudly he bears himself (13)--a joy  at once, and yet a terror to behold.     (11) Cf. \"Hell.\" V. iv. 46, \"kindled into new life.\"     (12) {ipposten}, \"a true soldier's horse.\"     (13) {sobaron}, \"what a push and swagger\"; {kai ama edun te kai gorgon      idein}, \"a la fois doux et terrible a voir,\" see Victor      Cherbuliez, \"Un Cheval de Phidias,\" p. 148.    Thus far on this topic; these notes may serve perhaps to meet a special  need.        XI    If, however, the wish is to secure a horse adapted to parade and state  processions, a high stepper and a showy (1) animal, these are qualities  not to be found combined in every horse, but to begin with, the animal  must have high spirit and a stalwart body. Not that, as some think, a  horse with flexible legs will necessarily be able to rear his body. What  we want is a horse with supple loins, and not supple only but short and  strong (I do not mean the loins towards the tail, but by the belly the  region between the ribs and thighs). That is the horse who will be  able to plant his hind-legs well under the forearm. If while he is so  planting his hind-quarters, he is pulled up with the bit, he lowers his  hind-legs on his hocks (2) and raises the forepart of his body, so that  any one in front of him will see the whole length of his belly to the  sheath. (3) At the moment the horse does this, the rider should give  him the rein, so that he may display the noblest feats which a horse can  perform of his own free will, to the satisfaction of the spectators.     (1) {lampros}. Cf. Isae. xi. 41 (\"On the estate of Hagnias\"), Lys.      xix. 63 (\"de Bon. Arist.\").     (2) See Berenger, ii. 68.     (3) Lit. \"testicles.\"    There are, indeed, other methods of teaching these arts. (4) Some do so  by touching the horse with a switch under the hocks, others employ an  attendant to run alongside and strike the horse with a stick under the  gaskins. For ourselves, however, far the best method of instruction, (5)  as we keep repeating, is to let the horse feel that whatever he does  in obedience to the rider's wishes will be followed by some rest and  relaxation.     (4) Lit. \"People, it must be admitted, claim to teach these arts in      various ways--some by... others by bidding...\"     (5) Reading {didaskalion}, al. {didaskalion}, \"systems.\" Schneid. cf.      Herod. v. 58.    To quote a dictum of Simon, what a horse does under compulsion he does  blindly, and his performance is no more beautiful than would be that of  a ballet-dancer taught by whip and goad. The performances of horse or  man so treated would seem to be displays of clumsy gestures rather than  of grace and beauty. What we need is that the horse should of his own  accord exhibit his finest airs and paces at set signals. (6) Supposing,  when he is in the riding-field, (7) you push him to a gallop until he is  bathed in sweat, and when he begins to prance and show his airs to fine  effect, you promptly dismount and take off the bit, you may rely upon  it he will of his own accord another time break into the same  prancing action. Such are the horses on which gods and heroes ride,  as represented by the artist. The majesty of men themselves is best  discovered in the graceful handling of such animals.
