As Taffy's fingers seemed every moment to become more skillful, the  livelier the music increased, until the very dishes rattled on the  cupboard, as if they wanted to join in. Even the chair looked as if  about to dance.    Just then, Morgan's wife and some neighbors entered the house.  Immediately, the whole party, one and all, began dancing in the  jolliest way. For hours, they kept up the mad whirl. Yet all the  while, Taffy seemed happier and the women the merrier.    No telegraph ever carried the news faster, all over the region, that  Morgan had a wonderful harp.    All the grass in front of the house, was soon worn away by the crowds,  that came to hear and dance. As soon as Taffy touched the harp  strings, the feet of everyone, young and old, began shuffling, nor  could anyone stop, so long as Morgan played. Even very old, lame and  one-legged people joined in. Several old women, whom nobody had ever  prevailed upon to get out of their chairs, were cured of their  rheumatism. Such unusual exercise was severe for them, but it seemed  to be healthful.    A shrewd monk, the business manager of the monastery near by, wanted  to buy Morgan's house, set up a sanatarium and advertise it as a holy  place. He hoped thus to draw pilgrims to it and get for it a great  reputation as a healing place for the lame and the halt, the palsied  and the rheumatic. Thus the monastery would be enriched and all the  monks get fat.    But Taffy was a happy-go-lucky fellow, who cared little about money  and would not sell; for, with his harp, he enjoyed both fun and fame.    One day, in the crowd that stood around his door waiting to begin to  hop and whirl, Morgan espied the bard who had compared his voice to a  cow and a cur. The bard had come to see whether the stories about the  harp were true or not.    He found to his own discomfort what was the fact and the reality,  which were not very convenient for him. As soon as the harp music  began, his feet began to go up, and his legs to kick and whirl. The  more Morgan played, the madder the dance and the wilder the antics of  the crowd, and in these the bard had to join, for he could not help  himself. Soon they all began to spin round and round on the flagstones  fronting the door, as if crazy. They broke the paling of the garden  fence. They came into the house and knocked over the chairs and sofa,  even when they cracked their shins against the wood. They bumped their  heads against the walls and ceiling, and some even scrambled over the  roof and down again. The bard could no more stop his weary legs than  could the other lunatics.    To Morgan his revenge was so sweet, that he kept on until the bard's  legs snapped, and he fell down on top of people that had tumbled from  shear weariness, because no more strength was left in them.    Meanwhile, Morgan laughed until his jaws were tired and his stomach  muscles ached.    But no sooner did he take his fingers off the strings, to rest them,  than he opened his eyes in wonder; for in a flash the harp had  disappeared.    He had made a bad use of the fairies' gift, and they were displeased.  So both the monk and Morgan felt sorry.    Yet the grass grew again when the quondam harper and singer ceased  desolating the air with his quavers. The air seemed sweeter to  breathe, because of the silence.    However, the fairies kept on doing good to the people of good will,  and to-day some of the sweetest singers in Wales come from the poorest  homes.          VII      THE GREAT RED DRAGON OF WALES      Every old country that has won fame in history and built up a  civilization of its own, has a national flower. Besides this, some  living creature, bird, or beast, or, it may be, a fish is on its flag.  In places of honor, it stands as the emblem of the nation; that is, of  the people, apart from the land they live on. Besides flag and symbol,  it has a motto. That of Wales is: \"Awake: It is light.\"    Now because the glorious stories of Wales, Scotland and Ireland have  been nearly lost in that of mighty England, men have at times, almost  forgotten about the leek, the thistle, and the shamrock, which stand  for the other three divisions of the British Isles.    Yet each of these peoples has a history as noble as that of which the  rose and the lion are the emblems. Each has also its patron saint and  civilizer. So we have Saint George, Saint David, Saint Andrew, and  Saint Patrick, all of them white-souled heroes. On the union flag, or  standard of the United Kingdom, we see their three crosses.    The lion of England, the harp of Ireland, the thistle of Scotland, and  the Red Dragon of Wales represent the four peoples in the British  Isles, each with its own speech, traditions, and emblems; yet all in  unity and in loyalty, none excelling the Welsh, whose symbol is the  Red Dragon. In classic phrase, we talk of Albion, Scotia, Cymry, and  Hibernia.    But why red? Almost all the other dragons in the world are white, or  yellow, green or purple, blue, or pink. Why a fiery red color like  that of Mars?    Borne on the banners of the Welsh archers, who in old days won the  battles of Crecy and Agincourt, and now seen on the crests on the town  halls and city flags, in heraldry, and in art, the red dragon is as  rampant, as when King Arthur sat with His Knights at the Round Table.    The Red Dragon has four three-toed claws, a long, barbed tongue, and  tail ending like an arrow head. With its wide wings unfolded, it  guards those ancient liberties, which neither Saxon, nor Norman, nor  German, nor kings on the throne, whether foolish or wise, have ever  been able to take away. No people on earth combine so handsomely loyal  freedom and the larger patriotism, or hold in purer loyalty to the  union of hearts and hands in the British Empire, which the sovereign  represents, as do the Welsh.    The Welsh are the oldest of the British peoples. They preserve the  language of the Druids, bards, and chiefs, of primeval ages which go  back and far beyond any royal line in Europe, while most of their  fairy tales are pre-ancient and beyond the dating.    Why the Cymric dragon is red, is thus told, from times beyond human  record.    It was in those early days, after the Romans in the south had left the  island, and the Cymric king, Vortigern, was hard pressed by the Picts  and Scots of the north. To his aid, he invited over from beyond the  North Sea, or German Ocean, the tribes called the Long Knives, or  Saxons, to help him.    But once on the big island, these friends became enemies and would not  go back. They wanted to possess all Britain.    Vortigern thought this was treachery. Knowing that the Long Knives  would soon attack him, he called his twelve wise men together for  their advice. With one voice, they advised him to retreat westward  behind the mountains into Cymry. There he must build a strong fortress  and there defy his enemies.    So the Saxons, who were Germans, thought they had driven the Cymry  beyond the western borders of the country which was later called  England, and into what they named the foreign or Welsh parts.  Centuries afterwards, this land received the name of Wales.    People in Europe spoke of Galatians, Wallachians, Belgians, Walloons,  Alsatians, and others as \"Welsh.\" They called the new fruit imported  from Asia walnuts, but the names \"Wales\" and \"Welsh\" were unheard of  until after the fifth century.    The place chosen for the fortified city of the Cymry was among the  mountains. From all over his realm, the King sent for masons and  carpenters and collected the materials for building. Then, a solemn  invocation was made to the gods by the Druid priests. These grand  looking old men were robed in white, with long, snowy beards falling  over their breasts, and they had milk-white oxen drawing their  chariot. With a silver knife they cut the mistletoe from the  tree-branch, hailing it as a sign of favor from God. Then with harp,  music and song they dedicated the spot as a stronghold of the Cymric  nation.    Then the King set the diggers to work. He promised a rich reward to  those men of the pick and shovel who should dig the fastest and throw  up the most dirt, so that the masons could, at the earliest moment,  begin their part of the work.    But it all turned out differently from what the king expected. Some  dragon, or powerful being underground, must have been offended by this  invasion of his domain; for, the next morning, they saw that  everything in the form of stone, timber, iron or tools, had  disappeared during the night. It looked as if an earthquake had  swallowed them all up.    Both king and seers, priests and bards, were greatly puzzled at this.  However, not being able to account for it, and the Saxons likely to  march on them at any time, the sovereign set the diggers at work and  again collected more wood and stone.    This time, even the women helped, not only to cook the food, but to  drag the logs and stones. They were even ready to cut off their  beautiful long hair to make ropes, if necessary.    But in the morning, all had again disappeared, as if swept by a  tempest. The ground was bare.    Nevertheless, all hands began again, for all hearts were united.    For the third time, the work proceeded. Yet when the sun rose next  morning, there was not even a trace of either material or labor.    What was the matter? Had some dragon swallowed everything up?    Vortigern again summoned his twelve wise men, to meet in council, and  to inquire concerning the cause of the marvel and to decide what was  to be done.    After long deliberation, while all the workmen and people outside  waited for their verdict, the wise men agreed upon a remedy.    Now in ancient times, it was a custom, all over the world, notably in  China and Japan and among our ancestors, that when a new castle or  bridge was to be built, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9380"],[0,"A Nonsense Anthology (#6)"],[1,"I should never have pains in my back.\"      \"You are old, Father William,\" the young man said,        \"And your legs always get in your way;    You use too much mortar in mixing your bread,        And you try to drink timothy hay.\"      \"Very true, very true,\" said the wretched old man,        \"Every word that you tell me is true;    And it's caused by my having my kerosene can        Painted red where it ought to be blue.\"      \"You are old, Father William,\" the young man said,        \"And your teeth are beginning to freeze,    Your favorite daughter has wheels in her head,        And the chickens are eating your knees.\"      \"You are right,\" said the old man, \"I cannot deny,        That my troubles are many and great,    But I'll butter my ears on the Fourth of July,        And then I'll be able to skate.\"                              _Anonymous_.
