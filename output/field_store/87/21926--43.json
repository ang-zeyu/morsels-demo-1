It \"sends neither  Episcopacy, nor Presbyterianism, nor Independency, but the Gospel of  Christ to the heathen.\" This exactly agreed with my ideas of what a  missionary society ought to do; but it was not without a pang that I  offered myself, for it was not quite agreeable to one accustomed to work  his own way to become in a measure dependent on others; and I would not  have been much put about though my offer had been rejected.    Looking back now on that life of toil, I can not but feel thankful  that it formed such a material part of my early education; and, were  it possible, I should like to begin life over again in the same lowly  style, and to pass through the same hardy training.    Time and travel have not effaced the feelings of respect I imbibed for  the humble inhabitants of my native village. For morality, honesty,  and intelligence, they were, in general, good specimens of the Scottish  poor. In a population of more than two thousand souls, we had, of  course, a variety of character. In addition to the common run of men,  there were some characters of sterling worth and ability, who exerted  a most beneficial influence on the children and youth of the place by  imparting gratuitous religious instruction.* Much intelligent interest  was felt by the villagers in all public questions, and they furnished a  proof that the possession of the means of education did not render them  an unsafe portion of the population. They felt kindly toward each other,  and much respected those of the neighboring gentry who, like the late  Lord Douglas, placed some confidence in their sense of honor. Through  the kindness of that nobleman, the poorest among us could stroll at  pleasure over the ancient domains of Bothwell, and other spots hallowed  by the venerable associations of which our school-books and local  traditions made us well aware; and few of us could view the dear  memorials of the past without feeling that these carefully kept  monuments were our own. The masses of the working-people of Scotland  have read history, and are no revolutionary levelers. They rejoice in  the memories of \"Wallace and Bruce and a' the lave,\" who are still much  revered as the former champions of freedom. And while foreigners imagine  that we want the spirit only to overturn capitalists and aristocracy, we  are content to respect our laws till we can change them, and hate those  stupid revolutions which might sweep away time-honored institutions,  dear alike to rich and poor.       * The reader will pardon my mentioning the names of two of     these most worthy men--David Hogg, who addressed me on his     death-bed with the words, \"Now, lad, make religion the every-     day business of your life, and not a thing of fits and starts;     for if you do not, temptation and other things will get the     better of you;\" and Thomas Burke, an old Forty-second     Peninsula soldier, who has been incessant and never weary in     good works for about forty years. I was delighted to find him     still alive; men like these are an honor to their country and     profession.    Having finished the medical curriculum and presented a thesis on a  subject which required the use of the stethoscope for its diagnosis, I  unwittingly procured for myself an examination rather more severe  and prolonged than usual among examining bodies. The reason was, that  between me and the examiners a slight difference of opinion existed as  to whether this instrument could do what was asserted. The wiser  plan would have been to have had no opinion of my own. However, I was  admitted a Licentiate of Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons. It was  with unfeigned delight I became a member of a profession which is  pre-eminently devoted to practical benevolence, and which with unwearied  energy pursues from age to age its endeavors to lessen human woe.    But though now qualified for my original plan, the opium war was then  raging, and it was deemed inexpedient for me to proceed to China. I had  fondly hoped to have gained access to that then closed empire by means  of the healing art; but there being no prospect of an early peace with  the Chinese, and as another inviting field was opening out through the  labors of Mr. Moffat, I was induced to turn my thoughts to Africa; and  after a more extended course of theological training in England than  I had enjoyed in Glasgow, I embarked for Africa in 1840, and, after a  voyage of three months, reached Cape Town. Spending but a short time  there, I started for the interior by going round to Algoa Bay, and soon  proceeded inland, and have spent the following sixteen years of my  life, namely, from 1840 to 1856, in medical and missionary labors there  without cost to the inhabitants.    As to those literary qualifications which are acquired by habits of  writing, and which are so important to an author, my African life has  not only not been favorable to the growth of such accomplishments, but  quite the reverse; it has made composition irksome and laborious. I  think I would rather cross the African continent again than undertake to  write another book. It is far easier to travel than to write about it.  I intended on going to Africa to continue my studies; but as I could not  brook the idea of simply entering into other men's labors made ready to  my hands, I entailed on myself, in addition to teaching, manual labor  in building and other handicraft work, which made me generally as much  exhausted and unfit for study in the evenings as ever I had been when  a cotton-spinner. The want of time for self-improvement was the only  source of regret that I experienced during my African career. The  reader, remembering this, will make allowances for the mere gropings for  light of a student who has the vanity to think himself \"not yet too old  to learn\". More precise information on several subjects has necessarily  been omitted in a popular work like the present; but I hope to give such  details to the scientific reader through some other channel.

The general instructions I received from the Directors of the London  Missionary Society led me, as soon as I reached Kuruman or Lattakoo,  then, as it is now, their farthest inland station from the Cape, to turn  my attention to the north. Without waiting longer at Kuruman than was  necessary to recruit the oxen, which were pretty well tired by the long  journey from Algoa Bay, I proceeded, in company with another missionary,  to the Bakuena or Bakwain country, and found Sechele, with his tribe,  located at Shokuane. We shortly after retraced our steps to Kuruman; but  as the objects in view were by no means to be attained by a temporary  excursion of this sort, I determined to make a fresh start into the  interior as soon as possible. Accordingly, after resting three months at  Kuruman, which is a kind of head station in the country, I returned to  a spot about fifteen miles south of Shokuane, called Lepelole (now  Litubaruba). Here, in order to obtain an accurate knowledge of the  language, I cut myself off from all European society for about six  months, and gained by this ordeal an insight into the habits, ways of  thinking, laws, and language of that section of the Bechuanas called  Bakwains, which has proved of incalculable advantage in my intercourse  with them ever since.    In this second journey to Lepelole--so called from a cavern of that  name--I began preparations for a settlement, by making a canal to  irrigate gardens, from a stream then flowing copiously, but now quite  dry. When these preparations were well advanced, I went northward to  visit the Bakaa and Bamangwato, and the Makalaka, living between 22  Degrees and 23 Degrees south latitude. The Bakaa Mountains had been  visited before by a trader, who, with his people, all perished from  fever. In going round the northern part of these basaltic hills near  Letloche I was only ten days distant from the lower part of the Zouga,  which passed by the same name as Lake Ngami;* and I might then (in 1842)  have discovered that lake, had discovery alone been my object. Most part  of this journey beyond Shokuane was performed on foot, in consequence  of the draught oxen having become sick. Some of my companions who had  recently joined us, and did not know that I understood a little of their  speech, were overheard by me discussing my appearance and powers: \"He  is not strong; he is quite slim, and only appears stout because he puts  himself into those bags (trowsers); he will soon knock up.\" This caused  my Highland blood to rise, and made me despise the fatigue of keeping  them all at the top of their speed for days together, and until I heard  them expressing proper opinions of my pedestrian powers.       * Several words in the African languages begin with the ringing sound     heard in the end of the word \"comING\".  If the reader puts an 'i'     to the beginning of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10430"],[0,"Trips to the Moon (#7)"],[1,"only business was to cut and polish the ivory, to spread the gold  into various forms, and join them together; their art was properly  to dispose what was put into their hands; and such is the work of  the historians, to dispose and adorn the actions of men, and to make  them known with clearness and precision:  to represent what he hath  heard, as if he had been himself an eye-witness of it.  To perform  this well, and gain the praise resulting from it, is the business of  our historical Phidias.    When everything is thus prepared, he may begin if he pleases without  preface or exordium, unless the subject particularly demands it; he  may supply the place of one, by informing us what he intends to  write upon, in the beginning of the work itself:  if, however, he  makes use of any preface, he need not divide it as our orators do,  into three parts, but confine it to two, leaving out his address to  the benevolence of his readers, and only soliciting their attention  and complacency:  their attention he may be assured of, if he can  convince them that he is about to speak of things great, or  necessary, or interesting, or useful; nor need he fear their want of  complacency, if he clearly explains to them the causes of things,  and gives them the heads of what he intends to treat of.    Such are the exordiums which our best historians have made use of.  Herodotus tells us, \"he wrote his history, lest in process of time  the memory should be lost of those things which in themselves were  great and wonderful, which showed forth the victories of Greece, and  the slaughter of the barbarians;\" and Thucydides sets out with  saying, \"he thought that war most worthy to be recorded, as greater  than any which had before happened; and that, moreover, some of the  greatest misfortunes had accompanied it.\"  The exordium, in short,  may be lengthened or contracted according to the subject matter, and  the transition from thence to the narration easy and natural.  The  body of the history is only a long narrative, and as such it must go  on with a soft and even motion, alike in every part, so that nothing  should stand too forward, or retreat too far behind.  Above all, the  style should be clear and perspicuous, which can only arise, as I  before observed, from a harmony in the composition:  one thing  perfected, the next which succeeds should be coherent with it; knit  together, as it were, by one common chain, which must never be  broken:  they must not be so many separate and distinct narratives,  but each so closely united to what follows, as to appear one  continued series.    Brevity is always necessary, especially when you have a great deal  to say, and this must be proportioned to the facts and circumstances  which you have to relate.  In general, you must slightly run through  little things, and dwell longer on great ones.  When you treat your  friends, you give them boars, hares, and other dainties; you would  not offer them beans, saperda, {66a} or any other common food.    When you describe mountains, rivers, and bulwarks, avoid all pomp  and ostentation, as if you meant to show your own eloquence; pass  over these things as slightly as you can, and rather aim at being  useful and intelligible.  Observe how the great and sublime Homer  acts on these occasions! as great a poet as he is, he says nothing  about Tantalus, Ixion, Tityus, and the rest of them.  But if  Parthenius, Euphorion, or Callimachus, had treated this subject,  what a number of verses they would have spent in rolling Ixion's  wheel, and bringing the water up to the very lips of Tantalus!  Mark, also, how quickly Thucydides, who is very sparing {66b} of his  descriptions, breaks off when he gives an account of any military  machine, explains the manner of a siege, even though it be ever so  useful and necessary, or describes cities or the port of Syracuse.  Even in his narrative of the plague which seems so long, if you  consider the multiplicity of events, you will find he makes as much  haste as possible, and omits many circumstances, though he was  obliged to retain so many more.    When it is necessary to make any one speak, you must take care to  let him say nothing but what is suitable to the person, and to what  he speaks about, and let everything be clear and intelligible:  here, indeed, you may be permitted to play the orator, and show the  power of eloquence.  With regard to praise, or dispraise, you cannot  be too modest and circumspect; they should be strictly just and  impartial, short and seasonable:  your evidence otherwise will not  be considered as legal, and you will incur the same censure as  Theopompus {67} did, who finds fault with everybody from enmity and  ill-nature; and dwells so perpetually on this, that he seems rather  to be an accuser than an historian.    If anything occurs that is very extraordinary or incredible, you may  mention without vouching for the truth of it, leaving everybody to  judge for themselves concerning it:  by taking no part yourself, you  will remain safe.    Remember, above all, and throughout your work, again and again, I  must repeat it, that you write not with a view to the present times  only, that the age you live in may applaud and esteem you, but with  an eye fixed on posterity; from future ages expect your reward, that  men may say of you, \"that man was full of honest freedom, never  flattering or servile, but in all things the friend of truth.\"  This  commendation, the wise man will prefer to all the vain hopes of this  life, which are but of short duration.    Recollect the story of the Cnidian architect, when he built the  tower in Pharos, where the fire is kindled to prevent mariners from  running on the dangerous rocks of Paraetonia, that most noble and  most beautiful of all works; he carved his own name on a part of the  rock on the inside, then covered it over with mortar, and inscribed  on it the name of the reigning sovereign:  well knowing that, as it  afterwards happened, in a short space of time these letters would  drop off with the mortar, and discover under it this inscription:  \"Sostratus the Cnidian, son of Dexiphanes, to those gods who  preserve the mariner.\"  Thus had he regard not to the times he lived  in, not to his own short existence, but to the present period, and  to all future ages, even as long as his tower shall stand, and his  art remain upon earth.    Thus also should history be written, rather anxious to gain the  approbation of posterity by truth and merit, than to acquire present  applause by adulation and falsehood.    Such are the rules which I would prescribe to the historian, and  which will contribute to the perfection of his work, if he thinks  proper to observe them; if not, at least, I have rolled my tub. {69}        THE TRUE HISTORY.        BOOK I.      Lucian's True History is, as the author himself acknowledges in the  Preface to it, a collection of ingenious lies, calculated  principally to amuse the reader, not without several allusions, as  he informs us, to the works of ancient Poets, Historians, and  Philosophers, as well as, most probably, the performances of  contemporary writers, whose absurdities are either obliquely glanced  at, or openly ridiculed and exposed.  We cannot but lament that the  humour of the greatest part of these allusions must be lost to us,  the works themselves being long since buried in oblivion.  Lucian's  True History, therefore, like the Duke of Buckingham's Rehearsal,  cannot be half so agreeable as when it was first written; there is,  however, enough remaining to secure it from contempt.  The vein of  rich fancy, and wildness of a luxuriant imagination, which run  through the whole, sufficiently point out the author as a man of  uncommon genius and invention.  The reader will easily perceive that  Bergerac, Swift, and other writers have read this work of Lucian's,  and are much indebted to him for it.      PREFACE.      As athletics of all kinds hold it necessary, not only to prepare the  body by exercise and discipline, but sometimes to give it proper  relaxation, which they esteem no less requisite, so do I think it  highly necessary also for men of letters, after their severer  studies, to relax a little, that they may return to them with the  greater pleasure and alacrity; and for this purpose there is no  better repose than that which arises from the reading of such books  as not only by their humour and pleasantry may entertain them, but  convey at the same time some useful instruction, both which, I  flatter myself, the reader will meet with in the following history;  for he will not only be pleased with the novelty of the plan, and  the variety of lies, which I have told with an air of truth, but  with the tacit allusions so frequently made, not, I trust, without  some degree of humour, to our ancient poets, historians, and  philosophers, who have told us some most miraculous and incredible  stories, and which I should have pointed out to you, but that I  thought they would be sufficiently visible on the perusal.    Ctesias the Cnidian, son of Ctesiochus, wrote an account of India  and of things there, which he never saw himself, nor heard from  anybody else.  Iambulus also has acquainted us with many wonders  which he met with in the great sea, and which everybody knew to be  absolute falsehoods:  the work, however, was not unentertaining.  Besides these, many others have likewise presented us with their own  travels and peregrinations, where they tell us of wondrous large  beasts, savage men, and unheard-of ways of living.  The great leader  and master of all this rhodomontade is Homer's \"Ulysses,\" who talks  to Alcinous about the winds {75} pent up in bags, man-eaters, and  one-eyed Cyclops, wild men, creatures with many heads, several of  his companions turned into beasts by enchantment, and a thousand  things of this kind, which he related to the ignorant and credulous  Phaeacians.
