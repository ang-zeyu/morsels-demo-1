The carriage drove off with the fugitives at the full speed of a pair  of spirited Flemish horses. Rosa followed them with her eyes until they  turned the corner of the street, upon which, closing the door after her,  she went back and threw the key into a cell.    The noise which had made Rosa suppose that the people were forcing the  prison door was indeed owing to the mob battering against it after the  square had been left by the military.    Solid as the gate was, and although Gryphus, to do him justice, stoutly  enough refused to open it, yet evidently it could not resist much  longer, and the jailer, growing very pale, put to himself the question  whether it would not be better to open the door than to allow it to be  forced, when he felt some one gently pulling his coat.    He turned round and saw Rosa.    \"Do you hear these madmen?\" he said.    \"I hear them so well, my father, that in your place----\"    \"You would open the door?\"    \"No, I should allow it to be forced.\"    \"But they will kill me!\"    \"Yes, if they see you.\"    \"How shall they not see me?\"    \"Hide yourself.\"    \"Where?\"    \"In the secret dungeon.\"    \"But you, my child?\"    \"I shall get into it with you. We shall lock the door and when they have  left the prison, we shall again come forth from our hiding place.\"    \"Zounds, you are right, there!\" cried Gryphus; \"it's surprising how much  sense there is in such a little head!\"    Then, as the gate began to give way amidst the triumphant shouts of the  mob, she opened a little trap-door, and said,--    \"Come along, come along, father.\"    \"But our prisoners?\"    \"God will watch over them, and I shall watch over you.\"    Gryphus followed his daughter, and the trap-door closed over his head,  just as the broken gate gave admittance to the populace.    The dungeon where Rosa had induced her father to hide himself, and where  for the present we must leave the two, offered to them a perfectly safe  retreat, being known only to those in power, who used to place there  important prisoners of state, to guard against a rescue or a revolt.    The people rushed into the prison, with the cry--    \"Death to the traitors! To the gallows with Cornelius de Witt! Death!  death!\"          Chapter 4. The Murderers      The young man with his hat slouched over his eyes, still leaning on the  arm of the officer, and still wiping from time to time his brow with his  handkerchief, was watching in a corner of the Buytenhof, in the shade  of the overhanging weather-board of a closed shop, the doings of the  infuriated mob, a spectacle which seemed to draw near its catastrophe.    \"Indeed,\" said he to the officer, \"indeed, I think you were right,  Van Deken; the order which the deputies have signed is truly the  death-warrant of Master Cornelius. Do you hear these people? They  certainly bear a sad grudge to the two De Witts.\"    \"In truth,\" replied the officer, \"I never heard such shouts.\"    \"They seem to have found out the cell of the man. Look, look! is not  that the window of the cell where Cornelius was locked up?\"    A man had seized with both hands and was shaking the iron bars of the  window in the room which Cornelius had left only ten minutes before.    \"Halloa, halloa!\" the man called out, \"he is gone.\"    \"How is that? gone?\" asked those of the mob who had not been able to get  into the prison, crowded as it was with the mass of intruders.    \"Gone, gone,\" repeated the man in a rage, \"the bird has flown.\"    \"What does this man say?\" asked his Highness, growing quite pale.    \"Oh, Monseigneur, he says a thing which would be very fortunate if it  should turn out true!\"    \"Certainly it would be fortunate if it were true,\" said the young man;  \"unfortunately it cannot be true.\"    \"However, look!\" said the officer.    And indeed, some more faces, furious and contorted with rage, showed  themselves at the windows, crying,--    \"Escaped, gone, they have helped them off!\"    And the people in the street repeated, with fearful imprecations,--    \"Escaped gone! After them, and catch them!\"    \"Monseigneur, it seems that Mynheer Cornelius has really escaped,\" said  the officer.    \"Yes, from prison, perhaps, but not from the town; you will see, Van  Deken, that the poor fellow will find the gate closed against him which  he hoped to find open.\"    \"Has an order been given to close the town gates, Monseigneur?\"    \"No,--at least I do not think so; who could have given such an order?\"    \"Indeed, but what makes your Highness suppose?\"    \"There are fatalities,\" Monseigneur replied, in an offhand manner; \"and  the greatest men have sometimes fallen victims to such fatalities.\"    At these words the officer felt his blood run cold, as somehow or other  he was convinced that the prisoner was lost.    At this moment the roar of the multitude broke forth like thunder, for  it was now quite certain that Cornelius de Witt was no longer in the  prison.        Cornelius and John, after driving along the pond, had taken the main  street, which leads to the Tol-Hek, giving directions to the coachman to  slacken his pace, in order not to excite any suspicion.    But when, on having proceeded half-way down that street, the man felt  that he had left the prison and death behind, and before him there was  life and liberty, he neglected every precaution, and set his horses off  at a gallop.    All at once he stopped.    \"What is the matter?\" asked John, putting his head out of the coach  window.    \"Oh, my masters!\" cried the coachman, \"it is----\"    Terror choked the voice of the honest fellow.    \"Well, say what you have to say!\" urged the Grand Pensionary.    \"The gate is closed, that's what it is.\"    \"How is this? It is not usual to close the gate by day.\"    \"Just look!\"    John de Witt leaned out of the window, and indeed saw that the man was  right.    \"Never mind, but drive on,\" said John, \"I have with me the order for the  commutation of the punishment, the gate-keeper will let us through.\"    The carriage moved along, but it was evident that the driver was no  longer urging his horses with the same degree of confidence.    Moreover, as John de Witt put his head out of the carriage window, he  was seen and recognized by a brewer, who, being behind his companions,  was just shutting his door in all haste to join them at the Buytenhof.  He uttered a cry of surprise, and ran after two other men before him,  whom he overtook about a hundred yards farther on, and told them what he  had seen. The three men then stopped, looking after the carriage, being  however not yet quite sure as to whom it contained.    The carriage in the meanwhile arrived at the Tol-Hek.    \"Open!\" cried the coachman.    \"Open!\" echoed the gatekeeper, from the threshold of his lodge; \"it's  all very well to say 'Open!' but what am I to do it with?\"    \"With the key, to be sure!\" said the coachman.    \"With the key! Oh, yes! but if you have not got it?\"    \"How is that? Have not you got the key?\" asked the coachman.    \"No, I haven't.\"    \"What has become of it?\"    \"Well, they have taken it from me.\"    \"Who?\"    \"Some one, I dare say, who had a mind that no one should leave the  town.\"    \"My good man,\" said the Grand Pensionary, putting out his head from the  window, and risking all for gaining all; \"my good man, it is for me,  John de Witt, and for my brother Cornelius, who I am taking away into  exile.\"    \"Oh, Mynheer de Witt! I am indeed very much grieved,\" said the  gatekeeper, rushing towards the carriage; \"but, upon my sacred word, the  key has been taken from me.\"    \"When?\"    \"This morning.\"    \"By whom?\"    \"By a pale and thin young man, of about twenty-two.\"    \"And wherefore did you give it up to him?\"    \"Because he showed me an order, signed and sealed.\"    \"By whom?\"    \"By the gentlemen of the Town-hall.\"    \"Well, then,\" said Cornelius calmly, \"our doom seems to be fixed.\"    \"Do you know whether the same precaution has been taken at the other  gates?\"    \"I do not.\"    \"Now then,\" said John to the coachman, \"God commands man to do all that  is in his power to preserve his life; go, and drive to another gate.\"    And whilst the servant was turning round the vehicle the Grand  Pensionary said to the gatekeeper,--    \"Take our thanks for your good intentions; the will must count for the  deed; you had the will to save us, and that, in the eyes of the Lord, is  as if you had succeeded in doing so.\"    \"Alas!\" said the gatekeeper, \"do you see down there?\"    \"Drive at a gallop through that group,\" John called out to the coachman,  \"and take the street on the left; it is our only chance.\"    The group which John alluded to had, for its nucleus, those three men  whom we left looking after the carriage, and who, in the meanwhile, had  been joined by seven or eight others.    These new-comers evidently meant mischief with regard to the carriage.    When they saw the horses galloping down upon them, they placed  themselves across the street, brandishing cudgels in their hands, and  calling out,--    \"Stop! stop!\"    The coachman, on his side, lashed his horses into increased speed, until  the coach and the men encountered.    The brothers De Witt, enclosed within the body of the carriage, were not  able to see anything; but they felt a severe shock, occasioned by the  rearing of the horses. The whole vehicle for a moment shook and stopped;  but immediately after, passing over something round and elastic, which  seemed to be the body of a prostrate man set off again amidst a volley  of the fiercest oaths.    \"Alas!\" said Cornelius, \"I am afraid we have hurt some one.\"    \"Gallop! gallop!\" called John.    But, notwithstanding this order, the coachman suddenly came to a stop.    \"Now, then, what is the matter again?\" asked John.    \"Look there!\" said the coachman.    John looked. The whole mass of the populace from the Buytenhof appeared  at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],[0,"Independent Bohemia (#6)"],[1,"and absolutism.    2. In the first Austrian Parliament of 1848, eighty-eight Czech deputies  formed a united _Nationalist Party_ (later on called the _Old Czech  Party_), led by Palacky, Rieger and Brauner. They formed the Right wing  which stood for democratic and federalist ideals. The Left was formed by  the Germans who stood for centralism and a close union with Germany. Only  an insignificant number of Germans formed the Centre which stood for the  preservation of Austria.    In October, 1848, fresh troubles broke out in Vienna, partly directed  against the presence of the Czechs. On November 15, the parliament was  summoned to Kremsier, in which the Czechs, Ruthenes, Yugoslavs and some  Poles formed a Slav _bloc_ of 120 members. On December 2, Francis Joseph  ascended the throne, and a constitution was proposed by a parliamentary  committee of which Rieger was a member. The proposal was opposed by the  government, because it defined \"the people's sovereignty as the foundation  of the power of the State,\" and not the dynasty. On March 6, 1849, the  parliament was dissolved and a constitution imposed by an imperial decree.    The _Czech Radical Democrats_, led by Fric, Sabina and Sladkovsky, who  already in 1848 stood for a more radical policy than that of the Liberal  Nationalists led by Palacky, now again thought of organising an armed  revolt against Austria. But the leaders of the conspiracy were arrested and  sentenced to many years' imprisonment. After the Austrian victories in  Italy and the collapse of the Hungarian revolution, absolutism again  reigned supreme.    During the ten years that followed, Bach tried, relying upon the army and  the hierarchy, to centralise and germanise the empire. In January, 1850,  Havlicek's _Narodni Noviny_ was suppressed and later, also, three of the  other remaining Czech journals. Palacky openly declared that he abandoned  political activity and Rieger went abroad. Havlicek continued to work for  the national cause under great difficulties, until he was arrested in  December, 1851, and interned without a trial in Tyrol where he contracted  an incurable illness to which he succumbed in 1856. Even as late as 1859  the Czechs were not allowed to publish a political newspaper.    3. After the defeats at Magenta and Solferino in 1859, Austria began to see  the impossibility of a continued rule of terrorism and absolutism. Bach was  obliged to resign, and on March 5, 1860, a state council was summoned to  Vienna. Bohemia was represented only by the nobility who had no sympathy  with the Czech national cause, and on September 24 the Rumanian delegate,  Mosconyi, openly deplored the fact that \"the brotherly Czech nation was not  represented.\"    The era of absolutism was theoretically ended by the so-called \"October  Diploma\" of 1860, conferring on Austria a constitution which in many  respects granted self-government to Hungary, but ignored Bohemia, although  formally admitting her historical rights. This \"lasting and irrevocable  Constitution of the Empire\" was revoked on February 26, 1861, when  Schmerling succeeded Goluchowski, and the so-called \"February Constitution\"  was introduced by an arbitrary decree which in essence was still more  dualistic than the October Diploma and gave undue representation to the  nobility. The Czechs strongly opposed it and sent a delegation on April 14  to the emperor, who assured them on his royal honour of his desire to be  crowned King of Bohemia.    In the meantime Dr. Gregr founded the _Narodni Listy_ in Prague in  November, 1860, to support the policy of Rieger, and in January, 1861, the  latter, with the knowledge of Palacky, concluded an agreement with  Clam-Martinic on behalf of the Bohemian nobility, by which the latter,  recognising the rights of the Bohemian State to independence, undertook to  support the Czech policy directed against the centralism of Vienna. The  Bohemian nobility, who were always indifferent in national matters and who  had strong conservative and clerical leanings, concluded this pact with the  Czech democrats purely for their own class interests This unnatural  alliance had a demoralising influence on the Old Czech Party and finally  brought about its downfall.    The Czechs elected two delegates to the parliament summoned for April 29,  1861, while Hungary and Dalmatia sent none, so that the parliament had 203  instead of 343 deputies. In the Upper House the Czechs were represented by  Palacky. In the Lower House the Slavs, forming a united body, again found  themselves in a hopeless minority which was absolutely powerless against  the government. In June, 1863, the Czechs decided not to attend the chamber  again, seeing that all hopes of a modification of the constitution in the  sense of the October Diploma were in vain. The government replied by  depriving them of their mandates and by suspending the constitution in  1865. A period of \"Sistierung,\" that is of veiled absolutism, then set in.    4. In the meantime, a new political group came to the front in Bohemia,  called the Young Czechs. The party was led by Sladkovsky, and had more  democratic leanings than the Old Czechs. In the diet, however, the Czechs  remained united in a single body. The Young Czechs opposed the policy of  passive resistance which the Old Czechs pursued for fully sixteen years,  that is up to 1879. The Young Czechs clearly saw that it enabled Vienna to  rule without the Czechs and against them. The Czechs, of course, still  reckoned upon the break-up of Austria, although, as we shall see later on,  they failed entirely to profit from Austria's difficulties in that period.  In 1865 Rieger openly warned Austria:        \"Those who direct the destinies of Austria should remember that      institutions based on injustice and violence have no duration. If you      desire to save Austria, the whole of Austria, you must make justice the      basis of your policy towards the Slavs. Do not then say that we did not      warn you. _Discite justitiam moniti_.\"    In the same sense also Palacky warned the government against dualism,  pointing out that if it were introduced it would inevitably lead to the  break-up of Austria. Seeing that Austria did not listen to his warning, he  later on declared that he no longer believed in the future of Austria, and  added: \"We existed before Austria, we shall also exist after her.\"    The greatest mistake the Czechs made was when in 1866, after the battle of  Sadova, they thought that Austria would cease to be the bulwark of  Pan-Germanism and would do justice to her subject Slavs, and thus become a  protection against Germany. It is true that Austria did cease to be the  head of the Pan-German Confederation, but instead of becoming a bulwark  against Prussia, she became her faithful ally and obedient tool. The  Czechs, who feared lest they should be annexed by Prussia, failed to grasp  the subtle plans of Bismarck who in a short time succeeded in converting  Austria into Germany's bridge to the East.    When the victorious Prussians entered Prague in 1866, they issued a  proclamation to the Czechs recognising their right to independence. This  proclamation was probably drafted by the Czech exile J.V. Fric, an ardent  democrat who fled abroad after the abortive revolution of 1848. Fric, who  was a man of keen sense for political reality and a great friend of the  Poles, exerted all his influence with the Czech leaders to proclaim Bohemia  independent, without an armed revolt, simply by means of a plebiscite, as  he was aware that the masses were always thoroughly anti-Austrian and  desired nothing more than independence. He proposed to his  fellow-countrymen to establish a monarchy, with some other dynasty than the  Habsburgs on the throne, preferably the youngest son of the Italian king,  Victor Emmanuel. Even while peace negotiations between Prussia and Austria  were going on, he conducted an active propaganda and distributed a  proclamation all over Bohemia in which he declared himself as \"the deadly  enemy of the Habsburg dynasty and of Austrian militarism and bureaucracy\":        \"The Hungarians are preparing, the Yugoslavs are ready. Let us come to      a common agreement with them and we shall succeed. And when all the      Austrian nations have been freed they may form a great federation on      the basis of international law which will be an example to Europe. _A      federation without the freedom and independence of the nations who form      part of it is an empty dream. Let him who desires a federation work for      the independence of his nation first_. It is not a question of a      revolution, it is a question of a public proclamation of the Czech      nation so that Europe may realise that we live and what we want. Europe      will surely lend us a helping hand, but she expects us to ask for it.      Let us therefore, my brother Czecho-Slovaks, proclaim aloud, so that      the whole world may hear us: '_We do not want Austria because we      realise that she not only does no good to us, but directly threatens      our very existence. We are able to and want to maintain an independent      state existence without Austria_.\"    Unfortunately, however, the Czech leaders at that time did not follow  Fric's advice and, as we have already pointed out, they fell into  Bismarck's trap.    In November, 1866, the Bohemian Diet uttered a warning against the danger  of dualism, pointing out that Bohemia had the same right to independence as  Hungary. Relying upon the support of the other Slav races of Austria, the  Czechs declared they would never enter the Reichsrat.    In February, 1867, Beust concluded an agreement with Hungary, and on  December 21 the \"December Constitution\" was introduced. Thus _dualism_  became a _fait accompli_.    5. Exasperated by this step, the Czech leaders visited Moscow in the same  year and fraternised with the Russians, thus showing their hostility to "]]]
