In Santa Clara and Camaguey, the range is represented by crest  lines and plateaus along the north shore, and finally runs into the hill  and mountain maze of Oriente. In the south-central section of the island, a  somewhat isolated group of elevations appears, culminating in El Potrerillo  at a height of nearly 3,000 feet. In Oriente, immediately along the south  coast line, is the precipitous Sierra Maestra, reaching its greatest  altitude in the Pico del Turquino, with an elevation of approximately  8,500 feet. Another elevation, near Santiago, known as La Gran Piedra, is  estimated at 5,200 feet. All these heights are densely wooded. From the  tops of some of them, east, west, and central, the views are marvellously  beautiful, but the summits of most are reached only with considerable  difficulty. One of the most notable of these view points, and one of the  most easily reached, is the height immediately behind the city of Matanzas,  overlooking the famous Yumuri valley. The valley is a broad, shallow bowl,  some five or six miles in diameter, enclosed by steeply sloping walls of  five to six hundred feet in height. Through it winds the Yumuri River. It  is best seen in the early forenoon, or the late afternoon, when there come  the shadows and the lights that are largely killed by the more vertical  rays of a midday sun. At those hours, it is a scene of entrancing  loveliness. There are views, elsewhere, covering wider expanses, but none,  I think, of equal beauty.    The vicinity of Matanzas affords a spectacle of almost enchantment for the  sight-seer, and of deep interest for the geologist. Somewhat more than  fifty years ago, an accident revealed the beautiful caves of Bellamar, two  or three miles from the city, and easily reached by carriage. Caves ought  to be cool. These are not, but they are well worth all the perspiration it  costs to see them. They are a show place, and guides are always available.  In size, the caverns are not comparable with the caves of Kentucky and  Virginia, but they far excel in beauty. They are about three miles in  extent, and their lower levels are said to be about five hundred feet  from the surface. The rock is white limestone, in which are chambers and  passage-ways, stalactites and stalagmites innumerable. These have their  somewhat fantastic but not unfitting names, such as the Gothic Temple, the  Altar, the Guardian Spirit, the Fountain of Snow, and Columbus' Mantle.  The place has been called \"a dream of fairyland,\" a fairly appropriate  description. The colors are snow-white, pink, and shades of yellow, and  many of the forms are wonderfully beautiful. There are many other caves in  the island, like Cotilla, in the Guines region not far from Havana, others  in the Cubitas Mountains in Camaguey Province, and still others in Oriente,  but in comparison with Bellamar they are little else than holes in the  ground. The trip through these remarkable aisles and chambers occupies some  three or four hours.    Cuba is not big enough for rivers of size. There are innumerable streams,  for the island generally is well-watered. The only river of real importance  is the Cauto, in Oriente Province. This is the longest and the largest  river in the island. It rises in the hills north of Santiago, and winds a  devious way westward for about a hundred and fifty miles, emptying at last  into the Gulf of Buena Esperanza, north of the city of Manzanillo. It  is navigable for small boats, according to the stage of the water, from  seventy-five to a hundred miles from its mouth. Numerous smaller streams  flow to the coast on both north and south. Some, that are really estuaries,  are called rivers. Very few of them serve any commercial purposes. There  are a few water areas called lakes, but they are really little other than  ponds. On the south coast, directly opposite Matanzas, lies a vast swamp  known as the Cienega de Zapata. It occupies an area of about seventy-five  miles in length and about thirty miles in width, almost a dead flat, and  practically at sea-level. Here and there are open spaces of water or  clusters of trees, but most of it is bog and quagmire and dense mangrove  thickets. Along the coast are numerous harbors, large and small, that are  or, by dredging, could be made available for commercial purposes. Among  these, on the north coast, from west to east, are Bahia Honda, Mariel,  Havana, Matanzas, Nuevitas, Nipe Bay, and Baracoa. On the south, from east  to west, are Guantanamo, Santiago, Manzanillo, Cienfuegos, and Batabano. At  all of these, there are now cities or towns with trade either by steamers  or small sailing vessels. Among the interesting physical curiosities of  the island are the numerous \"disappearing rivers.\" Doubtless the action  of water on limestone has left, in many places, underground chambers and  tunnels into which the streams have found an opening and in which they  disappear, perhaps to emerge again and perhaps to find their way to the sea  without reappearance. This seems to explain numerous fresh-water springs  among the keys and off-shore. The Rio San Antonio quite disappears near San  Antonio de los Banos. Near Guantanamo, a cascade drops three hundred feet  into a cavern and reappears a short distance away. Such disappearing rivers  are not unknown elsewhere but Cuba has several of them.           *       *       *       *       *    The Census Report of 1907, prepared under American auspices, states that  \"the climate of Cuba is tropical and insular. There are no extremes of  heat, and there is no cold weather.\" This is quite true if the records of a  thermometer are the standard; quite untrue if measured by the sensations of  the human body. It is true that, in Havana, for instance, the thermometer  seldom exceeds 90 deg. in the hottest months, and rarely if ever goes below 50 deg.  in the coldest. But a day with the thermometer anywhere in the 80s may seem  to a northern body very hot, and a day with the thermometer in the 50s  is cold for anyone, whether a native or a visitor. There is doubtless a  physical reason for the fact that a hot day in the north seems hotter than  the same temperature in the south, while a day that seems, in the north,  only pleasantly cool, seems bitterly cold in the tropics. When the  thermometer drops below 60 deg. in Havana, the coachmen blanket their horses,  the people put on all the clothes they have, and all visitors who are  at all sensitive to low temperature go about shivering. Steam heat and  furnaces are unknown, and fireplaces are a rarity. Yet, in general, the  variations are not wide, either from day to day or when measured by  seasons. The extremes are the infrequent exceptions. Nor is there wide  difference between day and night. Taking the island as a whole, the average  mean temperature for July, the hottest month, is about 82 deg., and for  January, the coolest month, about 71 deg.. The mean for the year is about 77 deg.,  as compared with 52 deg. for New York, 48 deg. for Chicago, 62 deg. for Los Angeles,  and 68 deg. for New Orleans. There are places that, by reason of exposure to  prevailing winds, or distance from the coast, are hotter or cooler than  other places. Havana is one of the cool spots, that is, relatively cool.  But no one goes there in search of cold. The yearly range in Havana, from  maximum to minimum, rarely if ever exceeds fifty degrees, and is usually  somewhat below that, while the range in New York, Chicago, and St. Louis  is usually from one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five degrees. The  particular cause of discomfort for those unused to it, is the humidity that  prevails throughout the greater part of the year. The worst season for  this, however, is the mid-year months when few people visit the island. The  winter months, locally known as the \"_invierno_,\" a term to be associated  with our word \"vernal\" and not with \"infernal,\" are almost invariably  delightful, bringing to northern systems a pleasurable physical laziness  that is attended by a mental indifference to, or satisfaction with, the  sensation.    [Illustration: WATERING HERD OF CATTLE _Luyano River near Havana_]    The rainfall varies so widely in different parts of the island, and from  year to year, that exact information is difficult. Taken as a whole, it is  little if at all greater than it is in most places in the United States. We  have our arid spots, like El Paso, Fresno, Boise, Phoenix, and Winnemucca,  where only a few inches fall in a year, just as Cuba has a few places where  the fall may reach sixty-five or seventy inches in a year. But the average  fall in Havana, Matanzas, Cienfuegos, and Santiago, is little if any  greater than in Boston, New York, or Washington. A difference appears in  the fact that about three-quarters of Cuba's precipitation comes between  the first of May and the first of October. But the term \"wet season\" does  not mean that it rains all the time, or every day, any more than the term  \"dry season\" means that during those months it does not rain at all. At  times during the winter, or dry season, there come storms that are due to  unusual cold in the United States. These are known in Cuba, as they are in  Texas, as \"northers.\" High winds sweep furiously across the Gulf of Mexico,  piling up huge seas on the Cuban coast, and bringing what, in the island,  is the substitute for cold weather, usually attended by rain and sometimes  by a torrent of it. The prevailing wind in Cuba is the northeast  trade-wind. In summer when the sun is directly overhead this wind is  nearly east, while in winter it is northeast. The proper way to avoid such  discomfort as attends humidity accompanying a thermometer in the 80s, is to  avoid haste in movement, to saunter instead of hurrying, to ride instead of  walking, to eat and drink in moderation, and where-ever possible, to keep  in the shade.

The maize forms the great bulk of food of the inhabitants, as well  as of the domestic animals; hence the dreadful consequences of a failure  of this crop. It is eaten either in the form of unfermented bread or  _tortillas_ (a sort of bannock, as it is called in Scotland;) and,  reduced to flour, is mingled with water, forming either _atolle_ or  various kinds of _chicha_. Maize will yield, in very favourable  situations, two or three crops per year; though it is but seldom that  more than one is gathered.    The introduction of wheat is said to have been owing to the accidental  discovery, by a negro slave of Cortez, of three or four grains, among  some rice which had been issued to the soldiers. About the year 1530,  these grains were sown; and from this insignificant source has flowed  all the enormous produce of the upper lands of Mexico. Water is the only  element necessary to ensure success to the Mexican wheat grower; but it  is very difficult to attain this--and irrigation affords the most steady  supply.    _Ibid._           *       *       *       *       *      THE AGAVE AMERICANA.      On Maguey, is an object of great value in the table land of the interior  of Mexico; from this plant is obtained the favourite liquor, the  _pulque_. At the moment of efflorescence, the flower stalk is  extirpated, and the juice destined to form the fruit flows into the  cavity thus produced, and is taken out two or three times a day for four  or five months; each day's produce is fermented for ten or fifteen days;  after which the _pulque_ is fit to drink, and before it has travelled in  skins, it is a very pleasant, refreshing liquor, to which the Mexicans  ascribe as many good qualities as the Highlander does to whiskey. The  stems of the _maguey_ can supply the place of hemp, and may be converted  into paper. The prickles too are used as pins by the Indians.--_Ibid_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE ANECDOTE GALLERY.           *       *       *       *       *      DOCTOR PARR.    _Concluded from page 334_.      Parr was evidently fond of living in troubled waters; accordingly, on  his removal to Colchester, he got into a quarrel with the trustees of  the school on the subject of a lease. He printed a pamphlet about it,  which he never published; restrained perhaps by the remarks of Sir  W. Jones, who constantly noted the pages submitted to him, with \"too  violent,\" \"too strong;\" and probably thought the whole affair a battle  of kites and crows, which Parr had swelled into importance; or, it might  be, he suppressed it, influenced by the prospect of succeeding to  Norwich school, for which he was now a candidate, and by the shrewd  observation of Dr. Foster, \"that Norwich might be touched by a fellow  feeling for Colchester; and the crape-makers of the one place sympathize  with the bag-makers of the other.\" If the latter consideration weighed  with him, it was the first and last time that any such consideration  did, Parr being apparently of the opinion of John Wesley, that there  could be no fitter subject for a Christian man's prayers, than that he  might be delivered from what the world calls \"prudence.\" However it  happened, the pamphlet was withheld, and Parr was elected to the school  at Norwich.    At Norwich, Parr ventured on his first publications, and obtained his  first preferment. The publications consisted of a sermon on \"The Truth  of Christianity,\" \"A Discourse on Education,\" and \"A Discourse on the  Late Fast;\" the last of which opens with a mistake singular in Parr,  who confounds the sedition of Judas Gaulonitis, mentioned in Josephus,  (_Antiq_. xviii. 1. 1.) with that under Pilate, mentioned in St. Luke,  (xiii. 1, 2, 3.); whereas the former probably preceded the latter by  twenty years, or nearly. The preferment which he gained was the living  of Asterby, presented to him by Lady Jane Trafford, the mother of one of  his pupils; which, in 1783, he exchanged for the perpetual curacy of  Hatton, in Warwickshire, the same lady being still his patron neither  was of much value. Lord Dartmouth, whose sons had also been under his  care, endeavoured to procure something for him from Lord Thurlow, but  the chancellor is reported to have said \"No,\" with an oath. The great  and good Bishop Lowth, however, at the request of the same nobleman,  gave him a prebend in St. Paul's, which, though a trifle at the time,  eventually became, on the expiration of leases, a source of affluence to  Parr in his old age. How far he was from such a condition at this period  of his life, is seen by the following incident given by Mr. Field. The  doctor was one day in this gentleman's library, when his eye was caught  by the title of \"Stephens' Greek Thesaurus.\" Suddenly turning about and  striking vehemently the arm of Mr. Field, whom he addressed in a manner  very usual with him; he said, \"Ah! my friend, my friend, may you never  be forced, as I was at Norwich, to sell that work, to me so precious,  from absolute and urgent necessity.\"    But we must on with the Doctor in his career. In 1785, for some reason  unknown to his biographer, Parr resigned the school at Norwich, and in  the year following went to reside at Hatton. \"I have an excellent house,  (he writes to a friend,) good neighbours, and a Poor, ignorant,  dissolute, insolent, and ungrateful, beyond all example. _I like  Warwickshire very much_. I have made great regulations, viz. bells chime  three times as long; Athanasian creed; communion service at the altar;  swearing act; children catechized first Sunday in the month; private  baptisms discouraged; public performed after second lesson; recovered a  100_l_. a year left the poor, with interest amounting to 115_l_., all of  which I am to put out, and settle a trust in the spring; examining all  the charities.\"    Here Warwickshire pleases Parr; but Parr's taste in this, and in many  other matters, (as we shall have occasion to show by and by,) was  subject to change. He soon, therefore, becomes convinced of the superior  intellect of the men of Norfolk. He finds Warwickshire, the Boeotia of  England, two centuries behind in civilization. He is anxious, however,  to be in the commission of the peace for this ill-fated county, and  applies to Lord Hertford, then Lord Lieutenant; but the application  fails; and again, on a subsequent occasion, to Lord Warwick, and again  he is disappointed. What motives operated upon their lordships' minds  to his exclusion, they did not think it necessary to avow.    Providence has so obviously drawn a circle about every man, within  which, for the most part, he is compelled to walk, by furnishing him  with natural affections, evidently intended to fasten upon individuals;  by urging demands upon him which the very preservation of himself and  those about him compels him to listen to; by withholding from him any  considerable knowledge of what is distant, and hereby proclaiming that  his more proper sphere lies in what is near;--by compassing, him about  with physical obstacles, with mountains, with rivers, with seas  \"dissociable,\" with tongues which he cannot utter, or cannot understand;  that, like the wife of Hector, it proclaims in accents scarcely to be  resisted, that there is a tower assigned to everyman, where it is his  first duty to plant himself for the sake of his own, and in the defence  of which he will find perhaps enough to do, without extending his care  to the whole circuit of the city walls.    The close of Parr's life grew brighter, The increased value of his stall  at St. Paul's set him abundantly at his ease: he can even indulge his  love of pomp--_ardetque cupidine currus_, he encumbers himself with a  coach and four. In 1816, he married a second wife, Miss Eyre, the sister  of his friend the Rev. James Eyre; he became reconciled to his two  grand-daughters, now grown up to woman's estate; he received them into  his family, and kept them as his own, till one of them became the wife  of the Rev. John Lynes.    In the latter years of his life, Parr had been subject to erysipelas;  once he had suffered by a carbuncle, and once by a mortification in the  hand. Owing to this tendency to diseased action in the skin, he was  easily affected by cold, and on Sunday, the 16th of January, 1825,  having, in addition to the usual duties of the day, buried a corpse,  he was, on the following night, seized with a long-continued rigor,  attended by fever and delirium, and never effectually rallied again.  There is a note, however, dated November 2, 1824, addressed by him to  Archdeacon Butler, which proves that he felt his end approaching, even  before this crisis.    \"Dear and Learned Namesake,--This letter is important, and strictly  confidential. I have given J. Lynes minute and plenary directions for my  funeral. I desire you, if you can, to preach a short, unadorned funeral  sermon. Rann Kennedy is to read the lesson and grave service, though I  could wish you to read the grave service also. Say little of me, but you  are sure to say it _well_.\"    Dr. Butler complied with his request, and amply made good the opinion  here expressed. He spoke of him like a warm and stedfast friend, but not  like that worst of enemies, an indiscreet one; he did not challenge a  scrutiny by the extravagance of his praise, nor break, by his precious  balms, the head he was most anxious to honour. Dr. Parr's death was  tedious, and his faculties, except at intervals, disturbed. He took  an opportunity, however, afforded him by one of these intervals, of  summoning about his bed his wife, grand-children, and servants;  confessed to them his weaknesses and errors, asked their forgiveness for  any pain he might have caused them by petulance and haste, and professed  \"his trust in God, through Christ, for the pardon of his sins.\" One  expression, which Dr. Johnstone reports him to have used on this  occasion, is"]]]
