Will the assertion  be ventured, that the stone and earth do not act? Do they wish to be  undeceived? They have nothing to do but interpose their hand betwixt the  earth and the stone; it will then be discovered, that notwithstanding  its seeming repose, the stone has power adequate to bruise it;  because the hand has not energies sufficient, within itself, to resist  effectually both the stone and earth.--Action cannot exist in bodies  without re-action. A body that experiences an impulse, an attraction,  or a pressure of any kind, if it resists, clearly demonstrates by such  resistance that it re-acts; from whence it follows, there is a concealed  force, called by these philosophers _vis inertia_, that displays itself  against another force; and this clearly demonstrates, that this inert  force is capable of both acting and re-acting. In short, it will be  found, on close investigation, that those powers which are called  _dead_, and those which are termed _live_ or _moving_, are powers of  the same kind; which only display themselves after a different manner.  Permit us to go a greater distance yet. May we not say, that in those  bodies, or masses, of which their whole become evident from appearances  to us to be at rest, there is notwithstanding, a continual action, and  counter-action, constant efforts, uninterrupted or communicated force,  and continued opposition? In short, a _nisus_, by which the constituting  portions of these bodies press one upon another, mutually resisting  each other, acting and re-acting incessantly? that this reciprocity of  action, this simultaneous re-action, keeps them united, causes their  particles to form a mass, a body, and a combination, which, viewed in  its whole, has the appearance of complete rest, notwithstanding no one  of its particles really ceases to be in motion for a single instant?  These collective masses appear to be at rest, simply by the equality of  the motion--by the responsory impulse of the powers acting in them.    Thus it appears that bodies enjoying perfect repose, really receive,  whether upon their surface, or in their interior, a continual  communicated force, from those bodies by which they are either  surrounded or penetrated, dilated or contracted, rarified or condensed:  in fact, from those which compose them; whereby their particles are  incessantly acting and re-acting, or in continual motion, the effects  of which are displayed by extraordinary changes. Thus heat rarifies and  dilates metals, which is evidence deducible that a bar of iron, from the  change of the atmosphere alone, must be in continual motion; that there  is not a single particle in it that can be said to enjoy rest even for a  single moment. In those hard bodies, indeed, the particles of which are  in actual contact, and which are closely united, how is it possible to  conceive, that air, cold, or heat, can act upon one of these particles,  even exteriorly, without the motion being communicated to those which  are most intimate and minute in their union? Without motion, how should  we be able to comprehend the manner in which our sense of smelling is  affected, by emanations escaping from the most solid bodies, of which  all the particles appear to be at perfect rest? How could we, even by  the assistance of a telescope, see the most distant stars, if there was  not a progressive motion of light from these stars to the retina of our  eye?    Observation and reflection ought to convince us, that every thing in  Nature is in continual motion--that there is not a single part, however  small, that enjoys repose--that Nature acts in all--that she would cease  to be Nature if she did not act. Practical knowledge teaches us, that  without unceasing motion, nothing could be preserved--nothing could  be produced--nothing could act in this Nature. Thus the idea of Nature  necessarily includes that of motion. But it will be asked, and not a  little triumphantly, from whence did she derive her motion? Our reply  is, we know not, neither do they--that _we_ never shall, that _they_  never will. It is a secret hidden from us, concealed from them, by the  most impenetrable veil. We also reply, that it is fair to infer, unless  they can logically prove to the contrary, that it is in herself, since  she is the great whole, out of which nothing can exist. We say this  motion is a manner of existence, that flows, necessarily, out of the  nature of matter; that matter moves by its own peculiar energies; that  its motion is to be attributed to the force which is inherent in itself;  that the variety of motion, and the phenomena which result, proceed from  the diversity of the properties--of the qualities--of the combinations,  which are originally found in the primitive matter, of which Nature is  the assemblage.    Natural philosophers, for the most part, have regarded as inanimate, or  as deprived of the faculty of motion, those bodies which are only  moved by the intervention of some agent or exterior cause; they have  considered themselves justified in concluding, that the matter which  forms these bodies is perfectly inert in its nature. They have not  forsaken this error, although they must have observed, that whenever  a body is left to itself, or disengaged from those obstructions which  oppose themselves to its descent, it has a tendency to fall or to  approach the centre of the earth, by a motion uniformly accelerated;  they have rather chosen to suppose a visionary exterior cause, of which  they themselves had but an imperfect idea, than admit that these bodies  held their motion from their own peculiar nature.    These philosophers, also, notwithstanding they saw above them an  infinite number of globes that moved with great rapidity round a common  centre, still adhered to their favourite opinions; and never ceased to  suppose some whimsical causes for these movements, until the immortal  NEWTON clearly demonstrated that it was the effect of the gravitation  of these celestial bodies towards each other. Experimental philosophers,  however, and amongst them the great Newton himself, have held the cause  of gravitation as inexplicable. Notwithstanding the great weight of this  authority, it appears manifest that it may be deduced from the motion of  matter, by which bodies are diversely determined. Gravitation is nothing  more than a mode of moving--a tendency towards a centre: to speak  strictly, all motion is relative gravitation; since that which falls  relatively to us, rises, with relation to other bodies. From this  it follows, that every motion in our microcosm is the effect of  gravitation; seeing that there is not in the universe either top or  bottom, nor any absolute centre. It should appear, that the weight of  bodies depends on their configuration, as well external as internal,  which gives them that form of action which is called gravitation. Thus,  for instance, a piece of lead, spherically formed, falls quickly and  direct: reduce this ball into very thin plates, it will be sustained  in the air for a much longer time: apply to it the action of fire, this  lead will rise in the atmosphere: here, then, the same metal, variously  modified, has very different modes of action.    A very simple observation would have sufficed to make the philosophers,  antecedent to Newton, feel the inadequateness of the causes they  admitted to operate with such powerful effect. They had a sufficiency  to convince themselves, in the collision of two bodies, which they could  contemplate, and in the known laws of that motion, which these always  communicate by reason of their greater or less compactness; from whence  they ought to have inferred, that the density of _subtle_ or _ethereal_  matter, being considerably less than that of the planets, it could only  communicate to them a very feeble motion, quite insufficient to produce  that velocity of action, of which they could not possibly avoid being  the witnesses.    If Nature had been viewed uninfluenced by prejudice, they must have been  long since convinced that matter acts by its own peculiar activity; that  it needs no exterior communicative force to set it in motion. They might  have perceived that whenever mixed bodies were placed in a situation to  act on each other, motion was instantly excited; and that these mixtures  acted with a force capable of producing the most surprising results.    If particles of iron, sulphur, and water be mixed together, these  bodies thus capacitated to act on each other, are heated by degrees, and  ultimately produce a violent combustion. If flour be wetted with water,  and the mixture closed up, it will be found, after some lapse of time,  (by the aid of a microscope) to have produced organized beings that  enjoy life, of which the water and the flour were believed incapable:  it is thus that inanimate matter can pass into life, or animate matter,  which is in itself only an assemblage of motion.    Reasoning from analogy, which the philosophers of the present day do not  hold incompatible, the production of a man, independent of the ordinary  means, would not be more astonishing than that of an insect with flour  and water. Fermentation and putrid substances, evidently produce living  animals. We have here the principle; with proper materials, principles  can always be brought into action. That generation which is styled  _uncertain_ is only so for those who do not reflect, or who do not  permit themselves, attentively, to observe the operations of Nature.    The generative of motion, and its developement, as well as the energy of  matter, may be seen everywhere; more particularly in those unitions in  which fire, air, and water, find themselves combined. These elements, or  rather these mixed bodies, are the most volatile, the most fugitive  of beings; nevertheless in the hands of Nature, they are the essential  agents employed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8910"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 2 (#6)"],[1,"to which this nature was subordinate, had  only for object man and his convenience, in all the stupendous effects  which are produced in the universe.    If there existed on this earth other thinking beings besides man,  they would fall exactly into similar prejudices with himself; it is  a sentiment founded upon that predilection which each individual  necessarily has for himself; a predilection that will subsist until  reason, aided by experience, in pointing out the truth, shall have  rectified his errors.    Thus, whenever man is contented, whenever every thing is in order with  respect to himself, he either admires or loves the causes to which he  believes he is indebted for his welfare; when he becomes discontented  with his mode of existence, he either fears or hates the cause which  he supposes has produced these afflicting effects. But his welfare  confounds itself with his existence; it ceases to make itself felt when  it has become habitual, when it has been of long continuance; he then  thinks it is inherrent to his essence; he concludes from it that he is  formed to be always happy; he finds it natural that every thing should  concur to the maintenance of his being. It is by no means the same when  he experiences a mode of existence that is displeasing to himself: the  man who suffers is quite astonished at the change which his taken place  in his machine; he judges it to be contrary to the entire of nature,  because it is incommodious to his own particular nature; he, imagines  those events by which he is wounded, to be contrary to the order of  things; he believes that nature is deranged every time she does not  procure for him that mode of feeling which is suitable to his ideas: he  concludes from these suppositions that nature, or rather that the agent  who moves her; is irritated against him.    It is thus that man, almost insensible to good, feels evil in a very  lively manner; the first he believes natural, the other he thinks  opposed to nature. He is either ignorant, or forgets, that he  constitutes part of a whole, formed by the assemblage of substances, of  which some are analogous, others heterogeneous; that the various beings  of which nature is composed, are endowed with a variety of properties,  by virtue of which they act diversely on the bodies who find themselves  within the sphere of their action; that some have an aptitude to  attraction, whilst it is of the essence of others to repel; that even  those bodies that attract at one distance, repel at another; that  the peculiar attractions and repulsions of the particles of bodies  perpetually oppose, invariably counteract the general ones of the masses  of matter: he does not perceive that these beings, as destitute of  goodness, as devoid of malice, act only according to their respective  essences; follow the laws their properties impose upon them; without  being in capacity to act otherwise than they do. It is, therefore, for  want of being acquainted with these things, that he looks upon the great  Author of nature, the great _Cause of causes_, as the immediate cause of  those evils to which he is submitted; that he judges erroneously when he  imagines that the Divinity is exasperated against him.    The fact is, man believes that his welfare is a debt due to him from  nature; that when he suffers evil she does him an injustice; fully  persuaded that this nature was made solely for himself, he cannot  conceive she would make him, who is her lord paramount, suffer, if she  was not moved thereto by a power who is inimical to his happiness;  who has reasons with which he is unacquainted for afflicting, who has  motives which he wishes to discover, for punishing him. From hence it  will be obvious, that evil, much more than good, is the true motive of  those researches which man has made concerning the Divinity--of those  ideas which he has formed to himself--of the conduct he has held towards  him. The admiration of the works of nature, or the acknowledgement of  its goodness, seem never alone to have determined the human species to  recur painfully by thought to the source of these things; familiarized  at once with all those effects which are favourable to his existence, he  does not by any means give himself the same trouble to seek the causes,  that he does to discover those which disquiet him, or by which he is  afflicted. Thus, in reflecting upon the Divinity, it was generally  upon the cause of his evils that man meditated; his meditations were  fruitless, because the evil he experiences, as well as the good he  partakes, are equally necessary effects of natural causes, to which  his mind ought rather to have bent its force, than to have invented  fictitious causes of which he never could form to himself any but  false ideas; seeing that he always borrowed them, from his own peculiar  mariner of existing, acting, and feeling. Obstinately refusing to see  any thing, but himself, he never became acquainted with that universal  nature of which he constitutes such a very feeble part.    The slightest reflection, however, would have been sufficient to  undeceive him on these erroneous ideas. Everything tends to prove that  good and evil are modes of existence that depend upon causes by which a  man is moved; that a sensible being is obliged to experience them. In  a nature composed of a multitude of beings infinitely varied, the  shock occasioned by the collision of discordant matter must necessarily  disturb the order, derange the mode of existence of those beings who  have no analogy with them: these act in every thing they do after  certain laws, which are in themselves immutable; the good or evil,  therefore, which man experiences, are necessary consequences of the  qualities inherent to the beings, within whose sphere of action he is  found. Our birth, which we call a benefit, is an effect as necessary as  our death, which we contemplate as an injustice of fate: it is of the  nature of all analogous beings to unite themselves to form a whole: it  is of the nature of all compound beings to be destroyed, or to dissolve  themselves; some maintain their union for a longer period than others;  some disperse very quickly, as the ephemeron; some endure for ages, as  the planets; every being in dissolving itself gives birth to new beings;  these are destroyed in their turn; to execute the eternal, the immutable  laws of a nature that only exists by the continual changes that all  its parts undergo. Thus nature cannot be accused of malice, since every  thing that takes place in it is necessary--is produced by an invariable  system, to which every other being, as well as herself, is eternally  subjected. The same igneous matter that in man is the principle of  life, frequently becomes the principle of his destruction, either by the  conflagration of a city, the explosion of a volcano, or his mad passion  for war. The aqueous fluid that circulates through his machine, so  essentially necessary to his actual existence, frequently becomes too  abundant, and terminates him by suffocation; is the cause of those  inundations which sometimes swallow up both the earth and its  inhabitants. The air, without which he is not able to respire, is the  cause of those hurricanes, of those tempests, which frequently render  useless the labour of mortals. These elements are obliged to burst their  bonds, when they are combined in a certain manner; their necessary but  fatal consequences are those ravages, those contagions, those famines,  those diseases, those various scourges, against which man, with  streaming eyes and violent emotions, vainly implores the aid of those  powers who are deaf to his cries: his prayers are never granted; but  the same necessity which afflicted him, the same immutable laws which  overwhelmed him with trouble, replaces things in the order he finds  suitable to his species: a relative order of things which was, is, and  always will be the only standard of his judgment.    Man, however, made no such simple reflections: he either did not or  would not perceive that every thing in nature acted by invariable  laws; he continued stedfast in contemplating the good of which he was  partaker, as a favor; in considering the evil he experienced, as a sign  of anger in this nature, which he supposed to be animated by the same  passions as himself or at least that it was governed by secret agents,  who acted after his own manner, who obliged it to execute their will,  that was sometimes favourable, sometimes inimical to the human species.  It was to these supposed agents, with whom in the sunshine of his  prosperity he was but little occupied, that in the bosom of his calamity  he addressed his prayers; he thanked them, however, for their favours,  fearing lest their ingratitude might farther provoke their fury: thus  when assailed by disaster, when afflicted with disease, he invoked them  with fervor: he required them to change in his favor the mode of acting  which was the very essence of beings; he was willing that to make the  slightest evil he experienced cease, that the eternal chain of things  might be broken; and the unerring, undeviating course of nature might he  arrested.    It was upon such ridiculous pretensions, that were founded those  supplications, those fervent prayers, which mortals, almost always  discontented with their fate, never in accord in their respective  desires, addressed to their gods. They were unceasingly upon their knees  before the altars, were ever prostrate before the power of the beings,  whom they judged had the right of commanding nature; who they supposed  to have sufficient energy to divert her course; who they considered to  possess the means to make her subservient to their particular views;  thus each hoped by presents, by humiliation, to induce them to oblige  this nature, to satisfy the discordant desires of their race.
