Others have pined ere I:        Zeus! Father! hadst not thou thy lady-loves?\"          Thus far, in alternating strains, the lads their woes rehearst:      Then each one gave a closing stave. Thus sang Menalcas first:--        MENALCAS.      \"O spare, good wolf, my weanlings! their milky mothers spare!      Harm not the little lad that hath so many in his care!      What, Firefly, is thy sleep so deep? It ill befits a hound,      Tending a boyish master's flock, to slumber over-sound.      And, wethers, of this tender grass take, nothing coy, your fill:      So, when it comes, the after-math shall find you feeding still.      So! so! graze on, that ye be full, that not an udder fail:      Part of the milk shall rear the lambs, and part shall fill my pail.\"        Then Daphnis flung a carol out, as of a nightingale:--        DAPHNIS.      \"Me from her grot but yesterday a girl of haughty brow      Spied as I passed her with my kine, and said, \"How fair art thou!\"      I vow that not one bitter word in answer did I say,      But, looking ever on the ground, went silently my way.      The heifer's voice, the heifer's breath, are passing sweet to me;      And sweet is sleep by summer-brooks upon the breezy lea:      As acorns are the green oak's pride, apples the apple-bough's;      So the cow glorieth in her calf, the cowherd in his cows.\"      Thus the two lads; then spoke the third, sitting his goats among:        GOATHERD.      \"O Daphnis, lovely is thy voice, thy music sweetly sung;      Such song is pleasanter to me than honey on my tongue.      Accept this pipe, for thou hast won. And should there be some notes      That thou couldst teach me, as I plod alongside with my goats,      I'll give thee for thy schooling this ewe, that horns hath none:      Day after day she'll fill the can, until the milk o'errun.\"          Then how the one lad laughed and leaped and clapped his hands for            glee!      A kid that bounds to meet its dam might dance as merrily.      And how the other inly burned, struck down by his disgrace!      A maid first parting from her home might wear as sad a face.          Thenceforth was Daphnis champion of all the country side:      And won, while yet in topmost youth, a Naiad for his bride.          IDYLL IX.      Pastorals.    _DAPHNIS. MENALCAS. A SHEPHERD._          SHEPHERD.      A song from Daphnis! Open he the lay,      He open: and Menalcas follow next:      While the calves suck, and with the barren kine      The young bulls graze, or roam knee-deep in leaves,      And ne'er play truant. But a song from thee,      Daphnis--anon Menalcas will reply.        DAPHNIS.      Sweet is the chorus of the calves and kine,        And sweet the herdsman's pipe. But none may vie      With Daphnis; and a rush-strown bed is mine        Near a cool rill, where carpeted I lie        On fair white goatskins. From a hill-top high      The westwind swept me down the herd entire,        Cropping the strawberries: whence it comes that I        No more heed summer, with his breath of fire,      Than lovers heed the words of mother and of sire.        Thus Daphnis: and Menalcas answered thus:--        MENALCAS.      O AEtna, mother mine! A grotto fair,        Scooped in the rocks, have I: and there I keep      All that in dreams men picture! Treasured there        Are multitudes of she-goats and of sheep,        Swathed in whose wool from top to toe I sleep.      The fire that boils my pot, with oak or beech        Is piled--dry beech-logs when the snow lies deep;        And storm and sunshine, I disdain them each      As toothless sires a nut, when broth is in their reach.          I clapped applause, and straight produced my gifts:        A staff for Daphnis--'twas the handiwork        Of nature, in my father's acres grown:        Yet might a turner find no fault therewith.        I gave his mate a goodly spiral-shell:        We stalked its inmate on the Icarian rocks        And ate him, parted fivefold among five.      He blew forthwith the trumpet on his shell.        Tell, woodland Muse--and then farewell--what song        I, the chance-comer, sang before those twain.        SHEPHERD.        Ne'er let a falsehood scarify my tongue!          Crickets with crickets, ants with ants agree,        And hawks with hawks: and music sweetly sung,          Beyond all else, is grateful unto me.          Filled aye with music may my dwelling be!        Not slumber, not the bursting forth of Spring          So charms me, nor the flowers that tempt the bee,        As those sweet Sisters. He, on whom they fling      One gracious glance, is proof to Circe's blandishing.          IDYLL X.      The Two Workmen.    _MILO.

No more in even swathe thou layest the corn:      Thy fellow-reapers leave thee far behind,         As flocks a ewe that's footsore from a thorn.      By noon and midday what will be thy plight      If now, so soon, thy sickle fails to bite?          BATTUS.      Hewn from hard rocks, untired at set of sun,      Milo, didst ne'er regret some absent one?        MILO.      Not I. What time have workers for regret?        BATTUS.      Hath love ne'er kept thee from thy slumbers yet?        MILO.      Nay, heaven forbid! If once the cat taste cream!        BATTUS.      Milo, these ten days love hath been my dream.        MILO.      You drain your wine, while vinegar's scarce with me.        BATTUS.      --Hence since last spring untrimmed my borders be.        MILO.      And what lass flouts thee?        BATTUS.              She whom we heard play      Amongst Hippocooen's reapers yesterday.        MILO.      Your sins have found you out--you're e'en served right:      You'll clasp a corn-crake in your arms all night.        BATTUS.      You laugh: but headstrong Love is blind no less      Than Plutus: talking big is foolishness.        MILO.      I talk not big. But lay the corn-ears low      And trill the while some love-song--easier so      Will seem your toil: you used to sing, I know.        BATTUS.      Maids of Pieria, of my slim lass sing!      One touch of yours ennobles everything.                [_Sings_]      Fairy Bombyca! thee do men report        Lean, dusk, a gipsy: I alone nut-brown.      Violets and pencilled hyacinths are swart,        Yet first of flowers they're chosen for a crown.      As goats pursue the clover, wolves the goat,      And cranes the ploughman, upon thee I dote.        Had I but Croesus' wealth, we twain should stand        Gold-sculptured in Love's temple; thou, thy lyre      (Ay or a rose or apple) in thy hand,        I in my brave new shoon and dance-attire.      Fairy Bombyca! twinkling dice thy feet,      Poppies thy lips, thy ways none knows how sweet!        MILO.      Who dreamed what subtle strains our bumpkin wrought?        How shone the artist in each measured verse!      Fie on the beard that I have grown for naught!        Mark, lad, these lines by glorious Lytierse.                [_Sings_]        O rich in fruit and cornblade: be this field        Tilled well, Demeter, and fair fruitage yield!          Bind the sheaves, reapers: lest one, passing, say--        'A fig for these, they're never worth their pay.'          Let the mown swathes look northward, ye who mow,        Or westward--for the ears grow fattest so.          Avoid a noontide nap, ye threshing men:        The chaff flies thickest from the corn-ears then.          Wake when the lark wakes; when he slumbers, close        Your work, ye reapers: and at noontide doze.          Boys, the frogs' life for me! They need not him        Who fills the flagon, for in drink they swim.          Better boil herbs, thou toiler after gain,        Than, splitting cummin, split thy hand in twain.        Strains such as these, I trow, befit them well        Who toil and moil when noon is at its height:      Thy meagre love-tale, bumpkin, though shouldst tell        Thy grandam as she wakes up ere 'tis light.          IDYLL XI.      The Giant's Wooing          Methinks all nature hath no cure for Love,      Plaster or unguent, Nicias, saving one;      And this is light and pleasant to a man,      Yet hard withal to compass--minstrelsy.      As well thou wottest, being thyself a leech,      And a prime favourite of those Sisters nine.      'Twas thus our Giant lived a life of ease,      Old Polyphemus, when, the down scarce seen      On lip and chin, he wooed his ocean nymph:      No curlypated rose-and-apple wooer,      But a fell madman, blind to all but love.      Oft from the green grass foldward fared his sheep      Unbid: while he upon the windy beach,      Singing his Galatea, sat and pined      From dawn to dusk, an ulcer at his heart:      Great Aphrodite's shaft had fixed it there.      Yet found he that one cure: he sate him down      On the tall cliff, and seaward looked, and sang:--        \"White Galatea, why disdain thy love?

(_From the \"Quarterly\" Review of Madame Junot's Memoirs_.)      About the beginning of the revolution, a working-man, by name Thirion, had  established himself in a little stall (in Paris,) where he carried on his  business as a mender of carpets. He called one morning to ask M. Permon's  (a Royalist[1]) custom, but was civilly told that the family had long  employed a tradesman of his class, and could not change for a stranger:  the man took the refusal so insolently, that he was at last turned out of  doors, vowing revenge. M. Permon, the ports being still open, makes a run  over to London to place some money in our funds. Meantime \"the Sections  are organized,\" and Thirion becomes \"Secretaire, Greffier, President, je  ne scai quoi, de la notre.\" The morning after his return to Paris, M.  Permon had just risen, when footsteps were heard loud on the staircase,  and in burst Citizen Thirion, two other patriots of the Sectional  Committee, and the carpetman's shopboy. (Madame Junot's Narrative  commences here.)    \"My father was shaving himself. Naturally quick tempered, his impatience  was extreme when he recognised the individual, and he was imprudent enough  to make a menacing gesture the moment they broke into his dressing-room.  'I am here to see the law enforced,' cries Thirion, on seeing my father  advance with the razor in his hand. 'Well, what law is it that chooses so  worthy an organ?'--'I am here to learn your age, your pursuits, and to  interrogate you as to your journey to Coblentz.' My father, who had from  the first word felt the most violent disposition to toss the man down  stairs, shivered with rage; but, at last, he composed himself, wiped his  chin, laid down his razor, and, crossing his arms, placed himself full in  front of Thirion: then, measuring him from the utmost height of his tall  and elegant person, he said, 'You wish to know my age?'--'Yes, such are my  orders.'--Where is the order?' said my father, extending his hand. 'It is  enough for you to know that I am sent hither by the committee of my  section: my orders are sufficiently proved by my presence.'--Ah! you think  so; I am of a different opinion. Your presence here is nothing but an  insult, unless you have a judiciary order to justify it; show it me, and I  shall forget the name of the man, to see only the public functionary.'  Thirion raised his voice as my father lowered his--'What is your  age?--What was the object of your going to Coblentz?'----My father seizes  a large bamboo, and makes it whistle over Thirion's head--at that moment  my mother rushes in, and succeeds in dragging him into another room, and  restoring him to something like calmness. I remember she placed me in his  arms, whispering to me to entreat him to _think of me_. Meantime, Thirion  had drawn up his _proces verbal_, and withdrawn:--he left me weeping  without knowing why I wept, but I saw that my mother and my sister were in  tears too. My father sat pale, trembling with anger,--everything about us  had a desolate aspect.\"    The family escape from Paris--and it was time. Violent alternations of  fear, anger, sorrow, terror, and disgust, with frequent disguises, flights,  and all sorts of changes of residence, at length wear out the health and  spirits of M. Permon--a man, apparently, who united dull enough intellect  with all the vivacity of a Frenchman's mere temperament; and he dies in  obscurity long before anything like order is re-established. We need not  dwell on the particular fortunes of a not very interesting set of people;  but may quote one or two more specimens of the sort of scenes which fill  the greater part of the first of these volumes. Our authoress and her  sister are at one time separated from their parents, and placed in an  obscure _pension_ in the Faubourg (no longer _St._) Antoine. Their brother,  a very young man, has also remained in Paris, and frequently visits them  in their retreat.    \"We could not but observe, that for some days he had been very melancholy,  and that he was getting more and more so. We asked the reason, and he told  us at last that the section had denounced my father in a very alarming  style. We fell a-crying, my sister and I. Albert consoled us as well as he  could, but it was easy to see that the denunciation was not all--that some  immediate danger fixed his fears. We knew afterwards, in effect, that a  report had been spread of the arrest of my parents at Limoges--happily a  false one. The horizon meanwhile was taking a bloody tint. Judge of my  brother's anxiety! he came every day in a cabriolet, which my father had  had built just before these late events; it was an elegant one, very lofty,  of the kind called _wiski._ Already he had been all but insulted by the  populace in driving through the faubourg; but liveries had not yet  altogether disappeared, and nothing would persuade him to listen to our  remonstrances, and make the domestic put off his. Thus it was on the 31st  of August, when he came to see us as usual.\"    \"There was about the boarding-house a man charged with all the rough work,  by name Jaquemart, a fellow that could do everything--but the most  atrocious of countenances. 'The sight of that man makes me sick,' said  Albert; 'I am sure he will end in something tragic.'\"    \"One day, shortly after we went to the _pension_, Jaquemart was bringing  in a load of wood, when my brother drove at the speed of his horse into  the entrance. He saw the man had a burden that would hardly allow him to  get out of the way in time--cried _'Gare!'_--perceived that his efforts  were in vain--and pulled back his horse so sharply as to run much risk of  wounding the animal, and, indeed, of being thrown out himself, owing to  the extraordinary elevation of the _wiski_. Jaquemart, however, escaped by  this means with a scratch on his leg; his eyes were good, he saw what  Albert had done to master his horse, and vowed gratitude.\"    \"The 31st of August the man had nothing to do about the house, yet he kept  lounging at the gate, or in the court, all day long. It was late ere  Albert came--he had been waiting for him, and whispered, as he alighted,  'Stay here to-night to take care of your sisters--don't go home.' Albert  looked at him with astonishment; he had, indeed, perceived symptoms of  some commotion, but fancied, as most of Paris did, that it would be  directed against the Temple. 'What is your meaning?' said he. 'I entreat  you to stay here--you will be near your sisters; and if there be need for  another hand, mine shall not be far off--very well!--we shall be there.'  Albert pressed him with questions, but could extract nothing; and after  giving the man some money, persisted; in returning home as usual.\"    \"All know the frightful story of the day after this. Albert's anxiety for  us makes him brave every danger, and he comes to us again. The first  person he sees at our door is Jaquemart, in the costume of the most  atrocious of bandits; our ladies had not dared to bid him go away, but his  appearance made them tremble. 'I did not desire you to come hither, but to  stay here,' he said; 'why have I not been obeyed?' 'Why do you speak  so--was this house particularly menaced?' 'I know nothing of that--at such  a moment one should fear everything.'\"    \"We heard groans, weeping, all Paris had not been at _the massacre_. It  was late. They pressed Albert to stay, but he would not. He promised,  however, to come back next morning.----That day he was obliged to stay  at home till about three o'clock, arranging and burning papers. He then  came out to visit us, and found himself in the midst of crowds of men,  drunken and bloody; many were naked to the waist, their breasts covered  with blood. They carried fragments of clothing on their pikes and  sabres--their faces were inflamed, their eyes haggard, the whole scene  hideous. These groups became more and more frequent and numerous as he  advanced. In mortal anxiety for us, he determined to push through  everything, and, urging his horse to its speed, reached at length the  front of the Hotel Beaumarchais. There he was stopped by an immense  crowd--always the same figures naked and bloodstained, but here their  looks were those of enraged fiends. They shout, they scream, they sing,  they dance--the saturnalia of hell. On seeing Albert's cabriolet, they  redoubled their cries--'An aristocrat! give it him, give it him!' In a  moment the cabriolet is surrounded, and from the midst of the crowd an  object rises and moves towards him. His agitation perplexes his view--he  perceives long fair tresses dabbled with blood--a countenance beautiful  even yet. It approaches--it is thrust upon his face; he recognises the  features--it is the head of Madame de Lamballe!\"    \"The servant whips the horse with all the strength of his arm. The  generous animal, with the instinctive horror of his race for dead bodies,  springs with redoubled speed from the spectacle of horror. The frightful  trophy, and the cannibals that bore it, had been overturned in the  mud--screams and imprecations pursued Albert, stretched senseless at the  bottom of the cabriolet. The servant had kept the reins, and whipped the  more fiercely,"]]]
