These ultimate springs and principles are totally shut up from  human curiosity and enquiry. Elasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts,  communication of motion by impulse; these are probably the ultimate  causes and principles which we shall ever discover in nature; and we may  esteem ourselves sufficiently happy, if, by accurate enquiry and  reasoning, we can trace up the particular phenomena to, or near to,  these general principles. The most perfect philosophy of the natural  kind only staves off our ignorance a little longer: as perhaps the most  perfect philosophy of the moral or metaphysical kind serves only to  discover larger portions of it. Thus the observation of human blindness  and weakness is the result of all philosophy, and meets us at every  turn, in spite of our endeavours to elude or avoid it.    27. Nor is geometry, when taken into the assistance of natural  philosophy, ever able to remedy this defect, or lead us into the  knowledge of ultimate causes, by all that accuracy of reasoning for  which it is so justly celebrated. Every part of mixed mathematics  proceeds upon the supposition that certain laws are established by  nature in her operations; and abstract reasonings are employed, either  to assist experience in the discovery of these laws, or to determine  their influence in particular instances, where it depends upon any  precise degree of distance and quantity. Thus, it is a law of motion,  discovered by experience, that the moment or force of any body in motion  is in the compound ratio or proportion of its solid contents and its  velocity; and consequently, that a small force may remove the greatest  obstacle or raise the greatest weight, if, by any contrivance or  machinery, we can increase the velocity of that force, so as to make it  an overmatch for its antagonist. Geometry assists us in the application  of this law, by giving us the just dimensions of all the parts and  figures which can enter into any species of machine; but still the  discovery of the law itself is owing merely to experience, and all the  abstract reasonings in the world could never lead us one step towards  the knowledge of it. When we reason _a priori_, and consider merely any  object or cause, as it appears to the mind, independent of all  observation, it never could suggest to us the notion of any distinct  object, such as its effect; much less, show us the inseparable and  inviolable connexion between them. A man must be very sagacious who  could discover by reasoning that crystal is the effect of heat, and ice  of cold, without being previously acquainted with the operation of these  qualities.      PART II.      28. But we have not yet attained any tolerable satisfaction with regard  to the question first proposed. Each solution still gives rise to a new  question as difficult as the foregoing, and leads us on to farther  enquiries. When it is asked, _What is the nature of all our reasonings  concerning matter of fact?_ the proper answer seems to be, that they are  founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked,  _What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning  that relation?_ it may be replied in one word, Experience. But if we  still carry on our sifting humour, and ask, _What is the foundation of  all conclusions from experience?_ this implies a new question, which may  be of more difficult solution and explication. Philosophers, that give  themselves airs of superior wisdom and sufficiency, have a hard task  when they encounter persons of inquisitive dispositions, who push them  from every corner to which they retreat, and who are sure at last to  bring them to some dangerous dilemma. The best expedient to prevent this  confusion, is to be modest in our pretensions; and even to discover the  difficulty ourselves before it is objected to us. By this means, we may  make a kind of merit of our very ignorance.    I shall content myself, in this section, with an easy task, and shall  pretend only to give a negative answer to the question here proposed. I  say then, that, even after we have experience of the operations of cause  and effect, our conclusions from that experience are _not_ founded on  reasoning, or any process of the understanding. This answer we must  endeavour both to explain and to defend.    29. It must certainly be allowed, that nature has kept us at a great  distance from all her secrets, and has afforded us only the knowledge of  a few superficial qualities of objects; while she conceals from us those  powers and principles on which the influence of those objects entirely  depends. Our senses inform us of the colour, weight, and consistence of  bread; but neither sense nor reason can ever inform us of those  qualities which fit it for the nourishment and support of a human body.  Sight or feeling conveys an idea of the actual motion of bodies; but as  to that wonderful force or power, which would carry on a moving body for  ever in a continued change of place, and which bodies never lose but by  communicating it to others; of this we cannot form the most distant  conception. But notwithstanding this ignorance of natural powers[6] and  principles, we always presume, when we see like sensible qualities, that  they have like secret powers, and expect that effects, similar to those  which we have experienced, will follow from them. If a body of like  colour and consistence with that bread, which we have formerly eat, be  presented to us, we make no scruple of repeating the experiment, and  foresee, with certainty, like nourishment and support. Now this is a  process of the mind or thought, of which I would willingly know the  foundation. It is allowed on all hands that there is no known connexion  between the sensible qualities and the secret powers; and consequently,  that the mind is not led to form such a conclusion concerning their  constant and regular conjunction, by anything which it knows of their  nature. As to past _Experience_, it can be allowed to give _direct_ and  _certain_ information of those precise objects only, and that precise  period of time, which fell under its cognizance: but why this experience  should be extended to future times, and to other objects, which for  aught we know, may be only in appearance similar; this is the main  question on which I would insist. The bread, which I formerly eat,  nourished me; that is, a body of such sensible qualities was, at that  time, endued with such secret powers: but does it follow, that other  bread must also nourish me at another time, and that like sensible  qualities must always be attended with like secret powers? The  consequence seems nowise necessary. At least, it must be acknowledged  that there is here a consequence drawn by the mind; that there is a  certain step taken; a process of thought, and an inference, which wants  to be explained. These two propositions are far from being the same, _I  have found that such an object has always been attended with such an  effect_, and _I foresee, that other objects, which are, in appearance,  similar, will be attended with similar effects_. I shall allow, if you  please, that the one proposition may justly be inferred from the other:  I know, in fact, that it always is inferred. But if you insist that the  inference is made by a chain of reasoning, I desire you to produce that  reasoning. The connexion between these propositions is not intuitive.  There is required a medium, which may enable the mind to draw such an  inference, if indeed it be drawn by reasoning and argument. What that  medium is, I must confess, passes my comprehension; and it is incumbent  on those to produce it, who assert that it really exists, and is the  origin of all our conclusions concerning matter of fact.        [6] The word, Power, is here used in a loose and popular sense.      The more accurate explication of it would give additional      evidence to this argument. See Sect. 7.    30. This negative argument must certainly, in process of time, become  altogether convincing, if many penetrating and able philosophers shall  turn their enquiries this way and no one be ever able to discover any  connecting proposition or intermediate step, which supports the  understanding in this conclusion. But as the question is yet new, every  reader may not trust so far to his own penetration, as to conclude,  because an argument escapes his enquiry, that therefore it does not  really exist. For this reason it may be requisite to venture upon a more  difficult task; and enumerating all the branches of human knowledge,  endeavour to show that none of them can afford such an argument.    All reasonings may be divided into two kinds, namely, demonstrative  reasoning, or that concerning relations of ideas, and moral reasoning,  or that concerning matter of fact and existence. That there are no  demonstrative arguments in the case seems evident; since it implies no  contradiction that the course of nature may change, and that an object,  seemingly like those which we have experienced, may be attended with  different or contrary effects. May I not clearly and distinctly conceive  that a body, falling from the clouds, and which, in all other respects,  resembles snow, has yet the taste of salt or feeling of fire? Is there  any more intelligible proposition than to affirm, that all the trees  will flourish in December and January, and decay in May and June? Now  whatever is intelligible, and can be distinctly conceived, implies no  contradiction, and can never be proved false by any demonstrative  argument or abstract reasoning _a priori_.    If we be, therefore, engaged by arguments to put trust in past  experience, and make it the standard of our future judgement, these  arguments must be probable only, or such as regard matter of fact and  real existence, according to the division above mentioned.

As patents are yet pending  on certain new features in this engine, we must defer a full description  of it for a later issue of our journal.    The Pennsylvania line has a single 6-inch pipe 280 miles long, with six  pumping stations as shown in the map, and groups of shorter lines, with  a loop extending from the main line to Milton, Pa., a shipping point for  loading on cars. At Millway, Pa., a 5-inch pipe leaves the Pennsylvania  line and runs to Baltimore, a distance of 70 miles, and is operated  from the first named station alone, there being no intermediate pumping  station.[1] The Cleveland pipe, 100 miles long, is 5 inches in diameter,  and has upon it four pumping stations; it carries oil to the very  extensive refineries of the company at the terminal on Lake Erie. The  Buffalo line is 4 inches in diameter and 70 miles long; it has a pumping  station at Four-Mile and at Ashford (omitted on the map). The Pittsburg  line is 4 inches in diameter and 60 miles long; it has pumping stations  at Carbon Center and at Freeport.    [Footnote 1: Millway is about 400 feet above tide-water at Baltimore,  but the line passes over a very undulating country in its passage to the  last named point. We regret that we have no profile on this 70 mile line  operated by a single pumping plant.--_Ed. Engineering News_.]    A very necessary and remarkably complete adjunct to the numerous pipe  lines of this company is an independent telegraph system extending to  every point on its widely diverging lines. The storage capacity of the  National Transit Co.'s system is placed at 1,500,000 barrels, and  this tankage is being constantly increased to meet the demands of the  producers.[1]    [Footnote 1: As showing the extent of the sea-coast transportation of  petroleum, we should mention that the statistics for 1884 show a total  of crude equivalent exported from the United States in that year,  equaling 16,661,086 barrels, of 51 gallons each. This is a daily average  of 42,780 barrels.]    The company is officially organized as follows: C.A. Griscom, President;  Benjamin Brewster, Vice President; John Bushnell, Secretary; Daniel  O'Day, General Manager; J.H. Snow, General Superintendent. Mr. Snow  was the practical constructor of the entire system, and the general  perfection of the work is mainly due to his personal experience, energy,  and careful supervision. His engineering assistants were Theodore M.  Towe and C.J. Hepburn on the New York line and J.B. Barbour on the  Pennsylvania lines.    The enterprise has been so far a great engineering success, and the oil  delivery is stated on good authority to be within 2 per cent. of the  theoretical capacity of the pipes. From a commercial standpoint, the  ultimate future of the undertaking will be determined by the lasting  qualities of wrought iron pipe buried in the ground and subjected to  enormous strain; time alone can determine this question.    In preparing this article we are indebted for information to the firm of  H.R. Worthington, to General Manager O'Day, of the National Transit  Co., to the editor of the _Derrick_ of Oil City, Pa., and to numerous  engineering friends.--_Engineering News_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE FUEL OF THE FUTURE.    By GEORGE WARDMAN.      The practical application of natural gas, as an article of fuel, to the  purpose of manufacturing glass, iron, and steel, promises to work a  revolution in the industrial interests of America--promises to work a  revolution; for notwithstanding the fact that, in many of the largest  iron, steel, and glass factories in Pittsburg and its vicinity, natural  gas has already been substituted for coal, the managers of some such  works are shy of the new fuel, mainly for two reasons: 1. They doubt  the continuity and regularity of its supply. 2. They do not deem the  difference between the price of natural gas and coal sufficient as yet  to justify the expenditure involved in the furnace changes necessary to  the substitution of the one for the other. These two objections will  doubtless disappear with additional experience in the production and  regulation of the gas supply, and with enlarged competition among the  companies engaging in its transmission from the wells to the works.  At present the use of natural gas as a substitute for coal in the  manufacture of glass, iron, and steel is in its infancy.    Natural gas is as ancient as the universe. It was known to man in  prehistoric times, we must suppose, for the very earliest historical  reference to the Magi of Asia records them as worshiping the eternal  fires which then blazed, and still blaze, in the fissures of the  mountain heights overlooking the Caspian Sea. Those records appertain  to a period at least 600 years before the birth of Christ; but the Magi  must have lived and worshiped long anterior to that time.    Zoroaster, reputed founder of the Parsee sect, is placed contemporary  with the prophet Daniel, from 2,500 to 600 B.C.; and, although Daniel  has been doubted, and Zoroaster may never have seen the light, the  fissures of the Caucasus have been flaming since the earliest authentic  records.    The Parsees (Persians) did not originally worship fire. They believed  in two great powers--the Spirit of Light, or Good, and the Spirit of  Darkness, or Evil. Subsequent to Zoroaster, when the Persian empire rose  to its greatest power and importance, overspreading the west to the  shores of the Caspian and beyond, the tribes of the Caucasus suffered  political subjugation; but the creed of the Magi, founded upon the  eternal flame-altars of the mountains, proved sufficiently vigorous to  transform the Parseeism of the conquerors to the fire worship of the  conquered.    About the beginning of the seventh century of the Christian era, the  Grecian Emperor Heraclius overturned the fire altars of the Magi at  Baku, the chief city on the Caspian, but the fire worshipers were not  expelled from the Caucasus until the Mohammedans subjugated the Persian  Empire, when they were driven into the Rangoon, on the Irrawaddy, in  India, one of the most noted petroleum producing districts of the world.    Petroleum and natural gas are so intimately related that one would  hardly dare to say whether the gas proceeds from petroleum or the  petroleum is deposited from the gas. It is, however, safe to assume that  they are the products of one material, the lighter element separating  from the heavier under certain degrees of temperature and pressure.  Thus petroleum may separate from the gas as asphaltum separates from  petroleum. But some speculative minds consider natural gas to be a  product of anthracite coal. The fact that the great supply-field of  natural gas in Western Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia, and  Eastern Ohio is a bituminous and not an anthracite region does not of  itself confute that theory, as the argument for it is, that the gas may  be tapped at a remote distance from the source of supply; and, whereas  anthracite is not a gas-coal, while bituminous is, we are told to  suppose that the gas which once may have been a component part of the  anthracite was long ago expelled by Nature, and has since been held in  vast reservoirs with slight waste, awaiting the use of man. That is one  theory; and upon that supposition it is suggested that anthracite  may exist below the bituminous beds of the region lying between the  Alleghany Mountains and the Great Lakes. Another theory is, that natural  gas is a product of the sea-weed deposited in the Devonian stratum. But,  leaving modern theories on the origin of natural gas and petroleum, we  may suppose the natural gas jets now burning in the fissures of the  Caucasus to have started up in flames about the time when, according  to the Old Testament, Noah descended from Mount Ararat, or very soon  thereafter. In the language of modern science it would be safe to say  that those flames sprang up when the Caucasus range was raised from  beneath the surface of the universal sea. The believer in biblical  chronology may say that those fires have been burning for four thousand  years--the geologist may say for four millions.    We know that Alexander the Great penetrated to the Caspian; and in  Plutarch we read: \"Hence [Arbela] he marched through the province  Babylon [Media?], which immediately submitted to him, and in Ecbatana  [?] was much surprised at the sight of the place where fire issues in a  continuous stream, like a spring of water, out of a cleft in the earth,  and the stream of naphtha, which not far from this spot flows out so  abundantly as to form a large lake. This naphtha, in other respects  resembling bitumen, is so subject to take fire that, before it touches  the flame, it will kindle at the very light that surrounds it, and often  inflames the intermediate air also. The barbarians, to show the power  and nature of it, sprinkled the street that led to the king's lodgings  with little drops of it, and, when it was almost night, stood at the  farther end with torches, which being applied to the moistened places,  the first taking fire, instantly, as quick as a man could think of it,  it caught from one end to another in such manner that the whole street  was one continued flame. Among those who used to wait upon the king, and  find occasion to amuse him, when he anointed and washed himself, there  was one Athenophanus, an Athenian, who desired him to make an experiment  of the naphtha upon Stephanus, who stood by in the bathing place, a  youth with a ridiculously ugly face, whose talent was singing well.  'For,' said he, 'if it take hold of him, and is not put out, it must  undeniably be allowed to be of the most invincible strength.' The youth,  as it happened, readily consented to undergo the trial, and as soon as  he was anointed and rubbed with it, his whole body was broke out into  such a flame, and was so"]]]
