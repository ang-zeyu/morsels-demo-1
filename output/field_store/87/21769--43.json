St. Simon,  who treats the matter with the levity becoming what he thought so good  a joke, adds, \"that people did not spare their animadversions on this  beautiful marriage,\" and further informs us, \"that the project fell to  the ground some months afterwards by the overthrow of Law, and the ruin  of the ambitious Monsieur Andre.\" It would appear, however, that the  noble family never had the honesty to return the hundred thousand  crowns.    Amid events like these, which, humiliating though they be, partake  largely of the ludicrous, others occurred of a more serious nature.  Robberies in the streets were of daily occurrence, in consequence of  the immense sums, in paper, which people carried about with them.  Assassinations were also frequent. One case in particular fixed the  attention of the whole of France, not only on account of the enormity of  the offence, but of the rank and high connexions of the criminal.    The Count d'Horn, a younger brother of the Prince d'Horn, and related  to the noble families of D'Aremberg, De Ligne, and De Montmorency, was  a young man of dissipated character, extravagant to a degree, and  unprincipled as he was extravagant. In connexion with two other young  men as reckless as himself, named Mille, a Piedmontese captain, and one  Destampes, or Lestang, a Fleming, he formed a design to rob a very rich  broker, who was known, unfortunately for himself, to carry great sums  about his person. The Count pretended a desire to purchase of him a  number of shares in the Company of the Indies, and for that purpose  appointed to meet him in a cabaret, or low public-house, in the  neighbourhood of the Place Vendome. The unsuspecting broker was punctual  to his appointment; so were the Count d'Horn and his two associates,  whom he introduced as his particular friends. After a few moments'  conversation, the Count d'Horn suddenly sprang upon his victim, and  stabbed him three times in the breast with a poniard. The man fell  heavily to the ground, and, while the Count was employed in rifling his  portfolio of bonds in the Mississippi and Indian schemes to the amount  of one hundred thousand crowns, Mille, the Piedmontese, stabbed the  unfortunate broker again and again, to make sure of his death. But the  broker did not fall without a struggle, and his cries brought the people  of the cabaret to his assistance. Lestang, the other assassin, who had  been set to keep watch at a staircase, sprang from a window and escaped;  but Mille and the Count d'Horn were seized in the very act.    This crime, committed in open day, and in so public a place as a  cabaret, filled Paris with consternation. The trial of the assassins  commenced on the following day, and the evidence being so clear, they  were both found guilty and condemned to be broken alive on the wheel.  The noble relatives of the Count d'Horn absolutely blocked up the  ante-chambers of the Regent, praying for mercy on the misguided youth,  and alleging that he was insane. The Regent avoided them as long as  possible, being determined that, in a case so atrocious, justice should  take its course; but the importunity of these influential suitors was  not to be overcome so silently, and they at last forced themselves into  the presence of the Regent, and prayed him to save their house the shame  of a public execution. They hinted that the Princes d'Horn were allied  to the illustrious family of Orleans, and added that the Regent himself  would be disgraced if a kinsman of his should die by the hands of a  common executioner. The Regent, to his credit, was proof against all  their solicitations, and replied to their last argument in the words of  Corneille,--         \"Le crime fait la honte, et non pas l'echafaud:\"    adding, that whatever shame there might be in the punishment he would  very willingly share with the other relatives. Day after day they  renewed their entreaties, but always with the same result. At last  they thought that if they could interest the Duke de St. Simon in  their layout, a man for whom the Regent felt sincere esteem, they might  succeed in their object. The Duke, a thorough aristocrat, was as shocked  as they were, that a noble assassin should die by the same death as a  plebeian felon, and represented to the Regent the impolicy of making  enemies of so numerous, wealthy, and powerful a family. He urged, too,  that in Germany, where the family of D'Aremberg had large possessions,  it was the law, that no relative of a person broken on the wheel could  succeed to any public office or employ until a whole generation had  passed away. For this reason he thought the punishment of the guilty  Count might be transmuted into beheading, which was considered all over  Europe as much less infamous. The Regent was moved by this argument, and  was about to consent, when Law, who felt peculiarly interested in the  fate of the murdered man, confirmed him in his former resolution, to let  the law take its course.    The relatives of D'Horn were now reduced to the last extremity. The  Prince de Robec Montmorency, despairing of other methods, found means  to penetrate into the dungeon of the criminal, and offering him a cup of  poison, implored him to save them from disgrace. The Count d'Horn turned  away his head, and refused to take it. Montmorency pressed him once  more, and losing all patience at his continued refusal, turned on his  heel, and exclaiming, \"Die, then, as thou wilt, mean-spirited wretch!  thou art fit only to perish by the hands of the hangman!\" left him to  his fate.    D'Horn himself petitioned the Regent that he might be beheaded, but Law,  who exercised more influence over his mind than any other person, with  the exception of the notorious Abbe Dubois, his tutor, insisted that  he could not in justice succumb to the self-interested views of the  D'Horns. The Regent had from the first been of the same opinion, and  within six days after the commission of their crime, D'Horn and Mille  were broken on the wheel in the Place de Greve. The other assassin,  Lestang, was never apprehended.    This prompt and severe justice was highly pleasing to the populace of  Paris; even M. de Quincampoix, as they called Law, came in for a share  of their approbation for having induced the Regent to show no favour  to a patrician. But the number of robberies and assassinations did  not diminish. No sympathy was shown for rich jobbers when they were  plundered: the general laxity of public morals, conspicuous enough  before, was rendered still more so by its rapid pervasion of the middle  classes, who had hitherto remained comparatively pure, between the open  vices of the class above and the hidden crimes of the class below them.  The pernicious love of gambling diffused itself through society, and  bore all public, and nearly all private, virtue before it.    For a time, while confidence lasted, an impetus was given to trade,  which could not fail to be beneficial. In Paris, especially, the good  results were felt. Strangers flocked into the capital from every part,  bent, not only upon making money, but on spending it. The Duchess of  Orleans, mother of the Regent, computes the increase of the population  during this time, from the great influx of strangers from all parts of  the world, at 305,000 souls. The housekeepers were obliged to make up  beds in garrets, kitchens, and even stables, for the accommodation of  lodgers; and the town was so full of carriages and vehicles of every  description, that they were obliged in the principal streets to drive at  a foot-pace for fear of accidents. The looms of the country worked with  unusual activity, to supply rich laces, silks, broad-cloth, and velvets,  which being paid for in abundant paper, increased in price four-fold.  Provisions shared the general advance; bread, meat, and vegetables were  sold at prices greater than had ever before been known; while the wages  of labour rose in exactly the same proportion. The artisan, who formerly  gained fifteen sous per diem, now gained sixty. New houses were built  in every direction; an illusory prosperity shone over the land, and so  dazzled the eyes of the whole nation that none could see the dark cloud  on the horizon, announcing the storm that was too rapidly approaching.    Law himself, the magician whose wand had wrought so surprising a change,  shared, of course, in the general prosperity. His wife and daughter were  courted by the highest nobility, and their alliance sought by the  heirs of ducal and princely houses. He bought two splendid estates  in different parts of France, and entered into a negotiation with the  family of the Duke de Sully for the purchase of the Marquisate of Rosny.  His religion being an obstacle to his advancement, the Regent promised,  if he would publicly conform to the Catholic faith, to make him  comptroller-general of the finances. Law, who had no more real religion  than any other professed gambler, readily agreed, and was confirmed by  the Abbe de Tencin in the cathedral of Melun, in presence of a great  crowd of spectators.    [The following squib was circulated on the occasion:--         \"Foin de ton zele seraphique,       Malheureux Abbe de Tencin,       Depuis que Law est Catholique,       Tout le royaume est Capucin    Thus, somewhat weakly and paraphrastically rendered by Justansond, in  his translation of the \"Memoirs of Louis XV:\"--         \"Tencin, a curse on thy seraphic zeal,       Which by persuasion hath contrived the means       To make the Scotchman at our altars kneel,       Since which we all are poor as Capucines?]    On the following day he was elected honorary churchwarden of the parish  of St. Roch, upon which occasion he made it a present of the sum of five  hundred thousand livres.

On that occasion he evidently killed the  High Priest of Voodoo.\"    I uttered an exclamation of scorn.    \"My dear Harley,\" I said, \"the whole thing is too utterly fantastic. I  begin to believe again that we are dealing with a madman.\"    Harley glanced down at the wing of the bat.    \"We shall see,\" he murmured. \"Even if the only result of our visit is to  make the acquaintance of the Colonel's household our time will not have  been wasted.\"    \"No,\" said I, \"that is true enough. I am looking forward to meeting  Madame de Staemer--\"    \"The Colonel's invalid cousin,\" added Harley, tonelessly.    \"And her companion, Miss Beverley.\"    \"Quite so. Nor must we forget the Spanish butler, and the Colonel  himself, whose acquaintance I am extremely anxious to renew.\"    \"The whole thing is wildly bizarre, Harley.\"    \"My dear Knox,\" he replied, stretching himself luxuriously in the long  lounge chair, \"the most commonplace life hovers on the edge of the  bizarre. But those of us who overstep the border become preposterous  in the eyes of those who have never done so. This is not because the  unusual is necessarily the untrue, but because writers of fiction have  claimed the unusual as their particular province, and in doing so have  divorced it from fact in the public eye. Thus I, myself, am a myth, and  so are you, Knox!\"    He raised his hand and pointed to the doorway communicating with the  office.    \"We owe our mythological existence to that American genius whose  portrait hangs beside the Burmese cabinet and who indiscreetly  created the character of C. Auguste Dupin. The doings of this amateur  investigator were chronicled by an admirer, you may remember, since  when no private detective has been allowed to exist outside the pages of  fiction. My most trivial habits confirm my unreality.    \"For instance, I have a friend who is good enough sometimes to record  my movements. So had Dupin. I smoke a pipe. So did Dupin. I investigate  crime, and I am sometimes successful. Here I differ from Dupin. Dupin  was always successful. But my argument is this--you complain that the  life of Colonel Don Juan Sarmiento Menendez, on his own showing,  has been at least as romantic as his name. It would not be accounted  romantic by the adventurous, Knox; it is only romantic to the prosaic  mind. In the same way his name is only unusual to our English ears. In  Spain it would pass unnoticed.\"    \"I see your point,\" I said, grudgingly; \"but think of I Voodoo in the  Surrey Hills.\"    \"I am thinking of it, Knox, and it affords me much delight to think of  it. You have placed your finger I upon the very point I was endeavouring  to make. Voodoo in the Surrey Hills! Quite so. Voodoo in some island  of the Caribbean Seas, yes, but Voodoo in the Surrey Hills, no. Yet, my  dear fellow, there is a regular steamer service between South America  and England. Or one may embark at Liverpool and disembark in the Spanish  Main. Why, then, may not one embark in the West Indies and disembark  at Liverpool? This granted, you will also grant that from Liverpool to  Surrey is a feasible journey. Why, then, should you exclaim, 'but Voodoo  in the Surrey Hills!' You would be surprised to meet an Esquimaux in  the Strand, but there is no reason why an Esquimaux should not visit the  Strand. In short, the most annoying thing about fact is its resemblance  to fiction. I am looking forward to the day, Knox, when I can retire  from my present fictitious profession and become a recognized member  of the community; such as a press agent, a theatrical manager, or some  other dealer in Fact!\"    He burst out laughing, and reaching over to a side-table refilled my  glass and his own.    \"There lies the wing of a Vampire Bat,\" he said, pointing, \"in Chancery  Lane. It is impossible. Yet,\" he raised his glass, \"'Pussyfoot' Johnson  has visited Scotland, the home of Whisky!\"    We were silent for a while, whilst I considered his remarks.    \"The conclusion to which I have come,\" declared Harley, \"is that nothing  is so strange as the commonplace. A rod and line, a boat, a luncheon  hamper, a jar of good ale, and the peculiar peace of a Norfolk  river--these joys I willingly curtail in favour of the unknown things  which await us at Cray's Folly. Remember, Knox,\" he stared at me  queerly, \"Wednesday is the night of the full moon.\"          CHAPTER IV    CRAY'S FOLLY        Paul Harley lay back upon the cushions and glanced at me with a  quizzical smile. The big, up-to-date car which Colonel Menendez had  placed at our disposal was surmounting a steep Surrey lane as though no  gradient had existed.    \"Some engine!\" he said, approvingly.    I nodded in agreement, but felt disinclined for conversation, being  absorbed in watching the characteristically English scenery. This,  indeed, was very beautiful. The lane along which we were speeding was  narrow, winding, and over-arched by trees. Here and there sunlight  penetrated to spread a golden carpet before us, but for the most part  the way lay in cool and grateful shadow.    On one side a wooded slope hemmed us in blackly, on the other lay dell  after dell down into the cradle of the valley. It was a poetic corner of  England, and I thought it almost unbelievable that London was only some  twenty miles behind. A fit place this for elves and fairies to  survive, a spot in which the presence of a modern automobile seemed a  desecration. Higher we mounted and higher, the engine running strongly  and smoothly; then, presently, we were out upon a narrow open road with  the crescent of the hills sweeping away on the right and dense woods  dipping valleyward to the left and behind us.    The chauffeur turned, and, meeting my glance:    \"Cray's Folly, sir,\" he said.    He jerked his hand in the direction of a square, gray-stone tower  somewhat resembling a campanile, which uprose from a distant clump of  woods cresting a greater eminence.    \"Ah,\" murmured Harley, \"the famous tower.\"    Following the departure of the Colonel on the previous evening, he had  looked up Cray's Folly and had found it to be one of a series of houses  erected by the eccentric and wealthy man whose name it bore. He had  had a mania for building houses with towers, in which his rival--and  contemporary--had been William Beckford, the author of \"Vathek,\" a work  which for some obscure reason has survived as well as two of the three  towers erected by its writer.    I became conscious of a keen sense of anticipation. In this, I think,  the figure of Miss Val Beverley played a leading part. There was  something pathetic in the presence of this lonely English girl in so  singular a household; for if the menage at Cray's Folly should prove  half so strange as Colonel Menendez had led us to believe, then truly we  were about to find ourselves amid unusual people.    Presently the road inclined southward somewhat and we entered the fringe  of the trees. I noticed one or two very ancient cottages, but no trace  of the modern builder. This was a fragment of real Old England, and  I was not sorry when presently we lost sight of the square tower; for  amidst such scenery it was an anomaly and a rebuke.    What Paul Harley's thoughts may have been I cannot say, but he preserved  an unbroken silence up to the very moment that we came to the gate  lodge.    The gates were monstrosities of elaborate iron scrollwork, craftsmanship  clever enough in its way, but of an ornate kind more in keeping with the  orange trees of the South than with this wooded Surrey countryside.    A very surly-looking girl, quite obviously un-English (a daughter of  Pedro, the butler, I learned later), opened the gates, and we entered  upon a winding drive literally tunnelled through the trees. Of the house  we had never a glimpse until we were right under its walls, nor should  I have known that we were come to the main entrance if the car had not  stopped.    \"Looks like a monastery,\" muttered Harley.    Indeed that part of the building--the north front--which was visible  from this point had a strangely monastic appearance, being built of  solid gray blocks and boasting only a few small, heavily barred windows.  The eccentricity of the Victorian gentleman who had expended thousands  of pounds upon erecting this house was only equalled, I thought, by that  of Colonel Menendez, who had chosen it for a home. An out-jutting wing  shut us in on the west, and to the east the prospect was closed by the  tallest and most densely grown box hedge I had ever seen, trimmed most  perfectly and having an arched opening in the centre. Thus, the entrance  to Cray's Folly lay in a sort of bay.    But even as we stepped from the car, the great church-like oaken doors  were thrown open, and there, framed in the monkish porch, stood the  tall, elegant figure of the Colonel.    \"Gentlemen,\" he cried, \"welcome to Cray's Folly.\"    He advanced smiling, and in the bright sunlight seemed even more  Mephistophelean than he had seemed in Harley's office.    \"Pedro,\" he called, and a strange-looking Spanish butler who wore his  side-whiskers like a bull fighter appeared behind his master; a sallow,  furtive fellow with whom I determined I should never feel at ease.    However, the Colonel greeted us heartily enough, and conducted us  through a kind of paved, covered courtyard into a great lofty hall.  Indeed it more closely resembled a studio, being partly lighted by a  most curious dome. It was furnished in a manner quite un-English, but  very luxuriously. A magnificent oaken staircase communicated with a  gallery on the left, and at the foot of this staircase, in a mechanical  chair which she managed with astonishing dexterity, sat Madame de  Staemer.    She had snow-white hair crowning the face of a comparatively young  woman, and large, dark-brown eyes which reminded me strangely of the  eyes of some animal"]]]
