His patience was already exhausted, and he proceeded in his  expostulation, in language that she was by no means prepared to endure  with apathy. Lady Lucretia had always been accustomed to deference and  submission; and, having got over something like terror, that was at  first inspired by the imperious manner in which she was now catechised,  her next feeling was that of the warmest resentment. She disdained to  satisfy so insolent a questioner, and even indulged herself in certain  oblique hints calculated to strengthen his suspicions. For some time she  described his folly and presumption in terms of the most ludicrous  sarcasm, and then, suddenly changing her style, bid him never let her  see him more except upon the footing of the most distant acquaintance,  as she was determined never again to subject herself to so unworthy a  treatment. She was happy that he had at length disclosed to her his true  character, and would know how to profit of her present experience to  avoid a repetition of the same danger. All this passed in the full  career of passion on both sides, and Lady Lucretia had no time to  reflect upon what might be the consequence of thus exasperating her  lover.    Count Malvesi left her in all the torments of frenzy. He believed that  this was a premeditated scene, to find a pretence for breaking off an  engagement that was already all but concluded; or, rather, his mind was  racked with a thousand conjectures: he alternately thought that the  injustice might be hers or his own; and he quarrelled with Lady  Lucretia, himself, and the whole world. In this temper he hastened to  the hotel of the English cavalier. The season of expostulation was now  over, and he found himself irresistibly impelled to justify his  precipitation with the lady, by taking for granted that the subject of  his suspicion was beyond the reach of doubt.    Mr. Falkland was at home. The first words of the count were an abrupt  accusation of duplicity in the affair of Lady Lucretia, and a challenge.  The Englishman had an unaffected esteem for Malvesi, who was in reality  a man of considerable merit, and who had been one of Mr. Falkland's  earliest Italian acquaintance, they having originally met at Milan. But  more than this, the possible consequence of a duel in the present  instance burst upon his mind. He had the warmest admiration for Lady  Lucretia, though his feelings were not those of a lover; and he knew  that, however her haughtiness might endeavour to disguise it, she was  impressed with a tender regard for Count Malvesi. He could not bear to  think that any misconduct of his should interrupt the prospects of so  deserving a pair. Guided by these sentiments, he endeavoured to  expostulate with the Italian. But his attempts were ineffectual. His  antagonist was drunk with choler, and would not listen to a word that  tended to check the impetuosity of his thoughts. He traversed the room  with perturbed steps, and even foamed with anguish and fury. Mr.  Falkland, finding that all was to no purpose, told the count, that, if  he would return to-morrow at the same hour, he would attend him to any  scene of action he should think proper to select.    From Count Malvesi Mr. Falkland immediately proceeded to the palace of  Pisani. Here he found considerable difficulty in appeasing the  indignation of Lady Lucretia. His ideas of honour would by no means  allow him to win her to his purpose by disclosing the cartel he had  received; otherwise that disclosure would immediately have operated as  the strongest motive that could have been offered to this disdainful  beauty. But, though she dreaded such an event, the vague apprehension  was not strong enough to induce her instantly to surrender all the  stateliness of her resentment. Mr. Falkland, however, drew so  interesting a picture of the disturbance of Count Malvesi's mind, and  accounted in so flattering a manner for the abruptness of his conduct,  that this, together with the arguments he adduced, completed the  conquest of Lady Lucretia's resentment. Having thus far accomplished his  purpose, he proceeded to disclose to her every thing that had passed.    The next day Count Malvesi appeared, punctual to his appointment, at Mr.  Falkland's hotel. Mr. Falkland came to the door to receive him, but  requested him to enter the house for a moment, as he had still an affair  of three minutes to despatch. They proceeded to a parlour. Here Mr.  Falkland left him, and presently returned leading in Lady Lucretia  herself, adorned in all her charms, and those charms heightened upon the  present occasion by a consciousness of the spirited and generous  condescension she was exerting. Mr. Falkland led her up to the  astonished count; and she, gently laying her hand upon the arm of her  lover, exclaimed with the most attractive grace, \"Will you allow me to  retract the precipitate haughtiness into which I was betrayed?\" The  enraptured count, scarcely able to believe his senses, threw himself  upon his knees before her, and stammered out his reply, signifying that  the precipitation had been all his own, that he only had any forgiveness  to demand, and, though they might pardon, he could never pardon himself  for the sacrilege he had committed against her and this god-like  Englishman. As soon as the first tumults of his joy had subsided, Mr.  Falkland addressed him thus:--    \"Count Malvesi, I feel the utmost pleasure in having thus by peaceful  means disarmed your resentment, and effected your happiness. But I must  confess, you put me to a severe trial. My temper is not less impetuous  and fiery than your own, and it is not at all times that I should have  been thus able to subdue it. But I considered that in reality the  original blame was mine. Though your suspicion was groundless, it was  not absurd. We have been trifling too much in the face of danger. I  ought not, under the present weakness of our nature and forms of  society, to have been so assiduous in my attendance upon this enchanting  woman. It would have been little wonder, if, having so many  opportunities, and playing the preceptor with her as I have done, I had  been entangled before I was aware, and harboured a wish which I might  not afterwards have had courage to subdue. I owed you an atonement for  this imprudence.    \"But the laws of honour are in the utmost degree rigid; and there was  reason to fear that, however anxious I were to be your friend, I might  be obliged to be your murderer. Fortunately, the reputation of my  courage is sufficiently established, not to expose it to any impeachment  by my declining your present defiance. It was lucky, however, that in  our interview of yesterday you found me alone, and that accident by  that means threw the management of the affair into my disposal. If the  transaction should become known, the conclusion will now become known  along with the provocation, and I am satisfied. But if the challenge had  been public, the proofs I had formerly given of courage would not have  excused my present moderation; and, though desirous to have avoided the  combat, it would not have been in my power. Let us hence each of us  learn to avoid haste and indiscretion, the consequences of which may be  inexpiable but with blood; and may Heaven bless you in a consort of whom  I deem you every way worthy!\"    I have already said that this was by no means the only instance, in the  course of his travels, in which Mr. Falkland acquitted himself in the  most brilliant manner as a man of gallantry and virtue. He continued  abroad during several years, every one of which brought some fresh  accession to the estimation in which he was held, as well as to his own  impatience of stain or dishonour. At length he thought proper to return  to England, with the intention of spending the rest of his days at the  residence of his ancestors.          CHAPTER III.      From the moment he entered upon the execution of this purpose, dictated  as it probably was by an unaffected principle of duty, his misfortunes  took their commencement. All I have further to state of his history is  the uninterrupted persecution of a malignant destiny, a series of  adventures that seemed to take their rise in various accidents, but  pointing to one termination. Him they overwhelmed with an anguish he  was of all others least qualified to bear; and these waters of  bitterness, extending beyond him, poured their deadly venom upon others.  I being myself the most unfortunate of their victims.    The person in whom these calamities originated was Mr. Falkland's  nearest neighbour, a man of estate equal to his own, by name Barnabas  Tyrrel. This man one might at first have supposed of all others least  qualified from instruction, or inclined by the habits of his life, to  disturb the enjoyments of a mind so richly endowed as that of Mr.  Falkland. Mr. Tyrrel might have passed for a true model of the English  squire. He was early left under the tuition of his mother, a woman of  narrow capacity, and who had no other child. The only remaining member  of the family it may be necessary to notice was Miss Emily Melville, the  orphan daughter of Mr. Tyrrel's paternal aunt; who now resided in the  family mansion, and was wholly dependent on the benevolence of its  proprietors.    Mrs. Tyrrel appeared to think that there was nothing in the world so  precious as her hopeful Barnabas. Every thing must give way to his  accommodation and advantage; every one must yield the most servile  obedience to his commands. He must not be teased or restricted by any  forms of instruction; and of consequence his proficiency, even in the  arts of writing and reading, was extremely slender. From his birth he  was muscular and sturdy; and, confined to the _ruelle_ of his mother, he  made much such a figure as the whelp-lion that a barbarian might have  given for a lap-dog to his mistress.

The Burman war-boat is formed of the trunk of the magnificent teak tree,  first roughly shaped, and then expanded by means of fire, until it attains  sufficient width to admit two people, sitting abreast. On this a gunwale,  rising a foot above the water, is fixed, and the stem and stern taper to a  point, the latter being much higher than the other, and ornamented with  fret-work and gilding. On the bow is placed a gun, sometimes of a  nine-pounder calibre, but generally smaller, and the centre of the boat is  occupied by the rowers, varying in number from twenty to a hundred, who in  the large boats use the oar, and in the small ones the paddle. A war-boat  in motion is a very pleasing object. The rapidity with which it moves, its  lightness, and small surface above the water, the uniform pulling of the  oar falling in cadence with the songs of the boatmen, who, taking the lead  from one of their number, join in chorus, and keep time with the dip of  their oars; the rich gilding which adorns the boat, and the neat, uniform  dress of the crew, place it, to the eye of a stranger, in a curious and  interesting point of view: and in regard to appearance, induces him, when  contrasting it with an English boat, to give the former the preference. In  point of swiftness, our best men-of-war boats could not compete with them;  and of this superiority they generally availed themselves when an action  was impending.    The boats we had captured at Rangoon, and were cutting down for the  transport of the army, were totally of a different nature. These, built on  the same plan as ours are, but with flat bottoms, belonged to traders, and  were solely adapted to the transport of merchandise. The stern, fancifully  ornamented, rises two or three stages above the deck, and is the seat of  the helmsman. The inside of the boat is filled with goods, and thatched  over, leaving sufficient room underneath to accommodate two or three  families--men, women, and children--who promiscuously take up their abode  there.    This description of boat is not propelled by oars, but by long poles, the  ends of which being placed against the shoulders of the boatmen, they run  the whole length of the boat, and push her forward with considerable  velocity. The space on which they act is formed by strong outriggers on  either side of the boat, which answer the twofold purpose of preventing her  upsetting, which she otherwise would do from the excess of top-weight, and  of increasing her width and accommodation.    The third class of boat is that used throughout the country, and which, to  those who inhabit the banks of rivers, becomes a necessary appendage, and  to many a home. It is a mere canoe, decked with split bamboo, and partly  covered in with mats, so as to afford shelter from the sun by day, and the  dews by night. One man steers, and two others either row or paddle; but,  when the wind is favourable, they use a sail. This is generally made at the  moment, with the scarfs they wear over their shoulders, tied together. Two  bamboos constitute the mast and yard, the sail being fastened between them;  yet, with this fragile rigging, and with the gunwale of the boat almost  under water with every puff of wind, they stem the most rapid currents at  all seasons of the year, and, such is their skill in steering, seldom meet  with an accident. It was in these boats that the majority of the  inhabitants of Rangoon, and the adjacent villages, fled upon our approach;  and these formed their only habitation during the many months they kept  aloof from us.    _Two Years in Ava_.           *       *       *       *       *        MISCELLANIES.           *       *       *       *       *      SONNET.

THE VEIL OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS.      Maria Stuart has been canonized, and placed among the martyrs by the  Jesuits. Of course there are relics of hers. Her prayer-book was long shown  in France; and her apologist published in an English journal a sonnet which  she was said to have composed, and to have written with her own hand in  this book. A celebrated German actress, Mrs. Hendel-Schutz, who excited  admiration by her attitudes, and also performed Schiller's \"Maria\" with  great applause in several cities of Germany, affirmed that a cross which  she wore on her neck was the very same that once belonged to the  unfortunate queen. Relics of this description have never yet been subjected  to the proof of their authenticity. But if there is anything which may be  reasonably believed to have been once the property of the queen, _it is the  veil with which she covered her head on the scaffold, after the  executioner_, whether from awkwardness or confusion is uncertain, _had  wounded the unfortunate victim in the shoulder by a false blow_. This veil  still exists, and is in the possession of Sir J.C. Hippisley, who claims to  be descended from the Stuart's by the mother's side. He had an engraving  made from it by Matteo Diottavi, in Rome, 1818, and gave copies to his  friends.    The veil is embroidered with gold spangles by (as is said) the queen's own  hand, in regular rows crossing each other, so as to form small squares, and  edged with a gold border, to which another border has been subsequently  joined, in which the following words are embroidered in letters of gold:--        \"Velum Serenissimae Mariae, Scotiae et Galliae Reginae Martyris, quo      induebatur dum ab Heretica ad mortem iniustissimam condemnata fuit.      Anno Sal. MDLXXXVI. a nobilissima matrona Anglicana diu conservatum      et tandem, donationis ergo Deo, et Societati Jesu consecratum.\"    On the plate there is an inscription, with a double certificate of its  authenticity, which states, that this veil, a family treasure of the  expelled house of Stuart, was finally in possession of the last branch of  that family, the cardinal of York, who preserved it for many years in his  private chapel, among the most precious relics, and at his death bequeathed  it to Sir J. Hippisley, together with a valuable Plutarch, and a Codex with  painted (illuminated) letters, and a gold coin struck in Scotland in the  reign of queen Mary; and it was specially consecrated by Pope Pius VII. in  his palace on the Quirinal, April 29, 1818. Sir John Hippisley, during a  former residence at Rome, had been very intimate with the cardinal of York,  and was instrumental in obtaining for him, when he with the other cardinals  emigrated to Venice in 1798, a pension of L4,000. a-year from the Prince of  Wales, now King George IV.; but for which, the fugitive cardinal, all whose  revenues were seized by the French, would have been exposed to the greatest  distress. The cardinal desired to requite this service by the bequest of  what he considered so valuable. According to a note on the plate, the veil  is eighty-nine English inches long, and forty-three broad, so that it seems  to have been rather a kind of shawl or scarf than a veil. If we remember  rightly, Melville in his Memoirs, which Schiller had read, speaks of a  handkerchief belonging to the queen, which she gave away before her death,  and Schiller founds upon this anecdote the well-known words of the farewell  scene, addressed to Hannah Kennedy.        \"Accept this handkerchief! with my own hand      For thee I've work'd it in my hours of sadness      And interwoven with my scalding tears:      With this thou'lt bind my eyes.\"      DREAMS.        Oh! there is a dream of early youth,      And it never comes again;    'Tis a vision of light, of life, and truth,      That flits across the brain:    And love is the theme of that early dream.      So wild, so warm, so new,    That in all our after years I deem,      That early dream we rue.      Oh! there is a dream of maturer years,      More turbulent by far;    'Tis a vision of blood, and of woman's tears,      For the theme of that dream is war:    And we toil in the field of danger and death,      And shout in the battle array,    Till we find that fame is a bodyless breath,      That vanisheth away.      Oh! there is a dream of hoary age,      'Tis a vision of gold in store--    Of sums noted down on the figured page,      To be counted o'er and o'er:    And we fondly trust in our glittering dust,      As a refuge from grief and pain,    Till our limbs are laid on that last dark bed,      Where the wealth of the world is vain.      And is it thus, from man's birth to his grave--      In the path which all are treading?    Is there naught in that long career to save      From remorse and self-upbraiding?    O yes, there's a dream so pure, so bright,      That the being to whom it is given,    Hath bathed in a sea of living light--      And the theme of that dream is Heaven.       "]]]
