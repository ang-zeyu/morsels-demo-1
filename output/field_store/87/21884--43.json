[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9172"],[0,"A Study of Association in Insanity (#6)"],[1,"classification possesses results from the introduction of more or less  arbitrary criteria for the differentiation of the various types of  reactions. The question might arise, To what extent do the  distinctions thus made correspond to reality? To consider, for  instance, our rule for the placing of sound reactions (50 per cent of  the sounds of the shorter word to be present, in the same order, in  the other word): when a given reaction (_man--minstrel_) is in  accordance with the rule assigned under the heading of sound  reactions, can it be assumed that sound similarity and not some other  relationship is the determining factor of the association in question?  Or when in, a given instance (_cabbage--cobweb_) the sound  similarity falls somewhat short of the standard required by the rule,  can it be assumed that sound similarity is not, after all, the  determining factor?    Similar questions may, of course, arise in connection with other  subdivisions.    It must, indeed, be conceded that objective methods can reveal but  indirectly and with uncertainty the inner mechanism which produces any  association and that in any given instance it would be impossible to  establish the correctness of grouping in accordance with such    methods. However, to decide that question for any given reaction is  really not necessary in practice, since an error made through wrongly  placing one, two, or three reactions tinder any heading is of no  significance; the types acquire importance only when represented by  large numbers in a record under consideration; and when many reactions  fall tinder a single heading the likelihood of error, as affecting the  record as a whole, is by that fact alone greatly reduced.    The whole question might more profitably be approached from another  point of view: To what extent are the distinctions of this  classification useful? An answer to this question can be found only in  the results.        § 7. ANALYSIS OF PATHOLOGICAL MATERIAL      We present in Table IV, the results of a statistical examination of  the records obtained from certain groups of normal subjects and from  some groups of insane subjects.    The normal groups have been studied for the purpose of determining the  frequency and manner of occurrence among normal subjects of the  various of abnormal reactions. It seemed best for this purpose to  consider separately the records of those subjects who gave an  unusually large number of individual reactions. Fifty-three records  containing fifteen or more individual reactions were found after a  fairly diligent search among our normal test records. In the other  groups of subjects--persons of common school education, persons of  collegiate education, and children--we included no records containing  more than ten individual reactions.    The more striking departures from average normal figures are indicated  in the table by the use of heavy type.    This table reveals associational tendencies as occurring in connection  with the psychoses studied. A better insight into the nature of these  tendencies can be gained by a special analysis of the test of each  clinical group.      DEMENTIA PRÆCOX    In this psychosis we find the number of individual reactions far  exceeding not only that of the normal but that of any other psychosis  which we studied. To a corresponding extent we find the number of the  highest type of normal reactions--the common specific  reactions--reduced.      TABLE IV.

A further examination of  the individual"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9173"],[0,"Youth: Its Education, Regimen, and Hygiene (#6)"],[1,"as compared with 1870 is no less than 70 per  cent.\"[11] Personal interest in and the old native sense of  responsibility for results, ownership and use of the finished  products, which have been the inspiration and soul of work in all the  past, are in more and more fields gone. Those who realize how small a  proportion of the young male population train or even engage in  amateur sports with zest and regularity, how very few and picked men  strive for records, and how immediate and amazing are the results of  judicious training, can best understand how far below his  possibilities as a motor being the average modern man goes through  life, and how far short in this respect he falls from fulfilling  nature's design for him.    For unnumbered generations primitive man in the nomad age wandered,  made perhaps annual migrations, and bore heavy burdens, while we ride  relatively unencumbered. He tilled the reluctant soil, digging with  rude implements where we use machines of many man-power. In the stone,  iron, and bronze age, he shaped stone and metals, and wrought with  infinite pains and effort, products that we buy without even knowledge  of the processes by which they are made. As hunter he followed game,  which, when found, he chased, fought, and overcame in a struggle  perhaps desperate, while we shoot it at a distance with little risk or  effort. In warfare he fought hand to hand and eye to eye, while we  kill \"with as much black powder as can be put in a woman's thimble.\"  He caught and domesticated scores of species of wild animals and  taught them to serve him; fished with patience and skill that  compensated his crude tools, weapons, implements, and tackle; danced  to exhaustion in the service of his gods or in memory of his forebears  imitating every animal, rehearsing all his own activities in mimic  form to the point of exhaustion, while we move through a few figures  in closed spaces. He dressed hides, wove baskets which we can not  reproduce, and fabrics which we only poorly imitate by machinery, made  pottery which set our fashions, played games that invigorated body and  soul. His courtship was with feats of prowess and skill, and meant  physical effort and endurance.    Adolescent girls, especially in the middle classes, in upper grammar  and high school grades, during the golden age for nascent muscular  development, suffer perhaps most of all in this respect. Grave as are  the evils of child labor, I believe far more pubescents in this  country now suffer from too little than from too much physical  exercise, while most who suffer from work do so because it is too  uniform, one-sided, accessory, or performed under unwholesome  conditions, and not because it is excessive in amount. Modern industry  has thus largely ceased to be a means of physical development and  needs to be offset by compensating modes of activity. Many  labor-saving devices increase neural strain, so that one of the  problems of our time is how to preserve and restore nerve energy.  Under present industrial systems this must grow worse and not better  in the future. Healthy natural industries will be less and less open  to the young. This is the new situation that now confronts those  concerned for motor education, if they would only make good what is  lost.    Some of the results of these conditions are seen in average  measurements of dimensions, proportions, strength, skill, and control.  Despite the excellence of the few, the testimony of those most  familiar with the bodies of children and adults, and their physical  powers, gives evidence of the ravages of modern modes of life that,  without a wide-spread motor revival, can bode only degeneration for  our nation and our race. The number of common things that can not be  done at all; the large proportion of our youth who must be exempted  from any kinds of activity or a great amount of any; the thin limbs,  collapsed shoulders or chests, the bilateral asymmetry, weak hearts,  lungs, eyes, puny and bad muddy or pallid complexions, tired ways,  automatism, dyspeptic stomachs, the effects of youthful error or of  impoverished heredity, delicate and tender nurture, often, alas, only  too necessary, show the lamentable and cumulative effects of long  neglect of the motor abilities, the most educable of all man's powers,  and perhaps the most important for his well-being. If the unfaithful  stewards of these puny and shameful bodies had again, as in Sparta, to  strip and stand before stern judges and render them account, and be  smitten with a conviction of their weakness, guilty deformity, and  arrest of growth; if they were brought to realize how they are fallen  beings, as weak as stern theologians once deemed them depraved, and  how great their need of physical salvation, we might hope again for a  physical renaissance. Such a rebirth the world has seen but twice or  perhaps thrice, and each was followed by the two or three of the  brightest culture periods of history, and formed an epoch in the  advancement of the kingdom of man. A vast body of evidence could be  collected from the writings of anthropologists showing how superior  unspoiled savages are to civilized man in correct or esthetic  proportions of body, in many forms of endurance of fatigue, hardship,  and power to bear exposure, in the development and preservation of  teeth and hair, in keenness of senses, absence of deformities, as well  as immunity to many of our diseases. Their women are stronger and bear  hardship and exposure, monthly periods and childbirth, better.  Civilization is so hard on the body that some have called it a  disease, despite the arts that keep puny bodies alive to a greater  average age, and our greater protection from contagious and germ  diseases.    The progressive realization of these tendencies has prompted most of  the best recent and great changes motor-ward in education and also in  personal regimen. Health- and strength-giving agencies have put to  school the large motor areas of the brain, so long neglected, and have  vastly enlarged their scope. Thousands of youth are now inspired with  new enthusiasm for physical development; and new institutions of many  kinds and grades have arisen, with a voluminous literature, unnumbered  specialists, specialties, new apparatus, tests, movements, methods,  and theories; and the press, the public, and the church are awakened  to a fresh interest in the body and its powers. All this is  magnificent, but sadly inadequate to cope with the new needs and  dangers, which are vastly greater.    [Footnote 1: Dieterich.

The practical success of this application was so  great that the Hughlings-Jackson \"three-level theory\" is now the  established basis of English diagnosis. He conceived the nervous  mechanism as composed of three systems, arranged in the form of a  hierarchy, the higher including the lower, and yet each having a  certain degree of independence. The first level represents the type of  simplest reflex and involuntary movement and is localized in the gray  matter of the spinal cord, medulla, and pons. The second, or middle  level, comprises those structures which receive sensory impulses from  the cells of the lowest level instead of directly from the periphery  or the non-nervous tissues. The motor cells of this middle level also  discharge into the motor mechanisms of the lowest level. Jackson  located these middle level structures in the cortex of the central  convolutions, the basal ganglia and the centers of the special senses  in the cortex. The highest level bears the same relation to the middle  level that it bears to the lowest i.e., no continuous connection  between the highest and the lowest is assumed; the structures of the  middle level mediate between them as a system of relays. According to  this hierarchical arrangement of the nervous system, the lowest level  which is the simplest and oldest \"contains the mechanism for the  simple fundamental movements in reflexes and involuntary reactions.  The second level regroups these simple movements by combinations and  associations of cortical structure in wider, more complex mechanisms,  producing a higher class of movements. The highest level unifies the  whole nervous system and, according to Jackson, is the anatomical  basis of mind.\"    For a fuller account of this theory see Burk: From Fundamental to  Accessory in the Nervous System and of Movements.
