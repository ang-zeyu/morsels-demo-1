There both, I thought, the eagle and myself  Did burn; and so intense th' imagin'd flames,  That needs my sleep was broken off.  As erst  Achilles shook himself, and round him roll'd  His waken'd eyeballs wond'ring where he was,  Whenas his mother had from Chiron fled  To Scyros, with him sleeping in her arms;  E'en thus I shook me, soon as from my face  The slumber parted, turning deadly pale,  Like one ice-struck with dread.  Solo at my side  My comfort stood: and the bright sun was now  More than two hours aloft: and to the sea  My looks were turn'd.  \"Fear not,\" my master cried,  \"Assur'd we are at happy point.  Thy strength  Shrink not, but rise dilated.  Thou art come  To Purgatory now.  Lo! there the cliff  That circling bounds it!  Lo! the entrance there,  Where it doth seem disparted! re the dawn  Usher'd the daylight, when thy wearied soul  Slept in thee, o'er the flowery vale beneath  A lady came, and thus bespake me: \"I  Am Lucia.  Suffer me to take this man,  Who slumbers.  Easier so his way shall speed.\"  Sordello and the other gentle shapes  Tarrying, she bare thee up: and, as day shone,  This summit reach'd: and I pursued her steps.  Here did she place thee.  First her lovely eyes  That open entrance show'd me; then at once  She vanish'd with thy sleep.  Like one, whose doubts  Are chas'd by certainty, and terror turn'd  To comfort on discovery of the truth,  Such was the change in me: and as my guide  Beheld me fearless, up along the cliff  He mov'd, and I behind him, towards the height.    Reader! thou markest how my theme doth rise,  Nor wonder therefore, if more artfully  I prop the structure! nearer now we drew,  Arriv'd' whence in that part, where first a breach  As of a wall appear'd, I could descry  A portal, and three steps beneath, that led  For inlet there, of different colour each,  And one who watch'd, but spake not yet a word.  As more and more mine eye did stretch its view,  I mark'd him seated on the highest step,  In visage such, as past my power to bear.    Grasp'd in his hand a naked sword, glanc'd back  The rays so toward me, that I oft in vain  My sight directed.  \"Speak from whence ye stand:\"  He cried: \"What would ye?  Where is your escort?  Take heed your coming upward harm ye not.\"    \"A heavenly dame, not skilless of these things,\"  Replied the' instructor, \"told us, even now,  \"Pass that way: here the gate is.\" --\"And may she  Befriending prosper your ascent,\" resum'd  The courteous keeper of the gate: \"Come then  Before our steps.\"  We straightway thither came.    The lowest stair was marble white so smooth  And polish'd, that therein my mirror'd form  Distinct I saw.  The next of hue more dark  Than sablest grain, a rough and singed block,  Crack'd lengthwise and across.  The third, that lay  Massy above, seem'd porphyry, that flam'd  Red as the life-blood spouting from a vein.  On this God's angel either foot sustain'd,  Upon the threshold seated, which appear'd  A rock of diamond.  Up the trinal steps  My leader cheerily drew me.  \"Ask,\" said he,    \"With humble heart, that he unbar the bolt.\"    Piously at his holy feet devolv'd  I cast me, praying him for pity's sake  That he would open to me: but first fell  Thrice on my bosom prostrate.  Seven times  The letter, that denotes the inward stain,  He on my forehead with the blunted point  Of his drawn sword inscrib'd.  And \"Look,\" he cried,  \"When enter'd, that thou wash these scars away.\"    Ashes, or earth ta'en dry out of the ground,  Were of one colour with the robe he wore.  From underneath that vestment forth he drew  Two keys of metal twain: the one was gold,  Its fellow silver.  With the pallid first,  And next the burnish'd, he so ply'd the gate,  As to content me well.  \"Whenever one  Faileth of these, that in the keyhole straight  It turn not, to this alley then expect  Access in vain.\"  Such were the words he spake.  \"One is more precious: but the other needs  Skill and sagacity, large share of each,  Ere its good task to disengage the knot  Be worthily perform'd.  From Peter these  I hold, of him instructed, that I err  Rather in opening than in keeping fast;  So but the suppliant at my feet implore.\"    Then of that hallow'd gate he thrust the door,  Exclaiming, \"Enter, but this warning hear:  He forth again departs who looks behind.\"    As in the hinges of that sacred ward  The swivels turn'd, sonorous metal strong,  Harsh was the grating; nor so surlily  Roar'd the Tarpeian, when by force bereft  Of good Metellus, thenceforth from his loss  To leanness doom'd.  Attentively I turn'd,  List'ning the thunder, that first issued forth;  And \"We praise thee, O God,\" methought I heard  In accents blended with sweet melody.  The strains came o'er mine ear, e'en as the sound  Of choral voices, that in solemn chant  With organ mingle, and, now high and clear,  Come swelling, now float indistinct away.          CANTO X    When we had passed the threshold of the gate  (Which the soul's ill affection doth disuse,  Making the crooked seem the straighter path),  I heard its closing sound.  Had mine eyes turn'd,  For that offence what plea might have avail'd?    We mounted up the riven rock, that wound  On either side alternate, as the wave  Flies and advances.  \"Here some little art  Behooves us,\" said my leader, \"that our steps  Observe the varying flexure of the path.\"    Thus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb  The moon once more o'erhangs her wat'ry couch,  Ere we that strait have threaded.  But when free  We came and open, where the mount above  One solid mass retires, I spent, with toil,  And both, uncertain of the way, we stood,  Upon a plain more lonesome, than the roads  That traverse desert wilds.  From whence the brink  Borders upon vacuity, to foot  Of the steep bank, that rises still, the space  Had measur'd thrice the stature of a man:  And, distant as mine eye could wing its flight,  To leftward now and now to right dispatch'd,  That cornice equal in extent appear'd.    Not yet our feet had on that summit mov'd,  When I discover'd that the bank around,  Whose proud uprising all ascent denied,  Was marble white, and so exactly wrought  With quaintest sculpture, that not there alone  Had Polycletus, but e'en nature's self  Been sham'd.  The angel who came down to earth  With tidings of the peace so many years  Wept for in vain, that op'd the heavenly gates  From their long interdict, before us seem'd,  In a sweet act, so sculptur'd to the life,  He look'd no silent image. One had sworn  He had said, \"Hail!\" for she was imag'd there,  By whom the key did open to God's love,  And in her act as sensibly impress  That word, \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord,\"  As figure seal'd on wax.  \"Fix not thy mind  On one place only,\" said the guide belov'd,  Who had me near him on that part where lies  The heart of man.  My sight forthwith I turn'd  And mark'd, behind the virgin mother's form,  Upon that side, where he, that mov'd me, stood,  Another story graven on the rock.    I passed athwart the bard, and drew me near,  That it might stand more aptly for my view.  There in the self-same marble were engrav'd  The cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark,  That from unbidden office awes mankind.  Before it came much people; and the whole  Parted in seven quires.  One sense cried, \"Nay,\"  Another, \"Yes, they sing.\"  Like doubt arose  Betwixt the eye and smell, from the curl'd fume  Of incense breathing up the well-wrought toil.  Preceding the blest vessel, onward came  With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,  Sweet Israel's harper: in that hap he seem'd  Less and yet more than kingly.  Opposite,  At a great palace, from the lattice forth  Look'd Michol, like a lady full of scorn  And sorrow.  To behold the tablet next,  Which at the hack of Michol whitely shone,  I mov'd me.  There was storied on the rock  The' exalted glory of the Roman prince,  Whose mighty worth mov'd Gregory to earn  His mighty conquest, Trajan th' Emperor.  A widow at his bridle stood, attir'd  In tears and mourning.  Round about them troop'd  Full throng of knights, and overhead in gold  The eagles floated, struggling with the wind.    The wretch appear'd amid all these to say:  \"Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart  My son is murder'd.\"  He replying seem'd;    \"Wait now till I return.\" And she, as one  Made hasty by her grief; \"O sire, if thou  Dost not return?\"--\"Where I am, who then is,  May right thee.\"--\"What to thee is other's good,  If thou neglect thy own?\"--\"Now comfort thee,\"  At length he answers.  \"It beseemeth well  My duty be perform'd, ere I move hence:  So justice wills; and pity bids me stay.\"    He, whose ken nothing new surveys, produc'd  That visible speaking, new to us and strange  The like not found on earth.  Fondly I gaz'd  Upon those patterns of meek humbleness,  Shapes yet more precious for their artist's sake,  When \"Lo,\" the poet whisper'd, \"where this way  (But slack their pace), a multitude advance.  These to the lofty steps shall guide us on.\"    Mine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights  Their lov'd allurement, were not slow to turn.    Reader! would not that amaz'd thou miss  Of thy good purpose, hearing how just God  Decrees our debts be cancel'd.  Ponder not  The form of suff'ring.  Think on what succeeds,  Think that at worst beyond the mighty doom  It cannot pass.  \"Instructor,\" I began,  \"What I see hither tending, bears no trace  Of human semblance, nor of aught beside  That my foil'd sight can guess.\"  He answering thus:  \"So courb'd to earth, beneath their heavy teems  Of torment stoop they, that mine eye at first  Struggled as thine.  But look intently thither,  An disentangle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8800"],[0,"An Index of The Divine Comedy (#6)"],[1,"rul'd,  Nature, in generation, must the path  Trac'd by the generator, still pursue  Unswervingly.  Thus place I in thy sight  That, which was late behind thee.  But, in sign  Of more affection for thee, 't is my will  Thou wear this corollary.  Nature ever  Finding discordant fortune, like all seed  Out of its proper climate, thrives but ill.  And were the world below content to mark  And work on the foundation nature lays,  It would not lack supply of excellence.  But ye perversely to religion strain  Him, who was born to gird on him the sword,  And of the fluent phrasemen make your king;  Therefore your steps have wander'd from the paths.\"          CANTO IX    After solution of my doubt, thy Charles,  O fair Clemenza, of the treachery spake  That must befall his seed: but, \"Tell it not,\"  Said he, \"and let the destin'd years come round.\"  Nor may I tell thee more, save that the meed  Of sorrow well-deserv'd shall quit your wrongs.    And now the visage of that saintly light  Was to the sun, that fills it, turn'd again,  As to the good, whose plenitude of bliss  Sufficeth all.  O ye misguided souls!  Infatuate, who from such a good estrange  Your hearts, and bend your gaze on vanity,  Alas for you!--And lo! toward me, next,  Another of those splendent forms approach'd,  That, by its outward bright'ning, testified  The will it had to pleasure me.  The eyes  Of Beatrice, resting, as before,  Firmly upon me, manifested forth  Approval of my wish.  \"And O,\" I cried,  \"Blest spirit! quickly be my will perform'd;  And prove thou to me, that my inmost thoughts  I can reflect on thee.\"  Thereat the light,  That yet was new to me, from the recess,  Where it before was singing, thus began,  As one who joys in kindness: \"In that part  Of the deprav'd Italian land, which lies  Between Rialto, and the fountain-springs  Of Brenta and of Piava, there doth rise,  But to no lofty eminence, a hill,  From whence erewhile a firebrand did descend,  That sorely sheet the region.  From one root  I and it sprang; my name on earth Cunizza:  And here I glitter, for that by its light  This star o'ercame me.  Yet I naught repine,  Nor grudge myself the cause of this my lot,  Which haply vulgar hearts can scarce conceive.    \"This jewel, that is next me in our heaven,  Lustrous and costly, great renown hath left,  And not to perish, ere these hundred years  Five times absolve their round.  Consider thou,  If to excel be worthy man's endeavour,  When such life may attend the first.  Yet they  Care not for this, the crowd that now are girt  By Adice and Tagliamento, still  Impenitent, tho' scourg'd.  The hour is near,  When for their stubbornness at Padua's marsh  The water shall be chang'd, that laves Vicena  And where Cagnano meets with Sile, one  Lords it, and bears his head aloft, for whom  The web is now a-warping.  Feltro too  Shall sorrow for its godless shepherd's fault,  Of so deep stain, that never, for the like,  Was Malta's bar unclos'd.  Too large should be  The skillet, that would hold Ferrara's blood,  And wearied he, who ounce by ounce would weight it,  The which this priest, in show of party-zeal,  Courteous will give; nor will the gift ill suit  The country's custom.  We descry above,  Mirrors, ye call them thrones, from which to us  Reflected shine the judgments of our God:  Whence these our sayings we avouch for good.\"    She ended, and appear'd on other thoughts  Intent, re-ent'ring on the wheel she late  Had left.  That other joyance meanwhile wax'd  A thing to marvel at, in splendour glowing,  Like choicest ruby stricken by the sun,  For, in that upper clime, effulgence comes  Of gladness, as here laughter: and below,  As the mind saddens, murkier grows the shade.    \"God seeth all: and in him is thy sight,\"  Said I, \"blest Spirit!  Therefore will of his  Cannot to thee be dark.  Why then delays  Thy voice to satisfy my wish untold,  That voice which joins the inexpressive song,  Pastime of heav'n, the which those ardours sing,  That cowl them with six shadowing wings outspread?  I would not wait thy asking, wert thou known  To me, as thoroughly I to thee am known.\"    He forthwith answ'ring, thus his words began:  \"The valley' of waters, widest next to that  Which doth the earth engarland, shapes its course,  Between discordant shores, against the sun  Inward so far, it makes meridian there,  Where was before th' horizon.  Of that vale  Dwelt I upon the shore, 'twixt Ebro's stream  And Macra's, that divides with passage brief  Genoan bounds from Tuscan.  East and west  Are nearly one to Begga and my land,  Whose haven erst was with its own blood warm.  Who knew my name were wont to call me Folco:  And I did bear impression of this heav'n,  That now bears mine: for not with fiercer flame  Glow'd Belus' daughter, injuring alike  Sichaeus and Creusa, than did I,  Long as it suited the unripen'd down  That fledg'd my cheek: nor she of Rhodope,  That was beguiled of Demophoon;  Nor Jove's son, when the charms of Iole  Were shrin'd within his heart.  And yet there hides  No sorrowful repentance here, but mirth,  Not for the fault (that doth not come to mind),  But for the virtue, whose o'erruling sway  And providence have wrought thus quaintly.  Here  The skill is look'd into, that fashioneth  With such effectual working, and the good  Discern'd, accruing to this upper world  From that below.  But fully to content  Thy wishes, all that in this sphere have birth,  Demands my further parle.  Inquire thou wouldst,  Who of this light is denizen, that here  Beside me sparkles, as the sun-beam doth  On the clear wave.  Know then, the soul of Rahab  Is in that gladsome harbour, to our tribe  United, and the foremost rank assign'd.  He to that heav'n, at which the shadow ends  Of your sublunar world, was taken up,  First, in Christ's triumph, of all souls redeem'd:  For well behoov'd, that, in some part of heav'n,  She should remain a trophy, to declare  The mighty contest won with either palm;  For that she favour'd first the high exploit  Of Joshua on the holy land, whereof  The Pope recks little now.  Thy city, plant  Of him, that on his Maker turn'd the back,  And of whose envying so much woe hath sprung,  Engenders and expands the cursed flower,  That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs,  Turning the shepherd to a wolf.  For this,  The gospel and great teachers laid aside,  The decretals, as their stuft margins show,  Are the sole study.  Pope and Cardinals,  Intent on these, ne'er journey but in thought  To Nazareth, where Gabriel op'd his wings.  Yet it may chance, erelong, the Vatican,  And other most selected parts of Rome,  That were the grave of Peter's soldiery,  Shall be deliver'd from the adult'rous bond.\"          CANTO X    Looking into his first-born with the love,  Which breathes from both eternal, the first Might  Ineffable, whence eye or mind  Can roam, hath in such order all dispos'd,  As none may see and fail to enjoy.  Raise, then,  O reader! to the lofty wheels, with me,  Thy ken directed to the point, whereat  One motion strikes on th' other.  There begin  Thy wonder of the mighty Architect,  Who loves his work so inwardly, his eye  Doth ever watch it.  See, how thence oblique  Brancheth the circle, where the planets roll  To pour their wished influence on the world;  Whose path not bending thus, in heav'n above  Much virtue would be lost, and here on earth,  All power well nigh extinct: or, from direct  Were its departure distant more or less,  I' th' universal order, great defect  Must, both in heav'n and here beneath, ensue.    Now rest thee, reader! on thy bench, and muse  Anticipative of the feast to come;  So shall delight make thee not feel thy toil.  Lo! I have set before thee, for thyself  Feed now: the matter I indite, henceforth  Demands entire my thought.  Join'd with the part,  Which late we told of, the great minister  Of nature, that upon the world imprints  The virtue of the heaven, and doles out  Time for us with his beam, went circling on  Along the spires, where each hour sooner comes;  And I was with him, weetless of ascent,  As one, who till arriv'd, weets not his coming.    For Beatrice, she who passeth on  So suddenly from good to better, time  Counts not the act, oh then how great must needs  Have been her brightness!  What she was i' th' sun  (Where I had enter'd), not through change of hue,  But light transparent--did I summon up  Genius, art, practice--I might not so speak,  It should be e'er imagin'd: yet believ'd  It may be, and the sight be justly crav'd.  And if our fantasy fail of such height,  What marvel, since no eye above the sun  Hath ever travel'd?  Such are they dwell here,  Fourth family of the Omnipotent Sire,  Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows;  And holds them still enraptur'd with the view.  And thus to me Beatrice: \"Thank, oh thank,  The Sun of angels, him, who by his grace  To this perceptible hath lifted thee.\"    Never was heart in such devotion bound,  And with complacency so absolute  Dispos'd to render up itself to God,  As mine was at those words: and so entire  The love for Him, that held me, it eclips'd  Beatrice in oblivion.  Naught displeas'd  Was she, but smil'd thereat so joyously,  That of her laughing eyes the radiance brake  And scatter'd my collected mind abroad.    Then saw I a bright band, in liveliness  Surpassing, who themselves did make the crown,  And us their centre: yet more sweet in voice,  Than in their visage beaming.  Cinctur'd thus,  Sometime Latona's daughter we behold,  When the impregnate air retains the thread,  That weaves her zone.  In the celestial court,  Whence I return, are many jewels found,  So dear and beautiful, they cannot brook  Transporting from that realm: and of these lights  Such was the song.  Who doth not prune his wing  To soar up thither, let him look from thence  For tidings from the dumb.  When, singing thus,  Those burning suns that circled round us thrice,  As nearest stars around the"]]]
