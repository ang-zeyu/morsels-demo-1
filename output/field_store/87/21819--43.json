The garland  and blue dress were made of malachite, _lapis lazuli_, and various  precious stones.    \"Aha, my fair Phoenician, I know you well!\" thought I exultingly,  \"though I never saw you before with a harp in your hand. But were you  not gathering flowers, O lovely daughter of Agenor, when that celestial  animal, that masquerading god, put himself so cunningly in your way to  be admired and caressed, until you unsuspiciously placed yourself on his  back? That explains the garland. I shall have a word to say about this  pretty thing to my learned and very superior host.\"    The statue stood on an octagonal pedestal of a highly polished  slaty-gray stone, and on each of its eight faces was a picture in which  one human figure appeared. Now, from gazing on the statue itself I fell  to contemplating one of these pictures with a very keen interest, for  the figure, I recognized, was a portrait of the beautiful girl Yoletta.  The picture was a winter landscape. The earth was white, not with snow,  but with hoar frost; the distant trees, clothed by the frozen moisture  as if with a feathery foliage, looked misty against the whitey-blue  wintry sky. In the foreground, on the pale frosted grass, stood the  girl, in a dark maroon dress, with silver embroidery on the bosom, and a  dark red cap on her head. Close to her drooped the slender terminal  twigs of a tree, sparkling with rime and icicle, and on the twigs were  several small snow-white birds, hopping and fluttering down towards her  outstretched hand; while she gazed up at them with flushed cheeks, and  lips parting with a bright, joyous smile.    Presently, while I stood admiring this most lovely work, the young man I  have mentioned as having raised Yoletta from the ground at the grave  came to my side and remarked, smiling: \"You have noticed the  resemblance.\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" I returned; \"she is painted to the life.\"    \"This is not Yoletta's portrait,\" he replied, \"though it is very like  her;\" and then, when I looked at him incredulously, he pointed to some  letters under the picture, saying: \"Do you not see the name and date?\"    Finding that I could not read the words, I hazarded the remark that it  was Yoletta's mother, perhaps.    \"This portrait was painted four centuries ago,\" he said, with surprise  in his accent; and then he turned aside, thinking me, perhaps, a rather  dull and ignorant person.    I did not want him to go away with that impression, and remarked,  pointing to the statue I have spoken of: \"I fancy I know very well who  that is--that is Europa.\"    \"Europa? That is a name I never heard; I doubt that any one in the house  ever bore it.\" Then, with a half-puzzled smile, he added: \"How could you  possibly know unless you were told? No, that is Mistrelde. It was  formerly the custom of the house for the Mother to ride on a white bull  at the harvest festival. Mistrelde was the last to observe it.\"    \"Oh, I see,\" I returned lamely, though I didn't see at all. The  indifferent way in which he spoke of _centuries_ in connection with  this brilliant and apparently fresh-painted picture rather took me  aback.    Presently he condescended to say something more. Pointing to the marks  or characters which I could not read, he said: \"You have seen the name  of Yoletta here, and that and the resemblance misled you. You must know  that there has always been a Yoletta in this house. This was the  daughter of Mistrelde, the Mother, who died young and left but eight  children; and when this work was made their portraits were placed on the  eight faces of the pedestal.\"    \"Thanks for telling me,\" I said, wondering if it was all true, or only a  fantastic romance.    He then motioned me to follow him, and we quitted that room where it had  been decided that we were not to sup.              Chapter 4    We came to a large portico-like place open on three sides to the air,  the roof being supported by slender columns. We were now on the opposite  side of the house and looked upon the river, which was not more than a  couple of hundred yards from the terrace or platform on which it stood.  The ground here sloped rapidly to the banks, and, like that in the  front, was a wilderness with rock and patches of tall fern and thickets  of thorn and bramble, with a few trees of great size. Nor was wild life  wanting in this natural park; some deer were feeding near the bank,  while on the water numbers of wild duck and other water-fowl were  disporting themselves, splashing and flapping over the surface and  uttering shrill cries.    The people of the house were already assembled, standing and sitting by  the small tables. There was a lively hum of conversation, which ceased  on my entrance; then those who were sitting stood up and the whole  company fixed its eyes on me, which was rather disconcerting.    The old gentleman, standing in the midst of the people, now bent on me a  long, scrutinizing gaze; he appeared to be waiting for me to speak, and,  finding that I remained silent, he finally addressed me with solemnity.  \"Smith,\" he said--and I did not like it--\"the meeting with you today was  to me and to all of us a very strange experience: I little thought that  an even stranger one awaited me, that before you break bread in this  house in which you have found shelter, I should have to remind you that  you are now in a house.\"    \"Yes, I know I am,\" I said, and then added: \"I'm sure, sir, I appreciate  your kindness in bringing me here.\"    He had perhaps expected something more or something entirely different  from me, as he continued standing with his eyes fixed on me. Then with a  sigh, and looking round him, he said in a dissatisfied tone: \"My  children, let us begin, and for the present put out of our minds this  matter which has been troubling us.\"    He then motioned me to a seat at his own table, where I was pleased to  have a place since the lovely Yoletta was also there.    I am not particular about what I eat, as with me good digestion waits on  appetite, and so long as I get a bellyful--to use a good old English  word--I am satisfied. On this particular occasion, with or without a  pretty girl at the table, I could have consumed a haggis--that greatest  abomination ever invented by flesh-eating barbarians--I was so  desperately hungry. It was therefore a disappointment when nothing more  substantial than a plate of whitey-green, crisp-looking stuff resembling  endive, was placed before me by one of the picturesque handmaidens. It  was cold and somewhat bitter to the taste, but hunger compelled me to  eat it even to the last green leaf; then, when I began to wonder if it  would be right to ask for more, to my great relief other more succulent  dishes followed, composed of various vegetables. We also had some  pleasant drinks, made, I suppose, from the juices of fruits, but the  delicious alcoholic sting was not in them. We had fruits, too, of  unfamiliar flavors, and a confection of crushed nuts and honey.    We sat at table--or tables--a long time, and the meal was enlivened with  conversation; for all now appeared in a cheerful frame of mind,  notwithstanding the melancholy event which had occupied them during the  day. It was, in fact, a kind of supper, and the one great meal of the  day: the only other meals being a breakfast, and at noon a crust of  brown bread, a handful of dried fruit, and drink of milk.    At the conclusion of the repast, during which I had been too much  occupied to take notice of everything that passed, I observed that a  number of small birds had flown in, and were briskly hopping over the  floor and tables, also perching quite fearlessly on the heads or  shoulders of the company, and that they were being fed with the  fragments. I took them to be sparrows and things of that kind, but they  did not look altogether familiar to me. One little fellow, most lively  in his motions, was remarkably like my old friend the robin, only the  bosom was more vivid, running almost into orange, and the wings and tail  were tipped with the same hue, giving it quite a distinguished  appearance. Another small olive-green bird, which I at first took for a  green linnet, was even prettier, the throat and bosom being of a most  delicate buff, crossed with a belt of velvet black. The bird that really  seemed most like a common sparrow was chestnut, with a white throat and  mouse-colored wings and tail. These pretty little pensioners  systematically avoided my neighborhood, although I tempted them with  crumbs and fruit; only one flew onto my table, but had no sooner done so  than it darted away again, and out of the room, as if greatly alarmed. I  caught the pretty girl's eye just then, and having finished eating, and  being anxious to join the conversation, for I hate to sit silent when  others are talking. I remarked that it was strange the little birds so  persistently avoided me.    \"Oh no, not at all strange,\" she replied, with surprising readiness,  showing that she too had noticed it. \"They are frightened at your  appearance.\"    \"I must indeed appear strange to them,\" said I, with some bitterness,  and recalling the adventures of the morning. \"It is to me a new and very  painful experience to walk about the world frightening men, cattle, and  birds; yet I suppose it is entirely due to the clothes I am wearing--and  the boots. I wish some kind person would suggest a remedy for this state  of things; for just now my greatest desire is to be dressed in  accordance with the fashion.\"    \"Allow me to interrupt you for one moment, Smith,\" said the old  gentleman, who had been listening attentively to my words. \"We  understood what you said so well on this occasion that it seems a pity  you should suddenly again render yourself unintelligible. Can you  explain to us what you mean by dressing in accordance with the fashion?\"    \"My meaning is, that I simply desire to dress like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7413"],[0,"Egyptian Tales, Translated from the Papyri: Second series, XVIIIth to XIXth (#6)"],[1,"is,  however, a fresh one made by Mr. Griffith word for word, and shaped as  little as possible by myself in editing it. The copy followed is the  publication by Birch in \"Select Papyri,\" part ii. pls. ix. to xix.  Before considering the details of the story, we should notice an  important question about its age and composition. That it is as old as  the XIXth Dynasty in its present form is certain from the papyrus; but  probably parts of it are older. The idyllic beauty of the opening of it,  with the simplicity and directness of the ideas, and the absence of any  impossible or marvellous feature, is in the strongest opposition to the  latter part, where marvel is piled on marvel in pointless profusion. In  the first few pages there is not a word superfluous or an idea out of  place in drawing the picture. That we have to do with an older story  lengthened out by some inartistic compiler, seems only too probable. And  this is borne out by the colophon. In the tales of the Shipwrecked  Sailor, and of Sanehat, the colophon runs--\"This is finished from  beginning to end, even as it was found in the writing,\" and the earlier  of these two tales follows this with a blessing on the transcriber. But,  apparently conscious of his meddling, the author of Anpu and Bata ends  with a curse: \"Written by the scribe Anena, the owner of this roll. He  who speaks against this roll, may Tahuti smite him.\" This points to a  part of it at least being newly composed in Ramesside times; while the  delicate beauty of the opening is not only far better than the latter  part, but is out of harmony with the forced and artificial taste of the  XIXth Dynasty. At the same time, the careful drawing of character is  hardly akin to the simple, matter-of-fact style of Sanehat, and seems  more in keeping with the emotional style of the Doomed Prince. If we  attribute the earlier part to the opening of the XVIIIth Dynasty--the  age of the pastoral scenes of the tombs of El Kab, which are the latest  instances of such sculptures in Egypt--we shall probably be nearest to  the truth.    The description of Bata is one of the most beautiful character-drawings  in the past. The self-denial and sweet innocence of the lad, his  sympathy with his cattle, \"listening to all that they said,\" and  allowing them their natural wishes and ways, is touchingly expressed.  And those who know Egypt will know that Bata still lives there--several  Batas I have known myself. His sweetness of manner, his devotion, his  untiringly earnest work, his modesty, his quietness, makes Bata to be  one of the most charming friends. Bata I have met in many places, Bata I  have loved as one of the flowers of human nature, and Bata I hope often  to meet again in divers forms and varied incarnations among the _fellah_  lads of Egypt.    The touches of description of Bata are slight, and yet so pointed. His  growing to be an excellent worker; his return at evening laden with all  the produce, just as may be seen now any evening as the lads come in  bearing on their backs large bundles of vegetables for the house, and of  fodder for the home-driven cattle; his sleeping with his cattle in the  stable; his zeal in rising before dawn to make the daily bread for his  brother, ready to give him when he arose; and then his driving out the  cattle to pasture--all contrasts with his elder brother's life of ease.  The making of the bread was rightly the duty of Anpu's wife; she ought  to have risen to grind the corn long before dawn, as the millstones may  now be heard grinding in the dark, morning by morning; she ought to have  baked the bread ready for the toiler who spent his whole day in the  field. But it was the ever-willing Bata who did the work of the house as  well as the work of the farm. \"Behold the spirit of a god was in him.\"    The driving in of the cattle at night is still a particular feature of  Egyptian life. About an hour before sunset the tether ropes are drawn in  the fields, and the cattle file off, with a little child for a  leader--if any; the master gathers up the produce that is required, some  buffalo is laden with a heap of clover, or a lad carries it on his back,  for the evening feed of the cattle, and all troop along the path through  the fields and by the canal. For two or three miles the road becomes  more and more crowded with the flocks driven into it from every field, a  long haze of dust lies glowing in the crimson glory of sunset over the  stream of cows and buffaloes, sheep and goats, that pour into the  village. Each beast well knows his master and his crib, and turns in at  the familiar gate to the stable under the house, or by the side of the  hut; and there all spend the night. Not a hoof is left out in the field;  the last belated stragglers come in while the gleam of amber still edges  the night-blue sky behind the black horizon. Then the silent fields lie  under the brightening moon, glittering with dew, untrodden and deserted.  It is not cold or climate that leads men to this custom, but the  unsafety of a country bordered by unseen deserts, whence untold men may  suddenly appear and ravage all the plain.    The ploughing scene next follows, on \"the land coming out from the  water\"; as the inundation goes down the well-known banks and ridges  appear, \"the back-bones of the land,\" as they were so naturally called;  and when the surface is firm enough to walk on--with many a pool and  ditch still full--the ploughing begins on the soft dark clay.    The catastrophe of the story--the black gulf of deceit that suddenly  opens under Bata's feet--has always been seen to be strikingly like the  story of Joseph. And--as we have noticed--there is good reason for the  early part of this tale belonging to about the beginning of the XVIIIth  Dynasty, so it is very closely allied in time as well as character to  the account of Joseph. In this part again is one of those pointed  touches, which show the power of the poet--for a poem in prose this  is--\"her heart knew him with the knowledge of youth.\"    On reaching the mistaken revenge of Anpu, we see the sympathy of Bata  with his cattle, and his way of reading their feelings, returned to him  most fittingly by the cows perceiving the presence of the treachery. \"He  heard what his first cow had said; and the next entering she also said  likewise.\"    After this we find a change; instead of the simple and natural  narrative, full of human feeling, and without a touch of impossibility,  every subsequent episode involves the supernatural; Ra creating a wide  water, the extraction of the soul of Bata, his miraculous wife, and all  the transformations--these have nothing in common with the style or  ideas of the earlier tale.    Whence this later tangle came, and how much of it is drawn from other  sources, we can hardly hope to explain from the fragments of literature  that we have. But strangely there is a parallel which is close enough to  suggest that the patchwork is due to popular mythology. In the myths of  Phrygia we meet with Atys or Attis, of whom varying legends are told.  Among these we glean that he was a shepherd, beautiful and chaste; that  he fled from corruption; that he mutilated himself; lastly he died under  a tree, and afterwards was revived. All this is a duplicate of the story  of Bata. And looking further, we see parallels to the three subsequent  transformations. Drops of blood were shed from the Atys-priest; and  Bata, in his first transformation as a bull, sprinkles two drops of  blood by the doors of the palace. Again, Atys is identified with a tree,  which was cut down and taken into a sanctuary; and Bata in his second  transformation is a Persea tree which is cut down and used in building.  Lastly, the mother of Atys is said to have been a virgin, who bore him  from placing in her bosom a ripe almond or pomegranate; and in his third  transformation Bata is born from a chip of a tree being swallowed by the  princess. These resemblances in nearly all the main points are too close  and continuous to be a mere chance, especially as such incidents are not  found in any other Egyptian tale, nor in few--if any--other classical  myths. It is not impossible that the names even may have been the same;  for Bata, as we write it, was pronounced Vata (or Vatiu or Vitiou, as  others would vocalise it), and the digamma would disappear in the later  Greek form in which we have Atys.    The most likely course seems to have been that, starting with a simple  Egyptian tale, the resemblance to the shepherd of the Asiatic myth, led  to a Ramesside author improving the story by tacking on the branches of  the myth one after another, and borrowing the name. If this be granted,  we have here in Bata the earliest indications of the elements of the  Atys mysteries, a thousand years before the Greek versions.    Returning now from the general structure to the separate incidents, we  note the expression of annoyance where the elder brother \"smote twice on  his hands.\" This gesture is very common in Egypt now, the two hands  being rapidly slid one past the other, palm to palm, vertically, grating  the fingers of one hand over the other; the right hand moving downwards,  and the left a little up. This implies that there is nothing, that a  thing is worthless, that a desired result has not been attained, or  annoyance at want of success; but the latter meanings are now rare, and  more latent than otherwise, and this tale points to the gesture being  originally one of positive anger, though it has been transferred  gradually to express mere negative results.    The valley of the acacia would appear from the indications to have been  by the sea, and probably in Syria; perhaps one of the half-desert wadis  toward Gaza was in the writer's mind. The idea of Bata taking out his  heart, and placing it on the flower of a tree, has seemed hopelessly  unintelligible. But it depends on what we are to understand by the"]]]
