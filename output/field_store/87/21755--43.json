The higher wild animals express their thoughts and feelings  usually by sign language, and rarely by vocal sounds. Their power  of expression varies species by species, or tribe by tribe, quite  as it does among the races and tribes of men. It is our belief  that there are today several living races of men whose  vocabularies are limited to about 300 words.    Very many species of animals appear to be voiceless; but it is  hazardous to attempt to specify the species. Sometimes under  stress of new emergencies, or great pain, animals that have been  considered voiceless suddenly give tongue. That hundreds of  species of mammals and birds use their voices in promoting  movements for their safety, there is no room to doubt. The only  question is of the methods and the extent of voice used. Birds and  men give expression to their pleasure or joy by singing.    In the jungle and the heavily wooded wilderness, one hears really  little of vocal wild-animal language. Through countless  generations the noisiest animals have been the first ones to be  sought out and killed by their enemies, and only the more silent  species have survived. All the higher animals, as we call the  higher vertebrates, have the ability to exchange thoughts and  convey ideas; and that is language.    At the threshold of this subject we are met by two interesting  facts. Excepting the song-birds, the wild creatures of today have  learned through instinct and accumulated experience that silence  promotes peace and long life. The bull moose who bawls through a  mile of forest, and the bull elk who bugles not wisely but too  well, soon find their heads hanging in some sportsman's dining-  room, while the silent Virginia deer, like the brook, goes on  forever.    Association with man through countless generations has taught  domestic animals not only the fact of their safety when giving  voice, but also that very often there is great virtue in a  vigorous outcry. With an insistent staccato neigh, the hungry  horse jars the dull brain of its laggard master, and prompts him  to \"feed and water the stock.\" But how different is the cry of a  lost horse, which calls for rescue. It cannot be imitated in  printed words; but every plainsman knows the shrill and prolonged  trumpet-call of distress that can be heard a mile or more,  understandingly.    And think of the vocabulary of the domestic chicken! Years of life  in fancied security have developed a highly useful vocabulary of  language calls and cries. The most important, and the best known,  are the following:    \"Beware the hawk!\"--\"Coor! Coor!\" \"Murder! Help!\"--\"Kee-  _owk_! Kee-_owk_! Kee-_owk_!\" \"Come on\"--\"Cluck!  Cluck! Cluck!\" \"Food here! Food!\"--\"Cook-cook-cook-cook!\"  Announcement, or alarm--\"Cut-cut-cut-_dah_-cut!\" But does  the wild jungle-fowl, the ancestor of our domestic chicken,  indulge in all those noisy expressions of thought and feeling? By  no means. I have lived for months in jungles where my hut was  surrounded by jungle-fowl, and shot many of them for my table; but  the only vocal sound I ever heard from their small throats was the  absurdly shrill bantam-like crow of the cock. And even that led to  several fatalities in the ranks of _Gallus stanleyi_.    Domestic cattle, swine and fowls have each a language of their  own, and as far as they go they are almost as clear-cut and  understandable as the talk of human beings. Just how much more is  behind the veil that limits our understanding we cannot say; but  no doubt there is a great deal.    But it is with the language of wild animals that we are most  concerned. As already pointed out, wild creatures, other than  song-birds, do not care to say much, because of the danger of  attracting enemies that will exterminate them. Herein lies the  extreme difficulty of ascertaining how wild beasts communicate.  In the Animallai Hills of southern India I hunted constantly for  many weeks through forests actually teeming with big game. There  were herds upon herds of elephants, gaur, axis deer, sambar deer,  monkeys by the hundred, and a good sprinkling of bears, wild hogs  and tigers.    We saw hundreds upon hundreds of animals; but with the exception  of the big black monkeys that used to swear at us, I can almost  count upon my fingers the whole number of times that we heard  animals raise their voices to communicate with each other.    Ape Voices. Naturally it is of interest to know something of the  voices of the animals that physically and mentally stand nearest  to man.    The wild gorilla has a voice almost equal to that of the  chimpanzee, but in captivity he rarely utters any vocal sound  other than a shriek, or scream.    The baby orang-utan either whines or shrieks like a human child.  The half-grown or adult orang when profoundly excited bellows or  roars, in a deep bass voice. Usually, however, it is a  persistently silent animal.    The chimpanzee has a voice, and vociferously expresses its  emotions.    First and most often is the plaintive, coaxing note, \"Who'-oo!  who'-oo! who'-oo!\"    Then comes the angry and threatening, \"Wah', wah', wah-!  _Wah'_-hool _Wah'_-hool\"    Lastly we hear the fearful, high-pitched yell or shriek, \"Ah-h-h-  h!\" or \"E-e-e-e.\"    The shriek, or scream, can be heard half a mile, and at close  range it is literally ear-splitting. Usually it is accompanied by  violent stamping or pounding with the feet upon the floor. It may  signify rage, or nothing more than the joy of living, and of  having a place in which to yell. It is this cry that is uncannily  human-like in sound, and when heard for the first time it seems to  register anguish.    In its Bornean jungle home, the orang-utan is nearly as silent as  the grave. Never save once did I hear one utter a vocal sound.  That was a deep bass roar emitted by an old male that I disturbed  while he was sleeping on the comfortable nest of green branches  that he had built for himself.    Concerning the chimpanzee, the late Mr. Richard L. Garner  testified as follows:    \"Not only does the chimpanzee often break the silence of the  forest when all other voices are hushed, but he frequently answers  the sounds of other animals, as if in mockery or defiance. ...  Although diurnal in habit, the chimpanzees often make the night  reverberate with the sounds of their terrific screaming, which I  have known them to continue at times for more than an hour, with  scarcely a moment's pause,--not one voice but many, and within  the area of a square mile or so I have distinguished as many as  seven alternating adult male voices.    \"The gorilla is more silent and stoical than the chimpanzee, but  he is far from being mute. He appears to be devoid of all  risibility, but he is often very noisy. Although diurnal in habit,  he talks less frequently during the day than at night, but his  silence is a natural consequence of his stealth and cunning. There  are times, however, when he ignores all danger of betraying his  whereabouts or his movements, and gives vent to a deluge of  speech. At night his screams and shouts are terrific.\"    The gibbons (including the siamang) have tremendous voices, with  numerous variations, and they love to use them. My acquaintance  with them began in Borneo, in the dense and dark coastal forest  that there forms their home. I remember their cries as vividly as  if I had heard them again this morning. While feeding, or quietly  enjoying the morning sun, the gray gibbon (_Hylobates  concolor_) emits in leisurely succession a low staccato,  whistle-like cry, like \"Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!\" which one can easily  counterfeit by whistling. This is varied by another whistle cry of  three notes, thus: \"Who-ee-hoo! Who-ee-hoo!\" also to be duplicated  by whistling. In hunting for specimens of that gibbon, for  American museums, I could rarely locate a troop save by the tree-  top talk of its members.    But all this was only childish prattle in comparison with the  daily performances of the big white-handed, and the black hoolock  gibbons, now and for several years past residing in our Primate  House. Every morning, and perhaps a dozen times during the day,  those three gibbons go on a vocal rampage and utter prolonged and  ear-splitting cries and shrieks that make the welkin ring. The  shrieking chorus is usually prolonged until it becomes tiresome to  the monkeys. In all our ape and monkey experience we never have  known its equal save in the vocal performances of Boma, our big  adult male chimpanzee, the husband of Suzette.    A baboon emits occasionally, and without any warning, a fearful  explosive bark, or roar, that to visitors is as startling as the  report of a gun. The commonest expressions are \"Wah!\" and  \"_Wah'_-hoo!\", and the visitor who can hear it close at hand  without jumping has good nerves.    The big and solemn long-nosed monkey of Borneo (_Nasalis  larvatus_) utters in his native tree-top (overhanging water), a  cry like the resonant \"honk\" of a saxophone. He says plainly, \"Kee  honk,\" and all that I could make of its meaning was that it is  used as the equivalent of \"All's well.\"    Of all the monkeys that I have ever known, either wild or in  captivity, the red howlers of the Orinoco, in Venezuela, have the  most remarkable voices, and make the most remarkable use of them.  The hyoid cartilage is expanded,--for Nature's own particular  reasons,--into a wonderful sound-box, as big as an English walnut,  which gives to the adult voice a depth of pitch and a booming  resonance that is impossible to describe. The note produced is a  prolonged bass roar, in alternately rising and falling cadence,  and in reality comprising about three notes. It is the habit of  troops of red howlers to indulge in nocturnal concerts, wherein  four, five or six old males will pipe up and begin to howl in  unison. The great volume of uncanny sound thus produced"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60708"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 4 (#6)"],[1,"a redress of  grievances for his people from the very cautious politicians then  in control of the government, all of whom were anxious, apparently,  to palliate the actions of Missouri with reference to the Saints,  for the sake of retaining her political influence on their side; and  also because of a prevailing inclination to a strict construction of  the powers of the general government in its relations to the states.  The Prophet therefore left Washington to preach the Gospel for a  short time in New Jersey and Philadelphia, after which he returned  to Nauvoo, leaving Judge Elias Higbee to urge consideration of the  petition of the Saints which had been referred to the Senate committee  on Judiciary, with what result is made known in detail in the body of  this volume of the history. It is sufficient here to say that the net  result of the Committee's deliberations was simply to recommend that  the Saints appeal for a redress of their wrongs to the United States  District Court having jurisdiction in Missouri, or they could, if they  saw proper, \"apply to the justice and magnanimity of the State of  Missouri--an appeal which the committee feel justified in believing  will never be made in vain by the injured or oppressed.\"--(Sic!)    This suggestion to take their case to the United States Courts was  never acted upon by the Saints, nor does it appear in what manner it  would have been practicable for them to do so. True it is expressly  provided in the Constitution that \"The Judicial power of the United  States shall extend to all cases in law and equity, arising under this  Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or  which shall be made, under their authority; to controversies between  two or more states; between a state and citizens of another state;  between citizens of different states; between citizens of the same  state,\" etc. [13] The case of the Saints would fall either under the  clauses in the above quotation respecting controversies arising between  a state (Missouri) and citizens of another state (the Saints, now  citizens, of Illinois); or \"between citizens of different states,\" the  Saints, citizens of Illinois, and their former persecutors, citizens of  Missouri. In considering the question under the first clause it must be  remembered that the eleventh amendment to the Constitution (declared in  force 1798) provides that {XXVIII} \"The Judicial power of the United  States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,  commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of  another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.\" It is  held that \"the power as well as the dignity of a state would be gone if  it could be dragged into court by a private plaintiff.\" [14]    The Supreme Court in the case Chisholm _vs_. the State of Georgia, had  decided (1793) that an action did lie against the State of Georgia at  a suit of a private plaintiff. The state however refused to appear,  whereupon the Supreme Court proceeded, a year later, to give judgment  against her by default in case she should not appear and plead before  a day; whereupon there arose such a storm of protest, not only in  Georgia, but in the other states as well, that the eleventh amendment  was adopted exempting a state from being sued in the courts of the  United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens subjects  of any foreign state. Moreover, states are not suable in any event  except with their consent; [15] and if a state waive its immunity, it  may attach any conditions it pleases to its consent. [16] Under these  circumstances it is not surprising that the Saints never attempted to  bring Missouri before the United States courts. They could only have  planted suit against the state by its consent, and if she consented,  then under such conditions as she might be pleased to attach to that  consent. Moreover, the Saints had the best of reasons for believing  that Missouri would never consent.    As to suing their persecutors as individuals before the United States  courts, as citizens of one state suing citizens of another, it is  only necessary to remind the reader of the insuperable difficulties  attending upon that procedure to convince him of the futility of such  action. The expensiveness of the undertaking, and the extreme poverty  of the exiles alone would be sufficient to bar such an undertaking;  for every one knows how bitterly hard it is for the poor to set the  judicial machinery of organized society in motion in their favor. Then  there was the evident conspiracy entered into by the mobs of Missouri  to defeat the ends of justice in respect of the Saints: mobs which an  unfriendly governor had converted into a state militia; to which that  same governor gave an order to expel from the state or exterminate the  entire people; under which order said mob-militia did expel from the  state some twelve thousand citizens, depriving them of their property  and liberty without due process of law; and afterwards the state  through its legislature sanctioned and applauded the actions of this  mob-militia for the part it had taken in causing said expulsion--though  attended by acts of {XXIX} unspeakable atrocity--by appropriating  200,000 dollars to meet the expenses of the mob-militia in carrying  out the governor's illegal orders. After these crimes against the  Constitution and laws of the state, against American institutions and  the civilization of the age--after all this, I say, it is not difficult  to understand how farcical would be any procedure before either the  state or the federal courts in Missouri. By acts of perjury, in order  to still further defeat the ends of justice and protect each other  from the penalties due to their crimes, it would have been easy for  the people of Missouri to defeat the ends of justice. And after having  committed the crimes of murder and robbery; after having unlawfully  expelled a whole people, numbering thousands, from their homes--of  which the despoilers were then possessed--it is not to be believed that  such characters would hesitate to suborn witnesses, commit perjury, or  hesitate to do any other thing, however criminal, in order to escape  the just punishment for their crimes.    The offense of the State of Missouri against the Saints was a denial  of political as well as of civil rights. She had in her treatment of  the Saints abdicated republican government. Her officers, including the  chief executive of the state had violated the Constitution of the state  in that they had entered into a wide-spread conspiracy to deprive the  Saints of their liberty and property without due process of law; and in  fact had deprived them of those rights by expelling them by force of  arms from the state.    These were the wrongs the Saints had endured; this the nature of the  crime of the state of Missouri against them, and it seems that for  these things which they suffered there could be found no remedy;  for, as already explained, a state could not be made party to a suit  before the courts, either state or federal, without her consent; and  it is a well settled principle of American law that \"a suit nominally  against an officer but really against a state to enforce performance  of its obligation in its political capacity, will not lie.\" A state,  therefore, could not be directly arraigned before the courts or any  kind of tribunal for failure to enforce its political obligations; nor  could it be indirectly so arraigned through its officers since such  an arraignment would undoubtedly have been held to be but \"nominally  against the officers and really against the state;\" hence void. [17]  The only arraignment of the state that could be made was evidently  at the bar of public opinion and sentiment, and this sentiment,  unfortunately viciated by misrepresentations, was against the Saints.  All things considered, then, there was little wisdom behind the  recommendation of the Senate Judiciary Committee for the Saints to  prosecute their case before the Federal courts having jurisdiction  in Missouri; and {XXX} the suggestion that they apply to the justice  and magnanimity of the state of the Missouri, borders upon mockery.  However, Missouri did not escape the chastisement due to her many  acts of predatory injustice upon the Saints; there was measured out  to her more than four fold of that sorrow and affliction which she  had perpetrated upon the Saints. She sowed to the wind in her conduct  towards the Mormon people, she reaped the whirl-wind in the terrible  experiences of more then ten years of border warfare, banditti rule,  and her enormous sacrifice of blood and treasure in the Civil War; all  of which is abundantly set forth in the Introduction to Volume III of  this work.    _The Mission of the Twelve to England_.    The mission of the Twelve to England marks an epoch in the missionary  experience of the Church. They undertook this mission in fulfillment  of a commandment received of the Lord on the 8th of July, 1838, at Far  West, Missouri, which revelation was given in answer to the question  of the Prophet: \"Show us thy will, O Lord, concerning the Twelve.\" In  answer to that question the Lord directed that the several vacancies  then existing in the quorum should be filled by the appointment of John  Taylor, John E. Page, Wilford Woodruff, and Willard Richards. \"And next  spring,\" said the revelation, \"let them [the Twelve] depart to go over  the great waters and there promulgate my gospel, the fullness thereof,  and bear record of my name. Let them take leave of my Saints in the  City Far West on the 26th day of April next, on the building spot of my  house saith the Lord.\" [18]    Notwithstanding the fact that the Church had been expelled from the  state of Missouri before the 26th day of April, 1839, a number of the  Twelve accompanied by several of those who had been"]]]
