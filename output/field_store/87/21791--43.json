We  licked them all right.\"    \"But it's such a beastly thing for the house.\"    \"Then why the dickens do you want it to get about? Surely the best  thing you can do is to dry up and say nothing about it.\"    \"But something ought to be done.\"    \"What's the good of troubling about a man like Sheen? He never was any  good, and this doesn't make him very much worse. Besides, he'll  probably be sick enough on his own account. I know I should, if I'd  done it. And, anyway, we don't know that he did do it.\"    \"I'm certain he did. I could swear it was him.\"    \"Anyhow, for goodness' sake let the thing drop.\"    \"All right. But I shall cut him.\"    \"Well, that would be punishment enough for anybody, whatever he'd done.  Fancy existence without your bright conversation. It doesn't bear  thinking of. You do look a freak with that eye and that lump on your  forehead. You ought to wear a mask.\"    \"That ear of yours,\" said Linton with satisfaction, \"will be about  three times its ordinary size tomorrow. And it always was too large.  Good night.\"    On his way back to Seymour's Mason of Appleby's, who was standing at  his house gate imbibing fresh air, preparatory to going to bed,  accosted him.    \"I say, Linton,\" he said, \"--hullo, you look a wreck, don't you!--I  say, what's all this about your house?\"    \"What about my house?\"    \"Funking, and all that. Sheen, you know. Stanning has just been telling  me.\"    \"Then he saw him, too!\" exclaimed Linton, involuntarily.    \"Oh, it's true, then? Did he really cut off like that? Stanning said he  did, but I wouldn't believe him at first. You aren't going? Good  night.\"    So the thing was out. Linton had not counted on Stanning having seen  what he and Dunstable had seen. It was impossible to hush it up now.  The scutcheon of Seymour's was definitely blotted. The name of the  house was being held up to scorn in Appleby's probably everywhere else  as well. It was a nuisance, thought Linton, but it could not be helped.  After all, it was a judgment on the house for harbouring such a  specimen as Sheen.    In Seymour's there was tumult and an impromptu indignation meeting.  Stanning had gone to work scientifically. From the moment that, ducking  under the guard of a sturdy town youth, he had caught sight of Sheen  retreating from the fray, he had grasped the fact that here,  ready-made, was his chance of working off his grudge against him. All  he had to do was to spread the news abroad, and the school would do the  rest. On his return from the town he had mentioned the facts of the  case to one or two of the more garrulous members of his house, and they  had passed it on to everybody they met during the interval in the  middle of preparation. By the end of preparation half the school knew  what had happened.    Seymour's was furious. The senior day-room to a man condemned Sheen.  The junior day-room was crimson in the face and incoherent. The  demeanour of a junior in moments of excitement generally lacks that  repose which marks the philosopher.    \"He ought to be kicked,\" shrilled Renford.    \"We shall get rotted by those kids in Dexter's,\" moaned Harvey.    \"Disgracing the house!\" thundered Watson.    \"Let's go and chuck things at his door,\" suggested Renford.    A move was made to the passage in which Sheen's study was situated,  and, with divers groans and howls, the junior day-room hove football  boots and cricket stumps at the door.    The success of the meeting, however, was entirely neutralised by the  fact that in the same passage stood the study of Rigby, the head of the  house. Also Rigby was trying at the moment to turn into idiomatic Greek  verse the words: \"The Days of Peace and Slumberous calm have fled\", and  this corroboration of the statement annoyed him to the extent of  causing him to dash out and sow lines among the revellers like some  monarch scattering largesse. The junior day-room retired to its lair to  inveigh against the brutal ways of those in authority, and begin  working off the commission it had received.    The howls in the passage were the first official intimation Sheen had  received that his shortcomings were public property. The word \"Funk!\"  shouted through his keyhole, had not unnaturally given him an inkling  as to the state of affairs.    So Drummond had given him away, he thought. Probably he had told Linton  the whole story the moment after he, Sheen, had met the latter at the  door of the study. And perhaps he was now telling it to the rest of the  house. Of all the mixed sensations from which he suffered as he went to  his dormitory that night, one of resentment against Drummond was the  keenest.    Sheen was in the fourth dormitory, where the majority of the day-room  slept. He was in the position of a sort of extra house prefect, as far  as the dormitory was concerned. It was a large dormitory, and Mr  Seymour had fancied that it might, perhaps, be something of a handful  for a single prefect. As a matter of fact, however, Drummond, who was  in charge, had shown early in the term that he was more than capable of  managing the place single handed. He was popular and determined. The  dormitory was orderly, partly because it liked him, principally because  it had to be.    He had an opportunity of exhibiting his powers of control that night.  When Sheen came in, the room was full. Drummond was in bed, reading his  novel. The other ornaments of the dormitory were in various stages of  undress.    As Sheen appeared, a sudden hissing broke out from the farther corner  of the room. Sheen flushed, and walked to his bed. The hissing  increased in volume and richness.    \"Shut up that noise,\" said Drummond, without looking up from his book.    The hissing diminished. Only two or three of the more reckless kept it  up.    Drummond looked across the room at them.    \"Stop that noise, and get into bed,\" he said quietly.    The hissing ceased. He went on with his book again.    Silence reigned in dormitory four.          VI    ALBERT REDIVIVUS      By murdering in cold blood a large and respected family, and afterwards  depositing their bodies in a reservoir, one may gain, we are told, much  unpopularity in the neighbourhood of one's crime; while robbing a  church will get one cordially disliked especially by the vicar. But, to  be really an outcast, to feel that one has no friend in the world, one  must break an important public-school commandment.    Sheen had always been something of a hermit. In his most sociable  moments he had never had more than one or two friends; but he had never  before known what it meant to be completely isolated. It was like  living in a world of ghosts, or, rather, like being a ghost in a living  world. That disagreeable experience of being looked through, as if one  were invisible, comes to the average person, it may be half a dozen  times in his life. Sheen had to put up with it a hundred times a day.  People who were talking to one another stopped when he appeared and  waited until he had passed on before beginning again. Altogether, he  was made to feel that he had done for himself, that, as far as the life  of the school was concerned, he did not exist.    There had been some talk, particularly in the senior day-room, of more  active measures. It was thought that nothing less than a court-martial  could meet the case. But the house prefects had been against it. Sheen  was in the sixth, and, however monstrous and unspeakable might have  been his acts, it would hardly do to treat him as if he were a junior.  And the scheme had been definitely discouraged by Drummond, who had  stated, without wrapping the gist of his remarks in elusive phrases,  that in the event of a court-martial being held he would interview the  president of the same and knock his head off. So Seymour's had fallen  back on the punishment which from their earliest beginnings the public  schools have meted out to their criminals. They had cut Sheen dead.    In a way Sheen benefited from this excommunication. Now that he could  not even play fives, for want of an opponent, there was nothing left  for him to do but work. Fortunately, he had an object. The Gotford  would be coming on in a few weeks, and the more work he could do for  it, the better. Though Stanning was the only one of his rivals whom he  feared, and though _he_ was known to be taking very little trouble  over the matter, it was best to run as few risks as possible. Stanning  was one of those people who produce great results in their work without  seeming to do anything for them.    So Sheen shut himself up in his study and ground grimly away at his  books, and for exercise went for cross-country walks. It was a  monotonous kind of existence. For the space of a week the only  Wrykinian who spoke a single word to him was Bruce, the son of the  Conservative candidate for Wrykyn: and Bruce's conversation had been  limited to two remarks. He had said, \"You might play that again, will  you?\" and, later, \"Thanks\". He had come into the music-room while Sheen  was practising one afternoon, and had sat down, without speaking, on a  chair by the door. When Sheen had played for the second time the piece  which had won his approval, Bruce thanked him and left the room. As the  solitary break in the monotony of the week, Sheen remembered the  incident rather vividly.    Since the great rout of Albert and his minions outside Cook's, things,  as far as the seniors were concerned, had been quiet between school and  town. Linton and Dunstable had gone to and from Cook's two days in  succession without let or hindrance. It was generally believed that,  owing to the unerring way in which he had put his head in front of  Drummond's left on that memorable occasion, the scarlet-haired one was  at present dry-docked for repairs. The story in the school--it had  grown with the days--was that Drummond had laid the enemy out on the  pavement with a sickening crash,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6932"],[0,"Pictures Every Child Should Know (#6)"],[1,"dead that it does not seem proper  yet to discuss his personal history, but we can speak understandingly  of his art, for we already know it to be great art, which will stand  the test of time. His imagination turned toward subjects of solemn  grandeur and his work is very impressive and beautiful.    He was born in Basel, \"one of the most prosaic towns in Europe.\" His  father was a Swiss merchant, and not poor; thus the son had ordinarily  good chances to make an artist of himself. He was born at a time when  to be an artist had long ceased to be a reproach, and men no longer  discouraged their sons who felt themselves inspired to paint great  pictures.    When Boecklin was nineteen years old he took himself to Duesseldorf,  with his merchant father's permission, and settled down to learn his  art, but in that city he found mostly \"sentimental and anecdotal\"  pictures being painted, which did not suit him at all. Then he took  himself off to Brussels, where again he was not satisfied, and so went  to Paris. But while in Brussels he had copied many old masters, and  had advanced himself very much, so that he did not present himself in  Paris raw and untried in art.    At first he studied in the Louvre, then went to Rome, seeking ever the  best, and being hard to satisfy. He found rest and tranquillity in  Zuerich, a city in his native country, but it was Italy that had most  influenced his work.    He loved the Campagna of Rome with its ruins and the sad grandeur of  the crumbling tombs lining its way, and therefore a certain  mysterious, grand, and solemn character made his pictures unlike those  of any other artist. He loved to paint in vertical (up-and-down)  fines, rather than with the conventional horizontal outlines that we  find in most paintings. This method gives his pictures a different  quality from any others in the world.    He loved best of all to paint landscape, and it is said of him that  \"as the Greeks peopled their streams and woods and waves with  creatures of their imagination, so Boecklin makes the waterfall take  shape as a nymph, or the mists which rise above the water source  wreathe into forms of merry children; or in some wild spot hurls  centaurs together in fierce combat, or makes the slippery, moving wave  give birth to Nereids and Tritons.\"    Muther, art-critic and biographer, calls our attention to the  similarity between Wagner's music and Boecklin's painting. While Wagner  was \"luring the colours of sound from music,\" Boecklin's \"symphonies of  colour streamed forth like a crashing orchestra,\" and he calls him the  greatest colour-poet of the time.    In appearance Boecklin was fine of form, healthy and wholesome in all  his thoughts and way of living. In 1848 he took part in revolutionary  politics and later this did him great harm. Only the influence of his  friends kept him from ruin. After the Franco-Prussian war he was made  Minister of Fine Arts. In this office he rendered great service; but  because he had to witness the wrecking of the Column Vendome in order  to save the Louvre and the Luxembourg from the mob, he was censured;  indeed so heavy a fine was imposed that it took his whole fortune to  pay it; and he was banished into the bargain. From 1892 to 1901 he  lived in or near Florence, and he died at Fiesole, January 16th, 1901.      PLATE--THE ISLE OF THE DEAD    This picture is perhaps the greatest of the many great Arnold Boecklin  paintings, and it is both fascinating and awe-inspiring.    It best shows his liking for vertical lines in art. The Isle of the  Dead is of a rocky, shaft-like formation in which we may see hewn-out  tombs; and there, tall cypress trees are growing.    The traces of man's work in the midst of this sombre, ideal, and  mystic scene add to the impressiveness of the picture. The isle stands  high and lonely in the midst of a sea.    The water seems silently to lap the base of the rocks and the trees  are in black shadow, massed in the centre. It looks very mysterious  and still. There is a stone gateway touched with the light of a dying  day. It is sunset and the dead is being brought to its resting place  in a tiny boat, all the smaller for its relation to the gloomy  grandeur of the isle which it is approaching. One figure is standing  in the boat, facing the island, and the sunlight falls full upon his  back and touches the boat, making that spot stand out brilliantly from  all the rest of the picture.    Among Boecklin's paintings are \"Naiads at Play,\" which hangs in the  Museum at Basel, \"A Villa by the Sea,\" \"The Sport of the Waves,\"  \"Regions of Joy,\" \"Flora,\" and \"Venus Dispatching Cupid.\"          IV    MARIE-ROSA BONHEUR        (Pronounced Rosa Bon-er)    _French School_    1822-1895    _Pupil of Raymond B. Bonheur_    Rosa Bonheur, Landseer, and Murillo maybe called \"Children's Painters\"  in this book because they painted things that children, as well as  grown-ups, certainly can enjoy. To be sure, Murillo was a very  different sort of artist from Rosa Bonheur or Landseer, but if the two  latter painted the most beautiful, animals--dogs, sheep, and  horses--Murillo painted the loveliest little children.    Rosa was the best pupil of her father; Raymond B. Bonheur. In Bordeaux  they lived together the peaceful life of artists, the father being  already a well known painter when his daughter was born. She became,  as Mr. Hamerton, who knew her, said, \"the most accomplished female  painter who ever lived ... a pure, generous woman as well and can  hardly be too much admired ... as a woman or an artist. She is simple  in her tastes and habits of life and many stories are told of her  generosity to others.\"    After a time the Bonheurs moved to Paris where young Rosa could have  better opportunities; and there she put on man's clothing, which she  wore all her life thereafter. She wore a workingman's blouse and  trousers, and tramped about looking more like a man than a woman with  her short hair. This, made everybody stare at her and think her very  queer, but people no longer believe that she dressed herself thus in  order to advertise herself and attract attention; but because it was  the most convenient costume for her to get about in. She went to all  sorts of places; the stockyards, slaughter houses, all about the  streets of Paris, to learn of things and people, especially of  animals, which she wished most to paint. She could hardly have gone  about thus if she had worn women's clothing.    Rosa Bonheur exhibited her first painting at the _Salon_ in 1841, and  this was twelve years before her beloved father died; thus he had the  happiness of knowing that the daughter whom he had taught so lovingly  was on the road to success and fortune. He knew that when fortune  should come to her she would use it well. The year that she exhibited  her work in the _Salon_ she painted only two little pictures--one of  rabbits, the other of sheep and goats--but they were so splendidly  done that all the critics knew a great woman artist had arrived.    It was then that her enemies, those who were becoming jealous of her  work, said that she was wearing men's clothing in order to attract  attention to herself.    Soon her work began to be bought by the French Government, which was a  sure sign of her power. She was already much beloved by the people. In  the meantime we in America and others in England had heard of  Mademoiselle Bonheur, but we heard far less about her painting than we  did about her masculine garb. We thought of her mostly as an eccentric  woman; but one day came \"The Horse Fair,\" and all the world heard of  that, so the artist was to be no longer judged by the clothes she wore  but by her art. Finally, she received the cross of the Legion of  Honour, and also was made a member of the Institute of Antwerp.    She lived near Fontainebleau; her studio a peaceful retired home, till  the Franco-Prussian war came about. Then she and others began to fear  that her studio and pictures would be destroyed, so the artist was  forced to stop her work and prepared to go elsewhere. But the Crown  Prince of Prussia himself ordered that Mademoiselle Bonheur should not  even be disturbed. Her work had made her belong to all the world and  all the world was to protect her if need be.    Rosa Bonheur had a brother who, some critics said, was the better  artist, but if that were true it is likely that his popularity would  in some degree have approached that of his sister. Rosa Bonheur did  not paint many large canvases, but mostly small ones, or only  moderately large; but when she painted sheep it seems that one might  shear the wool, it stands so fleecy and full; while her horses rampage  and curvet, showing themselves off as if they were alive.      PLATE--THE HORSE FAIR    This picture was exhibited all over the world very nearly. It was  carried to England and to America, and won admiration wherever it was  seen. Finally it was sold in America. It was first exhibited in 1853,  the year in which the artist's father died. Mr. Ernest Gambart was the  first who bought the picture, and he wrote of it to his friend,  Mr. S.P. Avery: \"I will give you the real history of 'The Horse Fair,'  now in New York. It was painted in 1852, by Rosa Bonheur, then in her  thirtieth year, and exhibited in the next _Salon_. Though much admired  it did not find a purchaser. It was soon after exhibited in Ghent,  meeting again with much appreciation, but was not sold, as art did not  flourish at the time. In 1855 the picture was sent by Rosa Bonheur to  her native town of Bordeaux and exhibited there. She offered to sell  it to the town at the very low price 12,000 francs ($2,400). While  there, I asked her if she would sell it to me, and allow me to take it  to England and have it engraved. She said: 'I wish to have my picture  remain in France. I will once more impress on my countrymen, my wish  to sell it to them for 12,000 francs. If they refuse, "]]]
