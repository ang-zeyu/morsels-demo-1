And he gave him tithes of all.    01:014:021 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons,             and take the goods to thyself.    01:014:022 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand             unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and             earth,    01:014:023 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and             that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou             shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:    01:014:024 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion             of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let             them take their portion.    01:015:001 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a             vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy             exceeding great reward.    01:015:002 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go             childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of             Damascus?    01:015:003 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and,             lo, one born in my house is mine heir.    01:015:004 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This             shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of             thine own bowels shall be thine heir.    01:015:005 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward             heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them:             and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.    01:015:006 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for             righteousness.    01:015:007 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of             Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.    01:015:008 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall             inherit it?    01:015:009 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,             and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years             old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.    01:015:010 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,             and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided             he not.    01:015:011 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove             them away.    01:015:012 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;             and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.    01:015:013 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall             be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve             them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;    01:015:014 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and             afterward shall they come out with great substance.    01:015:015 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be             buried in a good old age.    01:015:016 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for             the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.    01:015:017 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was             dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed             between those pieces.    01:015:018 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,             Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt             unto the great river, the river Euphrates:    01:015:019 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,    01:015:020 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,    01:015:021 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and             the Jebusites.    01:016:001 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an             handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.    01:016:002 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath             restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid;             it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram             hearkened to the voice of Sarai.    01:016:003 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after             Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her             to her husband Abram to be his wife.    01:016:004 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw             that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.    01:016:005 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given             my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had             conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between             me and thee.    01:016:006 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand;             do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly             with her, she fled from her face.    01:016:007 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in             the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.    01:016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and             whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my             mistress Sarai.    01:016:009 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy             mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.    01:016:010 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy             seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.    01:016:011 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with             child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael;             because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.    01:016:012 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,             and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the             presence of all his brethren.    01:016:013 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou             God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him             that seeth me?    01:016:014 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi;

they are unclean to you.    03:011:009 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever             hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the             rivers, them shall ye eat.    03:011:010 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the             rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living             thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination             unto you:    03:011:011 They shall be even an abomination unto you;

they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination:             the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,    03:011:014 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;    03:011:015 Every raven after his kind;

   03:011:022 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and             the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind,             and the grasshopper after his kind.    03:011:023 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,             shall be an abomination unto you.    03:011:024 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the             carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.    03:011:025 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash             his clothes, and be unclean until the even.    03:011:026 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is             not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you:             every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.    03:011:027 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts             that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso             toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.    03:011:028 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his             clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto             you.    03:011:029 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things             that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the             tortoise after his kind,    03:011:030 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the             snail, and the mole.    03:011:031 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth             touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the             even.    03:011:032 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth             fall, it shall be unclean;

so it shall be cleansed.    03:011:033 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,             whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.    03:011:034 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water             cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in             every such vessel shall be unclean.    03:011:035 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth             shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they             shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be             unclean unto you.    03:011:036 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of             water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase             shall be unclean.    03:011:037 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed             which is to be sown, it shall be clean.    03:011:038 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their             carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.    03:011:039 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth             the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.    03:011:040 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his             clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth             the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until             the even.    03:011:041 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be             an abomination; it shall not be eaten.    03:011:042 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all             four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things             that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are             an abomination.    03:011:043 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping             thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean             with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.    03:011:044 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify             yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall             ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that             creepeth upon the earth.    03:011:045 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of             Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am             holy.    03:011:046 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every             living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every             creature that creepeth upon the earth:    03:011:047 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and             between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not             be eaten.    03:012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:012:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have             conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be             unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation             for her infirmity shall she be unclean.    03:012:003 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be             circumcised.    03:012:004 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying             three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor             come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be             fulfilled.    03:012:005 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two             weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the             blood of her purifying threescore and six days.    03:012:006 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son,             or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year             for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for             a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the             congregation, unto the priest:    03:012:007 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for             her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood.             This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.    03:012:008 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring             two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt             offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest             shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.    03:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,    03:013:002 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a             scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like             the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the             priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:    03:013:003 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the             flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and             the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it             is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and             pronounce him unclean.    03:013:004 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in             sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not             turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the             plague seven days:    03:013:005 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold,             if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread             not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days             more:    03:013:006 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,             behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread             not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is             but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.    03:013:007 But if the"]]]
