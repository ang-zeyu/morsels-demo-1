Every one  declared the same; and Paddy was ordered to cook some _griskins_  forthwith. Paddy was completely nonplussed:--all the provisions were  gone, and yet his guests were not to be trifled with. He made a  hundred excuses--\"'Twas late--'twas dry now--and there was nothing in  the house; sure they ate and drank enough.\" But all in vain. The ould  sinner was threatened with instant death if he delayed. So Paddy  called a council of war in the parlour, consisting of his wife and  himself.    \"Agrah, Jillen, agrah, what will we do with these? Is there any meat  in the tub? Where is the tongue? If it was yours, Jillen, we'd give  them enough of it; but I mane the cow's.\" (aside.)    \"Sure the proctors got the tongue ere yesterday, and you know there  an't a bit in the tub. Oh the murtherin villains! and I'll engage  'twill be no good for us, after all my white bread and the whisky.  That it may pison 'em!\"    \"Amen! Jillen; but don't curse them. After all, where's the meat? I'm  sure that Andy will kill me if we don't make it out any how;--and he  hasn't a penny to pay for it. You could drive the mail coach, Jillen,  through his breeches pocket without jolting over a ha'penny. Coming,  coming; d'ye hear 'em?\"    \"Oh, they'll murther us. Sure if we had any of the tripe I sent  yesterday to the gauger.\"    \"Eh! What's that you say? I declare to God here's Andy getting up.  We must do something. _Thonom an dhiaoul_, I have it. Jillen run and  bring me the leather breeches; run woman, alive! Where's the block and  the hatchet? Go up and tell 'em you're putting down the pot.\"    Jillen pacified the uproar in the kitchen by loud promises, and  returned to Paddy. The use of the leather breeches passed her  comprehension; but Paddy actually took up the leather breeches, tore  away the lining with great care, chopped the leather with the hatchet  on the block, and put it into the pot as tripes. Considering the  situation in which Andy and his friends were, and the appetite of the  Irish peasantry for meat in any shape--\"a bone\" being their _summum  bonum_--the risk was very little. If discovered, however, Paddy's  safety was much worse than doubtful, as no people in the world have a  greater horror of any unusual food. One of the most deadly modes of  revenge they can employ is to give an enemy dog's or cat's flesh; and  there have been instances where the persons who have eaten it, on  being informed of the fact, have gone mad. But Paddy's habit of  practical jokes, from which nothing could wean him, and his anger at  their conduct, along with the fear he was in did not allow him to  hesitate a moment. Jillen remonstrated in vain. \"Hould your tongue,  you foolish woman. They're all as blind as the pig there. They'll  never find it out. Bad luck to 'em too, my leather breeches! that I  gave a pound note and a hog for in Cork. See how nothing else would  satisfy 'em!\" The meat at length was ready. Paddy drowned it in  butter, threw out the potatoes on the table, and served it up smoking  hot with the greatest gravity.    \"By ----,\" says Jack Shea, \"that's fine stuff! How a man would dig a  trench after that.\"    \"I'll take a priest's oath,\" answered Tim Cohill, the most irritable  of men, but whose temper was something softened by the rich steam;--    \"Yet, Tim, what's a priest's oath? I never heard that.\"    \"Why, sure, every one knows you didn't ever hear of anything of good.\"    \"I say you lie, Tim, you rascal.\"    Tim was on his legs in a few moments, and a general battle was about  to begin; but the appetite was too strong, and the quarrel was  settled; Tim having been appeased by being allowed to explain a  priest's oath. According to him, a priest's oath was this:--He was  surrounded by books, which were gradually piled up until they reached  his lips. He then kissed the uppermost, and swore by all to the  bottom. As soon as the admiration excited by his explanation, in those  who were capable of hearing Tim, had ceased, all fell to work; and  certainly, if the tripes had been of ordinary texture, drunk as was  the party, they would soon have disappeared. After gnawing at them for  some time, \"Well,\" says Owen Connor, \"that I mightn't!--but these are  the quarest tripes I ever eat. It must be she was very ould.\"    \"By ----,\" says Andy, taking a piece from his mouth to which he had  been paying his addresses for the last half hour, \"I'd as soon be  eating leather. She was a bull, man; I can't find the soft end at all  of it.\"    \"And that's true for you, Andy,\" said the man of the gun; \"and 'tis  the greatest shame they hadn't a bull-bait to make him tinder. Paddy,  was it from Jack Clifford's bull you got 'em? They'd do for wadding,  they're so tough.\"    \"I'll tell you, Tim, where I got them--'twas out of Lord Shannon's  great cow at Cork, the great fat cow that the Lord Mayor bought for  the Lord Lieutenant--_Asda churp naur hagushch_.\"[14]        [14] May it never come out of his body!    \"Amen, I pray God! Paddy. Out of Lord Shandon's cow? near the steeple,  I suppose; the great cow that couldn't walk with tallow. By ----,  these are fine tripes. They'll make a man very strong. Andy, give me  two or three _libbhers_ more of 'em.\"    \"Well, see that! out of Lord Shandon's cow: I wonder what they gave  her, Paddy. That I mightn't!--but these would eat a pit of potatoes.  Any how, they're good for the teeth. Paddy, what's the reason they  send all the good mate from Cork to the Blacks?\"    But before Paddy could answer this question, Andy, who had been  endeavouring to help Tim, uttered a loud \"_Thonom an dhiaoul!_ what's  this? Isn't this flannel?\" The fact was, he had found a piece of  the lining, which Paddy, in his hurry, had not removed; and all was  confusion. Every eye was turned to Paddy; but with wonderful quickness  he said \"'Tis the book tripe, _agragal_, don't you see?\"--and actually  persuaded them to it.    \"Well, any how,\" says Tim, \"it had the taste of wool.\"    \"May this choke me,\" says Jack Shea, \"if I didn't think that 'twas a  piece of a leather breeches when I saw Andy _chawing_ it.\"    This was a shot between wind and water to Paddy. His self-possession  was nearly altogether lost, and he could do no more than turn it off  by a faint laugh. But it jarred most unpleasantly on Andy's nerves.  After looking at Paddy for some time with a very ominous look, he  said, \"_Yirroo Pandhrig_ of the tricks, if I thought you were going on  with any work here, my soul and my guts to the devil if I would not  cut you into garters. By the vestment I'd make a _furhurmeen_ of you.\"    \"Is it I, Andy? That the hands may fall off me!\"    But Tim Cohill made a most seasonable diversion. \"Andy, when you die,  you'll be the death of one fool, any how. What do you know that wasn't  ever in Cork itself about tripes. I never ate such mate in my life;  and 'twould be good for every poor man in the County of Kerry if he  had a tub of it.\"    Tim's tone of authority, and the character he had got for learning,  silenced every doubt, and all laid siege to the tripes again. But  after some time, Andy was observed gazing with the most astonished  curiosity into the plate before him. His eyes were rivetted on  something; at last he touched it with his knife, arid exclaimed,  \"_Kirhappa, dar dhia!_\"--[A button by G--.]    \"What's that you say?\" burst from all! and every one rose in the best  manner he could, to learn the meaning of the button.    \"Oh, the villain of the world!\" roared Andy, \"I'm pisoned! Where's the  pike? For God's sake Jack, run for the priest, or I'm a dead man with  the breeches. Where is he?--yeer bloods won't ye catch him, and I  pisoned?\"    The fact was, Andy had met one of the knee-buttons sewed into a piece  of the tripe, and it was impossible for him to fail discovering the  cheat. The rage, however, was not confined to Andy. As soon as it was  understood what had been done, there was an universal rush for Paddy  and Jillen; but Paddy was much too cunning to be caught, after the  narrow escape he had of it before. The moment after the discovery of  the lining, that he could do so without suspicion, he stole from the  table, left the house, and hid himself. Jillen did the same; and  nothing remained for the eaters, to vent their rage, but breaking  every thing in the cabin; which was done in the utmost fury. Andy,  however, continued watching for Paddy with a gun, a whole month after.  He might be seen prowling along the ditches near the shebeen-house,  waiting for a shot at him. Not that he would have scrupled to enter  it, were he likely to find Paddy there; but the latter was completely  on the _shuchraun_, and never visited his cabin except by stealth. It  was in one of those visits that Andy hoped to catch him.    --_Tait's Edinburgh Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *      CONVERSATIONS WITH LORD BYRON.    _By the Countess of Blessington_.

They were all familiar to  him, and he failed not to point them out, but in very sober terms,  never allowing any thing like enthusiasm in his expressions, though  many of the views might have excited it.    His appearance on horseback was not advantageous, and he seemed  aware of it, for he made many excuses for his dress and equestrian  appointments. His horse was literally covered with various trappings,  in the way of cavesons, martingales, and Heaven knows how many other  (to me) unknown inventions. The saddle was _a la Hussarde_ with  holsters, in which he always carried pistols. His dress consisted of  a nankeen jacket and trousers, which appeared to have shrunk from  washing; the jacket embroidered in the same colour, and with three  rows of buttons; the waist very short, the back very narrow, and the  sleeves set in as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1159"],[0,"Fire-Tongue (#7)"],[1," upon Nicol Brinn, he was not disappointed. It was a word  which must have conveyed little or nothing to the multitude and which  might have been pronounced without perceptible effect at any public  meeting in the land. But Mr. Brinn, impassive though his expression  remained, could not conceal the emotion which he experienced at the  sound of it. His gaunt face seemed to grow more angular and his eyes to  become even less lustrous.    \"Fire-Tongue!\" he said, tensely, following a short silence. \"For God's  sake, when did you hear that word?\"    \"I heard it,\" replied Harley, slowly, \"to-night.\" He fixed his gaze  intently upon the sallow face of the American. \"It was spoken by Sir  Charles Abingdon.\"    Closely as he watched Nicol Brinn while pronouncing this name he could  not detect the slightest change of expression in the stoic features.    \"Sir Charles Abingdon,\" echoed Brinn; \"and in what way is it connected  with your case?\"    \"In this way,\" answered Harley. \"It was spoken by Sir Charles a few  moments before he died.\"    Nicol Brinn's drooping lids flickered rapidly. \"Before he died! Then Sir  Charles Abingdon is dead! When did he die?\"    \"He died to-night and the last words that he uttered were  'Fire-Tongue'--\" He paused, never for a moment removing that fixed gaze  from the other's face.    \"Go on,\" prompted Mr. Brinn.    \"And 'Nicol Brinn.'\"    Nicol Brinn stood still as a carven man. Indeed, only by an added  rigidity in his pose did he reward Paul Harley's intense scrutiny. A  silence charged with drama was finally broken by the American. \"Mr.  Harley,\" he said, \"you told me that you were up against the big  proposition of your career. You are right.\"    With that he sat down in an armchair and, resting his chin in his hand,  gazed fixedly into the empty grate. His pose was that of a man who is  suddenly called upon to review the course of his life and upon whose  decision respecting the future that life may depend. Paul Harley watched  him in silence.    \"Give me the whole story,\" said Mr. Brinn, \"right from the beginning.\"  He looked up. \"Do you know what you have done to-night, Mr. Harley?\"    Paul Harley shook his head. Swiftly, like the touch of an icy finger,  that warning note of danger had reached him again.    \"I'll tell you,\" continued Brinn. \"You have opened the gates of hell!\"    Not another word did he speak while Paul Harley, pacing slowly up and  down before the hearth, gave him a plain account of the case, omitting  all reference to his personal suspicions and to the measures which he  had taken to confirm them.    He laid his cards upon the table deliberately. Whether Sir Charles  Abingdon had uttered the name of Nicol Brinn as that of one whose aid  should be sought or as a warning, he had yet to learn. And by this  apparent frankness he hoped to achieve his object. That the celebrated  American was in any way concerned in the menace which had overhung Sir  Charles he was not prepared to believe. But he awaited with curiosity  that explanation which Nicol Brinn must feel called upon to offer.    \"You think he was murdered?\" said Brinn in his high, toneless voice.    \"I have formed no definite opinion. What is your own?\"    \"I may not look it,\" replied Brinn, \"but at this present moment I am the  most hopelessly puzzled and badly frightened man in London.\"    \"Frightened?\" asked Harley, curiously.    \"I said frightened, I also said puzzled; and I am far too puzzled to  be able to express any opinion respecting the death of Sir Charles  Abingdon. When I tell you all I know of him you will wonder as much as I  do, Mr. Harley, why my name should have been the last to pass his lips.\"    He half turned in the big chair to face his visitor, who now was  standing before the fireplace staring down at him.    \"One day last month,\" he resumed, \"I got out of my car in a big hurry at  the top of the Haymarket. A fool on a motorcycle passed between the  car and the sidewalk just as I stepped down, and I knew nothing further  until I woke up in a drug store close by, feeling very dazed and with  my coat in tatters and my left arm numbed from the elbow. A man was  standing watching me, and presently when I had pulled round he gave me  his card.    \"He was Sir Charles Abingdon, who had been passing at the time of the  accident. That was how I met him, and as there was nothing seriously  wrong with me I saw him no more professionally. But he dined with me a  week later and I had lunch at his club about a fortnight ago.\"    He looked up at Harley. \"On my solemn word of honour,\" he said, \"that's  all I know about Sir Charles Abingdon.\"    Paul Harley returned the other's fixed stare. \"I don't doubt your  assurance on the point, Mr. Brinn,\" he acknowledged. \"I can well  understand that you must be badly puzzled; but I would remind you of  your statement that you were also frightened. Why?\"    Nicol Brinn glanced rapidly about his own luxurious room in an oddly  apprehensive manner. \"I said that,\" he declared, \"and I meant it.\"    \"Then I can only suppose,\" resumed Harley, deliberately, \"that the cause  of your fear lies in the term, 'Fire-Tongue'?\"    Brinn again rested his chin in his hand, staring fixedly into the grate.    \"And possibly,\" went on the remorseless voice, \"you can explain the  significance of that term?\"    Nicol Brinn remained silent--but with one foot he was slowly tapping the  edge of the fender.    \"Mr. Harley,\" he began, abruptly, \"you have been perfectly frank with me  and in return I wish to be as frank with you as I can be. I am face to  face with a thing that has haunted me for seven years, and every step I  take from now onward has to be considered carefully, for any step might  be my last. And that's not the worst of the matter. I will risk one  of those steps here and now. You ask me to explain the significance of  Fire-Tongue\" (there was a perceptible pause before he pronounced the  word, which Harley duly noticed). \"I am going to tell you that Sir  Charles Abingdon, when I lunched with him at his club, asked me  precisely the same thing.\"    \"What! He asked you that so long as two weeks ago?\"    \"He did.\"    \"And what reason did he give for his inquiry?\"    Nicol Brinn began to tap the fender again with his foot. \"Let me think,\"  he replied. \"I recognize that you must regard my reticence as peculiar,  Mr. Harley, but if ever a man had reason to look before he leaped, I am  that man.\"    Silence fell again, and Paul Harley, staring down at Nicol Brinn,  realized that this indeed was the most hopelessly mystifying case which  fate had ever thrown in his way. This millionaire scholar and traveller,  whose figure was as familiar in remote cities of the world as it was  familiar in New York, in Paris, and in London, could not conceivably be  associated with any criminal organization. Yet his hesitancy was indeed  difficult to explain, and because it seemed to Harley that the cloud  which had stolen out across the house of Sir Charles Abingdon now hung  threateningly over those very chambers, he merely waited and wondered.    \"He referred to an experience which had befallen him in India,\" came  Nicol Brinn's belated reply.    \"In India? May I ask you to recount that experience?\"    \"Mr. Harley,\" replied Brinn, suddenly standing up, \"I can't.\"    \"You can't?\"    \"I have said so. But I'd give a lot more than you might believe to know  that Abingdon had told you the story which he told me.\"    \"You are not helping, Mr. Brinn,\" said Harley, sternly. \"I believe and  I think that you share my belief that Sir Charles Abingdon did not die  from natural causes. You are repressing valuable evidence. Allow me  to remind you that if anything should come to light necessitating a  post-mortem examination of the body, you will be forced to divulge in a  court of justice the facts which you refuse to divulge to me.\"    \"I know it,\" said Brinn, shortly.    He shot out one long arm and grasped Harley's shoulder as in a vice.  \"I'm counted a wealthy man,\" he continued, \"but I'd give every cent I  possess to see 'paid' put to the bill of a certain person. Listen.  You don't think I was in any way concerned in the death of Sir Charles  Abingdon? It isn't thinkable. But you do think I'm in possession of  facts which would help you find out who is. You're right.\"    \"Good God!\" cried Harley. \"Yet you remain silent!\"    \"Not so loud--not so loud!\" implored Brinn, repeating that odd, almost  furtive glance around. \"Mr. Harley--you know me. You've heard of me and  now you've met me. You know my place in the world. Do you believe me  when I say that from this moment onward I don't trust my own servants?  Nor my own friends?\" He removed his grip from Harley's shoulder.  \"Inanimate things look like enemies. That mummy over yonder may have  ears!\"    \"I'm afraid I don't altogether understand you.\"    \"See here!\"    Nicol Brinn crossed to a bureau, unlocked it, and while Harley watched  him curiously, sought among a number of press cuttings. Presently  he found the cutting for which he was looking. \"This was said,\" he  explained, handing the slip to Harley, \"at the Players' Club in New  York, after a big dinner in pre-dry days. It was said in confidence.  But some disguised reporter had got in and it came out in print next  morning. Read it.\"    Paul Harley accepted the cutting and read the following:         NICOL BRINN'S SECRET AMBITIONS   MILLIONAIRE SPORTSMAN WHO WANTS TO SHOOT                NIAGARA!
