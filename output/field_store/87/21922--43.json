Every man is equal here. Do you want to  join my band?\"    \"No, I don't.\"    \"Well, even if you did I imagine that wouldn't stop Bosomer. He's an  ugly fellow. He's one of the few gunmen I've met who wants to kill  somebody all the time. Most men like that are fourflushes. But Bosomer  is all one color, and that's red. Merely for your own sake I advise you  to hit the trail.\"    \"Thanks. But if that's all I'll stay,\" returned Duane. Even as he spoke  he felt that he did not know himself.    Bosomer appeared at the door, pushing men who tried to detain him, and  as he jumped clear of a last reaching hand he uttered a snarl like an  angry dog. Manifestly the short while he had spent inside the saloon had  been devoted to drinking and talking himself into a frenzy. Bland and  the other outlaws quickly moved aside, letting Duane stand alone. When  Bosomer saw Duane standing motionless and watchful a strange change  passed quickly in him. He halted in his tracks, and as he did that the  men who had followed him out piled over one another in their hurry to  get to one side.    Duane saw all the swift action, felt intuitively the meaning of it, and  in Bosomer's sudden change of front. The outlaw was keen, and he had  expected a shrinking, or at least a frightened antagonist. Duane knew he  was neither. He felt like iron, and yet thrill after thrill ran through  him. It was almost as if this situation had been one long familiar to  him. Somehow he understood this yellow-eyed Bosomer. The outlaw had  come out to kill him. And now, though somewhat checked by the stand of  a stranger, he still meant to kill. Like so many desperadoes of his  ilk, he was victim of a passion to kill for the sake of killing. Duane  divined that no sudden animosity was driving Bosomer. It was just his  chance. In that moment murder would have been joy to him. Very likely  he had forgotten his pretext for a quarrel. Very probably his faculties  were absorbed in conjecture as to Duane's possibilities.    But he did not speak a word. He remained motionless for a long moment,  his eyes pale and steady, his right hand like a claw.    That instant gave Duane a power to read in his enemy's eyes the thought  that preceded action. But Duane did not want to kill another man.  Still he would have to fight, and he decided to cripple Bosomer. When  Bosomer's hand moved Duane's gun was spouting fire. Two shots only--both  from Duane's gun--and the outlaw fell with his right arm shattered.  Bosomer cursed harshly and floundered in the dust, trying to reach the  gun with his left hand. His comrades, however, seeing that Duane would  not kill unless forced, closed in upon Bosomer and prevented any further  madness on his part.        CHAPTER V    Of the outlaws present Euchre appeared to be the one most inclined to  lend friendliness to curiosity; and he led Duane and the horses away  to a small adobe shack. He tied the horses in an open shed and removed  their saddles. Then, gathering up Stevens's weapons, he invited his  visitor to enter the house.    It had two rooms--windows without coverings--bare floors. One room  contained blankets, weapons, saddles, and bridles; the other a stone  fireplace, rude table and bench, two bunks, a box cupboard, and various  blackened utensils.    \"Make yourself to home as long as you want to stay,\" said Euchre. \"I  ain't rich in this world's goods, but I own what's here, an' you're  welcome.\"    \"Thanks. I'll stay awhile and rest. I'm pretty well played out,\" replied  Duane.    Euchre gave him a keen glance.    \"Go ahead an' rest. I'll take your horses to grass.\" Euchre left Duane  alone in the house. Duane relaxed then, and mechanically he wiped the  sweat from his face. He was laboring under some kind of a spell or shock  which did not pass off quickly. When it had worn away he took off his  coat and belt and made himself comfortable on the blankets. And he had a  thought that if he rested or slept what difference would it make on the  morrow? No rest, no sleep could change the gray outlook of the future.  He felt glad when Euchre came bustling in, and for the first time he  took notice of the outlaw.    Euchre was old in years. What little hair he had was gray, his face  clean-shaven and full of wrinkles; his eyes were half shut from long  gazing through the sun and dust. He stooped. But his thin frame denoted  strength and endurance still unimpaired.    \"Hey a drink or a smoke?\" he asked.    Duane shook his head. He had not been unfamiliar with whisky, and he  had used tobacco moderately since he was sixteen. But now, strangely, he  felt a disgust at the idea of stimulants. He did not understand clearly  what he felt. There was that vague idea of something wild in his blood,  something that made him fear himself.    Euchre wagged his old head sympathetically. \"Reckon you feel a little  sick. When it comes to shootin' I run. What's your age?\"    \"I'm twenty-three,\" replied Duane.    Euchre showed surprise. \"You're only a boy! I thought you thirty  anyways. Buck, I heard what you told Bland, an' puttin' thet with my  own figgerin', I reckon you're no criminal yet. Throwin' a gun in  self-defense--thet ain't no crime!\"    Duane, finding relief in talking, told more about himself.    \"Huh,\" replied the old man. \"I've been on this river fer years, an' I've  seen hundreds of boys come in on the dodge. Most of them, though, was no  good. An' thet kind don't last long. This river country has been an' is  the refuge fer criminals from all over the states. I've bunked with  bank cashiers, forgers, plain thieves, an' out-an'-out murderers, all  of which had no bizness on the Texas border. Fellers like Bland are  exceptions. He's no Texan--you seen thet. The gang he rules here come  from all over, an' they're tough cusses, you can bet on thet. They live  fat an' easy. If it wasn't fer the fightin' among themselves they'd  shore grow populous. The Rim Rock is no place for a peaceable, decent  feller. I heard you tell Bland you wouldn't join his gang. Thet'll not  make him take a likin' to you. Have you any money?\"    \"Not much,\" replied Duane.    \"Could you live by gamblin'? Are you any good at cards?\"    \"No.\"    \"You wouldn't steal hosses or rustle cattle?\"    \"No.\"    \"When your money's gone how'n hell will you live? There ain't any work  a decent feller could do. You can't herd with greasers. Why, Bland's men  would shoot at you in the fields. What'll you do, son?\"    \"God knows,\" replied Duane, hopelessly. \"I'll make my money last as long  as possible--then starve.\"    \"Wal, I'm pretty pore, but you'll never starve while I got anythin'.\"    Here it struck Duane again--that something human and kind and eager  which he had seen in Stevens. Duane's estimate of outlaws had lacked  this quality. He had not accorded them any virtues. To him, as to the  outside world, they had been merely vicious men without one redeeming  feature.    \"I'm much obliged to you, Euchre,\" replied Duane. \"But of course I won't  live with any one unless I can pay my share.\"    \"Have it any way you like, my son,\" said Euchre, good-humoredly. \"You  make a fire, an' I'll set about gettin' grub. I'm a sourdough, Buck.  Thet man doesn't live who can beat my bread.\"    \"How do you ever pack supplies in here?\" asked Duane, thinking of the  almost inaccessible nature of the valley.    \"Some comes across from Mexico, an' the rest down the river. Thet river  trip is a bird. It's more'n five hundred miles to any supply point.  Bland has mozos, greaser boatmen. Sometimes, too, he gets supplies in  from down-river. You see, Bland sells thousands of cattle in Cuba. An'  all this stock has to go down by boat to meet the ships.\"    \"Where on earth are the cattle driven down to the river?\" asked Duane.    \"Thet's not my secret,\" replied Euchre, shortly. \"Fact is, I don't know.  I've rustled cattle for Bland, but he never sent me through the Rim Rock  with them.\"    Duane experienced a sort of pleasure in the realization that interest  had been stirred in him. He was curious about Bland and his gang, and  glad to have something to think about. For every once in a while he had  a sensation that was almost like a pang. He wanted to forget. In the  next hour he did forget, and enjoyed helping in the preparation and  eating of the meal. Euchre, after washing and hanging up the several  utensils, put on his hat and turned to go out.    \"Come along or stay here, as you want,\" he said to Duane.    \"I'll stay,\" rejoined Duane, slowly.    The old outlaw left the room and trudged away, whistling cheerfully.    Duane looked around him for a book or paper, anything to read; but  all the printed matter he could find consisted of a few words on  cartridge-boxes and an advertisement on the back of a tobacco-pouch.  There seemed to be nothing for him to do. He had rested; he did not want  to lie down any more. He began to walk to and fro, from one end of the  room to the other. And as he walked he fell into the lately acquired  habit of brooding over his misfortune.    Suddenly he straightened up with a jerk. Unconsciously he had drawn his  gun. Standing there with the bright cold weapon in his hand, he looked  at it in consternation. How had he come to draw it? With difficulty  he traced his thoughts backward, but could not find any that was  accountable for his act. He discovered, however, that he had a  remarkable tendency to drop his hand to his gun. That might have come  from the habit long practice in drawing had given him. Likewise, it  might have come from a subtle sense, scarcely thought of at all, of the  late, close, and inevitable relation between that weapon and himself. He  was amazed to find that, bitter as he had grown at fate, the desire to  live burned strong in him. If he had been as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10317"],[0,"Betty Gordon at Boarding School; Or, The Treasure of Indian Chasm (#7)"],[1,"wrote her mother went to Shadyside  when it was a day school.\"    \"Yes, I believe it was, years and years ago,\" returned Louise Littell.  \"The aristocratic families who lived on large estates used to send  their daughters to Mrs. Warde. Her daughter, Mrs. Eustice, is the  principal now.\"    Betty wondered if Norma Guerin's mother had belonged to one of the  families who owned large estates, but they went down to dinner presently  and she forgot the Guerins for the time being.    That was a busy week for the school boys and girls.    The beautiful house and grounds of Fairfields were at their disposal, and  the gallant host and gentle hostess gave themselves up to the whims and  wishes of the houseful of young people.    \"Racket while you may, for school-room discipline is coming,\" laughed Mr.  Littell, when he went upstairs unexpectedly early one night and caught  the abashed Tucker twins sliding down the banisters.    Both Bob and Betty had wired Mr. Gordon of their safe arrival in  Washington, and Bob had also telegraphed his aunts. While they were at  Fairfields a letter reached them from Miss Hope and Miss Charity,  describing in glowing terms the boarding house in which they were  living and the California climate which, the writers declared, made  them feel \"twenty years younger.\" So Bob was assured that the elderly  ladies were neither homesick nor unhappy and that added appreciably to  his peace of mind.    He and Betty found time, too, to slip away from their gay companions and  go to the old second-hand bookshop where Lockwood Hale browsed among his  dusty volumes. He had set Bob upon the trail that led him West and  brought him finally to his surviving kin, and the boy felt warm gratitude  to the absent-minded old man.    Mr. and Mrs. Littell rigidly insisted that the last night before the  young folks started for Shadyside must be reserved for final packing and  early retirement so that the gay band might begin their journey  auspiciously. The Tuesday evening before the Thursday they were to leave  for school, the host and hostess gave a dance for their young people.    \"I'm glad to have at least one chance to wear this dress,\" observed  Bobby, smoothing down the folds of her rose-colored frock with  satisfaction. \"The only thing I don't like about Shadyside, so far, is  that restriction about party clothes.\"    \"I imagine it is a wise rule in many ways,\" said Betty sagely, thinking  particularly of the Guerin girls, who would probably be hard-pressed to  get even the one evening frock allowed. \"You know how some girls are,  Bobby; they'd come with a dozen crepe de chine and georgette dresses and  about three clean blouses for school-room wear.\"    \"Like Ruth Gladys Royal,\" giggled Bobby. \"I remember her at Miss  Graham's last year. Goodness, the clothes that girl would wear! The rest  of us didn't even try to compete. And, by the way, girls, Ruth Gladys is  going to Shadyside. Her aunt telephoned mother last night while we were  at the movies.\"    \"That's the girl we went to call on that day we saw Mr. Peabody tackle  Bob in the hotel,\" Louise explained in an aside to Betty. \"I wonder why  every one seems bent and determined to go to Shadyside this year.\"    \"Because it is a fine school with a half-century reputation,\" Bobby, who  had studied the catalogue, informed her sister primly.    \"I'm not going,\" objected Esther. \"I think it's mean.\"    \"Mother and dad need one girl at home, dearest,\" her mother reminded her,  as she came in looking very handsome and kindly in a black spangled net  gown. \"All ready, girls? Then suppose we go down.\"    It was a simple and informal dance, as befitted the ages of the guests,  but Mr. and Mrs. Littell knew to perfection the secret of making each one  enjoy himself. There were a handful of outside friends invited, and  Betty, to whom a party was a never-failing source of delight, felt, as  she confided to Bob, as though she were \"walking on air.\"    \"You look awfully nice in that white stuff,\" he said frankly, and Betty  liked the comment on her pretty ruffled white frock which she had  dubiously decided a moment before was too plain.    Betty was what country folk call a \"natural-born dancer,\" and she  quickly learned the new steps she had had no opportunity to practice  since going West. All the girls and most of the boys were excellent  dancers, too, and Bob was not allowed to beg off. Frances Martin, the  last girl one would have named, had taught a dancing class in her home  town with great success and she volunteered to lead Bob. To his surprise,  the boy found he liked the music and movement and before the evening was  over he was in a fair way to become a good dancer.    The party broke up promptly at eleven o'clock, and a few minutes later  the whir of the last motor bearing home the departing guests died away.  There was a natural lingering to \"talk things over,\" but by twelve the  house was silent and dark.    Betty had just fairly dozed off when some one woke her by shaking  her gently.    \"Betty! Betty, please wake up!\" whispered a frightened little voice.          CHAPTER VIII    TOO MUCH PARTY      Betty shared a room with Bobby. The single beds were separated by a  table on which an electric drop light and the water pitcher and glasses  were placed.    Betty's first impulse was to snap on the light, but as she put out her  hand, Esther grasped her wrist.    \"It's only me,\" she whispered, her teeth chattering with fright. \"Don't  wake Bobby up.\"    \"Are you cold?\" asked Betty, sitting up anxiously. \"Perhaps you were too  warm dancing. Do you want to get into bed with me?\"    It was a warm night for October, and Betty was at a loss to understand  Esther's shivering.    \"I can't find Libbie!\" Esther cried. \"Oh, Betty, I never thought she  would do it, never.\"    Betty reached for her dressing gown and slippers.    \"Don't cry, or you'll wake up Bobby,\" she advised the sobbing Esther.  \"Come on, I'll go back with you. Don't make a noise.\"    The girls occupied three connecting rooms, and Esther and Libbie had  slept in the end of the suite. To reach it now, the two girls had to go  through the room where Louise and Frances lay slumbering peacefully.  Betty breathed a sigh of relief when they gained Esther's room and she  closed the door carefully and turned on the light.    Esther's bed, madly tumbled, and Libbie's, evidently occupied that night,  but now empty, were revealed.    Esther dropped down on the floor, wrapping her kimono about her, and  regarded Betty trustfully. She was sure her friend would straighten  things out.    \"Where is Libbie?\" demanded Betty. \"What is she doing?\"    \"I don't know,\" admitted Esther unhappily. \"But I tell you what I  think--I think she's eloped!\"    Esther was only eleven, and as she sat on the floor and stared at Betty  from great wet blue eyes, she seemed very young indeed.    \"Eloped!\" gasped Betty. \"Why, I never heard of such a thing!\"    \"She's always talking about it,\" the younger girl wailed, beginning to  cry again. \"She says it's the most romantic way to be married, and she  means to throw her hope chest out of the window first and slide down a  rope made of bedsheets.\"    \"Well, I think it's very silly to talk like that,\" scolded Betty. \"And,  what's more, Esther, however much Libbie may talk of eloping, she hasn't  done it this time. All her clothes are here, and her shoes and her hat.  Here's her purse on the dresser, too.\"    \"I never thought of looking to see if her clothes were here,\" confessed  Esther. \"But then, where is she, Betty?\"    \"That's what I mean to find out,\" announced Betty, with more confidence  than she felt. \"Come on, Esther. And don't trip on your kimono or walk  into anything.\"    They tiptoed out into the wide hall and had reached the head of the  beautiful carved staircase when they saw a dim form coming toward them.    Esther nearly shrieked aloud, but Betty put a hand over her mouth in  time.    \"Who--who, who-o-o are you?\" stammered Betty, her heart beating so fast  it was painful.    \"Betty!\" Bob stifled a gasp. \"For the love of Mike! what are you doing at  this time of night?\"    \"Esther's here--we're hunting for Libbie,\" whispered Betty. \"She isn't in  her room.\"    \"So that's it!\" For some reason unknown to the girls Bob seemed to be  vastly relieved. \"I was just going after Mr. Littell,\" he added.    \"But Libbie is lost! Maybe she is sick,\" urged Betty.    \"She's all right,\" declared Bob confidently. \"You see, I couldn't go to  sleep, and after I'd been in bed about an hour I got up and sat by the  window. I was staring down into the garden, and all of a sudden I saw  something white begin to move and creep about. I watched it a few moments  and I got the idea it was a burglar or a sneak thief, it kept so close to  the house. I came down to call Mr. Littell and bumped into you.\"    \"Do you suppose it is Libbie?\" chattered Esther. \"Why would she go into  the garden in the middle of the night?\"    \"Walking in her sleep,\" explained Bob. \"I've heard it is dangerous to  waken a sleep-walker suddenly. Perhaps you'd better call Mrs. Littell,  Betty, and I'll sit here on the window seat and see that she doesn't walk  out into the road.\"    The two girls hurried off and tapped lightly on Mrs. Littell's door. That  lady hurriedly admitted them, her motherly mind instantly picturing  something wrong.    \"It's Libbie,\" said Betty softly. \"Bob saw her from his window in the  garden and he thinks she's walking in her sleep. We don't want to  frighten her. What can we do?\"    \"I'll be right out,\" said Mrs. Littell reassuringly. \"Libbie's mother  used to walk in her sleep, too. I think I can get the child into bed  without waking her at all.\"    In a few moments she came out, a heavy corduroy robe and slippers  protecting her against the night air.    \"Esther, lamb, you stay here in the hall with Bob,\" she directed her  youngest daughter. \"You won't be afraid with Bob, will you, "]]]
