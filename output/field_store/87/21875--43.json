Twenty thousand were brought against us,    A veteran force furnish'd with good artillery.    I tell not now the whole of the battle,    But one brigade early in the forenoon order'd forward to engage the              red-coats,    Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march'd,    And how long and well it stood confronting death.      Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting              death?    It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,    Raised in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known personally to              the General.      Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus' waters,    Till of a sudden unlook'd for by defiles through the woods, gain'd at              night,    The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing              their guns,    That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy's mercy.      The General watch'd them from this hill,    They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,    They drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the              middle,    But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!      It sickens me yet, that slaughter!    I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.    I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.      Meanwhile the British manoeuvr'd to draw us out for a pitch'd battle,    But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.      We fought the fight in detachments.    Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was              against us,    Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us back to              the works on this hill,    Till we turn'd menacing here, and then he left us.      That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two              thousand strong,    Few return'd, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.    That and here my General's first battle,    No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude with              applause,    Nobody clapp'd hands here then.      But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,    Wearied that night we lay foil'd and sullen,    While scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord oft' against us              encamp'd,    Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over              their victory.      So dull and damp and another day,    But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,    Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my              General retreated.      I saw him at the river-side,    Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;    My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd over,    And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for the              last time.      Every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom,    Many no doubt thought of capitulation.      But when my General pass'd me,    As he stood in his boat and look'd toward the coming sun,    I saw something different from capitulation.      _Terminus._      Enough, the Centenarian's story ends,    The two, the past and present, have interchanged,    I myself as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now              speaking.      And is this the ground Washington trod?    And these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he              cross'd,    As resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs?      I must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward,    I must preserve that look as it beam'd on you rivers of Brooklyn.      See--as the annual round returns the phantoms return,    It is the 27th of August and the British have landed,    The battle begins and goes against us, behold through the smoke              Washington's face,    The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march'd forth to intercept              the enemy,    They are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them,    Rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,    Baptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds,    In death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears.      Ah, hills and slopes of Brooklyn! I perceive you are more valuable              than your owners supposed;    In the midst of you stands an encampment very old,    Stands forever the camp of that dead brigade.          CAVALRY CROSSING A FORD.        A line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands,    They take a serpentine course, their arms flash in the sun--hark to              the musical clank,    Behold the silvery river, in it the splashing horses loitering stop              to drink,    Behold the brown-faced men, each group, each person a picture, the              negligent rest on the saddles,    Some emerge on the opposite bank, others are just entering the              ford--while    Scarlet and blue and snowy white,    The guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind.          BIVOUAC ON A MOUNTAIN SIDE.        I see before me now a traveling army halting,    Below a fertile valley spread, with barns and the orchards of summer,    Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt, in places rising              high,    Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes dingily              seen,    The numerous camp-fires scatter'd near and far, some away up on the              mountain,    The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized,              flickering,    And over all the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, studded,              breaking out, the eternal stars.          AN ARMY CORPS ON THE MARCH.        With its cloud of skirmishers in advance,    With now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip, and now an              irregular volley,    The swarming ranks press on and on, the dense brigades press on,    Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun--the dust-cover'd men,    In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground,    With artillery interspers'd--the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,    As the army corps advances.          BY THE BIVOUAC'S FITFUL FLAME.        By the bivouac's fitful flame,    A procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slow--but first              I note,    The tents of the sleeping army, the fields' and woods' dim out-line,    The darkness lit by spots of kindled fire, the silence,    Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving,    The shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily              watching me,)    While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous thoughts,    Of life and death, of home and the past and loved, and of those that              are far away;    A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground,    By the bivouac's fitful flame.          COME UP FROM THE FIELDS FATHER.        Come up from the fields father, here's a letter from our Pete,    And come to the front door mother, here's a letter from thy dear son.      Lo, 'tis autumn,    Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,    Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the              moderate wind,    Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis'd              vines,    (Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?    Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)    Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and              with wondrous clouds,    Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers              well.      Down in the fields all prospers well,    But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter's call,    And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away.      Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling,    She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.      Open the envelope quickly,    O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd,    O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother's soul!    All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main              words only,    Sentences broken, _gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish,              taken to hospital,    At present low, but will soon be better._      Ah now the single figure to me,    Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,    Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,    By the jamb of a door leans.      _Grieve not so, dear mother_, (the just-grown daughter speaks through              her sobs,    The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay'd,)    _See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better._      Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be              better, that brave and simple soul,)    While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,    The only son is dead.      But the mother needs to be better,    She with thin form presently drest in black,    By day her meals untouch'd, then at night fitfully sleeping, often              waking,    In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,    O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and              withdraw,    To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.          VIGIL STRANGE I KEPT ON THE FIELD ONE NIGHT.        Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;    When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,    One look I but gave which your dear eyes return'd with a look I shall              never forget,    One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the              ground,    Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,    Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made my              way,    Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/884"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 3 (#6)"],[1,"name of this great man  cannot be omitted, although, unlike many others of whom we shall have  occasion to speak, he only made it secondary to other pursuits. The  love of universal knowledge that filled his mind, would not allow him to  neglect one branch of science, of which neither he nor the world could  yet see the absurdity. He made ample amends for his time lost in this  pursuit by his knowledge in physics and his acquaintance with astronomy.  The telescope, burning-glasses, and gunpowder, are discoveries which may  well carry his fame to the remotest time, and make the world blind to  the one spot of folly--the diagnosis of the age in which he lived,  and the circumstances by which he was surrounded. His treatise on  the \"Admirable Power of Art and Nature in the Production of the  Philosopher's Stone\" was translated into French by Girard de Tormes, and  published at Lyons in 1557. His \"Mirror of Alchymy\" was also published  in French in the same year, and in Paris in 1612, with some additions  from the works of Raymond Lulli. A complete list of all the published  treatises upon the subject may be seen in Lenglet du Fresnoy.      POPE JOHN XXII.    This Prelate is said to have been the friend and pupil of Arnold de  Villeneuve, by whom he was instructed in all the secrets of alchymy.  Tradition asserts of him, that he made great quantities of gold, and  died as rich as Croesus. He was born at Cahors, in the province of  Guienne, in the year 1244. He was a very eloquent preacher, and soon  reached high dignity in the Church. He wrote a work on the transmutation  of metals, and had a famous laboratory at Avignon. He issued two Bulls  against the numerous pretenders to the art, who had sprung up in every  part of Christendom; from which it might be inferred that he was himself  free from the delusion. The alchymists claim him, however, as one of the  most distinguished and successful professors of their art, and say  that his Bulls were not directed against the real adepts, but the false  pretenders. They lay particular stress upon these words in his Bull,  \"Spondent, quas non exhibent, divitias, pauperes alchymistae.\" These, it  is clear, they say, relate only to poor alchymists, and therefore false  ones. He died in the year 1344, leaving in his coffers a sum of eighteen  millions of florins. Popular belief alleged that he had made, and not  amassed, this treasure; and alchymists complacently cite this as a proof  that the philosopher's stone was not such a chimera as the incredulous  pretended. They take it for granted that John really left this money,  and ask by what possible means he could have accumulated it. Replying  to their own question, they say triumphantly, \"His book shows it was by  alchymy, the secrets of which he learned from Arnold de Villeneuve and  Raymond Lulli. But he was as prudent as all other hermetic philosophers.  Whoever would read his book to find out his secret, would employ all his  labour in vain; the Pope took good care not to divulge it.\" Unluckily  for their own credit, all these gold-makers are in the same predicament;  their great secret loses its worth most wonderfully in the telling, and  therefore they keep it snugly to themselves. Perhaps they thought that,  if everybody could transmute metals, gold would be so plentiful that it  would be no longer valuable, and that some new art would be requisite  to transmute it back again into steel and iron. If so, society is much  indebted to them for their forbearance.      JEAN DE MEUNG    All classes of men dabbled in the art at this time; the last mentioned  was a Pope, the one of whom we now speak was a poet. Jean de Meung, the  celebrated author of the \"Roman de la Rose,\" was born in the year 1279  or 1280, and was a great personage at the courts of Louis X, Philip the  Long, Charles IV, and Philip de Valois. His famous poem of the \"Roman  de la Rose,\" which treats of every subject in vogue at that day,  necessarily makes great mention of alchymy. Jean was a firm believer  in the art, and wrote, besides his, \"Roman,\" two shorter poems, the one  entitled, \"The Remonstrance of Nature to the wandering Alchymist,\" and  \"The Reply of the Alchymist to Nature.\" Poetry and alchymy were his  delight, and priests and women were his abomination. A pleasant story is  related of him and the ladies of the court of Charles IV. He had written  the following libellous couplet upon the fair sex:--         \"Toutes etes, serez, ou futes       De fait ou de volonte, putains,       Et qui, tres bien vous chercherait       Toutes putains, vous trouverait.\"    [These verses are but a coarser expression of the slanderous line of  Pope, that \"every woman is at heart a rake.\"]    This naturally gave great offence; and being perceived one day, in the  King's antechamber, by some ladies who were waiting for an audience,  they resolved to punish him. To the number of ten or twelve, they armed  themselves with canes and rods; and surrounding the unlucky poet, called  upon the gentlemen present to strip him naked, that they might wreak  just vengeance upon him, and lash him through the streets of the town.  Some of the lords present were in no wise loth, and promised themselves  great sport from his punishment. But Jean de Meung was unmoved by their  threats, and stood up calmly in the midst of them, begging them to hear  him first, and then, if not satisfied, they might do as they liked with  him. Silence being restored, he stood upon a chair, and entered on his  defence. He acknowledged that he was the author of the obnoxious verses,  but denied that they bore reference to all womankind. He only meant to  speak of the vicious and abandoned, whereas those whom he saw around  him, were patterns of virtue, loveliness, and modesty. If, however, any  lady present thought herself aggrieved, he would consent to be stripped,  and she might lash him till her arms were wearied. It is added, that  by this means Jean escaped his flogging, and that the wrath of the  fair ones immediately subsided. The gentlemen present were, however, of  opinion, that if every lady in the room, whose character corresponded  with the verses, had taken him at his word, the poet would, in all  probability, have been beaten to death. All his life long he evinced a  great animosity towards the priesthood, and his famous poem abounds with  passages reflecting upon their avarice, cruelty, and immorality. At his  death he left a large box, filled with some weighty material, which he  bequeathed to the Cordeliers, as a peace-offering, for the abuse he had  lavished upon them. As his practice of alchymy was well-known, it was  thought the box was filled with gold and silver, and the Cordeliers  congratulated each other on their rich acquisition. When it came to be  opened, they found to their horror that it was filled only with slates,  scratched with hieroglyphic and cabalistic characters. Indignant at the  insult, they determined to refuse him Christian burial, on pretence  that he was a sorcerer. He was, however, honourably buried in Paris, the  whole court attending his funeral.      NICHOLAS FLAMEL.    The story of this alchymist, as handed down by tradition, and enshrined  in the pages of Lenglet du Fresnoy, is not a little marvellous. He was  born at Pontoise of a poor but respectable family, at the end of  the thirteenth, or beginning of the fourteenth, century. Having no  patrimony, he set out for Paris at an early age, to try his fortune as a  public scribe. He had received a good education, was well skilled in  the learned languages, and was an excellent penman. He soon procured  occupation as a letter-writer and copyist, and used to sit at the corner  of the Rue de Marivaux, and practise his calling: but he hardly made  profits enough to keep body and soul together. To mend his fortunes  he tried poetry; but this was a more wretched occupation still. As a  transcriber he had at least gained bread and cheese; but his rhymes were  not worth a crust. He then tried painting with as little success; and as  a last resource, began to search for the philosopher's stone, and tell  fortunes. This was a happier idea; he soon increased in substance, and  had wherewithal to live comfortably. He, therefore, took unto himself  his wife Petronella, and began to save money; but continued to all  outward appearance as poor and miserable as before. In the course of a  few years, he became desperately addicted to the study of alchymy, and  thought of nothing but the philosopher's stone, the elixir of life, and  the universal alkahest. In the year 1257, he bought by chance an old  book for two florins, which soon became the sole study and object of his  life. It was written with a steel instrument upon the bark of trees, and  contained twenty-one, or as he himself always expressed it, three times  seven, leaves. The writing was very elegant and in the Latin language.  Each seventh leaf contained a picture and no writing. On the first  of these was a serpent swallowing rods; on the second, a cross with a  serpent crucified; and on the third, the representation of a desert, in  the midst of which was a fountain with serpents crawling from side to  side. It purported to be written by no less a personage than \"Abraham,  patriarch, Jew, prince, philosopher, priest, Levite, and astrologer;\"  and invoked curses upon any one who should cast eyes upon it, without  being a sacrificer or a scribe. Nicholas Flamel never thought it  extraordinary that Abraham should have known Latin, and was convinced  that the characters on his book had been traced by the hands of that  great patriarch himself. He was at first afraid to read it, after he  became aware of the curse it contained; but he got over that difficulty  by recollecting that, although he was not a sacrificer, he had practised  as a scribe. As he read he was filled with admiration, and found that it  was a perfect treatise upon the transmutation of"]]]
