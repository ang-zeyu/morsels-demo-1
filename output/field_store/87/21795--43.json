I'll show you the way to your study, if you like. Come along  upstairs.'    'Thanks, awfully. It's awfully good of you,' said the gratified  unknown, and they went upstairs together.    One of the doors which they passed on their way was open, disclosing to  view a room which, though bare at present, looked as if it might be  made exceedingly comfortable.    'That's my den,' said Harrison. It was perhaps lucky that Graham, to  whom the room belonged, in fact, as opposed to fiction, did not hear  the remark. Graham and Harrison were old and tried foes. 'This is  yours.' Harrison pushed open another door at the end of the passage.    His companion stared blankly at the Oriental luxury which met his eye.  'But, I say,' he said, 'are you sure? This seems to be occupied  already.'    'Oh, no, that's all right,' said Harrison, airily. 'The chap who used  to be here left last term. He didn't know he was going to leave till it  was too late to pack up all his things, so he left his study as it was.  All you've got to do is to cart the things out into the passage and  leave them there. The Moke'll take 'em away.'    The Moke was the official who combined in a single body the duties of  butler and bootboy at Merevale's House. 'Oh, right-ho!' said the  unknown, and Harrison left him.    Harrison's idea was that when Venables returned and found an absolute  stranger placidly engaged in wrecking his carefully-tidied study, he  would at once, and without making inquiries, fall upon that absolute  stranger and blot him off the face of the earth. Afterwards it might  possibly come out that he, Harrison, had been not altogether  unconnected with the business, and then, he was fain to admit, there  might be trouble. But he was a youth who never took overmuch heed for  the morrow. Sufficient unto the day was his motto. And, besides, it was  distinctly worth risking. The main point, and the one with which alone  the House would concern itself, was that he had completely taken in,  scored off, and overwhelmed the youth who had done as much by him in  the train, and his reputation as one not to be lightly trifled with  would be restored to its former brilliance. Anything that might happen  between himself and Venables subsequently would be regarded as a purely  private matter between man and man, affecting the main point not at  all.    About an hour later a small Merevalian informed Harrison that Venables  wished to see him in his study. He went. Experience had taught him that  when the Head of the House sent for him, it was as a rule as well to  humour his whim and go. He was prepared for a good deal, for he had  come to the conclusion that it was impossible for him to preserve his  incognito in the matter, but he was certainly not prepared for what he  saw.    Venables and the stranger were seated in two armchairs, apparently on  the very best of terms with one another. And this, in spite of the fact  that these two armchairs were the only furniture left in the study. The  rest, as he had noted with a grin before he had knocked at the door,  was picturesquely scattered about the passage.    'Hullo, Harrison,' said Venables, 'I wanted to see you. There seems to  have been a slight mistake somewhere. Did you tell my brother to shift  all the furniture out of the study?'    Harrison turned a delicate shade of green.    'Your--er--brother?' he gurgled.    'Yes. I ought to have told you my brother was coming to the Coll. this  term. I told the Old Man and Merevale and the rest of the authorities.  Can't make out why I forgot you. Slipped my mind somehow. However, you  seem to have been doing the square thing by him, showing him round and  so on. Very good of you.'    Harrison smiled feebly. Venables junior grinned. What seemed to  Harrison a mystery was how the brothers had managed to arrive at the  School at different times. The explanation of which was in reality very  simple. The elder Venables had been spending the last week of the  holidays with MacArthur, the captain of the St Austin's Fifteen, the  same being a day boy, suspended within a mile of the School.    'But what I can't make out,' went on Venables, relentlessly, 'is this  furniture business. To the best of my knowledge I didn't leave suddenly  at the end of last term. I'll ask if you like, to make sure, but I  fancy you'll find you've been mistaken. Must have been thinking of  someone else. Anyhow, we thought you must know best, so we lugged all  the furniture out into the passage, and now it appears there's been a  mistake of sorts, and the stuff ought to be inside all the time. So  would you mind putting it back again? We'd help you, only we're going  out to the shop to get some tea. You might have it done by the time we  get back. Thanks, awfully.'    Harrison coughed nervously, and rose to a point of order.    'I was going out to tea, too,' he said.    'I'm sorry, but I think you'll have to scratch the engagement,' said  Venables.    Harrison made a last effort.    'I'm fagging for Welch this term,' he protested.    It was the rule at St Austin's that every fag had the right to refuse  to serve two masters. Otherwise there would have been no peace for that  down-trodden race.    'That,' said Venables, 'ought to be awfully jolly for Welch, don't you  know, but as a matter of fact term hasn't begun yet. It doesn't start  till tomorrow. Weigh in.'    Various feelings began to wage war beneath Harrison's Eton waistcoat. A  profound disinclination to undertake the suggested task battled briskly  with a feeling that, if he refused the commission, things might--nay,  would--happen.    'Harrison,' said Venables gently, but with meaning, as he hesitated,  'do you know what it is to wish you had never been born?'    And Harrison, with a thoughtful expression on his face, picked up a  photograph from the floor, and hung it neatly in its place over the  mantelpiece.          [5]    BRADSHAW'S LITTLE STORY      The qualities which in later years rendered Frederick Wackerbath  Bradshaw so conspicuous a figure in connection with the now celebrated  affair of the European, African, and Asiatic Pork Pie and Ham Sandwich  Supply Company frauds, were sufficiently in evidence during his school  career to make his masters prophesy gloomily concerning his future. The  boy was in every detail the father of the man. There was the same  genial unscrupulousness, upon which the judge commented so bitterly  during the trial, the same readiness to seize an opportunity and make  the most of it, the same brilliance of tactics. Only once during those  years can I remember an occasion on which Justice scored a point  against him. I can remember it, because I was in a sense responsible  for his failure. And he can remember it, I should be inclined to think,  for other reasons. Our then Headmaster was a man with a straight eye  and a good deal of muscular energy, and it is probable that the  talented Frederick, in spite of the passage of years, has a tender  recollection of these facts.    It was the eve of the Euripides examination in the Upper Fourth.  Euripides is not difficult compared to some other authors, but he does  demand a certain amount of preparation. Bradshaw was a youth who did  less preparation than anybody I have ever seen, heard of, or read of,  partly because he preferred to peruse a novel under the table during  prep., but chiefly, I think, because he had reduced cribbing in form to  such an exact science that he loved it for its own sake, and would no  sooner have come tamely into school with a prepared lesson than a  sportsman would shoot a sitting bird. It was not the marks that he  cared for. He despised them. What he enjoyed was the refined pleasure  of swindling under a master's very eye. At the trial the judge, who  had, so ran report, been himself rather badly bitten by the Ham  Sandwich Company, put the case briefly and neatly in the words, 'You  appear to revel in villainy for villainy's sake,' and I am almost  certain that I saw the beginnings of a gratified smile on Frederick's  expressive face as he heard the remark. The rest of our study--the  juniors at St Austin's pigged in quartettes--were in a state of  considerable mental activity on account of this Euripides examination.  There had been House-matches during the preceding fortnight, and  House-matches are not a help to study, especially if you are on the  very fringe of the cock-house team, as I was. By dint of practising  every minute of spare time, I had got the eleventh place for my  fielding. And, better still, I had caught two catches in the second  innings, one of them a regular gallery affair, and both off the  captain's bowling. It was magnificent, but it was not Euripides, and I  wished now that it had been. Mellish, our form-master, had an  unpleasant habit of coming down with both feet, as it were, on members  of his form who failed in the book-papers.    We were working, therefore, under forced draught, and it was distinctly  annoying to see the wretched Bradshaw lounging in our only armchair  with one of Rider Haggard's best, seemingly quite unmoved at the  prospect of Euripides examinations. For all he appeared to care,  Euripides might never have written a line in his life.    Kendal voiced the opinion of the meeting.    'Bradshaw, you worm,' he said. 'Aren't you going to do _any_  work?'    'Think not. What's the good? Can't get up a whole play of Euripides in  two hours.'    'Mellish'll give you beans.'    'Let him.'    'You'll get a jolly bad report.'    'Shan't get a report at all. I always intercept it before my guardian  can get it. He never says anything.'    'Mellish'll probably run you in to the Old Man,' said White, the fourth  occupant of the study.    Bradshaw turned on us with a wearied air.    'Oh, do give us a rest,' he said. 'Here you are just going to do a most  important exam., and you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6984"],[0,"The Pothunters (#6)"],[1,"back on the last evening of the holidays. When  I got into this study, there was the man Plunkett sitting in the best  chair, reading.'    'Probably reading Herodotus in the original Greek,' snorted Dallas.    'He didn't take the slightest notice of me. I stood in the doorway like  Patience on a monument for about a quarter of an hour. Then I coughed.  He took absolutely no notice. I coughed again, loud enough to crack the  windows. Then I got tired of it, and said \"Hullo\". He did look up at  that. \"Hullo,\" he said, \"you've got rather a nasty cough.\" I said  \"Yes\", and waited for him to throw himself on my bosom and explain  everything, you know.'    'Did he?' asked the Babe, deeply interested.    'Not a bit,' said Dallas, 'he--sorry, Vaughan, fire ahead.'    'He went on reading. After a bit I said I hoped he was fairly  comfortable. He said he was. Conversation languished again. I made  another shot. \"Looking for anybody?\" I said. \"No,\" he said, \"are you?\"  \"No.\" \"Then why the dickens should I be?\" he said. I didn't quite  follow his argument. In fact, I don't even now. \"Look here,\" I said,  \"tell me one thing. Have you or have you not bought this place? If you  have, all right. If you haven't, I'm going to sling you out, and jolly  soon, too.\" He looked at me in his superior sort of way, and observed  without blenching that he was head of the House.'    'Just another of Ward's jars,' said Dallas. 'Knowing that Vaughan was  keen on being head of the House he actually went to the Old Man and  persuaded him that it would be better to bring in some day boy who was  a School-prefect than let Vaughan boss the show. What do you think of  that?'    'Pretty low,' said the Babe.    'Said I was thoughtless and headstrong,' cut in Vaughan, spearing a  sausage as if it were Mr Ward's body. 'Muffins up, Dallas, old man.  When the sausages are done to a turn. \"Thoughtless and headstrong.\"  Those were his very words.'    'Can't you imagine the old beast?' said Dallas, pathetically, 'Can't  you see him getting round the Old Man? A capital lad at heart, I am  sure, distinctly a capital lad, but thoughtless and headstrong, far too  thoughtless for a position so important as that of head of my House.  The abandoned old wreck!'    Tea put an end for the moment to conversation, but when the last  sausage had gone the way of all flesh, Vaughan returned to the sore  subject like a moth to a candle.    'It isn't only the not being head of the House that I bar. It's the man  himself. You say you haven't studied Plunkett much. When you get to  know him better, you'll appreciate his finer qualities more. There are  so few of them.'    'The only fine quality I've ever seen in him,' said Dallas, 'is his  habit of slinking off in the afternoons when he ought to be playing  games, and not coming back till lock-up.'    'Which brings us back to where we started,' put in the Babe. 'You were  wondering what he did with himself.'    'Yes, it can't be anything good so we'll put beetles and butterflies  out of the question right away. He might go and poach. There's heaps of  opportunity round here for a chap who wants to try his hand at that. I  remember, when I was a kid, Morton Smith, who used to be in this  House--remember him?--took me to old what's-his-name's place. Who's  that frantic blood who owns all that land along the Badgwick road? The  M.P. man.'    'Milord Sir Alfred Venner, M.P., of Badgwick Hall.'    'That's the man. Generally very much of Badgwick Hall. Came down last  summer on Prize Day. One would have thought from the side on him that  he was all sorts of dooks. Anyhow, Morton-Smith took me rabbiting  there. I didn't know it was against the rules or anything. Had a grand  time. A few days afterwards, Milord Sir Venner copped him on the hop  and he got sacked. There was an awful row. I thought my hair would have  turned white.'    'I shouldn't think the Mutual poaches,' said Vaughan. 'He hasn't got  the enterprise to poach an egg even. No, it can't be that.'    'Perhaps he bikes?' said the Babe.    'No, he's not got a bike. He's the sort of chap, though, to borrow  somebody else's without asking. Possibly he does bike.'    'If he does,' said Dallas, 'it's only so as to get well away from the  Coll., before starting on his career of crime. I'll swear he does break  rules like an ordinary human being when he thinks it's safe. Those  aggressively pious fellows generally do.'    'I didn't know he was that sort,' said the Babe. 'Don't you find it  rather a jar?'    'Just a bit. He jaws us sometimes till we turn and rend him.'    'Yes, he's an awful man,' said Vaughan.    'Don't stop,' said the Babe, encouragingly, after the silence had  lasted some time. 'It's a treat picking a fellow to pieces like this.'    'I don't know if that's your beastly sarcasm, Babe,' said Vaughan,  'but, speaking for self and partner, I don't know how we should get on  if we didn't blow off steam occasionally in this style.'    'We should probably last out for a week, and then there would be a  sharp shriek, a hollow groan, and all that would be left of the Mutual  Friend would be a slight discolouration on the study carpet.'    'Coupled with an aroma of fresh gore.'    'Perhaps that's why he goes off in the afternoons,' suggested the Babe.  'Doesn't want to run any risks.'    'Shouldn't wonder.'    'He's such a rotten head of the House, too,' said Vaughan. 'Ward may  gas about my being headstrong and thoughtless, but I'm dashed if I  would make a bally exhibition of myself like the Mutual.'    'What's he do?' enquired the Babe.    'It's not so much what he does. It's what he doesn't do that sickens  me,' said Dallas. 'I may be a bit of a crock in some ways--for further  details apply to Ward--but I can stop a couple of fags ragging if I  try.'    'Can't Plunkett?'    'Not for nuts. He's simply helpless when there's anything going on that  he ought to stop. Why, the other day there was a row in the fags' room  that you could almost have heard at your place, Babe. We were up here  working. The Mutual was jawing as usual on the subject of cramming tips  for the Aeschylus exam. Said it wasn't scholarship, or some rot. What  business is it of his how a chap works, I should like to know. Just as  he had got under way, the fags began kicking up more row than ever.'    'I said', cut in Vaughan, 'that instead of minding other people's  business, he'd better mind his own for a change, and go down and stop  the row.'    'He looked a bit green at that,' said Dallas. 'Said the row didn't  interfere with him. \"Does with us,\" I said. \"It's all very well for  you. You aren't doing a stroke of work. No amount of row matters to a  chap who's only delivering a rotten sermon on scholarship. Vaughan and  I happen to be trying to do some work.\" \"All right,\" he said, \"if you  want the row stopped, why don't you go and stop it? What's it got to do  with me?\"'    'Rotter!' interpolated the Babe.    'Wasn't he? Well, of course we couldn't stand that.'    'We crushed him,' said Vaughan.    'I said: \"In my young days the head of the House used to keep order for  himself.\" I asked him what he thought he was here for. Because he isn't  ornamental. So he went down after that.'    'Well?' said the Babe. Being a miserable day boy he had had no  experience of the inner life of a boarding House, which is the real  life of a public school. His experience of life at St Austin's was  limited to doing his work and playing centre-three-quarter for the  fifteen. Which, it may be remarked in passing, he did extremely well.    Dallas took up the narrative. 'Well, after he'd been gone about five  minutes, and the row seemed to be getting worse than ever, we thought  we'd better go down and investigate. So we did.'    'And when we got to the fags' room,' said Vaughan, pointing the  toasting-fork at the Babe by way of emphasis, 'there was the Mutual  standing in the middle of the room gassing away with an expression on  his face a cross between a village idiot and an unintelligent fried  egg. And all round him was a seething mass of fags, half of them  playing soccer with a top-hat and the other half cheering wildly  whenever the Mutual opened his mouth.'    'What did you do?'    'We made an aggressive movement in force. Collared the hat, brained  every fag within reach, and swore we'd report them to the beak and so  on. They quieted down in about three and a quarter seconds by  stopwatch, and we retired, taking the hat as a prize of war, and  followed by the Mutual Friend.'    'He looked worried, rather,' said Vaughan. 'And, thank goodness, he let  us alone for the rest of the evening.'    'That's only a sample, though,' explained Dallas. 'That sort of thing  has been going on the whole term. If the head of a House is an abject  lunatic, there's bound to be ructions. Fags simply live for the sake of  kicking up rows. It's meat and drink to them.'    'I wish the Mutual would leave,' said Vaughan. 'Only that sort of chap  always lingers on until he dies or gets sacked.'    'He's not the sort of fellow to get sacked, I should say,' said the  Babe.    ''Fraid not. I wish I could shunt into some other House. Between Ward  and the Mutual life here isn't worth living.'    'There's Merevale's, now,' said Vaughan. 'I wish I was in there. In the  first place you've got Merevale. He gets as near perfection as a beak  ever does. Coaches the House footer and cricket, and takes an  intelligent interest in things generally. Then there are some decent  fellows in Merevale's. Charteris, Welch, Graham, Thomson, heaps of  them.'    'Pity you came to Ward's,' said the Babe. 'Why did you?'    'My pater knew Ward a bit. If he'd known him well, he'd have sent me  somewhere else.'    'My pater knew Vaughan's pater well, who knew Ward slightly and there  you are. _Voila comme des accidents arrivent_.'    'If Ward wanted to lug in a day boy to be head of the House,' said  Vaughan, harping once more on the old string, 'he"]]]
