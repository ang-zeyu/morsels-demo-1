I may anticipate a little by saying that about a year  later a jury in Lee county, Illinois, awarded $40.00 damages and costs  against Wilson, a sheriff in the state of Illinois, and Reynolds, the  Missouri agent, for false imprisonment and abuse of the Prophet, a  verdict, which while it confirms the unlawful course of those officers,  and the fact that their prisoner was abused, insults justice by  awarding such an amount for damages.    At the time of the action by the municipal court of Nauvoo, ordering  the Prophet's release from arrest, it was a question in Illinois  whether said court had the authority to hear and determine writs of  _habeas corpus_ arising from arrests made by virtue of warrants issued  by the courts of the state or of the governor, as in the foregoing  case; or whether the clause in the city charter granting the right of  issuing writs of_ habeas corpus_ was not confined to cases arising  strictly from arrests made on account of the violation of some city  ordinance. The clause in the charter, giving to the municipal court the  power to issue writs of _habeas corpus_ was as follows:        {XXVI} The municipal court shall have power to grant writs of      _habeas corpus_ in all cases arising under the ordinances of the      city council.    And in addition there was the general welfare provision, which provided  that the        City council shall have power and authority to make, ordain,      establish and execute such ordinances not repugnant to the      constitution of the United States or of this state, as they may      deem necessary for the peace, benefit and safety of the inhabitants      of said city.    It was maintained on the part of those who believed that the municipal  court had the right to issue writs of _habeas corpus_ against process  issued from the state courts that all the power there was in Illinois  she gave to Nauvoo, and that the municipal court had all the power  within the limits of the city that the state courts had, and that  power was given by the same authority--the legislature. A number of  lawyers of more or less prominence in the state professed to hold  these views; but little reliance can be put in the support they bring  to the case, since all of them were seeking political preferment,  immediately or remotely, and would and did in their interpretation of  the powers granted by the charter, favor that side of the controversy  most likely to please the citizens of Nauvoo. Governor Ford, too, at  the time, gave a tacit approval of the course taken by the municipal  court in issuing the writ of _habeas corpus_, though he afterwards  became very pronounced in his opposition to the exercise of such  powers. His acquiescence appears in this, that as soon as Joseph was  liberated, sheriff Reynolds applied to Governor Ford for a _posse_  to retake him, representing that the Prophet had been unlawfully  taken out of his hands by the municipal court of Nauvoo: whereupon  the governor refused to grant the petition. Subsequently the governor  of Missouri asked Governor Ford to call out the militia to retake  Joseph, but this he also refused to do, and gave as a reason that  \"no process, officer, or authority of the state had been resisted or  interfered with;\" and recited how the prisoner had been released on  _habeas corpus_ by the municipal court of Nauvoo. The governor acted  in this instance with perfect knowledge of what had taken place, for  the petition and statement of Reynolds were in his possession, as  were also complete copies of all the documents which contained the  proceedings before the municipal court of Nauvoo; and in addition to  these sources of information, the governor had dispatched a trusted  secret agent, a Mr. Brayman, to Nauvoo, who investigated the case and  reported the result to him. It must be held, however, both as a matter  of fact and of law, that the grant in the Nauvoo city charter was  intended by the legislature only to give power to the municipal court  to issue writs of _habeas corpus_ in cases of arrest for violation  of city ordinances; and that giving {XXVII} power to the municipal  court to test the warrants or processes issued from the state courts  was never contemplated by the legislature, and that the passage of  any ordinance by the city council that would bring about or authorize  any such unusual proceeding was an unwarranted assumption of power,  utterly wrong in principle and consequently subversive of government.  But whatever opinion may be entertained on the legal point under  consideration, there can be no question but what upon the broad  principles of justice the Prophet Joseph ought to have been set free.  The state of Missouri had no just claims upon him. He had been arrested  and several times examined on these old charges now revived by the  personal malice of John C. Bennett, and after being held a prisoner  awaiting indictment and trial for five months in Missouri in the winter  of 1838-9, so conscious were the officers of the state that they had no  case against him, that they themselves connived at his escape. After  such proceedings to demand that he be dragged again into Missouri,  among his old enemies for a trial on these old and time-worn charges,  was an outrage against every principle of justice, and was a coarse  prompted solely by malice.    _Prospecting the West with a View to Removal of the Saints_.    It may be that what is here set down with reference to prospecting  the west with a view to the ultimate removal of the Saints, can reach  no higher from the data supplied by this volume than conjecture; but  taken in connection with the well-known projects of the last year of  the Prophet's life--upon which now our history, even in this volume,  has entered--and the facts to which attention is called appear quite  significant. These facts are: The Prophet's remarkable and well  attested prediction of 6th of August, 1843, that the Saints would yet  be driven to the Rocky mountains where they would become a great people  (p. 85 and note;) the several visits of delegations of Pottawattamie  Indian chiefs to the Prophet, the body of their people being then  settled on the Missouri river nearly due west some three hundred  miles from Nauvoo; the appointment of Elder Jonathan Dunham, a man  of character and judgment, to visit this tribe of Indians, under the  Pottawattamie guide Neotanah; and the incorporation of the journal of  Elder Dunham within the narrative of the Prophet's autobiographical  journal. The concluding paragraph of Dunham's journal expresses  disappointment with his explorations, [D] the object of which since  his journey covered something like six hundred miles, and was attended  by Indian guides both {XXVIII} coming and returning, was not \"bee  hunting;\" but most probably prospecting a possible trail and locating  resting places for the Saints when engaged in a great westward movement.    [Footnote D: \"I have seen much delightful country, but the prospect for  bee hunting is no as good as I could wish.\"]    _Development of the Prophet's Character_.    During the trying events of the fifteen months of which this volume  is a history, the nature of the Prophet underwent a remarkable  development. There never was, of course, any doubt as to the physical  courage of the Prophet. From boyhood he had been noted for his  fearlessness under trying circumstances, but during the period here  considered he was the constant object of assault, both by legal  processes, under the leadership of cunning, malicious men, and the  physical brutality of officials charged with the execution of the law;  and both when facing the maliciously skillful in their proceedings  under the color of law, and the threats of physical force from brutal  captors, the conduct of the Prophet was most admirable. Also in  seclusion, when others were easily excited and manifested symptoms  of panic under the circumstances of conflicting rumors of impending  dangers, it is refreshing to see how calmly the Prophet keeps his  balance and rightly judges the true status of many trying situations.  But what is most pleasing to record of this period of enforced  seclusion while avoiding his enemies, is the development of that  tenderness of soul manifested in his reflections upon the friends who  had stood by him from the commencement of his public career: for his  father and mother, for his brother Alvin, for Emma, his wife, for his  brother Hyrum, the Knights, who were his friends even before the Book  of Mormon was translated, and especially for the friends who received  him and ministered unto him during his retirement from public ministry.  No act of kindness seems to go unmentioned. No risk run for him that  is not appreciated. Indeed he gathers much benefit from those trials,  since their effect upon his nature seems to be a softening rather than  a hardening influence; and the trials of life are always beneficial  where they do not harden and brutalize men's souls; and every day under  his trials the Prophet seems to have grown more tender-hearted, more  universal in his sympathies; his moments of spiritual exaltation are  superb. No one can read them and doubt that the inspiration of God was  giving this man's spirit understanding.    _Doctrinal Development_.    The doctrinal development of the Church for the period covered by this  volume covers a wide range of subjects; the Prophet's definition of the  \"Kingdom of God,\" meaning in its narrowest as in its broadest sense,  the \"government of God,\" whether represented by a single individual,  {XXIX} an institution or a great and complex organization (p. 256); the  keys by which angelic administrations may be known (p. 267); the virtue  of Blood Atonement (p. 296); the physical nature of God, the Father,  the Son, and the Holy Spirit (p. 323, 325, 426); the earth becoming a  Urim and Thummim to those who shall "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60758"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 6 (#6)"],[1,"true that there were here  and there men in Hancock and surrounding counties of good education and  enlightened culture, such as Stephen A. Douglas, O. H. Browning, Major  Warren, John J. Hardin, General Minor R. Deming, Samuel Marshal, Judge  Jesse B. Thomas, Josiah Lamborn, Governor Ford and others.    _VIII. The Political Phase._    It has already been observed in these volumes (Vol. IV, Introduction)  that in addition to the Latter-day Saints being welcomed into Illinois  on account of their economic value in a newly and sparsely settled  country, as wealth creators through their industry, frugality and skill  in mechanics and husbandry, political parties of Illinois both Whigs  and Democrats vied with each other in heartiness of welcome, each  hoping the profit by the influx of the new population in both state  {XXIX} and national elections. Hence it was possible to obtain for  Nauvoo the exceptional powers that constituted her, under the letter  of her charter, an autonomy within the limits of her boundaries more  akin to a sovereign state than to a municipality within a state and a  county. And such were the powers claimed for her by her founders. [11]  Hence also that catering to the misconception and wrong interpretations  of the chartered powers of Nauvoo by lawyers and politicians seeking  professional and political favors of the people, which encouraged the  belief that the city government was the omnipotent political power  within the city limits; and that her municipal court was not only equal  to, but even superior to the state courts--\"for all other courts were  restricted,\" it was contended, while the municipal court of Nauvoo  was not restricted! Similar claims of absolutism were made respecting  Nauvoo misled by their legal and political advisers, who gave false  counsel instead of true, and who encouraged people in their prejudices  and flattered their vanity rather than corrected their errors by an  appeal to sound judgment and to the law.    _IX. Mischief Arising from False Legal and Political Counsel._    Much mischief arose from this source. It was because of these  misconceptions in respect of the character of their city government  that led to the enactment of those ill advised and unwarranted city  ordinances--    That made gold and silver alone legal tender within the city;    That declared Joseph Smith exempt from arrest on requisitions from  Missouri founded upon the old difficulties in that state, and providing  that persons making an attempt to arrest him might be taken with or  without process, imprisoned for life, and might not be pardoned by the  governor without consent of the mayor; [12]    That authorized the city council, marshal, constables and city watch  to require all strangers entering the city or already tarrying there  to give their names, former residence and for what intent they were  tarrying in the city, and answer such other questions as the officers  respectively deemed proper to ask; refusal to give the desired  information, or giving false names or information subjected them to the  same penalties as \"vagrants and disorderly persons;\"    That further authorized and required the above named officers to {XXX}  \"hail and take all persons found strolling about the city at night  after nine o'clock and before sunrise, and to confine them in ward for  trial under the ordinances concerning vagrants and disorderly persons,  unless they could give a good account of themselves for being out  after nine o'clock;\"    That further authorized and required the aforesaid officers to  enter all hotels or houses of public entertainment, and such other  habitations as they may judge proper, and require the inmates to  give immediate information of all persons residing in said hotel or  habitation, and their business, occupation or movements, under penalty  of forfeiture of license, if a public house, and they and the transient  persons subject to the penalties visited upon vagrants for failure  to give the information required, or giving false information; while  the officer who should \"refuse or neglect to perform the above duties  should be fined $100, and be broke of his office;\"    That forbade the search and seizure of person or property by foreign  process [_i. e._ other process than that issuing from the city's  authority] within the city of Nauvoo, leading to the widespread belief  that the design of said ordinance was \"to hinder the execution of the  statutes of Illinois\" within said city; [13]    That asked the general government to ratify the Nauvoo Charter, and  in addition constitute the city a territorial government, by granting  \"all rights, powers, privileges and immunities belonging to territories  and not repugnant to the constitution of the United States,\" with  power granted to the mayor to call to his aid a sufficient number  of the United States troops, in connection with the Nauvoo Legion,  to repel the invasion of mobs, keep the public peace, protect the  innocent from lawless banditti; the United States officers to obey the  requisition of this ordinance; and the Nauvoo Legion, when in service  quelling mobs and preserving the public peace, to be under the same  regulations, rules and laws of pay as the troops of the United States;  the territorial privileges to continue until the \"state of Missouri  restores to those exiled citizens [the Latter-day Saints] the lands,  rights, privileges, property, and damages for all losses\" they had  sustained by being banished from that commonwealth; [14]    And, finally, that asserted the right of the municipal court to arrest  {XXXI} process issued by the state's circuit courts, and even by the  United States courts, by _habeas corpus_ proceedings; and insisted,  not only upon the right to pass judgment upon the sufficiency of writs  under which arrests were made, but upon the right also to go behind the  writs and try the cases upon their merits.    _X. Subserviency of Politicians and Lawyers._    Blame for this political subserviency and misleading political and  legal advice, may not be charged on one party more than another. If  Cyrus Walker, a Whig candidate for congress, assented to the doctrine  as understood by Nauvoo's leading men, that the municipal court of  Nauvoo held the power under _habeas corpus_ procedure to arrest  execution of process of the state courts, as he did, [15] so, too,  did Joseph P. Hoge, Democratic nominee; and even Governor Ford, when  requested to call out the militia to rearrest Joseph Smith after he had  been liberated from the custody of Sheriff Reynolds, agent of Missouri,  under _habeas corpus_ proceedings, took refuge behind the _habeas  corpus_ proceedings of the Municipal Court at Nauvoo. In that case the  court not only inquired into the sufficiency of the writ of requisition  from Missouri, and granted by Governor Ford himself, but also went back  of the writ and tried the case _exparte_ on its merits, and finally  discharged the prisoner, both \"for want of substance in the warrant, *  * * as well as upon the merits of the case.\" [16] When answering the  request of Missouri to rearrest Joseph Smith, Governor Ford, I say, at  least took refuge behind the aforesaid proceedings of the Municipal  Court to the extent of saying, in the face of that procedure, that  \"no process, officer or authority of Illinois had been resisted or  interfered with,\" [17] and therefore refused to call out the militia to  rearrest President Smith.    It is but fair to Governor Ford, however, to say that in his inaugural  speech of December 8th, 1842, he pointed out what he regarded as  objectionable features in the Nauvoo charter, and recommended its  modification, [18] and later censured the lawyers for misleading the  Nauvoo city authorities in this matter, in the following passage from  a letter to the Mayor and City Council of Nauvoo, under date of June  22nd, 1844.        You have also assumed to yourselves more power than you are      entitled to in relation to_ habeas corpus_ under your charter. I      know that you have been told by lawyers, for the purpose of gaining      your favor, {XXXII} that you have this power to any extent. In this      they have deceived you for their own base purposes. Your charter      supposes that you may pass ordinances, a breach of which will      result in the imprisonment of the offender.        For the purpose of giving more speedy relief to such persons      authority was given to the Municipal Court to issue writs of      _habeas corpus_ in all cases arising under the ordinances of the      city.        It was never supposed by the Legislature, nor can the language of      your charter be tortured to mean that a jurisdiction was intended      to be conferred which would apply to all cases of imprisonment      under the general laws of the state or of the United States, as      well as the city ordinances.    To which President Smith replied:        Whatever power we have exercised in the _habeas corpus_ has been      done in accordance with the letter of the Charter and Constitution      as we confidently understood them; and that, too, with the ablest      counsel; but if it be so that we have erred in this thing, let the      Supreme Court correct the evil. We have never gone contrary to      constitutional law, so far as we have been able to learn it. If      lawyers have belied their profession to abuse us the evil be on      their heads. [19]    _XI. The Fate of a Balance of Power Factor in Politics._    Being misled by false legal and political advice was not the only  misfortune of the kind perpetrated upon the Saints, first by the  subserviency of, and then the betrayal by, politicians and lawyers.  The hope of both parties to secure political advantage by the influx  of the now Latter-day Saint population into the state has been already  referred to; as also the efforts of both parties to gain their favor by  granting exceptional"]]]
