What are you grinning at? They _would_.\"    \"I know it. Suppose you go for a walk. I want to look through my notes  about our story.\"    Now this reprehensible youth who left me, a little hurt and put back,  might for aught he or I knew have been one of the crew of the _Argo_--had  been certainly slave or comrade to Thorfin Karlsefne. Therefore he was  deeply interested in guinea competitions. Remembering what Grish Chunder  had said I laughed aloud. The Lords of Life and Death would never allow  Charlie Mears to speak with full knowledge of his pasts, and I must even  piece out what he had told me with my own poor inventions while Charlie  wrote of the ways of bank clerks.    I got together and placed on one file all my notes; and the net result was  not cheering. I read them a second time. There was nothing that might not  have been compiled at secondhand from other people's books--except,  perhaps, the story of the fight in the harbor. The adventures of a Viking  had been written many times before; the history of a Greek galley-slave  was no new thing, and though I wrote both, who could challenge or confirm  the accuracy of my details? I might as well tell a tale of two thousand  years hence. The Lords of Life and Death were as cunning as Grish Chunder  had hinted. They would allow nothing to escape that might trouble or make  easy the minds of men. Though I was convinced of this, yet I could not  leave the tale alone. Exaltation followed reaction, not once, but twenty  times in the next few weeks. My moods varied with the March sunlight and  flying clouds. By night or in the beauty of a spring morning I perceived  that I could write that tale and shift continents thereby. In the wet,  windy afternoons, I saw that the tale might indeed be written, but would  be nothing more than a faked, false-varnished, sham-rusted piece of  Wardour Street work at the end. Then I blessed Charlie in many  ways--though it was no fault of his. He seemed to be busy with prize  competitions, and I saw less and less of him as the weeks went by and the  earth cracked and grew ripe to spring, and the buds swelled in their  sheaths. He did not care to read or talk of what he had read, and there  was a new ring of self-assertion in his voice. I hardly cared to remind  him of the galley when we met; but Charlie alluded to it on every  occasion, always as a story from which money was to be made.    \"I think I deserve twenty-five per cent., don't I, at least,\" he said,  with beautiful frankness. \"I supplied all the ideas, didn't I?\"    This greediness for silver was a new side in his nature. I assumed that it  had been developed in the City, where Charlie was picking up the curious  nasal drawl of the underbred City man.    \"When the thing's done we'll talk about it. I can't make anything of it at  present. Red-haired or black-haired hero are equally difficult.\"    He was sitting by the fire staring at the red coals. \"I can't understand  what you find so difficult. It's all as clear as mud to me,\" he replied. A  jet of gas puffed out between the bars, took light and whistled softly.  \"Suppose we take the red-haired hero's adventures first, from the time  that he came south to my galley and captured it and sailed to the  Beaches.\"    I knew better now than to interrupt Charlie. I was out of reach of pen and  paper, and dared not move to get them lest I should break the current. The  gas-jet puffed and whinnied, Charlie's voice dropped almost to a whisper,  and he told a tale of the sailing of an open galley to Furdurstrandi, of  sunsets on the open sea, seen under the curve of the one sail evening  after evening when the galley's beak was notched into the centre of the  sinking disc, and \"we sailed by that for we had no other guide,\" quoth  Charlie. He spoke of a landing on an island and explorations in its woods,  where the crew killed three men whom they found asleep under the pines.  Their ghosts, Charlie said, followed the galley, swimming and choking in  the water, and the crew cast lots and threw one of their number overboard  as a sacrifice to the strange gods whom they had offended. Then they ate  sea-weed when their provisions failed, and their legs swelled, and their  leader, the red-haired man, killed two rowers who mutinied, and after a  year spent among the woods they set sail for their own country, and a wind  that never failed carried them back so safely that they all slept at  night. This, and much more Charlie told. Sometimes the voice fell so low  that I could not catch the words, though every nerve was on the strain, He  spoke of their leader, the red-haired man, as a pagan speaks of his God;  for it was he who cheered them and slew them impartially as he thought  best for their needs; and it was he who steered them for three days among  floating ice, each floe crowded with strange beasts that \"tried to sail  with us,\" said Charlie, \"and we beat them back with the handles of the  oars.\"    The gas-jet went out, a burned coal gave way, and the fire settled down  with a tiny crash to the bottom of the grate. Charlie ceased speaking, and  I said no word,    \"By Jove!\" he said, at last, shaking his head. \"I've been staring at the  fire till I'm dizzy. What was I going to say?\"    \"Something about the galley.\"    \"I remember now. It's 25 per cent. of the profits, isn't it?\"    \"It's anything you like when I've done the tale.\"    \"I wanted to be sure of that. I must go now. I've--I've an appointment.\"  And he left me.    Had my eyes not been held I might have known that that broken muttering  over the fire was the swan-song of Charlie Mears. But I thought it the  prelude to fuller revelation. At last and at last I should cheat the Lords  of Life and Death!    When next Charlie came to me I received him with rapture. He was nervous  and embarrassed, but his eyes were very full of light, and his lips a  little parted.    \"I've done a poem,\" he said; and then, quickly: \"it's the best I've ever  done. Read it.\" He thrust it into my hand and retreated to the window.    I groaned inwardly. It would be the work of half an hour to  criticise--that is to say praise--the poem sufficiently to please Charlie.  Then I had good reason to groan, for Charlie, discarding his favorite  centipede metres, had launched into shorter and choppier verse, and verse  with a motive at the back of it. This is what I read:      \"The day Is most fair, the cheery wind       Halloos behind the hill,     Where he bends the wood as seemeth good,       And the sapling to his will!     Riot O wind; there is that in my blood       That would not have thee still!      \"She gave me herself, O Earth, O Sky;       Grey sea, she is mine alone!     Let the sullen boulders hear my cry,       And rejoice tho' they be but stone!      \"Mine! I have won her O good brown earth,       Make merry! 'Tis hard on Spring;     Make merry; my love is doubly worth       All worship your fields can bring!     Let the hind that tills you feel my mirth       At the early harrowing,\"    \"Yes, it's the early harrowing, past a doubt,\" I said, with a dread at my  heart, Charlie smiled, but did not answer.      \"Red cloud of the sunset, tell it abroad;       I am victor. Greet me O Sun,     Dominant master and absolute lord       Over the soul of one!\"    \"Well?\" said Charlie, looking over my shoulder.    I thought it far from well, and very evil indeed, when he silently laid a  photograph on the paper--the photograph of a girl with a curly head, and a  foolish slack mouth.    \"Isn't it--isn't it wonderful?\" he whispered, pink to the tips of his  ears, wrapped in the rosy mystery of first love. \"I didn't know; I didn't  think--it came like a thunderclap.\"    \"Yes. It comes like a thunderclap. Are you very happy, Charlie?\"    \"My God--she--she loves me!\" He sat down repeating the last words to  himself. I looked at the hairless face, the narrow shoulders already bowed  by desk-work, and wondered when, where, and how he had loved in his past  lives.    \"What will your mother say?\" I asked, cheerfully.    \"I don't care a damn what she says.\"    At twenty the things for which one does not care a damn should, properly,  be many, but one must not include mothers in the list. I told him this  gently; and he described Her, even as Adam must have described to the  newly named beasts the glory and tenderness and beauty of Eve.  Incidentally I learned that She was a tobacconist's assistant with a  weakness for pretty dress, and had told him four or five times already  that She had never been kissed by a man before.    Charlie spoke on and on, and on; while I, separated from him by thousands  of years, was considering the beginnings of things. Now I understood why  the Lords of Life and Death shut the doors so carefully behind us. It is  that we may not remember our first wooings. Were it not so, our world  would be without inhabitants in a hundred years.    \"Now, about that galley-story,\" I said, still more cheerfully, in a pause  in the rush of the speech.    Charlie looked up as though he had been hit. \"The galley--what galley?  Good heavens, don't joke, man! This is serious! You don't know how serious  it is!\"    Grish Chunder was right, Charlie had tasted the love of woman that kills  remembrance, and the finest story in the world would never be written.        WITH THE MAIN GUARD       Der "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8659"],[0,"Sabbath in Puritan New England (#6)"],[1,"  these triple-tiered foot-benches played an important part. When he was  a boy a travelling show visited his native town, and though he was not  permitted to go within the mystic and alluring tent, he stood longingly at  the gate, and was prodigiously diverted and astonished by an exhibition of  tight-rope walking, which was given outside the tent-door as a bait to  lure pleasure-loving and frivolous townspeople within, and also as a  tantalization to the children of the saints who were not allowed to enter  the tent of the wicked. Fired by that bewildering and amazing performance,  he daily, after the wonderful sight, practised walking on rails, on fences,  on fallen trees, and on every narrow foothold which he could find, as a  careful preparation for a final feat and triumph of skill on his mother's  clothes-line. In an evil hour, as he sat one Sunday in the corner of his  father's pew, his eyes rested on the narrow ledge which formed the top of  the long foot-bench. Satan can find mischief for idle boys within church as  well as without, and the desire grew stronger to try to walk on that  narrow foothold. He looked at his father and mother, they were peacefully  sleeping; so also were the grown-up occupants of the neighboring pews;  the pew walls were high, the minister seldom glanced to right or left; a  thousand good reasons were whispered in his ear by the mischief-finder,  and at last he willingly yielded, pulled off his heavy shoes, and softly  mounted the foot-bench. He walked forward and back with great success  twice, thrice, but when turning for a fourth tour he suddenly lost his  balance, and over he went with a resounding crash--hats, psalm-books,  heavy bench, and all. He crushed into hopeless shapelessness his father's  gray beaver meeting-hat, a long-treasured and much-loved antique; he nearly  smashed his mother's kid-slippered foot to jelly, and the fall elicited  from her, in the surprise of the sudden awakening and intense pain, an  ear-piercing shriek, which, with the noisy crash, electrified the entire  meeting. All the grown people stood up to investigate, the children climbed  on the seats to look at the guilty offender and his deeply mortified  parents; while the minister paused in his sermon and said with cutting  severity, \"I have always regretted that the office of tithingman has been  abolished in this community, as his presence and his watchful care  are sadly needed by both the grown persons and the children in this  congregation.\" The wretched boy who had caused all the commotion and  disgrace was of course uninjured by his fall, but a final settlement at  home between father and son on account of this sacrilegious piece of church  disturbance made the unhappy would-be tight-rope walker wish that he had at  least broken his arm instead of his father's hat and his mother's pride and  the peace of the congregation.    The seats were sometimes on four sides of these pews, but oftener on three  sides only, thus at least two thirds of the pew occupants did not face the  minister. The pew-seats were as narrow and uncomfortable as the plebeian  benches, though more exclusive, and, with the high partition walls, quite  justified the comment of a little girl when she first attended a service in  one of these old-fashioned, square-pewed churches. She exclaimed in dismay,  \"What! must I be shut up in a closet and sit on a shelf?\" Often elderly  people petitioned to build separate small pens of pews with a single wider  seat as \"through the seats being so very narrow\" they could not sit in  comfort.    The seats were, until well into this century, almost universally hung on  hinges, and could be turned up against the walls of the pew, thus enabling  the standing congregation to lean for support against the sides of the pews  during the psalm-singing and the long, long prayers.      \"And when at last the loud Amen    Fell from aloft, how quickly then    The seats came down with heavy rattle,    Like musketry in fiercest battle.\"    This noise of slamming pew-seats could easily be heard over half a mile  away from the meeting-house in the summer time, for the perverse boys  contrived always in their salute of welcome to the Amen to give vent in  a most tremendous bang to a little of their pent up and ill-repressed  energies. In old church-orders such entries as this (of the Haverhill  church) are frequently seen: \"The people are to Let their Seats down  without Such Nois.\" \"The boyes are not to wickedly noise down there  pew-seats.\" A gentleman attending the old church in Leicester heard at  the beginning of the prayer, for the first time in his life, the noise of  slamming pew-seats, as the seats were thrust up against the pew-walls. He  jumped into the aisle at the first clatter, thinking instinctively that the  gallery was cracking and falling. Another stranger, a Southerner, entering  rather late at a morning service in an old church in New England, was  greeted with the rattle of falling seats, and exclaimed in amazement, \"Do  you Northern people applaud in church?\"    In many meeting-houses the tops of the pews and of the high gallery  railings were ornamented with little balustrades of turned wood, which were  often worn quite bare of paint by childish fingers that had tried them all  \"to find which ones would turn,\" and which, alas! would also squeak. This  fascinating occupation whiled away many a tedious hour in the dreary  church, and in spite of weekly forbidding frowns and whispered reproofs for  the shrill, ear-piercing squeaks elicited by turning the spindle-shaped  balusters, was entirely too alluring a time-killer to be abandoned, and  consequently descended, an hereditary church pastime, from generation to  generation of the children of the Puritans; and indeed it remained so  strong an instinct that many a grown person, visiting in after life a  church whose pews bore balustrades like the ones of his childhood, could  scarce keep his itching fingers from trying them each in succession \"to see  which ones would turn.\"    These open balustrades also afforded fine peep-holes through which, by  standing or kneeling upon \"the shelf,\" a child might gaze at his neighbor;  and also through which sly missiles--little balls of twisted paper--could  be snapped, to the annoyance of some meek girl or retaliating boy, until  the young marksman was ignominiously pulled down by his mother from his  post of attack. And through these balustrades the same boy a few years  later could thrust sly missives, also of twisted paper, to the girl whom he  had once assailed and bombarded with his annoying paper bullets.    Through the pillared top-rail a restless child in olden days often  received, on a hot summer Sabbath from a farmer's wife or daughter in an  adjoining pew, friendly and quieting gifts of sprigs of dill, or fennel,  or caraway, famous anti-soporifics; and on this herbivorous food he would  contentedly browse as long as it lasted. An uneasy, sermon-tired little  girl was once given through the pew-rail several stalks of caraway, and  with them a large bunch of aromatic southernwood, or \"lad's-love\" which had  been brought to meeting by the matron in the next pew, with a crudely and  unconsciously aesthetic sense that where eye and ear found so little to  delight them, there the pungent and spicy fragrance of the southernwood  would be doubly grateful to the nostrils. Little Missy sat down delightedly  to nibble the caraway-seed, and her mother seeing her so quietly and  absorbingly occupied, at once fell contentedly and placidly asleep in her  corner of the pew. But five heads of caraway, though each contain many  score of seeds, and the whole number be slowly nibbled and eaten one seed  at a time, will not last through the child's eternity of a long doctrinal  sermon; and when the umbels were all devoured, the young experimentalist  began upon the stalks and stems, and they, too, slowly disappeared. She  then attacked the sprays of southernwood, and in spite of its bitter,  wormwoody flavor, having nothing else to do, she finished it, all but the  tough stems, just as the long sermon was brought to a close. Her waking  mother, discovering no signs of green verdure in the pew, quickly drew  forth a whispered confession of the time-killing Nebuchadnezzar-like feast,  and frightened and horrified, at once bore the leaf-gorged child from  the church, signalling in her retreat to the village doctor, who quickly  followed and administered to the omnivorous young New Englander a bolus  which made her loathe to her dying day, through a sympathetic association  and memory, the taste of caraway, and the scent of southernwood.    An old gentleman, lamenting the razing of the church of his childhood,  told the story of his youthful Sabbaths in rhyme, and thus refers with  affectionate enthusiasm to the old custom of bringing bunches of esculent  \"sallet\" herbs to meeting:--      \"And when I tired and restless grew,    Our next pew neighbor, Mrs. True,    Reached her kind hand the top rail through    To hand me dill, and fennel too,    And sprigs of caraway.      \"And as I munched the spicy seeds,    I dimly felt that kindly deeds    That thus supply our present needs,    Though only gifts of pungent weeds,    Show true religion.      \"And often now through sermon trite    And operatic singer's flight,    I long for that old friendly sight,    The hand with herbs of value light,    To help to pass the time.\"    Were the dill and \"sweetest fennel\" chosen Sabbath favorites for their  old-time virtues and powers?      \"Vervain and dill    Hinder witches of their ill.\"    And of the charmed fennel Longfellow wrote:--      \"The fennel with its yellow flowers    That, in an earlier age than ours,    Was gifted with the wondrous powers,        Lost vision to restore.\"    And traditions of mysterious powers, dream-influencing, spirit-exorcising,  virtue-awakening, health-giving properties, hung"]]]
