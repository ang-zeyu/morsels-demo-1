And that, Colonel Macon, is  the pleasant accident which brings you the favor of this call.\"    It would have been a speech both stupid and pert in the mouth of  another; but Donnegan knew how to flavor words with a touch of mockery  of himself as well as another. There were two manners in which this  speech could have been received--with a wink or with a smile. But it  would have been impossible to hear it and grow frigid. As for the  colonel, he smiled.    It was a tricky smile, however, as Donnegan felt. It spread easily upon  that vast face and again went out and left all to the dominion of the  cold, bright eyes.    \"A case of curiosity,\" commented the colonel.    \"A case of hunger,\" said Donnegan.    \"My dear Mr. Donnegan, put it that way if you wish!\"    \"And a case of blankets needed for one night.\"    \"Really? Have you ventured into such a country as this without any  equipment?\"    \"Outside of my purse, my equipment is of the invisible kind.\"    \"Wits,\" suggested the colonel.    \"Thank you.\"    \"Not at all. You hinted at it yourself.\"    \"However, a hint is harder to take than to make.\"    The colonel raised his faultless right hand--and oddly enough his great  corpulence did not extend in the slightest degree to his hand, but  stopped short at the wrists--and stroked his immense chin. His skin was  like Lou Macon's, except that in place of the white-flower bloom his was  a parchment, dead pallor. He lowered his hand with the same slow  precision and folded it with the other, all the time probing Donnegan  with his difficult eyes.    \"Unfortunately--most unfortunately, it is impossible for me to  accommodate you, Mr. Donnegan.\"    The reply was not flippant, but quick. \"Not at all. I am the easiest  person in the world to accommodate.\"    The big man smiled sadly.    \"My fortune has fallen upon evil days, sir. It is no longer what it was.  There are in this house three habitable rooms; this one; my daughter's  apartment; the kitchen where old Haggie sleeps. Otherwise you are in a  rat trap of a place.\"    He shook his head, a slow, decisive motion.    \"A spare blanket,\" said Donnegan, \"will be enough.\"    There was another sigh and another shake of the head.    \"Even a corner of a rug to roll up in will do perfectly.\"    \"You see, it is impossible for me to entertain you.\"    \"Bare boards will do well enough for me, Colonel Macon. And if I have a  piece of bread, a plate of cold beans--anything--I can entertain  myself.\"    \"I am sorry to see you so compliant, Mr. Donnegan, because that makes my  refusal seem the more unkind. But I cannot have you sleeping on the bare  floor. Not on such a night. Pneumonia comes on one like a cat in the  dark in such weather. It is really impossible to keep you here, sir.\"    \"H'm-m,\" said Donnegan. He began to feel that he was stumped, and it was  a most unusual feeling for him.    \"Besides, for a young fellow like you, with your agility, what is eight  miles? Walk down the road and you will come to a place where you will be  made at home and fed like a king.\"    \"Eight miles, that's not much! But on such a night as this?\"    There was a faint glint in the eyes of the colonel; was he not  sharpening his wits for his contest of words, and enjoying it?    \"The wind will be at your back and buoy your steps. It will shorten the  eight miles to four.\"    Very definitely Donnegan felt that the other was reading him. What was  it that he saw as he turned the pages?    \"There is one thing you fail to take into your accounting.\"    \"Ah?\"    \"I have an irresistible aversion to walking.\"    \"Ah?\" repeated Macon.    \"Or exercise in any form.\"    \"Then you are unfortunate to be in this country without a horse.\"    \"Unfortunate, perhaps, but the fact is that I'm here. Very sorry to  trouble you, though, colonel.\"    \"I am rarely troubled,\" said the colonel coldly. \"And since I have no  means of accommodation, the laws of hospitality rest light on my  shoulders.\"    \"Yet I have an odd thought,\" replied Donnegan.    \"Well? You have expressed a number already, it seems to me.\"    \"It's this: that you've already made up your mind to keep me here.\"          8      The colonel stiffened in his chair, and under his bulk even those  ponderous timbers quaked a little. Once more Donnegan gained an  impression of chained activity ready to rise to any emergency. The  colonel's jaw set and the last vestige of the smile left his eyes. Yet  it was not anger that showed in its place. Instead, it was rather a  hungry searching. He looked keenly into the face and the soul of  Donnegan as a searchlight sweeps over waters by night.    \"You are a mind reader, Mr. Donnegan.\"    \"No more of a mind reader than a Chinaman is.\"    \"Ah, they are great readers of mind, my friend.\"    Donnegan grinned, and at this the colonel frowned.    \"A great and mysterious people, sir. I keep evidences of them always  about me. Look!\"    He swept the shaft of the reading light up and it fell upon a red vase  against the yellow hangings. Even Donnegan's inexperienced eye read a  price into that shimmering vase.    \"Queer color,\" he said.    \"Dusty claret. Ah, they have the only names for their colors. Think!  Peach bloom--liquid dawn--ripe cherry--oil green--green of powdered  tea--blue of the sky after rain--what names for color! What other land  possesses such a tongue that goes straight to the heart!\"    The colonel waved his faultless hands and then dropped them back upon  the book with the tenderness of a benediction.    \"And their terms for texture--pear's rind--lime peel--millet seed! Do  not scoff at China, Mr. Donnegan. She is the fairy godmother, and we are  the poor children.\"    He changed the direction of the light; Donnegan watched him, fascinated.    \"But what convinced you that I wished to keep you here?\"    \"To amuse you, Colonel Macon.\"    The colonel exposed gleaming white teeth and laughed in that soft,  smooth-flowing voice.    \"Amuse me? For fifteen years I have sat in this room and amused myself  by taking in what I would and shutting out the rest of the world. I have  made the walls thick and padded them to keep out all sound. You observe  that there is no evidence here of the storm that is going on tonight.  Amuse me? Indeed!\"    And Donnegan thought of Lou Macon in her old, drab dress, huddling the  poor cloak around her shoulders to keep out the cold, while her father  lounged here in luxury. He could gladly have buried his lean fingers in  that fat throat. From the first he had had an aversion to this man.    \"Very well, I shall go. It has been a pleasant chat, colonel.\"    \"Very pleasant. And thank you. But before you go, taste this whisky. It  will help you when you enter the wind.\"    He opened a cabinet in the side of the chair and brought out a black  bottle and a pair of glasses and put them on the broad arm of the chair.  Donnegan sauntered back.    \"You see,\" he murmured, \"you will not let me go.\"    At this the colonel raised his head suddenly and glared into the eyes of  his guest, and yet so perfect was his muscular and nerve control that he  did not interrupt the thin stream of amber which trickled into one of  the glasses. Looking down again, he finished pouring the drinks. They  pledged each other with a motion, and drank. It was very old, very oily.  And Donnegan smiled as he put down the empty glass.    \"Sit down,\" said the colonel in a new voice.    Donnegan obeyed.    \"Fate,\" went on the colonel, \"rules our lives. We give our honest  endeavors, but the deciding touch is the hand of Fate.\"    He garnished this absurd truism with a wave of his hand so solemn that  Donnegan was chilled; as though the fat man were actually conversant  with the Three Sisters.    \"Fate has brought you to me; therefore, I intend to keep you.\"    \"Here?\"    \"In my service. I am about to place a great mission and a great trust in  your hands.\"    \"In the hands of a man you know nothing about?\"    \"I know you as if I had raised you.\"    Donnegan smiled, and shaking his head, the red hair flashed and  shimmered.    \"As long as there is no work attached to the mission, it may be  agreeable to me.\"    \"But there is work.\"    \"Then the contract is broken before it is made.\"    \"You are rash. But I had rather begin with a dissent and then work  upward.\"    Donnegan waited.    \"To balance against work--\"    \"Excuse me. Nothing balances against work for me.\"    \"To balance against work,\" continued the colonel, raising a white hand  and by that gesture crushing the protest of Donnegan, \"there is a great  reward.\"    \"Colonel Macon, I have never worked for money before and I shall not  work for it now.\"    \"You trouble me with interruptions. Who mentioned money? You shall not  have a penny!\"    \"No?\"    \"The reward shall grow out of the work.\"    \"And the work?\"    \"Is fighting.\"    At this Donnegan narrowed his eyes and searched the fat man thoroughly.  It sounded like the talk of a charlatan, and yet there was a crispness  to these sentences that made him suspect something underneath. For that  matter, in certain districts his name and his career were known. He had  never dreamed that that reputation could have come within a thousand  miles of this part of the mountain desert.    \"You should have told me in the first place,\" he said with some anger,  \"that you knew me.\"    \"Mr. Donnegan, upon my honor, I never heard your name before my daughter  uttered it.\"    Donnegan waited soberly.    \"I despise charlatanry as much as the next man. You shall see the steps  by which I judged you. When you entered the room I threw a strong light  upon you. You did not blanch; you immediately walked straight into the  shaft of light although you could not see a foot before you.\"    \"And that proved?\"    \"A combative instinct, and coolness; not the sort of brute  vindictiveness that fights for a rage, for a cool-minded love of  conflict. Is that clear?\"    Donnegan shrugged his shoulders.    \"And"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1007"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Paradise (#7)"],[1," So multiplied in thee, it leads thee up  Along this ladder, down whose hallow'd steps  None e'er descend, and mount them not again,  Who from his phial should refuse thee wine  To slake thy thirst, no less constrained were,  Than water flowing not unto the sea.  Thou fain wouldst hear, what plants are these, that bloom  In the bright garland, which, admiring, girds  This fair dame round, who strengthens thee for heav'n.  I then was of the lambs, that Dominic  Leads, for his saintly flock, along the way,  Where well they thrive, not sworn with vanity.  He, nearest on my right hand, brother was,  And master to me: Albert of Cologne  Is this: and of Aquinum, Thomas I.  If thou of all the rest wouldst be assur'd,  Let thine eye, waiting on the words I speak,  In circuit journey round the blessed wreath.  That next resplendence issues from the smile  Of Gratian, who to either forum lent  Such help, as favour wins in Paradise.  The other, nearest, who adorns our quire,  Was Peter, he that with the widow gave  To holy church his treasure.  The fifth light,  Goodliest of all, is by such love inspired,  That all your world craves tidings of its doom:  Within, there is the lofty light, endow'd  With sapience so profound, if truth be truth,  That with a ken of such wide amplitude  No second hath arisen.  Next behold  That taper's radiance, to whose view was shown,  Clearliest, the nature and the ministry  Angelical, while yet in flesh it dwelt.  In the other little light serenely smiles  That pleader for the Christian temples, he  Who did provide Augustin of his lore.  Now, if thy mind's eye pass from light to light,  Upon my praises following, of the eighth  Thy thirst is next.  The saintly soul, that shows  The world's deceitfulness, to all who hear him,  Is, with the sight of all the good, that is,  Blest there.  The limbs, whence it was driven, lie  Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom  And exile came it here.  Lo! further on,  Where flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore,  Of Bede, and Richard, more than man, erewhile,  In deep discernment.  Lastly this, from whom  Thy look on me reverteth, was the beam  Of one, whose spirit, on high musings bent,  Rebuk'd the ling'ring tardiness of death.  It is the eternal light of Sigebert,  Who 'scap'd not envy, when of truth he argued,  Reading in the straw-litter'd street.\"  Forthwith,  As clock, that calleth up the spouse of God  To win her bridegroom's love at matin's hour,  Each part of other fitly drawn and urg'd,  Sends out a tinkling sound, of note so sweet,  Affection springs in well-disposed breast;  Thus saw I move the glorious wheel, thus heard  Voice answ'ring voice, so musical and soft,  It can be known but where day endless shines.          CANTO XI    O fond anxiety of mortal men!  How vain and inconclusive arguments  Are those, which make thee beat thy wings below  For statues one, and one for aphorisms  Was hunting; this the priesthood follow'd, that  By force or sophistry aspir'd to rule;  To rob another, and another sought  By civil business wealth; one moiling lay  Tangled in net of sensual delight,  And one to witless indolence resign'd;  What time from all these empty things escap'd,  With Beatrice, I thus gloriously  Was rais'd aloft, and made the guest of heav'n.    They of the circle to that point, each one.  Where erst it was, had turn'd; and steady glow'd,  As candle in his socket.  Then within  The lustre, that erewhile bespake me, smiling  With merer gladness, heard I thus begin:    \"E'en as his beam illumes me, so I look  Into the eternal light, and clearly mark  Thy thoughts, from whence they rise.  Thou art in doubt,  And wouldst, that I should bolt my words afresh  In such plain open phrase, as may be smooth  To thy perception, where I told thee late  That 'well they thrive;' and that 'no second such  Hath risen,' which no small distinction needs.    \"The providence, that governeth the world,  In depth of counsel by created ken  Unfathomable, to the end that she,  Who with loud cries was 'spous'd in precious blood,  Might keep her footing towards her well-belov'd,  Safe in herself and constant unto him,  Hath two ordain'd, who should on either hand  In chief escort her: one seraphic all  In fervency; for wisdom upon earth,  The other splendour of cherubic light.  I but of one will tell: he tells of both,  Who one commendeth which of them so'er  Be taken: for their deeds were to one end.    \"Between Tupino, and the wave, that falls  From blest Ubaldo's chosen hill, there hangs  Rich slope of mountain high, whence heat and cold  Are wafted through Perugia's eastern gate:  And Norcera with Gualdo, in its rear  Mourn for their heavy yoke.  Upon that side,  Where it doth break its steepness most, arose  A sun upon the world, as duly this  From Ganges doth: therefore let none, who speak  Of that place, say Ascesi; for its name  Were lamely so deliver'd; but the East,  To call things rightly, be it henceforth styl'd.  He was not yet much distant from his rising,  When his good influence 'gan to bless the earth.  A dame to whom none openeth pleasure's gate  More than to death, was, 'gainst his father's will,  His stripling choice: and he did make her his,  Before the Spiritual court, by nuptial bonds,  And in his father's sight: from day to day,  Then lov'd her more devoutly.  She, bereav'd  Of her first husband, slighted and obscure,  Thousand and hundred years and more, remain'd  Without a single suitor, till he came.  Nor aught avail'd, that, with Amyclas, she  Was found unmov'd at rumour of his voice,  Who shook the world: nor aught her constant boldness  Whereby with Christ she mounted on the cross,  When Mary stay'd beneath.  But not to deal  Thus closely with thee longer, take at large  The rovers' titles--Poverty and Francis.  Their concord and glad looks, wonder and love,  And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts,  So much, that venerable Bernard first  Did bare his feet, and, in pursuit of peace  So heavenly, ran, yet deem'd his footing slow.  O hidden riches!  O prolific good!  Egidius bares him next, and next Sylvester,  And follow both the bridegroom; so the bride  Can please them.  Thenceforth goes he on his way,  The father and the master, with his spouse,  And with that family, whom now the cord  Girt humbly: nor did abjectness of heart  Weigh down his eyelids, for that he was son  Of Pietro Bernardone, and by men  In wond'rous sort despis'd.  But royally  His hard intention he to Innocent  Set forth, and from him first receiv'd the seal  On his religion.  Then, when numerous flock'd  The tribe of lowly ones, that trac'd HIS steps,  Whose marvellous life deservedly were sung  In heights empyreal, through Honorius' hand  A second crown, to deck their Guardian's virtues,  Was by the eternal Spirit inwreath'd: and when  He had, through thirst of martyrdom, stood up  In the proud Soldan's presence, and there preach'd  Christ and his followers; but found the race  Unripen'd for conversion: back once more  He hasted (not to intermit his toil),  And reap'd Ausonian lands.  On the hard rock,  'Twixt Arno and the Tyber, he from Christ  Took the last Signet, which his limbs two years  Did carry.  Then the season come, that he,  Who to such good had destin'd him, was pleas'd  T' advance him to the meed, which he had earn'd  By his self-humbling, to his brotherhood,  As their just heritage, he gave in charge  His dearest lady, and enjoin'd their love  And faith to her: and, from her bosom, will'd  His goodly spirit should move forth, returning  To its appointed kingdom, nor would have  His body laid upon another bier.    \"Think now of one, who were a fit colleague,  To keep the bark of Peter in deep sea  Helm'd to right point; and such our Patriarch was.  Therefore who follow him, as he enjoins,  Thou mayst be certain, take good lading in.  But hunger of new viands tempts his flock,  So that they needs into strange pastures wide  Must spread them: and the more remote from him  The stragglers wander, so much mole they come  Home to the sheep-fold, destitute of milk.  There are of them, in truth, who fear their harm,  And to the shepherd cleave; but these so few,  A little stuff may furnish out their cloaks.    \"Now, if my words be clear, if thou have ta'en  Good heed, if that, which I have told, recall  To mind, thy wish may be in part fulfill'd:  For thou wilt see the point from whence they split,  Nor miss of the reproof, which that implies,  'That well they thrive not sworn with vanity.\"'          CANTO XII    Soon as its final word the blessed flame  Had rais'd for utterance, straight the holy mill  Began to wheel, nor yet had once revolv'd,  Or ere another, circling, compass'd it,  Motion to motion, song to song, conjoining,  Song, that as much our muses doth excel,  Our Sirens with their tuneful pipes, as ray  Of primal splendour doth its faint reflex.    As when, if Juno bid her handmaid forth,  Two arches parallel, and trick'd alike,  Span the thin cloud, the outer taking birth  From that within (in manner of that voice  Whom love did melt away, as sun the mist),  And they who gaze, presageful call to mind  The compact, made with Noah, of the world  No more to be o'erflow'd; about us thus  Of sempiternal roses, bending, wreath'd  Those garlands twain, and to the innermost  E'en thus th' external answered.  When the footing,  And other great festivity, of song,  And radiance, light with light accordant, each  Jocund and blythe, had at their pleasure still'd  (E'en as the eyes by quick volition mov'd,  Are shut and rais'd together), from the heart  Of one amongst the new lights mov'd a voice,  That made me seem like needle to the star,  In turning to its whereabout, and thus  Began: \"The love, that makes me beautiful,  Prompts me to tell of th' other guide, for whom  Such good of mine is spoken.  Where one is,  The other worthily should also be;  That as their warfare was alike, alike  Should be their glory.  Slow, and full of doubt,  And "]]]
