He had  met in Europe, as he said in a farewell speech, men quite as white as  he had ever seen in the United States and of quite as noble exterior,  and had seen in their faces no scorn of his complexion. He had  travelled over the four kingdoms, and had encountered no sign of  disrespect. He had been lionized in London, had spoken every night of  his last month there, and had declined as many more invitations. He had  shaken hands with the venerable Clarkson, and had breakfasted with the  philosopher Combe, the author of _The Constitution of Man_. He had won  the friendship of John Bright, had broken bread with Sir John Bowring,  had been introduced to Lord Brougham, the brilliant leader of the  Liberal party, and had listened to his wonderful eloquence. He had met  Douglas Jerrold, the famous wit, and had been entertained by the poet  William Howitt, who made a farewell speech in his honor. Everywhere he  had denounced slavery, everywhere hospitable doors had opened wide to  receive him, everywhere he had made friends for himself and his cause.  A slave and an outcast at home, he had been made to feel himself a  gentleman, had been the companion of great men and good women. Urged  to remain in this land of freedom, and offered aid to establish  himself in life there, his heart bled for his less fortunate brethren  in captivity; and, with the God-speed of his English friends ringing  in his ears, he went back to America,--to scorn, to obloquy, to  ostracism, but after all to the work to which he had been ordained,  and which he was so well qualified to perform.          VII.      Douglass landed April 20, 1847. He returned to the United States  with the intention of publishing the newspaper for which his English  friends had so kindly furnished the means; but his plan meeting with  opposition from his abolitionist friends, who thought the platform  offered him a better field for usefulness, he deferred the enterprise  until near the end of the year. In the mean time he plunged again into  the thick of the anti-slavery agitation. We find him lecturing in  May in the Broadway Tabernacle, New York, and writing letters to the  anti-slavery papers. In June he was elected president of the New  England Anti-slavery Convention. In August and September he went on a  lecturing tour with Garrison and others through Pennsylvania and Ohio.  On this tour the party attended the commencement exercises of Oberlin  College, famous for its anti-slavery principles and practice, and  spoke to immense meetings at various places in Ohio and New York.  Their cause was growing in popular favor; and, in places where  formerly they had spoken out of doors because of the difficulty of  securing a place of meeting, they were now compelled to speak in the  open air, because the churches and halls would not contain their  audiences.    On December 3, 1847, the first number of the _North Star_ appeared.  Douglass's abolitionist friends had not yet become reconciled to this  project, and his persistence in it resulted in a temporary coldness  between them. They very naturally expected him to be guided by their  advice. They had found him on the wharf at New Bedford, and given him  his chance in life; and they may easily be pardoned for finding it  presumptuous in him to disregard their advice and adopt a new line of  conduct without consulting them. Mr. Garrison wrote in a letter to his  wife from Cleveland, \"It will also greatly surprise our friends in  Boston to hear that in regard to his prospect of establishing a paper  here, to be called the North Star, he never opened his lips to me  on the subject nor asked my advice in any particular whatever.\" But  Samuel May Jr., in a letter written to one of Douglass's English  friends, in which he mentions this charge of Garrison, adds, \"It is  only common justice to Frederick Douglass to inform you that this is a  mistake; that, on the contrary, he did speak to Mr. Garrison about it,  just before he was taken ill at Cleveland.\" The probability is that  Douglass had his mind made up, and did not seek advice, and that Mr.  Garrison did not attach much importance to any casual remark Douglass  may have made upon the subject. In a foot-note to the _Life and Times  of Garrison_ it is stated:--    \"This enterprise was not regarded with favor by the leading  abolitionists, who knew only too well the precarious support which a  fifth anti-slavery paper, edited by a colored man, must have, and who  appreciated to the full Douglass's unrivalled powers as a lecturer  in the field ... As anticipated, it nearly proved the ruin of its  projector; but by extraordinary exertions it was kept alive, not,  however, on the platform of Garrisonian abolitionism. The necessary  support could only be secured by a change of principles in accordance  with Mr. Douglass's immediate (political abolition) environment.\"    Douglass's own statement does not differ very widely from this,  except that he does not admit the mercenary motive for his change  of principles. It was in deference, however, to the feelings of his  former associates that the _North Star_ was established at Rochester  instead of in the East, where the field for anti-slavery papers was  already fully occupied. In Rochester, then as now the centre of a  thrifty, liberal, and progressive population, Douglass gradually won  the sympathy and support which such an enterprise demanded.    The _North Star_, in size, typography, and interest, compared  favorably with the other weeklies of the day, and lived for seventeen  years. It had, however, its \"ups and downs.\" At one time the editor  had mortgaged his house to pay the running expenses; but friends came  to his aid, his debts were paid, and the circulation of the paper  doubled. In _My Bondage and My Freedom_ Douglass gives the names of  numerous persons who helped him in these earlier years of editorial  effort, among whom were a dozen of the most distinguished public men  of his day. After the _North Star_ had been in existence several  years, its name was changed to _Frederick Douglass's Paper_, to give  it a more distinctive designation, the newspaper firmament already  scintillating with many other \"Stars.\"    In later years Douglass speaks of this newspaper enterprise as one of  the wisest things he ever undertook. To paraphrase Lord Bacon's famous  maxim, much reading of life and of books had made him a full man, and  much speaking had made him a ready man. The attempt to put facts  and arguments into literary form tended to make him more logical  in reasoning and more exact in statement. One of the effects of  Douglass's editorial responsibility and the influences brought to bear  upon him by reason of it, was a change in his political views. Until  he began the publication of the _North Star_ and for several years  thereafter, he was, with the rest of the Garrisonians, a pronounced  disunionist. He held to the Garrisonian doctrine that the pro-slavery  Constitution of the United States was a \"league with death and a  covenant with hell,\" maintained that anti-slavery men should not vote  under it, and advocated the separation of the free States as the  only means of preventing the utter extinction of freedom by the  ever-advancing encroachments of the slave power. In Rochester he found  himself in the region where the Liberty party, under the leadership of  James G. Birney, Salmon P. Chase, Gerrit Smith, and others, had its  largest support. The Liberty party maintained that slavery could be  fought best with political weapons, that by the power of the ballot  slavery could be confined strictly within its constitutional limits  and prevented from invading new territory, and that it could be  extinguished by the respective States whenever the growth of public  opinion demanded it. One wing of the party took the more extreme  ground that slavery was contrary to the true intent and meaning of  the Constitution, and demanded that the country should return to the  principles of liberty upon which it was founded. Though the more  radical abolitionists were for a time bitterly opposed to these views,  yet the Liberty party was the natural outgrowth of the abolition  agitation. Garrison and Phillips and Douglass and the rest had  planted, Birney and Gerrit Smith and Chase and the rest watered, and  the Union party, led by the great emancipator, garnered the grain  after a bloody harvest.    Several influences must have co-operated to modify Douglass's  political views. The moral support and occasional financial aid given  his paper by members of the Liberty party undoubtedly predisposed  him favorably to their opinions. His retirement as agent of the  Anti-slavery Society and the coolness resulting therefrom had taken  him out of the close personal contact with those fervent spirits who  had led the van in the struggle for liberty. Their zeal had been more  disinterested, perhaps, than Douglass's own; for, after all, they had  no personal stake in the outcome, while to Douglass and his people the  abolition of slavery was a matter of life and death. Serene in the  high altitude of their convictions, the Garrisonians would accept no  halfway measures, would compromise no principles, and, if their right  arm offended them, would cut it off with sublime fortitude and cast it  into the fire. They wanted a free country, where the fleeing victim of  slavery could find a refuge. Douglass perceived the immense advantage  these swarming millions would gain through being free in the States  where they already were. He had always been minded to do the best  thing possible. When a slave, he had postponed his escape until it  seemed entirely feasible. When denied cabin passage on steamboats,  he had gone in the steerage or on deck. When he had been refused  accommodation in a hotel, he had sought it under any humble roof that  offered. It would have been a fine thing in the abstract to refuse the  half-loaf, but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11015"],[0,"Pantheism, Its Story and Significance (#7)"],[1,"eism--if  logic in such a case had any function--there can be no doubt. But for  most of them \"God's word written\" seemed to confirm God's word in  heaven and earth as known to them, proclaiming that there had been a  beginning and there must be an end. Therefore, whatever might be the  immanence of the Creator in His works, God could not, in their minds, be  identified with \"the fashion of this world\" which \"passeth away.\"    Yet the time was coming when the Divine word both in Scripture and in  Nature was to be otherwise read. For men began to learn that the Bible  was other than they had supposed and the Universe immeasurably greater  than they had conceived.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 12: _De Mundi Opificio_, p. 5B. I take him to mean by [Greek:  kosmos noetos]--the world as apperceived--realised in our  consciousness.]    [Footnote 13: It should be noted that Philo, who was contemporary with  Jesus, often uses the title \"the Father\" [Greek: ho Pataer] as a  sufficient designation of the Eternal. It was not very usual, and is  suggestive of certain spiritual sympathies amidst enormous intellectual  divergencies between the Alexandrian philosopher and the Galilean  prophet.]    [Footnote 14: See Col. i. 15-17 and refs. John i. 1-3; iii. 13; viii.  58.]          CHAPTER III      MODERN PANTHEISM.    [Sidenote: Spinoza.]    [Sidenote: A Pantheistic Prophet.]    [Sidenote: The Main Subject here Is his Religion and not his  Philosophy.]    Modern Pantheism as a religion begins with Spinoza. Whether it ended  with him is a question which the future will have to decide. But the  signs of the times are, at least in my view, very clearly against such a  conclusion. And amongst the omens which portend immortality, not  necessarily for the philosophical scheme, but for the \"God-intoxicated\"  devoutness of his Pantheism, is the desire, or rather the imperious need  increasingly realized, for a religion emancipated from theories of  creation or teleology, intolerant of any miracle, save indeed the  wonders of the spiritual life, and satisfying the heart with an ever  present God. For it is to be remembered that Spinoza was the first  Pantheist who was also a prophet, in the sense of speaking out the  divine voice of the infinite Universe to its human constituent parts.  Not that I would minimize the religious fervour of the Neo-Platonists:  it is their Pantheism that seems to have been imperfect. But in Spinoza  we have a man who, inheriting by birth the tradition--I might even say  the apostolic succession--of the Jewish prophets, and gifted with an  insight into the consummation of that tradition in Jesus Christ, was  driven by a commanding intellect to divorce the spiritual life he prized  from creeds that had become to him Impossible, and to enshrine it in the  worthier temple of an eternal Universe identical with God. It is not,  then, with his philosophy that I am so much concerned as with his  religion.[15]    [Sidenote: His Originality.]    [Sidenote: Relation to Descartes.]    It is given to no man to be absolutely original in the sense of creating  ideas of which no germs existed before his day. But short of such an  impossible independence of the past, Benedict de Spinoza had perhaps as  much originality as any man who ever lived. Yet with a modesty ever  characteristic of moral greatness, he himself was disposed, at any rate  during his earlier philosophical development, to exaggerate his  indebtedness to the philosopher Descartes, whose system he laboriously  abridged in the inappropriate form of a series of propositions supposed  to be demonstrated after the fashion of Euclid.    [Sidenote: Fundamental Differences.]    [Sidenote: Spinoza Discards Creator and Creation,]    [Sidenote: Beginning and End.]    [Sidenote: Takes the Universe as it Is.]    [Sidenote: And Worships the Static Whole as God.]    But whatever may have been the esoteric belief of Descartes about  creation out of nothing and the theological dogmas connected therewith,  he attached too much importance to the social and political functions of  established ecclesiastical institutions to declare himself independent  of them. And though his submission, signalised on his death-bed, did not  interfere with the freest working of his brilliant intellect within  limits permitted to the former ecclesiastical \"schoolmen,\" it did  prevent his frank realization of the eternal oneness of all being. For  it compelled him to retain belief in a Creator distinct in essence from  Creation. Such a belief Spinoza entirely rejected. For though his  \"Natura Naturans,\" or Nature Active, may in a manner be called the  Creator of his \"Natura Naturata,\" or Nature Passive, these are  consubstantial and co-eternal, neither being before or after the other.  Thus for him there was no beginning of the Universe and there could be  no end. There was no creation out of nothing, nor any omen of weariness,  decay, or death in the eternal order. He teaches us in effect to take  the Universe as it is, and to pry into no supposed secrets of origin or  end, an entirely gratuitous labour, imposed by illusions arising out of  the continuous redistribution of parts of the Whole. Instead of thus  spending our mental energy for nought, he would have us regard the whole  of Being as one Substance characterized by innumerable attributes, of  which Extension and Thought alone come within our human cognizance;  while each Attribute is subject to infinite Modes or modifications,  which, in their effect on the two attributes known to us--extension and  thought--constitute the universe of our experience. That infinite and  eternal Substance revealed by Attributes and their Modes is God,  absolute in His perfections if He could be fully conceived and known in  all His activities. And even to our ignorance He is entrancing in His  gradual self-revelation, as with our inadequate ideas we pursue the  unattainable from glory to glory.    [Sidenote: This View of the Universe applied to Psalm civ.]    This, then, is the first note we make of the gospel of Spinoza. But if  any one thinks that the sacred word \"gospel\" is here misused, and that  such teaching is fatal to piety, let him turn to the 104th Psalm and  read, from Spinoza's point of view, the cosmic vision of the Hebrew  seer. True, we can think no longer of the supernatural carpenter who  works on \"the beams of his chambers\" above, or of the mythical engineer  who digs deep in the darkness to \"lay the foundations of the earth.\" For  that is poetry, appealing by concrete images to the emotions. But it  does not bind the intellect to a literal interpretation; and we are no  longer tormented by vain efforts to reconcile with infinite  impossibilities the half-human personality presented in poetic guise. So  that the vision of the seer is now the suggestion to us of an infinite  and eternal Being, whose attributes by modification take the innumerable  shapes of sun, moon, and stars, and mountains and river, and tree and  flower, and bird and beast, and man. And the winds that sweep and the  floods that roll, and the rocky barriers that stand fast, and the rivers  that wind among the hills, and the trees that flourish and the living  societies that gather in fruitful places, the labourer in his vineyard,  the sailor in his ship, all are in and of the one Eternal Being. Yet we  echo not with less, but perhaps with more reverence, than the believers  in a divine artisan, the words of the Psalmist: \"O Lord, how manifold  are Thy works! in wisdom hast Thou made them all: the earth is full of  Thy riches.\" But if the thunder and the flaming fire and the sweeping  flood seem discordant, they existed for the Psalmist as well as for us,  and they do not seem to have troubled him. At this point, therefore, we  need only say that Spinoza's religion of one divine Substance, whose  unity in variety is holy, ought to stir within us with not less fervour,  at least the spirit of the Psalmist's concluding prayer: \"Let the  sinners be consumed out of the earth and let the wicked be no more.\"    [Sidenote: Spinoza no Materialist,]    [Sidenote: Notwithstanding his Attribution of \"Extension\" to God.]    [Sidenote: Criticism by Sir F. Pollock.]    [Sidenote: Changes In Theories of Matter since Spinoza's time.]    Spinoza's maintenance of extension as one of the two infinite divine  attributes cognizable by us has, with a certain amount of plausibility,  been urged as a note of materialism. And this reproach has been  supported by reference to his insistence that in man the body and the  soul are only two different aspects of the same thing; for to him the  body is a finite Mode of God's infinite attribute of extension and the  soul a finite Mode of God's infinite attribute of thought, while both  are manifestations of the one eternal divine Substance. Still, if in any  way we are to regard God as extended, it seems impossible to avoid the  inference that we regard Him as identified with matter, or at least the  possibility of matter. Sir Frederick Pollock has admitted that this is a  weak point in Spinoza's philosophy,[16] and mars its symmetry. But,  being more concerned with, his religion, I am content to point out that  such an objection was much more effective in Spinoza's time than it is  to-day. For the whole trend of philosophy during the nineteenth century  was towards a view of Extension itself as a mode of Thought, and  therefore toward the absorption of one of Spinoza's theoretical divine  attributes in the other.    [Sidenote: Their Effect on his System.]    Now if this should prove to be the permanent tendency of the most  influential thinkers--as indeed seems most likely--it will probably be  held that Spinoza was wrong in attributing extension to the Eternal as  one of the qualities of His substance, except in so far as extension is,  if not a necessary, at any rate an actual, and so far as we know, a  universal mode of thought. But though, as"]]]
