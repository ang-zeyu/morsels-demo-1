The jugglers were on their heads once more, bounding about with rigid  necks, playing the while in perfect time and tune. It chanced that out  of one of the bundles there stuck the end of what the clerk saw to be  a cittern, so drawing it forth, he tuned it up and twanged a harmony to  the merry lilt which the dancers played. On that they dropped their own  instruments, and putting their hands to the ground they hopped about  faster and faster, ever shouting to him to play more briskly, until at  last for very weariness all three had to stop.    \"Well played, sweet poppet!\" cried the younger. \"Hast a rare touch on  the strings.\"    \"How knew you the tune?\" asked the other.    \"I knew it not. I did but follow the notes I heard.\"    Both opened their eyes at this, and stared at Alleyne with as much  amazement as he had shown at them.    \"You have a fine trick of ear then,\" said one. \"We have long wished to  meet such a man. Wilt join us and jog on to Ringwood? Thy duties shall  be light, and thou shalt have two-pence a day and meat for supper every  night.\"    \"With as much beer as you can put away,\" said the other, \"and a flask of  Gascon wine on Sabbaths.\"    \"Nay, it may not be. I have other work to do. I have tarried with you  over long,\" quoth Alleyne, and resolutely set forth upon his journey  once more. They ran behind him some little way, offering him first  fourpence and then sixpence a day, but he only smiled and shook his  head, until at last they fell away from him. Looking back, he saw that  the smaller had mounted on the younger's shoulders, and that they stood  so, some ten feet high, waving their adieus to him. He waved back to  them, and then hastened on, the lighter of heart for having fallen in  with these strange men of pleasure.    Alleyne had gone no great distance for all the many small passages that  had befallen him. Yet to him, used as he was to a life of such quiet  that the failure of a brewing or the altering of an anthem had seemed  to be of the deepest import, the quick changing play of the lights and  shadows of life was strangely startling and interesting. A gulf seemed  to divide this brisk uncertain existence from the old steady round of  work and of prayer which he had left behind him. The few hours that had  passed since he saw the Abbey tower stretched out in his memory until  they outgrew whole months of the stagnant life of the cloister. As he  walked and munched the soft bread from his scrip, it seemed strange to  him to feel that it was still warm from the ovens of Beaulieu.    When he passed Penerley, where were three cottages and a barn, he  reached the edge of the tree country, and found the great barren heath  of Blackdown stretching in front of him, all pink with heather and  bronzed with the fading ferns. On the left the woods were still thick,  but the road edged away from them and wound over the open. The sun lay  low in the west upon a purple cloud, whence it threw a mild, chastening  light over the wild moorland and glittered on the fringe of forest  turning the withered leaves into flakes of dead gold, the brighter for  the black depths behind them. To the seeing eye decay is as fair as  growth, and death as life. The thought stole into Alleyne's heart as he  looked upon the autumnal country side and marvelled at its beauty. He  had little time to dwell upon it however, for there were still six good  miles between him and the nearest inn. He sat down by the roadside  to partake of his bread and cheese, and then with a lighter scrip he  hastened upon his way.    There appeared to be more wayfarers on the down than in the forest.  First he passed two Dominicans in their long black dresses, who swept by  him with downcast looks and pattering lips, without so much as a glance  at him. Then there came a gray friar, or minorite, with a good paunch  upon him, walking slowly and looking about him with the air of a man who  was at peace with himself and with all men. He stopped Alleyne to ask  him whether it was not true that there was a hostel somewhere in those  parts which was especially famous for the stewing of eels. The clerk  having made answer that he had heard the eels of Sowley well spoken of,  the friar sucked in his lips and hurried forward. Close at his heels  came three laborers walking abreast, with spade and mattock over their  shoulders. They sang some rude chorus right tunefully as they walked,  but their English was so coarse and rough that to the ears of a  cloister-bred man it sounded like a foreign and barbarous tongue. One  of them carried a young bittern which they had caught upon the moor, and  they offered it to Alleyne for a silver groat. Very glad he was to get  safely past them, for, with their bristling red beards and their fierce  blue eyes, they were uneasy men to bargain with upon a lonely moor.    Yet it is not always the burliest and the wildest who are the most to  be dreaded. The workers looked hungrily at him, and then jogged onwards  upon their way in slow, lumbering Saxon style. A worse man to deal with  was a wooden-legged cripple who came hobbling down the path, so weak and  so old to all appearance that a child need not stand in fear of him.  Yet when Alleyne had passed him, of a sudden, out of pure devilment, he  screamed out a curse at him, and sent a jagged flint stone hurtling past  his ear. So horrid was the causeless rage of the crooked creature, that  the clerk came over a cold thrill, and took to his heels until he was  out of shot from stone or word. It seemed to him that in this country  of England there was no protection for a man save that which lay in the  strength of his own arm and the speed of his own foot. In the cloisters  he had heard vague talk of the law--the mighty law which was higher than  prelate or baron, yet no sign could he see of it. What was the benefit  of a law written fair upon parchment, he wondered, if there were no  officers to enforce it. As it fell out, however, he had that very  evening, ere the sun had set, a chance of seeing how stern was the grip  of the English law when it did happen to seize the offender.    A mile or so out upon the moor the road takes a very sudden dip into a  hollow, with a peat-colored stream running swiftly down the centre  of it. To the right of this stood, and stands to this day, an ancient  barrow, or burying mound, covered deeply in a bristle of heather and  bracken. Alleyne was plodding down the slope upon one side, when he saw  an old dame coming towards him upon the other, limping with weariness  and leaning heavily upon a stick. When she reached the edge of the  stream she stood helpless, looking to right and to left for some ford.  Where the path ran down a great stone had been fixed in the centre of  the brook, but it was too far from the bank for her aged and uncertain  feet. Twice she thrust forward at it, and twice she drew back, until at  last, giving up in despair, she sat herself down by the brink and  wrung her hands wearily. There she still sat when Alleyne reached the  crossing.    \"Come, mother,\" quoth he, \"it is not so very perilous a passage.\"    \"Alas! good youth,\" she answered, \"I have a humor in the eyes, and  though I can see that there is a stone there I can by no means be sure  as to where it lies.\"    \"That is easily amended,\" said he cheerily, and picking her lightly up,  for she was much worn with time, he passed across with her. He could  not but observe, however, that as he placed her down her knees seemed to  fail her, and she could scarcely prop herself up with her staff.    \"You are weak, mother,\" said he. \"Hast journeyed far, I wot.\"    \"From Wiltshire, friend,\" said she, in a quavering voice; \"three days  have I been on the road. I go to my son, who is one of the King's  regarders at Brockenhurst. He has ever said that he would care for me in  mine old age.\"    \"And rightly too, mother, since you cared for him in his youth. But when  have you broken fast?\"    \"At Lyndenhurst; but alas! my money is at an end, and I could but get a  dish of bran-porridge from the nunnery. Yet I trust that I may be able  to reach Brockenhurst to-night, where I may have all that heart can  desire; for oh! sir, but my son is a fine man, with a kindly heart of  his own, and it is as good as food to me to think that he should have a  doublet of Lincoln green to his back and be the King's own paid man.\"    \"It is a long road yet to Brockenhurst,\" said Alleyne; \"but here is such  bread and cheese as I have left, and here, too, is a penny which may  help you to supper. May God be with you!\"    \"May God be with you, young man!\" she cried. \"May He make your heart as  glad as you have made mine!\" She turned away, still mumbling blessings,  and Alleyne saw her short figure and her long shadow stumbling slowly up  the slope.    He was moving away himself, when his eyes lit upon a strange sight, and  one which sent a tingling through his skin. Out of the tangled scrub on  the old overgrown barrow two human faces were looking out at him; the  sinking sun glimmered full upon them, showing up every line and feature.  The one was an oldish man with a thin beard, a crooked nose, and a broad  red smudge from a birth-mark over his temple; the other was a negro, a  thing rarely met in England at that day, and rarer still in the quiet  southland parts. Alleyne had read of such folk, but had never seen one  before, and could scarce take his eyes from the fellow's broad pouting  lip and shining teeth. Even as he gazed, however, the two came writhing  out from among the heather, and came down towards him with such a  guilty, slinking carriage, that the clerk felt that there was no good in  them, and hastened onwards upon his way.    He had not gained the crown of the slope, when he heard a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#6)"],[1,"he had experienced  himself. In his own son he studied himself.           *       *       *       *       *    This child, born of a Christian mother, and who was to become the great  defender of the faith, was not christened at his birth. In the early  Church, and especially in the African Church, it was not usual to do so.  The baptismal day was put as far off as possible, from the conviction that  the sins committed after the sacrament were much more serious than those  which went before. The Africans, very practical folk, clearly foresaw that  they would sin again even after baptism, but they wanted to sin at a better  rate, and lessen the inflictions of penance. This penance in Augustin's  time was far from being as hard as in the century before. Nevertheless, the  remembrance of the old severity always remained, and the habit was taken to  put off baptism so as not to discourage sinners overmuch.    Monnica, always sedulous to conform with the customs of her country and  the traditions of her Church, fell in with this practice. Perhaps she may  have had also the opposition of her husband to face, for he being a pagan  would not have cared to give too many pledges to the Christians, nor to  compromise himself in the eyes of his fellow-pagans by shewing that he  was so far under the control of Christian zealots as to have his child  baptized out of the ordinary way. There was a middle course, and this was  to inscribe the child among the catechumens. According to the rite of the  first admission to the lowest order of catechumens, the sign of the cross  was made on Augustin's forehead, and the symbolic salt placed between his  lips. And so they did not baptize him. Possibly this affected his whole  life. He lacked the baptismal modesty. Even when he was become a bishop, he  never quite cast off the old man that had splashed through all the pagan  uncleannesses. Some of his words are painfully broad for chaste ears. The  influence of African conditions does not altogether account for this. It is  only too plain that the son of Patricius had never known entire virginity  of soul.    They named him Aurelius Augustinus. Was Aurelius his family name? We cannot  tell. The Africans always applied very fantastically the rules of Roman  nomenclature. Anyhow, this name was common enough in Africa. The Bishop of  Carthage, primate of the province and a friend of Augustin, was also called  Aurelius. Pious commentators have sought to find in this name an omen of  Augustin's future renown as an orator. They have remarked that the word  _aurum_, gold, is contained in Aurelius--a prophetic indication of the  golden mouth of the great preacher of Hippo.    Meanwhile, he was a baby like any other baby, who only knew, as he tells  us, how to take his mother's breast. However, he speaks of nurses who  suckled him; no doubt these were servants or slaves of the household.  They gave him their milk, like those Algerian women who, to-day, if their  neighbour is called away, take her child and feed it. Besides, with them  children are weaned much later than with us. You can see mothers sitting at  their doors put down their work and call to a child of two or three playing  in the street for him to come and take the breast. Did Augustin remember  these things? At least he recalled his nurses' games, and the efforts they  made to appease him, and the childish words they taught him to stammer.  The first Latin words he repeated, he picked up from his mother and the  servants, who must also have spoken Punic, the ordinary tongue of the  populace and small trader class. He learned Punic without thinking about  it, in playing with other children of Thagaste, just as the sons of our  colonists learn Arab in playing with little boys who wear chechias on their  heads.    He is a Christian, a bishop, already a venerated Father, consulted by the  whole Catholic world, and he tells us all that. He tells it in a serious  and contrite way, with a manifest anxiety to attribute to God, as the sole  cause, all the benefits which embellished his childhood, as well as to  deplore his faults and wretchedness, fatal consequence of the original  Fall. And still, we can make out clearly that these suave and far-off  memories have a charm for him which he cannot quite guard himself against.  The attitude of the author of the _Confessions_ is ambiguous and a little  constrained. The father who has loved his child, who has joined in his  games, struggles in him against the theologian who later on was to uphold  the doctrine of Grace against the heretics. He feels that he must shew, not  only that Grace is necessary for salvation and that little children ought  to be baptized, but that they are capable of sinning. Yes, the children sin  even at nurse. And Augustin relates this story of a baby that he had seen:  \"I know, because I have seen, jealousy in a babe. It could not speak, yet  it eyed its foster-brother _with pale cheeks and looks of hate_.\" Children  are already men. The egoism and greediness of the grown man may be already  descried in the newly born.    However, the theologian of Grace was not able to drive from his mind  this verse of the Gospel: _Sinite ad me parvulos venire_--\"Suffer little  children to come unto Me.\" But he interprets this in a very narrow sense,  luring it into an argument which furthers his case. For him, the small  height of children is a symbol of the humility without which no one can  enter God's kingdom. The Master, according to him, never intended us to  take children as an example. They are but flesh of sin. He only drew from  their littleness one of those similitudes which He, with His fondness for  symbols, favoured.    Well, let us dare to say it: Augustin goes wrong here. Such is the penalty  of human thought, which in its justest statements always wounds some  truth less clear or mutilates some tender sentiment. Radically, Augustin  is right. The child is wicked as man is. We know it. But against the  relentlessness of the theologian we place the divine gentleness of Christ:  \"Suffer little children to come unto Me, for of such is the Kingdom of  God.\"          IV    THE FIRST GAMES      \"I loved to play,\" Augustin says, in telling us of those far-off years.    Is it surprising if this quick and supple intelligence, who mastered  without effort, and as if by instinct, the encyclopaedic knowledge of his  age, who found himself at his ease amidst the deepest abstractions, did, at  the beginning, take life as a game?    The amusements of the little Africans of to-day are not very many, nor very  various either. They have no inventive imagination. In this matter their  French playfellows have taught them a good deal. If they play marbles, or  hopscotch, or rounders, it is in imitation of the _Roumis_. And yet they  are great little players. Games of chance attract them above all. At these  they spend hour after hour, stretched out flat on their stomachs in some  shady corner, and they play with an astonishing intensity of passion. All  their attention is absorbed in what they are about; they employ on the game  all the cunning of their wits, precociously developed, and so soon stuck  fast in material things.    When Augustin recalls the games of his childhood, he only mentions \"nuts,\"  handball, and birds. To capture a bird, that winged, light, and brilliant  thing, is what all children long to do in every country on earth. But in  Africa, where there are plenty of birds, big people as well as little  love them. In the Moorish cafes, in the wretchedest _gourbis_, cages made  of reeds are hung on the walls, all rustling with trills and fluttering  of wings. Quail, thrushes, nightingales are imprisoned in them. The  nightingale, the singing-bird beyond all others, so difficult to tame, is  the honoured guest, the privileged dweller in these rustic cages. With  the rose, he is an essential part of Arab poetry. The woods round about  Thagaste were full of nightingales. Not the least doubt that the child  Augustin had felt the little musical throats of these singing-birds throb  between his hands. His sermons, his heaviest treatises, have a recollection  of them. He draws from them an evidence in favour of the creating Word who  has put beauty and harmony everywhere. In the song of the nightingale he  finds, as it were, an echo of the music of the spheres.    If he loved birds, as a poet who knows not that he is a poet, did he love  as well to play at \"nuts\"? \"Nuts,\" or thimble-rigging, is only a graceful  and crafty game, too crafty for a dreaming and careless little boy. It  calls for watchfulness and presence of mind. Grown men play at it as well  as children. A step of a staircase is used as a table by the players, or  the pavement of a courtyard. Three shells are laid on the stone and a  dried pea. Then, with rapid baffling movements, hands brown and alert fly  from one shell to another, shuffle them, mix them up, juggle the dried  pea sometimes under this shell, sometimes under that,--and the point is  to guess which shell the pea has got under. By means of certain astute  methods, an artful player can make the pea stick to his fingers, or to the  inside of the shell, and the opponent loses every time. They cheat with a  calm shamelessness. Augustin cheated too--which did not prevent him from  bitterly denouncing the cheating of his fellow-players.    The truth is, that he would not have quite belonged to his country if he  had not lied and stolen now and then. He lied to his tutor and to his  schoolmasters. He stole at his parents' table, in the kitchen, and in the  cellar. But he stole like a man of quality, to make presents and to win  over his playfellows: he ruled the other boys by his presents--a noteworthy  characteristic in this future ruler of souls. Morals like these, a little  rough, shape free and bold natures. Those African children were much less  coddled, much less scolded, than to-day. Monnica"]]]
