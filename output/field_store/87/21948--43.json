At 8 the signal of Boats man'd and arm'd to go to Point Levi,  weighed and dropped hier up. About 10 the enemy march'd up and attacked  General Wolfe, the action lasted not 10 minutes before the Enemy gave way  and run in the Greatest Confusion and left us a compleat Victuary. Our  Army encamped on the plain a back of the Town and made the necessary  disposition for carrying on ye siege. Admiral Holmes hoisted his flag on  board the Lowestaff, just off the Landing place. In this action fell  General Wolfe, of the enemy General Montcalm and his two seconds.\"    Cook does not mention the death of Wolfe, but says \"the troops continued  the pursuit to the very gates of the city, afterward they begun to form  the necessary dispositions for carrying on the siege.\"    Cook is said by some writers to have piloted the troops to the  landing-place, and has even been set within hearing of the legendary  recitation by Wolfe of Gray's Elegy, but as he was out with the  Pembroke's boats in the Basin at the time Holmes started up the river,  and was probably on his ship, with his hands full driving the  bombardment, and the recital of the Elegy at such a time was probably a  myth, the traditions may be put down to imagination. The boats were  piloted to the landing by Captain Chads of H.M.S. Vesuvius.    The town having surrendered five days after the battle, the movements  made by Saunders in the Basin no doubt aiding M. de Ramesay, the  Governor, in coming to a decision, General Murray was left with a  garrison, and the fleet sailed for England, sending a detachment of the  Northumberland and six others to Halifax with orders that Captain Lord  Colville was to hoist the Broad Pennant as Commander-in-Chief of the  North American Station, and as soon as the season opened he was to return  to the St. Lawrence to render support to any further movements made in  Canada.    APPOINTMENT TO H.M.S. NORTHUMBERLAND.    Before the fleet left, however, Cook's connection with H.M.S. Pembroke  came to an end. Captain King, who was with Cook on his last voyage,  writes to Dr. Douglas that he does not know the exact date of Cook's  appointment to the Northumberland, but he was certainly Master of that  ship in 1758. Here King is in error, for Lieutenant James Norman, of the  Pembroke, has the following entry in his log under date 23rd September  1759: \"Mr. Cook, Master, superseded and sent on board the Northumberland,  per order of Admiral Saunders.\" It has been said that Lord Colville made  this appointment, but of course he could not do so, though he may perhaps  have applied for Cook's services, but it is far more probable that the  appointment was made by Saunders for the special purpose of having the  survey of the St. Lawrence thoroughly well carried out.      CHAPTER 4. 1759 TO 1762. H.M.S. NORTHUMBERLAND.    On the way down the river from Quebec, the fleet appears to have found  the passage very difficult, the dangers of the Channel being aggravated  by the strength of the current and bad weather. The Captain, Vesuvius,  and Royal William were aground for some time, but were ultimately got off  again without much damage; and the Terrible, which was drifting and in  great danger, was only brought up by means of an anchor constructed for  the occasion by lashing one of the quarter-deck guns to two small  anchors. When her large anchors were hauled up they were found to be  broken; and so great was the loss of these articles that Lord Colville  was obliged to press the Admiralty for a fresh supply to be sent out  immediately, as he found it impossible to replace those lost in the  Traverse either at Boston or any other place in America.    RELIEF OF QUEBEC.    Colville's squadron arrived in Halifax on 27th October, Cook's  thirty-first birthday, and as soon as the winter was over, and the ships  were cleaned and fitted for sea as well as the limited appliances would  permit, it left for the St. Lawrence, sailing on 22nd April 1760, but was  \"so retarded by frozen fogs, seas of compacted ice, and contrary winds,\"  that it did not arrive off the Ile de Bic before 16th May. Here they were  met by a sloop with the news that Quebec was in urgent need of help.  General Murray, hearing of the approach of General de Levis, with a  French force, had left the shelter of the forts, and notwithstanding he  was greatly outnumbered, had offered battle in the open. He had at first  chosen a strong position, but hearing from spies that the French were  busy cleaning their arms after being caught in a heavy storm the night  before, he advanced upon them, and owing to the sudden attack and the  superiority of his artillery, at first gained a considerable advantage,  but afterwards the weight of numbers told, and the British were forced to  retire to the town with sadly reduced numbers, and Quebec was again  besieged. On receipt of this news Colville pushed on with his squadron,  and the arrival of the Vanguard and Diamond on the 17th, followed by the  Northumberland and the remainder on the next day, caused the French to  retire.    During the next four months the fleet passed an uneventful time in the  Canadian waters, the flagship being moored in the Basin, and then on the  12th September they received the acceptable news that Montreal and the  rest of the province of New France had surrendered to General Amherst,  and on 10th October the squadron again returned to Halifax to winter  quarters.    On 19th January 1761, Lord Colville records in his Journal that he had  \"directed the storekeeper to pay the Master of the Northumberland, fifty  pounds in consideration of his indefatigable industry in making himself  master of the pilotage of the River St. Lawrence.\" This is the first  official recognition that has been found of the fact that Cook had gone  beyond the ordinary duties incumbent on every Master in His Majesty's  Service, namely: \"To observe all coasts, shoals, and rocks, taking  careful notes of the same.\" There is no record in any of the official  documents that Cook was specially engaged in surveying the river, but it  is very evident from this entry that he must have done the work during  the four months that his ship was moored in the Basin of Quebec. That is  to say, his promotion to the Northumberland was previous to, and not a  consequence of his survey of the river, and that it was on account of his  fitness for the work, and not because it had been done, as is constantly  asserted, that he had been selected.    THE NORTH AMERICAN PILOT.    Admiral Saunders had issued orders the previous year, that the general  instructions of the Admiralty as to taking observations, soundings, and  bearings were to be carefully carried out, and the information obtained  was, as opportunity offered, to be forwarded to him \"so that all existing  charts may be corrected and improved.\" This information, in the ordinary  course, would be handed to Mr. Bissett, the Master of the flagship, for  comparison and compilation, and he, knowing Cook's fitness for the work,  may have asked for his assistance and thus introduced him to the notice  of Saunders, noted for his quick eye for merit, who, seeing his aptitude,  selected him for the completion of the task. Saunders, after his return  to England, wrote to the Secretary of the Admiralty, on 22nd April 1760,  saying that he had, ready for publication, a Draught of the River St.  Lawrence with its harbours, bays, and islands, and asked for their  Lordships' directions thereon. With their Lordships' approval it was  published, and may be found at the end of The North American Pilot,  London, 1775, together with other maps, some of which are Cook's work. At  the commencement of the book is a letter from Cook to the compiler of the  volume, congratulating him on the collection, and referring to the fact  that some of the charts contain his work, but he does not lay claim to  any special ones. On Saunders' chart there is a long note which  concludes:    \"The distances between Isle Coudre and Isle of Orleans, the Pillar Rocks  and Shoals in the south channel were accurately determined by triangles.  The other parts of this chart were taken from the best French Draughts of  this River.\"    It is doubtful if this triangulation could have been carried out by Cook  during his passage up and then down the river, the only time he had in  1759, but if it were, it argues much greater knowledge of nautical  surveying than he is generally supposed to have had at the time.    During the winters that the Northumberland stayed in Halifax Harbour,  Cook employed his spare time in improving his knowledge of all subjects  that were likely to be of service to him in his profession. He read  Euclid for the first time, and entered upon a study of higher  mathematics, especially devoting himself to astronomy. King in his sketch  of Cook's life, says, on the authority of the man himself, that these  studies were carried on \"without any other assistance than what a few  books and his own industry afforded him.\"    At the opening of the season, Lord Colville dispersed his squadron to  those stations where their services appeared most necessary, and remained  with his ship at Halifax, as it was considered inadvisable to leave such  an important naval post open to attack from the French or the Spaniards.  He had been advised by despatches, dated 26th December 1761, that war had  been declared with the latter nation. During this period of waiting the  words \"nothing remarkable\" are in constant use in Captain Adams's (the  second Captain of the Northumberland) Journal. Cook utilised this time to  make a thorough survey of Halifax Harbour, the notes of which are now in  the United Service Museum, Whitehall.    At length the period of inaction was ended. Captain Charles Douglas,  H.M.S. Syren, who was cruising off Cape Race, received information that a  squadron of four French ships of the line, having some 1500 picked troops"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10843"],[0,"The Mental Life of Monkeys and Apes: A Study of Ideational Behavior (#7)"],[1,"over, obvious that his responses, as  they appear in table 1, are extremely different from those of a human  being who is capable of bringing the idea of first at the left end to  bear upon the problem in question.      _Problem 2. Second from the Right End_    Following the series of control trials of problem 1 given to Skirrl on  May 6, a period of four days was allowed during which the animal was  merely fed in the boxes each day. This was done in order that he should  partially lose the effects of his previous training to choose the first  box at the left before being presented with the second problem, the  second box from the right.    On May 11 regular experimentation was begun with problem 2. Naturally  the situation presented unusual difficulties to the monkey because of  his previously acquired habit, and on the first day it was possible to  give only five trials, in all except the first of which Skirrl had to be  aided by the experimenter to find the right box. He persistently, as  appears in the first line of records of table 2, entered the first box  at the left. The series was continued on May 13, but with very  unsatisfactory results, since he apparently had been greatly discouraged  by the unusual difficulties previously met. Only four trials could be  given, and in these the showing made was very poor. It is noteworthy,  however, that in trials 6, 7, and 8, May 13, there was no marked  tendency to choose the first box at the left. Thus quickly had the force  of the previous habit been broken.    For problem 2, the total number of open doors in the ten settings is  fifty, as appears from the data on page 18, and as ten of these fifty  open doors may be defined as right ones, the expected ratio of right to  wrong first choices in the absence of previous training is 1 to 4. The  actual ratio for the first series given in problem 2 is 1 to 8, while in  the second series it is 0 to 10.    On the morning of May 13, work was interrupted in the ninth trial by  what seemed at the moment a peculiarly unfortunate accident, but in the  light of later developments, an incident most fruitful of valuable  results.    Skirrl, in trial 9, directly entered box 1. Since this was not the right  box, he was punished by being confined in it for ten seconds. While in  the box he howled and when the entrance door was raised for him to  retrace his steps, he came out with a rush, showing extreme excitement  and either rage or fear, I could not be sure which. At intervals he  uttered loud cries, which I am now able to identify as cries of alarm.  Repeatedly he went to the open door of box 1 and peered in, or peered  down through the hole in the floor which received the staple on the  door. He refused to enter any one of the open boxes and continued, at  intervals of every half minute or so, his cries. For thirty minutes I  waited, hoping to be able to induce him to complete the series of  trials, but in vain. Although it was obvious that he was eager to escape  from the apparatus, he would not enter any of the boxes even when the  exit doors were raised. Instead, he gnawed at the door (12 in fig. 17)  to the alleyway D and attempted to force his way through, instead of  taking the easy and clear route to the alleys, through one of the boxes.  His behavior was most surprising and puzzling. Finally, I gave up the  attempt to complete the series and returned him to his cage by way of  the entrance door to the response-compartment E.    I then entered the apparatus to seek some explanation of the animal's  behavior, and my search was rewarded by the finding of two sharp pointed  nails which protruded for an inch or more in the middle of the floor of  box 1. My assistant, who had been charged with the task of installing  the locks for the several doors, had used nails instead of screws for  attaching staples underneath the floor and had neglected to clinch the  nails. Skirrl, in the dim light of the box, doubtless stepped upon one  of the nails and inflicted a painful, although not serious, injury upon  himself. It was impossible for him to see clearly the source of his  injury. He was greatly frightened and expressed the emotion most  vigorously. His behavior strongly suggested a superstitious dread of  some unseen danger. It may be that the instinctive fear of snakes, so  strong in monkeys, was partly responsible for his response.    The first result of this accident was that more than two weeks were  lost, for it was impossible, during the next few days, to induce the  animal to enter any of the multiple-choice boxes voluntarily. From May  14 to May 24, I labored daily to overcome his newly acquired fear. The  usual procedure was to coax him through one box after another by  standing at the exit door with some tempting morsel of food. After  several days of this treatment, he again trusted himself to the boxes,  although very circumspectly and only when both entrance and exit doors  were raised. Not until May 24 was it possible to resume regular  experimentation, and on that day it was found necessary to indicate the  right box by raising the exit door slightly and then immediately  lowering it. Trials in which this form of aid was given are indicated in  table 2 by a star following the last choice.    Gradually, Skirrl regained his confidence in the apparatus and began to  work more naturally. For a long time he would not stand punishment, and  it was necessary for the experimenter to be very careful in locking the  doors, since the sound of the bar sliding beneath the floor often  frightened and caused him to quit work. Day after day the tendency to  peer through the holes in the floor at the entrance to the boxes  rendered it clear that the animal feared some danger from beneath the  floor. This behavior was so persistent that much time was wasted in the  experiments.    On the last day of May, punishment by confinement for ten seconds in  wrong boxes was introduced, but since this tended to discourage the  monkey, there was substituted for it on June 1 the punishment of forcing  him to work his way out of each wrong box by raising the entrance door  which had been closed behind him. This he could fairly readily do, and  his stay in a box rarely measured more than ten seconds.    As a variation in the mode of procedure, confinement for thirty seconds  was tried on June 5, but it worked unsatisfactorily and had to be  abandoned. During this series, the animal was startled by the sound from  one of the sliding bars under the floor, and in the sixth trial he  refused to work.    As improvement was very slow, varied modes of rewarding and punishing  the animal were tried in the hope of discovering a means of facilitating  the work. Among the former are the use of banana, grapes, peanuts, and  other eagerly sought foods in varying quantities, and in the latter are  included periods of confinement ranging from ten seconds to sixty  seconds. In the end, confinement of about thirty seconds, combined with  a small quantity of food which was much to the monkey's taste, gave most  favorable results.    All this time Skirrl's attention to the task in hand was seldom good. He  was easily diverted and even when extremely hungry, often stopped work  in the middle of an early trial, yawned repeatedly and finally sat down  to wait for release from the apparatus.    The results obtained during the long continued trials with this animal  in problem 2 are presented in table 2, which differs from the previously  described table, first, in that several of the trials are followed by an  asterisk to indicate that aid was given by the experimenter, and second,  in that two additional columns, headed, respectively, R and W, are  presented. These give the right and wrong first choices for each day,  whereas the two columns preceding them give the same data for each  series of ten trials. Similarly, the ratio of right to wrong choices is  presented for each day in table 2, instead of for each series of ten  trials as in table 1.    From the results of table 2, several peculiarly interesting facts  appear. In the first place the influence of the habit of choosing the  first box at the left disappears with surprising suddenness, and in the  second place, there are remarkable contrasts in the results for  different settings as they appear in their respective vertical columns.  Thus, in the case of setting 1, after the first trial mistakes became  relatively infrequent, whereas in setting 6, which involved the same  number of doors, mistakes continued to be the rule until nearly a  thousand trials had been given. The most likely explanation of this  difference is that for some reason the animal avoided box 9.    The _reactive tendencies_, or better, the _methods of reaction_ which  manifested themselves during this long series of observations may be  described as follows: (a) choice of the first box at the left; (b)  random choice with tendency to choose first, a box near the middle of  the group; (c) choice of first box at the right followed by the one next  to it on the left; (d) direct choice of the right box.
