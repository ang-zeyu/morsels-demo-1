Cultivated plants of course, had only a small chance to exhibit new  qualities, as they have been so strictly controlled during so many  years. Moreover their purity of origin is in many cases doubtful. Among  wild plants only those could be expected to reward the investigator  which were of easy cultivation. For this reason I have limited myself to  the trial of wild plants of Holland, and have had the good fortune to  find among them at least one species in a state of mutability. It was  not really a native plant, but one that had been introduced from America  and belongs to an American genus. I refer to the great evening-primrose  or the evening-primrose of Lamarck. A strain of this beautiful species  is growing in an abandoned field in the vicinity of Hilversum, at a  short distance from Amsterdam. Here it has escaped from a park and  multiplied. In doing so it has produced and is still producing quite a  number of new types, some of which may be considered as retrograde  varieties, while others evidently are of the nature of progressive  elementary species.    This interesting plant has afforded me the means of observing directly  how new species originate, and of studying the laws of these changes. My  researches have followed a double line of inquiry. On one side, I have  limited [28] myself to direct field observations, and to tests of seed,  collected from the wild plants in their native locality. Obviously the  mutations are decided within the seed, and the culture of young plants  from them had no other aim than that of ascertaining what had occurred  in the field. And then the many chances of destruction that threaten  young plants in a wild state, could be avoided in the garden, where  environmental factors can be controlled.    My second line of inquiry was an experimental repetition of the  phenomena which were only partly discerned at the native locality. It  was not my aim to intrude into the process, nor to try to bring out new  features. My only object was to submit to the precepts just given  concerning pure treatment, individual seed gathering, exclusion of  crosses and accurate recording of all the facts. The result has been a  pedigree which now permits of stating the relation between all the  descendants of my original introduced plant. This pedigree at once  exhibits the laws followed by the mutating species. The main fact is,  that it does not change itself gradually, but remains unaffected during  all succeeding generations. It only throws off new forms, which are  sharply contrasted with the parent, and which are from the very  beginning as perfect and as constant, as narrowly [29] defined and as  pure of type as might be expected of any species.    These new species are not produced once or in single individuals, but  yearly and in large numbers. The whole phenomenon conveys the idea of a  close group of mutations, all belonging to one single condition of  mutability. Of course this mutable state must have had a beginning, as  it must sometime come to an end. It is to be considered as a period  within the life-time of the species and probably it is only a small part  of it.    The detailed description of this experiment, however, I must delay to a  subsequent lecture, but I may be allowed to state, that the discovery of  this period of mutability is of a definite theoretical importance. One  of the greatest objections to the Darwinian theory of descent arose from  the length of time it would require, if all evolution was to be  explained on the theory of slow and nearly invisible changes. This  difficulty is at once met and fully surmounted by the hypothesis of  periodical but sudden and quite noticeable steps. This assumption  requires only a limited number of mutative periods, which might well  occur within the time allowed by physicists and geologists for the  existence of animal and vegetable life on the earth.    [30] Summing up the main points of these introductory remarks, I propose  to deal with the subjects mentioned above at some length, devoting to  each of them, if possible at least an entire lecture. The decisive facts  and discussions upon which the conclusions are based will be given in  every case. Likewise I hope to point out the weak places and the lacunae  in our present knowledge, and to show the way in which each of you may  try to contribute his part towards the advancement of science in this  subject. Lastly I shall try to prove that sudden mutation is the normal  way in which nature produces new species and new varieties. These  mutations are more readily accessible to observation and experiment than  the slow and gradual changes surmised by Wallace and his followers,  which are entirely beyond our present and future experience.    The theory of mutations is a starting-point for direct investigation,  while the general belief in slow changes has held back science from such  investigations during half a century.    Coming now to the subdivisions and headings under which my material is  to be presented, I propose describing first the real nature of the  elementary species and retrograde varieties, both in normal form and in  hybridizations. A discussion of other types of varieties, including [31]  monstrosities will complete the general plan. The second subdivision  will deal with the origin of species and varieties as taught by  experiment and observation, treating separately the sudden variations  which to my mind do produce new forms, and subsequently the fluctuations  which I hold to be not adequate to this purpose.      [32]  B. ELEMENTARY SPECIES    LECTURE II    ELEMENTARY SPECIES IN NATURE    What are species? Species are considered as the true units of nature by  the vast majority of biologists. They have gained this high rank in our  estimation principally through the influence of Linnaeus. They have  supplanted the genera which were the accepted units before Linnaeus.  They are now to be replaced in their turn, by smaller types, for reasons  which do not rest upon comparative studies but upon direct experimental  evidence.    Biological studies and practical interests alike make new demands upon  systematic botany. Species are not only the subject-material of herbaria  and collections, but they are living entities, and their life-history  and life-conditions command a gradually increasing interest. One phase  of the question is to determine the easiest manner to deal with the  collected forms of a country, and another feature is the problem [33] as  to what groups are real units and will remain constant and unchanged  through all the years of our observations.    Before Linnaeus, the genera were the real units of the system. De  Candolle pointed out that the old common names of plants, such as roses  and clover, poplars and oaks, nearly all refer to genera. The type of  the clovers is rich in color, and the shape of the flower-heads and the  single flowers escape ordinary observation; but notwithstanding this,  clovers are easily recognized, even if new types come to hand. White and  red clovers and many other species are distinguished simply by  adjectives, the generic name remaining the same for all.    Tournefort, who lived in the second half of the 17th century  (1656-1708), is generally considered as the author of genera in  systematic botany. He adopted, what was at that time the general  conception and applied it throughout the vegetable kingdom. He grouped  the new and the rare and the previously overlooked forms in the same  manner in which the more conspicuous plants were already arranged by  universal consent. Species were distinguished by minor marks and often  indicated by short descriptions, but they were considered of secondary  importance.    Based on the idea of a direct creation of all [34] living beings, the  genera were then accepted as the created forms. They were therefore  regarded as the real existing types, and it was generally surmised that  species and varieties owed their origin to subsequent changes under the  influence of external conditions. Even Linnaeus agreed with this view in  his first treatises and in his \"Philosophical Botany\" he still kept to  the idea that all genera had been created at once with the beginning of  life.    Afterwards Linnaeus changed his opinion on this important point, and  adopted species as the units of the system. He declared them to be the  created forms, and by this decree, at once reduced the genera to the  rank of artificial groups. Linnaeus was well aware that this conception  was wholly arbitrary, and that even the species are not real indivisible  entities. But he simply forbade the study of lesser subdivisions. At his  time he was quite justified in doing so, because the first task of the  systematic botanists was the clearing up of the chaos of forms and the  bringing of them into connection with their real allies.    Linnaeus himself designated the subdivisions of the species as  varieties, but in doing so he followed two clearly distinct principles.  In some cases his species were real plants, and the varieties seemed to  be derived from them by [35] some simple changes. They were subordinated  to the parent-species. In other cases his species were groups of lesser  forms of equal value, and it was not possible to discern which was the  primary and which were the derivatives.    These two methods of subdivision seem in the main, and notwithstanding  their relatively imperfect application in many single examples, to  correspond with two really distinct cases. The derivative varieties are  distinguished from the parent-species by some single, but striking mark,  and often this attribute manifests itself as the loss of some apparent  quality. The loss of spines and of hairs and the loss of blue and red  flower-colors are the most notorious, but in rarer cases many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7238"],[0,"My Four Years in Germany (#6)"],[1,"were  suppressed, civil marriage made compulsory and the State assumed  new powers not only in the appointment but even in the education  of the Catholic priests. The Jesuits were expelled from Germany  in 1872. These measures, generally known as the May Laws, because  passed in May, 1873, 1874 and 1875, led to the creation and  strengthening of the Centrum or Catholic party. For a long period  many churches were vacant in Prussia. Finally, owing to the growth  of the Centrum, Bismarck gave in. The May Laws were rescinded  in 1886 and the religious orders, the Jesuits excepted, were  permitted to return in 1887. Civil marriage, however, remained  obligatory in Prussia.    Ever since the _Kulturkampf_ the Centrum has held the balance  of power in Germany, acting sometimes with the Conservatives  and sometimes with the Social Democrats.    In addition to these three great parties, there are minor parties  and groups which sometimes act with one party and sometimes with  another, the National Liberals, for example, and the Progressives.  Since the war certain members of the National Liberal party were  most bitter in assailing President Wilson and the United States.  In the demand for ruthless submarine war they acted with the  Conservatives. There are also Polish, Hanoverian, Danish and  Alsatian members of the Reichstag.    There are three great race questions in Germany. First of all,  that of Alsace-Lorraine. It is unnecessary to go at length into  this well-known question. In the chapter on the affair at Zabern,  something will be seen of the attitude of the troops toward the  civil population. At the outbreak of the war several of the deputies,  sitting in the Reichstag as members from Alsace-Lorraine, crossed  the frontier and joined the French army.    If there is one talent which the Germans superlatively lack, it  is that of ruling over other peoples and inducing other people  to become part of their nation.    It is now a long time since portions of the Kingdom of Poland,  by various partitions of that kingdom, were incorporated with  Prussia, but the Polish question is more alive to-day than at  the time of the last partition.    The Poles are of a livelier race than the Germans, are Roman  Catholics and always retain their dream of a reconstituted and  independent Kingdom of Poland.    It is hard to conceive that Poland was at one time perhaps the  most powerful kingdom of Europe, with a population numbering  twenty millions and extending from the Baltic to the Carpathians  and the Black Sea, including in its territory the basins of the  Warta, Vistula, Dwina, Dnieper and Upper Dniester, and that it  had under its dominion besides Poles proper and the Baltic Slavs,  the Lithuanians, the White Russians and the Little Russians or  Ruthenians.    The Polish aristocracy was absolutely incapable of governing its  own country, which fell an easy prey to the intrigues of Frederick  the Great and the two Empresses, Maria Theresa of Austria and  Catherine of Russia. The last partition of Poland was in the  year 1795.    Posen, at one time one of the capitals of the old kingdom of  Poland, is the intellectual centre of that part of Poland which has  been incorporated into Prussia. For years Prussia has alternately  cajoled and oppressed the Poles, and has made every endeavour to  replace the Polish inhabitants with German colonists. A commission  has been established which buys estates from Poles and sells  them to Germans. This commission has the power of condemning  the lands of Poles, taking these lands from them by force,  compensating them at a rate determined by the commission and  settling Germans on the lands so seized. This commission has  its headquarters in Posen. The result has not been successful.  All the country side surrounding Posen and the city itself are  divided into two factions. By going to one hotel or the other  you announce that you are pro-German or pro-Polish. Poles will  not deal in shops kept by Germans or in shops unless the signs  are in Polish.    The sons of Germans who have settled in Poland under the protection  of the commission often marry Polish women. The invariable result  of these mixed marriages is that the children are Catholics and  Poles. Polish deputies voting as Poles sit in the Prussian  legislature and in the Reichstag, and if a portion of the old  Kingdom of Poland is made a separate country at the end of this  war, it will have the effect of making the Poles in Prussia more  restless and more aggressive than ever.    In order to win the sympathies of the Poles, the Emperor caused  a royal castle to be built within recent years in the city of  Posen, and appointed a popular Polish gentleman who had served  in the Prussian army and was attached to the Emperor, the Count  Hutten-Czapski, as its lord-warden. In this castle was a very  beautiful Byzantine chapel built from designs especially selected  by the Emperor. In January, 1914, we went with Allison Armour  and the Cassatts, Mrs. Wiltsee and Mrs. Whitehouse on a trip  to Posen to see this chapel.    Some of our German friends tried to play a joke on us by telling  us that the best hotel was the hotel patronised by the Poles. To  have gone there would have been to declare ourselves anti-German  and pro-Polish, but we were warned in time. The castle has a  large throne room and ball-room; in the hall is a stuffed aurochs  killed by the Emperor. The aurochs is a species of buffalo greatly  resembling those which used to roam our western prairies. The  breed has been preserved on certain great estates in eastern  Germany and in the hunting forests of the Czar in the neighbourhood  of Warsaw.    Some of the Poles told me that at the first attempt to give a  court ball in this new castle the Polish population in the streets  threw ink through the carriage windows on the dresses of the  ladies going to the ball and thus made it a failure. The chapel  of the castle is very beautiful and is a great credit to the  Emperor's taste as an architect.    While being shown through the Emperor's private apartments in  this castle, I noticed a saddle on a sort of elevated stool in  front of a desk. I asked the guide what this was for: he told  me that the Emperor, when working, always sits in a saddle.    In Posen, in a book-store, the proprietor brought out for me a  number of books caricaturing the German rule of Alsace-Lorraine.  It is curious that a community of interests should make a market  for these books in Polish Posen.    Although not so well advertised, the Polish question is as acute  as that of Alsace-Lorraine.    After its successful war in 1866 against Austria, Bavaria, Saxony,  Baden, Hanover, etc., Prussia became possessed of the two duchies  of Schleswig-Holstein, which are to the south of Denmark on the  Jutland Peninsula. Here, strangely enough, there is a Danish  question. A number of Danes inhabit these duchies and have been  irritated by the Prussian officials and officers into preserving  their national feeling intact ever since 1866. Galling restrictions  have been made, the very existence of which intensifies the hatred  and prevents the assimilation of these Danes. For instance, Amundsen,  the Arctic explorer, was forbidden to lecture in Danish in these  duchies during the winter of 1913-14, and there were regulations  enforced preventing more than a certain number of these Danish  people from assembling in a hotel, as well as regulations against  the employment of Danish servants.    In 1866, after its successful war, Prussia wiped out the old  kingdom of Hanover and drove its king into exile in Austria.  To-day there is still a party of protest against this aggression.  The Kaiser believes, however, that the ghost of the claim of  the Kings of Hanover was laid when he married his only daughter  to the heir of the House of Hanover and gave the young pair the  vacant Duchy of Brunswick. That this young man will inherit the  great Guelph treasure was no drawback to the match in the eyes  of those in Berlin.    There is a hatred of Prussia in other parts of Germany, but coupled  with so much fear that it will never take practical shape. In  Bavaria, for example, even the comic newspapers have for years  ridiculed the Prussians and the House of Hohenzollern. The smashing  defeat by Prussia of Austria and the allied German States, Bavaria,  Saxony, Hesse, Hanover, etc., in 1866, and the growth of Prussianism  since then in all of these countries, keep the people from any  overt act. It is a question, perhaps, as to how these countries,  especially Bavaria, would act in case of the utter defeat of  Germany. But at present they must be counted on only as faithful  servants, in a military way, of the German Emperor.    Montesquieu, the author of the \"Esprit des Lois,\" says, \"All law  comes from the soil,\" and it has been claimed that residence in  the hot climate of the tropics in some measure changes Anglo-Saxon  character. It is, therefore, always well in judging national  character to know something of the physical characteristics and  climate of the country which a nation inhabits.    The heart of modern Germany is the great north central plain which  comprises practically all of the original kingdom of Prussia,  stretching northward from the Saxon and Hartz mountains to the  North and Baltic seas. It is from this dreary and infertile plain  that for many centuries conquering military races have poured  over Europe. The climate is not so cold in winter as that of  the northern part of the United States. There is much rain and  the winter skies are so dark that the absence of the sun must  have some effect upon the character of the people. The Saxons  inhabit a more mountainous country; Württemberg and Baden are  hilly; Bavaria is a land of beauty, diversified with lovely lakes  and mountains. The soft outlines of the vine-covered hills of  the Rhine Valley have long been the admiration of"]]]
