CANNING.      A beautiful medal in memory of this celebrated statesman, has lately been  struck at Paris, under the direction of M. Girard.           *       *       *       *       *      NATURE AND ART.      It is curious enough that people decorate their chimney-pieces with  imitations of beautiful fruits, while they seem to think nothing at all of  the originals hanging upon the trees, with all the elegant accompaniments  of flourishing branches, buds, and leaves--_Cobbet's English Gardener._           *       *       *       *       *      THE KING OF PRUSSIA      Lives in comparative retirement, in a small palace fitted up with the  greatest simplicity, and his bed is really not better than that usually  allotted to a domestic in England. His study is quite that of an official  man of business. He has a large map of his own dominions; and in each town  where troops are stationed he fixes a common pin, and on the head of the  pin is a small bit of card, on which are written the names of the  regiments, their numbers, and commanding officers, in the town. He thus,  at any moment, can see the disposition of his immense army, which is very  essential to such a government as Prussia, it being a mild despotic  military system. He has a most excellent modern map of the Turkish  provinces in Europe, and upon this is marked out every thing that can  interest a military man. A number of pins, with green heads, point out the  positions of the Russian army; and in the same manner, with  red-and-white-headed pins, he distinguishes the stations of the different  kinds of troops of the Turkish host.--_Literary Gazette_.      THE OPERA OF \"OTELLO.\"      Othello is altogether unsuited to the lyrical drama, and supposing the  contrary, Rossini, of all composers, was the most unfit to treat such a  subject in music. The catastrophe in the English tragedy is necessary; we  see it from the beginning as through a long and gloomy vista. We weep, or  shudder, we draw a long sigh of despair, and feel that it could not have  been otherwise. But in the opera, Othello is a ruffian, without excuse for  his crime. We have suddenly a beautiful woman running distracted about the  stage to a symphony--and a very noisy symphony--of violins, and butchered  before our eyes to an allegro movement.--_Foreign Review_.           *       *       *       *       *      FRENCH NOVELS.      When last in Paris we were curious to know wherefore M. Jouy had written  such exceptionable and abominable stuff as his last novel; and the  gentleman to whom we addressed ourselves, answered, in a light lively vein;  \"Oh! M. Jouy has a name, and the booksellers pay well; and as they are  very stupid, and depend on names for the sale of their books, he wrote  down the first matter that came into his head.\"--_Foreign Review_.           *       *       *       *       *      AMBER.      Polangen, the frontier town of Russia, is famous for its trade in amber.  This substance is found by the inhabitants on the coast, between Polangen  and Pillau, either loosely on the shore, on which it has been thrown by  the strong north and westerly winds, or in small hillocks of sand near the  sea, where it is found in regular strata. The quantity found yearly in  this manner, and on this small extent of coast, besides what little is  sometimes discovered in beds of pit coal in the interior of the country,  is said to amount to from 150 to 200 tons, yielding a revenue to the  government of Prussia of about 100,000 francs. As amber is much less in  vogue in Western Europe than in former times, the best pieces, which are  very transparent, and frequently weigh as much as three ounces, are sent  to Turkey and Persia, for the heads of their expensive pipes and hookahs.  Very few trinkets are now sold for ornaments to ladies' dresses; and the  great bulk of amber annually found is converted into a species of scented  spirits and oil, which are much esteemed for the composition of delicate  varnish. In the rough state, amber is sold by the ton, and forms an object  of export trade from Memel and Konigsberg.--_Granville's Travels in  Russia_.           *       *       *       *       *    The head of the late Dr. Gall has been taken off agreeably to his wishes,  and dissected and dried for the benefit of science.           *       *       *       *       *      MUSICAL TALENT.      All the principal Italian composers were _in flower_ about the age of  twenty-five. There is scarcely an instance of a musician producing his  _chef-d'oeuvre_ after the age of thirty. Rossini was not twenty when he  composed his _Tancredi_, and his _Italiana in Algieri_.           *       *       *       *       *    The most important principle perhaps in life is to have a pursuit--a  useful one if possible, and at all events an innocent one. The unripe  fruit tree of knowledge is, I believe, always bitter or sour; and  scepticism and discontent--sickness of the mind--are often the results of  devouring it.--_Sir Humphry Davy_.           *       *       *       *       *      COFFIN OF KING DUNCAN.    A coffin has been discovered among the ruins of Elgin cathedral, supposed  to be that of the royal victim of Macbeth.           *       *       *       *       *      AN IMPERIAL ENCORE.    When Cimarosa's opera of _Matrimonio Segreto_ was performed before the  Emperor Joseph, he invited all the singers to a banquet, and then in a fit  of enthusiasm, sent them all back to the theatre to play and sing the  whole opera over again!--_Foreign Review_.           *       *       *       *       *    _Dinner_ is a corruption of _decimer_, from _decimheure_, or the French  repast _de dix-heure. Supper_ from _souper_, from the custom of providing  soup for that occasion.           *       *       *       *       *      LARKS.      We have heard much of _Dunstable larks_ but the enthusiasm with which  _gourmets_ speak of these tit-bits of luxury, is far exceeded by the  Germans, who travel to Leipsic from a distance of many hundred miles,  merely to eat a dinner of larks, and then return contented and peaceful to  their families. So great is the slaughter of this bird at the Leipsic fair,  that half a million are annually devoured, principally by the booksellers  frequenting the city. What is the favourite bird at the coffee-house  dinners of our friends in Paternoster Row?           *       *       *       *       *      PAINTING CATS.      Gottfried Mind, a celebrated Swiss painter, was called the _Cat-Raphael_,  from the excellence with which he painted that animal. This peculiar  talent was discovered and awakened by chance. At the time when  Freudenberger was painting that since-published picture of the peasant  cleaving wood before his cottage, with his wife sitting by, and feeding  her child with pap out of a pot, round which a cat is prowling, Mind cast  a broad stare on the sketch of this last figure, and said in his rugged,  laconic way, \"That is no cat!\" Freudenberger asked, with a smile, whether  Mind thought he could do it better. Mind offered to try; went into a  corner, and drew the cat, which Freudenberger liked so much that he made  his new pupil finish it out, and the master copied the scholar's work--for  it is Mind's cat that is engraven in Freudenberger's plate. Imitations of  Mind's cats are already common in the windows of printsellers.           *       *       *       *       *      PLAY-WRITING.      When the manager of a theatre engaged Sacchini to write an opera, he was  obliged to shut him up in a room with his mistress and his favourite cats,  without them at his side he could do nothing. The fifth act of _Pizarro_  was actually finished by Sheridan on the first evening of its performance,  when the illustrious playwright was shut up in a room with a plate of  sandwiches and two bottles of claret, to finish his drama.           *       *       *       *       *      RETROSPECTIVE GLEANINGS.    THE BISHOPRICKS OF ENGLAND AND WALES      Were instituted according to the following order of time, viz. London an  Archbishoprick and Metropolitan of England, founded by Lucius, the first  Christian king of Britain, A.D. 185; Llandaff, 185; Bangor, 516; St.  David's, 519. The Archbishoprick of Wales from 550 till 1100, when the  Bishop submitted to the Archbishop of Canterbury as his Metropolitan;  St. Asaphs, 547. St. Augustine (or Austin) made Canterbury the Metropolitan  Archbishoprick, by order of Pope Gregory, A.D. 596; Wells, 604; Rochester,  604; Winchester, 650; Lichfield and Coventry, 656; Worcester, 679;  Hereford, 680; Durham, 690; Sodor and Man, 898; Exeter, 1050; Sherborne  (changed to Salisbury) 1056; York (Archbishoprick) 1067; Dorchester  (changed to Lincoln) 1070; Chichester, 1071; Thetford (changed to Norwich)  1088; Bath and Wells, 1088; Ely, 1109; Carlisle, 1133. The following six  were founded upon the suppression of monasteries by Henry VIII.--Chester,  Peterborough, Gloucester, Oxford, Bristol, and Westminster, 1538.  Westminster was united to London in 1550.--_Vide Tanner's Notitia  Monastica_.    C. G. E. P.           *       *       *       *       *      ADDINGTON, SURREY.      The lord of this manor, in the reign of Henry III. held it by this service,  viz. to make the king a mess of pottage at his coronation; and so lately  as the reign of Charles II. this service was ordered by the court of  claims, and accepted by the king at his table.    C. G. E. P.           *       *       *       *       *      THE BELL-SAVAGE INN      On Ludgate-hill, has, for more than a century, since its name was  mentioned by Addison in the _Spectator_, occasioned a great variety of  conjectures. These conjectures, however, all appear to have been erroneous,  as the inn took the addition to its name"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10852"],[0,"Hardy Ornamental Flowering Trees and Shrubs (#7)"],[1,"with which it  blooms during June and July from the wood of the previous year. It is  perfectly hardy even in the far north.    C. VIORNA.--Leather Flower. United States. This is a showy,  small-flowered species, the flowers being campanulate, greenish-white  within and purplish without. C. Viorna coccinea is not yet well known,  but is one of the prettiest of the small-flowered section. The flowers,  which are leathery as in the species, are of a beautiful vermilion on  the outside and yellow within.    C. VITALBA.--Lady's Bower, or Old Man's Beard. A handsome native climbing  shrub, common in limestone or chalky districts, and unusually abundant  in the southern English counties. Clambering over some neglected fence,  often to nearly 20 feet in height, this vigorous-growing plant is seen  to best advantage, the three or five-lobed leaves and festoons of  greenish-white, fragrant flowers, succeeded by the curious and attractive  feathery carpels, render the plant one of the most distinct and desirable  of our native wildlings flowering in August.    C. VITICELLA.--Spain, 1569. This is a well-known species of not too  rampant growth, and a native of Spain and Italy. The flowers vary a  good deal in colour, but in the typical plant they are reddish-purple  and produced throughout the summer. Crossed with C. lanuginosa, this  species has produced many ornamental and beautiful hybrids, one of the  finest and most popular being C. Jackmanii.    C. WILLIAMSI (_syn C. Fortunei_).--Japan, 1863. The fragrant, white  flowers of this species are semi-double, and consist of about 100  oblong-lanceolate sepals narrowed to the base. The leathery leaves are  trifoliolate with heart-shaped leaflets. It proves quite hardy, and has  several varieties.    GARDEN VARIETIES.--As well as the above there are many beautiful garden  hybrids, some of which in point of floral colouring far outvie the  parent forms. Included in the following list are a few of the most  beautiful kinds:--    Alba Victor.  Alexandra.  Beauty of Worcester.  Belle of Woking.  Blue Gem.  Duchess of Edinburgh.  Edith Jackman.  Fairy Queen.  John Gould Veitch.  Lady Bovill.  Lord Beaconsfield.  Lucie Lemoine.  Madame Baron Veillard.  Miss Bateman.  Mrs. A. Jackman.  Othello.  Prince of Wales.  Rubella.  Star of India.  Stella.  Venus Victrix.  William Kennett.      CLERODENDRON.    CLERODENDRON TRICHOTOMUM.--Japan, 1800. This is at once one of the most  beautiful and distinct of hardy shrubs. It is of stout, nearly erect  growth, 8 feet high, and nearly as much through, with large,  dark-green, ovate leaves, and deliciously fragrant white flowers, with  a purplish calyx, and which are at their best in September. Thriving  well in any light soil, being of vigorous constitution, and extremely  handsome of flower, are qualities which combine to render this shrub  one of particular importance in our gardens.    C. FOETIDUM, a native of China, is only hardy in southern and seaside  situations, where it forms a bush 5 feet high, with heart-shaped leaves,  and large clusters of rosy-pink flowers.      CLETHRA.    CLETHRA ACUMINATA.--Pointed-leaved Pepper Tree. Carolina, 1806. This is  not so hardy as C. alnifolia, hailing from the Southern States of North  America, but with a little protection is able to do battle with our  average English winter. It resembles C. alnifolia, except in the  leaves, which are sharp pointed, and like that species delights to grow  in damp positions. The flowers are white and drooping, and the growth  more robust than is that of C. alnifolia generally. For planting by the  pond or lake-side, the Pepper Trees are almost invaluable.    C. ALNIFOLIA.--Alder-leaved Pepper Tree. North America, 1831. A rather  stiff-growing shrub of about 5 feet in height, with leaves resembling  those of our common Alder, and bearing towards the end of July spikes  of almost oppressively fragrant dull-white flowers at the tips of the  branches. It is a valuable shrub, not only in an ornamental way, but on  account of it thriving in damp, swampy ground, where few others could  exist, while at the same time it will succeed and flower freely in  almost any good garden soil.      COCCULUS.    COCCULUS CAROLINUS.--This is a half hardy, twining shrub, of free  growth when planted by a tree stem in a sheltered wood, but with by no  means showy flowers; indeed, it may be described in few words as a  shrub of no great beauty nor value.    C. LAURIFOLIUS, from the Himalayas and Japan, is even less hardy than  the above, although, used as a wall plant, it has survived for many  years in the south and west of England. The foliage of this species is  neat and ornamental, but liable to injury from cold easterly winds.      COLLETIA.    COLLETIA CRUCIATA (_syn C. bictonensis_).--Chili, 1824. With flattened  woody branches, and sharp-pointed spines which take the place of  leaves, this is at once one of the most singular of hardy flowering  shrubs. It forms a stout dense bush about 4 feet high, and bears  quantities of small white flowers, which render the plant one of great  beauty during the summer months.    C. SPINOSA.--Peru, 1823. This species grows fairly well in some parts  of England and Ireland, and is a curious shrub with awl-shaped leaves,  and, like the other members of the family, an abundant producer of  flowers. It thrives best as a wall plant, and when favourably situated  a height of 12 feet is sometimes attained.      COLUTEA.    COLUTEA ARBORESCENS.--Bladder Senna. France, 1548. This is a common  plant in English gardens, bearing yellow Pea-shaped flowers, that are  succeeded by curious reddish bladder-like seed pods. It grows to 10  feet or 12 feet in height, and is usually of lax and slender growth,  but perfectly hardy.    C. CRUENTA (_syn C. orientalis_ and _C. sanguine_).--Oriental Bladder  Senna. Levant, 1710. This is a free-growing, round-headed, deciduous  bush, of from 6 feet to 8 feet high when fully grown. The leaves are  pinnate and glaucous, smooth, and bright green above, and downy  beneath. Flowers individually large, of a reddish-copper colour, with a  yellow spot at the base of the upper petal. The fruit is an inflated  boat-shaped reddish pod. The Bladder Sennas are of very free growth,  even in poor, sandy soil, and being highly ornamental, whether in  flower or fruit, are to be recommended for extensive cultivation.      CORIARIA.    CORIARIA MYRTIFOLIA.--South Europe, 1629. A deciduous shrub growing to  about 4 feet in height, with Myrtle-like leaves, and upright terminal  racemes of not very showy flowers, produced about mid-summer--generally  from May to August. For its pretty foliage and the frond-like  arrangement of its branches it is principally worthy of culture. From  southern Europe and the north of Africa, where it is an occupant of  waste ground and hedges, but still rare in our gardens.      CORNUS.    CORNUS ALBA.--White-fruited Dogwood. Siberia, 1741. This is a native of  northern Asia and Siberia, not of America as Loudon stated. For the  slender, red-barked branches and white or creamy flowers, this species  is well worthy of notice, while the white fruit renders it very  distinct and effective. It grows to about 10 feet in height. C. alba  Spathi is one of the most ornamental of shrubs bearing coloured leaves,  these in spring being of a beautiful bronzy tint, and changing towards  summer to a mixture of gold and green, or rather an irregular margin of  deep gold surrounds each leaf. It was first sent out by the famous  Berlin nurseryman whose name it bears. C. alba Gouchaulti is another  variegated leaved variety, but has no particular merit, and originated  in one of the French nurseries.    C. ALTERNIFOLIA.--North America, 1760. This species is a lover of damp  ground, and grows from 20 feet to nearly 30 feet high, with clusters of  pale yellow flowers, succeeded by bluish-black berries that render the  plant highly ornamental. It is still rare in British gardens.    C. AMOMUM (_syn C. sericea_).--From the eastern United States. It is a  low-growing, damp-loving shrub, with yellowish-white flowers, borne  abundantly in small clusters. It grows about 8 feet in height, and has  a graceful habit, owing to the long and lithe branches spreading  regularly over the ground. The fruit is pale blue, and the bark a  conspicuous purple.    C. ASPERIFOLIA is another showy American species, with reddish-brown  bark, hairy leaves, of small size, and rather small flowers that are  succeeded by pearly-white berries borne on conspicuous reddish stalks.    C. BAILEYI resembles somewhat the better-known C. stolonifera, but it  is of more erect habit, is not stoloniferous, has rather woolly leaves,  at least on the under side, and bears yellowish-white fruit. It grows  in sandy soil, and is a native of Canada.    C. CALIFORNICA (_syn C. pubescens_) grows fully 10 feet high, with  smooth branches, hairy branchlets, and cymes of pretty white flowers,  succeeded by white fruit. It occurs from southern California to British  Columbia.    C. CANADENSIS.--Dwarf Cornel or Birchberry. Canada, 1774. This is of  herbaceous growth, and remarkable for the large cream-coloured flower  bracts, and showy red fruit.    C. CANDIDISSIMA (_syn C. paniculata_) is a beautiful American species,  with panicled clusters of almost pure white flowers, that are succeeded  by pale blue fruit. It is a small growing tree, with narrow, pointed  leaves, and greyish coloured, smooth bark. Like many of its fellows,  this species likes rather moist ground.    C. CIRCINATA, from the eastern United States, is readily distinguished  by its large, round leaves, these sometimes measuring 6 inches long by  3-1/2 inches wide. The yellowish-white flowers are individually small,  and succeeded by bright blue fruits, each as large as a pea.    C. CAPITATA (_syn Benthamia fragifera_).--Nepaul, 1825. An evergreen  shrub, with oblong, light green leaves and terminal"]]]
