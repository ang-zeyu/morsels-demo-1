The astonishment of the world was at its pitch when the champion of  Abolition, the steady ally of Thomas Clarkson and Granville Sharpe, the  _Edinburgh Review_, was seen attempting to rescue these parties, and  taking part against the injured man, the patriarch of a cause defended  by that celebrated Journal during a brilliant period of much above  thirty years. The boldness displayed in its pages on this occasion was  excessive. As if feeling that the weak and indefensible part in the  assault was the publishing of the letters, it had the confidence to  affirm, that this proceeding was called for in justice to Wilberforce's  memory. So daring an attempt upon the integrity of facts has not often  been witnessed. What! The publication of these letters, which had no  possible connexion with Wilberforce's character, (a character, indeed,  that no one had assailed,) letters which were absolutely foreign even to  the question of priority in the abolition cause,--the publication of  these necessary to the defence of Wilberforce? Then, upon what ground  necessary? How had he been attacked? Where was he to be defended? But,  if attacked, how did the letters aid,--how connect themselves  with,--how, in any manner of way, bear upon the defence, or any defence,  or any portion of Wilberforce's character and life? They showed him to  have contributed towards the payment of a debt he had contracted to  Clarkson. But who had ever charged him with refusing to pay his debts?  With his merits as to the Abolition, (if that be what is meant by his  character,)--merits which it was a mere fabrication to pretend that  Clarkson had ever been slow to acknowledge,--those letters had  absolutely no possible connexion; and whoever, on this score, affects to  defend this publication, is capable of vindicating the printing any  private letter upon the most delicate subject, by any man who writes the  history of any other affair, or who writes on any subject from which the  correspondence is wholly foreign. It is proper to add, that the editors  of this Journal have most properly published a retractation of the  charges made, in their ignorance of the whole facts of the case.    The acute and sagacious editor of T. Clarkson's vindication, has given  his reasons for suspecting that this criticism, in the _Edinburgh  Review_, must have proceeded from some party directly concerned in the  publication of Wilberforce's life. We enter into no discussion of the  circumstantial evidence adduced in favour of this supposition. The  editors of the Journal are the parties to whom we look; and as they,  after being to all appearance misled by some partial writer, have made  the best reparation for an involuntary error, by doing justice to the  injured party, we can have no further remark to make upon the subject.    But it is impossible to close these pages without mentioning the  extraordinary merit of this latest, and, in all likelihood, this last  production of Clarkson's pen. It is indeed a most able performance, and  has been admired by some of the ablest controversial writers of the age,  as a model of excellence in controversial writing. Plain, vigorous,  convincing, perfectly calm and temperate, devoid of all acrimony, barely  saying enough to repel unjust aggression without one word of  retaliation, never losing sight for a moment of its purely defensive  object, and accordingly, from the singleness of purpose with which that  object is pursued, attaining it with the most triumphant success,--no  wonder that the public judgment has been loudly and universally  pronounced in its favour, that its adversaries have been reduced to  absolute silence, that its author's name has been exalted even higher  than before it stood. But the wonder is to see such unimpaired vigour at  four-score years of age, after a life of unwearied labour, latterly  clouded by domestic calamity, and a spirit as young as ever in zeal for  justice, tempered only by the mellowness which the kindly heart spreads  over the fruits of the manly understanding.    There wanted no testimonials of esteem from his country to consummate  the venerable philanthropist's renown; yet these too have been added.  Various meetings have addressed their gratulations to him. Of these the  great corporation of London claims the first regard, and after  presenting him with the freedom of the city, they have ordered to be  erected in their hall, as a memorial of his extraordinary virtue, a  likeness of the mortal form of Thomas Clarkson.           *       *       *       *       *          HISTORY OF THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE TRADE.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER I.    No subject more pleasing than that of the removal of evils.--Evils  have existed almost from the beginning of the world; but there is a  power in our nature to counteract them--this power increased by  Christianity.--Of the evils removed by Christianity one of the  greatest is the Slave Trade.--The joy we ought to feel on its  abolition from a contemplation of the nature of it; and of the extent  of it; and of the difficulty of subduing it.--Usefulness also of the  contemplation of this subject.      I scarcely know of any subject, the contemplation of which is more  pleasing, than that of the correction or of the removal of any of the  acknowledged evils of life; for while we rejoice to think that the  sufferings of our fellow-creatures have been thus, in any instance,  relieved, we must rejoice equally to think, that our own moral condition  must have been necessarily improved by the change.    That evils, both physical and moral, have existed long upon earth there  can be no doubt. One of the sacred writers, to whom we more immediately  appeal for the early history of mankind, informs us that the state of  our first parents was a state of innocence and happiness; but that, soon  after their creation, sin and misery entered into the world. The poets  in their fables, most of which, however extravagant they may seem, had  their origin in truth, speak the same language. Some of these represent  the first condition of man by the figure of the golden, and his  subsequent degeneracy and subjection to suffering by that of the silver,  and afterwards of the iron age. Others tell us that the first female was  made of clay; that she was called Pandora, because every necessary gift,  qualification, or endowment, was given to her by the gods, but that she  received from Jupiter, at the same time, a box from which, when opened,  a multitude of disorders sprung, and that these spread themselves  immediately afterwards among all of the human race. Thus it appears,  whatever authorities we consult, that those which may be termed the  evils of life existed in the earliest times. And what does subsequent  history, combined with our own experience, tell us, but that these have  been continued, or that they have come down in different degrees through  successive generations of men, in all the known countries of the  universe, to the present day?    But though the inequality visible in the different conditions of life,  and the passions interwoven into our nature, (both which have been  allotted to us for wise purposes, and without which we could not easily  afford a proof of the existence of that, which is denominated virtue,)  have a tendency to produce vice and wretchedness among us, yet we see,  in this our constitution, what may operate partially as preventives and  corrective of them. If there be a radical propensity in our nature to do  that which is wrong, there is, on the other hand, a counteracting power  within it, or an impulse by means of the action of the divine Spirit  upon our minds, which urges us to do that which is right. If the voice  of temptation, clothed in musical and seducing accents, charms us one  way, the voice of holiness, speaking to us from within, in a solemn and  powerful manner, commands us another. Does one man obtain a victory over  his corrupt affections? an immediate perception of pleasure, like the  feeling of a reward divinely conferred upon him, is noticed. Does  another fall prostrate beneath their power? a painful feeling, and such  as pronounces to him the sentence of reproof and punishment is found to  follow. If one, by suffering his heart to become hardened, oppresses a  fellow-creature, the tear of sympathy starts up in the eye of another,  and the latter instantly feels a desire, involuntarily generated, of  flying to his relief. Thus impulses, feelings, and dispositions have  been implanted in our nature, for the purpose of preventing and  rectifying the evils of life. And as these have operated, so as to  stimulate some men to lessen them by the exercise of an amiable charity,  so they have operated to stimulate others in various other ways to the  same end. Hence the philosopher has left moral precepts behind him in  favour of benevolence, and the legislator has endeavoured to prevent  barbarous practices by the introduction of laws.    In consequence then of these impulses and feelings, by which the pure  power in our nature is thus made to act as a check upon the evil part of  it, and in consequence of the influence which philosophy and legislative  wisdom have had in their respective provinces, there has been always, in  all times and countries, a counteracting energy, which has opposed  itself, more or less, to the crimes and miseries of mankind. But it  seems to have been reserved for Christianity to increase this energy,  and to give it the widest possible domain. It was reserved for her,  under the same divine influence, to give the best views of the nature  and of the present and future condition of man; to afford the best moral  precepts, to communicate the most benign stimulus to the heart, to  produce the most blameless conduct, and thus to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10635"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 2 (#7)"],[1,"to the earth; and so, taking him by the  legs, and dragging him over the grass, his conqueror went the whole  circuit of the mead with him, the nymphs taking the very garlands off  their heads, and again scourging him with their white and red roses.[13]    At the close of this discipline, which left him more exhausted than  twenty battles, his enemies suddenly developed wings from their  shoulders, the feathers of which were of white and gold and vermilion,  every feather having an eye in it, not like those in the peacock's  feathers, but one full of life and motion, being a female eye, lovely and  gracious. And with these wings they poised themselves a little, and so  sprung up to heaven.[14]    The Paladin, more dead than alive, lay helpless among the flowers, when a  fourth nymph came up to him, of inexpressible beauty. She told him that  he had grievously offended the naked youth, who was no other than Love  himself; and added, that his only remedy was to be penitent, and to drink  of the waters of a stream hard by, which he would find running from the  roots of an olive-tree and a pine. With these words, she vanished in her  turn like the rest; and Rinaldo, dragging himself as well as he could to  the olive and pine, stooped down, and greedily drank of the water. Again  and again he drank, and wished still to be drinking, for it took not only  all pain out of his limbs, but all hate and bitterness out of his soul,  and produced such a remorseful and doating memory of Angelica, that he  would fain have galloped that instant to Cathay, and prostrated himself  at her feet. By degrees he knew the place; and looking round about him,  and preparing to remount his horse, he discerned a knight and a lady in  the distance. The knight was in a coat of armour unknown to him, and the  lady kneeling and drinking at a fountain, which was the one that had  formerly quenched his own thirst; to wit, the Fountain of Disdain.    Alas! it was Angelica herself; and the knight was Orlando. She had  allowed him to bring her into France, ostensibly for the purpose of  wedding him at the court of Charlemagne, whither the hero's assistance  had been called against Agramant king of the Moors, but secretly with the  object of discovering Rinaldo. Rinaldo, behold! is discovered; but the  fatal averse water has been drunk, and Angelica now hates him in turn, as  cordially as he detested her. In vain he accosted her in the humblest and  most repentant manner, calling himself the unworthiest of mankind, and  entreating to be allowed to love her. Orlando, disclosing himself,  fiercely interrupted him; and a combat so terrific ensued, that Angelica  fled away on her palfrey till she came to a large plain, in which she  beheld an army encamped.    The army was Charlemagne's, who had come to meet Rodamonte, one of the  vassals of Agramant. Angelica, in a tremble, related how she had left the  two Paladins fighting in the wood; and Charlemagne, who was delighted to  find Orlando so near him, proceeded thither with his lords, and parting  the combatants by his royal authority, suppressed the dispute between  them for the present, by consigning the object of their contention to the  care of Namo duke of Bavaria, with the understanding that she was to be  the prize of the warrior who should best deserve her in the approaching  battle with the infidels.    [This is the last we hear of Angelica in the unfinished poem of Boiardo.  For the close of her history see its continuation by Ariosto in the  present volume.]      [Footnote 1: \"Con parlar basso e bei ragionamenti.\"]    [Footnote 2: _Video meliora, proboque, &c._ Writers were now beginning  to pride themselves on their classical reading. The present occasion,  it must be owned, was a very good one for introducing the passage from  Horace. The previous words have an affecting ingenuousness; and, indeed,  the whole stanza is beautiful:      \"Io non mi posso dal cor dipartire      La dolce vista del viso sereno,    Perch'io mi sento senza lei morire,      E 'l spirto a poco a poco venir meno.    Or non mi vale forza, ne l'ardire      Contra d' amor, the m' ha gia posto il freno;    Ne mi giova saper, ne altrui consiglio:    Il meglio veggio, ed al peggior m'appiglio.\"      Alas! I cannot, though I shut mine eyes,      Lose the sweet look of that delightful face;    The very soul within me droops and dies,      To think that I may fail to gain her grace.    No strong limbs now, no valour, will suffice      To burst the spell that roots me to the place:    No, nor reflection, nor advice, nor force;    I see the better part, and clasp the worse.]    [Footnote 3:    [Greek: Argureais logchaisi machou, kai panta krataeseis.]      \"Make war with silver spears, and you'll beat all.\"    The reader will note the allegory or not, as he pleases. It is a very  good allegory; but allegory, by the due process of enchantment, becomes  matter of fact; and it is pleasant to take it as such.]    [Footnote 4: \"Re Galagron, il maledetto cane\"]    [Footnote 5: The lions in the shield of England were leopards in the  \"olden time,\" and it is understood, I believe, ought still to be so,--as  Napoleon, with an invidious pedantry, once permitted himself to be angry  enough to inform us.]    [Footnote 6: The character of Astolfo, the germ of which is in our own  ancient British romances, appears to have been completed by the lively  invention of Boiardo, and is a curious epitome of almost all which has  been discerned in the travelled Englishmen by the envy of poorer and the  wit of livelier foreigners. He has the handsomeness and ostentation of a  Buckingham, the wealth of a Beckford, the generosity of a Carlisle, the  invincible pretensions of a Crichton, the self-commitals and bravery of  a Digby, the lucklessness of a Stuart, and the _nonchalance_ \"under  difficulties\" of \"_Milord What-then_\" in Voltaire's _Princess of  Babylon_, where the noble traveller is discovered philosophically reading  the news-paper in his carriage after it was overturned. English beauty,  ever since the days of Pope Gregory, with his pun about Angles and  Angels, has been greatly admired in the south of Europe--not a little,  perhaps, on account of the general fairness of its complexion. I once  heard a fair-faced English gentleman, who would have been thought rather  effeminate looking at home, called an \"Angel\" by a lady in Genoa.]    [Footnote 7:      \"Stava disciolto, senza guardia alcuna,    Ed intorno a la fonte sollazzava;    Angelica nel lume de la luna,    Quanto potea nascosa, lo mirava.\"    There is something wonderfully soft and _lunar_ in the liquid monotony of  the third line.]    [Footnote 8:      \"La qual dormiva in atto tanto adorno,    Che pensar non si puo, non ch'io lo scriva    Parea che l'erba a lei fiorisse intorno,    E d'amor ragionasse quella riva.\"      Her posture, as she lay, was exquisite    Above all words--nay, thought itself above:    The grass seemed flowering round her in delight,    And the soft river murmuring of love.]    [Footnote 9: Supremely elegant all this appears to me.]    [Footnote 10: Sometimes called in the romances _Frusberta_ (query, from  _fourbir_, to burnish; or, _froisser_, to crush?). The meaning does not  seem to be known. I ought to have observed, in the notes to Pulci, that  the name of Orlando's sword, _Durlindana_ (called also _Durindana,  Durandal_, &c.), is understood to mean _Hardhitter_.]    [Footnote 11: The force of aversion was surely never better imagined than  in this scene of the opened arms of beauty, and the knight's preference  of the most odious death.]    [Footnote 12: Legalised, I presume, by a divorce from the hero's wife,  the fair Alda; who, though she is generally designated by that epithet,  seems never to have had much of his attention.]    [Footnote 13: This violent effect of weapons so extremely gentle is  beautifully conceived.]    [Footnote 14: The \"female eye, lovely and gracious,\" is charmingly  painted _per se_, but of this otherwise thoroughly beautiful description  I must venture to doubt, whether _living_ eyes of any sort, instead of  those in the peacock's feathers, are in good taste. The imagination  revolts from life misplaced.]      THE    DEATH OF AGRICAN    Argument.    Agrican king of Tartary, in love with Angelica, and baffled by the  prowess of the unknown Orlando in his attempts to bring the siege of  Albracca to a favourable conclusion, entices him apart from the battle  into a wood, in the hope of killing him in single combat. The combat is  suspended by the arrival of night-time; and a conversation ensues between  the warriors, which is furiously interrupted by Agrican's discovery of  his rival, and the latter's refusal to renounce his love. Agrican is  slain; and in his dying moments requests baptism at the hand of his  conqueror, who, with great tenderness, bestows it.    THE    DEATH OF AGRICAN.    The siege of Albracca was going on formidably under the command of  Agrican, and the city of Galafron was threatened with the loss of the  monarch's daughter, Angelica, when Orlando, at his earnest prayer, came  to assist him, and changing at once the whole course of the war, threw  the enemy in his turn into transports of anxiety. Wherever the great  Paladin came, pennon and standard fell before him. Men were cut up and  cloven down, at every stroke of his sword; and whereas the Indians had  been in full rout but a moment before, and the Tartars ever on their  flanks, Galafron himself being the swiftest among the spurrers away, it  was now the Tartars that fled for their lives; for Orlando was there, and  a band of fresh knights were about him, and Agrican in vain attempted to  rally his troops. The Paladin kept him constantly in his front, forcing  him to attend to nobody else. The Tartar king, who cared not a button for  Galafron and all his army,[1] provided he could but rid himself of this  terrible knight (whom he guessed at, but"]]]
