Tying his pony to one of the projecting corner logs of the  low-roofed cottage, he stepped upon the wooden doorstep.    I met him there with a hurried greeting, and, as I passed by, he looked  a quiet \"What?\" into my eyes.    When he began talking with my mother, I slipped the rope from the pony's  bridle. Seizing the reins and bracing my feet against the dashboard, I  wheeled around in an instant. The pony was ever ready to try his speed.  Looking backward, I saw Dawee waving his hand to me. I turned with the  curve in the road and disappeared. I followed the winding road which  crawled upward between the bases of little hillocks. Deep water-worn  ditches ran parallel on either side. A strong wind blew against my  cheeks and fluttered my sleeves. The pony reached the top of the highest  hill, and began an even race on the level lands. There was nothing  moving within that great circular horizon of the Dakota prairies save  the tall grasses, over which the wind blew and rolled off in long,  shadowy waves.    Within this vast wigwam of blue and green I rode reckless and  insignificant. It satisfied my small consciousness to see the white foam  fly from the pony's mouth.    Suddenly, out of the earth a coyote came forth at a swinging trot that  was taking the cunning thief toward the hills and the village beyond.  Upon the moment's impulse, I gave him a long chase and a wholesome  fright. As I turned away to go back to the village, the wolf sank down  upon his haunches for rest, for it was a hot summer day; and as I drove  slowly homeward, I saw his sharp nose still pointed at me, until I  vanished below the margin of the hilltops.    In a little while I came in sight of my mother's house. Dawee stood in  the yard, laughing at an old warrior who was pointing his forefinger,  and again waving his whole hand, toward the hills. With his blanket  drawn over one shoulder, he talked and motioned excitedly. Dawee turned  the old man by the shoulder and pointed me out to him.    \"Oh, han!\" (Oh, yes) the warrior muttered, and went his way. He had  climbed the top of his favorite barren hill to survey the surrounding  prairies, when he spied my chase after the coyote. His keen eyes  recognized the pony and driver. At once uneasy for my safety, he had  come running to my mother's cabin to give her warning. I did not  appreciate his kindly interest, for there was an unrest gnawing at my  heart.    As soon as he went away, I asked Dawee about something else.    \"No, my baby sister, I cannot take you with me to the party tonight,\" he  replied. Though I was not far from fifteen, and I felt that before long  I should enjoy all the privileges of my tall cousin, Dawee persisted in  calling me his baby sister.    That moonlight night, I cried in my mother's presence when I heard the  jolly young people pass by our cottage. They were no more young braves  in blankets and eagle plumes, nor Indian maids with prettily painted  cheeks. They had gone three years to school in the East, and had become  civilized. The young men wore the white man's coat and trousers, with  bright neckties. The girls wore tight muslin dresses, with ribbons at  neck and waist. At these gatherings they talked English. I could speak  English almost as well as my brother, but I was not properly dressed to  be taken along. I had no hat, no ribbons, and no close-fitting gown.  Since my return from school I had thrown away my shoes, and wore again  the soft moccasins.    While Dawee was busily preparing to go I controlled my tears. But when I  heard him bounding away on his pony, I buried my face in my arms and  cried hot tears.    My mother was troubled by my unhappiness. Coming to my side, she offered  me the only printed matter we had in our home. It was an Indian Bible,  given her some years ago by a missionary. She tried to console me.  \"Here, my child, are the white man's papers. Read a little from them,\"  she said most piously.    I took it from her hand, for her sake; but my enraged spirit felt more  like burning the book, which afforded me no help, and was a perfect  delusion to my mother. I did not read it, but laid it unopened on the  floor, where I sat on my feet. The dim yellow light of the braided  muslin burning in a small vessel of oil flickered and sizzled in the  awful silent storm which followed my rejection of the Bible.    Now my wrath against the fates consumed my tears before they reached my  eyes. I sat stony, with a bowed head. My mother threw a shawl over her  head and shoulders, and stepped out into the night.    After an uncertain solitude, I was suddenly aroused by a loud cry  piercing the night. It was my mother's voice wailing among the barren  hills which held the bones of buried warriors. She called aloud for her  brothers' spirits to support her in her helpless misery. My fingers Grey  icy cold, as I realized that my unrestrained tears had betrayed my  suffering to her, and she was grieving for me.    Before she returned, though I knew she was on her way, for she had  ceased her weeping, I extinguished the light, and leaned my head on the  window sill.    Many schemes of running away from my surroundings hovered about in my  mind. A few more moons of such a turmoil drove me away to the eastern  school. I rode on the white man's iron steed, thinking it would bring me  back to my mother in a few winters, when I should be grown tall, and  there would be congenial friends awaiting me.          VII.    INCURRING MY MOTHER'S DISPLEASURE.      In the second journey to the East I had not come without some  precautions. I had a secret interview with one of our best medicine men,  and when I left his wigwam I carried securely in my sleeve a tiny bunch  of magic roots. This possession assured me of friends wherever I should  go. So absolutely did I believe in its charms that I wore it through all  the school routine for more than a year. Then, before I lost my faith in  the dead roots, I lost the little buckskin bag containing all my good  luck.    At the close of this second term of three years I was the proud owner of  my first diploma. The following autumn I ventured upon a college career  against my mother's will.    I had written for her approval, but in her reply I found no  encouragement. She called my notice to her neighbors' children, who had  completed their education in three years. They had returned to their  homes, and were then talking English with the frontier settlers. Her few  words hinted that I had better give up my slow attempt to learn the  white man's ways, and be content to roam over the prairies and find my  living upon wild roots. I silenced her by deliberate disobedience.    Thus, homeless and heavy-hearted, I began anew my life among strangers.    As I hid myself in my little room in the college dormitory, away from  the scornful and yet curious eyes of the students, I pined for sympathy.  Often I wept in secret, wishing I had gone West, to be nourished by my  mother's love, instead of remaining among a cold race whose hearts were  frozen hard with prejudice.    During the fall and winter seasons I scarcely had a real friend, though  by that time several of my classmates were courteous to me at a safe  distance.    My mother had not yet forgiven my rudeness to her, and I had no moment  for letter-writing. By daylight and lamplight, I spun with reeds and  thistles, until my hands were tired from their weaving, the magic design  which promised me the white man's respect.    At length, in the spring term, I entered an oratorical contest among the  various classes. As the day of competition approached, it did not seem  possible that the event was so near at hand, but it came. In the chapel  the classes assembled together, with their invited guests. The high  platform was carpeted, and gaily festooned with college colors. A bright  white light illumined the room, and outlined clearly the great polished  beams that arched the domed ceiling. The assembled crowds filled the air  with pulsating murmurs. When the hour for speaking arrived all were  hushed. But on the wall the old clock which pointed out the trying  moment ticked calmly on.    One after another I saw and heard the orators. Still, I could not  realize that they longed for the favorable decision of the judges as  much as I did. Each contestant received a loud burst of applause, and  some were cheered heartily. Too soon my turn came, and I paused a moment  behind the curtains for a deep breath. After my concluding words, I  heard the same applause that the others had called out.    Upon my retreating steps, I was astounded to receive from my  fellow-students a large bouquet of roses tied with flowing ribbons.  With the lovely flowers I fled from the stage. This friendly token was  a rebuke to me for the hard feelings I had borne them.    Later, the decision of the judges awarded me the first place. Then there  was a mad uproar in the hall, where my classmates sang and shouted my  name at the top of their lungs; and the disappointed students howled and  brayed in fearfully dissonant tin trumpets. In this excitement, happy  students rushed forward to offer their congratulations. And I could not  conceal a smile when they wished to escort me in a procession to the  students' parlor, where all were going to calm themselves. Thanking them  for the kind spirit which prompted them to make such a proposition, I  walked alone with the night to my own little room.    A few weeks afterward, I appeared as the college representative in  another contest. This time the competition was among orators from  different colleges in our State. It was held at the State capital, in  one of the largest opera houses.    Here again was a strong prejudice against my people. In the evening, as  the great audience filled the house, the student bodies began warring  among themselves.

All they dreaded sore. Also  Abimelech called Abraham and said to him: What hast thou done to us,  that we have trespassed to thee? Thou hast caused me and my realm to sin  greatly. Thou hast done that thou shouldst not have done. What sawest  thou for to do so? Abraham said: I thought that the dread of God was not  in this place, and that ye would slay me for my wife; and certainly  otherwise she is also my sister, the daughter of my father but not of my  mother, and I have wedded her. And after that I went from the house of  my father, I said to her: Wheresomever we go say thou art my sister.    Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen and servants and maidens, and gave to  Abraham, and delivered to him Sarah his wife, and said: Lo! the land is  here tofore thee, wheresoever thou wilt, dwell and abide. And he said to  Sarah: Lo! I have given to thy brother a thousand pieces of silver, this  shall be to thee a veil of thine eyes, and wheresomever thou go,  remember that thou wert taken. Abraham prayed for Abimelech and his  meiny [company] and God healed him, his wife and all his servants. Our  Lord then visited Sarah, and she brought forth a son in her old age,  that same time that God had promised. Abraham called his son that she  had borne, Isaac, and when he was eight days old he circumcised him as  God had commanded, and Abraham was then an hundred years old. Then said  Sarah: Who would have supposed that I should give suck to my child,  being so old? I laughed when I heard our Lord say so, and all they that  shall hear of it may well laugh. The child grew and was weaned, and  Abraham made a great feast at the day of his weaning. After this, on a  day when Sarah saw the son of Hagar her handmaid play with her son  Isaac, she said to Abraham: Cast out this handmaid with her son, the son  of the handmaid shall not be heir with my son Isaac. Abraham took this  word hard and grievously for his son. Then said God to him: Let it not  be hard to thee for thy son and handmaid, whatsomever Sarah say to thee  hear her voice, for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. Yet shall I make  the son of the handmaid grow into great people, for he is of thy seed.  Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water,  and laid it on her shoulder, and gave to her the child and let her go,  which, when she was departed, erred in the wilderness of Beersheba. And  when the water was consumed that was in the bottle, she left the child  under a tree that was there and went thence as far as a bow shot and sat  her down, and said: I shall not see my son die, and there she wept. Our  Lord heard the voice of the child, and an angel called Hagar saying,  What doest thou, Hagar? Be not afeard, our Lord hath heard the voice of  the child from the place which he is now in. Arise and take the child  and hold him by the hand, for I shall make him to increase into much  people. God opened her eyes and she saw a pit of water, and anon she  went and filled the bottle, and gave the child to drink, and abode with  him, which grew and dwelled in the wilderness, and became there a young  man and an archer, and dwelled also in the desert of Paran. And his  mother took to him a wife of the land of Egypt.    That same time said Abimelech, and Phicol the prince of his host, unto  Abraham: Our Lord is with thee in all things that thou doest. Swear thou  by the Lord that thou grieve not me, ne them that shall come after me,  ne my kindred, but after the mercy that I have showed to thee, so do to  me and to my land in which thou hast dwelled as a stranger. And Abraham  said, I shall swear. And he blamed Abimelech for the pit of water which  his servants had taken away by strength. Abimelech answered: I know not  who hath done this thing, and thou toldest me not thereof, and I never  heard thereof till this day. And then after this they made covenant  together, and promised each to other to be friends together.    After all these things God tempted Abraham, and said to him: Abraham,  Abraham. He answered and said: I am here, and he said to him: Take thou  thine only son that thou lovest, Isaac, and go into the land of Vision  and offer him in sacrifice to me upon one of the hills that I shall show  to thee. Then Abraham arose in the night, and made ready his ass, and  took with him two young men and Isaac his son. And when they had hewn  and gathered the wood together to make sacrifice, they went to the  place that God commanded him. The third day after, he lift up his eyes  and saw from afar the place, and he said to his children: Abide ye here  with the ass, I and my son shall go to yonder place, and when we have  worshipped there we shall return to you. Then he took the wood of the  sacrifice and laid it on his son Isaac, and he bare in his hands fire  and the sword. And as they went both together, Isaac said to his father:  Father mine. What wilt thou, my son? said Abraham, and he said: Lo! here  is fire and wood, where is the sacrifice that shall be offered? Abraham  answered: My son, God shall provide for him a sacrifice well enough.  They went forth and came to the place that God had ordained, and there  made an altar, and laid the wood thereon, and took Isaac and set him on  the wood on the altar, and took his sword and would have offered him up  to God. And lo! the angel of God cried to him from heaven saying:  Abraham, Abraham, which answered: I am here, and he said to him: Extend  not thy hand upon my child, and do nothing to him, now I know that thou  dreadest God, and hast not spared thine only son for me. Abraham looked  behind him, and saw among the briars a ram fast by the horns, which he  took, and offered him in sacrifice for his son. He called that place:  The Lord seeth. The angel called Abraham the second time saying: I have  sworn by myself, saith the Lord, because thou hast done this thing, and  hast not spared thine only son for me, I shall bless thee and shall  multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and like the gravel that is  on the seaside, thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies, and  in thy seed shall be blessed all the people of the earth, for thou  obeyedst to me. Abraham then returned to his servants, and went into  Beersheba and dwelled there. Sarah lived an hundred and twenty-seven  years and died in the city of Arba, which is Hebron in the land of  Canaan; for whom Abraham made sorrow and wept, and bought of the  children of Heth a field, and buried her worshipfully in a double  spelunke.    Abraham was an old man, and God blessed him in all his things. He said  to the eldest and upperest servant in all his house: I charge and  conjure thee by the name of God of heaven and of earth that thou suffer  not my son Isaac to take no wife of the daughters of Canaan amongst whom  I dwell, but go into the country where my kindred is, and take of them a  wife to my son. And the servant answered: If no woman there will come  with me into this country, shall I bring thy son into that country from  whence thou earnest? Abraham said: Beware that thou lead not my son  thither. The Lord of heaven and of earth, that took me from the house of  my father and from the place of my nativity, hath said and sworn to me,  saying: To thy seed I shall give this land. He shall send his angel  tofore thee, and thou shalt take there a wife for my son. If no woman  will come with thee thou shalt not be bounden by thine oath, but in no  wise lead my son thither. His servant then swore and promised to him  that he would so do.    He took ten camels of the flock of his lord, and of all his goods bare  with him, and went in to Mesopotamia unto the town of Nahor. And he made  the camels to tarry without the town by a pit side at such time as the  women be wont to come out for to draw water. And there he prayed our  Lord, saying: Lord God of my lord Abraham, I beseech thee to help me  this day, and do mercy unto my lord Abraham. Lo! I stand here nigh by  the well of water, and the daughters of the dwellers of this town come  hither for to draw water, therefore the maid to whom I say: Set down thy  pot that I may drink, and then she set down her pot and say: I will give  to thee drink, and to the camels, that I may understand thereby that she  be the maid that thou hast ordained to thy servant Isaac, and thou  showest thy mercy to my lord Abraham. He had not fully finished these  words with himself, but that Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah  wife of Nahor, brother of Abraham, came out of the town, having a pot on  her shoulder, which was a right fair maid, and much beauteous and  unknown to the man. She went down to the well and filled her pot with  water and returned. The servant of Abraham ran to her and said: I pray  thee to give me a little of the water in thy pot for to drink. Which  said: Drink, my lord, and lightly took the pot from her shoulder, and  held it, and gave him drink. And when he had drunk she said: Yet I shall  give to thy camels drink, and draw water for them till all have drunken;  and she poured out the water into a vessel that was there for beasts to  drink, and ran to the pit and drew water that every one drank his  draught. He then thought in himself secretly that God had made him to  have a prosperous journey.    After they had drunk, he gave her two rings to hang on her ears weighing  two shekels, and as many armlets weighing ten shekels, and asked her  whose daughter she was, and if there were any room in her father's house  to be lodged. And she answered: I am daughter to Bethuel, Nahor's son,  and in my father's house is place enough to lodge thee and thy camels,  and plenty of chaff and hay for them. And the man inclined down to the  ground and worshipped God saying: Blessed be the Lord God of my lord  Abraham, which hath not taken away his mercy ne his truth from my lord,  and hath brought me in my "]]]
