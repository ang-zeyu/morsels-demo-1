I fell asleep in  her arms, after that, and slept soundly.    Whether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman again,  or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared,  I cannot recall. I don't profess to be clear about dates. But there he  was, in church, and he walked home with us afterwards. He came in, too,  to look at a famous geranium we had, in the parlour-window. It did not  appear to me that he took much notice of it, but before he went he asked  my mother to give him a bit of the blossom. She begged him to choose it  for himself, but he refused to do that--I could not understand why--so  she plucked it for him, and gave it into his hand. He said he would  never, never part with it any more; and I thought he must be quite a  fool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two.    Peggotty began to be less with us, of an evening, than she had always  been. My mother deferred to her very much--more than usual, it occurred  to me--and we were all three excellent friends; still we were different  from what we used to be, and were not so comfortable among ourselves.  Sometimes I fancied that Peggotty perhaps objected to my mother's  wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers, or to her  going so often to visit at that neighbour's; but I couldn't, to my  satisfaction, make out how it was.    Gradually, I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black  whiskers. I liked him no better than at first, and had the same uneasy  jealousy of him; but if I had any reason for it beyond a child's  instinctive dislike, and a general idea that Peggotty and I could make  much of my mother without any help, it certainly was not THE reason that  I might have found if I had been older. No such thing came into my mind,  or near it. I could observe, in little pieces, as it were; but as to  making a net of a number of these pieces, and catching anybody in it,  that was, as yet, beyond me.    One autumn morning I was with my mother in the front garden, when Mr.  Murdstone--I knew him by that name now--came by, on horseback. He reined  up his horse to salute my mother, and said he was going to Lowestoft to  see some friends who were there with a yacht, and merrily proposed to  take me on the saddle before him if I would like the ride.    The air was so clear and pleasant, and the horse seemed to like the  idea of the ride so much himself, as he stood snorting and pawing at the  garden-gate, that I had a great desire to go. So I was sent upstairs  to Peggotty to be made spruce; and in the meantime Mr. Murdstone  dismounted, and, with his horse's bridle drawn over his arm, walked  slowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence, while my  mother walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company. I  recollect Peggotty and I peeping out at them from my little window; I  recollect how closely they seemed to be examining the sweetbriar between  them, as they strolled along; and how, from being in a perfectly angelic  temper, Peggotty turned cross in a moment, and brushed my hair the wrong  way, excessively hard.    Mr. Murdstone and I were soon off, and trotting along on the green turf  by the side of the road. He held me quite easily with one arm, and I  don't think I was restless usually; but I could not make up my mind to  sit in front of him without turning my head sometimes, and looking up in  his face. He had that kind of shallow black eye--I want a better word to  express an eye that has no depth in it to be looked into--which, when  it is abstracted, seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured,  for a moment at a time, by a cast. Several times when I glanced at him,  I observed that appearance with a sort of awe, and wondered what he  was thinking about so closely. His hair and whiskers were blacker and  thicker, looked at so near, than even I had given them credit for being.  A squareness about the lower part of his face, and the dotted indication  of the strong black beard he shaved close every day, reminded me of  the wax-work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-year  before. This, his regular eyebrows, and the rich white, and black, and  brown, of his complexion--confound his complexion, and his memory!--made  me think him, in spite of my misgivings, a very handsome man. I have no  doubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too.    We went to an hotel by the sea, where two gentlemen were smoking cigars  in a room by themselves. Each of them was lying on at least four chairs,  and had a large rough jacket on. In a corner was a heap of coats and  boat-cloaks, and a flag, all bundled up together.    They both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner, when we  came in, and said, 'Halloa, Murdstone! We thought you were dead!'    'Not yet,' said Mr. Murdstone.    'And who's this shaver?' said one of the gentlemen, taking hold of me.    'That's Davy,' returned Mr. Murdstone.    'Davy who?' said the gentleman. 'Jones?'    'Copperfield,' said Mr. Murdstone.    'What! Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield's encumbrance?' cried the gentleman.  'The pretty little widow?'    'Quinion,' said Mr. Murdstone, 'take care, if you please. Somebody's  sharp.'    'Who is?' asked the gentleman, laughing. I looked up, quickly; being  curious to know.    'Only Brooks of Sheffield,' said Mr. Murdstone.    I was quite relieved to find that it was only Brooks of Sheffield; for,  at first, I really thought it was I.    There seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of Mr.  Brooks of Sheffield, for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he  was mentioned, and Mr. Murdstone was a good deal amused also. After some  laughing, the gentleman whom he had called Quinion, said:    'And what is the opinion of Brooks of Sheffield, in reference to the  projected business?'    'Why, I don't know that Brooks understands much about it at present,'  replied Mr. Murdstone; 'but he is not generally favourable, I believe.'    There was more laughter at this, and Mr. Quinion said he would ring the  bell for some sherry in which to drink to Brooks. This he did; and when  the wine came, he made me have a little, with a biscuit, and, before  I drank it, stand up and say, 'Confusion to Brooks of Sheffield!' The  toast was received with great applause, and such hearty laughter that  it made me laugh too; at which they laughed the more. In short, we quite  enjoyed ourselves.    We walked about on the cliff after that, and sat on the grass, and  looked at things through a telescope--I could make out nothing myself  when it was put to my eye, but I pretended I could--and then we came  back to the hotel to an early dinner. All the time we were out, the two  gentlemen smoked incessantly--which, I thought, if I might judge from  the smell of their rough coats, they must have been doing, ever since  the coats had first come home from the tailor's. I must not forget that  we went on board the yacht, where they all three descended into the  cabin, and were busy with some papers. I saw them quite hard at work,  when I looked down through the open skylight. They left me, during this  time, with a very nice man with a very large head of red hair and a very  small shiny hat upon it, who had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat  on, with 'Skylark' in capital letters across the chest. I thought it was  his name; and that as he lived on board ship and hadn't a street door  to put his name on, he put it there instead; but when I called him Mr.  Skylark, he said it meant the vessel.    I observed all day that Mr. Murdstone was graver and steadier than the  two gentlemen. They were very gay and careless. They joked freely with  one another, but seldom with him. It appeared to me that he was  more clever and cold than they were, and that they regarded him with  something of my own feeling. I remarked that, once or twice when Mr.  Quinion was talking, he looked at Mr. Murdstone sideways, as if to make  sure of his not being displeased; and that once when Mr. Passnidge (the  other gentleman) was in high spirits, he trod upon his foot, and gave  him a secret caution with his eyes, to observe Mr. Murdstone, who was  sitting stern and silent. Nor do I recollect that Mr. Murdstone laughed  at all that day, except at the Sheffield joke--and that, by the by, was  his own.    We went home early in the evening. It was a very fine evening, and my  mother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar, while I was sent in  to get my tea. When he was gone, my mother asked me all about the day I  had had, and what they had said and done. I mentioned what they had said  about her, and she laughed, and told me they were impudent fellows who  talked nonsense--but I knew it pleased her. I knew it quite as well as  I know it now. I took the opportunity of asking if she was at all  acquainted with Mr. Brooks of Sheffield, but she answered No, only she  supposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork way.    Can I say of her face--altered as I have reason to remember it, perished  as I know it is--that it is gone, when here it comes before me at this  instant, as distinct as any face that I may choose to look on in a  crowded street? Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it  faded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it  fell that night? Can I say she ever changed, when my remembrance brings  her back to life, thus only; and, truer to its loving youth than I have  been, or man ever is, still holds fast what it cherished then?    I write of her just as she was when I had gone to bed after this talk,  and she came to bid me good night. She kneeled down playfully by the  side of the bed, and laying her chin upon her hands, and laughing, said:    'What was it they said, Davy? Tell me again. I can't believe it.'    '\"Bewitching--\"' I began.    My mother put her hands"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/770"],[0,"The Story of the Treasure Seekers (#6)"],[1,"a book a boy  at school was going to write when he had time. Besides this there were  the 'Lines on a Dead Black Beetle that was poisoned'--        O Beetle how I weep to see         Thee lying on thy poor back!      It is so very sad indeed.         You were so shiny and black.      I wish you were alive again      But Eliza says wishing it is nonsense and a shame.    It was very good beetle poison, and there were hundreds of them lying  dead--but Noel only wrote a piece of poetry for one of them. He said he  hadn't time to do them all, and the worst of it was he didn't know which  one he'd written it to--so Alice couldn't bury the beetle and put the  lines on its grave, though she wanted to very much.    Well, it was quite plain that there wasn't enough poetry for a book.    'We might wait a year or two,' said Noel. 'I shall be sure to make some  more some time. I thought of a piece about a fly this morning that knew  condensed milk was sticky.'    'But we want the money _now_,' said Dicky, 'and you can go on writing  just the same. It will come in some time or other.'    'There's poetry in newspapers,' said Alice. 'Down, Pincher! you'll never  be a clever dog, so it's no good trying.'    'Do they pay for it?' Dicky thought of that; he often thinks of things  that are really important, even if they are a little dull.    'I don't know. But I shouldn't think any one would let them print their  poetry without. I wouldn't I know.' That was Dora; but Noel said he  wouldn't mind if he didn't get paid, so long as he saw his poetry  printed and his name at the end.    'We might try, anyway,' said Oswald. He is always willing to give other  people's ideas a fair trial.    So we copied out 'The Wreck of the Malabar' and the other six poems on  drawing-paper--Dora did it, she writes best--and Oswald drew a picture  of the Malabar going down with all hands. It was a full-rigged schooner,  and all the ropes and sails were correct; because my cousin is in the  Navy, and he showed me.    We thought a long time whether we'd write a letter and send it by post  with the poetry--and Dora thought it would be best. But Noel said he  couldn't bear not to know at once if the paper would print the poetry,  So we decided to take it.    I went with Noel, because I am the eldest, and he is not old enough to  go to London by himself. Dicky said poetry was rot--and he was glad he  hadn't got to make a fool of himself. That was because there was not  enough money for him to go with us. H. O. couldn't come either, but  he came to the station to see us off, and waved his cap and called out  'Good hunting!' as the train started.    There was a lady in spectacles in the corner. She was writing with a  pencil on the edges of long strips of paper that had print all down  them. When the train started she asked--    'What was that he said?'    So Oswald answered--    'It was \"Good hunting\"--it's out of the Jungle Book!' 'That's very  pleasant to hear,' the lady said; 'I am very pleased to meet people who  know their Jungle Book. And where are you off to--the Zoological Gardens  to look for Bagheera?'    We were pleased, too, to meet some one who knew the Jungle Book.    So Oswald said--    'We are going to restore the fallen fortunes of the House of  Bastable--and we have all thought of different ways--and we're going to  try them all. Noel's way is poetry. I suppose great poets get paid?'    The lady laughed--she was awfully jolly--and said she was a sort of  poet, too, and the long strips of paper were the proofs of her new book  of stories. Because before a book is made into a real book with pages  and a cover, they sometimes print it all on strips of paper, and the  writer make marks on it with a pencil to show the printers what idiots  they are not to understand what a writer means to have printed.    We told her all about digging for treasure, and what we meant to do.  Then she asked to see Noel's poetry--and he said he didn't like--so she  said, 'Look here--if you'll show me yours I'll show you some of mine.'  So he agreed.    The jolly lady read Noel's poetry, and she said she liked it very much.  And she thought a great deal of the picture of the Malabar. And then she  said, 'I write serious poetry like yours myself; too, but I have a piece  here that I think you will like because it's about a boy.' She gave it  to us--and so I can copy it down, and I will, for it shows that some  grown-up ladies are not so silly as others. I like it better than Noel's  poetry, though I told him I did not, because he looked as if he was  going to cry. This was very wrong, for you should always speak the  truth, however unhappy it makes people. And I generally do. But I did  not want him crying in the railway carriage. The lady's piece of poetry:        Oh when I wake up in my bed      And see the sun all fat and red,      I'm glad to have another day      For all my different kinds of play.        There are so many things to do--      The things that make a man of you,      If grown-ups did not get so vexed      And wonder what you will do next.        I often wonder whether they      Ever made up our kinds of play--      If they were always good as gold      And only did what they were told.        They like you best to play with tops      And toys in boxes, bought in shops;      They do not even know the names      Of really interesting games.        They will not let you play with fire      Or trip your sister up with wire,      They grudge the tea-tray for a drum,      Or booby-traps when callers come.        They don't like fishing, and it's true      You sometimes soak a suit or two:      They look on fireworks, though they're dry,      With quite a disapproving eye.        They do not understand the way      To get the most out of your day:      They do not know how hunger feels      Nor what you need between your meals.        And when you're sent to bed at night,      They're happy, but they're not polite.      For through the door you hear them say:      '_He's_ done _his_ mischief for the day!'    She told us a lot of other pieces but I cannot remember them, and she  talked to us all the way up, and when we got nearly to Cannon Street she  said--    'I've got two new shillings here! Do you think they would help to smooth  the path to Fame?'    Noel said, 'Thank you,' and was going to take the shilling. But Oswald,  who always remembers what he is told, said--    'Thank you very much, but Father told us we ought never to take anything  from strangers.'    'That's a nasty one,' said the lady--she didn't talk a bit like a real  lady, but more like a jolly sort of grown-up boy in a dress and hat--'a  very nasty one! But don't you think as Noel and I are both poets I might  be considered a sort of relation? You've heard of brother poets, haven't  you? Don't you think Noel and I are aunt and nephew poets, or some  relationship of that kind?'    I didn't know what to say, and she went on--    'It's awfully straight of you to stick to what your Father tells you,  but look here, you take the shillings, and here's my card. When you  get home tell your Father all about it, and if he says No, you can just  bring the shillings back to me.'    So we took the shillings, and she shook hands with us and said,  'Good-bye, and good hunting!'    We did tell Father about it, and he said it was all right, and when  he looked at the card he told us we were highly honoured, for the lady  wrote better poetry than any other lady alive now. We had never heard of  her, and she seemed much too jolly for a poet. Good old Kipling! We owe  him those two shillings, as well as the Jungle books!        CHAPTER 5. THE POET AND THE EDITOR    It was not bad sport--being in London entirely on our own hook. We asked  the way to Fleet Street, where Father says all the newspaper offices  are. They said straight on down Ludgate Hill--but it turned out to be  quite another way. At least _we_ didn't go straight on.    We got to St Paul's. Noel _would_ go in, and we saw where Gordon was  buried--at least the monument. It is very flat, considering what a man  he was.    When we came out we walked a long way, and when we asked a policeman he  said we'd better go back through Smithfield. So we did. They don't burn  people any more there now, so it was rather dull, besides being a long  way, and Noel got very tired. He's a peaky little chap; it comes of  being a poet, I think. We had a bun or two at different shops--out of  the shillings--and it was quite late in the afternoon when we got to  Fleet Street. The gas was lighted and the electric lights. There is a  jolly Bovril sign that comes off and on in different coloured lamps. We  went to the Daily Recorder office, and asked to see the Editor. It is a  big office, very bright, with brass and mahogany and electric lights.    They told us the Editor wasn't there, but at another office. So we went  down a dirty street, to a very dull-looking place. There was a man there  inside, in a glass case, as if he was a museum, and he told us to write  down our names and our business. So Oswald wrote--               OSWALD BASTABLE              NOEL BASTABLE        BUSINESS VERY PRIVATE INDEED    Then we waited on the stone stairs; it was very draughty. And the man in  the glass case looked at us as if we were the museum instead of him. We  waited a long time, and then a boy came down and said--    'The Editor can't see you. Will you please write your business?' And he  laughed. I wanted to punch his head.    But Noel said, 'Yes, I'll write it if you'll give me a pen and ink, and  a sheet of paper and an envelope.'    The boy said he'd better write by post. But Noel is a bit pig-headed;  it's his worst fault. So he said--'No, I'll write it _now_.' So I backed  him up by saying--    'Look at the price penny stamps are since the coal strike!'    So the boy grinned, and the man in the glass case gave us pen and paper,  and Noel wrote. Oswald writes "]]]
