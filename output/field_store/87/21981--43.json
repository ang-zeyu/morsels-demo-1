He rested a moment or two at his door. \"Get off! Away with  you!\" cried the cobbler. \"Truly, I go away,\" returned Jesus, \"and that  quickly; but tarry thou till I come.\" And from that time Ahasuerus  became the \"wandering Jew,\" who still roams the earth, and will  continue so to do till the \"second coming of the Lord.\" This is the  legend given by Paul von Eitzen, bishop of Schleswig (1547).--Greve,  _Memoir of Paul von Eitzen_ (1744).    AHER'MAN AND AR'GEN, the former a fortress, and the latter a suite of  immense halls, in the realm of Eblis, where are lodged all creatures  of human intelligence before the creation of Adam, and all the animals  that inhabited the earth before the present races existed.--W.  Beckford, _Vathek_ (1786).    AH'MED _(Prince)_, noted for the tent given him by the fairy  Pari-banou, which would cover a whole army, and yet would fold up so  small that it might be carried in one's pocket. The same good  fairy also gave him the apple of Samarcand', a panacea for all  diseases.--_Arabian Nights' Entertainments_ (\"Prince Ahmed, etc.\").    AHOLIBA'MAH, granddaughter of Cain, and sister of Anah. She was loved  by the seraph Samias'a, and like her sister was carried off to another  planet when the Flood came.--Byron, _Heaven and Earth_.      Proud, imperious, and aspiring, she denies that    she worships the seraph, and declares that his    immortality can bestow no love more pure and    warm than her own, and she expresses a conviction    that there is a ray within her \"which,    though forbidden yet to shine,\" is nevertheless    lighted at the same ethereal fire as his own.--Finden,    _Byron Beauties_.

AIM'WELL _(Thomas, viscount_), a gentleman of broken fortune, who pays  his addresses to Dorin'da, daughter of Lady Bountiful. He is very  handsome and fascinating, but quite \"a man of the world.\" He and  Archer are the two beaux of _The Beaux' Stratagem_, a comedy by George  Farquhar (1705).    I thought it rather odd that Holland should be the only \"mister\" of  the party, and I said to myself, as Gibbet said when he heard that  \"Aimwell\" had gone to church, \"That looks suspicions\" (act ii. sc.  2).--James Smith, _Memoirs, Letters, etc_. (1840).    AIRCASTLE, in the _Cozeners_, by S. Foote. The original of this  rambling talker was Gahagan, whose method of conversation is thus  burlesqued:    _Aircastle_: \"Did I not tell you what parson Prunello said? I  remember, Mrs. Lightfoot was by. She had-been brought to bed that  day was a month of a very fine boy--a bad birth; for Dr. Seeton, who  served his time with Luke Lancet, of Guise's.--There was also a talk  about him and Nancy the daughter. She afterwards married Will Whitlow,  another apprentice, who had great expectations from an old uncle in  the Grenadiers; but he left all to a distant relation, Kit Cable,  a midshipman aboard the _Torbay_. She was lost coming home in the  channel. The captain was taken up by a coaster from Eye, loaded with  cheese--\" [Now, pray, what did parson Prunello say? This is a pattern  of Mrs. Nickleby's rambling gossip.]    AIR'LIE (_The earl of_), a royalist in the service of king Charles  I.--Sir W. Scott, _Legend of Montrose_.    AIRY (_Sir George_), a man of fortune, in love with Miran'da, the ward  of sir Francis Gripe.--Mrs. Centlivre, _The Busylody_ (1709).    A'JAX, son of Oileus [_O.i'.luce_], generally called \"the less.\" In  conseqnence of his insolence to Cassan'dra, the prophetic daughter of  Priam, his ship was driven on a rock, and he perished at sea.--Homer,  _Odyssey_, iv. 507; Virgil, _AEneid_, i. 41.    A'JAX TEL'AMON. Sophocles has a tragedy called _Ajax_, in which \"the  madman\" scourges a ram he mistakes for Ulysses. His encounter with  a flock of sheep, which he fancied in his madness to be the sons of  Atreus, has been mentioned at greater or less length by several Greek  and Roman poets. Don Quixote had a similar adventure. This Ajax is  introduced by Shakespeare in his drama called _Troilus and Cressida._  (See ALIFANFARON).      The Tuscan poet [_Ariosto_] doth advance    The frantic paladin of France [_Orlando Furioso_];    And those more ancient [_Euripides_ and _Seneca_] do enhance    Alcides in his fury [_Hercules Furens_];    And others, Ajax Telamon;--    But to this time there hath been none    So bedlam as our Oberon;    Of whom I dare assure you.

ALADDIN, son of Mustafa, a poor tailor, of China, \"obstinate,  disobedent, and mischievous,\" wholly abandoned \"to indolence and  licentiousness.\" One day an African magician accosted him, pretending  to be his uncle, and sent him to bring up the \"wonderful lamp,\" at the  same time giving him a \"ring of safety.\" Aladdin secured the lamp,  but would not hand it to the magician till he was out of the cave,  whereupon the magician shut him up in the cave, and departed for  Africa. Aladdin, wringing his hands in despair, happened to rub the  magic ring, when the genius of the ring appeared before him, and asked  him his commands. Aladdin requested to be delivered from the cave, and  he returned home. By means of his lamp, he obtained untold wealth,  built a superb palace, and married Badroul'boudour, the sultan's  daughter. After a time, the African magician got possession of the  lamp, and caused the palace, with all its contents, to be transported  into Africa. Aladdin was absent at the time, was arrested and ordered  to execution, but was rescued by the populace, with whom he was an  immense favorite, and started to discover what had become of his  palace. Happening to slip, he rubbed his ring, and when the genius of  the ring appeared and asked his orders, was instantly posted to the  place where his palace was in Africa. He poisoned the magician,  regained the lamp, and had his palace restored to its original place  in China.    Yes, ready money is Aladdin's lamp.    Byron, _Don Juan_, xii. 12.    _Aladdin's Lamp_, a lamp brought from an underground cavern in \"the  middle of China.\" Being in want of food, the mother of Aladdin began  to scrub it, intending to sell it, when the genius of the lamp  appeared, and asked her what were her commands. Aladdin answered, \"I  am hungry; bring me food;\" and immediately a banquet was set before  him. Having thus become acquainted with the merits of the lamp, he  became enormously rich, and married the sultan's daughter. By artifice  the African magician got possession of the lamp, and transported the  palace with its contents to Africa. Aladdin poisoned the magician,  recovered the lamp, and retranslated the palace to its original site.    _Aladdin's Palace Windows_. At the top of the palace was a saloon,  containing tweny-four windows (six on each side), and all but one  enriched with diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. One was left for the  sultan to complete, but all the jewellers in the empire were unable to  make one to match the others, so Aladdin commanded \"the slaves of the  lamp\" to complete their work.    _Aladdin's Ring_, given him by the African magician, \"a preservative  against every evil.\"--_Arabian Nights_ (\"Aladdin and the Wonderful  Lamp\").

Frederick the Great of Prussia was so called by  Voltaire. \"Alaric\" because, like Alaric, he was a great warrior, and  \"Cottin\" because, like Cottin, satirized by Boileau, he was a very  indifferent poet.    ALAS'CO, _alias_ DR. DEMETRIUS DOBOOBIE, an old astrologer, consulted  by the earl of Leicester.--Sir W. Scott, _Kenilworth_ (time,  Elizabeth).    ALAS'NAM (_Prince Zeyn_) possessed eight statues, each a single  diamond on a gold pedestal, but had to go in search of a ninth, more  valuable than them all. This ninth was a lady, the most beautiful and  virtuous of women, \"more precious than rubies,\" who became his wife.    One pure and perfect _[woman]_ is ... like Alasnam's lady, worth them  all.--Sir Walter Scott.    _Alasnam's Mirror_. When Alasnam was in search of his ninth statue,  the king of the Genii gave him a test mirror, in which he was to  look when he saw a beautiful girl; \"if the glass remained pure and  unsullied, the damsel would be the same, but if not, the damsel would  not be wholly pure in body and in mind.\" This mirror was called \"the  touchstone of virtue.\"--_Arabian Nights_ (\"Prince Zeyn Alasnam\")."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11438"],[0,"The Willows (#7)"],[1,"you never watched  those little whirlwinds in the street that twist and twirl everything into  a circle? This sand's loose enough to yield, that's all.\"    He made no reply, and we worked on in silence for a bit. I watched him  surreptitiously all the time, and I had an idea he was watching me. He  seemed, too, to be always listening attentively to something I could not  hear, or perhaps for something that he expected to hear, for he kept  turning about and staring into the bushes, and up into the sky, and out  across the water where it was visible through the openings among the  willows. Sometimes he even put his hand to his ear and held it there for  several minutes. He said nothing to me, however, about it, and I asked no  questions. And meanwhile, as he mended that torn canoe with the skill and  address of a red Indian, I was glad to notice his absorption in the work,  for there was a vague dread in my heart that he would speak of the changed  aspect of the willows. And, if he had noticed that, my imagination could no  longer be held a sufficient explanation of it.          III      At length, after a long pause, he began to talk.    \"Queer thing,\" he added in a hurried sort of voice, as though he wanted to  say something and get it over. \"Queer thing. I mean, about that otter last  night.\"    I had expected something so totally different that he caught me with  surprise, and I looked up sharply.    \"Shows how lonely this place is. Otters are awfully shy things--\"    \"I don't mean that, of course,\" he interrupted. \"I mean--do you think--did  you think it really was an otter?\"    \"What else, in the name of Heaven, what else?\"    \"You know, I saw it before you did, and at first it seemed--so much bigger  than an otter.\"    \"The sunset as you looked up-stream magnified it, or something,\" I replied.    He looked at me absently a moment, as though his mind were busy with other  thoughts.    \"It had such extraordinary yellow eyes,\" he went on half to himself.    \"That was the sun too,\" I laughed, a trifle boisterously. \"I suppose you'll  wonder next if that fellow in the boat--\"    I suddenly decided not to finish the sentence. He was in the act again of  listening, turning his head to the wind, and something in the expression of  his face made me halt. The subject dropped, and we went on with our  caulking. Apparently he had not noticed my unfinished sentence. Five  minutes later, however, he looked at me across the canoe, the smoking pitch  in his hand, his face exceedingly grave.    \"I did rather wonder, if you want to know,\" he said slowly, \"what that  thing in the boat was. I remember thinking at the time it was not a man.  The whole business seemed to rise quite suddenly out of the water.\"    I laughed again boisterously in his face, but this time there was  impatience, and a strain of anger too, in my feeling.    \"Look here now,\" I cried, \"this place is quite queer enough without going  out of our way to imagine things! That boat was an ordinary boat, and the  man in it was an ordinary man, and they were both going down-stream as fast  as they could lick. And that otter was an otter, so don't let's play the  fool about it!\"    He looked steadily at me with the same grave expression. He was not in the  least annoyed. I took courage from his silence.    \"And, for Heaven's sake,\" I went on, \"don't keep pretending you hear  things, because it only gives me the jumps, and there's nothing to hear but  the river and this cursed old thundering wind.\"    \"You fool!\" he answered in a low, shocked voice, \"you utter fool. That's  just the way all victims talk. As if you didn't understand just as well as  I do!\" he sneered with scorn in his voice, and a sort of resignation. \"The  best thing you can do is to keep quiet and try to hold your mind as firm as  possible. This feeble attempt at self-deception only makes the truth harder  when you're forced to meet it.\"    My little effort was over, and I found nothing more to say, for I knew  quite well his words were true, and that I was the fool, not he. Up to a  certain stage in the adventure he kept ahead of me easily, and I think I  felt annoyed to be out of it, to be thus proved less psychic, less  sensitive than himself to these extraordinary happenings, and half ignorant  all the time of what was going on under my very nose. He knew from the very  beginning, apparently. But at the moment I wholly missed the point of his  words about the necessity of there being a victim, and that we ourselves  were destined to satisfy the want. I dropped all pretence thenceforward,  but thenceforward likewise my fear increased steadily to the climax.    \"But you're quite right about one thing,\" he added, before the subject  passed, \"and that is that we're wiser not to talk about it, or even to  think about it, because what one thinks finds expression in words, and what  one says, happens.\"    That afternoon, while the canoe dried and hardened, we spent trying to  fish, testing the leak, collecting wood, and watching the enormous flood of  rising water. Masses of driftwood swept near our shores sometimes, and we  fished for them with long willow branches. The island grew perceptibly  smaller as the banks were torn away with great gulps and splashes. The  weather kept brilliantly fine till about four o'clock, and then for the  first time for three days the wind showed signs of abating. Clouds began to  gather in the south-west, spreading thence slowly over the sky.    This lessening of the wind came as a great relief, for the incessant  roaring, banging, and thundering had irritated our nerves. Yet the silence  that came about five o'clock with its sudden cessation was in a manner  quite as oppressive. The booming of the river had everything in its own way  then; it filled the air with deep murmurs, more musical than the wind  noises, but infinitely more monotonous. The wind held many notes, rising,  falling always beating out some sort of great elemental tune; whereas the  river's song lay between three notes at most--dull pedal notes, that held a  lugubrious quality foreign to the wind, and somehow seemed to me, in my  then nervous state, to sound wonderfully well the music of doom.    It was extraordinary, too, how the withdrawal suddenly of bright sunlight  took everything out of the landscape that made for cheerfulness; and since  this particular landscape had already managed to convey the suggestion of  something sinister, the change of course was all the more unwelcome and  noticeable. For me, I know, the darkening outlook became distinctly more  alarming, and I found myself more than once calculating how soon after  sunset the full moon would get up in the east, and whether the gathering  clouds would greatly interfere with her lighting of the little island.    With this general hush of the wind--though it still indulged in occasional  brief gusts--the river seemed to me to grow blacker, the willows to stand  more densely together. The latter, too, kept up a sort of independent  movement of their own, rustling among themselves when no wind stirred, and  shaking oddly from the roots upwards. When common objects in this way be  come charged with the suggestion of horror, they stimulate the imagination  far more than things of unusual appearance; and these bushes, crowding  huddled about us, assumed for me in the darkness a bizarre grotesquerie of  appearance that lent to them somehow the aspect of purposeful and living  creatures. Their very ordinariness, I felt, masked what was malignant and  hostile to us. The forces of the region drew nearer with the coming of  night. They were focusing upon our island, and more particularly upon  ourselves. For thus, somehow, in the terms of the imagination, did my  really indescribable sensations in this extraordinary place present  themselves.    I had slept a good deal in the early afternoon, and had thus recovered  somewhat from the exhaustion of a disturbed night, but this only served  apparently to render me more susceptible than before to the obsessing spell  of the haunting. I fought against it, laughing at my feelings as absurd and  childish, with very obvious physiological explanations, yet, in spite of  every effort, they gained in strength upon me so that I dreaded the night  as a child lost in a forest must dread the approach of darkness.    The canoe we had carefully covered with a waterproof sheet during the day,  and the one remaining paddle had been securely tied by the Swede to the  base of a tree, lest the wind should rob us of that too. From five o'clock  onwards I busied myself with the stew-pot and preparations for dinner, it  being my turn to cook that night. We had potatoes, onions, bits of bacon  fat to add flavor, and a general thick residue from former stews at the  bottom of the pot; with black bread broken up into it the result was most  excellent, and it was followed by a stew of plums with sugar and a brew of  strong tea with dried milk. A good pile of wood lay close at hand, and the  absence of wind made my duties easy. My companion sat lazily watching me,  dividing his attentions between cleaning his pipe and giving useless  advice--an admitted privilege of the off-duty man. He had been very quiet  all the afternoon, engaged in re-caulking the canoe, strengthening the tent  ropes, and fishing for driftwood while I slept. No more talk about  undesirable things had passed between us, and I think his only remarks had  to do with the gradual destruction of the island, which he declared was not  fully a third smaller than when we first landed.    The pot had just begun to bubble when I heard his voice calling to me from  the bank, where he had wandered away without my noticing. I ran up.    \"Come and listen,\" he said, \"and see what you make of it.\" He held his hand  cupwise to his ear, as so often before.    \"Now do you hear anything?\" he asked, watching me curiously.    We stood there, listening attentively "]]]
