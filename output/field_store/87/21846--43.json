Selah.    19:032:005 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not             hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD;             and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.    19:032:006 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a             time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great             waters they shall not come nigh unto him.    19:032:007 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;             thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.    19:032:008 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou             shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.    19:032:009 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no             understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and             bridle, lest they come near unto thee.    19:032:010 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in             the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.    19:032:011 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for             joy, all ye that are upright in heart.    19:033:001 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for             the upright.    19:033:002 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and             an instrument of ten strings.    19:033:003 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.    19:033:004 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done             in truth.    19:033:005 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the             goodness of the LORD.    19:033:006 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the             host of them by the breath of his mouth.    19:033:007 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he             layeth up the depth in storehouses.    19:033:008 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of             the world stand in awe of him.    19:033:009 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood             fast.    19:033:010 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he             maketh the devices of the people of none effect.    19:033:011 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his             heart to all generations.    19:033:012 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people             whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.    19:033:013 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of             men.    19:033:014 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the             inhabitants of the earth.    19:033:015 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their             works.    19:033:016 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty             man is not delivered by much strength.    19:033:017 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver             any by his great strength.    19:033:018 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon             them that hope in his mercy;    19:033:019 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in             famine.    19:033:020 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.    19:033:021 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in             his holy name.    19:033:022 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in             thee.    19:034:001 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall             continually be in my mouth.    19:034:002 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall             hear thereof, and be glad.    19:034:003 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name             together.    19:034:004 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all             my fears.    19:034:005 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were             not ashamed.    19:034:006 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out             of all his troubles.    19:034:007 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear             him, and delivereth them.    19:034:008 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that             trusteth in him.    19:034:009 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them             that fear him.    19:034:010 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek             the LORD shall not want any good thing.    19:034:011 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear             of the LORD.    19:034:012 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that             he may see good?    19:034:013 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.    19:034:014 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.    19:034:015 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are             open unto their cry.    19:034:016 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off             the remembrance of them from the earth.    19:034:017 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them             out of all their troubles.    19:034:018 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and             saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.    19:034:019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD             delivereth him out of them all.    19:034:020 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.    19:034:021 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous             shall be desolate.    19:034:022 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them             that trust in him shall be desolate.    19:035:001 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight             against them that fight against me.    19:035:002 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.    19:035:003 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that             persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.    19:035:004 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my             soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that             devise my hurt.    19:035:005 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the             LORD chase them.    19:035:006 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the             LORD persecute them.    19:035:007 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit,             which without cause they have digged for my soul.    19:035:008 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net             that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let             him fall.    19:035:009 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in             his salvation.    19:035:010 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which             deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea,             the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?    19:035:011 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things             that I knew not.    19:035:012 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.    19:035:013 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth:             I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into             mine own bosom.    19:035:014 I behaved"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8020"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 20: Proverbs (#6)"],[1,"0:016:012 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the             throne is established by righteousness.    20:016:013 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him             that speaketh right.    20:016:014 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man             will pacify it.    20:016:015 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour             is as a cloud of the latter rain.    20:016:016 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get             understanding rather to be chosen than silver!    20:016:017 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that             keepeth his way preserveth his soul.    20:016:018 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a             fall.    20:016:019 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to             divide the spoil with the proud.    20:016:020 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso             trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.    20:016:021 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness             of the lips increaseth learning.    20:016:022 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it:             but the instruction of fools is folly.    20:016:023 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning             to his lips.    20:016:024 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and             health to the bones.    20:016:025 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end             thereof are the ways of death.    20:016:026 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth             it of him.    20:016:027 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a             burning fire.    20:016:028 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief             friends.    20:016:029 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the             way that is not good.    20:016:030 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips             he bringeth evil to pass.    20:016:031 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way             of righteousness.    20:016:032 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he             that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.    20:016:033 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof             is of the LORD.    20:017:001 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house             full of sacrifices with strife.    20:017:002 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,             and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.    20:017:003 The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but             the LORD trieth the hearts.    20:017:004 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear             to a naughty tongue.    20:017:005 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is             glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.    20:017:006 Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of             children are their fathers.    20:017:007 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips             a prince.    20:017:008 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:             whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.    20:017:009 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that             repeateth a matter separateth very friends.    20:017:010 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred             stripes into a fool.    20:017:011 An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel             messenger shall be sent against him.    20:017:012 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool             in his folly.    20:017:013 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his             house.    20:017:014 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:             therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.    20:017:015 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the             just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.    20:017:016 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get             wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?    20:017:017 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for             adversity.    20:017:018 A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh             surety in the presence of his friend.    20:017:019 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that             exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.    20:017:020 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath             a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.    20:017:021 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the             father of a fool hath no joy.    20:017:022 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit             drieth the bones.    20:017:023 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the             ways of judgment.    20:017:024 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of             a fool are in the ends of the earth.    20:017:025 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her             that bare him.    20:017:026 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for             equity.    20:017:027 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of             understanding is of an excellent spirit.    20:017:028 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and             he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.    20:018:001 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and             intermeddleth with all wisdom.    20:018:002 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart             may discover itself.    20:018:003 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with             ignominy reproach.    20:018:004 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the             wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.    20:018:005 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to             overthrow the righteous in judgment.    20:018:006 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for             strokes.    20:018:007 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare             of his soul.    20:018:008 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into             the innermost parts of the belly.    20:018:009 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is             a great waster.    20:018:010 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth             into it, and is safe.    20:018:011 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall             in his own conceit.    20:018:012 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before             honour is humility.    20:018:013 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly             and shame unto him.    20:018:014 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded             spirit who can bear?    20:018:015 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the             wise seeketh knowledge.    20:018:016 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before             great men.    20:018:017 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his             neighbour cometh and searcheth him.    20:018:018 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the             mighty.    20:018:019 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and             their contentions are like the bars of a castle.    20:018:020 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;             and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.    20:018:021 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that             love it shall eat the fruit thereof.    20:018:022 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth             favour of the LORD.    20:018:023 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.    20:018:024 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there             is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.    20:019:001 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that             is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.    20:019:002 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and             he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.    20:019:003 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart             fretteth against the LORD.    20:019:004 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his             neighbour.    20:019:005 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh             lies shall not escape.    20:019:006 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a             friend to him that giveth gifts.    20:019:007 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his             friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they             are wanting to him.    20:019:008 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth             understanding shall find good.    20:019:009 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh             lies shall perish.    20:019:010 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to             have rule over princes.    20:019:011 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his             glory to pass over a transgression.    20:019:012 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour             is as dew upon the grass.    20:019:013 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the             contentions of "]]]
