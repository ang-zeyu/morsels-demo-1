But the distinction is obvious. Homer did not  personally identify himself with a creed, or do his utmost to perpetuate  the worst parts of it in behalf of a ferocious inquisitorial church, and  to the risk of endangering the peace of millions of gentle minds.    The great poem thus misnomered is partly a system of theology, partly an  abstract of the knowledge of the day, but chiefly a series of passionate  and imaginative pictures, altogether forming an account of the author's  times, his friends, his enemies, and himself, written to vent the spleen  of his exile, and the rest of his feelings, good and bad, and to reform  church and state by a spirit of resentment and obloquy, which highly  needed reform itself. It has also a design strictly self-referential.  The author feigns, that the beatified spirit of his mistress has  obtained leave to warn and purify his soul by shewing him the state of  things in the next world. She deputes the soul of his master Virgil  to conduct him through hell and purgatory, and then takes him herself  through the spheres of heaven, where Saint Peter catechises and confirms  him, and where he is finally honoured with sights of the Virgin Mary, of  Christ, and even a glimpse of the Supreme Being!    His hell, considered as a place, is, to speak geologically, a most  fantastical formation. It descends from beneath Jerusalem to the centre  of the earth, and is a funnel graduated in circles, each circle being a  separate place of torment for a different vice or its co-ordinates, and  the point of the funnel terminating with Satan stuck into ice. Purgatory  is a corresponding mountain on the other side of the globe, commencing  with the antipodes of Jerusalem, and divided into exterior circles of  expiation, which end in a table-land forming the terrestrial paradise.  From this the hero and his mistress ascend by a flight, exquisitely  conceived, to the stars; where the sun and the planets of the Ptolemaic  system (for the true one was unknown in Dante's time) form a series of  heavens for different virtues, the whole terminating in the empyrean, or  region of pure light, and the presence of the Beatific Vision.    The boundaries of old and new, strange as it may now seem to us, were so  confused in those days, and books were so rare, and the Latin poets held  in such invincible reverence, that Dante, in one and the same poem,  speaks of the false gods of Paganism, and yet retains much of its lower  mythology; nay, invokes Apollo himself at the door of paradise. There  was, perhaps, some mystical and even philosophical inclusion of the  past in this medley, as recognising the constant superintendence of  Providence; but that Dante partook of what may be called the literary  superstition of the time, even for want of better knowledge, is clear  from the grave historical use he makes of poetic fables in his treatise  on Monarchy, and in the very arguments which he puts into the mouths of  saints and apostles. There are lingering feelings to this effect even  now among the peasantry of Italy; where, the reader need not be told,  Pagan customs of all sorts, including religious and most reverend ones,  are existing under the sanction of other names;--heathenisms christened.  A Tuscan postilion, once enumerating to me some of the native poets,  concluded his list with Apollo; and a plaster-cast man over here, in  London, appeared much puzzled, when conversing on the subject with a  friend of mine, how to discrepate Samson from Hercules.    Dante accordingly, while, with the frightful bigotry of the schools, he  puts the whole Pagan world into hell-borders (with the exception of two  or three, whose salvation adds to the absurdity), mingles the hell of  Virgil with that of Tertullian and St. Dominic; sets Minos at the door  as judge; retains Charon in his old office of boatman over the Stygian  lake; puts fabulous people with real among the damned, Dido, and Cacus,  and Ephialtes, with Ezzelino and Pope Nicholas the Fifth; and associates  the Centaurs and the Furies with the agents of diabolical torture. It  has pleased him also to elevate Cato of Utica to the office of warder of  purgatory, though the censor's poor good wife, Marcia, is detained in  the regions below. By these and other far greater inconsistencies,  the whole place of punishment becomes a _reductio ad absurdum_, as  ridiculous as it is melancholy; so that one is astonished how so great a  man, and especially a man who thought himself so far advanced beyond his  age, and who possessed such powers of discerning the good and beautiful,  could endure to let his mind live in so foul and foolish a region for  any length of time, and there wreak and harden the unworthiest of his  passions. Genius, nevertheless, is so commensurate with absurdity  throughout the book, and there are even such sweet and balmy as well as  sublime pictures in it occasionally, nay often, that not only will  the poem ever be worthy of admiration, but when those increasing  purifications of Christianity which our blessed reformers began, shall  finally precipitate the whole dregs of the author into the mythology to  which they belong, the world will derive a pleasure from it to an amount  not to be conceived till the arrival of that day. Dante, meantime, with  an impartiality which has been admired by those who can approve the  assumption of a theological tyranny at the expense of common feeling  and decency, has put friends as well as foes into hell: tutors of his  childhood, kinsmen of those who treated him hospitably, even the father  of his beloved friend, Guido Cavalcante--the last for not believing in a  God: therein doing the worst thing possible in behalf of the belief, and  totally differing both with the pious heathen Plutarch, and the great  Christian philosopher Bacon, who were of opinion that a contumelious  belief is worse than none, and that it is far better and more pious to  believe in \"no God at all,\" than in a God who would \"eat his children  as soon as they were born.\" And Dante makes him do worse; for the whole  unbaptised infant world, Christian as well as Pagan, is in his Tartarus.    Milton has spoken of the \"milder shades of Purgatory;\" and truly they  possess great beauties. Even in a theological point of view they are  something like a bit of Christian refreshment after the horrors of the  _Inferno_. The first emerging from the hideous gulf to the sight of the  blue serenity of heaven, is painted in a manner inexpressibly charming.  So is the sea-shore with the coming of the angel; the valley, with the  angels in green; the repose at night on the rocks; and twenty other  pictures of gentleness and love. And yet, special and great has been the  escape of the Protestant world from this part of Roman Catholic belief;  for Purgatory is the heaviest stone that hangs about the neck of the  old and feeble in that communion. Hell is avoidable by repentance; but  Purgatory, what modest conscience shall escape? Mr. Cary, in a note on a  passage in which Dante recommends his readers to think on what follows  this expiatory state, rather than what is suffered there,[23] looks upon  the poet's injunction as an \"unanswerable objection to the doctrine of  purgatory,\" it being difficult to conceive \"how the best can meet death  without horror, if they believe it must be followed by immediate and  intense suffering.\" Luckily, assent is not belief; and mankind's  feelings are for the most part superior to their opinions; otherwise  the world would have been in a bad way indeed, and nature not been  vindicated of her children. But let us watch and be on our guard against  all resuscitations of superstition.    As to our Florentine's Heaven, it is full of beauties also, though  sometimes of a more questionable and pantomimical sort than is to be  found in either of the other books. I shall speak of some of them  presently; but the general impression of the place is, that it is no  heaven at all. He says it is, and talks much of its smiles and its  beatitude; but always excepting the poetry--especially the similes  brought from the more heavenly earth--we realise little but a  fantastical assemblage of doctors and doubtful characters, far more  angry and theological than celestial; giddy raptures of monks and  inquisitors dancing in circles, and saints denouncing popes and  Florentines; in short, a heaven libelling itself with invectives against  earth, and terminating in a great presumption. Many of the people put  there, a Calvinistic Dante would have consigned to the \"other place;\"  and some, if now living, would not be admitted into decent society. At  the beginning of one of the cantos, the poet congratulates himself,  with a complacent superiority, on his being in heaven and occupied with  celestial matters, while his poor fellow-creatures are wandering and  blundering on earth. But he had never got there! A divine--worthy of  that name--of the Church of England (Dr. Whichcote), has beautifully  said, that \"heaven is first a temper, and then a place.\" According to  this truly celestial topography, the implacable Florentine had not  reached its outermost court. Again, his heavenly mistress, Beatrice,  besides being far too didactic to sustain the womanly part of her  character properly, alternates her smiles and her sarcasms in a way that  jars horribly against the occasional enchantment of her aspect. She does  not scruple to burst into taunts of the Florentines in the presence of  Jesus himself; and the spirit of his ancestor, Cacciaguida, in the very  bosom of Christian bliss, promises him revenge on his enemies! Is this  the kind of zeal that is to be exempt from objection in a man who  objected to all the world? or will it be thought a profaneness against  such profanity, to remind the reader of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10886"],[0,"The Untamed (#7)"],[1,"ve.    \"Stranger,\" he said, \"I've still got somewhere in the neighbourhood of  five hundred dollars in that cash drawer. An' every cent of it hollers  that Dan can do what I said.\"    Silent hesitated. His code was loose, but he did not like to take  advantage of a drunk or a crazy man. However, five hundred dollars was  five hundred dollars. Moreover that handsome fellow who had just taken  water from Hal Purvis and was now smiling foolishly at his own shame,  had actually ridden Red Peter. The remembrance infuriated Silent.    \"Hurry up,\" said Morgan confidently. \"I dunno what you're thinkin',  stranger. Which I'm kind of deaf an' I don't understand the way  anything talks except money.\"    \"Corral that talk, Morgan!\" called a voice from the crowd, \"you're  plumb locoed if you think any man in the world can get away with a  stunt like that! Pick four in the air!\"    \"You keep your jaw for yourself,\" said Silent angrily, \"if he wants to  donate a little more money to charity, let him do it. Morgan, I've got  five hundred here to cover your stake.\"    \"Make him give you odds, Morgan,\" said another voice, \"because----\"    A glance from Silent cut the suggestion short. After that there was  little loud conversation. The stakes were large. The excitement made  the men hush the very tones in which they spoke. Morgan moistened his  white lips.    \"You c'n see I'm not packin' any shootin' irons,\" said Dan. \"Has  anybody got any suggestions?\"    Every gun in the crowd was instantly at his service. They were  heartily tempted to despise Dan, but as one with the courage to  attempt the impossible, they would help him as far as they could. He  took their guns one after the other, weighed them, tried the action,  and handed them back. It was almost as if there were a separate  intelligence in the ends of his fingers which informed him of the  qualities of each weapon.    \"Nice gun,\" he said to the first man whose revolver he handled, \"but I  don't like a barrel that's quite so heavy. There's a whole ounce too  much in the barrel.\"    \"What d'you mean?\" asked the cowpuncher. \"I've packed that gun for  pretty nigh eight years!\"    \"Sorry,\" said Dan passing on, \"but I can't work right with a top-heavy  gun.\"    The next weapon he handed back almost at once.    \"What's the matter with that?\" asked the owner aggressively.    \"Cylinder too tight,\" said Dan decisively, and a moment later to  another man, \"Bad handle. I don't like the feel of it.\"    Over Jim Silent's guns he paused longer than over most of the rest,  but finally he handed them back. The big man scowled.    Dan looked back to him in gentle surprise.    \"You see,\" he explained quietly, \"you got to handle a gun like a  horse. If you don't treat it right it won't treat you right. That's  all I know about it. Your gun ain't very clean, stranger, an' a gun  that ain't kept clean gets off feet.\"    Silent glanced at his weapons, cursed softly, and restored them to the  holsters.    \"Lee,\" he muttered to Haines, who stood next to him, \"what do you  think he meant by that? D' you figger he's got somethin' up his  sleeve, an' that's why he acts so like a damned woman?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Haines gravely, \"he looks to me sort of  queer--sort of different--damned different, chief!\"    By this time Dan had secured a second gun which suited him. He whirled  both guns, tried their actions alternately, and then announced that he  was ready. In the dead silence, one of the men paced off the twenty  yards.    Dan, with his back turned, stood at the mark, shifting his revolvers  easily in his hands, and smiling down at them as if they could  understand his caress.    \"How you feelin', Dan?\" asked Morgan anxiously.    \"Everything fine,\" he answered.    \"Are you gettin' weak?\"    \"No, I'm all right.\"    \"Steady up, partner.\"    \"Steady up? Look at my hand!\"    Dan extended his arm. There was not a quiver in it.    \"All right, Dan. When you're shootin', remember that I got pretty  close to everything I own staked on you. There's the stranger gettin'  his four dollars ready.\"    Silent took his place with the four dollars in his hand.    \"Are you ready?\" he called.    \"Let her go!\" said Dan, apparently without the least excitement.    Jim Silent threw the coins, and he threw them so as to increase his  chances as much as possible. A little snap of his hand gave them a  rapid rotary motion so that each one was merely a speck of winking  light. He flung them high, for it was probable that Whistling Dan  would wait to shoot until they were on the way down. The higher he  threw them the more rapidly they would be travelling when they crossed  the level of the markman's eye.    As a shout proclaimed the throwing of the coins, Dan whirled, and it  seemed to the bystanders that a revolver exploded before he was fully  turned; but one of the coins never rose to the height of the throw.  There was a light \"cling!\" and it spun a dozen yards away. Two more  shots blended almost together; two more dollars darted away in  twinkling streaks of light. One coin still fell, but when it was a  few inches from the earth a six-shooter barked again and the fourth  dollar glanced sidewise into the dust. It takes long to describe the  feat. Actually, the four shots consumed less than a second of time.    \"That last dollar,\" said Dan, and his soft voice was the first sound  out of the silence, \"wasn't good. It didn't ring true. Counterfeit?\"    It seemed that no one heard his words. The men were making a wild  scramble for the dollars. They dived into the dust for them, rising  white of face and clothes to fight and struggle over their prizes.  Those dollars with the chips and neat round holes in them would  confirm the truth of a story that the most credulous might be tempted  to laugh or scorn. A cowpuncher offered ten dollars for one of the  relics--but none would part with a prize.    The moment the shooting was over Dan stepped quietly back and restored  the guns to the owners. The first man seized his weapon carelessly. He  was in the midst of his rush after one of the chipped coins. The other  cowpuncher received his weapon almost with reverence.    \"I'm thankin' you for the loan,\" said Dan, \"an here's hopin' you  always have luck with the gun.\"    \"Luck?\" said the other. \"I sure _will_ have luck with it. I'm goin'  to oil her up and put her in a glass case back home, an' when I get  grandchildren I'm goin' to point out that gun to 'em and tell 'em what  men used to do in the old days. Let's go in an' surround some red-eye  at my expense.\"    \"No thanks,\" answered Dan, \"I ain't drinkin'.\"    He stepped back to the edge of the circle and folded his arms. It was  as if he had walked out of the picture. He suddenly seemed to be aloof  from them all.    Out of the quiet burst a torrent of curses, exclamations, and shouts.  Chance drew Jim Silent and his three followers together.    \"My God!\" whispered Lee Haines, with a sort of horror in his voice,  \"it wasn't human! Did you see? Did you see?\"    \"Am I blind?\" asked Hal Purvis, \"an' think of me walkin' up an'  bracin' that killer like he was a two-year-old kid! I figger that's  the nearest I ever come to a undeserved grave, an' I've had some close  calls! 'That last dollar wasn't good! It didn't ring true,' says he  when he finished. I never seen such nerve!\"    \"You're wrong as hell,\" said Silent, \"a _woman_ can shoot at a target,  but it takes a cold _nerve_ to shoot at a man--an' this feller is  yellow all through!\"    \"Is he?\" growled Bill Kilduff, \"well, I'd hate to take him by  surprise, so's he'd forget himself. He gets as much action out of a  common six-gun as if it was a gatling. He was right about that last  dollar, too. It was pure--lead!\"    \"All right, Haines,\" said Silent. \"You c'n start now any time, an'  the rest of us'll follow on the way I said. I'm leavin' last. I got a  little job to finish up with the kid.\"    But Haines was staring fixedly down the road.    \"I'm not leaving yet,\" said Haines. \"Look!\"    He turned to one of the cowpunchers.    \"Who's the girl riding up the road, pardner?\"    \"That calico? She's Kate Cumberland--old Joe's gal.\"    \"I like the name,\" said Haines. \"She sits the saddle like a man!\"    Her pony darted off from some imaginary object in the middle of the  road, and she swayed gracefully, following the sudden motion. Her  mount came to the sudden halt of the cattle pony and she slipped to  the ground before Morgan could run out to help. Even Lee Haines, who  was far quicker, could not reach her in time.    \"Sorry I'm late,\" said Haines. \"Shall I tie your horse?\"    The fast ride had blown colour to her face and good spirits into her  eyes. She smiled up to him, and as she shook her head in refusal her  eyes lingered a pardonable moment on his handsome face, with the stray  lock of tawny hair fallen low across his forehead. She was used to  frank admiration, but this unembarrassed courtesy was a new world to  her. She was still smiling when she turned to Morgan.    \"You told my father the boys wouldn't wear guns today.\"    He was somewhat confused.    \"They seem to be wearin' them,\" he said weakly, and his eyes wandered  about the armed circle, pausing on the ominous forms of Hal Purvis,  Bill Kilduff, and especially Jim Silent, a head taller than the rest.  He stood somewhat in the background, but the slight sneer with which  he watched Whistling Dan dominated the entire picture.    \"As a matter of fact,\" went on Morgan, \"it would be a ten man job to  take the guns away from this crew. You can see for yourself.\"    She glanced about the throng and started. She had seen Dan.    \"How did he come here?\"    \"Oh, Dan?\" said Morgan, \"he's all right. He just pulled one of the  prettiest shootin' stunts I ever seen.\"    \"But he promised my father--\" began Kate, and then stopped, flushing.    If her father was right in diagnosing Dan's character, this was the  most critical day in his life, for there he stood"]]]
