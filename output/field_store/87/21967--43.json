Hail,    god of life, thou lord of love, all men live when thou shinest; thou    art crowned king of the gods. The goddess Nut doeth homage unto thee,    and the goddess Ma[=a]t embraceth thee at all times. Those who are in    thy following sing unto thee with joy and bow down their foreheads to    the earth when they meet thee, thou lord of heaven, thou lord of    earth, thou king of Right and Truth, thou lord of eternity, thou    prince of everlastingness, thou sovereign of all the gods, thou god of    life, thou creator of eternity, thou maker of heaven, wherein thou art    firmly established. The company of the gods rejoice at thy rising, the    earth is glad when it beholdeth thy rays; the peoples that have been    long dead come forth with cries of joy to see thy beauties every day.    Thou goest forth each day over heaven and earth, and art made strong    each day by thy mother Nut. Thou passest through the heights of    heaven, thy heart swelleth with joy; the abyss of the sky is content    thereat. The Serpent-fiend hath fallen, his arms are hewn off, and the    knife hath cut asunder his joints, R[=a] liveth in Ma[=a]t the    beautiful. The Sektet boat draweth on and cometh into port; the South    and the North, the West and the East, turn, to praise thee, O thou    primeval substance of the earth who didst come into being of thine own    accord, Isis and Nephthys salute thee, they sing unto thee songs of    joy at thy rising in the boat, they protect thee with their hands. The    souls of the East follow thee, the souls of the West praise thee. Thou    art the ruler of all the gods, and thou hast joy of heart within thy    shrine; for the Serpent-fiend Nak hath been condemned to the fire, and    thy heart shall be joyful for ever.\"    From the considerations set forth in the preceding pages, and from the  extracts from religious texts of various periods, and from the hymns  quoted, the reader may himself judge the views which the ancient  Egyptian held concerning God Almighty and his visible type and symbol  R[=a], the Sun-god. Egyptologists differ in their interpretations of  certain passages, but agree as to general facts. In dealing with the  facts it cannot be too clearly understood that the religious ideas of  the prehistoric Egyptian were very different from those of the cultured  priest of Memphis in the IInd dynasty, or those of the worshippers of  Temu or Atum, the god of the setting sun, in the IVth dynasty. The  editors of religious texts of all periods have retained many grossly  superstitious and coarse beliefs, which they knew well to be the  products of the imaginations of their savage, or semi-savage ancestors,  not because they themselves believed in them, or thought that the laity  to whom they ministered would accept them, but because of their  reverence for inherited traditions. The followers of every great  religion in the world have never wholly shaken off all the superstitions  which they have in all generations inherited from their ancestors; and  what is true of the peoples of the past is true, in a degree, of the  peoples of to-day. In the East the older the ideas, and beliefs, and  traditions, are, the more sacred they become; but this has not prevented  men there from developing high moral and spiritual conceptions and  continuing to believe in them, and among such must be counted the One,  self-begotten, and self-existent God whom the Egyptians worshipped.          CHAPTER II.      OSIRIS THE GOD OF THE RESURRECTION.    The Egyptians of every period in which they are known to us believed  that Osiris was of divine origin, that he suffered death and mutilation  at the hands of the powers of evil, that after a great struggle with  these powers he rose again, that he became henceforth the king of the  underworld and judge of the dead, and that because he had conquered  death the righteous also might conquer death; and they raised Osiris to  such an exalted position in heaven that he became the equal and, in  certain cases, the superior of R[=a], the Sun-god, and ascribed to him  the attributes which belong unto God. However far back we go, we find  that these views about Osiris are assumed to be known to the reader of  religious texts and accepted by him, and in the earliest funeral book  the position of Osiris in respect of the other gods is identical with  that which he is made to hold in the latest copies of the Book of the  Dead. The first writers of the ancient hieroglyphic funeral texts and  their later editors have assumed so completely that the history of  Osiris was known unto all men, that none of them, as far as we know,  thought it necessary to write down a connected narrative of the life and  sufferings upon earth of this god, or if they did, it has not come down  to us. Even in the Vth dynasty we find Osiris and the gods of his cycle,  or company, occupying a peculiar and special place in the compositions  written for the benefit of the dead, and the stone and other monuments  which belong to still earlier periods mention ceremonies the performance  of which assumed the substantial accuracy of the history of Osiris as  made known to us by later writers. But we have a connected history of  Osiris which, though not written in Egyptian, contains so much that is  of Egyptian origin that we may be sure that its author drew his  information from Egyptian sources: I refer to the work, _De Iside et  Osiride_, of the Greek writer, Plutarch, who flourished about the middle  of the first century of our era. In it, unfortunately, Plutarch  identifies certain of the Egyptian gods with the gods of the Greeks, and  he adds a number of statements which rest either upon his own  imagination, or are the results of misinformation. The translation  [Footnote: _Plutarchi de Iside et Osirids liber: Graece et Anglice_. By  S. Squire, Cambridge, 1744.] by Squire runs as follows:--      \"Rhea, [Footnote: _i.e._, Nut.] say they, having accompanied Saturn    [Footnote: _i.e._, Seb.] by stealth, was discovered by the Sun,    [Footnote: _i.e._, R[=a].] who hereupon denounced a curse upon her,    'that she should not he delivered in any month or year'--Mercury,    however, being likewise in love with the same goddess, in recompense    of the favours which he had received from her, plays at tables with    the Moon, and wins from her the seventieth part of each of her    illuminations; these several parts, mating in the whole five days, he    afterwards joined together, and added to the three hundred and sixty,    of which the year formerly consisted, which days therefore are even    yet called by the Egyptians the Epact or superadded, and observed by    them as the birthdays of their gods. For upon the first of them, say    they, was OSIRIS born, just at whose entrance into the world a voice    was heard, saying, 'The lord of all the earth is born.' There are some    indeed who relate this circumstance in a different manner, as that a    certain person, named Pamyles, as he was fetching water from the    temple of Jupiter at Thebes, heard a voice commanding him to proclaim    aloud that 'the good and great king Osiris was then born'; and that    for this reason Saturn committed the education of the child to him,    and that in memory of this event the Pamylia were afterwards    instituted, a festival much resembling the Phalliphoria or Priapeia of    the Greeks. Upon the second of these days was AROUERIS [Footnote:    _i.e._, Hera-ur, \"Horus the Elder.\"] born, whom some call Apollo, and    others distinguish by the name of the elder Orus. Upon the third Typho    [Footnote: _i.e._, Set.] came into the world, being born neither at    the proper time, nor by the proper place, but forcing his way through    a wound which he had made in his mother's side. ISIS was born upon the    fourth of them in the marshes of Egypt, as NEPTHYS was upon the last,    whom some call Teleute and Aphrodite, and others Nike--Now as to the    fathers of these children, the two first of them are said to have been    begotten by the Sun, Isis by Mercury, Typho and Nepthys by Saturn; and    accordingly, the third of these superadded days, because it was looked    upon as the birthday of Typho, was regarded by the kings as    inauspicious, and consequently they neither transacted any business on    it, or even suffered themselves to take any refreshment until the    evening. They further add, that Typho married Nepthys; and that Isis    and Osiris, having a mutual affection, loved each other in their    mother's womb before they were born, and that from this commerce    sprang Aroueris, whom the Egyptians likewise call the elder Orus, and    the Greeks Apollo.      \"Osiris, being now become king of Egypt, applied himself towards    civilizing his countrymen, by turning them from their former indigent    and barbarous course of life; he moreover taught them how to cultivate    and improve the fruits of the earth; he gave them a body of laws to    regulate their conduct by, and instructed them in that reverence and    worship which they were to pay to the gods. With the same good    disposition he afterwards travelled over the rest of the world    inducing the people everywhere to submit to his discipline; not indeed    compelling them by force of arms, but persuading them to yield to the    strength of his reasons, which were conveyed to them in the most    agreeable manner, in hymns and songs, accompanied by instruments of    music: from which last circumstance the Greeks conclude him to have    been the same with their Dionysius or Bacchus--During Osiris' absence    from his kingdom, Typho had no opportunity of making any innovations    in the state, Isis being extremely vigilant in the government, and    always upon her guard. After his return, however, having first    persuaded seventy-two other persons to join with him in the    conspiracy, together with a certain queen of Ethiopia"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11281"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 12, No. 334, (#7)"],[1,"or Wales, tourists  would dilate much upon its beauties. At this point the water may be  easily forded; and after a walk of the most delicious seclusion, we used  to reach a bold arch, over which the public road was carried. Here have  been erected some of the antique columns, that, a few years ago, were in  the court-yard of the British Museum.    From this arch a variety of walks, of the most delightful retirement,  present themselves. They are principally bounded with various trees of  the pine tribe, intermingled with laurel and acacia. The road gradually  ascends to a considerable elevation, where there is a handsome building,  called the Belvidere. The road from this spot is very charming. We  descend from this height, through a wild path, by the side of trees of  much more ancient growth than the mass around; and, crossing the high  road, again reach the lake, at a point where its dimensions are ample and  magnificent. About this part a splendid fishing-temple has lately been  erected. Of its taste we can say nothing.    The common road from Blacknest (the name of this district of Windsor  Forest) to the Royal Lodge is strikingly beautiful. Virginia Water is  crossed by a very elegant bridge, built by Sandby; on one side of it the  view terminates in a toy of the last age--a Chinese temple; on the other  it ranges over a broad expanse of water. The road sometimes reminds one  of the wildness of mountain scenery, and at another turn displays all the  fertility of a peaceful agricultural district. We at length pass the  secluded domain of the Royal Lodge; and when we reach the edge of the  hill, we look upon a vista of the most magnificent elms, and over an  expanse of the most striking forest scenery, with the splendid Castle  terminating the prospect--a monument of past glories, which those who  have a feeling for their country's honour may well uphold and cherish.--  _London Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *          SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.      TEA.      The principal article of our commerce with China, namely, tea, is,  perhaps, more singular in its history than any other article of commerce  in the known world. A simple and unsophisticated shrub, in little more  than half a century, has become an article of such general consumption,  that it seems to form one of the prime articles of existence among the  great bulk of mankind. It is the peculiar growth of a country, of which  it forms almost the only link of connexion with the rest of the world. It  forms the source of the largest commercial revenue to the British  Government of any other commodity whatever, and of the largest commercial  profits to the individuals concerned in its importation. Withal, it is  the simplest, the most harmless thing that ever was offered to the  gratification of man,--having, it is believed and argued by many, a moral  influence wherever it is diffused. It is the rallying point of our  earliest associations; it has ever given an additional charm to our  firesides; and tends, perhaps, more than any one thing, to confirm the  pre-existing domestic habits of the British public. Its exhilarating  qualities are eagerly sought after as a restorative and solace from the  effects of fatigue or dissipation; the healthy and the sick, the young  and the old, all equally resort to the use of it, as yielding all the  salutary influence of strong liquors, without their baneful and  pernicious effects. Yet this shrub, so simple and so useful, is delivered  to the community of this country, so surcharged with duties and profits  beyond its original cost, that, did it contain all the mischievous  qualities that are opposed to its real virtues, it could not be more  strictly guarded from general use.    For the whole of our imports, including factory expenses and commission,  the original cost in China amounts to the sum of two millions sterling.  This is wonderfully increased before the British public can have any  access to the article of consumption; thus:--      1. The value of the Company's importations from China     into Great Britain, as established by their own     statements, is                                          L2,000,000    2. On this they charge 100 per cent, for their own     especial benefit                                         2,000,000    3. And the Government duty, as by law established, is     equal to the original cost, and the profits charged     by the company; both forming the _sale price_            4,000,000                                                             ----------                                                             L8,000,000  _Oriental Herald_.           *       *       *       *       *        DEATH OF YOUNG PARK.      It is quite inconceivable with what increased zeal new candidates for  African discovery come forward the moment that the death of any fresh  victim to this pestilential country is announced. To the list of those  who have already fallen, may be added young Park, the son of the late  enterprising Mungo Park, and a midshipman of his majesty's ship Sybille.  He went out in this ship with a full determination to proceed on foot,  and alone, from the coast to the spot where his father perished, in the  hope of hearing some authentic and more detailed account of the  catastrophe than had yet been received. With leave of the commodore, he  set out from Accra, and proceeded as far as Yansong, the chief town of  Acquimbo, distant from the coast about one hundred and forty miles. Here  the natives were celebrating the Yam feast, a sort of religious ceremony,  to witness which Park got up into a Fetish tree, which is regarded by the  natives with fear and dread. Here he remained a great part of the day,  exposed to the sun, and was observed to drink a great quantity of palm  wine. In dropping down from one of the lower branches, he fell on the  ground, and said, that he felt a severe shock in his head. He was that  evening seized with a fever, and died in three days, on the 31st October,  1827. As soon as the king, Akitto, heard of his death, he ordered all his  baggage to be brought to his house, and instantly despatched a messenger  to Accra, first making him swear \"by the head of his father,\" that he  would not sleep till he had delivered the message; it was to inform the  resident of the event, and that all the property of the deceased would be  forthwith sent down to Accra. This was accordingly done, and it did not  appear on examination, that a single article was missing; even an old hat,  without a crown, was not omitted. There was an idle report of Park being  poisoned, for which there appears not the slightest foundation.--_Q.

The value that was set upon the bond-servants in the West Indies, is  curiously exemplified in the following anecdote:--    There was a planter in Barbadoes that came to his neighbour, and said to  him, \"Neighbour, I hear you have lately brought good store of servants  out of the last ship that came from England; and I hear withal that you  want provisions. I have great want of a woman servant, and would be glad  to make an exchange. If you will let me have some of your woman's flesh,  you shall have some of my hog's flesh.\" So the price was set, a groat  a-pound for the hog's flesh, and sixpence for the woman's. The scales were  set up, and the planter had a maid that was extremely fat, lazy, and good  for nothing; her name was Honour. The man brought a great fat sow, and  put it in one scale, and Honour was put in the other. But "]]]
