If at the head of the stairs, he must  bow, and wait for her to precede him in the descent.    If two friends are walking together and meet a friend of one, a  bow is all the salutation etiquette demands; if, however, one of  the two stops to speak to the third, he owes the friend he  accompanies an apology for the delay thus occasioned.    In entering a room, a gentleman must take his hat, cane and gloves  in his left hand, leaving his right hand free for salutation.    If a gentleman, walking with a friend, meets a lady with whom his  friend is acquainted, he must also bow, although the lady may be a  stranger to him. The bow must be very slight and formal, merely,  in fact, a compliment to his friend, and a mark of respect to the  lady.    A gentleman must always return a bow made to him in the street,  even if he fails to recognize the person who makes it. It may be a  person to whom he has been introduced, but whose face he has  forgotten, and if it is an error on the part of the other, a  courteous return of the salute will greatly diminish the  embarrassment of the mistaken party.    In meeting a party of friends with some of whom you are intimately  acquainted, and with some only slightly, endeavor to make your  salutations as equal as possible. A formal bow to one, and a  gushing demonstration of delight over another is a breach of  etiquette. Be courteous and cordial to all.    If a foreigner salute you after the fashion of his own country, do  not draw back or allow yourself to smile, but strive to put him at  his ease by taking no notice of the \"national salute.\"    Kissing in public, even between intimate lady friends, is a vulgar  parade of affection, that a truly refined person will shrink from.    It is an insult to return a cordial grasp of the hand, and hearty  greeting, by a cold bow or a flabby extension of a portion of the  hand. Even if you do not approve of the familiar greeting you  should return it with some show of cordiality.    The Countess de --- speaking of salutations, says:    \"It would seem that good manners were originally the mere  expression of submission from the weaker to the stronger. In a  rude state of society every salutation is to this day an act of  worship. Hence the commonest acts, phrases and signs of courtesy  with which we are now familiar, date from those earlier stages  when the strong hand ruled, and the inferior demonstrated his  allegiance by studied servility. Let us take for example the  words' Sir' and' Madam.'' Sir' is derived from Seigneur, Sieur',  Sire, and originally meant Lord, King, Ruler, and in its  patriarchal sense, Father. The title of Sire was last borne by  some of the ancient feudal families of France who, as Selden has  said, 'affected rather to be styled by the name of Sire than  Baron, as Le Sire de Montmorenci and the like.'    \"Madam or Madame, corrupted by servants into 'Ma'am,' and by Mrs.  Gamp and her tribe into' Mum,' is in substance equivalent to' Your  exalted,' or' Your Highness.' _Ma Dame_ originally meaning high-  born or stately, and being applied only to ladies of the highest  rank.    \"To turn to our every-day forms of salutation. We take off our  hats on visiting an acquaintance. We bow on being introduced to  strangers. We rise when visitors enter our drawing-room. We wave  our hand to our friends as he passes the window, or drives away  from our door. The Oriental, in like manner, leaves his shoes on  the threshold when he pays a visit. The natives of the Tonga  Islands kiss the soles of a chieftain's feet. The Siberian peasant  grovels in the dust before a Russian noble. Each of these acts has  a primary, a historical significance. The very word' salutation'  in the first place, derived as it is from' salutatio,' the daily  homage paid by a Roman client to his patron, suggests in itself a  history of manners.    \"To bare the head was originally an act of submission to gods and  rulers. A bow is a modified protestation. A lady's courtesy is a  modified genuflexion. Rising and standing are acts of homage; and  when we wave our hand to the friend on the opposite side of the  street, we are unconsciously imitating the Romans who, as Selden  tells us, used to stand somewhat off before the images of their  gods, solemnly moving the right hand to the lips and casting it,  as if they had cast kisses.'    \"Again, men remove the glove when they shake hands with a lady--a  custom evidently of feudal origin. The knight removed his iron  gauntlet, the pressure of which would have been all too harsh for  the palm of a fair _chatelaine_, and the custom which began in  necessity has travelled down to us as a point of etiquette.\"    General salutations of a mixed company are not now in vogue in the  best society, where etiquette requires that we recognize only our  own friends and acquaintances.    In meeting at a friend's house where you are visiting a circle who  are all entire strangers to you, remember that as mutual friends  of the host and hostess you are bound whilst under the same roof  to consider yourselves as acquaintances. No spirit of  exclusiveness is an apology for a neglect of this, and no shyness  can excuse a withdrawing into a corner, or clinging to one friend  alone in such a circle.      CALLS.    WHEN ladies have, according to the French custom, set apart one  morning or one evening in the week for receiving callers, it is a  breach of etiquette to call at any other time, unless a short  visit in the city or business that will not admit of delay are the  excuses. An hour in the evening, and from ten to twenty minutes in  the morning are the limits for a formal call.    When there is no time thus set apart, formal calls must be paid in  the morning, but with friends of long standing the evening call is  not only permissible, but often far more welcome.    Morning calls may be made by gentlemen in society upon all the  occasions following:    In answer to a letter of introduction sent to him, or to return  the call if the letter is personally presented.    In return for any hospitality offered to him when visiting another  city, if the entertainer visit his own place of abode.    In return for any favor received or courtesy extended to him by  another gentleman.    In return for an invitation to the house of a friend, whether the  invitation has been accepted or declined, and this call must be  made within the week following that during which the entertainment  was given.    On any occasion when a grief or a joy calls for expressions of  condolence or congratulation in the circle of his friends.    To greet the safe return of any friend who has been abroad, or  away from home for any length of time.    Following any occasion when a lady has accepted his services as an  escort, a gentleman must call to inquire after the health of his  fair charge, and must not delay longer than the day after that  upon which he has escorted the lady.    After a wedding, at the time appointed for the reception of  friends.    When visiting in another city, upon any friends there, or upon  those to whom letters of introduction have been given.    In asking or granting a favor, a call is demanded by etiquette.    The visit or call is a much better institution than the vulgar  suppose. It is not without its objections, consuming valuable  time, and giving occasion for gossip and small talk, but it is the  most agreeable and customary way of turning a mere acquaintance  into a friend. In a friendly call much of the restraint of meeting  in large assemblies is thrown aside, mind meets mind much more  easily in an easy _tete-a-tete_ conversation, and the conversation  may be allowed to partake somewhat more of a personal character  than it could in the ball-room or evening party.    First calls require prompt return, even if you drop the  acquaintance before the second one.    Morning calls must never be earlier than noon, evening ones never  later than nine o'clock.    When calling, if the room seems crowded, do not prolong your  visit.    A gentleman may never call with a friend upon a lady, unless the  friend is previously acquainted, or he has obtained permission of  the lady to introduce him.    In making a formal call, a gentleman must retain his hat in his  hand. An umbrella or cane may be left in the hall, never the hat  or gloves. If the call is made in the evening, the hat and gloves  must be held until the host or hostess gives an invitation to lay  them aside and spend the evening. Strict etiquette requires that  such an invitation shall not be given, or if given, not accepted  on the occasion of a first call.    In making an informal call in the evening, a gentleman may leave  hat, gloves, cane and overcoat in the hall.    No gentleman will prolong a call if he finds his host or hostess  dressed to go out. A brief visit with a promise to repeat it will  place his entertainers at ease, and even if they urge a longer  stay, the very fact that they were preparing to go out, proves  their desire to do so.    A card used in calling must never have anything upon it, but the  name and address of the caller. Nothing can show a greater  ignorance of the customs of society than to use a business card  for a friendly call. A physician may put the prefix Dr. or the  professional M.D., upon his card, and an Army or Navy officer his  rank and branch of service. Thus a civilian's card must be simply:    JAMES LAWTON,  417 L--- Street.    A physician's:    DR. JEROME HAYES,  218 T--- Street, or    JEROME HAYES, M.D.    An Army officer's:    LIEUT. JAMES BENNETT,  U. S. A.    An Naval officer's:    LIEUT. HENRY KEYSER,  U.S.N.    In receiving a gentleman caller, a gentleman meets him at the  door, takes his hat and cane, and places a chair for him, but a  lady does not leave her seat to receive a gentleman, slightly  rising to bow, and resuming her "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],[0,"The King in Yellow (#6)"],[1," he told me where it was to be and who were to be there, and made me  promise to come and be best man. I set my teeth and listened to his  boyish chatter without showing what I felt, but--    I was getting to the limit of my endurance, and when he jumped up, and,  switching his spurs till they jingled, said he must go, I did not detain  him.    \"There's one thing I want to ask of you,\" I said quietly.    \"Out with it, it's promised,\" he laughed.    \"I want you to meet me for a quarter of an hour's talk to-night.\"    \"Of course, if you wish,\" he said, somewhat puzzled. \"Where?\"    \"Anywhere, in the park there.\"    \"What time, Hildred?\"    \"Midnight.\"    \"What in the name of--\" he began, but checked himself and laughingly  assented. I watched him go down the stairs and hurry away, his sabre  banging at every stride. He turned into Bleecker Street, and I knew he  was going to see Constance. I gave him ten minutes to disappear and then  followed in his footsteps, taking with me the jewelled crown and the  silken robe embroidered with the Yellow Sign. When I turned into Bleecker  Street, and entered the doorway which bore the sign--    MR. WILDE,  REPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS.  Third Bell.    I saw old Hawberk moving about in his shop, and imagined I heard  Constance's voice in the parlour; but I avoided them both and hurried up  the trembling stairways to Mr. Wilde's apartment. I knocked and entered  without ceremony. Mr. Wilde lay groaning on the floor, his face covered  with blood, his clothes torn to shreds. Drops of blood were scattered  about over the carpet, which had also been ripped and frayed in the  evidently recent struggle.    \"It's that cursed cat,\" he said, ceasing his groans, and turning his  colourless eyes to me; \"she attacked me while I was asleep. I believe she  will kill me yet.\"    This was too much, so I went into the kitchen, and, seizing a hatchet  from the pantry, started to find the infernal beast and settle her then  and there. My search was fruitless, and after a while I gave it up and  came back to find Mr. Wilde squatting on his high chair by the table. He  had washed his face and changed his clothes. The great furrows which the  cat's claws had ploughed up in his face he had filled with collodion, and  a rag hid the wound in his throat. I told him I should kill the cat when  I came across her, but he only shook his head and turned to the open  ledger before him. He read name after name of the people who had come to  him in regard to their reputation, and the sums he had amassed were  startling.    \"I put on the screws now and then,\" he explained.    \"One day or other some of these people will assassinate you,\" I insisted.    \"Do you think so?\" he said, rubbing his mutilated ears.    It was useless to argue with him, so I took down the manuscript entitled  Imperial Dynasty of America, for the last time I should ever take it down  in Mr. Wilde's study. I read it through, thrilling and trembling with  pleasure. When I had finished Mr. Wilde took the manuscript and, turning  to the dark passage which leads from his study to his bed-chamber,  called out in a loud voice, \"Vance.\" Then for the first time, I noticed a  man crouching there in the shadow. How I had overlooked him during my  search for the cat, I cannot imagine.    \"Vance, come in,\" cried Mr. Wilde.    The figure rose and crept towards us, and I shall never forget the face  that he raised to mine, as the light from the window illuminated it.    \"Vance, this is Mr. Castaigne,\" said Mr. Wilde. Before he had finished  speaking, the man threw himself on the ground before the table, crying  and grasping, \"Oh, God! Oh, my God! Help me! Forgive me! Oh, Mr.  Castaigne, keep that man away. You cannot, you cannot mean it! You are  different--save me! I am broken down--I was in a madhouse and now--when  all was coming right--when I had forgotten the King--the King in Yellow  and--but I shall go mad again--I shall go mad--\"    His voice died into a choking rattle, for Mr. Wilde had leapt on him and  his right hand encircled the man's throat. When Vance fell in a heap on  the floor, Mr. Wilde clambered nimbly into his chair again, and rubbing  his mangled ears with the stump of his hand, turned to me and asked me  for the ledger. I reached it down from the shelf and he opened it. After  a moment's searching among the beautifully written pages, he coughed  complacently, and pointed to the name Vance.    \"Vance,\" he read aloud, \"Osgood Oswald Vance.\" At the sound of his name,  the man on the floor raised his head and turned a convulsed face to Mr.  Wilde. His eyes were injected with blood, his lips tumefied. \"Called  April 28th,\" continued Mr. Wilde. \"Occupation, cashier in the Seaforth  National Bank; has served a term of forgery at Sing Sing, from whence he  was transferred to the Asylum for the Criminal Insane. Pardoned by the  Governor of New York, and discharged from the Asylum, January 19, 1918.  Reputation damaged at Sheepshead Bay. Rumours that he lives beyond his  income. Reputation to be repaired at once. Retainer $1,500.    \"Note.--Has embezzled sums amounting to $30,000 since March 20, 1919,  excellent family, and secured present position through uncle's influence.  Father, President of Seaforth Bank.\"    I looked at the man on the floor.    \"Get up, Vance,\" said Mr. Wilde in a gentle voice. Vance rose as if  hypnotized. \"He will do as we suggest now,\" observed Mr. Wilde, and  opening the manuscript, he read the entire history of the Imperial  Dynasty of America. Then in a kind and soothing murmur he ran over the  important points with Vance, who stood like one stunned. His eyes were so  blank and vacant that I imagined he had become half-witted, and remarked  it to Mr. Wilde who replied that it was of no consequence anyway. Very  patiently we pointed out to Vance what his share in the affair would be,  and he seemed to understand after a while. Mr. Wilde explained the  manuscript, using several volumes on Heraldry, to substantiate the result  of his researches. He mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in  Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of  the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy  depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. \"The scolloped tatters of the King  in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever,\" he muttered, but I do not believe  Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of  the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of  Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he  began the wonderful story of the Last King. Fascinated and thrilled I  watched him. He threw up his head, his long arms were stretched out in a  magnificent gesture of pride and power, and his eyes blazed deep in their  sockets like two emeralds. Vance listened stupefied. As for me, when at  last Mr. Wilde had finished, and pointing to me, cried, \"The cousin of  the King!\" my head swam with excitement.    Controlling myself with a superhuman effort, I explained to Vance why I  alone was worthy of the crown and why my cousin must be exiled or die.  I made him understand that my cousin must never marry, even after  renouncing all his claims, and how that least of all he should marry the  daughter of the Marquis of Avonshire and bring England into the question.  I showed him a list of thousands of names which Mr. Wilde had drawn up;  every man whose name was there had received the Yellow Sign which no  living human being dared disregard. The city, the state, the whole land,  were ready to rise and tremble before the Pallid Mask.    The time had come, the people should know the son of Hastur, and the  whole world bow to the black stars which hang in the sky over Carcosa.    Vance leaned on the table, his head buried in his hands. Mr. Wilde drew  a rough sketch on the margin of yesterday's _Herald_ with a bit of  lead pencil. It was a plan of Hawberk's rooms. Then he wrote out the  order and affixed the seal, and shaking like a palsied man I signed my  first writ of execution with my name Hildred-Rex.    Mr. Wilde clambered to the floor and unlocking the cabinet, took a long  square box from the first shelf. This he brought to the table and opened.  A new knife lay in the tissue paper inside and I picked it up and handed  it to Vance, along with the order and the plan of Hawberk's apartment.  Then Mr. Wilde told Vance he could go; and he went, shambling like an  outcast of the slums.    I sat for a while watching the daylight fade behind the square tower of  the Judson Memorial Church, and finally, gathering up the manuscript and  notes, took my hat and started for the door.    Mr. Wilde watched me in silence. When I had stepped into the hall I  looked back. Mr. Wilde's small eyes were still fixed on me. Behind him,  the shadows gathered in the fading light. Then I closed the door behind  me and went out into the darkening streets.    I had eaten nothing since breakfast, but I was not hungry. A wretched,  half-starved creature, who stood looking across the street at the Lethal  Chamber, noticed me and came up to tell me a tale of misery. I gave him  money, I don't know why, and he went away without thanking me. An  hour later another outcast approached and whined his story. I had a blank  bit of paper in my pocket, on which was traced the Yellow Sign, and I  handed it to him. He looked at it stupidly for a moment, and then with an  uncertain glance at me, folded it with what seemed to me exaggerated care  and placed it in his bosom.    The electric lights were sparkling among the trees, and the new moon  shone in the sky above the Lethal Chamber. It was tiresome waiting in the  square; I wandered from the Marble Arch to the artillery stables and back  again to the lotos fountain. The flowers and grass exhaled a fragrance  which troubled me. The jet of the fountain played in the moonlight, and  the musical splash of falling drops"]]]
