Becoming dreadfully impatient at so much loss of precious time whilst  waiting here, unable to prepare in any way for the journey, I sent  repeated messages to the sultan, demanding his immediate attendance;  but it was not until the 6th of November that I heard definitely of  his approach, and then it was that he was coming down the hill.    On the 7th he came with a host of Akils to Bunder Gori, and put up in  a Nahkoda's hut. This indignity he was obliged to submit to, as he had  not cautioned the merchants who occupied his forts of his intended  approach, and now no one would turn out for him. Finding him so near  me, I longed to walk over to him and settle matters personally at  once; but dignity forbade it; and as he had come with such cautious  trepidation, I feared any over-hastiness might frighten him away  again. He seemed to observe the same punctiliousness towards me, so I  split the difference by sending an embassy by my Abban, assisted by  other powerful Akils, early the following morning, when they held  durbar, and my intentions of travelling were fully discussed in open  court. For a long time the elders on the sultan's side were highly  adverse to my seeing their country, considering no good could possibly  arise from it, and much harm might follow; I might covet their  country, and eventually take it from them, whereas they could gain  nothing. Hearing this, the Abban waxed very wroth, and indignantly  retorted he would never allow such a slur to be cast upon _his  honour_, or the office which he held. He argued he had come there as  my adviser and Abban; his parentage was of such high order, his  patriotism could not be doubted. Had he not fought battles by their  side, of which his scars bore living testimony? and now they wished to  stigmatise him as a traitor to his country! The sultan must decide it.  How could jungle-folk like them know anything of the English and their  intentions?    The sultan listened silently during this discourse, which, though  written in a few lines, took many hours of hot debating, by their  turning and turning every little particular over and over again; and  finally decided it in his usual curt and conclusive manner, by saying,  \"The Warsingali were on the most friendly and amicable relations with  the English; and as he was desirous of maintaining it, he would give  me leave to travel anywhere I liked within his dominions, and to see  and examine anything I chose. But out of fear for the consequences, as  the English would hold him answerable should any disasters befall me,  he could not sanction my crossing over his frontier in any direction,  and more especially into the Dulbahanta country, where wars were  raging, and the country so unsafe that even Warsingali dare not  venture there.\" This announcement was brought back in high exultation  by Sumunter, who thought his success complete, and at the same time  announced to me the sultan's intention of honouring me with a visit in  the evening, which was duly done.    He came a little before sunset, with his bare head shaven, a dirty  coloured tobe thrown over his shoulders, and hanging loosely down to  his sandaled feet.[13] He looked for all the world like a patriarch of  the olden times, and passed me, marching in martial order in the  centre of a double line of men sloping their spears in bristling array  over their shoulders, all keeping step in slow marching order, a scene  evidently got up in imitation of our soldiers. Not a word was spoken,  and the deepest solemnity prevailed. On his arrival in front of the  fort, I drew up my men, and fired a salute to give him welcome. This  was done in right good earnest, by every man cramming his gun with  powder, to excel his neighbour in a loud report, to show the  superiority of his weapon; for such is the black man's notions of  excellence in a fowling-piece. The march concluded, the sultan with  his followers all huddled together and squatted on the ground outside  the second fort, deeply agitated, and not knowing what to do, as they  evidently dreaded what might follow. To dissipate their fears, I  approached his royalty, salaamed, and tried to beguile the time by  engaging them in conversation.    Finding that this had rather the opposite effect, I then retired, and  soon found them all intently wrapped up in prayer, prostrating and  rising by turns, with uplifted hands, and muttering for hours together  without cessation. I then ordered a regal repast to be served them of  rice swimming in ghee, and dates _ad libitum_. This, notwithstanding  their alarm, was despatched with the most marvellous rapacity, to such  an alarming extent, that I required to know how many men were engaged  in eating it. The Abban replied that there were only a few: he would  not allow many to come over here out of a spirit of economy, knowing I  had not much property to spare, though all the rest had wished to  come, and were greatly disappointed. But these men, as is usual  amongst Somali, had prepared themselves for a feast by several days'  previous fasting, and each man would, if I allowed it, swallow at one  meal as much as a sheep's skin could contain. As a gun is known by the  loudness of its report, and ability to stand a large discharge of  powder, to be of good quality, so is a man's power gauged by his  capacity of devouring food; it is considered a feat of superiority to  surpass another in eating.    I have seen a Somali myself, when half-starved by long fasting, and  his stomach drawn in, sit down to a large skinful of milk, and drink  away without drawing breath until it was quite empty, and it was easy  to observe his stomach swelling out in exact proportion as the skin of  liquor decreased. They are perfect dogs in this fashion. I may here  add, that although the Abban in this speech seemed to show so much  consideration for my property, by several recent tricks of his I  entertained much suspicion of his honesty; and this little address,  though uttered plausibly, was too common and transparent a trick in  the East to beguile me. All Orientals have a proverbial habit of  saving their master's property to leave greater pickings for  themselves, and such I considered was Sumunter's dodge now.    8th November.--This morning the sultan, having now recovered, came to  return my salaam of the previous evening, when I opened to him the  purport of my expedition in minute detail: how I wished to visit the  Southern Dulbahantas, cross and inspect the Wadi Nogal, and thence  proceed west to meet my friends, Stroyan and Herne, at Berbera. He  listened very attentively and politely, but at the conclusion repeated  the words I had already heard; adding that the Dulbahantas had  intestine wars; they had been fighting many years, and were now in hot  strife, dividing the government of their country. Not many days since  a report had arrived that the southern portion of them, who occupied  the countries about one hundred miles due south of Bunder HÃ©is, had  had a fight with the northern ones, who were living on the same  meridian, immediately to their northward, and had succeeded in  capturing 2000 horses, 400 camels, a great number of sheep and goats,  and had wounded one man severely: it was therefore impossible I could  go from the northern division to the southern, for I should be treated  as an enemy; and that was the only line on which water could be found  during this, the dry season. Had I come here during the monsoon, I  might have travelled directly in a diagonal line, from the south of  the mountain-range to the rear of this place, into their, the  southerners', country, who were the older branch, and were now  governed by the hereditary and rightful chief, Gerad Mahamed Ali, who  was on the most friendly terms with the Warsingali, and who, being an  old chief, and well respected by his adherent subjects, might have  granted me a hospitable reception.    On the other hand, the northern Dulbahantas, who were also friendly  with the Warsingali, were under no control: the Gerad, by name Mahamed  Ali also, was recently installed in government, and was consequently  very little respected. He (the Warsingali chief) could not, therefore,  give his sanction to my going amongst them, by which my life would be  endangered, and he, for permitting it, would be held responsible by  the English. No arguments of mine would alter the decision of the  inflexible chief; I therefore changed the subject by asking him to  assist me in procuring camels, by which I might go into the interior,  and feel my way thereafter. This he readily agreed to, and begged  permission to return to Bunder Gori to give the necessary orders to  his subjects. His escort then demanded a cloth apiece from me, to be  given them for their trouble in coming over here; arguing that, had I  not required the sultan's attendance, they would not have had to  come;--a plausible, but truly Somali notion of justice; they knew  their proper master would give them nothing for coming to support his  dignity, but thought I might be softer.    10th.--The sultan, not able to do business hurriedly with his rabble  subjects, did not appear again until this morning, and then, instead  of proceeding at once to work, hinted he should like to have the  presents I had brought from Aden for him, as the best method of  showing our feelings to one another. This was not so easily concluded.  I portioned out the things that were intended for him, and wished he  would take them at once away and clear the room, thinking, in my  inexperience of savages, I had only to give, and it would be received  with a hearty Bism-illah; but I was soon undeceived: the things were  taken with a grunt of discontentment; all looked over one by one. If a  cloth was soiled, it must be changed; and then the measurements began  by cubits = 18 inches, or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8419"],[0,"The Journals of Lewis and Clark, 1804-1806 (#6)"],[1,".  wide, I call Nightingale Creek. this Bird Sang all last night and is  the first of the kind I ever herd, below this Creek and the last Passed  a Small Isd on the Stbd.
