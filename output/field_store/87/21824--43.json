Little upon her eighteenth birthday thought Miss Cubbidge, of Number  12A Prince of Wales' Square, that before another year had gone its way  she would lose the sight of that unshapely oblong that was so long her  home. And, had you told her further that within that year all trace of  that so-called square, and of the day when her father was elected by a  thumping majority to share in the guidance of the destinies of the  empire, should utterly fade from her memory, she would merely have  said in that affected voice of hers, \"Go to!\"    There was nothing about it in the daily Press, the policy of her  father's party had no provision for it, there was no hint of it in  conversation at evening parties to which Miss Cubbidge went: there was  nothing to warn her at all that a loathsome dragon with golden scales  that rattled as he went should have come up clean out of the prime of  romance and gone by night (so far as we know) through Hammersmith, and  come to Ardle Mansions, and then had turned to his left, which of  course brought him to Miss Cubbidge's father's house.    There sat Miss Cubbidge at evening on her balcony quite alone, waiting  for her father to be made a baronet. She was wearing walking-boots and  a hat and a low-necked evening dress; for a painter was but just now  painting her portrait and neither she nor the painter saw anything odd  in the strange combination. She did not notice the roar of the  dragon's golden scales, nor distinguish above the manifold lights of  London the small, red glare of his eyes. He suddenly lifted his head,  a blaze of gold, over the balcony; he did not appear a yellow dragon  then, for his glistening scales reflected the beauty that London puts  upon her only at evening and night. She screamed, but to no knight,  nor knew what knight to call on, nor guessed where were the dragons'  overthrowers of far, romantic days, nor what mightier game they  chased, or what wars they waged; perchance they were busy even then  arming for Armageddon.    Out of the balcony of her father's house in Prince of Wales' Square,  the painted dark-green balcony that grew blacker every year, the  dragon lifted Miss Cubbidge and spread his rattling wings, and London  fell away like an old fashion. And England fell away, and the smoke of  its factories, and the round material world that goes humming round  the sun vexed and pursued by time, until there appeared the eternal  and ancient lands of Romance lying low by mystical seas.    You had not pictured Miss Cubbidge stroking the golden head of one of  the dragons of song with one hand idly, while with the other she  sometimes played with pearls brought up from lonely places of the sea.  They filled huge haliotis shells with pearls and laid them there  beside her, they brought her emeralds which she set to flash among the  tresses of her long black hair, they brought her threaded sapphires  for her cloak: all this the princes of fable did and the elves and the  gnomes of myth. And partly she still lived, and partly she was one  with long-ago and with those sacred tales that nurses tell, when all  their children are good, and evening has come, and the fire is burning  well, and the soft pat-pat of the snowflakes on the pane is like the  furtive tread of fearful things in old, enchanted woods. If at first  she missed those dainty novelties among which she was reared, the old,  sufficient song of the mystical sea singing of faery lore at first  soothed and at last consoled her. Even, she forgot those  advertisements of pills that are so dear to England; even, she forgot  political cant and the things that one discusses and the things that  one does not, and had perforce to content herself with seeing sailing  by huge golden-laden galleons with treasure for Madrid, and the merry  skull-and-cross-bones of the pirateers, and the tiny nautilus setting  out to sea, and ships of heroes trafficking in romance or of princes  seeking for enchanted isles.    It was not by chains that the dragon kept her there, but by one of the  spells of old. To one to whom the facilities of the daily Press had  for so long been accorded spells would have palled--you would have  said--and galleons after a time and all things out-of-date. After a  time. But whether the centuries passed her or whether the years or  whether no time at all, she did not know. If anything indicated the  passing of time it was the rhythm of elfin horns blowing upon the  heights. If the centuries went by her the spell that bound her gave  her also perennial youth, and kept alight for ever the lantern by her  side, and saved from decay the marble palace facing the mystical sea.  And if no time went by her there at all, her single moment on those  marvellous coasts was turned as it were to a crystal reflecting a  thousand scenes. If it was all a dream, it was a dream that knew no  morning and no fading away. The tide roamed on and whispered of mastery  and of myth, while near that captive lady, asleep in his marble tank  the golden dragon dreamed: and a little way out from the coast all  that the dragon dreamed showed faintly in the mist that lay over the  sea. He never dreamed of any rescuing knight. So long as he dreamed,  it was twilight; but when he came up nimbly out of his tank night fell  and starlight glistened on the dripping, golden scales.    There he and his captive either defeated Time or never encountered him  at all; while, in the world we know, raged Roncesvalles or battles yet  to be--I know not to what part of the shore of Romance he bore her.  Perhaps she became one of those princesses of whom fable loves to  tell, but let it suffice that there she lived by the sea: and kings  ruled, and Demons ruled, and kings came again, and many cities  returned to their native dust, and still she abided there, and still  her marble palace passed not away nor the power that there was in the  dragon's spell.    And only once did there ever come to her a message from the world that  of old she knew. It came in a pearly ship across the mystical sea; it  was from an old school-friend that she had had in Putney, merely a  note, no more, in a little, neat, round hand: it said, \"It is not  Proper for you to be there alone.\"        THE QUEST OF THE QUEEN'S TEARS      Sylvia, Queen of the Woods, in her woodland palace, held court, and  made a mockery of her suitors. She would sing to them, she said, she  would give them banquets, she would tell them tales of legendary days,  her jugglers should caper before them, her armies salute them, her  fools crack jests with them and make whimsical quips, only she could  not love them.    This was not the way, they said, to treat princes in their splendour  and mysterious troubadours concealing kingly names; it was not in  accordance with fable; myth had no precedent for it. She should have  thrown her glove, they said, into some lion's den, she should have  asked for a score of venomous heads of the serpents of Licantara, or  demanded the death of any notable dragon, or sent them all upon some  deadly quest, but that she could not love them--! It was unheard  of--it had no parallel in the annals of romance.    And then she said that if they must needs have a quest she would offer  her hand to him who first should move her to tears: and the quest  should be called, for reference in histories or song, the Quest of the  Queen's Tears, and he that achieved them she would wed, be he only a  petty duke of lands unknown to romance.    And many were moved to anger, for they hoped for some bloody quest;  but the old lords chamberlain said, as they muttered among themselves  in a far, dark end of the chamber, that the quest was hard and wise,  for that if she could ever weep she might also love. They had known  her all her childhood; she had never sighed. Many men had she seen,  suitors and courtiers, and had never turned her head after one went  by. Her beauty was as still sunsets of bitter evenings when all the  world is frore, a wonder and a chill. She was as a sun-stricken  mountain uplifted alone, all beautiful with ice, a desolate and lonely  radiance late at evening far up beyond the comfortable world, not  quite to be companioned by the stars, the doom of the mountaineer.    If she could weep, they said, she could love, they said.    And she smiled pleasantly on those ardent princes, and troubadours  concealing kingly names.    Then one by one they told, each suitor prince the story of his love,  with outstretched hands and kneeling on the knee; and very sorry and  pitiful were the tales, so that often up in the galleries some maid of  the palace wept. And very graciously she nodded her head like a  listless magnolia in the deeps of the night moving idly to all the  breezes its glorious bloom.    And when the princes had told their desperate loves and had departed  away with no other spoil than of their own tears only, even then there  came the unknown troubadours and told their tales in song, concealing  their gracious names.    And there was one, Ackronnion, clothed with rags, on which was the  dust of roads, and underneath the rags was war-scarred armour whereon  were the dints of blows; and when he stroked his harp and sang his song,  in the gallery above maidens wept, and even old lords chamberlain  whimpered among themselves and thereafter laughed through their tears  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7498"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Grown Up (#6)"],[1," was concocting for her benefit.  \"Why, she's got some two or three millions.\"    \"What--that child?\" cried the listeners, in amaze.    [Illustration: JOEL SWINGING A BIG BOX RUSHED INTO DUNRAVEN HALL.]    \"Yes--the old lady was tough, but\"--he dashed off again, called a  station, slammed the door, and was back in position in less time than it  takes to tell it--\"she was took sudden, while Mr. King's folks was in  Europe, and now that child has turned a handsome old place down  yonder\"--he pointed with his thumb in the direction of Bedford--  \"Dunraven Lodge, the old lady always called it, into a sort of a Home,  and she's chucked it full of children, mostly those whose fathers and  mothers are dead; and every Christmas Day Mr. King takes down a big  crowd, and\"--    Here somebody called him off, not to be seen again till he put his head  in the doorway, and shouted \"Bedford!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Joel, swinging a big box as only Joel could, rushed into the spacious  hall at Dunraven Lodge. \"How are you all!\"    Phronsie disentangled herself from a group around the big fire-place  where the long hickory logs snapped and blazed.    \"Oh, Josey!\" she cried, precipitating herself into his long arms.    \"Here is the toggery,\" cried Joel, setting down the doll-box, while he  gathered Phronsie up in his arms.    \"And you, Josey,\" cried Phronsie, with a happy little hum, \"you are all  here yourself,\" as the group left the fire, and surrounded them.    \"Well--well--well!\" cried old Mr. King, lifting his head in its velvet  lounging cap from the sofa where he had been napping. \"Are you really  here, Joe!\"    \"Just like you,\" greeted Alexia, running down the broad oaken stairs.  \"Here, he's come!\" to Polly, appearing at the head. \"We were finishing  the tree, and we heard the noise. Dear me, Joe, I should think it was a  cyclone,\" as she joined the group, Polly close behind.    Joel tossed her a saucy answer, while Polly got on her tiptoes and  caught his crop of short black hair in her two hands. \"Oh, Joe,\" she  said, dropping a kiss on it, \"it was lovely in you to go back.\"    Joel felt well repaid for losing the jolly run down, and the grand  _entree_ into Dunraven, his soul loved, but he covered up what he  thought, by pulling Phronsie into the middle of the hall. \"Come on,  Phron,\" he said, \"for a spin like old times.\"    \"See here,\" cried Alexia, \"we ought to get back to that Tree, Polly  Pepper, or it won't be ready. Dear me, I dropped a box of frost all over  the stairs; Joel made such a noise.\"    At the mere mention of such a possibility as the Tree not being ready,  everybody started; the last one in the procession, picking up the  doll-box, their movements somewhat quickened, as loud calls were now set  up above stairs, for \"Polly--Polly!\"    \"Come on,\" sang out Joel, who had paid his respects in a flying fashion  to Grandpapa's sofa, and leaping the stairs. \"Goodness me, Alexia, I  should think you did spill this frost. Why didn't you go over more  ground?\"    \"I don't believe we can save one bit,\" mourned Alexia, peering up the  stair-length, each step sparkling with myriad little frosty gems, as if  Jack Frost himself had sprinkled it with a Christmas hand. \"Oh, dear,  why did you come in with such a noise, Joe Pepper?\"    \"Just like a girl,\" said Joel; \"jumps at everything and drops whatever  she has in her hand. You all go up the other stairs; I'll sweep this in  a minute, and save what I can.\"    \"Oh, Joe, don't stop; we want you for the Tree,\" begged Polly. \"Phronsie  has been waiting downstairs all this time for you to come. Let one of  the maids do it;\" Joe already had his head in a closet he knew of old,  opening into the big hall.    \"Give me the broom,\" said a voice close beside him.    \"Eh--what?\" cried Joel, pulling out what he wanted--a soft floor brush.  \"Oh, is that you, Loughead?\" turning around.    \"I believe so,\" said Jack, laughing. \"Here, give me the broom. I'm no  help about a Tree; I'll have the stuff up there soon,\" and before Joel  knew it, he was racing over the back stairs, wondering how it was he had  let that disagreeable Jack Loughead get hold of that broom.    \"It makes me think of our first Tree, in some way,\" said Polly softly,  with glistening eyes, looking up at the beautiful branching spruce, its  countless arms shaking out brilliant pendants, and gay with streamers  and candles, wherever a decoration could be placed, the whole tipped  with a shining star. \"Oh, Bensie, can you ever forget that?\"    Ben looked down from the top of the step-ladder where he was adjusting  some last bit of ornament.    \"Never, Polly,\" he said, his eyes meeting hers.    \"That was so beautiful,\" cried Polly. \"And we had it in our 'Provision  Room,' and Mrs. Henderson brought my bird over, and the other things the  last minute, and\"--    \"I had to,\" broke in Mrs. Henderson with a laugh, and shaking the snips  of green from her white apron, \"for you and Ben would have discovered  the whole surprise. You were dreadful that day.\"    \"I'm glad somebody else was dreadful in those times, besides me,\"  observed Joel from among the branches, where he was tying on the several  presents Alexia handed to him.    \"Well, you see,\" said Polly, with rosy cheeks, \"it was our first Tree,  and we were so afraid the children would find it out, and spoil all the  surprise.\"    \"And did we?\" cried Phronsie, in intense excitement, emerging from the  depths of the Tree, the better to look at Polly, \"did we, Polly, and  spoil it all?\"    \"No, Pet,\" cried Polly, \"you were just as good as could be.\"    \"I remember,\" said Joel, \"you told us stories, Polly, in the kitchen,  and\"--    \"We tooted on our tin horns,\" finished David; \"oh, Joe, do you remember  those horns?\"    \"And that molasses candy,\" said Joel, smacking his lips, \"I remember I  ate mine up before breakfast.\"    \"And did I have any?\" asked Phronsie, turning from one to the other.    \"Yes, indeed, you did,\" answered Joel.    \"Why, did you think we'd forget you, Phronsie?\" asked Polly, a bit  reproachfully.    \"And don't you remember it?\" said David.    \"No,\" said Phronsie. \"I don't; but I remember Seraphina's bonnet.\"    \"It was trimmed with some of Grandma Bascom's chicken's feathers,\" said  Joel.    \"And Mamsie made it out of an old bonnet string,\" said Polly. \"Oh dear,  if only Mamsie were here to-day!\" And a cloud came over her face.    \"But we've Baby Fisher now,\" said Ben cheerfully, looking down at her.  \"He's worth staying at home for, Polly.\"    \"Of course he is,\" said Polly, her gayety returning. \"And dear Papa  Fisher was master of ceremonies then; but he wouldn't enjoy it to-day  without Mamsie. So we oughtn't to wish him here.\"    [Illustration: \"And did we,\" cried Phronsie \"find it out,  Polly, and spoil it all?\"]    \"I wish you wouldn't begin about that Little Brown House, and what  elegant times you had in it,\" exclaimed Alexia, twitching at a present  Joel had just tied on, to be sure it was secure; \"I shall think this  Tree is perfectly horrid, if you do, Polly Pepper.\"    \"Go on--do go on,\" begged several voices. Meanwhile, Jack Loughead had  come silently up into the long hall, and deposited a neat boxful of the  gleaming frost on the table, without any comments.    \"Dear me, there is so much to tell,\" cried Polly, with a little laugh,  \"if we begin about Jappy's Tree.\"    \"Who's Tree?\" cried Livingston Bayley, who had been wrinkling his brows  in great perplexity all through the recital.    \"Why, Jasper's,\" said Polly and Ben together; Joel and David coming in  as echoes.    \"You see,\" said Phronsie distinctly, \"that Jasper and dear Grandpapa  sent the beautiful things to us.\"    \"Mrs. Pepper and Polly and Ben had gotten the Tree ready before,\" said  Jasper hastily. \"Oh! didn't I want to be there!\" he added.    \"Yes; Polly almost cried because you couldn't be,\" said Joel in among  the branches.    \"But she couldn't quite cry,\" said Davie, \"because you see we children  would have found it out. Polly always sang in those days.\"    \"Do you remember how we used to run behind the wood-pile when we wanted  to plan the Tree, Polly,\" asked Ben, \"to get away from Joel and Dave?\"    \"You spent most all your time in the Little Brown House in sneaking off  from us,\" said Joel vindictively.    \"Well, we had to, if we ever did anything,\" said Ben coolly.    \"I should think so,\" remarked Livingston Bayley, delighted to give a  thrust at somebody.    \"And weren't the gilt balls pretty?\" cried Polly, quite gone now in the  reminiscences, though her fingers kept on at their task; \"you did cover  those nuts beautifully, Bensie. I don't see how you could, with such  snips of paper.\"    \"How did he make the balls?\" asked Alexia, forgetting herself in her  interest, and coming up to Polly.    \"Why, we had some bits of bright paper, little bits, you know, and Ben  covered hickory nuts with them, and pasted them all as smoothly; you  can't think!\"    \"Oh, my!\" exclaimed Alexia.    \"And Polly strung all the pop-corn, and fixed the candle-ends somebody  gave Mamsie, and\"--    \"Candle-ends? Why didn't you have whole ones?\" cried Alexia.    \"Why, we couldn't,\" said Polly, \"and we were glad enough to get these.  Oh! the Tree looked just beautifully with them, I tell you.\"    \"You see,\" said Phronsie, drawing near to look into Alexia's face, \"we  were very, very poor, Alexia. So Polly and Bensie made the Tree. Don't  you understand?\"    \"It was really Bensie's Tree,\" said Polly honestly, \"for I didn't  believe at first we could do it.\"    \"Oh, yes, you did, Polly,\" corrected Ben hastily; \"at any rate, you saw  it in a minute.\"    \"And it's the first time you didn't believe a thing could be done, I  imagine,\" declared Jasper, with a bright nod at Polly.    \"Well, Bensie thought of this Tree, and made me see that we could do  it,\" persisted Polly, giving a little quirk to a rebellious pendant.
