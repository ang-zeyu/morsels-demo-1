I will go out and make believe that I am bringing him a  present. I will show you how a messenger ought to behave.\"    \"I'll agree to that,\" said the man; and he stepped inside. The Dean  took the rabbit and went out of the house. He walked up the street to  the next block. Then he came back and knocked gently at the door.    [Illustration]    The door was opened by the man from Mr. Boyle's. The Dean bowed  gracefully and said, \"If you please, sir, Mr. Boyle's compliments, and  he wishes you to accept of this fine rabbit.\"    \"Oh, thank you,\" said the man very politely. Then, taking out his  purse, he offered the Dean a shilling. \"And here is something for your  trouble.\"    The lesson in manners was not forgotten; for, always after that, the  man was very polite when he brought his presents. And the Dean also  took the hint; for he always remembered to give the man a \"tip\" for  his trouble. Jonathan Swift, often called Dean Swift, was famous as  a writer on many subjects. Among other books he wrote \"Gulliver's  Travels,\" which you, perhaps, will read some time.          GOING TO SEA        \"I should like to be a sailor,\" said George Washington. \"Then I could  go to many strange lands and see many wonderful things. And, by and  by, I might become the captain of a ship.\"    He was only fourteen years old.    His older brothers were quite willing that he should go to sea. They  said that a bright boy like George would not long be a common sailor.  He would soon become a captain and then perhaps a great admiral.    And so the matter was at last settled. George's brothers knew the  master of a trading ship who was getting ready to sail to England. He  agreed to take the boy with him and teach him how to be a good sailor.    George's mother was very sad. His uncle had written her a letter  saying:    \"Do not let him go to sea. If he begins as a common sailor, he will  never be anything else.\"    But George had made up his mind to go. He was headstrong and  determined. He would not listen to any one who tried to persuade him to  stay at home. At last the day came for the ship to sail. It was waiting  in the river. A boat was at the landing, ready to take him on board.  The little chest that held his clothing had been carried down to the  bank. George was in high glee at the thought of going.    \"Good-by, mother,\" he said.    He stood on the doorstep and looked back into the house. He saw the  kind faces of those whom he loved. He began to feel very sad.    \"Good-by, my dear boy!\"    George saw the tears in his mother's eyes. He saw them rolling down  her cheeks. He knew that she did not wish him to go. He could not bear  to see her grief.    He stood still for a moment, thinking. Then he turned quickly and said,  \"Mother, I have changed my mind. I will stay at home and do as you  wish.\" Then he called to the black boy, who was waiting at the door,  and said, \"Tom, run down to the shore and tell them not to put the  chest in the boat. Send word to the captain not to wait for me, for  I have changed my mind. I am not going to sea.\"    Who has not heard of George Washington? It has been said of him that  he was the \"first in war, the first in peace, and first in the hearts  of his countrymen.\" He was our most famous president. He has been  called the Father of his Country.          THE SHEPHERD-BOY PAINTER        One day a traveler was walking through a part of Italy where a great  many sheep were pasturing. Near the top of a hill he saw a little  shepherd boy who was lying on the ground while a flock of sheep and  lambs were grazing around him.    As he came nearer he saw that the boy held a charred stick in his hand,  with which he was drawing something on a flat rock. The lad was so  much interested in his work that he did not see the stranger.    [Illustration]    The stranger bent over him and looked at the picture he had made on  the rock. It was the picture of a sheep, and it was drawn so well that  the stranger was filled with astonishment.    \"What is your name, my boy?\" he said.    The lad was startled. He jumped to his feet and looked up at the kind  gentleman.    \"My name is Giotto,\" [Footnote: Giotto (_pro_. jot'to).] he answered.    \"What is your father's name?\"    \"Bondone.\" [Footnote: BON do'na.]    \"And whose sheep are these?\"    \"They belong to the rich man who lives in the big white house there  among the trees. My father works in the field, and I take care of the  sheep.\" \"How would you like to live with me, Giotto? I would teach you  how to draw pictures of sheep and horses, and even of men,\" said  the stranger. The boy's face beamed with delight. \"I should like to  learn to do that--oh, ever so much!\" he answered. \"But I must do as  father says.\" \"Let us go and ask him,\" said the stranger.    The stranger's name was Cimabue.[Footnote: Cimabue (_pro_. she ma  boo'a).] He was the most famous painter of the time. His pictures  were known and admired in every city of Italy.    Bondone was surprised when Cimabue offered to take his little boy to  Florence and teach him to be a great painter.    \"I know that the lad can draw pictures wonderfully well,\" he said. \"He  does not like to do anything else. Perhaps he will do well with you.  Yes, you may take him.\"    In the city of Florence [Footnote: Flor'ence.] little Giotto saw some  of the finest pictures in the world. He learned so fast that he could  soon paint as well as Cimabue himself.    One day Cimabue was painting the picture of a man's face. Night came  on before he had finished it. \"I will leave it till morning,\" he said;  \"then the light will be better.\"    In the morning, when he looked at the picture, he saw a fly on the  man's nose. He tried to brush it off, but it remained there. It was  only a painted fly.    \"Who has done this?\" he cried. He was angry, and yet he was pleased.    Little Giotto came out from a corner, trembling and ashamed. \"I did  it, master,\" he said. \"It was a good place for a fly, and I never  thought of spoiling your picture.\"    He expected to be punished. But Cimabue only praised him for his great  skill. \"There are few men who can draw so good a picture of a fly,\"  he said.    This happened six hundred years ago, in the city of Florence in Italy.  The shepherd boy became a very famous painter and the friend of many  famous men.          TWO GREAT PAINTERS        There was once a painter whose name was Zeuxis. [Footnote: Zeuxis  (_pro_. zuke'sis).] He could paint pictures so life-like that they were  mistaken for the real things which they represented.    At one time he painted the picture of some fruit which was so real  that the birds flew down and pecked at it. This made him very proud  of his skill.    \"I am the only man in the world who can paint a picture so true to  life,\" he said.    There was another famous artist whose name was Parrhasius. [Footnote:  Parrhasius (_pro_. pa ra'shl us).] When he heard of the boast which  Zeuxis had made, he said to himself, \"I will see what I can do.\"    So he painted a beautiful picture which seemed to be covered with a  curtain. Then he invited Zeuxis to come and see it.    Zeuxis looked at it closely. \"Draw the curtain aside and show us the  picture,\" he said.    Parrhasius laughed and answered, \"The curtain is the picture.\"    \"Well,\" said Zeuxis, \"you have beaten me this time, and I shall boast  no more. I deceived only the birds, but you have deceived me, a  painter.\"    Some time after this, Zeuxis painted another wonderful picture. It was  that of a boy carrying a basket of ripe red cherries. When he hung  this painting outside of his door, some birds flew down and tried to  carry the cherries away.    \"Ah! this picture is a failure,\" he said. \"For if the boy had been as  well painted as the cherries, the birds would have been afraid to come  near him.\"          THE KING AND THE BEES        One day King Solomon was sitting on his throne, and his great men were  standing around him.    Suddenly the door was thrown open and the Queen of Sheba came in.    \"O King,\" she said, \"in my own country, far, far away, I have heard  much about your power and glory, but much more about your wisdom. Men  have told me that there is no riddle so cunning that you can not solve  it. Is this true?\"    [Illustration]    \"It is as you say, O Queen,\" answered Solomon.    \"Well, I have here a puzzle which I think will test your wisdom. Shall  I show it to you?\"    \"Most certainly, O Queen.\"    Then she held up in each hand a beautiful wreath of flowers. The  wreaths were so nearly alike that none of those who were with the king  could point out any difference.    \"One of these wreaths.\" said the queen, \"is made of flowers plucked  from your garden. The other is made of artificial flowers, shaped and  colored by a skillful artist. Now, tell me, O King, which is the true,  and which is the false?\"    The king, for once, was puzzled. He stroked his chin. He looked at the  wreaths from every side. He frowned. He bit his lips.    \"Which is the true?\" the queen again asked.    Still the king did not answer.    \"I have heard that you are the wisest man in the world,\" she said,  \"and surely this simple thing ought not to puzzle you.\"    The king moved uneasily on his golden throne. His officers and great  men shook their heads. Some would have smiled, if they had dared.    \"Look at the flowers carefully,\" said the queen, \"and let us have your  answer.\"    Then the king remembered something. He remembered that close by his  window there was a climbing vine filled with beautiful sweet flowers.  He remembered that he had seen many bees flying among these flowers  and gathering honey from them.    So he said, \"Open the window!\"    It was opened. The queen was standing quite near to it with the two  wreaths still in her hands. All eyes were turned to see why the king  had said, \"Open the window.\"    The next moment two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/62"],[0,"A Princess of Mars (#6)"],[1,"voluntarily without a weapon of  destruction.    As we neared the plaza and my presence was discovered we were  immediately surrounded by hundreds of the creatures who seemed anxious  to pluck me from my seat behind my guard.  A word from the leader of  the party stilled their clamor, and we proceeded at a trot across the  plaza to the entrance of as magnificent an edifice as mortal eye has  rested upon.    The building was low, but covered an enormous area.  It was constructed  of gleaming white marble inlaid with gold and brilliant stones which  sparkled and scintillated in the sunlight.  The main entrance was some  hundred feet in width and projected from the building proper to form a  huge canopy above the entrance hall.  There was no stairway, but a  gentle incline to the first floor of the building opened into an  enormous chamber encircled by galleries.    On the floor of this chamber, which was dotted with highly carved  wooden desks and chairs, were assembled about forty or fifty male  Martians around the steps of a rostrum.  On the platform proper  squatted an enormous warrior heavily loaded with metal ornaments,  gay-colored feathers and beautifully wrought leather trappings  ingeniously set with precious stones.  From his shoulders depended a  short cape of white fur lined with brilliant scarlet silk.    What struck me as most remarkable about this assemblage and the hall in  which they were congregated was the fact that the creatures were  entirely out of proportion to the desks, chairs, and other furnishings;  these being of a size adapted to human beings such as I, whereas the  great bulks of the Martians could scarcely have squeezed into the  chairs, nor was there room beneath the desks for their long legs.  Evidently, then, there were other denizens on Mars than the wild and  grotesque creatures into whose hands I had fallen, but the evidences of  extreme antiquity which showed all around me indicated that these  buildings might have belonged to some long-extinct and forgotten race  in the dim antiquity of Mars.    Our party had halted at the entrance to the building, and at a sign  from the leader I had been lowered to the ground.  Again locking his  arm in mine, we had proceeded into the audience chamber.  There were  few formalities observed in approaching the Martian chieftain.  My  captor merely strode up to the rostrum, the others making way for him  as he advanced.  The chieftain rose to his feet and uttered the name of  my escort who, in turn, halted and repeated the name of the ruler  followed by his title.    At the time, this ceremony and the words they uttered meant nothing to  me, but later I came to know that this was the customary greeting  between green Martians.  Had the men been strangers, and therefore  unable to exchange names, they would have silently exchanged ornaments,  had their missions been peaceful--otherwise they would have exchanged  shots, or have fought out their introduction with some other of their  various weapons.    My captor, whose name was Tars Tarkas, was virtually the vice-chieftain  of the community, and a man of great ability as a statesman and  warrior.  He evidently explained briefly the incidents connected with  his expedition, including my capture, and when he had concluded the  chieftain addressed me at some length.    I replied in our good old English tongue merely to convince him that  neither of us could understand the other; but I noticed that when I  smiled slightly on concluding, he did likewise.  This fact, and the  similar occurrence during my first talk with Tars Tarkas, convinced me  that we had at least something in common; the ability to smile,  therefore to laugh; denoting a sense of humor.  But I was to learn that  the Martian smile is merely perfunctory, and that the Martian laugh is  a thing to cause strong men to blanch in horror.    The ideas of humor among the green men of Mars are widely at variance  with our conceptions of incitants to merriment.  The death agonies of a  fellow being are, to these strange creatures, provocative of the wildest  hilarity, while their chief form of commonest amusement is to inflict  death on their prisoners of war in various ingenious and horrible ways.    The assembled warriors and chieftains examined me closely, feeling my  muscles and the texture of my skin.  The principal chieftain then  evidently signified a desire to see me perform, and, motioning me to  follow, he started with Tars Tarkas for the open plaza.    Now, I had made no attempt to walk, since my first signal failure,  except while tightly grasping Tars Tarkas' arm, and so now I went  skipping and flitting about among the desks and chairs like some  monstrous grasshopper.  After bruising myself severely, much to the  amusement of the Martians, I again had recourse to creeping, but this  did not suit them and I was roughly jerked to my feet by a towering  fellow who had laughed most heartily at my misfortunes.    As he banged me down upon my feet his face was bent close to mine and I  did the only thing a gentleman might do under the circumstances of  brutality, boorishness, and lack of consideration for a stranger's  rights; I swung my fist squarely to his jaw and he went down like a  felled ox.  As he sunk to the floor I wheeled around with my back  toward the nearest desk, expecting to be overwhelmed by the vengeance  of his fellows, but determined to give them as good a battle as the  unequal odds would permit before I gave up my life.    My fears were groundless, however, as the other Martians, at first  struck dumb with wonderment, finally broke into wild peals of laughter  and applause.  I did not recognize the applause as such, but later,  when I had become acquainted with their customs, I learned that I had  won what they seldom accord, a manifestation of approbation.    The fellow whom I had struck lay where he had fallen, nor did any of  his mates approach him.  Tars Tarkas advanced toward me, holding out  one of his arms, and we thus proceeded to the plaza without further  mishap.  I did not, of course, know the reason for which we had come to  the open, but I was not long in being enlightened.  They first repeated  the word \"sak\" a number of times, and then Tars Tarkas made several  jumps, repeating the same word before each leap; then, turning to me,  he said, \"sak!\"  I saw what they were after, and gathering myself  together I \"sakked\" with such marvelous success that I cleared a good  hundred and fifty feet; nor did I, this time, lose my equilibrium, but  landed squarely upon my feet without falling.  I then returned by easy  jumps of twenty-five or thirty feet to the little group of warriors.    My exhibition had been witnessed by several hundred lesser Martians,  and they immediately broke into demands for a repetition, which the  chieftain then ordered me to make; but I was both hungry and thirsty,  and determined on the spot that my only method of salvation was to  demand the consideration from these creatures which they evidently  would not voluntarily accord.  I therefore ignored the repeated  commands to \"sak,\" and each time they were made I motioned to my mouth  and rubbed my stomach.    Tars Tarkas and the chief exchanged a few words, and the former,  calling to a young female among the throng, gave her some instructions  and motioned me to accompany her.  I grasped her proffered arm and  together we crossed the plaza toward a large building on the far side.    My fair companion was about eight feet tall, having just arrived at  maturity, but not yet to her full height.  She was of a light  olive-green color, with a smooth, glossy hide.  Her name, as I  afterward learned, was Sola, and she belonged to the retinue of Tars  Tarkas.  She conducted me to a spacious chamber in one of the buildings  fronting on the plaza, and which, from the litter of silks and furs  upon the floor, I took to be the sleeping quarters of several of the  natives.    The room was well lighted by a number of large windows and was  beautifully decorated with mural paintings and mosaics, but upon all  there seemed to rest that indefinable touch of the finger of antiquity  which convinced me that the architects and builders of these wondrous  creations had nothing in common with the crude half-brutes which now  occupied them.    Sola motioned me to be seated upon a pile of silks near the center of  the room, and, turning, made a peculiar hissing sound, as though  signaling to someone in an adjoining room.  In response to her call I  obtained my first sight of a new Martian wonder.  It waddled in on its  ten short legs, and squatted down before the girl like an obedient  puppy.  The thing was about the size of a Shetland pony, but its head  bore a slight resemblance to that of a frog, except that the jaws were  equipped with three rows of long, sharp tusks.          CHAPTER V    I ELUDE MY WATCH DOG      Sola stared into the brute's wicked-looking eyes, muttered a word or  two of command, pointed to me, and left the chamber.  I could not but  wonder what this ferocious-looking monstrosity might do when left alone  in such close proximity to such a relatively tender morsel of meat; but  my fears were groundless, as the beast, after surveying me intently for  a moment, crossed the room to the only exit which led to the street,  and lay down full length across the threshold.    This was my first experience with a Martian watch dog, but it was  destined not to be my last, for this fellow guarded me carefully during  the time I remained a captive among these green men; twice saving my  life, and never voluntarily being away from me a moment.    While Sola was away I took occasion to examine more minutely the room  in which I found myself captive.  The mural painting depicted scenes of  rare and wonderful beauty; mountains, rivers, lake, ocean, meadow,  trees and flowers, winding roadways, sun-kissed gardens--scenes which  might have"]]]
