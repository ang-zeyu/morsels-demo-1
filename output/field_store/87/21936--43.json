You"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10611"],[0,"An Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species, Particularly the (#7)"],[1,"immediately see, with what an additional excuse their  own vanity had furnished them for the sallies of caprice and passion.    To refute these cruel sentiments of the ancients, and to shew that their  slaves were by no means an inferiour order of beings than themselves,  may perhaps be considered as an unnecessary task; particularly, as  having shewn, that the causes of this inferiour appearance were  _incidental_, arising, on the one hand, from the combined effects  of the _treatment_ and _commerce_, and, on the other, from  _vanity_ and _pride_, we seem to have refuted them already.  But we trust that some few observations, in vindication of these  unfortunate people, will neither be unacceptable nor improper.    How then shall we begin the refutation? Shall we say with Seneca, who  saw many of the slaves in question, \"What is a _knight_, or a  _libertine_, or a _slave_? Are they not names, assumed either  from _injury_ or _ambition_?\" Or, shall we say with him on  another occasion, \"Let us consider that he, whom we call our slave, is  born in the same manner as ourselves; that he enjoys the same sky, with  all its heavenly luminaries; that he breathes, that he lives, in the  same manner as ourselves, and, in the same manner, that he expires.\"  These considerations, we confess, would furnish us with a plentiful  source of arguments in the case before us; but we decline their  assistance. How then shall we begin? Shall we enumerate the many  instances of fidelity, patience, or valour, that are recorded of the  _servile_ race? Shall we enumerate the many important services,  that they rendered both to the individuals and the community, under whom  they lived? Here would be a second source, from whence we could collect  sufficient materials to shew, that there was no inferiority in their  nature. But we decline to use them. We shall content ourselves with some  few instances, that relate to the _genius_ only: we shall mention  the names of those of a _servile_ condition, whose writings, having  escaped the wreck of time, and having been handed down even to the  present age, are now to be seen, as so many living monuments, that  neither the Grecian, nor Roman genius, was superiour to their own.    The first, whom we shall mention here, is the famous AEsop. He was a  Phrygian by birth, and lived in the time of Croesus, king of Lydia, to  whom he dedicated his fables. The writings of this great man, in  whatever light we consider them, will be equally entitled to our  admiration. But we are well aware, that the very mention of him as a  writer of fables, may depreciate him in the eyes of some. To such we  shall propose a question, \"Whether this species of writing has not been  more beneficial to mankind; or whether it has not produced more  important events, than any other?\"    With respect to the first consideration, it is evident that these  fables, as consisting of plain and simple transactions, are particularly  easy to be understood; as conveyed in images, they please and seduce the  mind; and, as containing a _moral_, easily deducible on the side of  virtue; that they afford, at the same time, the most weighty precepts of  philosophy. Here then are the two grand points of composition, \"a manner  of expression to be apprehended by the lowest capacities, and, (what is  considered as a victory in the art) an happy conjunction of utility and  pleasure.\"[024] Hence Quintilian recommends them, as singularly useful,  and as admirably adapted, to the puerile age; as a just gradation  between the language of the nurse and the preceptor, and as furnishing  maxims of prudence and virtue, at a time when the speculative principles  of philosophy are too difficult to be understood. Hence also having been  introduced by most civilized nations into their system of education,  they have produced that general benefit, to which we at first alluded.  Nor have they been of less consequence in maturity; but particularly to  those of inferiour capacities, or little erudition, whom they have  frequently served as a guide to conduct them in life, and as a medium,  through which an explanation might be made, on many and important  occasions.    With respect to the latter consideration, which is easily deducible from  hence, we shall only appeal to the wonderful effect, which the fable,  pronounced by Demosthenes against Philip of Macedon, produced among his  hearers; or to the fable, which was spoken by Menenius Agrippa to the  Roman populace; by which an illiterate multitude were brought back to  their duty as citizens, when no other species of oratory could prevail.    To these truly _ingenious_, and _philosophical_ works of AEsop,  we shall add those of his imitator Phoedrus, which in purity and  elegance of style, are inferiour to none. We shall add also the Lyrick  _Poetry_ of Alcman, which is no _servile_ composition; the  sublime _Morals_ of Epictetus, and the incomparable _comedies_  of Terence.    Thus then does it appear, that the _excuse_ which was uniformly  started in defence of the _treatment_ of slaves, had no foundation  whatever either in truth or justice. The instances that we have  mentioned above, are sufficient to shew, that there was no inferiority,  either in their _nature_, or their understandings: and at the same  time that they refute the principles of the ancients, they afford a  valuable lesson to those, who have been accustomed to form too  precipitate a judgment on the abilities of men: for, alas! how often has  _secret anguish_ depressed the spirits of those, whom they have  frequently censured, from their gloomy and dejected appearance! and how  often, on the other hand, has their judgment resulted from their own  _vanity_ and _pride_!             *        *        *        *        *      FOOTNOTES      [Footnote 021: Homer.

We proceed now to the consideration of the _commerce_: in  consequence of which, people, endued with the same feelings and  faculties as ourselves, were made subject to the laws and limitations of  _possession_.    This commerce of the human species was of a very early date. It was  founded on the idea that men were _property_; and, as this idea was  coeval with the first order of _involuntary_ slaves, it must have  arisen, (if the date, which we previously affixed to that order, be  right) in the first practices of barter. The Story of Joseph, as  recorded in the sacred writings, whom his brothers sold from an envious  suspicion of his future greatness, is an ample testimony of the truth of  this conjecture. It shews that there were men, even at that early  period, who travelled up and down as merchants, collecting not only  balm, myrrh, spicery, and other wares, but the human species also, for  the purposes of traffick. The instant determination of the brothers, on  the first sight of the merchants, _to sell him_, and the immediate  acquiescence of these, who purchased him for a foreign market, prove  that this commerce had been then established, not only in that part of  the country, where this transaction happened, but in that also, whither  the merchants were then travelling with their camels, namely, AEgypt: and  they shew farther, that, as all customs require time for their  establishment, so it must have existed in the ages, previous to that of  Pharaoh; that is, in those ages, in which we fixed the first date of  _involuntary_ servitude. This commerce then, as appears by the  present instance, existed in the earliest practices of barter, and had  descended to the AEgyptians, through as long a period of time, as was  sufficient to have made it, in the times alluded to, an established  custom. Thus was AEgypt, in those days, the place of the greatest resort;  the grand emporium of trade, to which people were driving their  merchandize, as to a centre; and thus did it afford, among other  opportunities of traffick, the _first market_ that is recorded, for  the sale of the human species.    This market, which was thus supplied by the constant concourse of  merchants, who resorted to it from various parts, could not fail, by  these means, to have been considerable. It received, afterwards, an  additional supply from those piracies, which we mentioned to have  existed in the uncivilized ages of the world, and which, in fact, it  greatly promoted and encouraged; and it became, from these united  circumstances, so famous, as to have been known, within a few centuries  from the time of Pharaoh, both to the Grecian colonies in Asia, and the  Grecian islands. Homer mentions Cyprus and AEgypt as the common markets  for slaves, about the times of the Trojan war. Thus Antinous, offended  with Ulysses, threatens to send him to one of these places, if he does  not instantly depart from his table.[025] The same poet also, in his  hymn to Bacchus[026], mentions them again, but in a more unequivocal  manner, as the common markets for slaves. He takes occasion, in that  hymn, to describe the pirates method of scouring the coast, from the  circumstance of their having kidnapped Bacchus, as a noble youth, for  whom they expected an immense ransom. The captain of the vessel, having  dragged him on board, is represented as addressing himself thus, to the  steersman:      \"Haul in the tackle, hoist aloft the sail,  Then take your helm, and"]]]
