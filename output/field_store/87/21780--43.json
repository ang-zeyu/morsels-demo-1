They quickly learn all they can from  Europeans and Indians, and to-day, in Mengo and in the other large  towns of Uganda, there are trains and motor-cars and stores, while  steamers on the lake bring European and Indian things quickly from the  coast towns.  There are many Europeans and Indians living in Uganda,  and this is a good thing, because when many people of different races  meet, they learn from one another and so grow wiser.                          4. Europeans help Africans    In this chapter we have read about one of the wisest tribes of the  dark-skinned African people.  The Arabs in the north came to Africa  long ago from their own home in Asia, and the Europeans in the south  came from their home in Europe.  Both these races had learnt by  themselves a great deal more than the African race has done.  This is  partly because their homes were not so hot, and so they had to think  hard to get enough food and to keep warm.  It is partly due, too, to  the way in which for hundreds of years the people of Europe and Asia  have been able to read and write, and have met and learnt from one  another.  The Africans never found out how to write, and so could only  learn from each other by listening, never by reading.  They were shut  off from the rest of the world until one hundred years ago, and all  they knew they had found out for themselves.  But among the Africans  some learnt more than others, and the Baganda are a tribe who used  their minds as well as their bodies in becoming strong.  So by  thinking and learning they grew wise as well as powerful, and now  Europeans and Indians have come to their country they are able to  learn all these other races can teach them, which is far more than any  one race could find out alone.                                      V                               -----------                         THE PEOPLE OF THE CONGO                            1. Towards the Sunset    In the last chapter we read about some of the people who lived in the  Eastern lands south of the desert.  They were among the wisest of the  dark-skinned African tribes.  In this chapter we shall read about some  of the people who live in the Western part of Central Africa.  If the  Baganda walked day after day towards the sunset, they would reach the  land of the great River Congo.  This is not a narrow strip of land  along one river, like Egypt, but a very large country with many great  rivers, but all of these at last pour their waters into one very large  one, which is called the Congo.  Then the Congo takes all the water  from the whole land to the great salt sea.  Like Uganda this country  is very hot, and so, because there is so much sun and so much water,  there are great forests.  In places where there are no trees the grass  and maize grow much higher than a man's head.  In the forests there  are wild beasts--lions, leopards, elephants, and hippopotami--as well  as deer which are good to eat.  Many of the people spend most of their  time hunting in the forests for food and skins.                           2. The Different Tribes    The people of the Congo are all dark-skinned Africans of the same race  as the Baganda, except two tribes which are quite different.  These  other people are called the Pigmies, which means they are very small.  None of the Congo people have made a kingdom of their own like the  Baganda.  They belong to different tribes, each with its own customs  and language.  Most of them wear a piece of bark-cloth or the skin of  an animal for clothing, but some wear very little, and paint or tattoo  their bodies.  Their houses are built of reeds, some tribes covering  the reed-walls with a thick plaster of mud, others leaving them  unplastered.  The roofs of some are thatched with the long grass of  the country, others are made of plaited palm-leaf mats.  Each tribe  has its own way of making a house, but no one builds very big houses  or large villages.  None of the houses last more than three or four  years; but these people do not want their houses to stand for many  years, because they are not like the Baganda who chose a country and  stay there always.  The Congo tribes move their villages after a few  years and live somewhere else.  So villages are always shifting, and  nothing they make is wanted to last long.  Some weave mats and baskets  out of palm-leaves or reeds; others make pottery; others make  iron-headed spears and hoes for their fields, but only a few things  that can easily be carried are wanted to last.  When the village  moves, most of the things must be left behind.  So, until a tribe  decides to stay always in one place, it does not as a rule learn to  make many useful and beautiful things.    Again, often men of different tribes build their villages near one  another, but the people of the two villages keep quite separate.  Each  has its own chief and follows its own customs.  Several villages of  one tribe may all obey a great chief, but no tribe has a chief so  powerful as the king of Uganda.  The Congo tribes have not learnt  nearly so much as some other African peoples.  The customs of each  tribe depend partly on which district of this large country they live  in.  Those who live near the salt sea eat sea-fish, and get salt by  boiling the sea-water in their cooking-pots until the pot is quite  dry, and then the salt is left behind after the water has gone.  It  was clever of those people to find out they could get salt that way.  Others, who live near the great rivers, make canoes out of the  tree-trunks with the inside hollowed out.  In these they go out and  catch river-fish to eat.  Others live in a country good for goats, and  these keep large herds of goats.  Some make good earthenware cups and  pots, others carve wooden ones.  Some wear ornaments made of shells,  some of beads, some of berries, some of teeth; everyone uses the  things he can get most easily.  But each tribe follows its own  customs, and despises those of its neighbours.  They are afraid and  jealous of each other, and there is constant fighting between the  various groups of villages.    Some tribes want to be peaceful, and these plant their food, which is  maize or millet, or some other grain which can be ground into flour,  then made into porridge.  Others are hunters or fishermen, and chiefly  eat meat or fish.  Some live by fighting other tribes, and capturing  their food and slaves.  Some of these are called cannibals, which  means they eat the flesh of human beings.  People who do this are  despised by all other races in the world, as they are so ignorant that  they do not know that it is wrong to eat other men.  Many of the  people of the Congo are not cannibals, but there is always war and  fighting between the different tribes, and it is dangerous to travel  because so many are always watching to rob and kill strangers.  The  lions and other wild beasts are dangerous, but the bands of fighting  men are still more to be feared.  Everything is wild and unsafe, and  there is no law outside the village, so each one has to protect  himself.  Among the dark-skinned Central African people each village  has a chief who keeps order within it, and often a group of villages  of one tribe has a great chief.  There are old laws and customs of  each tribe, and if anyone breaks one of these and injures someone  else, the chief calls him and asks all about it, and punishes the man  who did the wrong.                                3. The Pigmies    Now we will think about the other two tribes who live in this country,  but who are of quite a different race from the others.  These little  red and black Pigmy peoples do not have villages at all.  They are all  hunters, and each man wanders with his wife and children wherever he  chooses.  Then, near the village of some chief of another tribe, he  collects grass and sticks, and builds a little house which is too  small for an ordinary man to stand upright inside.  The Pigmy people  are not so dark-skinned as the other races of Central Africa, and they  are very small, not so high as an ordinary man's shoulder.  They live  by hunting with a bow and arrow.  The Pigmy man respects the chief  whose village he settles in, but he does not fight for him or serve  him as the other people do in his village.  When he chooses, he leaves  that village and goes somewhere else.  If the Pigmies want fruit or  anything the villagers have, they shoot an arrow into it.  Then,  later, when they come to fetch it, they leave a packet of meat in  payment, for these little people never steal.  Although they live  peaceably with the other races, they speak their own language, and  never have anything to do with other villagers, and they only marry  among their own people.  The Pigmy men wear a small strip of cloth,  and the women wear a bunch of leaves for their clothes.  Most people  of Central Africa like to be clean, and when there is enough water  they always wash and bathe, but the Pigmies hate water and are always  very dirty.  They have no cooking-pots, but roast the meat they have  got from hunting on a stick over a fire.  These Pigmy people have  learnt less than any other tribe in Africa, for they do not even know  that it is better to live in villages with others of their own race,  which is the beginning of learning most other things.                            4. Many still Ignorant    So in this chapter we have read about some other people who live in  the very hottest part of Africa.  The Baganda are among the cleverest  Central Africans, and these Pigmies and the cannibal tribes are among  the most ignorant.  But the Congo lands are very large, and there are  many different peoples; they often move their villages, and because  they hate one another they fight whenever they get the chance.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6702"],[0,"Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe (#6)"],[1," removed to Litchfield, Conn.,  and her happy girlhood was passed in that place. Her bright and  versatile mind and ready wit enabled her to pass brilliantly through  her school days with but little mental exertion, and those who knew  her slightly might have imagined her to be only a bright, thoughtless,  light-hearted girl. In Boston, at the age of twenty, she took lessons  in music and drawing, and became so proficient in these branches as  to secure a position as teacher in a young ladies' school, kept by  a Rev. Mr. Judd, an Episcopal clergyman, at New London, Conn. About  this time she formed the acquaintance of Professor Alexander Metcalf  Fisher, of Yale College, one of the most distinguished young men in  New England. In January of the year 1822 they became engaged, and the  following spring Professor Fisher sailed for Europe to purchase books  and scientific apparatus for the use of his department in the college.    In his last letter to Miss Beecher, dated March 31, 1822, he writes:--    \"I set out at 10 precisely to-morrow, in the Albion for Liverpool; the  ship has no superior in the whole number of excellent vessels belonging  to this port, and Captain Williams is regarded as first on their list  of commanders. The accommodations are admirable--fare $140. Unless our  ship should speak some one bound to America on the passage, you will  probably not hear from me under two months.\"    Before two months had passed came vague rumors of a terrible shipwreck  on the coast of Ireland. Then the tidings that the Albion was lost.  Then came a letter from Mr. Pond, at Kinsale, Ireland, dated May 2,  1822:--    \"You have doubtless heard of the shipwreck of the Albion packet of New  York, bound to Liverpool. It was a melancholy shipwreck. It happened  about four o'clock on the morning of the 22d of April. Professor  Fisher, of Yale College, was one of the passengers. Out of twenty-three  cabin passengers, but one reached the shore. He is a Mr. Everhart,  of Chester County, Pennsylvania. He informs me that Professor Fisher  was injured by things that fetched away in the cabin at the time the  ship was knocked down. This was between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening  of the twenty-first. Mr. Fisher, though badly bruised, was calm and  resolute, and assisted Captain Williams by taking the injured compass  to his berth and repairing it. About five minutes before the vessel  struck Captain Williams informed the passengers of their danger, and  all went on deck except Professor Fisher, who remained sitting in his  berth. Mr. Everhart was the last person who left the cabin, and the  last who ever saw Professor Fisher alive.\"    I should not have spoken of this incident of family history with  such minuteness, except for the fact that it is so much a part of  Mrs. Stowe's life as to make it impossible to understand either  her character or her most important works without it. Without this  incident \"The Minister's Wooing\" never would have been written, for  both Mrs. Marvyn's terrible soul struggles and old Candace's direct  and effective solution of all religious difficulties find their origin  in this stranded, storm-beaten ship on the coast of Ireland, and the  terrible mental conflicts through which her sister afterward passed,  for she believed Professor Fisher eternally lost. No mind more directly  and powerfully influenced Harriet's than that of her sister Catherine,  unless it was her brother Edward's, and that which acted with such  overwhelming power on the strong, unyielding mind of the older sister  must have, in time, a permanent and abiding influence on the mind of  the younger.    After Professor Fisher's death his books came into Miss Beecher's  possession, and among them was a complete edition of Scott's works. It  was an epoch in the family history when Doctor Beecher came down-stairs  one day with a copy of \"Ivanhoe\" in his hand, and said: \"I have always  said that my children should not read novels, but they must read these.\"    The two years following the death of Professor Fisher were passed by  Miss Catherine Beecher at Franklin, Mass., at the home of Professor  Fisher's parents, where she taught his two sisters, studied mathematics  with his brother Willard, and listened to Doctor Emmons' fearless  and pitiless preaching. Hers was a mind too strong and buoyant to be  crushed and prostrated by that which would have driven a weaker and  less resolute nature into insanity. Of her it may well be said:--        \"She faced the spectres of the mind       And laid them, thus she came at length       To find a stronger faith her own.\"    Gifted naturally with a capacity for close metaphysical analysis and a  robust fearlessness in following her premises to a logical conclusion,  she arrived at results startling and original, if not always of  permanent value.    In 1840 she published in the \"Biblical Repository\" an article on Free  Agency, which has been acknowledged by competent critics as the ablest  refutation of Edwards on \"The Will\" which has appeared. An amusing  incident connected with this publication may not be out of place here.  A certain eminent theological professor of New England, visiting a  distinguished German theologian and speaking of this production, said:  \"The ablest refutation of Edwards on 'The Will' which was ever written  is the work of a woman, the daughter of Dr. Lyman Beecher.\" The worthy  Teuton raised both hands in undisguised astonishment. \"You have a woman  that can write an able refutation of Edwards on 'The Will'? God forgive  Christopher Columbus for discovering America!\"    Not finding herself able to love a God whom she thought of in her own  language as \"a perfectly happy being, unmoved by my sorrows or tears,  and looking upon me only with dislike and aversion,\" she determined \"to  find happiness in living to do good.\" \"It was right to pray and read  the Bible, so I prayed and read. It was right to try to save others,  so I labored for their salvation. I never had any fear of punishment  or hope of reward all these years.\" She was tormented with doubts.  \"What has the Son of God done which the meanest and most selfish  creature upon earth would not have done? After making such a wretched  race and placing them in such disastrous circumstances, somehow,  without any sorrow or trouble, Jesus Christ had a human nature that  suffered and died. If something else besides ourselves will do all the  suffering, who would not save millions of wretched beings and receive  all the honor and gratitude without any of the trouble? Sometimes when  such thoughts passed through my mind, I felt that it was all pride,  rebellion, and sin.\"    So she struggles on, sometimes floundering deep in the mire of doubt,  and then lifted for the moment above it by her naturally buoyant  spirits, and general tendency to look on the bright side of things. In  this condition of mind, she came to Hartford in the winter of 1824,  and began a school with eight scholars, and it was in the practical  experience of teaching that she found a final solution of all her  difficulties. She continues:--    \"After two or three years I commenced giving instruction in mental  philosophy, and at the same time began a regular course of lectures  and instructions from the Bible, and was much occupied with plans for  governing my school, and in devising means to lead my pupils to become  obedient, amiable, and pious. By degrees I finally arrived at the  following principles in the government of my school:--    \"First. It is indispensable that my scholars should feel that I am  sincerely and deeply interested in their best happiness, and the more I  can convince them of this, the more ready will be their obedience.    \"Second. The preservation of authority and order depends upon the  certainty that unpleasant consequences to themselves will inevitably be  the result of doing wrong.    \"Third. It is equally necessary, to preserve my own influence and their  affection, that they should feel that punishment is the natural result  of wrong-doing in such a way that they shall regard themselves, instead  of me, as the cause of their punishment.    \"Fourth. It is indispensable that my scholars should see that my  requisitions are reasonable. In the majority of cases this can be  shown, and in this way such confidence will be the result that they  will trust to my judgment and knowledge, in cases where no explanation  can be given.    \"Fifth. The more I can make my scholars feel that I am actuated by a  spirit of self-denying benevolence, the more confidence they will feel  in me, and the more they will be inclined to submit to self-denying  duties for the good of others.    \"After a while I began to compare my experience with the government of  God. I finally got through the whole subject, and drew out the results,  and found that all my difficulties were solved and all my darkness  dispelled.\"    Her solution in brief is nothing more than that view of the divine  nature which was for so many years preached by her brother, Henry Ward  Beecher, and set forth in the writings of her sister Harriet,--the  conception of a being of infinite love, patience, and kindness who  suffers with man. The sufferings of Christ on the cross were not the  sufferings of his human nature merely, but the sufferings of the  divine nature in Him. In Christ we see the only revelation of God, and  that is the revelation of one that suffers. This is the fundamental  idea in \"The Minister's Wooing,\" and it is the idea of God in which the  storm-tossed soul of the older sister at last found rest. All this was  directly opposed to that fundamental principle of theologians that God,  being the infinitely perfect Being, cannot suffer, because suffering  indicates imperfection. To Miss Beecher's mind the lack of ability to  suffer with his suffering creatures was a more serious imperfection.  Let the reader turn to the twenty-fourth chapter of \"The"]]]
