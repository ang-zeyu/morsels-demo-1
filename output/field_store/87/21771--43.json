She  looked across the table at Arthur with a pleasant smile on her  countenance, but he averted his eyes with an angry scowl; and with a  slight sigh she turned away her head, and did not look at him again  during the meal.    Pompey executed his commission faithfully; and when Elsie returned to  her own room after her evening hour with Miss Rose, Chloe pointed out  the little ship standing on the mantel.    \"Oh! it's a little beauty,\" cried Elsie, clapping her hands and dancing  up and down with delight; \"how Arthur will be pleased! Now, mammy, can  you take it to the school-room, and put it on Master Arthur's desk,  without anybody seeing you?\"    \"Ole Chloe'll try, darlin,\" she said, taking it in her hands.    \"Oh! wait one moment,\" exclaimed Elsie, and taking a card, she wrote on  it, \"A present to Arthur, from his niece Elsie.\" Then laying it on the  deck of the little vessel. \"There, mammy,\" she said, \"I think that will  do; but please look out first to see whether any one is in the hall.\"    \"Coast all clear, darlin',\" replied Chloe, after a careful survey; \"all  de chillens am in bed before dis time, I spec.\" And taking a candle in  one hand and the little ship in the other, she started for the  school-room. She soon returned with a broad grin of satisfaction on her  black face, saying, \"All right, darlin', I put him on Massa Arthur's  desk, an' nobody de wiser.\"    So Elsie went to bed very happy in the thought of the pleasure Arthur  would have in receiving her present.    She was hurrying down to the breakfast-room the next morning, a little  in advance of Miss Rose, who had stopped to speak to Adelaide, when  Arthur came running up behind her, having just come in by a side door  from the garden, and seizing her round the waist, he said, \"Thank you,  Elsie; you're a real good girl! She sails beautifully. I've been trying  her on the pond. But it mustn't be a _present;_ you must let me pay you  back when I get my allowance.\"    \"Oh! no, Arthur, that would spoil it all,\" she answered quickly; \"you  are entirely welcome, and you know my allowance is so large that half  the time I have more money than I know how to spend.\"    \"I should like to see the time that would be the case with me,\" said  he, laughing. Then in a lower tone, \"Elsie, I'm sorry I teased you so.  I'll not do it again soon.\"    Elsie answered him with a grateful look, as she stepped past him and  quietly took her place at the table.    Arthur kept his word, and for many weeks entirely refrained from  teasing Elsie, and while freed from that annoyance she was always able  to have her tasks thoroughly prepared; and though her governess was  often unreasonable and exacting, and there was scarcely a day in which  she was not called upon to yield her own wishes or pleasures, or in  some way to inconvenience herself to please Walter or Enna, or  occasionally the older members of the family, yet it was an unusually  happy winter to her, for Rose Allison's love and uniform kindness shed  sunshine on her path. She had learned to yield readily to others, and  when fretted or saddened by unjust or unkind treatment, a few moments  alone with her precious Bible and her loved Saviour made all right  again, and she would come from those sweet communings looking as  serenely happy as if she had never known an annoyance. She was a wonder  to all the family. Her grandfather would sometimes look at her as,  without a frown or a pout, she would give up her own wishes to Enna,  and shaking his head, say, \"She's no Dinsmore, or she would know how to  stand up for her own rights better than that. _I_ don't like such  tame-spirited people. She's not Horace's child; it never was an easy  matter to impose upon or conquer him. He was a boy of spirit.\"    \"What a strange child Elsie is?\" Adelaide remarked to her friend one  day. \"I am often surprised to see how sweetly she gives up to all of  us; really she has a lovely temper. I quite envy her; it was always  hard for me to give up my own way.\"    \"I do not believe it was easy for her at first,\" said Rose. \"I think  her sweet disposition is the fruit of a work of grace in her heart. It  is the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which God alone can bestow.\"    \"I wish I had it, then,\" said Adelaide, sighing.    \"You have only to go to the right source to obtain it, dear Adelaide,\"  replied her friend, gently.    \"And yet,\" said Adelaide, \"I must say I sometimes think that, as papa  says, there is something mean-spirited and cowardly in always giving up  to other people.\"    \"It would indeed be cowardly and wrong to give up _principle_,\" replied  Rose, \"but surely it is noble and generous to give up our own wishes to  another, where no principle is involved.\"    \"Certainly, you are right,\" said Adelaide, musingly. \"And now I  recollect that, readily as Elsie gives up her own wishes to others on  ordinary occasions, I have never known her to sacrifice principle; but,  on the contrary, she has several times made mamma excessively angry by  refusing to romp and play with Enna on the Sabbath, or to deceive papa  when questioned with regard to some of Arthur's misdeeds; yet she has  often borne the blame of his faults, when she might have escaped by  telling of him. Elsie is certainly very different from any of the rest  of us, and if it is piety that makes her what she is, I think piety is  a very lovely thing.\"    Elsie's mornings were spent in the school-room; in the afternoon she  walked, or rode out, sometimes in company with her young uncles and  aunts, and sometimes alone, a negro boy following at a respectful  distance, as a protector. In the evening there was almost always  company in the parlor, and she found it pleasanter to sit beside the  bright wood-fire in her own room, with her fond old nurse for a  companion, than to stay there, or with the younger ones in the  sitting-room or nursery. If she had no lesson to learn, she usually  read aloud to Chloe, as she sat knitting by the fire, and the Bible was  the book generally preferred by both; and then when she grew weary of  reading, she would often take a stool, and sitting down close to Chloe,  put her head in her lap, saying, \"Now, mammy, tell me about mamma.\"    And then for the hundredth time or more the old woman would go over the  story of the life and death of her \"dear young missus,\" as she always  called her; telling of her beauty, her goodness, and of her sorrows and  sufferings during the last year of her short life.    It was a story which never lost its charm for Elsie; a story which the  one never wearied of telling, nor the other of hearing. Elsie would sit  listening, with her mother's miniature in her hand, gazing at it with  tearful eyes, then press it to her lips, murmuring, \"My own mamma;  poor, dear mamma.\" And when Chloe had finished that story she would  usually say, \"Now, mammy, tell me all about papa.\"    But upon this subject Chloe had very little information to give. She  knew him only as a gay, handsome young stranger, whom she had seen  occasionally during a few months, and who had stolen all the sunshine  from her beloved young mistress' life, and left her to die alone; yet  she did not blame him when speaking to his child, for the young wife  had told her that he had not forsaken her of his own free choice; and  though she could not quite banish from her own mind the idea that he  had not been altogether innocent in the matter, she breathed no hint of  it to Elsie; for Chloe was a sensible woman, and knew that to lead the  little one to think ill of her only remaining parent would but tend to  make her unhappy.    Sometimes Elsie would ask very earnestly, \"Do you thing papa loves  Jesus, mammy?\" And Chloe would reply with a doubtful shake of the head,  \"Dunno, darlin'; but ole Chloe prays for him ebery day.\"    \"And so do I,\" Elsie would answer; \"dear, dear papa, how I wish he  would come home!\"    And so the winter glided away, and spring came, and Miss Allison must  soon return home. It was now the last day of March, and her departure  had been fixed for the second of April. For a number of weeks Elsie had  been engaged, during all her spare moments, in knitting a purse for  Rose, wishing to give her something which was the work of her own  hands, knowing that as such it would be more prized by her friend than  a costlier gift. She had just returned from her afternoon ride, and  taking out her work she sat down to finish it. She was in her own room,  with no companion but Chloe, who sat beside her knitting as usual.    Elsie worked on silently for some time, then suddenly holding up her  purse, she exclaimed, \"See, mammy, it is all done but putting on the  tassel! Isn't it pretty? and won't dear Miss Allison be pleased with  it?\"    It really was very pretty indeed, of crimson and gold, and beautifully  knit, and Chloe, looking at it with admiring eyes, said, \"I spec she  will, darlin'. I tink it's berry handsome.\"    At this moment Enna opened the door and came in.    Elsie hastily attempted to conceal the purse by thrusting it into her  pocket, but it was too late, for Enna had seen it, and running toward  her, cried out, \"Now, Elsie, just give that to me!\"    \"No, Enna,\" replied Elsie, mildly, \"I cannot let you have it, because  it is for Miss Rose.\"    \"I will have it,\" exclaimed the child, resolutely, \"and if you don't  give"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],[0,"An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#6)"],[1,"the inclosure  was that of finding the remains of the houses of the people who lived  in this old town. Of them about 70 were traced out and located on the  map by Professor Buchanan, of Lebanon, who made the survey for Mr.  Putnam. Under the floors of hard clay, which was in places much burnt,  Mr. Putnam found the graves of children. As only the bodies of adults  had been placed in the one mound devoted to burial, and as nearly  every site of a house he explored had from one to four graves of  children under the clay floor, he was convinced that it was a regular  custom to bury the children in that way. He also found that the  children had been undoubtedly treated with affection, as in their  small graves were found many of the best pieces of pottery he  obtained, and also quantities of shell-beads, several large pearls,  and many other objects which were probably the playthings of the  little ones while living.\" [Footnote: A detailed account of this  exploration, with many illustrations, will be found in the Eleventh  Annual Report of the Peabody Museum, Cambridge, 1878.]    This cist mode of burial is by no means uncommon in Tennessee, as they  are frequently mentioned by writers on North American archaeology.    The examples which follow are specially characteristic, some of them  serving to add strength to the theory that mounds were for the most  part used for secondary burial, although intrusions were doubtless  common.    Of the burial mounds of Ohio, Caleb Atwater [Footnote: Trans. Amer.  Antiq. Soc., 1820, i, p. 174 et seq.] gives this description.    \"Near the center of the round fort ... was a tumulus of earth about 10  feet in height and several rods in diameter at its base. On its  eastern side, and extending six rods from it, was a semicircular  pavement composed of pebbles such as are now found in the bed of the  Scioto River, from whence they appear to have been brought. The summit  of this tumulus was nearly 30 feet in diameter, and there was a raised  way to it, leading from the east, like a modern turnpike. The summit  was level. The outline of the semicircular pavement and the walk is  still discernible. The earth composing this mound was entirely removed  several years since. The writer was present at its removal and  carefully examined the contents. It contained--    \"1st. Two human skeletons lying on what had been the original surface  of the earth.    \"2d. A great quantity of arrow-heads, some of which were so large as  to induce a belief that they were used as spear-heads.    \"3d. The handle either of a small sword or a large knife, made of an  elk's horn. Around the end where the blade had been inserted was a  ferule of silver, which, though black, was not much injured by time.  Though the handle showed the hole where the blade had been inserted,  yet no iron was found, but an oxyde remained of similar shape and  size.    \"4th. Charcoal and wood ashes on which these articles lay, which were  surrounded by several bricks very well burnt. The skeleton appeared to  have been burned in a large and very hot fire, which had almost  consumed the bones of the deceased. This skeleton was deposited a  little to the south of the center of the tumulus; and about 20 feet to  the north of it was another, with which were--    \"5th. A large mirrour about 3 feet in breadth and 1-1/2 inches in  thickness This mirrour was of isinglass (_mica membranacea_), and  on it--    \"6th. A plate of iron which had become an oxyde, but before it was  disturbed by the spade resembled a plate of cast iron. The mirrour  answered the purpose very well for which it was intended. This  skeleton had also been burned like the former, and lay on charcoal and  a considerable quantity of wood ashes. A part of the mirrour is in my  possession, as well as a piece of brick taken from the spot at the  time. The knife or sword handle was sent to Mr. Peal's Museum at  Philadelphia.    \"To the southwest of this tumulus, about 40 rods from it, is another,  more than 90 feet in height, which is shown on the plate representing  these works. It stands on a large hill, which appears to be  artificial. This must have been the common cemetery, as it contains an  immense number of human skeletons of all sizes and ages. The skeletons  are laid horizontally, with their heads generally towards the center  and the feet towards the outside of the tumulus. A considerable part  of this work still stands uninjured, except by time. In it have been  found, besides these skeletons, stone axes and knives and several  ornaments, with holes through them, by means of which, with a cord  passing through these perforations they could be worn by their owners.  On the south side of this tumulus, and not far from it, was a  semicircular fosse, which, when I first saw it, was 6 feet deep. On  opening it was discovered at the bottom a great quantity of human  bones, which I am inclined to believe were the remains of those who  had been slain in some great and destructive battle first, because  they belonged to persons who had attained their full size, whereas in  the mound adjoining were found the skeletons of persons of all ages,  and, secondly, they were here in the utmost confusion, as if buried in  a hurry. May we not conjecture that they belonged to the people who  resided in the town, and who were victorious in the engagement?  Otherwise they would not have been thus honorably buried in the common  cemetery.\"      CHILLICOTHE MOUND.    \"Its perpendicular height was about 15 feet, and the diameter of its  base about 60 feet. It was composed of sand and contained human bones  belonging to skeletons which were buried in different parts of it. It  was not until this pile of earth was removed and the original surface  exposed to view that a probable conjecture of its original design  could be formed. About 20 feet square of the surface had been leveled  and covered with bark. On the center of this lay a human skeleton,  over which had been spread a mat manufactured either from weeds or  bark. On the breast lay what had been a piece of copper, in the form  of a cross, which had now become verdigrise. On the breast also lay a  stone ornament with two perforations, one near each end, through which  passed a string, by means of which it was suspended around the  wearer's neck. On this string, which was made of sinews, and very much  injured by time, were placed a great many heads made of ivory or bone,  for I cannot certainly say which....\"      MOUNDS OF STONE.    \"Two such mounds have been described already in the county of Perry.  Others have been found in various parts of the country. There is one  at least in the vicinity of Licking River, not many miles from Newark.  There is another on a branch of Hargus's Creek, a few miles to the  northeast of Circleville. There were several not very far from the  town of Chillicothe. If these mounds were sometimes used as cemeteries  of distinguished persons, they were also used as monuments with a view  of perpetuating the recollection of some great transaction or event.  In the former not more generally than one or two skeletons are found;  in the latter none. These mounds are like those of earth, in form of a  cone, composed of small stones on which no marks of tools were  visible. In them some of the most interesting articles are found, such  as urns, ornaments of copper, heads of spears, &c., of the same metal,  as well as medals of copper and pickaxes of horneblende; ... works of  this class, compared with those of earth, are few, and they are none  of them as large as the mounds at Grave Creek, in the town of  Circleville, which belong to the first class. I saw one of these stone  tumuli which had been piled on the surface of the earth on the spot  where three skeletons had been buried in stone coffins, beneath the  surface. It was situated on the western edge of the hill on which the  \"walled town\" stood, on Paint Creek. The graves appear to have been  dug to about the depth of ours in the present times. After the bottom  and sides were lined with thin flat stones, the corpses were placed in  these graves in an eastern and western direction, and large flat  stones were laid over the graves; then the earth which had been dug  out of the graves was thrown over them. A huge pile of stones was  placed over the whole. It is quite probable, however, that this was a  work of our present race of Indians. Such graves are more common in  Kentucky than Ohio. No article, except the skeletons, was found in  these graves; and the skeletons resembled very much the present race  of Indians.\"    The mounds of Sterling County, Illinois, are described by W. C.  Holbrook, [Footnote: Amer. Natural, 1877, xi, No. 11, p. 688] as  follows:    \"I recently made an, examination of a few of the many Indian mounds  found on Rock River, about two miles above Sterling, Ill. The first  one opened was an oval mound about 20 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 7  feet high. In the interior of this I found a _dolmen_ or  quadrilateral wall about 10 feet long, 4 feet high, and 4-1/2 feet  wide. It had been built of lime-rock from a quarry near by, and was  covered with large flat stones No mortar or cement had been used. The  whole structure rested on the surface of the natural soil, the  interior of which had been scooped out to enlarge the chamber. Inside  of the _dolmen_ I found the partly decayed remains of eight human  skeletons, two very large teeth of an unknown animal, two fossils, one  of which is not found in this place, and a plummet. One of the long  bones had been splintered; the fragments had united, but there  remained large morbid growths of bone (exostosis) in several places.  One of the skulls presented a circular opening about the size of a  silver dime. This perforation had been made during life, for the edges  had commenced to cicatrize. I later examined three circular mounds,  but in them I found no dolmens. The first mound"]]]
