Great interest was  taken in the case for a time, and even Mitchell put in his oar and  tried all sorts of ways to assist the Mystery in his weak, helpless,  and almost pitiful endeavours to recollect who he was. A similar case  happened to appear in the papers at this time, and the thing caught on  to such an extent that The Oracle was moved to impart some advice from  his store of wisdom.    \"I wouldn't think too much over it if I was you,\" said he to Mitchell,  \"hundreds of sensible men went mad over that there Tichborne case who  didn't have anything to do with it, but just through thinking on it; and  you're ratty enough already, Jack. Let it alone and trust me to find out  who's Smith just as soon as ever we cut out.\"    Meanwhile Smith ate, worked, and slept, and borrowed tobacco and forgot  to return it--which was made a note of. He talked freely about his case  when asked, but if he addressed anyone, it was with the air of the timid  but good young man, who is fully aware of the extent and power of this  world's wickedness, and stands somewhat in awe of it, but yet would  beg you to favour a humble worker in the vineyard by kindly accepting a  tract, and passing it on to friends after perusal.      One Saturday morning, about a fortnight before cut out, The Oracle came  late to his stand, and apparently with something on his mind. Smith  hadn't turned up, and the next rouseabout was doing his work, to the  mutual dissatisfaction of all parties immediately concerned.    \"Did you see anything of Smith?\" asked Mitchell of The Oracle. \"Seems to  have forgot to get up this morning.\"    Tom looked disheartened and disappointed. _\"He's forgot again_,\" said  he, slowly and impressively.    \"Forgot what? We know he's blessed well forgot to come to graft.\"    \"He's forgot again,\" repeated Tom. \"He woke up this morning and wanted  to know who he was and where he was.\" Comments.    \"Better give him best, Oracle,\" said Mitchell presently. \"If he can't  find out who he is and where he is, the boss'll soon find it out for  him.\"    \"No,\" said Tom, \"when I take a thing in hand I see it through.\"    This was also characteristic of the boss-over-the-board, though in  another direction. He went down to the but and inquired for Smith.    \"Why ain't you at work?\"    \"Who am I, sir? Where am I?\" whined Smith. \"Can you please tell me who I  am and where I am?\"    The boss drew a long breath and stared blankly at the Mystery; then he  erupted.    \"Now, look here!\" he howled, \"I don't know who the gory sheol you are,  except that you're a gory lunatic, and what's more, I don't care a damn.  But I'll soon show you where you are! You can call up at the store and  get your cheque, and soon as you blessed well like; and then take a  walk, and don't forget to take your lovely swag with you.\"    The matter was discussed at the dinner-table. The Oracle swore that it  was a cruel, mean way to treat a \"pore afflicted chap,\" and cursed the  boss. Tom's admirers cursed in sympathy, and trouble seemed threatening,  when the voice of Mitchell was heard to rise in slow, deliberate tones  over the clatter of cutlery and tin plates.    \"I wonder,\" said the voice, \"I wonder whether Smith forgot his cheque?\"    It was ascertained that Smith hadn't.    There was some eating and thinking done. Soon Mitchell's voice was heard  again, directed at The Oracle.    It said \"Do you keep any vallabels about your bunk, Oracle?\"    Tom looked hard at Mitchell. \"Why?\"    \"Oh, nothin': only I think it wouldn't be a bad idea for you to look at  your bunk and see whether Smith forgot.\"    The chaps grew awfully interested. They fixed their eyes on Tom, and he  looked with feeling from one face to another; then he pushed his plate  back, and slowly extracted his long legs from between the stool and the  table. He climbed to his bunk, and carefully reviewed the ingredients of  his swag. Smith hadn't forgot.    When The Oracle's face came round again there was in it a strange  expression which a close study would have revealed to be more of anger  than of sorrow, but that was not all. It was an expression such as a man  might wear who is undergoing a terrible operation, without chloroform,  but is determined not to let a whimper escape him. Tom didn't swear, and  by that token they guessed how mad he was. 'Twas a rough shed, with  a free and lurid vocabulary, but had they all sworn in chorus, with  One-eyed Bogan as lead, it would not have done justice to Tom's  feelings--and they realized this.    The Oracle took down his bridle from its peg, and started for the door  amid a respectful and sympathetic silence, which was only partly broken  once by the voice of Mitchell, which asked in an awed whisper:    \"Going ter ketch yer horse, Tom?\" The Oracle nodded, and passed on; he  spake no word--he was too full for words.    Five minutes passed, and then the voice of Mitchell was heard again,  uninterrupted by the clatter of tinware. It said in impressive tones:    \"It would not be a bad idea for some of you chaps that camp in the bunks  along there, to have a look at your things. Scotty's bunk is next to  Tom's.\"    Scotty shot out of his place as if a snake had hold of his leg, starting  a plank in the table and upsetting three soup plates. He reached for his  bunk like a drowning man clutching at a plank, and tore out the bedding.  Again, Smith hadn't forgot.    Then followed a general overhaul, and it was found in most cases that  Smith had remembered. The pent-up reservoir of blasphemy burst forth.    The Oracle came up with Smith that night at the nearest shanty, and  found that he had forgotten again, and in several instances, and was  forgetting some more under the influence of rum and of the flattering  interest taken in his case by a drunken Bachelor of Arts who happened to  be at the pub. Tom came in quietly from the rear, and crooked his finger  at the shanty-keeper. They went apart from the rest, and talked together  a while very earnestly. Then they secretly examined Smith's swag, the  core of which was composed of Tom's and his mate's valuables.    Then The Oracle stirred up Smith's recollections and departed.    Smith was about again in a couple of weeks. He was damaged somewhat  physically, but his memory was no longer impaired.        HUNGERFORD      One of the hungriest cleared roads in New South Wales runs to within a  couple of miles of Hungerford, and stops there; then you strike through  the scrub to the town. There is no distant prospect of Hungerford--you  don't see the town till you are quite close to it, and then two or three  white-washed galvanized-iron roofs start out of the mulga.    They say that a past Ministry commenced to clear the road from Bourke,  under the impression that Hungerford was an important place, and went  on, with the blindness peculiar to governments, till they got to within  two miles of the town. Then they ran short of rum and rations, and sent  a man on to get them, and make inquiries. The member never came back,  and two more were sent to find him--or Hungerford. Three days later  the two returned in an exhausted condition, and submitted a motion of  want-of-confidence, which was lost. Then the whole House went on and was  lost also. Strange to relate, that Government was never missed.    However, we found Hungerford and camped there for a day. The town is  right on the Queensland border, and an interprovincial rabbit-proof  fence--with rabbits on both sides of it--runs across the main street.    This fence is a standing joke with Australian rabbits--about the only  joke they have out there, except the memory of Pasteur and poison and  inoculation. It is amusing to go a little way out of town, about sunset,  and watch them crack Noah's Ark rabbit jokes about that fence, and  burrow under and play leap-frog over it till they get tired. One old  buck rabbit sat up and nearly laughed his ears off at a joke of his own  about that fence. He laughed so much that he couldn't get away when  I reached for him. I could hardly eat him for laughing. I never saw a  rabbit laugh before; but I've seen a 'possum do it.    Hungerford consists of two houses and a humpy in New South Wales, and  five houses in Queensland. Characteristically enough, both the pubs are  in Queensland. We got a glass of sour yeast at one and paid sixpence for  it--we had asked for English ale.    The post office is in New South Wales, and the police-barracks in  Bananaland. The police cannot do anything if there's a row going on  across the street in New South Wales, except to send to Brisbane and  have an extradition warrant applied for; and they don't do much if  there's a row in Queensland. Most of the rows are across the border,  where the pubs are.    At least, I believe that's how it is, though the man who told me might  have been a liar. Another man said he was a liar, but then _he_ might  have been a liar himself--a third person said he was one. I heard that  there was a fight over it, but the man who told me about the fight might  not have been telling the truth.    One part of the town swears at Brisbane when things go wrong, and the  other part curses Sydney.    The country looks as though a great ash-heap had been spread out there,  and mulga scrub and firewood planted--and neglected. The country looks  just as bad for a hundred miles round Hungerford, and beyond that it  gets worse--a blasted, barren wilderness that doesn't even howl. If it  howled it would be a relief.    I believe that Bourke and Wills found Hungerford, and it's a pity they  did; but, if I ever stand by the graves of the men who first travelled  through this country, when there were neither roads nor stations, nor  tanks, nor bores, nor pubs, I'll--I'll take my hat off. There were brave  men in the land in those days.

MODIFIED SUBJECT.    ADJECTIVES.    +Introductory Hints+.--The subject noun and the predicate verb are not  always or often the whole of the structure that we call the sentence,  though they are the underlying timbers that support the rest of the verbal  bridge. Other words may be built upon them.    We learned in Lesson 8 that things resemble one another and differ from one  another. They resemble and they differ in what we call their qualities.  Things are alike whose qualities are the same, as, two oranges having the  same color, taste, and odor. Things are unlike, as an orange and an apple,  whose qualities are different.    It is by their qualities, then, that we know things and group them.    _Ripe apples are healthful. Unripe apples are hurtful._ In these two  sentences we have the same word apples to name the same general class of  things; but the prefixed words ripe and unripe, marking opposite qualities  in the apples, separate the apples into two kinds--the ripe ones and the  unripe ones.    These prefixed words _ripe_ and _unripe_, then, limit the word _apples_ in  its scope; _ripe apples_ or _unripe apples_ applies to fewer things than  _apples_ alone applies to.    If we say _the, this, that_ apple, or _an, no_ apple, or _some, many,  eight_ apples, we do not mark any quality of the fruit; but _the, this,_ or  _that_ points out a particular apple, and limits the word _apple_ to the  one pointed out; and _an, no, some, many_, or _eight_ limits the word in  respect to the number of apples that it denotes.    These and all such words as by marking quality, by pointing out, or by  specifying number or quantity limit the scope or add to the meaning of the  noun, +modify+ it, and are called +Modifiers+.    In the sentence above, _apples_ is the +Simple Subject+ and _ripe apples_  is the +Modified Subject+.    Words that modify nouns and pronouns are called +Adjectives+ (Lat. _ad_,  to, and _jacere_, to throw).      +DEFINITION.--A _Modifier_ is a word or a group of words joined to some  part of the sentence to qualify or limit the meaning+.    The +Subject+ with its +Modifiers+ is called the +Modified Subject+, or  _Logical Subject_.    +DEFINITION.--An _Adjective_ is a word used to modify a noun or a pronoun+.    Analysis and Parsing.    1.

The lighter lines, placed  under and joined to the subject line, stand for the less important parts,  the modifiers, and show what is modified. [Footnote: TO THE TEACHER.--When  several adjectives are joined to one noun, each adjective does not always  modify the unlimited noun. _That old wooden house was burned._ Here  _wooden_ modifies _house_, _old_ modifies _house_ limited by _wooden_, and  _that_ modifies _house_ limited by _old_ and _wooden_. This may be  illustrated in the diagram by numbering the modifiers in the order of their  rank, thus:--                      |  ==================|=======     \\3   \\2   \\1   |    Adverbs, and both phrase and clause modifiers often differ in rank in the  same way. If the pupils are able to see these distinctions, it will be well  to have them made in the analysis, as they often determine the punctuation  and the arrangement. See Lessons 13 and 21.]    +TO THE TEACHER.+--While we, from experience, are clear in the belief that  diagrams are very helpful in the analysis of sentences, we wish to say that  the work required in this book can all be done without resorting to these  figures. If some other form, or no form, of written analysis is preferred,  our diagrams can be omitted without break or confusion.    When diagrams are used, only the teacher can determine how many shall be  required in any one Lesson, and how soon the pupil may dispense with their  aid altogether.    +Oral Analysis.+--(Here and hereafter we shall omit from the oral analysis  and parsing whatever has been provided for in previous Lessons.) _The,  cold,_ and _November_ are modifiers of the subject. _The cold November  rain_ is the modified subject.    TO THE TEACHER.--While in these \"models\" we wish to avoid repetition, we  should require of the pupils full forms of oral analysis for at least some  of the sentences in every Lesson.    +Parsing.+--_The, cold,_ and _November_ are adjectives modifying  _rain_--_cold_ and _November_ expressing quality, and _the_ pointing out.    2.

COMPOSITION--ADJECTIVES.    +Caution.+--When two or more adjectives are used with a noun, care must be  taken in their arrangement. If they differ in rank, place nearest the noun  the one most closely modifying it. If of the same rank, place them where  they will sound best--generally in the order of length, the shortest first.    +Explanation.+--_Two honest young men were chosen, A tall, straight,  dignified person entered._ _Young_ tells the kind of men, _honest_ tells  the kind of young men, and _two_ tells the number of honest young men;  hence these adjectives are not of the same rank. _Tall_, _straight_, and  _dignified_ modify _person_ independently--the person is tall and straight  and dignified; hence these adjectives are of the same rank.    Notice the comma after _tall_ and _straight_; _and_ may be supplied; in the  first sentence _and_ cannot be supplied. See Lesson 21.    +Direction.+--_Arrange the adjectives below, and give your reasons:_--    1. A Newfoundland pet handsome large dog.  2. Level low five the fields.  3.

MODIFIED PREDICATE.    ADVERBS.    +Introductory Hints+.--You have learned that the subject may be modified;  let us see whether the predicate may be.    If we say, _The leaves fall_, we express a fact in a general way. But, if  we wish to speak of the time of their falling, we can add a word and say,  The leaves fall _early_; of the place of their falling, The leaves fall  _here_; of the manner, The leaves fall _quietly_; of the cause, _Why_ do  the leaves fall?    We may join a word to one of these modifiers and say, The leaves fall  _very_ quietly. Here _very_ modifies _quietly_ by telling the degree.    _Very quietly_ is a group of words modifying the predicate. The predicate  with its modifiers is called the +Modified Predicate+. Such words as _very,  here_, and _quietly_ form another part of speech, and are called +Adverbs+  (Lat. _ad_, to, and _verbum_, a word, or verb).    Adverbs may modify adjectives; as, _Very ripe_ apples are healthful.  Adverbs modify verbs just as adjectives modify nouns--by limiting them. The  horse has a _proud step_ = The horse _steps proudly_.    The +Predicate+ with its +Modifiers+ is called the +Modified +Predicate, or  _Logical Predicate_.    +DEFINITION.--An _Adverb_ is a word used to modify a verb, an adjective, or  an adverb.+ [Footnote: See Lesson 92 and foot-note.]    Analysis and Parsing.    1.
