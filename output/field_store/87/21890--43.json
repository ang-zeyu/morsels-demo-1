I believe he, Andy and Pete Bailey  tried to put up some job on me.\"    \"Maybe they wanted to damage your new battery or car,\" suggested Ned.    \"Hardly that. The car hasn't been started yet, and as for the battery,  no one knows of it outside of you and my friends here.  I'm keeping it  secret. Well, if I'm going to take you home I'd better get a move on.  Wait here and I'll run out Mr. Damon's car.\"    In a short time Tom was guiding the machine over the road to Shopton,  Ned on the seat beside him. The young assistant cashier lived about a  mile the other side of the village, and the two chums were soon at his  house. Asking his friend to come and see him when he had a chance. Ned  bid his chum good night, and the young inventor started back home.    He was driving slowly along, thinking more of his new invention than  anything else, even more than of the mysterious visit of Sam Snedecker,  when the lights on Mr. Damon's car flashed upon something big, black  and bulky on the road just ahead of him.  Tom, brought suddenly out of  his fit of musing, jammed on the brakes, and steered to one side. Then  he saw that the object was a stalled auto. He had only time to note  this when a voice hailed him:    \"Have you a tire pump you could lend us? Ours doesn't work, and we have  had a blowout.\"    There was something about the voice that was strangely familiar, and  Tom was wondering where he had heard it before, when into the glare of  the lamps on his machine stepped Mr. Foger--Andy's father!    \"Why, Mr. Foger!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I didn't know it was you.\"    \"Oh, it's Tom Swift,\" remarked the man, and he did not seem especially  pleased.    \"Hey! What's that?\" cried another voice, which Tom had no difficulty in  recognizing as belonging to Andy. \"What's the matter, Dad?\"    \"Why it happens to be your--ahem! It's Tom Swift in this other auto,\"  went on Mr. Foger. \"I didn't know you had a car,\" he added.    \"I haven't,\" answered the lad. \"This belongs to Mr. Damon. But can you  see to fix your tire in the dark?\" for Mr. Foger and his son had no  lamps lighted.    \"Oh, we have it all fixed,\" declared the man, \"and, just as we were  going to pump it up out lamps went out. Then we found that our pump  wouldn't work. If you have one I would be obliged for the use of it,\"  and he spoke somewhat stiffly.    \"Certainly,\" agreed Tom, cheerfully, for he had no special grudge  against Mr. Foger, though had he known Andy's father's plans, perhaps  our hero would not have so readily aided him. The young inventor got  down, removed one of his oil lamps in order that there might be some  light on the operation, and then brought over his pump.    \"I heard you had an accident,\" said Tom, a chain of thoughts being  rapidly forged in his mind, as he thought of what Sam had told him.    \"You heard of it?\" repeated Mr. Foger, while Andy was busy pumping up  the tire.    \"Yes, a friend who was out riding with you said you had broken a wheel  on Berk's hill. But I see he was slightly wrong. You're a good way from  Berk's hill, and it's a tire that is broken, not a wheel.\"    \"But I don't understand,\" said Mr. Foger. \"No friend has been out  riding with us. My son and I were out on a business trip, and--\"    \"Come on, pop. I've got it all pumped up. Jump in. There's your pump,  Tom Swift. Much obliged,\" muttered Andy hastily.  It was very evident  that he wanted to prevent any further conversation between his parent  and Tom.    \"But I don't understand,\" went on the banker, clearly puzzled.  \"What  friend gave you such information, Mr.--er--Tom Swift?\"    \"Sam Snedecker,\" replied the lad quickly. \"I caught him sneaking around  my machine shop about an hour ago, and when I asked him what he was  doing he said he'd been out riding with Andy, and that they broke a  wheel. I'm glad it was only a blown-out tire,\" and Tom's voice had a  curious note in it.    \"But there must be some mistake,\" insisted Mr. Foger. \"Sam Snedecker  was not riding with us this evening. We have been over to  Waterfield--my son and I, and--\"    \"Come on, pop!\" cried Andy desperately. \"We must hurry home.  Mom will  be worried.\"    \"Yes, I think she will. But I can't understand why Sam should say such  a thing. However, we are much obliged for the use of your pump, Swift,  and--\"    But Andy prevented any further talk by starting the car with the  muffler open, making a great racket, and he hurriedly drove off, almost  before his father was seated, leaving Tom standing there in the road,  beside his pump and lantern.    \"So,\" mused the young inventor, \"there's some game on. Sam wasn't with  Andy, yet Andy evidently knew where Sam was, or he wouldn't have been  so anxious to choke off talk. Mr. Foger knew nothing of Sam, naturally.  But why have Andy and his father been on a midnight trip to Waterfield?\"    That last question caused Tom to adopt a new line of thought.    \"Waterfield,\" he mused. \"That's where Mr. Damon lives. Mr. Damon is a  heavy depositor in the old bank. Mr. Foger is going to start a new  bank. I wonder if there's any connection there? This is getting  mysterious. I must keep my eyes open. I never expected to meet Andy and  his father to-night, any more than I expected to find Sam Snedecker  sneaking around my shop, but it's a good thing I discovered both  parties. I guess Andy must have had nervous prostration when I was  talking to his father,\" and Tom grinned at the thought. Then, picking  up the pump, and fastening the lantern in place, he drove Mr. Damon's  auto slowly back home.    Tom said nothing to his father or Mr. Sharp, the next morning, about  the incidents of the previous night. In the first place he could not  exactly understand them, and he wanted to devote more time to thinking  of them, before he mentioned the matter to his parent. Another reason  was that Mr. Swift was a very nervous person, and the least thing out  of the ordinary worried him. So the young inventor concluded to keep  quiet.    His first act, after going to look at the small motor, which was being  run with the larger, experimental storage battery, was to get out  pencil and paper.    \"I've got to plan the electric auto now that my battery is in a fair  way to success,\" he said, for he noted that the one cell he had  constructed had done over twice as much mileage in proportion, as had  the small battery. \"I'll soon start building the car,\" mused Tom, \"and  then I'll enter it in the race. I must write to that touring club and  find how much time I have.\"    All that morning the young inventor drew plan after plan for an  electric runabout, and rejected them. Finally he threw aside paper and  pencil and exclaimed:    \"It's no use. I can't think to-day. I'm dwelling too much on what  happened last night. I must clear my brain.    \"I know what I'll do. I'll get in my motor-boat and take a run over to  Waterfield to see Mr. Damon. Maybe he's home by this time. Then I can  ask him what Mr. Foger wanted to see him about, if he did call.\"    It was a fine May morning, and Tom was soon in his boat, the Arrow,  gliding over Lake Carlopa, the waters of which sparkled in the sun. As  he speeded up his craft, the lad looked about, thinking he might catch  sight of Andy Foger, for the bully also owned a boat, called the Red  Streak and, more than once, in spite of the fact that Andy's craft was  the more powerful, Tom had beaten him in impromptu races. But there was  no sign of his rival this morning, and Tom kept on to Waterfield. He  found that Mr. Damon had not yet returned home.    \"So far I've had my run for nothing,\" mused the youth. \"Well, I might  as well spend the rest of the morning in the boat.\"    He swung his craft out into the lake, and headed back toward Mansburg,  intending to run up to the head of the body of water, which offered so  many attractions that beautiful morning.    As Tom passed a small dock he saw a girl just putting out in a rowboat.  The figure looked familiar and, having nothing special to do, the lad  steered over closer. His first view was confirmed, and he called out  cheerfully:    \"Good morning, Miss Nestor. Going for a row?\"    \"Oh! Mr. Swift!\" exclaimed the girl with a blush.  \"I didn't hear you  coming. You startled me.\"    \"Yes, the engine runs quite silently since I fixed it,\" resumed Tom.  \"But where are you going?\"    \"I was going for a row,\" answered the girl, \"but I have just discovered  that one of the oar locks is broken, so I am not going for a row,\" and  she laughed, showing her white, even teeth.    \"That's too bad!\" remarked the lad. \"I don't suppose,\" he added  doubtfully, \"that I could induce you to accept a motor-boat as a  substitute for a rowing craft, could I?\" and he looked quizzically at  her.    \"Are you asking me that as a hypothetical question?\" she inquired.    \"Yes,\" said Tom, trying not to smile.    \"Well, if you are asking for information, merely, I will say that I  could be induced to make such a change,\" and her face was nearly as  grave as that of the young inventor's.    \"What inducement would have to be used?\" he asked.    \"Suppose you just ask me in plain English to come and have a ride?\" she  suggested.    \"All right, I will!\" exclaimed the youth.    \"All right, then I'll come!\" she retorted with a laugh, and a few  minutes later the two were in the Arrow, making a pretty picture as  they speeded up the lake.          CHAPTER VI    BUILDING THE CAR      \"Well,\" remarked Tom to himself, about two hours later, when he had  left Mary Nestor at her dock, and was on his way home, \"I feel better  than I did, and now I must do some hard thinking about my runabout. I  want to get it the right shape to make the least resistance.\" He began  to make some sketches when he got home, and at dinner he showed them to  his father and Mr. Sharp.  He said he had gotten an idea from looking  at the airship.    \"I'm going to make the front part, or what"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/953"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel; Or, The Hidden City of the Andes (#6)"],[1,"  which would only serve to split it more and perhaps wedge it fast in  the tunnel.    So Tom tried different mixtures, using various chemicals, but none  seemed to be just right. The trials were not without danger, either.  Once, in mixing some ingredients, there was an explosion that injured  one man, and blew Tom some distance away. Fortunately for him, there  was an open window in the direction in which he was propelled, and he  went through that, escaping with only some cuts and bruises.    Another time there was a hang-fire, and the explosive burned instead of  detonating, so that one of the shops caught, and there was no little  work in subduing the flames.    But Tom would not give up, and finally, after many trials, he hit on  what he felt to be the right mixture. This he took out to the big lot,  and having made a miniature tunnel with some of the sample rock, and  having put some of the explosive in a hole bored in the big chunk Koku  carried, Tom fired the charge. The result we have seen. It was a  success.    A day after receiving Tom's message Mr. Titus came on and a  demonstration was given of the powerful explosive.    \"Tom, that's great!\" cried the tunnel contractor. \"Our troubles are at  an end now.\"    But, had he known it, new ones were only just beginning.    Tom at once began preparations for making the explosive on a large  scale, as much of it would be needed in the Andes tunnel. Then, having  turned the manufacturing end of it over to his men, Tom began his  preparations for going to Peru.    Mr. Damon was also getting ready, and it was arranged that he, with Tom  and Mr. Titus, should take a vessel from San Francisco, crossing the  continent by train. The supply of explosive would follow them by  special freight.    \"We might have gone by Panama except for the slide in the canal,\" Tom  said. \"And I suppose I could take you across the continent in my  airship, Mr. Titus, if you object to railroad travel.\"    \"No, thank you, Tom. If it's just the same to you, I'd rather stay on  the ground,\" the contractor said. \"I'm more used to it.\"    A day or so before the start for San Francisco was to be made, Tom,  passing a store in Shopton, saw something in the window he thought Mary  Nestor would like. It was a mahogany work-box, of unique design,  beautifully decorated, and Tom purchased it.    \"Shall I have it sent?\" asked the clerk.    \"No, thank you,\" Tom answered.    He knew the young lady who had waited on him, and, for reasons of his  own, he did not want her to know that Mary was to get the box.    Carrying the present to his laboratory, Tom prepared to wrap it up  suitably to send to Mary, with a note. Just, however, as he was looking  for a box suitable to contain the gift, he received a summons to the  telephone. Mr. Titus, in New York, wanted to speak to him.    \"Here, Rad!\" Tom called. \"Just box this up for me, like a good fellow,  and then take it to Miss Nestor at this address; will you?\" and Tom  handed his man the addressed letter he had written to Mary. \"Be careful  of it,\" Tom cautioned.    \"Oh, I'll be careful, Massa Tom,\" was the reply. \"I'll shore be  careful.\"    And Eradicate was--all too careful.          Chapter VI    Mr. Nestor's Letter      \"Got t' git a good strong box fo' dish yeah,\" murmured Eradicate, as he  looked at the beautiful mahogany present Tom had turned over to him to  take to Mary. \"Mah Landy! Dat suttinly am nice; Ah! Um! Jest laik some  ob de old mahogany furniture dat was in our fambily down Souf.\"  Eradicate did not mean his family, exactly, but the one in which he had  been a slave.    \"Yassum, dat shore am nice!\" he went on, talking to himself as he  admired the present. \"I shore got t' put dat in a good box! An' dish  year note, too. Let's see what it done say on de outside.\"    Eradicate held the envelope carefully upside down, and read--or rather  pretended to read--the name and address.  Eradicate knew well enough  where Mary lived, for this was not the first time he had gone there  with messages from his young master.    \"Massa Tom shore am a fine writer,\" mused the negro, as he slowly  turned the envelope around. \"I cain't read nobody's writin' but hisen,  nohow.\"    Had Eradicate been strictly honest with himself, he would have  confessed that he could not read any writing, or printing either. His  education had been very limited, but one could show him, say, a printed  sign and tell him it read \"Danger\" or \"Five miles to Branchville,\" or  anything like that, and the next time he saw it, Eradicate would know  what that sign said. He seemed to fix a picture of it in his mind,  though the letters and figures by themselves meant nothing to him. So  when Tom told him the envelope contained the name and address of Miss  Nestor, Eradicate needed nothing more.    He rummaged about in some odds and ends in the corner of the  laboratory, and brought out a strong, wooden box, which had a cover  that screwed down.    \"Dat'll be de ticket!\" Eradicate exclaimed. \"De mahogany present will  jest fit.\" Eradicate took some excelsior to pad the box, and then,  dropping inside it the gift, already wrapped in tissue paper, he  proceeded to screw on the cover.    There was something printed in red letters on the outside box, but  Eradicate could not read, so it did not trouble him.    \"Dat Miss Nestor shore will laik her present,\" he murmured. \"An' I'll  be mighty keerful ob it' laik Massa Tom tole me. He wouldn't trust dat  big lummox Koku wif anyt'ing laik dis.\"    Screwing on the cover, and putting a piece of wrapping paper outside  the rough, wooden box, with the letter in his hand, Eradicate, full of  his own importance, set off for Miss Nestor's house. Tom had not  returned from the telephone, over which he was talking to Mr. Titus.    The message was an important one. The contractor said he had received  word from his brother in Peru that his presence was urgently needed  there.    \"Could you arrange to get off sooner than we planned, Tom?\" asked Mr.  Titus. \"I am afraid something has happened down there. Have you sent  the first shipment of explosive?\"    \"Yes, that went three days ago. It ought to arrive at Lima soon after  we do. Why yes, I can start to-night if we have to. I'll find out if  Mr. Damon can be with us on such short notice.\"    \"I wish you would,\" came from Mr. Titus. \"And say, Tom, do you think  you could take that giant Koku with you?\"    \"Why?\"    \"Well, I think he'd come in handy. There are some pretty rough  characters in those Andes Mountains, and your big friend might be  useful.\"    \"All right. I was thinking of it, anyhow. Glad you mentioned it. Now  I'll call up Mr. Damon, and I'll let you know, in an hour or so, if he  can make it.\"    \"Bless my hair brush, yes, Tom!\" exclaimed the eccentric man, when told  of the change in plans. \"I can leave to-night as well as not.\"    Word to this effect was sent on to Mr. Titus, and then began some  hurrying on the part of Tom Swift. He told Koku to get ready to leave  for New York at once, where he and the giant would join Mr. Titus and  Mr. Damon, and start across the continent to take for steamer for Lima,  Peru.    \"Rad, did you send that present to Miss Nestor?\" asked Tom, later, as  he finished packing his grip.    \"Yas, sah. I done did it. Took it mase'f!\"    \"That's good! I guess I'll have to say good-bye to Mary over the  telephone. I won't have time to call. I'm glad I thought of the  present.\"    Tom got the Nestor house on the wire. But Mary was not in.    \"There's a package here for her,\" said the girl's mother. \"Did you--?\"    \"Yes, I sent that,\" Tom said. \"Sorry I won't be able to call and say  good-bye, but I'm in a terrible rush. I'll see her as soon as I get  back, and I'll write as soon as I arrive.\"    \"Do,\" urged Mrs. Nestor. \"We'll all be glad to hear from you,\" for Tom  and Mary were tentatively engaged to be married.    Tom and Koku went on with their hurried preparations to leave for New  York. Eradicate begged to be taken along, but Tom gently told the  faithful old servant that it was out of the question.    \"Besides, Rad,\" he said, \"it's dangerous in those Andes Mountains. Why,  they have birds there, as big as cows, and they can swoop down and  carry off a man your size.\"    \"Am dat shorely so, Massa Tom?\"    \"Of course it is! You get the dictionary and read about the condors of  the Andes Mountains.\"    \"Dat's what I'll do, Massa Tom. Birds as big as cows what kin pick up a  man in dere beaks, an' carry him off! Oh, my!  No, sah, Massa Tom! I  don't want t' go. I'll stay right yeah!\"    Shortly before Tom and Koku departed for the railroad station, where  they were to take a train for New York, Mary Nestor returned home.    \"Tom called you on the telephone to say good-bye,\" her mother informed  her, \"and said he was sorry he could not see you. But he sent some sort  of gift.\"    \"Oh, how sweet of him!\" Mary exclaimed. \"Where is it?\"    \"On the dining room table. Eradicate brought it with a note.\"    Mary read the note first.    In it Tom begged Mary to accept the little token, and to think of him  when she used it.    \"Oh! I wonder what it can be,\" she cried in delight.    \"Better open it and see,\" advised Mr. Nestor, who had come in at that  moment.    Mary cut the string of the outside paper, and folded back the wrapper.  A wooden box was exposed to view, a solid, oblong, wooden box, and on  the top, in bold, red letters Mary, her father and her mother read:    DYNAMITE! HANDLE WITH CARE!      \"Oh! Oh!\" murmured Mrs. Nestor.    \"Dynamite! Handle with care!\" repeated Mr. Nestor, in a sort of dazed  voice. \"Quick! Get a pail of water! Dump it in the bathtub!  Soak it  good, and then telephone for the police. Dynamite! What does this mean?\"    He rushed toward the kitchen, evidently with the intention of getting a  pail of water, but Mary clasped him by the arm.    \"Father!\" she exclaimed. \"Don't get so excited!\"    \"Excited!\" he cried. \"Who's excited?"]]]
