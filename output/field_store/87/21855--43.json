And after her straightway Hypsipyle rose up  again, and thus spake in reply.    (ll. 700-701) \"If this purpose please you all, now will I even send a  messenger to the ship.\"    (ll. 702-707) She spake and addressed Iphinoe close at hand: \"Go,  Iphinoe, and beg yonder man, whoever it is that leads this array, to  come to our land that I may tell him a word that pleases the heart of my  people, and bid the men themselves, if they wish, boldly enter the land  and the city with friendly intent.\"    (ll. 708-711) She spake, and dismissed the assembly, and thereafter  started to return home. And so Iphinoe came to the Minyae; and they  asked with what intent she had come among them. And quickly she  addressed her questioners with all speed in these words:    (ll. 712-716) \"The maiden Hypsipyle daughter of Thoas, sent me on my way  here to you, to summon the captain of your ship, whoever he be, that she  may tell him a word that pleases the heart of the people, and she bids  yourselves, if ye wish it, straightway enter the land and the city with  friendly intent.\"    (ll. 717-720) Thus she spake and the speech of good omen pleased all.  And they deemed that Thoas was dead and that his beloved daughter  Hypsipyle was queen, and quickly they sent Jason on his way and  themselves made ready to go.    (ll. 721-729) Now he had buckled round his shoulders a purple mantle of  double fold, the work of the Tritonian goddess, which Pallas had given  him when she first laid the keel-props of the ship Argo and taught him  how to measure timbers with the rule. More easily wouldst thou cast thy  eyes upon the sun at its rising than behold that blazing splendour. For  indeed in the middle the fashion thereof was red, but at the ends it was  all purple, and on each margin many separate devices had been skilfully  inwoven.    (ll. 730-734) In it were the Cyclops seated at their imperishable work,  forging a thunderbolt for King Zeus; by now it was almost finished in  its brightness and still it wanted but one ray, which they were beating  out with their iron hammers as it spurted forth a breath of raging  flame.    (ll. 735-741) In it too were the twin sons of Antiope, daughter of  Asopus, Amphion and Zethus, and Thebe still ungirt with towers was  lying near, whose foundations they were just then laying in eager haste.  Zethus on his shoulders was lifting the peak of a steep mountain, like  a man toiling hard, and Amphion after him, singing loud and clear on his  golden lyre, moved on, and a rock twice as large followed his footsteps.    (ll. 742-746) Next in order had been wrought Cytherea with drooping  tresses, wielding the swift shield of Ares; and from her shoulder to her  left arm the fastening of her tunic was loosed beneath her breast; and  opposite in the shield of bronze her image appeared clear to view as she  stood.    (ll. 747-751) And in it there was a well-wooded pasturage of oxen; and  about the oxen the Teleboae and the sons of Eleetryon were fighting; the  one party defending themselves, the others, the Taphian raiders, longing  to rob them; and the dewy meadow was drenched with their blood, and the  many were overmastering the few herdsmen.    (ll. 752-758) And therein were fashioned two chariots, racing, and the  one in front Pelops was guiding, as he shook the reins, and with him was  Hippodameia at his side, and in pursuit Myrtilus urged his steeds, and  with him Oenomaus had grasped his couched spear, but fell as the axle  swerved and broke in the nave, while he was eager to pierce the back of  Pelops.    (ll. 759-762) And in it was wrought Phoebus Apollo, a stripling not  yet grown up, in the act of shooting at mighty Tityos who was boldly  dragging his mother by her veil, Tityos whom glorious Elate bare, but  Earth nursed him and gave him second birth.    (ll. 763-767) And in it was Phrixus the Minyan as though he were in very  deed listening to the ram, while it was like one speaking. Beholding  them thou wouldst be silent and wouldst cheat thy soul with the hope of  hearing some wise speech from them, and long wouldst thou gaze with that  hope.    (ll. 768-773) Such then were the gifts of the Tritonian goddess Athena.  And in his right hand Jason held a fardarting spear, which Atalanta gave  him once as a gift of hospitality in Maenalus as she met him gladly; for  she eagerly desired to follow on that quest; but he himself of his own  accord prevented the maid, for he feared bitter strife on account of her  love.    (ll. 774-792) And he went on his way to the city like to a bright star,  which maidens, pent up in new-built chambers, behold as it rises above  their homes, and through the dark air it charms their eyes with its fair  red gleam and the maid rejoices, love-sick for the youth who is far away  amid strangers, for whom her parents are keeping her to be his bride;  like to that star the hero trod the way to the city. And when they had  passed within the gates and the city, the women of the people surged  behind them, delighting in the stranger, but he with his eyes fixed on  the ground fared straight on, till he reached the glorious palace of  Hypsipyle; and when he appeared the maids opened the folding doors,  fitted with well-fashioned panels. Here Iphinoe leading him quickly  through a fair porch set him upon a shining seat opposite her mistress,  but Hypsipyle turned her eyes aside and a blush covered her maiden  cheeks, yet for all her modesty she addressed him with crafty words:    (ll. 793-833) \"Stranger, why stay ye so long outside our towers? for the  city is not inhabited by the men, but they, as sojourners, plough the  wheat-bearing fields of the Thracian mainland. And I will tell out truly  all our evil plight, that ye yourselves too may know it well. When my  father Thoas reigned over the citizens, then our folk starting from  their homes used to plunder from their ships the dwellings of the  Thracians who live opposite, and they brought back hither measureless  booty and maidens too. But the counsel of the baneful goddess Cypris was  working out its accomplishment, who brought upon them soul destroying  infatuation. For they hated their lawful wives, and, yielding to their  own mad folly, drove them from their homes; and they took to their beds  the captives of their spear, cruel ones. Long in truth we endured it, if  haply again, though late, they might change their purpose, but ever the  bitter woe grew, twofold. And the lawful children were being dishonoured  in their halls, and a bastard race was rising. And thus unmarried  maidens and widowed mothers too wandered uncared for through the city;  no father heeded his daughter ever so little even though he should see  her done to death before his eyes at the hands of an insolent step-dame,  nor did sons, as before, defend their mother against unseemly outrage;  nor did brothers care at heart for their sister. But in their homes, in  the dance, in the assembly and the banquet all their thought was only  for their captive maidens; until some god put desperate courage in our  hearts no more to receive our lords on their return from Thrace within  our towers so that they might either heed the right or might depart and  begone elsewhither, they and their captives. So they begged of us all  the male children that were left in the city and went back to where even  now they dwell on the snowy tilths of Thrace. Do ye therefore stay and  settle with us; and shouldst thou desire to dwell here, and this finds  favour with thee, assuredly thou shalt have the prerogative of my father  Thoas; and I deem that thou wilt not scorn our land at all; for it is  deepsoiled beyond all other islands that lie in the Aegaean sea. But  come now, return to the ship and relate my words to thy comrades, and  stay not outside our city.\"    (ll. 834-835) She spoke, glozing over the murder that had been wrought  upon the men; and Jason addressed her in answer:    (ll. 836-841) \"Hypsipyle, very dear to our hearts is the help we shall  meet with, which thou grantest to us who need thee. And I will return  again to the city when I have told everything in order due. But let the  sovereignty of the island be thine; it is not in scorn I yield it up,  but grievous trials urge me on.\"    (ll. 842-852) He spake, and touched her right hand; and quickly he  turned to go back: and round him the young maids on every side danced  in countless numbers in their joy till he passed through the gates. And  then they came to the shore in smooth-running wains, bearing with them  many gifts, when now he had related from beginning to end the speech  which Hypsipyle had spoken when she summoned them; and the maids readily  led the men back to their homes for entertainment. For Cypris stirred  in them a sweet desire, for the sake of Hephaestus of many counsels, in  order that Lemnos might be again inhabited by men and not be ruined.    (ll. 853-864) Thereupon Aeson's son started to go to the royal home of  Hypsipyle; and the rest went each his way as chance took them, all but  Heracles; for he of his own will was left behind by the ship and a few  chosen comrades with him. And straightway the city rejoiced with dances  and banquets, being filled with the steam of sacrifice; and above all  the immortals they propitiated with songs and sacrifices the illustrious  son of Hera and Cypris herself. And the sailing was ever delayed from  one day to another; and long would they have lingered there, had not  Heracles, gathering together his comrades apart from the women, thus  addressed them with reproachful words:    (ll. 865-874) \"Wretched men, does the murder of kindred keep us from our  native land? Or is it in want of marriage that we have come hither from  thence, in scorn of our countrywomen? Does it please us to dwell here  and plough the rich soil of Lemnos? No fair renown shall we win by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/831"],[0,"Four Arthurian Romances (#6)"],[1,"stir to-morrow; for in the presence of all the  people there will be set upon a silver perch a sparrow-hawk of five or  six moultings--the best you can imagine. Whoever wishes to gain the hawk  must have a mistress who is fair, prudent, and courteous. And if there  be a knight so bold as to wish to defend the worth and the name of the  fairest in his eyes, he will cause his mistress to step forward and  lift the hawk from the perch, if no one dares to interpose. This is the  custom they are observing, and for this each year they gather here.\"  Thereupon Erec speaks and asks him: \"Fair host, may it not displease  you, but tell me, if you know, who is a certain knight bearing arms of  azure and gold, who passed by here not long ago, having close beside him  a courtly damsel, preceded by a hump-backed dwarf.\" To him the host then  made reply: \"That is he who will win the hawk without any opposition  from the other knights. I don't believe that any one will offer  opposition; this time there will be no blows or wounds. For two years  already he has won it without being challenged; and if he wins it  again this year, he will have gained permanent possession of it. Every  succeeding year he may keep it without contest or challenge.\" Quickly  Erec makes reply: \"I do not like that knight. Upon my word, had I some  arms I should challenge him for the hawk. Fair host, I beg you as a boon  to advise me how I may be equipped with arms whether old or new, poor or  rich, it matters not.\" And he replies to him generously: \"It were a pity  for you to feel concern on that score! I have good fine arms which I  shall be glad to lend you. In the house I have a triple-woven hauberk,  [110] which was selected from among five hundred. And I have some fine  valuable greaves, polished, handsome, and light in weight. The helmet  is bright and handsome, and the shield fresh and new. Horse, sword, and  lance all I will lend you, of course; so let no more be said.\" \"Thank  you kindly, fair gentle host! But I wish for no better sword that this  one which I have brought with me, nor for any other horse than my own,  for I can get along well enough with him. If you will lend me the rest,  I shall esteem it a great favour. But there is one more boon I wish to  ask of you, for which I shall make just return if God grant that I come  off from the battle with honour.\" And frankly he replies to him: \"Ask  confidently for what you want, whatever it be, for nothing of mine shall  lack you.\" Then Erec said that he wished to defend the hawk on behalf  of his daughter; for surely there will be no damsel who is one hundredth  part as beautiful as she. And if he takes her with him, he will have  good and just reason to maintain and to prove that she is entitled to  carry away the hawk. Then he added: \"Sire, you know not what guest you  have sheltered here, nor do you know my estate and kin. I am the son of  a rich and puissant king: my father's name is King Lac, and the Bretons  call me Erec. I belong to King Arthur's court, and have been with him  now three years. I know not if any report of my father or of me has ever  reached this land. But I promise you and vow that if you will fit me out  with arms, and will give me your daughter to-morrow when I strive for  the hawk, I will take her to my country, if God grant me the victory,  and I will give her a crown to wear, and she shall be queen of three  cities.\" \"Ah, fair sir! Is it true that you are Erec, the son of Lac?\"  \"That is who I am, indeed\" quoth he. Then the host was greatly delighted  and said: \"We have indeed heard of you in this country. Now I think all  the more of you, for you are very valiant and brave. Nothing now shall  you be refused by me. At your request I give you my fair daughter.\"  Then taking her by the hand, he says: \"Here, I give her to you.\" Erec  received her joyfully, and now has all he desired. Now they are all  happy there: the father is greatly delighted, and the mother weeps for  joy. The maiden sat quiet; but she was very happy and glad that she was  betrothed to him, because he was valiant and courteous: and she knew  that he would some day be king, and she should receive honour and be  crowned rich queen.    (Vv. 691-746.) They had sat up very late that night. But now the  beds were prepared with white sheets and soft pillows, and when the  conversation flagged they all went to bed in happy frame. Erec slept  little that night, and the next morn, at crack of dawn, he and his host  rose early. They both go to pray at church, and hear a hermit chant the  Mass of the Holy Spirit, not forgetting to make an offering. When they  had heard Mass both kneel before the altar and then return to the house.  Erec was eager for the battle; so he asks for arms, and they are given  to him. The maiden herself puts on his arms (though she casts no spell  or charm), [111] laces on his iron greaves, and makes them fast with  thong of deer-hide. She puts on his hauberk with its strong meshes, and  laces on his ventail. The gleaming helmet she sets upon his head, and  thus arms him well from tip to toe. At his side she fastens his sword,  and then orders his horse to be brought, which is done. Up he jumped  clear of the ground. The damsel then brings the shield and the strong  lance: she hands him the shield, and he takes it and hangs it about his  neck by the strap. She places the lance in his hand, and when he had  grasped it by the butt-end, he thus addressed the gentle vavasor: \"Fair  sire,\" quoth he, \"if you please, make your daughter ready now; for  I wish to escort her to the sparrow-hawk in accordance with our  agreement.\" The vavasor then without delay had saddled a bay palfrey.  There can nothing be said of the harness because of the dire poverty  with which the vavasor was afflicted. Saddle and bridle were put on, and  up the maiden mounted all free and in light attire, without waiting  to be urged. Erec wished to delay no longer; so off he starts with the  host's daughter by his side, followed by the gentleman and his lady.    (Vv. 747-862.) Erec rides with lance erect and with the comely damsel by  his side. All the people, great and small, gaze at them with wondering  eyes as they pass through the streets. And thus they question each  other: \"Who is yonder knight? He must be doughty and brave, indeed, to  act as escort for this fair maid. His efforts will be well employed in  proving that this damsel is the fairest of them all.\" One man to another  says: \"In very truth, she ought to have the sparrow-hawk.\" Some praised  the maid, while many said: \"God! who can this knight be, with the fair  damsel by his side?\" \"I know not.\" \"Nor I.\" Thus spake each one. \"But  his gleaming helmet becomes him well, and the hauberk, and shield, and  his sharp steel sword. He sits well upon his steed and has the bearing  of a valiant vassal, well-shapen in arm, in limb and foot.\" While all  thus stand and gaze at them, they for their part made no delay to take  their stand by the sparrow-hawk, where to one side they awaited the  knight. And now behold! they see him come, attended by his dwarf and his  damsel. He had heard the report, that a knight had come who wished to  obtain the sparrow-hawk, but he did not believe there could be in the  world a knight so bold as to dare to fight with him. He would quickly  defeat him and lay him low. All the people knew him well, and all  welcome him and escort him in a noisy crowd: knights, squires, ladies,  and damsels make haste to run after him. Leading them all the knight  rides proudly on, with his damsel and his dwarf at his side, and he  makes his way quickly to the sparrow-hawk. But all about there was such  a press of the rough and vulgar crowd that it was impossible to touch  the hawk or to come near where it was. Then the Count arrived on the  scene, and threatened the populace with a switch which he held in his  hand. The crowd drew back, and the knight advanced and said quietly  to his lady: \"My lady, this bird, which is so perfectly moulted and so  fair, should be yours as your just portion; for you are wondrous fair  and full of charm. Yours it shall surely be so long as I live. Step  forward, my dear, and lift the hawk from the perch.\" The damsel was on  the point of stretching forth her hand when Erec hastened to challenge  her, little heeding the other's arrogance. \"Damsel,\" he cries, \"stand  back! Go dally with some other bird, for to this one you have no right.  In spite of all, I say this hawk shall never be yours. For a better one  than you claims it--aye, much more fair and more courteous.\" The other  knight is very wroth; but Erec does not mind him, and bids his own  maiden step forward. \"Fair one.\" he cries, \"come forth. Lift the bird  from the perch, for it is right that you should have it. Damsel, come  forth! For I will make boast to defend it if any one is so bold as  to intervene. For no woman excels you in beauty or worth, in grace or  honour any more than the moon outshines the sun.\" The other could suffer  it no longer, when he hears him so manfully offer himself to do battle.  \"Vassal,\" he cries, \"who art thou who dost thus dispute with me the  hawk?\" Erec boldly answers him: \"A knight I am from another land. This  hawk I have come to obtain; for it is right, I say it in spite of all,  that this damsel of mine should have it.\" \"Away!\" cries the other, \"it  shall never be. Madness has brought thee here. If thou dost wish to have  the hawk, thou shalt pay fight dearly for it.\" \"Pay, vassal; and how?\"  \"Thou must fight with me, if thou dost not resign it to me.\" \"You talk  madness,\" cries Erec; \"for me these are idle threats; for little  enough do I fear you.\" \"Then I defy thee here and now. The battle is  inevitable.\" Erec replies: \"God help me now; for never did I wish for  aught so much.\" Now soon you will hear the noise of battle.    (Vv. 863-1080.) The large place was cleared, with the people gathered  all around."]]]
