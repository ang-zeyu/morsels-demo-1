All the unsightly buildings, heretofore  obstructing the view, have been removed, and a terrace was erected for a  distance of half a mile, affording uncountable attractions to the visitor  with its venerable trees, comfortable seats, and delightful views.    The main entrance is a tasty structure at the foot of Cascade Street. The  point of land at the brink of the falls is called _Prospect Point_. Since  it commands a fine view, which is the feature of the park, our drivers  advised us to abandon the carriages and to step nearer to the long stone  wall running for some distance along the edge of the gorge.    Standing on the platform, I glanced at the mighty volume of water; here  precipitated over a huge rock 163 feet high with a thunderlike roar that  can be heard, under favorable circumstances, a distance of fifteen miles.    For a long time we remained there, spell-bound by the wonderful panorama,  plunged into a reverie of rapture. Mrs. James, reminding me the carriages  were waiting for us, brought me back to consciousness.    The spectacle is so sublime and overwhelming that the mind, unable to  grasp it, cannot adjust itself at once to a scale so stupendous, and the  impression fails. But, gradually, as you remain longer, the unvarying,  ponderous, unspeakably solemn voice of the great flood finds its way to  the soul, and holds it with a fascination which is all pervasive and  cannot be shaken off.    In a car, moving on an inclined plane, we descended to the water's edge.  These cars are raised and lowered by water-power, by means of a three-inch  cable 300 feet long, running over steel wheels.    At the foot of the stairway, tickets may be obtained for the trip on the  \"Maid of the Mist,\" that steams up to the Horseshoe Fall; then back to the  Canadian side, and finally returns to her starting point.    The view from below presented to us new charms which we could not obtain  before. In the first place the enormous height of the cataract may be  better realized from beneath; then the emerald and opal translucence of  the waters, as they pass in their swift career, was here especially  effective; since the sun, shining through the mists of spray from a  station in the heavens most advantageous for our prospect, crowned the  entire scene with iridescent diadems. This fall is known as the American,  separated from the \"Horseshoe\" or \"Canadian Fall\" by a large island,  standing on the verge of the cliff over which the cataract pours, and  dividing the river in such a manner as to form from its waters the two  above named falls.    After a lovely ride through the beautiful woodland we viewed Goat Island,  having an area of 61-1/2 acres and a circumference of about one mile. A  strip about ten rods wide and eighty rods long, has been washed away on  the south side since the first road was made in 1818.    This island was, in ancient times, one of the favorite burying-grounds of  the Indians, and yet preserves traces of their funeral rites.    Crossing the first bridge, from which we had one of the grandest views of  the rapids, we reached Bath Island, some two acres in extent. A second  bridge conveyed us to Goat Island, where we witnessed a most charming  panorama. Descending the stairs, we stood next to the Little Fall, beneath  which is the famous Cave of the Winds.    From the farther point of Luna Island, attainable by a little bridge, we  saw the most desirable near view of the American Fall and Rapids; here,  too, we enjoyed a fine spectacle in the perspective of the gorge below.    It has often been remarked by strangers that this island trembles, which  is undoubtedly true, but the impression is heightened by imagination.    Not far from Luna Island are the famous Biddle Stairs. Shortly after their  erection, in 1829, the well known Sam Patch, whose diving propensities  made his name illustrious, performed his noted, bold feat in 1830. Midway  between the foot of these stairs and the Canadian Fall he built a  scaffold, ninety-six feet high, from which he made his successful leap  into the river.    Proceeding a little further, we stood in full view of the Horseshoe  Fall--so-called because of its crescent shape--which contains by far the  greater body of water; the fall being more than 2,000 feet wide and 154  feet high.    The site of the old Terrapin Tower is the best point from which to  perceive the shape of the fall.    From the south side of the island the Three Sister Islands are accessible,  affording the finest views of the rapids. These islands offer, from their  location, a delightfully cool retreat in the warmest summer days, with  attractive and enchanting scenery.    In order to have a comprehensive glance of Nature's grandest wonder known  to man, in its climax of sublimity, we took a ride back through Prospect  Park, across the New Suspension Bridge, below the American Fall, to the  Canadian shore. This splendid drive was continued through the Queen  Victoria Niagara Falls Park, opened to the public in 1889.    Following the example of New York State, the Ontario Parliament had passed  an act to reserve the western side of the Falls vicinity--the Canadian  Reservation--covering an area of about 154 acres, and beautifully laid  out.    Here we had the most imposing view; a finer panorama cannot well be  imagined.    The concussion of the descending waters with those in the depths below  occasion a spray that veils the cataract two-thirds up its height. Above  this everlasting and impenetrable foam, there rises fifty feet above the  fall a cloud of lighter spray, which, when the rays of the sun are  directed upon it, displays solar rainbows, grand in their magnificence.    It was here on Table Rock, formerly one of the most celebrated points  about Niagara, that Mrs. Lydia Huntley Sigourney wrote her spirited eulogy  on Niagara, which commences with the musical rhymes:       \"Flow on forever, in thy glorious robe      Of terror and of beauty. Yea, flow on,      Unfathomed and resistless. God hath set      His rainbow on thy forehead, and the cloud      Mantled around thy feet. And he doth give      Thy voice of thunder power to speak of him      Eternally,--bidding the lip of man      Keep silence,--and upon thine altar pour      Incense of awe-struck praise.\"    Three miles below the falls is the Whirlpool, a vast basin formed by the  projection of a rocky promontory on the Canadian side, against which the  waters rush with such violence as to cause a severe reaction and rotary  motion; and in it logs and trees are frequently whirled around for weeks  in succession.    Geology has accepted as a matter of certitude that within the memory of  men now living, the Falls have receded 100 feet, and authorities in that  science have stated the fact, that the retrocession--estimated from one  inch to one foot per year--began near Lewiston. The whole waters of the  lakes there foamed over this dam several miles in width.    The name \"Niagara\" is supposed to belong to the vocabulary of the Iroquois  language, meaning \"Thunderer of Waters.\"    The first white visitor to Niagara Falls was Father Hennepin, a priest and  historian, accompanying Chevalier Robert de la Salle on his discoveries.  He published the first description of \"this wonderful Downfall\" in 1678.    There exist now three distinct cataracts, which are known as _Horseshoe_,  _American_, and _Central Falls_. The weight of water descending over the  cadences in a single hour, is computed to be 100,000,000 tons.    The magnitude of the great waterfalls, and their fame as a natural wonder,  had, heretofore, to a certain degree, excluded from thought the idea of  their marvelous utilarian properties; but the recent development of  electrical science, and the far-reaching enterprise of to-day, have now  combined to subject to the uses of mankind a portion of the power of the  falls, developed at such a distance from the great cataract as not to  interfere in any way with the natural beauty of the scenery.    As the western sky was dyed with the tints of sunset, we hastened to reach  our floating home; since we expected two friends of Miss Campbell on board  the yacht--a gentleman who holds a prominent position in Buffalo, Mr. J.B.  Seitz, and his charming wife. We returned with the exhalting sentiment of  having visited a temple of nature, to whose shrine thousands from all over  the world annually pay their tribute of praise.    Arriving on board the \"Marguerite\" that--though still in dry-dock--was not  laid dry any more, we perceived a striking contrast between the close and  saturated atmosphere prevailing here, and the pure, balmy air at Niagara  Falls.    Our thoughtful commodore, desirous of giving us the opportunity to inhale  the refreshing sea-breeze, ordered our departure for the breakwater as  soon as circumstances permitted; intending early on the following morning  to commence our lake journey. The obscurity was fast increasing as we  neared the high stone wall, and the scenery around me made the verses of  Whittier resound in my ears in which he described the \"Evening by the Lake  Side\" so beautifully with the words:       \"Yon mountain's side is black with night,        While broad-orbed, o'er its gleaming crown      The moon, slow rounding into sight,        On the hushed inland-sea looks down.\"        CHAPTER III.    VOYAGE ON THREE GREAT LAKES, FROM AUGUST 2ND, 7 A.M., TO AUGUST 22ND, 9  A.M.      As the warm rays of the morning sun were lighting up the scene with a  radiance, glorious to behold, we bade farewell to Buffalo which, being  already in some distance, soon became entirely invisible.    Indescribable was our amazement when we viewed once more the waters of  _Lake Erie_, whose raging billows had betrayed to us, only a few days ago,  the unruly nature of a boisterous inland-sea.    Now, as we were "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9411"],[0,"Legends of the Gods (#6)"],[1,".    PLATE VIII.  Horus of Behutet and Harmakhis in a shrine.    PLATE IX.    Ashthertet ('Ashtoreth') driving her chariot over the prostrate foe.    PLATE X.  Left: Horus of Behutet spearing a Typhonic animal, and holding his  prisoners with rope.    Right: Horus of Behutet, accompanied by Ra-Harmakhis and Menu, spearing  the Hippopotamus-fiend.        Then Set rose up and cursed Horus because he had slain his allies, and  he used such foul language that Thoth called him \"Nehaha-her,\" i.e.,  \"Stinking Face,\" and this name clung to him ever after.  After this  Horus and Set engaged in a fight which lasted a very long time, but at  length Horus drove his spear into the neck of Set with such violence  that the Fiend fell headlong to the ground.  Then Horus smote with his  club the mouth which had uttered such blasphemies, and fettered him  with his chain.  In this state Horus dragged Set into the presence of  Ra, who ascribed great praise to Horus, and special names were given to  the palace of Horus and the high priest of the temple in commemoration  of the event.  When the question of the disposal of Set was being  discussed by the gods, Ra ordered that he and his fiends should be  given over to Isis and her son Horus, who were to do what they pleased  with them.  Horus promptly cut off the heads of Set and his fiends in  the presence of Ra and Isis, and be dragged Set by his feet through the  country with his spear sticking in his head and neck.  After this Isis  appointed Horus of Behutet to be the protecting deity of her son Horus.    The fight between the Sun-god and Set was a very favourite subject with  Egyptian writers, and there are many forms of it.  Thus there is the  fight between Heru-ur and Set, the fight between Ra and Set, the fight  between Heru-Behutet and Set, the fight between Osiris and Set, and the  fight between Horus, son of Isis, and Set.  In the oldest times the  combat was merely the natural opposition of light to darkness, but  later the Sun-god became the symbol of right and truth as well as of  light, and Set the symbol of sin and wickedness as well as of darkness,  and ultimately the nature myth was forgotten, and the fight between the  two gods became the type of the everlasting war which good men wage  against sin.  In Coptic literature we have the well-known legend of the  slaughter of the dragon by St. George, and this is nothing but a  Christian adaptation of the legend of Horus and Set.    After these things Horus, son of Ra, and Horus, son of Isis, each took  the form of a mighty man, with the face and body of a hawk, and each  wore the Red and White Crowns, and each carried a spear and chain.  In  these forms the two gods slew the remnant of the enemies.  Now by some  means or other Set came to life again, and he took the form of a mighty  hissing or \"roaring\" serpent, and hid himself in the ground, in a place  which was ever after called the \"place of the roarer.\"  In front of his  hiding-place Horus, son of Isis, stationed himself in the form of a  hawk-headed staff to prevent him from coming out.  In spite of this,  however, Set managed to escape, and he gathered about him the Smai and  Seba fiends at the Lake of Meh, and waged war once more against Horus;  the enemies of Ra were again defeated, and Horus slew them in the  presence of his father.        PLATE XI.  Horus of Behutet and Thoth spearing human victims with the assistance  of Isis.    PLATE XII.  Horus of Behutet and Thoth spearing Set in the form of a crocodile.        Horus, it seems, now ceased to fight for some time, and devoted himself  to keeping guard over the \"Great God\" who was in An-rut-f, a district  in or near Herakleopolis.  This Great God was no other than Osiris, and  the duty of Horus was to prevent the Smai fiends from coming by night  to the place.  In spite of the power of Horus, it was found necessary  to summon the aid of Isis to keep away the fiends, and it was only by  her words of power that the fiend Ba was kept out of the sanctuary.  As  a reward for what he had already done, Thoth decreed that Horus should  be called the \"Master-Fighter.\" Passing over the derivations of place-  names which occur here in the text, we find that Horus and his  Blacksmiths were again obliged to fight bodies of the enemy who had  managed to escape, and that on one occasion they killed one hundred and  six foes.  In every fight the Blacksmiths performed mighty deeds of  valour, and in reward for their services a special district was  allotted to them to dwell in.    The last great fight in the North took place at Tanis, in the eastern  part of the Delta.  When the position of the enemy had been located,  Horus took the form of a lion with the face of a man, and he put on his  head the Triple Crown.  His claws were like flints, and with them he  dragged away one hundred and forty-two of the enemy, and tore them in  pieces, and dug out their tongues, which he carried off as symbols of  his victory.        Meanwhile rebellion had again broken out in Nubia, where about one-  third of the enemy had taken refuge in the river in the forms of  crocodiles and hippopotami.  Ra counselled Horus to sail up the Nile  with his Blacksmiths, and when Thoth had recited the \"Chapters of  protecting the Boat of Ra\" over the boats, the expedition set sail for  the South.  The object of reciting these spells was to prevent the  monsters which were in the river from making the waves to rise and from  stirring up storms which might engulf the boats of Ra and Horus and the  Blacksmiths.  When the rebels and fiends who had been uttering, treason  against Horus saw the boat of Ra, with the winged Disk of Horus  accompanied by the goddesses Uatchet and Nekhebet in the form of  serpents, they were smitten with fear, and their hearts quaked, and all  power of resistance left them, and they died of fright straightway.  When Horus returned in triumph to Edfu, Ra ordered that an image of the  winged Disk should be placed in each of his sanctuaries, and that in  every place wherein a winged Disk was set, that sanctuary should be a  sanctuary of Horus of Behutet.  The winged disks which are seen above  the doorways of the temples still standing in Egypt show that the  command of Ra, was faithfully carried out by the priests.        PLATE XIII.  Horus of Behutet in the form of a lion slaying his foes.          V.          LEGEND OF THE BIRTH OF HORUS, SON OF ISIS AND OSIRIS.        PLATE XIV.  The Procreation of Horus, son of Isis.        The text which contains this legend is found cut in hieroglyphics upon  a stele which is now preserved in Paris.  Attention was first called to  it by Chabas, who in 1857 gave a translation of it in the Revue  Archeologique, p. 65 ff., and pointed out the importance of its  contents with his characteristic ability.  The hieroglyphic text was  first published by Ledrain in his work on the monuments of the  Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris,[FN#24] and I gave a transcript of the  text, with transliteration and translation, in 1895.[FN#25]        [FN#24]  Les Monuments Egyptiens (Cabinet des Medailles et Antiques),  In the Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes, Paris, 1879-1882,  plate xxii. ff.      [FN#25]  First Steps in Egyptian, pp. 179-188.        The greater part of the text consists of a hymn to Osiris, which was  probably composed under the XVIIIth Dynasty, when an extraordinary  development of the cult of that god took place, and when he was placed  by Egyptian theologians at the head of all the gods.  Though unseen in  the temples, his presence filled all Egypt, and his body formed the  very substance of the country.  He was the God of all gods and the  Governor of the Two Companies of the gods, he formed the soul and body  of Ra, he was the beneficent Spirit of all spirits, he was himself the  celestial food on which the Doubles in the Other World lived. He was  the greatest of the gods in On (Heliopolis), Memphis, Herakleopolis,  Hermopolis, Abydos, and the region of the First Cataract, and so.  He  embodied in his own person the might of Ra-Tem, Apis and Ptah, the  Horus-gods, Thoth and Khnemu, and his rule over Busiris and Abydos  continued to be supreme, as it had been for many, many hundreds of  years.  He was the source of the Nile, the north wind sprang from him,  his seats were the stars of heaven which never set, and the  imperishable stars were his ministers.  All heaven was his dominion,  and the doors of the sky opened before him of their own accord when he  appeared.  He inherited the earth from his father Keb, and the  sovereignty of heaven from his mother Nut.  In his person he united  endless time in the past and endless time in the future.  Like Ra he  had fought Seba, or Set, the monster of evil, and had defeated him, and  his victory assured to him lasting authority over the gods and the  dead.  He exercised his creative power in making land and water, trees  and herbs, cattle and other four-footed beasts, birds of all kinds, and  fish and creeping things; even the waste spaces of the desert owed  allegiance to him as the creator.  And he rolled out the sky, and set  the light above the darkness.    The last paragraph of the text contains an allusion to Isis, the sister  and wife of Osiris, and mentions the legend of the birth of Horus,  which even under the XVIIIth Dynasty was very ancient, Isis, we are  told, was the constant protectress of her brother, she drove away the  fiends that wanted to attack him, and kept them out of his shrine and  tomb, and she guarded him from all accidents.  All these things she did  by means of spells and incantations, large numbers of which were known  to her, and by her power as the \"witch-goddess.\"  Her \"mouth was  trained to perfection, and she made no mistake in pronouncing her  spells, and her tongue was skilled and halted not.\"  At length came the  unlucky day when Set succeeded in killing Osiris during the war which  the \"good god\""]]]
