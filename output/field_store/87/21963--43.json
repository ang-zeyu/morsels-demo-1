[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11204"],[0,"Diseases of the Horse's Foot (#7)"],[1,"artery, a further point of interest presents itself  to the surgeon, and one to which attention must be paid. This is the  presence in close proximity to the nerve of the Ligament of the Pad  (Percival), or the Ligament of the Ergot (McFadyean). This is a  subcutaneous glistening cord originating in the ergot of the fetlock,  passing in an oblique direction downwards and forwards, and crossing over  on its way both the digital artery and the posterior branch of the digital  nerve.    In the foregoing description of the anatomy, we have taken the fore-limb as  our guide. In the hind-limb, where they reach the foot, the counterparts of  the tendons, arteries, veins, and nerves differ in no great essential from  their fellows in the fore. They will therefore need no special mention.      G. THE COMPLEMENTARY APPARATUS OF THE OS PEDIS.    This consists of two lateral pieces, the LATERAL CARTILAGES or  _Fibro-cartilages_ of the pedal bone, united behind and below by the  _Plantar Cushion_.    1. THE LATERAL CARTILAGES.--Each is a flattened plate of cartilage,  possessing two faces and four borders separated by four angles.    The external face is convex, covered by a plexus of veins, and slightly  overhangs the pedal bone. The internal face is concave, and covers in  front the pedal articulation and the synovial sac, already mentioned as  protruding between the antero- and postero-lateral ligaments of that joint.  We have already remarked that this is a point of interest to be remembered  in connection with the operation for quittor. Below and behind, the  internal face of the cartilage is united to the plantar cushion.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--EXTERNAL FACE OF THE OUTER LATERAL CARTILAGE. 1,  External face of cartilage--(_a_) its upper border, (_b_) its posterior  border, (_c_) its anterior border, (_d_) its inferior border; 2, the os  pedis; 3, wing of os pedis.]    The upper border, sometimes convex, sometimes straight, is thin and  bevelled, and may easily be felt in the living animal. It is this border  that the digital vessels cross to gain the foot, and the border is often  broken by a deep notch to accommodate them. The inferior border is attached  in front to the basilar and retrossal processes, behind which it blends  with the plantar cushion. The posterior border is oblique from before to  behind, and above to below, and joins the preceding two. The anterior  border is oblique in the same direction, and is intimately attached to the  antero-lateral ligament of the pedal articulation. The cartilages of the  fore-feet are thicker and more extensive than those of the hind.    2. THE PLANTAR CUSHION on FIBRO-FATTY FROG.--Composed of a fibrous  meshwork, in the interstices of which are lodged fine elastic and  connective fibres and fat cells, this wedge-shaped body occupies the space  between the two lateral cartilages, the extremity of the perforans tendon,  and the horny frog. It offers for consideration an antero-superior and an  infero-posterior face, a base, an apex, and two borders.    The antero-superior face is in contact with the terminal expansion of the  perforans tendon. The infero-posterior face is covered by the keratogenous  membrane, and follows closely the shape of the horny frog, on whose inner  surface it is moulded. It presents, therefore, at its centre a single  conical prolongation, the _Pyramidal Body_, which is continued behind, as  is the horny frog, in the shape of two lateral ridges divided by a median  cleft. The _base_ of the cushion lies behind, and consists of two lateral  masses, _the Bulbs of the Plantar Cushion_. In front these are continuous  with the ridges of the pyramidal body, while behind they become confounded  with the lateral cartilages and the coronary cushion. The _apex_ is fixed  into the plantar surface of the os pedis, in front of its semilunar ridge.  The _borders_, right and left, are wider behind than before, and are in  relation with the inner faces of the lateral cartilages.      H. THE KERATOGENOUS MEMBRANE.    THE KERATOGENOUS, OR HORN-PRODUCING MEMBRANE, is in reality an extension  of the dermis of the digit. It covers the extremity of the digit as a sock  covers the foot, spreading over the insertion of the extensor pedis, the  lower half of the external face of the lateral cartilages, the bulbs of the  plantar cushion, the pyramidal body, the anterior portion of the plantar  surface of the os pedis, and over the anterior face of the same bone. In  turn, as the human foot with its sock is covered by the boot, this is  encased by the hoof, the formation of which we shall study later.    To expose the membrane for study the hoof must be removed. This may be done  in two ways. By roasting in a fire, and afterwards dragging off the horny  structures with a pair of pincers, a knife having first been passed round  the superior edge of the horny box. Or by maceration in water for several  days, when the hoof will become loosened by the process of decomposition,  and may be easily removed by the hands. The latter method is less likely  to injure the sensitive structures, and will expose them with a fresh  appearance for observation.    For purposes of description the keratogenous membrane is divided into three  regions:      1. The Coronary Cushion.    2. The Velvety Tissue.    3. The Podophyllous Tissue, or the Sensitive laminae.    1. THE CORONARY CUSHION. In the foot stripped of the hoof the coronary  cushion is seen as a rounded structure overhanging the sensitive laminae  after the manner of a cornice. It extends from the inner to the outer bulbs  of the plantar cushion, and is bounded above by the perioplic ring, and  below by the laminae.    When _in situ_ it is accommodated by the _Cutigeral Groove_, a cavity  produced by the bevelling out of the superior portion of the inner face of  the wall of the hoof. Its superior surface is covered by numerous elongated  papillae, set so closely as to give the appearance of the 'pile' of velvet.  This is observed to the best advantage with the foot immersed in water.    _The Superior Border_ of the cushion is bounded by the _Perioplic Ring_,  the cells of which have as their function the secreting of the _Periople_,  a layer of thin horn to be noted afterwards as covering the external face  of the wall. From the perioplic ring the cushion is separated by a narrow  and shallow, though well-marked, groove.    The inferior border is bounded by the sensitive laminae.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--THE KERATOGENOUS MEMBRANE (VIEWED FROM THE SIDE).  (THE HOOF REMOVED BY MACERATION.) 1. The sensitive laminae, or podophyllous  tissue; 2, the coronary cushion; 3, the perioplic ring; 4, portion of  plantar cushion; 5, groove separating perioplic ring from coronary cushion;  6. the sensitive sole.]    The upper portions of the laminae, those in contact with the cushion, are  pale in contrast with the portions immediately below, and thus there is  given the appearance of a white zone adjoining the inferior border of the  cushion.    Widest at its centre, the cushion narrows towards its extremities, which,  arriving at the bulbs of the plantar cushion, bend downwards into the  lateral lacunae of the pyramidal body, where they merge into the velvety  tissue of the sole and frog.    The papillae of the coronary cushion secrete the horn tubules forming the  wall, and the papillae of the perioplic ring secrete the varnish-like veneer  of thin horn covering the outside surface of the hoof.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--THE KERATOGENOUS MEMBRANE (VIEWED FROM BELOW).  (THE HOOF REMOVED BY MACERATION.) 1, The sensitive sole; 2, the sensitive  frog[A]--(a) its median lacuna, (6) its lateral lacuna; 3. V-shaped  depression accommodating the toe-stay; 4, the sensitive laminae which  interleave with the horny laminae of the bar.]    [Footnote A: The sensitive frog thinly invests the plantar cushion or  fibre-fatty frog, the outline of which is here indicated.]    2. THE VELVETY TISSUE.--This is the portion of the keratogenous membrane  covering the plantar surface of the os pedis and the plantar cushion. To  the irregularities of the latter body--its bulbs, pyramidal body, and its  lacunae--it is closely adapted. Its surface may, therefore, be divided into  _(a) The Sensitive Frog_, and _(b) The Sensitive Sole_.    _(a) The Sensitive Frog_ is that part of the velvety tissue moulded on the  lower surface of the plantar cushion. The shape of the plantar cushion has  already been described as identical with that of the horny frog. It only  remains to state that, like the coronary cushion, the surface of the  sensitive frog is closely studded with papillae. The cells clothing the  papillae are instrumental in forming the horny frog.    _(b) The Sensitive Sole_.--As its name indicates, this is the portion of  the keratogenous membrane that covers the plantar surface of the os pedis.  It also is clothed with papillae, which again give rise to the formation of  that part of the horny box to which they are adapted--namely, the sole.    3. THE PODOPHYLLOUS TISSUE, OR SENSITIVE LAMINAE.--This portion of the  keratogenous membrane is spread over the anterior face and sides of the os  pedis, limited above by the coronary cushion, and below by the inferior  edge of the bone. It presents the appearance of fine longitudinal streaks,  which, when closely examined with a needle, are found to consist of  numerous fine leaves. These extend downwards from the lower border of the  coronary cushion to the inferior margin of the os pedis. At this point each  terminates in several large villous prolongations, which extend into the  horny tubes at the circumference of the sole. At the point of the toe this  membrane sometimes shows a V-shaped depression, into which fits a inverted  V-shaped prominence on the inner surface of the wall at this point.    The sensitive laminae increase in width from above to below. Their free  margin is finely denticulated, while"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11212"],[0,"Modern India (#7)"],[1,"is used, but even there its introduction is discouraged;  first, because the natives are very conservative and disinclined  to adopt new means and new methods; and, second, and what is  more important, every labor-saving implement and machine that  comes into the country deprives hundreds of poor coolies of  employment.    The development of the material resources of India is slowly going  on, and mechanical industries are being gradually established,  with the encouragement of the government, for the purpose of  attracting the surplus labor from the farms and villages and  employing it in factories and mills, and in the mines of southern  India, which are supposed to be very rich. These enterprises  offer limited possibilities for the sale of machinery, and  American-made machines are recognized as superior to all others.  There is also a demand for everything that can be used by the foreign  population, which in India is numbered somewhere about a million  people, but the trade is controlled largely by British merchants  who have life-long connections at home, and it is difficult to  remove their prejudices or persuade them to see the superiority  of American goods. Nevertheless, our manufactories, on their  merits, are gradually getting a footing in the market.    When Mark Twain was in Bombay, a few years ago, he met with an  unusual experience for a mortal. He was a guest of the late Mr.  Tata, a famous Parsee merchant, and received a great deal of  attention. All the foreigners in the city knew him, and had read  his books, and there are in Bombay hundreds of highly cultivated  and educated natives. He hired a servant, as every stranger does,  and was delighted when he discovered a native by the name of  Satan among the numerous applicants. He engaged him instantly  on his name; no other recommendation was necessary. To have a  servant by the name of Satan was a privilege no humorist had  ever before enjoyed, and the possibilities to his imagination  were without limit. And it so happened that on the very day Satan  was employed, Prince Aga Khan, the head of a Persian sect of  Mohammedans, who is supposed to have a divine origin and will  be worshiped as a god when he dies, came to call on Mr. Clemens.  Satan was in attendance, and when he appeared with the card upon  a tray, Mr. Clemens asked if he knew anything about the caller;  if he could give him some idea who he was, because, when a prince  calls in person upon an American tourist, it is considered a  distinguished honor. Aga Khan is well known to everybody in Bombay,  and one of the most conspicuous men in the city. He is a great  favorite in the foreign colony, and is as able a scholar as he  is a charming gentleman. Satan, with all the reverence of his  race, appreciated the religious aspect of the visitor more highly  than any other, and in reply to the question of his new master  explained that Aga Khan was a god.    It was a very gratifying meeting for both gentlemen, who found  each other entirely congenial. Aga Khan has a keen sense of humor  and had read everything Mark Twain had written, while, on the other  hand, the latter was distinctly impressed with the personality of  his caller. That evening, when he came down to dinner, his host  asked how he had passed the day:    \"I have had the time of my life,\" was the prompt reply, \"and  the greatest honor I have ever experienced. I have hired Satan  for a servant, and a God called to tell me how much he liked  Huck Finn.\"          III    SERVANTS, HOTELS AND CAVE TEMPLES    Everybody who comes to India must have a personal servant, a  native who performs the duty of valet, waiter and errand boy and  does other things that he is told. It is said to be impossible  to do without one and I am inclined to think that is true, for it  is a fixed custom of the country, and when a stranger attempts  to resist, or avoid or reform the customs of a country his trouble  begins. Many of the Indian hotels expect guests to bring their own  servants--to furnish their own chambermaids and waiters--hence are  short-handed, and the traveler who hasn't provided himself with  that indispensable piece of baggage has to look after himself.  On the railways a native servant is even more important, for  travelers are required to carry their own bedding, make their  own beds and furnish their own towels. The company provides a  bench for them to sleep on, similar to those we have in freight  cabooses at home, a wash room and sometimes water. But if you  want to wash your face and hands in the morning it is always  better to send your servant to the station master before the  trains starts to see that the tank is filled. Then a naked Hindu  with a goat-skin of water comes along, fills the tank and stands  around touching his forehead respectfully every time you look  his way until you give him a penny. The eating houses along the  railway lines also expect travelers to bring their own servants,  who raid their shelves and tables for food and drink and take it  out to the cars. That is another of the customs of the country.    For these reasons a special occupation has been created, peculiar  to India--that of travelers' servants, or \"bearers\" as they are  called. I have never been able to satisfy myself as to the derivation  of the name. Some wise men say that formerly, before the days of  railroads, people were carried about in sedan chairs, as they  are still in China, and the men who carried them were called  \"bearers;\" others contend that the name is due to the circumstance  that these servants bear the white man's burden, which is not at  all likely. They certainly do not bear his baggage. They hire  coolies to do it. A self-respecting \"bearer\" will employ somebody  at your expense to do everything he can avoid doing and will  never demean himself by carrying a trunk, or a bag, or even a  parcel. You give him money to pay incidental expenses, for you  don't want him bothering you all the time, and he hires other  natives to do the work. But his wages are small. A first-class  bearer, who can talk English and cook, pack trunks, look after  tickets, luggage and other business of travel, serve as guide  at all places of interest and compel merchants to pay him a  commission upon everything his employer purchases, can be obtained  for forty-five rupees, which is $15 a month, and keep himself.  He gets his board for nothing at the hotels for waiting on his  master, and on the pretext that he induced him to come there.  But you have to pay his railway fare, third class, and give him  $3 to buy warm clothing. He never buys it, because he does not  need it, but that's another custom of the country. Then again,  at the end of the engagement he expects a present--a little  backsheesh--two or three dollars, and a certificate that you are  pleased with his services.    That is the cost of the highest priced man, who can be guide  as well as servant, but you can get \"bearers\" with lesser  accomplishments for almost any wages, down as low as $2 a month.  But they are not only worthless; they actually imperil your soul  because of their exasperating ways and general cussedness. You  often hear that servants are cheap in India, that families pay  their cooks $3 a month and their housemen $2, which is true;  but they do not earn any more. One Swede girl will do as much  work as a dozen Hindus, and do it much better than they, and,  what is even more important to the housewife, can be relied upon.  In India women never go out to service except as nurses, but  in every household you will find not less than seven or eight  men servants, and sometimes twenty, who receive from $1 to $5  a month each in wages, but the total amounts up, and they have  to be fed, and they will steal, every one of them, and lie and  loaf, and cause an infinite amount of trouble and confusion,  simply because they are cheap. High-priced servants usually are  an economy--good things always cost money, but give better  satisfaction.    Another common mistake is that Indian hotel prices are low. They are  just as high as anywhere else in the world for the accommodations.  I have noticed that wherever you go the same amount of luxury and  comfort costs about the same amount of money. You pay for all  you get in an Indian hotel. The service is bad because travelers  are expected to bring their own servants to answer their calls,  to look after their rooms and make their beds, and in some places  to wait on them in the dining-room. There are no women about the  houses. Men do everything, and if they have been well trained as  cleaners the hotel is neat. If they have been badly trained the  contrary may be expected. The same may be said of the cooking.  The landlord and his guest are entirely at the mercy of the cook,  and the food is prepared according to his ability and education.  You get very little beef because cows are sacred and steers are  too valuable to kill. The mutton is excellent, and there is plenty  of it. You cannot get better anywhere, and at places near the  sea they serve an abundance of fish. Vegetables are plenty and  are usually well cooked. The coffee is poor and almost everybody  drinks tea. You seldom sit down to a hotel table in India without  finding chickens cooked in a palatable way for breakfast, lunch  and dinner, and eggs are equally good and plenty. The bread is  usually bad, and everybody calls for toast. The deserts are usually  quite good.    It takes a stranger some time to become accustomed to barefooted  servants, but few of the natives in India of whatever class wear  shoes. Rich people, business men, merchants, bankers and others  who come in contact on equal terms with the foreign population  usually wear them in the streets, but kick them off and go around  barefooted as soon as they reach their own offices or their homes.  Although a servant may be dressed in elaborate livery, he never  wears shoes. The butlers,"]]]
