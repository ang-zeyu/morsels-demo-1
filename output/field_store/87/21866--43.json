[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8567"],[0,"The Iroquois Book of Rites (#6)"],[1," derived from the root _yaner_, noble, and precisely  equivalent in meaning to the English \"nobleman\" or \"lord,\" as applied to  a member of the House of Peers. It is the word by which the missionaries  have rendered the title \"Lord\" in the New Testament.]    The boast was not unwarranted. Though planned by another, the structure  had been reared mainly by his labors. But the Five Nations, while  yielding abundant honor to the memory of Dekanawidah, have never  regarded him with the same affectionate reverence which has always clung  to the name of Hiawatha. His tender and lofty wisdom, his wide-reaching  benevolence, and his fervent appeals to their better sentiments,  enforced by the eloquence of which he was master, touched chords in the  popular heart which have continued to respond until this day. Fragments  of the speeches in which he addressed the council and the people of the  league are still remembered and repeated. The fact that the league only  carried out a part of the grand design which he had in view is  constantly affirmed. Yet the failure was not due to lack of effort. In  pursuance of his original purpose, when the league was firmly  established, envoys were sent to other tribes to urge them to join it,  or at least to become allies. One of these embassies penetrated to the  distant Cherokees, the hereditary enemies of the Iroquois nations. For  some reason with which we are not acquainted, perhaps the natural  suspicion or vindictive pride of that powerful community, this mission  was a failure. Another, dispatched to the western Algonkins, had better  success. A strict alliance was formed with the far-spread Ojibway  tribes, and was maintained inviolate for at least two hundred years,  until at length the influence of the French, with the sympathy of the  Ojibways for the conquered Hurons, undid to some extent, though not  entirely, this portion of Hiawatha's work.    His conceptions were beyond his time, and beyond ours; but their effect,  within a limited sphere, was very great. For more than three centuries  the bond which he devised held together the Iroquois nations in perfect  amity. It proved, moreover, as he intended, elastic.--The territory of  the Iroquois, constantly extending as their united strength made itself  felt, became the \"Great Asylum\" of the Indian tribes. Of the conquered  Eries and Hurons, many hundreds were received and adopted among their  conquerors. The Tuscaroras, expelled by the English from North Carolina,  took refuge with the Iroquois, and became the sixth nation of the  League. From still further south, the Tuteloes and Saponies, of Dakota  stock, after many wars with the Iroquois, fled to them from their other  enemies, and found a cordial welcome. A chief still sits in the council  as a representative of the Tuteloes, though the tribe itself has been  swept away by disease, or absorbed in the larger nations. Many fragments  of tribes of Algonkin lineage--Delawares, Nanticokes, Mohegans,  Mississagas--sought the same hospitable protection, which never failed  them. Their descendants still reside on the Canadian Reservation, which  may well be styled an aboriginal \"refuge of nations,\" affording a  striking evidence in our own day of the persistent force of a great  idea, when embodied in practical shape by the energy of a master mind.    The name by which their constitution or organic law is known among them  is _kayanerenh_, to which the epitaph _kowa_, \"great,\" is frequently  added. This word, _kayanerenh_, is sometimes rendered \"law,\" or  \"league,\" but its proper meaning seems to be \"peace.\" It is used in this  sense by the missionaries, in their translations of the scriptures and  the prayer-book. In such expressions as the \"Prince of Peace,\" \"the  author of peace,\" \"give peace in our time,\" we find _kayanerenh_  employed with this meaning. Its root is _yaner_, signifying \"noble,\" or  \"excellent,\" which yields, among many derivatives, _kayanere_,  \"goodness,\" and _kayanerenh_, \"peace,\" or \"peacefulness.\" The national  hymn of the confederacy, sung whenever their \"Condoling Council\" meets,  commences with a verse referring to their league, which is literally  rendered, \"We come to greet and thank the PEACE\" (_kayanerenh_). When  the list of their ancient chiefs, the fifty original councillors, is  chanted in the closing litany of the meeting, there is heard from time  to time, as the leaders of each clan are named, an outburst of praise,  in the words--      \"This was the roll of you--     You that combined in the work,     You that completed the work,     The GREAT PEACE.\" (_Kayanerenh-kowa_.)    The regard of Englishmen for their Magna Charta and Bill of Rights, and  that of Americans for their national Constitution, seem weak in  comparison with the intense gratitude and reverence of the Five Nations  for the \"Great Peace,\" which Hiawatha and his colleagues established for  them. Of the subsequent life of Hiawatha, and of his death, we have no  sure information. The records of the Iroquois are historical, and not  biographical. As Hiawatha had been made a chief among the Caniengas, he  doubtless continued to reside with that nation. A tradition, which is in  itself highly probable, represents him as devoting himself to the  congenial work of clearing away the obstructions in the streams which  intersect the country then inhabited by the confederated nations, and  which formed the chief means of communication between them. That he  thus, in some measure, anticipated the plans of De Witt Clinton and his  associates, on a smaller scale, but perhaps with a larger statesmanship,  we may be willing enough to believe. A wild legend recorded by some  writers, but not told of him by the Canadian Iroquois, and apparently  belonging to their ancient mythology, gives him an apotheosis, and makes  him ascend to heaven in a white canoe. It may be proper to dwell for a  moment on the singular complication of mistakes which has converted this  Indian reformer and statesman into a mythological personage.    When by the events of the Revolutionary war the original confederacy was  broken up, the larger portion of the people followed Brant to Canada.  The refugees comprised nearly the whole of the Caniengas, and the  greater part of the Onondagas and Cayugas, with many members of the  other nations. In Canada their first proceeding was to reestablish, as  far as possible, their ancient league, with all its laws and ceremonies.  The Onondagas had brought with them most of their wampum records, and  the Caniengas jealously preserved the memories of the federation, in  whose formation they had borne a leading part. The history of the league  continued to be the topic of their orators whenever a new chief was  installed into office. Thus the remembrance of the facts has been  preserved among them with much clearness and precision, and with little  admixture of mythological elements. With the fragments of the tribes  which remained on the southern side of the Great Lakes the case was very  different. A feeble pretense was made, for a time, of keeping up the  semblance of the old confederacy; but except among the Senecas, who, of  all the Five Nations, had had least to do with the formation of the  league, the ancient families which had furnished the members of their  senate, and were the conservators of their history, had mostly fled to  Canada or the West. The result was that among the interminable stories  with which the common people beguile their winter nights, the traditions  of Atotarho and Hiawatha became intermingled with the legends of their  mythology. An accidental similarity, in the Onondaga dialect, between  the name of Hiawatha and that of one of their ancient divinities, led to  a confusion between the two, which has misled some investigators. This  deity bears, in the sonorous Canienga tongue, the name of Taronhiawagon,  meaning \"the Holder of the Heavens.\" The Jesuit missionaries style him  \"the great god of the Iroquois.\" Among the Onondagas of the present day,  the name is abridged to Taonhiawagi, or Tahiawagi. The confusion between  this name and that of Hiawatha (which, in another form, is pronounced  Tahionwatha) seems to have begun more than a century ago; for Pyrteus,  the Moravian missionary, heard among the Iroquois (according to  Heckewelder) that the person who first proposed the league was an  ancient Mohawk, named Thannawege. Mr. J. V. H. Clarke, in his  interesting History of Onondaga, makes the name to have been originally  Ta-oun-ya-wat-ha, and describes the bearer as \"the deity who presides  over fisheries and hunting-grounds.\" He came down from heaven in a white  canoe, and after sundry adventures, which remind one of the labors of  Hercules, assumed the name of Hiawatha (signifying, we are told, \"a very  wise man\"), and dwelt for a time as an ordinary mortal among men,  occupied in works of benevolence. Finally, after founding the  confederacy and bestowing many prudent counsels upon the people, he  returned to the skies by the same conveyance in which he had descended.  This legend, or, rather, congeries of intermingled legends, was  communicated by Clark to Schoolcraft, when the latter was compiling his  \"Notes on the Iroquois.\" Mr. Schoolcraft, pleased with the poetical cast  of the story, and the euphonious name, made confusion worse confounded  by transferring the hero to a distant region and identifying him with  Manabozho, a fantastic divinity of the Ojibways. Schoolcraft's volume,  which he chose to entitle \"The Hiawatha Legends,\" has not in it a single  fact or fiction relating either to Hiawatha himself or to the Iroquois  deity Taronhiawagon. Wild Ojibway stories concerning Manabozho and his  comrades form the staple of its contents. But it is to this collection  that we owe the charming poem of Longfellow; and thus, by an  extraordinary fortune, a grave Iroquois lawgiver of the fifteenth  century has become, in modern"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8578"],[0,"The Grand Inquisitor (#6)"],[1,"found among them one single  genuine martyr suffering under a great and holy idea and loving  humanity with all his heart? Now let us suppose that among all  these Jesuits thirsting and hungering but after 'mean material  pleasures' there may be one, just one like my old Inquisitor, who  had himself fed upon roots in the wilderness, suffered the  tortures of damnation while trying to conquer flesh, in order to  become free and perfect, but who had never ceased to love  humanity, and who one day prophetically beheld the truth; who saw  as plain as he could see that the bulk of humanity could never be  happy under the old system, that it was not for them that the  great Idealist had come and died and dreamt of His Universal  Harmony. Having realized that truth, he returned into the world  and joined--intelligent and practical people. Is this so  impossible?\"    \"Joined whom? What intelligent and practical people?\" exclaimed  Alyosha quite excited. \"Why should they be more intelligent than  other men, and what secrets and mysteries can they have? They  have neither. Atheism and infidelity is all the secret they have.  Your Inquisitor does not believe in God, and that is all the  Mystery there is in it!\"    \"It may be so. You have guessed rightly there. And it is so, and  that is his whole secret; but is this not the acutest sufferings  for such a man as he, who killed all his young life in asceticism  in the desert, and yet could not cure himself of his love towards  his fellowmen? Toward the end of his life he becomes convinced  that it is only by following the advice of the great and terrible  spirit that the fate of these millions of weak rebels, these  'half-finished samples of humanity created in mockery' can be  made tolerable.  And once convinced of it, he sees as clearly  that to achieve that object, one must follow blindly the guidance  of the wise spirit, the fearful spirit of death and destruction,  hence accept a system of lies and deception and lead humanity  consciously this time toward death and destruction, and moreover,  be deceiving them all the while in order to prevent them from  realizing where they are being led, and so force the miserable  blind men to feel happy, at least while here on earth. And note  this: a wholesale deception in the name of Him, in whose ideal  the old man had so passionately, so fervently, believed during  nearly his whole life! Is this no suffering? And were such a  solitary exception found amidst, and at the head of, that army  'that thirsts for power but for the sake of the mean pleasures of  life,' think you one such man would not suffice to bring on a  tragedy? Moreover, one single man like my Inquisitor as a  principal leader, would prove sufficient to discover the real  guiding idea of the Romish system with all its armies of Jesuits,  the greatest and chiefest conviction that the solitary type  described in my poem has at no time ever disappeared from among  the chief leaders of that movement. Who knows but that terrible  old man, loving humanity so stubbornly and in such an original  way, exists even in our days in the shape of a whole host of such  solitary exceptions, whose existence is not due to mere chance,  but to a well-defined association born of mutual consent, to a  secret league, organized several centuries back, in order to  guard the Mystery from the indiscreet eyes of the miserable and  weak people, and only in view of their own happiness? And so it  is; it cannot be otherwise. I suspect that even Masons have some  such Mystery underlying the basis of their organization, and that  it is just the reason why the Roman Catholic clergy hate them so,  dreading to find in them rivals, competition, the dismemberment  of the unity of the idea, for the realization of which one flock  and one Shepherd are needed. However, in defending my idea, I  look like an author whose production is unable to stand  criticism. Enough of this.\"    \"You are, perhaps, a Mason yourself!\" exclaimed Alyosha. \"You do  not believe in God,\" he added, with a note of profound sadness in  his voice. But suddenly remarking that his brother was looking at  him with mockery, \"How do you mean then to bring your poem to a  close?\" he unexpectedly enquired, casting his eyes downward, \"or  does it break off here?\"    \"My intention is to end it with the following scene: Having  disburdened his heart, the Inquisitor waits for some time to hear  his prisoner speak in His turn. His silence weighs upon him. He  has seen that his captive has been attentively listening to him  all the time, with His eyes fixed penetratingly and softly on the  face of his jailer, and evidently bent upon not replying to him.  The old man longs to hear His voice, to hear Him reply; better  words of bitterness and scorn than His silence. Suddenly He  rises; slowly and silently approaching the Inquisitor, He bends  towards him and softly kisses the bloodless, four-score  and-ten-year-old lips. That is all the answer. The Grand Inquisitor  shudders. There is a convulsive twitch at the corner of his  mouth. He goes to the door, opens it, and addressing Him, 'Go,'  he says, 'go, and return no more... do not come again... never,  never!' and--lets Him out into the dark night. The prisoner  vanishes.\"    \"And the old man?\"    \"The kiss burns his heart, but the old man remains firm in his  own ideas and unbelief.\"    \"And you, together with him? You too!\" despairingly exclaimed  Alyosha, while Ivan burst into a still louder fit of laughter."]]]
