Such questions as: Who may demand     international intervention? What body will decide whether the demand     should be complied with? How will the international forces be     constituted? Who will take charge of the military and naval     operations? Who will pay the expenses of the war (for war it     will be)?       \"Perplexing as these questions appear to me, I am more concerned with     the direct effect on this country. I do not believe that it is wise     to limit our independence of action, a sovereign right, to the will     of other powers beyond this hemisphere. In any representative     international body clothed with authority to require of the nations     to employ their armies and navies to coerce one of their number, we     would be in the minority. I do not believe that we should put     ourselves in the position of being compelled to send our armed forces     to Europe or Asia or, in the alternative, of repudiating our treaty     obligation. Neither our sovereignty nor our interests would accord     with such a proposition, and I am convinced that popular opinion as     well as the Senate would reject a treaty framed along such lines.       \"It is possible that the difficulty might be obviated by the     establishment of geographical zones, and leaving to the groups of     nations thus formed the enforcement of the peaceful settlement of     disputes. But if that is done why should all the world participate?     We have adopted a much modified form of this idea in the proposed     Pan-American Treaty by the 'guaranty' article. But I would not like     to see its stipulations extended to the European powers so that they,     with our full agreement, would have the right to cross the ocean and     stop quarrels between two American Republics. Such authority would be     a serious menace to the Monroe Doctrine and a greater menace to the     Pan-American Doctrine.       \"It appears to me that, if the first idea of the League can be worked     out in a practical way and an international body constituted to     determine when steps should be taken to enforce compliance, the use     of force might be avoided by outlawing the offending nation. No     nation to-day can live unto itself. The industrial and commercial     activities of the world are too closely interwoven for a nation     isolated from the other nations to thrive and prosper. A tremendous     economic pressure could be imposed on the outlawed nation by all     other nations denying it intercourse of every nature, even     communication, in a word make that nation a pariah, and so to remain     until it was willing to perform its obligations.       \"I am not at all sure that this means is entirely feasible. I see     many difficulties which would have to be met under certain     conditions. But I do think that it is more practical in operation and     less objectionable from the standpoint of national rights and     interests than the one proposed by the League. It does not appear to     me that the use of physical force is in any way practical or     advisable.       \"I presume that you are far more familiar than I am with the details     of the plans of the League and that it may be presumptuous on my part     to write you as I have. I nevertheless felt it my duty to frankly     give you my views on the subject and I have done so.       \"Faithfully yours       \"ROBERT LANSING       \"THE PRESIDENT       \"_The White House_\"    The President, thus early advised of my unqualified opposition to any  plan which was similar in principle to the one advocated by the League  to Enforce Peace, naturally concluded that I would look with disfavor on  an international guaranty which by implication, if not by declaration,  compelled the use of force to give it effect. Doubtless he felt that I  would not be disposed to aid in perfecting a plan which had as its  central idea a guaranty of that nature. Disliking opposition to a plan  or policy which he had originated or made his own by adoption, he  preferred to consult those who without debate accepted his judgment and  were in sympathy with his ideas. Undoubtedly the President by refraining  from asking my advice spared himself from listening to arguments against  the guaranty and the use of force which struck at the very root of his  plan, for I should, if I had been asked, have stated my views with  entire frankness.    The other reason for not consulting me, as I now realize, but did not at  the time, was that I belonged to the legal profession. It is a fact,  which Mr. Wilson has taken no trouble to conceal, that he does not value  the advice of lawyers except on strictly legal questions, and that he  considers their objections and criticisms on other subjects to be too  often based on mere technicalities and their judgments to be warped by  an undue regard for precedent. This prejudice against the legal  profession in general was exhibited on more than one occasion during our  sojourn at Paris. Looking back over my years of intercourse with the  President I can now see that he chafed under the restraints imposed by  usage and even by enacted laws if they interfered with his acting in a  way which seemed to him right or justified by conditions. I do not say  that he was lawless. He was not that, but he conformed grudgingly and  with manifest displeasure to legal limitations. It was a thankless task  to question a proposed course of action on the ground of illegality,  because he appeared to be irritated by such an obstacle to his will and  to transfer his irritation against the law to the one who raised it as  an objection. I think that he was especially resentful toward any one  who volunteered criticism based on a legal provision, precept, or  precedent, apparently assuming that the critic opposed his purpose on  the merits and in order to defeat it interposed needless legal  objections. It is unnecessary to comment on the prejudice which such an  attitude of mind made evident.    After the President's exceptionally strong address at the Metropolitan  Opera House in New York on September 27, 1918, I realized the great  importance which he gave to the creation of a League of Nations and in  view of this I devoted time and study to the subject, giving particular  attention to the British and French suggestions, both of which  emphasized judicial settlement. Knowing that the President had been in  consultation with Colonel House on the various phases of the peace to be  negotiated as well as on the terms of the armistice, I asked the latter  what he knew about the former's scheme for a League of Nations.    The Colonel discreetly avoided disclosing the details of the plan, but  from our conversation I gained an idea of the general principles of the  proposed organization and the way in which the President intended to  apply them.    After the Colonel and his party had sailed for France and in expectation  of being consulted on the subject by President Wilson, I put my thoughts  on the League of Nations into writing. In a note, which is dated October  27, 1918, appears the following:       \"From the little I know of the President's plan I am sure that it is     impracticable. There is in it too much altruistic cooperation. No     account is taken of national selfishness and the mutual suspicions     which control international relations. It may be noble thinking, but     it is not true thinking.       \"What I fear is that a lot of dreamers and theorists will be selected     to work out an organization instead of men whose experience and     common sense will tell them not to attempt anything which will not     work. The scheme ought to be simple and practical. If the federation,     or whatever it may be called, is given too much power or if its     machinery is complex, my belief is that it will be unable to function     or else will be defied. I can see lots of trouble ahead unless     impractical enthusiasts and fanatics are suppressed. This is a time     when sober thought, caution, and common sense should control.\"    On November 22, 1918, after I had been formally designated as a Peace  Commissioner, I made another note for the purpose of crystallizing my  own thought on the subject of a League of Nations. Although President  Wilson had not then consulted me in any way regarding his plan of  organization, I felt sure that he would, and I wished to be prepared to  give him my opinion concerning the fundamentals of the plan which might  be proposed on behalf of the United States. I saw, or thought that I  saw, a disposition to adopt physical might as the basis of the  organization, because the guaranty, which the President had announced in  Point XIV and evidently purposed to advocate, seemed to require the use  of force in the event that it became necessary to make it good.    From the note of November 22 I quote the following:       \"The legal principle [of the equality of nations], whatever its basis     in fact, must be preserved, otherwise force rather than law, the     power to act rather than the right to act, becomes the fundamental     principle of organization, just as it has been in all previous     Congresses and Concerts of the European Powers.       \"It appears to me that a positive guaranty of territorial integrity     and political independence by the nations would have to rest upon an     open recognition of dominant coercive power in the articles of     agreement, the power being commercial and economic as well as     physical. The wisdom of entering into such a guaranty is questionable     and should be carefully considered before being adopted.       \"In order to avoid the recognition of force as a basis and the     question of dominant force with the unavoidable classification of     nations into 'big' and 'little,' 'strong' and 'weak,' the desired     result of a guaranty might be attained by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10475"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 12, No. 326, August (#7)"],[1,"domestic fires.    On new-year's eve, they perfume hot water with the leaves of Wongpe and  Pumelo trees, and bathe in it. At midnight they arise and dress in the  best clothes and caps they can procure; then towards heaven kneel down,  and perform the great imperial ceremony of knocking the forehead on the  ground thrice three times. Next they illuminate as splendidly as they  can, and pray for felicity towards some domestic idol. Then they visit  all the gods in the various surrounding temples, burn candles, incense,  gilt paper, make bows, and prostrate pray.    These services to the gods being finished, they sally forth about  daylight in all directions, to visit friends and neighbours, leaving a  red paper card at each house. Some stay at home to receive visitors. In  the house, sons and daughters, servants and slaves, all dress, and  appear before the heads of the family, to congratulate them on the new  year.    After new year's day, drinking and carousing, visiting and feasting,  idleness and dissipation, continue for weeks. All shops are shut, and  workmen idle, for a longer or shorter period, according to the  necessities, or the habits, of the several parties. It is, in Canton,  generally a month before the business of life returns to its ordinary  channel.      MEETING THE SPRING.    February 4, is a great holiday throughout the empire. It is called  Yingchun, that is, meeting the spring, to-morrow, when the sun enters  the 15 deg. of Aquarius, being considered the commencement of the spring  season. It is a sort of Lord Mayor's day. The chief magistrate of the  district goes forth in great pomp, carried on men's shoulders, in an  open chair, with gongs beating, music playing, and nymphs and satyrs  seated among artificial rocks and trees, carried in procession.    He goes to the general parade-ground, on the east side of Canton, on the  following day, being Lapchun, the first day of spring, in a similar  style. There a buffalo, with an agricultural god made of clay, having  been paraded through the streets, and pelted by the populace, to impel  its labours, is placed on the ground, in solemn state, when this  official priest of spring gives it a few strokes with a whip, and leaves  it to the populace, who pelt it with stones till it is broken to pieces;  and so the foolish ceremony terminates. The due observance of this  ancient usage is supposed to contribute greatly to an abundant year.      PAWNBROKING.    Is carried on to a very great extent in China. The system seems divided  into two parts; one branch affording aid to those in the very inferior  walks of life, and chiefly confined to very small advances; the other  granting loans upon deposits of higher value, and corresponding with  similar establishments in England. These are authorized by the  government; but there are others, we are informed, that exist without  this sanction, and are directed to the relief of the mercantile  interest. These assimilate very nearly to the late project in London of  an Equitable Loan Company, making advances upon cargoes and large  deposits of goods.    These houses are as conspicuously indicated, by an exterior sign over  the door, as our shops in England are by the three golden balls; but,  whether they indicate the same doctrine of chance as to the return of  property, we will not pretend to say. Three years are allowed to redeem,  with a grace of three months.      TORTURE.    In China, the laws still permit torture, to a defined extent, and the  magistrate often inflicts it, contrary to law. Compressing the ancles of  men between wooden levers, and the fingers of women with a small  apparatus, on the same principle, is the most usual form. But there are  many other devices suggested and practised, contrary to law; and in  every part of the empire, for some years past, there have been many  instances of suspected persons, or those falsely accused, being tortured  till death ensued. From Hoopih province, an appeal is now before the  emperor, against a magistrate who tortured a man to death, to extort a  confession of homicide; and we have just heard, from Kwang-se province,  that on the 24th of the 11th moon, one Netseyuen, belonging to Canton,  having received an appointment for his high literary attainments, to the  magistracy of a Heen district, in a fit of drunkenness, subjected a  young man, on his bridal day, to the torture, because he would not  resign the band of music which he had engaged to accompany, according to  law and usage, his intended wife to his father's house. The young man's  name was Kwanfa. He died under the torture, and the affrighted  magistrate went and hanged himself.      CHINESE PRISON.    Prisoners who have money to spend, can be accommodated with private  apartments, cards, servants, and every luxury. The prisoners' chains and  fetters are removed from their bodies, and suspended against the wall,  till the hour of going the rounds occurs; after that ceremony is over,  the fetters are again placed where they hurt nobody. But those who have  not money to bribe the keepers, are in a woful condition. Not only is  every alleviation of their sufferings removed, but actual infliction of  punishment is added, to extort money to buy \"burnt-offerings\" (of paper)  to the god of the jail, as the phrase is. For this purpose the prisoners  are tied up, or rather hung up, and flogged. At night, they are fettered  down to a board, neck, wrists, and ancles, amidst ordure and filth,  whilst the rats, unmolested, are permitted to gnaw their limbs! This  place of torment is proverbially called, in ordinary speech, \"Te-yuk,\" a  term equivalent to the worst sense of the word \"hell.\"      TOUR ROUND THE CITY WALLS.    It is well known that the Chinese consider their walled towns in the  same light as fortifications are regarded in Europe, and disallow  foreigners entering them, excepting on special occasions. But there is  no law against walking in the suburbs. Usage has, however, limited the  Europeans in China to very small bounds. Some persons occasionally  violate them, and attempt a longer walk. Once round the city walls has  frequently been effected, but always at the risk of a scuffle, an  assault and battery, from the idle and mischievous among the native  population. On former occasions, some of the foreign tourists have  returned to the factories relieved of the burden of their watches and  clothes. An English baronet was once, on his passage round, robbed of  his watch, and stripped either almost, or entirely naked.    A few days ago, a party of three started at six o'clock in the morning,  and performed the circuit at about eight, with impunity. The distance  round the walls they estimated to be nine miles. A few days afterwards,  two persons set off in the evening for a walk under the city walls; but  they were not so fortunate. They were violently assaulted by a rabble of  men and boys, the former of whom pursued them with bludgeons, brickbats,  and stones, which not only inflicted severe contusions, but really  endangered their lives. The two foreigners were obliged to face about,  and fight and run alternately the distance of several miles.    We, who know the hostile feelings of the population, are not surprised  at the occurrence, and rather congratulate the tourists that they  effected their escape so well. We notice the affair to put others on  their guard; and (as the Chinese say) if they should get into a similar  scrape, they cannot blame us for not warning them of their danger.           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER      \"A snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.\"    SHAKSPEARE.

One of the subjects for confirmation at a bishop's recent visitation, on  being asked by the clergyman to whom she applied for her certificate of  qualifications, what her godfathers and godmothers promised for her,  said, with much _naivete_, \"I've a yeard that they promised to give me  hafe a dozen zilver spoons, but I've never had 'em though.\"           *       *       *       *       *      A GOOD WIFE.
