But you know who I am now, and what I'm  here for. If you like to give me the information I want, I'll go into the  case for you, and, of course, I shan't charge any fee. I may have luck,  you know, but I can't promise, of course.\"    The landlord looked in Hewitt's face for a moment. Then he said: \"Done!  It's a deal.\"    \"Very good,\" Hewitt replied; \"get together the one or two papers you have,  and we'll go into my business in the evening. As to Crockett, don't say a  word to anybody. I'm afraid it must get out, since they all know about it  in the house, but there's no use in making any unnecessary noise. Don't  make hedging bets or do anything that will attract notice. Now we'll go  over to the back and look at this cinder-path of yours.\"    Here Steggles, who was still standing near, was struck with an idea. \"How  about old Taylor, at the Cop, guv'nor, eh?\" he said, meaningly. \"His lad's  good enough to win with Sammy out, and Taylor is backing him plenty. Think  he knows any thing o' this?\"    \"That's likely,\" Hewitt observed, before Kentish could reply. \"Yes. Look  here--suppose Steggles goes and keeps his eye on the Cop for an hour or  two, in case there's anything to be heard of? Don't show yourself, of  course.\"    Kentish agreed, and the trainer went. When Hewitt and Kentish arrived at  the path behind the trees, Hewitt at once began examining the ground. One  or two rather large holes in the cinders were made, as the publican  explained, by Crockett, in practicing getting off his mark. Behind these  were several fresh tracks of spiked shoes. The tracks led up to within a  couple of yards of the high fence bounding the ground, and there stopped  abruptly and entirely. In the fence, a little to the right of where the  tracks stopped, there was a stout door. This Hewitt tried, and found ajar.    \"That's always kept bolted,\" Kentish said. \"He's gone out that way--he  couldn't have gone any other without comin' through the house.\"    \"But he isn't in the habit of making a step three yards long, is he?\"  Hewitt asked, pointing at the last footmark and then at the door, which  was quite that distance away from it. \"Besides,\" he added, opening the  door, \"there's no footprint here nor outside.\"    The door opened on a lane, with another fence and a thick plantation of  trees at the other side. Kentish looked at the footmarks, then at the  door, then down the lane, and finally back toward the house. \"That's a  licker!\" he said.    \"This is a quiet sort of lane,\" was Hewitt's next remark. \"No houses in  sight. Where does it lead?\"    \"That way it goes to the Old Kilns--disused. This way down to a turning  off the Padfield and Catton road.\"    Hewitt returned to the cinder-path again, and once more examined the  footmarks. He traced them back over the grass toward the house.  \"Certainly,\" he said, \"he hasn't gone back to the house. Here is the  double line of tracks, side by side, from the house--Steggles' ordinary  boots with iron tips, and Crockett's running pumps; thus they came out.  Here is Steggles' track in the opposite direction alone, made when he went  back for the sweater. Crockett remained; you see various prints in those  loose cinders at the end of the path where he moved this way and that, and  then two or three paces toward the fence--not directly toward the door,  you notice--and there they stop dead, and there are no more, either back  or forward. Now, if he had wings, I should be tempted to the opinion that  he flew straight away in the air from that spot--unless the earth  swallowed him and closed again without leaving a wrinkle on its face.\"    Kentish stared gloomily at the tracks and said nothing.    \"However,\" Hewitt resumed, \"I think I'll take a little walk now and think  over it. You go into the house and show yourself at the bar. If anybody  wants to know how Crockett is, he's pretty well, thank you. By the by, can  I get to the Cop--this place of Taylor's--by this back lane?\"    \"Yes, down to the end leading to the Catton road, turn to the left and  then first on the right. Any one'll show you the Cop,\" and Kentish shut  the door behind the detective, who straightway walked--toward the Old  Kilns.    In little more than an hour he was back. It was now becoming dusk, and the  landlord looked out papers from a box near the side window of his  snuggery, for the sake of the extra light. \"I've got these papers together  for you,\" he said, as Hewitt entered. \"Any news?\"    \"Nothing very great. Here's a bit of handwriting I want you to recognize,  if you can. Get a light.\"    Kentish lit a lamp, and Hewitt laid upon the table half a dozen small  pieces of torn paper, evidently fragments of a letter which had been torn  up, here reproduced in fac-simile:    [Illustration: six scraps of paper: mmy, throw them ou, right away, left  hi, hate his, lane wr]    The landlord turned the scraps over, regarding them dubiously. \"These  aren't much to recognize, anyhow. _I_ don't know the writing. Where did  you find 'em?\"    \"They were lying in the lane at the back, a little way down. Plainly they  are pieces of a note addressed to some one called Sammy or something very  like it. See the first piece, with its 'mmy'? That is clearly from the  beginning of the note, because there is no line between it and the smooth,  straight edge of the paper above; also, nothing follows on the same line.  Some one writes to Crockett--presuming it to be a letter addressed to him,  as I do for other reasons--as Sammy. It is a pity that there is no more of  the letter to be found than these pieces. I expect the person who tore it  up put the rest in his pocket and dropped these by accident.\"    Kentish, who had been picking up and examining each piece in turn, now  dolorously broke out:    \"Oh, it's plain he's sold us--bolted and done us; me as took him out o'  the gutter, too. Look here--'throw them over'; that's plain enough--can't  mean anything else. Means throw _me_ over, and my friends--me, after what  I've done for him! Then 'right away'--go right away, I s'pose, as he has  done. Then\"--he was fiddling with the scraps and finally fitted two  together--\"why, look here, this one with 'lane' on it fits over the one  about throwing over, and it says 'poor f' where its torn; that means 'poor  fool,' I s'pose--_me_, or 'fathead,' or something like that. That's nice.  Why, I'd twist his neck if I could get hold of him; and I will!\"    Hewitt smiled. \"Perhaps it's not quite so uncomplimentary, after all,\" he  said. \"If you can't recognize the writing, never mind. But, if he's gone  away to sell you, it isn't much use finding him, is it? He won't win if he  doesn't want to.\"    \"Why, he wouldn't dare to rope under my very eyes. I'd--I'd----\"    \"Well, well; perhaps we'll get him to run, after all, and as well as he  can. One thing is certain--he left this place of his own will. Further, I  think he is in Padfield now; he went toward the town, I believe. And I  don't think he means to sell you.\"    \"Well, he shouldn't. I've made it worth his while to stick to me. I've put  a fifty on for him out of my own pocket, and told him so; and, if he won,  that would bring him a lump more than he'd probably get by going crooked,  besides the prize money and anything I might give him over. But it seems  to me he's putting me in the cart altogether.\"    \"That we shall see. Meantime, don't mention anything I've told you to any  one--not even to Steggles. He can't help us, and he might blurt things out  inadvertently. Don't say anything about these pieces of paper, which I  shall keep myself. By-the-by, Steggles is indoors, isn't he? Very well,  keep him in. Don't let him be seen hunting about this evening. I'll stay  here to-night and we'll proceed with Crockett's business in the morning.  And now we'll settle _my_ business, please.\"           *       *       *       *       *    In the morning Hewitt took his breakfast in the snuggery, carefully  listening to any conversation that might take place at the bar. Soon after  nine o'clock a fast dog-cart stopped outside, and a red-faced, loud-voiced  man swaggered in, greeting Kentish with boisterous cordiality. He had a  drink with the landlord, and said: \"How's things? Fancy any of 'em for the  sprint handicap? Got a lad o' your own in, haven't you?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" Kentish replied. \"Crockett. Only a young un not got to his  proper mark yet, I reckon. I think old Taylor's got No. 1 this time.\"    \"Capital lad,\" the other replied, with a confidential nod. \"Shouldn't  wonder at all. Want to do anything yourself over it?\"    \"No, I don't think so. I'm not on at present. Might have a little flutter  on the grounds just for fun; nothing else.\"    There were a few more casual remarks, and then the red-faced man drove  away.    \"Who was that?\" asked Hewitt, who had watched the visitor through the  snuggery window.    \"That's Danby--bookmaker. Cute chap. He's been told Crockett's missing,  I'll bet anything, and come here to pump me. No good, though. As a matter  of fact, I've worked Sammy Crockett into his books for about half I'm in  for altogether--through third parties, of course.\"    Hewitt reached for his hat. \"I'm going out for half an hour now,\" he said.  \"If Steggles wants to go out before I come back, don't let him. Let him go  and smooth over all those tracks on the cinder-path, very carefully. And,  by the by, could you manage to have your son about the place to-day, in  case I happen to want a little help out of doors?\"    \"Certainly; I'll get him to stay in. But what do you want the cinders  smoothed for?\"    Hewitt smiled, and patted his host's shoulder. \"I'll explain all my tricks  when the job's done,\" he said, and went out.           *       *       *       *       *    On the lane from Padfield to Sedby village stood the Plough beer-house,  wherein J. Webb was licensed to sell by retail beer to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11255"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#7)"],[1,"peart.    \"When the 'Old War' come on and the Yankees come they took everything  and the black men folks too. They come by right often. They would drive  up at mealtime and come in and rake up every blessed thing was cooked.  Have to go work scrape about and find something else to eat. What they  keer 'bout you being white or black? Thing they was after was filling  theirselves up. They done white folks worse than that. They burned their  cribs and fences up and their houses too about if they got mad. Things  didn't suit them. If they wanted a colored man to go in camp with them  and he didn't go, they would shoot you down like a dog. Ma told about  some folks she knowd got shot in the yard of his own quarters.    \"Us black folks don't want war. They are not war kind of folks. Slavery  wasn't right and that 'Old War' wasn't right neither.    \"When my children was all little I kept Aunt Mandy Buford till she died.  She was a old slave woman. Me and my husband and the biggest children  worked in the field. She would sit about and smoke. My boys made cob  pipes and cut cane j'ints for 'er to draw through. Red cob pipes was the  prettiest. Aunt Mandy said her master would be telling them what to do  in the field and he say to her, 'I talking to you too.' She worked right  among the men at the same kind of work. She was tall but not large. She  carried children on her right hip when she was so young she dragged that  foot when she walked. The reason she had to go with the men to the field  like she did was 'cause she wasn't no multiplying woman. She never had a  chile in all her lifetime. She said her mother nearly got in bad one  time when her sister was carrying a baby. She didn't keep up. Said the  riding boss got down, dug a hole with the hoe to lay her in it 'cause  she was so big in front. Her mother told him if he put her daughter  there in that hole she'd cop him up in pieces wid her hoe. He found he  had two to conquer and he let her be. But he had to leave 'cause he  couldn't whoop the niggers.    \"If I could think of all she tole I'd soon have enough to fill up that  book you're getting up. I can't recollect who she belong to, and her old  talk comes back to me now and then. She talked so much we'd get up and  go on off to keep from hearing her tell things over so many times.    \"Folks like me what got children think the way they do is all right.

Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: Charles Anderson. Helena, Arkansas  Age: 77 or 78, not sure      \"I was born in Bloomfield, Kentucky. My parents had the same owners.  Mary and Elgin Anderson was their names. They was owned by Isaac Stone.  Davis Stone was their son. They belong to the Stones as far back as they  could remember. Mama was darker than I am. My father was brighter than I  am. He likely had a white father. I never inquired. Mama had colored  parents. Master Stone walked with a big crooked stick. He nor his son  never went to war. Masters in that country never went. Two soldiers were  drafted off our place. I saw the soldiers, plenty of them and plenty  times. There never was no serious happenings.    \"The Federal soldiers would come by, sleep in the yard, take our best  horses and leave the broken down ones. Very little money was handled. I  never seen much. Master Stone would give us money like he give money to  Davis. They prized fine stock mostly. They needed money at wheat harvest  time only. When a celebration or circus come through he give us all  twenty-five or thirty cents and told us to go. There wasn't many slaves  up there like down in this country. The owners from all I've heard was  crueler and sold them off oftener here.    \"Weaving was a thing the women prided in doing--being a fast weaver or a  fine hand at weaving. They wove pretty coverlets for the beds. I see  colored spreads now makes me think about my baby days in Kentucky.    \"Freedom was something mysterious. Colored folks didn't talk it. White  folks didn't talk it. The first I realized something different, Master  Stone was going to whip a older brother. He told mama something I was  too small to know. She said, 'Don't leave this year, son. I'm going to  leave.' Master didn't whip him.    \"Master Stone's cousin kept house for him. I remember her well. They  were all very nice to us always. He had a large farm. He had twenty  servants in his yard. We all lived there close together. My sister and  mama cooked. We had plenty to eat. We had beef in spring and summer.  Mutton and kid on special occasions. We had hog in the fall and winter.  We had geese, ducks, and chickens. We had them when we needed them. We  had a field garden. He raised corn, wheat, oats, rye, and tobacco.    \"Once a year we got dressed up. We got shirts, a suit, pants and shoes,  and what else we needed to wear. Then he told them to take care of their  clothes. They got plenty to do a year. We didn't have fine clothes no  time. We didn't eat ham and chicken. I never seen biscuit--only  sometimes.    \"I seen a woman sold. They had on her a short dress, no sleeves, so they  could see her muscles, I reckon. They would buy them and put them with  good healthy men to raise young slaves. I heard that. I was very small  when I seen that young woman sold and years later I heard that was what  was done.    \"I don't know when freedom came on. I never did know. We was five or six  years breaking up. Master Stone never forced any of us to leave. He give  some of them a horse when they left. I cried a year to go back. It was a  dear place to me and the memories linger with me every day.    \"There was no secret society or order of Ku Klux in reach of us as I  ever heard.    \"I voted Republican ticket. We would go to Jackson to vote. There would  be a crowd. The last I voted was for Theodore Roosevelt. I voted here in  Helena for years. I was on the petit jury for several years here in  Helena.    \"I farmed in your state some (Arkansas). I farmed all my young life. I  been in Arkansas sixty years. I come here February 1879 with distant  relatives. They come south. When I come to Helena there was but one set  of mechanics. I started to work. I learned to paint and hang wall paper.  I've worked in nearly every house in Helena.    \"The present times are gloomy. I tried to prepare for old age. I had a  apartment house and lost it. I owned a home and lost it. They foreclosed  me out.    \"The present generation is not doing as well as I have.    \"My health knocked me out. My limbs swell, they are stiff. I have a bad  bladder trouble.    \"I asked for help but never have got none. If I could got a little  relief I never would lost my house. They work my wife to death keeping  us from starving.
