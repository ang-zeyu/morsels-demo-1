Wherefore I beseech you let  the dog and the onions and these people of the strange and godless  names work out their several salvations from their piteous and  wonderful difficulties without help of mine, for indeed their  trouble is sufficient as it is, whereas an I tried to help I should  but damage their cause the more and yet mayhap not live myself  to see the desolation wrought.\"    \"What do you know of the laws of attraction and gravitation?\"    \"If there be such, mayhap his grace the king did promulgate them  whilst that I lay sick about the beginning of the year and thereby  failed to hear his proclamation.\"    \"What do you know of the science of optics?\"    \"I know of governors of places, and seneschals of castles, and  sheriffs of counties, and many like small offices and titles of  honor, but him you call the Science of Optics I have not heard  of before; peradventure it is a new dignity.\"    \"Yes, in this country.\"    Try to conceive of this mollusk gravely applying for an official  position, of any kind under the sun!  Why, he had all the earmarks  of a typewriter copyist, if you leave out the disposition to  contribute uninvited emendations of your grammar and punctuation.  It was unaccountable that he didn't attempt a little help of that  sort out of his majestic supply of incapacity for the job.  But that  didn't prove that he hadn't material in him for the disposition,  it only proved that he wasn't a typewriter copyist yet.  After  nagging him a little more, I let the professors loose on him and  they turned him inside out, on the line of scientific war, and  found him empty, of course.  He knew somewhat about the warfare  of the time--bushwhacking around for ogres, and bull-fights in  the tournament ring, and such things--but otherwise he was empty  and useless.  Then we took the other young noble in hand, and he  was the first one's twin, for ignorance and incapacity.  I delivered  them into the hands of the chairman of the Board with the comfortable  consciousness that their cake was dough.  They were examined in  the previous order of precedence.    \"Name, so please you?\"    \"Pertipole, son of Sir Pertipole, Baron of Barley Mash.\"    \"Grandfather?\"    \"Also Sir Pertipole, Baron of Barley Mash.\"    \"Great-grandfather?\"    \"The same name and title.\"    \"Great-great-grandfather?\"    \"We had none, worshipful sir, the line failing before it had  reached so far back.\"    \"It mattereth not.  It is a good four generations, and fulfilleth  the requirements of the rule.\"    \"Fulfills what rule?\" I asked.    \"The rule requiring four generations of nobility or else the  candidate is not eligible.\"    \"A man not eligible for a lieutenancy in the army unless he can  prove four generations of noble descent?\"    \"Even so; neither lieutenant nor any other officer may be commissioned  without that qualification.\"    \"Oh, come, this is an astonishing thing.  What good is such a  qualification as that?\"    \"What good?  It is a hardy question, fair sir and Boss, since it doth  go far to impugn the wisdom of even our holy Mother Church herself.\"    \"As how?\"    \"For that she hath established the self-same rule regarding  saints.  By her law none may be canonized until he hath lain dead  four generations.\"    \"I see, I see--it is the same thing.  It is wonderful.  In the one  case a man lies dead-alive four generations--mummified in ignorance  and sloth--and that qualifies him to command live people, and take  their weal and woe into his impotent hands; and in the other case,  a man lies bedded with death and worms four generations, and that  qualifies him for office in the celestial camp.  Does the king's  grace approve of this strange law?\"    The king said:    \"Why, truly I see naught about it that is strange.  All places of  honor and of profit do belong, by natural right, to them that be  of noble blood, and so these dignities in the army are their  property and would be so without this or any rule.  The rule is  but to mark a limit.  Its purpose is to keep out too recent blood,  which would bring into contempt these offices, and men of lofty  lineage would turn their backs and scorn to take them.  I were  to blame an I permitted this calamity.  _You_ can permit it an you  are minded so to do, for you have the delegated authority, but  that the king should do it were a most strange madness and not  comprehensible to any.\"    \"I yield.  Proceed, sir Chief of the Herald's College.\"    The chairman resumed as follows:    \"By what illustrious achievement for the honor of the Throne and  State did the founder of your great line lift himself to the  sacred dignity of the British nobility?\"    \"He built a brewery.\"    \"Sire, the Board finds this candidate perfect in all the requirements  and qualifications for military command, and doth hold his case  open for decision after due examination of his competitor.\"    The competitor came forward and proved exactly four generations  of nobility himself.  So there was a tie in military qualifications  that far.    He stood aside a moment, and Sir Pertipole was questioned further:    \"Of what condition was the wife of the founder of your line?\"    \"She came of the highest landed gentry, yet she was not noble;  she was gracious and pure and charitable, of a blameless life and  character, insomuch that in these regards was she peer of the  best lady in the land.\"    \"That will do.  Stand down.\"  He called up the competing lordling  again, and asked: \"What was the rank and condition of the  great-grandmother who conferred British nobility upon your  great house?\"    \"She was a king's leman and did climb to that splendid eminence  by her own unholpen merit from the sewer where she was born.\"    \"Ah, this, indeed, is true nobility, this is the right and perfect  intermixture.  The lieutenancy is yours, fair lord.  Hold it not in  contempt; it is the humble step which will lead to grandeurs more  worthy of the splendor of an origin like to thine.\"    I was down in the bottomless pit of humiliation.  I had promised  myself an easy and zenith-scouring triumph, and this was the outcome!    I was almost ashamed to look my poor disappointed cadet in the  face.  I told him to go home and be patient, this wasn't the end.    I had a private audience with the king, and made a proposition.  I said it was quite right to officer that regiment with nobilities,  and he couldn't have done a wiser thing.  It would also be a good  idea to add five hundred officers to it; in fact, add as many  officers as there were nobles and relatives of nobles in the  country, even if there should finally be five times as many officers  as privates in it; and thus make it the crack regiment, the envied  regiment, the King's Own regiment, and entitled to fight on its  own hook and in its own way, and go whither it would and come  when it pleased, in time of war, and be utterly swell and independent.  This would make that regiment the heart's desire of all the  nobility, and they would all be satisfied and happy.  Then we  would make up the rest of the standing army out of commonplace  materials, and officer it with nobodies, as was proper--nobodies  selected on a basis of mere efficiency--and we would make this  regiment toe the line, allow it no aristocratic freedom from  restraint, and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering,  to the end that whenever the King's Own was tired and wanted to go  off for a change and rummage around amongst ogres and have a good  time, it could go without uneasiness, knowing that matters were in  safe hands behind it, and business going to be continued at the  old stand, same as usual.  The king was charmed with the idea.    When I noticed that, it gave me a valuable notion.  I thought  I saw my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last.  You  see, the royalties of the Pendragon stock were a long-lived race  and very fruitful.  Whenever a child was born to any of these  --and it was pretty often--there was wild joy in the nation's mouth,  and piteous sorrow in the nation's heart.  The joy was questionable,  but the grief was honest.  Because the event meant another call  for a Royal Grant.  Long was the list of these royalties, and  they were a heavy and steadily increasing burden upon the treasury  and a menace to the crown.  Yet Arthur could not believe this  latter fact, and he would not listen to any of my various projects  for substituting something in the place of the royal grants.  If I  could have persuaded him to now and then provide a support for  one of these outlying scions from his own pocket, I could have  made a grand to-do over it, and it would have had a good effect  with the nation; but no, he wouldn't hear of such a thing.  He had  something like a religious passion for royal grant; he seemed to  look upon it as a sort of sacred swag, and one could not irritate  him in any way so quickly and so surely as by an attack upon that  venerable institution.  If I ventured to cautiously hint that there  was not another respectable family in England that would humble  itself to hold out the hat--however, that is as far as I ever got;  he always cut me short there, and peremptorily, too.    But I believed I saw my chance at last.  I would form this crack  regiment out of officers alone--not a single private.  Half of it  should consist of nobles, who should fill all the places up to  Major-General, and serve gratis and pay their own expenses; and  they would be glad to do this when they should learn that the rest  of the regiment would consist exclusively of princes of the blood.  These princes of the blood should range in rank from Lieutenant-General  up to Field Marshal, and be gorgeously salaried and equipped and  fed by the state.  Moreover--and this was the master stroke  --it should be decreed that these princely grandees should be always  addressed by a stunningly gaudy and awe-compelling"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7247"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 6. (#6)"],[1,"and spread it; then a sudden something  else betrayed itself in their faces, and they began to ask questions.  I answered the questions myself, and narrowly watched the effects  produced.  I was soon satisfied that the knowledge of who these  three prisoners were had somehow changed the atmosphere; that  our hosts' continued eagerness to go and spread the news was now  only pretended and not real.  The king did not notice the change,  and I was glad of that.  I worked the conversation around toward  other details of the night's proceedings, and noted that these  people were relieved to have it take that direction.    The painful thing observable about all this business was the  alacrity with which this oppressed community had turned their  cruel hands against their own class in the interest of the common  oppressor.  This man and woman seemed to feel that in a quarrel  between a person of their own class and his lord, it was the natural  and proper and rightful thing for that poor devil's whole caste  to side with the master and fight his battle for him, without ever  stopping to inquire into the rights or wrongs of the matter.  This  man had been out helping to hang his neighbors, and had done his  work with zeal, and yet was aware that there was nothing against  them but a mere suspicion, with nothing back of it describable  as evidence, still neither he nor his wife seemed to see anything  horrible about it.    This was depressing--to a man with the dream of a republic in his  head.  It reminded me of a time thirteen centuries away, when  the \"poor whites\" of our South who were always despised and  frequently insulted by the slave-lords around them, and who owed  their base condition simply to the presence of slavery in their  midst, were yet pusillanimously ready to side with the slave-lords  in all political moves for the upholding and perpetuating of  slavery, and did also finally shoulder their muskets and pour out  their lives in an effort to prevent the destruction of that very  institution which degraded them.  And there was only one redeeming  feature connected with that pitiful piece of history; and that was,  that secretly the \"poor white\" did detest the slave-lord, and did  feel his own shame.  That feeling was not brought to the surface,  but the fact that it was there and could have been brought out,  under favoring circumstances, was something--in fact, it was enough;  for it showed that a man is at bottom a man, after all, even if it  doesn't show on the outside.    Well, as it turned out, this charcoal burner was just the twin of  the Southern \"poor white\" of the far future.  The king presently  showed impatience, and said:    \"An ye prattle here all the day, justice will miscarry.  Think ye  the criminals will abide in their father's house?  They are fleeing,  they are not waiting.  You should look to it that a party of horse  be set upon their track.\"    The woman paled slightly, but quite perceptibly, and the man looked  flustered and irresolute.  I said:    \"Come, friend, I will walk a little way with you, and explain which  direction I think they would try to take.  If they were merely  resisters of the gabelle or some kindred absurdity I would try  to protect them from capture; but when men murder a person of  high degree and likewise burn his house, that is another matter.\"    The last remark was for the king--to quiet him.  On the road  the man pulled his resolution together, and began the march with  a steady gait, but there was no eagerness in it.  By and by I said:    \"What relation were these men to you--cousins?\"    He turned as white as his layer of charcoal would let him, and  stopped, trembling.    \"Ah, my God, how know ye that?\"    \"I didn't know it; it was a chance guess.\"    \"Poor lads, they are lost.  And good lads they were, too.\"    \"Were you actually going yonder to tell on them?\"    He didn't quite know how to take that; but he said, hesitatingly:    \"Ye-s.\"    \"Then I think you are a damned scoundrel!\"    It made him as glad as if I had called him an angel.    \"Say the good words again, brother! for surely ye mean that ye  would not betray me an I failed of my duty.\"    \"Duty?  There is no duty in the matter, except the duty to keep  still and let those men get away.  They've done a righteous deed.\"    He looked pleased; pleased, and touched with apprehension at the  same time.  He looked up and down the road to see that no one  was coming, and then said in a cautious voice:    \"From what land come you, brother, that you speak such perilous  words, and seem not to be afraid?\"    \"They are not perilous words when spoken to one of my own caste,  I take it.  You would not tell anybody I said them?\"    \"I?  I would be drawn asunder by wild horses first.\"    \"Well, then, let me say my say.  I have no fears of your repeating  it.  I think devil's work has been done last night upon those  innocent poor people.  That old baron got only what he deserved.  If I had my way, all his kind should have the same luck.\"    Fear and depression vanished from the man's manner, and gratefulness  and a brave animation took their place:    \"Even though you be a spy, and your words a trap for my undoing,  yet are they such refreshment that to hear them again and others  like to them, I would go to the gallows happy, as having had one  good feast at least in a starved life.  And I will say my say now,  and ye may report it if ye be so minded.  I helped to hang my  neighbors for that it were peril to my own life to show lack of  zeal in the master's cause; the others helped for none other reason.  All rejoice to-day that he is dead, but all do go about seemingly  sorrowing, and shedding the hypocrite's tear, for in that lies  safety.  I have said the words, I have said the words! the only  ones that have ever tasted good in my mouth, and the reward of  that taste is sufficient.  Lead on, an ye will, be it even to the  scaffold, for I am ready.\"    There it was, you see.  A man is a man, at bottom.  Whole ages  of abuse and oppression cannot crush the manhood clear out of him.  Whoever thinks it a mistake is himself mistaken.  Yes, there is  plenty good enough material for a republic in the most degraded  people that ever existed--even the Russians; plenty of manhood  in them--even in the Germans--if one could but force it out of  its timid and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the  mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever  supported it.  We should see certain things yet, let us hope and  believe.  First, a modified monarchy, till Arthur's days were done,  then the destruction of the throne, nobility abolished, every  member of it bound out to some useful trade, universal suffrage  instituted, and the whole government placed in the hands of the  men and women of the nation there to remain.  Yes, there was no  occasion to give up my dream yet a while.        CHAPTER XXXI    MARCO    We strolled along in a sufficiently indolent fashion now, and  talked.  We must dispose of about the amount of time it ought  to take to go to the little hamlet of Abblasoure and put justice  on the track of those murderers and get back home again.  And  meantime I had an auxiliary interest which had never paled yet,  never lost its novelty for me since I had been in Arthur's kingdom:  the behavior--born of nice and exact subdivisions of caste--of chance  passers-by toward each other.  Toward the shaven monk who trudged  along with his cowl tilted back and the sweat washing down his  fat jowls, the coal-burner was deeply reverent; to the gentleman  he was abject; with the small farmer and the free mechanic he was  cordial and gossipy; and when a slave passed by with a countenance  respectfully lowered, this chap's nose was in the air--he couldn't  even see him.  Well, there are times when one would like to hang  the whole human race and finish the farce.    Presently we struck an incident.  A small mob of half-naked boys  and girls came tearing out of the woods, scared and shrieking.  The eldest among them were not more than twelve or fourteen years  old.  They implored help, but they were so beside themselves that  we couldn't make out what the matter was.  However, we plunged  into the wood, they skurrying in the lead, and the trouble was  quickly revealed: they had hanged a little fellow with a bark rope,  and he was kicking and struggling, in the process of choking to  death.  We rescued him, and fetched him around.  It was some more  human nature; the admiring little folk imitating their elders;  they were playing mob, and had achieved a success which promised  to be a good deal more serious than they had bargained for.    It was not a dull excursion for me.  I managed to put in the time  very well.  I made various acquaintanceships, and in my quality  of stranger was able to ask as many questions as I wanted to.  A thing which naturally interested me, as a statesman, was the  matter of wages.  I picked up what I could under that head during  the afternoon.  A man who hasn't had much experience, and doesn't  think, is apt to measure a nation's prosperity or lack of prosperity  by the mere size of the prevailing wages; if the wages be high, the  nation is prosperous; if low, it isn't.  Which is an error.  It  isn't what sum you get, it's how much you can buy with it, that's  the important thing; and it's that that tells whether your wages  are high in fact or only high in name.  I could remember how it  was in the time of our great civil war in the nineteenth century.  In the North a carpenter got three dollars a day, gold valuation;  in the South he got fifty--payable in Confederate shinplasters  worth a dollar a bushel.  In the North a suit of overalls cost  three dollars--a day's wages; in the South it cost seventy-five  --which was two days' wages.  Other things were in proportion.  Consequently, wages were twice as high in the North as they were  in the South, because "]]]
