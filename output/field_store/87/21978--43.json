The pumpkin makes an excellent substitute for  the apple in a pie, when soured and sweetened to a proper temper by  lemons and sugar. The black children absolutely dance and scream when  they see one, pumpkin and sugar being their delight. To the half of a  shrivelled pumpkin hanging at the door of my tent on my first essay in  settling, one of our sooty satyrs could do nothing for some minutes but  fidget and skip; and with his eyes sparkling, and countenance beaming  with ecstacy, exclaim, \"Dam my eye, _pambucan_; dam my eye, _pambucan_!\"  such being the nearest point they can attain to the right pronunciation  of their favourite _fruit_.    _Birds_.--We are not moved here with the deep mellow note of the  blackbird, poured out from beneath some low stunted bush; nor thrilled  with the wild warblings of the thrush, perched on the top of some tall  sapling; nor charmed with the blithe carol of the lark as we proceed  early afield; none of our birds at all rivalling these divine songsters  in realising the poetical idea of the \"music of the grove;\" while  \"parrots' chattering\" must supply the place of \"nightingales' singing\"  in the future amorous lays of our sighing Celadons. We have our lark  certainly, but both his appearance and note are a most wretched parody  upon the bird our English poets have made so many fine similes about.  He will mount from the ground, and rise fluttering upward in the same  manner, and with a few of the starting notes of the English lark; but  on reaching the height of thirty feet or so, down he drops suddenly and  mutely, diving into concealment among the long grass, as if ashamed of  his pitiful attempt. For the pert, frisky robin, pattering and pecking  against the windows in the dull days of winter, we have the lively  \"superb warbler,\" with his blue shining plumage and his long tapering  tail, picking up the crumbs at our doors; while the pretty little  redbills, of the size and form of the goldfinch, constitute the sparrow  of our clime, flying in flocks about our houses, and building their soft  downy pigmy nests in the orange, peach, and lemon trees surrounding  them. Nor are we without our rural noters of the time, to call us to  our early task, and warn us of evening's close. The loud and discordant  noise of the _laughing jackass_, (or _settler's clock_, as he is  called,) as he takes up his roost on the withered bough of one of our  tallest trees, acquaints us that the sun has just dipped behind the  hills, and that it is time to trudge homewards; while the plaintive  notes of the curlew, and the wild and dismal screechings of the flying  squirrel, skimming from branch to branch, whisper us to retire to our  bedchambers. In the morning, again, the dull monotonous double note of  the _whee-whee_, (so named from the sound of its calls,) chiming in at  as regular intervals as the tick of a clock, warns us to rub our eyes  and con over the tasks of the impending day, as it is but half an hour  to dawn; till again the loud laughter of the _jackass_ summons us to  turn out, and take a peep at the appearance of the morning, which just  begins to glimmer beyond the dusky outline of the eastern hills.    _Animals_.--Our wild animals are numerous, but few of them carnivorous,  and none of a size to endanger human life. The _native dog_ is generally  believed to be an importation, being deficient of the false uterus or  pouch characterising all our other quadrupeds. He closely resembles the  Chinese dog in form and appearance, being either of a reddish or dark  colour, with shaggy hair, long bushy tail, prick ears, large head, and  slightly tapering nose; in size he reminds one of a shepherd's dog,  running with considerable speed, and snapping in attack or defence. He  does not bark, but howls in melancholy sort, when prowling in quest of  prey, and has a strong and peculiar odour, which makes European dogs shy  at first of attacking him, doubtless intimidated too by his snapping  mode of fighting; for it is observed of poodles, and all which snap,  that few other dogs are fond of engaging them. He is most destructive on  breaking in among a flock of sheep, as he bites a piece out of every one  he seizes; not holding fast and worrying dead like the fox, but snapping  at all he can overtake, till twenty or thirty may be killed by one dog,  there being something so peculiarly venomous in their bite that few  recover from it. Their cross with the tame dog forms a very useful breed  for emu-hunting, and many even of the pure ones are caught young, tamed  by the natives, and bred up to hunt emus and kangaroos. They have as  many pups as the tame dog, littering either in some hollow log, deserted  ant-hill, hole in the ground, or thick brush. They will hunt, kill, and  devour a tame dog also, if a troop of them can catch him alone. A  settler in the interior informed me, that, while out hunting one  morning, he observed his dog running direct towards him at full speed,  with two large native dogs close at his heels; and so eager were they to  seize their prey, that his own dog was actually sheltered between his  legs, and the native dogs within pistol-shot, before they perceived  their danger. Hence he was enabled to shoot one of them. The native cat  is the only other carnivorous animal we possess; but its depredations  extend no farther than the poultry-yard. It is small and long-bodied,  with a long tail, claws like a common cat, a nose like a pig, striped  down the sides with brown and black, and dotted over with white spots.  It climbs trees and preys on birds while they sleep, being a night  animal.           *       *       *       *       *      FARM-HOUSES ON THE SNEEUWBERG MOUNTAINS.      The farm-houses in the Sneeuwberg, and in most of the colder districts  of the colony, are usually of the following description:--The house  resembles a large barn divided into two or three apartments. One of these  is the kitchen, which also serves for the sitting and eating apartment.  In the others the family sleep; while, in the outer one already  mentioned, visiters and travellers are accommodated with a rush mat, a  feather bed, and a coverlet spread on the clay floor. In this situation  I have often enjoyed, after a fatiguing day's ride, the most balmy  repose; while a swarthy train of slaves and Hottentots were moving round  the embers of the fire, wrapped in their sheepskin mantles, and dogs,  cats, and fowls were trampling over my body. The more wealthy and long  settled families, however, usually have the kitchen separate from their  sitting-room. In such houses curtained beds, and other articles of  decent furniture, are not unfrequently found; but the poorer classes  are content with a few thong-bottomed chairs and stools, two or three  wagon-chests, and a couple of deal tables. At one of the latter sits  the mistress of the house, with a tea-urn and a chafing-dish before her,  dealing out every now and then _tea-water_, or coffee, and elevating  her sharp shrill voice occasionally to keep the dilatory slaves and  Hottentots at their duty. In this same apartment is also invariably to  be seen the carcass of a sheep killed in the morning, and hung up under  the eye of the mistress, to be served out frugally for the day's  provision as it may be required. The houses, being without any ceiling,  are open to the thatch; and the rafters are generally hung full of the  ears of Indian corn, leaves or rolls of tobacco, slices of dried meat,  called _bill tongue_, &c. The last is a sort of ham from the muscular  part of the thigh of the ox, or the larger species of antelopes; it is  very convenient for carrying on journeys, and is found in the boor's  houses in every part of the colony. It is cut into very thin slices, and  eaten with bread and butter, or with bread and the melted fat of the  sheep's tail, which is a common substitute for butter; either way it is  no contemptible dish when one is a little hungry, and many a time I have  heartily enjoyed it.    A traveller, on arriving, if it does not happen to be meal-time, is  always presented with a cup of tea, without sugar, milk, or bread;  unless occasionally, when you may be favoured with a small piece of  sugar-candy out of a tin snuff-box, to be kept in your mouth to sweeten  the bitter beverage as it passes. When their tea and coffee are  exhausted, a succedaneum is found in roasted grain, prepared in the  same way as Hunt's radical coffee, which, if not very palatable, is  nevertheless a refreshment to a thirsty and weary traveller. They never  think of asking you to eat unless at meal-time; but then you are  expected to draw in your chair, and help yourself, without invitation,  in the same easy manner as one of the family. The dishes consist for  the most part of mutton stewed in sheep's-tail fat, or boiled to rags;  sometimes with very palatable soup, and a dish of boiled corn, maize, or  pumpkin. Cayenne-pepper, vinegar, and few home-made pickles, are also  usually produced to relish the simple fare, which, served up twice a  day, forms, with tea-water and the _soopie_, or dram of Cape brandy,  the amount of their luxuries. In this quarter of the colony, however, I  found every where excellent bread; and, upon the whole, the farmers of  Bruintjes-Hoogte and the Sneeuwberg appeared in much more independent  and comfortable circumstances than those along the coast.    _Thompson's Southern Africa._           *       *       *       *       *      HOSPITAL FOR THE DUMB.      The Banian hospital at Surat is a most remarkable institution; it  consists of a large plot of ground, enclosed with high walls, divided  into several courts or wards, for the accommodation of animals; in  sickness they are attended with the tenderest care, and find a peaceful  asylum for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11405"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Larry himself) was awestruck with the company in which he  so unexpectedly found himself; and trembled all over when, on the notice  of his guide, the eight-and-forty eyes of stone were turned directly upon  himself. \"You have just nicked the night to a shaving, Larry,\" said St.  Patrick: \"this is our chapter-night, and myself and brethren are here  'assembled on merry occasion.'--You know who I am?\" \"God bless your  reverence,\" said Larry, \"it's I that do well. Often did I see your  picture hanging over the door of places where it is\"--lowering his  voice--\"pleasanter to be than here, buried under an ould church.\" \"You  may as well say it out, Larry,\" said St. Patrick; \"and don't think I'm  going to be angry with you about it; for I was once flesh and blood  myself. But you remember, the other night, saying that you would think  nothing of pulling your master out of purgatory, if you could get at him  there, and appealing to me to stand by your words.    \"Y-e-e-s,\" said Larry, most mournfully; for he recollected the  significant look he had received from the picture. \"And,\" continued St.  Patrick, \"you remember also that I gave you a wink, which you know is as  good, any day, as a nod--at least, to a blind horse.\" \"I'm sure, your  reverence,\" said Larry, with a beating heart, \"is too much of a gintleman  to hould a poor man hard to every word he may say of an evening, and  therefore\"--\"I was thinking so,\" said the saint, \"I guessed you'd prove a  poltroon when put to the push. What do you think, my brethren, I should  do to this fellow?\" A hollow sound burst from the bosoms of the unanimous  assembly. The verdict was short and decisive:--\"Knock out his brains!\" And  in order to suit the action to the word, the whole four-and-twenty arose  at once, and with their immovable eyes fixed firmly on the face of our  hero--who horror struck with the sight as he was, could not close  his--they began to glide slowly but regularly towards him, bending their  line into the form of a crescent, so as to environ him on all sides. In  vain he fled to the door; its massive folds resisted mortal might. In  vain he cast his eyes around in quest of a loophole of retreat--there was  none. Closer and closer pressed on the slowly-moving phalanx, and the  uplifted croziers threatened soon to put their sentence into execution.  Supplication was all that remained--and Larry sunk upon his knees. \"Ah!  then,\" said he, \"gintlemin and ancient ould saints as you are, don't kill  the father of a large small family, who never did hurt to you or yours.  Sure, if 'tis your will that I should go to--no matter who, for there's  no use in naming his name--might I not as well make up my mind to go  there, alive and well, stout and hearty, and able to face him,--as with  my head knocked into bits, as if I had been after a fair or a patthern?\"  \"You say right,\" said St. Patrick, checking with a motion of his crozier  the advancing assailants, who returned to their seats. \"I am glad to see  you coming to reason. Prepare for your journey.\" \"And how, plase your  Saintship, am I to go?\" asked Larry. \"Why,\" said St. Patrick, \"as Colman  here has guided you so far, he may guide you further. But as the journey  is into foreign parts, where you arn't likely to be known, you had better  take this letter of introduction, which may be of use to you.\" \"And here,  also, Lawrence,\" said a Dublin Saint--perhaps Michan--\"take you this box  also, and make use of it as he to whom you speak shall suggest.\" \"Take a  hold, and a firm one,\" said St. Colman, \"Lawrence, of my cassock, and we'  ll start.\" \"All right behind?\" cried St. Patrick. \"All right!\" was the  reply. In an instant!--vault--table--saints--bell--church, faded into air;  a rustling hiss of wings was all that was heard; and Larry felt his cheek  swept by a current, as if a covey of birds of enormous size were passing  him. (It was, in all probability, the flight of the saints returning to  heaven, but on that point nothing certain has reached us up to the  present time of writing.) He had not a long time to wonder at the  phenomenon, for he himself soon began to soar, dangling in mid sky at the  skirt of the cassock of his sainted guide. Earth, and all that appertains  thereto, speedily passed from his eyes, and they were alone in the midst  of circumfused ether, glowing with a sunless light. Above, in immense  distance, was fixed the firmament, fastened up with bright stars, fencing  around the world with its azure wall. They fled far, before any  distinguishable object met their eyes. At length a long, white streak,  shining like silver in the moonbeam, was visible to their sight. \"That,\"  said St. Colman, \"is the Limbo which adjoins the earth, and is the  highway for ghosts departing the world. It is called in Milton, a book  which I suppose, Larry, you never have read\"--\"And how could I, plase  your worship,\" said Larry, \"seein' I don't know a B from a bull's foot!\"  \"Well, it is called in Milton the Paradise of Fools: and if it were indeed  peopled by all of that tribe who leave the world, it would contain the  best company that ever figured on the earth. To the north, you see a  bright speck?\" \"I do.\" \"That marks the upward path,--narrow and hard to  find. To the south you may see a darksome road--broad, smooth, and easy  of descent; that is the lower way. It is thronged with the great ones of  the world; you may see their figures in the gloom. Those who are soaring  upwards are wrapt in the flood of light flowing perpetually from that  single spot, and you cannot see them. The silver path on which we enter  is the Limbo. Here I part with you. You are to give your letter to the  first person you meet. Do your best;--be courageous, but observe  particularly that you profane no holy name, or I will not answer for the  consequences.\"    His guide had scarcely vanished, when Larry heard the tinkling of a bell  in the distance, and turning his eyes in the quarter whence it proceeded,  he saw a grave-looking man in black, with eyes of fire, driving before  him a flock of ghosts with a switch, as you see turkeys driven on the  western road, at the approach of Christmas. They were on the highway to  Purgatory. The ghosts were shivering in the thin air, which pinched them  severely, now that they had lost the covering of their bodies. Among the  group, Larry recognised his old master, by the same means that Ulysses,  Aeneas, and others, recognised the bodiless forms of their friends in the  regions of Acheron. \"What brings a living person,\" said the man in black,  \"on this pathway? I shall make legal capture of you, Larry Sweeney, for  trespassing. You have no business here.\" \"I have come,\" said Larry,  plucking up courage, \"to bring your honour's glory a letter from a  company of gintlemin with whom I had the pleasure of spending the evening,  underneath the ould church of Inistubber.\" \"A letter,\" said the man in  black, \"where is it?\" \"Here, my lord,\" said Larry. \"Ho!\" cried the black  gentleman, on opening it, \"I know the handwriting. It won't do, however,  my lad,--I see they want to throw dust in my eyes.\" \"Whew,\" thought Larry,  \"that's the very thing. 'Tis for that the ould Dublin boy gave me the box.  I'd lay a tinpenny to a brass farthing that it's filled with Lundy Foot.\"  Opening the box, therefore, he flung its contents right into the fiery  eyes of the man in black, while he was still occupied with reading the  letter,--and the experiment was successful. \"Curses--tche-tche-tche,--  Curses on it,\" exclaimed he, clapping his hand before his eyes, and  sneezing most lustily.--\"Run, you villians, run,\" cried Larry, to the  ghosts--\"run, you villians, now that his eyes are off of you--O master,  master! Sir Theodore, jewel! run to the right-hand side, make for the  bright speck, and God give you luck.\"    He had forgotten his injunction. The moment the word was uttered he felt  the silvery ground sliding from under him; and with the swiftness of  thought he found himself on the flat of his back, under the very niche of  the old church wall whence he had started, dizzy and confused with a  measureless tumble. The emancipated ghosts floated in all directions,  emitting their shrill and stridulous cries in the gleaming expanse. Some  were again gathered by their old conductor; some scudding about at  random, took the right hand path, others the left. Into which of them Sir  Theodore struck, is not recorded; but as he had heard the direction, let  us hope that he made the proper choice. Larry had not much time given him  to recover from his fall, for almost in an instant he heard an angry  snorting rapidly approaching, and looking up, whom should he see but the  gentleman in black, with eyes gleaming more furiously than ever, and his  horns (for, in his haste, he had let his hat fall) relieved in strong  shadow against the moon. Up started Larry--away ran his pursuer after him.  The safest refuge was, of course, the church,--thither ran our hero--and  after him--fiercer than the shark, swifter than the hounds--fled the  black gentleman. The church is cleared; the chancel entered; and the hot  breath of his pursuer glows upon the outstretched neck of Larry. Escape  is impossible--the extended talons of the fiend have clutched him by the  hair. \"You are mine,\" cried the demon,--\"if I have lost any of my flock,  I have at last got you.\" \"Oh, St. Patrick!\" exclaimed our hero, in horror,  --\"Oh, St. Patrick have mercy upon me, and save me!\" \"I tell you what,  cousin Larry,\" said Kinaley, chucking him up from behind a gravestone,  where he had fallen--\"all the St. Patricks that ever were born would not  have saved you from ould Tom Picton, if he caught you sleeping on your  post as I've caught you now. By the word of an ould soldier, he'd have  had the provost-marshal upon you, and I'd not give two-pence for the loan  of your life. And then, too,"]]]
