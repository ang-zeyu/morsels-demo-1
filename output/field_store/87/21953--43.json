There are many  aspects of it which it is not possible for me to go into, as, for  example, some of its Military aspects. I repeat my doubt whether there  is any question more commanding at this moment, and for many a day to  come, than the one which I am impressing upon you to-night. Is all  that is called unrest in India mere froth? Or is it a deep rolling  flood? Is it the result of natural order and wholesome growth in  this vast community? Is it natural effervescence, or is it deadly  fermentation? Is India with all its heterogeneous populations--is it  moving slowly and steadily to new and undreamt of unity? It is the  vagueness of the discontent, which is not universal--it is the  vagueness that makes it harder to understand, harder to deal with.  Some of them are angry with me. Why? Because I have not been able to  give them the moon. I have got no moon, and if I had I would not part  with it. I will give the moon, when I know who lives there, and what  kind of conditions prevail there.    I want, if I may, to make a little literary digression. Much of this  movement arises from the fact that there is now a large body  of educated Indians who have been fed, at our example and our  instigation, upon some of the great teachers and masters of this  country, Milton, Burke, Macaulay, Mill, and Spencer. Surely it is a  mistake in us not to realise that these masters should have mighty  force and irresistible influence. Who can be surprised that educated  Indians who read those high masters and teachers of ours, are  intoxicated with the ideas of freedom, nationality, self-government,  that breathes the breath of life in those inspiring and illuminating  pages. Who of us that had the privilege in the days of our youth, at  college or at home, of turning over those golden chapters, and seeing  that lustrous firmament dawn over our youthful imaginations--who of us  can forget, shall I call it the intoxication and rapture, with which  we strove to make friends with truth, knowledge, beauty, freedom? Then  why should we be surprised that young Indians feel the same movement  of mind, when they are made free of our own immortals. I would only  say this to my idealist friends, whether Indian or European, that for  every passage that they can find in Mill, or Burke, or Macaulay,  or, any other of our lofty sages with their noble hearts and potent  brains, I will find them a dozen passages in which history is shown to  admonish us, in the language of Burke--\"How weary a step do those  take who endeavour to make out of a great mass a true political  personality!\" They are words much to be commended to those zealots  in India--how many a weary step has to be taken before they can form  themselves into a mass that has a true political personality! My  warning may be wasted, but anybody who has a chance ought to try to  appeal to the better, the riper, mind of educated India. Time has gone  on with me, experience has widened. I have never lost my invincible  faith that there is a better mind in all civilised communities--and  that this better mind, if you can reach it, if statesmen in time to  come can reach that better mind, can awaken it, can evoke it, can  induce it to apply itself to practical purposes for the improvement  of the conditions of such a community, they will earn the crown of  beneficent fame indeed. Nothing strikes me much more than this, when  I talk of the better mind of India--there are subtle elements,  religious, spiritual, mystical, traditional, historical in what we may  call for the moment the Indian mind, which are very hard for the most  candid and patient to grasp or to realise in their full force. But our  duty, and it is a splendid duty, is to try. I always remember a little  passage in the life of a great Anglo-Indian, Sir Henry Lawrence, a  very simple passage, and it is this, \"No one ever ate at Sir Henry  Lawrence's table without learning to think more kindly of the  natives.\" I wish I could know that at every Anglo-Indian table to-day,  nobody has sat down without leaving it having learned to think a  little more kindly of the natives. One more word on this point. Bad  manners, overbearing manners are disagreeable in all countries: India  is the only country where bad and overbearing manners are a political  crime.    The Government have been obliged to take measures of repression; they  may be obliged to take more. But we have not contented ourselves with  measures of repression. Those of you who have followed Indian matters  at all during the last two or three months are aware there is a reform  scheme, a scheme to give the Indians chances of coming more closely  and responsibly into a share of the Government of their country. The  Government of India issued certain proposals expressly marked as  provisional and tentative. There was no secret hatching of a new  Constitution. Their circular was sent about to obtain an expression  of Indian opinion, official and non-official. Plenty of time has been  given, and is to be given, for an examination and discussion of these  proposals. We shall not be called upon to give an official decision  until spring next year, and I shall not personally be called upon for  a decision before the middle of next Session. One step we have taken  to which I attach the greatest importance. Two Indians have for the  first time been appointed to be members of the Council of India  sitting at Whitehall. I appointed these two gentlemen, not only to  advise the Secretary of State in Council, not only to help to keep him  in touch with Indian opinion and Indian interests, but as a marked  and conspicuous proof on the highest scale, by placing them on this  important and ruling body, that we no longer mean to keep Indians at  arm's length or shut the door of the Council Chamber of the paramount  power against them. Let me press this important point upon you.    The root of the unrest, discontent, and sedition, so far as I can make  out after constant communication with those who have better chances of  knowing the problem at first hand, than I could have had--the root of  the matter is racial and social not political. That being so, it is  of a kind that is the very hardest to reach. You can reach political  sentiment. This goes deeper. Racial dislike is a dislike not of  political domination, but of racial domination; and my object in  making that conspicuous change in the constitution of the Council  of India which advises the Secretary of State for India, was to do  something, and if rightly understood and interpreted to do a great  deal, to teach all English officers and governors in India, from the  youngest Competition wallah who arrives there, that in the eyes of the  ruling Government at home, the Indian is perfectly worthy of a place,  be it small or great, in the counsels of those who make and carry on  the laws and the administration of the community to which he belongs.  We stand by this position not in words alone; we have shown it in act  and shall show it further.    There is one more difficulty--there are two difficulties--and I must  ask you for a couple of minutes. I only need name them--famine and  plague. At this moment, when you have thought and argued out all  these political things, the Government of India still remains a grim  business. If there are no rains this month, the spectre of famine  seems to be approaching, and nobody can blame us for that. Nobody  expects the Viceroy and the Secretary of State to play the part of  Elijah on Mount Carmel, who prayed and saw a little cloud like a man's  hand, until the heavens became black with winds and cloud, and there  was a great rain. That is beyond the reach of Government. All we can  say is that never before was the Government in all its branches and  members found more ready than it is now, to do the very best to face  the prospect. Large suspensions of revenue and rent will be granted,  allowances will be made to distressed cultivators. No stone will be  left unturned. The plague figures are terrible enough. At this season  plague mortality is generally quiescent; but this year, even if the  last three months of it show no rise, the plague mortality will still  be the worst that has ever been known, I think, in India's recorded  annals. Pestilence during the last nine months has stalked through  the land, wasting her cities and villages, uncontrolled and  uncontrollable, so far as we can tell, by human forethought or care.  When I read some of these figures in the House of Commons, a few  perturbed cries of \"Shame\" accompanied them. These cries came from the  natural sympathy, horror, amazement, and commiseration, with which we  all listen to such ghastly stories. The shame does not lie with the  Government. If you see anything in your newspapers about these plague  figures, remember that they are not like an epidemic here. In trying  to remedy plague, you have to encounter the habits and prejudices of  hundreds of years. Suppose you find plague is conveyed by a flea upon  a rat, and suppose you are dealing with a population who object to  the taking away of life. You see for yourselves the difficulty? The  Government of India have applied themselves with great energy, with  fresh activity, and they believe they have got the secret of this fell  disaster. They have laid down a large policy of medical, sanitary, and  financial aid. I am a hardened niggard of public money. I watch the  expenditure of Indian revenue as the ferocious dragon of the old  mythology watched the golden apples. I do not forget that I come  from a constituency which, so far as I have known it, if it is most  generous, is also most prudent. Nevertheless, though I have to be  thrifty, almost parsimonious, upon this matter, the Council of India  and myself will, I am sure, not stint or grudge. I can only say, in  conclusion, that I think"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10985"],[0,"The Infant System (#7)"],[1,"if there be many offenders, despite of these  institutions, there would, doubtless, be many more were they not in  existence; and hence to revile or neglect them is unworthy of good  sense or good feeling.    It is not my purpose in the present chapter to dwell on the commission  of crime generally, but on juvenile delinquency in particular; and  on this only so far as regards the case of young children. I will,  therefore, make public a collection of facts, some of which were  obtained at considerable personal hazard and inconvenience, which will  place it in a clear yet painful light.    It is said, that in the year 1819, the number of boys, in London  alone, who procured a considerable part of their subsistence by  pocket-picking and thieving in every possible form, was estimated at  from eleven to fifteen hundred. One man who lived in Wentworth-Street,  near Spitalfields, had forty boys in training to steal and pick  pockets, who were paid for their exertions with a part of the plunder;  fortunately, however, for the public, this notable tutor of thieves  was himself convicted of theft, and transported. This system of  tutorage is by no means uncommon, nor is it confined to the male sex.  I remember reading some time back, in the police reports, of a woman  who had entrapped _eight or ten children_ from their parents, had  trained them up, and sent them out thieving; nor was it until one of  these infantile depredators was taken in the act of stealing, that  this was made known, and the children restored to their homes. Here we  see eight or ten children, probably from the neglect of their parents,  enticed away, no doubt by the promise of a few cakes, or of some other  trifling reward, and in imminent danger of becoming confirmed thieves,  from which they were rescued by this providential discovery of their  situation; and we know not how many children may have been led to evil  practices in like manner.    I will give another instance which occurred at the office at Queen  Square.--A female, apparently no more than nineteen years of age,  named Jane Smith, and a child just turned of five years old, named  Mary Ann Ranniford, were put to the bar, before Edward Markland,  Esq., the magistrate, charged with circulating counterfeit coin in  Westminster and the county of Surrey, to a vast extent.    It appeared that the elder prisoner had long been known to be a common  utterer of base coin, in which she dealt very largely with those  individuals who are agents in London to the manufacturers of the  spurious commodity in Birmingham. She had been once or twice before  charged with the offence, and therefore she became so notorious that  she was necessitated to leave off putting the bad money away herself;  but so determined was she to keep up the traffic, that she was in the  habit of employing children of tender years to pass the counterfeit  money. On one occasion two Bow Street officers observed her at her old  trade, in company with the child Ranniford. The officers kept a strict  eye upon her movements, and saw her several times pass something to  the little girl; and she, by the direction of her instructor, went  into different shops (such as hosiers, where she purchased balls of  worsted, pastry-cooks, tobacconists, and fruiterers), where she passed  the bad money, and received in return goods and change. On the other  side of the bridge, the patroles saw the prisoner Smith deliver  something to the child, and point out the shop of Mr. Isaacs, a  fruiterer, in Bridge Street, Westminster. The child went in, and asked  for a juicy lemon, and gave a counterfeit shilling in payment. Mrs.  Isaacs had no suspicion from the tender age of the utterer, and its  respectable appearance, that the money was bad, and was about to give  change, when one of the officers entered, and took the deluded child  into custody, whilst his companion secured the elder prisoner (Smith),  and on searching her pockets he found twelve bad shillings, some  parcels of snuff, several balls of cotton and worsted, and other  trifling articles, which the child had purchased in the course of the  day. The officers who had secured them, learned from the child that  her parents lived in Cross Street, East Lane, Walworth, and that Smith  had taken her out for a walk. The patrol instantly communicated the  circumstance to the child's parents, who were hard-working honest  people, and their feelings on hearing that their infant had been  seduced into the commission of such a crime, can be more easily  conceived than described. They stated that the woman Smith had  formerly lived in the same street, and was frequently giving  half-pence and cakes to the child, who would, in consequence, follow  her anywhere. Some time since, she removed to Lock's Square, Lock's  Fields, and they (the parents) had not seen her for some time. On the  day referred to the child was playing in the street, and not finding  her come home they became alarmed, and went everywhere, broken  hearted, in quest of her, but they could hear no tidings of her till  the sad news was brought them by the officers. The poor mother was now  in attendance, and her feelings were dreadfully affected, and excited  the commiseration of all present.    The prisoner Smith made no defence, and held her head down during  the examination. The child stood by her, and took no notice of the  proceedings, and they were both fully committed for trial. The mother,  on seeing her infant consigned to prison, became quite frantic, and  wept hysterically, and had it it not been for the gaoler, she would  have inflicted some violence upon the woman Smith, for seducing her  infant.    Facts of this kind are sufficient to shew the utility, indeed I may  say, the most absolute necessity of providing some means, far, very  far more efficient than those at present in existence, for the  protection and improvement of the infant poor; that they may not thus  fall into the hands of evil and designing wretches, who make a living  by encouraging the children of the poor to commit crimes, of the  produce of which they themselves take the greatest part.    The younger the children are, the better they suit the purposes of  such miscreants; because, if children are detected in any dishonest  act, they know well, that few persons will do more than give the child  or children a tap on the head, and send them about their business. The  tenth part of the crimes committed by these juvenile offenders never  comes under public view, because should any person be robbed by a  child, and detect him in the act, he is silenced by the by-standers  with this remark,--Oh! he is but a child, let him go this time,  perhaps the poor thing has done it from necessity, being in want of  bread. Thus the delinquent is almost sure to escape, and, instead of  being punished, is not unfrequently rewarded for the adventure, as was  the case in the following instance.    Having had occasion to walk through Shoreditch some time since, I saw  a number of persons collected together round a little boy, who, it  appeared, had stolen a brass weight from the shop of a grocer. The  shopman stated that three boys came into the shop for half-an-ounce of  candied horehound, and that while he was getting down the glass which  contained it, one of them contrived to purloin the weight in question.  Having some suspicion of the boys, from the circumstance of having  recently lost a number of brass weights, he kept his eyes on them,  when he saw one put his hand into a box that was on the counter, take  out the largest weight, and then run out of the shop, followed by the  other two. The boy who stole it, slipped the weight into the hand of  one of the others; but the shopman, having observed this manoeuvre,  followed the boy who had the weight, who, being the youngest of the  three, could not run very fast; he, finding himself closely pursued,  threw the weight into the road, and when he was taken, declared that  it was not he who took it. The man wished to take the child back to  the shop, in order that his master might do with him as he thought  proper, but the by-standers, with a charitable _zeal_ which evinced  little _knowledge_, prevented him; one man in particular seemed to  interest himself much in the boy's behalf, stating that he knew the  child very well, and that he had neither father nor mother. The child  immediately took up this plea, and added that he had had no victuals  all day. The individual before mentioned then gave him a penny, and  his example was followed by many more, till I think the boy had  obtained nearly a shilling. I put several questions to him, but was  checked by this fellow, who told me, that as I had given the child  nothing, I had no right to ask so much? and, after a great deal of  abuse, he ended by telling me, that if I did not \"take myself off\" he  would \"give me something for myself.\"    Feeling, however, a great desire to sift further into the matter, I  feigned to withdraw, but kept my eye upon the boy, and followed him  for nearly two hours, until I saw him join two other boys, one of whom  I had not seen before, and who had a bag with something very heavy in  it, which, I have every reason to believe, were weights, or something  which they had obtained in a similar manner. Wishing to ascertain the  fact, I approached them, but they no sooner perceived me, than the  little fellow who had been the principal actor in the affair, called  out \"_Nose, Nose_,\"--a signal-word, no doubt, agreed upon amongst  them,--when they all ran down some obscure alleys. I followed, but  was knocked down, as if by accident, by two ill-looking fellows, who  continued to detain me with apologies till the boys had got safely  away. I have little doubt that this was an instance of that organized  system of depredation of which I have before spoken, and that the  man who took so active a part at the first, was at the bottom of  the"]]]
