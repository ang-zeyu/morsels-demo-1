He was described by  Sir Wilfrid Laurier at a dinner of the Canadian Club of New York, at the  Hotel Astor last year, as \"beyond question the greatest railroad genius  in Canada, as an executive genius ranking second only to the late Edward  H. Harriman.\" He was returning aboard the Titanic with his wife and  son-in-law and daughter; Mr. and Mrs. Thornton Davidson, of Montreal.        CHAPTER V. THE TITANIC STRIKES AN ICEBERG!    TARDY ATTENTION TO WARNING RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCIDENT--THE DANGER NOT  REALIZED AT FIRST--AN INTERRUPTED CARD GAME--PASSENGERS JOKE AMONG  THEMSELVES--THE REAL TRUTH DAWNS--PANIC ON BOARD--WIRELESS CALLS FOR  HELP    SUNDAY night the magnificent ocean liner was plunging through a  comparatively placid sea, on the surface of which there was much mushy  ice and here and there a number of comparatively harmless-looking floes.  The night was clear and stars visible. First Officer William T. Murdock  was in charge of the bridge The first intimation of the presence of the  iceberg that he received was from the lookout in the crow's nest.    Three warnings were transmitted from the crow's nest of the Titanic  to the officer on the doomed steamship's bridge 15 minutes before she  struck, according to Thomas Whiteley, a first saloon steward.    Whiteley, who was whipped overboard from the ship by a rope while  helping to lower a life-boat, finally reported on the Carpathia aboard  one of the boats that contained, he said, both the crow's nest lookouts.  He heard a conversation between them, he asserted, in which they  discussed the warnings given to the Titanic's bridge of the presence of  the iceberg.    Whiteley did not know the names of either of the lookout men and  believed that they returned to England with the majority of the  surviving members of the crew.      {illust. caption = A GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATION OF THE FORCE WITH WHICH A  VESSEL STRIKES AN ICEBERG}        \"I heard one of them say that at 11.15 o'clock, 15 minutes before the  Titanic struck, he had reported to First Officer Murdock, on the bridge,  that he fancied he saw an iceberg!\" said Whiteley. \"Twice after that,  the lookout said, he warned Murdock that a berg was ahead. They were  very indignant that no attention was paid to their warnings.\"    TARDY ATTENTION TO WARNING RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCIDENT    Murdock's tardy answering of a telephone call from the crow's nest is  assigned by Whiteley as the cause of the disaster.    When Murdock answered the call he received the information that the  iceberg was due ahead. This information was imparted just a few seconds  before the crash, and had the officer promptly answered the ring of the  bell it is probable that the accident could have been avoided, or at  least, been reduced by the lowered speed.    The lookout saw a towering \"blue berg\" looming up in the sea path of the  Titanic, and called the bridge on the ship's telephone. When, after the  passing of those two or three fateful minutes an officer on the bridge  lifted the telephone receiver from its hook to answer the lookout,  it was too late. The speeding liner, cleaving a calm sea under a  star-studded sky, had reached the floating mountain of ice, which the  theoretically \"unsinkable\" ship struck a crashing, if glancing, blow  with her starboard bow.    MURDOCK PAID WITH LIFE    Had Murdock, according to the account of the tragedy given by two of the  Titanic's seamen, known how imperative was that call from the lookout  man, the men at the wheel of the liner might have swerved the great ship  sufficiently to avoid the berg altogether. At the worst the vessel would  probably have struck the mass of ice with her stern.    Murdock, if the tale of the Titanic sailor be true, expiated his  negligence by shooting himself within sight of all alleged victims  huddled in life-boats or struggling in the icy seas.    When at last the danger was realized, the great ship was so close upon  the berg that it was practically impossible to avoid collision with it      VAIN TRIAL TO CLEAR BERG    The first officer did what other startled and alert commanders would  have done under similar circumstances, that is      {illust. caption = THE LOCATION OF THE DISASTER}      he made an effort by going full speed ahead on the starboard propeller  and reversing his port propeller, simultaneously throwing his helm  over, to make a rapid turn and clear the berg. The maneuver was not  successful. He succeeded in saving his bows from crashing into the  ice-cliff, but nearly the entire length of the underbody of the great  ship on the starboard side was ripped. The speed of the Titanic,  estimated to be at least twenty-one knots, was so terrific that the  knife-like edge of the iceberg's spur protruding under the sea cut  through her like a can-opener.    The Titanic was in 41.46 north latitude and 50.14 west longitude when  she was struck, very near the spot on the wide Atlantic where the  Carmania encountered a field of ice, studded with great bergs, on her  voyage to New York which ended on April 14th. It was really an ice pack,  due to an unusually severe winter in the north Atlantic. No less than  twenty-five bergs, some of great height, were counted.    The shock was almost imperceptible. The first officer did not apparently  realize that the great ship had received her death wound, and none of  the passengers had the slightest suspicion that anything more than a  usual minor sea accident had happened. Hundreds who had gone to their  berths and were asleep were unawakened by the vibration.      BRIDGE GAME NOT DISTURBED    To illustrate the placidity with which practically all the men regarded  the accident it is related that Pierre Marechal, son of the vice-admiral  of the French navy, Lucien Smith, Paul Chevre, a French sculptor, and A.  F. Ormont, a cotton broker, were in the Cafe Parisien playing bridge.    The four calmly got up from the table and after walking on deck and  looking over the rail returned to their game. One of them had left his  cigar on the card table, and while the three others were gazing out on  the sea he remarked that he couldn't afford to lose his smoke, returned  for his cigar and came out again.    They remained only for a few moments on deck, and then resumed their  game under the impression that the ship had stopped for reasons best  known to the captain and not involving any danger to her. Later, in  describing the scene that took place, M. Marechal, who was among the  survivors, said: \"When three-quarters of a mile away we stopped, the  spectacle before our eyes was in its way magnificent. In a very calm  sea, beneath a sky moonless but sown with millions of stars, the  enormous Titanic lay on the water, illuminated from the water line to  the boat deck. The bow was slowly sinking into the black water.\"    The tendency of the whole ship's company except the men in the engine  department, who were made aware of the danger by the inrushing water,  was to make light of and in some instances even to ridicule the thought  of danger to so substantial a fabric.      THE CAPTAIN ON DECK    When Captain Smith came from the chart room onto the bridge, his first  words were, \"Close the emergency doors.\"    \"They're already closed, sir,\" Mr. Murdock replied.    \"Send to the carpenter and tell him to sound the ship,\" was the next  order. The message was sent to the carpenter, but the carpenter never  came up to report. He was probably the first man on the ship to lose his  life.    The captain then looked at the communicator, which shows in what  direction the ship is listing. He saw that she carried five degrees list  to starboard.    The ship was then rapidly settling forward. All the steam sirens were  blowing. By the captain's orders, given in the next few minutes, the  engines were put to work at pumping out the ship, distress signals  were sent by the Marconi, and rockets were sent up from the bridge by  Quartermaster Rowe. All hands were ordered on deck.      PASSENGERS NOT ALARMED    The blasting shriek of the sirens had not alarmed the great company of  the Titanic, because such steam calls are an incident of travel in seas  where fogs roll. Many had gone to bed, but the hour, 11.40 P. M., was  not too late for the friendly contact of saloons and smoking rooms. It  was Sunday night and the ship's concert had ended, but there were many  hundreds up and moving among the gay lights, and many on deck with their  eyes strained toward the mysterious west, where home lay. And in one  jarring, breath-sweeping moment all of these, asleep or awake, were at  the mercy of chance. Few among the more than 2000 aboard could have had  a thought of danger. The man who had stood up in the smoking room to say  that the Titanic was vulnerable or that in a few minutes two-thirds of  her people would be face to face with death, would have been considered  a fool or a lunatic. No ship ever sailed the seas that gave her  passengers more confidence, more cool security.    Within a few minutes stewards and other members of the crew were sent  round to arouse the people. Some utterly refused to get up. The stewards  had almost to force the doors of the staterooms to make the somnolent  appreciate their peril, and many of them, it is believed, were drowned  like rats in a trap.      ASTOR AND WIFE STROLLED ON DECK    Colonel and Mrs. Astor were in their room and saw the ice vision flash  by. They had not appreciably felt the gentle shock and supposed that  nothing out of the ordinary had happened. They were both dressed  and came on deck leisurely. William T. Stead, the London journalist,  wandered on deck for a few minutes, stopping to talk to Frank Millet.  \"What do they say is the trouble?\" he asked. \"Icebergs,\" was the brief  reply. \"Well,\" said Stead, \"I guess it is nothing serious. I'm going  back to my cabin"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7820"],[0,"Monitress Merle (#6)"],[1," and they were left to themselves in the large  classroom. Big girls, little girls, new girls, and old girls sat on the  forms in giggling anticipation, chattering like swallows on the eve of  migration, and determined to have a good time and enjoy themselves.    \"You're the eldest! Open the ball!\" said Iva, pushing Nesta forward.    But Nesta had turned shy. She had never been in such a position before,  and, flushing scarlet, she urged her utter inability to cope with the  matter.    \"I can't! You do it--or Muriel!\" she whispered in an agonized voice.    But Muriel, in spite of her ambition, was also afflicted with stage-fright  and passed on the honour.    Iva, making a supreme effort, called to the girls for silence, but they  were too much out of hand to listen to her and only went on talking.  Merle, following some wise advice administered by Mavis, had allowed the  other three to have first innings, but as none seemed capable of  controlling the meeting she now stepped to the front and, making a  megaphone of a roll of foolscap, yelled, \"Order!\" with all the force of  her lungs. The effect was instantaneous. There was an immediate dead  hush, and all eyes were turned in her direction.    \"We're here this afternoon on business, and our first matter is to elect  a chairwoman,\" she proclaimed. \"Will somebody kindly nominate one.\"    \"I beg to propose Merle,\" piped Iva.    \"And I beg to second her,\" fluttered Nesta, taking courage.    The clapping and stamping that followed witnessed the entire approval of  the meeting. Merle was unanimously elected to the chair, and having thus  received the symbol of authority proceeded to wield it. She was not in  the least bashful, and was quite ready to cope with anything that lay  before her. She held up a hand for silence and addressed her audience.    \"I've told you we're here on business, and I want to explain. As it  affects everybody, perhaps you'll kindly listen without talking. Will  those three girls on the back bench move out here? Thanks! Now you all  know the school has started on a new era, and we hope it's going to forge  ahead. In the past we haven't done very much in the way of societies.  Perhaps that's all the better, because it gives us the chance to make a  clean start now, without any back traditions to hamper us. What I propose  is this: We'll go slow at first until we get into the swing of things,  and then later on we can blossom out as much as we like. I suggest that  we should get up three societies:    \"A Games Club.    \"A Literary Club.    \"An Entertainment Club.    \"The Games Club will try and work up a decent hockey team, and when our  play is worth anything, we'll see if we can't arrange a match with some  other school. The Literary Club will run a magazine, to which you'll all  be welcome to send contributions; and the Entertainment Club will  concentrate on getting up theatricals or something of that sort for the  end of the term. Does this meet your views?\"    \"Rather!\"    \"A1.\"    \"Go ahead!\" shouted several voices.    \"Well, our first business is to appoint a president and a secretary for  each. I'm going to write a few likely names upon the blackboard, and then  you can make your choice. I ought to add that the boarders have already  started a Recreation Club of their own, and have made Nesta Pitman  president and Aubrey Simpson secretary. This has nothing to do with the  day-girls, but I just mention it, thinking you'd like to know about it.  We haven't time for a ballot, so if you'll propose candidates we'll take  the voting by a show of hands.\"    An interesting and exciting ten minutes followed, in which the merits and  demerits of various nominations were discussed, and the following girls  were finally elected to office:    GAMES CLUB      _President_.  Merle Ramsay.    _Secretary_.  Kitty Trefyre.    _Committee_.  Muriel Burnitt.                       Aubrey Simpson.                       Beata Castleton.                       Tattie Carew.                       Edith Carey.                       Peggie Morrison.    LITERARY CLUB      _President_.  Muriel Burnitt.    _Secretary and Editress of Magazine_. Mavis Ramsay.    _Committee._ Iva Westwood.         Maude Carey.                      Merle Ramsay.         Fay Macleod.                      Nesta Pitman.         Peggie Morrison.    ENTERTAINMENTS CLUB      _President_. Iva Westwood.    _Secretary_. Nesta Pitman.    _Committee_. Muriel Burnitt. Aubrey Simpson.                      Mavis Ramsay.   Sybil Vernon.                      Merle Ramsay.   Kitty Trefyre.    It was just when the successful candidates were receiving congratulations  that Beata Castleton stood up.    \"As this is an open meeting may I make a suggestion?\" she asked.    \"Certainly,\" replied Merle from the chair.    \"Well, I should like to suggest a 'Nature Study Club.' There doesn't seem  to be anything of that sort in the school, is there?\"    \"We have a museum somewhere about the place, I believe,\" admitted Merle.    \"It's all put away in boxes,\" said Edith.    \"Then why can't we bring it out and arrange it and add to it? And can't  we start a record, year by year, of when we find the first specimens of  certain wild flowers, hear the first notes of certain birds, and see  migratory birds? It would be ever so interesting.\"    \"What a splendid idea! I'd like to second that!\" exclaimed Mavis, jumping  up in great enthusiasm.    The general feeling was in favour of the proposition, and the Nature  Study Club was duly inaugurated, with Beata for president and Fay Macleod  for secretary, and a committee consisting mostly of the particular little  set of girls who motored daily from Chagmouth.    By four o'clock the whole of the business was concluded, the societies  were established, and a very hopeful start had been made. Among the many  activities of that important afternoon one point seemed to stand out  firmly and clearly--Merle above all the other monitresses had shown  herself capable of taking the lead. Where Iva, Nesta, and Muriel had  failed to control the school she had restored order, conducted the  meeting admirably, and exhibited considerable powers of organisation. She  had undoubtedly justified her position, and had won the respect of most  of her comrades.    \"Did I do all right?\" she asked Mavis anxiously, as they walked home.    \"Splendiferously! I was bursting with pride! I couldn't have done it  myself, Merle! When I saw all that rackety crew talking and ragging, I  thought it was hopeless and that we should have to fetch Miss Mitchell.  Some of those juniors had just made up their minds to give trouble. You  tackled them marvellously.\"    \"I wasn't going to give in to them!\" declared Merle. \"I meant to stop  their ragging if I had to go round and box all their ears. Well! They  know now they have to behave themselves or I'll know the reason why! But  oh, Mavis! I don't think Muriel will ever forgive me for being  chairwoman.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"She never wanted me to be a monitress!\"    \"Nonsense!\"    \"It's the truth.\"    \"Well, she missed her own opportunity, so she can't blame you for taking  it this afternoon.\"    \"She's against me all the same. Iva and Nesta are quite nice, but there  are going to be squalls with Muriel. You'll take my part?\"    \"Of course I shall, through thick and thin. You can always count on your  own sister.\"    \"That's something to go upon at any rate. I shall need support. I don't  believe it's going to be an easy business.\"    \"'Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,'\" quoted Mavis laughingly.    \"Exactly. I wanted tremendously to be monitress, but I didn't realise all  I was in for. I see many breezes in front.\"    \"You'll weather them all, don't fear! After such a splendid start I've  every confidence in you. It's only a question now of keeping it up and  going ahead.\"    Merle was not mistaken in her estimation of the difficulties that lay  before her. A certain section of the juniors, led by Winnie Osborne and  Joyce Colman, the firebrands of the Third form, offered great resistance  to the authority of the monitresses, and put every possible obstacle in  their way. To keep these unruly youngsters in order meant a constant  clashing of wills, and needed much courage and determination. Some of the  new girls also were inclined to rebel and to air their own views. Sybil  Vernon, in particular, was a thorn in the flesh. She had been at  boarding-school before, and on the strength of her previous experience  she offered advice upon any and every occasion. She was very aggrieved  that she had not been eligible for election to office herself.    \"I know so much more about it than most of you!\" she would explain  airily. \"If Miss Pollard had only chosen _me_ as a monitress I could  have organised everything exactly like it used to be done at The Limes.\"    Sybil was a curious girl, fair, with a fat babyish face, and a vast idea  of her own importance. She was very proud of her family, and never for a  moment forgot, or allowed anybody else to forget, that she belonged to  the Vernons of Renshaw Court, and that Sir Richard Vernon was her second  cousin. She expected a great deal more attention than the school was  willing to accord to her, and was invariably offended or aggrieved or  annoyed about something. The girls did not take her very seriously, and  laughed at what they called her 'jim-jams,' which had the effect of  making her first very indignant and finally reducing her to floods of  tears.    Though Sybil might be annoying there was really not much harm in her, and  her criticisms were very easily combated. A different girl altogether,  however, was Kitty Trefyre. She also had been at another school, and set  forth standards of conduct which were dissimilar from those at 'The  Moorings.' She was cautious in airing these, and wisely so, for most of  them caused the monitresses to lift their eyebrows in amazement,  whereupon she would instantly retract"]]]
