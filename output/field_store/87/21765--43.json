The progress is to accuracy, to skill, to truth, from blind  force.    There is a moment, in the history of every nation, when, proceeding  out of this brute youth, the perceptive powers reach their ripeness,  and have not yet become microscopic: so that man, at that instant,  extends across the entire scale; and, with his feet still planted on  the immense forces of night, converses, by his eyes and brain, with  solar and stellar creation. That is the moment of adult health, the  culmination of power.    Such is the history of Europe, in all points; and such in philosophy.  Its early records, almost perished, are of the immigrations from Asia,  bringing with them the dreams of barbarians; a confusion of crude  notions of morals, and of natural philosophy, gradually subsiding,  through the partial insight of single teachers.    Before Pericles, came the Seven Wise Masters; and we have the beginnings  of geometry, metaphysics, and ethics: then the partialists,--deducing  the origin of things from flux or water, or from air, or from fire,  or from mind. All mix with these causes mythologic pictures. At last,  comes Plato, the distributor, who needs no barbaric paint, or tattoo,  or whooping; for he can define. He leaves with Asia the vast and  superlative; he is the arrival of accuracy and intelligence. \"He shall  be as a god to me, who can rightly divide and define.\"    This defining is philosophy. Philosophy is the account which the human  mind gives to itself of the constitution of the world. Two cardinal  facts lie forever at the base: the one, and the two.--1. Unity, or  Identity; and, 2, Variety. We unite all things, by perceiving the law  which pervades them; by perceiving the superficial differences, and  the profound resemblances. But every mental act,--this very perception  of identity or oneness, recognizes the difference of things. Oneness  and otherness. It is impossible to speak, or to think, without embracing  both.    The mind is urged to ask for one cause of many effects; then for the  cause of that; and again the cause, diving still into the profound;  self-assured that it shall arrive at an absolute and sufficient one,--a  one that shall be all. \"In the midst of the sun is the light, in the  midst of the light is truth, and in the midst of truth is the  imperishable being, \"say the Vedas. All philosophy, of east and west,  has the same centripetence. Urged by an opposite necessity, the mind  returns from the one, to that which is not one, but other or many;  from cause to effect; and affirms the necessary existence of variety,  the self-existence of both, as each is involved in the other. These  strictly-blended elements it is the problem of thought to separate,  and to reconcile. Their existence is mutually contradictory and  exclusive; and each so fast slides into the other, that we can never  say what is one, and what it is not. The Proteus is as nimble in the  highest as in the lowest grounds, when we contemplate the one, the  true, the good,--as in the surfaces and extremities of matter.  In all  nations, there are minds which incline to dwell in the conception of  the fundamental Unity. The raptures of prayer and ecstasy of devotion  lose all being in one Being. This tendency finds its highest expression  in the religious writings of the East, and chiefly, in the Indian  Scriptures, in the Vedas, the Bhagavat Geeta, and the Vishnu Purana.  Those writings contain little else than this idea, and they rise to  pure and sublime strains in celebrating it.    The Same, the Same! friend and foe are of one stuff; the ploughman,  the plough, and the furrow, are of one stuff; and the stuff is such,  and so much, that the variations of forms are unimportant. \"You are  fit\" (says the supreme Krishna to a sage) \"to apprehend that you are  not distinct from me. That which I am, thou art, and that also is this  world, with its gods, and heroes, and mankind. Men contemplate  distinctions, because they are stupefied with ignorance.\" \"The words  I and mine constitute ignorance. What is the great end of all, you  shall now learn from me. It is soul,--one in all bodies, pervading,  uniform, perfect, preeminent over nature, exempt from birth, growth,  and decay, omnipresent, made up of true knowledge, independent,  unconnected with unrealities, with name, species, and the rest, in  time past, present, and to come. The knowledge that this spirit, which  is essentially one, is in one's own, and in all other bodies, is the  wisdom of one who knows the unity of things. As one diffusive air,  passing through the perforations of a flute, is distinguished as the  notes of a scale, so the nature of the Great Spirit is single, though  its forms be manifold, arising from the consequences of acts. When the  difference of the investing form, as that of god, or the rest, is  destroyed, there is no distinction.\" \"The whole world is but a  manifestation of Vishnu, who is identical with all things, and is to  be regarded by the wise, as not differing from, but as the same as  themselves. I neither am going nor coming; nor is my dwelling in any  one place; nor art thou, thou; nor are others, others; nor am I, I.\"  As if he had said, \"All is for the soul, and the soul is Vishnu; and  animals and stars are transient painting; and light is whitewash; and  durations are deceptive; and form is imprisonment; and heaven itself  a decoy.\" That which the soul seeks is resolution into being, above  form, out of Tartarus, and out of heaven,--liberation from nature.    If speculation tends thus to a terrific unity, in which all things are  absorbed, action tends directly backwards to diversity. The first is  the course of gravitation of mind; the second is the power of nature.  Nature is the manifold. The unity absorbs, and melts or reduces. Nature  opens and creates. These two principles reappear and interpenetrate  all things, all thought; the one, the many. One is being; the other,  intellect; one is necessity; the other, freedom; one, rest; the other,  motion; one, power; the other, distribution; one, strength; the other,  pleasure; one, consciousness; the other, definition; one, genius; the  other, talent, one, earnestness; the other, knowledge; one, possession;  the other, trade; one, caste; the other, culture; one king; the other,  democracy; and, if we dare carry these generalizations a step higher,  and name the last tendency of both, we might say, that the end of the  one is escape from organization,--pure science; and the end of the  other is the highest instrumentality, or use of means, or executive  deity.    Each student adheres, by temperament and by habit, to the first or to  the second of these gods of the mind. By religion, he tends to unity;  by intellect, or by the senses, to the many. A too rapid unification,  and an excessive appliance to parts and particulars, are the twin  dangers of speculation.    To this partiality the history of nations corresponded. The country  of unity, of immovable institutions, the seat of a philosophy delighting  in abstractions, of men faithful in doctrine and in practice to the  idea of a deaf, unimplorable, immense fate, is Asia; and it realizes  this fate in the social institution of caste. On the other side, the  genius of Europe is active and creative; it resists caste by culture;  its philosophy was a discipline; it is a land of arts, inventions,  trade, freedom. If the East loved infinity, the West delighted in  boundaries.    European civility is the triumph of talent, the extension of system,  the sharpened understanding, adaptive skill, delight in forms, delight  in manifestation, in comprehensible results. Pericles, Athens, Greece,  had been working in this element with the joy of genius not yet chilled  by any foresight of the detriment of an excess. They saw before them  no sinister political economy; no ominous Malthus; no Paris or London;  no pitiless subdivision of classes,--the doom of the pinmakers, the  doom of the weavers, of dressers, of stockingers, of carders, of  spinners, of colliers; no Ireland; no Indian caste, superinduced by  the efforts of Europe to throw it off. The understanding was in its  health and prime. Art was in its splendid novelty. They cut the  Pentelican marble as if it were snow, and their perfect works in  architecture and sculpture seemed things of course, not more difficult  than the completion of a new ship at the Medford yards, or new mills  at Lowell. These things are in course, and may be taken for granted.  The Roman legion, Byzantine legislation, English trade, the saloons  of Versailles, the cafes of Paris, the steam-mill, steamboat,  steam-coach, may all be seen in perspective; the town-meeting, the  ballot-box, the newspaper and cheap press.    Meantime, Plato, in Egypt, and in Eastern pilgrimages, imbibed the  idea of one Deity, in which all things are absorbed. The unity of Asia,  and the detail of Europe; the infinitude of the Asiatic soul, and the  defining, result-loving, machine-making, surface-seeking, opera-going  Europe,--Plato came to join, and by contact to enhance the energy of  each. The excellence of Europe and Asia are in his brain. Metaphysics  and natural philosophy expressed the genius of Europe; he substructs  the religion of Asia, as the base.    In short, a balanced soul was born, perceptive of the two elements.  It is as easy to be great as to be small. The reason why we do not at  once believe in admirable souls, is because they are not in our  experience. In actual life, they are so rare, as to be incredible;  but, primarily, there is not only no presumption against them, but the  strongest presumption in favor of their appearance.

Land ho! On the morning of July 19 a mystic dome like a mountain of  silver stood alone in the sea ahead. Although the land was completely  hidden by the white, glistening haze that shone in the sun like  polished silver, I felt quite sure that it was Flores Island. At  half-past four P.M. it was abeam. The haze in the meantime had  disappeared. Flores is one hundred and seventy-four miles from Fayal,  and although it is a high island, it remained many years undiscovered  after the principal group of the islands had been colonized.    Early on the morning of July 20 I saw Pico looming above the clouds on  the starboard bow. Lower lands burst forth as the sun burned away the  morning fog, and island after island came into view. As I approached  nearer, cultivated fields appeared, \"and oh, how green the corn!\" Only  those who have seen the Azores from the deck of a vessel realize the  beauty of the mid-ocean picture.    [Illustration: The island of Pico.]    At 4:30 P.M. I cast anchor at Fayal, exactly eighteen days from Cape  Sable. The American consul, in a smart boat, came alongside before the  _Spray_ reached the breakwater, and a young naval officer, who feared  for the safety of my vessel, boarded, and offered his services as  pilot. The youngster, I have no good reason to doubt, could have  handled a man-of-war, but the _Spray_ was too small for the amount of  uniform he wore. However, after fouling all the craft in port and  sinking a lighter, she was moored without much damage to herself. This  wonderful pilot expected a \"gratification,\" I understood, but whether  for the reason that his government, and not I, would have to pay the  cost of raising the lighter, or because he did not sink the _Spray_, I  could never make out. But I forgive him.    It was the season for fruit when I arrived at the Azores, and there  was soon more of all kinds of it put on board than I knew what to do  with. Islanders are always the kindest people in the world, and I met  none anywhere kinder than the good hearts of this place. The people of  the Azores are not a very rich community. The burden of taxes is  heavy, with scant privileges in return, the air they breathe being  about the only thing that is not taxed. The mother-country does not  even allow them a port of entry for a foreign mail service. A packet  passing never so close with mails for Horta must deliver them first in  Lisbon, ostensibly to be fumigated, but really for the tariff from the  packet. My own letters posted at Horta reached the United States six  days behind my letter from Gibraltar, mailed thirteen days later.    The day after my arrival at Horta was the feast of a great saint.  Boats loaded with people came from other islands to celebrate at  Horta, the capital, or Jerusalem, of the Azores. The deck of the  _Spray_ was crowded from morning till night with men, women, and  children. On the day after the feast a kind-hearted native harnessed a  team and drove me a day over the beautiful roads all about Fayal,  \"because,\" said he, in broken English, \"when I was in America and  couldn't speak a word of English, I found it hard till I met some one  who seemed to have time to listen to my story, and I promised my good  saint then that if ever a stranger came to my country I would try to  make him happy.\" Unfortunately, this gentleman brought along an  interpreter, that I might \"learn more of the country.\" The fellow was  nearly the death of me, talking of ships and voyages, and of the boats  he had steered, the last thing in the world I wished to hear. He had  sailed out of New Bedford, so he said, for \"that Joe Wing they call  'John.'\" My friend and host found hardly a chance to edge in a word.  Before we parted my host dined me with a cheer that would have  gladdened the heart of a prince, but he was quite alone in his house.  \"My wife and children all rest there,\" said he, pointing to the  churchyard across the way. \"I moved to this house from far off,\" he  added, \"to be near the spot, where I pray every morning.\"    I remained four days at Fayal, and that was two days more than I had  intended to stay. It was the kindness of the islanders and their  touching simplicity which detained me. A damsel, as innocent as an  angel, came alongside one day, and said she would embark on the  _Spray_ if I would land her at Lisbon. She could cook flying-fish, she  thought, but her forte was dressing _bacalhao_. Her brother Antonio,  who served as interpreter, hinted that, anyhow, he would like to make  the trip. Antonio's heart went out to one John Wilson, and he was  ready to sail for America by way of the two capes to meet his friend.  \"Do you know John Wilson of Boston?\" he cried. \"I knew a John Wilson,\"  I said, \"but not of Boston.\" \"He had one daughter and one son,\" said  Antonio, by way of identifying his friend. If this reaches the right  John Wilson, I am told to say that \"Antonio of Pico remembers him.\"    [Illustration: Chart of the _Spray's_ Atlantic voyages from Boston to  Gibraltar, thence to the Strait of Magellan, in 1895, and finally  homeward bound from the Cape of Good Hope in 1898.]          CHAPTER IV      Squally weather in the Azores--High living--Delirious from cheese and  plums--The pilot of the _Pinta_--At Gibraltar--Compliments exchanged  with the British navy--A picnic on the Morocco shore.    I set sail from Horta early on July 24. The southwest wind at the time  was light, but squalls came up with the sun, and I was glad enough to  get reefs in my sails before I had gone a mile. I had hardly set the  mainsail, double-reefed, when a squall of wind down the mountains  struck the sloop with such violence that I thought her mast would go.  However, a quick helm brought her to the wind. As it was, one of the  weather lanyards was carried away and the other was stranded. My tin  basin, caught up by the wind, went flying across a French school-ship  to leeward. It was more or less squally all day, sailing along under  high land; but rounding close under a bluff, I found an opportunity to  mend the lanyards broken in the squall. No sooner had I lowered my  sails when a four-oared boat shot out from some gully in the rocks,  with a customs officer on board, who thought he had come upon a  smuggler. I had some difficulty in making him comprehend the true  case. However, one of his crew, a sailorly chap, who understood how  matters were, while we palavered jumped on board and rove off the new  lanyards I had already prepared, and with a friendly hand helped me  \"set up the rigging.\" This incident gave the turn in my favor. My  story was then clear to all. I have found this the way of the world.  Let one be without a friend, and see what will happen!    Passing the island of Pico, after the rigging was mended, the _Spray_  stretched across to leeward of the island of St. Michael's, which she  was up with early on the morning of July 26, the wind blowing hard.  Later in the day she passed the Prince of Monaco's fine steam-yacht  bound to Fayal, where, on a previous voyage, the prince had slipped  his cables to \"escape a reception\" which the padres of the island  wished to give him. Why he so dreaded the \"ovation\" I could not make  out. At Horta they did not know. Since reaching the islands I had  lived most luxuriously on fresh bread, butter, vegetables, and fruits  of all kinds. Plums seemed the most plentiful on the _Spray_, and  these I ate without stint. I had also a Pico white cheese that General  Manning, the American consul-general, had given me, which I supposed  was to be eaten, and of this I partook with the plums. Alas! by  night-time I was doubled up with cramps. The wind, which was already a  smart breeze, was increasing somewhat, with a heavy sky to the  sou'west. Reefs had been turned out, and I must turn them in again  somehow. Between cramps I got the mainsail down, hauled out the  earings as best I could, and tied away point by point, in the double  reef. There being sea-room, I should, in strict prudence, have made  all snug and gone down at once to my cabin. I am a careful man at sea,  but this night, in the coming storm, I swayed up my sails, which,  reefed though they were, were still too much in such heavy weather;  and I saw to it that the sheets were securely belayed. In a word, I  should have laid to, but did not. I gave her the double-reefed  mainsail and whole jib instead, and set her on her course. Then I went  below, and threw myself upon the cabin floor in great pain. How long I  lay there I could not tell, for I became delirious. When I came to, as  I thought, from my swoon, I realized that the sloop was plunging into  a heavy sea, and looking out of the companionway, to my amazement I  saw a tall man at the helm. His rigid hand, grasping the spokes of the  wheel, held them as in a vise. One may imagine my astonishment. His  rig was that of a foreign sailor, and the large red cap he wore was  cockbilled over his left ear, and all was set off with shaggy black  whiskers. He would have been taken for a pirate in any part of the  world. While I gazed upon his threatening aspect I forgot the storm,  and wondered if he had come to cut my throat. This he seemed to  divine. \"Senor,\" said he, doffing his cap, \"I have come to do you no  harm.\" And a smile, the faintest in the world, but still a smile,  played on his face, which seemed not unkind when he spoke. \"I have  come to do you no harm. I have sailed free,\" he said, \"but was never  worse than a _contrabandista_. I am one of Columbus's crew,\" he  continued. \"I am the pilot of the Pinta come to aid you. Lie quiet,  senor captain,\" he added, \"and I will guide your ship to-night. You  have a _calentura_, but you will be all right tomorrow.\" I thought  what a very devil he was to carry sail. Again, as if he read my mind,  he exclaimed: \"Yonder is the _Pinta_ ahead; we must overtake her. Give  her sail; give her sail! _Vale, vale, muy vale!_\" Biting off a "]]]
