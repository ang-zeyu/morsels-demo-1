Why not take the lightning off the  outer fences, and give them a chance?\"    \"I've already done it, Clarence.  Did you ever know me to be  inhospitable?\"    \"No, you are a good heart.  I want to go and--\"    \"Be a reception committee?  I will go, too.\"    We crossed the corral and lay down together between the two inside  fences.  Even the dim light of the cave had disordered our eyesight  somewhat, but the focus straightway began to regulate itself and  soon it was adjusted for present circumstances.  We had had to feel  our way before, but we could make out to see the fence posts now.  We started a whispered conversation, but suddenly Clarence broke  off and said:    \"What is that?\"    \"What is what?\"    \"That thing yonder.\"    \"What thing--where?\"    \"There beyond you a little piece--dark something--a dull shape  of some kind--against the second fence.\"    I gazed and he gazed.  I said:    \"Could it be a man, Clarence?\"    \"No, I think not.  If you notice, it looks a lit--why, it _is_  a man!--leaning on the fence.\"    \"I certainly believe it is; let us go and see.\"    We crept along on our hands and knees until we were pretty close,  and then looked up.  Yes, it was a man--a dim great figure in armor,  standing erect, with both hands on the upper wire--and, of course,  there was a smell of burning flesh.  Poor fellow, dead as a  door-nail, and never knew what hurt him.  He stood there like a  statue--no motion about him, except that his plumes swished about  a little in the night wind.  We rose up and looked in through  the bars of his visor, but couldn't make out whether we knew him  or not--features too dim and shadowed.    We heard muffled sounds approaching, and we sank down to the ground  where we were.  We made out another knight vaguely; he was coming  very stealthily, and feeling his way.  He was near enough now for  us to see him put out a hand, find an upper wire, then bend and  step under it and over the lower one.  Now he arrived at the  first knight--and started slightly when he discovered him.  He  stood a moment--no doubt wondering why the other one didn't move  on; then he said, in a low voice, \"Why dreamest thou here, good  Sir Mar--\" then he laid his hand on the corpse's shoulder--and just  uttered a little soft moan and sunk down dead.  Killed by a dead  man, you see--killed by a dead friend, in fact.  There was something  awful about it.    These early birds came scattering along after each other, about  one every five minutes in our vicinity, during half an hour.  They brought no armor of offense but their swords; as a rule,  they carried the sword ready in the hand, and put it forward and  found the wires with it.  We would now and then see a blue spark  when the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisible  to us; but we knew what had happened, all the same; poor fellow,  he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been elected.  We had brief intervals of grim stillness, interrupted with piteous  regularity by the clash made by the falling of an iron-clad; and  this sort of thing was going on, right along, and was very creepy  there in the dark and lonesomeness.    We concluded to make a tour between the inner fences.  We elected  to walk upright, for convenience's sake; we argued that if discerned,  we should be taken for friends rather than enemies, and in any case  we should be out of reach of swords, and these gentry did not seem  to have any spears along.  Well, it was a curious trip.  Everywhere  dead men were lying outside the second fence--not plainly visible,  but still visible; and we counted fifteen of those pathetic  statues--dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire.    One thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated: our current  was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out.  Pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound, and next moment  we guessed what it was.  It was a surprise in force coming! whispered  Clarence to go and wake the army, and notify it to wait in silence  in the cave for further orders.  He was soon back, and we stood  by the inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awful  work upon that swarming host.  One could make out but little of  detail; but he could note that a black mass was piling itself up  beyond the second fence.  That swelling bulk was dead men!  Our  camp was enclosed with a solid wall of the dead--a bulwark,  a breastwork, of corpses, you may say.  One terrible thing about  this thing was the absence of human voices; there were no cheers,  no war cries; being intent upon a surprise, these men moved as  noiselessly as they could; and always when the front rank was near  enough to their goal to make it proper for them to begin to get  a shout ready, of course they struck the fatal line and went down  without testifying.    I sent a current through the third fence now; and almost immediately  through the fourth and fifth, so quickly were the gaps filled up.  I believed the time was come now for my climax; I believed that  that whole army was in our trap.  Anyway, it was high time to find  out.  So I touched a button and set fifty electric suns aflame  on the top of our precipice.    Land, what a sight!  We were enclosed in three walls of dead men!  All the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living,  who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires.  The sudden glare paralyzed this host, petrified them, you may say,  with astonishment; there was just one instant for me to utilize  their immobility in, and I didn't lose the chance.  You see, in  another instant they would have recovered their faculties, then  they'd have burst into a cheer and made a rush, and my wires  would have gone down before it; but that lost instant lost them  their opportunity forever; while even that slight fragment of time  was still unspent, I shot the current through all the fences and  struck the whole host dead in their tracks!  _There_ was a groan  you could _hear_!  It voiced the death-pang of eleven thousand men.  It swelled out on the night with awful pathos.    A glance showed that the rest of the enemy--perhaps ten thousand  strong--were between us and the encircling ditch, and pressing  forward to the assault.  Consequently we had them _all!_ and had  them past help.  Time for the last act of the tragedy.  I fired  the three appointed revolver shots--which meant:    \"Turn on the water!\"    There was a sudden rush and roar, and in a minute the mountain  brook was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a  hundred feet wide and twenty-five deep.    \"Stand to your guns, men!  Open fire!\"    The thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated ten  thousand.  They halted, they stood their ground a moment against  that withering deluge of fire, then they broke, faced about and  swept toward the ditch like chaff before a gale.  A full fourth  part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment;  the three-fourths reached it and plunged over--to death by drowning.    Within ten short minutes after we had opened fire, armed resistance  was totally annihilated, the campaign was ended, we fifty-four were  masters of England.  Twenty-five thousand men lay dead around us.    But how treacherous is fortune!  In a little while--say an hour  --happened a thing, by my own fault, which--but I have no heart  to write that.  Let the record end here.        CHAPTER XLIV    A POSTSCRIPT BY CLARENCE    I, Clarence, must write it for him.  He proposed that we two  go out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded.  I was  strenuous against the project.  I said that if there were many,  we could do but little for them; and it would not be wise for us to  trust ourselves among them, anyway.  But he could seldom be turned  from a purpose once formed; so we shut off the electric current  from the fences, took an escort along, climbed over the enclosing  ramparts of dead knights, and moved out upon the field.  The first  wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back  against a dead comrade.  When The Boss bent over him and spoke  to him, the man recognized him and stabbed him.  That knight was  Sir Meliagraunce, as I found out by tearing off his helmet.  He  will not ask for help any more.    We carried The Boss to the cave and gave his wound, which was  not very serious, the best care we could.  In this service we had  the help of Merlin, though we did not know it.  He was disguised  as a woman, and appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife.  In this disguise, with brown-stained face and smooth shaven, he  had appeared a few days after The Boss was hurt and offered to cook  for us, saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps  which the enemy were forming, and that she was starving.  The Boss  had been getting along very well, and had amused himself with  finishing up his record.    We were glad to have this woman, for we were short handed.  We  were in a trap, you see--a trap of our own making.  If we stayed  where we were, our dead would kill us; if we moved out of our  defenses, we should no longer be invincible.  We had conquered;  in turn we were conquered.  The Boss recognized this; we all  recognized it.  If we could go to one of those new camps and  patch up some kind of terms with the enemy--yes, but The Boss  could not go, and neither could I, for I was among the first that  were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands.  Others were taken down, and still others.  To-morrow--    _To-morrow._  It is here.  And with it the end.  About midnight  I awoke, and saw that hag making curious passes in the air about  The Boss's head and face, and wondered what it meant.  Everybody  but the dynamo-watch lay steeped in sleep; there was no sound.  The woman ceased from her mysterious foolery, and started tip-toeing  toward the door.  I called out:   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7254"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#6)"],[1,"soil; and the three most modern missions in which they have  been collected, those of Cura, Curucuy, and Arechica, are already  destroyed. The Guayanos, who early in the sixteenth century gave their  name to the whole of that vast province, are less intelligent but  milder; and more easy, if not to civilize, at least to subjugate, than  the Caribs. Their language appears to belong to the great branch of  the Caribbee and Tamanac tongues. It displays the same analogies of  roots and grammatical forms, which are observed between the Sanscrit,  the Persian, the Greek, and the German. It is not easy to fix the  forms of what is indefinite by its nature; and to agree on the  differences which should be admitted between dialects, derivative  languages and mother-tongues. The Jesuits of Paraguay have made known  to us another tribe of Guayanos* in the southern hemisphere, living in  the thick forests of Parana. (* They are also called Guananas, or  Gualachas.) Though it cannot be denied in general that in consequence  of distant migrations,* (* Like the celebrated migrations of the  Omaguas, or Omeguas.) the nations that are settled north and south of  the Amazon have had communications with each other, I will not decide  whether the Guayanos of Parana and of Uruguay exhibit any other  relation to those of Carony, than that of an homonomy, which is  perhaps only accidental.    The most considerable Christian settlements are now concentrated  between the mountains of Santa Maria, the mission of San Miguel and  the eastern bank of the Carony, from San Buenaventura as far as Guri  and the embarcadero of San Joaquin; a space of ground which has not  more than four hundred and sixty square leagues of surface. The  savannahs to the east and south are almost uninhabited; we find there  only the solitary missions of Belem, Tumuremo, Tupuquen, Puedpa, and  Santa Clara. It were to be wished that the spots preferred for  cultivation were distant from the rivers where the land is higher and  the air more favourable to health. The Rio Carony, the waters of  which, of an admirable clearness, are not well stocked with fish, is  free from shoals from the Villa de Barceloneta, a little above the  confluence of the Paragua, as far as the village of Guri. Farther  north it winds between innumerable islands and rocks; and only the  small boats of the Caribs venture to navigate amid these raudales, or  rapids of the Carony. Happily the river is often divided into several  branches; and consequently that can be chosen which, according to the  height of the waters, presents the fewest whirlpools and shoals. The  great fall, celebrated for the picturesque beauty of its situation, is  a little above the village of Aguacaqua, or Carony, which in my time  had a population of seven hundred Indians. This cascade is said to be  from fifteen to twenty feet high; but the bar does not cross the whole  bed of the river, which is more than three hundred feet broad. When  the population is more extended toward the east, it will avail itself  of the course of the small rivers Imataca and Aquire, the navigation  of which is pretty free from danger. The monks, who like to keep  themselves isolated, in order to withdraw from the eye of the secular  power, have been hitherto unwilling to settle on the banks of the  Orinoco. It is, however, by this river only, or by the Cuyuni and the  Essequibo, that the missions of Carony can export their productions.  The latter way has not yet been tried, though several Christian  settlements* are formed on one of the principal tributary streams of  the Cuyuni, the Rio Juruario. (* Guacipati, Tupuquen, Angel de la  Custodia, and Cura, where the military post of the frontiers was  stationed in 1800, which had been anciently placed at the confluence  of the Cuyuni and the Curumu.) This stream furnishes, at the period of  the great swellings, the remarkable phenomenon of a bifurcation. It  communicates by the Juraricuima and the Aurapa with the Rio Carony; so  that the land comprised between the Orinoco, the sea, the Cuyuni, and  the Carony, becomes a real island. Formidable rapids impede the  navigation of the Upper Cuyuni; and hence of late an attempt has been  made to open a road to the colony of Essequibo much more to the  south-east, in order to fall in with the Cuyuni much below the mouth  of the Curumu.    The whole of this southern territory is traversed by hordes of  independent Caribs; the feeble remains of that warlike people who were  so formidable to the missionaries till 1733 and 1735, at which period  the respectable bishop Gervais de Labrid,* (* Consecrated a bishop for  the four parts of the world (obispo para las quatro partes del mundo)  by pope Benedict XIII.) canon of the metropolitan chapter of Lyon,  Father Lopez, and several other ecclesiastics, perished by the hands  of the Caribs. These dangers, too frequent formerly, exist no longer,  either in the missions of Carony, or in those of the Orinoco; but the  independent Caribs continue, on account of their connection with the  Dutch colonists of Essequibo, an object of mistrust and hatred to the  government of Guiana. These tribes favour the contraband trade along  the coast, and by the channels or estuaries that join the Rio Barima  to the Rio Moroca; they carry off the cattle belonging to the  missionaries, and excite the Indians recently converted, and living  within the sound of the bell, to return to the forests. The free  hordes have everywhere a powerful interest in opposing the progress of  cultivation and the encroachments of the Whites. The Caribs and the  Aruacas procure fire-arms at Essequibo and Demerara; and when the  traffic of American slaves (poitos) was most active, adventurers of  Dutch origin took part in these incursions on the Paragua, the  Erevato, and the Ventuario. Man-hunting took place on these banks, as  heretofore (and probably still) on those of the Senegal and the  Gambia. In both worlds Europeans have employed the same artifices, and  committed the same atrocities, to maintain a trade that dishonours  humanity. The missionaries of the Carony and the Orinoco attribute all  the evils they suffer from the independent Caribs to the hatred of  their neighbours, the Calvinist preachers of Essequibo. Their works  are therefore filled with complaints of the secta diabolica de Calvino  y de Lutero, and against the heretics of Dutch Guiana, who also think  fit sometimes to go on missions, and spread the germs of social life  among the savages.    Of all the vegetable productions of those countries, that which the  industry of the Catalonian Capuchins has rendered the most celebrated  is the tree that furnishes the Cortex angosturae, which is erroneously  designated by the name of cinchona of Carony. We were fortunate enough  to make it first known as a new genus distinct from the cinchona, and  belonging to the family of meliaceae, or of zanthoxylus. This salutary  drug of South America was formerly attributed to the Brucea ferruginea  which grows in Abyssinia, to the Magnolia glauca, and to the Magnolia  plumieri. During the dangerous disease of M. Bonpland, M. Ravago sent  a confidential person to the missions of Carony, to procure for us, by  favour of the Capuchins of Upata, branches of the tree in flower which  we wished to be able to describe. We obtained very fine specimens, the  leaves of which, eighteen inches long, diffused an agreeable aromatic  smell. We soon perceived that the cuspare (the indigenous name of the  cascarilla or corteza del Angostura) forms a new genus; and on sending  the plants of the Orinoco to M. Willdenouw, I begged he would dedicate  this plant to M. Bonpland. The tree, known at present by the name of  Bonplandia trifoliata, grows at the distance of five or six leagues  from the eastern bank of the Carony, at the foot of the hills that  surround the missions Capapui, Upata and Alta Gracia. The Caribbee  Indians make use of an infusion of the bark of the cuspare, which they  consider as a strengthening remedy. M. Bonpland discovered the same  tree west of Cumana, in the gulf of Santa Fe, where it may become one  of the articles of exportation from New Andalusia.    The Catalonian monks prepare an extract of the Cortex angosturae which  they send to the convents of their province, and which deserves to be  better known in the north of Europe. It is to be hoped that the  febrifuge and anti-dysenteric bark of the bonplandia will continue to  be employed, notwithstanding the introduction of another, described by  the name of False Angostura bark, and often confounded with the  former. This false Angostura, or Angostura pseudo-ferruginea, comes,  it is said, from the Brucea antidysenterica; it acts powerfully on the  nerves, produces violent attacks of tetanus, and contains, according  to the experiments of Pelletier and Caventon, a peculiar alkaline  substance* analogous to morphine and strychnine. (* Brucine. M.  Pelletier has wisely avoided using the word angosturine, because it  might indicate a substance taken from the real Cortex angosturae, or  Bonplandia trifoliata. (Annales de Chimie volume 12 page 117.) We saw  at Peru the barks of two new species of weinmannia and wintera mixed  with those of cinchona; a mixture less dangerous, but still injurious,  on account of the superabundance of tannin and acrid matter contained  in the false cascarilla.) As the tree which yields the real Cortex  angosturae does not grow in great abundance, it is to be wished that  plantations of it were formed. The Catalonian monks are well fitted to  spread this kind of cultivation; they are more economical,  industrious, and active than the other missionaries. They have already  established tan-yards and cotton-spinning in a few villages; and if  they suffer the Indians henceforth to enjoy the fruit of their  labours, they will find great resources in the native population.
