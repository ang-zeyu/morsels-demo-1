Here was a girl of real discernment--a thoughtful  student of character--a girl who understood that a man might sit at a  supper-party without uttering a word and might still be a man of parts.    \"I'm afraid you'll think me very outspoken--but that's me all over. All  my friends say, 'Billy Verepoint's a funny girl: if she likes any one  she just tells them so straight out; and if she doesn't like any one she  tells them straight out, too.'\"    \"And a very admirable trait,\" said Roland, enthusiastically.    Miss Verepoint sighed. \"P'raps it is,\" she said pensively, \"but I'm  afraid it's what has kept me back in my profession. Managers don't like  it: they think girls should be seen and not heard.\"    Roland's blood boiled. Managers were plainly a dastardly crew.    \"But what's the good of worrying,\" went on Miss Verepoint, with a brave  but hollow laugh. \"Of course, it's wearing, having to wait when one has  got as much ambition as I have; but they all tell me that my chance is  bound to come some day.\"    The intense mournfulness of Miss Verepoint's expression seemed to  indicate that she anticipated the arrival of the desired day not less  than sixty years hence. Roland was profoundly moved. His chivalrous  nature was up in arms. He fell to wondering if he could do anything to  help this victim of managerial unfairness. \"You don't mind my going on  about my troubles, do you?\" asked Miss Verepoint, solicitously. \"One so  seldom meets anybody really sympathetic.\"    Roland babbled fervent assurances, and she pressed his hand gratefully.    \"I wonder if you would care to come to tea one afternoon,\" she said.    \"Oh, rather!\" said Roland. He would have liked to put it in a more  polished way but he was almost beyond speech.    \"Of course, I know what a busy man you are----\"    \"No, no!\"    \"Well, I should be in to-morrow afternoon, if you cared to look in.\"    Roland bleated gratefully.    \"I'll write down the address for you,\" said Miss Verepoint, suddenly  businesslike.           *       *       *       *       *    Exactly when he committed himself to the purchase of the Windsor  Theater, Roland could never say. The idea seemed to come into existence  fully-grown, without preliminary discussion. One moment it was not--the  next it was. His recollections of the afternoon which he spent drinking  lukewarm tea and punctuating Miss Verepoint's flow of speech with  \"yes's\" and \"no's\" were always so thoroughly confused that he never knew  even whose suggestion it was.    The purchase of a West-end theater, when one has the necessary cash,  is not nearly such a complicated business as the layman might imagine.  Roland was staggered by the rapidity with which the transaction was  carried through. The theater was his before he had time to realize that  he had never meant to buy the thing at all. He had gone into the offices  of Mr. Montague with the intention of making an offer for the lease for,  say, six months; and that wizard, in the space of less than an hour, had  not only induced him to sign mysterious documents which made him sole  proprietor of the house, but had left him with the feeling that he had  done an extremely acute stroke of business. Mr. Montague had dabbled in  many professions in his time, from street peddling upward, but what he  was really best at was hypnotism.    Altho he felt, after the spell of Mr. Montague's magnetism was  withdrawn, rather like a nervous man who has been given a large baby  to hold by a strange woman who has promptly vanished round the corner,  Roland was to some extent consoled by the praise bestowed upon him by  Miss Verepoint. She said it was much better to buy a theater than to  rent it, because then you escaped the heavy rent. It was specious,  but Roland had a dim feeling that there was a flaw somewhere in the  reasoning; and it was from this point that a shadow may be said to have  fallen upon the brightness of the venture.    He would have been even less self-congratulatory if he had known the  Windsor Theater's reputation. Being a comparative stranger in the  metropolis, he was unaware that its nickname in theatrical circles  was \"The Mugs' Graveyard\"--a title which had been bestowed upon it not  without reason. Built originally by a slightly insane old gentleman,  whose principal delusion was that the public was pining for a constant  supply of the Higher Drama, and more especially those specimens of  the Higher Drama which flowed practically without cessation from the  restless pen of the insane old gentleman himself, the Windsor Theater  had passed from hand to hand with the agility of a gold watch in a  gathering of race-course thieves. The one anxiety of the unhappy man who  found himself, by some accident, in possession of the Windsor Theater,  was to pass it on to somebody else. The only really permanent tenant it  ever had was the representative of the Official Receiver.    Various causes were assigned for the phenomenal ill-luck of the theater,  but undoubtedly the vital objection to it as a Temple of Drama lay in  the fact that nobody could ever find the place where it was hidden.  Cabmen shook their heads on the rare occasions when they were asked to  take a fare there. Explorers to whom a stroll through the Australian  bush was child's-play, had been known to spend an hour on its trail and  finish up at the point where they had started.    It was precisely this quality of elusiveness which had first attracted  Mr. Montague. He was a far-seeing man, and to him the topographical  advantages of the theater were enormous. It was further from a  fire-station than any other building of the same insurance value in  London, even without having regard to the mystery which enveloped its  whereabouts. Often after a good dinner he would lean comfortably back  in his chair and see in the smoke of his cigar a vision of the Windsor  Theater blazing merrily, while distracted firemen galloped madly all  over London, vainly endeavoring to get some one to direct them to the  scene of the conflagration. So Mr. Montague bought the theater for a  mere song, and prepared to get busy.    Unluckily for him, the representatives of the various fire offices with  which he had effected his policies got busy first. The generous fellows  insisted upon taking off his shoulders the burden of maintaining the  fireman whose permanent presence in a theater is required by law.  Nothing would satisfy them but to install firemen of their own and pay  their salaries. This, to a man in whom the instincts of the phoenix  were so strongly developed as they were in Mr. Montague, was distinctly  disconcerting. He saw himself making no profit on the deal--a thing  which had never happened to him before.    And then Roland Bleke occurred, and Mr. Montague's belief that his race  was really chosen was restored. He sold the Windsor Theater to Roland  for twenty-five thousand pounds. It was fifteen thousand pounds more  than he himself had given for it, and this very satisfactory profit  mitigated the slight regret which he felt when it came to transferring  to Roland the insurance policies. To have effected policies amounting  to rather more than seventy thousand pounds on a building so notoriously  valueless as the Windsor Theater had been an achievement of which Mr.  Montague was justly proud, and it seemed sad to him that so much earnest  endeavor should be thrown away.           *       *       *       *       *    Over the little lunch with which she kindly allowed Roland to entertain  her, to celebrate the purchase of the theater, Miss Verepoint outlined  her policy.    \"What we must put up at that theater,\" she announced, \"is a revue.  A revue,\" repeated Miss Verepoint, making, as she spoke, little  calculations on the back of the menu, \"we could run for about fifteen  hundred a week--or, say, two thousand.\"    Saying two thousand, thought Roland to himself, is not quite the same as  paying two thousand, so why should she stint herself?    \"I know two boys who could write us a topping revue,\" said Miss  Verepoint. \"They'd spread themselves, too, if it was for me. They're in  love with me--both of them. We'd better get in touch with them at once.\"    To Roland, there seemed to be something just the least bit sinister  about the sound of that word \"touch,\" but he said nothing.    \"Why, there they are--lunching over there!\" cried Miss Verepoint,  pointing to a neighboring table. \"Now, isn't that lucky?\"    To Roland the luck was not quite so apparent, but he made no demur to  Miss Verepoint's suggestion that they should be brought over to their  table.    The two boys, as to whose capabilities to write a topping revue Miss  Verepoint had formed so optimistic an estimate, proved to be well-grown  lads of about forty-five and forty, respectively. Of the two, Roland  thought that perhaps R. P. de Parys was a shade the more obnoxious,  but a closer inspection left him with the feeling that these fine  distinctions were a little unfair with men of such equal talents.  Bromham Rhodes ran his friend so close that it was practically a dead  heat. They were both fat and somewhat bulgy-eyed. This was due to the  fact that what revue-writing exacts from its exponents is the constant  assimilation of food and drink. Bromham Rhodes had the largest appetite  in London; but, on the other hand, R. P. de Parys was a better drinker.    \"Well, dear old thing!\" said Bromham Rhodes.    \"Well, old child!\" said R. P. de Parys.    Both these remarks were addressed to Miss Verepoint. The talented pair  appeared to be unaware of Roland's existence.    Miss Verepoint struck the business note. \"Now you stop, boys,\" she said.  \"Tie weights to yourselves and sink down into those chairs. I want you  two lads to write a revue for me.\"    \"Delighted!\" said Bromham Rhodes; \"but----\"    \"There is the trifling point to be raised first----\" said R. P. de  Parys.    \"Where is the money coming"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8743"],[0,"Mary Schweidler, the amber witch (#6)"],[1,"he had taken in his net, all saying they wished  for no better priest than me, and that I was only to pray to the merciful  Lord to bestow more upon them, whereupon I should want for nothing.  Meanwhile I must be quiet and not betray them. All this I promised, and my  daughter Mary took the blessed gifts of God off the table and carried them  into the inner chamber. But, alas! next morning, when she would have put  the meat into the caldron, it was all gone. I know not who prepared this  new sorrow for me, but much believe it was Hinrich Seden his wicked wife,  seeing he can never hold his tongue, and most likely told her everything.  Moreover, Paasch his little daughter saw that she had meat in her pot next  day; _item_, that she had quarrelled with her husband, and had flung the  fish-board at him, whereon some fresh fish-scales were sticking: she had,  however, presently recollected herself when she saw the child. (Shame on  thee, thou old witch, it is true enough, I dare say!) Hereupon nought was  left us but to feed our poor souls with the word of God. But even our  souls were so cast down that they could receive nought, any more than our  bellies; my poor child, especially, from day to day grew paler, greyer,  and yellower, and always threw up all her food, seeing she ate it without  salt or bread. I had long wondered that the bread from Liepe was not yet  done, but that every day at dinner I still had a morsel. I had often  asked, \"Whence comes all this blessed bread? I believe, after all, you  save the whole for me, and take none for yourself or the maid.\" But they  both then lifted to their mouths a piece of fir-tree bark, which they had  cut to look like bread, and laid by their plates; and as the room was  dark, I did not find out their deceit, but thought that they, too, were  eating bread. But at last the maid told me of it, so that I should allow  it no longer, as my daughter would not listen to her. It is not hard to  guess how my heart was wrung when I saw my poor child lying on her bed of  moss struggling with grim hunger. But things were to go yet harder with  me, for the Lord in his anger would break me in pieces like a potter's  vessel. For behold, on the evening of the same day, old Paasch came  running to me, complaining that all his and my corn in the field had been  pulled up and miserably destroyed, and that it must have been done by  Satan himself, as there was not a trace either of oxen or horses. At these  words my poor child screamed aloud and fainted. I would have run to help  her, but could not reach her bed, and fell on the ground myself for bitter  grief. The loud cries of the maid and old Paasch soon brought us both to  our senses. But I could not rise from the ground alone, for the Lord had  bruised all my bones. I besought them, therefore, when they would have  helped me, to leave me where I was; and when they would not, I cried out  that I must again fall on the ground to pray, and begged them all save my  daughter to depart out of the room. This they did, but the prayer would  not come. I fell into heavy doubting and despair, and murmured against the  Lord that he plagued me more sorely than Lazarus or Job. Wretch that I  was, I cried, \"Thou didst leave to Lazarus at least the crumbs and the  pitiful dogs, but to me thou hast left nothing, and I myself am less in  thy sight even than a dog; and Job thou didst not afflict until thou hadst  mercifully taken away his children, but to me thou hast left my poor  little daughter, that her torments may increase mine own a thousandfold.  Behold, then, I can only pray that thou wilt take her from the earth, so  that my grey head may gladly follow her to the grave! Woe is me, ruthless  father, what have I done? I have eaten bread, and suffered my child to  hunger! Oh, Lord Jesu, who hast said, 'What man is there of you, whom if  his son ask bread will he give him a stone?' Behold I am that man!--behold  I am that ruthless father! I have eaten bread and have given wood to my  child! Punish me; I will bear it and lie still. Oh, righteous Jesu, I have  eaten bread, and have given wood to my child!\" As I did not speak, but  rather shrieked these words, wringing my hands the while, my child fell  upon my neck, sobbing, and chid me for murmuring against the Lord, seeing  that even she, a weak and frail woman, had never doubted his mercy, so  that with shame and repentance I presently came to myself, and humbled  myself before the Lord for such heavy sin.    Meanwhile the maid had run into the village with loud cries to see if she  could get anything for her poor young mistress, but the people had already  eaten their noontide meal, and most of them were gone to sea to seek their  blessed supper; thus she could find nothing, seeing that old wife Seden,  who alone had any victuals, would give her none, although she prayed her  by Jesu's wounds.    She was telling us this when we heard a noise in the chamber, and  presently Lizzie her worthy old husband, who had got in at the window by  stealth, brought us a pot of good broth, which he had taken off the fire  whilst his wife was gone for a moment into the garden. He well knew that  his wife would make him pay for it, but that he did not mind, so the young  mistress would but drink it, and she would find it salted and all. He  would make haste out of the window again, and see that he got home before  his wife, that she might not find out where he had been. But my daughter  would not touch the broth, which sorely vexed him, so that he set it down  on the ground cursing, and ran out of the room. It was not long before his  squint-eyed wife came in at the front door, and when she saw the pot still  steaming on the ground, she cried out, \"Thou thief, thou cursed thieving  carcass!\" and would have flown at the face of my maid. But I threatened  her, and told her all that had happened, and that if she would not believe  me she might go into the chamber and look out of the window, whence she  might still, belike, see her good man running home. This she did, and  presently we heard her calling after him, \"Wait, and the devil shall tear  off thine arms; only wait till thou art home again!\" After this she came  back, and, muttering something, took the pot off the ground. I begged her,  for the love of God, to spare a little to my child; but she mocked at me  and said, \"You can preach to her, as you did to me,\" and walked towards  the door with the pot. My child indeed besought me to let her go, but I  could not help calling after her, \"For the love of God, one good sup, or  my poor child must give up the ghost: wilt thou that at the day of  judgment God should have mercy on thee, so show mercy this day to me and  mine!\" But she scoffed at us again, and cried out, \"Let her cook herself  some bacon,\" and went out at the door. I then sent the maid after her with  the hour-glass which stood before me on the table, to offer it to her for  a good sup out of the pot; but the maid brought it back, saying that she  would not have it. Alas, how I wept and sobbed, as my poor dying child  with a loud sigh buried her head again in the moss! Yet the merciful God  was more gracious to me than my unbelief had deserved; for when the  hard-hearted woman bestowed a little broth on her neighbour, old Paasch,  he presently brought it to my child, having heard from the maid how it  stood with her; and I believe that this broth, under God, alone saved her  life, for she raised her head as soon as she had supped it, and was able  to go about the house again in an hour. May God reward the good fellow for  it! Thus I had some joy in the midst of my trouble. But while I sat by the  fireside in the evening musing on my fate, my grief again broke forth, and  I made up my mind to leave my house, and even my cure, and to wander  through the wide world with my daughter as a beggar. God knows I had cause  enough for it; for now that all my hopes were dashed, seeing that my field  was quite ruined, and that the Sheriff had become my bitter enemy;  moreover, that it was five years since I had had a wedding, _item_, but  two christenings during the past year, I saw my own and my daughter's  death staring me in the face, and no prospect of better times at hand. Our  want was increased by the great fears of the congregation; for although  by God's wondrous mercy they had already begun to take good draughts of  fish both in the sea and the Achterwater, and many of the people in the  other villages had already gotten bread, salt, oatmeal, etc., from the  Polters and Quatzners, of Anklam and Lassan in exchange for their fish;  nevertheless, they brought me nothing, fearing lest it might be told at  Pudgla, and make his lordship ungracious to them. I therefore beckoned my  daughter to me, and told her what was in my thoughts, saying that God in  his mercy could any day bestow on me another cure if I was found worthy in  his sight of such a favour, seeing that these terrible days of pestilence  and war had called away many of the servants of his word, and that I had  not fled like a hireling from his flock, but on the contrary, till _datum_  shared sorrow and death with it. Whether she were able to walk five or ten  miles a day; for that then we would beg our way to Hamburg, to my departed  wife her step-brother, Martin Behring, who is a great merchant in that  city.    This at first sounded strange to her, seeing that she had very seldom been  out of our parish, and that her departed mother and her little brother lay  in our churchyard. She asked, \"Who was to make up their graves and plant  flowers on them? _Item_, as the Lord had given her a smooth face, what I  should do if in these wild and cruel times she were attacked on the  highways by marauding soldiers or other villains, seeing that I was a weak  old man and unable to defend her; _item_, wherewithal should we shield  ourselves from the frost, as the winter was setting in and"]]]
