That feeble in the mind's eye, lean your trust  Upon unstaid perverseness! now ye not  That we are worms, yet made at last to form  The winged insect, imp'd with angel plumes  That to heaven's justice unobstructed soars?  Why buoy ye up aloft your unfleg'd souls?  Abortive then and shapeless ye remain,  Like the untimely embryon of a worm!    As, to support incumbent floor or roof,  For corbel is a figure sometimes seen,  That crumples up its knees unto its breast,  With the feign'd posture stirring ruth unfeign'd  In the beholder's fancy; so I saw  These fashion'd, when I noted well their guise.    Each, as his back was laden, came indeed  Or more or less contract; but it appear'd  As he, who show'd most patience in his look,  Wailing exclaim'd: \"I can endure no more.\"          CANTO XI    \"O thou Almighty Father, who dost make  The heavens thy dwelling, not in bounds confin'd,  But that with love intenser there thou view'st  Thy primal effluence, hallow'd be thy name:  Join each created being to extol  Thy might, for worthy humblest thanks and praise  Is thy blest Spirit.  May thy kingdom's peace  Come unto us; for we, unless it come,  With all our striving thither tend in vain.  As of their will the angels unto thee  Tender meet sacrifice, circling thy throne  With loud hosannas, so of theirs be done  By saintly men on earth.  Grant us this day  Our daily manna, without which he roams  Through this rough desert retrograde, who most  Toils to advance his steps.  As we to each  Pardon the evil done us, pardon thou  Benign, and of our merit take no count.  'Gainst the old adversary prove thou not  Our virtue easily subdu'd; but free  From his incitements and defeat his wiles.  This last petition, dearest Lord! is made  Not for ourselves, since that were needless now,  But for their sakes who after us remain.\"    Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring,  Those spirits went beneath a weight like that  We sometimes feel in dreams, all, sore beset,  But with unequal anguish, wearied all,  Round the first circuit, purging as they go,  The world's gross darkness off: In our behalf  If there vows still be offer'd, what can here  For them be vow'd and done by such, whose wills  Have root of goodness in them?  Well beseems  That we should help them wash away the stains  They carried hence, that so made pure and light,  They may spring upward to the starry spheres.    \"Ah! so may mercy-temper'd justice rid  Your burdens speedily, that ye have power  To stretch your wing, which e'en to your desire  Shall lift you, as ye show us on which hand  Toward the ladder leads the shortest way.  And if there be more passages than one,  Instruct us of that easiest to ascend;  For this man who comes with me, and bears yet  The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him,  Despite his better will but slowly mounts.\"  From whom the answer came unto these words,  Which my guide spake, appear'd not; but 'twas said:    \"Along the bank to rightward come with us,  And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil  Of living man to climb: and were it not  That I am hinder'd by the rock, wherewith  This arrogant neck is tam'd, whence needs I stoop  My visage to the ground, him, who yet lives,  Whose name thou speak'st not him I fain would view.  To mark if e'er I knew himnd to crave  His pity for the fardel that I bear.  I was of Latiun,  of a Tuscan horn  A mighty one: Aldobranlesco's name  My sire's, I know not if ye e'er have heard.  My old blood and forefathers' gallant deeds  Made me so haughty, that I clean forgot  The common mother, and to such excess,  Wax'd in my scorn of all men, that I fell,  Fell therefore; by what fate Sienna's sons,  Each child in Campagnatico, can tell.  I am Omberto; not me only pride  Hath injur'd, but my kindred all involv'd  In mischief with her.  Here my lot ordains  Under this weight to groan, till I appease  God's angry justice, since I did it not  Amongst the living, here amongst the dead.\"    List'ning I bent my visage down: and one  (Not he who spake) twisted beneath the weight  That urg'd him, saw me, knew me straight, and call'd,  Holding his eyes With difficulty fix'd  Intent upon me, stooping as I went  Companion of their way.  \"O!\"  I exclaim'd,    \"Art thou not Oderigi, art not thou  Agobbio's glory, glory of that art  Which they of Paris call the limmer's skill?\"    \"Brother!\" said he, \"with tints that gayer smile,  Bolognian Franco's pencil lines the leaves.  His all the honour now; mine borrow'd light.  In truth I had not been thus courteous to him,  The whilst I liv'd, through eagerness of zeal  For that pre-eminence my heart was bent on.  Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid.  Nor were I even here; if, able still  To sin, I had not turn'd me unto God.  O powers of man! how vain your glory, nipp'd  E'en in its height of verdure, if an age  Less bright succeed not! imbue thought  To lord it over painting's field; and now  The cry is Giotto's, and his name eclips'd.  Thus hath one Guido from the other snatch'd  The letter'd prize: and he perhaps is born,  Who shall drive either from their nest.  The noise  Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind,  That blows from divers points, and shifts its name  Shifting the point it blows from.  Shalt thou more  Live in the mouths of mankind, if thy flesh  Part shrivel'd from thee, than if thou hadst died,  Before the coral and the pap were left,  Or ere some thousand years have passed? and that  Is, to eternity compar'd, a space,  Briefer than is the twinkling of an eye  To the heaven's slowest orb.  He there who treads  So leisurely before me, far and wide  Through Tuscany resounded once; and now  Is in Sienna scarce with whispers nam'd:  There was he sov'reign, when destruction caught  The madd'ning rage of Florence, in that day  Proud as she now is loathsome.  Your renown  Is as the herb, whose hue doth come and go,  And his might withers it, by whom it sprang  Crude from the lap of earth.\"  I thus to him:  \"True are thy sayings: to my heart they breathe  The kindly spirit of meekness, and allay  What tumours rankle there.  But who is he  Of whom thou spak'st but now?\"--\"This,\" he replied,  \"Is Provenzano.  He is here, because  He reach'd, with grasp presumptuous, at the sway  Of all Sienna.  Thus he still hath gone,  Thus goeth never-resting, since he died.  Such is th' acquittance render'd back of him,  Who, beyond measure, dar'd on earth.\"  I then:  \"If soul that to the verge of life delays  Repentance, linger in that lower space,  Nor hither mount, unless good prayers befriend,  How chanc'd admittance was vouchsaf'd to him?\"    \"When at his glory's topmost height,\" said he,  \"Respect of dignity all cast aside,  Freely He fix'd him on Sienna's plain,  A suitor to  redeem his suff'ring friend,  Who languish'd in the prison-house of Charles,  Nor for his sake refus'd through every vein  To tremble.  More I will not say; and dark,  I know, my words are, but thy neighbours soon  Shall help thee to a comment on the text.  This is the work, that from these limits freed him.\"          CANTO XII    With equal pace as oxen in the yoke,  I with that laden spirit journey'd on  Long as the mild instructor suffer'd me;  But when he bade me quit him, and proceed  (For \"here,\" said he, \"behooves with sail and oars  Each man, as best he may, push on his bark\"),  Upright, as one dispos'd for speed, I rais'd  My body, still in thought submissive bow'd.    I now my leader's track not loth pursued;  And each had shown how light we far'd along  When thus he warn'd me: \"Bend thine eyesight down:  For thou to ease the way shall find it good  To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet.\"    As in memorial of the buried, drawn  Upon earth-level tombs, the sculptur'd form  Of what was once, appears (at sight whereof  Tears often stream forth by remembrance wak'd,  Whose sacred stings the piteous only feel),  So saw I there, but with more curious skill  Of portraiture o'erwrought, whate'er of space  From forth the mountain stretches.  On one part  Him I beheld, above all creatures erst  Created noblest, light'ning fall from heaven:  On th' other side with bolt celestial pierc'd  Briareus: cumb'ring earth he lay through dint  Of mortal ice-stroke.  The Thymbraean god  With Mars, I saw, and Pallas, round their sire,  Arm'd still, and gazing on the giant's limbs  Strewn o'er th' ethereal field.  Nimrod I saw:  At foot of the stupendous work he stood,  As if bewilder'd, looking on the crowd  Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar's plain.    O Niobe! in what a trance of woe  Thee I beheld, upon that highway drawn,  Sev'n sons on either side thee slain!  Saul!  How ghastly didst thou look! on thine own sword  Expiring in Gilboa, from that hour  Ne'er visited with rain from heav'n or dew!    O fond Arachne! thee I also saw  Half spider now in anguish crawling up  Th' unfinish'd web thou weaved'st to thy bane!    O Rehoboam! here thy shape doth seem  Louring no more defiance! but fear-smote  With none to chase him in his chariot whirl'd.    Was shown beside upon the solid floor  How dear Alcmaeon forc'd his mother rate  That ornament in evil hour receiv'd:  How in the temple on Sennacherib fell  His sons, and how a corpse they left him there.

Troy I mark'd  In ashes and in caverns.  Oh! how fall'n,  How abject, Ilion, was thy semblance there!    What master of the pencil or the style  Had trac'd the shades and lines, that might have made  The subtlest workman wonder?

It is a novelty in the      history of a society to see a calm and scrutinizing eye turned upon      itself, when apprised by the legislature that the wheels of      government are stopped; to see it carefully examine the extent of      the field and patiently wait for two years until a remedy was      discovered, which it voluntarily adopted, without having ever wrung      a tear or a drop of blood from mankind.\"          _II. The Great Convention_      Now follows a notable and yet little known scene in the drama of  history. It reveals a people who, without shedding a drop of blood,  calmly and deliberately abolished one government, substituted another,  and erected it upon foundations which have hitherto proved enduring.  Even the superstructure slowly erected upon these foundations has  suffered little change in the most changing period of the world's  history, and until recently its additions, few in number, have varied  little from the plans of the original architects. The Constitution is  to-day, not a ruined Parthenon, but rather as one of those Gothic  masterpieces, against which the storms of passionate strife have beaten  in vain. The foundations were laid at a time when disorder was rampant  and anarchy widely prevalent. As I have already shown in my first  lecture, credit was gone, business paralysed, lawlessness triumphant,  and not only between class and class, but between State and State, there  were acute controversies and an alarming disunity of spirit. To weld  thirteen jealous and discordant States, demoralized by an exhausting  war, into a unified and efficient nation against their wills, was a  seemingly impossible task. Frederick the so-called Great had said that a  federal union of widely scattered communities was impossible. Its final  accomplishment has blinded the world to the essential difficulty of the  problem.    The time was May 25, 1787; the place, the State House in Philadelphia, a  little town of not more than 20,000 people, and, at that time, as  remote, measured by the facilities of communication, to the centres of  civilization as is now Vladivostok.    The _dramatis personae_ in this drama, though few in numbers, were,  however, worthy of the task.    Seventy-two had originally been offered or given credentials, for each  State was permitted to send as many delegates as it pleased, inasmuch as  the States were to vote in the convention as units. Of these, the  greatest actual attendance was fifty-five, and at the end of the  convention a saving remnant of only thirty-nine remained to finish a  work which was to immortalize its participants.    While this notable group of men contained a few merchants, financiers,  farmers, doctors, educators, and soldiers, of the remainder, at least  thirty-one were lawyers, and of these many had been justices of the  local courts and executive officers of the commonwealths. Four had  studied in the Inner Temple, at least five in the Middle Temple, one at  Oxford under the tuition of Blackstone and two in Scottish Universities.  Few of them were inexperienced in public affairs, for of the original  fifty-five members, thirty-nine had been members of the first or second  Continental Congresses, and eight had already helped to frame the  constitutions of their respective States. At least twenty-two were  college graduates, of whom nine were graduates of Princeton, three of  Yale, two of Harvard, four of William and Mary, and one each from the  Universities of Oxford, Columbia, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. A few already  enjoyed world-wide fame, notably Doctor Franklin, possibly the most  versatile genius of the eighteenth century and universally known and  honoured as a scientist, philosopher, and diplomat, and George  Washington, whose fame, even at that day, had filled the world with the  noble purity of his character.    It was a convention of comparatively young men, the average age being  little above forty. Franklin was the oldest member, being then  eighty-one; Dayton, the youngest, being twenty-seven. With the  exception of Franklin and Washington, most of the potential  personalities in the convention were under forty. Thus, James Madison,  who contributed so largely to the plan that he is sometimes called \"The  Father of the Constitution,\" was thirty-six. Charles Pinckney, who,  unaided, submitted the first concrete draft of the Constitution, was  only twenty-nine, and Alexander Hamilton, who was destined to take a  leading part in securing its ratification by his powerful oratory and  his very able commentaries in the Federalist papers, was only thirty.    Above all they were a group of gentlemen of substance and honour, who  could debate for four months during the depressing weather of a hot  summer without losing their tempers, except momentarily--and this  despite vital differences--and who showed that genius for toleration and  reconciliation of conflicting views inspired by a common fidelity to a  great objective that is the highest mark of statesmanship. They  represented the spirit of representative government at its best in  avoiding the cowardice of time-servers and the low cunning of  demagogues. All apparently were inspired by a fine spirit of  self-effacement. Selfish ambition was conspicuously absent. They  differed, at times heatedly, but always as gentlemen of candour and  honour. The very secrecy of their deliberations, of which I shall  presently speak, is ample proof how indifferent they were to popular  applause and the _civium ardor prava jubentium_.    The convention had been slow in assembling. Ample notice had been given  that it would convene on May 13, 1787, but when that day arrived a mere  handful of the delegates, less than a quorum, had assembled.    The Virginia delegation, six in number, and forming probably the ablest  delegation from any State, arriving in time, and failing to find a  quorum then assembled, employed the period of waiting in submitting to  the Pennsylvania delegation the outlines of a plan for the new  Constitution. The plan was largely the work of James Madison, and how  long it had been in preparation cannot be definitely stated. It is clear  that four years before a Philadelphia merchant, one Peletiah Webster,  had published a brochure proposing a scheme of dual sovereignty, under  which the citizens would owe a double allegiance--one to the constituent  States within the sphere of their reserved powers, and one to a  federated government within the sphere of its delegated powers. Leagues  of States had often existed, but a league which, within a prescribed  sphere, would have direct authority over the citizens of the constituent  States, without, however, abolishing the authority of such States as to  their reserved sphere of power, was a novel theory. How far the Virginia  project had been influenced by Webster's suggestion is not clear, but it  is certain that before the convention met Pennsylvania and Virginia,  two of the most powerful States, were committed to it.    The suggestion was a radical one, for the States, with few exceptions,  were chiefly insistent upon the preservation of their sovereignty, and  while they were willing to amend the Articles of Confederation by giving  fuller authority to the central government, such as it was, the  suggestion of subordinating the States to a new sovereign power, whose  authority within circumscribed limits was to be supreme, was opposed to  all their conventions and traditions. Washington, however, had warmly  welcomed the creation of a strong central government, and his  correspondence with the leading men of the colonies for some years  previously had been burdened with arguments to convince them that a mere  league of States would not suffice to create a stable nation. To George  Washington, soldier and statesman, is due above all men the ideal of a  federated union, for without his influence--that of a noble and  unselfish leader--the great result would probably never have been  secured. While still waiting for the convention, to meet, and while  discussing what was expedient and practicable when they did meet,  Washington one day said to a group of delegates, who were considering  the acute nature of the crisis:        \"It is too probable that no plan that we propose will be adopted.      Perhaps another dreadful conflict is to be sustained. If, to please      the people, we offer what we ourselves disapprove, how can we      afterwards defend our work? Let us raise a standard to which the      wise and just can repair. The event is in the hand of God.\"    Noble words, fit to be written in letters of gold over the portal of  every legislature of the world, and it was in this spirit that the  convention finally convened on May 25th, 1787.    When the delegates from nine States had assembled, Washington was  unanimously elected the presiding officer of the convention. It began by  adopting rules of order, and the most significant of these was the  provision for secrecy. No copy should be taken of any entry on the  Journal, or even permission given to inspect it, without leave of the  convention, and \"nothing spoken in the house be printed or otherwise  published or communicated without leave.\" The yeas and nays should not  be recorded. The rule of secrecy was enlarged by an unwritten  understanding that, even when the convention had adjourned, no  disclosure should be made of its proceedings during the life of its  members. When after nearly four months, the convention adjourned, the  secret had been kept, and no one knew even the concrete result of its  deliberations until the Constitution itself, and nothing else, was  offered to the approval of the people. The high-way, upon which the  State House fronted, was covered with earth, to deaden the noise of  traffic, and sentries were posted at every means of ingress and egress,  to"]]]
