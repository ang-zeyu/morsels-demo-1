[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6985"],[0,"A Prefect's Uncle (#6)"],[1,"  had rather diverted the public eye from this performance. Then the  School had played the Emeriti, and had won again quite comfortably.  This time his score had been forty-one, useful, but still not  phenomenal. Then in the third match, _versus_ Charchester, one of  the big school matches of the season, he had found himself. He ran up a  hundred and twenty-three without a chance, and felt that life had  little more to offer. That had been only a week ago, and the glow of  satisfaction was still pleasantly warm.    It was while he was gloating silently in his study over the bat with  which a grateful Field Sports Committee had presented him as a reward  for this feat, that he became aware that Lorimer, his study companion,  appeared to be in an entirely different frame of mind to his own.  Lorimer was in the Upper Fifth, Pringle in the Remove. Lorimer sat at  the study table gnawing a pen in a feverish manner that told of an  overwrought soul. Twice he uttered sounds that were obviously sounds of  anguish, half groans and half grunts. Pringle laid down his bat and  decided to investigate.    'What's up?' he asked.    'This bally poem thing,' said Lorimer.    'Poem? Oh, ah, I know.' Pringle had been in the Upper Fifth himself a  year before, and he remembered that every summer term there descended  upon that form a Bad Time in the shape of a poetry prize. A certain  Indian potentate, the Rajah of Seltzerpore, had paid a visit to the  school some years back, and had left behind him on his departure  certain monies in the local bank, which were to be devoted to providing  the Upper Fifth with an annual prize for the best poem on a subject to  be selected by the Headmaster. Entrance was compulsory. The wily  authorities knew very well that if it had not been, the entries for the  prize would have been somewhat small. Why the Upper Fifth were so  favoured in preference to the Sixth or Remove is doubtful. Possibly it  was felt that, what with the Jones History, the Smith Latin Verse, the  Robinson Latin Prose, and the De Vere Crespigny Greek Verse, and other  trophies open only to members of the Remove and Sixth, those two forms  had enough to keep them occupied as it was. At any rate, to the Upper  Fifth the prize was given, and every year, three weeks after the  commencement of the summer term, the Bad Time arrived.    'Can't you get on?' asked Pringle.    'No.'    'What's the subject?'    'Death of Dido.'    'Something to be got out of that, surely.'    'Wish you'd tell me what.'    'Heap of things.'    'Such as what? Can't see anything myself. I call it perfectly indecent  dragging the good lady out of her well-earned tomb at this time of day.  I've looked her up in the Dic. of Antiquities, and it appears that she  committed suicide some years ago. Body-snatching, I call it. What do I  want to know about her?'    'What's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba?' murmured Pringle.    'Hecuba?' said Lorimer, looking puzzled, 'What's Hecuba got to do with  it?'    'I was only quoting,' said Pringle, with gentle superiority.    'Well, I wish instead of quoting rot you'd devote your energies to  helping me with these beastly verses. How on earth shall I begin?'    'You might adapt my quotation. \"What's Dido got to do with me, or I to  do with Dido?\" I rather like that. Jam it down. Then you go on in a  sort of rag-time metre. In the \"Coon Drum-Major\" style. Besides, you  see, the beauty of it is that you administer a wholesome snub to the  examiner right away. Makes him sit up at once. Put it down.'    Lorimer bit off another quarter of an inch of his pen. 'You needn't be  an ass,' he said shortly.    'My dear chap,' said Pringle, enjoying himself immensely, 'what on  earth is the good of my offering you suggestions if you won't take  them?'    Lorimer said nothing. He bit off another mouthful of penholder.    'Well, anyway,' resumed Pringle. 'I can't see why you're so keen on the  business. Put down anything. The beaks never make a fuss about these  special exams.'    'It isn't the beaks I care about,' said Lorimer in an injured tone of  voice, as if someone had been insinuating that he had committed some  crime, 'only my people are rather keen on my doing well in this exam.'    'Why this exam, particularly?'    'Oh, I don't know. My grandfather or someone was a bit of a pro at  verse in his day, I believe, and they think it ought to run in the  family.'    Pringle examined the situation in all its aspects. 'Can't you get  along?' he enquired at length.    'Not an inch.'    'Pity. I wish we could swop places.'    'So do I for some things. To start with, I shouldn't mind having made  that century of yours against Charchester.'    Pringle beamed. The least hint that his fellow-man was taking him at  his own valuation always made him happy.    'Thanks,' he said. 'No, but what I meant was that I wished I was in for  this poetry prize. I bet I could turn out a rattling good screed. Why,  last year I almost got the prize. I sent in fearfully hot stuff.'    'Think so?' said Lorimer doubtfully, in answer to the 'rattling good  screed' passage of Pringle's speech. 'Well, I wish you'd have a shot.  You might as well.'    'What, really? How about the prize?'    'Oh, hang the prize. We'll have to chance that.'    'I thought you were keen on getting it.'    'Oh, no. Second or third will do me all right, and satisfy my people.  They only want to know for certain that I've got the poetic afflatus  all right. Will you take it on?'    'All right.'    'Thanks, awfully.'    'I say, Lorimer,' said Pringle after a pause.    'Yes?'    'Are your people coming down for the O.B.s' match?'    The Old Beckfordians' match was the great function of the Beckford  cricket season. The Headmaster gave a garden-party. The School band  played; the School choir sang; and sisters, cousins, aunts, and parents  flocked to the School in platoons.    'Yes, I think so,' said Lorimer. 'Why?'    'Is your sister coming?'    'Oh, I don't know.' A brother's utter lack of interest in his sister's  actions is a weird and wonderful thing for an outsider to behold.    'Well, look here, I wish you'd get her to come. We could give them tea  in here, and have rather a good time, don't you think?'    'All right. I'll make her come. Look here, Pringle, I believe you're  rather gone on Mabel.'    This was Lorimer's vulgar way.    'Don't be an ass,' said Pringle, with a laugh which should have been  careless, but was in reality merely feeble. 'She's quite a kid.'    Miss Mabel Lorimer's exact age was fifteen. She had brown hair, blue  eyes, and a smile which disclosed to view a dimple. There are worse  things than a dimple. Distinctly so, indeed. When ladies of fifteen  possess dimples, mere man becomes but as a piece of damp  blotting-paper. Pringle was seventeen and a half, and consequently too  old to take note of such frivolous attributes; but all the same he had  a sort of vague, sketchy impression that it would be pleasanter to run  up a lively century against the O.B.s with Miss Lorimer as a spectator  than in her absence. He felt pleased that she was coming.    'I say, about this poem,' said Lorimer, dismissing a subject which  manifestly bored him, and returning to one which was of vital interest,  'you're sure you can write fairly decent stuff? It's no good sending in  stuff that'll turn the examiner's hair grey. Can you turn out something  really decent?'    Pringle said nothing. He smiled gently as who should observe, 'I and  Shakespeare.'          [5]    FARNIE GETS INTO TROUBLE--      It was perhaps only natural that Farnie, having been warned so strongly  of the inadvisability of having anything to do with Monk, should for  that very reason be attracted to him. Nobody ever wants to do anything  except what they are not allowed to do. Otherwise there is no  explaining the friendship that arose between them. Jack Monk was not an  attractive individual. He had a slack mouth and a shifty eye, and his  complexion was the sort which friends would have described as olive,  enemies (with more truth) as dirty green. These defects would have  mattered little, of course, in themselves. There's many a bilious  countenance, so to speak, covers a warm heart. With Monk, however,  appearances were not deceptive. He looked a bad lot, and he was one.    It was on the second morning of term that the acquaintanceship began.  Monk was coming downstairs from his study with Danvers, and Farnie was  leaving the fags' day-room.    'See that kid?' said Danvers. 'That's the chap I was telling you about.  Gethryn's uncle, you know.'    'Not really? Let's cultivate him. I say, old chap, don't walk so fast.'  Farnie, rightly concluding that the remark was addressed to him, turned  and waited, and the three strolled over to the School buildings  together.    They would have made an interesting study for the observer of human  nature, the two seniors fancying that they had to deal with a small boy  just arrived at his first school, and in the grip of that strange, lost  feeling which attacks the best of new boys for a day or so after their  arrival; and Farnie, on the other hand, watching every move, as  perfectly composed and at home as a youth should be with the experience  of three public schools to back him up.    When they arrived at the School gates, Monk and Danvers turned to go in  the direction of their form-room, the Remove, leaving Farnie at the  door of the Upper Fourth. At this point a small comedy took place.  Monk, after feeling hastily in his pockets, requested Danvers to lend  him five shillings until next Saturday. Danvers knew this request of  old, and he knew the answer that was expected of him. By replying that  he was sorry, but he had not got the money, he gave Farnie, who was  still standing at the door, his cue to offer to supply the deficiency.  Most new boys--they had grasped this fact from experience--would have  felt it an honour to oblige a senior with a small loan."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6986"],[0,"Hygienic Physiology : with Special Reference to the Use of Alcoholic Drinks and (#6)"],[1," strength of the  bones?    18.

A Ganglion.    FIG. 14.    [Illustration]    THE MUSCLES.    THE USE OF THE MUSCLES.--The skeleton is the image of death. Its unsightly  appearance instinctively repels us. We have seen, however, what uses it  subserves in the body, and how the ugly-looking bones abound in nice  contrivances and ingenious workmanship. In life, the framework is hidden  by the flesh. This covering is a mass of muscles, which by their  arrangement and their properties not only give form and symmetry to the  body, but also produce its varied movements.    In Fig. 14, we see the large exterior muscles. Beneath these are many  others; while deeply hidden within are tiny, delicate ones, too small to  be seen with the naked eye. There are, in all, about five hundred, each  having its special use, and all working in exquisite harmony and  perfection.    CONTRACTILITY.--The peculiar property of the muscles is their power of  contraction, whereby they decrease in length and increase in thickness.  [Footnote: The maximum force of this contraction has been estimated as  high as from eighty-five to one hundred and fourteen pounds per square  inch.] This may be caused by an effort of the will, by cold, by a sharp  blow, etc. It does not cease at death, but, in certain cold-blooded  animals, a contraction of the muscles is often noticed long after the head  has been cut off.    ARRANGEMENT OF THE MUSCLES. [Footnote: \"Could we behold properly the  muscular fibers in operation, nothing, as a mere mechanical exhibition,  can be conceived more superb than the intricate and combined actions that  must take place during our most common movements. Look at a person running  or leaping, or watch the motions of the eye. How rapid, how delicate, how  complicated, and yet how accurate, are the motions required! Think of the  endurance of such a muscle as the heart, that can contract, with a force  equal to sixty pounds, seventy-five times every minute, for eighty years  together, without being weary.\"]--The muscles are nearly all arranged in  pairs, each with its antagonist, so that, as they contract and expand  alternately, the bone to which they are attached is moved to and fro. (See  p. 275.)    If you grasp the arm tightly with your hand just above the elbow joint,  and bend the forearm, you will feel the muscle on the inside (biceps,  _a_, Fig. 14) swell, and become hard and prominent, while the outside  muscle (triceps, _f_) will be relaxed. Now straighten the arm, and  the swelling and hardness of the inside muscle will vanish, while the  outside one will, in turn, become rigid. So, also, if you clasp the arm  just below the elbow, and then open and shut the fingers, you can feel the  alternate expanding and relaxing of the muscles on opposite sides of the  arms.    If the muscles on one side of the face become palsied, those on the other  side will draw the mouth that way. Squinting is caused by one of the  straight muscles of the eye (Fig. 17) contracting more strongly than its  antagonist.    KINDS OF MUSCLES.--There are two kinds of muscles, the _voluntary_,  which are under the control of our will, and the _involuntary_,  which are not. Thus our limbs stiffen or relax as we please, but the  heart beats on by day and by night. The eyelid, however, is both  voluntary and involuntary, so that while we wink constantly without  effort, we can, to a certain extent, restrain or control the motion.    STRUCTURE OF THE MUSCLES.--If we take a piece of lean beef and wash out  the red color, we can easily detect the fine fibers of which the meat is  composed. In boiling corned beef for the table, the fibers often separate,  owing to the dissolving of the delicate tissue which bound them together.  By means of the microscope, we find that these fibers are made up of  minute filaments (_fibrils_), and that each fibril is composed of a  row of small cells arranged like a string of beads. This gives the muscles  a peculiar striped (striated) appearance. [Footnote: The involuntary  muscles consist generally of smooth, fibrous tissue, and form sheets or  membranes in the walls of hollow organs. By their contraction they change  the size of cavities which they inclose. Some functions, however, like the  action of the heart, or the movements of deglutition (swallowing), require  the rapid, vigorous contraction, characteristic of the voluntary muscular  tissue--FLINT.] (See p. 276.) The cells are filled with a fluid or  semifluid mass of living (protoplasmic) matter.    FIG. 15.    [Illustration: _Microscopic view of a Muscle, showing, at one end, the  fibrillæ; and, at the other, the disks, or cells, of the fiber._]    The binding of so many threads into one bundle [Footnote: We shall learn  hereafter how these fibers are firmly tied together by a mesh of fine  connective tissue which dissolves in boiling, as just described] confers  great strength, according to a mechanical principle that we see  exemplified in suspension bridges, where the weight is sustained, not by  bars of iron, but by small wires twisted into massive ropes.    FIG. 16.    [Illustration: _Tendons of the Hand._]    THE TENDONS.--The ends of the muscles are generally attached to the bone  by strong, flexible, but inelastic tendons. [Footnote: The tendons may be  easily seen in the leg of a turkey as it comes on our table; so we may  study Physiology while we pick the bones.] The muscular fibers spring from  the sides of the tendon, so that more of them can act upon the bone than  if they went directly to it. Besides, the small, insensible tendon can  better bear the exposure of passing over a joint, and be more easily  lodged in some protecting groove, than the broad, sensitive muscle. This  mode of attachment gives to the limbs strength, and elegance of form.  Thus, for example, if the large muscles of the arm extended to the hand,  they would make it bulky and clumsy. The tendons, however, reach only to  the wrist, whence fine cords pass to the fingers (Fig. 16).    Here we notice two other admirable arrangements. 1. If the long tendons at  the wrist on contracting should rise, projections would be made and thus  the beauty of the slender joint be marred. To prevent this, a stout band  or bracelet of ligament holds them down to their place. 2. In order to  allow the tendon which moves the last joint of the finger to pass through,  the tendon which moves the second joint divides at its attachment to the  bone (Fig. 16). This is the most economical mode of packing the muscles,  as any other practicable arrangement would increase the bulk of the  slender finger.    FIG. 17.    [Illustration: _Muscles of the Right Eye:_ A, _superior  straight,_ B, _superior oblique passing through a pulley,_ D; G,  _inferior oblique,_ H, _external straight, and, back of it, the  internal straight muscle._]    Since the tendon can not always pull in the direction of the desired  motion, some contrivance is necessary to meet the want. The tendon (B)  belonging to one of the muscles of the eye, for example, passes through a  ring of cartilage, and thus a rotary motion is secured.    FIG. 18.    [Illustration: _The three classes of Levers, and also the foot as a  Lever._]    THE LEVERS OF THE BODY. [Footnote: A _lever_ is a stiff bar resting  on a point of support, called the _fulcrum_ (_F_), and having connected  with it a _weight_ (_W_) to be lifted, and a _power_ (_P_) to move it.  There are three classes of levers according to the arrangement of the  power, weight, and fulcrum. In the first class, the _F_ is between the  _P_ and _W_; in the second, the _W_ is between the _P_ and _F_; and in  the third, the _P_ is between the _W_ and _F_ (Fig. 18). A pump handle  is "]]]
