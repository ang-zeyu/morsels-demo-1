Taking him in the  aggregate we are of opinion that he is a good preacher; that he goes  through his ordinary duties easily and complacently. He gets well  paid for what be does--last year his salary exceeded 340 pounds; and  our advice to him is--keep on good terms with the bulk of \"the  brethren,\" hammer as much piety into them as possible, tickle the  deacons into a genial humour, and look regularly after the pew-  rents.        No. IV.        LUNE-STREET WESLEYAN METHODIST CHAPEL.        Wesleyan Methodism first breathed and opened its eyes in or about  the year 1729. It was nursed in its infancy at Oxford by two rare  brothers and a few students; was christened at the same place by a  keenly-observing, slightly-satirical collegian; developed itself  gradually through the country; took charge of the neglected masses  and gave them a new life; and today it is one of the great religious  forces of the world. The first Wesleyan chapel in Preston was built  in the year 1787, and its situation was in that consecrated and  highly aromatic region of the town called Back-lane. There was  nothing very prepossessing or polished, nothing particularly  fashionable or attractive about the profession of Methodism in those  days. It was rather an indication of honest fanaticism than of  deliberate reasoning--rather a sign of being solemnly \"on the  rampage\" than of giving way to careful conviction--and more  symptomatic of a sharp virtuous rant, got up in a crack and to be  played out in five minutes, than of a judicious move in the  direction of permanent good. The orthodox looked down with a genteel  contempt upon the preachers whose religion had converted Kingswood  colliers, and turned Cornwall wreckers into honest men; and the  formally pious spoke of the worshippers at this new shrine of faith  with a serene sneer, and classed them as a parcel of fiercely  ejaculating, hymn-singing nonentities. But there was vitality at the  core of their creed, and its fuller triumphs were but a question of  time. In 1817, Methodism became dissatisfied with its Back-lane  quarters, and migrated into a lighter, healthier, and cleaner  portion of the town--Lune-street--where a building was erected for  its special convenience and edification. It was not a very elegant  structure:  it was, in fact, a plain, phlegmatic aggregation of  brick and mortar, calculated to charm no body externally, and  evidently patronised for absolute internal rapture.    In 1861 the chapel was rebuilt--enlarged, beautified, and made fine,  so as to harmonise with the laws of modern fashion, and afford easy  sitting room for the large and increasing congregation attending it.  The frontispiece is of a costly character; but it has really been  \"born to blush unseen.\" It is so tightly wedged in between other  buildings, is so evenly crammed into companionship with the ordinary  masonry of the street, that the general effect of the tall arch and  spacious porch is lost. Nothing can be distinctly seen at even a  moderate distance. You have to get to the place before you become  clearly aware of its existence; and if you wish to know anything of  its appearance, you have either to turn the head violently off its  regular axis, or cross the street and ask somebody for a step  ladder. The facade of the building is not very prepossessing; the  large arch, which has given way at some of the joints considerably,  and has been doing its best to fall for about six years, does not  look well--it is too high and too big for the place; the stonework  within is also hid; and the whitewashed ceiling above ought to be  either cleaned or made properly black. At present it is neither  light nor dark, and is rather awkwardly relieved at intervals with  cobwebs. There is something humorous and incongruous in the physical  associations of this chapel. It is flanked with a doctor's shop and  a money-lending establishment; with a savings bank and a solicitor's  office. The bank nestles very complacently under its lower wing, and  in the ratio of its size is a much better looking building. The text  regarding the deposit of treasure in that place where neither moth  nor rust operate may be well worked in the chapel; but it is rather  at a discount in the immediate neighbourhood.    A great work in the business of spreading Wesleyan Methodism has  been done by the people and parsons of Lune-street chapel. We know  of no place in the town whose religious influence has been more  actively radiated. Its power, a few years ago, spread into the  northern part of the town, and the result was a new chapel with  excellent schools there; it then moved eastward, and the consequence  was a school chapel in St. Mary-street. In Croft-street, Canal-  street, and on the Marsh, it has also outposts, whose officers are  fighting the good fight with lung, and head, and heart, in a  sprightly and vigorous fashion. Originally, what is termed the  \"circuit\" of Lune-street embraced places 18 or 20 miles from  Preston; but the area of the sacred circumbendibus was subsequently  reduced; and its servants now find that they have as much on hand as  they can fairly get through by looking after half of the town and a  few of the contiguous villages. There are none of those solemn  milkmen called deacons in connection with Wesleyanism; still, there  are plenty of medicine men, up; up the ears in grace and business,  belonging it. At Lune-street Chapel, as at all similar places, there  are class-leaders, circuit stewards, chapel stewards, and smaller  divinities, who find a niche in the general pantheon of duty. The  cynosure of the inner circle is personal piety, combined with a  \"penny a week and a shilling a quarter.\" All members who can pay  this have to do so.    Beneath the chapel there is a Sunday school, which operates as a  feeder. When the scholars--there are 500 or 600 of them altogether--  show certain symptoms of inherent rectitude and facial exactness,  when they answer particular questions correctly and pass through the  crucial stages of probation consistently, they are drafted into \"the  church,\" and presented with licences of perennial happiness if they  choose to exercise them. The school is well supervised, and if some  of the teachers are as useful and consoling at home as they are in  their classes their general relatives will be blissful.    The congregation of Lune-street Chapel is moderately numerous; but  it has been materially thinned at intervals by the establishment of  other Wesleyan chapels. In its circuit there are now between 800 and  900 persons known as members, who are going on their way rejoicing;  at the chapel itself there are between 300 and 400 individuals  similarly situated. Viewed in the aggregate, the congregation is of  a middle class character both in regard to the colour of the hair  and the clothes worn. There are some exceedingly poor people at the  place, but the mass appear to be individuals not particularly  hampered in making provision for their general meals. Lune-street  chapel is the fashionable Wesleyan tabernacle of Preston; the better  end of those whose minds have been touched, through either tradition  or actual conviction, with the beauties of Methodism, frequent it.  There is more silk than winsey, more cloth than hodden grey, and a  good deal more false hair and artificial teeth in the building on a  Sunday than can be found by fair searching at any other Wesleyan  chapel in the town. A sincere desire to \"flee from the wrath to come  and be saved from their sins\"--the only condition which John Wesley  insisted upon for admission into his societies--does not prevent  some of the members from attending determinedly to the bedizenments,  conceits, and spangles of this very wicked speck in the planetary  system.    In the congregation there are many most excellent, hardworking,  thoroughly sincere men and women, who would be both useful and  ornamental to any body of Christians under the sun; but there are in  addition, as there are in every building set apart for the purposes  of piety, several who have \"more frill than shirt,\" and much \"more  cry than wool\" about them--rectified, beautifully self-righteous,  children who would \"sugar over\" a very ugly personage ten hours out  of the twelve every day, and then at night thank the Lord for all  his mercies. In Lune-street Chapel faction used to run high and  wilfulness was a gem which many of the members wore very near their  hearts; but much of the old feudal spirit of party fighting has died  out, and there are signs of pious resignation and loving kindness in  the flock, which would at one time have been rare jewels. A somewhat  lofty isolation is still manifested here and there; a few regular  attenders appear heavily oppressed with the idea that they are not  only as good as anybody else but much better. Still this is only  human nature and no process of convertibility to the most celestial  of substances can in this world entirely subdue it. The bruising  deacon who said that grace was a good thing, but that that knocking  down an impertinent member was a better didn't miss the bull's eye  of natural philosophy very far. The observation was not redolent of  much Christian spirit; but it evinced that which many of the saints  are troubled with--human nature.    Lune-street chapel contains standing, sitting, and sleeping room,  for about 1,400 people. The bulk who attend it take fair advantage  of the accomodation afforded for the first and second positions; a  moderate number avail themselves of the privileges held out for the  whole three postures. The chapel is not often crowded; it is  moderately filled as a rule; and there is no particular numeric  difference in the attendance at either morning or evening service on  a Sunday. The singing is neither loftily classic nor contemptibly  common-place. It is good, medium, well modulated melody, heartily  got up; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10484"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 03: Ancient Achievements (#7)"],[1," witnesses were required; and the ordinary  formalities were dispensed with among soldiers in actual service, and  during the prevalence of pestilence. The testament was opened in the  presence of the witnesses, or a majority of them; and after they had  acknowledged their seals a copy was made, and the original was deposited  in the public archives.    According to the Twelve Tables, the powers of a testator in disposing  of his property were unlimited; but in process of time, laws were  enacted to restrain immoderate or unnatural bequests. By the Falcidian  law, in the time of Augustus, no one could leave in legacies more than  three fourths of his estate, so that the heirs could inherit at least  one fourth. Again, a law was passed by which the descendants were  entitled to one third of the succession, and to one half if there were  more than four. In France, if a man die leaving one lawful child, he can  dispose of only half his estate by will; if he leaves two children, he  can dispose only of one third; if he leaves three or more children, then  he can dispose by will of only one fourth of his estate. In England, a  man can disinherit both his wife and children. These, and many other  matters,--bequests in trust, succession of men dying intestate, heirs at  law, etc.,--were regulated by the Romans in ways on which our modern  legislators have improved little or none.    In the matter of contracts the Roman law was especially comprehensive,  and the laws of France and Scotland are substantially based upon the  Roman system. The Institutes of Gaius and Justinian distinguish four  sorts of obligations,--_aut re, aut verbis, aut literis, aut consensu_.  Gibbon, in his learned chapter, prefers to consider the specific  obligations of men to each other under promises, benefits, and  injuries. Lord Mackenzie treats the subject in the order of the  Institutes:--    \"Obligations contracted _re_--by the intervention of _things_--are  called by the moderns real contracts, because they are not perfected  till something has passed from one party to another. Of this description  are the contracts of loan, deposit, and pledge,--security for  indebtedness. Till the subject is actually lent, deposited, or pledged,  it does not form the special contract of loan, deposit, or pledge.\"    Next to the perfection of contracts by _re_,--the intervention of  things,--were obligations contracted by _verbis_, spoken _words_, and by  _literis_, or writings. The _verborum obligatio_ was contracted by  uttering certain words of formal style,--an interrogation being put by  one party, and an answer given by the other. These stipulations were  binding. In England all guarantees must be in writing.    The _obligatio literis_ was a written acknowledgment of debt, chiefly  employed when money was borrowed; but the creditor could not sue upon a  note within two years from its date, without being called upon also to  prove that the money was in fact paid to the debtor.    Contracts perfected by consent, _consensu_, had reference to sale,  hiring; partnership, and mandate, or orders to be carried out by agents.  All contracts of sale were good without writing.    Acts which caused damage to another opened a new class of cases. The  law obliged the wrong-doer to make reparation, and this responsibility  extended to damages arising not only from positive acts, but from  negligence or imprudence. In cases of libel or slander, the truth of the  allegation might be pleaded in justification. In all cases it was  necessary to show that an injury had been committed maliciously; but if  damage arose in the exercise of a right, as killing a slave in  self-defence, no claim for reparation could be maintained. If any one  exercised a profession or trade for which he was not qualified, he was  liable to all the damage his want of skill or knowledge might  occasion,--a provision that some of our modern laws might advantageously  revive. When any damage was done by a slave or an animal, the owner of  the same was liable for the loss, though the mischief was done without  his knowledge and against his will. If anything was thrown from a window  giving on the public thoroughfare so as to injure any one by the fall,  the occupier was bound to repair the damage, though done by a stranger.  Legal claims might be transferred to a third person by sale, exchange,  or donation; but to prevent speculators from purchasing debts at low  prices, it was ordered that the assignee should not be entitled to exact  from the debtor more than he himself had paid to acquire the debt, with  interest,--a wise and just regulation.    By the ancient constitution, the king had the prerogative of  determining civil causes. The right then devolved on the consuls,  afterward on the praetor, and in certain cases on the curule and  plebeian ediles, who were charged with the internal police of the city.    The praetor, a magistrate next in dignity to the consuls, acted as  supreme judge of the civil courts, assisted by a council of  jurisconsults to determine questions in law. At first one praetor was  sufficient, but as the limits of the city and empire extended, he was  joined by a colleague. After the conquest of Sicily, Sardinia, and the  two Spains, new praetors were appointed to administer justice in the  provinces. The praetor held his court in the comitium, wore a robe  bordered with purple, sat in a curule chair, and was attended  by lictors.    The praetor delegated his power to three classes of judges, called  respectively _judex_, _arbiter_, and _recuperator_. When parties were at  issue about facts, it was the custom for the praetor to fix the question  of law upon which the action turned, and then to remit to a delegate, or  judge, to inquire into the facts and pronounce judgment according to  them. In the time of Augustus there were four thousand judices, who were  merely private citizens, generally senators or men of consideration. The  judex was invested by the magistrate with a judicial commission for a  single case only. After being sworn to duty, he received from the  praetor a formula containing a summary of all the points under  litigation, from which he was not allowed to depart. He was required not  merely to investigate facts, but to give sentence; and as law questions  were more or less mixed up with the case, he was allowed to consult one  or more jurisconsults. If the case was beyond his power to decide, he  could decline to give judgment. The arbiter, like the judex, received a  formula from the praetor, and seemed to have more extensive power. The  recuperators heard and determined cases, but the number appointed for  each case was usually three or five.    The _centumvirs_ constituted a permanent tribunal composed of members  annually elected, in equal numbers, from each tribe; and this tribunal  was presided over by the praetor, and divided into four chambers, which  under the republic was placed under the ancient quaestors. The  centumvirs decided questions of property, embracing a wide range of  subjects. The Romans had no class of men like the judges of modern  times; the superior magistrates were changed annually, and political  duties were mixed with judicial. The evil was partially remedied by the  institution of legal assessors, selected from the most learned  jurisconsults. Under the empire the praetors were greatly increased;  under Tiberius there were sixteen who administered justice, besides the  consuls, six ediles, and ten tribunes of the people. The Emperor himself  became the supreme judge, and he was assisted in the discharge of his  judicial duties by a council composed of the consuls, a magistrate of  each grade, and fifteen senators. At first, the duties of the praetorian  prefects were purely military, but finally they discharged important  judicial functions. The prefect of the city, in the time of the  emperors, was a great judicial personage, who heard appeals from the  praetors themselves.    In all cases brought before the courts, the burden of proof was with the  party asserting an affirmative fact. Proof by writing was generally  considered most certain, but proof by witnesses was also admitted.  Pupils, lunatics, infamous persons, interested parties, near relatives,  and slaves could not bear evidence, nor any person who had a strong  enmity against either party. The witnesses were required to give their  testimony on oath. In most cases two witnesses were enough to prove a  fact. When witnesses gave conflicting testimony, the judge regarded  those who were most worthy of credit rather than those who were most  numerous. In the English courts the custom used to be as with the  Romans, of refusing testimony from those who were interested; but this  has been removed. On the failure of regular proof, the Roman law allowed  a party to refer the facts in a civil action to the oath of his  adversary.    Under the Roman republic there was no appeal in civil suits, but under  the emperors a regular system was established. Under Augustus there was  an appeal from all the magistrates to the prefect of the city, and from  him to the praetorian prefect or even to the Emperor. In the provinces  there was an appeal from the municipal magistrates to the governors, and  from them to the Emperor, as Paul appealed from Festus to Caesar. Under  Justinian no appeal was allowed from a suit which did not involve at  least twenty pounds in gold.    In regard to criminal courts among the Romans during the republic, the  only body which had absolute power of life and death was the _comitia  centuriata_. The senate had no jurisdiction in criminal cases, so far as  Roman citizens were concerned. It was only in extraordinary emergencies  that the senate, with the consuls, assumed the responsibility of  inflicting summary punishment. Under the emperors, the senate was armed  with the power of criminal jurisdiction; and as the senate was the tool  of the"]]]
