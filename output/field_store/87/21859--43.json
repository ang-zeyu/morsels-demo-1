Wood was a doctor (Harvard), who had won the  Medal of Honor riding in Roosevelt's Rough Riders in Cuba. He then  became Gov. Gen of Cuba at the turn of the century and helped Major  Walter Reed conduct his great research, leading to the control of  yellow fever. Later he became the only American medical officer to  ever become the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. I'll never forget how  he limped into the auditorium. Rumor had it that he had a wooden leg.    The Filipinos built a fire and soon had our evening meal ready.    As we ate, we could hear deer barking in the mountains, sounding like  a dog barking. I had never before known that deer made any kind of a  noise. As night approached and a full moon appeared over the  mountains, each Filipino selected a suitable cobble stone for use as a  pillow. I was satisfied with my small bundle of clothing.    Next morning we were up early, and in several hours had bagged a deer  and two wild boars. In the afternoon we hiked    several miles to the southeast to a river near Carranglan, where the  teniente threw in a stick or dynamite to stun the fish. Then we all  jumped in to capture several of the stunned fish. Each time I came up  from a surface dive, all of the Filipinos were laughing.    I asked the teniente, \"What is so funny?\" He replied, \"It is your  butt, sir! None of us had ever seen a white butt before, sir!\" I was  pleased to hear their laughter and was soon laughing myself. None of  us had had much to laugh at during the last couple months.    The cargadors (baggage carriers) had quite a struggle carrying the  game and fish on their backs over the mountain. I was amazed at their  strength and endurance, hour after hour.    We could hear the rumbling of the big guns on Bataan like distant  thunder. The evening radio reported a heavy artillery duel; also that  MacArthur had received an ultimatum from Gen. Homma, \"Gen. MacArthur,  you are doomed! I order you to surrender!\"    The next day we learned from Filipinos coming down from the north that  \"Guerrilla groups are forming in the Cagayan Valley!\"    Again we thanked the Red Line Bus Co. family for their hospitality and  courtesies. Traveling at night, because the Japanese occupied the  roads during the day, we were able to reach a small detachment of  soldiers guarding Balete Pass. We spent several hours, learning about  the troops at Bambang, Bayombong, Bagabag, and Jones.    The following day we made the long, hot and dusty hike to Bambang,  where we found a platoon of soldiers; they had destroyed several large  bridges across the Magat River to keep the Japanese cavalry from  making their daily excursions. The soldiers informed us that Major  Warner was the C.O. of the Guerrillas. Warner and I had to make a  survey of Camp Hay after the first bombing, looking for \"duds\" (bombs  that didn't go off). We found one dud that had brass fins on it made  out of an old T Ford radiator. We could still see the Ford imprint on  it.\"    After a good night's rest in a real bed, and a native breakfast, we  were off to Bagabag and Jones on the old dilapidated truck that must  have had 300,000 miles on it. We were soon passing through rice and  tobacco fields in the fertile Cagayan Valley.                                 Chapter III                     MACARTHUR'S FIRST GUERRILLA REGIMENT      We arrived at Jones just before dark; it appeared to be a more  prosperous barrio than we had seen. There were many nipa shacks, some  on stilts and some on the ground.    As we drove into headquarters area, we were greeted by Major Everett  Warner, the C.O., and Major Guillermo Nakar, the Executive Officer and  the C.O. of Headquarters Battalion. They both seemed pleased to have  an American medical officer in the regiment. I also met Captain Warren  Minton, C.O. of the 3rd Battalion, which included one squadron of  cavalry, and Captain Robert Arnold, in charge of communications. He  had brought a two-way radio from the northwest corner of Luzon, where  he was with the Air Warning Service. I was introduced to several other  American and Filipino officers, and then taken to the officers' mess  and fed. The regiment now numbered nearly 1500.    For quarters, I was assigned a small tobacco warehouse, where Major  Nakar would be my roommate. He slept in a full-sized brass bed; I  slept on bales of tobacco, Tobaccolera, the worlds finest. I didn't  smoke, but knew that many soldiers on Bataan were dying for a smoke.    Major Nakar was a short, \"smiling roly-poly Filipino officer, who  looked about thirty-five, with a big black mustache, curved up at the  ends, a twinkle in his black eyes-set deep in a small chubby face. He  liked to lay, propped up in bed, and read books about great military  leaders such as Napoleon, and the Filipino patriot and idol, Jose  Rizal.\" With a chuckle, he liked to quote Confucius: \"Make enemy think  you are far away when you are near! Make enemy think you are near when  you are far away!\"    About Nakar, Capt. Arnold remarked, \"He means to get ahead!\" After  knowing him for a few days, I began to get the feeling that he would  someday be President of the Philippines. I asked Major Nakar: \"How  come this barrio seems to be named, 'Jones,' after an American? I  don't know of any other named for an American.\"    He replied:    \"Dr. Jones was a professor from a California university. He came to  the Philippines many years ago to make some studies. He lived in this  vicinity for a long time. When he finished his work, he announced his  departure for the States. The local    Ilongots, an uncivilized tribe of headhunters living in this area,  told Dr. Jones, 'We have come to like you and respect you. We do not  want you to go, but to stay here with us!' Jones explained that he  liked them and appreciated their hospitality, but he had finished his  work and must return home.    \"With chilling logic, the Ilongots cut off Jones' head so that his  spirit might always remain, and named the barrio after him, Jones.\"    When I learned that \"Christian heads\" were at a premium, I always kept  my .45 and my newly acquired M-l rifle handy.    Supply System: A supply system was organized. Owners of rice mills,  farmers and politicians were cooperative-furnishing food, clothing,  equipment and even one-hundred small Filipino ponies for our cavalry  squadron. For these, they were willing to accept IOU notes-hopefully  to be honored by the government after the war.    Communications: A small nipa shack housed our two-way radio set up by  Captain Arnold. Contact was established with USAFFE HQ on Corregidor,  and a regular time set for transmission. News could be obtained  several times each day, making the shack a very popular place. A relay  telephone system using existing lines along the highway reached all  outposts.    Air Strip: Troops with the help of civilian labor constructed an air  strip in the vicinity of Jones, adequate for light planes. It was  concealed by placing several portable buildings on it. On two  occasions a light plane from Bataan dropped boxes of medicine,  ammunition and shoes. This bolstered our morale more than our  warehouses. General MacArthur became intensely interested in his first  Guerrilla Regiment, probably because things were not going well on  Bataan.    Medical Service: As former C.O. of the station hospital at Camp John  Hay, I became the Regimental Surgeon and organized a medical service  with one dental and four medical officers, all from the Philippine  Army, as my assistants. We had a dispensary at the Regimental HQ in  Jones and two small hospitals in abandoned schools in neighboring  barrios Minuri and Dibulwan hopefully out of bombing range.    In the absence of a regular source of medical supplies, our treatment  was often quite primitive. We were able to get some medicines and  surgical instruments from local hospitals, but only after the Japanese  had raided them. Local physicians and civilians    gave freely of their time and care.    Since malaria was prevalent in the Cagayan Valley, our anti-malarial  drugs were quickly consumed. Under the guidance of native officers,  the bark of certain tall trees was gathered and boiled in water. The  resulting extraction caused cessation of active malaria symptoms for a  few days, and then had to be repeated. A similar potion was made from  the bark of guava bushes, and was reputed to relieve diarrhea. We were  fortunate that most Filipinos seemed to have considerable immunity  against tropical diseases; our morbidity rates were low.    Our visits to the hospitals were frequently made on horseback.    As I rode along the trails, little Filipinos, noting my King George V  beard, often amused me by doffing their big straw hats, bowing low and  saying, \"Buenos Dias, Padre!\" For security reasons, and to keep rumors  to a minimum, many of our trips were made after dark.    When patrols were going our on the prowl, medical aid men went along,  carrying small amounts of medicines and bandages. Local physicians  were used whenever possible. Civilians were very good to our sick and  wounded, taking them into their homes and caring for them until they  could travel, in spite of threats by the Japs.    Efforts were made to care for all sick and wounded civilians in our  areas of operation. This paid dividends in many ways. It was the  friendliness of the Filipinos that paved the way for MacArthur's  eventual invasion of Luzon. Most of the time there was no question of  loyalty among the Filipinos.    Diet and Sanitation: Our diet was good-obtained from the fertile farms  and haciendas of the Cagayan Valley. When possible, water was obtained  from the deep wells in each barrio. Most Filipinos were familiar with  crude sand filter, made by digging shallow wells a few feet back on  river banks.    Pit latrines were dug whenever troops remained in an area for more  than a few hours. We had no venereal problems."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8452"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 363, December 16, 1882 (#6)"],[1,"resting rulers passes through  A. I draw the line C B which meets A B at the point B, the position  sought for the second needle. In order to draw the straight lines which  are under [alpha] [beta], it is only necessary to hold the needle A in  place and to fix one at B', making A B' = A B. In this case S\" indicates  one of the positions of the instrument.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.]    6. The point A was chosen arbitrarily, but it is evident that that of  the needles depends on its distance from the point of convergence. Thus,  on taking A' instead of A in the case of Fig. 3, they approach, while  the contrary happens on choosing the point A\". It is clear that the  different positions that a needle A may take are found on a straight  line which runs to the point of meeting.    7. If the instrument were jointed or hinged at C, that is to say, so  that we could at will modify the angle of the resting ruler, we might  make the position of the needles depend on such angle, and conversely.    8. Being given the length C I (Fig. 6), to establish the position of the  needles so that all the lines outside of the sheet shall converge at I.  To do this, it is well to determine C D, and then to draw the straight  line A D B perpendicular to C I, so as to have at A and B the points at  which the needles must be placed.

If the instrument is jointed, the absolute values being                _____________             /    AD = \\  /  CD(CI - CD) ,   (2)          \\/    [TEX: AD = \\sqrt{CD(CI - CD)}]    it suffices to take for CD a suitable value and to calculate AD.    If, for example, the value of C D is represented by C D', the instrument  takes the position A' C B', and the needles will be inserted at A' and  B' on the line A' D' B', which is perpendicular to C I.    10. If the position of the instrument, and consequently that of the  needles, has been established, and we wish to know the distance C I, we  will have               CD    CI = ------------ ;    (3)         cos squared[alpha]    [TEX: CI = \\frac{CD}{\\cos^2 \\alpha}]    or, again,             ___           AC squared    CI =  -----            (4)           CD'    [TEX: CI = \\frac{\\overline{AC^2}}{CD'}]    11. In order to avoid all calculation, we may proceed thus: If I wish to  arrange the instrument so that C I represents a given quantity (Sec. 8),  I take (Fig. 7) the length Ci = CI/n, where n is any entire number  whatever.    [Illustration: Fig. 7.]    In other terms, Ci is the reduction to the scale of CI.    I describe the circumference C b i a, and arrange the instrument as seen  in the figure, and measure the length C b.    It is visible that      C i     1     C b     C d   ----- = --- = ----- = ------; then C B = n.C b   (5)    C I     n     C B     C D      CD = n.C d;   (6)    and, consequently, the position of the needles which are found at A and  B are determined.    12. The question treated in Sec. 10, then, is simply solved. In fact, on  describing the circumference C b i a with any radius whatever, I shall  have           C B    n = -----;      (7)         c b    and, consequently,      C I = n.C i     (8)    13. As may be seen, the instrument composed of three firmly united  rulers is the simplest of all and easy to use. Any one can construct it  for himself with a piece of cardboard, and give the angle 2 [alpha] the  value that he thinks most suitable for each application. The greater  2 [alpha] is, the shorter is the distance at which we should put the  needles for a given point of meeting.    14 The jointed instrument may be constructed as shown in Figs 8, 9, and  10. The three pieces, A. B, and C, united by a pivot, O, in which there  is a small hole, are of brass or other metal. Rulers may be easily  procured of any length whatever. The instrument is Y-shaped. In the  particular case in which [alpha] = 180 deg. it becomes T-shaped, and serves  to draw parallel lines.    [Illustration: Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10]    15. The instrument may be used likewise, as we have seen, to draw arcs  of circles of the diameter C I or of the radius A O = r, whose center o  falls outside the paper. The pencil will be rested on C. We may operate  as follows (Fig. 2): Being given the direction of the radii A O and B  O, or, what amounts to the same thing, the tangents to the curve at the  given points, A and B to be united, we draw the line A D and raise at  its center the perpendicular D C, which, prolonged, passes necessarily  through the center. It is necessary to calculate the length C D.    We shall have                     ___ ___           ___    CD (2r - CD) = AD squared.CD squared - 2r.CD + AD squared = o.    [TEX: CD (2r - CD) = \\overline{AD^2}.\\overline{CD^2} - 2r.CD +  \\overline{AD^2} = o.]                    _________                 /     ___    CD = r +- \\  / r squared - AD squared  .              \\/    [TEX: CD = r +- \\sqrt{r^2 - \\overline{AD^2}}.]    It is evident that the lower sign alone suits our case, for d < r;  consequently,                    _________                 /     ___    CD = r - \\  / r squared - AD squared  .   (9)              \\/    [TEX: CD = r - \\sqrt{r^2 - \\overline{AD^2}}.]    Having obtained C, we put the instrument in the direction A B C. Then  each point of C F describes a circumference of the same center o.    16. If the distance of the points A and B were too great, then it  would be easy to determine a series of points belonging to the arc of  circumference sought (Fig. 4).    Being given C, the direction C I, and C I = R, on C I I lay off C E = d,  draw A E B perpendicularly, and calculate C A or A E. I shall have                    ___    d = (R - d) = AE squared;    [TEX: d = (R - d) = \\overline{AE^2};]    or, as absolute value,                 __________              /    A E = \\  / d (R - d) .    (10)           \\/    [TEX: AE = \\sqrt{d (R-d)}]    The instrument being arranged according to A C B, I prolong C B and take  B C' = B C, when C' will be one of the points sought. It will be readily  understood how, by repeating the above operations, but by varying the  value of d, we obtain the other intermediate points, and how we may  continue the operation to the right of C' with the process pointed out.    17. If the three rulers were three arcs of a large circle of a sphere,  the instrument might serve for drawing the meridians on such sphere.    18. If we imagine, instead of three axes placed in one plane and  converging at one point, a system of four axes also converging in one  point, but situated in any manner whatever in space, and if we rest  three of them against three fixed points, we shall be able to solve in  space problems analogous to those that have just been solved in a plane.  If we had, for example, to draw a spherical vault whose center was  inaccessible, we might adopt the same method.--_Le Genie Civil_.           *       *       *       *       *          FEED-WATER HEATER AND PURIFIER.    [Footnote: A paper read before the Franklin Institute.]    By GEORGE S. STRONG.      In order to properly understand the requirements of an effective  feed-water purifier, it will be necessary to understand something of the  character of the impurities of natural waters used for feeding  boilers, and of the manner in which they become troublesome in causing  incrustation or scale, as it is commonly called, in steam boilers. All  natural waters are known to contain more or less mineral matter, partly  held in solution and partly in mechanical suspension. These mineral  impurities are derived by contact of the water with the earth's surface,  and by percolation through its soil and rocks. The substances taken  up in solution by this process consist chiefly of the carbonates  and sulphates of lime and magnesia, and the chloride of sodium. The  materials carried in mechanical suspension are clay, sand, and vegetable  matter. There are many other saline ingredients in various natural  waters, but they exist in such minute quantities, and are generally so  very soluble, that their presence may safely be ignored in treating of  the utility of boiler waters.    Of the above named salts, the carbonates of lime and magnesia are  soluble only when the water contains free carbonic acid.    Our American rivers contain from 2 to 6 grains of saline matter to the  gallon in solution, and a varying quantity--generally exceeding 10  grains to the gallon--in mechanical suspension. The waters of wells and  springs hold a smaller quantity in suspension, but generally carry a  larger percentage of dissolved salts in solution, varying from 10 to 650  grains to the gallon.    When waters containing the carbonates of lime and magnesia in solution  are boiled, the carbonic acid is driven off, and the salts, deprived of  their solvent, are rapidly precipitated in fine crystalline particles,  which adhere tenaciously to whatever surface they fall upon. With  respect to the sulphate of lime, the case is different. It is at best  only sparingly soluble in water, one part (by weight) of the salt  requiring nearly 500 parts of water to dissolve it. As the water  evaporates in the boiler, however, a point is soon reached where  supersaturation occurs, as the water freshly fed into it constantly  brings fresh accessions of the salt; and when this point is reached,  the sulphate of lime is precipitated in the same form and with the same  tenaciously adherent quality as the carbonates."]]]
