We are informed that the      President of the Republic has refused to reprieve the condemned man      and that the execution will take place to-morrow morning.\"    After crossing the terrace, the young man found himself faced, at the  entrance to the garden, by a lady and gentleman who blocked his way; and  the latter said:    \"Excuse me, sir, but I noticed your agitation. It's about Jacques Aubrieux,  isn't it?\"    \"Yes, yes, Jacques Aubrieux,\" the young man stammered. \"Jacques, the friend  of my childhood. I'm hurrying to see his wife. She must be beside herself  with grief.\"    \"Can I offer you my assistance? I am Prince Renine. This lady and I would  be happy to call on Madame Aubrieux and to place our services at her  disposal.\"    The young man, upset by the news which he had read, seemed not to  understand. He introduced himself awkwardly:    \"My name is Dutreuil, Gaston Dutreuil.\"    Renine beckoned to his chauffeur, who was waiting at some little distance,  and pushed Gaston Dutreuil into the car, asking:    \"What address? Where does Madame Aubrieux live?\"    \"23 _bis_, Avenue du Roule.\"    After helping Hortense in, Renine repeated the address to the chauffeur  and, as soon as they drove off, tried to question Gaston Dutreuil:    \"I know very little of the case,\" he said. \"Tell it to me as briefly as you  can. Jacques Aubrieux killed one of his near relations, didn't he?\"    \"He is innocent, sir,\" replied the young man, who seemed incapable of  giving the least explanation. \"Innocent, I swear it. I've been Jacques'  friend for twenty years ... He is innocent ... and it would be  monstrous....\"    There was nothing to be got out of him. Besides, it was only a short drive.  They entered Neuilly through the Porte des Sablons and, two minutes later,  stopped before a long, narrow passage between high walls which led them to  a small, one-storeyed house.    Gaston Dutreuil rang.    \"Madame is in the drawing-room, with her mother,\" said the maid who opened  the door.    \"I'll go in to the ladies,\" he said, taking Renine and Hortense with him.    It was a fair-sized, prettily-furnished room, which, in ordinary times,  must have been used also as a study. Two women sat weeping, one of whom,  elderly and grey-haired, came up to Gaston Dutreuil. He explained the  reason for Renine's presence and she at once cried, amid her sobs:    \"My daughter's husband is innocent, sir. Jacques? A better man never lived.  He was so good-hearted! Murder his cousin? But he worshipped his cousin! I  swear that he's not guilty, sir! And they are going to commit the infamy of  putting him to death? Oh, sir, it will kill my daughter!\"    Renine realized that all these people had been living for months under the  obsession of that innocence and in the certainty that an innocent man could  never be executed. The news of the execution, which was now inevitable, was  driving them mad.    He went up to a poor creature bent in two whose face, a quite young face,  framed in pretty, flaxen hair, was convulsed with desperate grief.  Hortense, who had already taken a seat beside her, gently drew her head  against her shoulder. Renine said to her:    \"Madame, I do not know what I can do for you. But I give you my word of  honour that, if any one in this world can be of use to you, it is myself.  I therefore implore you to answer my questions as though the clear and  definite wording of your replies were able to alter the aspect of things  and as though you wished to make me share your opinion of Jacques Aubrieux.  For he is innocent, is he not?\"    \"Oh, sir, indeed he is!\" she exclaimed; and the woman's whole soul was in  the words.    \"You are certain of it. But you were unable to communicate your certainty  to the court. Well, you must now compel me to share it. I am not asking you  to go into details and to live again through the hideous torment which you  have suffered, but merely to answer certain questions. Will you do this?\"    \"I will.\"    Renine's influence over her was complete. With a few sentences Renine had  succeeded in subduing her and inspiring her with the will to obey. And once  more Hortense realized all the man's power, authority and persuasion.    \"What was your husband?\" he asked, after begging the mother and Gaston  Dutreuil to preserve absolute silence.    \"An insurance-broker.\"    \"Lucky in business?\"    \"Until last year, yes.\"    \"So there have been financial difficulties during the past few months?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And the murder was committed when?\"    \"Last March, on a Sunday.\"    \"Who was the victim?\"    \"A distant cousin, M. Guillaume, who lived at Suresnes.\"    \"What was the sum stolen?\"    \"Sixty thousand-franc notes, which this cousin had received the day before,  in payment of a long-outstanding debt.\"    \"Did your husband know that?\"    \"Yes. His cousin told him of it on the Sunday, in the course of a  conversation on the telephone, and Jacques insisted that his cousin ought  not to keep so large a sum in the house and that he ought to pay it into a  bank next day.\"    \"Was this in the morning?\"    \"At one o'clock in the afternoon. Jacques was to have gone to M. Guillaume  on his motor-cycle. But he felt tired and told him that he would not go  out. So he remained here all day.\"    \"Alone?\"    \"Yes. The two servants were out. I went to the Cinema des Ternes with my  mother and our friend Dutreuil. In the evening, we learnt that M. Guillaume  had been murdered. Next morning, Jacques was arrested.\"    \"On what evidence?\"    The poor creature hesitated to reply: the evidence of guilt had evidently  been overwhelming. Then, obeying a sign from Renine, she answered without  a pause:    \"The murderer went to Suresnes on a motorcycle and the tracks discovered  were those of my husband's machine. They found a handkerchief with my  husband's initials; and the revolver which was used belonged to him.  Lastly, one of our neighbours maintains that he saw my husband go out  on his bicycle at three o'clock and another that he saw him come in at  half-past four. The murder was committed at four o'clock.\"    \"And what does Jacques Aubrieux say in his defence?\"    \"He declares that he slept all the afternoon. During that time, some one  came who managed to unlock the cycle-shed and take the motor-cycle to go  to Suresnes. As for the handkerchief and the revolver, they were in the  tool-bag. There would be nothing surprising in the murderer's using them.\"    \"It seems a plausible explanation.\"    \"Yes, but the prosecution raised two objections. In the first place,  nobody, absolutely nobody, knew that my husband was going to stay at  home all day, because, on the contrary, it was his habit to go out on  his motor-cycle every Sunday afternoon.\"    \"And the second objection?\"    She flushed and murmured:    \"The murderer went to the pantry at M. Guillaume's and drank half a bottle  of wine straight out of the bottle, which shows my husband's fingerprints.\"    It seemed as though her strength was exhausted and as though, at the same  time, the unconscious hope which Renine's intervention had awakened in her  had suddenly vanished before the accumulation of adverse facts. Again she  collapsed, withdrawn into a sort of silent meditation from which Hortense's  affectionate attentions were unable to distract her.    The mother stammered:    \"He's not guilty, is he, sir? And they can't punish an innocent man. They  haven't the right to kill my daughter. Oh dear, oh dear, what have we done  to be tortured like this? My poor little Madeleine!\"    \"She will kill herself,\" said Dutreuil, in a scared voice. \"She will never  be able to endure the idea that they are guillotining Jacques. She will  kill herself presently ... this very night....\"    Renine was striding up and down the room.    \"You can do nothing for her, can you?\" asked Hortense.    \"It's half-past eleven now,\" he replied, in an anxious tone, \"and it's to  happen to-morrow morning.\"    \"Do you think he's guilty?\"    \"I don't know.... I don't know.... The poor woman's conviction is too  impressive to be neglected. When two people have lived together for years,  they can hardly be mistaken about each other to that degree. And yet....\"    He stretched himself out on a sofa and lit a cigarette. He smoked three in  succession, without a word from any one to interrupt his train of thought.  From time to time he looked at his watch. Every minute was of such  importance!    At last he went back to Madeleine Aubrieux, took her hands and said, very  gently:    \"You must not kill yourself. There is hope left until the last minute has  come; and I promise you that, for my part, I will not be disheartened until  that last minute. But I need your calmness and your confidence.\"    \"I will be calm,\" she said, with a pitiable air.    \"And confident?\"    \"And confident.\"    \"Well, wait for me. I shall be back in two hours from now. Will you come  with us, M. Dutreuil?\"    As they were stepping into his car, he asked the young man:    \"Do you know any small, unfrequented restaurant, not too far inside Paris?\"    \"There's the Brasserie Lutetia, on the ground-floor of the house in which I  live, on the Place des Ternes.\"    \"Capital. That will be very handy.\"    They scarcely spoke on the way. Renine, however, said to Gaston Dutreuil:    \"So far as I remember, the numbers of the notes are known, aren't they?\"    \"Yes. M. Guillaume had entered the sixty numbers in his pocket-book.\"    Renine muttered, a moment later:    \"That's where the whole problem lies. Where are the notes? If we could lay  our hands on them, we should know everything.\"    At the Brasserie Lutetia there was a telephone in the private room where  he asked to have lunch served. When the waiter had left him alone with  Hortense and Dutreuil, he took down the receiver with a resolute air:    \"Hullo!... Prefecture of police, please.... Hullo! Hullo!...

He had chanced to fall  into her company, had been subdued by her attractions, had tendered her  his hand, and been joyfully accepted both by parent and child. His wife  had given him every proof of the fondest attachment. Her father, who  possessed immense wealth, treated him with distinguished respect,  liberally supplied his wants, and had made one condition of his consent  to their union, a resolution to take up their abode with him.    \"They had passed three years of conjugal felicity, which had been  augmented by the birth of this child; when his professional duty called  him into Germany. It was not without an arduous struggle, that she was  persuaded to relinquish the design of accompanying him through all the  toils and perils of war. No parting was ever more distressful. They  strove to alleviate, by frequent letters, the evils of their lot. Those  of his wife, breathed nothing but anxiety for his safety, and impatience  of his absence. At length, a new arrangement was made, and he was  obliged to repair from Westphalia to Canada. One advantage attended this  change. It afforded him an opportunity of meeting his family. His  wife anticipated this interview, with no less rapture than himself. He  hurried to London, and the moment he alighted from the stage-coach, ran  with all speed to Mr. Conway's house.    \"It was an house of mourning. His father was overwhelmed with grief, and  incapable of answering his inquiries. The servants, sorrowful and mute,  were equally refractory. He explored the house, and called on the names  of his wife and daughter, but his summons was fruitless. At length,  this new disaster was explained. Two days before his arrival, his wife's  chamber was found empty. No search, however diligent and anxious, could  trace her steps. No cause could be assigned for her disappearance. The  mother and child had fled away together.    \"New exertions were made, her chamber and cabinets were ransacked, but  no vestige was found serving to inform them as to the motives of her  flight, whether it had been voluntary or otherwise, and in what corner  of the kingdom or of the world she was concealed. Who shall describe the  sorrow and amazement of the husband? His restlessness, his vicissitudes  of hope and fear, and his ultimate despair? His duty called him to  America. He had been in this city, and had frequently passed the door of  the house in which his wife, at that moment, resided. Her father had not  remitted his exertions to elucidate this painful mystery, but they had  failed. This disappointment hastened his death; in consequence of which,  Louisa's father became possessor of his immense property.\"    This tale was a copious theme of speculation. A thousand questions were  started and discussed in our domestic circle, respecting the motives  that influenced Mrs. Stuart to abandon her country. It did not appear  that her proceeding was involuntary. We recalled and reviewed every  particular that had fallen under our own observation. By none of these  were we furnished with a clue. Her conduct, after the most rigorous  scrutiny, still remained an impenetrable secret. On a nearer view, Major  Stuart proved himself a man of most amiable character. His attachment  to Louisa appeared hourly to increase. She was no stranger to the  sentiments suitable to her new character. She could not but readily  embrace the scheme which was proposed to her, to return with her father  to England. This scheme his regard for her induced him, however, to  postpone. Some time was necessary to prepare her for so great a change  and enable her to think without agony of her separation from us.    I was not without hopes of prevailing on her father entirely to  relinquish this unwelcome design. Meanwhile, he pursued his travels  through the southern colonies, and his daughter continued with us.  Louisa and my brother frequently received letters from him, which  indicated a mind of no common order. They were filled with amusing  details, and profound reflections. While here, he often partook of  our evening conversations at the temple; and since his departure, his  correspondence had frequently supplied us with topics of discourse.    One afternoon in May, the blandness of the air, and brightness of the  verdure, induced us to assemble, earlier than usual, in the temple.  We females were busy at the needle, while my brother and Pleyel were  bandying quotations and syllogisms. The point discussed was the merit of  the oration for Cluentius, as descriptive, first, of the genius of the  speaker; and, secondly, of the manners of the times. Pleyel laboured to  extenuate both these species of merit, and tasked his ingenuity, to shew  that the orator had embraced a bad cause; or, at least, a doubtful one.  He urged, that to rely on the exaggerations of an advocate, or to  make the picture of a single family a model from which to sketch the  condition of a nation, was absurd. The controversy was suddenly diverted  into a new channel, by a misquotation. Pleyel accused his companion of  saying \"polliciatur\" when he should have said \"polliceretur.\" Nothing  would decide the contest, but an appeal to the volume. My brother was  returning to the house for this purpose, when a servant met him with  a letter from Major Stuart. He immediately returned to read it in our  company.    Besides affectionate compliments to us, and paternal benedictions  on Louisa, his letter contained a description of a waterfall on the  Monongahela. A sudden gust of rain falling, we were compelled to remove  to the house. The storm passed away, and a radiant moon-light succeeded.  There was no motion to resume our seats in the temple. We therefore  remained where we were, and engaged in sprightly conversation. The  letter lately received naturally suggested the topic. A parallel was  drawn between the cataract there described, and one which Pleyel had  discovered among the Alps of Glarus. In the state of the former, some  particular was mentioned, the truth of which was questionable. To settle  the dispute which thence arose, it was proposed to have recourse to the  letter. My brother searched for it in his pocket. It was no where to be  found. At length, he remembered to have left it in the temple, and he  determined to go in search of it. His wife, Pleyel, Louisa, and myself,  remained where we were.    In a few minutes he returned. I was somewhat interested in the dispute,  and was therefore impatient for his return; yet, as I heard him  ascending the stairs, I could not but remark, that he had executed his  intention with remarkable dispatch. My eyes were fixed upon him on his  entrance. Methought he brought with him looks considerably different  from those with which he departed. Wonder, and a slight portion of  anxiety were mingled in them. His eyes seemed to be in search of some  object. They passed quickly from one person to another, till they rested  on his wife. She was seated in a careless attitude on the sofa, in the  same spot as before. She had the same muslin in her hand, by which her  attention was chiefly engrossed.    The moment he saw her, his perplexity visibly increased. He quietly  seated himself, and fixing his eyes on the floor, appeared to be  absorbed in meditation. These singularities suspended the inquiry which  I was preparing to make respecting the letter. In a short time, the  company relinquished the subject which engaged them, and directed their  attention to Wieland. They thought that he only waited for a pause in  the discourse, to produce the letter. The pause was uninterrupted by  him. At length Pleyel said, \"Well, I suppose you have found the letter.\"    \"No,\" said he, without any abatement of his gravity, and looking  stedfastly at his wife, \"I did not mount the hill.\"--\"Why  not?\"--\"Catharine, have you not moved from that spot since I left the  room?\"--She was affected with the solemnity of his manner, and laying  down her work, answered in a tone of surprise, \"No; Why do you ask that  question?\"--His eyes were again fixed upon the floor, and he did not  immediately answer. At length, he said, looking round upon us, \"Is it  true that Catharine did not follow me to the hill? That she did not just  now enter the room?\"--We assured him, with one voice, that she had not  been absent for a moment, and inquired into the motive of his questions.    \"Your assurances,\" said he, \"are solemn and unanimous; and yet I must  deny credit to your assertions, or disbelieve the testimony of my  senses, which informed me, when I was half way up the hill, that  Catharine was at the bottom.\"    We were confounded at this declaration. Pleyel rallied him with great  levity on his behaviour. He listened to his friend with calmness, but  without any relaxation of features.    \"One thing,\" said he with emphasis, \"is true; either I heard my  wife's voice at the bottom of the hill, or I do not hear your voice at  present.\"    \"Truly,\" returned Pleyel, \"it is a sad dilemma to which you have reduced  yourself. Certain it is, if our eyes can give us certainty that your  wife has been sitting in that spot during every moment of your absence.  You have heard her voice, you say, upon the hill. In general, her voice,  like her temper, is all softness. To be heard across the room, she is  obliged to exert herself. While you were gone, if I mistake not, she did  not utter a word. Clara and I had all the talk to ourselves. Still it  may be that she held a whispering conference with you on the hill; but  tell us the particulars.\"    \"The conference,\" said he, \"was short; and far from being carried on in  a whisper. You know with what intention I left the house. Half way to  the rock, the moon was for a moment hidden from us by a cloud. I never  knew the air to be more bland and more calm. In this interval I glanced  at the temple, and thought I saw a glimmering between the columns. It  was so faint, that it would not"]]]
