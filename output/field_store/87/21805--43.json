One day, not long after this had happened, as Balna was rocking her  baby's cradle, and whilst her sisters were working in the room below,  there came to the palace door a man in a long black dress, who said  that he was a Fakir, and came to beg. The servants said to him, \"You  cannot go into the palace--the Raja's sons have all gone away; we  think they must be dead, and their widows cannot be interrupted by  your begging.\" But he said, \"I am a holy man, you must let me in.\"  Then the stupid servants let him walk through the palace, but they did  not know that this was no Fakir, but a wicked Magician named Punchkin.    Punchkin Fakir wandered through the palace, and saw many beautiful  things there, till at last he reached the room where Balna sat singing  beside her little boy's cradle. The Magician thought her more  beautiful than all the other beautiful things he had seen, insomuch  that he asked her to go home with him and to marry him. But she said,  \"My husband, I fear, is dead, but my little boy is still quite young;  I will stay here and teach him to grow up a clever man, and when he is  grown up he shall go out into the world, and try and learn tidings of  his father. Heaven forbid that I should ever leave him, or marry you.\"  At these words the Magician was very angry, and turned her into a  little black dog, and led her away; saying, \"Since you will not come  with me of your own free will, I will make you.\" So the poor Princess  was dragged away, without any power of effecting an escape, or of  letting her sisters know what had become of her. As Punchkin passed  through the palace gate the servants said to him, \"Where did you get  that pretty little dog?\" And he answered, \"One of the Princesses gave  it to me as a present.\" At hearing which they let him go without  further questioning.    Soon after this, the six elder Princesses heard the little baby, their  nephew, begin to cry, and when they went upstairs they were much  surprised to find him all alone, and Balna nowhere to be seen. Then  they questioned the servants, and when they heard of the Fakir and the  little black dog, they guessed what had happened, and sent in every  direction seeking them, but neither the Fakir nor the dog were to be  found. What could six poor women do? They gave up all hopes of ever  seeing their kind husbands, and their sister, and her husband, again,  and devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care of  their little nephew.    Thus time went on, till Balna's son was fourteen years old. Then, one  day, his aunts told him the history of the family; and no sooner did  he hear it, than he was seized with a great desire to go in search of  his father and mother and uncles, and if he could find them alive to  bring them home again. His aunts, on learning his determination, were  much alarmed and tried to dissuade him, saying, \"We have lost our  husbands, and our sister and her husband, and you are now our sole  hope; if you go away, what shall we do?\" But he replied, \"I pray you  not to be discouraged; I will return soon, and if it is possible bring  my father and mother and uncles with me.\" So he set out on his  travels; but for some months he could learn nothing to help him in  his search.    At last, after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles, and  become almost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his  parents, he one day came to a country that seemed full of stones, and  rocks, and trees, and there he saw a large palace with a high tower;  hard by which was a Malee's little house.    As he was looking about, the Malee's wife saw him, and ran out of the  house and said, \"My dear boy, who are you that dare venture to this  dangerous place?\" He answered, \"I am a Raja's son, and I come in  search of my father, and my uncles, and my mother whom a wicked  enchanter bewitched.\"    Then the Malee's wife said, \"This country and this palace belong to a  great enchanter; he is all powerful, and if any one displeases him, he  can turn them into stones and trees. All the rocks and trees you see  here were living people once, and the Magician turned them to what  they now are. Some time ago a Raja's son came here, and shortly  afterwards came his six brothers, and they were all turned into stones  and trees; and these are not the only unfortunate ones, for up in that  tower lives a beautiful Princess, whom the Magician has kept prisoner  there for twelve years, because she hates him and will not marry him.\"    Then the little Prince thought, \"These must be my parents and my  uncles. I have found what I seek at last.\" So he told his story to the  Malee's wife, and begged her to help him to remain in that place  awhile and inquire further concerning the unhappy people she  mentioned; and she promised to befriend him, and advised his  disguising himself lest the Magician should see him, and turn him  likewise into stone. To this the Prince agreed. So the Malee's wife  dressed him up in a saree, and pretended that he was her daughter.    One day, not long after this, as the Magician was walking in his  garden he saw the little girl (as he thought) playing about, and asked  her who she was. She told him she was the Malee's daughter, and the  Magician said, \"You are a pretty little girl, and to-morrow you shall  take a present of flowers from me to the beautiful lady who lives in  the tower.\"    The young Prince was much delighted at hearing this, and went  immediately to inform the Malee's wife; after consultation with whom  he determined that it would be more safe for him to retain his  disguise, and trust to the chance of a favourable opportunity for  establishing some communication with his mother, if it were indeed  she.    Now it happened that at Balna's marriage her husband had given her a  small gold ring on which her name was engraved, and she had put it on  her little son's finger when he was a baby, and afterwards when he was  older his aunts had had it enlarged for him, so that he was still able  to wear it. The Malee's wife advised him to fasten the well-known  treasure to one of the bouquets he presented to his mother, and trust  to her recognising it. This was not to be done without difficulty, as  such a strict watch was kept over the poor Princess (for fear of her  ever establishing communication with her friends), that though the  supposed Malee's daughter was permitted to take her flowers every day,  the Magician or one of his slaves was always in the room at the time.  At last one day, however, opportunity favoured him, and when no one  was looking, the boy tied the ring to a nosegay, and threw it at  Balna's feet. It fell with a clang on the floor, and Balna, looking to  see what made the strange sound, found the little ring tied to the  flowers. On recognising it, she at once believed the story her son  told her of his long search, and begged him to advise her as to what  she had better do; at the same time entreating him on no account to  endanger his life by trying to rescue her. She told him that for  twelve long years the Magician had kept her shut up in the tower  because she refused to marry him, and she was so closely guarded that  she saw no hope of release.    Now Balna's son was a bright, clever boy, so he said, \"Do not fear,  dear mother; the first thing to do is to discover how far the  Magician's power extends, in order that we may be able to liberate my  father and uncles, whom he has imprisoned in the form of rocks and  trees. You have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years; now  rather speak kindly. Tell him you have given up all hopes of again  seeing the husband you have so long mourned, and say you are willing  to marry him. Then endeavour to find out what his power consists in,  and whether he is immortal, or can be put to death.\"    Balna determined to take her son's advice; and the next day sent for  Punchkin, and spoke to him as had been suggested.    The Magician, greatly delighted, begged her to allow the wedding to  take place as soon as possible.    But she told him that before she married him he must allow her a  little more time, in which she might make his acquaintance, and that,  after being enemies so long, their friendship could but strengthen by  degrees. \"And do tell me,\" she said, \"are you quite immortal? Can  death never touch you? And are you too great an enchanter ever to feel  human suffering?\"    \"Why do you ask?\" said he.    \"Because,\" she replied, \"if I am to be your wife, I would fain know  all about you, in order, if any calamity threatens you, to overcome,  or if possible to avert it.\"    \"It is true,\" he added, \"that I am not as others. Far, far away,  hundreds of thousands of miles from this, there lies a desolate  country covered with thick jungle. In the midst of the jungle grows a  circle of palm trees, and in the centre of the circle stand six  chattees full of water, piled one above another: below the sixth  chattee is a small cage which contains a little green parrot; on the  life of the parrot depends my life; and if the parrot is killed I must  die. It is, however,\" he added, \"impossible that the parrot should  sustain any injury, both on account of the inaccessibility of the  country, and because, by my appointment, many thousand genii surround  the palm trees, and kill all who approach the place.\"    Balna told her son what Punchkin had said; but at the same time  implored him to give up all idea of getting the parrot.    The Prince, however, replied, \"Mother, unless I can get hold of that  parrot, you, and my father, and uncles, cannot be liberated: be not  afraid, I will shortly return. Do you, meantime, keep the Magician in  good humour--still putting off your marriage with him on various  pretexts; and before he finds out the cause of delay, I will be here.\"  So saying, he went away.    Many, many weary miles did he travel, till at last he came to a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/713"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 2 (#6)"],[1,"get rid of them; for the resentment of his people had arrived  at such a height, that nothing short of the total extermination of the  crusaders would satisfy them.  Gottschalk had to pay the penalty, not  only for the ravages of his own bands, but for those of the swarms that  had come before him. He and his army were induced, by some means or  other, to lay down their arms: the savage Hungarians, seeing them thus  defenceless, set upon them, and slaughtered them in great numbers. How  many escaped their arrows, we are not informed; but not one of them  reached Palestine.    Other swarms, under nameless leaders, issued from Germany and France,  more brutal and more frantic than any that had preceded them.  Their  fanaticism surpassed by far the wildest freaks of the followers of the  Hermit. In bands, varying in numbers from one to five thousand, they  traversed the country in all directions, bent upon plunder and  massacre. They wore the symbol of the crusade upon their shoulders, but  inveighed against the folly of proceeding to the Holy Land to destroy  the Turks, while they left behind them so many Jews, the still more  inveterate enemies of Christ. They swore fierce vengeance against this  unhappy race, and murdered all the Hebrews they could lay their hands  on, first subjecting them to the most horrible mutilation.  According  to the testimony of Albert Aquensis, they lived among each other in the  most shameless profligacy, and their vice was only exceeded by their  superstition. Whenever they were in search of Jews, they were preceded  by a goose and goat, which they believed to be holy, and animated with  divine power to discover the retreats of the unbelievers. In Germany  alone they slaughtered more than a thousand Jews, notwithstanding all  the efforts of the clergy to save them. So dreadful was the cruelty of  their tormentors, that great numbers of Jews committed self-destruction  to avoid falling into their hands.    Again it fell to the lot of the Hungarians to deliver Europe from these  pests. When there were no more Jews to murder, the bands collected in  one body, and took the old route to the Holy Land, a route stained with  the blood of three hundred thousand who had gone before, and destined  also to receive theirs. The number of these swarms has never been  stated; but so many of them perished in Hungary, that contemporary  writers, despairing of giving any adequate idea of their multitudes,  state that the fields were actually heaped with their corpses, and that  for miles in its course the waters of the Danube were dyed with their  blood. It was at Mersburg, on the Danube, that the greatest slaughter  took place,--a slaughter so great as to amount almost to extermination.  The Hungarians for a while disputed the passage of the river, but the  crusaders forced their way across, and attacking the city with the  blind courage of madness, succeeded in making a breach in the walls. At  this moment of victory an unaccountable fear came over them. Throwing  down their arms they fled panic-stricken, no one knew why, and no one  knew whither. The Hungarians followed, sword in hand, and cut them down  without remorse, and in such numbers, that the stream of the Danube is  said to have been choked up by their unburied bodies.    This was the worst paroxysm of the madness of Europe; and this passed,  her chivalry stepped upon the scene. Men of cool heads, mature plans,  and invincible courage stood forward to lead and direct the grand  movement of Europe upon Asia. It is upon these men that romance has  lavished her most admiring epithets, leaving to the condemnation of  history the vileness and brutality of those who went before. Of these  leaders the most distinguished were Godfrey of Bouillon Duke of  Lorraine, and Raymond Count of Toulouse. Four other chiefs of the royal  blood of Europe also assumed the Cross, and led each his army to the  Holy Land: Hugh, Count of Vermandois, brother of the King of France;  Robert, Duke of Normandy, the elder brother of William Rufus; Robert  Count of Flanders, and Boemund Prince of Tarentum, eldest son of the  celebrated Robert Guiscard. These men were all tinged with the  fanaticism of the age, but none of them acted entirely from religious  motives. They were neither utterly reckless like Gautier sans Avoir,  crazy like Peter the Hermit, nor brutal like Gottschalk the Monk, but  possessed each of these qualities in a milder form; their valour being  tempered by caution, their religious zeal by worldly views, and their  ferocity by the spirit of chivalry. They saw whither led the torrent of  the public will; and it being neither their wish nor their interest to  stem it, they allowed themselves to be carried with it, in the hope  that it would lead them at last to a haven of aggrandizement. Around  them congregated many minor chiefs, the flower of the nobility of  France and Italy, with some few from Germany, England, and Spain. It  was wisely conjectured that armies so numerous would find a difficulty  in procuring provisions if they all journeyed by the same road. They,  therefore, resolved to separate, Godfrey de Bouillon proceeding through  Hungary and Bulgaria, the Count of Toulouse through Lombardy and  Dalmatia, and the other leaders through Apulia to Constantinople, where  the several divisions were to reunite. The forces under these leaders  have been variously estimated. The Princess Anna Comnena talks of them  as having been as numerous as the sands on the sea-shore, or the stars  in the firmament. Fulcher of Chartres is more satisfactory, and  exaggerates less magnificently, when he states, that all the divisions,  when they had sat down before Nice in Bithynia, amounted to one hundred  thousand horsemen, and six hundred thousand men on foot, exclusive of  the priests, women and children. Gibbon is of opinion that this amount  is exaggerated; but thinks the actual numbers did not fall very far  short of the calculation. The Princess Anna afterwards gives the number  of those under Godfrey of Bouillon as eighty thousand foot and horse;  and supposing that each of the other chiefs led an army as numerous,  the total would be near half a million. This must be over rather than  under the mark, as the army of Godfrey of Bouillon was confessedly the  largest when it set out, and suffered less by the way than any other.    The Count of Vermandois was the first who set foot on the Grecian  territory. On his arrival at Durazzo he was received with every mark of  respect and courtesy by the agents of the Emperor, and his followers  were abundantly supplied with provisions. Suddenly however, and without  cause assigned, the Count was arrested by order of the Emperor Alexius,  and conveyed a close prisoner to Constantinople.  Various motives have  been assigned by different authors as having induced the Emperor to  this treacherous and imprudent proceeding. By every writer he has been  condemned for so flagrant a breach of hospitality and justice. The most  probable reason for his conduct appears to be that suggested by Guibert  of Nogent, who states that Alexius, fearful of the designs of the  crusaders upon his throne, resorted to this extremity in order  afterwards to force the Count to take the oath of allegiance to him, as  the price of his liberation.  The example of a prince so eminent as the  brother of the King of France, would, he thought, be readily followed  by the other chiefs of the Crusade. In the result he was wofully  disappointed, as every man deserves to be who commits positive evil  that doubtful good may ensue.  But this line of policy accorded well  enough with the narrowmindedness of the Emperor, who, in the enervating  atmosphere of his highly civilized and luxurious court, dreaded the  influx of the hardy and ambitious warriors of the West, and strove to  nibble away by unworthy means, the power which he had not energy enough  to confront. If danger to himself had existed from the residence of the  chiefs in his dominions, he might easily have averted it, by the simple  means of placing himself at the head of the European movement, and  directing its energies to their avowed object, the conquest of the Holy  Land.  But the Emperor, instead of being, as he might have been, the  lord and leader of the Crusades, which he had himself aided in no  inconsiderable degree to suscitate by his embassies to the Pope, became  the slave of men who hated and despised him. No doubt the barbarous  excesses of the followers of Gautier and Peter the Hermit made him look  upon the whole body of them with disgust, but it was the disgust of a  little mind, which is glad of any excuse to palliate or justify its own  irresolution and love of ease.    Godfrey of Bouillon traversed Hungary in the most quiet and orderly  manner. On his arrival at Mersburg he found the country strewed with  the mangled corpses of the Jew-killers, and demanded of the King of  Hungary for what reason his people had set upon them. The latter  detailed the atrocities they had committed, and made it so evident to  Godfrey that the Hungarians had only acted in self-defence, that the  high-minded leader declared himself satisfied and passed on, without  giving or receiving molestation. On his arrival at Philippopoli, he was  informed for the first time of the imprisonment of the Count of  Vermandois. He immediately sent messengers to the Emperor, demanding  the Count's release, and threatening, in case of refusal, to lay waste  the country with fire and sword. After waiting a day at Philippopoli he  marched on to Adrianople, where he was met by his messengers returning  with the Emperor's refusal. Godfrey, the bravest and most determined of  the leaders of the Crusade, was not a man to swerve from his word, and  the country was given up to pillage.  Alexius here committed another  blunder. No sooner did he learn from dire experience that the crusader  was not an utterer of"]]]
