But Nix Nought Nothing fled on till where do you think they came to?  Why, to near the castle of Nix Nought Nothing's father and mother. But  the giant's daughter was so weary that she couldn't move a step further.  So Nix Nought Nothing told her to wait there while he went and found  out a lodging for the night. And he went on towards the lights of the  castle, and on the way he came to the cottage of the hen-wife whose  boy had had his brains dashed out by the giant. Now she knew Nix Nought  Nothing in a moment, and hated him because he was the cause of her son's  death. So when he asked his way to the castle she put a spell upon him,  and when he got to the castle, no sooner was he let in than he fell down  dead asleep upon a bench in the hall. The king and queen tried all they  could do to wake him up, but all in vain. So the king promised that if  any lady could wake him up she should marry him. Meanwhile the giant's  daughter was waiting and waiting for him to come back. And she went up  into a tree to watch for him. The gardener's daughter, going to draw  water in the well, saw the shadow of the lady in the water and thought  it was herself, and said; \"If I'm so bonny, if I'm so brave, why do you  send me to draw water?\" So she threw down her pail and went to see if  she could wed the sleeping stranger. And she went to the hen-wife, who  taught her an unspelling catch which would keep Nix Nought Nothing awake  as long as the gardener's daughter liked. So she went up to the castle  and sang her catch and Nix Nought Nothing was wakened for a bit and they  promised to wed him to the gardener's daughter. Meanwhile the gardener  went down to draw water from the well and saw the shadow of the lady in  the water. So he looks up and finds her, and he brought the lady from  the tree, and led her into his house. And he told her that a stranger  was to marry his daughter, and took her up to the castle and showed her  the man: and it was Nix Nought Nothing asleep in a chair. And she saw  him, and cried to him: \"Waken, waken, and speak to me!\" But he would not  waken, and soon she cried:      \"I cleaned the stable, I laved the lake, and I clomb the tree,    And all for the love of thee,    And thou wilt not waken and speak to me.\"    The king and the queen heard this, and came to the bonny young lady, and  she said:    \"I cannot get Nix Nought Nothing to speak to me for all that I can do.\"    Then were they greatly astonished when she spoke of Nix Nought Nothing,  and asked where he was, and she said: \"He that sits there in the chair.\"  Then they ran to him and kissed him and called him their own dear son;  so they called for the gardener's daughter and made her sing her charm,  and he wakened, and told them all that the giant's daughter had done  for him, and of all her kindness. Then they took her in their arms and  kissed her, and said she should now be their daughter, for their son  should marry her. But they sent for the hen-wife and put her to death.  And they lived happy all their days.          JACK HANNAFORD    There was an old soldier who had been long in the wars--so long, that  he was quite out-at-elbows, and he did not know where to go to find a  living. So he walked up moors, down glens, till at last he came to a  farm, from which the good man had gone away to market. The wife of the  farmer was a very foolish woman, who had been a widow when he married  her; the farmer was foolish enough, too, and it is hard to say which of  the two was the more foolish. When you've heard my tale you may decide.    Now before the farmer goes to market says he to his wife: \"Here is ten  pounds all in gold, take care of it till I come home.\" If the man had  not been a fool he would never have given the money to his wife to keep.  Well, off he went in his cart to market, and the wife said to herself:  \"I will keep the ten pounds quite safe from thieves;\" so she tied it up  in a rag, and she put the rag up the parlour chimney.    \"There,\" said she, \"no thieves will ever find it now, that is quite  sure.\"    Jack Hannaford, the old soldier, came and rapped at the door.    \"Who is there?\" asked the wife.    \"Jack Hannaford.\"    \"Where do you come from?\"    \"Paradise.\"    \"Lord a' mercy! and maybe you've seen my old man there,\" alluding to her  former husband.    \"Yes, I have.\"    \"And how was he a-doing?\" asked the goody.    \"But middling; he cobbles old shoes, and he has nothing but cabbage for  victuals.\"    \"Deary me!\" exclaimed the woman. \"Didn't he send a message to me?\"    \"Yes, he did,\" replied Jack Hannaford. \"He said that he was out of  leather, and his pockets were empty, so you were to send him a few  shillings to buy a fresh stock of leather.\"    \"He shall have them, bless his poor soul!\" And away went the wife to the  parlour chimney, and she pulled the rag with the ten pounds in it from  the chimney, and she gave the whole sum to the soldier, telling him that  her old man was to use as much as he wanted, and to send back the rest.    It was not long that Jack waited after receiving the money; he went off  as fast as he could walk.    Presently the farmer came home and asked for his money. The wife told  him that she had sent it by a soldier to her former husband in Paradise,  to buy him leather for cobbling the shoes of the saints and angels of  Heaven. The farmer was very angry, and he swore that he had never met  with such a fool as his wife. But the wife said that her husband was a  greater fool for letting her have the money.    There was no time to waste words; so the farmer mounted his horse and  rode off after Jack Hannaford. The old soldier heard the horse's hoofs  clattering on the road behind him, so he knew it must be the farmer  pursuing him. He lay down on the ground, and shading his eyes with one  hand, looked up into the sky, and pointed heavenwards with the other  hand.    \"What are you about there?\" asked the farmer, pulling up.    \"Lord save you!\" exclaimed Jack: \"I've seen a rare sight.\"    \"What was that?\"    \"A man going straight up into the sky, as if he were walking on a road.\"    \"Can you see him still?\"    \"Yes, I can.\"    \"Where?\"    \"Get off your horse and lie down.\"    \"If you will hold the horse.\"    Jack did so readily.    \"I cannot see him,\" said the farmer.    \"Shade your eyes with your hand, and you'll soon see a man flying away  from you.\"    Sure enough he did so, for Jack leaped on the horse, and rode away with  it. The farmer walked home without his horse.    \"You are a bigger fool than I am,\" said the wife; \"for I did only one  foolish thing, and you have done two.\"          BINNORIE    Once upon a time there were two king's daughters lived in a bower near  the bonny mill-dams of Binnorie. And Sir William came wooing the eldest  and won her love and plighted troth with glove and with ring. But after  a time he looked upon the youngest, with her cherry cheeks and golden  hair, and his love grew towards her till he cared no longer for the  eldest one. So she hated her sister for taking away Sir William's love,  and day by day her hate grew upon her, and she plotted and she planned  how to get rid of her.    So one fine morning, fair and clear, she said to her sister, \"Let us  go and see our father's boats come in at the bonny mill-stream of  Binnorie.\" So they went there hand in hand. And when they got to the  river's bank the youngest got upon a stone to watch for the coming of  the boats. And her sister, coming behind her, caught her round the waist  and dashed her into the rushing mill-stream of Binnorie.    \"O sister, sister, reach me your hand!\" she cried, as she floated away,  \"and you shall have half of all I've got or shall get.\"    \"No, sister, I'll reach you no hand of mine, for I am the heir to all  your land. Shame on me if I touch the hand that has come 'twixt me and  my own heart's love.\"    \"O sister, O sister, then reach me your glove!\" she cried, as she  floated further away, \"and you shall have your William again.\"    \"Sink on,\" cried the cruel princess, \"no hand or glove of mine you'll  touch. Sweet William will be all mine when you are sunk beneath the  bonny mill-stream of Binnorie.\" And she turned and went home to the  king's castle.    And the princess floated down the mill-stream, sometimes swimming  and sometimes sinking, till she came near the mill. Now the miller's  daughter was cooking that day, and needed water for her cooking. And as  she went to draw it from the stream, she saw something floating towards  the mill-dam, and she called out, \"Father! father! draw your dam.  There's something white--a merry maid or a milk-white swan--coming down  the stream.\" So the miller hastened to the dam and stopped the heavy  cruel mill-wheels. And then they took out the princess and laid her on  the bank.    Fair and beautiful she looked as she lay there. In her golden hair were  pearls and precious stones; you could not see her waist for her golden  girdle; and the golden fringe of her white dress came down over her lily  feet. But she was drowned, drowned!    And as she lay there in her beauty a famous harper passed by the  mill-dam of Binnorie, and saw her sweet pale face. And though he  travelled on far away he never forgot that face, and after many days he  came back to the bonny mill-stream of Binnorie. But then all he could  find of her where they had put her to rest were her bones and her  golden hair. So he made a harp out of her breast-bone and her hair, and  travelled on up the hill from the mill-dam of Binnorie, till he came to  the castle of the king her father.    That night they were all gathered in the castle hall to hear the great  harper--king and queen, their daughter and son, Sir William and all  their Court. And first the harper sang to his old harp, making them joy  and be glad or sorrow and weep just as he liked. But while he sang he  put the harp he had made that day"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7440"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#6)"],[1,"verses 424  72.

OF THE ARABS BEFORE MOHAMMED; OR, AS THEY EXPRESS IT, IN THE TIME         OF IGNORANCE; THEIR HISTORY, RELIGION, LEARNING, AND CUSTOMS      THE Arabs, and the country they inhabit, which themselves call Jezîrat al  Arab, or the Peninsula of the Arabians, but we Arabia, were so named from  Araba, a small territory in the province of Tehâma;1 to which Yarab the son of  Kahtân, the father of the ancient Arabs, gave his name, and where, some ages  after, dwelt Ismael the son of Abraham by Hagar.  The Christian writers for  several centuries speak of them under the appellation of Saracens; the most  certain derivation of which word is from shark, the east, where the  descendants of Joctan, the Kahtân of the Arabs, are placed by Moses,2 and in  which quarter they dwelt in respect to the Jews.3     The name of Arabia (used in a more extensive sense) sometimes comprehends  all that large tract of land bounded by the river Euphrates, the Persian Gulf,  the Sindian, Indian, and Red Seas, and part of the Mediterranean: above two-  thirds of which country, that is, Arabia properly so called, the Arabs have  possessed almost from the Flood; and have made themselves masters of the rest,  either by settlements or continual incursions; for which reason the Turks and  Persians at this day call the whole Arabistân, or the country of the Arabs.     But the limits of Arabia, in its more usual and proper sense, are much  narrower, as reaching no farther northward than the Isthmus, which runs from  Aila to the head of the Persian Gulf, and the borders of the territory of  Cûfa; which tract of land the Greeks nearly comprehended under the name of  Arabia the Happy.  The eastern geographers make Arabia Petræa to belong partly  to Egypt, and partly to Shâm or Syria, and the desert Arabia they call the  deserts of Syria.4     Proper Arabia is by the oriental writers generally divided into five  provinces,5 viz., Yaman, Hejâz, Tehâma, Najd, and Yamâma; to which       1  Pocock, Specim.

The province of Yaman, so called either from its situation to the right  hand, or south of the temple of Mecca, or else from the happiness and verdure  of its soil, extends itself along the Indian Ocean from Aden to Cape Rasalgat;  part of the Red Sea bounds it on the west and south sides, and the province of  Hejâz on the north.1  It is subdivided into several lesser provinces, as  Hadramaut, Shihr, Omân, Najrân, &c., of which Shihr alone produces the  frankincense.2  The metropolis of Yaman is Sanaa, a very ancient city, in  former times called Ozal, and much celebrated for its delightful situation;  but the prince at present resides about five leagues northward from thence, at  a place no less pleasant, called Hisn almawâheb, or the Castle of delights.3     This country has been famous from all antiquity for the happiness of its  climate, its fertility and riches,4 which induced Alexander the Great, after  his return from his Indian expedition, to form a design of conquering it, and  fixing there his royal seat; but his death, which happened soon after,  prevented the execution of this project.5  Yet, in reality, great part of the  riches which the ancients imagined were the produce of Arabia, came really  from the Indies and the coasts of Africa; for the Egyptians, who had engrossed  that trade, which was then carried on by way of the Red Sea, to themselves,  industriously concealed the truth of the matter, and kept their ports shut to  prevent foreigners penetrating into those countries, or receiving any  information thence; and this precaution of theirs on the one side, and the  deserts, unpassable to strangers, on the other, were the reason why Arabia was  so little known to the Greeks and Romans.  The delightfulness and plenty of  Yaman are owing to its mountains; for all that part which lies along the Red  Sea is a dry, barren desert, in some places ten or twelve leagues over, but in  return bounded by those mountains, which being well watered, enjoy an almost  continual spring, and, besides coffee, the peculiar produce of this country,  yield great plenty and variety of fruits, and in particular excellent corn,  grapes, and spices.  There are no rivers of note in this country, for the  streams which at certain times of the year descend from the mountains, seldom  reach the sea, being for the most part drunk up and lost in the burning sands  of that coast.1     The soil of the other provinces is much more barren than that of Yaman; the  greater part of their territories being covered with dry sands, or rising into  rocks, interspersed here and there with some fruitful spots, which receive  their greatest advantages from their water and palm trees.     The province of Hejâz, so named because it divides Najd from Tehâma, is  bounded on the south by Yaman and Tehâma, on the west by the Red Sea, on the  north by the deserts of Syria, and on the east by the province of Najd.2  This  province is famous for its two chief cities, Mecca and Medina, one of which is  celebrated for its temple, and having given birth to Mohammed; and the other  for being the       6  Gol. ad Alfragan. 79. 1  La Roque, Voyage de l'Arab, heur. 121. 2  Gol. ad Alfragan. 79, 87.  3  Voyage de l'Arab, heur. 232. 4  Vide Dionys.

Mecca, sometimes also called Becca, which words are synonymous, and signify  a place of great concourse, is certainly one of the most ancient cities of the  world: it is by some3 thought to be the Mesa of the scripture,4 a name not  unknown to the Arabians, and supposed to be taken form one of Ismael's sons.5  It is seated in a stony and barren valley, surrounded on all sides with  mountains.6  The length of Mecca from south to north is about two miles, and  its breadth from the foot of the mountain Ajyad, to the top of another called  Koaikaân, about a mile.7  In the midst of this space stands the city, built of  stone cut from the neighbouring mountains.8  There being no springs at Mecca,9  at least none but what are bitter and unfit to drink,10 except only the well  Zemzem, the water of which, though far the best, yet cannot be drank of any  continuance, being brackish, and causing eruptions in those who drink  plentifully of it,11 the inhabitants are obliged to use rain-water which they  catch in cisterns.1  But this not being sufficient, several attempts were made  to bring water thither from other places by aqueducts; and particularly about  Mohammed's time, Zobair, one of the principal men of the tribe of Koreish,  endeavoured at a great expense to supply the city with water from Mount  Arafat, but without success; yet this was effected not many years ago, being  begun at the charge of a wife of Solimân the Turkish emperor.2  But long  before this, another aqueduct had been made from a spring at a considerable"]]]
