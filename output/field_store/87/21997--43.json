In the action at  Arcis-sur-Aube I fought with desperation, and asked nothing but to die  for my country. My clothes were torn to pieces by musket balls--but alas!  not one could touch my person! A death which I should owe to an act of  despair would be cowardly; suicide does not suit my principles nor the  rank I have holden in the world. I am a man condemned to live.\" He sighed  almost to sobbing;--then, after several minutes' silence, he said with a  bitter smile--\"After all they say, a living camp-boy is worth more than a  dead emperor,\"--and immediately retired into the palace. It was the last  time De Bausset ever saw his master.           *       *       *       *       *      SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS             *       *       *       *       *      APRIL FOOLS.        This day, beyond all contradiction,    This day is all thine own, Queen Fiction!    And thou art building castles boundless    Of groundless joys, and griefs as groundless;    Assuring beauties that the border    Of their new dress is out of order;    And schoolboys that their shoes want tying;    And babies that their dolls are dying.        Lend me, lend me, some disguise;        I will tell prodigious lies:        All who care for what I say        Shall be April fools to-day.      First I relate how all the nation    Is ruined by Emancipation:    How honest men are sadly thwarted;    How beads and faggots are imported;    How every parish church looks thinner;    How Peel has asked the Pope to dinner;    And how the Duke, who fought the duel,    Keeps good King George on water-gruel.        Thus I waken doubts and fears        In the Commons and the Peers;        If they care for what I say,        They are April fools to-day.      Next I announce to hall and hovel    Lord Asterisk's unwritten novel.    It's full of wit, and full of fashion,    And full of taste, and full of passion;    It tells some very curious histories,    Elucidates some charming mysteries,    And mingles sketches of society    With precepts of the soundest piety.        Thus I babble to the host        Who adore the \"Morning Post;\"        If they care for what I say.        They are April fools to-day.      Then to the artist of my raiment    I hint his bankers have stopped payment;    And just suggest to Lady Locket    That somebody has picked her pocket--    And scare Sir Thomas from the city,    By murmuring, in a tone of pity,    That I am sure I saw my Lady    Drive through the Park with Captain Grady.        Off my troubled victims go,        Very pale and very low;        If they care for what I say,        They are April fools to-day.      I've sent the learned Doctor Trepan    To feel Sir Hubert's broken kneepan;    'Twill rout doctor's seven senses    To find Sir Hubert charging fences!    I've sent a sallow parchment scraper    To put Miss Trim's last will on paper;    He'll see her, silent as a mummy,    At whist with her two maids and dummy.        Man of brief, and man of pill,        They will take it very ill;        If they care for what I say,        They are April fools to-day.      And then to her, whose smiles shed light on    My weary lot last year at Brighton,    I talk of happiness and marriage,    St. George's and a travelling carriage.    I trifle with my rosy fetters,    I rave about her 'witching letters,    And swear my heart shall do no treason    Before the closing of the season.        Thus I whisper in the ear        Of Louisa Windermere--        If she cares for what I say,        She's an April fool to-day.      And to the world I publish gaily    That all things are improving daily;    That suns grow warmer, streamlets clearer,    And faith more firm, and love sincerer--    That children grow extremely clever--    That sin is seldom known, or never--    That gas, and steam, and education,    Are, killing sorrow and starvation!        Pleasant visions--but, alas        How those pleasant visions pass!        If you care for what I say,        You're an April fool to-day.      Last, to myself, when night comes round me,    And the soft chain of thought has bound me,    I whisper, \"Sir, your eyes are killing--    You owe no mortal man a shilling--    You never cringe for star or garter,    You're much too wise to be a martyr--    And since you must, be food for vermin,    You don't feel much desire for ermine!\"        Wisdom is a mine, no doubt,        If one can but find it out--        But whate'er I think or say,        I'm an April fool to-day,                       _London Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *      \"WATER BEWITCHED.\"      A widow of the name of Betty Falla kept an alehouse in one of the  market-towns frequented by the Lammermuir ladies, (Dunse, we believe,)  and a number of them used to lodge at her house during the fair. One year  Betty's ale turned sour soon after the fair; there had been a  thunder-storm in the interim, and Betty's ale was, as they say in that  country, \"strongest in the water.\" Betty did not understand the first of  these causes, and she did not wish to understand the latter. The ale was  not palatable; and Betty brewed again to the same strength of water.  Again it thundered, and again the swipes became vinegar. Betty was at her  wit's end,--no long journey; but she was breathless.    Having got to her own wit's end, Betty naturally wished to draw upon the  stock of another; and where should she find it in such abundance as with  the minister of the parish. Accordingly, Betty put on her best, got her  nicest basket, laid a couple of bottles of her choicest brandy in the  bottom, and over them a dozen or two of her freshest eggs; and thus  freighted, she fidgetted off to the manse, offered her peace-offering,  and hinted that she wished to speak with his reverence in \"preevat.\"    \"What is your will, Betty?\" said the minister of Dunse. \"An unco uncanny  mishap,\" replied the tapster's wife.    \"Has Mattie not been behaving?\" said the minister. \"Like an innocent  lamb,\" quoth Betty Falla.    \"Then--?\" said the minister, lacking the rest of the query. \"Anent the  yill,\" said Betty.    \"The ale!\" said the minister; \"has any body been drinking and refused to  pay?\"    \"Na,\" said Betty, \"they winna drink a drap.\"    \"And would you have me to encourage the sin of drunkenness?\" asked the  minister.    \"Na, na,\" said Betty, \"far frae that; I only want your kin' han' to get  in yill again as they can drink.\"    \"I am no brewer, Betty,\" said the minister gravely.    \"Gude forfend, Sir,\" said Betty, \"that the like o' you should be evened  to the gyle tub. I dinna wish for ony thing o' the kind.\"--\"Then what is  the matter?\" asked the minister.    \"It's witched, clean witched; as sure as I'm a born woman,\" said Betty.    \"Naebody else will drink it, an' I canna drink it mysel'.\"    \"You must not be superstitious, Betty,\" said the minister. \"I'm no ony  thing o' the kin',\" said Betty, colouring, \"an' ye ken it yoursel'; but  twa brousts wadna be vinegar for naething.\" (She lowered her voice.) \"Ye  mun ken, Sir, that o' a' the leddies frae the Lammermuir, that hae been  comin' and gaen, there was an auld rudas wife this fair, an' I'm certie  she's witched the yill; and ye mun just look into ye'r buiks, an' tak off  the withchin!\"    \"When do you brew, Betty?\"--\"This blessed day, gin it like you, Sir.\"    \"Then, Betty, here is the thing you want, the same malt and water as  usual?\"    --\"Nae difference, Sir?\"    \"Then when you have put the water to the malt, go three times round the  vat with the sun, and in _pli's_ name put in three shoolfu's of malt; and  when you have done that, go three times round the vat, against the sun,  and, in the devil's name, take out three bucketfuls of water; and take my  word for it, the ale will be better.\"    \"Thanks to your reverence; gude mornin.\"--_Ibid_.           *       *       *       *       *      THE GATHERER.          \"A snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.\"                                   SHAKSPEARE.             *       *       *       *       *      SONG.    _By Mr. Gay._        The sun was sunk beneath the hills,      The western clouds were lin'd with gold,    The sky was clear, the winds were still,      The flocks were pent within their fold:    When from the silence of the grove,    Poor Damon thus despair'd of love.      Who seeks to pluck the fragrant rose      From the bare rock, or oozy beach,    Who from each barren weed that grows,      Expects the grape, or blushing peach.    With equal faith may hope to find    The truth of love in woman-kind.      I have no herds, no fleecy care,      No fields that wave with golden grain,    No meadows green, or gardens fair,      A damsel's venal heart to gain.    Then all in vain my sighs must prove,    For I, alas! have naught but love.      How wretched is the faithful youth,     Since women's hearts are bought and          sold,    They ask no vows of sacred truth,      Whene'er they sigh, they sigh for gold.    Gold can the frowns of scorn remove,    But I, alas! have naught but love.      To buy the gems of India's coast,      What gold, what treasure will suffice,    Not all their fire can ever boast      The living lustre of her eyes.    For thee the world too cheap must prove,    But I, alas! have naught but love.

The Italian madrigals of  Luca Marenzio and others are still in request: and among the English  madrigalists we may mention Wilbye, author of \"Flora gave me fairest  flowers;\" Morley, whose \"Now is the month of Maying\" is so modern in its  air, that it is introduced as the finale of one of our most popular operas,  the Duenna; and Michael Este, the composer of the beautiful trio, \"How  merrily we live that Shepherds be.\" This music retains all its original  freshness, and has been listened to, age after age, with unabated pleasure.    The glee, which is a simpler and less elaborate form of the madrigal,--and  that amusing _jeu d'esprit_ so well known by the name of Catch, made their  appearance about the end of the sixteenth century. The first collection of  catches that made its appearance in England is dated in  1609.--_Metropolitan_.           *       *       *       *       *      BENEDICTION ON CHILDREN.

The religion of the south of Europe is still essentially dramatic; and it  may be questioned how far this adaptation to the genius of the people has  tended to perpetuate the influence, not only of the Roman Catholic, but  also of the Greek church. Even in the pulpit, not merely does the earnest  preacher, by vehement gesticulation, by the utmost variety of pause and  intonation, _act_, as far as possible, the scenes which he describes; but  the crucifix, if the expression may be permitted, plays the principal part;  the Saviour is held forth to the multitude in the living and visible  emblem of his sufferings. The ceremonies of the Holy Week in Rome are a  most solemn, and to most minds, affecting religious drama. The oratorios,  as with us, are in general on scriptural subjects; and operas on themes of  equal sanctity are listened to without the least feeling of profanation.  Nor are the more audacious exhibitions of the dark ages by any means  exploded. Every traveller on the continent who has much curiosity, must  have witnessed, whether with devout indignation or mere astonishment, the  strange manner in which scriptural subjects are still represented by  marionnettes, by tableax parlans, or even performed by regular actors. In  the unphilosophized parts of modern Europe, these scenes are witnessed by  the populace, not merely with respect, but with profound interest; and if  they tend to perpetuate superstition, must be acknowledged likewise to  keep alive religious sentiment. But if this be the case in the nineteenth  century, how powerfully must such exhibitions have operated on the general  mind in the dark ages! The alternative lay between total ignorance and  this mode of communicating the truth. For the general mass of the clergy  were then as ignorant as the laity; and as the wild work, which in these  sacred dramas is sometimes made of the scripture history, may be supposed  to have embodied the knowledge of a whole fraternity, we may not unfairly  conjecture the kind of instruction to be obtained from each individual.  The state of language in Europe must have greatly contributed to the  adoption of public instruction, by means of dramatic representation. The  services of the church were in Latin, now become a dead language. This  _originated_, perhaps, rather in sincere reverence, and the dread of  profaning the sacred mysteries by transferring them into the vulgar tongue,  than in any systematic design of keeping the people in the dark; for, from  the gradual extinction of the Latin, as the vernacular idiom, and the  gradual growth of the modern languages, there was no marked period in  which the change might appear to be called for, until the question became  involved with weightier matters of controversy. The confusion of tongues,  almost throughout Europe, before the great predominant languages were  formed out of the conflicting dialects, must greatly have impeded the  preaching the Gospel, for which, in other respects, only a very small part  of the clergy were qualified. Though, in these times, most extraordinary  effects are attributed to the eloquence of certain preachers, for instance,  Fra. Giovanni di Vicenza, yet many of the itinerant friars, the first, we  believe, who addressed the people with great activity in the vulgar tongue,  must have been much circumscribed by the limits of their own patois.[1]  But the spectacle of the dramatic exhibitions everywhere spoke a common  language; and the dialogue, which, in parts of the Chester mysteries, is a  kind of Anglicized French, and which, even if translated into the native  tongue, was constantly interspersed with Latin, and therefore, but darkly  and imperfectly understood, was greatly assisted by the perpetual  interpretation which was presented before the eyes. The vulgar were thus  imperceptibly wrought up to profound feelings of reverence for the purity  of the Virgin; the unexampled sufferings of the Redeemer; the miraculous  powers of the apostles, and the constancy of the martyrs; we must add,  (for after all it was a strange Christianity, though in every respect the  Christianity of the age,) with the most savage detestation at the cruelty  of Herod or Pilate, and the treachery of Judas; and the most revolting  horror, at the hideous appearance, and blasphemous language of the Prince  of Darkness, who almost always played a principal part in these scriptural  dramas.--_Quarterly Review._    [1] It is related in the life of St. Bernard, that his pale and emaciated      appearance, and the animation and the fire, which seemed to kindle his      whole being as he spoke, made so deep an impression on those who could      only see him and hear his voice, that Germans, who understand not a      word of his language, were often moved to tears.--_Neander, Der      Heilige Bernard_, p. 49.           *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY.      BIRMINGHAM RAILWAY.    The line of the proposed plan for this useful and excellent undertaking  has been forwarded to us. We know not whether the projectors are aware  that a straight line is no longer necessary, but that the sharpest turns  may now be made on rail-roads by an American invention, lately carried  into effect in the United States with singular success.--The line of  railway will be 112-1/2 miles. Birmingham being between 3 and 400 feet  higher than London, and the intervening ground much broken, the railway  could not be laid down without an inclination in its planes; the rise,  however, will in no case exceed 1 in 330. The highest point of the line is  on the summit of an inclined plane 15 miles long, rising 13-1/3 feet in  each mile, and is 315 feet above the level at Maiden Lane, London; from  which it is distant 31 miles. The termination at Birmingham is 256 feet  higher than the commencement at London. It is intended that there should  be 10 tunnels--one at Primrose Hill half a mile long, one near Watford a  mile long, and one near Kilsby, 78 miles from London, a mile and a quarter  long. The others are each less than a quarter of a mile in length, with  the exception of one, which is a third of a mile long. They will all be 25  feet in height, well lighted, and ought rather to be called galleries than  tunnels. The strata through which the railway is carried, appear generally  to follow in this order from London:                                            Miles.    London clay and plastic clay          15-1/2    Chalk and chalk flints                18-1/2    Chalk, marl, weald clay, iron sand,      and Oxford clay or clunch clay      20    Great and inferior oolite limestones,      and sandy beds                      18    Lias marls, lias limestone or water      lime and shale beds                 16    Red marl and new red sandstone        24-1/2                                         -------                                         112-1/2    The railway will be composed of two lines of rails with a space between  them of six feet, but at particular points two additional lines will be  required as turns-out to facilitate the passage of the locomotive engines  and carriages. If we assume the average rate of travelling on the railway  to be 20 miles an hour, (which is about the mark,) that 1,200 persons pass  along it in a day, and 120 are conveyed in each train of carriages, then  only ten trains of carriages would be required for all the passengers;  each train would separately take a minute and a half, and the ten trains  not more than fifteen minutes in passing over half a mile of ground. Allow  twice this time for the passage of cattle and merchandise, and it is  manifest that the traffic on railways can never be a source of annoyance  to persons residing near them. All who have travelled in carriages drawn  by locomotive steam-engines on the Liverpool and Manchester railway can  vouch for the safety and comfort,"]]]
