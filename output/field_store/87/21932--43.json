The Picts and  Scots, finding that the Romans had finally relinquished Britain, now  regarded the whole as their prey, and attacked the northern wall with  redoubled forces.  The Britons already subdued by their own fears,  found the ramparts but a weak defence for them; and deserting their  station, left the country entirely open to the inroads of the  barbarous enemy.  The invaders carried devastation and ruin along with  them; and exerted to the utmost their native ferocity, which was not  mitigated by the helpless condition and submissive behaviour of the  inhabitants [t].  The unhappy Britons had a third time recourse to  Rome, which had declared its resolution for ever to abandon them.  Aetius, the patrician, sustained at that time, by his valour and  magnanimity, the tottering ruins of the empire, and revived for a  moment, among the degenerate Romans, the spirit as well as discipline  of their ancestors.  The British ambassador carried to him the letter  of their countrymen, which was inscribed, THE GROANS OF THE BRITONS.  The tenor of the epistle was suitable to its superscription.  THE  BARBARIANS, say they, ON THE ONE HAND, CHASE US INTO THE SEA; THE SEA,  ON THE OTHER, THROWS US BACK UPON THE BARBARIANS; AND WE HAVE ONLY THE  HARD CHOICE LEFT US, OF PERISHING BY THE SWORD OR BY THE WAVES [u].  But Aetius, pressed by the arms of Attila, the most terrible enemy  that ever assailed the empire, had no leisure to attend to the  complaints of allies, whom generosity alone could induce him to assist  [v].  The Britons thus rejected were reduced to despair, deserted  their habitations, abandoned tillage, and flying for protection to the  forests and mountains, suffered equally from hunger and from the  enemy.  The barbarians themselves began to feel the pressure of famine  in a country which they had ravaged; and being harassed by the  dispersed Britons, who had not dared to resist them in a body, they  retreated with their spoils into their own country [w].  [FN [t] Gildas.  Bede, lib. 1.  Ann. Beverl. p. 45.  [u] Gildas.  Bede, lib. 1. cap. 13.  Malmesbury, lib. 1. cap. 1.  Ann. Beverl. p.  45.  [v] Chron. Sax. p. 11 edit. 1692.  [w] Ann. Beverl. p. 45.]    The Britons, taking advantage of this interval, returned to their  usual occupations; and the favourable seasons which succeeded seconded  their industry, made them soon forget their past miseries, and  restored to them great plenty of all the necessaries of life.  No more  can be imagined to have been possessed by a people so rude, who had  not, without the assistance of the Romans, art of masonry sufficient  to raise a stone rampart for their own defence; yet the Monkish  historians [x], who treat of those events, complain of the luxury of  the Britons during this period, and ascribe to that vice, not to their  cowardice or improvident counsels, all their subsequent calamities.  [FN [x] Gildas.  Bede, lib. 1. cap. 14.]    The Britons, entirely occupied in the enjoyment of the present  interval of peace, made no provision for resisting the enemy, who,  invited by their former timid behaviour, soon threatened them with a  new invasion.  We are not exactly informed what species of civil  government the Romans on their departure had left among the Britons;  but it appears probable, that the great men in, the different  districts assumed a kind of regal though precarious authority; and  lived in a great measure independent of each other [y].  To this  disunion of counsels were also added the disputes of theology; and the  disciples of Pelagius, who was himself a native of Britain, having  increased to a great multitude, gave alarm to the clergy, who seem to  have been more intent on suppressing them, than on opposing the public  enemy [z].  Labouring under these domestic evils, and menaced with a  foreign invasion, the Britons attended only to the suggestions of  their present fears; and following the counsels of Vortigern, Prince  of Dumnonium, who, though stained with every vice, possessed the chief  authority among them [a], they sent into Germany a deputation to  invite over the Saxons for their protection and assistance.

Malm. p  8.]    [MN The Saxons.]  Of all the barbarous nations, known either in ancient or modern times,  the Germans seem to have been the most distinguished both by their  manners and political institutions, and to have carried to the highest  pitch the virtues of valour and love of liberty; the only virtues  which can have place among an uncivilized people, where justice and  humanity are commonly neglected.  Kingly government, even when  established among the Germans, (for it was not universal,) possessed a  very limited authority; and though the sovereign was usually chosen  from among the royal family, he was directed in every measure by the  common consent of the nation over whom he presided.  When any  important affairs were transacted, all the warriors met in arms; the  men of greatest authority employed persuasion to engage their consent;  the people expressed their approbation by rattling their armour, or  their dissent by murmurs; there was no necessity for a nice scrutiny  of votes among a multitude, who were usually carried with a strong  current to one side or the other; and the measure thus suddenly chosen  by general agreement, was executed with alacrity and prosecuted with  vigour.  Even in war, the princes governed more by example than by  authority; but in peace the civil union was in a great measure  dissolved, and the inferior leaders administered justice after an  independent manner, each in his particular district.  These were  elected by the votes of the people in their great councils; and though  regard was paid to nobility in the choice, their personal qualities,  chiefly their valour, procured them, from the suffrages of their  fellow-citizens, that honourable but dangerous distinction.  The  warriors of each tribe attached themselves to their leader with the  most devoted affection and most unshaken constancy.  They attended him  as his ornament in peace, as his defence in war, as his council in the  administration of justice.  Their constant emulation in military  renown dissolved not that inviolable friendship which they professed  to their chieftain and to each other: to die for the honour of their  band was their chief ambition: to survive its disgrace, or the death  of their leader, was infamous.  They even carried into the field their  women and children, who adopted all the martial sentiments of the men:  and being thus impelled by every human motive, they were invincible;  where they were not opposed either by the similar manners and  institutions of the neighbouring Germans, or by the superior  discipline, arms, and numbers of the Romans [b].  [FN [b] Caesar, lib. 6.  Tacit. de Mor. Germ.]    The leaders and their military companions were maintained by the  labour of their slaves, or by that of the weaker and less warlike part  of the community, whom they defended.  The contributions which they  levied went not beyond a bare subsistence; and the honours, acquired  by a superior rank, were the only reward of their superior dangers and  fatigues.  All the refined arts of life were unknown among the  Germans: tillage itself was almost wholly neglected: they even seem to  have been anxious to prevent any improvements of that nature; and the  leaders, by annually distributing anew all the land among the  inhabitants of each village, kept them from attaching themselves to  particular possessions, or making such progress in agriculture as  might divert their attention from military expeditions, the chief  occupation of the community [c].  [FN [c] Caesar, lib. 6.  Tacit. de Mor. Germ.]    The Saxons had been for some time regarded as one of the most warlike  tribes of this fierce people, and had become the terror of the  neighbouring nations [d].  They had diffused themselves from the  northern parts of Germany and the Cimbrian Chersonesus, and had taken  possession of all the sea-coast from the mouth of the Rhine to  Jutland; whence they had long infested by their piracies all the  eastern and southern parts of Britain, and the northern of Gaul [e].  In order to oppose their inroads, the Romans had established an  officer, whom they called COUNT OF THE SAXON SHORE; and as the naval  arts can flourish among a civilized people alone, they seem to have  been more successful in repelling the Saxons, than any of the other  barbarians by whom they were invaded.  The dissolution of the Roman  power invited them to renew their inroads; and it was an acceptable  circumstance, that the deputies of the Britons appeared among them,  and prompted them to undertake an enterprise, to which they were of  themselves sufficiently inclined [f].  [FN d Amm. Marcell. lib. 28.  Orosius.  [e] Marcell. lib. 27. cap. 7.  lib. 28. cap. 7.  [f] Will. Malm. p. 8.]    Hengist and Horsa, two brothers, possessed great credit among the  Saxons, and were much celebrated both for their valour and nobility.  They were reputed, as most of the Saxon princes, to be sprung from  Woden, who was worshipped as a god among those nations, and they are  said to be his great grandsons [g]; a circumstance which added much to  their authority.  We shall not attempt to trace any higher the origin  of those princes and nations.  It is evident what fruitless labour it  must be to search, in those barbarous and illiterate ages, for the  annals of a people, when their first leaders, known in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10580"],[0,"The Positive School of Criminology (#7)"],[1,"the penalty, very  strong and fundamental reasons which are not to be found in the threats  of legislators. These threats, if nevertheless carried out by police and  prison keepers, run counter to those conditions. A man who intends to  commit a crime, or who is carried away by a violent passion, by a  psychological hurricane which drowns his moral sense, is not checked by  threats of punishment, because the volcanic eruption of passion prevents  him from reflecting. Or he may decide to commit a crime after due  premeditation and preparation, and in that case the penalty is  powerless to check him, because he hopes to escape with impunity. All  criminals will tell you unanimously that the only thing which impelled  them when they were deliberating a crime was the expectation that they  would go scot free. If they had but the least suspicion that they might  be detected and punished they would not have committed the crime. The  only exception is the case in which a crime is the result of a mental  explosion caused by a violent outburst of passion. And if you wish to  have a very convincing illustration of the psychological inefficacy of  legal threats, you have but to think of that curious crime which has now  assumed a frequency never known to former centuries, namely the making  of counterfeit money. For since paper money--from want or for reasons of  expediency--has become a substitute of metal coin in the civilized  countries, the making of counterfeit paper money has become very  frequent in the nineteenth century. Now a counterfeiter, in committing  his crime, must compel his mind to imitate closely the inscription of  the bill, letter for letter, including that threatening passage, which  says: _\"The law punishes counterfeiting_ ...\" etc. Can you see before  your mind's eye a counterfeiter, in the act of engraving on the stone or  the others may ignore the penalty that awaits them, but he cannot. This  illustration is convincing, for in cases of other crimes one may always  assume that the criminal acted without thinking of the future, even when  he was not in a transport of passion. But in the case of the  counterfeiter the very act of committing the crime reminds him of the  threat of the law, and yet he is imperturbable while perpetrating it.    Crime has its natural causes, which lie outside of that mathematical  point called the free will of the criminal. Aside from being a juridical  phenomenon, which it would be well to examine by itself, every crime is  above all a natural and social phenomenon, and should be studied  primarily as such. We need not go through so hard a course of study  merely for the purpose of walking over the razor edge of juristic  definitions and to find out, for instance, that from the time Romagnosi  made a distinction between incompleted and attempted crime rivers of ink  have been spilled in the attempt to find the distinguishing elements of  these two degrees of crime. And finally, when the German legislator  concluded to make no distinction between incompleted and attempted crime  and to recognize only the completed crime in his code of 1871, we  witnessed the spectacle of Carrara praising that legislator for leaving  that subtile distinction out of his code. A strange conclusion on the  part of a science, which cudgels its brains for a century to find the  marks of distinction between attempted and incompleted crime, and then  praises the legislator for ignoring it. And another classic jurist,  Buccellati, proposed to do away with the theory of attempted crime by  simply defining it as a crime by itself, or as--a violation of police  laws! A science which comes to such conclusions is a science which moves  in metaphysical abstractions, and we shall see that all these finespun  questions which abound in classical science lose all practical value  before the necessity of saving society from the plague of crime.    The method which we, on the other hand, have inaugurated is the  following: Before we study crime from the point of view of a juristic  phenomenon, we must study the causes to which the annual recurrence of  crimes in all countries is due. These are natural causes, which I have  classified under the three heads of anthropological, telluric and  social. Every crime, from the smallest to the most atrocious, is the  result of the interaction of these three causes, the anthropological  condition of the criminal, the telluric environment in which he is  living, and the social environment in which he is born, living and  operating. It is a vain beginning to separate the meshes of this net of  criminality. There are still those who would maintain the one-sided  standpoint that the origin of crime may be traced to only one of these  elements, for instance, to the social element alone. So far as I am  concerned, I have combatted this opinion from the very inauguration of  the positive school of criminology, and I combat it today. It is  certainly easy enough to think that the entire origin of all crime is  due to the unfavorable social conditions in which the criminal lives.  But an objective, methodical, observation demonstrates that social  conditions alone do not suffice to explain the origin of criminality,  although it is true that the prevalence of the influence of social  conditions is an incontestable fact in the case of the greater number  of crimes, especially of the lesser ones. But there are crimes which  cannot be explained by the influence of social conditions alone. If you  regard the general condition of misery as the sole source of  criminality, then you cannot get around the difficulty that out of one  thousand individuals living in misery from the day of their birth to  that of their death only one hundred or two hundred become criminals,  while the other nine hundred or eight hundred either sink into  biological weakness, or become harmless maniacs, or commit suicide  without perpetrating any crime. If poverty were the sole determining  cause, one thousand out of one thousand poor ought to become criminals.  If only two hundred become criminals, while one hundred commit suicide,  one hundred end as maniacs, and the other six hundred remain honest in  their social condition, then poverty alone is not sufficient to explain  criminality. We must add the anthropological and telluric factor. Only  by means of these three elements of natural influence can criminality be  explained. Of course, the influence of either the anthropological or  telluric or social element varies from case to case. If you have a case  of simple theft, you may have a far greater influence of the social  factor than of the anthropological factor. On the other hand, if you  have a case of murder, the anthropological element will have a far  greater influence than the social. And so on in every case of crime, and  every individual that you will have to judge on the bench of the  criminal.    The anthropological factor. It is precisely here that the genius of  Cesare Lombroso established a new science, because in his search after  the causes of crime he studied the anthropological condition of the  criminal. This condition concerns not only the organic and anatomical  constitution, but also the psychological, it represents the organic and  psychological personality of the criminal. Every one of us inherits at  birth, and personifies in life, a certain organic and psychological  combination. This constitutes the individual factor of human activity,  which either remains normal through life, or becomes criminal or insane.  The anthropological factor, then, must not be restricted, as some laymen  would restrict it, to the study of the form of the skull or the bones  of the criminal. Lombroso had to begin his studies with the anatomical  conditions of the criminal, because the skulls may be studied most  easily in the museums. But he continued by also studying the brain and  the other physiological conditions of the individual, the state of  sensibility, and the circulation of matter. And this entire series of  studies is but a necessary scientific introduction to the study of the  psychology of the criminal, which is precisely the one problem that is  of direct and immediate importance. It is this problem which the lawyer  and the public prosecutor should solve before discussing the juridical  aspect of any crime, for this reveals the causes which induced the  criminal to commit a crime. At present there is no methodical standard  for a psychological investigation, although such an investigation was  introduced into the scope of classic penal law. But for this reason the  results of the positive school penetrate into the lecture rooms of the  universities of jurisprudence, whenever a law is required for the  judicial arraignment of the criminal as a living and feeling human  being. And even though the positive school is not mentioned, all profess  to be studying the material furnished by it, for instance, its analyses  of the sentiments of the criminal, his moral sense, his behavior before,  during and after the criminal act, the presence of remorse which people,  judging the criminal after their own feelings, always suppose the  criminal to feel, while, in fact, it is seldom present. This is the  anthropological factor, which may assume a pathological form, in which  case articles 46 and 47 of the penal code remember that there is such a  thing as the personality of the criminal. However, aside from insanity,  there are thousands of other organic and psychological conditions of the  personality of criminals, which a judge might perhaps lump together  under the name of extenuating circumstances, but which science desires  to have thoroughly investigated. This is not done today, and for this  reason the idea of extenuating circumstances constitutes a denial of  justice.    This same anthropological factor also includes that which each one of us  has: the race character. Nowadays the"]]]
