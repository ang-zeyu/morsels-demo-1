'Tis vain for us to strive against the king.  The world pertains to him:--shall we alone,  In mad, presumptuous obstinacy strive  To break that mighty chain of lands, which he  Hath drawn around us with his giant grasp.  His are the markets, his the courts; his too  The highways; nay, the very carrier's horse,  That traffics on the Gotthardt, pays him toll.  By his dominions, as within a net,  We are enclosed, and girded round about.  --And will the empire shield us? Say, can it  Protect itself 'gainst Austria's growing power?  To God, and not to emperors, must we look!  What store can on their promises be placed,  When they, to meet their own necessities,  Can pawn, and even alienate the towns  That flee for shelter 'neath the eagle's wings? [13]  No, uncle. It is wise and wholesome prudence,  In times like these, when faction's all abroad,  To own attachment to some mighty chief.  The imperial crown's transferred from line to line, [14]  It has no memory for faithful service:  But to secure the favor of these great  Hereditary masters, were to sow  Seed for a future harvest.    ATTINGHAUSEN.                Art so wise?  Wilt thou see clearer than thy noble sires,  Who battled for fair freedom's costly gem,  With life, and fortune, and heroic arm?  Sail down the lake to Lucerne, there inquire,  How Austria's rule doth weigh the Cantons down.  Soon she will come to count our sheep, our cattle,  To portion out the Alps, e'en to their summits,  And in our own free woods to hinder us  From striking down the eagle or the stag;  To set her tolls on every bridge and gate,  Impoverish us to swell her lust of sway,  And drain our dearest blood to feed her wars.  No, if our blood must flow, let it be shed  In our own cause! We purchase liberty  More cheaply far than bondage.    RUDENZ.                   What can we,  A shepherd race, against great Albert's hosts?    ATTINGHAUSEN.  Learn, foolish boy, to know this shepherd race!  I know them, I have led them on in fight--  I saw them in the battle at Favenz.  Austria will try, forsooth, to force on us  A yoke we are determined not to bear!  Oh, learn to feel from what a race thou'rt sprung!  Cast not, for tinsel trash and idle show,  The precious jewel of thy worth away.  To be the chieftain of a freeborn race,  Bound to thee only by their unbought love,  Ready to stand--to fight--to die with thee,  Be that thy pride, be that thy noblest boast!  Knit to thy heart the ties of kindred--home--  Cling to the land, the dear land of thy sires,  Grapple to that with thy whole heart and soul!  Thy power is rooted deep and strongly here,  But in yon stranger world thou'lt stand alone,  A trembling reed beat down by every blast.  Oh come! 'tis long since we have seen thee, Uly!  Tarry but this one day. Only to-day  Go not to Altdorf. Wilt thou? Not to-day!  For this one day bestow thee on thy friends.       [Takes his hand.    RUDENZ.  I gave my word. Unhand me! I am bound.    ATTINGHAUSEN (drops his hand and says sternly).  Bound, didst thou say? Oh yes, unhappy boy,  Thou art, indeed. But not by word or oath.  'Tis by the silken mesh of love thou'rt bound.       [RUDENZ turns away.    Ay, hide thee, as thou wilt. 'Tis she, I know,  Bertha of Bruneck, draws thee to the court;  'Tis she that chains thee to the emperor's service.  Thou think'st to win the noble, knightly maid,  By thy apostacy. Be not deceived.  She is held out before thee as a lure;  But never meant for innocence like thine.    RUDENZ.  No more; I've heard enough. So fare you well.                       [Exit.    ATTINGHAUSEN.  Stay, Uly! Stay! Rash boy, he's gone! I can  Nor hold him back, nor save him from destruction.  And so the Wolfshot has deserted us;--  Others will follow his example soon.  This foreign witchery, sweeping o'er our hills,  Tears with its potent spell our youth away:  O luckless hour, when men and manners strange  Into these calm and happy valleys came,  To warp our primitive and guileless ways.  The new is pressing on with might. The old,  The good, the simple, fleeteth fast away.  New times come on. A race is springing up,  That think not as their fathers thought before!  What do I here? All, all are in the grave  With whom ere while I moved and held converse;  My age has long been laid beneath the sod:  Happy the man who may not live to see  What shall be done by those that follow me!        SCENE II.       A meadow surrounded by high rocks and wooded ground. On the     rocks are tracks, with rails and ladders, by which the peasants     are afterwards seen descending. In the background the lake is     observed, and over it a moon rainbow in the early part of the scene.     The prospect is closed by lofty mountains, with glaciers rising     behind them. The stage is dark, but the lake and glaciers glisten     in the moonlight.       MELCHTHAL, BAUMGARTEN, WINKELRIED, MEYER VON SARNEN, BURKHART AM     BUHEL, ARNOLD VON SEWA, KLAUS VON DER FLUE, and four other peasants,     all armed.    MELCHTHAL (behind the scenes).  The mountain pass is open. Follow me  I see the rock, and little cross upon it:  This is the spot; here is the Rootli.       [They enter with torches.    WINKELRIED.                      Hark!    SEWA.  The coast is clear.    MEYER.             None of our comrades come?  We are the first, we Unterwaldeners.    MELCHTHAL.  How far is't in the night?    BAUMGARTEN.                 The beacon watch  Upon the Selisberg has just called two.       [A bell is heard at a distance.    MEYER.  Hush! Hark!    BUHEL.         The forest chapel's matin bell  Chimes clearly o'er the lake from Switzerland.    FLUE.  The air is clear, and bears the sound so far.    MELCHTHAL.  Go, you and you, and light some broken boughs,  Let's bid them welcome with a cheerful blaze.                   [Two peasants exeunt.    SEWA.  The moon shines fair to-night. Beneath its beams  The lake reposes, bright as burnished steel.    BUHEL.  They'll have an easy passage.    WINKELRIED (pointing to the lake).                    Ha! look there!  See you nothing?    MEYER.           What is it? Ay, indeed!  A rainbow in the middle of the night.    MELCHTHAL.  Formed by the bright reflection of the moon!    FLUE.  A sign most strange and wonderful, indeed!  Many there be who ne'er have seen the like.    SEWA.  'Tis doubled, see, a paler one above!    BAUMGARTEN.  A boat is gliding yonder right beneath it.    MELCHTHAL.  That must be Werner Stauffacher! I knew  The worthy patriot would not tarry long.       [Goes with BAUMGARTEN towards the shore.    MEYER.  The Uri men are like to be the last.    BUHEL.  They're forced to take a winding circuit through  The mountains; for the viceroy's spies are out.       [In the meanwhile the two peasants have kindled a fire     in the centre of the stage.    MELCHTHAL (on the shore).  Who's there? The word?    STAUFFACHER (from below).               Friends of the country.       [All retire up the stage, towards the party landing from the boat.     Enter STAUFFACHER, ITEL, REDING, HANS AUF DER MAUER, JORG IM HOPE,     CONRAD HUNN, ULRICH DER SCHMIDT, JOST VON WEILER, and three other     peasants, armed.    ALL.                            Welcome!       [While the rest remain behind exchanging greetings, MELCHTHAL comes     forward with STAUFFACHER.    MELCHTHAL.  Oh, worthy Stauffacher, I've looked but now  On him, who could not look on me again.  I've laid my hands upon his rayless eyes,  And on their vacant orbits sworn a vow  Of vengeance, only to be cooled in blood.    STAUFFACHER.  Speak not of vengeance. We are here to meet  The threatened evil, not to avenge the past.  Now tell me what you've done, and what secured,  To aid the common cause in Unterwald.  How stands the peasantry disposed, and how  Yourself escaped the wiles of treachery?    MELCHTHAL.  Through the Surenen's fearful mountain chain,  Where dreary ice-fields stretch on every side,  And sound is none, save the hoarse vulture's cry,  I reached the Alpine pasture, where the herds  From Uri and from Engelberg resort,  And turn their cattle forth to graze in common.  Still as I went along, I slaked my thirst  With the coarse oozings of the lofty glacier,  That through the crevices come foaming down,  And turned to rest me in the herdsman's cots, [15]  Where I was host and guest, until I gained  The cheerful homes and social haunts of men.  Already through these distant vales had spread  The rumor of this last atrocity;  And wheresoe'er I went, at every door,  Kind words and gentle looks were there to greet me.  I found these simple spirits all in arms  Against our rulers' tyrannous encroachments.  For as their Alps through each succeeding year  Yield the same roots,--their streams flow ever on  In the same channels,--nay, the clouds and winds  The selfsame course unalterably pursue,  So have old customs there, from sire to son,  Been handed down, unchanging and unchanged;  Nor will they brook to swerve or turn aside  From the fixed, even tenor of their life.  With grasp of their hard hands they welcomed me--  Took from the walls their rusty falchions down--  And from their eyes the soul of valor flashed  With joyful lustre, as I spoke those names,  Sacred to every peasant in the mountains,  Your own and Walter Fuerst's. Whate'er your voice  Should dictate as the right they swore to do;  And you they swore to follow e'en to death.  So sped I on from house to house, secure  In the guest's sacred privilege--and when  I reached at last the valley of my home,  Where dwell my kinsmen, scattered far and near--  And when I found my father stripped and blind,  Upon the stranger's straw, fed by the alms  Of charity----    STAUFFACHER.         Great heaven!    MELCHTHAL.                 Yet wept I not!  No--not in weak and unavailing tears  Spent I the force of my fierce, burning anguish;  Deep in my bosom,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6791"],[0,"Mary Stuart: A Tragedy (#6)"],[1," Whatever in a rightful war is just  And loyal, 'tis my right to exercise:  Murder alone, the secret, bloody deed,  My conscience and my pride alike forbid.  Murder would stain me, would dishonor me:  Dishonor me, my lord, but not condemn me,  Nor subject me to England's courts of law:  For 'tis not justice, but mere violence,  Which is the question 'tween myself and England.    BURLEIGH (significantly).  Talk not, my lady, of the dreadful right  Of power: 'tis seldom on the prisoner's side.    MARY.  I am the weak, she is the mighty one:  'Tis well, my lord; let her, then, use her power;  Let her destroy me; let me bleed, that she  May live secure; but let her, then, confess  That she hath exercised her power alone,  And not contaminate the name of justice.  Let her not borrow from the laws the sword  To rid her of her hated enemy;  Let her not clothe in this religious garb  The bloody daring of licentious might;  Let not these juggling tricks deceive the world.       [Returning the sentence.    Though she may murder me, she cannot judge me:  Let her no longer strive to join the fruits  Of vice with virtue's fair and angel show;  But let her dare to seem the thing she is.                       [Exit.        SCENE VIII.       BURLEIGH, PAULET.    BURLEIGH.  She scorns us, she defies us! will defy us,  Even at the scaffold's foot. This haughty heart  Is not to be subdued. Say, did the sentence  Surprise her? Did you see her shed one tear,  Or even change her color? She disdains  To make appeal to our compassion. Well  She knows the wavering mind of England's queen.  Our apprehensions make her bold.    PAULET.                   My lord,  Take the pretext away which buoys it up,  And you shall see this proud defiance fail  That very moment. I must say, my lord,  Irregularities have been allowed  In these proceedings; Babington and Ballard  Should have been brought, with her two secretaries,  Before her, face to face.    BURLEIGH.                No, Paulet, no.  That was not to be risked; her influence  Upon the human heart is too supreme;  Too strong the female empire of her tears.  Her secretary, Curl, if brought before her,  And called upon to speak the weighty word  On which her life depends, would straight shrink back  And fearfully revoke his own confession.    PAULET.  Then England's enemies will fill the world  With evil rumors; and the formal pomp  Of these proceedings to the minds of all  Will only signalize an act of outrage.    BURLEIGH.  That is the greatest torment of our queen,  [That she can never 'scape the blame. Oh God!]  Had but this lovely mischief died before  She set her faithless foot on English ground.    PAULET.  Amen, say I!    BURLEIGH.         Had sickness but consumed her!    PAULET.  England had been secured from such misfortune.    BURLEIGH.  And yet, if she had died in nature's course,  The world would still have called us murderers.    PAULET.  'Tis true, the world will think, despite of us,  Whate'er it list.    BURLEIGH.            Yet could it not be proved?  And it would make less noise.      PAULET.                  Why, let it make  What noise it may. It is not clamorous blame,  'Tis righteous censure only which can wound.    BURLEIGH.  We know that holy justice cannot 'scape  The voice of censure; and the public cry  Is ever on the side of the unhappy:  Envy pursues the laurelled conqueror;  The sword of justice, which adorns the man,  Is hateful in a woman's hand; the world  Will give no credit to a woman's justice  If woman be the victim. Vain that we,  The judges, spoke what conscience dictated;  She has the royal privilege of mercy;  She must exert it: 'twere not to be borne,  Should she let justice take its full career.    PAULET.  And therefore----    BURLEIGH.           Therefore should she live? Oh, no,  She must not live; it must not be. 'Tis this,  Even this, my friend, which so disturbs the queen,  And scares all slumber from her couch; I read  Her soul's distracting contest in her eyes:  She fears to speak her wishes, yet her looks,  Her silent looks, significantly ask,  \"Is there not one amongst my many servants  To save me from this sad alternative?  Either to tremble in eternal fear  Upon my throne, or else to sacrifice  A queen of my own kindred on the block?\"    PAULET.  'Tis even so; nor can it be avoided----    BURLEIGH.  Well might it be avoided, thinks the queen,  If she had only more attentive servants.    PAULET.  How more attentive?    BURLEIGH.             Such as could interpret  A silent mandate.    PAULET.            What? A silent mandate!    BURLEIGH.  Who, when a poisonous adder is delivered  Into their hands, would keep the treacherous charge  As if it were a sacred, precious jewel?    PAULET.  A precious jewel is the queen's good name  And spotless reputation: good my lord,  One cannot guard it with sufficient care.    BURLEIGH.  When out of Shrewsbury's hands the Queen of Scots  Was trusted to Sir Amias Paulet's care,  The meaning was----    PAULET.            I hope to God, my lord,  The meaning was to give the weightiest charge  Into the purest hands; my lord, my lord!  By heaven I had disdained this bailiff's office  Had I not thought the service claimed the care  Of the best man that England's realm can boast.  Let me not think I am indebted for it  To anything but my unblemished name.    BURLEIGH.  Spread the report she wastes; grows sicker still  And sicker; and expires at last in peace;  Thus will she perish in the world's remembrance,  And your good name is pure.    PAULET.                 But not my conscience.    BURLEIGH.  Though you refuse us, sir, your own assistance,  You will not sure prevent another's hand.    PAULET.  No murderer's foot shall e'er approach her threshold  Whilst she's protected by my household gods.  Her life's a sacred trust; to me the head  Of Queen Elizabeth is not more sacred.  Ye are the judges; judge, and break the staff;  And when 'tis time then let the carpenter  With axe and saw appear to build the scaffold.  My castle's portals shall be open to him,  The sheriff and the executioners:  Till then she is intrusted to my care;  And be assured I will fulfil my trust,  She shall nor do nor suffer what's unjust.                        [Exeunt.          ACT II.    SCENE I.       London, a Hall in the Palace of Westminster. The EARL OF KENT     and SIR WILLIAM DAVISON meeting.    DAVISON.  Is that my Lord of Kent? So soon returned?  Is then the tourney, the carousal over?    KENT.  How now? Were you not present at the tilt?    DAVISON.  My office kept me here.    KENT.               Believe me, sir,  You've lost the fairest show which ever state  Devised, or graceful dignity performed:  For beauty's virgin fortress was presented  As by desire invested; the Earl-Marshal,  The Lord-High Admiral, and ten other knights  Belonging to the queen defended it,  And France's cavaliers led the attack.  A herald marched before the gallant troop,  And summoned, in a madrigal, the fortress;  And from the walls the chancellor replied;  And then the artillery was played, and nosegays  Breathing delicious fragrance were discharged  From neat field-pieces; but in vain, the storm  Was valiantly resisted, and desire  Was forced, unwillingly, to raise the siege.    DAVISON.  A sign of evil-boding, good my lord,  For the French Suitors.    KENT.               Why, you know that this  Was but in sport; when the attack's in earnest  The fortress will, no doubt, capitulate.    DAVISON.  Ha! think you so? I never can believe it.    KENT.  The hardest article of all is now  Adjusted and acceded to by France;  The Duke of Anjou is content to hold  His holy worship in a private chapel;  And openly he promises to honor  And to protect the realm's established faith.  Had ye but heard the people's joyful shouts  Where'er the tidings spread, for it has been  The country's constant fear the queen might die  Without immediate issue of her body;  And England bear again the Romish chains  If Mary Stuart should ascend the throne.    DAVISON.  This fear appears superfluous; she goes  Into the bridal chamber; Mary Stuart  Enters the gates of death.    KENT.                The queen approaches.        SCENE II.       Enter ELIZABETH, led in by LEICESTER, COUNT AUBESPINE,     BELLIEVRE, LORDS SHREWSBURY and BURLEIGH, with other     French and English gentlemen.    ELIZABETH (to AUBESPINE).  Count, I am sorry for these noblemen  Whose gallant zeal hath brought them over sea  To visit these our shores, that they, with us,  Must miss the splendor of St. Germain's court.  Such pompous festivals of godlike state  I cannot furnish as the royal court  Of France. A sober and contented people,  Which crowd around me with a thousand blessings  Whene'er in public I present myself:  This is the spectacle which I can show,  And not without some pride, to foreign eyes.  The splendor of the noble dames who bloom  In Catherine's beauteous garden would, I know,  Eclipse myself, and my more modest merits.    AUBESPINE.  The court of England has one lady only  To show the wondering foreigner; but all  That charms our hearts in the accomplished sex  Is seen united in her single person.    BELLIEVRE.  Great majesty of England, suffer us  To take our leave, and to our royal master,  The Duke of Anjou, bring the happy news.  The hot impatience of his heart would not  Permit him to remain at Paris; he  At Amiens awaits the joyful tidings;  And thence to Calais reach his posts to bring  With winged swiftness to his tranced ear  The sweet consent which, still we humbly hope,  Your royal lips will graciously pronounce.    ELIZABETH.  Press me no further now, Count Bellievre.  It is not now a time, I must repeat,  To kindle here the joyful marriage torch.  The heavens lower black and heavy o'er this land;  And weeds of mourning would become me better  Than the magnificence of bridal robes.  A fatal blow is aimed against my heart;  A blow which threatens to oppress my house. "]]]
