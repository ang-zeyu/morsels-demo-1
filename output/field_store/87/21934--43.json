He  translated this nobleman's life, as also many of his letters, and his  twelve receipts of good life, which are extant in the beginning of his  English works. For this end he also wrote a treatise of the four last  things, which he did not quite finish, being called to other studies.    At his meals he was very abstemious, nor ever eat but of one dish,  which was most commonly powdered beef, or some such saltmeat. In his  youth he abstained wholly from wine; and as he was temperate in his  diet, so was he heedless and negligent in his apparel. Being once told  by his secretary Mr. Harris, that his shoes were all torn, he bad him  tell his man to buy him new ones, whose business it was to take care  of his cloaths, whom for this cause he called his tutor. His first  wife's name was Jane Cole, descended of a genteel family, who bore him  four children, and upon her decease, which in not many years happened,  he married a second time a widow, one Mrs. Alice Middleton, by whom he  had no children. This he says he did not to indulge his passions (for  he observes that it it harder to keep chastity in wedlock than in a  single life,) but to take care of his children and houshold affairs.  Upon what principle this observation is founded, I cannot well  conceive, and wish Sir Thomas had given his reasons why it is harder  to be chaste in a married than single life. This wife was a worldly  minded woman, had a very indifferent person, was advanced in years,  and possessed no very agreeable temper. Much about this time he became  obnoxious to Henry VII for opposing his exactions upon the people.  Henry was a covetous mean prince, and entirely devoted to the  council of Emson and Dudley, who then were very justly reckoned the  caterpillars of the state. The King demanded a large subsidy to bestow  on his eldest daughter, who was then about to be married to James IV.  of Scotland. Sir Thomas being one of the burgesses, so influenced the  lower house by the force of his arguments, (who were cowardly enough  before not to oppose the King) that they refused the demands, upon  which Mr. Tiler of the King's Privy-Chambers went presently to  his Majesty, and told him that More had disappointed all their  expectations, which circumstance not a little enraged him against  More. Upon this Henry was base enough to pick a quarrel without a  cause against Sir John More, his venerable father, and in revenge to  the son, clapt him in the Tower, keeping him there prisoner till he  had forced him to pay one hundred pounds of a fine, for no offence.  King Henry soon after dying, his son who began his reign with some  popular acts, tho' afterwards he degenerated into a monstrous tyrant,  caused Dudley and Emson to be impeached of high treason for giving bad  advice to his father; and however illegal such an arraignment might  be, yet they met the just fate of oppressors and traitors to their  country.    About the year 1516, he composed his famous book called the Utopia,  and gained by it great reputation. Soon after it was published, it  was translated both into French and Italian, Dutch and English. Dr.  Stapleton enumerates the opinions of a great many learned men in its  favour. This work tho' not writ in verse, yet in regard of the fancy  and invention employed in composing it, may well enough pass for an  allegorical poem. It contains the idea of a compleat Commonwealth in  an imaginary island, (pretended to be lately discovered in America)  and that so well counterfeited, that many upon reading it, mistook it  for a real truth, in so much (says Winstanly) that some learned men,  as Budeus, Johannes Plaudanus, out of a principle of fervent zeal,  wished that some excellent divines might be sent hither to preach  Christ's Gospel.    Much about the same time he wrote the history of Richard III. which  was likewise held in esteem; these works were undertaken when he was  discharged from the business of the state.    Roper, in his life of our author, relates that upon an occasion in  which King Henry VIII. and the Pope were parties in a cause tryed in  the Star Chamber, Sir Thomas most remarkably distinguished himself,  and became so great a favourite with that discerning monarch, that he  could no longer forbear calling him into his service.    A ship of the Pope's, by the violence of a storm was driven into  Southampton, which the King claimed as a forfeiture; when the day of  hearing came on before the Lord High Chancellor, and other Judges,  More argued so forcibly in favour of the Pope, that tho' the Judges  had resolved to give it for the King, yet they altered their opinion,  and confirmed the Pope's right. In a short time after this, he was  created a Knight, and after the death of Mr. Weston, he was made  Treasurer of the Exchequer, and one of the Privy Council. He was now  Speaker of the House of Commons, and thus exalted in dignity, the  eyes of the nation were fixed upon him. Wolsey, who then governed the  realm, found himself much grieved by the Burgesses, because all their  transactions were so soon made public, and wanting a fresh subsidy,  came to the house in person to complain of this usage. When the  burgesses heard of his coming, it was long debated whether they should  admit him or no, and Sir Thomas strongly urged that he should be  admitted, for this reason, that if he shall find fault with the  spreading of our secrets, (says he) we may lay the blame upon those  his Grace brought with him. The proud Churchman having entered the  House, made a long speech for granting the subsidy, and asked several  of the Members opinion concerning it; they were all so confounded as  not to be able to answer, and the House at last resolved that their  Speaker should reply for them. Upon this Sir Thomas shewed that the  cardinal's coming into the House was unprecedented, illegal, and a  daring insult on the liberty of the burgesses, and that the subsidy  demanded was unnecessary; upon which Wolsey suddenly departed in  a rage, and ever after entertained suspicions of More, and became  jealous of his great abilities. Our author's fame was not confined  to England only; all the scholars and statesmen in every country in  Europe had heard of, and corresponded with him, but of all strangers  he had a peculiar esteem for Erasmus, who took a journey into England  in order to converse with him, and enter more minutely into the merit  of one whose learning he had so high an opinion of. They agreed to  meet first at my Lord Mayor's table, and as they were personally  unknown, to make the experiment whether they could discover one  another by conversation. They met accordingly, and remained some hours  undiscovered; at last an argument was started in which both engaged  with great keenness, Erasmus designedly defended the unpopular side,  but finding himself so strongly pressed, that he could hold it no  longer, he broke out in an extasy, aut tu es Morus, aut Nullus. Upon  which More replied, aut tu es Erasmus, aut Diabolus, as at that time  Erasmus was striving to defend very impious propositions, in order to  put his antagonist's strength to the proof.    When he lived in the city of London as a justice of peace, he used  to attend the sessions at Newgate. There was then upon the bench a  venerable old judge, who was very severe against those who had their  purses cut; (as the phrase then was) and told them that it was by  their negligence that so many purse-cutters came before him. Sir  Thomas, who was a great lover of a joke, contrived to have this  judge's purse cut from him in the sessions house by a felon. When the  felon was arraigned, he told the court, that if he were permitted to  speak to one of the judges in private, he could clear his innocence to  them; they indulged him in his request, and he made choice of this old  judge, and while he whispered something in his ear, he slily cut away  his purse; the judge returned to the bench, and the felon made a sign  to Sir Thomas of his having accomplished the scheme. Sir Thomas moved  the court, that each of them should bestow some alms on a needy person  who then stood falsly accused, and was a real object of compassion.  The motion was agreed to, and when the old man came to put his hand in  his purse, he was astonished to find it gone, and told the court,  that he was sure he had it when he came there. What, says More in  a pleasant manner, do you charge any of us with felony? the judge  beginning to be angry, our facetious author desired the felon, to  return his purse, and advised the old man never to be so bitter  against innocent men's negligence, when he himself could not keep his  purse safe in that open assembly.    Although he lived a courtier, and was much concerned in business, yet  he never neglected his family at home, but instructed his daughters  in all useful learning, and conversed familiarly with them; he was  remarkably fond of his eldest daughter Margaret, as she had a greater  capacity, and sprightlier genius than the rest. His children often  used to translate out of Latin, into English, and out of English into  Latin, and Dr. Stapleton observes, that he hath seen an apology of Sir  Thomas More's to the university of Oxford, in defence of learning,  turned into Latin by one of his daughters, and translated again into  English by another. Margaret, whose wit was superior to the rest, writ  a treatise on the four last things, which Sir Thomas declared was  finer than his; she composed several Orations, especially one in  answer to Quintilian, defending a rich man, which he accused for  having poisoned a poor man's bees with certain venomous flowers in his  garden, so eloquent and forcible that it may justly rival Quintilian  himself. She also translated Eusebius out of Greek."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106"],[0,"Jungle Tales of Tarzan (#7)"],[1," and completely as though they had been  swallowed by the earth, and later, at night, their dead bodies had  fallen, as from the heavens, into the village street.    This fearsome creature had appeared by night in the huts of the  village, killed, and disappeared, leaving behind him in the huts with  his dead, strange and terrifying evidences of an uncanny sense of humor.    But now he was in their power! No longer could he terrorize them.  Slowly the realization of this dawned upon them.  A woman, screaming,  ran forward and struck the ape-man across the face.  Another and  another followed her example, until Tarzan of the Apes was surrounded  by a fighting, clawing, yelling mob of natives.    And then Mbonga, the chief, came, and laying his spear heavily across  the shoulders of his people, drove them from their prey.    \"We will save him until night,\" he said.    Far out in the jungle Tantor, the elephant, his first panic of fear  allayed, stood with up-pricked ears and undulating trunk.  What was  passing through the convolutions of his savage brain? Could he be  searching for Tarzan?  Could he recall and measure the service the  ape-man had performed for him? Of that there can be no doubt.  But did  he feel gratitude? Would he have risked his own life to have saved  Tarzan could he have known of the danger which confronted his friend?  You will doubt it.  Anyone at all familiar with elephants will doubt  it.  Englishmen who have hunted much with elephants in India will tell  you that they never have heard of an instance in which one of these  animals has gone to the aid of a man in danger, even though the man had  often befriended it.  And so it is to be doubted that Tantor would have  attempted to overcome his instinctive fear of the black men in an  effort to succor Tarzan.    The screams of the infuriated villagers came faintly to his sensitive  ears, and he wheeled, as though in terror, contemplating flight; but  something stayed him, and again he turned about, raised his trunk, and  gave voice to a shrill cry.    Then he stood listening.    In the distant village where Mbonga had restored quiet and order, the  voice of Tantor was scarcely audible to the blacks, but to the keen  ears of Tarzan of the Apes it bore its message.    His captors were leading him to a hut where he might be confined and  guarded against the coming of the nocturnal orgy that would mark his  torture-laden death.  He halted as he heard the notes of Tantor's call,  and raising his head, gave vent to a terrifying scream that sent cold  chills through the superstitious blacks and caused the warriors who  guarded him to leap back even though their prisoner's arms were  securely bound behind him.    With raised spears they encircled him as for a moment longer he stood  listening.  Faintly from the distance came another, an answering cry,  and Tarzan of the Apes, satisfied, turned and quietly pursued his way  toward the hut where he was to be imprisoned.    The afternoon wore on.  From the surrounding village the ape-man heard  the bustle of preparation for the feast.  Through the doorway of the  hut he saw the women laying the cooking fires and filling their earthen  caldrons with water; but above it all his ears were bent across the  jungle in eager listening for the coming of Tantor.    Even Tarzan but half believed that he would come.  He knew Tantor even  better than Tantor knew himself.  He knew the timid heart which lay in  the giant body.  He knew the panic of terror which the scent of the  Gomangani inspired within that savage breast, and as night drew on,  hope died within his heart and in the stoic calm of the wild beast  which he was, he resigned himself to meet the fate which awaited him.    All afternoon he had been working, working, working with the bonds that  held his wrists.  Very slowly they were giving.  He might free his  hands before they came to lead him out to be butchered, and if he  did--Tarzan licked his lips in anticipation, and smiled a cold, grim  smile.  He could imagine the feel of soft flesh beneath his fingers and  the sinking of his white teeth into the throats of his foemen.  He  would let them taste his wrath before they overpowered him!    At last they came--painted, befeathered warriors--even more hideous  than nature had intended them.  They came and pushed him into the open,  where his appearance was greeted by wild shouts from the assembled  villagers.    To the stake they led him, and as they pushed him roughly against it  preparatory to binding him there securely for the dance of death that  would presently encircle him, Tarzan tensed his mighty thews and with a  single, powerful wrench parted the loosened thongs which had secured  his hands.  Like thought, for quickness, he leaped forward among the  warriors nearest him.  A blow sent one to earth, as, growling and  snarling, the beast-man leaped upon the breast of another.  His fangs  were buried instantly in the jugular of his adversary and then a half  hundred black men had leaped upon him and borne him to earth.    Striking, clawing, and snapping, the ape-man fought--fought as his  foster people had taught him to fight--fought like a wild beast  cornered.  His strength, his agility, his courage, and his intelligence  rendered him easily a match for half a dozen black men in a  hand-to-hand struggle, but not even Tarzan of the Apes could hope to  successfully cope with half a hundred.    Slowly they were overpowering him, though a score of them bled from  ugly wounds, and two lay very still beneath the trampling feet, and the  rolling bodies of the contestants.    Overpower him they might, but could they keep him overpowered while  they bound him? A half hour of desperate endeavor convinced them that  they could not, and so Mbonga, who, like all good rulers, had circled  in the safety of the background, called to one to work his way in and  spear the victim.  Gradually, through the milling, battling men, the  warrior approached the object of his quest.    He stood with poised spear above his head waiting for the instant that  would expose a vulnerable part of the ape-man's body and still not  endanger one of the blacks.  Closer and closer he edged about,  following the movements of the twisting, scuffling combatants.  The  growls of the ape-man sent cold chills up the warrior's spine, causing  him to go carefully lest he miss at the first cast and lay himself open  to an attack from those merciless teeth and mighty hands.    At last he found an opening.  Higher he raised his spear, tensing his  muscles, rolling beneath his glistening, ebon hide, and then from the  jungle just beyond the palisade came a thunderous crashing.  The  spear-hand paused, the black cast a quick glance in the direction of  the disturbance, as did the others of the blacks who were not occupied  with the subjugation of the ape-man.    In the glare of the fires they saw a huge bulk topping the barrier.  They saw the palisade belly and sway inward.  They saw it burst as  though built of straws, and an instant later Tantor, the elephant,  thundered down upon them.    To right and left the blacks fled, screaming in terror.  Some who  hovered upon the verge of the strife with Tarzan heard and made good  their escape, but a half dozen there were so wrapt in the blood-madness  of battle that they failed to note the approach of the giant tusker.    Upon these Tantor charged, trumpeting furiously.  Above them he  stopped, his sensitive trunk weaving among them, and there, at the  bottom, he found Tarzan, bloody, but still battling.    A warrior turned his eyes upward from the melee.  Above him towered the  gigantic bulk of the pachyderm, the little eyes flashing with the  reflected light of the fires--wicked, frightful, terrifying.  The  warrior screamed, and as he screamed, the sinuous trunk encircled him,  lifted him high above the ground, and hurled him far after the fleeing  crowd.    Another and another Tantor wrenched from the body of the ape-man,  throwing them to right and to left, where they lay either moaning or  very quiet, as death came slowly or at once.    At a distance Mbonga rallied his warriors.  His greedy eyes had noted  the great ivory tusks of the bull.  The first panic of terror relieved,  he urged his men forward to attack with their heavy elephant spears;  but as they came, Tantor swung Tarzan to his broad head, and, wheeling,  lumbered off into the jungle through the great rent he had made in the  palisade.    Elephant hunters may be right when they aver that this animal would not  have rendered such service to a man, but to Tantor, Tarzan was not a  man--he was but a fellow jungle beast.    And so it was that Tantor, the elephant, discharged an obligation to  Tarzan of the Apes, cementing even more closely the friendship that had  existed between them since Tarzan as a little, brown boy rode upon  Tantor's huge back through the moonlit jungle beneath the equatorial  stars.                                     3                    The Fight for the Balu    TEEKA HAD BECOME a mother.  Tarzan of the Apes was intensely  interested, much more so, in fact, than Taug, the father.  Tarzan was  very fond of Teeka.  Even the cares of prospective motherhood had not  entirely quenched the fires of carefree youth, and Teeka had remained a  good-natured playmate even at an age when other shes of the tribe of  Kerchak had assumed the sullen dignity of maturity.  She yet retained  her childish delight in the primitive games of tag and hide-and-go-seek  which Tarzan's fertile man-mind had evolved.    To play tag through the tree tops is an exciting and inspiring pastime.  Tarzan delighted in it, but the bulls of his childhood had long since  abandoned such childish practices.  Teeka, though, had been keen for it  always until shortly before the baby came; but with the advent of her  first-born, even Teeka changed.    The evidence of the change surprised and hurt"]]]
