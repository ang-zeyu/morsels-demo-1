Hervey; the Chapel  on the Cliff, by W. Kennedy; all entitled to high praise. A Christian's  Day, by Miss A.M. Porter, is a sweet devotional composition. The extract  from one of Mr. Atherstone's unpublished books of the Fall of Nineveh,  maintains the high opinion already formed of the published part. Mr. C.  Swain has two beautiful pieces. We have only room to name those _gems_  of the poetry, viz. Wearie's Well, and another beautiful ballad, by W.  Motherwell; and some exquisite lines by the Rev. G. Croly; and to quote  the following:--      CHANGE.    BY L.E.L.      The wind is sweeping o'er the hill;    It hath a mournful sound,  As if it felt the difference    Its weary wing hath found.  A little while that wandering wind    Swept over leaf and flower;  For there was green for every tree,    And bloom for every hour.    It wandered through the pleasant wood,    And caught the dove's lone song;  And by the garden-beds, and bore    The rose's breath along.  But hoarse and sullenly it sweeps;    No rose is opening now--  No music, for the wood-dove's nest    Is vacant on the bough.    Oh, human heart and wandering wind,    Go look upon the past;  The likeness is the same with each--    Their summer did not last.  Each mourns above the things it loved--    One o'er a flower and leaf;  The other over hopes and joys,    Whose beauty was as brief.      We congratulate the editor and the public on the past success of the  _Amulet_, especially as it proves that a pious feeling co-exists with a  taste for refined amusement, and that advantageously. There is nothing  austere in any page of the _Amulet_, nor anything so frivolous and light  as to be objectionable; but it steers in the medium, and consequently  must be acceptable to every well-regulated mind. Indeed, many of the  pieces in the present volume may be read and re-read with increased  advantage; whilst two only are unequal to the names attached to them.           *       *       *       *       *      THE GEM.    _Edited by Thomas Hood, Esq._      The present is the first year of the _Gem_, which, as a work of art or  literature, fully comes within the import of its title. It is likewise  the first appearance of Mr. Hood as the editor of an \"annual,\" who, with  becoming diffidence, appears to rely on the \"literary giants\" of his  muster-roll, rather than on his individual talent. Notwithstanding such  an editorship must have resembled the perplexity of Sinbad in the Valley  of Diamonds, Mr. Hood's volume is almost unexceptionably good, whatever  he may have rejected; and one of the best, if not _the best_, article in  the whole work, has been contributed by the editor himself. Associated  as Mr. Hood's name is with \"whim and oddity,\" we, however, looked for  more quips, quirks, and quiddities than he has given us, which we should  have hailed as specially suited to the approaching festive season, and  from their contrast with the contents of similar works, as more likely  to attract by their novelty and humour.    The embellishments of the _Gem_, fifteen in number, have been selected  by A. Cooper, Esq. R.A. _The Death of Keeldar_ is a beautiful  composition by Mr. Cooper, and is worthy of association with Sir Walter  Scott's pathetic ballad. _The Widow_, by S. Davenport, from a picture by  R. Leslie, R.A. is one of the most touching prints we have yet seen, and  every one is capable of estimating its beauties, since its expression  will be sure to fasten on the affections of the beholder. _May Talbot_,  by J.C. Edwards, from a painting by A. Cooper, is admirable in design  and execution. Of the _Temptation on the Mount_, engraved by W.R. Smith,  after Martin, we have spoken in our accompanying Number; but as often as  we look at the plate, we discover new beauties. It is a just idea of  \"all the kingdoms of the earth;\" the distant effect is excellent, and  the \"exceeding high mountain\" is ably represented. The faces in the  _Painter's Study_ are decidedly superior to the rest of the print. The  _Fisherman's Daughter_, from a painting by Bone, is pleasing; and  _Venice, with the Embarkation of the Doge_, is a stirring scene of  pageantry and triumph.    Among the _poetry_ is the Painter's Song, a pleasing composition, by  Barry Cornwall, who has also The Victim, a dramatic sketch of twenty  pages. Stanzas by Horace Smith, Esq. are a pleasant satire upon the  little vanities of great people. We give the _Dream of Eugene Aram_ in  full, although it consists of nearly two pages of small type.:--           *       *       *       *       *      THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.    BY T. HOOD, ESQ.      [The late Admiral Burney went to school at an establishment where the  unhappy Eugene Aram was usher subsequent to his crime. The admiral  stated, that Aram was generally liked by the boys; and that he used to  discourse to them about _murder_ in somewhat of the spirit which is  attributed to him in this poem.]      'Twas in the prime of summer time,    An evening calm and cool,  And four-and-twenty happy boys    Came bounding out of school:  There were some that ran and some that leapt,    Like troutlets in a pool.    Away they sped with gamesome minds,    And souls untouch'd by sin:  To a level mead they came, and there    They drave the wickets in:  Pleasantly shone the setting sun    Over the town of Lynn.    Like sportive deer they coursed about,    And shouted as they ran,--  Turning to mirth all things of earth,    As only boyhood can;  But the Usher sat remote from all--    A melancholy man!    His hat was off, his vest apart,    To catch heaven's blessed breeze--  For a burning thought was in his brow,    And his bosom ill at ease:  So he lean'd his head on his hands, and read    The book between his knees!    Leaf after leaf he turn'd it o'er,    Nor ever glanc'd aside--  For the peace of his soul he read that book    In the golden eventide:  Much study had made him very lean,    And pale, and leaden-eyed.    At last, he shut the ponderous tome;    With a fast and fervent grasp  He strain'd the dusky covers close,    And fixed the brazen hasp;  \"O God, could I so close my mind,    And clasp it with a clasp!\"    Then leaping on his feet upright,    Some moody turns he took,--  Now up the mead, then down the mead,    And past a shady nook,--  And, lo! he saw a little boy    That pored upon a book!    \"My gentle lad, what is't you read--    Romance or fairy fable?  Or is it some historic page,    Of kings and crowns unstable?\"  The young boy gave an upward glance,--    \"It is _The Death of Abel_.\"    The Usher took six hasty strides,    As smit with sudden pain,--  Six hasty strides beyond the place,    Then slowly back again;  And down he sat beside the lad,    And talk'd with him of Cain;    And, long since then, of bloody men,    Whose deeds tradition saves;  Of lonely folk cut off unseen,    And hid in sudden graves;  Of horrid stabs, in groves forlorn,    And murders done in caves.    And how the sprites of injured men    Shriek upward from the sod,--  Ay, how the ghostly hand will point    To show the burial clod;  And unknown facts of guilty acts    Are seen in dreams from God!    He told how murderers walk the earth    Beneath the curse of Cain,--  With crimson clouds before their eyes,    And flames about their brain:  For blood has left upon their souls    Its everlasting stain!    \"And well,\" quoth he, \"I know, for truth,    Their pangs must be extreme,--  Wo, wo, unutterable wo,--    Who spill life's sacred stream!  For why? Methought, last night, I wrought    A murder in a dream!    \"One that had never done me wrong--    A feeble man, and old:  I led him to a lonely field,    The moon shone clear and cold:  Now here, said I, this man shall die,    And I will have his gold!    \"Two sudden blows with a ragged stick,    And one with a heavy stone,  One hurried gash with a hasty knife--    And then the deed was done:  There was nothing lying at my foot,    But lifeless flesh and bone!    \"Nothing but lifeless flesh and bone,    That could not do me ill;  And yet I fear'd him all the more,    For lying there so still:  There was a manhood in his look,    That murder could not kill!    \"And, lo! the universal air    Seem'd lit with ghastly flame,--  Ten thousand thousand dreadful eyes    Were looking down in blame:  I took the dead man by the hand,    And call'd upon his name!    \"Oh, God, it made me quake to see    Such sense within the slain!  But when I touch'd the lifeless clay,    The blood gush'd out amain!  For every clot, a burning spot,    Was scorching in my brain!    \"My head was like an ardent coal,    My heart as solid ice;  My wretched, wretched soul I knew    Was at the Devil's price:  A dozen times I groaned--the dead    Had never groan'd but twice!    \"And now from forth the frowning sky,    From the heaven's topmost height,  I heard a voice--the awful voice    Of the blood-avenging sprite:--  'Thou guilty man! take up thy dead,    And hide it from my sight!'    \"I took the dreary body up,    And cast it in a stream,--  A sluggish water, black as ink.    The depth was so extreme  My gentle boy, remember this    Is nothing but a dream!    \"Down went the corse with a hollow plunge,    And vanish'd in the pool--  Anon I cleansed my bloody hands    And wash'd my forehead cool,  And sat among the urchins young    That evening in the school!    \"Oh, heaven, to think of their white souls,    And mine so black and grim!  I could not share in childish prayer.    Nor join in evening hymn:  Like a devil of the pit I seem'd,    'Mid holy cherubim!    \"And peace went with them one and all,    And each calm pillow spread--  But Guilt was my grim chamberlain    That lighted me to bed,  And drew my midnight curtains round,    With fingers bloody red!    \"All night I lay in agony,    In anguish dark and deep--  My fever'd eyes I dared not close,    But stared aghast at Sleep;  For Sin had render'd unto"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11407"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 10, No. 284, (#7)"],[1,"ic. The religious  orders, the Capucins particularly, are in constant requisition; not a day  that you may not meet two or three of their detachments in various parts  of the city:---the religious or charitable fraternities, such as the  Fratelli della Misericordia, of which the deceased is generally a brother  or a benefactor, or both, think it also a point of duty and gratitude to  swell the _cortege_, and in the greatest numbers they can muster to attend.  Their costume, which is highly picturesque, is always a striking feature,  and adds much to the brilliancy of the display. They wear a sort of sack  robe or tunic, which covers the whole body, girt with a rope round the  waist, and with holes pierced in the _capuchon_ for the eyes; their large  grey slouched hat is thrown back, much in the manner in which it appears  on the statues of Mercury, on their shoulders; their feet are often in  zoccoli, or sandals of wood, and sometimes, though rarely, bare. The  colour of their dress varies according to the rule of their society; at  Rome, I have noticed white, blue, and grey: at Florence they prefer black.  The corpse is dressed up with great care, and often with a degree of luxury  which would become a wedding; the best linen, the richest ornaments, are  lavished; garlands are placed on the head; the hands crossed, with a  crucifix between them, on the bosom, and the face and feet left quite bare.  Sometimes, through a capricious fit of piety, all this is studiously  dispensed with, and the body appears clad in the habit of some religious  order, to which the deceased was especially addicted during life. In this  manner the procession begins to move after sunset, preceded by a tall  silver cross, beadles, &c.; friars, priests, &c. chanting the De Profundis  through the principal streets to the church where it is intended it should  be interred.    The effect, with some abatements for boys following to pick up the  drippings of the torches, and the perfect indifference of the assistants,  for neither friends nor relatives attend, is certainly very solemn. The  deep hoarse recitative of the psalm, the strange phantom-like appearance  of the fraternities, the flash and glare of the torches which they carry,  on the face of the dead; the dead body itself, in all the appalling  nakedness of mortality, but still mocked with the tawdry images of this  world, in the flowers and tinsel and gilding which surround it; the quick  swinging motion with which it is hurried along, and with which it comes  trenching, when one least expects it, on all the gaieties and busy  interests of existence (for at this hour the Corso and the Caffes are most  crowded)--all this, without any reference to the intrinsic solemnity of  such a scene, is calculated, as mere stage effect, powerfully to stir up  the sympathies and imagination of a stranger. On the inhabitants, as might  be apprehended, such pageants have long since lost all their influence;  and I have seen a line extending down a whole street, without deranging a  single lounger from his seat, or interrupting for an instant the pleasures  of ice-eating and punch-drinking, which generally takes place in the open  air. Whether this passion for bringing into coarse contact, as is often  the case, both life and death, the gloomy and the gay, be constitutional  or traditional, I know not; but a traveller can scarcely fail of being  struck with the prevalence of the feeling and practice amongst southern  nations at all periods of their history, and finding in the modern  inhabitants of those favoured regions, frequent resemblances to that  strange spirit of melancholy voluptuousness, which travelled onward from  Egypt to Greece, and from Greece, together with the other refinements of  her philosophy, into the greater part of Italy. On reaching the church,  unless the wealth and situation of the departed can permit the consolation  or the vanity of a high mass, the body is immediately committed to the  tomb. Such at least is the practice at Rome; and there are few who have  not witnessed with disgust the indecent haste of the few attendants by  whom this portion of the last rites is usually despatched. In the country,  and in smaller towns, the corpse is usually exposed for at least a day: I  know few exceptions, from Trent to Naples. It is generally an affecting  ceremony. One of the most touching instances of the kind I can remember,  was the exposure of a young girl, who had just died in the flush of beauty  in a small village in Tuscany. I was passing through at the time, and  stepped by chance into the church. The corpse was lying on a low bier  before the altar; a small lamp burnt above. Her two younger sisters were  kneeling at her side, and from time to time cast flowers upon her head.  Scarcely a peasant entered but immediately came up and touched the bier,  and, after kneeling for a few moments, rose and murmured a prayer or two  for the spiritual rest of the departed. All this was done very naturally,  and with a kindliness which spoke highly for the warmth and purity of their  affections. A similar custom still continues at Rome. The day after the  execution of the conspirator Targioni, who suffered in the late affair of  the Prince Spada, flowers and chaplets, notwithstanding every precaution  on the part of the police, were found scattered on his tomb. He has been  refused, for his contumacy in his last moments, Christian sepulture, and  was buried in a field outside the Porta del Popolo. It is remarkable that,  very nearly in the same place, the freedmen of Nero paid a similar tribute  of affection to the mortal remains of their master. Garlands and flowers,  the morning after his death, were also found upon _his_ tomb.    _New Monthly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      SLAVERY IN THE EAST.      The slave in eastern countries, after he is trained to serve, attains the  condition of a favoured domestic; his adoption of the religion of his  master is usually the first step which conciliates the latter. Except at  a few seaports, he is seldom put to hard labour. In Asia these are no  fields tilled by slaves, no manufactories in which they are doomed to  toil; their occupations are all of a domestic nature, and good behaviour  is rewarded by kindness and confidence, which raises them in the community  to which they belong. The term gholam, or slave, in Mahomedan countries,  is not one of opprobrium, nor does it even convey the idea of a degraded  condition. The Georgians, Nubians, and Abyssinians, and even the Seedee,  or Caffree, as the woolly-headed Africans are called, are usually married,  and their children, who are termed house-born, become, in a manner, part  of their master's family. They are deemed the most attached of his  adherents: they often inherit a considerable portion of his wealth; and  not unfrequently (with the exception of the woolly-headed Caffree) lose,  by a marriage in his family, or by some other equally respectable  connexion, all trace of their origin.    According to the Mahomedan law, the state of slavery is divided into two  conditions--the perfect and absolute, or imperfect and privileged. Those  who belong to the first class are, with all their property, at the disposal  of their masters. The second, though they cannot, before emancipation,  inherit or acquire property, have many privileges, and cannot be sold or  transferred. A female, who has a child to her master, belongs to the  privileged class; as does a slave, to whom his master has promised his  liberty, on the payment of a certain sum, or on his death.--_Sir J.  Malcolm's Sketches of Persia._           *       *       *       *       *          The Gatherer.        \"I am but a _Gatherer_ and disposer of other men's stuff.\"--_Wotton._      LEVEES.

The other day as Kenny was dining at a friend's house, after dinner wine  being introduced and Kenny partaking of it, was on the instant observed  to cough immoderately, when one of the company inquired if the cause was  not owing to a bit of cork getting into the glass; to which Kenny replied,  \"I should think it was Cork, for it went far to _Kill Kenny_.\"    P.K.R.           *       *       *       *       *      AUTHORS AND EDITORS.        \"Do you hear, let them be well used.\"      SHAKSPEARE.      Accustomed as our readers are to the quips, quirks, and quibbles, of the  _Gatherer_, we doubt whether the following loose reflections will not be  received as egotistical, or out of place. But we are induced to the hazard  by the recent appearance of \"The Tale of a Modern Genius,\" (stated to be  by Mr. Pennie,) and an interesting paper in the last _London Magazine_,  entitled \"Memoirs of a Young Peasant:\" in which productions the fates and  fortunes of genius are set forth with very powerful claims to the sympathy  of readers. Indeed, we recommend their perusal to many of our \"neglected\"  correspondents, in the hope of their becoming more reconciled to the  justice with which their contributions are rejected. In the comparison,  their works will be as \"the labours of idleness,\" listlessly penned under  first impressions, or, at best, with the fond anticipation of appearing in  print. Vexatious as the disappointment may appear, what is it compared with  the bare fate of genius, stripped of the bare means of sustenance by the  unsuccessful result of a literary engagement, or the non-completion of a  purchase, on which probably depended the very day's existence. The subject  is trite and hacknied; but all that has been written about the illusions  and misgivings of genius will not alter its complexion. It is true that  "]]]
