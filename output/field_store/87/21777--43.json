[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6653"],[0,"Voyages of Samuel De Champlain â€” Volume 01 (#6)"],[1,"-seven years, when it was first printed  at London in an English translation by the Hakluyt Society, in 1859. It is  an exceedingly interesting and valuable tract, containing a lucid  description of the peculiarities, manners, and customs of the people, the  soil, mountains, and rivers, the trees, fruits, and plants, the animals,  birds, and fishes, the rich mines found at different points, with frequent  allusions to the system of colonial management, together with the character  and sources of the vast wealth which these settlements were annually  yielding to the Spanish crown.    The reader of this little treatise will not fail to see the drift and  tendency of Champlain's mind and character unfolded on nearly every page.  His indomitable perseverance, his careful observation, his honest purpose  and amiable spirit are at all times apparent. Although a Frenchman, a  foreigner, and an entire stranger in the Spanish fleet, he had won the  confidence of the commander so completely, that he was allowed by special  permission to visit the City of Mexico, the Isthmus of Panama, and the  coast of South America, all of which were prominent and important centres  of interest, but nevertheless lying beyond the circuit made by the squadron  to which he was attached.    For the most part, Champlain's narrative of what he saw and of what he  learned from others is given in simple terms, without inference or comment.    His views are, however, clearly apparent in his description of the Spanish  method of converting the Indians by the Inquisition, reducing them to  slavery or the horrors of a cruel death, together with the retaliation  practised by their surviving comrades, resulting in a milder method. This  treatment of the poor savages by their more savage masters Champlain  illustrates by a graphic drawing, in which two stolid Spaniards are  guarding half a dozen poor wretches who are burning for their faith. In  another drawing he represents a miserable victim receiving, under the eye  and direction of the priest, the blows of an uplifted baton, as a penalty  for not attending church.    Champlain's forecast and fertility of mind may be clearly seen in his  suggestion that a ship-canal across the Isthmus of Panama would be a work  of great practical utility, saving, in the voyage to the Pacific side of  the Isthmus, a distance of more than fifteen hundred leagues. [23]    As it was the policy of Spain to withhold as much as possible all knowledge  of her colonial system and wealth in the West Indies, we may add, that  there is probably no work extant, on this subject, written at that period,  so full, impartial, and truthful as this tract by Champlain. It was  undoubtedly written out from notes and sketches made on the spot, and  probably occupied the early part of the two years that followed his return  from this expedition, during which period we are not aware that he entered  upon any other important enterprise. [24]    This tour among the Spanish colonies, and the description which Champlain  gave of them, information so much desired and yet so difficult to obtain,  appear to have made a strong and favorable impression upon the mind of  Henry IV., whose quick comprehension of the character of men was one of the  great qualities of this distinguished sovereign. He clearly saw that  Champlain's character was made up of those elements which are indispensable  in the servants of the executive will. He accordingly assigned him a  pension to enable him to reside near his person, and probably at the same  time honored him with a place within the charmed circle of the nobility.  [25]    While Champlain was residing at court, rejoicing doubtless in his new  honors and full of the marvels of his recent travels, he formed the  acquaintance, or perhaps renewed an old one, with Commander de Chastes,  [26] for many years governor of Dieppe, who had given a long life to the  service of his country, both by sea [27] and by land, and was a warm and  attached friend of Henry IV. The enthusiasm of the young voyager and the  long experience of the old commander made their interviews mutually  instructive and entertaining. De Chastes had observed and studied with  great interest the recent efforts at colonization on the coast of North  America. His zeal had been kindled and his ardor deepened doubtless by the  glowing recitals of his young friend. It was easy for him to believe that  France, as well as Spain, might gather in the golden fruits of  colonization. The territory claimed by France was farther to the north, in  climate and in sources of wealth widely different, and would require a  different management. He had determined, therefore, to send out an  expedition for the purpose of obtaining more definite information than he  already possessed, with the view to surrender subsequently his government  of Dieppe, take up his abode in the new world, and there dedicate his  remaining years to the service of God and his king. He accordingly obtained  a commission from the king, associating with himself some of the principal  merchants of Rouen and other cities, and made preparations for despatching  a pioneer fleet to reconnoitre and fix upon a proper place for settlement,  and to determine what equipment would be necessary for the convenience and  comfort of the colony. He secured the services of Pont Grave, [28] a  distinguished merchant and Canadian fur-trader, to conduct the expedition.  Having laid his views open fully to Champlain, he invited him also to join  the exploring party, as he desired the opinion and advice of so careful an  observer as to a proper plan of future operations.    No proposition could have been more agreeable to Champlain than this, and  he expressed himself quite ready for the enterprise, provided De Chastes  would secure the consent of the king, to whom he was under very great  obligations. De Chastes readily obtained the desired permission, coupled,  however, with an order from the king to Champlain to bring back to him a  faithful report of the voyage. Leaving Paris, Champlain hastened to  Honfleur, armed with a letter of instructions from M. de Gesures, the  secretary of the king, to Pont Grave, directing him to receive Champlain  and afford him every facility for seeing and exploring the country which  they were about to visit. They sailed for the shores of the New World on  the 15th of March, 1603.    The reader should here observe that anterior to this date no colonial  settlement had been made on the northern coasts of America. These regions  had, however, been frequented by European fishermen at a very early period,  certainly within the decade after its discovery by John Cabot in 1497. But  the Basques, Bretons, and Normans, [29] who visited these coasts, were  intent upon their employment, and consequently brought home only meagre  information of the country from whose shores they yearly bore away rich  cargoes of fish.    The first voyage made by the French for the purpose of discovery in our  northern waters of which we have any authentic record was by Jacques  Cartier in 1534, and another was made for the same purpose by this  distinguished navigator in 1535. In the former, he coasted along the shores  of Newfoundland, entered and gave its present name to the Bay of Chaleur,  and at Gaspe took formal possession of the country in the name of the king.  In the second, he ascended the St. Lawrence as far as Montreal, then an  Indian village known by the aborigines as Hochelaga, situated on an island  at the base of an eminence which they named _Mont-Royal_, from which the  present commercial metropolis of the Dominion derives its name. After a  winter of great suffering, which they passed on the St. Charles, near  Quebec, and the death of many of his company, Cartier returned to France  early in the summer of 1536. In 1541, he made a third voyage, under the  patronage of Francois de la Roque, Lord de Roberval, a nobleman of Picardy.  He sailed up the St. Lawrence, anchoring probably at the mouth of the river  Cap Rouge, about four leagues above Quebec, where he built a fort which he  named _Charlesbourg-Royal_. Here he passed another dreary and disheartening  winter, and returned to France in the spring of 1542. His patron, De  Roberval, who had failed to fulfil his intention to accompany him the  preceding year, met him at St. John, Newfoundland. In vain Roberval urged  and commanded him to retrace his course; but the resolute old navigator had  too recent an experience and saw too clearly the inevitable obstacles to  success in their undertaking to be diverted from his purpose. Roberval  proceeded up the Saint Lawrence, apparently to the fort just abandoned by  Cartier, which he repaired and occupied the next winter, naming it  _Roy-Francois_; [30] but the disasters which followed, the sickness and  death of many of his company, soon forced him, likewise, to abandon the  enterprise and return to France.    Of these voyages, Cartier, or rather his pilot-general, has left full and  elaborate reports, giving interesting and detailed accounts of the mode of  life among the aborigines, and of the character and products of the  country.    The entire want of success in all these attempts, and the absorbing and  wasting civil wars in France, paralyzed the zeal and put to rest all  aspirations for colonial adventure for more than half a century.    But in 1598, when peace again began to dawn upon the nation, the spirit of  colonization revived, and the Marquis de la Roche, a nobleman of Brittany,  obtained a royal commission with extraordinary and exclusive powers of  government and trade, identical with those granted to Roberval nearly sixty  years before. Having fitted out a vessel and placed on board forty convicts  gathered out of the prisons of France, he embarked for the northern coasts  of America. The first land he made was Sable Island, a most forlorn  sand-heap rising out of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6659"],[0,"History of King Charles the Second of England (#6)"],[1,"shut herself up in the place of her retreat. She was in a state  of great destitution, for Charles's circumstances were now so reduced  that he could afford her very little aid. She sent across the Channel  to her friends in France, asking them to help her. They sent immediately  the supplies that she needed--articles of clothing, a considerable sum  of money, and a nurse. She retained the clothing and the nurse, and  a little of the money; the rest she sent to Charles. She was, however,  now herself tolerably provided for in her new home, and here, a few  weeks afterward, her sixth child was born. It was a daughter.    The queen's long continued exertions and exposures had seriously  impaired her health, and she lay, feeble and low, in her sick chamber  for about ten days, when she learned to her dismay that one of the  Parliamentary generals was advancing at the head of his army to attack  the town which she had made her refuge. This general's name was Essex.  The queen sent a messenger out to meet Essex, asking him to allow her  to withdraw from the town before he should invest it with his armies.  She said that she was very weak and feeble, and unable to endure the  privations and alarms which the inhabitants of a besieged town have  necessarily to bear; and she asked his permission, therefore, to retire  to Bristol, till her health should be restored. Essex replied that he  could not give her permission to retire from Exeter; that, in fact,  the object of his coming there was to escort her to London, to bring  her before Parliament, to answer to the charge of treason.    The queen perceived immediately that nothing but the most prompt and  resolute action could enable her to escape the impending danger. She  had but little bodily strength remaining, but that little was stimulated  and renewed by the mental resolution and energy which, as is usual in  temperaments like hers, burned all the brighter in proportion to the  urgency of the danger which called it into action. She rose from her  sick bed, and began to concert measures for making her escape. She  confided her plan to three trusty friends, one gentleman, one lady,  and her confessor, who, as her spiritual teacher and guide, was her  constant companion. She disguised herself and these her attendants,  and succeeded in getting through the gates of Exeter without attracting  any observation. This was before Essex arrived. She found, however,  before she went far, that the van of the army was approaching, and she  had to seek refuge in a hut till her enemies had passed. She concealed  herself among some straw, her attendants seeking such other hiding  places as were at hand. It was two days before the bodies of soldiery  had all passed so as to make it safe for the queen to come out of her  retreat. The hut would seem to have been uninhabited, as the accounts  state that she remained all this time without food, though this seems  to be an almost incredible degree of privation and exposure for an  English queen. At any rate, she remained during all this time in a  state of great mental anxiety and alarm, for there were parties of  soldiery constantly going by, with a tumult and noise which kept her  in continual terror. Their harsh and dissonant voices, heard sometimes  in angry quarrels and sometimes in mirth, were always frightful. In  fact, for a helpless woman in a situation like that of the queen, the  mood of reckless and brutal mirth in such savages was perhaps more to  be dreaded than that of their anger.    At one time the queen overheard a party of these soldiers talking about  _her_. They knew that to get possession of the papist queen was the  object of their expedition. They spoke of getting her head and carrying  it to London, saying that Parliament had offered a reward of fifty  thousand crowns for it, and expressed the savage pleasure which it  would give them to secure this prize, by imprecations and oaths.    They did not, however, discover their intended victim. After the whole  army passed, the queen ventured cautiously forth from her retreat; the  little party got together again, and, still retaining their disguises,  moved on over the road by which the soldiers had come, and which was  in the shocking condition that a road and a country always exhibit  where an army has been marching. Faint and exhausted with sickness,  abstinence, and the effects of long continued anxiety and fear, the  queen had scarcely strength to go on. She persevered, however, and at  length found a second refuge in a cabin in a wood. She was going to  Plymouth, which is forty or fifty miles from Exeter, to the south-west,  and is the great port and naval station of the English, in that quarter  of the island.    She stopped at this cabin for a little time to rest, and to wait for  some other friends and members of her household from the palace in  Exeter to join her. Those friends were to wait until they found that  the queen succeeded in making her escape, and then they were to follow,  each in a different way, and all assuming such disguises as would most  effectually help to conceal them. There was one of the party whom it  must have been somewhat difficult to disguise. It was a dwarf, named  Geoffrey Hudson, who had been a long time in the service of Henrietta  as a personal attendant and messenger. It was the fancy of queens and  princesses in those days to have such personages in their train. The  oddity of the idea pleased them, and the smaller the dimensions of  such a servitor, the greater was his value. In modern times all this  is changed. Tall footmen now, in the families of the great, receive  salaries in proportion to the number of inches in their stature, and  the dwarfs go to the museums, to be exhibited, for a price, to the  common wonder of mankind.    The manner in which Sir Geoffrey Hudson was introduced into the service  of the queen was as odd as his figure. It was just after she was  married, and when she was about eighteen years old. She had two dwarfs  then already, a gentleman and a lady, or, as they termed it then, a  _cavalier_ and a _dame_, and, to carry out the whimsical idea, she had  arranged a match between these two, and had them married. Now there  was in her court at that time a wild and thoughtless nobleman, a great  friend and constant companion of her husband Charles the First, named  Buckingham. An account of his various exploits is given in our history  of Charles the First. Buckingham happened to hear of this Geoffrey  Hudson, who was then a boy of seven or eight years of age, living with  his parents somewhere in the interior of England. He sent for him, and  had him brought secretly to his house, and made an arrangement to have  him enter the service of the queen, without, however, saying any thing  of his design to her. He then invited the queen and her husband to  visit him at his palace; and when the time for luncheon arrived, one  day, he conducted the party into the dining saloon to partake of some  refreshment. There was upon the table, among other viands, what appeared  to be a large venison pie. The company gathered around the table, and  a servant proceeded to cut the pie, and on his breaking and raising  a piece of the crust, out stepped the young dwarf upon the table,  splendidly dressed and armed, and, advancing toward the queen, he  kneeled before her, and begged to be received into her train. Her  majesty was very much pleased with the addition itself thus made to  her household, as well as diverted by the odd manner in which her new  attendant was introduced into her service.    The youthful dwarf was then only eighteen inches high, and he continued  so until he was thirty years of age, when, to every body's surprise,  he began to grow. He grew quite rapidly, and, for a time, there was  a prospect that he would be entirely spoiled, as his whole value had  consisted thus far in his littleness. He attained the height of three  feet and a half, and there the mysterious principle of organic  expansion, the most mysterious and inexplicable, perhaps, that is  exhibited in all the phenomena of life, seemed to be finally exhausted,  and, though he lived to be nearly seventy years of age, he grew no  more.    Notwithstanding the bodily infirmity, whatever it may have been, which  prevented his growth, the dwarf possessed a considerable degree of  mental capacity and courage. He did not bear, however, very good-  naturedly, the jests and gibes of which he was the continual object,  from the unfeeling courtiers, who often took pleasure in teasing him  and in getting him into all sorts of absurd and ridiculous situations.  At last his patience was entirely exhausted, and he challenged one of  his tormentors, whose name was Crofts, to a duel. Crofts accepted the  challenge, and, being determined to persevere in his fun to the end,  appeared on the battle ground armed only with a squirt. This raised  a laugh, of course, but it did not tend much to cool the injured  Lilliputian's anger. He sternly insisted on another meeting, and with  real weapons. Crofts had expected to have turned off the whole affair  in a joke, but he found this could not be done; and public opinion  among the courtiers around him compelled him finally to accept the  challenge in earnest. The parties met on horseback, to put them more  nearly on an equality. They fought with pistols. Crofts was killed  upon the spot.    After this Hudson was treated with more respect. He was entrusted by  the queen with many commissions, and sometimes business was committed  to him which required no little capacity, judgment, and courage. He  was now, at the time of the queen's escape from Exeter, of his full  stature, but as this was only three and a half feet, he encountered  great danger in attempting to find his way out of the city and through  the advancing columns of the army to rejoin the queen. He persevered,  however, and reached her safely at"]]]
