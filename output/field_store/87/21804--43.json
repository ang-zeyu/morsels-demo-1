By  the time he was dressed, however, he was thinking of something quite  different, for he did not value the enmity of the goblins in the least.  As soon as they had had breakfast, he set off with his father for the  mine.    They entered the hill by a natural opening under a huge rock, where a  little stream rushed out.  They followed its course for a few yards,  when the passage took a turn, and sloped steeply into the heart of the  hill.  With many angles and windings and branchings-off, and sometimes  with steps where it came upon a natural gulf, it led them deep into the  hill before they arrived at the place where they were at present  digging out the precious ore. This was of various kinds, for the  mountain was very rich in the better sorts of metals.  With flint and  steel, and tinder-box, they lighted their lamps, then fixed them on  their heads, and were soon hard at work with their pickaxes and shovels  and hammers.  Father and son were at work near each other, but not in  the same gang--the passages out of which the ore was dug, they called  gangs--for when the lode, or vein of ore, was small, one miner would  have to dig away alone in a passage no bigger than gave him just room  to work--sometimes in uncomfortable cramped positions.  If they stopped  for a moment they could hear everywhere around them, some nearer, some  farther off, the sounds of their companions burrowing away in all  directions in the inside of the great mountain--some boring holes in  the rock in order to blow it up with gunpowder, others shovelling the  broken ore into baskets to be carried to the mouth of the mine, others  hitting away with their pickaxes. Sometimes, if the miner was in a very  lonely part, he would hear only a tap-tapping, no louder than that of a  woodpecker, for the sound would come from a great distance off through  the solid mountain rock.    The work was hard at best, for it is very warm underground; but it was  not particularly unpleasant, and some of the miners, when they wanted  to earn a little more money for a particular purpose, would stop behind  the rest and work all night.  But you could not tell night from day  down there, except from feeling tired and sleepy; for no light of the  sun ever came into those gloomy regions.  Some who had thus remained  behind during the night, although certain there were none of their  companions at work, would declare the next morning that they heard,  every time they halted for a moment to take breath, a tap-tapping all  about them, as if the mountain were then more full of miners than ever  it was during the day; and some in consequence would never stay  overnight, for all knew those were the sounds of the goblins.  They  worked only at night, for the miners' night was the goblins' day.  Indeed, the greater number of the miners were afraid of the goblins;  for there were strange stories well known amongst them of the treatment  some had received whom the goblins had surprised at their work during  the night.  The more courageous of them, however, amongst them Peter  Peterson and Curdie, who in this took after his father, had stayed in  the mine all night again and again, and although they had several times  encountered a few stray goblins, had never yet failed in driving them  away.  As I have indicated already, the chief defence against them was  verse, for they hated verse of every kind, and some kinds they could  not endure at all.  I suspect they could not make any themselves, and  that was why they disliked it so much.  At all events, those who were  most afraid of them were those who could neither make verses themselves  nor remember the verses that other people made for them; while those  who were never afraid were those who could make verses for themselves;  for although there were certain old rhymes which were very effectual,  yet it was well known that a new rhyme, if of the right sort, was even  more distasteful to them, and therefore more effectual in putting them  to flight.    Perhaps my readers may be wondering what the goblins could be about,  working all night long, seeing they never carried up the ore and sold  it; but when I have informed them concerning what Curdie learned the  very next night, they will be able to understand.    For Curdie had determined, if his father would permit him, to remain  there alone this night--and that for two reasons: first, he wanted to  get extra wages that he might buy a very warm red petticoat for his  mother, who had begun to complain of the cold of the mountain air  sooner than usual this autumn; and second, he had just a faint hope of  finding out what the goblins were about under his window the night  before.    When he told his father, he made no objection, for he had great  confidence in his boy's courage and resources.    'I'm sorry I can't stay with you,' said Peter; 'but I want to go and  pay the parson a visit this evening, and besides I've had a bit of a  headache all day.'    'I'm sorry for that, father,' said Curdie.    'Oh, it's not much.  You'll be sure to take care of yourself, won't  you?'    'Yes, father; I will.  I'll keep a sharp look-out, I promise you.'  Curdie was the only one who remained in the mine.  About six o'clock  the rest went away, everyone bidding him good night, and telling him to  take care of himself; for he was a great favourite with them all.    'Don't forget your rhymes,' said one.    'No, no,'answered Curdie.    'It's no matter if he does,' said another, 'for he'll only have to make  a new one.'    'Yes: but he mightn't be able to make it fast enough,' said another;  'and while it was cooking in his head, they might take a mean advantage  and set upon him.'    'I'll do my best,' said Curdie.  'I'm not afraid.' 'We all know that,'  they returned, and left him.        CHAPTER 8    The Goblins    For some time Curdie worked away briskly, throwing all the ore he had  disengaged on one side behind him, to be ready for carrying out in the  morning.  He heard a good deal of goblin-tapping, but it all sounded  far away in the hill, and he paid it little heed.  Towards midnight he  began to feel rather hungry; so he dropped his pickaxe, got out a lump  of bread which in the morning he had laid in a damp hole in the rock,  sat down on a heap of ore, and ate his supper. Then he leaned back for  five minutes' rest before beginning his work again, and laid his head  against the rock.  He had not kept the position for one minute before  he heard something which made him sharpen his ears.  It sounded like a  voice inside the rock. After a while he heard it again.  It was a  goblin voice--there could be no doubt about that--and this time he  could make out the words.    'Hadn't we better be moving?'it said.    A rougher and deeper voice replied:    'There's no hurry.  That wretched little mole won't be through tonight,  if he work ever so hard.  He's not by any means at the thinnest place.'    'But you still think the lode does come through into our house?' said  the first voice.    'Yes, but a good bit farther on than he has got to yet.  If he had  struck a stroke more to the side just here,' said the goblin, tapping  the very stone, as it seemed to Curdie, against which his head lay, 'he  would have been through; but he's a couple of yards past it now, and if  he follow the lode it will be a week before it leads him in.  You see  it back there--a long way.  Still, perhaps, in case of accident it  would be as well to be getting out of this. Helfer, you'll take the  great chest.  That's your business, you know.'    'Yes, dad,' said a third voice.  'But you must help me to get it on my  back.  It's awfully heavy, you know.'    'Well, it isn't just a bag of smoke, I admit.  But you're as strong as  a mountain, Helfer.'    'You say so, dad.  I think myself I'm all right.  But I could carry ten  times as much if it wasn't for my feet.'    'That is your weak point, I confess, my boy.' 'Ain't it yours too,  father?'    'Well, to be honest, it's a goblin weakness.  Why they come so soft, I  declare I haven't an idea.'    'Specially when your head's so hard, you know, father.'    'Yes my boy.  The goblin's glory is his head.  To think how the fellows  up above there have to put on helmets and things when they go fighting!  Ha! ha!'    'But why don't we wear shoes like them, father?  I should like  it--especially when I've got a chest like that on my head.'    'Well, you see, it's not the fashion.  The king never wears shoes.'    'The queen does.'    'Yes; but that's for distinction.  The first queen, you see--I mean the  king's first wife--wore shoes, of course, because she came from  upstairs; and so, when she died, the next queen would not be inferior  to her as she called it, and would wear shoes too.  It was all pride.  She is the hardest in forbidding them to the rest of the women.'    'I'm sure I wouldn't wear them--no, not for--that I wouldn't!' said the  first voice, which was evidently that of the mother of the family.  'I  can't think why either of them should.'    'Didn't I tell you the first was from upstairs?' said the other. 'That  was the only silly thing I ever knew His Majesty guilty of. Why should  he marry an outlandish woman like that-one of our natural enemies too?'    'I suppose he fell in love with her.' 'Pooh! pooh!  He's just as happy  now with one of his own people.'    'Did she die very soon?  They didn't tease her to death, did they?'    'Oh, dear, no!  The king worshipped her very footmarks.'    'What made her die, then?  Didn't the air agree with her?'    'She died when the young prince was born.'    'How silly of her!  We never do that.  It must have been because she  wore shoes.'    'I don't know that.'    'Why do they wear shoes up there?'    'Ah, now that's a sensible question, and I will answer it.  But in  order to do so, I must first tell you a secret.

They did not give us  any trouble, and I felt sorry for their lonely life, and the pounds of  mud they had to carry with them everywhere.    Such mud! There is no wharf or planking of any kind, and all freight and  baggage is landed on (or into) the muddy bank. Barrels rolled through it  became unrecognizable, and were doubled in weight before they reached  their warehouse. Men worked on bare feet, with trousers rolled to their  knees, and the slippery, swashy look of everything was horrible. An  Indian (not of the Fenimore Cooper type) leant against an old  cooking-stove stranded on the bank, and an old squaw squatted on a heap  of dirty straw, watching with lack-lustre eyes the disembarkation. A mile  or two above Pembina is the American fort, with its trim barracks,  fortifications, mounted guns, sentries, and some military life about it.  Near it is the house built by Captain Cameron, when out with the  expeditionary force in 1867. The remainder of our journey up the Red  River of the North was uninteresting, and we hailed with delight our  arrival at Winnipeg, on Saturday morning, the 4th of June.    It took some time to disembark from the _Minnesota_. The emigrants  had been up at daylight, and after making haste to get their property  together, found that they had to wait the arrival of the custom-house  officer. At about eight o'clock, a waggon being procured to take our  luggage, we, carrying our travelling-bags and shawls, walked--for there  were no cabs nor omnibuses--into Winnipeg.    The _Minnesota_ had stopped at the old custom-house wharf, the bulk  of her freight being for that end of the town, and we had to traverse the  entire length of Winnipeg to reach Mrs. T----, who had kindly invited us  to remain with her until Mrs. C---- could find a suitable house. Up  narrow, rickety planks, through mud and mire, past two log-houses fast  falling into ruin--which were pointed out as having been the only houses  in Winnipeg, besides the Fort Garry settlement, ten years before, and  within three years used as custom-houses--we made our way to the broad  main street. This is lined on each side by large, handsome shops, one or  two banks, the new post-office in course of erection, and the large  square town-hall, also unfinished. Then follow the new custom-house, land  office, Canada Pacific Railway offices (square white brick buildings),  and the round turret-like bastions of Fort Garry, [Footnote: Fort Garry  stands at the confluence of the Assineboine with the Red River.] with its  massive wooden palisades, and low log buildings at the extreme end of the  street, where it terminates at the mouth of the Assineboine. We had to  cross a few yards of prairie in order to reach Mrs. T----'s house,  formerly the officers' quarters of the mounted police force, now removed  to Battleford and Fort McLeod. We were received very cordially, a welcome  being extended to me, although a total stranger.    The first thing that struck me in Winnipeg was the mud. I had heard that  Red River mud was the worst in the world, and I now for the first time  realized how bad mud could be. Not only was the roadway so soft that  every turn of a wheel loaded it inches deep with the sticky compound, and  made it so heavy that the driver had frequently to stop and clear his  wheels with a stick, but, trodden from the crossings into the side-walks,  it covered them with a slimy mixture very difficult to walk on. From the  windows I could see people slipping and sliding about so much, that any  one ignorant of the cause might, have attributed their unsteadiness to  the strength of their morning libations; the absence of women from the  streets making that solution appear possible, if not probable.    On Sunday we went to Holy Trinity Church, a pretty little frame building  with a full congregation. Part of the church was occupied by the regiment  of artillery quartered in Fort Osborne, a neat little barracks to the  west of the prairie. The choir was passable, and could boast of one  thoroughly good tenor. An energetic clergyman preached an excellent  sermon.    Towards the end of June, Mr. C---- and his party left for the line; and  we, having taken the house vacated by the T----s the week before, were  busy getting comfortably settled. Numbers of people called; many of them  old friends whom we had lost sight of for years; and every one was so  cordial and friendly, that we anticipated great pleasure during our stay  in Winnipeg.    It is a strange place, peopled with a strange variety from all quarters  of the globe. Tall Indians stand in groups at the street corners, wrapped  in long dirty-white, dark-blue, or scarlet blankets, held well about  their shoulders, and hanging below their knees. They wear beaded or  embroidered cloth leggings, blue, scarlet, or black, tied with gay  ribbons. Their feet are in mocassins, their long black hair is braided  with beads or ribbons, and a black silk handkerchief, in which either  feathers or a bunch of ribbons are fastened, is folded and knotted round  their foreheads. Young squaws with shaggy, flowing hair, short, coloured  merino skirts, and shawls over their heads, sit on the side-walks,  chattering in their guttural tongue, and laughing over some joke; fat,  glossy, half-breed ponies, in gorgeously beaded saddle-cloths, stand at  the edge of the road awaiting their masters--short, lithe, dark men, who  seem to touch the reins, vault into the saddle, and reach the end of the  street in the same instant. The speed and strength of these small horses  is wonderful; their glossy coats and well-kept manes testify to the care  taken of them. An Indian never beats his horse, nor drags at the reins in  the cruel way so common among more \"civilized\" riders, but sits his horse  as though it were part of himself. A long train of ox-carts is waiting to  be loaded for the distant prairie hamlets. The half-breed driver stands  by in trousers and checked shirt, a loosely knotted handkerchief about  his neck. He sometimes wears a hat, but oftener his short, shaggy black  hair is his only head-covering. His squaw sits in the bottom of the  waggon; his little brown papooses are peeping out from between the bars  at the side. Other children, laced up in queer, birch-bark cradles or  moss bags, leaving only their arms free, and the upper part of their  bodies visible, lean against shop-doors or scattered bales of goods.    I watched some Indians shopping, and was astonished to see how invariably  they waived aside inferior goods and chose such materials as merinos at a  dollar and a half to two dollars (7s. 6d. to 10s.) a yard. One of the  merchants told me it was useless to offer them anything but the best. An  Indian who could not speak English or French, and wanted five things,  divided his money according to his idea of their relative cost in little  piles on the counter, and going through a pantomime descriptive of his  wants, was handed first some silk handkerchiefs. Taking one up, he felt it,  held it up to the light, and throwing it aside, shook his head vigorously,  uttering an \"Ugh!\" of disgust. When shown a better one he was doubtful, but  upon a much superior article being produced he took it, and willingly  handed over one pile for it. This, however, was too much, and when given  the change, he put it on one of the other piles, and proceeded in the same  way to make the rest of his purchases.    \"How easily they could be cheated!\" I said to the clerk after the Indian  had left.    \"No,\" he replied, \"not so easily as would appear. They generally come in  from their camps in great numbers about once a year to sell their furs  and make purchases. They go to different shops, and on their return  compare notes as to the quality and cost of their goods. Then, if one has  paid more than another, or has been cheated in quality, he will never  enter the shop again, and the firm that gives the greatest bargains is  most patronized on their return.\"    A few minutes afterwards another Indian came to buy a blanket, and was  told to go upstairs where they were kept. Slowly and doubtfully he  ascended, feeling his way step by step, and holding closely to the  banisters till he reached the top; then he turned to look back and  express his astonishment in the \"Ugh!\" which, in different accents, means  so many different things.    The Mennonites and Icelanders interested me very much. The former, who  are all thrifty and energetic, make excellent settlers. They have a large  settlement some twenty miles south-east of Winnipeg. The dress of the  women is quaint, yet neat. They wear short, full skirts, just showing  their small feet; jackets, and becoming white caps, from under which  their round black eyes, small straight features, and intelligent  expression, greet one pleasantly. The men are taller, with a quiet,  unconscious air of superiority which is refreshing. The dress of the  Icelanders is somewhat similar, but they are more lethargic-looking. They  have bright \"milk and roses\" complexions, great opaque blue eyes, and a  heavy gait that gives them an appearance of stupidity, which is not a  true index of their character; they learn English rapidly, and are  teachable servants, neat, clean, and careful, but have not constitutional  strength to endure hard work, and when separated from their friends  become lonely and dispirited. There is a large settlement of them at  Gimli, about sixty miles from Winnipeg, on Lake Winnipeg. Some of the  authorities in Winnipeg told me that, as an emigration speculation, they  were not a success. The grasshopper plague which visited Manitoba during  two consecutive seasons destroyed their crops, and the ravages of  smallpox during the fall of '76 and spring of '77 told upon them so  severely that they have so far only been an expense to the Canadian  Government.    The Hudson Bay Company's store had a great"]]]
