After all I  expect to find that the difficulties are nearly all on the surface.  These fellows both drink like the devil, and that should simplify  matters considerably.  But we shall see, and we must take our time.  There will probably turn out to be a dozen different ways in which the  thing might be done, and we shall have to choose between them.  It will  mean watching the house for at least a week in any case; it may mean  lots of other things that will take much longer; but give me a week and  I will tell you more.  That's to say, if you're really on?\"    \"Of course I am,\" I replied indignantly.  \"But why should I give you a  week?  Why shouldn't we watch the house together?\"    \"Because two eyes are as good as four and take up less room.  Never  hunt in couples unless you're obliged.  But don't you look offended,  Bunny; there'll be plenty for you to do when the time comes, that I  promise you.  You shall have your share of the fun, never fear, and a  purple diamond all to yourself--if we're lucky.\"    On the whole, however, this conversation left me less than lukewarm,  and I still remember the depression which came upon me when Raffles was  gone.  I saw the folly of the enterprise to which I had committed  myself--the sheer, gratuitous, unnecessary folly of it.  And the  paradoxes in which Raffles revelled, and the frivolous casuistry which  was nevertheless half sincere, and which his mere personality rendered  wholly plausible at the moment of utterance, appealed very little to me  when recalled in cold blood.  I admired the spirit of pure mischief in  which he seemed prepared to risk his liberty and his life, but I did  not find it an infectious spirit on calm reflection.  Yet the thought  of withdrawal was not to be entertained for a moment.  On the contrary,  I was impatient of the delay ordained by Raffles; and, perhaps, no  small part of my secret disaffection came of his galling determination  to do without me until the last moment.    It made it no better that this was characteristic of the man and of his  attitude towards me.  For a month we had been, I suppose, the thickest  thieves in all London, and yet our intimacy was curiously incomplete.  With all his charming frankness, there was in Raffles a vein of  capricious reserve which was perceptible enough to be very irritating.  He had the instinctive secretiveness of the inveterate criminal.  He  would make mysteries of matters of common concern; for example, I never  knew how or where he disposed of the Bond Street jewels, on the  proceeds of which we were both still leading the outward lives of  hundreds of other young fellows about town.  He was consistently  mysterious about that and other details, of which it seemed to me that  I had already earned the right to know everything.  I could not but  remember how he had led me into my first felony, by means of a trick,  while yet uncertain whether he could trust me or not.    That I could no longer afford to resent, but I did resent his want of  confidence in me now.  I said nothing about it, but it rankled every  day, and never more than in the week that succeeded the Rosenthall  dinner.  When I met Raffles at the club he would tell me nothing; when  I went to his rooms he was out, or pretended to be.    One day he told me he was getting on well, but slowly; it was a more  ticklish game than he had thought; but when I began to ask questions he  would say no more.  Then and there, in my annoyance, I took my own  decision.  Since he would tell me nothing of the result of his vigils,  I determined to keep one on my own account, and that very evening found  my way to the millionaire's front gates.    The house he was occupying is, I believe, quite the largest in the St.  John's Wood district.  It stands in the angle formed by two broad  thoroughfares, neither of which, as it happens, is a 'bus route, and I  doubt if many quieter spots exist within the four-mile radius.  Quiet  also was the great square house, in its garden of grass-plots and  shrubs; the lights were low, the millionaire and his friends obviously  spending their evening elsewhere.  The garden walls were only a few  feet high.  In one there was a side door opening into a glass passage;  in the other two five-barred, grained-and-varnished gates, one at  either end of the little semi-circular drive, and both wide open. So  still was the place that I had a great mind to walk boldly in and learn  something of the premises; in fact, I was on the point of doing so,  when I heard a quick, shuffling step on the pavement behind me.  I  turned round and faced the dark scowl and the dirty clenched fists of a  dilapidated tramp.    \"You fool!\" said he.  \"You utter idiot!\"    \"Raffles!\"    \"That's it,\" he whispered savagely; \"tell all the neighborhood--give me  away at the top of your voice!\"    With that he turned his back upon me, and shambled down the road,  shrugging his shoulders and muttering to himself as though I had  refused him alms.  A few moments I stood astounded, indignant, at a  loss; then I followed him.  His feet trailed, his knees gave, his back  was bowed, his head kept nodding; it was the gait of a man eighty years  of age.  Presently he waited for me midway between two lamp-posts.  As  I came up he was lighting rank tobacco, in a cutty pipe, with an  evil-smelling match, and the flame showed me the suspicion of a smile.    \"You must forgive my heat, Bunny, but it really was very foolish of  you.  Here am I trying every dodge--begging at the door one  night--hiding in the shrubs the next--doing every mortal thing but  stand and stare at the house as you went and did. It's a costume piece,  and in you rush in your ordinary clothes.  I tell you they're on the  lookout for us night and day.  It's the toughest nut I ever tackled!\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"if you had told me so before I shouldn't have come.  You told me nothing.\"    He looked hard at me from under the broken brim of a battered billycock.    \"You're right,\" he said at length.  \"I've been too close.  It's become  second nature with me when I've anything on.  But here's an end of it,  Bunny, so far as you're concerned.  I'm going home now, and I want you  to follow me; but for heaven's sake keep your distance, and don't speak  to me again till I speak to you.  There--give me a start.\"  And he was  off again, a decrepit vagabond, with his hands in his pockets, his  elbows squared, and frayed coat-tails swinging raggedly from side to  side.    I followed him to the Finchley Road.  There he took an Atlas omnibus,  and I sat some rows behind him on the top, but not far enough to escape  the pest of his vile tobacco.  That he could carry his character-sketch  to such a pitch--he who would only smoke one brand of cigarette!  It  was the last, least touch of the insatiable artist, and it charmed away  what mortification there still remained in me. Once more I felt the  fascination of a comrade who was forever dazzling one with a fresh and  unsuspected facet of his character.    As we neared Piccadilly I wondered what he would do.  Surely he was not  going into the Albany like that?  No, he took another omnibus to Sloane  Street, I sitting behind him as before.  At Sloane Street we changed  again, and were presently in the long lean artery of the King's Road.  I was now all agog to know our destination, nor was I kept many more  minutes in doubt.  Raffles got down.  I followed.  He crossed the road  and disappeared up a dark turning.  I pressed after him, and was in  time to see his coat-tails as he plunged into a still darker flagged  alley to the right.  He was holding himself up and stepping out like a  young man once more; also, in some subtle way, he already looked less  disreputable.  But I alone was there to see him, the alley was  absolutely deserted, and desperately dark.  At the further end he  opened a door with a latch-key, and it was darker yet within.    Instinctively I drew back and heard him chuckle. We could no longer see  each other.    \"All right, Bunny!  There's no hanky-panky this time.  These are  studios, my friend, and I'm one of the lawful tenants.\"    Indeed, in another minute we were in a lofty room with skylight,  easels, dressing-cupboard, platform, and every other adjunct save the  signs of actual labor.  The first thing I saw, as Raffles lit the gas,  was its reflection in his silk hat on the pegs beside the rest of his  normal garments.    \"Looking for the works of art?\" continued Raffles, lighting a cigarette  and beginning to divest himself of his rags.  \"I'm afraid you won't  find any, but there's the canvas I'm always going to make a start upon.  I tell them I'm looking high and low for my ideal model.  I have the  stove lit on principle twice a week, and look in and leave a newspaper  and a smell of Sullivans--how good they are after shag!  Meanwhile I  pay my rent and am a good tenant in every way; and it's a very useful  little pied-Ã -terre--there's no saying how useful it might be at a  pinch.  As it is, the billy-cock comes in and the topper goes out, and  nobody takes the slightest notice of either; at this time of night the  chances are that there's not a soul in the building except ourselves.\"    \"You never told me you went in for disguises,\" said I, watching him as  he cleansed the grime from his face and hands.    \"No, Bunny, I've treated you very shabbily all round.  There was really  no reason why I shouldn't have shown you this place a month ago, and  yet there was no point in my doing so, and circumstances are just  conceivable in which it would have suited us both for you to be in  genuine ignorance of my whereabouts.  I have something to sleep on, as  you perceive, in case of need, and, of course, my name is not Raffles  in the King's Road.  So you will see that one might bolt further and  fare worse.\"    \"Meanwhile you use the place as a dressing-room"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7060"],[0,"At Agincourt (#6)"],[1," fray, but merely because it offers  them an opportunity for pillaging and plundering, and for paying off old  scores against neighbours. Guy, bid John Harpen come hither.\"    When the esquire entered, Sir Eustace went on:    \"Take two men-at-arms, John, and ride round to all the tenants. Warn them  that there are plundering bands about, and that either the Burgundians or  the Orleanists may swoop down upon us any day. Tell them that they had  better send in here all their valuables, and at any rate the best of their  cattle and horses, and to have everything prepared for bringing in their  wives and families and the rest of their herds at a moment's notice. You  can say that if they like they can at once send their wives and families  in, with such store of grain and forage as they can transport; the more  the better. If the plunderers come, so much the more is saved from  destruction; if we are besieged, so much the more food have we here. Those  who do not send in their families would do well to keep a cart with two  strong horses ready day and night, so that no time would be lost when they  get the signal. We shall fire a gun, hoist the flag, and light a bonfire  on the keep, so that they may see the smoke by day or the fire by night.  Tell Jean Bouvard to come to me.\"    \"There is trouble afoot, Jean, and at any moment we may be attacked. Place  two men-at-arms on each of the roads to St. Omer, St. Pol, and Bethune.  Post them yourself at the highest points you can find near our boundary.  By each have a pile of faggots, well smeared with pitch, and have another  pile ready on the keep, and a watch always stationed there. He is to light  it at once when he sees smoke or fire from either of the three points. Let  the men at the outposts be relieved every four hours. They must, of  course, be mounted. Let one of the two remain by the faggots, and let the  other ride three or four miles in advance, and so post himself as to see a  long distance down the road.    \"If he sees a force advancing he must gallop back at full speed to his  comrade, and light the fire. Have a gun always loaded on the keep, and  have a brazier burning hard by, with an iron in it, so that the piece may  be fired the instant smoke is seen. It might be two or three minutes  before the beacon would give out smoke enough to be noticed, and every  minute may be of the greatest importance to the vassals. As soon as you  return from setting the posts see that everything is in readiness here. I  myself will make sure that the drawbridge works easily and the portcullis  runs freely in its groove. I have already sent off John Harpen to warn the  tenants, and doubtless many of them will be in this afternoon. Send Pierre  with four men, and tell them to drive up a number of the cattle from the  marshes. They need not trouble to hunt them all up today. Let them bring  the principal herd, the others we will fetch in to-morrow, or let them  range where they are until we have further news.\"    In a few minutes the castle resounded with the din of preparations under  the superintendence of Sir Eustace. The men-at-arms and archers carried up  stones from the great pile that had been collected in the court-yard in  readiness, to the various points on the walls that would be most exposed  to assault. Others were employed in fixing barricades in the court-yard at  the rear for the reception of the herd of half-wild cattle. The water was  turned from the little rivulet running down to the Somme into the moat.  Two or three bullocks were killed to furnish food for the fugitives who  might come in, and straw was laid down thickly in the sheds that would be  occupied by them. Machines for casting heavy stones were taken from the  storehouse and carried up to the walls, and set up there. Large stone  troughs placed in the court-yard were filled with water, and before  nightfall everything was in readiness.    As Sir Eustace had anticipated, most of the vassals whose farms lay at a  distance from the castle came in with their wives and families in the  course of the afternoon, bringing carts laden with their household goods,  and a considerable number of horses and cattle. Lady Margaret herself saw  that they were established as comfortably as possible in the sheds, which  were large enough to contain all the women and children on the estate. As  for the men, no such provision was necessary, as at this time of the year  they could sleep in the open air. Guy was busy all day seeing that the  orders of his lord were carried out, and especially watching the  operations of putting the ballistas and catapults together on the walls.  Cannon, though now in use, had by no means superseded these machines, for  they were cumbrous and clumsy, and could only be fired at considerable  intervals, and their aim was by no means accurate or their range  extensive, as the charge of powder that could be used in them was  comparatively small, and the powder itself ill-made and defective in  strength.    Guy was struck with the difference of demeanour between the men-at-arms  and archers, especially among the English contingent, and that of the  fugitives who poured in. What was a terrible blow to the latter was the  cause of a scarce concealed gratification among the former. The two months  that had been spent at the castle had, to the English, been a somewhat  monotonous time, and the prospect of active service and of the giving and  taking of blows made their blood course more rapidly through their veins.  It was the prospect of fighting rather than of pay that had attracted them  to the service of Sir Eustace. Then, as for a century previous and until  quite modern days, Frenchmen were regarded as the natural foes of England,  and however large a force an English king wished to collect for service in  France, he had never any difficulty whatever in obtaining the number he  asked for, and they were ready cheerfully to give battle whatever the odds  against them. The English archer's confidence in himself and his skill was  indeed supreme. Before the shafts of his forefathers the flower of the  French chivalry had gone down like rushes before a scythe, and from being  a mere accessory to a battle the English archers had become the backbone  of the force. Their skill, in fact, had revolutionized warfare, had broken  the power of cavalry, and had added to the dignity and value of infantry,  who had become, as they have ever since continued to be, the prime factor  in warfare. Consequently the English archers and men-at-arms went about  their work of preparation with a zest and cheerfulness that showed their  satisfaction in it.    \"Why, Tom,\" Guy said to the tall leader of the archers, \"you look as  pleased as if it were a feast rather than a fray for which you were  preparing.\"    \"And so I feel, Master Guy. For what have I been practising with the bow  since I was eight years old but that I might, when the time came, send an  arrow straight through the bars of a French vizor? In faith, I began to  think that I should never have an opportunity of exercising my skill on  anything more worthy than a target or peeled wand. Since our kings have  given up leading armies across the sea, there was no way but to take  service with our lord when I heard that he wanted a small company of  archers for the defence of his castle over here, and since we have come it  has seemed to us all that we were taking pay and food under false  pretences, and that we might as well have stopped at home where, at least,  we can compete in all honour and good temper against men as good as  ourselves, and with the certainty of winning a few silver pennies, to say  nothing of plaudits from the onlookers. 'Tis with our people as with the  knights of old; if they win in a tournament they take the armour of the  vanquished, the prize from the Queen of Beauty, and many a glance of  admiration from bright eyes. It is the same with us; for there is not an  English maid but would choose an archer who stands straight and firm, and  can carry off a prize when in good company, to a hind who thinks of naught  but delving the soil and tending the herd.\"    Guy laughed. \"I suppose it is the same, when you put it so, Long Tom; but  there will be none of your English maids to watch your prowess here.\"    \"No, Master Guy; but here we shall fight for our own satisfaction, and  prove to ourselves that we are as good men as our fathers were. I know  naught of this quarrel. Had Sir Eustace taken us into the field to fight  for one or other of these factions concerning which we know nothing, we  should doubtless have done our duty and fought manfully. But we are all  glad that here we are doing what we came for; we are going to defend the  castle against Frenchmen of some sort or other who would do ill to our  lord and lady, and we shall fight right heartily and joyfully, and should  still do so were it the mad king of France himself who marched against us.  Besides, master, we should be less than men if we did not feel for the  frightened women and children who, having done no wrong, and caring naught  for these factions, are forced to flee from their homes for their lives;  so we shall strike in just as we should strike in were we to come upon a  band of robbers ill-treating a woman at home.... Think you that they will  come, master?\" he added eagerly.    \"That I cannot say surely, Tom; but Sir Eustace has news that the  Burgundians have already seized several towns and placed garrisons there,  and that armed bands are traversing the country, burning and pillaging.  Whether they will feel strong enough to make an attack on this castle I  know not, but belike they will do so, for Sir Eustace, belonging as he  does, and as his fathers have done before him, to the English party,  neither of the others will feel any good-will towards him, and some of his  neighbours may well be glad to take advantage of this troubled time to"]]]
