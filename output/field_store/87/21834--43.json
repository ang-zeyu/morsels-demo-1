The iron men were growing up. Some of the men had only their feet in  the ground.    Some of them were in the ground up to their knees.    Some had only their heads out. They all tried to get out so they could  kill Jason.    Then Jason did what Medea told him he should do.    He took a giant's marble and threw it near the men.    All the iron men wanted to get the marble.    So they began to fight each other. As soon as one had his feet out of  the ground, he cut at the man next to him. So they killed each other.    Then Jason took his sword and cut off all the heads that were out of  the ground.    So all the iron men were killed and the king was very angry.    But Medea and the people were glad.

My father will not give it to you. A dragon is by the tree  where the golden fleece is, and he never sleeps. He is always hungry  and eats people if they go near him. I can not kill him but I can make  him sleep. He is very fond of cake. I will make some cake and put in  something to make the dragon sleep.\"           *       *       *       *       *              became        climbed         angry    So Medea made the cakes and Jason took them and threw them to the  dragon.    The dragon ate them all and went to sleep.    Then Jason climbed over the dragon and took the nail out of the tree.    He put the golden fleece under his coat and ran to the ship Argo.    Medea went with him and became his wife.    [Illustration: THE DRAGON FINDS THE FLEECE IS GONE.]    Oh, how angry the king was! He had lost the golden fleece and the  brass bulls and the dragon's teeth. And now his daughter was gone.           *       *       *       *       *              through       nine            stones    He sent his men in ships to take Jason, but they could not get him.    At last Medea and Jason and the other Argonauts came to Greece.    Jason's father was there. He was a very old man. Jason wanted his  father to be king, so he asked Medea to make the old man young.    Then Medea took her carriage and flew through the air.    She did not come back for nine days. She picked flowers from the  hills. She found all kinds of stones, too.           *       *       *       *       *              stick         died            woke    When she went home she put all these things into a pot and cooked  them.

So Medea knew the juice would make things grow.    Jason's father went to sleep and Medea put some of the juice into his  mouth.    His white hair turned black and teeth grew in his mouth.    When he woke up, he looked and felt like a young man.    He lived many years and when he died Jason was king."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7847"],[0,"Jack North's Treasure Hunt; Or, Daring Adventures in South America (#6)"],[1,"under his feet, which made a furious rush  to and fro, Jack groped his way further and further into the gloomy place.  The damp, sweaty walls covering him with a slimy moisture. Now and then  some of the loosened earth would fall upon him, adding to the uncanny  experience of his advance.    He expected the Chilians would follow him, but he hoped in some way he  might escape them. He kept on without hearing any sound of a pursuit,  until he was suddenly conscious of being confronted by some one, while a  trembling voice called out from the darkness ahead:    \"Stop! I am armed, and you come nearer at the peril of your life!\"    It was too dark for him to see any one, but he heard a slight movement as  the words were uttered, and he instantly recalled to mind the fact that  the fugitive fleeing from the Chilians was supposed to be hiding in this  place.    Accordingly, as he stopped, he said in a low tone:    \"Be careful and you have nothing to fear from me.\"    Jack had been glad to notice that the unknown had used pure English in  addressing him. In a moment he asked:    \"Who are you?\"    \"A friendless American boy who has been hunted down like a dog because--\"    \"Fret Offut!\" broke in Jack recognizing the other's voice.    \"Jack North!\" gasped the fugitive \"You have betrayed me, Jack!\"    \"Not a bit of that. I am here on account of you.\"    That was no time to question one's motives. Jack knew that the other was  his mortal enemy, but just then and there he could do no better than to  forget the past. Whatever the offense he had committed against the  Chilians, Fret was scarcely in worse color with them than himself.    It did not occur to honest Jack North that by delivering up his enemy he  might save his own life.    Though Fret had abused his confidence shamefully, he did not have the wish  to give him over to these foreign pursuers. For aught he knew his  companion might be as guilty of crime against them as against himself.    Meanwhile why had the Chilians not entered the cell in pursuit of their  prisoner? Were they in fear of him? Not so much that as they were in fear  of entering that underground retreat, teeming with superstitious  traditions.    In fact no Chilian could have been induced to enter there under any  provocation short of death!    Mr. Pearce knew this, and when he saw Jack disappear he was confident the  lad was safe for awhile.    It is true the leader of the party did command his men to enter, and  uttered all sorts of threats against them, but they simply listened  without moving.    Neither did their commander offer to lead the way.    Mr. Pearce, knowing this superstitious dread of all Chilians to enter the  subterranean prisons, waited until the leader had stopped commanding and  abusing his soldiers, when he ventured to interpose on Jack's account.    As he was a man of consequence in the opinion of the Chilian chief, his  words soon had the desired effect.    \"Somebody,--the person you are in pursuit of--may have landed on the  island last night, but this boy is a friend of mine and knows no more of  him you want than I do. I vouch for his honesty, and as he has been here  over a week you can see that he is not the one you are looking for, who  you say must have come here since sunset yesterday.\"    No doubt the Chilian was glad to get off so easily in doing what he deemed  was his duty, for he ordered his men to return to their vessel without  further delay.    That was the last to be seen of them, but Mr. Pearce cautiously waited  until he saw the ship sailing away from the island before he spoke to  Jack.    \"Come out of that hole if the bugs have not carried you off,\" he called  out in his blunt way. \"The Chilians have gone back to Valparaiso to report  that they could not find their man here.\"    Jack and Fret Offut had come to something of an understanding, though the  latter was reluctant to meet Mr. Pearce.    The islander was surprised at sight of him, but Jack hastened to say:    \"It proves the person those Chilians were so anxious to catch is an  acquaintance of mine, being none other than one of the _Standish's_  passengers.\"    \"A friend of yours, eh? Those infernal--excuse me, I don't believe I will  say it. Come, let's go down to the house.\"    If Mr. Pearce was not pleased with the appearance of young Offut he did  not show it, though he told Jack privately that it might be best for all  concerned if they should leave the island as soon as an opportunity  offered itself.    \"You see another searching party may come at any hour, and I might not be  as successful with another, particularly with two to answer for.\"    Jack had no desire to remain any longer than he could help, as pleasant as  he had found life with his newly-made friend. He was anxious to get to  Valparaiso before the _Standish_ should leave on her return voyage.    He had another reason, too, and a most important one.    He handed the paper he had picked up at the entrance to the convict cell  to Mr. Pearce for him to read if possible, for it was written in Spanish,  which he could not make out at the time.    Mr. Pearce read it with some difficulty, explaining it as best he could  when he had carefully studied it for half a day.          Chapter VIII    The Lonely Pimento        \"The writer of this strange manuscript,\" began Mr. Pearce, \"was evidently  an unlettered person, for it is filled with so many errors as to be  difficult to get the author's meaning in many places. He was also a  fugitive from justice.--I should judge, nearly all his life. He speaks of  the diamond mines of Brazil and the hoarded treasures of the children of  the sun in the same sentence. Then he goes on to describe a wonderful  island that he discovered while hiding from pursuers under the shadows of  the Andes in Tarapaca, Peru. Let me read:    \"'I had come out of a dense growth of corkwood to look on a big body of  water hemmed in by the mountains, when I saw some way from the shore a  small island. I noticed it particularly on account of a solitary pimento  tree standing in the centre, with a big rock at its foot.    \"'I was hard pressed by my enemies, and seeing what I believed was a hole  under the rock I swam out to the island. I did find plenty of room to hide  in and my pursuers did not think of looking there for me, though they made  the entire circuit of the water.    \"'I stayed there two days before I dared to venture out, but it was not  until I had decided to leave the place that I made the most wonderful  discovery of my life.    \"'The island, which was made up mostly of rocks, was fairly honey-combed  with tunnels and underground passages, little and big, every one of which  was filled with gold!    \"'Gold lay under my feet; gold on my left hand; gold on my right; gold  overhead; gold everywhere! I knew from certain inscriptions that I could  partly decipher that this hidden treasure was a part of the Incas wealth  in the days of Pizzaro.    \"'At first I was so bewildered by my discovery that I could do nothing,  but finally I took as much of it as I could carry and left the place.    \"'I was, as I thought, careful to note all of its surroundings so I could  come again when I should wish to get the rest of my hoard. I say I did  this carefully, but a year and a half later when I came to get the rest of  my treasure I could not find it. I could not even find the island, though  I went over the ground from Titocaca to Atacama a hundred times.    \"'I could not even find the lake!    \"'I felt sure I should know that pimento tree anywhere on account of its  odd shape. It had three branches leaving the trunk, one of which ran up  several feet higher than the others, a dead branch pointing to the  northward like a skeleton finger. There was a rim of mountains around the  lake, except for a break in the range on the north.    \"'Since I have been there the whole mystery has been solved in my mind and  I can see that the lonely pimento with its skeleton finger is the key. I  was there during the wet--\"    \"The rest is missing,\" said Mr. Pearce, \"but I have given you the  substance of the illiterate scrawl in tolerable English as far as it  remains. Looks as if the sheet had been torn apart. There is a fortune for  you if you can only find it.\"    Mr. Pearce spoke somewhat lightly, but Jack could see that he was deeply  interested in the account.    Our hero had been cautious enough not to let Fret Offut into the secret,  knowing he could not be trusted.    \"I believe I could find that wonderful island which plays at hide and seek  if I were to try it,\" said Mr. Pearce. \"What do you say to going fortune  hunting?\"    Naturally Jack's sanguine nature was thoroughly aroused and nothing could  have suited him better, and from that time they discussed the lost island  with its treasure at every opportunity they had when Fret was not with  them.    There was one serious drawback to their plans.    It might be a long time before they would have an opportunity to leave the  island where Robinson Crusoe had spent so many lonely years. During his  stay there Jack explored every part of the island. He noticed that the  soil had every promise of great fertility, but that even his friend had so  far taken on the laziness of the Chilians that he cultivated as little as  possible. This island had become a sort of rendezvous for the ships  rounding Cape Horn, and many of them had contributed to its natural and  animal wealth by planting orchards and sowing grains and in leaving there  many domesticated creatures.    But at this season of the year it was likely to be considerable time  before a vessel should touch there, and Jack had been on Robinson Crusoe's  island a little over a month, before he found a chance to go to  Valparaiso.    He was glad for the opportunity, but disappointed at the last moment to  find that Mr. Pearce had concluded to give up going with him.    \"Too much like work, Jack. You see I have fitted in"]]]
