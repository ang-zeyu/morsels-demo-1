And again, some of the lessons here are  given by excellent, but somewhat hasty and impatient teachers, who pass  from result to result, cutting short the process by which they are  arrived at; and these are not of the slightest service to her; she  learns nothing from them. There is a complaint of her handwriting. They  say she will not, or cannot, understand how to form her letters. I have  examined closely into this. It is true she writes slowly, stiffly, if  you like; but the hand is neither timid nor without character. The  French language is not my department, but I have taught her something of  it, in the step-by-step fashion; and this she understands easily.  Indeed, it is singular that she knows a great deal, and knows it well,  too; and yet when she is asked a question, it seems as if she knew  nothing.    \"To conclude generally, I should say she learns nothing like a person  who is being educated, but she learns like one who is to educate--not  like a pupil, but like a future teacher. Your ladyship may think it  strange that I, as an educator and a teacher, can find no higher praise  to give to any one than by a comparison with myself. I may leave it to  your own good sense, to your deep knowledge of the world and of mankind,  to make the best of my most inadequate, but well-intended expressions.  You may satisfy yourself that you have much happiness to promise  yourself from this child. I commend myself to your ladyship, and I  beseech you to permit me to write to you again as soon as I see reason  to believe that I have anything important or agreeable to communicate.\"    This letter gave Charlotte great pleasure. The contents of it coincided  very closely with the notions which she had herself conceived of  Ottilie. At the same time, she could not help smiling at the excessive  interest of the Assistant, which seemed greater than the insight into a  pupil's excellence usually calls forth. In her quiet, unprejudiced way  of looking at things, this relation, among others, she was contented to  permit to lie before her as a possibility; she could value the interest  of so sensible a man in Ottilie, having learnt, among the lessons of her  life, to see how highly true regard is to be prized in a world where  indifference or dislike are the common natural residents.          CHAPTER IV      The topographical chart of the property and its environs was completed.  It was executed on a considerable scale; the character of the particular  localities was made intelligible by various colors; and by means of a  trigonometrical survey the Captain had been able to arrive at a very  fair exactness of measurement. He had been rapid in his work. There was  scarcely ever any one who could do with less sleep than this most  laborious man; and, as his day was always devoted to an immediate  purpose, every evening something had been done.    \"Let us now,\" he said to his friend, \"go on to what remains for us, to  the statistics of the estate. We shall have a good deal of work to get  through at the beginning, and afterward we shall come to the farm  estimates, and much else which will naturally arise out of them. Only we  must have one thing distinctly settled and adhered to. Everything which  is properly _business_ we must keep carefully separate from life.  Business requires earnestness and method; _life_ must have a freer  handling. Business demands the utmost stringency and sequence; in life,  inconsecutiveness is frequently necessary, indeed, is charming and  graceful. If you are firm in the first, you can afford yourself more  liberty in the second; while if you mix them, you will find the free  interfering with and breaking in upon the fixed.\"    In these sentiments Edward felt a slight reflection upon himself. Though  not naturally disorderly, he could never bring himself to arrange his  papers in their proper places. What he had to do in connection with  others, was not kept separate from what depended only on himself.  Business got mixed up with amusement, and serious work with recreation.  Now, however, it was easy for him, with the help of a friend who would  take the trouble upon himself; and a second \"I\" worked out the  separation, to which the single \"I\" was always unequal.    In the Captain's wing, they contrived a depository for what concerned  the present, and an archive for the past. Here they brought all the  documents, papers, and notes from their various hiding-places, rooms,  drawers, and boxes, with the utmost speed. Harmony and order were  introduced into the wilderness, and the different packets were marked  and registered in their several pigeon-holes. They found all they wanted  in greater completeness even than they had expected; and here an old  clerk was found of no slight service, who for the whole day and part of  the night never left his desk, and with whom, till then, Edward had been  always dissatisfied.    \"I should not know him again,\" he said to his friend, \"the man is so  handy and useful.\"    \"That,\" replied the Captain, \"is because we give him nothing fresh to do  till he has finished, at his convenience, what he has already; and so,  as you perceive, he gets through a great deal. If you disturb him, he  becomes useless at once.\"    Spending their days together in this way, in the evenings they never  neglected their regular visits to Charlotte. If there was no party from  the neighborhood, as was often the case, they read and talked,  principally on subjects connected with the improvement of the condition  and comfort of social life.    Charlotte, always accustomed to make the most of opportunities, not only  saw her husband pleased, but found personal advantages for herself.  Various domestic arrangements, which she had long wished to make, but  which she did not know exactly how to set about, were managed for her  through the contrivance of the Captain. Her domestic medicine-chest,  hitherto but poorly furnished, was enlarged and enriched, and Charlotte  herself, with the help of good books and personal instruction, was put  in the way of being able to exercise her disposition to be of practical  assistance more frequently and more efficiently than before.    In providing against accidents, which, though common, yet only too often  find us unprepared, they thought it especially necessary to have at hand  whatever is required for the recovery of drowning men--accidents of this  kind, from the number of canals, reservoirs, and waterworks in the  neighborhood, being of frequent occurrence. This department the Captain  took expressly into his own hands; and the observation escaped Edward,  that a case of this kind had made a very singular epoch in the life of  his friend. The latter made no reply, but seemed to be trying to escape  from a painful recollection. Edward immediately stopped; and Charlotte,  who, as well as he, had a general knowledge of the story, took no notice  of the expression.    \"These preparations are all exceedingly valuable,\" said the Captain, one  evening. \"Now, however, we have not got the one thing which is most  essential--a sensible man who understands how to manage it all. I know  an army surgeon, whom I could exactly recommend for the place. You might  get him at this moment, on easy terms. He is highly distinguished in his  profession, and has frequently done more for me, in the treatment even  of violent inward disorders, than celebrated physicians. Help upon the  spot, is the thing you often most want in the country.\"    He was written for at once; and Edward and Charlotte were rejoiced to  have found so good and necessary an object on which to expend so much of  the money which they set apart for such accidental demands upon them.    Thus Charlotte, too, found means of making use, for her purposes, of the  Captain's knowledge and practical skill; and she began to be quite  reconciled to his presence, and to feel easy about any consequences  which might ensue. She commonly prepared questions to ask him; among  other things, it was one of her anxieties to provide against whatever  was prejudicial to health and comfort, against poisons and such like.  The lead-glazing on the china, the verdigris which formed about her  copper and bronze vessels, etc., had long been a trouble to her. She got  him to tell her about these, and, naturally, they often had to fall back  on the first elements of medicine and chemistry.    An accidental, but welcome occasion for entertainment of this kind, was  given by an inclination of Edward to read aloud. He had a particularly  clear, deep voice, and earlier in life had earned himself a pleasant  reputation for his feeling and lively recitations of works of poetry and  oratory. At this time he was occupied with other subjects, and the books  which, for some time past, he had been reading, were either chemical or  on some other branch of natural or technical science.    One of his especial peculiarities--which, by-the-by, he very likely  shares with a number of his fellow-creatures--was, that he could not  bear to have any one looking over him when he was reading. In early  life, when he used to read poems, plays, or stories, this had been the  natural consequence of the desire which the reader feels, like the poet,  or the actor, or the story-teller, to make surprises, to pause, to  excite expectation; and this sort of effect was naturally defeated when  a third person's eyes could run on before him, and see what was coming.  On such occasions, therefore, he was accustomed to place himself in such  a position that no one could get behind him. With a party of only three,  this was unnecessary; and as with the present subject there was no  opportunity for exciting feelings or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11367"],[0,"A History of China (#7)"],[1,"army  organization was in units of one hundred men which were combined as  \"right\", \"left\" and \"central\" units into an army of 300 men. But it  seems that the central power did not extend very far. In the more  distant parts of the realm were more or less independent lords, who  recognized the ruler only as their supreme lord and religious leader. We  may describe this as an early, loose form of the feudal system, although  the main element of real feudalism was still absent. The main  obligations of these lords were to send tributes of grain, to  participate with their soldiers in the wars, to send tortoise shells to  the capital to be used there for oracles, and to send occasionally  cattle and horses. There were some thirty such dependent states.  Although we do not know much about the general population, we know that  the rulers had a patrilinear system of inheritance. After the death of  the ruler his brothers followed him on the throne, the older brothers  first. After the death of all brothers, the sons of older or younger  brothers became rulers. No preference was shown to the son of the oldest  brother, and no preference between sons of main or of secondary wives is  recognizable. Thus, the Shang patrilinear system was much less extreme  than the later system. Moreover, the deceased wives of the rulers played  a great role in the cult, another element which later disappeared. From  these facts and from the general structure of Shang religion it has been  concluded that there was a strong matrilinear strain in Shang culture.  Although this cannot be proved, it seems quite plausible because we know  of matrilinear societies in the South of China at later times.    About the middle of the Shang period there occurred interesting  changes, probably under the influence of nomad peoples from the  north-west.    In religion there appears some evidence of star-worship. The deities  seem to have been conceived as a kind of celestial court of Shang Ti,  as his \"officials\". In the field of material culture, horse-breeding  becomes more and more evident. Some authors believe that the art of  riding was already known in late Shang times, although it was certainly  not yet so highly developed that cavalry units could be used in war.  With horse-breeding the two-wheeled light war chariot makes its  appearance. The wheel was already known in earlier times in the form of  the potter's wheel. Recent excavations have brought to light burials in  which up to eighteen chariots with two or four horses were found  together with the owners of the chariots. The cart is not a Chinese  invention but came from the north, possibly from Turkish peoples. It has  been contended that it was connected with the war chariot of the Near  East: shortly before the Shang period there had been vast upheavals in  western Asia, mainly in connection with the expansion of peoples who  spoke Indo-European languages (Hittites, etc.) and who became successful  through the use of quick, light, two-wheeled war-chariots. It is  possible, but cannot be proved, that the war-chariot spread  through Central Asia in connection with the spread of such  Indo-European-speaking groups or by the intermediary of Turkish tribes.  We have some reasons to believe that the first Indo-European-speaking  groups arrived in the Far East in the middle of the second millennium  B.C. Some authors even connect the Hsia with these groups. In any case,  the maximal distribution of these people seems to have been to the  western borders of the Shang state. As in Western Asia, a Shang-time  chariot was manned by three men: the warrior who was a nobleman, his  driver, and his servant who handed him arrows or other weapons when  needed. There developed a quite close relationship between the nobleman  and his chariot-driver. The chariot was a valuable object, manufactured  by specialists; horses were always expensive and rare in China, and in  many periods of Chinese history horses were directly imported from  nomadic tribes in the North or West. Thus, the possessors of vehicles  formed a privileged class in the Shang realm; they became a sort of  nobility, and the social organization began to move in the direction of  feudalism. One of the main sports of the noblemen in this period, in  addition to warfare, was hunting. The Shang had their special hunting  grounds south of the mountains which surround Shansi province, along the  slopes of the T'ai-hang mountain range, and south to the shores of the  Yellow river. Here, there were still forests and swamps in Shang time,  and boars, deer, buffaloes and other animals, as well as occasional  rhinoceros and elephants, were hunted. None of these wild animals was  used as a sacrifice; all sacrificial animals, such as cattle, pigs,  etc., were domesticated animals.    Below the nobility we find large numbers of dependent people; modern  Chinese scholars call them frequently \"slaves\" and speak of a \"slave  society\". There is no doubt that at least some farmers were \"free  farmers\"; others were what we might call \"serfs\": families in hereditary  group dependence upon some noble families and working on land which the  noble families regarded as theirs. Families of artisans and craftsmen  also were hereditary servants of noble families--a type of social  organization which has its parallels in ancient Japan and in later India  and other parts of the world. There were also real slaves: persons who  were the personal property of noblemen. The independent states around  the Shang state also had serfs. When the Shang captured neighbouring  states, they resettled the captured foreign aristocracy by attaching  them as a group to their own noblemen. The captured serfs remained under  their masters and shared their fate. The same system was later practiced  by the Chou after their conquest of the Shang state.    The conquests of late Shang added more territory to the realm than could  be coped with by the primitive communications of the time. When the last  ruler of Shang made his big war which lasted 260 days against the tribes  in the south-east, rebellions broke out which lead to the end of the  dynasty, about 1028 B.C. according to the new chronology (1122 B.C. old  chronology).          ANTIQUITY        Chapter Three      THE CHOU DYNASTY (_c_. 1028-257 B.C.)    1 _Cultural origin of the Chou and end of the Shang dynasty_    The Shang culture still lacked certain things that were to become  typical of \"Chinese\" civilization. The family system was not yet the  strong patriarchal system of the later Chinese. The religion, too, in  spite of certain other influences, was still a religion of agrarian  fertility. And although Shang society was strongly stratified and showed  some tendencies to develop a feudal system, feudalism was still very  primitive. Although the Shang script was the precursor of later Chinese  script, it seemed to have contained many words which later disappeared,  and we are not sure whether Shang language was the same as the language  of Chou time. With the Chou period, however, we enter a period in which  everything which was later regarded as typically \"Chinese\" began to  emerge.    During the time of the Shang dynasty the Chou formed a small realm in  the west, at first in central Shensi, an area which even in much later  times was the home of many \"non-Chinese\" tribes. Before the beginning of  the eleventh century B.C. they must have pushed into eastern Shensi, due  to pressures of other tribes which may have belonged to the Turkish  ethnic group. However, it is also possible that their movement was  connected with pressures from Indo-European groups. An analysis of their  tribal composition at the time of the conquest seems to indicate that  the ruling house of the Chou was related to the Turkish group, and that  the population consisted mainly of Turks and Tibetans. Their culture was  closely related to that of Yang-shao, the previously described  painted-pottery culture, with, of course, the progress brought by time.  They had bronze weapons and, especially, the war-chariot. Their eastward  migration, however, brought them within the zone of the Shang culture,  by which they were strongly influenced, so that the Chou culture lost  more and more of its original character and increasingly resembled the  Shang culture. The Chou were also brought into the political sphere of  the Shang, as shown by the fact that marriages took place between the  ruling houses of Shang and Chou, until the Chou state became nominally  dependent on the Shang state in the form of a dependency with special  prerogatives. Meanwhile the power of the Chou state steadily grew, while  that of the Shang state diminished more and more through the disloyalty  of its feudatories and through wars in the East. Finally, about 1028  B.C., the Chou ruler, named Wu Wang (\"the martial king\"), crossed his  eastern frontier and pushed into central Honan. His army was formed by  an alliance between various tribes, in the same way as happened again  and again in the building up of the armies of the rulers of the steppes.  Wu Wang forced a passage across the Yellow River and annihilated the  Shang army. He pursued its vestiges as far as the capital, captured the  last emperor of the Shang, and killed him. Thus was the Chou dynasty  founded, and with it we begin the actual history of China. The Chou  brought to the Shang culture strong elements of Turkish and also Tibetan  culture, which were needed for the release of such forces as could  create a new empire and maintain it through thousands of years as a  cultural and, generally, also a political unit.    2 _Feudalism in the new empire_    A natural result of the situation thus produced was the turning of the  country into a feudal state. The conquerors were an alien minority, so  that they had to march out and spread over the whole country. Moreover,  the allied tribal chieftains expected to be rewarded. The"]]]
