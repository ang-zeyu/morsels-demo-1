Robinson Crusoe was loose and vague in the  placing of his island. It is said that Izaak Walton waved a hand obscurely  toward the stream where he had made a catch, but could not be cornered to a  nice direction, lest his pool be overrun. In early youth, I myself went, on  a mischievous hint, to explore a remote region which I was told lay in the  dark behind the kindling pile. But because I moved in a fearful darkness,  quite beyond the pale light from the furnace room, I lost the path. It did  not lead me to the peaks and the roaring waters.    But the farm was reached by more open methods. Dolly and the phaeton were  the chief instruments. First--if you were so sunk in ignorance as not to  know the road--you inquired of everybody for the chewing gum factory, to be  known by its smell of peppermint. Then you sought the high bridge over the  railroad tracks. Beyond was Kamm's Corners. Here, at a turn of the road,  was a general store whose shelves sampled the produce of this whole fair  world and the factories thereof. One might have thought that the proprietor  emulated Noah at the flood by bidding two of each created things to find a  place inside.    Beyond Kamm's Corners you came to the great valley. When almost down the  hill you passed a house with broken windows and unkept grass. This house,  by report, was haunted, but you could laugh at such tales while the morning  sun was up. At the bottom of the hill a bridge crossed the river, with  loose planking that rattled as though the man who made nails was dead.    Beyond the bridge, at the first rise of ground, the horse stopped--for I  assume that you drove a sagacious animal--by way of hint that every one  of sound limb get out and walk to the top of the hill. A suspicious horse  turned his head now and again and cast his eye upon the buggy to be sure  that no one climbed in again.    Presently you came to the toll-gate at the top and paid its keeper five  cents, or whatever large sum he demanded. Then your grandfather--if by  fortunate chance you happened to have one--asked after his wife and  children, and had they missed the croup; then told him his corn was looking  well.    My grandfather--for it is time you knew him--lived with us. Because of a  railway accident fifteen years before in which one of his legs was cut off  just below the knee, he had retired from public office. Several years of  broken health had been followed by years that were for the most part free  from suffering. My own first recollection reverts to these better years.  I recall a tall man--to my eyes a giant, for he was taller even than my  father--who came into the nursery as I was being undressed. There was a  wind in the chimney, and the windows rattled. He put his crutches against  the wall. Then taking me in his arms, he swung me aloft to his shoulder  by a series of somersaults. I cried this first time, but later I came to  demand the performance.    Once, when I was a little older, I came upon one of his discarded wooden  legs as I was playing in the garret of the house. It was my first  acquaintance with such a contrivance. It lay behind a pile of trunks and I  was, at the time, on my way to the center of the earth, for the cheerful  path dove into darkness behind the chimney. You may imagine my surprise. I  approached it cautiously. I viewed it from all sides by such dusty light as  fell between the trunks. Not without fear I touched it. It was unmistakably  a leg--but whose? Was it possible that there was a kind of Bluebeard in the  family, who, for his pleasure, lopped off legs? There had been no breath of  such a scandal. Yet, if my reading and studies were correct, such things  had happened in other families not very different from ours; not in our own  town maybe, but in such near-by places as Kandahar and Serendib--places  which in my warm regard were but as suburbs to our street, to be gained if  you persevered for a hundred lamp-posts. Or could the leg belong to Annie  the cook? Her nimbleness with griddle-cakes belied the thought: And once,  when the wind had swished her skirts, manifestly she was whole and sound.  Then all at once I knew it to be my grandfather's. Grown familiar, I pulled  it to the window. I tried it on, but made bad work of walking.    To the eye my grandfather had two legs all the way down and, except for  his crutches and an occasional squeak, you would not have detected his  infirmity. Evidently the maker did no more than imitate nature, although,  for myself, I used to wonder at the poverty of his invention. There would  be distinction in a leg, which in addition to its usual functions, would  also bend forward at the knee, or had a surprising sidewise joint--and  there would be profit, too, if one cared to make a show of it. The greatest  niggard on the street would pay two pins for such a sight.    As my grandfather was the only old gentleman of my acquaintance, a wooden  leg seemed the natural and suitable accompaniment of old age. Persons, it  appeared, in their riper years, cast off a leg, as trees dropped their  leaves. But my grandmother puzzled me. Undeniably she retained both of  hers, yet her hair was just as white, and she was almost as old. Evidently  this law of nature worked only with men. Ladies, it seemed, were not  deciduous. But how the amputation was effected in men--whether by day or  night--how the choice fell between the right and left--whether the wooden  leg came down the chimney (a proper entrance)--how soon my father would go  the way of all masculine flesh and cast his off--these matters I could not  solve. The Arabian Nights were silent on the subject. Aladdin's uncle,  apparently, had both his legs. He was too brisk in villainy to admit a  wooden leg. But then, he was only an uncle. If his history ran out to the  end, doubtless he would go with a limp in his riper days. The story of the  Bible--although it trafficked in such veterans as Methuselah--gave not a  hint. Abraham died full of years. Here would have been a proper test--but  the book was silent.    My grandfather in those days had much leisure time. He still kept an office  at the rear of the house, although he had given up the regular practice  of the law. But a few old clients lingered on, chiefly women who carried  children in their arms and old men without neckties who came to him for  free advice. These he guided patiently in their troubles, and he would sit  an hour to listen to a piteous story. In an extremity he gave them money,  or took a well-meant but worthless note. Often his callers overran the  dinner hour and my mother would have to jingle the dinner bell at the door  to rouse them. Occasionally he would be called on for a public speech, and  for several days he would be busy at his desk. Frequently he presided at  dinners and would tell a story and sing a song, for he had a fine bass  voice and was famous for his singing.    He read much in those last years in science. When he was not reading  Trowbridge to his grandchildren, it was Huxley to himself. But when his  eyes grew tired, he would on an occasion--if there was canning in the  house--go into the kitchen where my mother and grandmother worked, and help  pare the fruit. Seriously, as though he were engaged upon a game, he would  cut the skin into thinnest strips, unbroken to the end, and would hold up  the coil for us to see. Or if he broke it in the cutting it was a point  against him in the contest.    His diversion rather than his profit was the care and rental of about  twenty small houses, some of which he built to fit his pensioners. My  brother and myself often made the rounds with him in the phaeton. At most  of the houses he was affectionately greeted as \"Jedge\" and was held in long  conversations across the fence. And to see an Irishman was to see a friend.  They all knew him and said, \"Good mornin',\" as we passed. He and they were  good Democrats together.    I can see in memory a certain old Irishman in a red flannel shirt, with his  foot upon the hub, bending across the wheel and gesticulating in an endless  discussion of politics or crops, while my brother and I were impatient to  be off. Dolly was of course patient, for she had long since passed her  fretful youth. If by any biological chance it had happened that she had  been an old lady instead of a horse, she would have been the kind that  spent her day in a rocker with her knitting. Any one who gave Dolly an  excuse for standing was her friend. There she stood as though she wished  the colloquy to last forever.    It was seldom that Dolly lost her restraint. She would, indeed, when she  came near the stable, somewhat hasten her stride; and when we came on our  drives to the turning point and at last headed about for home, Dolly would  know it and show her knowledge by a quickening of the ears and the quiver  of a faint excitement. Yet Dolly lost her patience when there were flies.  Then she threw off all repression and so waved her tail that she regularly  got it across the reins. This stirred my grandfather to something not  far short of anger. How vigorously would he try to dislodge the reins  by pulling and jerking! Dolly only clamped down her tail the harder.  Experience showed that the only way was to go slowly and craftily and  without heat or temper--a slackening of the reins--a distraction of Dolly's  attention--a leaning across the dashboard--a firm grasping of the tail out  near the end--a sudden raising thereof. Ah! It was done. We all settled  back against the cushions. Or perhaps a friendly fly would come to our  assistance and Dolly would have to use her tail in another direction.    The whip was seldom used. Generally it stood in its socket. It was  ornamental like a flagstaff. It forgot its sterner functions. But Dolly  must have known the whip in some former life, for even a gesture toward"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10026"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

This is all done in what he considers facetious play, with a view to  giving you a hint to examine your pockets, and see what _bon-bons_ you  have got for him, as he munches cakes and comfits with epicurean _gout_;  and if the door be ajar, he will gravely take his station behind your  chair at meal-time, like a lackey, giving you an admonitory kick every  now and then, if you fail to help him as well as yourself.--_Two Years  in New South Wales._      A MAGNIFICENT WATERFALL.      My swarthy guides, although this was unquestionably the first time that  they had ever led a traveller to view the remarkable scenery of their  country, evinced a degree of tact, as _ciceroni_, as well as natural  feeling of the picturesque, that equally pleased and surprised me.  Having forewarned me that this was not yet the waterfall, they now  pioneered the way for about a mile farther along the rocks, some of them  keeping near, and continually cautioning me to look to my feet, as a  single false step might precipitate me into the raging abyss of waters,  the tumult of which seemed to shake even the solid rocks around us.    At length we halted, as before, and the next moment I was led to a  projecting rock, where a scene burst upon me, far surpassing my most  sanguine expectations. The whole water of the river (except what escapes  by the subsidiary channel we had crossed, and by a similar one on the  north side) being previously confined to a bed of scarcely one hundred  feet in breadth, descends at once in a magnificent cascade of full four  hundred feet in height. I stood upon a cliff nearly level with the top  of the fall, and directly in front of it. The beams of the evening sun  fell upon the cascade, and occasioned a most splendid rainbow; while the  vapoury mists arising from the broken waters, the bright green woods  that hung from the surrounding cliffs, the astounding roar of the  waterfall, and the tumultuous boiling and whirling of the stream below,  striving to escape along its deep, dark, and narrow, path, formed  altogether a combination of beauty and grandeur, such as I never before  witnessed. As I gazed on this stupendous stream, I felt as if in a  dream. The sublimity of nature drowned all apprehensions of danger; and,  after a short pause, I hastily left the spot where I stood to gain a  nearer view from a cliff that impended over the foaming gulf. I had just  reached this station, when I felt myself grasped all at once by four  Korannas, who simultaneously seized hold of me by the arms and legs. My  first impression was, that they were going to hurl me over the  precipice; but it was a momentary thought, and it wronged the friendly  savages. They are themselves a timid race, and they were alarmed, lest  my temerity should lead me into danger. They hurried me back from the  brink, and then explained their motive, and asked my forgiveness. I was  not ungrateful for their care, though somewhat annoyed by their  officiousness.--_Thompson's Travels in Southern Africa._      SETTING IN OF AN INDIAN MONSOON.      The shades of evening approached as we reached the ground, and just as  the encampment was completed the atmosphere grew suddenly dark, the heat  became oppressive, and an unusual stillness presaged the immediate  setting in of the monsoon. The whole appearance of nature resembled  those solemn preludes to earthquakes and hurricanes in the West Indies,  from which the east in general is providentially free. We were allowed  very little time for conjecture; in a few minutes the heavy clouds burst  over us.... I witnessed seventeen monsoons in India, but this exceeded  them all in its awful appearance and dreadful effects.    Encamped in a low situation, on the borders of a lake formed to collect  the surrounding water, we found ourselves in a few hours in a liquid  plain. The tent-pins giving way, in a loose soil, the tents fell down,  and left the whole army exposed to the contending elements.    It requires a lively imagination to conceive the situation of a hundred  thousand human beings of every description, with more than two hundred  thousand elephants, camels, horses, and oxen, suddenly overwhelmed by  this dreadful storm, in a strange country, without any knowledge of high  or low ground; the whole being covered by an immense lake, and  surrounded by thick darkness, which prevented our distinguishing a  single object, except such as the vivid glare of lightning displayed in  horrible forms. No language can describe the wreck of a large encampment  thus instantaneously destroyed and covered with water, amid the cries of  old men and helpless women, terrified by the piercing shrieks of their  expiring children, unable to afford them relief. During this dreadful  night more than two hundred persons and three thousand cattle perished,  and the morning dawn exhibited a shocking spectacle.--_Forbes's Oriental  Memoirs._      GRACE OF CARRIAGE.      This requires not only a perfect freedom of motion, but also a firmness  of step, or constant steady bearing of the centre of gravity over the  base. It is usually possessed by those who live in the country, and  according to nature, as it is called, and who take much and varied  exercise. What a contrast is there between the gait of the active  mountaineer, rejoicing in the consciousness of perfect nature, and of  the mechanic or shopkeeper, whose life is spent in the cell of his  trade, and whose body soon receives a shape and air that correspond to  this!--and in the softer sex, what a contrast is there, between her who  recalls to us the fabled Diana of old, and that other, who has scarcely  trodden but on smooth pavements or carpets, and who, under any new  circumstances, carries her person as awkwardly as something to the  management of which she is not accustomed.    _Arnott's Elements of Physics._      THE CAVALRY SCHOOL OF ST. GERMAINS.      Bonaparte frequently visited the school of infantry at St. Cyr, reviewed  the cadets, and gave them cold collations in the park. But he had never  visited the school of cavalry since its establishment, of which we were  very jealous, and did all in our power to attract him. Whenever he  hunted, the cadets were in grand parade on the parterre, crying, _\"Vive  l'Empereur!\"_ with all their young energies; he held his hat raised as  he passed them; but that was all we could gain. Wise people whispered  that he never would go whilst they were so evidently expecting him; that  he liked to keep them always on the alert; it was good for discipline.  The general took another plan, and once allowed no sign of life about  the castle when the emperor passed--it was like a deserted place. But it  did not take neither; he passed, as if there were no castle there. It  was _desesperant._ When, lo! the next day but one after I had spoken to  him, he suddenly galloped into the court of the castle, and the cry of  the sentinel, _\"L'Empereur!\"_ was the first notice they had of it. He  examined into every thing. All were in undress, all at work, and this  was what he wanted. In the military-schools the cadets got  ammunition-bread, and lived like well-fed soldiers; but there was great  outcry in the circles of Paris against the bread of the school of St.  Germain's. Ladies complained that their sons were poisoned by it; the  emperor thought it was all nicety, and said no man was fit to be an  officer who could not eat ammunition-bread. However, being there, he  asked for a loaf, which was brought, and he saw it was villanous trash,  composed of pease, beans, rye, potatoes, and every thing that would make  flour or meal, instead of good brown wheaten flour. He tore the loaf in  two in a rage, and dashed it against the wall, and there it stuck like a  piece of mortar, to the great annoyance of those whose duty it was to  have attended to this. He ordered the baker to be called, and made him  look at it _sticking_. The man was in great terror first at the  emperor's anger, but, taking heart, he begged his majesty not to take  his contract from him, and he would give good bread in future; at which  the emperor broke into a royal and imperial passion, and threatened to  send him to the galleys; but, suddenly turning round, he said, \"Yes, he  would allow him to keep his contract, on condition that, as long as it  lasted, he should furnish the school with good white household bread,  _(pain de menage,)_ such as was sold in the bakers' shops in Paris; that  he might choose that, or lose his contract;\" and the baker thankfully  promised to furnish good white bread in future, at the same  price.--_Appendix to the 9th volume of Scott's Life of Napoleon._      CENTRE OF GRAVITY, IN REFERENCE TO SEA-SICKNESS.      Man requiring so strictly to maintain his perpendicularity, that is, to  keep the centre of gravity always over the support of his body,  ascertains the required position in various ways, but chiefly by the  perpendicularity or known position of things about him. Vertigo, and  sickness commonly called sea-sickness, because it most frequently occurs  at sea, are the consequences of depriving him of his standards of  comparison, or of disturbing them.    Hence on shipboard, where the lines of the masts, windows, furniture,  &c. are constantly changing, sickness, vertigo, and other affections of  the same class are common to persons unaccustomed to ships. Many  experience similar effects in carriages, and in swings, or on looking  from a lofty precipice, where known objects being distant, and viewed  under a new aspect, are not so readily recognised: also in walking on a  wall or roof, in looking directly up to a roof, or to the stars in the  zenith, because, then, all standards disappear: on walking into a round  room, where there are no perpendicular lines of light and shade, as when  the walls and roof are covered"]]]
