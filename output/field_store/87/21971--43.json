While the escort was  preparing, the prisoner, before he was carried from the fatal apartment,  desired to look at the dead body, which had been deposited upon the  large table, (at the head of which Harry Wakefield had just presided)  until the surgeons should examine the wound. The face of the corpse was  decently covered with a napkin. Robin Oig removed the cloth, and gazed  on the lifeless visage. While those present expected that the wound,  which had so lately flooded the apartment with gore, would send forth  fresh streams at the touch of the homicide, Robin Oig replaced the  covering, with the brief exclamation, \"He was a pretty man!\"    My story is nearly ended. The unfortunate Highlander stood his trial at  Carlisle. I was myself present. The facts of the case were proved in the  manner I have related them; and whatever might be at first the prejudice  of the audience against a crime so un-English as that of assassination  from revenge, yet when the national prejudices of the prisoner had been  explained, which made him consider himself as stained with indelible  dishonour, the generosity of the English audience was inclined to regard  his crime as the aberration of a false idea of honour, rather than as  flowing from a heart naturally savage, or habitually vicious. I shall  never forget the charge of the venerable judge to the jury.    \"We have had,\" he said, \"in the previous part of our duty, (alluding to  some former trials,) to discuss crimes which infer disgust and  abhorrence, while they call down the well-merited vengeance of the law.  It is now our still more melancholy duty to apply its salutary, though  severe enactments to a case of a very singular character, in which the  crime (for a crime it is, and a deep one) arose less out of the  malevolence of the heart, than the error of the understanding--less from  any idea of committing wrong, than from an unhappily perverted notion of  that which is right. Here we have two men, highly esteemed, it has been  stated, in their rank of life, and attached, it seems, to each other as  friends, one of whose lives has been already sacrificed to a punctilio,  and the other is about to prove the vengeance of the offended laws; and  yet both may claim our commiseration at least, as men acting in  ignorance of each other's national prejudices, and unhappily misguided  rather than voluntarily erring from the path of right conduct.    \"In the original cause of the misunderstanding, we must in justice give  the right to the prisoner at the bar. He had acquired possession of the  enclosure, by a legal contract with the proprietor, and yet, when  accosted with galling reproaches he offered to yield up half his  acquisition, and his amicable proposal was rejected with scorn. Then  follows the scene at Mr. Heskett the publican's, and you will observe  how the stranger was treated by the deceased, and I am sorry to observe,  by those around, who seem to have urged him in a manner which was  aggravating in the highest degree.    \"Gentlemen of the jury, it was with some impatience that I heard my  learned brother, who opened the case for the crown, give an unfavourable  turn to the prisoner's conduct on this occasion. He said the prisoner  was afraid to encounter his antagonist in fair fight, or to submit to  the laws of the ring; and that therefore, like a cowardly Italian, he  had recourse to his fatal stiletto, to murder the man whom he dared not  meet in manly encounter. I observed the prisoner shrink from this part  of the accusation with the abhorrence natural to a brave man; and as I  would wish to make my words impressive, when I point his real crime, I  must secure his opinion of my impartiality, by rebutting every thing  that seems to me a false accusation. There can be no doubt that the  prisoner is a man of resolution--too much resolution; I wish to heaven  that he had less, or rather that he had had a better education to  regulate it.           *       *       *       *       *    \"But, gentlemen of the jury, the pinch of the case lies in the interval  of two hours betwixt the injury and the fatal retaliation. In the heat  of affray and _chaude melee_, law, compassionating the infirmities of  humanity, makes allowance for the passions which rule such a stormy  moment--But the time necessary to walk twelve miles, however speedily  performed, was an interval sufficient for the prisoner to have  recollected himself; and the violence and deliberate determination with  which he carried his purpose into effect, could neither be induced by  anger, nor fear. It was the purpose and the act of pre-determined  revenge, for which law neither can, will, nor ought to have sympathy.           *       *       *       *       *    \"The law says to the subjects, with a voice only inferior to that of the  Deity, 'Vengeance is mine.' The instant that there is time for passion  to cool, and reason to interpose, an injured party must become aware,  that the law assumes the exclusive cognizance of the right and wrong  betwixt the parties, and opposes her inviolable buckler to every attempt  of the private party to right himself. I repeat, that this unhappy man  ought personally to be the object rather of our pity than our  abhorrence, for he failed in his ignorance, and from mistaken notions of  honour. But his crime is not the less that of murder, gentlemen, and, in  your high and important office, it is your duty so to find. Englishmen  have their angry passions as well as Scots; and should this man's action  remain unpunished, you may unsheath, under various pretences, a thousand  daggers betwixt the Land's-end and the Orkneys.\"    The venerable judge thus ended what, to judge by his emotion and tears,  was really a painful task. The jury, accordingly brought in a verdict of  guilty; and Robin Oig M'Combich, _alias_ M'Gregor, was sentenced to  death, and executed accordingly. He met his fate with firmness, and  acknowledged the justice of his sentence. But he repelled indignantly  the observations of those who accused him of attacking an unarmed man.  \"I give a life for the life I took,\" he said, \"and what can I do more?\"        [17] _We_ remember the proverb, \"Honour among thieves.\"        [18] But we cannot so far forget our country as to be      indifferent to them.--See a passage in the _Two Drovers_.           *       *       *       *       *      A PERSIAN FABLE.

An absent man, whose heart can seldom resist the importunities of  beggars, was, a few mornings since, followed by a hungry half-starved  dog, when he inadvertently took from his pocket a penny, which he was  just about to give to the four-footed wanderer, when he perceived his  mistake. It should be mentioned that the above individual had, on nearly  the precise spot, on the previous night, assisted one of his fellow  creatures in the same manner as that in which he was about to relieve  the quadruped.

The statistics  of population show an increase of 16 per cent. on the last decennial  period, while the increase in the United Kingdom in the ten years  preceding the last census was under 11 per cent.

M. Tresca has lately presented to the Academy of Sciences some very  interesting experiments on the development and distribution of heat  produced by a blow of the steam hammer in the process of forging. The  method used was as follows: The bar was carefully polished on both  sides, and this polished part covered with a thin layer of wax. It was  then placed on an anvil and struck by a monkey of known weight, P,  falling from a height, H. The faces of the monkey and anvil were exactly  alike, and care was taken that the whole work, T = PH, should be  expended upon the bar. A single blow was enough to melt the wax over a  certain zone; and this indicated clearly how much of the lateral faces  had been raised by the shock to the temperature of melting wax. The form  of this melted part could be made to differ considerably, but  approximated to that of an equilateral hyperbola. Let A be the area of  this zone, b the width of the bar, d the density, C the heat capacity,  and t-t0 the excess of temperature of melting wax over the temperature  of the air. Then, assuming that the area, A, is the base of a horizontal  prism, which is everywhere heated to the temperature, t, the heating  effect produced will be expressed by    Ab x d x C(t-t0)    Multiplying this by 425, or Joule's equivalent for the metrical system,  the energy developed in heat is given by    T1 = 425 AbdC(t-t0).    Dividing T1 by T, we obtain the ratio which the energy developed in heat  bears to the total energy of the blow.    With regard to the form of the zone of melting, it was found always to  extend round the edges of the indent produced in the bar by the blow. We  are speaking for the present of cases where the faces of the monkey and  anvil were sharp. On the sides of the bar the zone took the form of a  sort of cross with curved arms, the arms being thinner or thicker  according to the greater or less energy of the shock. These forms are  shown in Figs. 1 to 6. It will be seen that these zones correspond to  the zones of greatest sliding in the deformation of a bar forged with a  sharp edged hammer, showing in fact that it is the mechanical work done  in this sliding which is afterward transformed into heat.    [Illustration]    With regard to the ratio, above mentioned, between the heat developed  and the energy of the blow, it is very much greater than had been  expected when the other sources of loss were taken into consideration.  In some cases it reached 80 per cent., and in a table given the limits  vary for an iron bar between 68.4 per cent. with an energy of 40  kilogram-meters, and 83.6 per cent. with an energy of 90  kilogram-meters. With copper the energy is nearly constant at 70 per  cent. It will be seen that the proportion is less when the energy is  less, and it also diminishes with the section of the bar. This is no  doubt due to the fact that the heat is then conducted away more rapidly.  On the whole, the results are summed up by M. Tresca as follows:    (1) The development of heat depends on the form of the faces and the  energy of the blow.    (2) In the case of faces with sharp edges, the process described allows  this heat to be clearly indicated.    (3) The development of heat is greatest where the shearing of the  material is strongest. This shearing is therefore the mechanical cause  which produces the heating effect.    (4) With a blow of sufficient energy and a bar of sufficient size, about  80 per cent. of the energy reappears in the heat.    (5) The figures formed by the melted wax give a sort of diagram, showing  the distribution of the heat and the character of the deformation in the  bar.    (6) Where the energy is small the calculation of the percentage is not  reliable.    So far we have spoken only of cases where the anvil and monkey have  sharp faces. Where the faces are rounded the phenomena are somewhat  different. Figs. 7 to 12 give the area of melted wax in the case of bars  struck with blows gradually increasing in energy. It will be seen that,  instead of commencing at the edges of the indent, the fusion begins near  the middle, and appears in small triangular figures, which gradually  increase in width and depth until at last they meet at the apex, as in  Fig. 12. The explanation is that with the rounded edges the compression  at first takes place only in the outer layers of the bar, the inner  remaining comparatively unaffected. Hence the development of heat is  concentrated on these outer layers, so long as the blows are moderate in  intensity. The same thing had already been remarked in cases of holes  punched with a rounded punch, where the burr, when examined, was found  to have suffered the greatest compression just below the punch. With  regard to the percentage of energy developed as heat, it was about the  same as in the previous experiments, reaching in one case, with an iron  bar and with an energy of 110 kilogram-meters, the exceedingly high  figure of 91 per cent. With copper, the same figure varied between 50  and 60 per cent.--_Iron_.           *       *       *       *       *          A NOVEL PROPELLER ENGINE.    By Prof. C.W. MacCord.      The accompanying engravings illustrate the arrangement of a propeller  engine of 20 inch bore and 22 inch stroke, whose cylinder and valve gear  were recently designed by the writer, and are in process of construction  by Messrs. Valk & Murdoch, of Charleston, S.C.    In the principal features of the engine, taken as a whole, as will be  perceived, there is no new departure. The main slide valve, following  nearly full stroke, is of the ordinary form, and reversed by a shifting  link actuated by two eccentrics, in the usual manner; and the expansion  valves are of the well known Meyer type, consisting of two plates on the  back of the main valve, driven by a third eccentric, and connected by a  right and left handed screw, the turning of which alters the distance  between the plates and the point of cutting off.    The details of this mechanism, however, present several novel features,  of which the following description will be understood by reference to  the detached cuts, which are drawn upon a larger scale than the general  plan shown in Figs. 1 and 2.    [Illustration: Figs. 1-2 IMPROVED STEAM ENGINE.--BY PROF MACCORD.]    The first of these relates to the arrangement of the right and left  handed screw, above mentioned, and of the device by which it is rotated.    Usually, the threads, both right handed and left handed, are cut upon  the cut-off valve stem itself, which must be so connected with the  eccentric rod as to admit of being turned; and in most cases the valve  stem extends through both ends of the steam chest, so that it must both  slide endwise and turn upon its axis in two stuffing boxes, necessarily  of comparatively large size.    All this involves considerable friction, and in the engine under  consideration an attempt has been made to reduce the amount of this  friction, and to make the whole of this part of the gear neater and more  compact, in the following manner:    Two small valve stems are used, which are connected at their lower ends  by a crosstail actuated directly by the eccentric rod, and at their  upper ends by a transverse yoke. This yoke, filling snugly between two  collars formed upon a sleeve which it embraces, imparts a longitudinal  motion to the latter, while at the same time leaving it free to rotate.    This sleeve has cut upon it the right and left handed screws for  adjusting the cut-off valves; and it slides freely upon a central  spindle which has no longitudinal motion, but, projecting through the  upper end of the valve chest, can be turned at pleasure by means of a  bevel wheel and pinion. The rotation of the spindle is communicated to  the sleeve by means of two steel keys fixed in the body of the latter  and projecting inwardly so as to slide in corresponding longitudinal  grooves in the spindle.    Thus the point of cutting off is varied at will while the engine is  running, by means of the hand wheel on the horizontal axis of the bevel  pinion, and a small worm on the same axis turns the index, which points  out upon the dial the distance followed. These details are shown in  Figs. 3, 4, and 5; in further explanation of which it may be added that  Fig. 3 is a front view of the valve chest and its contents, the cover,  and also the balance plate for relieving the pressure on the back of the  main valve (in the arrangement of which there is nothing new), being  removed in order to show the valve stems, transverse yoke, sleeve, and  spindle above described. Fig. 4 is a longitudinal section, and Fig. 5 is  a transverse section, the right hand side showing the cylinder cut by a  plane through the middle of the exhaust port, the left hand side being a  section by a plane above, for the purpose of exhibiting more clearly the  manner in which the steam is admitted to the valve chest; the latter  having no pipes for this service, the steam enters below the valve, at  each end of the chest, just as it escapes in the center.    The second noteworthy feature consists in this: that the cut-off  eccentric is not keyed fast, as is customary when valve gear of this  kind is employed, but is loose upon the shaft, the angular position in  relation to the crank being changed when the engine is reversed; two  strong lugs are bolted on"]]]
