But whether the production of the  first device of this kind be claimed for England or for America, it is  quite certain that no one man invented the perfect machine, and that those  fine specimens of sewing apparatus shown here to-night embody the labors of  many earnest workers, both in Europe and America.    Most of us are familiar with the arrangements of an ordinary lock stitch  machine, and an able paper by Mr. Edwin P. Alexander, embracing not only a  good account of its history, but most of the elements of the earlier  machines, has already (April 5, 1863), been read before you. This, and  sundry descriptions of such apparatus in the engineering papers, confine my  remarks to the more recent improvements in three great classes of machines.  These are, briefly, plain sewing machines; sewing machines as used in  factories, where they are moved by steam power; and special sewing  machines, embracing many interesting forms, only recently introduced. We  have thus to consider, in the first place, the general efficiency of the  machine as a plain stitcher. Secondly, its adaptability to high rates of  speed, and the provision that has been made to withstand such velocities  for a reasonable time. And, thirdly, the apparatus and means employed to  effect the controlling of the motive power when applied to the machines.    To deal with the subject in this way must, I fear, involve a good deal of  technical description; and I hope to be pardoned if in attempting to  elucidate the more important devices, use must be made of words but seldom  heard outside of a machinists' workshop.    It appears scarcely necessary to premise that the sewing machine of twenty  years ago has almost faded away, save, perhaps, in general exterior  appearance; that the bell crank arms, the heart cams, the weaver's  shuttles, the spring \"take ups,\" rectangular needle bars, and gear wheels,  have developed into very different devices for performing the various  functions of those several parts.    The shuttle is perhaps the most important part of a lock stitch machine.  But what is a shuttle? So many devices for performing the functions of the  early weaver's shuttle have been introduced of late, that the word shuttle,  if it be used at all, must not be accepted as meaning \"to shoot.\" We have  vibrating shuttles, which are, strictly speaking, the only surviving  representatives of the weaver's shuttle in these new orders of machines;  and stationary shuttles, oscillating shuttles, and revolving shuttles,  besides the earlier rotating hook, in several new forms, difficult to name.  But the general acceptation of the word shuttle, as indicating those  devices that pass bodily through the loop of upper thread, is, I venture to  think, sufficiently correct.    Many changes have been effected in the form, size, and movements of the  shuttle, and we may profitably inquire into the causes that have induced  manufacturers to abandon the earlier forms. The long, weaver's kind of  shuttle, originally used by Howe and Singer, had many drawbacks. Mr. A.B.  Wilson's ingenious device, the lock stitch rotating hook, was not free from  corresponding faults. The removal of these in both has led to the adoption  of an entirely new class of both shuttles and revolving hooks. It is well  known that the lock stitch is formed by the crossing of two threads, one of  which lies over, and the other under, the cloth to be sewn. This crossing  point, to insure integrity of the stitch, must occur as nearly as possible  in the middle of the thickness of the fabric. The crossing must also be  effected while a certain strain, called tension, is imposed upon both  threads. If the tension of one thread should outweigh that of the other,  the locking point becomes displaced. If the tension be insignificant, the  stitches will be loose. If the tension should vary, as in the long shuttle,  there will occur faulty points in the seam.    In the earlier rotating hook the tension depended upon the friction  developed between the spool and the hook. This tension, therefore, varied  in proportion to the speed of the latter, and could never be constant. This  was quite apart from the frictional resistance offered to the upper thread  in passing over the cavity of the hook.    In the shuttle the tension was obtained by threading through holes in the  shell, or beneath a tension plate, as in Howe's machine. This tension, so  long as the reel ran between spring centers, was never constant. The  variation was chiefly due to the angular strain set up when unwinding from  the reel. This strain varied according to the point of unwinding. It was  light in the middle of the reel and heavy at either extremity. These  drawbacks caused immense anxiety to the first makers of sewing machines,  and numerous attempts to overcome them led to little improvement. With  reference to high rates of speed, the older shuttle, requiring a long and  noisy reciprocation, had its disadvantages.    The only effective remedy for these drawbacks was a radical one. It was  necessary to substitute depth of reel for length. Hence, several attempts  have been made to construct disk or ring shuttles. Many forms of those have  been tried. They all depend upon the principle of coiling up the thread in  a vertical plane, rather than in horizontal spirals. Some makers placed the  disk in a horizontal plane, and caused it to revolve. Nothing could be  worse, as will be seen, if we follow the course the enveloping loop must  take in encircling such a shuttle. But a complete solution of the  difficulty of employing a ring shuttle has been achieved in the oscillating  form, invented by Mr. Phil. Diehl, and known as Singer's (Fig. 1). A short  examination of it may profitably engage your attention. The shuttle itself  is sufficiently well known, but certain features of it, and to which it  owes its efficiency, appear to call for some explanation. Its introduction  dates back some years, during which time it has undergone certain  modifications.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    It consists of a thick disk bobbin of thread, _h_, fitting loosely in a  case constructed in the form of a bivalve, _a_ and _d_. This case is  furnished with a long beak, usually forming a continuation of the  periphery. The beak is intended to enter and detain the loops of upper  thread, and lead them so that they ultimately envelop the shuttle, a motion  of the thread which is chiefly due to the oscillation of the shuttle in a  vertical plane. The oscillating movement is to the extent of 180 degs. of  the circle, which suffices to cast the loops freely over the shuttle. The  center of oscillation is not coincident with the center of the shuttle; but  it is nearly so with the periphery of the thread reel, and exactly  coincides with the point where the under thread is drawn from the shuttle,  _g_. The shuttle thread is thus entirely freed from any tendency to twist,  an objection frequently urged against circular or revolving shuttles. It  will be observed, also, that the body of the shuttle is extremely narrow.  Bulging of the thread loops to one side or the other is thus obviated.    But the long beak in this description of shuttle serves an important  purpose other than that of seizing the upper thread loops, otherwise a very  short beak would be preferable. It adds so much to the efficiency of the  machine that a little further explanation of it appears essential. In the  old fashioned machines the thread required to envelop the shuttle was  dragged downward through the cloth, while the needle still remained in the  fabric. This necessitated the use of large needles with deep side channels,  to enable the thread to run freely, and as a consequence the punctures that  had to be made in the fabric were unnecessarily large, and could not in any  case be entirely filled by the thread, a condition which is now recognized  as essential in linen stitching and for waterproof boots.    The long beak in both shuttles and hooks offers an immediate solution of  the old difficulty experienced with long shuttles. When the needle begins  to rise, the shuttle commences to oscillate, through the loop, the motions  so coinciding that the long beak, c, merely detains the loop until the eye  of the needle has ascended above the cloth; then, and then only, does the  envelopment of the shuttle commence, and the thread required for it flows  downward through the puncture. The envelopment is completed before the  needle has attained its highest point, and the consequent loose thread is  immediately pulled up by a lever, called a positive take-up, before the  needle begins to descend for a fresh stitch. In this way little or no  movement of the thread is required in the cloth while the puncture made is  occupied by the needle. The result is the capability of such apparatus to  work with an incredibly fine needle--indeed, so fine as to be no thicker  than the incompressed thread itself. This would have been considered quite  impossible of accomplishment by our earlier machine makers. The advantage  thereby gained in stitching linen goods, and in sewing leather, where every  puncture of the needle should be quite filled by the thread, is at once  apparent. Indeed, a rubber or leather sack, stitched in this way, will  contain water without leakage--a very extreme test.    _Revolving Shuttles_.--The class of shuttles known as revolving or  rotating, and which really consist of a combination of the disk shuttle and  the earlier rotating hook of Wilson, have been under trial by several  makers for many years. If, for example, the oscillating shuttle we have  just examined were to complete its circular movement, it would constitute a  revolving shuttle, but would not be quite similar to those devices now  known as such. The most remarkable device of this kind yet introduced is to  be found in Wheeler & Wilson's machine known as No."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1167"],[0,"A Strange Disappearance (#7)"],[1," \"Pardon  me,\" said he, \"if it brings you sadness or unwelcome memories. I promise  you I will not so transgress again.\"    A wan smile crossed her lips grown suddenly pallid.    \"You mistake,\" said she; \"if my name brings up a past laden with bitter  memories and shadowed by regret, it also recalls much that is pleasant  and never to be forgotten. I do not object to hearing my girlhood's name  uttered--by my nearest relative.\"    The answer was dignity itself. \"Your name is Countess De Mirac, your  relatives must be proud to utter it.\"    A gleam not unlike the lightning's quick flash shot from the eyes she  drooped before him.    \"Is it Holman Blake I am listening to,\" said she; \"I do not recognize my  old friend in the cool and sarcastic man of the world now before me.\"    \"We often fail to recognize the work of our hands, madame, after it has  fallen from our grasp.\"    \"What,\" she cried, \"do you mean--would you say that--\"    \"I would say nothing,\" interrupted he calmly, stooping for the fan she  had dropped. \"At an interview which is at once a meeting and a parting,  I would give utterance to nothing which would seem like recrimination.  I--\"    \"Wait,\" suddenly exclaimed she, reaching out her hand for her fan with a  gesture lofty as it was resolute. \"You have spoken a word which demands  explanation; what have I ever done to you that you should speak the word  recrimination to me?\"    \"What? You shook my faith in womankind; you showed me that a woman who  had once told a man she loved him, could so far forget that love as to  marry one she could never respect, for the sake of titles and jewels.  You showed me--\"    \"Hold,\" said she again, this time without gesture or any movement, save  that of her lips grown pallid as marble, \"and what did you show me?\"    He started, colored profoundly, and for a moment stood before her  unmasked of his stern self-possession. \"I beg your pardon,\" said he, \"I  take back that word, recrimination.\"    It was now her turn to lift her head and survey him. With glance less  cool than his, but fully as deliberate, she looked at his proud head  bending before her; studying his face, line by line, from the stern brow  to the closely compressed lips on which melancholy seemed to have  set its everlasting seal, and a change passed over her countenance.  \"Holman,\" said she, with a sudden rush of tenderness, \"if in the times  gone by, we both behaved with too much worldly prudence for it now to be  any great pleasure for either of us to look back, is that any reason  why we should mar our whole future by dwelling too long upon what we are  surely still young enough to bury if not forget? I acknowledge that  I would have behaved in a more ideal fashion, if, after I had been  forsaken by you, I had turned my face from society, and let the  canker-worm of despair slowly destroy whatever life and bloom I had  left. But I was young, and society had its charms, so did the prospect  of wealth and position, however hollow they may have proved; you who  are the master of both this day, because twelve months ago you forsook  Evelyn Blake, should be the last to reproach me with them. I do not  reproach you; I only say let the past be forgotten--\"    \"Impossible,\" exclaimed he, his whole face darkening with an expression  I could not fathom. \"What was done at that time cannot be undone. For  you and me there is no future. Yes,\" he said turning towards her as she  made a slight fluttering move of dissent, \"no future; we can bury the  past, but we can not resurrect it. I doubt if you would wish to if we  could; as we cannot, of course you will not desire even to converse upon  the subject again. Evelyn I wanted to see you once, but I do not wish to  see you again; will you pardon my plain speaking, and release me?\"    \"I will pardon your plain speaking, but--\" Her look said she would not  release him.    He seemed to understand it so, and smiled, but very bitterly. In another  moment he had bowed and gone, and she had returned to her crowd of  adoring sycophants.        CHAPTER VI. A BIT OF CALICO      It was about this time that I took up my residence in a sort of  lodging-house that occupied the opposite corner to that of Mr. Blake.  My room, as I took pains to have it, overlooked the avenue, and from  its windows I could easily watch the goings and comings of the gentleman  whose movements were daily becoming of more and more interest to me.  For set it down to caprice--and men are often as capricious as women--or  account for it as you will, his restlessness at this period was truly  remarkable. Not a day that he did not spend his time in walking the  streets, and that not in his usual aimless gentlemanly fashion, but  eagerly and with an intent gaze that roamed here and there, like a bird  seeking its prey. It would often be as late as five o'clock before he  came in, and if, as now frequently happened, he did not have company to  dinner, he was even known to start out again after seven o'clock and go  over the same ground as in the morning, looking with strained gaze, that  vainly endeavored to appear unconcerned, into the faces of the women  that he passed. I not unfrequently followed him at these times as much  for my own amusement as from any hope I had of coming upon anything that  should aid me in the work before me. But when he suddenly changed his  route of travel from a promenade in the fashionable thoroughfares of  Broadway and Fourteenth Street to a walk through Chatham Square and the  dark, narrow streets of the East side, I began to scent whom the prey  might be that he was seeking, and putting every other consideration  aside, regularly set myself to dog his steps, as only I, with my  innumerable disguises, knew how to do. For three separate days I kept at  his heels wherever he went, each day growing more and more astonished  if not to say hopeful, as I found myself treading the narrowest and most  disreputable streets of the city; halting at the shops of pawnbrokers;  peering into the back-rooms of liquor shops; mixing with the crowds that  infest the corner groceries at nightfall, and even slinking with hand on  the trigger of the pistol I carried in my pocket, up dark alleys where  every door that swung noiselessly to and fro as we passed, shut upon  haunts of such villainy as only is known to us of the police, or to  those good souls that for the sake of One whose example they follow, lay  aside their fears and sensitiveness to carry light into the dim pits of  this wretched world. At first I thought Mr. Blake might have some such  reason for the peculiar course he took. But his indifference to all  crowds where only men were collected, his silence where a word would  have been well received, convinced me it was a woman he was seeking and  that with an intentness which blinded him to the commonest needs of the  hour. I even saw him once in his hurry and abstraction, step across the  body of a child who had fallen face downward on the stones, and that  with an expression showing he was utterly unconscious of anything but an  obstacle in his path. The strangest part of it all was that he seemed to  have no fear. To be sure he took pains to leave his watch at home; but  with such a figure and carriage as he possessed, the absence of jewelry  could never deceive the eye for a moment as to the fact of his being  a man of wealth, and those he went among would do anything for money.  Perhaps, like me, he carried a pistol. At all events he shunned no spot  where either poverty lay hid or deviltry reigned, his proud stern head  bending to enter the lowest doors without a tremble of the haughty lips  that remained compressed as by an iron force; except when some poor  forlorn creature with flaunting head-gear, and tremulous hands,  attracted by his bearing would hastily brush against him, when he would  turn and look, perhaps speak, though what he said I always failed to  catch; after which he would hurry on as if possessed by seven devils.  The evenings of those three days were notable also. Two of them he  spent in the manner I have described; the third he went to the Windsor  House--where the Countess De Mirac had taken rooms--going up to the  ladies' entrance and actually ringing the bell, only to start back and  walk up and down on the opposite side of the way, with his hands behind  his back, and his head bent, evidently deliberating as to whether he  should or should not carry out his original intention of entering. The  arrival of a carriage with the stately subject of his deliberations,  who from her elaborate costume had seemingly been to some kettledrum or  private reception, speedily put an end to his doubts. As the door opened  to admit her, I saw him cast one look at her heavily draped person, with  its snowy opera-cloak drawn tightly over the sweeping folds of her maize  colored silk, and shrink back with what sounded like a sigh of anger or  distrust, and without waiting for the closing of the door upon her, turn  toward home with a step that hesitated no longer.    The fourth day to my infinite chagrin, I was sick and could not go with  him. All I could do was to wrap myself in blankets and sit in my window  from which I had the satisfaction of viewing him start as I supposed  upon his usual course. The rest of the day was employed in a long,  dull waiting for his return, only relieved by casual glimpses of Mrs.  Daniels' troubled face as she appeared at one window or another of  the old-fashioned mansion before me. She seemed, too, to be unusually  restless, opening the windows and looking out with forlorn cranings of  her neck as if she too were watching for her master. Indeed I have  no doubt from what I afterwards learned, that she was in a state of  constant suspense during these days. Her frequent appearance at the  station house, where she in vain sought for some news of the girl in  whose fate she was so absorbed, confirmed this. Only the day before I"]]]
