Professor Haeckel's contribution to biology, in this case, was  exactly like Professor Harnack's contribution to ethnology. Professor  Harnack knows what a German is like. When he wants to imagine what an  Englishman is like, he simply photographs the same German over again. In  both cases there is probably sincerity as well as simplicity. Haeckel  was so certain that the species illustrated in embryo really are closely  related and linked up, that it seemed to him a small thing to simplify it  by mere repetition. Harnack is so certain that the German and Englishman  are almost alike, that he really risks the generalisation that they are  exactly alike. He photographs, so to speak, the same fair and foolish face  twice over; and calls it a remarkable resemblance between cousins. Thus, he  can prove the existence of Teutonism just about as conclusively as Haeckel  has proved the more tenable proposition of the non-existence of God.    Now the German and the Englishman are not in the least alike--except  in the sense that neither of them are negroes. They are, in everything  good and evil, more unlike than any other two men we can take at random  from the great European family. They are opposite from the roots of  their history, nay of their geography. It is an understatement to call  Britain insular. Britain is not only an island, but an island slashed by  the sea till it nearly splits into three islands; and even the Midlands  can almost smell the salt. Germany is a powerful, beautiful and fertile  inland country, which can only find the sea by one or two twisted and  narrow paths, as people find a subterranean lake. Thus the British Navy  is really national because it is natural; it has cohered out of hundreds  of accidental adventures of ships and shipmen before Chaucer's time and  after it. But the German Navy is an artificial thing; as artificial as a  constructed Alp would be in England. William II. has simply copied the  British Navy as Frederick II. copied the French Army: and this Japanese  or ant-like assiduity in imitation is one of the hundred qualities which  the Germans have and the English markedly have not. There are other German  superiorities which are very much superior.    The one or two really jolly things that the Germans have got are precisely  the things which the English haven't got: notably a real habit of popular  music and of the ancient songs of the people, not merely spreading from  the towns or caught from the professionals. In this the Germans rather  resemble the Welsh; though heaven knows what becomes of Teutonism if  they do. But the difference between the Germans and the English goes  deeper than all these signs of it; they differ more than any other two  Europeans in the normal posture of the mind. Above all, they differ in  what is the most English of all English traits; that shame which the  French may be right in calling \"the bad shame\"; for it is certainly mixed  up with pride and suspicion, the upshot of which we called shyness. Even  an Englishman's rudeness is often rooted in his being embarrassed. But  a German's rudeness is rooted in his never being embarrassed. He eats  and makes love noisily. He never feels a speech or a song or a sermon or  a large meal to be what the English call \"out of place\" in particular  circumstances. When Germans are patriotic and religious, they have no  reaction against patriotism and religion as have the English and the  French.    Nay, the mistake of Germany in the modern disaster largely arose from the  facts that she thought England was simple, when England is very subtle.  She thought that because our politics have become largely financial that  they had become wholly financial; that because our aristocrats had become  pretty cynical that they had become entirely corrupt. They could not seize  the subtlety by which a rather used-up English gentleman might sell a  coronet when he would not sell a fortress; might lower the public standards  and yet refuse to lower the flag.    In short, the Germans are quite sure that they understand us entirely,  because they do not understand us at all. Possibly if they began to  understand us they might hate us even more: but I would rather be hated for  some small but real reason, than pursued with love on account of all kinds  of qualities which I do not possess and which I do not desire. And when the  Germans get their first genuine glimpse of what modern England is like,  they will discover that England has a very broken, belated and inadequate  sense of having an obligation to Europe, but no sort of sense whatever of  having any obligation to Teutonism.    This is the last and strongest of the Prussian qualities we have here  considered. There is in stupidity of this sort a strange slippery  strength: because it can be not only outside rules but outside reason. The  man who really cannot see that he is contradicting himself has a great  advantage in controversy; though the advantage breaks down when he tries  to reduce it to simple addition, to chess, or to the game called war. It  is the same about the stupidity of the one-sided kinship. The drunkard who  is quite certain that a total stranger is his long-lost brother, has a  greater advantage until it comes to matters of detail. \"We must have chaos  within,\" said Nietzsche, \"that we may give birth to a dancing star.\"    In these slight notes I have suggested the principal strong points of  the Prussian character. A failure in honour which almost amounts to a  failure in memory: an egomania that is honestly blind to the fact that  the other party is an ego; and, above all, an actual itch for tyranny  and interference, the devil which everywhere torments the idle and the  proud. To these must be added a certain mental shapelessness which can  expand or contract without reference to reason or record; a potential  infinity of excuses. If the English had been on the German side, the  German professors would have noted what irresistible energies had evolved  the Teutons. As the English are on the other side, the German professors  will say that these Teutons were not sufficiently evolved. Or they will  say that they were just sufficiently evolved to show that they were not  Teutons. Probably they will say both. But the truth is that all that they  call evolution should rather be called evasion. They tell us they are  opening windows of enlightenment and doors of progress. The truth is that  they are breaking up the whole house of the human intellect, that they  may abscond in any direction. There is an ominous and almost monstrous  parallel between the position of their over-rated philosophers and of their  comparatively under-rated soldiers. For what their professors call roads of  progress are really routes of escape."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11565"],[0,"Friends, though divided: A Tale of the Civil War (#7)"],[1,"driven from the town. Many were taken prisoners,  and others driven into the river, the greater portion, however, making  their way in boats safely down the stream. The delay which their sturdy  resistance had made saved the city. Hampden was bringing his men across  from Acton. Essex had marched from Chelsea Fields to Turnham Green, and  the road was now blocked. After it was dark the Train-Bands advanced,  and the Parliament regiments, reinforced by them, pushed on to Brentford  again; the Royalists, finding that the place could not be held, fell  back to the king's quarters at Hounslow.    The chroniclers describe how wild a scene of confusion reigned in London  that evening. Proclamations were issued ordering all men to take up  arms; shops were closed, the apprentice boys mustered in the ranks, and  citizens poured out like one man to defend the town. They encamped upon  the road, and the next day great trains of provisions sent by the wives  of the merchants and traders reached them, and as many came out to see  the forces, the scene along the road resembled a great fair.    In this fight at Brentford Harry Furness was engaged. The Royalists had  anticipated no resistance here, not knowing that Hollis held the place,  and Sir Henry did not think of ordering Harry to remain behind. At the  moment when it was found that Hollis was in force and the trumpets  sounded the charge, the lad was riding in the rear of the troop, talking  to one of the officers, and his father could take no step to prevent his  joining. Therefore, when the trumpets sounded and the troops started off  at full gallop toward the town, Harry, greatly exulting in his good  luck, fell in with them and rode down the streets of Brentford. The  musketry fire was brisk, and many of the troop rolled from their horses.  Presently they were dismounted and ordered to take the houses by storm.  With the hilts of their swords they broke in the doors, and there was  fierce lighting within.    Harry, who was rather bewildered with the din and turmoil of the fight,  did as the rest, and followed two or three of the men into one of the  houses, whose door had been broken open. They were assailed as they  entered by a fire of musketry from the Parliament men within. Those in  front fell, and Harry was knocked down by the butt of a pike.    When he recovered he found himself in a boat drifting down the stream, a  prisoner of the Roundheads.    For a long time Harry could hear the sounds of the guns and cannon at  Brentford, and looking round at the quiet villages which they passed on  the banks, could scarce believe that he had been engaged in a battle and  was now a prisoner. But little was said to him. The men were smarting  under their defeat and indulged in the bitterest language at the  treachery with which, after negotiations had been agreed upon, the  advance of the Royalists had been made. They speedily discovered the  youth of their captive, and, after telling him brutally that he would  probably be hung when he got to London, they paid no further attention  to him. The boat was heavily laden, and rowed by two oars, and the  journey down was a long one, for the tide met them when at the village  of Hammersmith, and they were forced to remain tied up to a tree by the  bank until it turned again. This it did not do until far in the night,  and the morning was just breaking when they reached London.    It was perhaps well for Harry that they arrived in the dark, for in the  excited state of the temper of the citizens, and their anger at the  treachery which had been practiced, it might have fared but badly with  him. He was marched along the Strand to the city, and was consigned to a  lock-up in Finsbury, until it could be settled what should be done to  him. In fact, the next day his career was nearly being terminated, for  John Lilburn, a captain of the Train Bands, who had been an apprentice  and imprisoned for contumacy, had been captured at Brentford, and after  being tried for his life, was sentenced to death as a rebel. Essex,  however, sent in word to the Royalist camp that for every one of the  Parliament officers put to death, he would hang three Royalist  prisoners. This threat had its effect, and Harry remained in ignorance  of the danger which had threatened him.    The greatest inconvenience which befell him was that he was obliged to  listen to all sorts of long harangues upon the part of the Puritan  soldiers who were his jailers. These treated him as a misguided lad, and  did their best to convert him from the evil of his ways. At last Harry  lost his temper, and said that if they wanted to hang him, they might;  but that he would rather put up with that than the long sermons which  they were in the habit of delivering to him. Indignant at this rejection  of their good offices, they left him to himself, and days passed without  his receiving any visit save that of the soldier who brought his meals.          CHAPTER IV.    BREAKING PRISON.      Harry's place of confinement was a cell leading off a guardroom of the  Train Bands. Occasionally the door was left open, as some five or six  men were always there, and Harry could see through the open door the  citizens of London training at arms. Several preachers were in the habit  of coming each day to discourse to those on guard, and so while away the  time, and upon these occasions the door was generally left open, in  order that the prisoner might be edified by the sermons. Upon one  occasion the preacher, a small, sallow-visaged man, looked into the cell  at the termination of his discourse, and seeing Harry asleep on his  truckle bed, awoke him, and lectured him severely on the wickedness of  allowing such precious opportunities to pass. After this he made a point  of coming in each day when he had addressed the guard, and of offering  up a long and very tedious prayer on behalf of the young reprobate.  These preachings and prayings nearly drove Harry out of his mind.  Confinement was bad enough; but confinement tempered by a course of  continual sermons, delivered mostly through the nose, was a terrible  infliction. At last the thought presented itself to him that he might  manage to effect his escape in the garb of the preacher. He thought the  details over and over in his mind, and at last determined at any rate to  attempt to carry them into execution.    One day he noticed, when the door opened for the entry of the preacher,  that a parade of unusual magnitude was being held in the drill yard,  some officer of importance having come down to inspect the Train Band.  There were but four men left in the guardroom and these were occupied in  gazing out of the window. The preacher came direct into the cell, as his  audience in the guardroom for once were not disposed to listen to him,  and shutting the door behind him, he addressed a few words of  exhortation to Harry, and then, closing his eyes, began a long prayer.  When he was fairly under way, Harry sprang upon him, grasping him by the  throat with both hands, and forced him back upon the bed. The little  preacher was too much surprised to offer the smallest resistance, and  Harry, who had drawn out the cords used in supporting the sacking of the  bed, bound him hand and foot, keeping, while he did so, the pillow  across his face, and his weight on the top of the pillow, thereby nearly  putting a stop to the preacher's prayers and exhortations for all time.  Having safely bound him, and finding that he did not struggle in the  least, Harry removed the pillow, and was horrified to see his prisoner  black in the face. He had, however, no time for regret or inquiry how  far the man had gone, and stuffing a handkerchief into his mouth, to  prevent his giving any alarm should he recover breath enough to do so,  Harry placed his high steeple hat upon his head, his Geneva bands round  his throat, and his long black mantle over his shoulders. He then opened  the door and walked quietly forth. The guards were too much occupied  with the proceedings in the parade ground to do more than glance round,  as the apparent preacher departed. Harry strode with a long and very  stiff step, and with his figure bolt upright, to the gate of the parade  ground, and then passing through the crowd who were standing there  gaping at the proceedings within, he issued forth a free man.    For awhile he walked at a brisk pace, and then, feeling secure from  pursuit, slackened his speed; keeping westward through the city, he  passed along the Strand and out into the country beyond. He wore his  beaver well down over his eyes, and walked with his head down as if  meditating deeply, in order to prevent any passers-by from observing the  youthfulness of his face. When he arrived at the village of Chelsea, he  saw, in front of a gentleman's house, a horse hitched up to a hook  placed there for that purpose. Conceiving that for a long journey four  legs are much more useful than two, and that when he got beyond the  confines of London he should attract less suspicion upon a horse than if  striding alone along the road, he took the liberty of mounting it and  riding off. When he had gone a short distance he heard loud shouts; but  thinking these in no way to concern him, he rode on the faster, and was  soon beyond the sound of the voices. He now took a northerly direction,  traveled through Kensington, and then keeping east of Acton, where he  knew that some Parliament troops were quartered, he rode for the village  of Harrow. He was aware that the Royalists had fallen back to Oxford,  and that the Parliament troops were at Reading. He therefore made to the  northwest, intending to circuit round and so reach Oxford. He did not  venture to go to an inn, for although, as a rule, the keepers of these  places were, being jovial men, in no way affected toward the Commons,  yet he feared meeting there persons who might question and detain him.  He obtained some"]]]
