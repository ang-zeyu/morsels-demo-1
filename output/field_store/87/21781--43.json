What that is, at present, I do  not exactly know. However. Excursion trains will be run from distant  shires to see this Postage Department. American visitors to London will  do it before going on to the Tower. And now,' he broke off, with a  crisp, businesslike intonation, 'I must ask you to excuse me. Much as I  have enjoyed this little chat, I fear it must now cease. The time has  come to work. Our trade rivals are getting ahead of us. The whisper  goes round, \"Rossiter and Psmith are talking, not working,\" and other  firms prepare to pinch our business. Let me Work.'    Two minutes later, Mr Rossiter was sitting at his desk with a dazed  expression, while Psmith, perched gracefully on a stool, entered  figures in a ledger.          6. Psmith Explains      For the space of about twenty-five minutes Psmith sat in silence,  concentrated on his ledger, the picture of the model bank-clerk. Then  he flung down his pen, slid from his stool with a satisfied sigh, and  dusted his waistcoat. 'A commercial crisis,' he said, 'has passed. The  job of work which Comrade Rossiter indicated for me has been completed  with masterly skill. The period of anxiety is over. The bank ceases to  totter. Are you busy, Comrade Jackson, or shall we chat awhile?'    Mike was not busy. He had worked off the last batch of letters, and  there was nothing to do but to wait for the next, or--happy thought--to  take the present batch down to the post, and so get out into the  sunshine and fresh air for a short time. 'I rather think I'll nip down  to the post-office,' said he, 'You couldn't come too, I suppose?'    'On the contrary,' said Psmith, 'I could, and will. A stroll will just  restore those tissues which the gruelling work of the last half-hour  has wasted away. It is a fearful strain, this commercial toil. Let us  trickle towards the post office. I will leave my hat and gloves as a  guarantee of good faith. The cry will go round, \"Psmith has gone! Some  rival institution has kidnapped him!\" Then they will see my hat,'--he  built up a foundation of ledgers, planted a long ruler in the middle,  and hung his hat on it--'my gloves,'--he stuck two pens into the desk  and hung a lavender glove on each--'and they will sink back swooning  with relief. The awful suspense will be over. They will say, \"No, he  has not gone permanently. Psmith will return. When the fields are white  with daisies he'll return.\" And now, Comrade Jackson, lead me to this  picturesque little post-office of yours of which I have heard so much.'    Mike picked up the long basket into which he had thrown the letters  after entering the addresses in his ledger, and they moved off down the  aisle. No movement came from Mr Rossiter's lair. Its energetic occupant  was hard at work. They could just see part of his hunched-up back.    'I wish Comrade Downing could see us now,' said Psmith. 'He always set  us down as mere idlers. Triflers. Butterflies. It would be a wholesome  corrective for him to watch us perspiring like this in the cause of  Commerce.'    'You haven't told me yet what on earth you're doing here,' said Mike.  'I thought you were going to the 'Varsity. Why the dickens are you in a  bank? Your pater hasn't lost his money, has he?'    'No. There is still a tolerable supply of doubloons in the old oak  chest. Mine is a painful story.'    'It always is,' said Mike.    'You are very right, Comrade Jackson. I am the victim of Fate. Ah, so  you put the little chaps in there, do you?' he said, as Mike, reaching  the post-office, began to bundle the letters into the box. 'You seem to  have grasped your duties with admirable promptitude. It is the same  with me. I fancy we are both born men of Commerce. In a few years we  shall be pinching Comrade Bickersdyke's job. And talking of Comrade B.  brings me back to my painful story. But I shall never have time to tell  it to you during our walk back. Let us drift aside into this tea-shop.  We can order a buckwheat cake or a butter-nut, or something equally  succulent, and carefully refraining from consuming these dainties, I  will tell you all.'    'Right O!' said Mike.    'When last I saw you,' resumed Psmith, hanging Mike's basket on the  hat-stand and ordering two portions of porridge, 'you may remember that  a serious crisis in my affairs had arrived. My father inflamed with the  idea of Commerce had invited Comrade Bickersdyke--'    'When did you know he was a manager here?' asked Mike.    'At an early date. I have my spies everywhere. However, my pater  invited Comrade Bickersdyke to our house for the weekend. Things turned  out rather unfortunately. Comrade B. resented my purely altruistic  efforts to improve him mentally and morally. Indeed, on one occasion he  went so far as to call me an impudent young cub, and to add that he  wished he had me under him in his bank, where, he asserted, he would  knock some of the nonsense out of me. All very painful. I tell you,  Comrade Jackson, for the moment it reduced my delicately vibrating  ganglions to a mere frazzle. Recovering myself, I made a few blithe  remarks, and we then parted. I cannot say that we parted friends, but  at any rate I bore him no ill-will. I was still determined to make him  a credit to me. My feelings towards him were those of some kindly  father to his prodigal son. But he, if I may say so, was fairly on the  hop. And when my pater, after dinner the same night, played into his  hands by mentioning that he thought I ought to plunge into a career of  commerce, Comrade B. was, I gather, all over him. Offered to make a  vacancy for me in the bank, and to take me on at once. My pater,  feeling that this was the real hustle which he admired so much, had me  in, stated his case, and said, in effect, \"How do we go?\" I intimated  that Comrade Bickersdyke was my greatest chum on earth. So the thing  was fixed up and here I am. But you are not getting on with your  porridge, Comrade Jackson. Perhaps you don't care for porridge? Would  you like a finnan haddock, instead? Or a piece of shortbread? You have  only to say the word.'    'It seems to me,' said Mike gloomily, 'that we are in for a pretty  rotten time of it in this bally bank. If Bickersdyke's got his knife  into us, he can make it jolly warm for us. He's got his knife into me  all right about that walking-across-the-screen business.'    'True,' said Psmith, 'to a certain extent. It is an undoubted fact that  Comrade Bickersdyke will have a jolly good try at making life a  nuisance to us; but, on the other hand, I propose, so far as in me  lies, to make things moderately unrestful for him, here and there.'    'But you can't,' objected Mike. 'What I mean to say is, it isn't like a  school. If you wanted to score off a master at school, you could always  rag and so on. But here you can't. How can you rag a man who's sitting  all day in a room of his own while you're sweating away at a desk at  the other end of the building?'    'You put the case with admirable clearness, Comrade Jackson,' said  Psmith approvingly. 'At the hard-headed, common-sense business you  sneak the biscuit every time with ridiculous ease. But you do not know  all. I do not propose to do a thing in the bank except work. I shall be  a model as far as work goes. I shall be flawless. I shall bound to do  Comrade Rossiter's bidding like a highly trained performing dog. It is  outside the bank, when I have staggered away dazed with toil, that I  shall resume my attention to the education of Comrade Bickersdyke.'    'But, dash it all, how can you? You won't see him. He'll go off home,  or to his club, or--'    Psmith tapped him earnestly on the chest.    'There, Comrade Jackson,' he said, 'you have hit the bull's-eye, rung  the bell, and gathered in the cigar or cocoanut according to choice. He  _will_ go off to his club. And I shall do precisely the same.'    'How do you mean?'    'It is this way. My father, as you may have noticed during your stay at  our stately home of England, is a man of a warm, impulsive character.  He does not always do things as other people would do them. He has his  own methods. Thus, he has sent me into the City to do the hard-working,  bank-clerk act, but at the same time he is allowing me just as large an  allowance as he would have given me if I had gone to the 'Varsity.  Moreover, while I was still at Eton he put my name up for his clubs,  the Senior Conservative among others. My pater belongs to four  clubs altogether, and in course of time, when my name comes up for  election, I shall do the same. Meanwhile, I belong to one, the Senior  Conservative. It is a bigger club than the others, and your name comes  up for election sooner. About the middle of last month a great yell of  joy made the West End of London shake like a jelly. The three thousand  members of the Senior Conservative had just learned that I had been  elected.'    Psmith paused, and ate some porridge.    'I wonder why they call this porridge,' he observed with mild interest.  'It would be far more manly and straightforward of them to give it its  real name. To resume. I have gleaned, from casual chit-chat with my  father, that Comrade Bickersdyke also infests the Senior Conservative.  You might think that that would make me, seeing how particular I am  about whom I mix with, avoid the club. Error. I shall go there every  day. If Comrade Bickersdyke wishes to emend any little traits in my  character of which he may disapprove, he shall never say that I did not  give him the opportunity. I shall mix freely with Comrade Bickersdyke  at the Senior Conservative Club. I shall be his constant companion. I  shall, in short, haunt the man. By these strenuous means I shall, as it  were, get a bit of my own back. And now,' said Psmith, rising, 'it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6762"],[0,"Politics: A Treatise on Government (#6)"],[1," which reason  a mutual utility and friendship may subsist between the master and the  slave, I mean when they are placed by nature in that relation to each  other, for the contrary takes place amongst those who are reduced to  slavery by the law, or by conquest.          CHAPTER VII      It is evident from what has been said, that a herile and a political  government are not the same, or that all governments are alike to each  other, as some affirm; for one is adapted to the nature of freemen, the  other to that of slaves. Domestic government is a monarchy, for that is  what prevails in every house; but a political state is the government of  free men and equals. The master is not so called from his knowing how to  manage his slave, but because he is so; for the same reason a slave and  a freeman have their respective appellations. There is also one sort of  knowledge proper for a master, another for a slave; the slave's is of  the nature of that which was taught by a slave at Syracuse; for he for  a stipulated sum instructed the boys in all the business of a household  slave, of which there are various sorts to be learnt, as the art of  cookery, and other such-like services, of which some are allotted to  some, and others to others; some employments being more honourable,  others more necessary; according to the proverb, \"One slave excels  another, one master excels another:\" in such-like things the knowledge  of a slave consists. The knowledge of the master is to be able properly  to employ his slaves, for the mastership of slaves is the employment,  not the mere possession of them; not that this knowledge contains  anything great or respectable; for what a slave ought to know how to do,  that a master ought to know how to order; for which reason, those who  have it in their power to be free from these low attentions, employ a  steward for this business, and apply themselves either to public affairs  or philosophy: the knowledge of procuring what is necessary for a family  is different from that which belongs either to the master or the slave:  and to do this justly must be either by war or hunting. And thus much of  the difference between a master and a slave.          CHAPTER VIII      [1256a] As a slave is a particular species of property, let us by  all means inquire into the nature of property in general, and the  acquisition of money, according to the manner we have proposed. In the  first place then, some one may doubt whether the getting of money is  the same thing as economy, or whether it is a part of it, or something  subservient to it; and if so, whether it is as the art of making  shuttles is to the art of weaving, or the art of making brass to that  of statue founding, for they are not of the same service; for the one  supplies the tools, the other the matter: by the matter I mean the  subject out of which the work is finished, as wool for the cloth and  brass for the statue. It is evident then that the getting of money is  not the same thing as economy, for the business of the one is to furnish  the means of the other to use them; and what art is there employed in  the management of a family but economy, but whether this is a part of  it, or something of a different species, is a doubt; for if it is  the business of him who is to get money to find out how riches and  possessions may be procured, and both these arise from various  causes, we must first inquire whether the art of husbandry is part of  money-getting or something different, and in general, whether the same  is not true of every acquisition and every attention which relates to  provision. But as there are many sorts of provision, so are the methods  of living both of man and the brute creation very various; and as it is  impossible to live without food, the difference in that particular makes  the lives of animals so different from each other. Of beasts, some  live in herds, others separate, as is most convenient for procuring  themselves food; as some of them live upon flesh, others on fruit, and  others on whatsoever they light on, nature having so distinguished  their course of life, that they can very easily procure themselves  subsistence; and as the same things are not agreeable to all, but one  animal likes one thing and another another, it follows that the lives  of those beasts who live upon flesh must be different from the lives of  those who live on fruits; so is it with men, their lives differ greatly  from each other; and of all these the shepherd's is the idlest, for they  live upon the flesh of tame animals, without any trouble, while they are  obliged to change their habitations on account of their flocks, which  they are compelled to follow, cultivating, as it were, a living farm.  Others live exercising violence over living creatures, one pursuing this  thing, another that, these preying upon men; those who live near lakes  and marshes and rivers, or the sea itself, on fishing, while others are  fowlers, or hunters of wild beasts; but the greater part of mankind live  upon the produce of the earth and its cultivated fruits; and the manner  in which all those live who follow the direction of nature, and labour  for their own subsistence, is nearly the same, without ever thinking  to procure any provision by way of exchange or merchandise, such are  shepherds, husband-men, [1256b] robbers, fishermen, and hunters: some  join different employments together, and thus live very agreeably;  supplying those deficiencies which were wanting to make their  subsistence depend upon themselves only: thus, for instance, the same  person shall be a shepherd and a robber, or a husbandman and a hunter;  and so with respect to the rest, they pursue that mode of life which  necessity points out. This provision then nature herself seems to have  furnished all animals with, as well immediately upon their first origin  as also when they are arrived at a state of maturity; for at the first  of these periods some of them are provided in the womb with proper  nourishment, which continues till that which is born can get food for  itself, as is the case with worms and birds; and as to those which bring  forth their young alive, they have the means for their subsistence for a  certain time within themselves, namely milk. It is evident then that we  may conclude of those things that are, that plants are created for the  sake of animals, and animals for the sake of men; the tame for our use  and provision; the wild, at least the greater part, for our provision  also, or for some other advantageous purpose, as furnishing us with  clothes, and the like. As nature therefore makes nothing either  imperfect or in vain, it necessarily follows that she has made all these  things for men: for which reason what we gain in war is in a certain  degree a natural acquisition; for hunting is a part of it, which it is  necessary for us to employ against wild beasts; and those men who being  intended by nature for slavery are unwilling to submit to it, on which  occasion such a. war is by nature just: that species of acquisition then  only which is according to nature is part of economy; and this ought to  be at hand, or if not, immediately procured, namely, what is necessary  to be kept in store to live upon, and which are useful as well for the  state as the family. And true riches seem to consist in these; and the  acquisition of those possessions which are necessary for a happy life is  not infinite; though Solon says otherwise in this verse:      \"No bounds to riches can be fixed for man;\"    for they may be fixed as in other arts; for the instruments of no art  whatsoever are infinite, either in their number or their magnitude; but  riches are a number of instruments in domestic and civil economy; it is  therefore evident that the acquisition of certain things according  to nature is a part both of domestic and civil economy, and for what  reason.          CHAPTER IX      There is also another species of acquisition which they [1257a]  particularly call pecuniary, and with great propriety; and by this  indeed it seems that there are no bounds to riches and wealth. Now many  persons suppose, from their near relation to each other, that this is  one and the same with that we have just mentioned, but it is not the  same as that, though not very different; one of these is natural, the  other is not, but rather owing to some art and skill; we will enter into  a particular examination of this subject. The uses of every possession  are two, both dependent upon the thing itself, but not in the same  manner, the one supposing an inseparable connection with it, the other  not; as a shoe, for instance, which may be either worn, or exchanged  for something else, both these are the uses of the shoe; for he who  exchanges a shoe with some man who wants one, for money or provisions,  uses the shoe as a shoe, but not according to the original intention,  for shoes were not at first made to be exchanged. The same thing holds  true of all other possessions; for barter, in general, had its original  beginning in nature, some men having a surplus, others too little of  what was necessary for them: hence it is evident, that the selling  provisions for money is not according to the natural use of things; for  they were obliged to use barter for those things which they wanted; but  it is plain that barter could have no place in the first, that is to  say, in family society; but must have begun when the number of those  who composed the community was enlarged: for the first of these had all  things in common; but when they came to be separated they were obliged  to exchange with each other many different things which both parties  wanted. Which custom of barter is still preserved amongst many barbarous  nations, who procure one necessary with another, but never sell  anything; as giving and receiving wine for corn and the like. This  sort of barter is not contradictory to"]]]
