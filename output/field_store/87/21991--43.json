The quick eye of the whaleman saw at  a glance that the effort to back out was hopeless. He bent his head, and  the next moment was deep down in the waves. Just as he disappeared the  flukes descended on the spot which he had left, and cut the bow of the  boat completely away, sending the stern high into the air with a  violence that tossed men, and oars, and shattered planks, and cordage,  flying over the monster's back into the seething caldron of foam around  it. It was apparently a scene of the most complete and instantaneous  destruction, yet, strange to say, not a man was lost. A few seconds  after, the white foam of the sea was dotted with black heads as the men  rose one by one to the surface, and struck out for floating oars and  pieces of the wrecked boat.    \"They're lost!\" cried Fred Ellice in a voice of horror.    \"Not a bit of it, youngster; they're safe enough, I'll warrant,\" replied  the captain, as his own boat flew past the spot, towed by the  whale.--\"Pay out, Amos Parr; give him line, or he'll tear the bows out  of us.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir,\" sang out Amos, as he sat coolly pouring water on the  loggerhead round which a coil of the rope was whizzing like lightning;  \"all right. The mate's men are all safe, sir; I counted them as we shot  past, and I seed Buzzby come up last of all, blowin' like a grampus; and  small wonder, considerin' the dive he took.\"    \"Take another turn of the coil, Amos, and hold on,\" said the captain.    The harpooner obeyed, and away they went after the whale like a rocket,  with a tremendous strain on the line and a bank of white foam gurgling  up to the edge of the gunwale, that every moment threatened to fill the  boat and sink her. Such a catastrophe is of not unfrequent occurrence,  when whalemen thus towed by a whale are tempted to hold on too long; and  many instances have happened of boats and their crews being in this way  dragged under water and lost. Fortunately the whale dashed horizontally  through the water, so that the boat was able to hold on and follow, and  in a short time the creature paused and rose for air. Again the men bent  to their oars, and the rope was hauled in until they came quite close to  the fish. This time a harpoon was thrown and a deep lance-thrust given  which penetrated to the vital parts of its huge carcass, as was  evidenced by the blood which it spouted and the convulsive lashing of  its tremendous tail.    While the captain's crew were thus engaged, Saunders, the second mate,  observing from the ship the accident to the first mate's boat, sent off  a party of men to the rescue, thus setting free the third boat, which  was steered by a strapping fellow named Peter Grim, to follow up the  chase. Peter Grim was the ship's carpenter, and he took after his name.  He was, as the sailors expressed it, a \"grim customer,\" being burnt by  the sun to a deep rich brown colour, besides being covered nearly up to  the eyes with a thick coal-black beard and moustache, which completely  concealed every part of his visage except his prominent nose and dark,  fiery-looking eyes. He was an immense man, the largest in the ship,  probably, if we except the Scotch second mate Saunders, to whom he was  about equal in all respects--except argument. Like most big men, he was  peaceable and good-humoured.    \"Look alive now, lads,\" said Grim, as the men pulled towards the whale;  \"we'll get a chance yet, we shall, if you give way like tigers. Split  your sides, boys--do--that's it. Ah! there she goes right down. Pull  away now, and be ready when she rises.\"    As he spoke the whale suddenly _sounded_--that is, went perpendicularly  down, as it had done when first struck--and continued to descend until  most of the line in the captain's boat was run out.    \"Hoist an oar!\" cried Amos Parr, as he saw the coil diminishing. Grim  observed the signal of distress, and encouraged his men to use their  utmost exertions. \"Another oar!--another!\" shouted Parr, as the whale  continued its headlong descent.    \"Stand by to cut the line,\" said Captain Guy with compressed lips. \"No!  hold on, hold on!\"    At this moment, having drawn down more than a thousand fathoms of rope,  the whale slackened its speed, and Parr, taking another coil round the  loggerhead, held on until the boat was almost dragged under water. Then  the line became loose, and the slack was hauled in rapidly. Meanwhile  Grim's boat had reached the spot, and the men now lay on their oars at  some distance ahead, ready to pull the instant the whale should show  itself. Up it came, not twenty yards ahead. One short, energetic pull,  and the second boat sent a harpoon deep into it, while Grim sprang to  the bow and thrust a lance with deadly force deep into the carcass. The  monster sent up a stream of mingled blood, oil, and water, and whirled  its huge tail so violently that the sound could be heard a mile off.  Before it dived again, the captain's boat came up, and succeeded in  making fast another harpoon, while several additional lance-thrusts were  given with effect, and it seemed as if the battle were about to  terminate, when suddenly the whale struck the sea with a clap like  thunder, and darted away once more like a rocket to windward, tearing  the two boats after it as if they had been egg-shells.    Meanwhile a change had come over the scene. The sun had set, red and  lowering, behind a bank of dark clouds, and there was every appearance  of stormy weather; but as yet it was nearly calm, and the ship was  unable to beat up against the light breeze in the wake of the two boats,  which were soon far away on the horizon. Then a furious gust arose and  passed away, a dark cloud covered the sky as night fell, and soon boats  and whale were utterly lost to view.    \"Wae's me!\" cried the big Scotch mate, as he ran up and down the  quarter-deck wringing his hands, \"what _is_ to be done noo?\"    Saunders spoke a mongrel kind of language--a mixture of Scotch and  English--in which, although the Scotch words were sparsely scattered,  the Scotch accent was very strong.    \"How's her head?\"    \"Nor'-nor'-west, sir.\"    \"Keep her there, then. Maybe, if the wind holds stiddy, we may overhaul  them before it's quite dark.\"    Although Saunders was really in a state of the utmost consternation at  this unexpected termination to the whale-hunt, and expressed the  agitation of his feelings pretty freely, he was too thorough a seaman to  neglect anything that was necessary to be done under the circumstances.  He took the exact bearings of the point at which the boats had  disappeared, and during the night, which turned out gusty and  threatening, kept making short tacks, while lanterns were hung at the  mast-heads, and a huge torch, or rather a small bonfire, of tarred  materials was slung at the end of a spar and thrust out over the stern  of the ship. But for many hours there was no sign of the boats, and the  crew of the _Dolphin_ began to entertain the most gloomy forebodings  regarding them.    At length, towards morning, a small speck of light was noticed on the  weather-beam. It flickered for a moment, and then disappeared.    \"Did ye see yon?\" said Saunders to Mivins in an agitated whisper, laying  his huge hand on the shoulder of that worthy. \"Down your helm\" (to the  steersman).    \"Ay, ay, sir!\"    \"Stiddy!\"    \"Steady it is, sir.\"    Mivins's face, which for some hours had worn an expression of deep  anxiety, relaxed into a bland smile, and he smote his thigh powerfully,  as he exclaimed, \"That's them, sir, _and_ no mistake! What's your  opinion, Mr. Saunders?\"    The second mate peered earnestly in the direction in which the light had  been seen; and Mivins, turning in the same direction, screwed up his  visage into a knot of earnest attention so complicated and intense, that  it seemed as if no human power could evermore unravel it.    \"There it goes again!\" cried Saunders, as the light flashed distinctly  over the sea.    \"Down helm; back fore-top-sails!\" he shouted, springing forward; \"lower  away the boat there!\"    In a few seconds the ship was hove to, and a boat, with a lantern fixed  to an oar, was plunging over the swell in the direction of the light.  Sooner than was expected they came up with it, and a hurrah in the  distance told that all was right.    \"Here we are, thank God,\" cried Captain Guy, \"safe and sound. We don't  require assistance, Mr. Saunders; pull for the ship.\"    A short pull sufficed to bring the three boats alongside, and in a few  seconds more the crew were congratulating their comrades with that  mingled feeling of deep heartiness and a disposition to jest which is  characteristic of men who are used to danger, and think lightly of it  after it is over.    \"We've lost our fish, however,\" remarked Captain Guy, as he passed the  crew on his way to the cabin; \"but we must hope for better luck next  time.\"    \"Well, well,\" said one of the men, wringing the water out of his wet  clothes as he walked forward, \"we got a good laugh at Peter Grim, if we  got nothin' else by our trip.\"    \"How was that, Jack?\"    \"Why, ye see, jist before the whale gave in, it sent up a spout o' blood  and oil as thick as the main-mast, and, as luck would have it, down it  came slap on the head of Grim, drenchin' him from head to foot, and  makin' him as red as a lobster.\"    \"'Ow did you lose the fish, sir?\" inquired Mivins, as our hero sprang up  the side, followed by Singleton.    \"Lost him as men lose money in railway speculations now-a-days. We  _sank_ him, and that was the last of it. After he had towed us I don't  know how far--out of sight of the ship at any rate--he suddenly stopped,  and we pulled up and gave him some tremendous digs with the lances,  until he spouted jets of blood, and we made sure of him, when all at  once down he went head-foremost like a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11615"],[0,"The Grammar of English Grammars (#7)"],[1,"ammar; 12mo, London, 2d Ed., 1838.
