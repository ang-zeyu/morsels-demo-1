Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#6)"],[1,"slowly down past  the different floors, discharging and taking in passengers just as in  a large hotel. I wonder where the lift-boy was that night. I would  have been glad to find him in our boat, or on the Carpathia when we  took count of the saved. He was quite young,--not more than sixteen, I  think,--a bright-eyed, handsome boy, with a love for the sea and the  games on deck and the view over the ocean--and he did not get any of  them. One day, as he put me out of his lift and saw through the  vestibule windows a game of deck quoits in progress, he said, in a  wistful tone, \"My! I wish I could go out there sometimes!\" I wished he  could, too, and made a jesting offer to take charge of his lift for an  hour while he went out to watch the game; but he smilingly shook his  head and dropped down in answer to an imperative ring from below. I  think he was not on duty with his lift after the collision, but if he  were, he would smile at his passengers all the time as he took them up  to the boats waiting to leave the sinking ship.    After undressing and climbing into the top berth, I read from about  quarter-past eleven to the time we struck, about quarter to twelve.  During this time I noticed particularly the increased vibration of the  ship, and I assumed that we were going at a higher speed than at any  other time since we sailed from Queenstown. Now I am aware that this  is an important point, and bears strongly on the question of  responsibility for the effects of the collision; but the impression of  increased vibration is fixed in my memory so strongly that it seems  important to record it. Two things led me to this conclusion--first,  that as I sat on the sofa undressing, with bare feet on the floor, the  jar of the vibration came up from the engines below very noticeably;  and second, that as I sat up in the berth reading, the spring mattress  supporting me was vibrating more rapidly than usual: this cradle-like  motion was always noticeable as one lay in bed, but that night there  was certainly a marked increase in the motion. Referring to the plan,  [Footnote: See Figure 2, page 116.] it will be seen that the vibration  must have come almost directly up from below, when it is mentioned  that the saloon was immediately above the engines as shown in the  plan, and my cabin next to the saloon. From these two data, on the  assumption that greater vibration is an indication of higher  speed,--and I suppose it must be,--then I am sure we were going faster  that night at the time we struck the iceberg than we had done before,  i.e., during the hours I was awake and able to take note of anything.    And then, as I read in the quietness of the night, broken only by the  muffled sound that came to me through the ventilators of stewards  talking and moving along the corridors, when nearly all the passengers  were in their cabins, some asleep in bed, others undressing, and  others only just down from the smoking-room and still discussing many  things, there came what seemed to me nothing more than an extra heave  of the engines and a more than usually obvious dancing motion of the  mattress on which I sat. Nothing more than that--no sound of a crash  or of anything else: no sense of shock, no jar that felt like one  heavy body meeting another. And presently the same thing repeated with  about the same intensity. The thought came to me that they must have  still further increased the speed. And all this time the Titanic was  being cut open by the iceberg and water was pouring in her side, and  yet no evidence that would indicate such a disaster had been presented  to us. It fills me with astonishment now to think of it. Consider the  question of list alone. Here was this enormous vessel running  starboard-side on to an iceberg, and a passenger sitting quietly in  bed, reading, felt no motion or list to the opposite or port side, and  this must have been felt had it been more than the usual roll of the  ship--never very much in the calm weather we had all the way. Again,  my bunk was fixed to the wall on the starboard side, and any list to  port would have tended to fling me out on the floor: I am sure I  should have noted it had there been any. And yet the explanation is  simple enough: the Titanic struck the berg with a force of impact of  over a million foot-tons; her plates were less than an inch thick, and  they must have been cut through as a knife cuts paper: there would be  no need to list; it would have been better if she had listed and  thrown us out on the floor, for it would have been an indication that  our plates were strong enough to offer, at any rate, some resistance  to the blow, and we might all have been safe to-day.    And so, with no thought of anything serious having happened to the  ship, I continued my reading; and still the murmur from the stewards  and from adjoining cabins, and no other sound: no cry in the night; no  alarm given; no one afraid--there was then nothing which could cause  fear to the most timid person. But in a few moments I felt the engines  slow and stop; the dancing motion and the vibration ceased suddenly  after being part of our very existence for four days, and that was the  first hint that anything out of the ordinary had happened. We have all  \"heard\" a loud-ticking clock stop suddenly in a quiet room, and then  have noticed the clock and the ticking noise, of which we seemed until  then quite unconscious. So in the same way the fact was suddenly  brought home to all in the ship that the engines--that part of the  ship that drove us through the sea--had stopped dead. But the stopping  of the engines gave us no information: we had to make our own  calculations as to why we had stopped. Like a flash it came to me: \"We  have dropped a propeller blade: when this happens the engines always  race away until they are controlled, and this accounts for the extra  heave they gave\"; not a very logical conclusion when considered now,  for the engines should have continued to heave all the time until we  stopped, but it was at the time a sufficiently tenable hypothesis to  hold. Acting on it, I jumped out of bed, slipped on a dressing-gown  over pyjamas, put on shoes, and went out of my cabin into the hall  near the saloon. Here was a steward leaning against the staircase,  probably waiting until those in the smoke-room above had gone to bed  and he could put out the lights. I said, \"Why have we stopped?\" \"I  don't know, sir,\" he replied, \"but I don't suppose it is anything  much.\" \"Well,\" I said, \"I am going on deck to see what it is,\" and  started towards the stairs. He smiled indulgently at me as I passed  him, and said, \"All right, sir, but it is mighty cold up there.\" I am  sure at that time he thought I was rather foolish to go up with so  little reason, and I must confess I felt rather absurd for not  remaining in the cabin: it seemed like making a needless fuss to walk  about the ship in a dressing-gown. But it was my first trip across the  sea; I had enjoyed every minute of it and was keenly alive to note  every new experience; and certainly to stop in the middle of the sea  with a propeller dropped seemed sufficient reason for going on deck.  And yet the steward, with his fatherly smile, and the fact that no one  else was about the passages or going upstairs to reconnoitre, made me  feel guilty in an undefined way of breaking some code of a ship's  regime--an Englishman's fear of being thought \"unusual,\" perhaps!    I climbed the three flights of stairs, opened the vestibule door  leading to the top deck, and stepped out into an atmosphere that cut  me, clad as I was, like a knife. Walking to the starboard side, I  peered over and saw the sea many feet below, calm and black; forward,  the deserted deck stretching away to the first-class quarters and the  captain's bridge; and behind, the steerage quarters and the stern  bridge; nothing more: no iceberg on either side or astern as far as we  could see in the darkness. There were two or three men on deck, and  with one--the Scotch engineer who played hymns in the saloon--I  compared notes of our experiences. He had just begun to undress when  the engines stopped and had come up at once, so that he was fairly  well-clad; none of us could see anything, and all being quiet and  still, the Scotchman and I went down to the next deck. Through the  windows of the smoking-room we saw a game of cards going on, with  several onlookers, and went in to enquire if they knew more than we  did. They had apparently felt rather more of the heaving motion, but  so far as I remember, none of them had gone out on deck to make any  enquiries, even when one of them had seen through the windows an  iceberg go by towering above the decks. He had called their attention  to it, and they all watched it disappear, but had then at once resumed  the game. We asked them the height of the berg and some said one  hundred feet, others, sixty feet; one of the onlookers--a motor  engineer travelling to America with a model carburetter (he had filled  in his declaration form near me in the afternoon and had questioned  the library steward how he should declare his patent)--said, \"Well, I  am accustomed to estimating distances and I put it at between eighty  and ninety feet.\" We accepted his estimate and made guesses as to what  had happened to the Titanic: the general impression was that we had  just scraped the iceberg with a glancing blow on the starboard side,  and they had stopped as a wise precaution, to examine her thoroughly  all over. \"I expect the iceberg has scratched off some of her new  paint,\" said one, \"and the captain doesn't like to go on until she is  painted up again.\" We laughed at his estimate of the captain's care  for the ship. Poor Captain Smith!--he knew by this time only too well  what had happened.    One of the players, pointing to his glass of whiskey standing at his  elbow, and turning to an onlooker, said, \"Just run"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6677"],[0,"Seventy-Five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes and Sweetmeats, (#6)"],[1,"day, and then  carefully scrape off the sediment from the bottom. It will be a  firm jelly, if too much water has not been used, and if it has  bolted long enough. If it is not firm at first, it will not become  so afterwards when boiled with the other ingredients. There should  on no account be more than three quarts of water.    Early next morning, put the jelly into a tin kettle, or covered  tin pan; set it on the fire, and melt it a little. Take it off,  and season it with the cinnamon slightly broken, a pint of madeira  wine, three lemons cut in thin slices, and half a pound of  loaf-sugar, broken up.    If you wish it high-coloured, add two table-spoonfuls of French  brandy. Mix all well together. Beat, slightly, the whites of six  eggs (saving the egg-shell) and stir the whites into the jelly.  Break up the egg-shells into very small pieces, and throw them in  also. Stir the whole very well together.    Set it on the fire, and boil it hard five minutes, but do not stir  it, as that will prevent its clearing. Have ready a large white  flannel bag, the top wide, and the bottom tapering to a point.    Tie the bag to the backs of two chairs, or to the legs of a table,  and set a while dish or a mould under it.    After the jelly has boiled five minutes, pour it hot into the bag,  and let it drip through into the dish. Do not squeeze the bag, as  that will make the jelly dull and cloudy.    If it is not clear the first time it passes through the bag, empty  out all the ingredients, wash the bag, suspend it again, put  another white dish under-it, pour the jelly back into the bag, and  let it drip through again. Repeat this six or eight times, or till  it is clear, putting a clean dish under it every time. If it does  not drip freely, move the bag into a warmer place.    When the jelly has all dripped through the bag, and is clear, set  it in a cool place to congeal. It will sometimes congeal  immediately, and sometimes not for several hours, particularly if  the weather is warm and damp. If the weather is very cold you must  take care not to let it freeze. When it is quite firm, which  perhaps it will not be till evening, fill your glasses with it,  piling it up very high. If you make it in a mould, you must either  set the mould under the bag while it is dripping, or pour it from  the dish into the mould while it is liquid. When it is perfectly  congealed, dip the mould for an instant in boiling water to loosen  the jelly. Turn it out on a glass dish.    This quantity of ingredients will make a quart of jelly when  finished. In cool weather it may be made a day or two before it is  wanted.    You may increase the seasoning, (that is, the wine, lemon, and  cinnamon,) according to your taste, but less than the above  proportion will not be sufficient to flavour the jelly.    Ice jelly is made in the same manner, only not so stiff. Four  calves-feet will be sufficient. Freeze it as you would ice-cream,  and serve it up in glasses.      BLANCMANGE.      Four calf's-feet    A pint and a half of thick cream.    Half a pound of loaf-sugar, broken up.    A glass of wine.    Half a glass of rose-water.    A tea-spoonful of mace, beaten and sifted.    Get four calf's-feet; if possible some that have been singed, and  not skinned. Scrape, and clean them well, and boil them in three  quarts of water till all the meat drops off the bone. Drain the  liquid through a colander or sieve, and skim it well. Let it stand  till next morning to congeal. Then clean it well from the  sediment, and put it into a tin or bell-metal kettle. Stir into  it, the cream, sugar, and mace. Boil it hard for five minutes,  stirring it several times. Then strain it through a linen cloth or  napkin into a large bowl, and add the wine and rose-water.    Set it in a cool place for three or four hours, stirring it very  frequently with a spoon, to, prevent the cream from separating  from the jelly. The more it is stirred the better. Stir it till it  is cool.    Wash your moulds, wipe them dry, and then wet them with cold  water. When the blancmange becomes very thick, (that is, in three  or four hours, if the weather is not too damp) put it into your  moulds.    When it has set in them till it is quite firm, loosen it carefully  all round with a knife, and turn it out on glass or china plates.    If you wish to make it with almonds, take an ounce of blanched  bitter almonds, and two ounces of sweet. Beat them in a mortar to  a fine paste, pouring in occasionally a little rose-water. When  the mixture is ready to boil, add the almonds to it gradually,  stirring them well in. Or you may stir them in, while it is  cooling in the bowl.    If it inclines to stick to the moulds, set them an instant in hot  water. It will then turn out easily.    If you choose to make it without calf's feet, you can substitute  an ounce of the best and dearest isinglass (or, if in summer, an  ounce and a quarter) boiled with the other ingredients. If made  with isinglass, you must use two ounces of sweet, and an ounce of  bitter almonds, with the addition of the grated rind of a large  lemon, and a large stick of cinnamon, broken up, a glass of wine,  and half a glass of rose-water. Those ingredients must be all  mixed together, with a quart of cream, and boiled hard for five  minutes. The mixture must then be strained through a napkin, into  a large bowl. Set it in a cool place, and stir it frequently till  nearly cold. It must then be put into the moulds.    You may substitute for the almonds, half a gill of noyau, in which  case, omit the wine.          PART THE SECOND.    CAKES.      GENERAL DIRECTIONS.    In making cakes it is particularly necessary that the eggs should  be well beaten. They are not sufficiently light till the surface  looks smooth and level, and till they get so thick as to be of the  consistence of boiled custard.    White of egg should always be beaten till it becomes a heap of  stiff froth, without any liquid at the bottom; and till it hangs  from the rods or fork without dropping.    Eggs, become light soonest when new-laid, and when beaten near the  fire or in warm dry weather.    Butter and sugar should be stirred till it looks like thick cream,  and till it stands up in the pan.    It should be kept cool. If too warm, it will make the cakes heavy.    Large cakes should be baked in tin or earthen pans with straight  sides, that are as nearly perpendicular as possible. They cut into  handsomer slices, and if they are to be iced, it will be found  very inconvenient to put on the icing, if the cake slopes in  towards the bottom.    Before you ice a cake dredge it all over with flour, and then wipe  the flour off. This will enable you to spread on the icing more  evenly.    Before you cut an ice cake, cut the icing by itself with a small  sharp penknife. The large knife with which you divide the cake,  will crack and break the icing.    Large Gingerbread, as it burns very easily, may be baked in an  earthen pan. So also may Black Cake or Pound Cake. Tin pans or  moulds, with a hollow tube in the middle, are best for cakes.    If large cakes are baked in tin pans, the bottom and sides should  be covered with sheets of paper, before the mixture is put in. The  paper must be well buttered.    Sponge cakes, and Almond cakes should be baked in pans that are as  thin as possible.    If the cakes should get burnt, scrape them with a knife or grater,  as soon as they are cool.    Always be careful to butter your pans well. Should the cakes  stick, they cannot be got out without breaking.    For queen-cakes, &c. the small tins of a round or oval shape are  most convenient. Fill them but little more than half.    After the mixture is completed, set it in a cool place till all  the cakes are baked,    In rolling out cakes made of dough, use as little flour as  possible. When you lay them in the pans, do not place them too  close together, lest they run into each other.    When you are cutting them out, dip the cutter frequently in flour,  to prevent its slicking.      QUEEN CAKE.      One pound of powdered white sugar.    One pound of fresh butter--washed.    Fourteen ounces of sifted flour.    Ten eggs.    One wine-glass of wine and brandy, mixed.    Half a glass of rose-water, or twelve drops of essence of lemon.    One tea-spoonful of mace and cinnamon, mixed.    One nutmeg, beaten or grated.    Pound the spice to a fine powder, in a marble mortar, and sift it  well.    Put the sugar into a deep earthen pan, and cut the butter into it.  Stir them together, till very light.    Beat the eggs in a broad shallow pan, till they are perfectly  smooth and thick.    Stir into the butter and sugar a little of the beaten egg, and  then a little flour, and so on alternately, a little egg and a  little flour, till the whole is in; continuing all the time to  beat the eggs, and stirring the mixture very hard. Add by degrees,  the spice, and then the liquor, a little at a time. Finally, put  in the rose-water, or essence of lemon. [Footnote: In buying  essence or oil of lemon, endeavour to get that which is white, it  being much the strongest and best. When it looks greenish, it is  generally very weak, so that when used, a double or treble  quantity is necessary.] Stir the whole very hard at the last.    Take about two dozen little tins, or more, if you have room for  them in the oven. Rub them very well with fresh butter. With a  spoon, put some of the mixture in each tin, but do not fill them  to the top as the cakes will rise high in baking. Bake them in a  quick oven, about a quarter of an hour. When they are done, they  will shrink a little from the sides of the tins.    Before you fill your tins again, scrape them well with a knife,  and wash or wipe them clean.    If the cakes are scorched by too hot a fire, do not scrape off the  burnt parts till they have grown cold.    Make an icing with the whites of three eggs, beaten till it stands  alone, and"]]]
