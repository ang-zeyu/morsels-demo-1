He was just at the  age when one is most sensitive to patronage and most resentful of it.    \"I promised I would,\" said the Gazeka, turning round and examining  himself in the mirror again. \"You'll get on all right if you behave  yourself. Don't make a frightful row in the house. Don't cheek your  elders and betters. Wash. That's all. Cut along.\"    Mike had a vague idea of sacrificing his career to the momentary  pleasure of flinging a chair at the head of the house. Overcoming this  feeling, he walked out of the room, and up to his dormitory to change.           *       *       *       *       *    In the dormitory that night the feeling of revolt, of wanting to  do something actively illegal, increased. Like Eric, he burned, not  with shame and remorse, but with rage and all that sort of thing.  He dropped off to sleep full of half-formed plans for asserting  himself. He was awakened from a dream in which he was batting against  Firby-Smith's bowling, and hitting it into space every time, by a  slight sound. He opened his eyes, and saw a dark figure silhouetted  against the light of the window. He sat up in bed.    \"Hullo,\" he said. \"Is that you, Wyatt?\"    \"Are you awake?\" said Wyatt. \"Sorry if I've spoiled your beauty  sleep.\"    \"Are you going out?\"    \"I am,\" said Wyatt. \"The cats are particularly strong on the wing just  now. Mustn't miss a chance like this. Specially as there's a good  moon, too. I shall be deadly.\"    \"I say, can't I come too?\"    A moonlight prowl, with or without an air-pistol, would just have  suited Mike's mood.    \"No, you can't,\" said Wyatt. \"When I'm caught, as I'm morally certain  to be some day, or night rather, they're bound to ask if you've ever  been out as well as me. Then you'll be able to put your hand on your  little heart and do a big George Washington act. You'll find that  useful when the time comes.\"    \"Do you think you will be caught?\"    \"Shouldn't be surprised. Anyhow, you stay where you are. Go to sleep  and dream that you're playing for the school against Ripton. So long.\"    And Wyatt, laying the bar he had extracted on the window-sill,  wriggled out. Mike saw him disappearing along the wall.           *       *       *       *       *    It was all very well for Wyatt to tell him to go to sleep, but it was  not so easy to do it. The room was almost light; and Mike always found  it difficult to sleep unless it was dark. He turned over on his side  and shut his eyes, but he had never felt wider awake. Twice he heard  the quarters chime from the school clock; and the second time he gave  up the struggle. He got out of bed and went to the window. It was a  lovely night, just the sort of night on which, if he had been at home,  he would have been out after moths with a lantern.    A sharp yowl from an unseen cat told of Wyatt's presence somewhere in  the big garden. He would have given much to be with him, but he  realised that he was on parole. He had promised not to leave the  house, and there was an end of it.    He turned away from the window and sat down on his bed. Then a  beautiful, consoling thought came to him. He had given his word that  he would not go into the garden, but nothing had been said about  exploring inside the house. It was quite late now. Everybody would be  in bed. It would be quite safe. And there must be all sorts of things  to interest the visitor in Wain's part of the house. Food, perhaps.  Mike felt that he could just do with a biscuit. And there were bound  to be biscuits on the sideboard in Wain's dining-room.    He crept quietly out of the dormitory.    He had been long enough in the house to know the way, in spite of the  fact that all was darkness. Down the stairs, along the passage to the  left, and up a few more stairs at the end. The beauty of the position  was that the dining-room had two doors, one leading into Wain's part  of the house, the other into the boys' section. Any interruption that  there might be would come from the further door.    To make himself more secure he locked that door; then, turning up the  incandescent light, he proceeded to look about him.    Mr. Wain's dining-room repaid inspection. There were the remains of  supper on the table. Mike cut himself some cheese and took some  biscuits from the box, feeling that he was doing himself well. This  was Life. There was a little soda-water in the syphon. He finished it.  As it swished into the glass, it made a noise that seemed to him like  three hundred Niagaras; but nobody else in the house appeared to have  noticed it.    He took some more biscuits, and an apple.    After which, feeling a new man, he examined the room.    And this was where the trouble began.    On a table in one corner stood a small gramophone. And gramophones  happened to be Mike's particular craze.    All thought of risk left him. The soda-water may have got into his  head, or he may have been in a particularly reckless mood, as indeed  he was. The fact remains that _he_ inserted the first record that  came to hand, wound the machine up, and set it going.    The next moment, very loud and nasal, a voice from the machine  announced that Mr. Godfrey Field would sing \"The Quaint Old Bird.\"  And, after a few preliminary chords, Mr. Field actually did so.    _\"Auntie went to Aldershot in a Paris pom-pom hat.\"_    Mike stood and drained it in.    _\"... Good gracious_ (sang Mr. Field), _what was that?\"_    It was a rattling at the handle of the door. A rattling that turned  almost immediately into a spirited banging. A voice accompanied the  banging. \"Who is there?\" inquired the voice. Mike recognised it as Mr.  Wain's. He was not alarmed. The man who holds the ace of trumps has no  need to be alarmed. His position was impregnable. The enemy was held  in check by the locked door, while the other door offered an admirable  and instantaneous way of escape.    Mike crept across the room on tip-toe and opened the window. It had  occurred to him, just in time, that if Mr. Wain, on entering the room,  found that the occupant had retired by way of the boys' part of the  house, he might possibly obtain a clue to his identity. If, on the  other hand, he opened the window, suspicion would be diverted. Mike  had not read his \"Raffles\" for nothing.    The handle-rattling was resumed. This was good. So long as the frontal  attack was kept up, there was no chance of his being taken in the  rear--his only danger.    He stopped the gramophone, which had been pegging away patiently at  \"The Quaint Old Bird\" all the time, and reflected. It seemed a pity to  evacuate the position and ring down the curtain on what was, to date,  the most exciting episode of his life; but he must not overdo the  thing, and get caught. At any moment the noise might bring  reinforcements to the besieging force, though it was not likely, for  the dining-room was a long way from the dormitories; and it might  flash upon their minds that there were two entrances to the room. Or  the same bright thought might come to Wain himself.    \"Now what,\" pondered Mike, \"would A. J. Raffles have done in a case  like this? Suppose he'd been after somebody's jewels, and found that  they were after him, and he'd locked one door, and could get away by  the other.\"    The answer was simple.    \"He'd clear out,\" thought Mike.    Two minutes later he was in bed.    He lay there, tingling all over with the consciousness of having  played a masterly game, when suddenly a gruesome idea came to him, and  he sat up, breathless. Suppose Wain took it into his head to make a  tour of the dormitories, to see that all was well! Wyatt was still  in the garden somewhere, blissfully unconscious of what was going on  indoors. He would be caught for a certainty!          CHAPTER VI    IN WHICH A TIGHT CORNER IS EVADED      For a moment the situation paralysed Mike. Then he began to be equal  to it. In times of excitement one thinks rapidly and clearly. The main  point, the kernel of the whole thing, was that he must get into the  garden somehow, and warn Wyatt. And at the same time, he must keep Mr.  Wain from coming to the dormitory. He jumped out of bed, and dashed  down the dark stairs.    He had taken care to close the dining-room door after him. It was open  now, and he could hear somebody moving inside the room. Evidently his  retreat had been made just in time.    He knocked at the door, and went in.    Mr. Wain was standing at the window, looking out. He spun round at the  knock, and stared in astonishment at Mike's pyjama-clad figure. Mike,  in spite of his anxiety, could barely check a laugh. Mr. Wain was a  tall, thin man, with a serious face partially obscured by a grizzled  beard. He wore spectacles, through which he peered owlishly at Mike.  His body was wrapped in a brown dressing-gown. His hair was ruffled.  He looked like some weird bird.    \"Please, sir, I thought I heard a noise,\" said Mike.    Mr. Wain continued to stare.    \"What are you doing here?\" said he at last.    \"Thought I heard a noise, please, sir.\"    \"A noise?\"    \"Please, sir, a row.\"    \"You thought you heard----!\"    The thing seemed to be worrying Mr. Wain.    \"So I came down, sir,\" said Mike.    The house-master's giant brain still appeared to be somewhat clouded.  He looked about him, and, catching sight of the gramophone, drew  inspiration from it.    \"Did you turn on the gramophone?\" he asked.    \"_Me_, sir!\" said Mike, with the air of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7425"],[0,"The Louisa Alcott Reader: a Supplementary Reader for the Fourth Year of School (#6)"],[1,"head first, holding the yeast-cake clasped to his  breast as if his life depended on it.    Lily watched breathlessly, while a curious working and bubbling went on,  as if Snap was tumbling about down there like a small earthquake. The  other cake-folk stood round the shore with her; for it was a great  event, and all were glad that the dear fellow was promoted so soon.  Suddenly a cry was heard, and up rose a beautiful white figure on the  farther side of the sea. It moved its hand, as if saying \"Good-by,\" and  ran over the hills so fast they had only time to see how plump and fair  he was, with a little knob on the top of his head like a crown.    \"He's gone to the happy land, and we shall miss him; but we'll follow  his example and soon find him again,\" said a gentle Sponge cake, with  a sigh, as all went back to their work; while Lily hurried after Snap,  eager to see the new country, which was the best of all.    A delicious odor of fresh bread blew up from the valley as she stood  on the hill-top and looked down on the peaceful scene below. Fields of  yellow grain waved in the breeze; hop-vines grew from tree to tree; and  many windmills whirled their white sails as they ground the different  grains into fresh, sweet meal, for the loaves of bread that built the  houses like bricks and paved the streets, or in many shapes formed  the people, furniture, and animals. A river of milk flowed through the  peaceful land, and fountains of yeast rose and fell with a pleasant foam  and fizz. The ground was a mixture of many meals, and the paths were  golden Indian, which gave a very gay look to the scene. Buckwheat  flowers bloomed on their rosy stems, and tall corn-stalks rustled their  leaves in the warm air that came from the ovens hidden in the hillsides;  for bread needs a slow fire, and an obliging volcano did the baking  here.    \"What a lovely place!\" cried Lily, feeling the charm of the homelike  landscape, in spite of the funny plump people moving about.    Two of these figures came running to meet her as she slowly walked down  the yellow path from the hill. One was a golden boy, with a beaming  face; the other a little girl in a shiny brown cloak, who looked as if  she would taste very nice. They each put a warm hand into Lily's, and  the boy said,--    \"We are glad to see you. Muffin told us you were coming.\"    \"Thank you. Who is Muffin?\" asked Lily, feeling as if she had seen both  these little people before, and liked them.    \"He was Ginger Snap once, but he's a Muffin now. We begin in that way,  and work up to the perfect loaf by degrees. My name is Johnny Cake, and  she's Sally Lunn. You know us; so come on and have a race.\"    Lily burst out laughing at the idea of playing with these old friends of  hers; and all three ran away as fast as they could tear, down the hill,  over a bridge, into the middle of the village, where they stopped,  panting, and sat down on some very soft rolls to rest.    \"What do you all do _here_?\" asked Lily, when she got her breath again.    \"We farm, we study, we bake, we brew, and are as merry as grigs all day  long. It's school-time now, and we must go; will you come?\" said Sally,  jumping up as if she liked it.    \"Our schools are not like yours; we only study two things,--grain and  yeast. I think you'll like it. We have yeast to-day, and the experiments  are very jolly,\" added Johnny, trotting off to a tall brown tower of rye  and Indian bread, where the school was kept.    Lily never liked to go to school, but she was ashamed to own it; so she  went along with Sally, and was so amused with all she saw that she was  glad she came. The brown loaf was hollow, and had no roof; and when  she asked why they used a ruin, Sally told her to wait and see why they  chose strong walls and plenty of room overhead. All round was a circle  of very small biscuits like cushions, and on these the Bread-children  sat. A square loaf in the middle was the teacher's desk, and on it  lay an ear of wheat, with several bottles of yeast well corked up. The  teacher was a pleasant, plump lady from Vienna, very wise, and so famous  for her good bread that she was a Professor of Grainology.    When all were seated, she began with the wheat ear, and told them all  about it in such an interesting way that Lily felt as if she had never  known anything about the bread she ate before. The experiments with  the yeast were quite exciting,--for Fraulein Pretzel showed them how it  would work till it blew the cork out, and go fizzing up to the sky if it  was kept too long; how it would turn sour or flat, and spoil the bread  if care was not taken to use it just at the right moment; and how too  much would cause the loaf to rise till there was no substance to it.    The children were very bright; for they were fed on the best kinds of  oatmeal and Graham bread, with very little white bread or hot cakes to  spoil their young stomachs. Hearty, happy boys and girls they were, and  their yeasty souls were very lively in them; for they danced and sung,  and seemed as bright and gay as if acidity, heaviness, and mould were  quite unknown.    Lily was very happy with them, and when school was done went home with  Sally and ate the best bread and milk for dinner that she ever tasted.  In the afternoon Johnny took her to the cornfield, and showed her how  they kept the growing ears free from mildew and worms. Then she went  to the bakehouse; and here she found her old friend Muffin hard at work  making Parker House rolls, for he was such a good cook he was set to  work at once on the lighter kinds of bread.    \"Well, isn't this better than Candy-land or Saccharissa?\" he asked,  as he rolled and folded his bits of dough with a dab of butter tucked  inside.    \"Ever so much!\" cried Lily. \"I feel better already, and mean to learn  all I can. Mamma will be so pleased if I can make good bread when I  go home. She is rather old-fashioned, and likes me to be a nice  housekeeper. I didn't think bread interesting then, but I do now; and  Johnny's mother is going to teach me to make Indian cakes to-morrow.\"    \"Glad to hear it. Learn all you can, and tell other people how to make  healthy bodies and happy souls by eating good plain food. Not like this,  though these rolls are better than cake. I have to work my way up to the  perfect loaf, you know; and then, oh, then, I'm a happy thing.\"    \"What happens then? Do you go on to some other wonderful place?\" asked  Lily, as Muffin paused with a smile on his face.    \"Yes; I am eaten by some wise, good human being, and become a part of  him or her. That is immortality and heaven; for I may nourish a poet and  help him sing, or feed a good woman who makes the world better for being  in it, or be crumbed into the golden porringer of a baby prince who  is to rule a kingdom. Isn't that a noble way to live, and an end worth  working for?\" asked Muffin, in a tone that made Lily feel as if some  sort of fine yeast had got into her, and was setting her brain to work  with new thoughts.    \"Yes, it is. I suppose all common things are made for that purpose, if  we only knew it; and people should be glad to do anything to help the  world along, even making good bread in a kitchen,\" answered Lily, in a  sober way that showed that her little mind was already digesting the new  food it had got.    She stayed in Bread-land a long time, and enjoyed and learned a great  deal that she never forgot. But at last, when she had made the perfect  loaf, she wanted to go home, that her mother might see and taste it.    \"I've put a good deal of myself into it, and I'd love to think I had  given her strength or pleasure by my work,\" she said, as she and Sally  stood looking at the handsome loaf.    \"You can go whenever you like; just take the bread in your hands and  wish three times, and you'll be wherever you say. I'm sorry to have you  go, but I don't wonder you want to see your mother. Don't forget what  you have learned, and you will always be glad you came to us,\" said  Sally, kissing her good-by.    \"Where is Muffin? I can't go without seeing him, my dear old friend,\"  answered Lily, looking round for him.    \"He is here,\" said Sally, touching the loaf. \"He was ready to go, and  chose to pass into your bread rather than any other; for he said he  loved you and would be glad to help feed so good a little girl.\"    \"How kind of him! I must be careful to grow wise and excellent, else he  will be disappointed and have died in vain,\" said Lily, touched by his  devotion.    Then, bidding them all farewell, she hugged her loaf close, wished three  times to be in her own home, and like a flash she was there.    Whether her friends believed the wonderful tale of her adventures I  cannot tell; but I know that she was a nice little housekeeper from that  day, and made such good bread that other girls came to learn of her.  She also grew from a sickly, fretful child into a fine, strong woman,  because she ate very little cake and candy, except at Christmas time,  when the oldest and the wisest love to make a short visit to Candy-land.

Run quick, and see if he has got a monkey on  his organ,\" cried little Neddy, running to the window in a great hurry  one day.    Yes; there was the monkey in his blue and red suit, with a funny little  cap, and the long tail trailing behind. But he didn't seem to be a  lively monkey; for he sat in a bunch, with his sad face turned anxiously  to his master, who kept pulling the chain to make him dance. The stiff  collar had made his neck sore; and when the man twitched, the poor thing  moaned and put up his little hand to hold the chain. He tried to dance,  but was so weak he could only hop a few steps, and stop panting for  breath. The cruel man wouldn't let him rest till Neddy called out,--    \"Don't hurt him; let him come up here "]]]
