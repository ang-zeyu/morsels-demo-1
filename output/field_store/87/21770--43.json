As I approached the slightly more slender extremity of the branch it  bent beneath my weight until, as I balanced perilously upon its outer  tip, it swayed gently on a level with the ledge at a distance of a  couple of feet.    Five hundred feet below me lay the vivid scarlet carpet of the valley;  nearly five thousand feet above towered the mighty, gleaming face of  the gorgeous cliffs.    The cave that I faced was not one of those that I had seen from the  ground, and which lay much higher, possibly a thousand feet.  But so  far as I might know it was as good for our purpose as another, and so I  returned to the tree for Tars Tarkas.    Together we wormed our way along the waving pathway, but when we  reached the end of the branch we found that our combined weight so  depressed the limb that the cave's mouth was now too far above us to be  reached.    We finally agreed that Tars Tarkas should return along the branch,  leaving his longest leather harness strap with me, and that when the  limb had risen to a height that would permit me to enter the cave I was  to do so, and on Tars Tarkas' return I could then lower the strap and  haul him up to the safety of the ledge.    This we did without mishap and soon found ourselves together upon the  verge of a dizzy little balcony, with a magnificent view of the valley  spreading out below us.    As far as the eye could reach gorgeous forest and crimson sward skirted  a silent sea, and about all towered the brilliant monster guardian  cliffs.  Once we thought we discerned a gilded minaret gleaming in the  sun amidst the waving tops of far-distant trees, but we soon abandoned  the idea in the belief that it was but an hallucination born of our  great desire to discover the haunts of civilized men in this beautiful,  yet forbidding, spot.    Below us upon the river's bank the great white apes were devouring the  last remnants of Tars Tarkas' former companions, while great herds of  plant men grazed in ever-widening circles about the sward which they  kept as close clipped as the smoothest of lawns.    Knowing that attack from the tree was now improbable, we determined to  explore the cave, which we had every reason to believe was but a  continuation of the path we had already traversed, leading the gods  alone knew where, but quite evidently away from this valley of grim  ferocity.    As we advanced we found a well-proportioned tunnel cut from the solid  cliff.  Its walls rose some twenty feet above the floor, which was  about five feet in width.  The roof was arched.  We had no means of  making a light, and so groped our way slowly into the ever-increasing  darkness, Tars Tarkas keeping in touch with one wall while I felt along  the other, while, to prevent our wandering into diverging branches and  becoming separated or lost in some intricate and labyrinthine maze, we  clasped hands.    How far we traversed the tunnel in this manner I do not know, but  presently we came to an obstruction which blocked our further progress.  It seemed more like a partition than a sudden ending of the cave, for  it was constructed not of the material of the cliff, but of something  which felt like very hard wood.    Silently I groped over its surface with my hands, and presently was  rewarded by the feel of the button which as commonly denotes a door on  Mars as does a door knob on Earth.    Gently pressing it, I had the satisfaction of feeling the door slowly  give before me, and in another instant we were looking into a dimly  lighted apartment, which, so far as we could see, was unoccupied.    Without more ado I swung the door wide open and, followed by the huge  Thark, stepped into the chamber.  As we stood for a moment in silence  gazing about the room a slight noise behind caused me to turn quickly,  when, to my astonishment, I saw the door close with a sharp click as  though by an unseen hand.    Instantly I sprang toward it to wrench it open again, for something in  the uncanny movement of the thing and the tense and almost palpable  silence of the chamber seemed to portend a lurking evil lying hidden in  this rock-bound chamber within the bowels of the Golden Cliffs.    My fingers clawed futilely at the unyielding portal, while my eyes  sought in vain for a duplicate of the button which had given us ingress.    And then, from unseen lips, a cruel and mocking peal of laughter rang  through the desolate place.          CHAPTER III    THE CHAMBER OF MYSTERY      For moments after that awful laugh had ceased reverberating through the  rocky room, Tars Tarkas and I stood in tense and expectant silence.  But no further sound broke the stillness, nor within the range of our  vision did aught move.    At length Tars Tarkas laughed softly, after the manner of his strange  kind when in the presence of the horrible or terrifying.  It is not an  hysterical laugh, but rather the genuine expression of the pleasure  they derive from the things that move Earth men to loathing or to tears.    Often and again have I seen them roll upon the ground in mad fits of  uncontrollable mirth when witnessing the death agonies of women and  little children beneath the torture of that hellish green Martian  fete--the Great Games.    I looked up at the Thark, a smile upon my own lips, for here in truth  was greater need for a smiling face than a trembling chin.    \"What do you make of it all?\" I asked.  \"Where in the deuce are we?\"    He looked at me in surprise.    \"Where are we?\" he repeated.  \"Do you tell me, John Carter, that you  know not where you be?\"    \"That I am upon Barsoom is all that I can guess, and but for you and  the great white apes I should not even guess that, for the sights I  have seen this day are as unlike the things of my beloved Barsoom as I  knew it ten long years ago as they are unlike the world of my birth.    \"No, Tars Tarkas, I know not where we be.\"    \"Where have you been since you opened the mighty portals of the  atmosphere plant years ago, after the keeper had died and the engines  stopped and all Barsoom was dying, that had not already died, of  asphyxiation?  Your body even was never found, though the men of a  whole world sought after it for years, though the Jeddak of Helium and  his granddaughter, your princess, offered such fabulous rewards that  even princes of royal blood joined in the search.    \"There was but one conclusion to reach when all efforts to locate you  had failed, and that, that you had taken the long, last pilgrimage down  the mysterious River Iss, to await in the Valley Dor upon the shores of  the Lost Sea of Korus the beautiful Dejah Thoris, your princess.    \"Why you had gone none could guess, for your princess still lived--\"    \"Thank God,\" I interrupted him.  \"I did not dare to ask you, for I  feared I might have been too late to save her--she was very low when I  left her in the royal gardens of Tardos Mors that long-gone night; so  very low that I scarcely hoped even then to reach the atmosphere plant  ere her dear spirit had fled from me for ever.  And she lives yet?\"    \"She lives, John Carter.\"    \"You have not told me where we are,\" I reminded him.    \"We are where I expected to find you, John Carter--and another.  Many  years ago you heard the story of the woman who taught me the thing that  green Martians are reared to hate, the woman who taught me to love.  You know the cruel tortures and the awful death her love won for her at  the hands of the beast, Tal Hajus.    \"She, I thought, awaited me by the Lost Sea of Korus.    \"You know that it was left for a man from another world, for yourself,  John Carter, to teach this cruel Thark what friendship is; and you, I  thought, also roamed the care-free Valley Dor.    \"Thus were the two I most longed for at the end of the long pilgrimage  I must take some day, and so as the time had elapsed which Dejah Thoris  had hoped might bring you once more to her side, for she has always  tried to believe that you had but temporarily returned to your own  planet, I at last gave way to my great yearning and a month since I  started upon the journey, the end of which you have this day witnessed.  Do you understand now where you be, John Carter?\"    \"And that was the River Iss, emptying into the Lost Sea of Korus in the  Valley Dor?\" I asked.    \"This is the valley of love and peace and rest to which every  Barsoomian since time immemorial has longed to pilgrimage at the end of  a life of hate and strife and bloodshed,\" he replied.  \"This, John  Carter, is Heaven.\"    His tone was cold and ironical; its bitterness but reflecting the  terrible disappointment he had suffered.  Such a fearful  disillusionment, such a blasting of life-long hopes and aspirations,  such an uprooting of age-old tradition might have excused a vastly  greater demonstration on the part of the Thark.    I laid my hand upon his shoulder.    \"I am sorry,\" I said, nor did there seem aught else to say.    \"Think, John Carter, of the countless billions of Barsoomians who have  taken the voluntary pilgrimage down this cruel river since the  beginning of time, only to fall into the ferocious clutches of the  terrible creatures that to-day assailed us.    \"There is an ancient legend that once a red man returned from the banks  of the Lost Sea of Korus, returned from the Valley Dor, back through  the mysterious River Iss, and the legend has it that he narrated a  fearful blasphemy of horrid brutes that inhabited a valley of wondrous  loveliness, brutes that pounced upon each Barsoomian as he terminated  his pilgrimage and devoured him upon the banks of the Lost Sea where he  had looked to find love and peace and happiness; but the ancients  killed the blasphemer, as tradition has ordained that any shall be  killed who return from the bosom of the River of Mystery.    \"But now we know that it was no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#6)"],[1,"it had been in some other  part of the world, where he might have delivered them up to the civil  justice, or might have left them among Christians; but it was better  their lives were put in hazard than his life, and the safety of the  ship; and that though he did not know that he had deserved so ill of any  of them as that they should leave the ship rather than do their duty,  yet if any of them were resolved to do so unless he would consent to  take a gang of traitors on board, who, as he had proved before them  all, had conspired to murder him, he would not hinder them, nor for the  present would he resent their importunity; but, if there was nobody left  in the ship but himself, he would never consent to take them on board.    This discourse was delivered so well, was in itself so reasonable, was  managed with so much temper, yet so boldly concluded with a negative,  that the greatest part of the men were satisfied for the present.  However, as it put the men into juntos and cabals, they were not  composed for some hours; the wind also slackening towards night, the  captain ordered not to weigh till next morning.    The same night twenty-three of the men, among whom was the gunner's  mate, the surgeon's assistant, and two carpenters, applying to the chief  mate told him, that as the captain had given them leave to go on shore  to their comrades, they begged that he would speak to the captain not to  take it ill that they were desirous to go and die with their companions;  and that they thought they could do no less in such an extremity than  go to them; because, if there was any way to save their lives, it was  by adding to their numbers, and making them strong enough to assist one  another in defending themselves against the savages, till perhaps they  might one time or other find means to make their escape, and get to  their own country again.    The mate told them, in so many words, that he durst not speak to the  captain upon any such design, and was very sorry they had no more  respect for him than to desire him to go upon such an errand; but, if  they were resolved upon such an enterprise, he would advise them to take  the long-boat in the morning betimes, and go off, seeing the captain had  given them leave, and leave a civil letter behind them to the captain,  and to desire him to send his men on shore for the boat, which should be  delivered very honestly, and he promised to keep their counsel so long.    Accordingly, an hour before day, those twenty-three men, with every  man a firelock and a cutlass, with some pistols, three halberds or  half-pikes, and good store of powder and ball, without any provision but  about half a hundred of bread, but with all their chests and clothes,  tools, instruments, books, &c., embarked themselves so silently, that  the captain got no notice of it till they were gotten half the way on  shore.    As soon as the captain heard of it he called for the gunner's mate, the  chief gunner being at the time sick in his cabin, and ordered to fire at  them; but, to his great mortification, the gunner's mate was one of the  number, and was gone with them; and indeed it was by this means they got  so many arms and so much ammunition. When the captain found how it was,  and that there was no help for it, he began to be a little appeased, and  made light of it, and called up the men, and spoke kindly to them, and  told them he was very well satisfied in the fidelity and ability of  those that were now left, and that he would give to them, for their  encouragement, to be divided among them, the wages which were due to the  men that were gone, and that it was a great satisfaction to him that the  ship was free from such a mutinous rabble, who had not the least reason  for their discontent.    The men seemed very well satisfied, and particularly the promise of the  wages of those who were gone went a great way with them. After this, the  letter which was left by the men was given to the captain by his boy,  with whom, it seems, the men had left it. The letter was much to the  same purpose of what they had said to the mate, and which he declined to  say for them, only that at the end of their letter they told the captain  that, as they had no dishonest design, so they had taken nothing away  with them which was not their own, except some arms and ammunition, such  as were absolutely necessary to them, as well for their defence against  the savages as to kill fowls or beasts for their food, that they might  not perish; and as there were considerable sums due to them for wages,  they hoped he would allow the arms and ammunition upon their accounts.  They told him that, as to the ship's longboat, which they had taken to  bring them on shore, they knew it was necessary to him, and they were  very willing to restore it to him, and if he pleased to send for it, it  should be very honestly delivered to his men, and not the least injury  offered to any of those who came for it, nor the least persuasion or  invitation made use of to any of them to stay with them; and, at the  bottom of the letter, they very humbly besought him that, for their  defence, and for the safety of their lives, he would be pleased to send  them a barrel of powder and some ammunition, and give them leave to keep  the mast and sail of the boat, that if it was possible for them to make  themselves a boat of any kind, they might shift off to sea, to save  themselves in such part of the world as their fate should direct them  to.    Upon this the captain, who had won much upon the rest of his men by what  he had said to them, and was very easy as to the general peace (for it  was very true that the most mutinous of the men were gone), came out  to the quarter-deck, and, calling the men together, let them know the  substance of the letter, and told the men that, however they had not  deserved such civility from him, yet he was not willing to expose them  more than they were willing to expose themselves; he was inclined to  send them some ammunition, and as they had desired but one barrel of  powder, he would send them two barrels, and shot, or lead and moulds to  make shot, in proportion; and, to let them see that he was civiller to  them than they deserved, he ordered a cask of arrack and a great bag  of bread to be sent them for subsistence till they should be able to  furnish themselves.    The rest of the men applauded the captain's generosity, and every one  of them sent us something or other, and about three in the afternoon the  pinnace came on shore, and brought us all these things, which we were  very glad of, and returned the long-boat accordingly; and as to the men  that came with the pinnace, as the captain had singled out such men as  he knew would not come over to us, so they had positive orders not to  bring any one of us on board again, upon pain of death; and indeed both  were so true to our points, that we neither asked them to stay, nor they  us to go.    We were now a good troop, being in all twenty-seven men, very well  armed, and provided with everything but victuals; we had two carpenters  among us, a gunner, and, which was worth all the rest, a surgeon or  doctor; that is to say, he was an assistant to a surgeon at Goa, and was  entertained as a supernumerary with us. The carpenters had brought all  their tools, the doctor all his instruments and medicines, and indeed we  had a great deal of baggage, that is to say, on the whole, for some of  us had little more than the clothes on our backs, of whom I was one;  but I had one thing which none of them had, viz., I had the twenty-two  moidores of gold which I had stole at the Brazils, and two pieces of  eight. The two pieces of eight I showed, and one moidore, and none of  them ever suspected that I had any more money in the world, having been  known to be only a poor boy taken up in charity, as you have heard,  and used like a slave, and in the worst manner of a slave, by my cruel  master the pilot.    It will be easy to imagine we four that were left at first were joyful,  nay, even surprised with joy at the coming of the rest, though at first  we were frighted, and thought they came to fetch us back to hang us;  but they took ways quickly to satisfy us that they were in the same  condition with us, only with this additional circumstance, theirs was  voluntary, and ours by force.    The first piece of news they told us after the short history of their  coming away was, that our companion was on board, but how he got  thither we could not imagine, for he had given us the slip, and we never  imagined he could swim so well as to venture off to the ship, which lay  at so great a distance; nay, we did not so much as know that he could  swim at all, and not thinking anything of what really happened, we  thought he must have wandered into the woods and was devoured, or  was fallen into the hands of the natives, and was murdered; and these  thoughts filled us with fears enough, and of several kinds, about its  being some time or other our lot to fall into their hands also. But  hearing how he had with much difficulty been received on board the ship  again and pardoned, we were much better satisfied than before.    Being now, as I have said, a considerable number of us, and in condition  to defend ourselves, the first thing we did was to give every one his  hand that we would not separate from one another upon any occasion  whatsoever, but that we would live and die together; that we would kill  no food, but that we would distribute it in public; and that we would  be in all things guided by the majority, and not insist upon our own  resolutions in anything if the majority were against it; that we would  appoint a captain among us to be our governor or leader during pleasure;  that while he was in office we would obey him without reserve, on pain  of death; and that every one should take turn, but the captain was not  to act in any particular thing"]]]
