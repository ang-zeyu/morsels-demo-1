The next  day Seti said to Fielding: \"Behold, God has given thee strong men  for friends. Thou hast Mahommed Seti\"--his chest blew out like a  bellows--\"and thou hast Donovan Pasha.\"    Fielding grunted. He was not a fluent man, save in forbidden language,  and Seti added:    \"Behold thou, saadat el bey, who opens a man's body and turns over his  heart with a sword-point, and sewing him up with silken cords bids him  live again, greatness is in thy house! Last night thy friend, Donovan  Pasha, gave into my hands a score of those cigarettes which are like the  smell of a camel-yard. In the evening, having broken bread and prayed,  I sat down at the door of the barber in peace to smoke, as becomes a man  who loves God and His benefits. Five times I puffed, and then I stayed  my lips, for why should a man die of smoke when he can die by the sword?  But there are many men in Korosko whose lives are not as clean linen.  These I did not love. I placed in their hands one by one the cigarettes,  and with their blessings following me I lost myself in the dusk and  waited.\"    Mahommed Seti paused. On his face was a smile of sardonic retrospection.    \"Go on, you fool!\" grunted Fielding.    \"Nineteen sick men, unworthy followers of the Prophet, thanked Allah in  the mosque to-day that their lives were spared. Donovan Pasha is a great  man and a strong, effendi! We be three strong men together.\"    Dicky Donovan's conversion to a lasting belief in Mahommed Seti came a  year later.    The thing happened at a little sortie from the Nile. Fielding was chief  medical officer, and Dicky, for the moment, was unattached. When the  time came for starting, Mahommed Seti brought round Fielding's horse  and also Dicky Donovan's. Now, Mahommed Seti loved a horse as well as a  Bagarra Arab, and he had come to love Fielding's waler Bashi-Bazouk as  a Farshoot dog loves his master. And Bashi-Bazouk was worthy of Seti's  love. The sand of the desert, Seti's breath and the tail of his yelek  made the coat of Bashi-Bazouk like silk. It was the joy of the regiment,  and the regiment knew that Seti had added a new chapter to the Koran  concerning horses, in keeping with Mahomet's own famous passage--              \"By the CHARGERS that pant,            And the hoofs that strike fire,            And the scourers at dawn,            Who stir up the dust with it,            And cleave through a host with it!\"    But Mahomet's phrases were recited in the mosque, and Seti's, as he  rubbed Bashi-Bazouk with the tail of his yelek.    There was one thing, however, that Seti loved more than horses, or at  least as much. Life to him was one long possible Donnybrook Fair. That  was why, although he was no longer in the army, when Fielding and Dicky  mounted for the sortie he said to Fielding:    \"Oh, brother of Joshua and all the fighters of Israel, I have a  bobtailed Arab. Permit me to ride with thee.\" And Fielding replied: \"You  will fight the barn-yard fowl for dinner; get back to your stew-pots.\"    But Seti was not to be fobbed off. \"It is written that the Lord, the  Great One, is compassionate and merciful. Wilt thou then, O saadat.\"    Fielding interrupted: \"Go, harry the onion-field for dinner. You're  a dog of a slave, and a murderer too: you must pay the price of that  grindstone!\"    But Seti hung by the skin of his teeth to the fringe of Fielding's  good-nature--Fielding's words only were sour and wrathful. So Seti  grinned and said: \"For the grindstone, behold it sent Ebn Haroun to the  mercy of God. Let him rest, praise be to God!\"    \"You were drummed out of the army. You can't fight,\" said Fielding  again; but he was smiling under his long moustache.    \"Is not a bobtailed nag sufficient shame? Let thy friend ride the  bobtailed nag and pay the price of the grindstone and the drum,\" said  Seti.    \"Fall in!\" rang the colonel's command, and Fielding, giving Seti a  friendly kick in the ribs, galloped away to the troop.    Seti turned to the little onion-garden. His eye harried it for a moment,  and he grinned. He turned to the doorway where a stew-pot rested, and  his mind dwelt cheerfully on the lamb he had looted for Fielding's  dinner. But last of all his eye rested upon his bobtailed Arab, the  shameless thing in an Arab country, where every horse rears his tail as  a peacock spreads his feathers, as a marching Albanian lifts his foot.  The bobtailed Arab's nose was up, his stump was high. A hundred times he  had been in battle; he was welted and scarred like a shoe-maker's apron.  He snorted his cry towards the dust rising like a surf behind the heels  of the colonel's troop.    Suddenly Seti answered the cry--he answered the cry and sprang forward.    That was how in the midst of a desperate melee twenty miles away on the  road to Dongola little Dicky Donovan saw Seti riding into the thick of  the fight armed only with a naboot of domwood, his call, \"Allala-Akbar!\"  rising like a hoarse-throated bugle, as it had risen many a time in the  old days on the road from Manfaloot. Seti and his bobtailed Arab, two  shameless ones, worked their way to the front. Not Seti's strong right  arm alone and his naboot were at work, but the bobtailed Arab, like  an iron-handed razor toothed shrew, struck and bit his way, his eyes  bloodred like Seti's. The superstitious Dervishes fell back before this  pair of demons; for their madness was like the madness of those who at  the Dosah throw themselves beneath the feet of the Sheikh's horse by the  mosque of El Hassan in Cairo. The bobtailed Arab's lips were drawn back  over his assaulting teeth in a horrible grin. Seti grinned too, the grin  of fury and of death.    Fielding did not know how it was that, falling wounded from his horse,  he was caught by strong arms, as Bashi-Bazouk cleared him at a bound  and broke into the desert. But Dicky Donovan, with his own horse  lanced under him, knew that Seti made him mount the bobtailed Arab with  Fielding in front of him, and that a moment later they had joined the  little band retreating to Korosko, having left sixty of their own dead  on the field, and six times that number of Dervishes.    It was Dicky Donovan who cooked Fielding's supper that night, having  harried the onion-field and fought the barn-yard fowl, as Fielding had  commanded Seti.    But next evening at sunset Mahommed Seti came into the fort, slashed and  bleeding, with Bashi-Bazouk limping heavily after him.    Fielding said that Seti's was the good old game for which V.C.'s were  the reward--to run terrible risks to save a life in the face of the  enemy; but, heretofore, it had always been the life of a man, not of  a horse. To this day the Gippies of that regiment still alive do not  understand why Seti should have stayed behind and risked his life to  save a horse and bring him wounded back to his master. But little  Dicky Donovan understood, and Fielding understood; and Fielding never  afterwards mounted Bashi-Bazouk but he remembered. It was Mahommed Seti  who taught him the cry of Mahomet:              \"By the CHARGERS that pant,            And the hoofs that strike fire,            And the scourers at dawn,            Who stir up the dust with it,            And cleave through a host with it!\"    And in the course of time Mahommed Seti managed to pay the price of the  grindstone and also of the drum.          THE DESERTION OF MAHOMMED SELIM    The business began during Ramadan; how it ended and where was in the  mouth of every soldier between Beni Souef and Dongola, and there was not  a mud hut or a mosque within thirty miles of Mahommed Selim's home, not  a khiassa or felucca dropping anchor for gossip and garlic below the  mudirieh, but knew the story of Soada, the daughter of Wassef the  camel-driver.    Soada was pretty and upright, with a full round breast and a slim  figure. She carried a balass of water on her head as gracefully as a  princess a tiara. This was remarked by occasional inspectors making  their official rounds, and by more than one khowagah putting in with  his dahabeah where the village maidens came to fill their water-jars.  Soada's trinkets and bracelets were perhaps no better than those of her  companions, but her one garment was of the linen of Beni Mazar, as good  as that worn by the Sheikh-Elbeled himself.    Wassef the camel-driver, being proud of Soada, gave her the advantage of  his frequent good fortune in desert loot and Nile backsheesh. But Wassef  was a hard man for all that, and he grew bitter and morose at last,  because he saw that camel-driving must suffer by the coming of the  railway. Besides, as a man gets older he likes the season of Ramadan  less, for he must fast from sunrise to sunset, though his work goes on;  and, with broken sleep, having his meals at night, it is ten to one but  he gets irritable.    So it happened that one evening just at sunset, Wassef came to his hut,  with the sun like the red rim of a huge thumb-nail in the sky behind  him, ready beyond telling for his breakfast, and found nothing. On his  way home he had seen before the houses and cafes silent Mussulmans with  cigarettes and matches in their fingers, cooks with their hands on the  lids of the cooking pots, where the dourha and onions boiled; but  here outside his own doorway there was no odour, and there was silence  within.    \"Now, by the beard of the Prophet,\" he muttered, \"is it for this I  have fed the girl and clothed her with linen from Beni Mazar all these  years!\" And he turned upon his heel, and kicked a yellow cur in the  ribs; then he went to the nearest cafe, and making huge rolls of  forcemeat with his fingers crammed them into his mouth, grunting like  a Berkshire boar. Nor did his anger cease thereafter, for this meal of  meat had cost him five piastres--the second meal of meat in a week.    As Wassef sat on the mastaba of the cafe sullen and angry, the village  barber whispered in his ear that Mahommed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6267"],[0,"The Weavers: a tale of England and Egypt of fifty years ago - Complete (#6)"],[1,"among those tarnished baubles, his titles,  and stripping the Irish Peter to clothe the English Paul.\"    \"He means to make Hamley his home? From Ireland these furnishings come?\"    \"So it seems. Henceforth the Cloistered House will have its doors flung  wide. London and all the folk of Parliament will flutter along the dunes  of Hamley.\"    \"Then the bailiff will sit yonder within a year, for he is but a starved  Irish peer.\"    \"He lives to-day as though he would be rich tomorrow. He bids for fame  and fortune, Davy.\"    \"'Tis as though a shirtless man should wear a broadcloth coat over a  cotton vest.\"    \"The world sees only the broadcloth coat. For the rest--\"    \"For the rest, Faith?\"    \"They see the man's face, and--\"    His eyes were embarrassed. A thought had flashed into his mind which he  considered unworthy, for this girl beside him was little likely to dwell  upon the face of a renegade peer, whose living among them was a constant  reminder of his father's apostasy. She was too fine, dwelt in such high  spheres, that he could not think of her being touched by the glittering  adventures of this daring young member of Parliament, whose book of  travels had been published, only to herald his understood determination  to have office in the Government, not in due time, but in his own time.  What could there be in common between the sophisticated Eglington and  this sweet, primitively wholesome Quaker girl?    Faith read what was passing in his mind. She flushed--slowly flushed  until her face--and eyes were one soft glow, then she laid a hand upon  his arm and said: \"Davy, I feel the truth about him--no more. Nothing of  him is for thee or me. His ways are not our ways.\" She paused, and then  said solemnly: \"He hath a devil. That I feel. But he hath also a mind,  and a cruel will. He will hew a path, or make others hew it for him.  He will make or break. Nothing will stand in his way, neither man nor  thing, those he loves nor those he hates. He will go on--and to go on,  all means, so they be not criminal, will be his. Men will prophesy great  things for him--they do so now. But nothing they prophesy, Davy, keeps  pace with his resolve.\"    \"How does thee know these things?\"    His question was one of wonder and surprise. He had never before seen in  her this sharp discernment and criticism.    \"How know I, Davy? I know him by studying thee. What thee is not he is.  What he is thee is not.\" The last beams of the sun sent a sudden glint  of yellow to the green at their feet from the western hills, rising far  over and above the lower hills of the village, making a wide ocean of  light, at the bottom of which lay the Meeting-house and the Cloistered  House, and the Red Mansion with the fruited wall, and all the others,  like dwellings at the bottom of a golden sea. David's eyes were on the  distance, and the far-seeing look was in his face which had so deeply  impressed Faith in the Meeting-house, by which she had read his future.    \"And shall I not also go on?\" he asked.    \"How far, who can tell?\"    There was a plaintive note in her voice--the unavailing and sad protest  of the maternal spirit, of the keeper of the nest, who sees the brood  fly safely away, looking not back.    \"What does thee see for me afar, Faith?\" His look was eager.    \"The will of God, which shall be done,\" she said with a sudden  resolution, and stood up. Her hands were lightly clasped before her like  those of Titian's Mater Dolorosa among the Rubens and Tintorettos of the  Prado, a lonely figure, whose lot it was to spend her life for others.  Even as she already had done; for thrice she had refused marriages  suitable and possible to her. In each case she had steeled her heart  against loving, that she might be all in all to her sister's child and  to her father. There is no habit so powerful as the habit of care of  others. In Faith it came as near being a passion as passion could have  a place in her even-flowing blood, under that cool flesh, governed by  a heart as fair as the apricot blossoms on the wall in her father's  garden. She had been bitterly hurt in the Meeting-house; as bitterly as  is many a woman when her lover has deceived her. David had acknowledged  before them all that he had played the flute secretly for years! That he  should have played it was nothing; that she should not have shared his  secret, and so shared his culpability before them all, was a wound which  would take long to heal.    She laid her hand upon his shoulder suddenly with a nervous little  motion.    \"And the will of God thee shall do to His honour, though thee is outcast  to-day.... But, Davy, the music-thee kept it from me.\"    He looked up at her steadily; he read what was in her mind.    \"I hid it so, because I would not have thy conscience troubled. Thee  would go far to smother it for me; and I was not so ungrateful to thee.  I did it for good to thee.\"    A smile passed across her lips. Never was woman so grateful, never wound  so quickly healed. She shook her head sadly at him, and stilling the  proud throbbing of her heart, she said:    \"But thee played so well, Davy!\"    He got up and turned his head away, lest he should laugh outright. Her  reasoning--though he was not worldly enough to call it feminine, and  though it scarce tallied with her argument--seemed to him quite her own.    \"How long have we?\" he said over his shoulder. \"The sun is yet five  minutes up, or more,\" she said, a little breathlessly, for she saw his  hand inside his coat, and guessed his purpose.    \"But thee will not dare to play--thee will not dare,\" she said, but more  as an invitation than a rebuke. \"Speech was denied me here, but not my  music. I find no sin in it.\"    She eagerly watched him adjust the flute. Suddenly she drew to him the  chair from the doorway, and beckoned him to sit down. She sat where she  could see the sunset.    The music floated through the room and down the hillside, a searching  sweetness.    She kept her face ever on the far hills. It went on and on. At last it  stopped. David roused himself, as from a dream. \"But it is dark!\"  he said, startled. \"It is past the time thee should be with me. My  banishment began at sunset.\"    \"Are all the sins to be thine?\" she asked calmly. She had purposely let  him play beyond the time set for their being together.    \"Good-night, Davy.\" She kissed him on the cheek. \"I will keep the music  for the sin's remembrance,\" she added, and went out into the night.          CHAPTER IV. THE CALL      \"England is in one of those passions so creditable to her moral sense,  so illustrative of her unregulated virtues. We are living in the first  excitement and horror of the news of the massacre of Christians  at Damascus. We are full of righteous and passionate indignation.  'Punish--restore the honour of the Christian nations' is the proud  appeal of prelate, prig, and philanthropist, because some hundreds of  Christians who knew their danger, yet chose to take up their abode in a  fanatical Muslim city of the East, have suffered death.\"    The meeting had been called in answer to an appeal from Exeter Hall.  Lord Eglington had been asked to speak, and these were among his closing  words.    He had seen, as he thought, an opportunity for sensation. Politicians of  both sides, the press on all hands, were thundering denunciations upon  the city of Damascus, sitting insolent and satiated in its exquisite  bloom of pear and nectarine, and the deed itself was fading into that  blank past of Eastern life where there \"are no birds in last year's  nest.\" If he voyaged with the crowd, his pennant would be lost in the  clustering sails! So he would move against the tide, and would startle,  even if he did not convince.    \"Let us not translate an inflamed religious emotion into a war,\" he  continued. \"To what good? Would it restore one single life in Damascus?  Would it bind one broken heart? Would it give light to one darkened  home? Let us have care lest we be called a nation of hypocrites. I will  neither support nor oppose the resolution presented; I will content  myself with pointing the way to a greater national self-respect.\"    Mechanically, a few people who had scarcely apprehended the full force  of his remarks began to applaud; but there came cries of \"'Sh! 'Sh!\" and  the clapping of hands suddenly stopped. For a moment there was absolute  silence, in which the chairman adjusted his glasses and fumbled with the  agenda paper in his confusion, scarcely knowing what to do. The speaker  had been expected to second the resolution, and had not done so. There  was an awkward silence. Then, in a loud whisper, some one said:    \"David, David, do thee speak.\"    It was the voice of Faith Claridge. Perturbed and anxious, she had come  to the meeting with her father. They had not slept for nights, for the  last news they had had of Benn Claridge was from the city of Damascus,  and they were full of painful apprehensions.    It was the eve of the first day of winter, and David's banishment was  over. Faith had seen David often at a distance--how often had she stood  in her window and looked up over the apricot-wall to the chair-maker's  hut on the hill! According to his penalty David had never come to  Hamley village, but had lived alone, speaking to no one, avoided by all,  working out his punishment. Only the day before the meeting he had read  of the massacre at Damascus from a newspaper which had been left on  his doorstep overnight. Elder Fairley had so far broken the covenant of  ostracism and boycott, knowing David's love for his Uncle Benn.    All that night David paced the hillside in anxiety and agitation,  and saw the sun rise upon a new world--a world of freedom, of  home-returning, yet a world which, during the past four months, had  changed so greatly that it would never seem the same again.    The sun was scarce two hours high when Faith and her father mounted the  hill to bring him"]]]
