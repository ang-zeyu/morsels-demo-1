MAGISTRATE    How terrible is it to stand here and watch them carding and winding at  will with our fate,  Witless in war as they are.    LYSISTRATA    What of us then, who ever in vain for our children must weep  Borne but to perish afar and in vain?    MAGISTRATE    Not that, O let that one memory sleep!    LYSISTRATA    Then while we should be companioned still merrily, happy as brides may,  the livelong night,  Kissing youth by, we are forced to lie single.... But leave for a moment  our pitiful plight,  It hurts even more to behold the poor maidens helpless wrinkling in  staler virginity.    MAGISTRATE    Does not a man age?    LYSISTRATA    Not in the same way. Not as a woman grows withered, grows he.  He, when returned from the war, though grey-headed, yet  if he wishes can choose out a wife.  But she has no solace save peering for omens, wretched and  lonely the rest of her life.    MAGISTRATE    But the old man will often select--    LYSISTRATA    O why not finish and die?  A bier is easy to buy,  A honey-cake I'll knead you with joy,  This garland will see you are decked.    CALONICE    I've a wreath for you too.    MYRRHINE    I also will fillet you.    LYSISTRATA    What more is lacking? Step aboard the boat.  See, Charon shouts ahoy.  You're keeping him, he wants to shove afloat.    MAGISTRATE    Outrageous insults! Thus my place to flout!  Now to my fellow-magistrates I'll go  And what you've perpetrated on me show.    LYSISTRATA    Why are you blaming us for laying you out?  Assure yourself we'll not forget to make  The third day offering early for your sake.    MAGISTRATE _retires_, LYSISTRATA _returns within_.    OLD MEN.    All men who call your loins your own, awake at last, arise  And strip to stand in readiness. For as it seems to me  Some more perilous offensive in their heads they now devise.  I'm sure a Tyranny  Like that of Hippias  In this I detect....  They mean to put us under  Themselves I suspect,  And that Laconians assembling  At Cleisthenes' house have played  A trick-of-war and provoked them  Madly to raid  The Treasury, in which term I include  The Pay for my food.    For is it not preposterous  They should talk this way to us  On a subject such as battle!    And, women as they are, about bronze bucklers dare prattle--  Make alliance with the Spartans--people I for one  Like very hungry wolves would always most sincere shun....  Some dirty game is up their sleeve,  I believe.  A Tyranny, no doubt... but they won't catch me, that know.  Henceforth on my guard I'll go,  A sword with myrtle-branches wreathed for ever in my hand,  And under arms in the Public Place I'll take my watchful stand,  Shoulder to shoulder with Aristogeiton. Now my staff I'll draw  And start at once by knocking  that shocking  Hag upon the jaw.    WOMEN.    Your own mother will not know you when you get back to the town.  But first, my friends and allies, let us lay these garments down,  And all ye fellow-citizens, hark to me while I tell  What will aid Athens well.  Just as is right, for I  Have been a sharer  In all the lavish splendour  Of the proud city.  I bore the holy vessels  At seven, then  I pounded barley  At the age of ten,  And clad in yellow robes,  Soon after this,  I was Little Bear to  Brauronian Artemis;  Then neckletted with figs,  Grown tall and pretty,  I was a Basket-bearer,  And so it's obvious I should  Give you advice that I think good,  The very best I can.  It should not prejudice my voice that I'm not born a man,  If I say something advantageous to the present situation.  For I'm taxed too, and as a toll provide men for the nation  While, miserable greybeards, you,  It is true,  Contribute nothing of any importance whatever to our needs;  But the treasure raised against the Medes  You've squandered, and do nothing in return, save that you make  Our lives and persons hazardous by some imbecile mistakes  What can you answer? Now be careful, don't arouse my spite,  Or with my slipper I'll take you napping,  faces slapping  Left and right.    MEN.    What villainies they contrive!  Come, let vengeance fall,  You that below the waist are still alive,  Off with your tunics at my call--  Naked, all.  For a man must strip to battle like a man.  No quaking, brave steps taking, careless what's ahead, white shoed,  in the nude, onward bold,  All ye who garrisoned Leipsidrion of old....  Let each one wag  As youthfully as he can,  And if he has the cause at heart  Rise at least a span.    We must take a stand and keep to it,  For if we yield the smallest bit  To their importunity.  Then nowhere from their inroads will be left to us immunity.  But they'll be building ships and soon their navies will attack us,  As Artemisia did, and seek to fight us and to sack us.  And if they mount, the Knights they'll rob  Of a job,  For everyone knows how talented they all are in the saddle,  Having long practised how to straddle;  No matter how they're jogged there up and down, they're never thrown.  Then think of Myron's painting, and each horse-backed Amazon  In combat hand-to-hand with men.... Come, on these women fall,  And in pierced wood-collars let's stick  quick  The necks of one and all.    WOMEN.    Don't cross me or I'll loose  The Beast that's kennelled here....  And soon you will be howling for a truce,  Howling out with fear.  But my dear,  Strip also, that women may battle unhindered....  But you, you'll be too sore to eat garlic more, or one black bean,  I really mean, so great's my spleen, to kick you black and blue  With these my dangerous legs.  I'll hatch the lot of you,  If my rage you dash on,  The way the relentless Beetle  Hatched the Eagle's eggs.    Scornfully aside I set  Every silly old-man threat  While Lampito's with me.  Or dear Ismenia, the noble Theban girl. Then let decree  Be hotly piled upon decree; in vain will be your labours,  You futile rogue abominated by your suffering neighbour  To Hecate's feast I yesterday went--  Off I sent  To our neighbours in Boeotia, asking as a gift to me  For them to pack immediately  That darling dainty thing ... a good fat eel [1] I meant of course;    [Footnote 1:_Vide supra_, p. 23.]    But they refused because some idiotic old decree's in force.  O this strange passion for decrees nothing on earth can check,  Till someone puts a foot out tripping you,  and slipping you  Break your neck.    LYSISTRATA _enters in dismay_.    WOMEN    Dear Mistress of our martial enterprise,  Why do you come with sorrow in your eyes?    LYSISTRATA    O 'tis our naughty femininity,  So weak in one spot, that hath saddened me.    WOMEN    What's this? Please speak.    LYSISTRATA    Poor women, O so weak!    WOMEN    What can it be? Surely your friends may know.    LYSISTRATA    Yea, I must speak it though it hurt me so.    WOMEN    Speak; can we help? Don't stand there mute in need.    LYSISTRATA    I'll blurt it out then--our women's army's mutinied.    WOMEN    O Zeus!    LYSISTRATA    What use is Zeus to our anatomy?  Here is the gaping calamity I meant:  I cannot shut their ravenous appetites  A moment more now. They are all deserting.  The first I caught was sidling through the postern  Close by the Cave of Pan: the next hoisting herself  With rope and pulley down: a third on the point  Of slipping past: while a fourth malcontent, seated  For instant flight to visit Orsilochus  On bird-back, I dragged off by the hair in time....  They are all snatching excuses to sneak home.  Look, there goes one.... Hey, what's the hurry?    1ST WOMAN    I must get home. I've some Milesian wool  Packed wasting away, and moths are pushing through it.    LYSISTRATA    Fine moths indeed, I know. Get back within.    1ST WOMAN    By the Goddesses, I'll return instantly.  I only want to stretch it on my bed.    LYSISTRATA    You shall stretch nothing and go nowhere either.    1ST WOMAN    Must I never use my wool then?    LYSISTRATA    If needs be.    2ND WOMAN    How unfortunate I am! O my poor flax!  It's left at home unstript.    LYSISTRATA    So here's another  That wishes to go home and strip her flax.  Inside again!    2ND WOMAN    No, by the Goddess of Light,  I'll be back as soon as I have flayed it properly.    LYSISTRATA    You'll not flay anything. For if you begin  There'll not be one here but has a patch to be flayed.    3RD WOMAN    O holy Eilithyia, stay this birth  Till I have left the precincts of the place!    LYSISTRATA    What nonsense is this?    3RD WOMAN    I'll drop it any minute.    LYSISTRATA    Yesterday you weren't with child.    3RD WOMAN    But I am today.  O let me find a midwife, Lysistrata.  O quickly!    LYSISTRATA    Now what story is this you tell?  What is this hard lump here?    3RD WOMAN    It's a male child.    LYSISTRATA    By Aphrodite, it isn't. Your belly's hollow,  And it has the feel of metal.... Well, I soon can see.  You hussy, it's Athene's sacred helm,  And you said you were with child.    3RD WOMAN    And so I am.    LYSISTRATA    Then why the helm?    3RD WOMAN    So if the throes should take me  Still in these grounds I could use it like a dove  As a laying-nest in which to drop the child.    LYSISTRATA    More pretexts! You can't hide your clear intent,  And anyway why not wait till the tenth day  Meditating a brazen name for your brass brat?    WOMAN    And I can't sleep a wink. My nerve is gone  Since I saw that snake-sentinel of the shrine.    WOMAN    And all those dreadful owls with their weird hooting!  Though I'm wearied out, I can't close an eye.    LYSISTRATA    You wicked women, cease from juggling lies.  You want your men. But what of them as well?  They toss as sleepless in the lonely night,  I'm sure of it. Hold out awhile, hold out,  But persevere a teeny-weeny longer.  An oracle has promised Victory  If we don't wrangle. Would you hear the words? "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/775"],[0,"When the Sleeper Wakes (#6)"],[1,"said a few indistinct words; then he walked to the  wall through which the two men had vanished. It rolled up again like a  curtain, and he stood waiting.    Graham lifted his arm and was astonished to find what strength the  restoratives had given him. He thrust one leg over the side of the couch  and then the other. His head no longer swam. He could scarcely credit  his rapid recovery. He sat feeling his limbs.    The man with the flaxen beard re-entered from the archway, and as he did  so the cage of a lift came sliding down in front of the thickset  man, and a lean, grey-bearded man, carrying a roll, and wearing a  tightly-fitting costume of dark green, appeared therein.    \"This is the tailor,\" said the thickset man with an introductory  gesture. \"It will never do for you to wear that black. I cannot  understand how it got here. But I shall. I shall. You will be as rapid  as possible?\" he said to the tailor.    The man in green bowed, and, advancing, seated himself by Graham on the  bed. His manner was calm, but his eyes were full of curiosity. \"You will  find the fashions altered, Sire,\" he said. He glanced from under his  brows at the thickset man.    He opened the roller with a quick movement, and a confusion of brilliant  fabrics poured out over his knees. \"You lived, Sire, in a period  essentially cylindrical--the Victorian. With a tendency to the  hemisphere in hats. Circular curves always. Now--\" He flicked out a  little appliance the size and appearance of a keyless watch, whirled the  knob, and behold--a little figure in white appeared kinetoscope fashion  on the dial, walking and turning. The tailor caught up a pattern of  bluish white satin. \"That is my conception of your immediate treatment,\"  he said.    The thickset man came and stood by the shoulder of Graham.    \"We have very little time,\" he said.    \"Trust me,\" said the tailor. \"My machine follows. What do you think of  this?\"    \"What is that?\" asked the man from the nineteenth century.    \"In your days they showed you a fashion-plate,\" said the tailor, \"but  this is our modern development See here.\" The little figure repeated  its evolutions, but in a different costume. \"Or this,\" and with a click  another small figure in a more voluminous type of robe marched on to  the dial. The tailor was very quick in his movements, and glanced twice  towards the lift as he did these things.    It rumbled again, and a crop-haired anaemic lad with features of the  Chinese type, clad in coarse pale blue canvas, appeared together with a  complicated machine, which he pushed noiselessly on little castors into  the room. Incontinently the little kinetoscope was dropped, Graham was  invited to stand in front of the machine and the tailor muttered some  instructions to the crop-haired lad, who answered in guttural tones and  with words Graham did not recognise. The boy then went to conduct an  incomprehensible monologue in the corner, and the tailor pulled out a  number of slotted arms terminating in little discs, pulling them out  until the discs were flat against the body of Graham, one at each  shoulder blade, one at the elbows, one at the neck and so forth, so that  at last there were, perhaps, two score of them upon his body and limbs.  At the same time, some other person entered the room by the lift,  behind Graham. The tailor set moving a mechanism that initiated a  faint-sounding rhythmic movement of parts in the machine, and in another  moment he was knocking up the levers and Graham was released. The tailor  replaced his cloak of black, and the man with the flaxen beard proffered  him a little glass of some refreshing fluid. Graham saw over the rim of  the glass a pale-faced young man regarding him with a singular fixity.      The thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully, and now turned and  went through the archway towards the balcony, from which the noise of  a distant crowd still came in gusts and cadences. The cropheaded lad  handed the tailor a roll of the bluish satin and the two began fixing  this in the mechanism in a manner reminiscent of a roll of paper in a  nineteenth century printing machine. Then they ran the entire thing on  its easy, noiseless bearings across the room to a remote corner where  a twisted cable looped rather gracefully from the wall. They made some  connexion and the machine became energetic and swift.    \"What is that doing?\" asked Graham, pointing with the empty glass to  the busy figures and trying to ignore the scrutiny of the new comer. \"Is  that--some sort of force--laid on?\"    \"Yes,\" said the man with the flaxen beard.    \"Who is that?\" He indicated the archway behind him.    The man in purple stroked his little beard, hesitated, and answered in  an undertone, \"He is Howard, your chief guardian. You see, Sire,--it's  a little difficult to explain. The Council appoints a guardian and  assistants. This hall has under certain restrictions been public. In  order that people might satisfy themselves. We have barred the doorways  for the first time. But I think--if you don't mind, I will leave him to  explain.\"    \"Odd\" said Graham. \"Guardian? Council?\" Then turning his back on the new  comer, he asked in an undertone, \"Why is this man glaring at me? Is he a  mesmerist?\"    \"Mesmerist! He is a capillotomist.\"    \"Capillotomist!\"    \"Yes--one of the chief. His yearly fee is sixdoz lions.\"    It sounded sheer nonsense. Graham snatched at the last phrase with an  unsteady mind. \"Sixdoz lions?\" he said.    \"Didn't you have lions? I suppose not. You had the old pounds? They are  our monetary units.\"    \"But what was that you said--sixdoz?\"    \"Yes. Six dozen, Sire. Of course things, even these little things,  have altered. You lived in the days of the decimal system, the Arab  system--tens, and little hundreds and thousands. We have eleven numerals  now. We have single figures for both ten and eleven, two figures for  a dozen, and a dozen dozen makes a gross, a great hundred, you know, a  dozen gross a dozand, and a dozand dozand a myriad. Very simple?\"    \"I suppose so,\" said Graham. \"But about this cap--what was it?\"    The man with the flaxen beard glanced over his shoulder.    \"Here are your clothes!\" he said. Graham turned round sharply and saw  the tailor standing at his elbow smiling, and holding some palpably new  garments over his arm. The crop-headed boy, by means of one finger,  was impelling the complicated machine towards the lift by which he had  arrived. Graham stared at the completed suit. \"You don't mean to say--!\"    \"Just made,\" said the tailor. He dropped the garments at the feet of  Graham, walked to the bed on which Graham had so recently been lying,  flung out the translucent mattress, and turned up the looking glass. As  he did so a furious bell summoned the thickset man to the corner. The  man with the flaxen beard rushed across to him and then hurried out by  the archway.    The tailor was assisting Graham into a dark purple combination garment,  stockings, vest, and pants in one, as the thickset man came back from  the corner to meet the man with the flaxen beard returning from the  balcony. They began speaking quickly in an undertone, their bearing had  an unmistakable quality of anxiety. Over the purple under-garment came a  complex but graceful garment of bluish white, and I Graham was clothed  in the fashion once more and saw himself, sallow-faced, unshaven and  shaggy still, but at least naked no longer, and in some indefinable  unprecedented way graceful.    \"I must shave,\" he said regarding himself in the glass.    \"In a moment,\" said Howard.    The persistent stare ceased. The young man closed his eyes, reopened  them, and with a lean hand extended, advanced on Graham. Then he  stopped, with his hand slowly gesticulating, and looked about him.    \"A seat,\" said Howard impatiently, and in a moment the flaxen-bearded  man had a chair behind Graham. \"Sit down, please,\" said Howard.    Graham hesitated, and in the other hand of the wildeyed man he saw the  glint of steel.    \"Don't you understand, Sire?\" cried the flaxen-bearded man with hurried  politeness. \"He is going to cut your hair.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Graham enlightened. \"But you called him--    \"A capillotomist--precisely! He is one of the finest artists in the  world.\"    Graham sat down abruptly. The flaxen-bearded man disappeared. The  capillotomist came forward with graceful gestures, examined Graham's  ears and surveyed him, felt the back of his head, and would have sat  down again to regard him but for Howard's audible impatience. Forthwith  with rapid movements and a succession of deftly handled implements he  shaved Graham's chin, clipped his moustache, and cut and arranged his  hair. All this he did without a word, with something of the rapt air of  a poet inspired. And as soon as he had finished Graham was handed a pair  of shoes.    Suddenly a loud voice shouted--it seemed from a piece of machinery in  the corner--\"At once--at once. The people know all over the city. Work  is being stopped. Work is being stopped. Wait for nothing, but come.\"    This shout appeared to perturb Howard exceedingly. By his gestures it  seemed to Graham that he hesitated between two directions. Abruptly  he went towards the corner where the apparatus stood about the little  crystal ball. As he did so the undertone of tumultuous shouting from the  archway that had continued during all these occurrences rose to a mighty  sound, roared as if it were sweeping past, and fell again as if receding  swiftly. It drew Graham after it with an irresistible attraction. He  glanced at the thickset man, and then obeyed his impulse. In two strides  he was down the steps and in the passage, and, in a score he was out  upon the balcony upon which the three men had been standing.        CHAPTER V. THE MOVING WAYS    He went to the railings of the balcony and stared upward. An exclamation  of surprise at his appearance, and the movements of a number of"]]]
