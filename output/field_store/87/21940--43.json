There is an astonishing amount to be learned from naked branches,  and, if pursued in the right way, the study will be found exceedingly  interesting. Professor Beal, in his pamphlet on the New Botany,[1] says:--    \"Before the first lesson, each pupil is furnished or told where to procure  some specimen for study. If it is winter, and flowers or growing plants  cannot be had, give each a branch of a tree or shrub; this branch may be  two feet long. The examination of these is made during the usual time for  preparing lessons, and not while the class is before the teacher. For the  first recitation each is to tell what he has discovered. The specimens are  not in sight during the recitation. In learning the lesson, books are not  used; for, if they are used, no books will contain a quarter of what the  pupil may see for himself. If there is time, each member of the class is  allowed a chance to mention anything not named by any of the rest. The  teacher may suggest a few other points for study. The pupils are not told  what they can see for themselves. An effort is made to keep them working  after something which they have not yet discovered. If two members  disagree on any point, on the next day, after further study, they are  requested to bring in all the proofs they can to sustain their different  conclusions. For a second lesson, the students review the first lesson,  and report on a branch of a tree of another species which they have  studied as before. Now they notice any point of difference or of  similarity. In like manner new branches are studied and new comparisons  made. For this purpose, naked branches of our species of elms, maples,  ashes, oaks, basswood, beech, poplars, willows, walnut, butternut,  hawthorns, cherries, and in fact any of our native or exotic trees or  shrubs are suitable. A comparison of the branches of any of the evergreens  is interesting and profitable. Discoveries, very unexpected, are almost  sure to reward a patient study of these objects. The teacher must not  think time is wasted. No real progress can be made, till the pupils begin  to learn to see; and to learn to see they must keep trying to form the  habit from the very first; and to form the habit they should make the  study of specimens the main feature in the course of training.\"    [Footnote 1: The New Botany. By W.J. Beal. Philadelphia, C.H. Marot, 814  Chestnut St., 1882. Page 5.]    HORSECHESTNUT (_AEsculus Hippocastanum_).    We will begin with the study of a branch of Horsechestnut.[1] The pupils  should examine and describe their specimens before discussing them in the  class-room. They will need some directions and hints, however, to enable  them to work to any advantage. Tell them to open both large and small  buds. It is not advisable to study the Horsechestnut bud by cutting  sections, as the wool is so dense that the arrangement cannot be seen in  this way. The scales should be removed with a knife, one by one, and the  number, texture, etc., noted. The leaves and flower-cluster will remain  uncovered and will be easy to examine. The gum may be first removed by  pressing the bud in a bit of paper. The scholars should study carefully  the markings on the stem, in order to explain, if possible, what has  caused them. The best way to make clear the meaning of the scars is to  show them the relation of the bud to the branch. They must define a bud.  Ask them what the bud would have become the next season, if it had been  allowed to develop. It would have been a branch, or a part of one. A bud,  then, is an undeveloped branch. They can always work out this definition  for themselves. Conversely, a branch is a developed bud, or series of  buds, and every mark on the branch must correspond to something in the  bud. Let them examine the specimens with this idea clearly before their  minds. The lesson to prepare should be to write out all they can observe  and to make careful drawings of their specimens. Ask them to find a way,  if possible, to tell the age of the branch.    [Footnote 1: The pupils should cut their names on their branches and keep  them. They will need them constantly for comparison and reference.]    At the recitation, the papers can be read and the points mentioned  thoroughly discussed. This will take two lesson-hours, probably, and the  drawing may be left, if desired, as the exercise to prepare for the second  recitation.    [1]The buds of Horsechestnut contain the plan of the whole growth of the  next season. They are scaly and covered, especially towards the apex, with  a sticky varnish. The scales are opposite, like the leaves. The outer  pairs are wholly brown and leathery, the succeeding ones tipped with  brown, wherever exposed, so that the whole bud is covered with a thick  coat. The inner scales are green and delicate, and somewhat woolly,  especially along the lapping edges. There are about seven pairs of  scales. The larger terminal buds have a flower-cluster in the centre, and  generally two pairs of leaves; the small buds contain leaves alone, two or  three pairs of them. The leaves are densely covered with white wool, to  protect them from the sudden changes of winter. The use of the gum is to  ward off moisture. The flower-cluster is woolly also.    [Footnote 1: All descriptions are made from specimens examined by me.  Other specimens may differ in some points. Plants vary in different  situations and localities.]    The scars on the stem are of three kinds, leaf, bud-scale, and  flower-cluster scars. The pupils should notice that the buds are always  just above the large triangular scars. If they are still in doubt as to  the cause of these marks, show them some house-plant with well-developed  buds in the axils of the leaves, and ask them to compare the position of  these buds with their branches. The buds that spring from the inner angle  of the leaf with the stem are _axillary_ buds; those that crown the stems  are _terminal_. Since a bud is an undeveloped branch, terminal buds carry,  on the axis which they crown, axillary buds give rise to side-shoots. The  leaf-scars show the leaf-arrangement and the number of leaves each year.  The leaves are opposite and each pair stands over the intervals of the  pair below. The same is observed to be true of the scales and leaves  of the bud.[1] All these points should be brought out by the actual  observation of the specimens by the pupils, with only such hints from the  teacher as may be needed to direct their attention aright. The dots on the  leaf-scar are the ends of woody bundles (fibro-vascular bundles) which, in  autumn, separated from the leaf. By counting these we can tell how many  leaflets there were in the leaf, three, five, seven, nine, or occasionally  six or eight.    [Footnote 1: Bud-scales are modified leaves and their arrangement is  therefore the same as the leaves. This is not mentioned in the study of  the Horsechestnut bud, because it cannot be proved to the pupils, but the  transition is explained in connection with Lilac, where it may be clearly  seen. The scales of the bud of Horsechestnut are considered to be  homologous with petioles, by analogy with other members of the same  family. In the Sweet Buckeye a series can be made, exhibiting the gradual  change from a scale to a compound leaf. See the Botanical Text-Book, Part  I, Structural Botany. By Asa Gray. Ivison, Blakeman, Taylor and Co., New  York, 1879. Plate 233, p. 116.]    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Horsechestnut. I. Branch in winter state: _a_,  leaf-scars; _b_, bud-scars; _c_, flower-scars. 2. An expanding leaf-bud.  3. Same, more advanced.]    _The Bud Scale-Scars_. These are rings left by the scales of the bud and  may be seen in many branches. They are well seen in Horsechestnut. If the  pupils have failed to observe that these rings show the position of former  buds and mark the growth of successive years, this point must be brought  out by skilful questioning. There is a difference in the color of the more  recent shoots, and a pupil, when asked how much of his branch grew the  preceding season, will be able to answer by observing the change in color.  Make him see that this change corresponds with the rings, and he will  understand how to tell every year's growth. Then ask what would make the  rings in a branch produced from one of his buds, and he can hardly fail to  see that the scales would make them. When the scholars understand that the  rings mark the year's growth, they can count them and ascertain the age  of each branch. The same should be done with each side-shoot. Usually the  numbers will be found to agree; that is, all the buds will have the  same number of rings between them and the cut end of the branch, but  occasionally a bud will remain latent for one or several seasons and then  begin its growth, in which case the numbers will not agree; the difference  will be the number of years it remained latent. There are always many buds  that are not developed. \"The undeveloped buds do not necessarily perish,  but are ready to be called into action in case the others are checked.  When the stronger buds are destroyed, some that would else remain dormant  develop in their stead, incited by the abundance of nourishment which the  former would have monopolized. In this manner our trees are soon reclothed  with verdure, after their tender foliage and branches have been killed by  a late vernal frost, or consumed by insects. And buds which have remained  latent for several years occasionally shoot forth into branches from the  sides of old stems, especially in certain trees.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Structural Botany, p. 48.]    The pupils can measure the distance between each set of rings on the main  stem, to see on what years it grew best.    _The Flower-Cluster Scars_. These are the round, somewhat concave, scars,  found terminating the stem where forking occurs, or seemingly in the  axils of branches, on account of one of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10738"],[0,"Mahomet, Founder of Islam (#7)"],[1,"age the lands that he remembered dimly from childhood.    Khadijah, a beautiful widow, daughter of an honoured house and the cousin  of Mahomet, rich and much sought after by the Kureisch, desired someone  to accompany her trading venture to Bostra, and hearing of the wisdom and  faithfulness of Mahomet, sent for him, asking if he would travel for her  into Syria and pursue her bargains in that northern city. She was willing  to reward him far more generously than most merchants. Mahomet, anxious  to requite his uncle in some way, and with his young imagination kindled  at the prospect of new scenes and ideas, prepared eagerly for the  journey. With one other man-servant, Meisara, he set out with the  merchandise to Bostra, traversing as a young man the same desert path he  had journeyed along in boyhood.    He was of an age to appreciate all that this experience could teach, in  the regions both of Nature and religion. The lonely desert only increased  his pervading sense of the mystery lying beyond his immediate knowledge,  and its vastness confirmed his vague belief in some kind of a power who  alone controlled so mighty a creation as the abounding spaces around him,  and the \"star-bespangled\" heaven above. On this journey, too, he first  saw with conscious eyes the desert storms in all the splendour and terror  of their fury, and caught the significance of those sudden squalls that  urge the waters of the upper Syrian lakes into a tumult of destruction.  Frequent allusions to sea and lake storms are to be found in the earlier  part of the Kuran: \"When the seas shall be commingled, when the seas  shall boil, then shall man tremble before his creator.\" \"By the swollen  sea, verily a chastisement from thy Lord is imminent.\" In every natural  manifestation that struck Mahomet's imagination in these early days, God  appeared to him as the sovereign of power, as terrible and as remote as  He was in the lightnings on Sinai. What wonder, then, that when the call  came to him to take up his mission it became a command to \"arise and  warn\"?    The chroniclers would have us believe that his contact with Christianity  was more important than his communion with Nature. Most of the legends  surrounding his relations with Christian Syria may be safely accepted as  later additions, but it is certain that he paid some attention to the  religion of those people through whose country he passed. A Syrian monk  is said to have seen Mahomet sitting beneath a tree, and to have hailed  him as a prophet; there is even a traditional account of an interview  with Nestorius, but this must be set aside at once as pure fiction.    The kernel of these legends seems to be the desire to show that Mahomet  had studied Christianity, and was not imposing a new religion without  having considered the potentialities of those already existing. However  that may be, Christianity certainly interested Mahomet, and must have  influenced him towards the monotheistic idea. The Arabians themselves  were not entirely ignorant of it; they witnessed the worship of one God  by the Jews and Christians on the borders of their territory, and  although it is a very debatable point how far the idea of one God had  progressed in Arabia when Mahomet began his mission, it may fairly be  accepted that dissatisfaction with the old tribal gods was not wanting.  Mahomet saw the countries through which he passed in a state of religious  flux, and heard around him diverse creeds, detecting doubtless an  undercurrent of unrest and a desire for some religion of more compelling  power.    With the single slave he reached Bostra in safety with the merchandise,  and having concluded his barter very successfully, and retaining in his  mind many impressions of that crowded city, returned to Mecca by the same  desert route. Meisara, the slave, relates (in what is doubtless a later  addition) of the fierce noonday heat that beset the travellers, and how,  when Mahomet was almost exhausted, two angels sat on his camel and  protected him with their wings. When they reached Mecca, Khadijah sold  the merchandise and found her wealth doubled, so careful had Mahomet been  to ensure the prosperity of his client, and before long love grew up in  her heart for this tall, grave youth, who was faithful in small things as  well as in great.    Khadijah had been much sought after by the men of Mecca, both for her  riches and for her beauty, but she had preferred to remain independent,  and continued her orderly life among her maidens, attending to her  household, and finding enough occupation in the supervision of her many  mercantile ventures. She was about forty, fair of countenance, and gifted  with a rich nature, whose leading qualities were affection and sympathy.  She seems to have been pre-eminently one of those receptive women who are  good to consult for the clarification of ideas. Her intelligence was  quick to grasp another's thought, if she did not originate thought within  herself. She was a woman fitted to be the helper and guide of such a man  as Mahomet, eager, impulsive, prone to swiftly alternating extremes of  depression and elation. A subtle mental attraction drew them together,  and Khadijah divined intuitively the power lying within the mind of this  youth and also his need of her, both mentally and materially, to enable  him to realise his whole self. Therefore as she was the first to awaken  to her desire for him, the first advances come from her.    She sent her sister to Mahomet to induce him to change his mind upon the  subject of marriage, and when he found that the rich and gracious  Khadijah offered him her hand, he could not believe his good fortune, and  assured the sister that he was eager to make her his wife. The alliance,  in spite of its personal suitability, was far from being advantageous to  Khadijah from a worldly point of view, and the traditions of how her  father's consent was obtained have all the savour of contemporary  evidence.    The father was bidden to a feast, and there plied right royally with  wine. When his reason returned he asked the meaning of the great spread  of viands, the canopy, and the chapleted heads of the guests. Thereupon  he was told it was the marriage-feast of Mahomet and Khadijah, and his  wrath and amazement were great, for had he not by his presence given  sanction to the nuptials? The incident throws some light upon the  marriage laws current at the time. Khadijah, though forty and a widow,  was still under the guardianship of her father, having passed to him  after the death of her husband, and his consent was needed before she  married again.    The marriage contracted by mutual desire was followed by a time of leisure  and happiness, which Mahomet remembered all his life. Never did any man  feel his marriage gift (in Mahomet's case twenty young camels) more fitly  given than the youth whom Khudijah rescued from poverty, and to whom she  gave the boon of her companionship and counsel. The marriage was fruitful;  two sons were born, the eldest Kasim, wherefore Mahomet received the title  of Abu-el-Kasim, the father of Kasim, but both these died in infancy.  There were also four daughters born to Mahomet--Zeineb, Rockeya, Umm  Kolthum, and Fatima. These were important later on for the marriages they  contracted with Mahomet's supporters, and indeed his whole position was  considerably solidified by the alliances between his daughters and his  chief adherents.    Ten years passed thus in prosperity and study. Mahomet was no longer  obscure but the chief of a wealthy house, revered for his piety, and  looked upon already as one of those \"to whom God whispers in the ear.\"  His character now exhibited more than ever the marks of the poet and  seer; the time was at hand when all the subdued enthusiasm of his mind  was to break forth in the opening Suras of the Kuran. The inspiration had  not yet descended upon him, but it was imminent, and the shadow of its  stern requirements was about him as he attended to his work of  supervising Khadijah's wealth or took part in the religious life of  Mecca.    In A.D. 605, when Mahomet was thirty-five years old, the chief men of  Mecca decided to rebuild the Kaaba. The story of its rebuilding is  perhaps the most interesting of the many strange, naive tales of this  adventurous city. Valley floods had shattered the house of the gods. It  was roofless, and so insecure that its treasury had already been rifled  by blasphemous men. It stood only as high as the stature of a man, and  was made simply of stones laid one above the other. Rebuilding was  absolutely necessary, but materials were needed before the work could  begin, and this delayed the Kureisch until chance provided them with  means of accomplishing their design. A Grecian ship had been driven in a  Red Sea storm upon the coast near Mecca and was rapidly being broken up.  When the Kureisch heard of it, they set out in a body to the seashore and  took away the wood of the ship to build a roof for the Kaaba. It is a  significant fact that tradition puts a Greek carpenter in Mecca who was  able to advise them as to the construction. The Meccans themselves were  not sufficiently skilled in the art of building.    But now a great difficulty awaited them. Who was to undertake the  responsibility of demolishing so holy a place, even if it were only that  it might be rebuilt more fittingly? Many legends cluster round the  demolition. It would seem that the gods only understood gradually that a  complete destruction of the Kaaba was not intended. Their opposition was  at first implacable. The loosened stones flew back into their places, and  finally none could be induced to make the attempt to pull down the Kaaba.  There was a pause in the work, during which no one dared venture near the  temple, then Al-Welid, being a bold and god-fearing spirit, took an axe,  and crying:    \"I will make a beginning, let no evil ensue, O"]]]
