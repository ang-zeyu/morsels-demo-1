Cloudy morning, with prospect of  rain. A swan visited the water hole last night, and to-day we have seen  both the mountain duck and the large black duck. Having a shoe to fix  upon Jersey, and my courses to map down, we did not get a start until 10  o'clock, and we were obliged to stop early in consequence of the grey  mare getting so lame that we were unable to proceed. We had an old shoe  or two, and Mr. Forster managed to get one on the mare. We started to-day  on a bearing of 270 degrees for eight miles to a low flat-topped hill,  when we changed to 220 degrees for five miles to a gum creek with rain  water. About five miles to the north of our line there are flat-topped  ranges, running north-east. The main creek runs on the south side of this  course, and nearly parallel to it. Further to the south, at a distance of  about ten miles, is still the stony table land with the sand hills. The  country is fearfully stony, but improves a little in grass as we get  west. It seems to be well watered. Distance to-day, about twelve miles.    Monday, 28th June, Gum Creek. There has been a little rain during the  night, and it is still coming down. As I am so far north, I regret that I  am unable to go a little further, fearing the lameness of the horses from  the stony nature of the country. I intend to follow the creek up, if it  comes from the west, or a little to the north of west, to see if I cannot  make the fall of the country to the south-west, and get on a better road  for the horses. We started on a bearing of 305 degrees, but after a mile  and a half, finding the creek wind too much to the north, we changed our  course to 287 degrees for five miles to a small flat-topped hill. Changed  our bearing again to 281 degrees for twenty-two miles to a tent hill, on  the south side of which we camped. This part of the country is very stony  and bad, with salt bush and very little grass. It has evidently been the  course of a large water at some time, and reminded me of the stony desert  of Captain Sturt. Bleak, barren, and desolate, it grows no timber, so  that we scarcely can find sufficient wood to boil our quart pot. The  rain, which poured down upon us all day, so softened the ground that the  horses could tread the stones into it, and we got along much better than  we expected. Distance to-day, twenty-eight miles and a half.    Tuesday, 29th June, South Side of Tent Hill. Started at 8.30 a.m. on a  bearing of 305 degrees. At eight miles crossed a gum creek, with  polyganum, running to the north. At twelve miles crossed another,  trending in the same direction. These creeks are wide and formed into  numerous channels. I expected to have done thirty miles to-day, but am  disappointed, for we were obliged to halt early, after having gone only  eighteen miles, as my horse was quite lame. How much do we feel the want  of another set of horse-shoes! We have, however, still got an old shoe  left, which is put on this afternoon. It had continued raining all last  night, but not heavily, and cleared off in the morning shortly after we  started. Our travelling to-day has been still very stony, over stony  rises; the stony table land that has been all along on our left is now  trending more to the south-west. The country is more open: in looking at  it from one of the rises it has the appearance of an immense plain,  studded with isolated flat-topped hills. The last eight miles is better  grassed and has more salt bush. Camped on a small creek in the stony  rises. Distance to-day, eighteen miles.    Wednesday, 30th June, Stony Rises. We had a little rain in the former  part of the night, and a very heavy dew in the morning. Started at 9.30  a.m., bearing 305 degrees; at five miles crossed the upper part of a gum  creek, and at twelve miles ascended a high flat-topped hill, commanding a  view of an immense stony plain, but it is so hazy that we can see nothing  beyond ten miles. From this hill we changed our course to 309 degrees to  a saddle in the next range. At four miles halted at a gum creek, with  plenty of green feed. Made a very short journey to-day in consequence of  the horses being quite lame. In addition to their want of shoes, a stiff,  tenacious brown clay adhered to the hoof, and picked up the small round  stones, which pressed on the frog of the foot. These pebbles were as  firmly packed as if they had been put in with cement, so that we had hard  work to keep the hoofs clear. Distance travelled, sixteen miles. Weather  showery.    Thursday, 1st July, Gum Greek. The horses have had such poor food for the  last week that I shall rest them to-day. About half a mile below us there  is a large water hole a quarter of a mile long, with a number of black  ducks upon it, but they are very shy. It rained very heavily and without  intermission all last night and to-day. This creek is visited by a great  many natives. We saw them making away as we approached.    Friday, 2nd July, Same Place. The creek came down last night: it is now a  sheet of water two hundred yards broad. Started at 8.45 a.m. over a stony  plain on a bearing of 309 degrees, to the saddle in the range. I ascended  one of the highest hills in this range, but the day was too dull to see  far. I could, however, distinguish what appeared to be a wooded country*  in the distance, from south-west to north-east. (* This \"wooded country\"  afterwards turned out to be sand hills, with scrub.) Observing that the  country a little more to the north was less stony, I changed our course  to a bearing of 344 degrees, over a plain thinly covered with gravelly  stones, consisting of quartz, ironstone, and a dark reddish-brown stone,  with a good deal of gypsum cropping out. The soil is of a light-brown  colour, with plenty of dry grass upon it, and very little salt bush. In  the spring time it must look beautiful. The country was so boggy from the  heavy rains, that for the sake of my horse I was obliged to stop early.  Camped at a gum creek coming from the south-west, and running a little to  the east of north. Distance to-day, eighteen miles.    Sunday, 4th July, Same Place. Not the slightest appearance of a change.  It rained in torrents all night and all day, though at sundown it seemed  to be breaking a little. The creek came down in the forenoon, overflowed  its banks, and left us on an island before we knew what we were about. We  were obliged to seek a higher place. Not content with depriving us of our  first worley, it has now forced us to retreat to a bare hill, without any  protection from the weather. The rain has come from the north-east.    Monday, 5th July, Same Place. The rain lasted the greater part of the  night, but became light before morning. Started at 12.30 on a bearing of  312 degrees for eleven miles to some sand hills. A fearfully hard day's  work for the poor horses over a stony plain, sinking up to their knees in  mud, until at eight miles we crossed a reedy swamp two miles in breadth,  and how many in length I know not, for it seemed all one sheet of water:  it took our horses up to their bellies.    Tuesday, 6th July, Sand Hills. All our rations and everything we have got  being perfectly saturated with wet, I have made up my mind to stop and  put them to rights; if we neglect them it will soon be all over with us.  This was a beautiful day, not a cloud to be seen. There are a great many  natives' tracks in these sand hills, and plenty of grass.    Wednesday, 7th July, Sand Hills. Heavy dew last night. Started on a  bearing of 312 degrees at 9 a.m. At eleven miles the sand hills cease,  and stony plain commences. The sand hills were well grassed: also the  stony plain. Dip of the country still north-east. We crossed two  watercourses--one at this side of the plain, and the other two miles  back, broad and shallow. I could see gum-trees on the latter about two  miles to the north-east as if it formed itself into a deeper channel.  Travelling very heavy. Distance to-day, twenty-five miles.    Thursday, 8th July, Sand Hills. A very heavy dew again last night.  Started at 9 a.m. At one mile we came on yesterday's course; could see  nothing; changed the bearing to 272 degrees. At seven miles crossed a  creek running north and a little west, the water being up to our  saddle-flaps. At twelve miles the sand hills ceased, and we came upon an  elevated plain, of a light-brown soil, with fragments of stone on the  surface. At twenty-five miles, in the middle of this plain, we camped,  without wood, and in sight of a large range in the far distance to the  west. Distance to-day, twenty-five miles.    Friday, 9th July, Large Plain. Left our camp at 8.50 a.m. on the same  bearing as yesterday, 272 degrees. At one mile and half came upon a creek  of water, seemingly permanent. Judging from the immense quantity of dry  grass that is strewn over the plain, this must be a beautiful country in  spring. The dip of the country is to the north and west. Our horses are  all very lame for want of shoes, and the boggy state of the soil to-day  has tried them severely. If the country does not become less stony, I  shall be compelled to leave some of them behind. We camped on a gum creek  about three miles to the west of the range. My only hope now of cutting  Cooper's Creek is on the other side of the range. The plain we crossed  to-day resembles those of the Cooper, also the grasses; if it is not  there, it must run to the north-west, and form the Glenelg of Captain  Grey. Distance to-day, twenty-one miles.    Saturday, 10th July, Gum Creek, West End of Large Stony Plain. Rested the  horses to-day. This evening we were surprised to hear a dog barking* at  the grey mare; its colour was black and tan. (* It is commonly supposed  that the native dingo or wild dog does not bark. This is an error. The  dog in this instance being black and tan, was probably a hybrid. (See  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8914"],[0,"England, My England (#6)"],[1,"gorse was dying to seed, and  the bits of cat-heather were coming pink in tufts, like a sprinkling of  sacrificial blood.    His heart went back to the savage old spirit of the place: the desire  for old gods, old, lost passions, the passion of the cold-blooded,  darting snakes that hissed and shot away from him, the mystery of  blood-sacrifices, all the lost, intense sensations of the primeval people  of the place, whose passions seethed in the air still, from those long  days before the Romans came. The seethe of a lost, dark passion in the  air. The presence of unseen snakes.    A queer, baffled, half-wicked look came on his face. He could not  stay long at the cottage. Suddenly he must swing on to his bicycle and  go--anywhere. Anywhere, away from the place. He would stay a few days  with his mother in the old home. His mother adored him and grieved as a  mother would. But the little, baffled, half-wicked smile curled on his  face, and he swung away from his mother's solicitude as from everything  else.    Always moving on--from place to place, friend to friend: and always  swinging away from sympathy. As soon as sympathy, like a soft hand, was  reached out to touch him, away he swerved, instinctively, as a harmless  snake swerves and swerves and swerves away from an outstretched hand.  Away he must go. And periodically he went back to Winifred.    He was terrible to her now, like a temptation. She had devoted herself to  her children and her church. Joyce was once more on her feet; but, alas!  lame, with iron supports to her leg, and a little crutch. It was strange  how she had grown into a long, pallid, wild little thing. Strange that  the pain had not made her soft and docile, but had brought out a wild,  almost maenad temper in the child. She was seven, and long and white and  thin, but by no means subdued. Her blonde hair was darkening. She still  had long sufferings to face, and, in her own childish consciousness, the  stigma of her lameness to bear.    And she bore it. An almost maenad courage seemed to possess her, as if  she were a long, thin, young weapon of life. She acknowledged all her  mother's care. She would stand by her mother for ever. But some of her  father's fine-tempered desperation flashed in her.    When Egbert saw his little girl limping horribly--not only limping but  lurching horribly in crippled, childish way, his heart again hardened  with chagrin, like steel that is tempered again. There was a tacit  understanding between him and his little girl: not what we would call  love, but a weapon-like kinship. There was a tiny touch of irony in his  manner towards her, contrasting sharply with Winifred's heavy, unleavened  solicitude and care. The child flickered back to him with an answering  little smile of irony and recklessness: an odd flippancy which made  Winifred only the more sombre and earnest.    The Marshalls took endless thought and trouble for the child, searching  out every means to save her limb and her active freedom. They spared no  effort and no money, they spared no strength of will. With all their  slow, heavy power of will they willed that Joyce should save her liberty  of movement, should win back her wild, free grace. Even if it took a long  time to recover, it should be recovered.    So the situation stood. And Joyce submitted, week after week, month after  month to the tyranny and pain of the treatment. She acknowledged the  honourable effort on her behalf. But her flamy reckless spirit was her  father's. It was he who had all the glamour for her. He and she were like  members of some forbidden secret society who know one another but may not  recognize one another. Knowledge they had in common, the same secret of  life, the father and the child. But the child stayed in the camp of her  mother, honourably, and the father wandered outside like Ishmael, only  coming sometimes to sit in the home for an hour or two, an evening or two  beside the camp fire, like Ishmael, in a curious silence and tension,  with the mocking answer of the desert speaking out of his silence, and  annulling the whole convention of the domestic home.    His presence was almost an anguish to Winifred. She prayed against it.  That little cleft between his brow, that flickering, wicked, little smile  that seemed to haunt his face, and above all, the triumphant loneliness,  the Ishmael quality. And then the erectness of his supple body, like a  symbol. The very way he stood, so quiet, so insidious, like an erect,  supple symbol of life, the living body, confronting her downcast soul,  was torture to her. He was like a supple living idol moving before her  eyes, and she felt if she watched him she was damned.    And he came and made himself at home in her little home. When he was  there, moving in his own quiet way, she felt as if the whole great law of  sacrifice, by which she had elected to live, were annulled. He annulled  by his very presence the laws of her life. And what did he substitute?  Ah, against that question she hardened herself in recoil.    It was awful to her to have to have him about--moving about in his  shirt-sleeves, speaking in his tenor, throaty voice to the children.  Annabel simply adored him, and he teased the little girl. The baby,  Barbara, was not sure of him. She had been born a stranger to him. But  even the nurse, when she saw his white shoulder of flesh through the  slits of his torn shirt, thought it a shame.    Winifred felt it was only another weapon of his against her.    'You have other shirts--why do you wear that old one that is all torn,  Egbert?' she said.    'I may as well wear it out,' he said subtly.    He knew she would not offer to mend it for him. She _could_ not. And no,  she would not. Had she not her own gods to honour? And could she betray  them, submitting to his Baal and Ashtaroth? And it was terrible to her,  his unsheathed presence, that seemed to annul her and her faith, like  another revelation. Like a gleaming idol evoked against her, a vivid  life-idol that might triumph.    He came and he went--and she persisted. And then the great war broke out.  He was a man who could not go to the dogs. He could not dissipate  himself. He was pure-bred in his Englishness, and even when he would have  killed to be vicious, he could not.    So when the war broke out his whole instinct was against it: against war.  He had not the faintest desire to overcome any foreigners or to help in  their death. He had no conception of Imperial England, and Rule Britannia  was just a joke to him. He was a pure-blooded Englishman, perfect in his  race, and when he was truly himself he could no more have been aggressive  on the score of his Englishness than a rose can be aggressive on the  score of its rosiness.    No, he had no desire to defy Germany and to exalt England. The  distinction between German and English was not for him the distinction  between good and bad. It was the distinction between blue water-flowers  and red or white bush-blossoms: just difference. The difference between  the wild boar and the wild bear. And a man was good or bad according to  his nature, not according to his nationality.    Egbert was well-bred, and this was part of his natural understanding. It  was merely unnatural to him to hate a nation _en bloc_. Certain  individuals he disliked, and others he liked, and the mass he knew  nothing about. Certain deeds he disliked, certain deeds seemed natural to  him, and about most deeds he had no particular feeling.    He had, however, the one deepest pure-bred instinct. He recoiled  inevitably from having his feelings dictated to him by the mass feeling.  His feelings were his own, his understanding was his own, and he would  never go back on either, willingly. Shall a man become inferior to his  own true knowledge and self, just because the mob expects it of him?    What Egbert felt subtly and without question, his father-in-law felt also  in a rough, more combative way. Different as the two men were, they were  two real Englishmen, and their instincts were almost the same.    And Godfrey Marshall had the world to reckon with. There was German  military aggression, and the English non-military idea of liberty and the  'conquests of peace'--meaning industrialism. Even if the choice between  militarism and industrialism were a choice of evils, the elderly man  asserted his choice of the latter, perforce. He whose soul was quick with  the instinct of power.    Egbert just refused to reckon with the world. He just refused even to  decide between German militarism and British industrialism. He chose  neither. As for atrocities, he despised the people who committed them as  inferior criminal types. There was nothing national about crime.    And yet, war! War! Just war! Not right or wrong, but just war itself.  Should he join? Should he give himself over to war? The question was in  his mind for some weeks. Not because he thought England was right and  Germany wrong. Probably Germany was wrong, but he refused to make a  choice. Not because he felt inspired. No. But just--war.    The deterrent was, the giving himself over into the power of other men,  and into the power of the mob-spirit of a democratic army. Should he give  himself over? Should he make over his own life and body to the control of  something which he _knew_ was inferior, in spirit, to his own self?  Should he commit himself into the power of an inferior control? Should  he? Should he betray himself?    He was going to put himself into the power of his inferiors, and he knew  it. He was going to subjugate himself. He was going to be ordered about  by petty _canaille_ of non-commissioned officers--and even commissioned  officers. He who was born and bred free. Should he do it?    He went to his wife, to speak to her.    'Shall I join up, Winifred?'    She was silent. Her instinct also was dead against it. And yet a certain  profound resentment made her answer:    'You have "]]]
