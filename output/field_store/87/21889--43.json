I  can signal for help by pounding on the sides of the tank with the  wrench. The blows will carry a good deal farther than my voice would.\"  Every one knows how far the noise of a boiler shop, with hammers  falling on steel plates, can be heard; much farther than can a human  voice.    Tom began a lusty tattoo on the metal sides of the tank.  At first he  merely rattled out blow after blow, and then, as another thought came  to him, he adopted a certain plan. Some time previous, when he and Mr.  Sharp had planned their trip in the air, the two had adopted a code of  signals. As it was difficult in a high wind to shout from one end of  the airship to the other, the young inventor would sometimes pound on  the pipe which ran from the pilot house of the Red Cloud to the  engine-room. By a combination of numbers, simple messages could be  conveyed. The code included a call for help. Forty-seven was the  number, but there had never been any occasion to use it.    Tom remembered this now. At once he ceased his indiscriminate  hammering, and began to beat out regularly--one, two, three, four--then  a pause, and seven blows would be given. Over and over again he rang  out this number--forty seven--the call for help.    \"If Mr. Sharp only comes back he will hear that, even in the house,\"  thought poor Tom \"Maybe Garret or Mrs. Baggert will hear it, too, but  they won't know what it means.  They'll think I'm just working on the  submarine.\"    It seemed several hours to Tom that he pounded out that cry for aid,  but, as he afterward learned, it was only a little over an hour. Signal  after signal he sent vibrating from the steel sides of the tank. When  one arm tired he would use the other. He grew weary, his head was  aching, and there was a ringing in his ears; a ringing that seemed as  if ten thousand bells were jangling out their peals, and he could  barely distinguish his own pounding.    Signal after signal he sounded. It was becoming like a dream to him,  when suddenly, as he paused for a rest, he heard his name called  faintly, as if far away.    \"Tom! Tom! Where are you?\"    It was the voice of Mr. Sharp. Then followed the tones of the aged  inventor.    \"My poor boy! Tom, are you still alive?\"    \"Yes, dad! In the starboard tank!\" the lad gasped out, and then he lost  his senses. When he revived he was lying on a pile of bagging in the  submarine shop, and his father and the aeronaut were bending over him.    \"Are you all right, Tom?\" asked Mr. Swift.    \"Yes--I--I guess so,\" was the hesitating answer. \"Yes,\" the lad added,  as the fresh air cleared his head. \"I'll be all right pretty soon. Have  you seen Andy Foger?\"    \"Did he shut you in there?\" demanded Mr. Swift.    Tom nodded.    \"I'll have him arrested!\" declared Mr. Swift. \"I'll go to town as soon  as you're in good shape again and notify the police.\"    \"No, don't,\" pleaded Tom. \"I'll take care of Andy myself.  I don't  really believe he knew how serious it was. I'll settle with him later,  though.\"    \"Well, it came mighty near being serious,\" remarked Mr. Sharp grimly.  \"Your father and I came back a little sooner than we expected, and as  soon as I got near the house I heard your signal. I knew what it was in  a moment. There were Mrs. Baggert and Garret talking away, and when I  asked them why they didn't answer your call they said they thought you  were merely tinkering with the machinery. But I knew better. It's the  first time we ever had a use for 'forty-seven,' Tom.\"    \"And I hope it will be the last,\" replied the young inventor with a  faint smile. \"But I'd like to know what Andy Foger is doing in this  neighborhood.\"    Tom was soon himself again and able to go to the house, where he found  Mrs. Baggert brewing a big basin of catnip tea, under the impression  that it would in some way be good for him. She could not forgive  herself for not having answered his signal, and as for Mr. Jackson, he  had started for a doctor as soon as he learned that Tom was shut up in  the tank. The services of the medical man were canceled by telephone,  as there was no need for him, and the engineer came back to the house.    Tom was fully himself the next day, and aided his father and Mr. Sharp  in putting the finishing touches to the Advance. It was found that some  alteration was required in the auxiliary propellers, and this, much to  the regret of the young inventor, would necessitate postponing the  trial a few days.    \"But we'll have her in the water next Friday,\" promised Mr. Swift.    \"Aren't you superstitious about Friday?\" asked the balloonist.    \"Not a bit of it,\" replied the aged inventor. \"Tom,\" he added, \"I wish  you would go in the house and get me the roll of blueprints you'll find  on my desk.\"    As the lad neared the cottage he saw, standing in front of the place, a  small automobile. A man had just descended from it, and it needed but a  glance to show that he was Mr. Addison Berg.    \"Ah, good morning, Mr. Swift,\" greeted Mr. Berg. \"I wish to see your  father, but as I don't wish to lay myself open to suspicions by  entering the shop, perhaps you will ask him to step here.\"    \"Certainly,\" answered the lad, wondering why the agent had returned.  Getting the blueprints, and asking Mr. Berg to sit down on the porch,  Tom delivered the message.    \"You come back with me, Tom,\" said his father. \"I want you to be a  witness to what he says. I'm not going to get into trouble with these  people.\"    Mr. Berg came to the point at once.    \"Mr. Swift,\" he said, \"I wish you would reconsider your determination  not to enter the Government trials. I'd like to see you compete. So  would my firm.\"    \"There is no use going over that again,\" replied the aged inventor. \"I  have another object in view now than trying for the Government prize.  What it is I can't say, but it may develop in time--if we are  successful,\" and he looked at his son, smiling the while.    Mr. Berg tried to argue, but it was of no avail. Then he changed his  manner, and said:    \"Well, since you won't, you won't, I suppose. I'll go back and report  to my firm.  Have you anything special to do this morning?\" he went on  to Tom.    \"Well, I can always find something to keep me busy,\" replied the lad,  \"but as for anything special--\"    \"I thought perhaps you'd like to go for a trip in my auto,\" interrupted  Mr. Berg. \"I had asked a young man who is stopping at the same hotel  where I am to accompany me, but he has unexpectedly left, and I don't  like to go alone. His name was--let me see. I have a wretched memory  for names, but it was something like Roger or Moger.\"    \"Foger!\" cried Tom. \"Was it Andy Foger?\"    \"Yes, that was it. Why, do you know him?\" asked Mr. Berg in some  surprise.    \"I should say so,\" replied Tom. \"He was the cause of what might have  resulted in something serious for me,\" and the lad explained about  being imprisoned in the tank.    \"You don't tell me!\" cried Mr. Berg. \"I had no idea he was that kind of  a lad. You see, his father is one of the directors of the firm by whom  I am employed. Andy came from home to spend a few weeks at the seaside,  and stopped at the same hotel that I did. He went off yesterday  afternoon, and I haven't seen him since, though he promised to go for a  ride with me. He must have come over here and entered your shop  unobserved. I remember now he asked me where the submarine was being  built that was going to compete with our firm's, and I told him. I  didn't think he was that kind of a lad. Well, since he's probably gone  back home, perhaps you will come for a ride with me, Tom.\"    \"I'm afraid I can't go, thank you,\" answered the lad. \"We are very busy  getting our submarine in shape for a trial.  But I can imagine why Andy  left so hurriedly. He probably learned that a doctor had been summoned  for me, though, as it happened, I didn't need one. But Andy probably  got frightened at what he had done, and left. I'll make him more sorry,  when I meet him.\"    \"Don't blame you a bit,\" commented Mr. Berg. \"Well, I must be getting  back.\"    He hastened out to his auto, while Tom and his father watched the agent.    \"Tom, never trust that man,\" advised the aged inventor solemnly.    \"Just what I was about to remark,\" said his son. \"Well, let's get back  to work. Queer that he should come here again, and it's queer about  Andy Foger.\"    Father and son returned to the machine shop, while Mr. Berg puffed away  in his auto. A little later, Tom having occasion to go to a building  near the boundary line of the cottage property which his father had  hired for the season, saw, through the hedge that bordered it, an  automobile standing in the road. A second glance showed him that it was  Mr. Berg's machine. Something had gone wrong with it, and the agent had  alighted to make an adjustment.    The young inventor was close to the man, though the latter was unaware  of his presence.    \"Hang it all!\" Tom heard Mr. Berg exclaim to himself. \"I wonder what  they can be up to? They won't enter the Government contests, and they  won't say why. I believe they're up to some game, and I've got to find  out what it is. I wonder if I couldn't use this Foger chap?\"    \"He seems to have it in for this Tom Swift,\" Mr. Berg went on, still  talking to himself, though not so low but that Tom could hear him. \"I  think I'll try it. I'll get Andy Foger to sneak around and find out  what the game is. He'll do it, I know.\"    By this time the auto was in working order again, and the agent took  his seat and started off.    \"So that's how matters lie, eh?\" thought Tom. \"Well, Mr. Berg, we'll be  doubly on the lookout for you after this. As for Andy Foger, I think  I'll make him wish he'd never locked me in that tank. So you expect to  find out our 'game,' eh, Mr. Berg? Well, when you do know it, I think  it will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#6)"],[1,"another word for the King, began at once to  instruct me most minutely in the history of my past life, of my family,  of my tastes, pursuits, weaknesses, friends, companions, and servants.  He told me the etiquette of the Ruritanian Court, promising to be  constantly at my elbow to point out everybody whom I ought to know, and  give me hints with what degree of favour to greet them.    \"By the way,\" he said, \"you're a Catholic, I suppose?\"    \"Not I,\" I answered.    \"Lord, he's a heretic!\" groaned Sapt, and forthwith he fell to a  rudimentary lesson in the practices and observances of the Romish faith.    \"Luckily,\" said he, \"you won't be expected to know much, for the King's  notoriously lax and careless about such matters. But you must be as  civil as butter to the Cardinal. We hope to win him over, because he and  Michael have a standing quarrel about their precedence.\"    We were by now at the station. Fritz had recovered nerve enough to  explain to the astonished station master that the King had changed his  plans. The train steamed up. We got into a first-class carriage, and  Sapt, leaning back on the cushions, went on with his lesson. I looked at  my watch--the King's watch it was, of course. It was just eight.    \"I wonder if they've gone to look for us,\" I said.    \"I hope they won't find the King,\" said Fritz nervously, and this time  it was Sapt who shrugged his shoulders.    The train travelled well, and at half-past nine, looking out of the  window, I saw the towers and spires of a great city.    \"Your capital, my liege,\" grinned old Sapt, with a wave of his hand,  and, leaning forward, he laid his finger on my pulse. \"A little too  quick,\" said he, in his grumbling tone.    \"I'm not made of stone!\" I exclaimed.    \"You'll do,\" said he, with a nod. \"We must say Fritz here has caught the  ague. Drain your flask, Fritz, for heaven's sake, boy!\"    Fritz did as he was bid.    \"We're an hour early,\" said Sapt. \"We'll send word forward for your  Majesty's arrival, for there'll be no one here to meet us yet. And  meanwhile--\"    \"Meanwhile,\" said I, \"the King'll be hanged if he doesn't have some  breakfast.\"    Old Sapt chuckled, and held out his hand.    \"You're an Elphberg, every inch of you,\" said he. Then he paused, and  looking at us, said quietly, \"God send we may be alive tonight!\"    \"Amen!\" said Fritz von Tarlenheim.    The train stopped. Fritz and Sapt leapt out, uncovered, and held the  door for me. I choked down a lump that rose in my throat, settled my  helmet firmly on my head, and (I'm not ashamed to say it) breathed a  short prayer to God. Then I stepped on the platform of the station at  Strelsau.    A moment later, all was bustle and confusion: men hurrying up, hats  in hand, and hurrying off again; men conducting me to the buffet; men  mounting and riding in hot haste to the quarters of the troops, to the  Cathedral, to the residence of Duke Michael. Even as I swallowed the  last drop of my cup of coffee, the bells throughout all the city broke  out into a joyful peal, and the sound of a military band and of men  cheering smote upon my ear.    King Rudolf the Fifth was in his good city of Strelsau! And they shouted  outside--    \"God save the King!\"    Old Sapt's mouth wrinkled into a smile.    \"God save 'em both!\" he whispered. \"Courage, lad!\" and I felt his hand  press my knee.          CHAPTER 5    The Adventures of an Understudy      With Fritz von Tarlenheim and Colonel Sapt close behind me, I stepped  out of the buffet on to the platform. The last thing I did was to feel  if my revolver were handy and my sword loose in the scabbard. A gay  group of officers and high dignitaries stood awaiting me, at their head  a tall old man, covered with medals, and of military bearing. He wore  the yellow and red ribbon of the Red Rose of Ruritania--which, by the  way, decorated my unworthy breast also.    \"Marshal Strakencz,\" whispered Sapt, and I knew that I was in the  presence of the most famous veteran of the Ruritanian army.    Just behind the Marshal stood a short spare man, in flowing robes of  black and crimson.    \"The Chancellor of the Kingdom,\" whispered Sapt.    The Marshal greeted me in a few loyal words, and proceeded to deliver  an apology from the Duke of Strelsau. The duke, it seemed, had been  afflicted with a sudden indisposition which made it impossible for him  to come to the station, but he craved leave to await his Majesty at the  Cathedral. I expressed my concern, accepted the Marshal's excuses very  suavely, and received the compliments of a large number of distinguished  personages. No one betrayed the least suspicion, and I felt my nerve  returning and the agitated beating of my heart subsiding. But Fritz  was still pale, and his hand shook like a leaf as he extended it to the  Marshal.    Presently we formed procession and took our way to the door of the  station. Here I mounted my horse, the Marshal holding my stirrup. The  civil dignitaries went off to their carriages, and I started to ride  through the streets with the Marshal on my right and Sapt (who, as my  chief aide-de-camp, was entitled to the place) on my left. The city of  Strelsau is partly old and partly new. Spacious modern boulevards and  residential quarters surround and embrace the narrow, tortuous, and  picturesque streets of the original town. In the outer circles the upper  classes live; in the inner the shops are situated; and, behind their  prosperous fronts, lie hidden populous but wretched lanes and alleys,  filled with a poverty-stricken, turbulent, and (in large measure)  criminal class. These social and local divisions corresponded, as I knew  from Sapt's information, to another division more important to me. The  New Town was for the King; but to the Old Town Michael of Strelsau was a  hope, a hero, and a darling.    The scene was very brilliant as we passed along the Grand Boulevard and  on to the great square where the Royal Palace stood. Here I was in  the midst of my devoted adherents. Every house was hung with red and  bedecked with flags and mottoes. The streets were lined with raised  seats on each side, and I passed along, bowing this way and that, under  a shower of cheers, blessings, and waving handkerchiefs. The balconies  were full of gaily dressed ladies, who clapped their hands and curtsied  and threw their brightest glances at me. A torrent of red roses fell on  me; one bloom lodged in my horse's mane, and I took it and stuck it in  my coat. The Marshal smiled grimly. I had stolen some glances at his  face, but he was too impassive to show me whether his sympathies were  with me or not.    \"The red rose for the Elphbergs, Marshal,\" said I gaily, and he nodded.    I have written \"gaily,\" and a strange word it must seem. But the truth  is, that I was drunk with excitement. At that moment I believed--I  almost believed--that I was in very truth the King; and, with a look of  laughing triumph, I raised my eyes to the beauty-laden balconies again  . . . and then I started. For, looking down on me, with her handsome  face and proud smile, was the lady who had been my fellow  traveller--Antoinette de Mauban; and I saw her also start, and her lips  moved, and she leant forward and gazed at me. And I, collecting myself,  met her eyes full and square, while again I felt my revolver. Suppose  she had cried aloud, \"That's not the King!\"    Well, we went by; and then the Marshal, turning round in his saddle,  waved his hand, and the Cuirassiers closed round us, so that the crowd  could not come near me. We were leaving my quarter and entering Duke  Michael's, and this action of the Marshal's showed me more clearly than  words what the state of feeling in the town must be. But if Fate made me  a King, the least I could do was to play the part handsomely.    \"Why this change in our order, Marshal?\" said I.    The Marshal bit his white moustache.    \"It is more prudent, sire,\" he murmured.    I drew rein.    \"Let those in front ride on,\" said I, \"till they are fifty yards ahead.  But do you, Marshal, and Colonel Sapt and my friends, wait here till  I have ridden fifty yards. And see that no one is nearer to me. I will  have my people see that their King trusts them.\"    Sapt laid his hand on my arm. I shook him off. The Marshal hesitated.    \"Am I not understood?\" said I; and, biting his moustache again, he gave  the orders. I saw old Sapt smiling into his beard, but he shook his  head at me. If I had been killed in open day in the streets of Strelsau,  Sapt's position would have been a difficult one.    Perhaps I ought to say that I was dressed all in white, except my boots.  I wore a silver helmet with gilt ornaments, and the broad ribbon of the  Rose looked well across my chest. I should be paying a poor compliment  to the King if I did not set modesty aside and admit that I made a very  fine figure. So the people thought; for when I, riding alone, entered  the dingy, sparsely decorated, sombre streets of the Old Town, there  was first a murmur, then a cheer, and a woman, from a window above a  cookshop, cried the old local saying:    \"If he's red, he's right!\" whereat I laughed and took off my helmet that  she might see that I was of the right colour and they cheered me again  at that.    It was more interesting riding thus alone, for I heard the comments of  the crowd.    \"He looks paler than his wont,\" said one.    \"You'd look pale if you lived as he does,\" was the highly disrespectful  retort.    \"He's a bigger man than I thought,\" said another.    \"So he had a good jaw under that beard after all,\" commented a third.    \"The pictures of him aren't handsome enough,\" declared a pretty girl,  taking great care that I should hear. No doubt it was mere flattery.    But, in spite of these signs of approval and interest, the mass of  the people received me in silence and with sullen looks, and my dear  brother's portrait ornamented most of the windows--which was an ironical"]]]
