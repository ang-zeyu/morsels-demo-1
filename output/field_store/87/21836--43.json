These twenty-four Rajas  were formerly spoken of by the celestial Rishi Narada unto Saivya when  much afflicted for the loss of his children. Besides these, other Rajas  had gone before, still more powerful than they, mighty charioteers noble  in mind, and resplendent with every worthy quality. These were Puru, Kuru,  Yadu, Sura and Viswasrawa of great glory; Anuha, Yuvanaswu, Kakutstha,  Vikrami, and Raghu; Vijava, Virihorta, Anga, Bhava, Sweta, and Vripadguru;  Usinara, Sata-ratha, Kanka, Duliduha, and Druma; Dambhodbhava, Para, Vena,  Sagara, Sankriti, and Nimi; Ajeya, Parasu, Pundra, Sambhu, and holy Deva-  Vridha; Devahuya, Supratika, and Vrihad-ratha; Mahatsaha, Vinitatma,  Sukratu, and Nala, the king of the Nishadas; Satyavrata, Santabhaya,  Sumitra, and the chief Subala; Janujangha, Anaranya, Arka, Priyabhritya,  Chuchi-vrata, Balabandhu, Nirmardda, Ketusringa, and Brhidbala;  Dhrishtaketu, Brihatketu, Driptaketu, and Niramaya; Abikshit, Chapala,  Dhurta, Kritbandhu, and Dridhe-shudhi; Mahapurana-sambhavya, Pratyanga,  Paraha and Sruti. These, O chief, and other Rajas, we hear enumerated by  hundreds and by thousands, and still others by millions, princes of great  power and wisdom, quitting very abundant enjoyments met death as thy sons  have done! Their heavenly deeds, valour, and generosity, their magnanimity,  faith, truth, purity, simplicity and mercy, are published to the world in  the records of former times by sacred bards of great learning. Though  endued with every noble virtue, these have yielded up their lives. Thy  sons were malevolent, inflamed with passion, avaricious, and of very evil  disposition. Thou art versed in the Sastras, O Bharata, and art  intelligent and wise; they never sink under misfortunes whose  understandings are guided by the Sastras. Thou art acquainted, O prince,  with the lenity and severity of fate; this anxiety therefore for the  safety of thy children is unbecoming. Moreover, it behoveth thee not to  grieve for that which must happen: for who can avert, by his wisdom, the  decrees of fate? No one can leave the way marked out for him by Providence.  Existence and non-existence, pleasure and pain all have Time for their  root. Time createth all things and Time destroyeth all creatures. It is  Time that burneth creatures and it is Time that extinguisheth the fire.  All states, the good and the evil, in the three worlds, are caused by Time.  Time cutteth short all things and createth them anew. Time alone is awake  when all things are asleep: indeed, Time is incapable of being overcome.  Time passeth over all things without being retarded. Knowing, as thou dost,  that all things past and future and all that exist at the present moment,  are the offspring of Time, it behoveth thee not to throw away thy reason.'\"    Sauti said, \"The son of Gavalgana having in this manner administered  comfort to the royal Dhritarashtra overwhelmed with grief for his sons,  then restored his mind to peace. Taking these facts for his subject,  Dwaipayana composed a holy Upanishad that has been published to the world  by learned and sacred bards in the Puranas composed by them.    \"The study of the Bharata is an act of piety. He that readeth even one  foot, with belief, hath his sins entirely purged away. Herein Devas,  Devarshis, and immaculate Brahmarshis of good deeds, have been spoken of;  and likewise Yakshas and great Uragas (Nagas). Herein also hath been  described the eternal Vasudeva possessing the six attributes. He is the  true and just, the pure and holy, the eternal Brahma, the supreme soul,  the true constant light, whose divine deeds wise and learned recount; from  whom hath proceeded the non-existent and existent-non-existent universe  with principles of generation and progression, and birth, death and  rebirth. That also hath been treated of which is called Adhyatma (the  superintending spirit of nature) that partaketh of the attributes of the  five elements. That also hath been described who is purusha being above  such epithets as 'undisplayed' and the like; also that which the foremost  yatis exempt from the common destiny and endued with the power of  meditation and Tapas behold dwelling in their hearts as a reflected image  in the mirror.    \"The man of faith, devoted to piety, and constant in the exercise of  virtue, on reading this section is freed from sin. The believer that  constantly heareth recited this section of the Bharata, called the  Introduction, from the beginning, falleth not into difficulties. The man  repeating any part of the introduction in the two twilights is during such  act freed from the sins contracted during the day or the night. This  section, the body of the Bharata, is truth and nectar. As butter is in  curd, Brahmana among bipeds, the Aranyaka among the Vedas, and nectar  among medicines; as the sea is eminent among receptacles of water, and the  cow among quadrupeds; as are these (among the things mentioned) so is the  Bharata said to be among histories.    \"He that causeth it, even a single foot thereof, to be recited to  Brahmanas during a Sraddha, his offerings of food and drink to the manes of  his ancestors become inexhaustible.    \"By the aid of history and the Puranas, the Veda may be expounded; but the  Veda is afraid of one of little information lest he should learn it. The  learned man who recites to other this Veda of Vyasa reapeth advantage. It  may without doubt destroy even the sin of killing the embryo and the like.  He that readeth this holy chapter of the moon, readeth the whole of the  Bharata, I ween. The man who with reverence daily listeneth to this sacred  work acquireth long life and renown and ascendeth to heaven.    \"In former days, having placed the four Vedas on one side and the Bharata  on the other, these were weighed in the balance by the celestials  assembled for that purpose. And as the latter weighed heavier than the  four Vedas with their mysteries, from that period it hath been called in  the world Mahabharata (the great Bharata). Being esteemed superior both in  substance and gravity of import it is denominated Mahabharata on account  of such substance and gravity of import. He that knoweth its meaning is  saved from all his sins.    \"Tapa is innocent, study is harmless, the ordinance of the Vedas  prescribed for all the tribes are harmless, the acquisition of wealth by  exertion is harmless; but when they are abused in their practices it is  then that they become sources of evil.\"      SECTION II    The Rishis said, \"O son of Suta, we wish to hear a full and  circumstantial account of the place mentioned by you as Samanta-panchaya.\"    Sauti said, \"Listen, O ye Brahmanas, to the sacred descriptions I utter. O  ye best of men, ye deserve to hear of the place known as Samanta-panchaka.  In the interval between the Treta and Dwapara Yugas, Rama (the son of  Jamadagni) great among all who have borne arms, urged by impatience of  wrongs, repeatedly smote the noble race of Kshatriyas. And when that fiery  meteor, by his own valour, annihilated the entire tribe of the Kshatriyas,  he formed at Samanta-panchaka five lakes of blood. We are told that his  reason being overpowered by anger he offered oblations of blood to the  manes of his ancestors, standing in the midst of the sanguine waters of  those lakes. It was then that his forefathers of whom Richika was the  first having arrived there addressed him thus, 'O Rama, O blessed Rama, O  offspring of Bhrigu, we have been gratified with the reverence thou hast  shown for thy ancestors and with thy valour, O mighty one! Blessings be  upon thee. O thou illustrious one, ask the boon that thou mayst desire.'    \"Rama said, 'If, O fathers, ye are favourably disposed towards me, the  boon I ask is that I may be absolved from the sins born of my having  annihilated the Kshatriyas in anger, and that the lakes I have formed may  become famous in the world as holy shrines.' The Pitris then said, 'So  shall it be. But be thou pacified.' And Rama was pacified accordingly. The  region that lieth near unto those lakes of gory water, from that time hath  been celebrated as Samanta-panchaka the holy. The wise have declared that  every country should be distinguished by a name significant of some  circumstance which may have rendered it famous. In the interval between  the Dwapara and the Kali Yugas there happened at Samanta-panchaka the  encounter between the armies of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. In that  holy region, without ruggedness of any kind, were assembled eighteen  Akshauhinis of soldiers eager for battle. And, O Brahmanas, having come  thereto, they were all slain on the spot. Thus the name of that region, O  Brahmanas, hath been explained, and the country described to you as a  sacred and delightful one. I have mentioned the whole of what relateth to  it as the region is celebrated throughout the three worlds.\"    The Rishis said, \"We have a desire to know, O son of Suta, what is  implied by the term Akshauhini that hath been used by thee. Tell us in  full what is the number of horse and foot, chariots and elephants, which  compose an Akshauhini for thou art fully informed.\"    Sauti said, \"One chariot, one elephant, five foot-soldiers, and three  horses form one Patti; three pattis make one Sena-mukha; three sena-mukhas  are called a Gulma; three gulmas, a Gana; three ganas, a Vahini; three  vahinis together are called a Pritana; three pritanas form a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7871"],[0,"Dutch Fairy Tales for Young Folks (#6)"],[1,"and swung in the  wind.    Bundlekin usually fell asleep right after she had had her breakfast.  When she woke up crowing, the squirrels were playing all around her. She  even learned to watch the spiders, spinning their houses of silk,  without being afraid. When Bundlekin grew up, she always called this  curious creature, that could make silk, Spin Head. She jokingly called  it her lover, in remembrance of baby days.    It was funny to see how deft the mother was with her needles, fashioned  from bone, and her rough thread, which was made of the intestines of the  deer. From her own childhood in the woods, Bundlekin's mother had been  used to this kind of dressmaking. Now, when her daughter had grown, from  babyhood and through her teens, to be a lovely maiden, fair of face and  strong of limb, her sweet, unselfish parent was equal to new tasks. To  the soft leather coats, made from the skins of fawns, martens, and  weasels, she added trimmings of snow white ermine. Caps and mittens,  cloaks for the body, and coverings for the feet, were fashioned to fit  neatly. Fringes, here and there, were put on them, until her girl looked  like a king's daughter. In summer, the skins of birds and their feathers  clothed her lightly, and with many and rich colors, while the forest  flowers decked her hair.    In winter, in her white forest robes, the maiden, except for her rosy  face and sparkling eyes, seemed as if she might have been born of the  snow, or was a daughter of the northern ice god at Ulrum. And because  she was so lovely, her parents changed her baby name and called her  Dri'-fa, which means Snow White.    Yet, though no other girl in Gelderland equalled, and none, not even the  princesses, excelled Snow White in beauty of face, form, or raiment, the  maiden was not happy, even though many lovers came to her and offered to  marry her. Some, as proof of their skill as hunters, brought the finest  furs the forest furnished. Others showed their strength or fleetness of  foot. Some bargained with the kabouters, or fairies of the mines, to  bring them shining ore or precious gems which they offered to Snow  White. Others, again, went afar to get strange wonders, amber and  ambergris, from the seashores of the far north to please her. One fine  fellow, who had been in the south and was proud of his travels, told her  of what he had seen in the great cities, and offered her a necklace of  pearls.    But all was in vain. Every lover went away sorrowful, for Snow White  wearied of them and sent each one home, disappointed.    Last of all, among the lovers came a strange looking one, named Spin  Head, resembling a spider, promising a secret worth more than furs,  gold, gems, or necklace; but the mother, seeing the ugly creature, drove  it off with hard words.    So the months and years passed, until her father feared he would not  live to see his daughter a wife.    But one day, when all in the household were absent, the leaves of the  oak tree rustled loudly. There was no wind, and Snow White, surprised,  strained her ears to find out what this might mean. Soon she could make  out these words:    \"When the spider, that you called Spin Head, comes to make love to you,  listen to him. He is the wisest being in all the forest. He knows the  future. He will tell you a secret. I shall pass away, but what he  teaches you shall live.\"    Then the leaves of the oak ceased to rustle and all was quiet and still  again.    While wondering what this message might mean, down came the real spider  she had named Spin Head. He lowered himself from a tree branch, high  above on a silken thread. The creature sat down on the log beside the  maiden; but she was not in the least startled and did not scream nor run  away. Indeed, she spoke to the spider as an old friend:    \"Well, playmate of my babyhood, what have you to tell me?\"    \"I came to offer you my love. You need not marry me yet, but if you will  let me spin a web in your room, I shall live there, and, by and by,  reward you. Let me be in your sight always, and you will not be sorry  for it.\"    The maiden had no sooner agreed than a terrible tempest uprooted the oak  and levelled the trees of the forest. In a moment more, a new and very  beautiful house rose up out of the ground. It was as noble to look at as  a palace. Near by was a garden, and one day when she walked in it, out  of it sprang a blue flower, almost under her feet.    \"Choose the best room for your own self,\" said Spin Head, \"and then show  me my corner. After a hundred days, if you treat me kindly, I shall  reveal the secret of that blue flower.\"    Dri'-fa, the maiden, chose the sunniest room, and gave Spin Head the  best corner, near the window and close to the ceiling. At once he began  to weave a shining web for his own house. She wondered at such fine  work, which no human weaver could excel, and why she was not able to  spin silk out of her head, nor even with her fingers, like her strange  lover. But the oak had promised that Spin Head would reveal a secret,  and she was curious to know what it was. Like all girls, she was in a  hurry to have the secret. To ease her impatience, Dri'-fa looked on,  while Spin Head was thus busy at making his dwelling place, with shining  threads which he spun out, never ceasing. She was so intent upon  watching him that night came down before she noticed that her room was  not furnished. There was not even a bed to sleep on.    Spin Head looked at her closely and then spoke with a deep voice, like a  man's:    \"Ah, I know, you want a bed, and pretty things for your room.\"    In another moment, soft furs lined the floor, and soon all that Dri'-fa  had possessed in the forest for comfort she had now, and more. Lost in  wonder as she was, in a few minutes she was fast asleep.    She dreamed she wore a dress of some strange, new, white fabric, such as  her people had never seen before. Instead of being close in texture,  like the skin of an animal, it was as open work, full of thousands of  little holes, yet strongly held together. It was light and gauzy, like a  silvery spider's web on the summer grass before sunrise, when pearly  with dewdrops.    The hundred days were passing swiftly by, and Spin Head and Snow White  had become fast friends. Each lived in a different world--a world within  a world. She was waiting for the secret he would tell her. She bravely  resolved not to be impatient, but let Spin Head speak first.    One day, when autumn had come and she was lonely, she sauntered out into  the garden. The chill winds were blowing and the leaves falling, till  they covered the ground like a yellow carpet. One fell into her hand, as  if it bore words of friendly greeting. Yet, though she waited, not one  of the millions of them brought a message to her! Never a word had she  ever heard from her parents and brothers! The blue flower had long ago  fallen away and there was nothing in its place but a hard, rough, black  stalk. Then she said to herself:    \"Is there anything in this ugly stick? How will Spin Head reveal his  secret?\" Never had she been so cast down.    Again the tempest howled. All the winds of heaven seemed to have broken  loose. Many a sturdy oak lay prostrate. The leaves darkened the air, so  that Snow White could see nothing. Then there was a great calm. The maid  cleared her sight, and lo! there, beside her, stood a youth, more  beautiful than any of her brothers, or her lovers, or any man she had  ever seen. He was dressed in fine white clothing, excelling in its  texture any skin of fawn, or animal of the forest. Instead of being  leather, however soft, it seemed woven of a multitude of threads. In his  hand he held the black stalk of what had been the blue flower.    \"I am Spin Head,\" he said. \"The hundred days are over. The spell is  broken and my deliverance from enchantment has come. I bring to you, as  my gift, this ugly stalk, on which the blue flower bloomed.\"    Between surprise at the change of Spin Head from a spider to a handsome  youth, and disappointment at such a present offered her, Snow White was  dumb. She could hardly draw her breath. Was that all?    \"Break it open,\" said Spin Head.    Splitting the stalk from end to end, the maiden was surprised to find  inside many long silky fibres, almost as fine as the strands in a  spider's web. She pulled them out and her eyes danced with joy.    \"Plant the seed and let the blue flowers blossom by the million,\" said  the youth. \"Then gather the stalks and, from the fibres, weave them  together and make this. The black rod is a sceptre of wealth.\"    Then, separating the delicate strands one by one, Spin Head wove them  together. The result was a rich robe, of a snow white fabric, never seen  in the forest. It was linen.    Snow White clapped her hands with joy.    \"'Tis for your wedding dress, if you will marry me,\" said Spin Head.    Snow White's cheeks blushed red, but she looked at him and her eyes said  \"yes.\"    \"Wait,\" said Spin Head. \"I'll make you a bridal veil.\"    Once more his fingers wrought wonders. He produced yards of a gauzy,  open work stuff. He made it float in the air first. Then he threw it  over her head. It trailed down her back and covered her rosy face. It  was lace.    Happily married, they left the forest and travelled into the land where  the blue flax flowers made a new sky on the earth. Soon on the map men  read the names of cities unknown before. At a time when Europe had no  such masses of happy people, joyous in their toil, Courtrai, Tournay,  Ypres, Ghent, and Bruges told what the blue flower of the flax had done  for the country. More than gold, gems, or the wealth of forest or mine,  was the gift of Spin Head to Snow White, for the making of Belgic Land.
