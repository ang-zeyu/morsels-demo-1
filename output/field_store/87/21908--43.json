Volume 4: Salads and Sandwiches; Cold and (#6)"],[1," potatoes  are being prepared for a meal is to cook more than is necessary for the  one meal and then set aside part of them for a salad to be served at  another meal.    WINTER SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 c. turnips, diced  1 c. carrots, diced  1 c. potatoes, diced  1 Tb. chopped onion  French dressing  Lettuce  Salad dressing    Cook turnips, carrots, and potatoes whole in boiling water until tender  enough to be pierced with a fork. If they have not been peeled before  cooking, peel and cut into small dice. Mix, add the onion, marinate with  French dressing, and allow to stand for a short time. Garnish salad  plates with lettuce leaves, pile the salad on the lettuce, and serve  with any desired salad dressing.    52. CAULIFLOWER SALAD.--Cauliflower makes a rather unusual salad, and  for a change it will be found to be delightful. It does not combine with  other vegetables very readily, but a cooked floweret or two may often be  used to garnish another vegetable salad.    CAULIFLOWER SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    Cauliflower  Lettuce  Salad dressing    Prepare a head of cauliflower for cooking according to the directions  given in _Vegetables_, Part 1. Cook in boiling salted water until  tender, but quite firm. Drain and cool. Arrange the flowerets on a salad  plate garnished with lettuce and serve with French dressing or any other  desired salad dressing.    53. CAULIFLOWER-AND-TOMATO SALAD.--A salad in which cauliflower and  tomatoes are combined is attractive in appearance if it is nicely made.  It also has the advantage of being simple to prepare. When cauliflower  is cooked for salad, care must be taken not to cook it so long as to  discolor it or cause it to fall to pieces.    CAULIFLOWER-AND-TOMATO SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    3 tomatoes  Lettuce  6 cauliflower flowerets  Dressing    Select firm, ripe, medium-sized tomatoes. Place them in boiling water  to scald them, and then dip them quickly into cold water and remove the  skins. Cut out the stem ends and slice each tomato half way between the  stem and blossom ends. Place each half tomato on a salad plate garnished  with a lettuce leaf, stick a stem of the cauliflower into the center,  and serve with boiled salad dressing or mayonnaise.    54. CELERY SALAD.--One means of using stalks of celery that are just a  little too coarse to serve nicely on the table is to combine them with  radishes and make a salad. The more tender celery, of course, makes a  better salad. If the radishes selected for the salad are of the red  variety and they are used without peeling, they add a touch of color  to the dish.    CELERY SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Five)    1-1/2 c. diced celery  1/2 c. diced radishes  2 Tb. chopped onion  Salad dressing  Lettuce    Cut the celery into fine dice, and dice the radishes more finely than  the celery. Mix the two together, add the onion, and just before serving  mix with any desired salad dressing. Serve on salad plates garnished  with lettuce.    55. SLICED CUCUMBER-AND-ONION SALAD.--An attractive way in which to  serve sliced cucumbers and onions is shown in Fig. 4. A single large  cucumber should be selected for this salad, and Bermuda onions with a  mild flavor will be found to be best.    [Illustration: FIG. 4]    With a sharp knife, peel the skin from the cucumber in narrow strips  back to the stem end, but do not cut the strips loose from the end.  After the peeling has all been removed, place the cucumber on a board  and cut it into thin slices. Place on a small platter, as shown, arrange  slices of onion around the edge, and pour French dressing over the  whole. Dust with paprika and serve. A number of slices of cucumber and  one or two slices of onion should be served to each person.    [Illustration: FIG. 3]    56. CUCUMBER SALAD.--Besides serving plain slices of cucumber on a  lettuce leaf, as may be done at any time, cucumbers may be used as an  ingredient in the making of many salads. A rather attractive way in  which to use cucumbers is shown in Fig. 5 and is explained in the  accompanying recipe.    CUCUMBER SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    3 medium-sized cucumbers  1 c. diced tomato  1/2 c. diced celery  Salad dressing  Lettuce  1 pimiento    Peel the cucumbers, cut them into halves, and with a small spoon scoop  out the cucumbers in chunks, so that a boat-shaped piece of cucumber  that is about 1/4 inch thick remains. Dice the pieces of cucumber which  have been scooped from the center, and place the cucumber shells in ice  water so as to make them crisp. Mix the diced tomato, celery, and  cucumber together, and just before serving drain them carefully so that  no liquid remains. Mix with salad dressing, wipe the cucumber shells  dry, fill them with the salad mixture, and place on salad plates  garnished with lettuce leaves. Cut the pimiento into thin strips, and  place three or four strips diagonally across the cucumber, as shown in  the illustration.    57. CUCUMBER-AND-TOMATO SALAD.--A salad made of cucumbers and tomatoes  is very attractive because of the contrasting colors of the vegetables,  and it is at the same time extremely palatable. When such a salad is to  be made, small, firm tomatoes and rather large cucumbers that do not  contain very large seeds should be selected. Peel the cucumbers and  tomatoes and cut them into slices of any desired thickness. Garnish  salad plates with lettuce, and on this place a ring of the slices,  alternating the tomatoes with the cucumbers. In the center, put a slice  of cucumber or tomato and serve with any desired salad dressing.    58. ONION SALAD.--To persons who are fond of the flavor of onions, the  salad given in the accompanying recipe is very agreeable, but it is a  wise plan not to serve onions or salads containing onions unless every  one who is served is certain to enjoy them. When a salad is made from  onions, a mild onion, such as the Bermuda or Spanish onion, should  be selected.    ONION SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    3 onions  French dressing  Parsley  Lettuce    Peel the onions and slice them into thin slices. Chop the parsley and  add it to 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls of French dressing. Use comparatively  coarse leaves of lettuce and shred them. Arrange the slices of onion on  a bed of the shredded lettuce, pour the French dressing with the parsley  over all, and serve.    59. PEAS-AND-CELERY SALAD.--Peas may be freshly cooked for  peas-and-celery salad, but canned peas will do just as well. Left-over  peas not prepared with cream sauce may also be utilized nicely in this  way, or if a portion of a can of peas is needed for the meal, the  remainder may be used for a smaller quantity of salad than here stated.  Boiled salad dressing will be found to be best for this combination of  vegetables.    PEAS-AND-CELERY SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    1 c. peas  Boiled salad dressing  1 c. diced celery  Lettuce    Drain canned peas as dry as possible and mix with the diced celery. Just  before serving, add the salad dressing and mix thoroughly. Serve on  salad plates garnished with lettuce.    60. TOMATO SALAD.--Fresh tomatoes make a delightful salad because of  their appetizing appearance and color. In fact, when they are placed on  a bed of green garnish, nothing can be more delightful. Tomatoes may be  served whole on a lettuce leaf or they may be sliced. Then, again, as  shown in Fig. 6, they may be cut from the center into sections that are  allowed to fall part way open. In any of these forms, they may be served  with French dressing, mayonnaise, or any cooked salad dressing.  [Illustration: FIG. 6]    [Illustration: FIG. 7] 61. STUFFED-TOMATO SALAD.--An attractive salad in  which vegetables of almost any kind, fresh or canned, may be used to  advantage is the stuffed-tomato salad shown in Fig. 7. Medium-sized,  well-ripened tomatoes are best to select. The vegetables that may be  used for the stuffing are celery, radishes, onions, cucumbers, cooked  asparagus, green peas, and string beans. Any one or any desirable  combination of these vegetables will make a satisfactory filling.    STUFFED-TOMATO SALAD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    6 medium-sized tomatoes  French dressing  1 1/2 c. diced vegetables  Mayonnaise dressing    Cut out the stem and blossom ends of the tomatoes and hollow out the  center so as to leave a shell. Dice the contents of the tomatoes and mix  with the other diced vegetables. Marinate the diced vegetables with  French dressing and put into the tomato shells, heaping each one as  shown. Place on lettuce leaves and serve with mayonnaise.    62. COMBINATION SALAD.--A combination salad may be made of almost any  combination of vegetables. The one given here contains only fresh  vegetables, but, if desired, others may be added or some of those  mentioned may be omitted. This will be found to be a very attractive way  in which to make a large salad to be served from a bowl or a deep plate.    COMBINATION SALAD    Lettuce  Radishes cut in rose shape  Sliced tomatoes  Celery  Sliced onions  Salad dressing  Sliced peppers    Garnish a bowl or a plate with lettuce, arrange on it slices of tomato,  Spanish or Bermuda onions, and peppers. Garnish these with radishes cut  into rose shape and stems of celery cut in any desired way. Be sure that  the vegetables, which should all be crisp and fresh, are thoroughly  cleaned and drained before being put on the plate. Add the salad  dressing in the preferred way. It may be poured over the vegetables in  the large dish, passed to each individual, or put on the salad plates by  the person who serves. French dressing is without doubt the most  suitable for combination salad, but mayonnaise or cooked salad dressing  may be served with it if desired.    63. POTATO SALAD NO. L.--Potato salad is usually considered to be an  economical salad. It may be made with left-over potatoes or potatoes  cooked especially for this purpose. If there are in supply a large  number of small"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9939"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 5: Fruit and Fruit Desserts; (#6)"],[1,"consequently keep for long periods of  time if they are not too ripe when picked. Those which contain the  highest percentage of water are the most perishable.      APPLES    50. APPLES, of which there are at least a thousand varieties, are  probably the best known of the non-tropical fruits. Some apples mature  early in the summer, while others do not ripen until late in the fall.  The late apples can be kept during the entire winter if they are  properly stored, but the summer varieties must generally be used  immediately, as they do not have good keeping qualities. In each  locality in which apples are grown, a few varieties seem to be  especially popular and are used to the exclusion of others. Some apples  are good for one purpose and some for another. For instance, many that  are excellent if eaten raw are not good for cooking purposes, and others  that cook well are not suitable for eating. It is therefore a good idea  for the housewife to become familiar with the varieties of apples raised  in her community and to learn the use to which each kind can be put to  advantage.    Apples of all kinds may be prepared in a large variety of ways. They are  much used for sauce, pie, and numerous desserts, as well as for jelly  and, with various fruit mixtures, for jams and preserves. The juice of  apples, which upon being extracted is known as _cider_, is used in a  number of ways, but its most important use is in the manufacture  of vinegar.    51. APPLE SAUCE.--When apple sauce is to be made, apples that are  somewhat sour and that will cook soft easily should be selected. This is  a dessert that can be made all during the winter when it is often  difficult to obtain other fruits fresh. It is usually served when roast  pork is the main dish of a meal, but is just as appetizing when served  with other foods.    APPLE SAUCE  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    10 medium-sized apples  1/2 c. water  1 c. sugar    Wash the apples, cut them in quarters, remove the cores, and, if  desired, peel them. Put them into a saucepan, add the water, and allow  them to cook until they are very soft. If the apples are inclined to be  dry, a little more water may be necessary. When done, force them through  a colander or a sieve, add the sugar to the pulp, and return to the  stove. Cook until the sugar is completely dissolved and, if necessary,  until the apple sauce is slightly thickened, stirring frequently to  prevent scorching. Remove from the heat, and season with lemon peel cut  fine, cinnamon, or nutmeg.    If there are apples in supply that do not cook well for apple sauce,  they may be peeled, quartered, and cored, and cooked with the sugar and  water. Then, instead of being forced through a sieve, they should be  allowed to remain in pieces in the sirup.    52. PORCUPINE APPLES.--A pleasing change in the way of an apple dessert  may be had by making porcupine apples.    PORCUPINE APPLES  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    6 large apples  1 c. sugar  1 c. water  2 doz. almonds  Currant jelly    Wash, core, and pare the apples. Make a sirup by bringing the sugar and  water to the boiling point. Put the apples into the sirup, cook on one  side for several minutes, and then turn and cook on the other side. Do  not allow the apples to cook completely in the sirup, but when they are  still hard remove them and continue to boil the sirup down. Set the  apples in a shallow pan, stick the almonds, which should be blanched,  into them so that they will project like porcupine quills, sprinkle them  with sugar, and bake in the oven until they are soft and the almonds  slightly brown. Remove from the oven, fill the center of each with  currant jelly, pour the juice over them, and serve.    53. BAKED APPLES.--Nothing is more palatable than baked apples if a  juicy, sour variety can be secured.    BAKED APPLES  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    6 medium-sized sour apples  1/2 c. brown sugar  1/2 tsp. cinnamon  1 Tb. butter  1/2 c. water    Wash and core the apples, place them in a baking dish, and fill the  centers with the brown sugar mixed with the cinnamon. Put a small piece  of butter on top of each apple, pour the water in the bottom of the pan,  set in the oven, and bake until the apples are soft. Baste frequently  with the juice that collects in the bottom of the pan. Serve hot or  cold, as desired.    Apples baked in this way may be improved in flavor by serving grape  juice over them. Heat the grape juice, and then, if the apples are to be  served hot, pour about 2 tablespoonfuls over each apple just before  serving. In case the apples are to be served cold, pour the hot grape  juice over them and then allow them to cool.    54. MAPLE APPLES.--Apples cooked in maple sirup have a very pleasing  flavor. The sirup that remains in the pan is poured over the apples when  they are served.    MAPLE APPLES  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    6 medium-sized apples  1 c. maple sirup    Wash, peel, and core the apples. Bring the maple sirup to the boiling  point in a saucepan. Drop the apples into the hot sirup, cook first on  one side, and then turn and cook on the other. As soon as they become  soft, remove from the sirup, pour the sirup over them, and serve.    55. STEAMED APPLES.--If it is desired to retain the color in apples that  have red skins, they should be steamed instead of baked, for the color  is lost in baking. Prepare apples that are to be steamed by washing them  and removing the cores. Place the apples in a pan with a perforated  bottom, put this over a pan of boiling water, cover closely, and steam  until they are soft. Serve in any desired way. They will be found to be  delicious in flavor and attractive in appearance.      APRICOTS    56. APRICOTS, in appearance, are a cross between peaches and plums. They  are grown extensively in the western part of the United States, but they  can be grown in any climate where peaches and plums are raised. As they  contain considerable acid, they require a large quantity of sugar when  they are cooked with their skins and seeds. They are used most  frequently for canning, but they make excellent marmalades and jams.  They are also dried in large quantities and, in this form, make  delicious desserts.    57. APRICOT SOUFFLE.--No more attractive as well as delicious dessert  can be prepared than apricot souffle, which is illustrated in Fig. 3.  The apricots are just tart enough to give it a very pleasing flavor.    [Illustration: Fig. 3]    APRICOT SOUFFLE  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 Tb. butter  4 Tb. flour  1/3 c. sugar  Pinch of salt  1 c. scalded milk  3 eggs  1/2 tsp. vanilla  1 can apricots    Melt the butter, add the flour, sugar, and salt, and stir in the hot  milk. Bring this mixture to the boiling point. Separate the yolks and  whites of the eggs. Beat the yolks until they are thick and  lemon-colored, and then pour the hot mixture over them, stirring  constantly to prevent the eggs from curding. Beat the whites until they  are stiff, fold them into the mixture, and add the vanilla. Place the  apricots without juice in a layer on the bottom of the buttered baking  dish, pour the mixture over them, and bake for 45 to 60 minutes in a hot  oven, when it should be baked through and slightly brown on top and  should appear as in Fig. 3. Remove from the oven and serve with the  sirup from the apricots. Whipped cream may also be added if desired.      CHERRIES    58. CHERRIES come in numerous varieties, some of which are sweet and  others sour. The method of using them in cookery depends largely on the  kind of cherry that is to be used. Any of the varieties may be canned  with varying quantities of sugar and then used for sauce. They also make  excellent preserves, especially the sour varieties. However, they do not  contain pectin in sufficient quantity for jelly, so that when cherry  jelly is desired, other fruit or material containing pectin must be used  with the cherries. When purchased in the market, cherries usually have  their stems on. They should be washed before the stems are removed. The  seeds may be taken out by hand or by means of cherry seeders made  especially for this purpose.    59. CHERRY FRITTERS.--Something different in the way of dessert can be  had by making cherry fritters according to the accompanying recipe.    CHERRY FRITTERS  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 c. flour  2 tsp. baking powder  1/4 tsp. salt  2 Tb. sugar  1/2 c. milk  1 egg  2 Tb. butter  1/2 c. cherries cut into halves    Mix and sift the dry ingredients, add the milk and egg, and beat all  together well. Add the melted butter and fold in the cherries. Drop by  spoonfuls into hot fat and fry until brown. Remove from the fat,  sprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve.      GRAPES    60. GRAPES are a fruit extensively cultivated both for eating and for  the making of wines and raisins. Although found in many varieties, they  naturally divide themselves into two general classes: those which retain  their skins, such as the Malaga, Tokay, Muscat, Cornichon, Emperor,  etc., and those which slip out of their skins easily, such as the  Concord, Niagara, Delaware, Catawba, etc.    Grapes are much used as a fresh fruit. When they are to be used in this  way, the bunches should be put into a colander and washed thoroughly by  running cold water over them. Then all the imperfect ones should be  removed and the grapes kept cool until they are to be served. Clean  grape leaves make an attractive garnish for the individual plates or the  serving dish on which the grapes are placed. Grapes are also used  extensively for making jelly and grape juice, a beverage that is  well liked.    61. It will be found that through proper care grapes can be kept a long  time in the fall after they are removed from the vines, provided perfect  bunches are obtained and they are picked before they have become too  ripe. To preserve such grapes, dip the ends of the stems into melted  sealing wax in order to prevent the evaporation of"]]]
