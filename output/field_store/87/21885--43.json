The voice seemed partly  human, yet so hideous that it might well have emanated from the  tortured throat of a lost soul, writhing in the fires of hell.    The Belgian shuddered and looked fearfully upward, for the scream had  seemed to come from above him.  As he looked he saw an opening far  overhead, and a patch of sky pinked with brilliant stars.    His half-formed intention to call for help was expunged by the  terrifying cry--where such a voice lived, no human creatures could  dwell.  He dared not reveal himself to whatever inhabitants dwelt in  the place above him.  He cursed himself for a fool that he had ever  embarked upon such a mission.  He wished himself safely back in the  camp of Achmet Zek, and would almost have embraced an opportunity to  give himself up to the military authorities of the Congo if by so doing  he might be rescued from the frightful predicament in which he now was.    He listened fearfully, but the cry was not repeated, and at last  spurred to desperate means, he gathered himself for the leap across the  chasm.  Going back twenty paces, he took a running start, and at the  edge of the well, leaped upward and outward in an attempt to gain the  opposite side.    In his hand he clutched the sputtering candle, and as he took the leap  the rush of air extinguished it.  In utter darkness he flew through  space, clutching outward for a hold should his feet miss the invisible  ledge.    He struck the edge of the door of the opposite terminus of the rocky  tunnel with his knees, slipped backward, clutched desperately for a  moment, and at last hung half within and half without the opening; but  he was safe.  For several minutes he dared not move; but clung, weak  and sweating, where he lay.  At last, cautiously, he drew himself well  within the tunnel, and again he lay at full length upon the floor,  fighting to regain control of his shattered nerves.    When his knees struck the edge of the tunnel he had dropped the candle.  Presently, hoping against hope that it had fallen upon the floor of the  passageway, rather than back into the depths of the well, he rose upon  all fours and commenced a diligent search for the little tallow  cylinder, which now seemed infinitely more precious to him than all the  fabulous wealth of the hoarded ingots of Opar.    And when, at last, he found it, he clasped it to him and sank back  sobbing and exhausted.  For many minutes he lay trembling and broken;  but finally he drew himself to a sitting posture, and taking a match  from his pocket, lighted the stump of the candle which remained to him.  With the light he found it easier to regain control of his nerves, and  presently he was again making his way along the tunnel in search of an  avenue of escape.  The horrid cry that had come down to him from above  through the ancient well-shaft still haunted him, so that he trembled  in terror at even the sounds of his own cautious advance.    He had gone forward but a short distance, when, to his chagrin, a wall  of masonry barred his farther progress, closing the tunnel completely  from top to bottom and from side to side.  What could it mean?  Werper  was an educated and intelligent man.  His military training had taught  him to use his mind for the purpose for which it was intended.  A blind  tunnel such as this was senseless.  It must continue beyond the wall.  Someone, at some time in the past, had had it blocked for an unknown  purpose of his own.  The man fell to examining the masonry by the light  of his candle.  To his delight he discovered that the thin blocks of  hewn stone of which it was constructed were fitted in loosely without  mortar or cement.  He tugged upon one of them, and to his joy found  that it was easily removable.  One after another he pulled out the  blocks until he had opened an aperture large enough to admit his body,  then he crawled through into a large, low chamber.  Across this another  door barred his way; but this, too, gave before his efforts, for it was  not barred.  A long, dark corridor showed before him, but before he had  followed it far, his candle burned down until it scorched his fingers.  With an oath he dropped it to the floor, where it sputtered for a  moment and went out.    Now he was in total darkness, and again terror rode heavily astride his  neck.  What further pitfalls and dangers lay ahead he could not guess;  but that he was as far as ever from liberty he was quite willing to  believe, so depressing is utter absence of light to one in unfamiliar  surroundings.    Slowly he groped his way along, feeling with his hands upon the  tunnel's walls, and cautiously with his feet ahead of him upon the  floor before he could take a single forward step.  How long he crept on  thus he could not guess; but at last, feeling that the tunnel's length  was interminable, and exhausted by his efforts, by terror, and loss of  sleep, he determined to lie down and rest before proceeding farther.    When he awoke there was no change in the surrounding blackness.  He  might have slept a second or a day--he could not know; but that he had  slept for some time was attested by the fact that he felt refreshed and  hungry.    Again he commenced his groping advance; but this time he had gone but a  short distance when he emerged into a room, which was lighted through  an opening in the ceiling, from which a flight of concrete steps led  downward to the floor of the chamber.    Above him, through the aperture, Werper could see sunlight glancing  from massive columns, which were twined about by clinging vines.  He  listened; but he heard no sound other than the soughing of the wind  through leafy branches, the hoarse cries of birds, and the chattering  of monkeys.    Boldly he ascended the stairway, to find himself in a circular court.  Just before him stood a stone altar, stained with rusty-brown  discolorations.  At the time Werper gave no thought to an explanation  of these stains--later their origin became all too hideously apparent  to him.    Beside the opening in the floor, just behind the altar, through which  he had entered the court from the subterranean chamber below, the  Belgian discovered several doors leading from the enclosure upon the  level of the floor.  Above, and circling the courtyard, was a series of  open balconies.  Monkeys scampered about the deserted ruins, and gaily  plumaged birds flitted in and out among the columns and the galleries  far above; but no sign of human presence was discernible.  Werper felt  relieved.  He sighed, as though a great weight had been lifted from his  shoulders.  He took a step toward one of the exits, and then he halted,  wide-eyed in astonishment and terror, for almost at the same instant a  dozen doors opened in the courtyard wall and a horde of frightful men  rushed in upon him.    They were the priests of the Flaming God of Opar--the same, shaggy,  knotted, hideous little men who had dragged Jane Clayton to the  sacrificial altar at this very spot years before.  Their long arms,  their short and crooked legs, their close-set, evil eyes, and their  low, receding foreheads gave them a bestial appearance that sent a  qualm of paralyzing fright through the shaken nerves of the Belgian.    With a scream he turned to flee back into the lesser terrors of the  gloomy corridors and apartments from which he had just emerged, but the  frightful men anticipated his intentions.  They blocked the way; they  seized him, and though he fell, groveling upon his knees before them,  begging for his life, they bound him and hurled him to the floor of the  inner temple.    The rest was but a repetition of what Tarzan and Jane Clayton had  passed through.  The priestesses came, and with them La, the High  Priestess.  Werper was raised and laid across the altar.  Cold sweat  exuded from his every pore as La raised the cruel, sacrificial knife  above him.  The death chant fell upon his tortured ears.  His staring  eyes wandered to the golden goblets from which the hideous votaries  would soon quench their inhuman thirst in his own, warm life-blood.    He wished that he might be granted the brief respite of unconsciousness  before the final plunge of the keen blade--and then there was a  frightful roar that sounded almost in his ears.  The High Priestess  lowered her dagger.  Her eyes went wide in horror.  The priestesses,  her votaresses, screamed and fled madly toward the exits.  The priests  roared out their rage and terror according to the temper of their  courage.  Werper strained his neck about to catch a sight of the cause  of their panic, and when, at last he saw it, he too went cold in dread,  for what his eyes beheld was the figure of a huge lion standing in the  center of the temple, and already a single victim lay mangled beneath  his cruel paws.    Again the lord of the wilderness roared, turning his baleful gaze upon  the altar.  La staggered forward, reeled, and fell across Werper in a  swoon.          6    The Arab Raid      After their first terror had subsided subsequent to the shock of the  earthquake, Basuli and his warriors hastened back into the passageway  in search of Tarzan and two of their own number who were also missing.    They found the way blocked by jammed and distorted rock.  For two days  they labored to tear a way through to their imprisoned friends; but  when, after Herculean efforts, they had unearthed but a few yards of  the choked passage, and discovered the mangled remains of one of their  fellows they were forced to the conclusion that Tarzan and the second  Waziri also lay dead beneath the rock mass farther in, beyond human  aid, and no longer susceptible of it.    Again and again as they labored they called aloud the names of their  master and their comrade; but no answering call rewarded their  listening ears.  At last they gave up the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/926"],[0,"Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted; Or, What's in a Dream (#6)"],[1,"stand, a tomb and an epitaph to haunt  us through the furnace of conscience and memory.    Closely following in the wake of our multiplying evil thoughts are armies  of these ghastly spectres pursuing each other with the exact intents  and purposes of the mind that gave them being.  If we consider well these  facts we will be forced into thinking our best thoughts at all times.  Thoughts are the subjective and creative force that produces action.  Action is the objective effect of thought; hence the character of our daily  thoughts is making our failure or success of to-morrow.    The impersonal mind deals with all time and things as ever present.  The objective mind is constantly striving to penetrate  the spiritual realm, while the spiritual mind is striving to  enter matter, hence our actions have their subjective counterparts  and their subethereal counterparts.  The universal mind,  in harmony with the evolutionary plans and laws of the macrocosms,  materializes through functions of the microcosm, imparting to each,  with its routine of failure and success, its daily objectivity.  The inner or passive dream mind may perceive the subjective types  or antitypes many days before they objectify through the microcosm.  Their meaning is often wrapt in symbols, but sometimes  the actual as it occurs in objective life is conveyed.  Our own thought images which have passed before the objective mind  may be perceived by the clever mind reader, but those antitypes  which are affecting our future, but which have none other  but subjective existence, are rarely ever perceived by any one  except by the power of the higher self or the spirit within.  For this reason we are enjoined by the sages to study self.  With the physical mind we only see physical objects,  with the subjective mind we see only subjective objects.  This was Paul's doctrine and it is the belief of the best  psychic thought of this century.  By means of our reason--  an objective process for divining the future--aided by mathematical  and geographical data, we may outline the storm centers and the path  of the rain days before they appear in certain localities.  After eliminating all contingencies arising from clerical  error and counteracting influence, the prognostication is sure  of fulfilment.  For centuries ahead the astronomer foretells  the eclipse of the moon and the sun and the arrival of comets.  He does not do this by crossing the borderland dividing the spiritual  from the physical world.  In a like manner the subjective  forces operate upon their own planes and know very little  even of their own corporal realm, just as our physical senses  know little, if anything, of the soul or spiritual habitation.  They know that by gross living the sense of conscience may  be dulled, or that by right living it may be strengthened.  In like manner the subjective mind perceives by its own senses  certain invisible types of evil seeking external manifestations  in the microcosm.  It knows that these forms of error will work  harm to the objective mind, and that if persisted in they  will pervert all intercourse or interchange of counsel between  the two factions of the man.  In this there is no spiritual  perception of physical objects, any more than there is in mundane  life a sense perception of spiritual images and antitypes.  The former only sees the forms that manifest on its plane,  while the latter can note only those common to its sphere.  Each may recognize and feel the violence or good that these  manifestations will do to their respective counterparts,  but we have no reason to believe that normal objective or  subjective states have visional powers beyond their own plane.  The mind of man acting upon the mind of the macrocosm will produce,  according as he thinks or acts, antitypes of good or evil in  the imagination of the world which is reflected upon the spiritual  aura of the microcosm previous to taking on corporal form.  While in this state they may be perceived by subjectivity,  and thus the images seen are impressed on the dream mind  during sleep, or on the passivity of the objective sense.    Evil or righteous acts recently committed will more acutely affect  the present waking mind than those enacted at a more remote period.  In a similar way future disaster or success which is soon to occur  will impress the dream mind more vividly than those which are  to transpire at a later date.  But in the lives of all men there  are past incidents which they will never forget, and which  will never cease to fill their hearts with pride or remorse.  So, too, in their distant future there are important events  to transpire which are struggling through tumultuous infinitude  to leave their ghastly or smiling impress upon the dream mind.  If your mental states are passive you will receive the warnings.  There are cases on record which show events have been forecast  years ahead of their occurrence.    We do not claim that this book will prove an interpreter of all dreams,  or that the keys disclosed will open to you all the mysteries of the future,  or even all those surrounding your own personality, but by studying  the definitions and the plane upon which they were written, you will be able,  through the power of your own spirit, to interpret your own dreams.  The combination of dream and dream influences are as infinite as the stars,  or the combination of thought and number.  They can only be classed  and considered as such.  They cannot be analyzed in detail or as a whole.  In mathematics we have nine digits from which an infinite variety  of combinations may be formed and solved by the deduction of the mind.  Through them we may measure time, space, quality and quantity.    The symbol o and I exist by reason of _no thing_ and _some  thing_ or death and life.  The figure one is subject to  illimitable expansion.  It is without beginning in the infinite  of number, as God is without beginning in the infinite of being.  As with the vegetable kingdom, the tiny seed or acorn silently  working its magical transformation into a plant or tree,  and directing its destiny with marvelous intelligence  through the torrid and frigid vicissitudes of the seasons;  so is man without beginning in the infinitude of his own  being or microcosm.  Man is both a type and antitype.  A type of what pre-existed in the imagination of the world, and an  antitype of a future life yet to manifest itself on another plane  where the incidents of the one will be subjective, as the events  occurring in infancy or in other planes are now subjective.  His dreams, thoughts and actions, and the influences that  produce them and their multiplying combination, cannot be  numbered or reproduced any more than you can number the leaves  of the forest, or find two exactly similar units among them.  Thus the full meaning or interpretation of dreams cannot be fully  demonstrated through mental or even spiritual stereotypes.  But by the intelligent use of this book you will be able to trace  out almost any dream combination and arrive at the true nature  of its portent.    A wise doctor, in preparing medicine for a patient,  considers well his age, temperament and his present condition.  So should the interpreter of dreams ponder well the mental state,  the health, habits and temperament of the dreamer.  These things no one can know so well as the dreamer himself.  He, therefore, with the aid of this book, will be able to interpret  his dreams by the light that is in him.    Man is the microcosm or a miniature world.  He has a soul and  mental firmament, bounded by the stellar dust and the milky way,  and filled with the mystery of suns, satellites and stars.  These he can study best by the astronomy of induction and introspection.  He has also a physical plane, diversified by oceans,  lakes, rivers, fertile valleys, waste places and mountains.  All are in cosmic interdependency as they are in the macrocosm.  Here rests the mystery of being--the grandest of subjects!  The student is no less bewildered and awed than the geologist  who gropes blindly through the seams of the earth searching  for links in the infinite chain of knowledge, or the astronomer  sweeping the heavens of the macrocosm in quest of new phenomena.  The two planes are dependent upon each other.  It is the smile  or disease of the firmament that blesses or diseases the earth.  It is likewise the impure firmament of the microcosm that diseases  the body and soul.  If it reflects the drought of thought or the  various states of evil, deserts will enlarge, forest of infectious,  venomous growth will form the habitation of lust and murder.  Before great moral or physical revolutions or catastrophes occur,  clouds will darken the horizon of the dream mind; storms will gather,  lurid flames of lightning will flash their volatile anger;  the explosive thunder will recklessly carry on its bombardment;  bells will ring, strange knocking will be heard--symbols of a message--  phantom forms will be seen, familiar voices will call and plead  with you, unknown visitors will threaten you, unearthly struggles  with hideous giants and agonies of mind and body will possess you;  malformations of the most hideous type will seize your vision;  shrouded in sheets of a whitish vapor, evanescent specters,  with pallid face and of warning countenance, will cling around you,  and contagion and famine will leave their desolate impress upon  the flower of health and in the field of plenty.  Thus all of us  would be nightly warned in our circle or miniature world if we  would develop subjective strength to retain the impressions left  upon our dream mind.  But in spite of all reason and conscience--  in spite of the inductive knowledge received through our senses--  we go on from day to day, and step by step, feeding our soul  on the luscious fruit of the outward senses, until the rank  weeds of sefishness{sic} have choked out all "]]]
