The greater part of the causes which excited this general commotion,  existed before the assembly of the States-General in 1789. It is  therefore important to take a mental view of the moral and political  situation of France at that period, and to follow, in imagination at  least, the chain of ideas, passions, and errors, which, having  dissolved the ties of society, and worn out the springs of  government, led the nation by gigantic strides into the most complete  anarchy.    Without enumerating the different authorities which successively  ruled in France after the fall of the throne, it appears no less  essential to remind the reader that, in this general disorganization,  the inhabitants themselves, though breathing the same air, scarcely  knew that they belonged to the same nation. The altars overthrown;  all the ancient institutions annihilated; new festivals and  ceremonies introduced; factious demagogues honoured with an  apotheosis; their busts exposed to public veneration; men and cities  changing names; a portion of the people infected with atheism, and  disguised in the livery of guilt and folly; all this, and more,  exercised the reflection of the well-disposed in a manner the most  painful. In a word, though France was peopled with the same  individuals, it seemed inhabited by a new nation, entirely different  from the old one in its government, its creed, its principles, its  manners, and even its customs.    War itself assumed a new face. Every thing relating to it became  extraordinary: the number of the combatants, the manner of recruiting  the armies, and the means of providing supplies for them; the  manufacture of powder, cannon, and muskets; the ardour, impetuosity,  and forced marches of the troops; their extortions, their successes,  and their reverses; the choice of the generals, and the superior  talents of some of them, together with the springs, by which these  enormous bodies of armed men were moved and directed, were equally  new and astonishing.    History tells us that in poor countries, where nothing inflames  cupidity and ambition, the love alone of the public good causes  changes to be tried in the government; and that those changes derange  not the ordinary course of society; whereas, among rich nations,  corrupted by luxury, revolutions are always effected through secret  motives of jealousy and interest; because there are great places to  be usurped, and great fortunes to be invaded. In France, the  revolution covered the country with ruins, tears, and blood, because  means were not to be found to moderate in the people that  _revolutionary spirit_ which parches, in the bud, the promised fruits  of liberty, when its violence is not repressed.    Few persons were capable of keeping pace with the rapid progress of  the revolution. Those who remained behind were considered as guilty  of desertion. The authors of the first constitution were accused of  being _royalists_; the old partisans of republicanism were punished  as _moderates_; the land-owners, as _aristocrates_; the monied men,  as _corrupters_; the bankers and financiers, as _blood-suckers_; the  shop-keepers, as _promoters of famine_; and the newsmongers, as  _alarmists_. The factious themselves, in short, were alternately  proscribed, as soon as they ceased to belong to the ruling faction.    In this state of things, society became a prey to the most baneful  passions. Mistrust entered every heart; friendship had no attraction;  relationship, no tie; and men's minds, hardened by the habit of  misfortune, or overwhelmed by fear, no longer opened to pity.    Terror compressed every imagination; and the revolutionary  government, exercising it to its fullest extent, struck off a  prodigious number of heads, filled the prisons with victims, and  continued to corrupt the morals of the nation by staining it with  crimes.    But all things have an end. The tyrants fell; the dungeons were  thrown open; numberless victims emerged from them; and France seemed  to recover new life; but still bewildered by the _revolutionary  spirit_, wasted by the concealed poison of anarchy, exhausted by her  innumerable sacrifices, and almost paralyzed by her own convulsions,  she made but impotent efforts for the enjoyment of liberty and  justice. Taxes became more burdensome; commerce was annihilated;  industry, without aliment; paper-money, without value; and specie,  without circulation. However, while the French nation was degraded at  home by this series of evils, it was respected abroad through the  rare merit of some of its generals, the splendour of its victories,  and the bravery of its soldiers.    During these transactions, there was formed in the public mind that  moral resistance which destroys not governments by violence, but  undermines them. The intestine commotions were increasing; the  conquests of the French were invaded; their enemies were already on  their frontiers; and the division which had broken out between the  Directory and the Legislative Body, again threatened France with a  total dissolution, when a man of extraordinary character and talents  had the boldness to seize the reins of authority, and stop the  further progress of the revolution.[1] Taking at the full the tide  which leads on to fortune, he at once changed the face of affairs,  not only within the limits of the Republic, but throughout Europe.  Yet, after all their triumphs, the French have the mortification to  have failed in gaining that for which they first took up arms, and  for which they have maintained so long and so obstinate a struggle.    When a strong mound has been broken down, the waters whose amassed  volume it opposed, rush forward, and, in their impetuous course,  spread afar terror and devastation. On visiting the scene where this  has occurred, we naturally cast our eyes in every direction, to  discover the mischief which they have occasioned by their irruption;  so, then, on reaching the grand theatre of the French revolution, did  I look about for the traces of the havock it had left behind; but,  like a river which had regained its level, and flowed again in its  natural bed, this political torrent had subsided, and its ravages  were repaired in a manner the most surprising.    However, at the particular request of an estimable friend, I have  endeavoured to draw the contrast which, in 1789-90 and 1801-2, Paris  presented to the eye of an impartial observer. In this arduous  attempt I have not the vanity to flatter myself that I have been  successful, though I have not hesitated to lay under contribution  every authority likely to promote my object. The state of the French  capital, before the revolution, I have delineated from the notes I  had myself collected on the spot, and for which purpose I was, at  that time, under the necessity of consulting almost as many books as  Don Quixote read on knight-errantry; but the authors from whom I have  chiefly borrowed, are St. FOIX, MERCIER, DULAURE, PUJOULX, and BIOT.    My invariable aim has been to relate, _sine ira nec studio_, such  facts and circumstances as have come to my knowledge, and to render  to every one that justice which I should claim for myself. After a  revolution which has trenched on so many opposite interests, the  reader cannot be surprised, if information, derived from such a  variety of sources, should sometimes seem to bear the character of  party-spirit. Should this appear _on the face of the record_, I can  only say that I have avoided entering into politics, in order that no  bias of that sort might lead me to discolour or distort the truths I  have had occasion to state; and I have totally rejected those  communications which, from their tone of bitterness, personality, and  virulence, might be incompatible with the general tenour of an  impartial production.    Till the joint approbation of some competent judges, who visited the  French capital after having perused, in manuscript, several of these  letters, had stamped on them a comparative degree of value, no one  could think more lightly of them than the author. Urged repeatedly to  produce them to the public, I have yielded with reluctance, and in  the fullest confidence that, notwithstanding the recent change of  circumstances, a liberal construction will be put on my sentiments  and motives. I have taken care that my account of the national  establishments in France should be perfectly correct; and, in fact, I  have been favoured with the principal information it contains by  their respective directors. In regard to the other topics on which I  have touched, I have not failed to consult the best authorities, even  in matters, which, however trifling in themselves, acquire a relative  importance, from being illustrative of some of the many-coloured  effects of a revolution, which has humbled the pride of many,  deranged the calculations of all, disappointed the hopes of not a  few, and deceived those even by whom it had been engendered and  conducted.    Yet, whatever pains I have taken to be strictly impartial, it cannot  be denied that, in publishing a work of this description at a time  when the self-love of most men is mortified, and their resentment  awakened, I run no small risk of displeasing all parties, because I  attach myself to none, but find them all more or less deserving of  censure. Without descending either to flattery or calumny, I speak  both well and ill of the French, because I copy nature, and neither  draw an imaginary portrait, nor write a systematic narrative.

Instead, he simply asked permission to take Ajax to Dover.  He  explained that it would relieve the old man of a tiresome journey, as  well as placing a number of pounds in his pocket, for the lad purposed  paying the Russian well.    \"You see,\" he went on, \"there will be no danger of detection since I am  supposed to be leaving on an afternoon train for school.  Instead I  will come here after they have left me on board the train.  Then I can  take Ajax to Dover, you see, and arrive at school only a day late.  No  one will be the wiser, no harm will be done, and I shall have had an  extra day with Ajax before I lose him forever.\"    The plan fitted perfectly with that which Paulvitch had in mind.  Had  he known what further the boy contemplated he would doubtless have  entirely abandoned his own scheme of revenge and aided the boy whole  heartedly in the consummation of the lad's, which would have been  better for Paulvitch, could he have but read the future but a few short  hours ahead.    That afternoon Lord and Lady Greystoke bid their son good-bye and saw  him safely settled in a first-class compartment of the railway carriage  that would set him down at school in a few hours.  No sooner had they  left him, however, than he gathered his bags together, descended from  the compartment and sought a cab stand outside the station.  Here he  engaged a cabby to take him to the Russian's address.  It was dusk when  he arrived.  He found Paulvitch awaiting him.  The man was pacing the  floor nervously.  The ape was tied with a stout cord to the bed.  It  was the first time that Jack had ever seen Ajax thus secured.  He  looked questioningly at Paulvitch.  The man, mumbling, explained that  he believed the animal had guessed that he was to be sent away and he  feared he would attempt to escape.    Paulvitch carried another piece of cord in his hand.  There was a noose  in one end of it which he was continually playing with.  He walked back  and forth, up and down the room.  His pock-marked features were working  horribly as he talked silent to himself.  The boy had never seen him  thus--it made him uneasy.  At last Paulvitch stopped on the opposite  side of the room, far from the ape.    \"Come here,\" he said to the lad.  \"I will show you how to secure the  ape should he show signs of rebellion during the trip.\"    The lad laughed.  \"It will not be necessary,\" he replied.  \"Ajax will  do whatever I tell him to do.\"    The old man stamped his foot angrily.  \"Come here, as I tell you,\" he  repeated.  \"If you do not do as I say you shall not accompany the ape  to Dover--I will take no chances upon his escaping.\"    Still smiling, the lad crossed the room and stood before the Russ.    \"Turn around, with your back toward me,\" directed the latter, \"that I  may show you how to bind him quickly.\"    The boy did as he was bid, placing his hands behind him when Paulvitch  told him to do so.  Instantly the old man slipped the running noose  over one of the lad's wrists, took a couple of half hitches about his  other wrist, and knotted the cord.    The moment that the boy was secured the attitude of the man changed.  With an angry oath he wheeled his prisoner about, tripped him and  hurled him violently to the floor, leaping upon his breast as he fell.  From the bed the ape growled and struggled with his bonds.  The boy did  not cry out--a trait inherited from his savage sire whom long years in  the jungle following the death of his foster mother, Kala the great  ape, had taught that there was none to come to the succor of the fallen.    Paulvitch's fingers sought the lad's throat.  He grinned down horribly  into the face of his victim.    \"Your father ruined me,\" he mumbled.  \"This will pay him. He will think  that the ape did it.  I will tell him that the ape did it.  That I left  him alone for a few minutes, and that you sneaked in and the ape killed  you.  I will throw your body upon the bed after I have choked the life  from you, and when I bring your father he will see the ape squatting  over it,\" and the twisted fiend cackled in gloating laughter.  His  fingers closed upon the boy's throat.    Behind them the growling of the maddened beast reverberated against the  walls of the little room.  The boy paled, but no other sign of fear or  panic showed upon his countenance.  He was the son of Tarzan.  The  fingers tightened their grip upon his throat.  It was with difficulty  that he breathed, gaspingly.  The ape lunged against the stout cord  that held him.  Turning, he wrapped the cord about his hands, as a man  might have done, and surged heavily backward.  The great muscles stood  out beneath his shaggy hide.  There was a rending as of splintered  wood--the cord held, but a portion of the footboard of the bed came  away.    At the sound Paulvitch looked up.  His hideous face went white with  terror--the ape was free.    With a single bound the creature was upon him.  The man shrieked.  The  brute wrenched him from the body of the boy.  Great fingers sunk into  the man's flesh.  Yellow fangs gaped close to his throat--he struggled,  futilely--and when they closed, the soul of Alexis Paulvitch passed  into the keeping of the demons who had long been awaiting it.    The boy struggled to his feet, assisted by Akut.  For two hours under  the instructions of the former the ape worked upon the knots that  secured his friend's wrists.  Finally they gave up their secret, and  the boy was free.  Then he opened one of his bags and drew forth some  garments.  His plans had been well made.  He did not consult the beast,  which did all that he directed.  Together they slunk from the house,  but no casual observer might have noted that one of them was an ape.          Chapter 4      The killing of the friendless old Russian, Michael Sabrov, by his great  trained ape, was a matter for newspaper comment for a few days.  Lord  Greystoke read of it, and while taking special precautions not to  permit his name to become connected with the affair, kept himself well  posted as to the police search for the anthropoid.    As was true of the general public, his chief interest in the matter  centered about the mysterious disappearance of the slayer.  Or at least  this was true until he learned, several days subsequent to the tragedy,  that his son Jack had not reported at the public school en route for  which they had seen him safely ensconced in a railway carriage.  Even  then the father did not connect the disappearance of his son with the  mystery surrounding the whereabouts of the ape.  Nor was it until a  month later that careful investigation revealed the fact that the boy  had left the train before it pulled out of the station at London, and  the cab driver had been found who had driven him to the address of the  old Russian, that Tarzan of the Apes realized that Akut had in some way  been connected with the disappearance of the boy.    Beyond the moment that the cab driver had deposited his fare beside the  curb in front of the house in which the Russian had been quartered  there was no clue.  No one had seen either the boy or the ape from that  instant--at least no one who still lived.  The proprietor of the house  identified the picture of the lad as that of one who had been a  frequent visitor in the room of the old man.  Aside from this he knew  nothing.  And there, at the door of a grimy, old building in the slums  of London, the searchers came to a blank wall--baffled.    The day following the death of Alexis Paulvitch a youth accompanying  his invalid grandmother, boarded a steamer at Dover.  The old lady was  heavily veiled, and so weakened by age and sickness that she had to be  wheeled aboard the vessel in an invalid chair.    The boy would permit none but himself to wheel her, and with his own  hands assisted her from the chair to the interior of their  stateroom--and that was the last that was seen of the old lady by the  ship's company until the pair disembarked.  The boy even insisted upon  doing the work of their cabin steward, since, as he explained, his  grandmother was suffering from a nervous disposition that made the  presence of strangers extremely distasteful to her.    Outside the cabin--and none there was aboard who knew what he did in  the cabin--the lad was just as any other healthy, normal English boy  might have been.  He mingled with his fellow passengers, became a prime  favorite with the officers, and struck up numerous friendships among  the common sailors.  He was generous and unaffected, yet carried an air  of dignity and strength of character that inspired his many new friends  with admiration as well as affection for him.    Among the passengers there was an American named Condon, a noted  blackleg and crook who was \"wanted\" in a half dozen of the larger  cities of the United States.  He had paid little attention to the boy  until on one occasion he had seen him accidentally display a roll of  bank notes.  From then on Condon cultivated the youthful Briton.  He  learned, easily, that the boy was traveling alone with his invalid  grandmother, and that their destination was a small port on the west  coast of Africa, a little below the equator; that their name was  Billings, and that they had no friends in the little settlement for  which they were bound.  Upon the point of their purpose in visiting the  place Condon found the boy reticent, and so he did not push the  matter--he had learned all that he cared to know as it was.    Several times Condon attempted to draw the lad into a card game; but  his victim was not interested, and the black looks of several of the  other men passengers decided the American to find other means of  transferring the boy's bank roll to his own pocket.    At last came the day that the steamer dropped anchor in the lee of a  wooded promontory where a score or more of sheet-iron shacks making "]]]
