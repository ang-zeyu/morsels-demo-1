[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#6)"],[1,"exception  necessitated by an altogether unforeseen development, of which the less  said the better until the proper time. The foresight and imagination of a  Raffles are obviously apt to outstrip his spoken words; but even in the  course of speech his ideas would crystallise, quite palpably to the  listener, and the sentence that began by throwing out a shadowy idea  would culminate in a definite project, as the image comes into focus  under the lens, and with as much detail into the bargain.    Suffice it that after a long night of it at the Albany, and but a bath  and a cup of tea at my own flat, I found Raffles waiting for me in  Piccadilly, and down we went together to the jaws of Jermyn Street. There  we nodded, and I was proceeding down the hill when I turned on my heel as  though I had forgotten something, and entered Jermyn Street not fifty  yards behind Raffles. I had no thought of catching him up. But it so  happened that I was in his wake in time to witness a first _contretemps_  which did not amount to much at the time; this was merely the violent  exit of another of Dan Levy's early callers into the very arms of  Raffles. There was a heated apology, accepted with courteous composure,  and followed by an excited outpouring which I did not come near enough to  overhear. It was delivered by a little man in an aureole of indigo hair,  who brushed his great sombrero violently as he spoke and Raffles  listened. I could see from their manner that the collision which had just  occurred was not the subject under discussion; but I failed to  distinguish a word, though I listened outside a hatter's until Raffles  had gone in and his new acquaintance had passed me with blazing eyes and  a volley of husky vows in broken English.    \"Another of Mr. Shylock's victims,\" thought I; and indeed he might have  been bleeding internally from the loss of his pound of flesh; at any rate  there was bloodshed in his eyes.    I stood a long time outside that hatter's window, and finally went in to  choose a cap. But the light is wicked in those narrow shops, and this  necessitated my carrying several caps to the broad daylight of the  threshold to gauge their shades, and incidentally to achieve a swift  survey of the street. Then they crowned me with an ingenious apparatus  like a typewriter, to get the exact shape and measure of my skull, for I  had intimated that I had no desire to dress it anywhere else for the  future. All this must have taken up the most of twenty minutes, yet after  getting as far as Mr. Shylock's I remembered that I required what one's  hatter (and no one else) calls a \"boater,\" and back I went to order one  in addition to the cap. And as the next tack fetches the buoy, so my next  perambulation (in which, however, I was thinking seriously of a new  bowler) brought me face to face with Raffles once more.    We shouted and shook hands; our encounter had taken place almost under  the money-lender's windows, and it was so un-English in its cordiality  that between our slaps and grasps Raffles managed deftly to insert a  stout packet in my breast pocket. I cannot think the most critical  pedestrian could have seen it done. But streets have as many eyes as  Argus, and some of them are always on one.    \"They had to send to the bank for it,\" whispered Raffles. \"It barely  passed through their hands. But don't you let Shylock spot his own  envelope!\"    In another second he was saying something very different that anybody  might have heard, and in yet another he was hustling me across Shylock's  threshold. \"I'll take you up and introduce you,\" he cried aloud. \"You  couldn't come to a better man, my dear fellow--he's the only honest one  in Europe. Is Mr. Levy disengaged?\"    A stunted young gentleman, who spoke as though he had a hare-lip or was  in liquor, neither calamity having really befallen him, said that he  thought so, but would see, which he proceeded to do through a telephone,  after shifting the indicator from \"Through\" to \"Private.\" He slid off his  stool at once, and another youth, of similar appearance and still more  similar peculiarity of speech, who entered in a hurry at that moment, was  told to hold on while he showed the gentlemen up-stairs. There were other  clerks behind the mahogany bulwark, and we heard the newcomer greeting  them hoarsely as we climbed up into the presence.    Dan Levy, as I must try to call him when Raffles is not varnishing my  tale, looked a very big man at his enormous desk, but by no means so  elephantine as at the tiny table in the Savoy Restaurant a month  earlier. His privations had not only reduced his bulk to the naked eye,  but made him look ten years younger. He wore the habiliments of a  gentleman; even as he sat at his desk his well-cut coat and well-tied tie  filled me with that inconsequent respect which the silk pyjamas had  engendered in Raffles. But the great face that greeted us with a shrewd  and rather scornful geniality impressed me yet more powerfully. In its  massive features and its craggy contour it displayed the frank pugnacity  of the pugilist rather than the low cunning of the traditional usurer;  and the nose in particular, while of far healthier appearance than when I  had seen it first and last, was both dominant and menacing in its  immensity. It was a comfort to turn from this formidable countenance to  that of Raffles, who had entered with his own serene unconscious  confidence, and now introduced us with that inimitable air of  light-hearted authority which stamped him in all shades of society.    \"'Appy to meet you, sir. I hope you're well?\" said Mr. Levy, dropping one  aspirate but putting in the next with care. \"Take a seat, sir, please.\"    But I kept my legs, though I felt them near to trembling, and, diving a  hand into a breast pocket, I began working the contents out of the  envelope that Raffles had given me, while I spoke out in a tone  sufficiently rehearsed at the Albany overnight.    \"I'm not so sure about the happiness,\" said I. \"I mean about its lasting,  Mr. Levy. I come from my friend, Mr. Edward Garland.\"    \"I thought you came to borrow money!\" interposed Raffles with much  indignation. The moneylender was watching me with bright eyes and lips I  could no longer see.    \"I never said so,\" I rapped out at Raffles; and I thought I saw approval  and encouragement behind his stare like truth at the bottom of the well.    \"Who _is_ the little biter?\" the money-lender inquired of him with  delightful insolence.    \"An old friend of mine,\" replied Raffles, in an injured tone that made a  convincing end of the old friendship. \"I thought he was hard up, or I  never should have brought him in to introduce to you.\"    \"I didn't ask you for your introduction, Raffles,\" said I offensively. \"I  simply met you coming out as I was coming in. I thought you damned  officious, if you ask me!\"    Whereupon, with an Anglo-Saxon threat of subsequent violence to my  person, Raffles flung open the door to leave us to our interview. This  was exactly as it had been rehearsed. But Dan Levy called Raffles back.  And that was exactly as we had hoped.    \"Gentlemen, gentlemen!\" said the Jew. \"Please don't make a cockpit of my  office, gentlemen; and pray, Mr. Raffles, don't leave me to the mercies  of your very dangerous friend.\"    \"You can be two to one if you like,\" I gasped valiantly. \"_I_  don't care.\"    And my chest heaved in accordance with my stage instructions, as also  with a realism to which it was a relief to give full play.    \"Come now,\" said Levy. \"What did Mr. Garland send you about?\"    \"You know well enough,\" said I: \"his debt to you.\"    \"Don't be rude about it,\" said Levy. \"What about the debt?\"    \"It's a damned disgrace!\" said I.    \"I quite agree,\" he chuckled. \"It ought to 'ave been settled months ago.\"    \"Months ago?\" I echoed. \"It's only twelve months since he borrowed three  hundred pounds from you, and now you're sticking him for seven!\"    \"I am,\" said Levy, opening uncompromising lips that entirely disappeared  again next instant.    \"He borrows three hundred for a year at the outside, and you blackmail  him for eight hundred when the year's up.\"    \"You said 'seven' just now,\" interrupted Raffles, but in the voice of a  man who was getting a fright.    \"You also said 'blackmailing,'\" added Dan Levy portentously. \"Do you want  to be thrown downstairs?\"    \"Do _you_ deny the figures?\" I retorted.    \"No, I don't; have you got his repayment cards?\"    \"Yes, here in my hands, and they shan't leave them. You see, you're not  aware,\" I added severely, as I turned to Raffles, \"that this young fellow  has already paid up one hundred in instalments; that's what makes the  eight; and all this is what'll happen to you if you've been fool enough  to get into the same boat.\"    The money-lender had borne with me longer than either of us had expected  that he would; but now he wheeled back his chair and stood up, a pillar  of peril and a mouthful of oaths.    \"Is that all you've come to say?\" he thundered. \"If so, you young devil,  out you go!\"    \"No, it isn't,\" said I, spreading out a document attached to the cards of  receipt which Raffles had obtained from Teddy Garland; these I had  managed to extract without anything else from the inner pocket in which I  had been trying to empty out Raffles's envelope. \"Here,\" I continued, \"is  a letter, written only yesterday, by you to Mr. Garland, in which you  say, among other very insolent things: 'This is final, and absolutely no  excuses of any kind will be tolerated or accepted. You have given ten  times more trouble than your custom is worth, and I shall be glad to get  rid of you. So you had better pay up before twelve o'clock to-morrow, as  you may depend that the above threats will be carried out to the very  letter, and steps will be taken to carry them into effect at that hour.
