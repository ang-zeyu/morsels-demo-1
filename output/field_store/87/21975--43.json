All ungalled of  him is each courtier's heel or great man's kibe. Yet, is not even his  every-day clothing unseemly, or his aspect unprepossessing. He casts  as broad and proper a shadow in the sun as any other man. Black he is,  indeed, but comely, like the daughters of Jerusalem.--To begin with the  hat which he has honoured with a preference--what are your operas or  your fire-shovels beside it? they must instantly (on a fair comparison)  sink many degrees below zero in the scale of contempt. In a word, I  would make bold to assert that it unites in perfection the two grand  requisites of a head covering, beauty and comfort. Gentlemen may smile  at this if they will, and take exception to my taste; but, I ask, does  the modern round hat, whatever the insignificant variations of its form,  possess either quality? No, not a jot of it. One would think, by our  pertinacious adherence to the head-ach giving, circular conformation,  that we wished to show our anger at the Almighty for not shaping our  caputs like cylinders. In fine, though the parson's and the quaker's hat  has each its several merits, commend me to the fan-tailed _shallow_.  The flap part attached to the cap seems, at first sight, as to use,  supernecessary, although so ornamental withal. It no doubt (as its  name, indeed indicates) had its origin in gallantry, and was invented  in the age of fans, for the purpose of cooling their mistresses'  bosoms, heated--as they would necessarily be--at fair time, by their  gravel-grinding walks, under a fervid sun, to the elegant revels of  West-end, of Greenwich, or of Tothill-fields. Breeches, rejected by  common consent of young and old alike, cling to the legs of the  coalheaver with an abiding fondness, as to the last place of refuge;  and, on gala-days, a dandy might die of envy to mark the splendour  of those nether integuments--which he has not soul enough to dare  to wear--of brilliant eye-arresting blue, or glowing scarlet plush,  glittering in the sun's rays, giving and taking glory! But enough of  the dress of these select \"true-born Englishmen\"--for right glad I am  to state that there are but _two_ Scotch coalheavers on the whole  river, and _no_ Irish. I beg leave to return to the more important  consideration of their manners. Most people you meet in your walks in  the common thoroughfare of London, glide, shuffle, or crawl onward, as  if they conscientiously thought they had no manner of right to tread the  earth but on sufferance. Not so our coalheaver. Mark how erect _he_  walks! how firm a keel he presents to the vainly breasting human tide  that comes rolling on with a show of opposition to his onward course!  It is he, and he only, who preserves, in his gait and in his air,  the self-sustained and conscious dignity of the first-created man.  Surrounded by an inferior creation, he gives the wall to none. That  pliancy of temper, which is wont to make itself known by the waiving  a point or renouncing a principle for others' advantage, in him  has no place; he either knows it not, or else considers it a poor,  mean-spirited, creeping baseness, altogether unworthy of his imitation,  and best befitted with ineffable contempt. He neither dreads the contact  of the baker--the Scylla of the metropolitan peripatetic, nor yet shuns  the dire collision of the chimney-sweep--his Charybdis. Try to pass him  as he walks leisurely on, making the solid earth ring with his bold  tread, and you will experience more difficulties in the attempt than did  that famous admiral, Bartholomew Diaz, when he first doubled the Cape of  Storms. Or let us suppose, that haply you allow your frail carcass to go  full drive against his sturdiness, when lo!--in beautiful illustration  of those doctrines in projectiles, that relate to the concussion of  moving bodies--you fly off at an angle \"right slick\" into the middle of  the carriage-way; whence a question of some interest presently arises,  whether you will please to be run over by a short or a long stage.--But  to return. Who hesitates to make way for a coalheaver? As for their  drays--as _consecutive_ a species of vehicles as a body can be stopped  by--every one knows they make way for themselves.    I one Sunday met a party of my favourites in St. Paul's cathedral.  They seemed to view with becoming respect and even awe that splendid  place; and they listened to and observed, with apparent profound  attention, the cathedral service. Yet I must confess my favourable  opinion of their grave looks was rather staggered by overhearing  afterwards one of them say to his neighbour, casting a look all round  the while, \"My eyes, Tom, what lots o' _coals_ this here place would  hold.\" Perhaps the observation was meant in honour.    _Monthly Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *      TRAVELLING FARE.      If you shut yourself up for some fifty hours or so in a mail-coach,  that keeps wheeling along at the rate of ten miles an hour, and  changes horses in half a minute, certainly, for obvious reasons, the  less you eat and drink the better; and perhaps a few hundred daily  drops of laudanum, or equivalent grains of opium, would be advisable,  so that the transit from London to Edinburgh might be performed in a  phantasma. But a free agent ought to live well on his travels--some  degrees better, without doubt, than when at home. People seldom live  very well at home. There is always something requiring to be eaten up,  that it may not be lost, which destroys the soothing and satisfactory  symmetry of an unexceptionable dinner. We have detected the same duck  through many unprincipled disguises, playing a different part in the  farce of domestic economy, with a versatility hardly to have been  expected in one of the most generally despised of the web-footed  tribe. When travelling at one's own sweet will, one feeds at a  different inn every meal; and, except when the coincidence of  circumstances is against you, there is an agreeable variety both  in the natural and artificial disposition of the dishes.    _Blackwood's Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *      ENGLISH FRUITS.    (_Continued from page 231_.)      _The Currant_--The native place of this useful fruit is not exactly  ascertained; nearly allied to the gooseberry, it receives the same  treatment, shows the same changes, and may be further improved by  the same means; a cross between the white Dutch and red, might be a  valuable mule. It is probable the black also may be induced to sport  from that steady character it has hitherto maintained; there are but  few domesticated plants but which (like animals) depart, in some way  or other, from their native caste.    _The Apple_.--It is difficult to find adequate terms to set forth  the value of the advantages which have accrued to mankind from the  cultivation of this deservedly high-prized fruit. One circumstance  in the history of the apple must not pass unnoticed here, viz., the  deterioration of the old sorts, which regaled and were the boast  of our forefathers a century ago. It is the opinion of an eminent  orchardist that as the apple is an artificial production, and, as  such, has its stages of youth, maturity, and old age, it cannot, in  its period of decrepitude, be by any means renovated to its pristine  state, either by pruning or cutting down, changing its place, or by  transferring its parts to young and vigorous stocks; and that, in  whatever station it may be placed, it carries with it the decay and  diseases of its parent. This is the most rational account which has  been given of this indisputable fact; and though its accuracy has been  called in question by some naturalists, the general failure in our  old orchards, and the difficulties in forming new ones with the old  favourite sorts, is a decisive proof that such deterioration exists.  It is therefore the chief object of the modern pomologist, to obtain  from seeds of the best _wildings_ new varieties wherewith to form new  and profitable orchards; and which may be expected to continue in  health and fertility, as the old sorts have done, for the next  century.    The foregoing are the fruits found wild in our climate; the difference  in their aboriginal and cultivated state has been pointed out; we  shall now give short descriptions of foreign fruits, which have been  partly naturalized, the management of which forms so considerable a  share of the gardener's art and attention.    _The Apricot_.--It is supposed that this fruit is a native of Africa:  from thence it appears to have come through Persia and Greece to us,  with the name \"a praecox,\" significant of its earliness. There are  several varieties which have been obtained by means similar to those  already mentioned; and there is room for further exertion in  endeavouring to improve the size of the fruit, or any other desirable  quality.    _The Peach_--This delicate and excellent fruit is a striking instance  of what judicious cultivation may produce. The common almond has  always been considered the original stock of this monument of skill  and assiduity. The estimation in which it is held, and the care and  expense incurred in its cultivation both in forcing-houses and in the  open air, is proof of its superiority: and no fruit repays the labour  of the attendant, or the expense of the owner, more bountifully than  this. Seedlings of this fruit are, if we can credit what is written  and said of it, less inclined to depart from the properties or  qualities of the parent, than most others of our improved fruits. In  America, they are in common and general cultivation. No trouble is  bestowed in either layering (which is practicable), or budding them.

The president was the Honourable Simon Butler: beside him, on a lower  seat, sat the secretary. His uncovered head, and unshaded temples  received the full light of the suspended lamp. It was one of those  finely chiselled heads, which arrest the imagination, and seem to bear  incontrovertible evidence of the certainty of physiognomical science. A  dress particularly studied, was singularly contrasted with the athletic  figure and antique bearing of this interesting looking person. For  though unpowdered locks, and the partial uncovering of a muscular neck,  by the loose tie of the silk handkerchief had something of the  simplicity of republicanism, yet the fine diamond chat sparkled at the  shirt breast, and the glittering of two watch-chains (the foppery of the  day), exhibited an aristocracy of toilet, which did not exactly assort  with the Back-lane graces. The secretary of the United Irishmen, was  Archibald Hamilton Rowan.    On the opposite side sat a small, well-formed, and animated person, who  was talking with singular vivacity of look and gesture, to one of  extremely placid and even formal appearance. The first was the gay,  gallant, and patriotic founder of the society, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the  other was the celebrated and clever Doctor Drennan, a skilful physician,  and an elegant writer, who might have passed in appearance, for the  demure minister of some remote village-congregation of the Scotch kirk.    A tail, elegant, and sentimental looking person sat near to them, in an  attitude of interested attention, listening to the speaker, to whom, it  seemed, he was about to reply. It was Thomas Addas Emmet, the son of the  state physician of Ireland--then a young lawyer of great promise, and  now the Attorney-General of New York. The handsome and animated Dr.  Mackenna, one of the most popular writers of the day, and Oliver Bond,  the representative of the most reputable class of merchants, had grouped  forward their intelligent heads; while one who brought no personal  beauty to the cause (that letter of recommendation to all causes), James  Napper Tandy, stood waiting with a packet of letters, which he had  received in his former quality of secretary to the meeting.    While other leaders of the Union distinguished for their birth, talents,  or principles (and it is remarkable that they were all protestants),  filled up the seats near the head of the table; more mixed groups less  distinguished by the _beau sang_, which then came forth, in the fine  forms of the genuine Irish gentry of both sects, were congregated in the  obscurity of the bottom of the room--_Lady Morgan's O'Briens and  O'Flahertys._           *       *       *       *       *    STORY OF RICHARD PLANTAGENET, SON OF RICHARD III.    It was on this awful night (the night preceding the battle of Bosworth  Field), according to a letter which I have read from Dr. Thomas Brett to  Dr. William Warren, president of Trinity-hall, that the king took his  last farewell in his tent of Richard Plantagenet, his natural son, who  himself thus describes that interview:--\"I was boarded with a Latin  schoolmaster, without knowing who my parents were, till I was fifteen or  sixteen years old; only a gentleman, who acquainted me he was no  relative of mine, came once a quarter and paid for my board, and took  care to see that I wanted for nothing. One day this gentleman took me  and carried me to a great fine house, where I passed through several  stately rooms, in one of which he left me, bidding me stay there. Then a  man richly dressed, with a star and garter, came to me, asked me some  questions, talked kindly to me, and gave me some money. Then the  fore-mentioned gentleman returned, and conducted me back to my school.    \"Some time after, the same gentleman came to me again with a horse and  proper accoutrements, and told me I must take a journey with him into  the country. We went into Leicestershire, and came to Bosworth Field,  and I was carried to king Richard's tent. The king embraced me, and told  me I was his son. 'But, child,' said he, 'to-morrow I must fight for my  crown. And assure yourself if I lose that, I will lose my life too; but  I hope to preserve both. Do you stand on yonder hill, where you may see  the battle out of danger, and when I have gained the victory, come to  me; I will then own you to be mine, and take care of you. But if I  should be so unfortunate as to lose the battle, then shift as well as  you can, and take care to let no one know that I am your father; for no  mercy will be shown to any one so nearly related to me.' The king then  presented me with a purse of gold, and giving me a farewell embrace,  dismissed me from his tent. I followed the king's directions; and when I  saw the battle lost and the king killed, I hastened back to London, sold  my horse and fine clothes, and the better to conceal myself from all  suspicion of being son to a king, and that I might have the means to  live by my honest labour, I put myself apprentice to a bricklayer. But  having a competent skill in the Latin tongue, I was unwilling to lose  it; and having an inclination also to reading, and no delight in the  conversation of those I am obliged to work with, I generally spend all  the time I have to spare in reading by myself.\"    The letter says, \"When Sir Thomas Moyle built Eastwell House, near  London, about the year, 1544, he observed his chief bricklayer, whenever  he left off work, retired with a book. Sir Thomas had curiosity to know  what book the man read, but was some time before he could discover it;  he still putting the book up if any one came toward him. However, at  last Sir Thomas surprised him, and snatched the book from him, and  looking into it found it to be Latin. He then examined him, and finding  he pretty well understood that language, he inquired how he came by his  learning. Hereupon the man told him, as he had beer, a good master to  him, he would venture to trust him with a secret he had never before  revealed to any one. He then related the above story. Sir Thomas said,  'You are now old, and almost past your labour; I will give you the  running of my kitchen as long as you live.' He answered, 'Sir, you have  a numerous family; I have been used to live retired, give me leave to  build a house of one room for myself in such a field, and there, with  your good leave, I will live and die.' Sir Thomas granted his request,  he built his house, and there continued to his death. Richard  Plantagenet was buried the 22nd day of December, anno ut supra ex  registro de Eastwell sub 1550. This is all the register mentions of him,  so that we cannot say whether he was buried in the church or  church-yard; nor is there now any other memorial of him except the  tradition in the family, and some little marks where his house stood.  This story my late Lord Heneage, earl of Winchelsea, told me in the year  1720.\" Thus lived and died, in low and poor obscurity, the only  remaining son of Richard III!    _Tale of a Modern Genius._           *       *       *       *       *    FINE ARTS.           *       *       *       *       *    ART OF MOSAIC.    At Rome are many minor fine arts practised, which are wholly unknown in  England. The most remarkable of them is the _Mosaic Manufactory_,  carried on at the cost of government: and its fruits are theirs. The  workmen are constantly occupied in copying paintings for altarpieces,  though the works of the first masters are fast mouldering away on the  walls of forgotten churches. They will soon be lost forever; it is yet  possible to render them imperishable by means of Mosaic copies; and why  is it not done? The French, at Milan, set an example of this, by  copying, in mosaic, the _Last Supper_ of Leonardo da Vinci; but it was  their plan to do much for Milan, and nothing for Rome; and the  invaluable frescos of Michael Angelo, Raphael, Domenichino, and Guido,  were left to perish.    It takes about seven or eight years to finish a mosaic copy of a  painting of the ordinary historical size, two men being constantly  employed. It generally costs from eight to ten thousand crowns, but the  time and expense are of course regulated by the intricacy of the subject  and quantity of work. Raphael's _Transfiguration_, cost about 12,000  crowns, and the labour of nine years, ten men constantly working at it.  The late works, are, however, of very inferior execution.    The slab upon which the mosaic is made, is generally of Travertine, (or  Tiburtine) stones, connected together by iron cramps. Upon the surface  of this a mastic or cementing paste, is gradually spread, as the  progress of the work makes it wanted, which forms the adhesive ground,  or bed, on which the mosaic is laid. This mastic is composed of fine  lime from burnt marble, and finely powdered Travertine stone, mixed to  the consistence of a paste, with strong linseed oil. Into this paste are  stuck the _smalts_, of which the mosaic picture is formed. They are a  mixed species of opaque vitrified glass, partaking of the mixed nature  of stone and glass, and composed of a variety of minerals and materials,  coloured for the most part, with different metallic oxydes. Of these no  less than 1,700 different shades are in use; they are manufactured in  Rome in the form of long, slender rods like wires, of different degrees  of thickness, and are cut into pieces of the requisite sizes, from the  smallest pin point to an inch. When the picture is completely finished,  and the cement thoroughly dried, it is highly polished.  "]]]
