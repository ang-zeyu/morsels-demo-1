There, many an hour, his flaxen-haired Christine,  Sang to her child, her first-born, Magdalen,  Or watched her playing, a flower among the flowers.  Dark in the centre of that zone of bliss  Arose the magic towers of Tycho Brahe.  Two of them had great windows in their roofs  Opening upon the sky where'er he willed,  And under these observatories he made  A library of many a golden book;  Poets and sages of old Greece and Rome,  And many a mellow legend, many a dream  Of dawning truth in Egypt, or the dusk  Of Araby. Under all of these he made  A subterranean crypt for alchemy,  With sixteen furnaces; and, under this,  He sank a well, so deep, that Jeppe declared  He had tapped the central fountains of the world,  And drew his magic from those cold clear springs.  This was the very well, said Jeppe, the dwarf,  Where Truth was hidden; but, by Tycho Brahe  And his weird skill, the magic water flowed,  Through pipes, uphill, to all the house above:  The kitchen where his cooks could broil a trout  For sages or prepare a feast for kings;  The garrets for the students in the roof;  The guest-rooms, and the red room to the north,  The study and the blue room to the south;  The small octagonal yellow room that held  The sunlight like a jewel all day long,  And Magdalen, with her happy dreams, at night;  Then, facing to the west, one long green room,  The ceiling painted like the bower of Eve  With flowers and leaves, the windows opening wide  Through which Christine and Tycho Brahe at dawn  Could see the white sails drifting on the Sound  Like petals from their orchard.                                  To the north,  He built a printing house for noble books,  Poems, and those deep legends of the sky,  Still to be born at his Uraniborg.  Beyond the rampart to the north arose  A workshop for his instruments. To the south  A low thatched farm-house rambled round a yard  Alive with clucking hens; and, further yet  To southward on another hill, he made  A great house for his larger instruments,  And called it Stiernborg, mountain of the stars.    And, on his towers and turrets, Tycho set  Statues with golden verses in the praise  Of famous men, the bearers of the torch,  From Ptolemy to the new Copernicus.  Then, in that storm-proof mountain of the stars,  He set in all their splendour of new-made brass  His armouries for the assault of heaven,--  Circles in azimuth, armillary spheres,  Revolving zodiacs with great brazen rings;  Quadrants of solid brass, ten cubits broad,  Brass parallactic rules, made to revolve  In azimuth; clocks with wheels; an astrolabe;  And that large globe strengthened by oaken beams  He made at Augsburg.                       All his gold he spent;  But Denmark had a prince in those great days;  And, in his brain, the dreams of Tycho Brahe  Kindled a thirst for glory. So he made  Tycho the Lord of sundry lands and rents,  And Keeper of the Chapel where the kings  Of Oldenburg were buried; for he said  \"To whom could all these kings entrust their bones  More fitly than to him who read the stars,  And though a mortal, knew immortal laws;  And paced, at night, the silent halls of heaven.\"          VI      He was a great magician, Tycho Brahe.  There, on his island, for a score of years,  He watched the skies, recording star on star,  For future ages, and, by patient toil,  Perfected his great tables of the sun,  The moon, the planets.                         There, too happy far  For any history, sons and daughters rose,  A little clan of love, around Christine;  And Tycho thought, when I am dead, my sons  Will rule and work in my Uraniborg.  And yet a doubt would trouble him, for he knew  The children of Christine would still be held  Ignoble, by the world.                         Disciples came,  Young-eyed and swift, the bearers of the torch  From many a city to Uraniborg,  And Tycho Brahe received them like a king,  And bade them light their torches at his fire.  The King of Scotland came, with all his court,  And dwelt eight days in Tycho Brahe's domain,  Asking him many a riddle, deep and dark,  Whose answer, none the less, a king should know.  What boots it on this earth to be a king,  To rule a part of earth, and not to know  The worth of his own realm, whether he rule  As God's vice-gerent, and his realm be still  The centre of the centre of all worlds;  Or whether, as Copernicus proclaimed,  This earth itself be moving, a lost grain  Of dust among the innumerable stars?  For this would dwarf all glory but the soul,  In king or peasant, that can hail the truth,  Though truth should slay it.                               So to Tycho Brahe,  The king became a subject for eight days.  But, in the crowded hall, when he had gone,  Jeppe raised his matted head, with a chuckle of glee,  Quiet as the gurgle of joy in a dark rock-pool,  When the first ripple and wash of the first spring-tide  Flows bubbling under the dry sun-blackened fringe  Of seaweed, setting it all afloat again,  In magical colours, like a merman's hair.  \"Jeppe has a thought,\" the gay young students cried,  Thronging him round, for all believed that Jeppe  Was fey, and had strange visions of the truth.  \"What is the thought, Jeppe?\"                                \"I can think no thoughts,\"  Croaked Jeppe. \"But I have made myself a song.\"  \"Silence,\" they cried, \"for Jeppe the nightingale!  Sing, Jeppe!\"    And, wagging his great head to and fro  Before the fire, with deep dark eyes, he crooned:        THE SONG OF JEPPE    \"What!\" said the king,     \"Is earth a bird or bee?   Can this uncharted boundless realm of ours  Drone thro' the sky, with leagues of struggling sea,    Forests, and hills, and towns, and palace-towers?\"   \"Ay,\" said the dwarf,     \"I have watched from Stiernborg's crown    Her far dark rim uplift against the sky;  But, while earth soars, men say the stars  go down;    And, while earth sails, men say the stars go by.\"  An elvish tale!      Ask Jeppe, the dwarf! _He_ knows.    That's why his eyes look fey; for, chuckling deep,  Heels over head amongst the stars he goes,    As all men go; but most are sound asleep.  King, saint, sage,      Even those that count it true,    Act as this miracle touched them not at all.  They are borne, undizzied, thro' the rushing blue,    And build their empires on a sky-tossed ball.    Then said the king,      \"If earth so lightly move,    What of my realm? O, what shall now stand sure?\"  \"Naught,\" said the dwarf, \"in all this world, but love.    All else is dream-stuff and shall not endure.  'Tis nearer now!      Our universe hath no centre,    Our shadowy earth and fleeting heavens no stay,  But that deep inward realm which each can enter,    Even Jeppe, the dwarf, by his own secret way.\"    \"Where?\" said the king,      \"O, where? I have not found it!\"    \"Here,\" said the dwarf, and music echoed \"here.\"  \"This infinite circle hath no line to bound it;    Therefore that deep strange centre is everywhere.  Let the earth soar thro' heaven, that centre abideth;    Or plunge to the pit, His covenant still holds true.  In the heart of a dying bird, the Master hideth;    In the soul of a king,\" said the dwarf,      \"and in _my_ soul, too.\"          VII      Princes and courtiers came, a few to seek  A little knowledge, many more to gape  In wonder at Tycho's gold and silver mask;  Or when they saw the beauty of his towers,  Envy and hate him for them.                              Thus arose  The small grey cloud upon the distant sky,  That broke in storm at last.                               \"Beware,\" croaked Jeppe,  Lifting his shaggy head beside the fire,  When guests like these had gone, \"Master, beware!\"  And Tycho of the frank blue eyes would laugh.  Even when he found Witichius playing him false    His anger, like a momentary breeze,  Died on the dreaming deep; for Tycho Brahe  Turned to a nobler riddle,--\"Have you thought,\"  He asked his young disciples, \"how the sea  Is moved to that strange rhythm we call the tides?  He that can answer this shall have his name  Honoured among the bearers of the torch  While Pegasus flies above Uraniborg.  I was delayed three hours or more to-day  By the neap-tide. The fishermen on the coast  Are never wrong. They time it by the moon.  _Post hoc_, perhaps, not _propter hoc_; and yet  Through all the changes of the sky and sea  That old white clock of ours with the battered face  Does seem infallible.                        There's a love-song too,  The sailors on the coast of Sweden sing,  I have often pondered it. Your courtly poets  Upbraid the inconstant moon. But these men know  The moon and sea are lovers, and they move  In a most constant measure. Hear the words  And tell me, if you can, what silver chains  Bind them together.\" Then, in a voice as low  And rhythmical as the sea, he spoke that song:        THE SHEPHERDESS OF THE SEA      Reproach not yet our sails' delay;    You cannot see the shoaling bay,    The banks of sand, the fretful bars,    That ebb left naked to the stars.      The sea's white shepherdess, the moon,      Shall lead us into harbour soon.      Dear, when you see her glory shine    Between your fragrant boughs of pine,    Know there is but one hour to wait    Before her hands unlock the gate,      And the full flood of singing foam      Follow her lovely footsteps home.      Then waves like flocks of silver sheep    Come rustling inland from the deep,    And into rambling valleys press    Behind their heavenly shepherdess.      You cannot see them? Lift your eyes      And see their mistress in the skies.    She rises with her silver bow.      I feel the tide begin to flow;    And every thought and hope and dream    Follow her call, and homeward stream.    Borne on the universal tide,    The wanderer hastens to his bride.

Such are these human books:  their brilliancy attracts all eyes, but between the purple covers lurks  many a horrid tale. Turn over the pages of any one of them, and you find  a drama worthy the pen of Sophocles or Euripides: close the volume--all  is gilt edge and exquisite tooling. Well may they hate the confidants of  such crimes, and plot their destruction! What if the outcast should take  to rehearsing in public the tragedy that he has got by heart?    I am minded to give you, after the manner of Cebes, a life-picture of  Dependence; with this before your eyes, you may judge for yourself,  whether it is the life for you. I would gladly call in the aid of an  Apelles or a Parrhasius, an Aetion or a Euphranor, but no such perfect  painters are to be found in these days; I must sketch you the picture in  outline as best I can. I begin then with tall golden gates, not set in  the plain, but high upon a hill. Long and steep and slippery is the  ascent; and many a time when a man looks to reach the top, his foot  slips, and he is plunged headlong. Within the gates sits Wealth, a figure  all of gold (so at least she seems); most fair, most lovely. Her lover  painfully scales the height, and draws near to the door; and that golden  sight fills him with amazement. The beautiful woman in gorgeous raiment  who now takes him by the hand is Hope. As she leads him in, his spirit is  stricken with awe. Hope still shows the way; but two others, Despair and  Servitude, now take charge of him, and conduct him to Toil, who grinds  the poor wretch down with labour, and at last hands him over to Age. He  looks sickly now, and all his colour is gone. Last comes Contempt, and  laying violent hands on him drags him into the presence of Despair; it is  now time for Hope to take wing and vanish. Naked, potbellied, pale and  old, he is thrust forth, not by those golden gates by which he entered,  but by some obscure back-passage. One hand covers his nakedness; with the  other he would fain strangle himself. Now let Regret meet him without,  dropping vain tears and heaping misery on misery,--and my picture is  complete.    Examine it narrowly in all its details, and see whether you like the idea  of going in at my golden front door, to be expelled ignominiously at the  back. And whichever way you decide, remember the words of the wise man:  'Blame not Heaven, but your own choice.'          APOLOGY FOR 'THE DEPENDENT SCHOLAR'      DEAR SABINUS,    I have been guessing how you are likely to have expressed yourself upon  reading my essay about dependants. I feel pretty sure you read it all and  had a laugh over it; but it is your running and general comment in words  that I am trying to piece on to it. If I am any good at divination, this  is the sort of thing: _To think that a man can set down such a scathing  indictment of the life, and then forget it all, get hold of the other end  of the stick, and plunge headlong into such manifest conspicuous slavery!  Take Midas, Croesus, golden Pactolus, roll them into one, multiply them,  and could they induce him to relinquish the freedom which he has loved  and consorted with from a child? He is nearly in the clutches of Aeacus,  one foot is on the ferryman's boat, and it is now that he lets himself be  dragged submissively about by a golden collar._ [Footnote: Omitting as  a scholium, with Dindorf and Fritzsche, the words: hoia esti ton  tryphonton plousion ta sphingia kai ta kourallia.] _There is some  slight inconsistency between his life and his treatise; the rivers are  running up-hill; topsy-turvydom prevails; our recantations are new-  fashioned; the first palinodist_ [Footnote: See _Stesichorus_ in  Notes.] _mended words with words for Helen of Troy; but we spoil words  (those words we thought so wise) with deeds._    Such, I imagine, were your inward remarks. And I dare say you will give  me some overt advice to the same effect; well, it will not be ill-timed;  it will illustrate your friendship, and do you credit as a good man and a  philosopher. If I render your part respectably for you, that will do, and  we will pay our homage to the God of words; [Footnote: i.e. Hermes.] if I  fail, you will fill in the deficiency for yourself. There, the stage is  ready; I am to hold my tongue, and submit to any necessary carving and  cauterizing for my good, and you are to plaster me, and have your scalpel  handy, and your iron red-hot. Sabinus takes the word, and thus addresses  me:    _My dear friend, this treatise of yours has quite rightly been earning  you a fine reputation, from its first delivery before the great audience  I had described to me, to its private use by the educated who have  consulted and thumbed it since. For indeed it presents the case  meritoriously; there is study of detail and experience of life in  abundance; your views are the reverse of vague; and above all the book is  practically useful, chiefly but not exclusively to the educated whom it  might save from an unforeseen slavery. However, your mind is changed; the  life you described is now the better; good-bye to freedom; your motto is  that contemptible line:      Give me but gain, I'll turn from free to slave.    Let none hear the lecture from you again, then; see to it that no copy of  it comes under the eyes of any one aware of your present life; ask Hermes  to bring Lethe-water from below, enough to drug your former hearers; else  you will remind us of the Corinthian tale, and your writing, like  Bellerophon's, be your own condemnation. I assure you I see no decent  defence you can make, at least if your detractors have the humour to  commend the independence of the writings while the writer is a slave and  a voluntary beast of burden before their eyes.    They will say with some plausibility: Either the book is some other  good man's work, and you a jackdaw strutting in borrowed, plumes; or, if  it is really yours, you are a second Salaethus; the Crotoniate legislator  made most severe laws against adultery, was much looked up to on the  strength of it, and was shortly after taken in adultery with his  brother's wife. You are an exact reproduction of Salaethus, they will  say; or rather he was not half so bad as you, seeing that he was mastered  by passion, as he pleaded in court, and moreover preferred to leap  into the flames, like a brave man, when the Crotoniates were moved to  compassion and gave him the alternative of exile. The difference between  _your_ precept and practice is infinitely more ridiculous; you draw  a realistic word-picture of that servile life; you pour contempt on the  man who runs into the trap of a rich man's house, where a thousand  degradations, half of them self-inflicted, await him; and then in extreme  old age, when you are on the border between life and death, you take this  miserable servitude upon you and make a sort of circus exhibition of your  chains. The conspicuousness of your position will only make the more  ridiculous that contrast between your book and your life.    But I need not beat my brains for phrases of reprobation; there is one  good enough in a noble tragedy:      Wisdom begins at home; no wisdom, else.    And your censors will find no lack of illustrations against you; some  will compare you to the tragic actor; on the stage he is Agamemnon or  Creon or great Heracles; but off it, stripped of his mask, he is just  Polus or Aristodemus, a hireling liable to be hissed off, or even whipped  on occasion, at the pleasure of the audience. Others will say you have  had the experience of Queen Cleopatra's monkey: the docile creature used  to dance in perfect form and time, and was much admired for the  regularity and decorum of its movements, adapted to the voices and  instruments of a bridal chorus; alas, one day it spied a fig or almond a  little way off on the ground; flutes and measures and steps were all  forgotten, the mask was far off in several pieces, and there was he  chewing his find.    You, they will say, are the author (for 'actor' would understate the  case) who has laid down the laws of noble conduct; and no sooner is the  lump of figs presented than the monkey is revealed; your lips are the  lips of a philosopher, and your heart is quite other; it is no injustice  to say that those sentiments for which you claim admiration have 'wetted  your lips, and left your palate dry.' You have not had to wait long for  retribution; you spoke unadvisedly in scorn of human needs; and, this  little while after, behold you making public renunciation of your  freedom! Surely Nemesis was standing behind your back as you drank in the  flattering tributes to your superiority; did she not smile in her divine  fore-knowledge of the impending change, and mark how you forgot to  propitiate her before you assailed the victims whom fortune's mutability  had reduced to such courses?    Now I want you to imagine a rhetorician writing on the theme that  Aeschines, after his indictment of Timarchus, was himself proved guilty  by eyewitnesses of similar iniquity; would, or would not, the amusement  of the audience be heightened by the fact that he had got Timarchus  punished for offences excused by youth, whereas he was himself an old man  at the time of his own guilt? Why, you are like the quack who offered a  cough-mixture which was to cure instantaneously, and could hardly get the  promise out for coughing._    Yes, Sabinus, and there is plenty more of the same sort for an accuser  like you to urge; the subject is all handles; you can take hold of it  anywhere. I have been looking about for my best line of defence. Had I  better turn craven, face right-about, confess my sin, and have recourse  to the regular plea of Chance, Fate, Necessity? Shall I humbly beseech my  critics to pardon me, remembering that nothing is in a man's own choice--  we are led by some stronger power, one of the three I mentioned, probably,  and are not true"]]]
