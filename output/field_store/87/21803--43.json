And when the Army prayed, the Pretty Girl knelt down with the rest on  the gravel. One or two tall bushmen bowed their heads as if they had to,  and One-eyed Bogan, with the blood washed from his face, stood with his  hat off, glaring round to see if he could catch anyone sniggering.    Mitchell, the shearer, said afterwards that the whole business made him  feel for the moment like he felt sometimes in the days when he used to  feel things.    The town discussed the Pretty Girl in the Army that night and for many  days thereafter, but no one could find out who she was or where she  belonged to--except that she came from Sydney last. She kept her secret,  if she had one, very close--or else the other S.-A. women were not to be  pumped. She lived in skillion-rooms at the back of the big weather-board  Salvation Army barracks with two other \"lassies,\" who did washing and  sewing and nursing, and went shabby, and half starved themselves, and  were baked in the heat, like scores of women in the bush, and even as  hundreds of women, suffering from religious mania, slave and stint in  city slums, and neglect their homes, husbands and children--for the  glory of Booth.    The Pretty Girl was referred to as Sister Hannah by the Army people,  and came somehow to be known by sinners as \"Miss Captain.\" I don't know  whether that was her real name or what rank she held in the Army, if  indeed she held any.    She sold _War Crys_, and the circulation doubled in a day. One-eyed  Bogan, being bailed up unexpectedly, gave her \"half a caser\" for a  _Cry_, and ran away without the paper or the change. Jack Mitchell  bought a _Cry_ for the first time in his life, and read it. He said  he found some of the articles intensely realistic, and many of the  statements were very interesting. He said he read one or two things in  the _Cry_ that he didn't know before. Tom Hall, taken unawares, bought  three _Crys_ from the Pretty Girl, and blushed to find it fame.    Little Billy Woods, the Labourers' Union secretary--who had a poetic  temperament and more than the average bushman's reverence for higher  things--Little Billy Woods told me in a burst of confidence that he  generally had two feelings, one after the other, after encountering  that girl. One was that unfathomable far-away feeling of loneliness and  longing, that comes at odd times to the best of married men, with the  best of wives and children--as Billy had. The other feeling, which  came later on, and was a reaction in fact, was the feeling of a man who  thinks he's been twisted round a woman's little finger for the benefit  of somebody else. Billy said that he couldn't help being reminded by the  shy, sweet smile and the shy, sweet \"thank you\" of the Pretty Girl in  the Army, of the shy, sweet smile and the shy, sweet gratitude of a  Sydney private barmaid, who had once roped him in, in the days before  he was married. Then he'd reckon that the Army lassie had been sent out  back to Bourke as a business speculation.    Tom Hall was inclined to reckon so too--but that was after he'd been  chaffed for a month about the three _War Crys_.    The Pretty Girl was discussed from psychological points of view; not  forgetting the sex problem. Donald Macdonald--shearer, union leader and  labour delegate to other colonies on occasion--Donald Macdonald said  that whenever he saw a circle of plain or ugly, dried-up women or  girls round a shepherd, evangelist or a Salvation Army drum, he'd say  \"sexually starved!\" They were hungry for love. Religious mania was  sexual passion dammed out of its course. Therefore he held that morbidly  religious girls were the most easily seduced.    But this couldn't apply to Pretty Girl in the Army. Mitchell  reckoned that she'd either had a great sorrow--a lot of trouble, or a  disappointment in love (the \"or\" is Mitchell's); but they couldn't see  how a girl like her could possibly be disappointed in love--unless the  chap died or got into jail for life. Donald decided that her soul had  been starved somehow.    Mitchell suggested that it might be only a craving for notoriety, the  same thing that makes women and girls go amongst lepers, and out to the  battlefield, and nurse ugly pieces of men back to life again; the same  thing that makes some women and girls swear ropes round men's necks.  The Pretty Girl might be the daughter of well-to-do people--even  aristocrats, said Mitchell--she was pretty enough and spoke well enough.  \"Every woman's a barmaid at heart,\" as the _Bulletin_ puts it, said  Mitchell.    But not even one of the haggard women of Bourke ever breathed a  suspicion of scandal against her. They said she was too good and too  pretty to be where she was. You see it was not as in an old settled town  where hags blacken God's world with their tongues. Bourke was just a  little camping town in a big land, where free, good-hearted democratic  Australians, and the best of black sheep from the old world were  constantly passing through; where husband's were often obliged to be  away from home for twelve months, and the storekeepers had to trust the  people, and mates trusted each other, and the folks were broad-minded.  The mind's eye had a wide range.    After her maiden speech the Pretty Girl seldom spoke, except to return  thanks for collections--and she never testified. She had a sweet voice  and used to sing.    Now, if I were writing pure fiction, and were not cursed with an  obstinate inclination to write the truth, I might say that, after the  advent of the Pretty Girl, the morals of Bourke improved suddenly and  wonderfully. That One-eyed Bogan left off gambling and drinking and  fighting and swearing, and put on a red coat and testified and fought  the devil only; that Mitchell dropped his mask of cynicism; that Donald  Macdonald ate no longer of the tree of knowledge and ceased to worry  himself with psychological problems, and was happy; and that Tom Hall  was no longer a scoffer. That no one sneaked round through the scrub  after dusk to certain necessary establishments in weather-board cottages  on the outskirts of the town; and that the broad-minded and obliging  ladies thereof became Salvation Army lassies.    But none of these things happened. Drunks quieted down or got out of the  way if they could when the Pretty Girl appeared on the scene, fights and  games of \"headin' 'em\" were adjourned, and weak, ordinary language was  used for the time being, and that was about all.    Nevertheless, most of the chaps were in love with that Pretty Girl  in the Army--all those who didn't _worship_ her privately. Long Bob  Brothers hovered round in hopes, they said, that she'd meet with an  accident--get run over by a horse or something--and he'd have to carry  her in; he scared the women at the barracks by dropping firewood over  the fence after dark. Barcoo-Rot, the meanest man in the back country,  was seen to drop a threepenny bit into the ring, and a rumour was  industriously circulated (by Tom Hall) to the effect that One-eyed Bogan  intended to shave and join the Army disguised as a lassie.    Handsome Jake Boreham (_alias_ Bore-'em), a sentimental shearer from  New Zealand, who had read Bret Harte, made an elaborate attempt for the  Pretty Girl, by pretending to be going to the dogs headlong, with an  idea of first winning her sorrowful interest and sympathy, and then  making an apparently hard struggle to straighten up for her sake. He  related his experience with the cheerful and refreshing absence of  reserve which was characteristic of him, and is of most bushmen.    \"I'd had a few drinks,\" he said, \"and was having a spell under a gum by  the river, when I saw the Pretty Girl and another Army woman coming down  along the bank. It was a blazing hot day. I thought of Sandy and the  Schoolmistress in Bret Harte, and I thought it would be a good idea to  stretch out in the sun and pretend to be helpless; so I threw my hat on  the ground and lay down, with my head in the blazing heat, in the most  graceful position I could get at, and I tried to put a look of pained  regret on my face, as if I was dreaming of my lost boyhood and me  mother. I thought, perhaps, the Girl would pity me, and I felt sure  she'd stoop and pick up my hat and put it gently over my poor troubled  head. Then I was going to become conscious for a moment, and look  hopelessly round, and into her eyes, and then start and look sorrowful  and ashamed, and stagger to my feet, taking off my hat like the Silver  King does to the audience when he makes his first appearance drunk on  the stage; and then I was going to reel off, trying to walk as straight  as I could. And next day I was going to clean up my teeth and nails and  put on a white shirt, and start to be a new man henceforth.    \"Well, as I lay there with my eyes shut, I heard the footsteps come up  and stop, and heard 'em whisper, and I thought I heard the Pretty Girl  say `Poor fellow!' or something that sounded like that; and just then I  got a God-almighty poke in the ribs with an umbrella--at least I suppose  it was aimed for my ribs; but women are bad shots, and the point of  the umbrella caught me in the side, just between the bottom rib and the  hip-bone, and I sat up with a click, like the blade of a pocketknife.    \"The other lassie was the big square-faced woman. The Pretty Girl looked  rather more frightened and disgusted than sentimental, but she had  plenty of pluck, and soon pulled herself together. She said I ought to  be ashamed of myself, a great big man like me, lying there in the dust  like a drunken tramp--an eyesore and a disgrace to all the world. She  told me to go to my camp, wherever that was, and sleep myself sober. The  square-jawed woman said I looked like a fool sitting there.

He describes the people as being delightful, and he has  nothing to say against the climate.\"    \"I will not try to dissuade you,\" she said bravely after a pause. \"At  present I am hopeless, but I shall have something to hope and pray for  while you are away. We will say good-bye now, dear. I have come to meet  you this once, but I will not do so again, another meeting would but  give us fresh pain. I am very glad to know that your brother is going  with you. I shall not have to imagine that you are ill in some  out-of-the-way place without a friend near you; and in spite of the  dangers you may have to run, I would rather think of you as bravely  doing your best than eating your heart out here in London. I shall not  tell my father that we have met here; you had better write to him and  say that you are leaving London at once, and that you hope in two years  to return and claim me in accordance with his promise. I am sure he  will be glad to know that you have gone, and that we shall not be  constantly meeting. He will be kinder to me than he has been of late,  for as he will think it quite impossible that you can make a fortune in  two years he will be inclined to dismiss you altogether from his mind.\"    For another half-hour they talked together, and then they parted with  renewed protestations on her part that nothing should induce her to  break her promise to wait for him for two years. He had given her the  address of one of the merchants to whom Mr. Barnett had promised him a  letter of introduction, so that she might from time to time write, for  the voyage would take at least four months and as much more would be  required for his first letter to come back. He walked moodily home  after parting with her.    \"Hullo, Harry! nothing wrong with you, I hope? why, you look as grave  as an owl.\"    \"I feel grave, Bertie. I have just said good-bye to Hilda; and though I  kept up my spirits and made the best of this expedition of ours, I  cannot but feel how improbable it is that we shall meet again--that is  to say, in our present relations; for if I fail I certainly shall not  return home for some years; it would be only fair to her that I should  not do so. I know that she would keep on as long as there was any hope,  but I should not care to think that she was wasting her life. I was an  ass to believe it could ever be otherwise, and I feel that the best  thing for us both would have been for me to go away as soon as I found  that I was getting fond of her.\"    \"Well, of course I cannot understand it, Harry, and it seems to me that  one girl is very like another; she may be a bit prettier than the  average, but I suppose that comes to all the same thing in another  twenty years. I can understand a man getting awfully fond of his ship,  especially when she is a clipper. However, some day I may feel  different; besides, how could you tell that her father would turn out  such a crusty old beggar?\"    \"I suppose I did not think about it one way or the other, Bertie,\"  Harry said quietly. \"However, the mischief is done, and even if there  was no chance whatever of making money I should go now for my own sake  as well as hers. Well, it is of no use talking more about it; we will  go out now and buy the rifles. I shan't get them new, one can pick up  guns just as good at half the price, and as I know something about  rifles I am not likely to be taken in. Of course I have got my pistols  and only have a brace to buy for you. You will have time on the voyage  to practise with them; if you did not do that you would be as likely to  shoot me as a hostile Indian.\"    \"Oh, that is bosh!\" the boy said; \"still, I certainly should like to be  a good shot.\"    After getting the rifles and pistols, Harry went into the city and  ordered six dozen of wine and three dozen of brandy to be sent on board  out of bond; he also ordered a bag of twenty pounds of raw coffee, a  chest of tea, and a couple of dozen bottles of pickles and sauces, to  be sent down to the docks on the day before the _Para_ sailed. Another  suit of seafaring clothes and a stock of underclothing was ordered for  Bertie. Harry spent the intervening time before the vessel sailed in  looking up his friends and saying good-bye to them, and drove down to  the docks at the appointed time, his brother having joined the ship on  the previous day.    The _Para_ was a barque-rigged ship of some eight hundred tons. At  present she did not show to advantage, her deck being littered with  stores of all kinds that had come on board late. The deck planks where  they could be seen were almost black, the sails had been partly loosed  from the gaskets, and to an eye accustomed to the neatness and order of  a man-of-war her appearance was by no means favourable; but her sides  shone with fresh paint, and, looking at her lines from the wharf, Harry  thought she would be both fast and a good sea-boat. She was not heavily  laden, and stood boldly up in the water. Nodding to Bertie, who was  working hard among the men, he went up on to the poop, from which  Captain Peters was shouting orders.    \"Glad to see you, sir,\" the captain said; \"she looks rather in a litter  at present, doesn't she? We shall get her all ataunto before we get  down to the Nore. These confounded people won't send their stores on  board till the last moment. If I were an owner I should tell all  shippers that no goods would be received within five or six hours of  the ship's time for sailing; that would give us a fair chance, instead  of starting all in a muddle, just at the time, too, when more than any  other one wants to have the decks free for making short tacks down  these narrow reaches. I believe half the wrecks on the sands at the  mouth of the river are due to the confusion in which the ships start.  How can a crew be lively in getting the yards over when they have to go  about decks lumbered up like this, and half of them are only just  recovering from their bout of drink the day before?\"    Up to the last moment everyone on board was hard at work, and when the  order was given to throw off the hawsers the deck was already  comparatively clear. Half an hour later the vessel passed out through  the dock gates, with two boats towing ahead so as to take her well out  into the river; the rest of the crew were employed in letting the sails  drop. As soon as she gathered way the men in the boats were called in,  the boats themselves being towed behind in case they might again be  required.    The passage from the Pool to the mouth of the river was in those days  the most dangerous portion of the voyage. There were no tugs to seize  the ships and carry them down to the open water, while the channels  below the Nore were badly buoyed and lighted, and it was no uncommon  thing for twenty vessels to get upon the sands in the course of a  single tide.    The wind was light, and being northerly helped them well on their way,  and it was only in one or two reaches that the _Para_ was unable to lay  her course. She overtook many craft that had been far ahead of her, and  answered the helm quickly.    \"She is both fast and handy, I see,\" Harry Prendergast, who had been  watching her movements with interest, remarked.    \"Yes; there are not many craft out of London can show her their heels  when the wind is free. She does not look quite so well into the wind as  I should wish; still, I think she is as good as most of them.\"    \"I suppose you will get down to Gravesend before the tide turns?\"    \"Yes, we shall anchor there. The wind is not strong enough for us to  stem the tide, which runs like a sluice there. Once past the Nore one  can do better, but there is no fighting the tide here unless one has a  steady breeze aft. I never feel really comfortable till we are fairly  round the South Foreland; after that it is plain sailing enough. Though  there are a few shoals in the Channel, one can give them a wide berth;  fogs are the things we have to fear there.\"    \"Yes. I have never been down the river, having always joined my ships  either at Portsmouth or Plymouth, so I know very little about it; but I  know from men who have been on board vessels commissioned at Chatham or  Sheerness that they are thankful indeed when they once get round the  Goodwins and head west.\"    \"Well, Mr. Prendergast, I am against these new-fangled steamboats--I  suppose every true sailor is; but when the _Marjory_ began to run  between London and Gravesend eighteen years ago--in '15 I think it  was--folks did say that it would not be long before sailing craft would  be driven off the sea. I did not believe that then, and I don't believe  it now; but I do say that I hope before long there will be a lot of  small steamers on the Thames, to tow vessels down till they are off the  North Foreland. It would be a blessing and a comfort to us master  mariners. Once there we have the choice of going outside the Goodwins,  or taking a short cut inside if the wind is aft. Why, sir, it would add  years to our lives and shorten voyages by weeks. There we are, now,  sometimes lying off the Nore, five hundred sail, waiting for the wind  to shift out of the east, and when we do get under weigh we have always  to keep the lead going. One never knows when one may bump upon the  sands. Some masters will grope their way along in the dark, but for my  part I always anchor. There are few enough buoys and beacons in  daytime, but I consider that it is tempting Providence to try and go  down in a dark night. The owners are sensible men and they know that it  is not worth while running risks just to save a day or two when you  have got a four months' voyage before you. Once past Dover I am ready  to hold on with anyone, but between the Nore and the North Foreland I  pick my way as carefully as a woman going across a muddy street.\"    \"You are quite right, Captain; I thoroughly agree with you. More ships  get ashore going down to the"]]]
