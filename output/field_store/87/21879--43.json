Thus gold, silver, and others of the most solid  metals are the best conductors. Next to the pure metals in conducting  powers are rocks, flints, porcelain, earthenware, and the denser liquids  as the solutions of the acids and alkalies. As a further evidence to  prove that the passage of heat through all substances is increased  by cohesion, even some of those which are known to be among the best  conductors are deprived of this property by a division or disintegration  of their particles. Pure silica in the state of hard, rock crystal is  a better conductor than bismuth or lead; but if the rock crystal be  pulverized, the diffusion of heat through its powder is very slow and  feeble. Heat is conducted swiftly and copiously through transparent  rock salt, but pulverization converts the solid mass into a good  non-conductor. Caloric has for the same reason a stronger affinity for  pure metals than for their oxides.    Again, wood is known to be a better non-conductor when reduced to  shavings or sawdust than when in the solid state. It is probably on this  account that trees are protected by bark, which is not nearly so dense  and hard a body as the wood. Wool, silk, and cotton are much diminished  in conducting qualities when spun and woven, for the reason that their  fibers are brought closer together.    Count Rumford discovered that hot water, at a given temperature, when  placed in a vessel jacketed with a clothing of twisted silk, and plunged  into a freezing mixture, cooled down to 185 deg. Fah. in 917 seconds. But  when the same vessel was clothed with an equal thickness of raw silk,  water at the same heat and under the same process required 1,264 seconds  before it reached the same decrease of temperature. It was also found  by Sir Humphry Davy that even metals became non-conductors when their  cohesion was destroyed by reducing them to the gaseous state.    It is now generally admitted that, heat being motion, anything, which,  by the cohesion of particles, preserves the continuity of the molecular  chain along which the motion is conveyed, must augment calorific  transmission. On the other hand, when there is a division or  disintegration of atoms, such as exists in sawdust, powdered charcoal,  furs, and felt, the particles composing such bodies are separated from  each other by spaces of air, which the instructed among us well know are  good non-conductors of heat. The motion has, therefore, to pass from  each particle of matter to the air, and again from the air to the  particle adjacent to it. Hence, it will be readily seen, that in  substances composed of separate or divided particles, the thermal  bridge, so to speak, is broken, and the passage of heat is obstructed  by innumerable barriers of confined air. The correctness of  these assumptions has been so abundantly proved by experimental  demonstrations, that every mind that is tolerably informed on the  subject must be relieved of every shade of doubt respecting the greatly  superior non-conducting powers which bodies consisting of separate atoms  possess over those of a solid concrete nature.    The next matter of interest connected with the subject under notice is  its relation to the philosophy of radiation. It has long been known that  the emission of heat from a polished metallic surface is very slight,  but from a surface of porcelain, paper, or charcoal, heat is discharged  profusely. Even many of the best non-conductors are powerful radiators,  and throw off heat with a repellent energy difficult to conceive.    \"If two equal balls of thin, bright silver,\" says Sir John Leslie, \"one  of them entirely uncovered and the other sheathed in a case of cambric,  be filled with water slightly warmed and then suspended in a close room,  the former will lose only eleven parts in the same time that the latter  will dissipate twenty parts.\" The superior heat-retaining capacity which  a clean tin kettle possesses over one that has been allowed to  collect smoke and soot, lies within the compass of the most ordinary  observation.    The experiments of the eminent philosopher just mentioned furnish a  variety of suggestions on the radiation from heated surfaces. He found  that, while the radiating power of clean lead was only 19, it rose to 45  when tarnished by oxidation, that the radiating power of plumbago  was 75, and that of red lead 80. He also discovered that, while the  radiating power of gold, silver, and polished tin was only 12, that  of paper was 98, and lamp black no less than 100. He further says: \"A  silver pot will emit scarcely half as much heat as one of porcelain. The  addition of a flannel, though indeed a slow conductor, far from checking  the dissipation of heat, has directly a contrary tendency, for it  presents to the atmosphere a surface of much greater propulsive  energy, which would require a thickness of no less than three folds to  counterbalance.\"    It is safe to infer from this analogy that the felt covering of boilers  should not only be of considerable thickness, but should be protected  by an external jacketing of some sort; for, though felt is a good  non-conductor, it is a powerful absorber and radiator, more especially  when it has been allowed to contract soot and dust.    Various experiments have lead to the general conclusion that the  power of absorption is always in the same proportion as the power of  radiation. It must be so. Were any substance a powerful radiator and at  the same time a bad absorber, it would necessarily radiate faster than  it would absorb, and its reduction of temperature would continue without  limit. It has, furthermore, been proved that the absorptive property of  substances increases as their reflecting qualities diminish. Hence, the  radiating power of a surface is inversely as its reflecting power. It is  for this reason that the polished metallic sheathing on the cylinders  of locomotive engines, and on the boilers of steam fire engines, is  not only ornamental but essentially useful. Decisive tests have also  established the fact that radiation is effected more or less by color.  \"A black porcelain tea pot,\" observes Dr. Lardner, \"is the worst  conceivable material for that vessel, for both its material and color  are good radiators of heat, and the liquid contained in it cools with  the greatest possible rapidity; a polished silver or brass tea urn is  much better adapted to retain the heat of the water than one of a dull  brown, such as is most commonly used.\"    A few facts like those above stated afford more decisive information  regarding the nature of heat than columns of theory or speculation. Yet  it is rather strange that when so many learned and reliable men have,  experimented so much and commented with such persuasiveness upon the  subtile agency of heat and the vast amount of waste that must accrue by  injudicious management, comparatively few have availed themselves of the  united labors of these indefatigable pyrologists; manufacturing owners  and corporations still persisting in having their steam boilers painted  black or dull red and leaving them exposed to the atmosphere. Some  persons, who pass themselves off very satisfactorily as clever  engineers, affect a contempt for the higher branches of science, and  assert, in a very positive and self-sufficient manner that experiments  made in a study or laboratory are on too trifling and small a scale to  be practically relied upon; that a tin kettle or a saucepan is a very  different thing to the boiler of a steam engine.    This may be so in one sense, but the same chemical forces which operate  upon the one will be just as active in a proportionate degree in their  action upon the other. It was said by Aristotle that the laws of the  universe are best observed in the most insignificant objects; for the  same physical causes which hold together the stupendous frame of the  universe may be recognized even in a drop of rain. The same observation  may be applied to the laws of heat in all their ramifications; for,  after all, our experiments are, in many instances but defective copies  of what is continually going on in the great workshop of nature.    It would be needless to insist on the wasteful and destructive effects  produced by the exposure of boiler surfaces to the open atmosphere.  Such a practice can be neither supported by experience nor justified by  analogy; and it is to be hoped that it may before long be consigned to  the limbo of antiquated absurdities and be satisfactorily forgotten.  Seeing that it cannot with any show of reason be affirmed that the  boiler covering materials in present use possess the requirements  necessary to recommend them; the question arises as to what is the best  means of achieving the object required. This is an inquiry which it is  the office of time alone to answer. As the problem is obviously one of  primary importance, and well worthy of the attention of inventors, it  is hazarding nothing to predict its satisfactory solution at no distant  date.    The plain truth is, boilers have of late become gigantic foes to  human life. Explosions have increased, are increasing, and should be  diminished; and they are, in many instances, caused by boilers being  strained and weakened by sudden contraction from having their surfaces  exposed when the fire has been withdrawn from them. Boilers are also  materially injured by the excessive furnace heat which it is necessary  to maintain to compensate for the large amount of caloric which  is dissipated from their surfaces, not only by radiation but from  absorption by the surrounding atmosphere.    As the views here laid down are drawn exclusively from the region of  fact and experiment, it is to be hoped that an enlightened sense of  self-interest may prompt those whom the subject may concern, to give it  that special attention which its importance demands.           *       *       *      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8997"],[0,"Ritchie's Fabulae Faciles: A First Latin Reader (#6)"],[1,"in medió flúmine mergerétur.

Postulávit tamen ut Herculés ipse, cum imperáta Eurystheí fécisset,  Cerberum in Orcum rúrsus redúceret. Herculés hóc pollicitus est, et  Cerberum, quem nón sine mágnó perículó manibus prehenderat, summó cum  labóre ex Orcó in lúcem et ad urbem Eurystheí tráxit. Eó cum vénisset,  tantus timor animum Eurystheí occupávit ut ex átrió statim refúgerit; cum  autem paulum sé ex timóre recépisset, multís cum lacrimís obsecrávit  Herculem ut mónstrum sine morá in Orcum redúceret.

Tandem iam aetáte próvectus Déianíram, Oeneí fíliam, in  mátrimónium dúxit; post tamen trís annós accidit ut puerum quendam, cui  nómen erat Eunomus, cású occíderit. Cum autem mós esset ut sí quis  hominem cású occídisset, in exsilium íret, Herculés cum uxóre suá é  fínibus éius cívitátis exíre mátúrávit. Dum tamen iter faciunt, ad flúmen  quoddam pervénérunt in quó núllus póns erat; et dum quaerunt quónam modó  flúmen tránseant, accurrit centaurus Nessus, quí viátóribus auxilium  obtulit. Herculés igitur uxórem suam in tergum Nessí imposuit; tum ipse  flúmen tránávit. Nessus autem paulum in aquam prógressus ad rípam subitó  revertébátur et Déianíram auferre cónábátur. Quod cum animadvertisset  Herculés, írá graviter commótus arcum intendit et pectus Nessí sagittá  tránsfíxit.    55. _THE POISONED ROBE_    Nessus igitur sagittá Herculis tránsfíxus moriéns humí iacébat; at né  occásiónem suí ulcíscendí dímitteret, ita locútus est: \"Tú, Déianíra,  verba morientis audí.

Pelias had expelled his brother Aeson from his kingdom in Thessaly, and  had determined to take the life of Jason, the son of Aeson. Jason,  however, escaped and grew up to manhood in another country. At last he  returned to Thessaly; and Pelias, fearing that he might attempt to  recover the kingdom, sent him to fetch the Golden Fleece from Colchis,  supposing this to be an impossible feat. Jason with a band of heroes set  sail in the ship Argo (called after Argus, its builder), and after many  adventures reached Colchis. Here Aeétes, king of Colchis, who was  unwilling to give up the Fleece, set Jason to perform what seemed an  impossible task, namely to plough a field with certain fire-breathing  oxen, and then to sow it with dragon's teeth. Medéa, however, the  daughter of the king, assisted Jason by her skill in magic, first to  perform the task appointed, and then to procure the Fleece. She then fled  with Jason, and to delay the pursuit of her father, sacrificed her  brother Absyrtus. After reaching Thessaly, Medéa caused the death of  Pelias and was expelled from the country with her husband. They removed  to Corinth, and here Medéa becoming jealous of Glauce, daughter of Creon,  caused her death by means of a poisoned robe. She was afterward carried  off in a chariot sent by the sun-god, and a little later Jason was  accidentally killed_.      57. _THE WICKED UNCLE_    Erant ólim in Thessaliá duo frátrés, quórum alter Aesón, Peliás alter  appellábátur. Aesón prímó régnum obtinuerat; at post paucós annós Peliás  régní cupiditáte adductus nón modo frátrem suum expulit, sed etiam in  animó habébat Iásonem, Aesonis fílium, interficere. Quídam tamen ex  amícís Aesonis, ubi sententiam Peliae cógnóvérunt, puerum é tantó  perículó éripere cónstituérunt. Noctú igitur Iásonem ex urbe abstulérunt,  et cum posteró dié ad régem rediissent, eí renúntiávérunt puerum mortuum  esse. Peliás cum hóc audívisset, etsí ré vérá mágnum gaudium percipiébat,  speciem tamen dolóris praebuit et quae causa esset mortis quaesívit. Illí  autem cum bene intellegerent dolórem éius falsum esse, nesció quam  fábulam dé morte puerí finxérunt.    58. _A FATEFUL ACCIDENT_    Post breve tempus Peliás, veritus né régnum suum tantá ví et fraude  occupátum ámitteret, amícum quendam Delphós mísit, quí óráculum  cónsuleret. Ille igitur quam celerrimé Delphós sé contulit et quam ob  causam vénisset démónstrávit. Respondit óráculum núllum esse in  praesentiá perículum; monuit tamen Peliam ut sí quis únum calceum geréns  veníret, eum cavéret. Post paucís annís accidit ut Peliás mágnum  sacrificium factúrus esset; núntiós in omnís partís dímíserat et certam  diem conveniendí díxerat. Dié cónstitútá mágnus hominum numerus undique  ex agrís convénit; in hís autem vénit etiam Iásón, quí á pueritiá apud  centaurum quendam habitáverat. Dum tamen iter facit, únum é calceís in  tránseundó nesció quó flúmine ámísit.    59. _THE GOLDEN FLEECE_    Iásón igitur cum calceum ámissum núlló modó recipere posset, únó pede  núdó in régiam pervénit. Quem cum Peliás vídisset, subitó timóre adfectus  est; intelléxit enim hunc esse hominem quem óráculum démónstrávisset. Hóc  igitur cónsilium iniit. Réx erat quídam Aeétés, quí régnum Colchidis illó  tempore obtinébat. Huic commissum erat vellus illud aureum quod Phrixus  ólim ibi relíquerat. Cónstituit igitur Peliás Iásoní negótium dare ut hóc  vellere potírétur; cum enim rés esset mágní perículí, eum in itinere  peritúrum esse spérábat. Iásonem igitur ad sé arcessívit, et eum  cohortátus quid fierí vellet docuit. Ille etsí intellegébat rem esse  difficillimam, negótium libenter suscépit.    60. _THE BUILDING OF THE GOOD SHIP ARGO_    Cum tamen Colchis multórum diérum iter ab eó locó abesset, sólus Iásón  proficíscí nóluit. Dímísit igitur núntiós in omnís partís, quí causam  itineris docérent et diem certam conveniendí dícerent. Intereá, postquam  omnia quae sunt úsuí ad armandás návís comportárí iussit, negótium dedit  Argó cuidam, quí summam scientiam nauticárum rérum habébat, ut návem  aedificáret. In hís rébus circiter decem diés cónsúmptí sunt; Argus enim,  quí operí praeerat, tantam díligentiam adhibébat ut né nocturnum quidem  tempus ad labórem intermitteret. Ad multitúdinem hominum tránsportandam  návis pauló erat látior quam quibus in nostró marí útí cónsuévimus, et ad  vim tempestátum perferendam tóta é róbore facta est.    61. _THE ANCHOR IS WEIGHED_    Intereá is diés appetébat quem Iásón per núntiós édíxerat, et ex omnibus  regiónibus Graeciae multí, quós aut reí novitás aut spés glóriae movébat,  undique conveniébant. Tráditum est autem in hóc numeró fuisse Herculem,  dé quó suprá multa perscrípsimus, Orpheum, citharoedum praeclárissimum,  Théseum, Castorem, multósque aliós quorum nómina sunt nótissima. Ex hís  Iásón quós arbitrátus est ad omnia perícula subeunda parátissimós esse,  eós ad numerum quínquágintá délégit et sociós sibi adiúnxit; tum paucós  diés commorátus, ut ad omnís cásús subsidia comparáret, návem dédúxit, et  tempestátem ad návigandum idóneam nactus mágnó cum plausú omnium solvit.    62. _A FATAL MISTAKE_    Haud multó post Argonautae (ita enim appellábantur quí in istá náví  vehébantur) ínsulam quandam, nómine Cyzicum, attigérunt; et é náví  égressí á rége illíus regiónis hospitió exceptí sunt. Paucás hórás ibi  commorátí ad sólis occásum rúrsus solvérunt; sed postquam pauca mília  passuum prógressí sunt, tanta tempestás subitó coorta est ut cursum  tenére nón possent, et in eandem partem ínsulae unde núper profectí erant  mágnó cum perículó déicerentur. Incolae tamen, cum nox esset obscúra,  Argonautás nón ágnóscébant, et návem inimícam vénisse arbitrátí arma  rapuérunt et eós égredí prohibébant. Ácriter in lítore púgnátum est, et  réx ipse, quí cum aliís décucurrerat, ab Argonautís occísus est. Mox  tamen, cum iam dílúcésceret, sénsérunt incolae sé erráre et arma  abiécérunt; Argonautae autem cum régem occísum esse vidérent, mágnum  dolórem percépérunt.    63. _THE LOSS OF HYLAS_"]]]
