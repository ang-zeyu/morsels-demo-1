The expedient of new revelations completing, altering, or abrogating former  ones had played an important part in the legislative work of Mohammed. Now,  he had never considered that by his death the spring would be stopped,  although completion was wanted in every respect. For, without doubt,  Mohammed felt his weakness in systematizing and his absence of clearness  of vision into the future, and therefore he postponed the promulgation of  divine decrees as long as possible, and he solved only such questions  of law as frequently recurred, when further hesitation would have been  dangerous to his authority and to the peace of the community.    At Mohammed's death, all Arabs were not yet subdued to his authority.  The expeditions which he had undertaken or arranged beyond the northern  boundaries of Arabia, were directed against Arabs, although they were  likely to rouse conflict with the Byzantine and Persian empires. It would  have been contrary to Mohammed's usual methods if this had led him to form  a general definition of his attitude towards the world outside Arabia.    As little as Mohammed, when he invoked the Meccans in wild poetic  inspirations to array themselves behind him to seek the blessedness of  future life, had dreamt of the possibility that twenty years later the  whole of Arabia would acknowledge his authority in this world, as little,  nay, much less, could he at the close of his life have had the faintest  premonition of the fabulous development which his state would reach half  a century later. The subjugation of the mighty Persia and of some of the  richest provinces of the Byzantine Empire, only to mention these, was never  a part of his program, although legend has it that he sent out written  challenges to the six princes of the world best known to him. Yet we  may say that Mohammed's successors in the guidance of his community, by  continuing their expansion towards the north, after the suppression of the  apostasy that followed his death, remained in Mohammed's line of action.  There is even more evident continuity in the development of the empire of  the Omayyads out of the state of Mohammed, than in the series of events  by which we see the dreaded Prince-Prophet of Medina grew out of the  \"possessed one\" of Mecca. But if Mohammed had been able to foresee how the  unity of Arabia, which he nearly accomplished, was to bring into being a  formidable international empire, we should expect some indubitable traces  of this in the Qoran; not a few verses of dubious interpretation, but  some certain sign that the Revelation, which had repeatedly, and with the  greatest emphasis, called itself a \"plain Arabic Qoran\" intended for those  \"to whom no warner had yet been sent,\" should in future be valid for the  'Ajam, the Barbarians, as well as for the Arabs.    Even if we ascribe to Mohammed something of the universal program, which  the later tradition makes him to have drawn up, he certainly could not  foresee the success of it. For this, in the first place, the economic and  political factors to which some scholars of our day would attribute the  entire explanation of the Islam movement, must be taken into consideration.  Mohammed did to some extent prepare the universality of his religion and  make it possible. But that Islam, which came into the world as the Arabian  form of the one, true religion, has actually become a universal religion,  is due to circumstances which had little to do with its origin.[1] This  extension of the domain to be subdued to its spiritual rule entailed  upon Islam about three centuries of development and accommodation, of a  different sort, to be sure, but not less drastic in character than that of  the Christian Church.    [Footnote 1: Sir William Muir was not wrong when he said: \"From first to  last the summons was to Arabs and to none other... The seed of a universal  creed had indeed been sown; but that it ever germinated was due to  circumstances rather than design.\"]        II    THE RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF ISLAM      We can hardly imagine a poorer, more miserable population than that of the  South-Arabian country Hadramaut. All moral and social progress is there  impeded by the continuance of the worst elements of Jahiliyyah (Arabian  paganism), side by side with those of Islam. A secular nobility is formed  by groups of people, who grudge each other their very lives and fight each  other according to the rules of retaliation unmitigated by any more humane  feelings. The religious nobility is represented by descendants of the  Prophet, arduous patrons of a most narrow-minded orthodoxy and of most  bigoted fanaticism. In a well-ordered society, making the most of all the  means offered by modern technical science, the dry barren soil might be  made to yield sufficient harvests to satisfy the wants of its members; but  among these inhabitants, paralysed by anarchy, chronic famine prevails.  Foreigners wisely avoid this miserable country, and if they did visit  it, would not be hospitably received. Hunger forces many Hadramites to  emigrate; throughout the centuries we find them in all the countries of  Islam, in the sacred cities of Western-Arabia, in Syria, Egypt, India,  Indonesia, where they often occupy important positions.    In the Dutch Indies, for instance, they live in the most important  commercial towns, and though the Government has never favoured them, and  though they have had to compete with Chinese and with Europeans, they have  succeeded in making their position sufficiently strong. Before European  influence prevailed, they even founded states in some of the larger islands  or they obtained political influence in existing native states. Under a  strong European government they are among the quietest, most industrious  subjects, all earning their own living and saving something for their poor  relations at home. They come penniless, and without any of that theoretical  knowledge or practical skill which we are apt to consider as indispensable  for a man who wishes to try his fortune in a complicated modern colonial  world. Yet I have known some who in twenty years' time have become  commercial potentates, and even millionaires.    The strange spectacle of these latent talents and of the suppressed energy  of the people of Hadramaut that seem to be waiting only for transplantation  into a more favourable soil to develop with amazing rapidity, helps us  to understand the enormous consequences of the Arabian migration in the  seventh century.    The spiritual goods, with which Islam set out into the world, were far from  imposing. It preached a most simple monotheism: Allah, the Almighty Creator  and Ruler of heaven and earth, entirely self-sufficient, so that it were  ridiculous to suppose Him to have partners or sons and daughters to support  Him; who has created the angels that they might form His retinue, and  men and genii (jinn) that they might obediently serve Him; who decides  everything according to His incalculable will and is responsible to nobody,  as the Universe is His; of whom His creatures, if their minds be not led  astray, must therefore stand in respectful fear and awe. He has made His  will known to mankind, beginning at Adam, but the spreading of mankind over  the surface of the earth, its seduction by Satan and his emissaries have  caused most nations to become totally estranged from Him and His service.  Now and then, when He considered that the time was come, He caused a  prophet to arise from among a nation to be His messenger to summon people  to conversion, and to tell them what blessedness awaited them as a reward  of obedience, what punishments would be inflicted if they did not believe  his message.    Sometimes the disobedient had been struck by earthly judgment (the flood,  the drowning of the Egyptians, etc.), and the faithful had been rescued  in a miraculous way and led to victory; but such things merely served  as indications of Allah's greatness. One day the whole world will be  overthrown and destroyed. Then the dead will be awakened and led before  Allah's tribunal. The faithful will have abodes appointed them in  well-watered, shady gardens, with fruit-trees richly laden, with luxurious  couches upon which they may lie and enjoy the delicious food, served by the  ministrants of Paradise. They may also freely indulge in sparkling wine  that does not intoxicate, and in intercourse with women, whose youth and  virginity do not fade. The unbelievers end their lives in Hell-fire; or,  rather, there is no end, for the punishment as well as the reward are  everlasting.    Allah gives to each one his due. The actions of His creatures are all  accurately written down, and when judgment comes, the book is opened;  moreover, every creature carries the list of his own deeds and misdeeds;  the debit and credit sides are carefully weighed against each other in the  divine scales, and many witnesses are heard before judgment is pronounced.  Allah, however, is clement and merciful; He gladly forgives those sinners  who have believed in Him, who have sincerely accepted Islam, that is to  say: who have acknowledged His absolute authority and have believed the  message of the prophet sent to them. These prophets have the privilege  of acting as mediators on behalf of their followers, not in the sense of  redeemers, but as advocates who receive gracious hearing.    Naturally, Islam, submission to the Lord of the Universe, ought to express  itself in deeds. Allah desires the homage of formal worship, which must be  performed several times a day by every individual, and on special occasions  by the assembled faithful, led by one of them. This. service, [s.]alat,  acquired its strictly binding rules only after Mohammed's time, but already  in his lifetime it consisted chiefly of the same elements as now: the  recital of sacred texts, especially taken from the Revelation,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10166"],[0,"What Germany Thinks; Or, The War as Germans see it (#7)"],[1,"speaks!    \"The Kaiser calls the Empire to arms! Our King will lead Bavaria's  armies to him. The nation is ready, armed to the teeth. Challenged by a  dishonest opponent who envies us the fruit of our peaceful toil, the  hands of German men leave their work and grasp the sword. Our enemy  shall learn to his terrible cost, what it means to summon a nation in  arms to the battlefield. The German army goes out to fight for our  country, in a cause which is more stainless and pure than the light of  the sun. The disgraceful Muscovite conspiracy, creeping in the footsteps  of Serbian murderers, believes the moment has arrived in which they will  be able to fall upon, overthrow and plunder us; Russia desires to kindle  a world war.    \"We believe that he will not succeed; but should it thus fall out, we  Germans will defend not only our land and ourselves; but, in this war  which has been forced upon us in the basest manner possible, we shall  defend the civilization of the world, the culture of the earth, against  debased 'unculture' and the spreading roots of decay. This is a lofty  and tremendous task. If we are victorious, as we confidently trust, then  the ever-increasing number of civilized peoples honestly toiling in the  blessings of peace, will thank us for centuries to come.    \"Brothers! Sisters! such an hour has come that the history of the world  has never witnessed before. In the struggle which now begins--a deadly  grapple frivolously conjured up by Russia's monarch--the whole earth  will groan. The German people, however, will prove that it is worthy to  retain and develop its leading place in the intellectual and cultural  progress of the world. Our enemy envies us this position because in his  land, stupidity and confusion reign supreme; his own uncivilization and  barbarism cannot be rooted out.    \"We will prevent him from throwing Europe back to the conditions in  which he and his likes dwell. May God grant that the civilized peoples  of Europe may have true understanding for this historic hour, just as  their heroic ancestors understood the danger when they hurled themselves  against the invasions of the Mongols.    \"First of all the German nation will march against the armies of the  East, and, hand in hand with our ally, we hope will so grip the enemy  that he will lose all desire ever to attack us again.\"[17]    [Footnote 17: _Muenchen-Augsburger Abendzeitung_, August 2nd.]    The last lines of this perfervid article, give an instructive clue. A  mere quibble had arisen between the Central Powers and Russia. The  former immediately adopted an arrogant, even threatening, attitude which  thoughtful Germans condemned. Russia's willingness to submit the  question to an arbitration conference consisting of four neutral  ambassadors seems only to have intensified Teutonic lust to humiliate  the opponent. In any case, it is interesting to note that between July  24th and 31st the whole German nation had been converted to the  uncompromising attitude of the Government.    Further, it is evident that the German people believed they were about  to march against Russia. The very last remark which I heard from German  lips as we entered the train to leave Erlangen on July 31st was: \"Jetzt  werden die Russen abgekloepft.\" (\"Now the Russians will get a  whacking.\")[18]    [Footnote 18: We left Erlangen at 3.30 p.m. Martial law had been  proclaimed some time previous to that. But the proclamation in Berlin  occurred at 3.30 p.m. on the same day. The _Berliner Abendblatt_  published on the same evening states that the Kaiser had been waiting  and hoping for a peaceful answer from Russia. The Bavarian authorities  could not have taken so serious a step without an order from the Highest  War Lord, which leads to the conclusion that it was a device to get  military preparation well under way.]    The Berlin cabinet mobilized Germany's armed strength, as they alleged,  against Russia, and the Government succeeded in arousing and enlisting  national enthusiasm against the Eastern neighbour. Yet when the time  came to strike, Germany's might was hurled against neutral Belgium and  unwilling France, while Russia was left free to overrun the Eastern part  of Germany. The blood-guilt rests in the first place with the Kaiser and  his Government, and in the second place (although in no less a degree)  with the German people, because they condoned the crime and acquiesced  in the duplicity.    While the war fury seethed through the nation the cry echoed on all  sides: \"We want peace! We have worked for a peaceful solution!\" Yet a  study of the workings of the national mind as revealed in the German  Press, and of diplomatic doings as shown in the German White Book,  affords not a single instance--excepting the Socialists'  demonstrations--of any tangible, concrete effort made either by the  German people or its representative diplomacy to avoid a catastrophe. On  the other hand it must be said that the latter (German diplomacy)  deliberately baulked the only practical proposal (Sir Edward Grey's)  which could have brought about a solution. The German nation _did_  desire peace, but only on the condition that their opponents granted  Germany and Austria's arrogant claims down to the smallest tittle.    Exactly at six minutes to one (midday) on August 1st, a telegram left  Berlin instructing the German Ambassador in St. Petersburg to declare  war on Russia at 5 p.m. if the latter State had not given a satisfactory  answer to Germany's ultimatum by that time. Count Pourtales performed  this duty, and therewith the sands of fate ran out.    On the previous day summonses had been issued calling a meeting of the  Reichstag for Tuesday, August 4th. The opening ceremony took place at 1  p.m. and all the political parties were present, except the Social  Democrats, who, according to their traditions, did not appear, and thus  escaped the famous hand-shaking scene. The Kaiser and two of his sons  appeared in field-grey uniform. His theatrical appeal for the leaders of  each party to swear fidelity to the national cause by shaking hands with  him, as well as his saying that \"Now there are only Germans,\" may have  been spontaneous; but it is far more probable that they were meant to be  a diplomatic appeal to the sentimental vanity of the German nation.    It would be superfluous to deal with the speech from the throne in this  place, but at the close of the ceremony an incident occurred which  deserves mention. \"After taking leave of the Reichstag's representatives  the Kaiser stretched out his hand to the famous professor of  jurisprudence in Strasbourg University, Dr. van Calker. The Kaiser  looked steadily at Professor van Calker for a moment, then, after the  handshake, clenched his fist and struck downwards uttering these words:  'Nun aber wollen wir sie dreschen!'[19] ('Now we will jolly well thrash  them!'); nodded to the professor and walked away.\"[20]    [Footnote 19: This utterance has since become a common theme for  composition exercises in German schools.]    [Footnote 20: _Taegliche Rundschau_, August 5th.]    The sitting in the Reichstag was a solemn event. On that occasion the  Chancellor expressed himself at length in defining Germany's position.    \"A tremendous fate has fallen upon Europe. While we have endeavoured to  maintain the prestige of the German Empire in the eyes of the world, we  have lived for forty-four years in peace and protected European peace.  In this work of peace we have become strong and mighty--therefore we are  envied. We have suffered with long-enduring patience; while in the East  and West, under the excuse that Germany is lusting for war, hatred for  us has been nourished and fetters wrought where-with to bind us. The  wind which blows there has now become a storm.    \"We desired nothing but to live on in peaceful toil, content with an  unspoken oath that was echoed from the Emperor down to the youngest  recruit. Our sword shall only leap from its sheath in defence of a just  cause. (Loud applause.) The day on which we must draw it, has dawned  against our will and contrary to our honest endeavours. Russia has set a  burning torch to the house of peace. (Loud cries of 'Quite true.') We  stand to-day in a forced war with Russia and France.    \"Gentlemen, a number of documents, collected in the haste caused by  these overwhelming events, have been laid before you. Permit me to  emphasize the facts which characterize our attitude.    \"From the moment that the Austrian conflict broke out we have striven  and worked to limit the quarrel to Austria-Hungary and Serbia. All the  cabinets, in particular England, accept this view; only Russia has  declared that in the settlement of this conflict, she must be allowed to  express her wishes. Therewith the danger of European complications  raised its threatening countenance.    \"As soon as the first certain news of Russian military preparations  reached us, we caused it to be made known in St. Petersburg, in a  friendly but unmistakable manner, that warlike measures and military  preparations would compel us also to take corresponding steps. But  mobilization is next to war. Russia assured us in a friendly tone (cries  of indignation) that she was making no military preparations against us.    \"Meanwhile England tried to mediate between Vienna and St. Petersburg  and was warmly supported by us. On July 28th the Kaiser telegraphed to  the Czar begging him to remember that it was Austria-Hungary's right and  duty to stop the Greater-Serbian agitation, as this threatened to  undermine Austria's existence. (Cries of indignation.) The Kaiser  pointed out to the Czar the gulf between monarchical interests and the  outrage at Serajewo; he begged him to give his personal support to the  Kaiser's endeavour to smooth out the antithesis between Vienna and St.  Petersburg.    \"Just before this telegram came into the Czar's hands, the Czar, on his"]]]
