[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],[0,"Vanity Fair (#6)"],[1," Amelia, so also had our  beloved but unprotected Rebecca determined to do her very best to  secure the husband, who was even more necessary for her than for her  friend. She had a vivid imagination; she had, besides, read the Arabian  Nights and Guthrie's Geography; and it is a fact that while she was  dressing for dinner, and after she had asked Amelia whether her brother  was very rich, she had built for herself a most magnificent castle in  the air, of which she was mistress, with a husband somewhere in the  background (she had not seen him as yet, and his figure would not  therefore be very distinct); she had arrayed herself in an infinity of  shawls, turbans, and diamond necklaces, and had mounted upon an  elephant to the sound of the march in Bluebeard, in order to pay a  visit of ceremony to the Grand Mogul. Charming Alnaschar visions! it is  the happy privilege of youth to construct you, and many a fanciful  young creature besides Rebecca Sharp has indulged in these delightful  day-dreams ere now!    Joseph Sedley was twelve years older than his sister Amelia.  He was in  the East India Company's Civil Service, and his name appeared, at the  period of which we write, in the Bengal division of the East India  Register, as collector of Boggley Wollah, an honourable and lucrative  post, as everybody knows: in order to know to what higher posts Joseph  rose in the service, the reader is referred to the same periodical.    Boggley Wollah is situated in a fine, lonely, marshy, jungly district,  famous for snipe-shooting, and where not unfrequently you may flush a  tiger.  Ramgunge, where there is a magistrate, is only forty miles off,  and there is a cavalry station about thirty miles farther; so Joseph  wrote home to his parents, when he took possession of his  collectorship.  He had lived for about eight years of his life, quite  alone, at this charming place, scarcely seeing a Christian face except  twice a year, when the detachment arrived to carry off the revenues  which he had collected, to Calcutta.    Luckily, at this time he caught a liver complaint, for the cure of  which he returned to Europe, and which was the source of great comfort  and amusement to him in his native country.  He did not live with his  family while in London, but had lodgings of his own, like a gay young  bachelor.  Before he went to India he was too young to partake of the  delightful pleasures of a man about town, and plunged into them on his  return with considerable assiduity.  He drove his horses in the Park;  he dined at the fashionable taverns (for the Oriental Club was not as  yet invented); he frequented the theatres, as the mode was in those  days, or made his appearance at the opera, laboriously attired in  tights and a cocked hat.    On returning to India, and ever after, he used to talk of the pleasure  of this period of his existence with great enthusiasm, and give you to  understand that he and Brummel were the leading bucks of the day.  But  he was as lonely here as in his jungle at Boggley Wollah.  He scarcely  knew a single soul in the metropolis: and were it not for his doctor,  and the society of his blue-pill, and his liver complaint, he must have  died of loneliness. He was lazy, peevish, and a bon-vivant; the  appearance of a lady frightened him beyond measure; hence it was but  seldom that he joined the paternal circle in Russell Square, where  there was plenty of gaiety, and where the jokes of his good-natured old  father frightened his amour-propre.  His bulk caused Joseph much  anxious thought and alarm; now and then he would make a desperate  attempt to get rid of his superabundant fat; but his indolence and love  of good living speedily got the better of these endeavours at reform,  and he found himself again at his three meals a day.  He never was well  dressed; but he took the hugest pains to adorn his big person, and  passed many hours daily in that occupation. His valet made a fortune  out of his wardrobe: his toilet-table was covered with as many pomatums  and essences as ever were employed by an old beauty: he had tried, in  order to give himself a waist, every girth, stay, and waistband then  invented.  Like most fat men, he would have his clothes made too tight,  and took care they should be of the most brilliant colours and youthful  cut.  When dressed at length, in the afternoon, he would issue forth to  take a drive with nobody in the Park; and then would come back in order  to dress again and go and dine with nobody at the Piazza Coffee-House.  He was as vain as a girl; and perhaps his extreme shyness was one of  the results of his extreme vanity. If Miss Rebecca can get the better  of him, and at her first entrance into life, she is a young person of  no ordinary cleverness.    The first move showed considerable skill.  When she called Sedley a  very handsome man, she knew that Amelia would tell her mother, who  would probably tell Joseph, or who, at any rate, would be pleased by  the compliment paid to her son.  All mothers are.  If you had told  Sycorax that her son Caliban was as handsome as Apollo, she would have  been pleased, witch as she was.  Perhaps, too, Joseph Sedley would  overhear the compliment--Rebecca spoke loud enough--and he did hear,  and (thinking in his heart that he was a very fine man) the praise  thrilled through every fibre of his big body, and made it tingle with  pleasure.  Then, however, came a recoil.  \"Is the girl making fun of  me?\" he thought, and straightway he bounced towards the bell, and was  for retreating, as we have seen, when his father's jokes and his  mother's entreaties caused him to pause and stay where he was.  He  conducted the young lady down to dinner in a dubious and agitated frame  of mind. \"Does she really think I am handsome?\" thought he, \"or is she  only making game of me?\" We have talked of Joseph Sedley being as vain  as a girl.  Heaven help us! the girls have only to turn the tables, and  say of one of their own sex, \"She is as vain as a man,\" and they will  have perfect reason.  The bearded creatures are quite as eager for  praise, quite as finikin over their toilettes, quite as proud of their  personal advantages, quite as conscious of their powers of fascination,  as any coquette in the world.    Downstairs, then, they went, Joseph very red and blushing, Rebecca very  modest, and holding her green eyes downwards.  She was dressed in  white, with bare shoulders as white as snow--the picture of youth,  unprotected innocence, and humble virgin simplicity. \"I must be very  quiet,\" thought Rebecca, \"and very much interested about India.\"    Now we have heard how Mrs. Sedley had prepared a fine curry for her  son, just as he liked it, and in the course of dinner a portion of this  dish was offered to Rebecca.  \"What is it?\" said she, turning an  appealing look to Mr. Joseph.    \"Capital,\" said he.  His mouth was full of it: his face quite red with  the delightful exercise of gobbling. \"Mother, it's as good as my own  curries in India.\"    \"Oh, I must try some, if it is an Indian dish,\" said Miss Rebecca. \"I  am sure everything must be good that comes from there.\"    \"Give Miss Sharp some curry, my dear,\" said Mr. Sedley, laughing.    Rebecca had never tasted the dish before.    \"Do you find it as good as everything else from India?\" said Mr. Sedley.    \"Oh, excellent!\" said Rebecca, who was suffering tortures with the  cayenne pepper.    \"Try a chili with it, Miss Sharp,\" said Joseph, really interested.    \"A chili,\" said Rebecca, gasping.  \"Oh yes!\"  She thought a chili was  something cool, as its name imported, and was served with some. \"How  fresh and green they look,\" she said, and put one into her mouth.  It  was hotter than the curry; flesh and blood could bear it no longer.  She laid down her fork.  \"Water, for Heaven's sake, water!\" she cried.  Mr. Sedley burst out laughing (he was a coarse man, from the Stock  Exchange, where they love all sorts of practical jokes).  \"They are  real Indian, I assure you,\" said he.  \"Sambo, give Miss Sharp some  water.\"    The paternal laugh was echoed by Joseph, who thought the joke capital.  The ladies only smiled a little.  They thought poor Rebecca suffered  too much.  She would have liked to choke old Sedley, but she swallowed  her mortification as well as she had the abominable curry before it,  and as soon as she could speak, said, with a comical, good-humoured  air, \"I ought to have remembered the pepper which the Princess of  Persia puts in the cream-tarts in the Arabian Nights.  Do you put  cayenne into your cream-tarts in India, sir?\"    Old Sedley began to laugh, and thought Rebecca was a good-humoured  girl.  Joseph simply said, \"Cream-tarts, Miss? Our cream is very bad in  Bengal.  We generally use goats' milk; and, 'gad, do you know, I've got  to prefer it!\"    \"You won't like EVERYTHING from India now, Miss Sharp,\" said the old  gentleman; but when the ladies had retired after dinner, the wily old  fellow said to his son, \"Have a care, Joe; that girl is setting her cap  at you.\"    \"Pooh! nonsense!\" said Joe, highly flattered.  \"I recollect, sir, there  was a girl at Dumdum, a daughter of Cutler of the Artillery, and  afterwards married to Lance, the surgeon, who made a dead set at me in  the year '4--at me and Mulligatawney, whom I mentioned to you before  dinner--a devilish good fellow Mulligatawney--he's a magistrate at  Budgebudge, and sure to be in council in five years. Well, sir, the  Artillery gave a ball, and Quintin, of the King's 14th, said to me,  'Sedley,' said he, 'I bet you thirteen to ten that Sophy Cutler hooks  either you or Mulligatawney before the rains.' 'Done,' says I; and  egad, sir--this claret's very good.  Adamson's or Carbonell's?\"    A slight snore was the only reply: the honest stockbroker was asleep,  and so the rest of Joseph's story was lost for that day. But he was  always exceedingly communicative in a man's party, and has told this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#6)"],[1,"in the  centre of a young flax-bush, whose satiny leaves made the most elastic  cushions around me; with my flax-stick held out over what was supposed  to be a favourite haunt of the eels, and with Nettle asleep at my feet  and a warm shawl close to my hand, prepared for my vigil. \"Don't speak  or move,\" were the gentlemen's last words: \"the eels are all eyes and  ears at this hour; they can almost hear you breathe.\" Each man then took  up his position a few hundred yards away from me, so that I felt, to all  intents and purposes, absolutely alone. I am \"free to confess,\" as our  American cousins say, that it was a very eerie sensation. It was now  past ten o'clock; the darkness was intense, and the silence as deep as  the darkness.    Hot as the day had been, the night air felt chill, and a heavy dew  began to fall, showing me the wisdom of substituting woollen for cotton  garments. I could see the dim outlines of the high hills, which shut in  our happy valley on all sides, and the smell of the freshly-turned earth  of a paddock near the house, which was in process of being broken up  for English grass, came stealing towards me on the silent air. The  melancholy cry of a bittern, or the shrill wail of the weka, startled  me from time to time, but there was no other sound to break the eternal  silence.    As I waited and watched, I thought, as every one must surely think,  with strange paradoxical feelings, of one's own utter insignificance in  creation, mingled with the delightful consciousness of our individual  importance in the eyes of the Maker and Father of all. An atom among  worlds, as one feels, sitting there at such an hour and in such a spot,  still we remember with love and pride, that not a hair of our head falls  to the ground unnoticed by an Infinite Love and an Eternal Providence.  The soul tries to fly into the boundless regions of space and eternity,  and to gaze upon other worlds, and other beings equally the object of  the Great Creator's care; but her mortal wing soon droops and tires,  and she is fain to nestle home again to her Saviour's arms, with the  thought, \"I am my Beloved's, and He is mine.\" That is the only safe  beginning and end of all speculation. It was very solemn and beautiful,  that long dark night,--a pause amid the bustle of every day cares and  duties,--hours in which one takes counsel with one's own heart, and is  still.    Midnight had come and gone, when the sputter and snap of striking  a match, which sounded almost like a pistol shot amid the profound  silence, told me that one of the sportsmen had been successful. I got  up as softly as possible, wrapped my damp shawl round my still damper  shoulders, and, fastening the flax-stick securely in the ground, stole  along the bank of the creek towards the place where a blazing tussock,  serving as a torch, showed the successful eel-fisher struggling with  his prize. Through the gloom I saw another weird-looking figure running  silently in the same direction; for the fact was, we were all so cramped  and cold, and, weary of sitting waiting for bites which never came, that  we hailed with delight a break in the monotony of our watch. It did  not matter now how much noise we made (within moderate limits), for  the peace of that portion of the creek was destroyed for the night.  Half-a-dozen eels must have banded themselves together, and made a  sudden and furious dash at the worsted ball, which Mr. U---- had been  dangling in front of their mud hall-door for the last two hours. Just as  he had intended, their long sharp teeth became entangled in the worsted  loops, and although he declared some had broken away and escaped, three  or four good-sized ones remained, struggling frantically.    It would have been almost impossible for one man to lift such a weight  straight out of the water by a string; and as we came up and saw Mr.  U----'s agitated face in the fantastic flickering light of the  blazing tussock, which he had set on fire as a signal of distress, I  involuntarily thought of the old Joe Miller about the Tartar: \"Why don't  you let him go?\" \"Because he has caught _me._\" It looked just like that.  The furious splashing in the water below, and Mr. U---- grasping his  line with desperate valour, but being gradually drawn nearer to the  edge of the steep bank each instant. \"Keep up a good light, but not too  much,\" cried F---- to me, in a regular stage-whisper, as he rushed to  the rescue. So I pulled up one tussock after another by its roots,--an  exertion which resulted in upsetting me each time,--and lighted one as  fast as its predecessor burned out. They were all rather damp, so they  did not flare away too quickly. By the blaze of my grassy torches I saw  F----first seize Mr. U---- round the waist and drag him further from  the bank; but the latter called out, \"It's my hands,--they have no skin  left: do catch hold, there's a good fellow.\" So the \"good fellow\" did  catch hold, but he was too experienced an eel-fisher to try to lift  a couple of dozen pounds weight of eels out of the water by a  perpendicular string; so he tied it to a flax-bush near, and, stooping  down in order to get some leverage over the bank, very soon drew the  ball, with its slimy, wriggling captives, out of the water. Just as  he jerked it far on shore, one or two of the creatures broke loose and  escaped, leaving quite enough to afford a most disgusting and horrible  sight as they were shuffled and poked into the empty flour-sack.    The sportsmen were delighted however, and departed to a fresh bend of  the creek, leaving me to find my way back to my original post. This  would have been difficult indeed, had not Nettle remained behind to  guard my gloves, which I had left in his custody. As I passed, not  knowing I was so near the spot, the little dog gave a low whimper of  greeting, sufficient to attract my attention and guide me to where he  was keeping his faithful watch and ward. I felt for my flax-stick and  moved it ever so gently. A sudden jerk and splash startled me horribly,  and warned me that I had disturbed an eel who was in the act of supping  off my bait. In the momentary surprise I suppose I let go, for certain  it is that the next instant my flax-stick was rapidly towed down the  stream.    Instead of feeling provoked or mortified, it was the greatest relief  to know that my eel-fishing was over for the night, and that now I had  nothing to do except \"wait till called for.\" So I took Nettle on my  lap and tried to abide patiently, but I had not been long enough in New  Zealand to have any confidence in the climate, and as I felt how damp my  clothes were, and recollected with horror my West Indian experiences of  the consequences of exposure to night air and heavy dew, my mind _would_  dwell gloomily on the prospect of a fever, at least. It seemed a long  and weary while before I perceived a figure coming towards me; and I am  afraid I was both cross and cold and sleepy by the time we set our faces  homewards. \"I have only caught three,\" said F----. \"How many have you  got?\" \"None, I am happy to say,\" I answered peevishly, \"What could  Nettle and I have done with the horrible things if we had caught any?\"    The walk, or rather the stumble home, proved to be the worst part of the  expedition. Not a ray of starlight had we to guide us,--nothing but  inky blackness around and over us. We tried to make Nettle go first,  intending to follow his lead, and trusting to his keeping the track; but  Nettle's place was at my heels, and neither coaxing nor scolding would  induce him to forego it. A forlorn hope was nothing to the dangers of  each footstep. First one and then the other volunteered to lead the way,  declaring they could find the track. All this time we were trying to  strike the indistinct road among the tussocks, made by occasional wheels  to our house, but the marks, never very distinct in daylight, became  perfect will-o'-the-wisps at night. If we crossed a sheep-track we  joyfully announced that we had found the way, but only to be undeceived  the next moment by discovering that we were returning to the creek.    From time to time we fell into and over Spaniards, and what was left of  our clothes and our flesh the wild Irishmen devoured. We must have  got home somehow, or I should not be writing an account of it, at this  moment, but really I hardly know how we reached the house. I recollect  that the next day there was a great demand for gold-beater's skin, and  court-plaster, and that whenever F---- and Mr. U---- had a spare moment  during the ensuing week, they devoted themselves to performing surgical  operations on each other with a needle; and that I felt very subdued and  tired for a day or two. But there was no question of fever or cold, and  I was stared at when I inquired whether it was not dangerous to be out  all night in heavy dew after a broiling day.    We had the eels made into a pie by our shepherd, who assured me that if  I entrusted them to my cook she would send me up such an oily dish that  I should never be able to endure an eel again. He declared that the  Maoris, who seem to have rather a horror of grease, had taught him how  to cook both eels and wekas in such a way as to eliminate every particle  of fat from both. I had no experience of the latter dish, but he  certainly kept his word about the eels, for they were excellent.        Chapter III: Pig-stalking.      It was much too hot in summer to go after wild pigs. That was our  winter's amusement, and very good sport it afforded us, besides the  pleasure of knowing that we were really doing good service to the  pastoral interest, by ridding the hills around us of almost the only  enemies which the sheep have. If the squatter goes to look after his mob  of ewes and lambs in the sheltered slopes at the back of his run, he is  pretty nearly certain to find them attended by an old sow with a dozen  babies at her heels.
