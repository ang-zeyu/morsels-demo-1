After a considerable amount of adjustment and  readjustment, he appeared to be satisfied, for he remarked to me--    \"I think I have got the lines in the same position as they are on our  print, so, with Inspector Johnson's assistance, we will take a  photograph which we can examine at our leisure.\"    He extracted the camera--a quarter-plate instrument--from its case and  opened it. Then, having swung the microscope on its stand into a  horizontal position, he produced from the camera case a slab of mahogany  with three brass feet, on which he placed the camera, and which brought  the latter to a level with the eye-piece of the microscope.    The front of the camera was fitted with a short sleeve of thin black  leather, and into this the eye-piece end of the microscope was now  passed, the sleeve being secured round the barrel of the microscope by a  stout indiarubber band, thus producing a completely light-tight  connection.    Everything was now ready for taking the photograph. The light from the  window having been concentrated on the thumb-print by means of a  condenser, Thorndyke proceeded to focus the image on the ground-glass  screen with extreme care and then, slipping a small leather cap over the  objective, introduced the dark slide and drew out the shutter.    \"I will ask you to sit down and remain quite still while I make the  exposure,\" he said to me and the inspector. \"A very little vibration is  enough to destroy the sharpness of the image.\"    We seated ourselves accordingly, and Thorndyke then removed the cap,  standing motionless, watch in hand, while he exposed the first plate.    \"We may as well take a second, in case this should not turn out quite  perfect,\" he said, as he replaced the cap and closed the shutter.    He reversed the dark slide and made another exposure in the same way,  and then, having removed the micrometer and replaced it by a slip of  plain glass, he made two more exposures.    \"There are two plates left,\" he remarked, as he drew out the second dark  slide. \"I think I will take a record of the blood-stain on them.\"    He accordingly made two more exposures--one of the larger blood-stain  and one of the smaller smears.    \"There,\" said he, with an air of satisfaction, as he proceeded to pack  up what the inspector described as his \"box of tricks.\" \"I think we have  all the data that we can squeeze out of Scotland Yard, and I am very  much obliged to you, Mr. Singleton, for giving so many facilities to  your natural enemy, the counsel for the defence.\"    \"Not our natural enemies, doctor,\" protested Mr. Singleton. \"We work for  a conviction, of course, but we don't throw obstacles in the way of the  defence. You know that perfectly well.\"    \"Of course I do, my dear sir,\" replied Thorndyke, shaking the official  by the hand. \"Haven't I benefited by your help a score of times? But I  am greatly obliged all the same. Good-bye.\"    \"Good-bye, doctor. I wish you luck, though I fear you will find it 'no  go' this time.\"    \"We shall see,\" replied Thorndyke, and with a friendly wave of the hand  to the inspector he caught up the two cases and led the way out of the  building.          CHAPTER IV    CONFIDENCES      During our walk home my friend was unusually thoughtful and silent, and  his face bore a look of concentration under which I thought I could  detect, in spite of his habitually impassive expression, a certain  suppressed excitement of a not entirely unpleasurable kind. I forbore,  however, from making any remarks or asking questions, not only because I  saw that he was preoccupied, but also because, from my knowledge of the  man, I judged that he would consider it his duty to keep his own counsel  and to make no unnecessary confidences even to me.    On our arrival at his chambers he immediately handed over the camera to  Polton with a few curt directions as to the development of the plates,  and, lunch being already prepared, we sat down at the table without  delay.    We had proceeded with our meal in silence for some time when Thorndyke  suddenly laid down his knife and fork and looked into my face with a  smile of quiet amusement.    \"It has just been borne in upon me, Jervis,\" said he, \"that you are the  most companionable fellow in the world. You have the heaven-sent gift of  silence.\"    \"If silence is the test of companionability,\" I answered, with a grin,  \"I think I can pay you a similar compliment in even more emphatic  terms.\"    He laughed cheerfully and rejoined--    \"You are pleased to be sarcastic, I observe; but I maintain my position.  The capacity to preserve an opportune silence is the rarest and most  precious of social accomplishments. Now, most men would have plied me  with questions and babbled comments on my proceedings at Scotland Yard,  whereas you have allowed me to sort out, without interruption, a mass of  evidence while it is still fresh and impressive, to docket each item and  stow it away in the pigeonholes of my brain. By the way, I have made a  ridiculous oversight.\"    \"What is that?\" I asked.    \"The 'Thumbograph.' I never ascertained whether the police have it or  whether it is still in the possession of Mrs. Hornby.\"    \"Does it matter?\" I inquired.    \"Not much; only I must see it. And perhaps it will furnish an excellent  pretext for you to call on Miss Gibson. As I am busy at the hospital  this afternoon and Polton has his hands full, it would be a good plan  for you to drop in at Endsley Gardens--that is the address, I think--and  if you can see Miss Gibson, try to get a confidential chat with her, and  extend your knowledge of the manners and customs of the three Messieurs  Hornby. Put on your best bedside manner and keep your weather eye  lifting. Find out everything you can as to the characters and habits of  those three gentlemen, regardless of all scruples of delicacy.  Everything is of importance to us, even to the names of their tailors.\"    \"And with regard to the 'Thumbograph'?\"    \"Find out who has it, and, if it is still in Mrs. Hornby's possession,  get her to lend it to us or--what might, perhaps, be better--get her  permission to take a photograph of it.\"    \"It shall be done according to your word,\" said I. \"I will furbish up my  exterior, and this very afternoon make my first appearance in the  character of Paul Pry.\"    About an hour later I found myself upon the doorstep of Mr. Hornby's  house in Endsley Gardens listening to the jangling of the bell that I  had just set in motion.    \"Miss Gibson, sir?\" repeated the parlourmaid in response to my question.  \"She _was_ going out, but I am not sure whether she has gone yet. If you  will step in, I will go and see.\"    I followed her into the drawing-room, and, threading my way amongst the  litter of small tables and miscellaneous furniture by which ladies  nowadays convert their special domain into the semblance of a broker's  shop, let go my anchor in the vicinity of the fireplace to await the  parlourmaid's report.    I had not long to wait, for in less than a minute Miss Gibson herself  entered the room. She wore her hat and gloves, and I congratulated  myself on my timely arrival.    \"I didn't expect to see you again so soon, Dr. Jervis,\" she said,  holding out her hand with a frank and friendly manner, \"but you are very  welcome all the same. You have come to tell me something?\"    \"On the contrary,\" I replied, \"I have come to ask you something.\"    \"Well, that is better than nothing,\" she said, with a shade of  disappointment. \"Won't you sit down?\"    I seated myself with caution on a dwarf chair of scrofulous aspect, and  opened my business without preamble.    \"Do you remember a thing called a 'Thumbograph'?\"    \"Indeed I do,\" she replied with energy. \"It was the cause of all this  trouble.\"    \"Do you know if the police took possession of it?\"    \"The detective took it to Scotland Yard that the finger-print experts  might examine it and compare the two thumb-prints; and they wanted to  keep it, but Mrs. Hornby was so distressed at the idea of its being  used in evidence that they let her have it back. You see, they really  had no further need of it, as they could take a print for themselves  when they had Reuben in custody; in fact, he volunteered to have a print  taken at once, as soon as he was arrested, and that was done.\"    \"So the 'Thumbograph' is now in Mrs. Hornby's possession?\"    \"Yes, unless she has destroyed it. She spoke of doing so.\"    \"I hope she has not,\" said I, in some alarm, \"for Dr. Thorndyke is  extremely anxious, for some reason, to examine it.\"    \"Well, she will be down in a few minutes, and then we shall know. I told  her you were here. Have you any idea what Dr. Thorndyke's reason is for  wanting to see it?\"    \"None whatever,\" I replied. \"Dr. Thorndyke is as close as an oyster. He  treats me as he treats every one else--he listens attentively, observes  closely, and says nothing.\"    \"It doesn't sound very agreeable,\" mused Miss Gibson; \"and yet he seemed  very nice and sympathetic.\"    \"He _is_ very nice and sympathetic,\" I retorted with some emphasis, \"but  he doesn't make himself agreeable by divulging his clients' secrets.\"    \"I suppose not; and I regard myself as very effectively snubbed,\" said  she, smiling, but evidently somewhat piqued by my not very tactful  observation.    I was hastening to repair my error with apologies and self-accusations,  when the door opened and an elderly lady entered the room. She was  somewhat stout, amiable and placid of mien, and impressed me (to be  entirely truthful) as looking rather foolish.    \"Here is Mrs. Hornby,\" said Miss Gibson, presenting me to her hostess;  and she continued, \"Dr. Jervis has come to ask about the 'Thumbograph.'  You haven't destroyed it, I hope?\"    \"No, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Hornby. \"I have it in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11153"],[0,"No Hero (#7)"],[1,"left, though near the end, and we  were actually dancing when an excitable person came out of the  card-room, flushed with liquor and losses, and carried her off in the  most preposterous manner. It was a shock to me at the time to learn that  this outrageous little man was my partner's husband. Months later, when  I came across their case in the papers, it was, I am afraid, without  much sympathy for the injured husband. The man was quite unpresentable,  and I had seen no more of him at Simla, but of the woman just enough to  know her by matchlight on the terrace at the Riffel Alp.    And this was Bob's widow, this dashing _divorcee_! Dashing she was as I  now remembered her, fine in mould, finer in spirit, reckless and  rebellious as she well might be. I had seen her submit before a  ball-room, but with the contempt that leads captivity captive. Seldom  have I admired anything more. It was splendid even to remember, the  ready outward obedience, the not less apparent indifference and disdain.  There was a woman whom any man might admire, who had had it in her to be  all things to some man! But Bob Evers was not a man at all. And  this--and this--was his widow!    Was she one at all? How could I tell? Yes, it was Lascelles, the other  name in the case, to the best of my recollection. But had she any right  to bear it? And even supposing they had married, what had happened to  the second husband? Widow or no widow, second marriage or no second  marriage, defensible or indefensible, was this the right friend for a  lad still fresh from Eton, the only son of his mother, who had sent me  in secret to his side?    There was only one answer to the last question, whatever might be said  or urged in reply to all the rest. I could not but feel that Catherine  Evers had been justified in her instinct to an almost miraculous degree;  that her worst fears were true enough, so far as the lady was concerned;  and that Providence alone could have inspired her to call in an agent  who knew what I knew, and who therefore saw his duty as plainly as I  already saw mine. But it is one thing to recognise a painful duty and  quite another thing to know how to minimise the pain to those most  affected by its performance. The problem was no easy one to my mind, and  I lay awake upon it far into the night.    Tired out with travel, I fell asleep in the end, to awake with a start  in broad daylight. The sun was pouring through the uncurtained  dormer-window of my room under the roof. And in the sunlight, looking  his best in knickerbockers, as only thin men do, with face greased  against wind and glare, and blue spectacles in rest upon an Alpine  wideawake, stood the lad who had taken his share in keeping me awake.    \"I'm awfully sorry,\" he began. \"It's horrid cheek, but when I saw your  room full of light I thought you might have been even earlier than I  was. You must get them to give you curtains up here.\"    He had a note in his hand and I thought by his manner there was  something that he wished and yet hesitated to tell me. I accordingly  asked him what it was.    \"It's what we were speaking about last night!\" burst out Bob. \"That's  why I've come to you. It's these silly fools who can't mind their own  business and think everybody else is like themselves! Here's a note from  Mrs. Lascelles which makes it plain that that old idiot George is not  the only one who has been talking about us, and some of the talk has  reached her ears. She doesn't say so in so many words, but I can see  it's that. She wants to get out of our expedition to Monte Rosa  hut--wants me to go alone. The question is, ought I to let her get out  of it? Does it matter one rap what this rabble says about us? I've come  to ask your advice--you were such a brick about it all last night--and  what you say I'll do.\"    I had begun to smile at Bob's notion of \"a rabble\": this one happened  to include a few quite eminent men, as you have seen, to say nothing of  the average quality of the crowd, of which I had been able to form some  opinion of my own. But I had already noticed in Bob the exclusiveness of  the type to which he belonged, and had welcomed it as one does welcome  the little faults of the well-night faultless. It was his last sentence  that made me feel too great a hypocrite to go on smiling.    \"It may not matter to you,\" I said at length, \"but it may to the lady.\"    \"I suppose it does matter more to them?\"    The sunburnt face, puckered with a wry wistfulness, was only comic in  its incongruous coat of grease. But I was under no temptation to smile.  I had to confine my mind pretty closely to the general principle, and  rather studiously to ignore the particular instance, before I could  bring myself to answer the almost infantile inquiry in those honest  eyes.    \"My dear fellow, it must!\"    Bob looked disappointed but resigned.    \"Well, then, I won't press it, though I'm not sure that I agree. You  see, it's not as though there was or ever would be anything between us.  The idea's absurd. We are absolute pals and nothing else. That's what  makes all this such a silly bore. It's so unnecessary. Now she wants me  to go alone, but I don't see the fun of that.\"    \"Does she ask you to go alone?\"    \"She does. That's the worst of it.\"    I nodded, and he asked me why.    \"She probably thinks it would be the best answer to the tittle-tattlers,  Bob.\"    That was not a deliberate lie; not until the words were out did it occur  to me that Mrs. Lascelles might now have another object in getting rid  of her swain for the day. But Bob's eyes lighted in a way that made me  feel a deliberate liar.    \"By Jove!\" he said, \"I never thought of that. I don't agree with her,  mind, but if that's her game I'll play it like a book. So long, Duncan!  I'm not one of those chaps who ask a man's advice without the slightest  intention of ever taking it!\"    \"But I haven't ventured to advise you,\" I reminded the boy, with a  cowardly eye to the remotest consequences.    \"Perhaps not, but you've shown me what's the proper thing to do.\" And he  went away to do it there and then, like the blameless exception that I  found him to so many human rules.    I had my breakfast upstairs after this, and lay for some considerable  time a prey to feelings which I shall make no further effort to expound;  for this interview had not altered, but only intensified them; and in  any case they must be obvious to those who take the trouble to conceive  themselves in my unenviable position.    And it was my ironic luck to be so circumstanced in a place where I  could have enjoyed life to the hilt! Only to lie with the window open  was to breathe air of a keener purity, a finer temper, a more  exhilarating freshness, than had ever before entered my lungs; and to  get up and look out of the window was to peer into the limpid brilliance  of a gigantic crystal, where the smallest object was in startling  focus, and the very sunbeams cut with scissors. The people below trailed  shadows like running ink. The light was ultra-tropical. One looked for  drill suits and pith headgear, and was amazed to find pajamas  insufficient at the open window.    Upon the terrace on the other side, when I eventually came down, there  were cane chairs and Tauchnitz novels under the umbrella tents, and the  telescope out and trained upon a party on the Matterhorn. A group of  people were waiting turns at the telescope, my friend Quinby and the  hanging judge among them. But I searched under the umbrella tents as  well as one could from the top of the steps before hobbling down to join  the group.    \"I have looked for an accident through that telescope,\" said the jocose  judge, \"fifteen Augusts running. They usually have one the day after I  go.\"    \"Good morning, sir!\" was Quinby's greeting; and I was instantly  introduced to Sir John Sankey, with such a parade of my military history  as made me wince and Sir John's eye twinkle. I fancied he had formed an  unkind estimate of my rather overpowering friend, and lived to hear my  impression confirmed in unjudicial language. But our first conversation  was about the war, and it lasted until the judge's turn came for the  telescope.    \"Black with people!\" he ejaculated. \"They ought to have a constable up  there to regulate the traffic.\"    But when I looked it was long enough before my inexperienced eye could  discern the three midges strung on the single strand of cobweb against  the sloping snow.    \"They are coming down,\" explained the obliging Quinby. \"That's one of  the most difficult places, the lower edge of the top slope. It's just a  little way along to the right where the first accident was.... By the  way, your friend Evers says he's going to do the Matterhorn before he  goes.\"    It was unwelcome hearing, for Quinby had paused to regale me with a  lightning sketch of the first accident, and no one had contradicted his  gruesome details.    \"_Is_ young Evers a friend of yours?\" inquired the judge.    \"He is.\"    The judge did not say another word. But Quinby availed himself of the  first opportunity of playing Ancient Mariner to my Wedding Guest.    \"I saw you talking to them,\" he told me confidentially, \"last night, you  know!\"    \"Indeed.\"    He took me by the sleeve.    \"Of course I don't know what you said, but it's evidently had an effect.  Evers has gone off alone for the first time since he has been here.\"    I shifted my position.    \"You evidently keep an eye on him, Mr. Quinby.\"    \"I do, Clephane. I find him a diverting study. He is not the only one in  this hotel. There's old Teale on his balcony at the present minute, if  you look up. He has the best room in the hotel; the only trouble is that  it doesn't face the sun all day; he's not used to being in the shade,  and you'll hear him damn the limelight-man in heaps one of these fine  mornings. But your enterprising young friend is a more amusing person  than Belgrave Teale.\"    I had heard "]]]
