[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/832"],[0,"Robin Hood (#6)"],[1," SERVICE         List and hearken, gentlemen,       All ye that now be here,       Of Little John, that was Knight's-man,       Good mirth ye now shall hear.    It had come around another Fair day at Nottingham town, and folk crowded  there by all the gates. Goods of many kinds were displayed in gaily  colored booths, and at every cross-street a free show was in progress.  Here and there, stages had been erected for the play at quarter-staff, a  highly popular sport.    There was a fellow, one Eric of Lincoln, who was thought to be the  finest man with the staff for miles around. His feats were sung about in  ballads through all the shire. A great boaster was he withal, and to-day  he strutted about on one of these corner stages, and vaunted of his  prowess, and offered to crack any man's crown for a shilling. Several  had tried their skill with Eric, but he had soon sent them spinning in  no gentle manner, amid the jeers and laughter of the onlookers.    A beggar-man sat over against Eric's stage and grinned every time a pate  was cracked. He was an uncouth fellow, ragged and dirty and unshaven.  Eric caught sight of his leering face at one of his boasts--for there  was a lull in the game, because no man else wanted to come within reach  of Eric's blows. Eric, I say, noticed the beggar-man grinning at him  rather impudently, and turned toward him sharply.    \"How now, you dirty villain!\" quoth he, \"mend your manners to your  betters, or, by our Lady, I'll dust your rags for you.\"    The beggar-man still grinned. \"I am always ready to mend my manners to  my betters,\" said he, \"but I am afraid you cannot teach me any better  than you can dust my jacket.\"    \"Come up! Come up!\" roared the other, flourishing his staff.    \"That will I,\" said the beggar, getting up slowly and with difficulty.  \"It will pleasure me hugely to take a braggart down a notch, an some  good man will lend me a stout quarter-staff.\"    At this a score of idlers reached him their staves--being ready enough  to see another man have his head cracked, even if they wished to save  their own--and he took the stoutest and heaviest of all. He made a sorry  enough figure as he climbed awkwardly upon the stage, but when he had  gained it, he towered full half a head above the other, for all his  awkwardness. Nathless, he held his stick so clumsily that the crowd  laughed in great glee.    Now each man took his place and looked the other up and down, watching  warily for an opening. Only a moment stood they thus, for Eric, intent  on teaching this rash beggar a lesson and sweeping him speedily off the  stage, launched forth boldly and gave the other a sounding crack on the  shoulder. The beggar danced about, and made as though he would drop his  staff from very pain, while the crowd roared and Eric raised himself for  another crushing blow. But just then the awkward beggar came to life.  Straightening himself like a flash, he dealt Eric a back-handed blow,  the like of which he had never before seen. Down went the boaster to the  floor with a sounding thump, and the fickle people yelled and laughed  themselves purple; for it was a new sight to see Eric of Lincoln eating  dust.    But he was up again almost as soon as he had fallen, and right quickly  retreated to his own ringside to gather his wits and watch for an  opening. He saw instantly that he had no easy antagonist, and he came in  cautiously this time.    And now those who stood around saw the merriest game of quarter-staff  that was ever played inside the walls of Nottingham town. Both men  were on their guard and fenced with fine skill, being well matched in  prowess. Again and again did Eric seek to force an opening under the  other's guard, and just as often were his blows parried. The beggar  stood sturdily in his tracks contenting himself with beating off the  attack. For a long time their blows met like the steady crackling of  some huge forest fire, and Eric strove to be wary, for he now knew that  the other had no mean wits or mettle. But he grew right mad at last, and  began to send down blows so fierce and fast that you would have sworn  a great hail-storm was pounding on the shingles over your head. Yet he  never so much as entered the tall beggar's guard.    Then at last the stranger saw his chance and changed his tune of  fighting. With one upward stroke he sent Eric's staff whirling through  the air. With another he tapped Eric on the head; and, with a third  broad swing, ere the other could recover himself, he swept him clear off  the stage, much as you would brush a fly off the window pane.    Now the people danced and shouted and made so much ado that the  shop-keepers left their stalls and others came running from every  direction. The victory of the queer beggar made him immensely popular.  Eric had been a great bully, and many had suffered defeat and insult  at his hands. So the ragged stranger found money and food and drink  everywhere at his disposal, and he feasted right comfortably till the  afternoon.    Then a long bow contest came on, and to it the beggar went with some of  his new friends. It was held in the same arena that Robin had formerly  entered; and again the Sheriff and lords and ladies graced the scene  with their presence, while the people crowded to their places.    When the archers had stepped forward, the herald rose and proclaimed the  rules of the game: how that each man should shoot three shots, and to  him who shot best the prize of a yoke of fat steers should belong.  A dozen keen-eyed bowmen were there, and among them some of the best  fellows in the Forester's and Sheriff's companies. Down at the end of  the line towered the tall beggar-man, who must needs twang a bow-string  with the best of them.    The Sheriff noted his queer figure and asked: \"Who is that ragged  fellow?\"    \"'Tis he that hath but now so soundly cracked the crown of Eric of  Lincoln,\" was the reply.    The shooting presently began, and the targets soon showed a fine  reckoning. Last of all came the beggar's turn.    \"By your leave,\" he said loudly, \"I'd like it well to shoot with any  other man here present at a mark of my own placing.\" And he strode down  the lists with a slender peeled sapling which he stuck upright in the  ground. \"There,\" said he, \"is a right good mark. Will any man try it?\"    But not an archer would risk his reputation on so small a target.    Whereupon the beggar drew his bow with seeming carelessness and split  the wand with his shaft.    \"Long live the beggar!\" yelled the bystanders.    The Sheriff swore a full great oath, and said: \"This man is the best  archer that ever yet I saw.\" And he beckoned to him, and asked him: \"How  now, good fellow, what is your name, and in what country were you born?\"    \"In Holderness I was born,\" the man replied; \"men call me Reynold  Greenleaf.\"    \"You are a sturdy fellow, Reynold Greenleaf, and deserve better apparel  than that you wear at present. Will you enter my service? I will give  you twenty marks a year, above your living, and three good suits of  clothes.\"    \"Three good suits, say you? Then right gladly will I enter your service,  for my back has been bare this many a long day.\"    Then Reynold turned him about to the crowd and shouted: \"Hark ye, good  people, I have entered the Sheriff's service, and need not the yoke of  steers for prize. So take them for yourselves, to feast withal.\"    At this the crowd shouted more merrily than ever, and threw their caps  high into the air. And none so popular a man had come to Nottingham town  in many a long day as this same Reynold Greenleaf.    Now you may have guessed, by this time, who Reynold Greenleaf really  was; so I shall tell you that he was none other than Little John. And  forth went he to the Sheriff's house, and entered his service. But it  was a sorry day for the Sheriff when he got his new man. For Little John  winked his shrewd eye and said softly to himself: \"By my faith, I shall  be the worst servant to him that ever yet had he!\"    Two days passed by. Little John, it must be confessed, did not make  a good servant. He insisted upon eating the Sheriff's best bread and  drinking his best wine, so that the steward waxed wroth. Nathless the  Sheriff held him in high esteem, and made great talk of taking him along  on the next hunting trip.    It was now the day of the banquet to the butchers, about which we have  already heard. The banquet hall, you must know, was not in the main  house, but connected with it by a corridor. All the servants were  bustling about making preparations for the feast, save only Little John,  who must needs lie abed the greater part of the day. But he presented  himself at last, when the dinner was half over; and being desirous  of seeing the guests for himself he went into the hall with the other  servants to pass the wine. First, however, I am afraid that some of  the wine passed his own lips while he went down the corridor. When he  entered the banqueting hall, whom should he see but Robin Hood himself.  We can imagine the start of surprise felt by each of these bold fellows  upon seeing the other in such strange company. But they kept their  secrets, as we have seen, and arranged to meet each other that same  night. Meanwhile, the proud Sheriff little knew that he harbored the two  chief outlaws of the whole countryside beneath his roof.    After the feast was over and night was beginning to advance, Little John  felt faint of stomach and remembered him that he had eaten nothing all  that day. Back went he to the pantry to see what eatables were laid by.  But there, locking up the stores for the night, stood the fat steward.    \"Good Sir Steward,\" said Little John, \"give me to dine, for it is long  for Greenleaf to be fasting.\"    The steward looked grimly at him and rattled the keys at his girdle.    \"Sirrah lie-abed,\" quoth he, \"'tis late in the day to be talking of  eating. Since you have waited thus long to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/836"],[0,"The Phoenix and the Carpet (#6)"],[1,"go out again  afterwards.'    'Righto!' said every one, for the adventure had shaken the nerves of  all. So they all got on to the carpet again, and said--    'I wish we were at home.'    And lo and behold, they were no more at home than before. The carpet  never moved. The Phoenix had taken the opportunity to go to sleep.  Anthea woke it up gently.    'Look here,' she said.    'I'm looking,' said the Phoenix.    'We WISHED to be at home, and we're still here,' complained Jane.    'No,' said the Phoenix, looking about it at the high dark walls of the  tower. 'No; I quite see that.'    'But we wished to be at home,' said Cyril.    'No doubt,' said the bird, politely.    'And the carpet hasn't moved an inch,' said Robert.    'No,' said the Phoenix, 'I see it hasn't.'    'But I thought it was a wishing carpet?'    'So it is,' said the Phoenix.    'Then why--?' asked the children, altogether.    'I did tell you, you know,' said the Phoenix, 'only you are so fond  of listening to the music of your own voices. It is, indeed, the most  lovely music to each of us, and therefore--'    'You did tell us WHAT?' interrupted an Exasperated.    'Why, that the carpet only gives you three wishes a day and YOU'VE HAD  THEM.'    There was a heartfelt silence.    'Then how are we going to get home?' said Cyril, at last.    'I haven't any idea,' replied the Phoenix, kindly. 'Can I fly out and  get you any little thing?'    'How could you carry the money to pay for it?'    'It isn't necessary. Birds always take what they want. It is not  regarded as stealing, except in the case of magpies.'    The children were glad to find they had been right in supposing this to  be the case, on the day when they had wings, and had enjoyed somebody  else's ripe plums.    'Yes; let the Phoenix get us something to eat, anyway,' Robert urged--'  ('If it will be so kind you mean,' corrected Anthea, in a whisper); 'if  it will be so kind, and we can be thinking while it's gone.'    So the Phoenix fluttered up through the grey space of the tower and  vanished at the top, and it was not till it had quite gone that Jane  said--    'Suppose it never comes back.'    It was not a pleasant thought, and though Anthea at once said, 'Of  course it will come back; I'm certain it's a bird of its word,' a  further gloom was cast by the idea. For, curiously enough, there was  no door to the tower, and all the windows were far, far too high to be  reached by the most adventurous climber. It was cold, too, and Anthea  shivered.    'Yes,' said Cyril, 'it's like being at the bottom of a well.'    The children waited in a sad and hungry silence, and got little stiff  necks with holding their little heads back to look up the inside of the  tall grey tower, to see if the Phoenix were coming.    At last it came. It looked very big as it fluttered down between the  walls, and as it neared them the children saw that its bigness was  caused by a basket of boiled chestnuts which it carried in one claw.  In the other it held a piece of bread. And in its beak was a very large  pear. The pear was juicy, and as good as a very small drink. When the  meal was over every one felt better, and the question of how to get home  was discussed without any disagreeableness. But no one could think  of any way out of the difficulty, or even out of the tower; for the  Phoenix, though its beak and claws had fortunately been strong enough  to carry food for them, was plainly not equal to flying through the air  with four well-nourished children.    'We must stay here, I suppose,' said Robert at last, 'and shout out  every now and then, and some one will hear us and bring ropes and  ladders, and rescue us like out of mines; and they'll get up a  subscription to send us home, like castaways.'    'Yes; but we shan't be home before mother is, and then father'll take  away the carpet and say it's dangerous or something,' said Cyril.    'I DO wish we hadn't come,' said Jane.    And every one else said 'Shut up,' except Anthea, who suddenly awoke the  Phoenix and said--    'Look here, I believe YOU can help us. Oh, I do wish you would!'    'I will help you as far as lies in my power,' said the Phoenix, at once.  'What is it you want now?'    'Why, we want to get home,' said every one.    'Oh,' said the Phoenix. 'Ah, hum! Yes. Home, you said? Meaning?'    'Where we live--where we slept last night--where the altar is that your  egg was hatched on.'    'Oh, there!' said the Phoenix. 'Well, I'll do my best.' It fluttered on  to the carpet and walked up and down for a few minutes in deep thought.  Then it drew itself up proudly.    'I CAN help you,' it said. 'I am almost sure I can help you. Unless I  am grossly deceived I can help you. You won't mind my leaving you for an  hour or two?' and without waiting for a reply it soared up through the  dimness of the tower into the brightness above.    'Now,' said Cyril, firmly, 'it said an hour or two. But I've read  about captives and people shut up in dungeons and catacombs and things  awaiting release, and I know each moment is an eternity. Those people  always do something to pass the desperate moments. It's no use our  trying to tame spiders, because we shan't have time.'    'I HOPE not,' said Jane, doubtfully.    'But we ought to scratch our names on the stones or something.'    'I say, talking of stones,' said Robert, 'you see that heap of stones  against the wall over in that corner. Well, I'm certain there's a hole  in the wall there--and I believe it's a door. Yes, look here--the stones  are round like an arch in the wall; and here's the hole--it's all black  inside.'    He had walked over to the heap as he spoke and climbed up to  it--dislodged the top stone of the heap and uncovered a little dark  space.    Next moment every one was helping to pull down the heap of stones, and  very soon every one threw off its jacket, for it was warm work.    'It IS a door,' said Cyril, wiping his face, 'and not a bad thing  either, if--'    He was going to add 'if anything happens to the Phoenix,' but he didn't  for fear of frightening Jane. He was not an unkind boy when he had  leisure to think of such things.    The arched hole in the wall grew larger and larger. It was very, very  black, even compared with the sort of twilight at the bottom of the  tower; it grew larger because the children kept pulling off the stones  and throwing them down into another heap. The stones must have been  there a very long time, for they were covered with moss, and some of  them were stuck together by it. So it was fairly hard work, as Robert  pointed out.    When the hole reached to about halfway between the top of the arch  and the tower, Robert and Cyril let themselves down cautiously on the  inside, and lit matches. How thankful they felt then that they had a  sensible father, who did not forbid them to carry matches, as some boys'  fathers do. The father of Robert and Cyril only insisted on the matches  being of the kind that strike only on the box.    'It's not a door, it's a sort of tunnel,' Robert cried to the girls,  after the first match had flared up, flickered, and gone out. 'Stand  off--we'll push some more stones down!'    They did, amid deep excitement. And now the stone heap was almost  gone--and before them the girls saw the dark archway leading to unknown  things. All doubts and fears as to getting home were forgotten in this  thrilling moment. It was like Monte Cristo--it was like--    'I say,' cried Anthea, suddenly, 'come out! There's always bad air in  places that have been shut up. It makes your torches go out, and then  you die. It's called fire-damp, I believe. Come out, I tell you.'    The urgency of her tone actually brought the boys out--and then every  one took up its jacket and fanned the dark arch with it, so as to  make the air fresh inside. When Anthea thought the air inside 'must be  freshened by now,' Cyril led the way into the arch.    The girls followed, and Robert came last, because Jane refused to tail  the procession lest 'something' should come in after her, and catch at  her from behind. Cyril advanced cautiously, lighting match after match,  and peering before him.    'It's a vaulting roof,' he said, 'and it's all stone--all right,  Panther, don't keep pulling at my jacket! The air must be all right  because of the matches, silly, and there are--look out--there are steps  down.'    'Oh, don't let's go any farther,' said Jane, in an agony of reluctance  (a very painful thing, by the way, to be in). 'I'm sure there are  snakes, or dens of lions, or something. Do let's go back, and come some  other time, with candles, and bellows for the fire-damp.'    'Let me get in front of you, then,' said the stern voice of Robert, from  behind. 'This is exactly the place for buried treasure, and I'm going  on, anyway; you can stay behind if you like.'    And then, of course, Jane consented to go on.    So, very slowly and carefully, the children went down the steps--there  were seventeen of them--and at the bottom of the steps were more  passages branching four ways, and a sort of low arch on the right-hand  side made Cyril wonder what it could be, for it was too low to be the  beginning of another passage.    So he knelt down and lit a match, and stooping very low he peeped in.    'There's SOMETHING,' he said, and reached out his hand. It touched  something that felt more like a damp bag of marbles than anything else  that Cyril had ever touched.    'I believe it IS a buried treasure,' he cried.    And it was; for even as Anthea cried, 'Oh, hurry up, Squirrel--fetch it  out!' Cyril pulled out a rotting canvas bag--about as big as the paper  ones the greengrocer gives you with Barcelona nuts in for sixpence.    'There's more of it, a lot more,' he said.    As he pulled the rotten bag gave way, and the gold coins ran and span  and jumped and bumped and chinked and clinked on the floor of the dark  passage.    I wonder what you would say if you"]]]
