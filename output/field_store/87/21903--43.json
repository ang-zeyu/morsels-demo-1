Omens were resorted to  for keeping up the enthusiasm which the presence of the First Consul  naturally inspired. A Roman battle-axe was said to be found when they  removed the earth to pitch Bonaparte's tent or barrack; and medals of  William the Conqueror were produced, as having been dug up upon the same  honoured spot. These were pleasant bodings, yet perhaps did not  altogether, in the minds of the soldiers, counterbalance the sense of  insecurity impressed on them by the prospect of being packed together in  these miserable chaloupes, and exposed to the fire of an enemy so  superior at sea, that during the chief consul's review of the  fortifications, their frigates stood in shore with composure, and fired  at him and his suite as at a mark. The men who had braved the perils of  the Alps and of the Egyptian deserts, might yet be allowed to feel alarm  at a species of danger which seemed so inevitable, and which they had no  adequate means of repelling by force of arms.    A circumstance which seemed to render the expedition in a great measure  hopeless, was the ease with which the English could maintain a constant  watch upon their operations within the port of Boulogne. The least  appearance of stir or preparation, to embark troops, or get ready for  sea, was promptly sent by signal to the English coast, and the numerous  British cruisers were instantly on the alert to attend their motions.  Nelson had, in fact, during the last war, declared the sailing of a  hostile armament from Boulogne to be a most forlorn undertaking, on  account of cross tides and other disadvantages, together with the  certainty of the flotilla being lost if there were the least wind  west-north-west. \"As for rowing,\" he adds, \"that is impossible.--It is  perfectly right to be prepared for a mad government,\" continued this  incontestable judge of maritime possibilities; \"but with the active  force which has been given me, I may pronounce it almost impracticable.\"    Before quitting the subject, we may notice, that Bonaparte seems not to  have entertained the least doubts of success, could he have succeeded in  disembarking his army. A single general action was to decide the fate of  England. Five days were to bring Napoleon to London, where he was to  perform the part of William the Third; but with more generosity and  disinterestedness. He was to call a meeting of the inhabitants, restore  them what he calls their rights, and destroy the oligarchical faction. A  few months would not, according to his account, have elapsed, ere the  two nations, late such determined enemies, would have been identified by  their principles, their maxims, their interests. The full explanation of  this gibberish, (for it can be termed no better, even proceeding from  the lips of Napoleon,) is to be found elsewhere, when he spoke a  language more genuine than that of the _Moniteur_ and the bulletins.  \"England,\" he said, \"must have ended, by becoming an appendage to the  France of _my_ system. Nature has made it one of our islands, as well as  Oleron and Corsica.\"    It is impossible not to pursue the train of reflections which Bonaparte  continued to pour forth to the companion of his exile, on the rock of  Saint Helena. When England was conquered, and identified with France in  maxims and principles, according to one form of expression, or rendered  an appendage and dependency, according to another phrase, the reader may  suppose that Bonaparte would have considered his mission as  accomplished. Alas! it was not much more than commenced. \"I would have  departed from thence [from subjugated Britain] to carry the work of  European regeneration [that is, the extention of his own arbitrary  authority] from south to north, under the Republican colours, for I was  then Chief Consul, in the same manner which I was more lately on the  point of achieving it under the monarchical forms.\" When we find such  ideas retaining hold of Napoleon's imagination, and arising to his  tongue after his irretrievable fall, it is impossible to avoid  exclaiming, Did ambition ever conceive so wild a dream, and had so wild  a vision ever a termination so disastrous and humiliating!    It may be expected that something should be here said, upon the chances  which Britain would have had of defending herself successfully against  the army of invaders. We are willing to acknowledge that the risk must  have been dreadful; and that Bonaparte, with his genius and his army,  must have inflicted severe calamities upon a country which had so long  enjoyed the blessings of peace. But the people were unanimous in their  purpose of defence, and their forces composed of materials to which  Bonaparte did more justice when he came to be better acquainted with  them. Of the three British nations, the English have since shown  themselves possessed of the same steady valour which won the fields of  Cressy and Agincourt, Blenheim and Minden--the Irish have not lost the  fiery enthusiasm which has distinguished them in all the countries of  Europe--nor have the Scots degenerated from the stubborn courage with  which their ancestors for two thousand years maintained their  independence against a superior enemy. Even if London had been lost, we  would not, under so great a calamity, have despaired of the freedom of  the country; for the war would in all probability have assumed that  popular and national character which sooner or later wears out an  invading army. Neither does the confidence with which Bonaparte affirms  the conviction of his winning the first battle, appear go certainly well  founded. This, at least, we know, that the resolution of the country was  fully bent up to the hazard; and those who remember the period will bear  us witness, that the desire that the French would make the attempt, was  a general feeling through all classes, because they had every reason to  hope that the issue might be such as for ever to silence the threat  of invasion.    The next most important occurrence that claims our notice in this  volume, and which fully delineates the nature and character of this  wonderful and ambitious individual, is the account of his declaration as  Emperor of France, and his subsequent Coronation.      CORONATION OF NAPOLEON.    Measures were taken, as on former occasions, to preserve appearances, by  obtaining, in show at least, the opinion of the people, on this radical  change of their system. Government, however, were already confident of  their approbation, which, indeed, had never been refused to any of the  various constitutions, however inconsistent, that had succeeded each  other with such rapidity. Secure on this point, Bonaparte's accession to  the empire was proclaimed with the greatest pomp, without waiting to  inquire whether the people approved of his promotion or otherwise. The  proclamation was coldly received, even by the populace, and excited  little enthusiasm. It seemed, according to some writers, as if the  shades of D'Enghien and Pichegru had been present invisibly, and spread  a damp over the ceremony. The Emperor was recognised by the soldiery  with more warmth. He visited the encampments at Boulogne, with the  intention, apparently, of receiving such an acknowledgment from the  troops as was paid by the ancient Franks to their monarchs, when they  elevated them on their bucklers. Seated on an iron chair, said to have  belonged to king Dagobert, he took his place between two immense camps,  and having before him the Channel and the hostile coasts of England. The  weather, we have been assured, had been tempestuous, but no sooner had  the Emperor assumed his seat, to receive the homage of his shouting  host, than the sky cleared, and the wind dropt, retaining just breath  sufficient gently to wave the banners. Even the elements seemed to  acknowledge the imperial dignity, all save the sea, which rolled as  carelessly to the feet of Napoleon as it had formerly done towards those  of Canute the Dane.    The Emperor, accompanied with his Empress, who bore her honours both  gracefully and meekly, visited Aix-la-Chapelle, and the frontiers of  Germany. They received the congratulations of all the powers of Europe,  excepting England, Russia, and Sweden, upon their new exaltation; and  the German princes, who had everything to hope and fear from so powerful  a neighbour, hastened to pay their compliments to Napoleon in person,  which more distant sovereigns offered by their ambassadors.    But the most splendid and public recognition of his new rank was yet to  be made, by the formal act of coronation, which, therefore, Napoleon  determined should take place with circumstances of solemnity, which had  been beyond the reach of any temporal prince, however powerful, for  many ages. His policy was often marked by a wish to revive, imitate, and  connect his own titles and interest with, some ancient observance of  former days; as if the novelty of his claims could have been rendered  more venerable by investing them with antiquated forms, or as men of low  birth, when raised to wealth and rank, are sometimes desirous to conceal  the obscurity of their origin under the blaze of heraldic honours. Pope  Leo, he remembered, had placed a golden crown on the head of  Charlemagne, and proclaimed him Emperor of the Romans. Pius VII. he  determined should do the same for a successor to much more than the  actual power of Charlemagne. But though Charlemagne had repaired to Rome  to receive inauguration from the hands of the Pontiff of that day,  Napoleon resolved that he who now owned the proud, and in Protestant  eyes profane, title of Vicar of Christ, should travel to France to  perform the coronation of the successful chief, by whom the See of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],[0,"The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#6)"],[1,"he bought    yesterday, as he wishes to exhibit its beauty to his friends.\" The wife    gave the servant the ornament, the theft was made manifest, and it was    restored to its rightful owner.      And Enan goes on:    THE SON AND THE SLAVE      A merchant of measureless wealth had an only son, who, when he grew up,    said, \"Father, send me on a voyage, that I may trade and see foreign    lands, and talk with men of wisdom, to learn from their words.\" The    father purchased a ship, and sent him on a voyage, with much wealth and    many friends. The father was left at home with his slave, in whom he put    his trust, and who filled his son's place in position and affection.    Suddenly a pain seized him in the heart, and he died without directing    how his property was to be divided. The slave took possession of    everything; no one in the town knew whether he was the man's slave or his    son. Ten years passed, and the real son returned, with his ship laden    with wealth. As they approached the harbor, the ship was wrecked. They    had cast everything overboard, in a vain effort to save it; finally, the    crew and the passengers were all thrown into the sea. The son reached the    shore destitute, and returned to his father's house; but the slave drove    him away, denying his identity. They went before the judge. \"Find the    loathly merchant's grave,\" he said to the slave, \"and bring me the dead    man's bones. I shall burn them for his neglect to leave a will, thus    rousing strife as to his property.\" The slave started to obey, but the    son stayed him. \"Keep all,\" said he, \"but disturb not my father's bones.\"    \"Thou art the son,\" said the judge; \"take this other as thy lifelong    slave.\"      Joseph and Enan pass to the city of Tobiah. At the gate they are accosted  by an old and venerable man, to whom they explain that they have been on  the way for seven days. He invites them to his home, treats them  hospitably, and after supper tells them sweet and pleasant tales, \"among  his words an incident wonderful to the highest degree.\" This wonderful  story is none other than a distorted version of the Book of Tobit. I have  translated this in full, and in rhymed prose, as a specimen of the  original.      THE STORY OF TOBIT      Here, in the days of the saints of old, in the concourse of elders of age    untold, there lived a man upright and true, in all his doings good    fortune he knew. Rich was he and great, his eyes looked ever straight:    Tobiah, the son of Ahiah, a man of Dan, helped the poor, to each gave of    his store; whene'er one friendless died, the shroud he supplied, bore the    corpse to the grave, nor thought his money to save. The men of the place,    a sin-ruled race, slandering, cried, \"O King, these Jewish knaves open    our graves! Our bones they burn, into charms to turn, health to earn.\"    The king angrily spoke: \"I will weighten their yoke, and their villainy    repay; all the Jews who, from to-day, die in this town, to the pit take    down, to the pit hurry all, without burial. Who buries a Jew, the hour    shall rue; bitter his pang, on the gallows shall he hang.\" Soon a    sojourner did die, and no friends were by; but good Tobiah the corpse did    lave, and dress it for the grave. Some sinners saw the deed, to the judge    the word they gave, who Tobiah's death decreed. Forth the saint they    draw, to hang him as by law. But now they near the tree, lo! no man can    see, a blindness falls on all, and Tobiah flies their thrall. Many    friends his loss do weep, but homewards he doth creep, God's mercies to    narrate, and his own surprising fate, \"Praise ye the Lord, dear friends,    for His mercy never ends, and to His servants good intends.\" Fear the    king distressed, his heart beat at his breast, new decrees his fear    expressed. \"Whoe'er a Jew shall harm,\" the king cried in alarm, \"touching    his person or personalty, touches the apple of my eye; let no man do this    wrong, or I'll hang him 'mid the throng, high though his rank, and his    lineage long.\" And well he kept his word, he punished those who erred;    but on the Jews his mercies shone, the while he rilled the throne.      Once lay the saint at rest, and glanced upon the nest of a bird within    his room. Ah! cruel was his doom! Into his eye there went the sparrow's    excrement. Tobiah's sight was gone! He had an only son, whom thus he now    addressed: \"When business ventures pressed, I passed from clime to clime.    Well I recall the time, when long I dwelt in Ind, of wealth full stores    to find. But perilous was the road, and entrusted I my load with one of    honest fame, Peer Hazeman his name. And now list, beloved son, go out and    hire thee one, thy steps forthwith to guide unto my old friend's side. I    know his love's full stream, his trust he will redeem; when heareth he my    plight, when seeth he thy sight, then will he do the right.\" The youth    found whom he sought, a man by travel taught, the ways of Ind he knew; he    knew them through and through, he knew them up and down, as a townsman    knows his town. He brought him to his sire, who straightway did inquire,    \"Knowest thou an Indian spot, a city named Tobot?\"--\"Full well I know the    place, I spent a two years' space in various enterprise; its people all    are wise, and honest men and true.\"--\"What must I give to you,\" asked    Tobiah of his guest,\" to take my son in quest?\"--\"Of pieces pure of    gold, full fifty must be told.\"--\"I'll pay you that with joy; start forth    now with my boy.\" A script the son did write, which Tobiah did indite,    and on his son bestow a sign his friend would know. The father kissed his    son, \"In peace,\" said he, \"get gone; may God my life maintain till thou    art come again.\" The youth and guide to Tobot hied, and reached anon Peer    Hazeman. \"Why askest thou my name?\" Straight the answer came, \"Tobiah is    my sire, and he doth inquire of thy health and thy household's.\" Then the    letter he unfolds. The contents Peer espies, every doubt flies, he    regards the token with no word spoken. \"'Tis the son of my friend, who    greeting thus doth send. Is it well with him? Say.\"--\"Well, well with him    alway.\"--\"Then dwell thou here a while, and hours sweet beguile with the    tales which thou wilt tell of him I loved so well.\"--\"Nay, I must    forthwith part to soothe my father's heart. I am his only trust, return    at once I must.\" Peer Hazeman agrees the lad to release; gives him all    his father's loan, and gifts adds of his own, raiment and two slaves. To    music's pleasant staves, the son doth homeward wend. By the shore of the    sea went the lad full of glee, and the wind blew a blast, and a fish was    upward cast. Then hastened the guide to ope the fish's side, took the    liver and the gall, for cure of evil's thrall: liver to give demons    flight, gall to restore men's sight. The youth begged his friend these    specifics to lend, then went he on his way to where his sick sire lay.    Then spake the youth to his father all the truth. \"Send not away the    guide without pay.\" The son sought the man, through the city he ran, but    the man had disappeared. Said Tobiah, \"Be not afeared, 'twas Elijah the    seer, whom God sent here to stand by our side, our needs to provide.\" He    bathed both his eyes with the gall of the prize, and his sight was    restored by the grace of the Lord.      Then said he to his son, \"Now God His grace has shown, dost thou not    yearn to do a deed in turn? My niece forthwith wed.\"--\"But her husbands    three are dead, each gave up his life as each made her his wife; to her    shame and to her sorrow, they survived not to the morrow.\"--\"Nay, a demon    is the doer of this harm to every wooer. My son, obey my wish, take the    liver of the fish, and burn it in full fume, at the door of her    room,'twill give the demon his doom.\" At his father's command, with his    life in his hand, the youth sought the maid, and wedded her unafraid. For    long timid hours his prayer Tobiah pours; but the incense was alight, the    demon took to flight, and safe was all the night. Long and happily wed,    their lives sweetly sped.    Their entertainer tells Joseph and Enan another story of piety connected  with the burial of the dead:      THE PARALYTICS TOUCHSTONE OF VIRTUE      Once upon a time there lived a saintly man, whose abode was on the way to    the graveyard. Every funeral passed his door, and he would ever rise and    join in the procession, and assist those engaged in the burial. In his    old age his feet were paralyzed, and he could not leave his bed; the dead    passed his doors, and he sighed that he could not rise to display his    wonted respect. Then prayed he to the Lord: \"O Lord, who givest eyes to    the blind and feet to the lame, hear me from the corner of my sorrowful    bed. Grant that when a pious man is borne to his grave, I may be able to    rise to my feet.\" An angel's voice in a vision answered him, \"Lo, thy    prayer is heard.\" And so, whenever a pious man was buried, he rose and    prayed for his soul. On a day, there died one who had grown old in the    world's repute, a man of excellent piety, yet the lame man could not rise    as his funeral passed. Next day died a quarrelsome fellow of ill fame for    his notorious sins, and when his body was carried past the lame man's    door, the paralytic was able to stand. Every one was amazed, for hitherto    the lame man's rising or resting had been a gauge of the departed's    virtue. Two sage men resolved to get to the bottom of the mystery. They    interviewed the wife of the fellow who had died second. The wife    confirmed the worst account of him, but added: \"He had an old father,    aged one hundred years, and he honored and served him. Every day he    kissed his hand, gave him drink, stripped and dressed him when, from old    age, he could not turn himself on"]]]
