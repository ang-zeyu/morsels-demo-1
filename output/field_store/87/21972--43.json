Oxymuriate matches must \"hide their diminished heads\" before the  recent invention of a method of obtaining light, by merely compressing  a match, which inflames instantaneously. These matches are called  _Prometheans_, and comparing small things with great, we know not a  better name to imply the scientific age to which the invention  belongs.        _Fossil Fish_.    Mr. Mantell, of Lewes, has lately added to his museum a fine specimen  of a fossil fish, discovered in a bed of clay belonging to the Hasting  sand formation. Similar remains are abundant in the strata of Tilgate  Forest, in the white rock at Hastings, and in the sandstone quarries  near Tunbridge Wells; but they consist, for the most part, of detached  scales only.        _Wonders of Art_.    Among the last we notice the model of a boat for aerial navigation,  lately sent to the French Academy from Rome; and the patent taken out  at Paris for a coach with one wheel only, to accommodate 30 or 40  passengers. The perfection of the latter scheme in England would  render indispensable a complete revision of our Turnpike Acts.           *       *       *       *       *          NOTES OF A READER.           *       *       *       *       *      SCOTTISH INNS.    _By Sir Walter Scott_.      The courtesy of an invitation to partake a traveller's meal, or at least  that of being invited to share whatever liquor the guest called for, was  expected by certain old landlords in Scotland, even in the youth of  the author. In requital, mine host was always furnished with the news  of the country, and was probably a little of a humourist to boot. The  devolution of the whole actual business and drudgery of the inn upon the  poor gudewife was very common among the Scottish bonifaces. There was  in ancient times, in the city of Edinburgh, a gentleman of good family,  who condescended, in order to gain a livelihood, to become the nominal  keeper of a coffee-house, one of the first places of the kind which  had been opened in the Scottish metropolis. As usual, it was entirely  managed by the careful and industrious Mrs. B----; while her husband  amused himself with field-sports, without troubling his head about the  matter. Once upon a time the premises having taken fire, the husband was  met walking up the High Street, loaded with his guns and fishing-rods,  and replied calmly to some one that inquired after his wife, \"that the  poor woman was trying to save a parcel of crockery, and some trumpery  books;\" the last being those which served her to conduct the business  of the house. There were many elderly gentlemen in the author's younger  days, who still held it part of the amusement of a journey \"to parley  with mine host,\" who often resembled, in his quaint humour, mine Host of  the Garter, in the Merry Wives of Windsor; or Blague of the George, in  the Merry Devil of Edmonton. Sometimes the landlady took her share of  entertaining the company. In either case, the omitting to pay them due  attention gave displeasure, and perhaps brought down a smart jest, as on  the following occasion:--A jolly dame who, not \"sixty years since,\" kept  the principal caravansary at Greenlaw, in Berwickshire, had the honour  to receive under her roof a very worthy clergyman, with three sons of  the same profession, each having a cure of souls; be it said in passing,  none of the reverend party were reckoned powerful in the pulpit. After  dinner was over, the worthy senior, in the pride of his heart, asked  Mrs. Buchan whether she ever had had such a party in her house before.  \"Here sit I,\" he said, \"a placed minister of the kirk of Scotland,  and here sit my three sons, each a placed minister of the same  kirk.--Confess, Luckie Buchan, you never had such a party in your house  before.\" The question was not premised by any invitation to sit down and  take a glass of wine or the like, so Mrs. B. answered drily, \"Indeed,  sir, I cannot just say that ever I had such a party in my house before,  except once in the forty-five, when I had a Highland piper here, with  his three sons, all Highland pipers; _and deil a spring they could play  amang them!\"--Notes to the New Edition of the Waverley Novels_.           *       *       *       *       *      CATCHING TIGERS.      In some parts of South America, a great many tigers are caught with  the lasso by the Indian and Creole inhabitants for the sake of their  skins. They are also sometimes entrapped in the following manner: a  large chest, or wooden frame, is made, supported upon four wheels, and  is dragged by oxen to a place where the traces of tigers have been  discovered. In the furthest corner of the chest is put a putrid piece  of flesh, by way of bait, which is no sooner laid hold of by the tiger  than the door of the trap falls; he is killed by a musket ball, or a  spear thrust through the crevices of the planks.--_Memoirs of General  Miller_.           *       *       *       *       *    ODE.

The maid whose lips all sweets contain,    The minstrel with bewitching strain,    And, by my side, the merry soul    Who briskly circulates the bowl!      A maiden full of life and light,    Like Eden's fountains pure and bright;    Whose sweetness steals the heart away,    Mild, beauteous, as the moon of May.      A banquet-hall, the social room,    Cool, spacious, breathing rich perfume,    Like that fair hall where, midst the roses,    Each saint in heaven above reposes!      Servants in briskness who excel,    Friends who can keep a secret well,    And merry men who love their lass,    And drink your health in many a glass.      Wine, sparkling like the ruby bright,    Neither too sweet, nor yet too light;    One draught from purple wine we'll sip,    And one from beauty's rosy lip!      A maid, whose joyous glances roll    To cheer the heart and charm the soul;    Whose graceful locks, that flow behind,    Engage and captivate mankind!      A noble friend, whose rank is grac'd    By learning and poetic taste;    Who, like my Patron, loves the bard,    Well skill'd true merit to reward!      Breathes there a man too cold to prove    The joys of friendship or of love?

As one of the signs of the times we notice the almost simultaneous  appearance of three new Literary Gazettes, at Edinburgh, Oxford, and  Manchester. One of the latter contains a wood-cut of the Manchester  Royal Institution, and eight quarto pages for three-pence. Among the  original articles is a sketch of Mr. Kean, in which the writer says,  \"Mr. Kean's countenance was some years since, one of the finest ever  beheld, and his eye the brightest and most penetrating. Without ever  having seen Lord Byron, we should say there must have been a great  similarity of features and expression between them.\"           *       *       *       *       *      DUELLING CODE.      People talk about the voluminous nature of our statute-books,  forsooth. Nonsense! they are not half large or numerous enough. There  is room and necessity for hundreds and thousands of new laws; and if  duelling cannot be prevented, it might at least be regulated, and a  shooting license regularly taken out every year; and the licenses only  granted to persons of a certain rank, and property, and age. Say, for  instance, that none under fifteen years shall be allowed a license;  that livery servants, apprentices, clerks in counting-houses, coach  and wagon offices, hair-dressers, and tailors who use the thimble in  person, should be considered as unqualified persons. This would render  duelling more select and respectable.--_Rank and Talent_.           *       *       *       *       *      SOUTH AMERICAN BANDITTI.      The vicinity of Lima is occasionally infested by banditti, carrying on  their operations in open day with so much system, that all who chance  to travel at that time are sure to be relieved of their valuables.  These robbers are composed chiefly of free mulattoes and others of a  mixed race. The evil has existed from time immemorial, and is of  purely Spanish origin; for Indian honesty, in retired villages, is so  great, that when a family for a time leaves its cage-like hut, the  latchless wicket is left ajar; a brush is placed on the sill, and it  would be worse than sacrilege for any one to cross the threshold under  any pretence. It has happened that the brigands, well armed and well  mounted, have assembled at distant and uncertain periods within a mile  of Callao. They direct their course towards Lima, stop all whom they  meet, and having very civilly lightened them of their purses, oblige  the plundered persons to accompany the robbers, till all arrive near  to the city gate, when the banditti disperse. Some ride boldly into  the town; many conceal themselves in the thickets of canes; whilst  others cut across the country, and return quietly to their homes, to  enjoy the spoil, or follow their usual occupations. The banditti, on  such extraordinary occasions, amount to twenty or thirty in number;  and it has happened that they have had about twenty carriages, besides  persons dismounted and made to lead their own horses, in the train,  which was regularly brought up by a rear-guard, while the advanced  scouts pushed on to secure fresh booty.

Mounted, armed, and commanded by a leader, they proceeded  to arrest such notorious offenders as were deemed fit subjects of  exemplary justice; their operations were generally carried on in the night.  Squire Birch, who was personated by one of the party, established his  tribunal under a tree in the woods, and the culprit was brought before him,  tried, and generally convicted; he was then tied to a tree, lashed without  mercy, and ordered to leave the country within a given time, under pain of  a second visitation. It seldom happened that more than one or two were  thus punished; their confederates took the hint and fled, or were  admonished to quit the neighbourhood.\"           *       *       *       *       *      MONUMENTAL ALTERATION.      The following odd story is related respecting a monument in a chapel,  adjoining _Stene_, a fine family seat in the north:--The sculptor, in that  vile taste which seems to have originated in an unhappy design of making  every thing connected with the grave revolting to our feelings, had  ornamented this monument with \"a very ghastly, grinning alabaster skull;\"  and the bishop one day expressed a wish to his domestic chaplain, Dr. Grey,  that it had not been placed there. Grey, upon this, sent to Banbury for  the sculptor, and consulted with him whether it was not possible to  convert it into a soothing, instead of a painful object. After some  consideration, the artist declared that the only thing into which he could  possibly convert it was--a bunch of grapes! and accordingly, at this day,  a bunch of grapes may be seen upon the monument; for the chapel, which for  a time had been abandoned to the rooks and daws who built their nests  among the monuments, has been repaired, and is now united to the rectory  of Hinton.           *       *       *       *       *      It is easier to induce people to follow than to set an example--however  good it may be both for themselves and others, most men have a silly  squeamishness about proposing an adjournment from the dinner table. The  host, fearing that his guest may take it for a token that he loves his  wine better than his friends, is obliged to feign an unwillingness to  leave the bottle, and, as Sponge says--\"In good truth, 'tis impossible,  nay, I say it is impudent, to contradict any gentleman at his own table;  the president is always the wisest man in the party.\"      \"Be of our patron's mind, whate'er he says;    Sleep very much, think little, and talk less;    Mind neither good nor bad, nor right nor wrong,    But eat your pudding, fool, and hold your tongue.\"    MAT.

Therefore his friends, unless a special commission be given to them for  that purpose, feel unwilling to break the gay circle of conviviality, and  are individually shy of asking for what almost every one  wishes.--_Kitchiner_.           *       *       *       *       *      Though much has been done, the orthography of the Dutch language can  hardly be considered as positively fixed. A witty writer and one who has  _biographized_ the Dutch poets with some severity, but much talent, says--      Spell--\"Wereld \"--so sets up Siegenbeek, and then    Comes Bilderdyk, and flings it down again.    He will have \"Wareld\"--'Tis a pretty quarrel    Shall I determine who shall wear the laurel:    Not I!--I like them both--and so I'll say    \"Waereld\"--and each shall have his own dear way.             *       *       *       *       *      THE MEXICAN NAVY      Is in a most deplorable state. The difficulty of reducing the Castle of  San Juan de Ulloa led to the collection of some gun-boats, a couple of  sloops of war, and two or three armed schooners. This number has since  received the addition of a line of battle ship, two frigates, and some  other vessels of war. Some English and American officers were engaged,  but we believe that all the former have left the service, and that very  few of the latter remain. Commodore Porter, of vain-glorious memory,  (who once wrote a book of Voyages,) was, and may be still, the marine  commandant, and distinguished himself by threatening to blockade Cuba,  and by being obliged to skulk at Key West, to avoid destruction by the  gallant Laborde. The Mexicans require no navy, and cannot maintain one;  the sooner, therefore, they restrict it to a very few revenue cutters  the better. The nature of the country and the destructive climate of  the coast, diminish greatly the necessity for keeping up a military  establishment for _external_ defence. Foreign invasion can do little;  more is to be dreaded from internal dissensions.--_Foreign Quarterly  Review_.           *       *       *       *       *      A prudent host, who is not in the humour to submit to an attack from  \"staunch topers,\" \"who love to keep it up\" as _bons vivants_, whose  favourite song is ever \"_Fly not yet_,\" will engage some sober friends  to fight on his side, and at a certain hour to vote for \"no more wine,\"  and bravely demand \"tea,\" and will select his company with as much care  as a chemist composes a neutral salt, judiciously providing quite as  large a proportion of alkali (tea men) as he has of acid (wine men.)  To adjust the balance of power at the court of Bacchus, occasionally  requires as much address as sagacious politicians say is sometimes  requisite to direct the affairs of other courts.    To make the summons of the tea table serve as an effective ejectment to  the dinner table, let it be announced as a special invitation from the  lady of the house. It may be, for example, \"Mrs. Souchong requests the  pleasure of your company to the drawing-room.\" This is an irresistible  mandamus.      \"Though Bacchus may boast of his care-killing bowl,      And Folly in thought drowning revels delight,    Such worship soon loses its charms for the soul,      When softer devotions our senses invite.\"    CAPTAIN MORRIS.    _Dr. Kitchiner._           *       *       *       *       *      MAKING TEA.      It has been long observed that the infusion of tea made in silver, or  polished metal tea-pots, is stronger than that which is produced in black,  or other kinds of earthenware pots. This is explained on the principle,  that polished surfaces retain heat much better than dark, rough surfaces,  and that, consequently, the caloric being confined in the former case,  must act more powerfully than in the latter.    It is further certain, that the silver or metal pot, when filled a second  time, produces worse tea than the earthenware vessel; and that it is  advisable to use the earthenware pot, unless a silver or metal one can be  procured sufficiently large to contain at once all that may be required.  These facts are readily explained by considering, that the action of heat  retained by the silver vessel so far exhausts the herb as to leave very  little soluble substance for a second infusion; whereas the reduced  temperature of the water in the earthenware pot, by extracting only a  small proportion at first, leaves some soluble matter for the action of  a subsequent infusion.    The reason for pouring boiling water into the tea-pot before the infusion  of the tea is made, is, that the vessel being previously warm, may  abstract less heat from the mixture, and thus admit a more powerful action.  Neither is it difficult to explain the fact why the infusion of tea is  stronger if only a small quantity of boiling water be first used, and more  be added some time afterwards; for if we consider that only the water  immediately in contact with the herb can act upon it, and that it cools  very rapidly, especially in earthenware vessels, it is clear that the  effect will be greater where the heat is kept up by additions of boiling  water, than where the vessel is filled at once, and the fluid suffered  gradually to cool.    When the infusion has once been completed, it is found that any further  addition of the herb only affords a very small increase in the strength,  the water having cooled much below the boiling point, and consequently,  acting very slightly.    _Ibid._           *       *       *       *       *          THE NATURALIST.           *       *       *       *       *      THE HUMAN EAR.      The ear consists of three principal divisions, viz. the external,  intermediate, and internal ear. The different parts of the first division,  or external ear, are described by anatomists under the name of the helix,  antihelix, tragus, antitragus, the lobe, cavitas innominata, the scapha,  and the concha. In the middle of the external ear is the meatus, or  passage, which varies in length in different individuals. The external  or outward ear is designed by nature to stand prominent, and to bear  its proportion in the symmetry of the head, but in Europe it is greatly  flattened by the pressure of the dress; it consists chiefly of elastic  cartilage, formed with different hollows, or sinuosities, all leading into  each other, and finally terminating in the concha, or immediate opening  into the tube of the ear. This form is admirably adapted for the reception  of sound, for collecting and retaining it, so that it may not pass off, or  be sent too rapidly to the seat of the impression. There have been a few  instances of men who had the power of moving the external ear in a similar  manner to that of animals; but these instances are very rare, and rather  deviations from the general structure; nor did it appear in these  instances that such individuals heard more acutely: a proof that such a  structure would be of no advantage to the human subject. With respect  to the external ear in man, whether it is completely removed either by  accident or design, deafness ensues, although its "]]]
