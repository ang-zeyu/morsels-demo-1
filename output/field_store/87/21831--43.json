A pronoun which refers to the same person or thing as the subject  of the verb in the sentence, but is used in some other relation than  subject of that verb, is said to be used \"reflexively\", or to be a  \"reflexive pronoun\".      39. The first and second personal pronouns, \"mi\", \"ni\", and \"vi\",  (\"ci\") are used for the reflexive pronouns of the first and second  persons. There can be no ambiguity, since words such as \"me, myself,  us, ourselves,\" can refer to no one else than the person or persons  speaking; while words such as \"you, yourself, yourselves (thee,  thyself),\" can refer to no one else than the person or persons  addressed:       Mi vidas min, I see myself.     Mi diris al mi, I said to myself.     Ni havas tapisxon sub ni, we have a carpet under us.     Ni amuzis nin, we amused ourselves.     (Ci trovas domon apud ci, thou findest a house near thee.)     Vi diras al vi, you say to yourself (yourselves).     Vi amuzas vin, you amuse yourself (yourselves).    40. When the verb is in the third person, a pronoun of the third person,  used otherwise than as the subject, might or might not refer to the  subject of that verb. For example, \"He sees a bird near him,\" may mean  that the subject sees a bird near himself, or near another person.  If such a pronoun of the third person is intended to refer to the  subject of the verb, Esperanto uses a special reflexive pronoun \"si\"  (accusative \"sin\"), which means \"him(self)\", \"her(self)\", \"it(self)\",  \"them(selves)\", according to the gender and number of the verb:       Li amuzas sin, he amuses himself.     Arturo vidis birdon apud si, Arthur saw a bird near him(self).     Sxi trovas floron apud si, she finds a flower near her(self).     Mario trovis sin sur blua tapisxo,        Mary found herself on a blue carpet.     La tapisxo havas diversajn kolorojn en si,        the carpet has various colors in it(self).     La birdo kasxas sin sub la folioj,        the bird hides itself under the leaves.     Ili amuzas sin, they amuse themselves.     La viroj havas segxojn apud si,        the men have chairs near them(selves).     La virinoj trovas florojn apud si,        the women find flowers near them(selves).     La arboj havas cxerizojn sur si,        the trees have cherries on them(selves).     Sub si la infanoj trovis molan tapisxon,        under them(selves) the children found a soft carpet.    [Footnote: From the very fact that \"si\" always refers to the subject of  the verb, it is evident that \"si\" can never itself be used as subject or  part of the subject of the verb.]                                  REFLEXIVE VERBS.    41. A verb having a reflexive pronoun for its direct object is sometimes  called a \"reflexive verb\", from the fact that some languages have had or  still have a special reflexive or middle form of the verb, to express an  act of the subject on or for itself, or they have certain verbs whose  use is chiefly or exclusively reflexive. The conjugation of a verb  reflexively is therefore as follows:       mi amuzas min (mi min amuzas), I amuse myself.     vi amuzas vin (vi vin amuzas), you amuse yourself.     li (sxi, gxi) amuzas sin (sin amuzas),        he (she, it) amuses him (her, it)self.     ni amuzas nin (ni nin amuzas), we amuse ourselves.     vi amuzas vin (vi vin amuzas), you amuse yourselves.     ili amuzas sin (ili sin amuzas), they amuse themselves.    [Footnote: As Greek \"etraponto\", they turned themselves; Latin  \"exerceor\", I exercise myself, \"vescor\", I eat (I feed myself); German  \"ich huete mich\", I beware (I guard myself); Spanish \"me alegro\", or  \"alegrome\", I rejoice (I gladden myself); French \"il s'arrete\", he halts  (he stops himself).]                                     VOCABULARY       Alfredo = Alfred.                  komenci = to begin.     amuzi = to amuse.                  lauxdi = to praise.     antaux = before, in front of.      legi = to read.     aparteni = to belong.              libro = book.     griza = gray.                      perdi = to lose.     iri = to go.                       skatolo = small box or case.     Johano = John.                     strato = street.     kasxi = to hide, to conceal.       si = himself, etc. (40).                                  READING LESSON.    1. Johano kaj Alfredo amuzis sin en la gxardeno. 2. Johano kasxis sin,  kaj Alfredo trovis Johanon. 3. Alfredo sin kasxis en alta arbo, kaj  Johano trovis Alberton. 4.

En la skatolo estis  libro, kaj Johano diris al si \"La libro ne apartenas al mi.\" 13. Li  diris al Alfredo \"Cxar ni trovis gxin, mi volas legi la libron.\" 14.  Virino antaux pordo komencis rigardi la knabojn, kaj ili diris al sxi  \"Cxu la libro apartenas al vi? Ni trovis gxin en skatolo.\" 15.

LIMITATION OF THE THIRD PERSONAL PRONOUN.    42. Since there is a special reflexive pronoun of the third person, the  third personal pronouns, \"li\", \"sxi\", \"gxi\", \"ili\", when used otherwise  than as subjects, never refer to the subject of the verb, but always to  some other person or thing:       La knabo lauxdas lin, the boy praises him (another person).     Sxi donas pomojn al sxi, she gives apples to her (to another person).     La birdo vidis gxin, the bird saw it (something else than the bird).     La knaboj kasxis ilin, the boys hid them (other persons or things).     Ili trovis ilin apud si,        they found them (other persons or things) near them(selves).     La birdoj flugis al ili, the birds flew to them.                               POSSESSIVE ADJECTIVES.    43. Words like \"my,\" \"his,\" \"your,\" which indicate ownership or some  possessive relation, are called \"possessive adjectives\". Possessive  adjectives are formed from the personal pronouns by adding the adjective  ending \"-a\", as \"mia\", my, \"via\", your (\"cia\", thy), \"lia\", his, \"sxia\",  her, \"gxia\", its, \"nia\", our, \"via\", your (plural), \"ilia\", their. The  limitation in the use of the third personal pronouns (\"42\") is also true  of the adjectives derived from them:       Mia domo kaj miaj gxardenoj estas grandaj,        my house and my gardens are large.     Johano sidas sur via segxo, John is sitting in your chair.     Li havas lian cxevalon, he has his (another person's) horse.     Cxu vi legis sxiajn librojn? Did you read her books?    [Footnote: Sometimes these words are called possessive pronouns,  although really they are not pronouns at all, but pronominal adjectives  with a possessive meaning.]    44. Reflexive possessive adjectives, like the reflexive pronoun, refer  to the subject of the verb in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/779"],[0,"The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (#6)"],[1," When Faustus had with pleasure ta'en the view       Of rarest things, and royal courts of kings,       He stay'd his course, and so returned home;       Where such as bear his absence but with grief,       I mean his friends and near'st companions,       Did gratulate his safety with kind words,       And in their conference of what befell,       Touching his journey through the world and air,       They put forth questions of astrology,       Which Faustus answer'd with such learned skill       As they admir'd and wonder'd at his wit.       Now is his fame spread forth in every land:       Amongst the rest the Emperor is one,       Carolus the Fifth, at whose palace now       Faustus is feasted 'mongst his noblemen.       What there he did, in trial of his art,       I leave untold; your eyes shall see['t] perform'd.            [Exit.]              Enter ROBIN[123] the Ostler, with a book in his hand.         ROBIN. O, this is admirable! here I ha' stolen one of Doctor       Faustus' conjuring-books, and, i'faith, I mean to search some       circles for my own use.  Now will I make all the maidens in our       parish dance at my pleasure, stark naked, before me; and so       by that means I shall see more than e'er I felt or saw yet.              Enter RALPH, calling ROBIN.         RALPH. Robin, prithee, come away; there's a gentleman tarries       to have his horse, and he would have his things rubbed and made       clean:  he keeps such a chafing with my mistress about it; and       she has sent me to look thee out; prithee, come away.         ROBIN. Keep out, keep out, or else you are blown up, you are       dismembered, Ralph:  keep out, for I am about a roaring piece       of work.         RALPH. Come, what doest thou with that same book? thou canst       not read?         ROBIN. Yes, my master and mistress shall find that I can read,       he for his forehead, she for her private study; she's born to       bear with me, or else my art fails.         RALPH. Why, Robin, what book is that?         ROBIN. What book! why, the most intolerable book for conjuring       that e'er was invented by any brimstone devil.         RALPH. Canst thou conjure with it?         ROBIN. I can do all these things easily with it; first, I can       make thee drunk with ippocras[124] at any tabern[125] in Europe       for nothing; that's one of my conjuring works.         RALPH. Our Master Parson says that's nothing.         ROBIN. True, Ralph:  and more, Ralph, if thou hast any mind to       Nan Spit, our kitchen-maid, then turn her and wind her to thy own       use, as often as thou wilt, and at midnight.         RALPH. O, brave, Robin! shall I have Nan Spit, and to mine own       use?  On that condition I'll feed thy devil with horse-bread as       long as he lives, of free cost.         ROBIN. No more, sweet Ralph:  let's go and make clean our boots,       which lie foul upon our hands, and then to our conjuring in the       devil's name.            [Exeunt.]              Enter ROBIN and RALPH[126] with a silver goblet.         ROBIN. Come, Ralph:  did not I tell thee, we were for ever made       by this Doctor Faustus' book? ecce, signum! here's a simple       purchase[127] for horse-keepers:  our horses shall eat no hay as       long as this lasts.         RALPH. But, Robin, here comes the Vintner.         ROBIN. Hush!  I'll gull him supernaturally.              Enter VINTNER.         Drawer,[128] I hope all is paid; God be with you!--Come, Ralph.         VINTNER. Soft, sir; a word with you.  I must yet have a goblet paid       from you, ere you go.         ROBIN. I a goblet, Ralph, I a goblet!--I scorn you; and you are       but a, &c.  I a goblet! search me.         VINTNER. I mean so, sir, with your favour.            [Searches ROBIN.]         ROBIN. How say you now?         VINTNER. I must say somewhat to your fellow.--You, sir!         RALPH. Me, sir! me, sir! search your fill.  [VINTNER searches him.]       Now, sir, you may be ashamed to burden honest men with a matter       of truth.         VINTNER. Well, tone[129] of you hath this goblet about you.         ROBIN. You lie, drawer, 'tis afore me [Aside].--Sirrah you, I'll       teach you to impeach honest men;--stand by;--I'll scour you for       a goblet;--stand aside you had best, I charge you in the name of       Belzebub.--Look to the goblet, Ralph [Aside to RALPH].         VINTNER. What mean you, sirrah?         ROBIN. I'll tell you what I mean.

Peccatum peccatorum!--Here's thy goblet, good Vintner.            [Gives the goblet to VINTNER, who exit.]         ROBIN. Misericordia pro nobis! what shall I do?

Monarch of Hell,[130] under whose black survey       Great potentates do kneel with awful fear,       Upon whose altars thousand souls do lie,       How am I vexed with these villains' charms?       From Constantinople am I hither come,       Only for pleasure of these damned slaves.         ROBIN. How, from Constantinople! you have had a great journey:       will you take sixpence in your purse to pay for your supper, and       be gone?         MEPHIST. Well, villains, for your presumption, I transform thee       into an ape, and thee into a dog; and so be gone!            [Exit.]         ROBIN. How, into an ape! that's brave:  I'll have fine sport with       the boys; I'll get nuts and apples enow.         RALPH. And I must be a dog.         ROBIN. I'faith, thy head will never be out of the pottage-pot.            [Exeunt.]              Enter EMPEROR,[131] FAUSTUS, and a KNIGHT, with ATTENDANTS.         EMPEROR. Master Doctor Faustus,[132] I have heard strange report       of thy knowledge in the black art, how that none in my empire       nor in the whole world can compare with thee for the rare effects       of magic:  they say thou hast a familiar spirit, by whom thou canst       accomplish what thou list.  This, therefore, is my request, that       thou let me see some proof of thy skill, that mine eyes may be       witnesses to confirm what mine ears have heard reported:  and here       I swear to thee, by the honour of mine imperial crown, that,       whatever thou doest, thou shalt be no ways prejudiced or endamaged.         KNIGHT. I'faith, he looks much like a conjurer.            [Aside.]         FAUSTUS. My gracious sovereign, though I must confess myself far       inferior to the report men have published, and nothing answerable       to the honour of your imperial majesty, yet, for that love and duty       binds me thereunto, I am content to do whatsoever your majesty       shall command me.         EMPEROR. Then, Doctor Faustus, mark what I shall say.       As I was sometime solitary set       Within my closet, sundry thoughts arose       About the honour of mine ancestors,       How they had won[133] by prowess such exploits,       Got such riches, subdu'd so many kingdoms,       As we that do succeed,[134] or they that shall       Hereafter possess our throne, shall       (I fear me) ne'er attain to that degree       Of high renown and great authority:       Amongst which kings is Alexander the Great,       Chief spectacle of the world's pre-eminence,       The bright[135] shining of whose glorious acts       Lightens the world with his reflecting beams,       As when I hear but motion made of him,       It grieves my soul I never saw the man:       If, therefore, thou, by cunning of thine art,       Canst raise this man from hollow vaults below,       Where lies entomb'd this famous conqueror,       And bring with him his beauteous paramour,       Both in their right shapes, gesture, and attire       They us'd to wear during their time of life,       Thou shalt both satisfy my just desire,       And give me cause to praise thee whilst I live.         FAUSTUS. My gracious lord, I am ready to accomplish your request,       so far forth as by art and power of my spirit I am able to perform.         KNIGHT. I'faith, that's just nothing at all.            [Aside.]         FAUSTUS. But, if it like your grace, it is not in my ability[136]       to present before your eyes the true substantial bodies of those       two deceased princes, which long since are consumed to dust.         KNIGHT. Ay, marry, Master Doctor, now there's a sign of grace in       you, when you will confess the truth.            [Aside.]         FAUSTUS. But such spirits as can lively resemble Alexander and       his paramour shall appear before your grace, in that manner that       they both[137] lived in, in their most flourishing estate; which       I doubt not shall sufficiently content your imperial majesty.         EMPEROR. Go to, Master Doctor; let me see them presently.         KNIGHT. Do you hear, Master Doctor? you bring Alexander and his       paramour before the Emperor!         FAUSTUS. How then, sir?         KNIGHT. I'faith, that's as true as Diana turned me to a stag.         FAUSTUS. No, sir; but, when Actaeon died, he left the horns for       you.--Mephistophilis, be gone.            [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.]         KNIGHT. Nay, an you go to conjuring, I'll be gone.            [Exit.]         FAUSTUS. I'll meet with you anon for interrupting me so.       --Here they are, my gracious lord.              Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with SPIRITS in the shapes of ALEXANDER            and his PARAMOUR.         EMPEROR.
