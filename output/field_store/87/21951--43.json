Last of all he  flooded the place once more and gave a costly public banquet. The person  who had been appointed director of the banquet was Tigillinus, and a large  and complete equipment had been furnished. The arrangements made were as  follows. In the center and resting on the water were placed the great  wooden wine vessels, over which boards had been fastened. Round about it  had been built taverns and booths. Thus Nero and Tigillinus and their  fellow-banqueters, being in the center, held their feast on purple carpets  and soft mattresses, while all the other people caroused in the taverns.  These also entered the brothels, where unrestrictedly they might enjoy  absolutely any woman to be found there. Now the latter were some of the  most beautiful and distinguished in the city, both slaves and free, some  hetaerae, some virgins, some wives,--not merely, that is to say, public  wenches, but both girls and women of the very noblest families. Every man  was given authority to have whichever one he wished, for the women were  not allowed to refuse any one. Consequently, the multitude being a regular  rabble, they drank greedily and reveled in wanton conduct. So a slave  debauched his mistress in the presence of his master and a gladiator  ravished a girl of noble family while her father looked on. The shoving  and striking and uproar that went on, first on the part of those who were  going in and second on the part of those who stood around outside, was  disgraceful. Many men met their death in these encounters, and of the  women some were strangled and some were seized and carried off.    [Sidenote:--16--] After this Nero had the wish (or rather it had always  been a fixed purpose of his) to make an end of the whole city and  sovereignty during his lifetime. Priam he deemed wonderfully happy in that  he had seen his country perish at the same moment as his authority.  Accordingly he sent in different directions men feigning to be drunk or  engaged in some indifferent species of rascality and at first had one or  two or more blazes quietly kindled in different quarters: people, of  course, fell into the utmost confusion, not being able to find any  beginning of the trouble nor to put any end to it, and meanwhile they  became aware of many strange sights and sounds. For soon there was nothing  to be observed but many fires as in a camp, and no other phrases fell from  men's lips but \"This or that is burning \"; \"Where?\"; \"How?\"; \"Who set  it?\"; \"To the rescue!\" An extraordinary perturbation laid hold on all  wherever they might be, and they ran about as if distracted, some in one  direction and some in another. Some men in the midst of assisting their  neighbors would learn that their own premises were on fire. Others  received the first intimation of their own possessions being aflame when  informed that they were destroyed. Persons would run from their houses  into the lanes with some idea of being of assistance from the outside, or  again they would dash into the dwellings from the streets, appearing to  think they could accomplish something inside. The shouting and screaming  of children, women, men, and graybeards all together were incessant, so  that one could have no consciousness nor comprehension of anything by  reason of the smoke and shouting combined. On this account some might be  seen standing speechless, as if dumb. All this time many who were carrying  out their goods and many more who were stealing what belonged to others  kept encountering one another and falling over the merchandise. It was not  possible to get anywhere, nor yet to stand still; but people pushed and  were pushed back, they upset others and were themselves upset, many were  suffocated, many were crushed: in fine, no evil that can possibly happen  to men at such a crisis failed to befall them. They could not with ease  find even any avenue of escape, and, if any one did save himself from some  immediate danger, he usually fell into another one and was lost.    [Sidenote:--17--] This did not all take place on one day, but lasted for  several days and nights together. Many houses were destroyed through lack  of some one to defend them and many were set on fire in still more places  by persons who presumably came to the rescue. For the soldiers (including  the night watch), having an eye upon plunder, instead of extinguishing any  blaze kindled greater conflagrations. While similar scenes were being  enacted at various points a sudden wind caught the fire and swept it over  whatever remained. Consequently no one concerned himself any longer about  goods or houses, but all the survivors, standing in a place of safety,  gazed upon what seemed to be many islands and cities burning. There was no  longer any grief over individual losses, for it was swallowed up in the  public lamentation, as men reminded one another how once before most of  their city had been similarly laid waste by the Gauls. [Sidenote:--18--]  While the whole population was in this state of mind and many crazed by  the disaster were leaping into the blaze itself, Nero mounted to the roof  of the palace, where nearly the whole conflagration could be taken in by a  sweeping glance, and having assumed the lyrist's garb he sang the Taking  (as he said) of Ilium, which, to the ordinary vision, however, appeared to  be the Taking of Rome.    The calamity which the city at this time experienced has no parallel  before or since, except in the Gallic invasion. The whole Palatine hill,  the theatre of Taurus, and nearly two-thirds of the remainder of the city  were burned and countless human beings perished. The populace invoked  curses upon Nero without intermission, not uttering his name but simply  cursing those who had set the city on fire: and this was especially the  case because they were disturbed by the memory of the oracle chanted in  Tiberius's day. These were the words:--      \"Thrice three hundred cycles of tireless years being ended, Civil strife    shall the Romans destroy.\" [Footnote: Compare Book Fifty-seven, chapter    18.]    And when Nero by way of encouraging them reported that these verses were  nowhere to be found, they changed and went to repeating another oracle,  which they averred to be a genuine Sibylline production, namely:--      \"Last of the sons of Aeneas a matricide shall govern.\"    And so it proved, whether this was actually revealed beforehand by some  divination or whether the populace now for the first time gave it the form  of a divine saying adapted to existing circumstances. For Nero was indeed  the last emperor of the Julian line descended from Aeneas.    He now began to collect vast sums from both individuals and nations,  sometimes using compulsion, with the conflagration for his excuse, and  sometimes obtaining it by \"voluntary\" offers; and the mass of the Romans  had the food supply fund withdrawn.    [Sidenote:--19--] While he was so engaged, he received news from Armenia  and soon after a laurel wreath in honor of victory. The scattered bodies  of soldiery in that region had been united by Corbulo, who trained them  sedulously after a period of neglect, and then by the very report of his  coming had terrified both Vologaesus, king of Parthia, and Tiridates,  chief of Armenia. He resembled the primitive Romans in that besides coming  of a brilliant family and besides possessing much strength of body he was  still further gifted with a shrewd intelligence: and he behaved with great  bravery, with great fairness, and with great good faith toward all, both  friends and enemies. For these reasons Nero had despatched him to the  scene of war in his own stead and had entrusted to him a larger force than  to anybody else, being equally assured that the man would subdue the  barbarians and would not revolt against him. And Corbulo proved neither of  these assumptions false.    All other men, however, had it as a particular grievance against him that  he kept faith with Nero. They were very anxious to get him as emperor in  place of the actual despot, and this conduct of his seemed to them his  only defect.    [Sidenote:--20--] Corbulo, accordingly, had taken Artaxata without a  struggle and had razed the city to the ground. This exploit finished, he  marched in the direction of Tigranocerta, sparing all the districts that  yielded themselves but devastating the lands of all such as resisted him.  Tigranocerta submitted to him voluntarily, and he performed other  brilliant and glorious deeds, as a result of which he induced the  formidable Vologaesus to accept terms that accorded with the Roman  reputation. [For Vologaesus, on hearing that Nero had assigned Armenia to  others and that Adiabene was being ravaged by Tigranes, made preparations  himself to go on a campaign into Syria against Corbulo, but sent into  Armenia Monobazus, king of Adiabene, and Monaeses, a Parthian. These two  had shut up Tigranes in Tigranocerta. But since they did not succeed in  harming him at all by their siege and as often as they tried conclusions  with him were repulsed by both the native troops and the Romans that were  in his army, and since Corbulo guarded Syria with extreme care, Vologaesus  recognized the hopelessness of his attempt and disbanded his forces. Then  he sent to Corbulo and obtained peace on condition that he send a new  embassy to Nero, raise the siege, and withdraw his soldiers from Armenia.  Nero made him no immediate nor speedy nor definite reply, but despatched  Lucius Caesennius Paetus to Cappadocia to see to it that there should be  no Armenian uprising.]    [Sidenote:--21--] [So Vologaesus attacked Tigranocerta and drove back  Paetus, who had come to its aid. When the latter fled he pursued him, beat  back the garrison left by Paetus at the Taurus, and shut him up in  Rhandea, near the river Arsanias. Then he was on the point of retiring  without accomplishing anything; for destitute "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10891"],[0,"Algonquin Indian Tales (#7)"],[1," remained. By the  time they reached home both pain and tears were well-nigh forgotten.    That evening before the children were sent to bed they overheard Jakoos,  who had come to the house with venison to sell, telling in the kitchen a  story that he had heard from Souwanas about a naughty fellow, called  Maheigan, who tried to capture a beautiful kind-hearted maiden, Waubenoo,  and of how Nanahboozhoo thrashed him, and then afterward, because of some  naughty children not holding their tongues, Waubenoo was turned into the  Whisky Jack.    What the little children overheard had very much excited their curiosity,  and so when Mary was putting them to bed they demanded from her the full  story.    As this was one of the Saulteaux Indian legends, while Mary was a Cree, she  was not familiar with it. She told the children that she knew nothing about  it, but this by no means set their curiosity at rest.          CHAPTER IV.      The Love Story of Wakontas--His Test of the Two  Maidens--His Choice--The Transformation of Misticoosis.    A few days later Mary was annoyed by having the children tell her frankly  that they did not think she was a first-class story-teller. For if she had  been she ought to have been able to answer Minnehaha's question about what  Nanahboozhoo did to Maheigan when he tried to catch Waubenoo.    Mary was vexed at herself that she was unable to answer the question, for  she well knew that the children would not rest satisfied until they had the  story told them by some one, possibly Souwanas himself. Indeed, knowing  them so well, she had fully resolved to post herself from one of the noted  story-tellers who have all the Indian legends at their tongue tips. But as  yet she was ignorant in this matter, and therefore fell considerably in the  children's estimation. Alary was somewhat hurt by noticing, perhaps for the  first time, Sagastao and Minnehaha whispering confidentially to each other.  The children conversed with Mary only in her own language, which at that  time they perhaps understood better than they did English. Now, much to  Mary's annoyance, their confidential whisperings were carried on in  English. Being sensitive and quick-tempered, when she saw this sudden break  in their affections toward her she was inclined to resent it, and asked the  reason why she was not allowed to know what they were talking about.    Blunt little Sagastao spoke up at once:    \"Minnehaha and I have talked it over, and have decided that unless you tell  us better stories, and ones which you know all about, we're going to run  away to the wigwam of Souwanas.\"    This was humiliating and distressing news. Mary fancied she had told them a  good story, and that with a few others like it she could satisfy their  curiosity and keep them at home until the brief summer would have passed.  Not so, however, thought the children. They saw their advantage and were  resolved to keep it, and when their lessons were over and they were left  entirely in the charge of Mary they taxed the little woman in a way that  obliged her to exercise all her gifts as a story-teller, and she was far  from being a poor one.    One day she took them out in a graceful birch canoe among the picturesque  islands. They landed on one of these islands, and spent some time in  exploring its beauties and resting where grew a profusion of the fragrant  Indian grass. They were for a time much interested in the various wild  birds that then were so numerous and fearless. Beautiful gulls of  different varieties were there nesting, and by following Mary's directions  the children were delighted to find that they could approach very near to  the nests of some of them without disturbing the mother bird while her  mate, in fearless confidence, stood on guard beside her.    [Illustration: The startling placard.]    [Illustration: While her mate stood beside her.]    \"Now, Mary, hurrah for a story!\" cried the children, as they sat at lunch.    While Mary was wondering what she would tell them, Minnehaha, with all the  restless, inquisitive spirit of childhood, noticing the ceaseless rustling  movements of the leaves in the stately northern poplar while the leaves of  all the other trees were so still, said:    \"Why is it, Mary, that even while the leaves on the other trees are so  quiet those almost round ones are ever stirring?\"    Mary knew the Indian legend, and at once proceeded to narrate it.    \"It is believed by our people,\" said Mary, \"that there are other persons  just as clever as Nanahboozhoo, and as able to do wonderful things, but  they are very seldom heard of. Some of them were the children of Wakonda,  the powerful spirit who dwelt in the region of Spirit Lake, where they say  it is always sunshine. Many strange things have been told about them, but  everybody says they are kind-hearted, and never did anything to injure any  of our people unless it was well deserved. The story is that long ago one  of these sons of Wakonda, whose name was Wakontas, could not find a wife  to suit him in his own beautiful country, and so he came to the regions  where the Indians dwelt.    \"For a long time he wandered throughout great regions of country before he  found anyone who interested him. However, in his journeyings Wakontas went  into the wigwam of some Indians where there were two lovely maidens, so  very beautiful that he fell in love with both of them. He was in the  disguise of a very fine-looking young hunter. So clever was he in the use  of his bow and arrow that at the end of every hunting excursion he returned  laden with the richest spoils of the chase. He fell more and more in love  with the two girls, and knowing, of course, that he could only get one of  them he found a great difficulty in making his choice. He had already gone  to the girl's father, and after finding out from him the price demanded for  his daughter, without mentioning which one, very quickly by his magic  powers he obtained the heavy price and laid it at the father's feet. Both  of the girls seemed equally pleased with him, and each one secretly hoped  that she might be the object of his choice. Still he hesitated, and  although he tried many experiments yet they so nearly equaled each other in  cleverness and beauty that he was still undecided. However, there was a  great difference in their dispositions. While one was proud and jealous,  and had a very bitter tongue, the other was just the opposite; while one  was very selfish, the other was generous and kind-hearted. But Wakontas was  not able to find this out at first, and after he had considered various  plans he decided that he would put on one of his many disguises and thus  try them.    \"So he started off as though going on a hunting expedition, but soon after  he was out of sight he quickly assumed the form of a poor and aged Indian,  and came to the home of these two beautiful sisters, and asked for  assistance. Wakontas chose a time when he knew the rest of the family were  away from the wigwam, in order that he might see how the two sisters would  act toward him.    \"When he walked into the wigwam, for nobody ever knocks at an Indian tent,  the maidens were a little startled at thus suddenly seeing this  rough-looking old beggar-man in their midst. The selfish, proud girl, whose  name was Misticoosis, at once began assailing him, and cried, 'Auwasta  kena!' (Get out; go away, you!)    \"In vain he pleaded that he was aged and hungry. She would not listen to  him.    \"Omemee, the other young Indian maiden, who had not said a word, but had  been pitying him from the first moment she saw how feeble and sad he  looked, now interfered, and remonstrated with her sister, whose tongue kept  up a constant stream of abuse. Taking the old man to her side of the wigwam  she seated him on a rug of deerskins and then built up before him a bright  fire. Then she quickly brought in venison, cooked it nicely, and gave him  the broth for drink and the meat for food. He thanked her gratefully, but  she checked his words and said that her greatest joy was in making others  happy. Not satisfied with what she had done, and noticing that his shoes  were old and worn, she took out of her beaded workbag a pair of splendidly  worked moccasins, and put them on his feet.    \"All this time, while this good-hearted, generous Omemee was treating the  poor old man so kindly, the proud, selfish Misticoosis was talking as hard  and as fast as she could against such deeds of kindness to all old people.  In her opinion, when they had got so old and helpless as that old fellow  was, they ought to be killed by their relatives.    \"The old man again expressed his thanks to the kind sister, and then went  his way.    \"Soon the girls began to think of arraying themselves for the return of  their friend and lover. The proud, selfish Misticoosis spent all the time  in fixing herself up in the most elaborate manner. She had lately become  quite jealous of her sister, and she was resolved to so outshine her in  appearance that the handsome young hunter would surely prefer her. But  Omemee (a name which means a dove) thought to herself:    \"'My father and mother and the rest of the family will soon be returning to  the wigwam, tired and hungry, and the best thing I can do will be to have a  good dinner ready for them all.' So, only taking time to comb and brush her  luxuriant hair and make herself neat and tidy for her work, she set about  cooking the meal. She skillfully prepared venison and bear's meat, and the  finest of fish.    \"Hardly had she finished her work and seen everything nicely cooked before  she heard the happy shoutings of her younger brothers, and the sweet  birdcalls of her little sisters.    \"As Omemee and her sister Misticoosis hurried out to greet them they were  surprised to see the handsome stranger gliding along in his beautiful canoe  alongside of the larger one of the family. Of course, the sight of their  lover"]]]
