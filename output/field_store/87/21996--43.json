[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11718"],[0,"The Camp Fire Girls at School; Or, The Wohelo Weavers (#7)"],[1," fire boats, tugs, scows, and all the  other kinds of vessels that crowd the river-harbor of a great lake port.  Viewed from below, the steel structure of the viaduct over the river  stretched out like the monstrous skeleton of some prehistoric beast.  Whistles shrieked deafeningly in their ears and trains pounded jarringly  over railroad bridges. A jack-knife bridge began to descend over their  very heads. Over where the new bridge was being constructed men stood on  slender girders high in the air, catching red-hot rivets that were being  tossed them, while an automatic riveting hammer filled the air with its  nerve-destroying clamor. Everywhere was bustle and confusion, and noise,  noise, noise.    And in the midst of this tumult the tiny launch, filled with laughing  girls, threaded its way up the black river, flying the Winnebago banner,  while behind it trailed a birchbark canoe, with Sahwah squatting calmly  in the stern, leaning her back against her paddle. Many times they had  to bury their noses in their handkerchiefs to shut out the smells that  assailed them on every side. On they chugged, past the lumber yards with  their acres of stacked boards, some of which had come from the very  neighborhood of Camp Winnebago; past the chemical works, pouring out its  darkly polluted streams into the river. \"Ugh,\" said Gladys with a  shiver, \"to think that that stuff flows on into the lake and we drink  lake water!\"    \"It seems like a different world altogether,\" said Migwan, looking out  across the miles of factory-covered \"flats.\" She was perfectly  fascinated by the rolling mills, with their rows of black stacks  standing out against the sky like organ pipes, and by the long trains of  oil-tank cars curving through the valley like huge worms, the divisions  giving the effect of body sections.    While the Winnebagos were gliding along among scenes strange and new,  Hinpoha was vainly trying to comfort herself for having to stay at home  by catching in a bottle the bees which were crawling in and out of the  cosmos blossoms in the garden. Interesting as the bees were, however,  they could not keep her thoughts from turning to the Winnebagos afloat  on the river, and it was a very doleful face that bent over the flowers.  Her dismal reflections were interrupted by the sharp voice of Aunt  Phoebe calling her to come in. \"What is it?\" she asked listlessly, as  she came up on the porch.    \"Mrs. Evans is here,\" said her aunt in the doorway, \"and she has asked  to see you.\" Hinpoha was very glad to see Mrs. Evans, who rose smilingly  and took her hands in hers.    \"How thin you are getting, child!\" she exclaimed, smoothing back the red  curls. \"I don't believe you get out enough. By the way,\" she said to  Aunt Phoebe, \"may I borrow this girl for to-day? I have considerable  driving about to do and it is rather tiresome going alone. Gladys has  gone on an all-day boat ride.\"    Aunt Phoebe could not very well refuse, for driving about in a machine  with an older woman was a very proper form of recreation indeed, in her  estimation.    Hinpoha flew upstairs and deposited her bottle of bees on the table in  her room for future observation and started off with Mrs. Evans. \"We  will not be back for lunch, and possibly not for supper,\" said Gladys's  mother as she bade Aunt Phoebe a gracious good-bye, \"but it will not be  long after that.\"    \"And now for a grand spin,\" she said, as she started the car and sent it  crackling through the dry leaves on the pavement.    \"Now I see why the Indians named this river 'Cuyahoga,' or 'Crooked,'\"  said Migwan, as they rounded bend after bend in the stream. \"It coils  back on itself like a snake, and I have already counted seven coils  within the city limits. I didn't believe it when the captain of a  freighter told me that there was a place in the river which his boat  couldn't pass because two sharp turns came so near together, but now I  see how that could easily be possible.\"    As the launch putt-putt-putt-ed steadily up the river the water  gradually became less black, and the factories along the shore gave way  to open stretches of country. By noon they reached the dam and went  ashore to look for a place to build a fire. They were in a deep gorge,  its steep sides thickly covered with flaming maples and oaks, and  brilliant sumachs, stretching on either side as far as they could reach.  \"It's too gorgeous to seem real,\" said Nyoda, shading her eyes and  looking down the valley; \"where _does_ Mother Nature keep her pot of  'Diamond Dyes' in the summer time?\"    High up along the top of one of the cliffs a narrow road wound along,  and as Nyoda stood looking into the distance she saw an automobile  coming along this road. When it was directly above her it stopped and  two people got out, a woman and a girl. The sunlight fell on a mass of  red curls on the girl's head. \"Hinpoha!\" exclaimed Nyoda in amazement.  From above came floating down a far-echoing yodel--the familiar  Winnebago call. The girls all looked up in surprise to see Hinpoha  scrambling down the face of the cliff, and aiding Mrs. Evans to descend.    \"Why, _mother_!\" called Gladys, running up to meet her.    The surprise at the meeting was mutual. Mrs. Evans, spinning along the  country roads, had no idea she was hard on the trail of her daughter and  the other Winnebagos until she came suddenly upon them after they had  gotten out of the launch. \"Can't you stay and spend the day with us, now  that you're here?\" they pleaded.    Hinpoha's longing soul looked out of her eyes, but she answered, \"I'm  afraid not. Aunt Phoebe wouldn't approve.\"    \"Did she say you couldn't?\" asked Sahwah.    \"No,\" said Hinpoha, \"for I never even asked her if I might go along with  you in the launch. I knew it would be no use.\"    \"Oh, please stay,\" tempted some of the girls; \"your aunt'll never know  the difference.\"    \"Oh, I couldn't do that,\" said Hinpoha in a tone of horror. A little  approving smile crept around the corners of Nyoda's eyes as she heard  Hinpoha so resolutely bidding Satan get behind her. Mrs. Evans was  genuinely sorry they had encountered the girls, because it made it so  much harder for Hinpoha.    \"I wonder,\" she said musingly, \"if I drove on to a house in the road and  telephoned your aunt that she would let you stay?\"    \"You might try,\" said Hinpoha doubtfully. Mrs. Evans thought it was  worth trying. She found a house with a telephone and got Aunt Phoebe on  the wire. With the utmost tact she explained how they had met the girls  accidently, and that she had taken a notion that she would like to spend  the day with them, but of course she could not do so unless Hinpoha  would be allowed to stay with her, as she had charge of her for the day.  What was Aunt Phoebe to do? She was not equal to telling the admired  Mrs. Evans to forego her pleasure because of Hinpoha, and gave a  grudging consent to her keeping her niece with her on the condition that  she would bring her home in the machine and not let her come back in the  launch with the Winnebagos. Jubilant, they returned to the girls in the  gorge and told the good news.    \"Cheer for Mrs. Evans,\" cried Sahwah, and the Winnebagos gave it with a  hearty good will.    Hinpoha, with Sahwah close beside her, began I searching for firewood  industriously. \"It seems just like last summer,\" she said, chopping  sticks with Sahwah's hatchet. The two had wandered off a short distance  from the others, following a tiny footpath. Suddenly they came upon a  huge rock formation, that looked like an immense fireplace, about forty  feet wide and twenty or more feet high. Under that great stone arch a  dozen spits, each big enough to hold a whole ox, might easily have  swung. Sahwah and Hinpoha looked at it in amazement and then called for  the other girls to come and see.    \"Why, that's the 'Old Maid's Kitchen,'\" said Mrs. Evans, when she  arrived on the scene. \"I've been here before. Just why it should be  called the _Old Maid's_ Kitchen is more than I can tell, for it looks  like the fireplace belonging to the grand-mother of all giantesses.\"    \"Let's build our fire inside of it,\" said Nyoda.    \"The original 'Old Maid' had a convenience that didn't usually go with  open fireplaces,\" said Gladys, \"and that is running water,\" and she held  her cup under a tiny stream that trickled out between two rocks, cold as  ice and clear as crystal.    \"Wouldn't this be a grand place for a Ceremonial Meeting?\" said Migwan,  as they all stood round the blazing fire roasting \"wieners\" and bacon.  The Kitchen had a floor of smooth slabs of rock, and the arch of the  fireplace formed a roof over their heads, while its wide opening  afforded them a wonderful view of the gorge.    \"Whenever you want to come here again, just say so,\" said Mrs. Evans,  \"and I'll bring you down in the machine.\" Mrs. Evans was enjoying  herself as much as any of the girls. It was the first time she had ever  cooked wieners and bacon over an open fire on green sticks, and she was  perfectly delighted with the experience. \"If my husband could only see  me now,\" she said, laughing like a girl as she dropped her last wiener  in the dirt and calmly washed it off in the trickling stream. \"How good  this hot cocoa tastes!\" she exclaimed, drinking down a whole cupful  without stopping. \"What kind is it?\"    \"Camp Fire Girl Cocoa,\" answered the girls.    \"What kind is that?\" asked Mrs. Evans.    \"It is a brand that is put up by a New York firm for the Camp Fire Girls  to sell,\" answered Nyoda.    \"Why have we never had any of this at our house?\" asked Mrs. Evans,  turning to Gladys.    \"You have always insisted that you would use no other kind than Van  Horn's,\" replied Gladys, \"so I thought there would be no use in  mentioning it.\"    \"I like this better than Van Horn's,\" said her mother. \"Is there any to  be had now?\"    \"There certainly is,\" answered Nyoda. \"We are trying to dispose of a  hundred-can lot "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11734"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 460, October 25, 1884 (#7)"],[1,"seem from  the foregoing remarks that in any existing safety-lamp where one  qualification is increased another is proportionately reduced; so it is  doubtful whether all the necessary requirements of sensitiveness,  resistance to strong currents, satisfactory light, self-extinction, perfect  combustion, etc., can ever be combined in one lamp.\"    The nearest approach to Mr. Garforth's invention which we have ever heard  of is that of a workman at a colliery in the north of England, who, more  than twenty years ago, to avoid the trouble of getting to the highest part  of the roof, used a kind of air pump, seven or eight feet long, to extract  the gas from the breaks; and some five years ago Mr. Jones, of Ebbw Vale,  had a similar idea. It appears that these appliances were so cumbersome,  besides requiring too great length or height for most mines, and  necessitating the use of both hands, that they did not come into general  use. The ideas, however, are totally different, and the causes which have  most likely led to the invention of the ball and protected tube were  probably never thought of until recently; indeed, Mr. Garforth writes that  he has only learned about them since his paper was read before the Midland  Institute, and some weeks after his patent was taken out.    No one, says Mr. Garforth, in his paper read before the Midland Institute,  will, I presume, deny that the Davy is more sensitive than the tin shield  lamp, inasmuch as in the former the surrounding atmosphere or explosive  mixture has only one thickness of gauze to pass through, and that on a  level with the flame; while the latter has a number of small holes and two  or three thicknesses of gauze (according to the construction of the lamp),  which the gas must penetrate before it reaches the flame. Moreover, the tin  shield lamp, when inclined to one side, is extinguished (though not so  easily as the Mueseler); and as the inlet holes are 6 inches from the top,  it does not show a thin stratum of fire-damp near the roof as perceptibly  as the Davy, which admits of being put in almost a horizontal position.  Although the Davy lamp was, nearly fifty years ago, pronounced unsafe, by  reason of its inability to resist an ordinary velocity of eight feet per  second, yet it is still kept in use on account of its sensitiveness. Its  advocates maintain that a mine can be kept safer by using the Davy, which  detects small quantities of gas, and thereby shows the real state of the  mine, than by a lamp which, though able to resist a greater velocity, is  not so sensitive, and consequently is apt to deceive. Assuming the Davy  lamp to be condemned (as it has already been in Belgium and in some English  mines), the Stephenson and some of the more recently invented lamps  pronounced unsafe, then if greater shielding is recommended the question  is, what means have we for detecting small quantities of fire-damp?    It would seem from the foregoing remarks that in any existing safety-lamp,  where one qualification is increased another is proportionately reduced; so  it is doubtful whether all the necessary requirements of sensitiveness,  resistance to strong currents, satisfactory light, self-extinction, perfect  combustion, etc., can ever be combined in one lamp. The object of the  present paper is to show that with the assistance of the fire-damp  detecter, the tin shield, or any other description of lamp, is made as  sensitive as the Davy, while its other advantages of resisting velocity,  etc., are not in any way interfered with. As a proof of this I may mention  that a deputy of experience recently visited a working place to make his  inspection. He reported the stall to be free from gas, but when the manager  and steward visited it with the detecter, which they applied to the roof  (where it would have been difficult to put even a small Davy), it drew a  sample of the atmosphere which, on being put to the test tube in the  tin-shield lamp, at once showed the presence of fire-damp. Out of  twenty-eight tests in a mine working a long-wall face the Davy showed gas  only eleven times, while the detecter showed it in every case. The  detecter, as will be perceived from the one exhibited, and the accompanying  sectional drawing, consists simply of an oval-shaped India rubber ball,  fitted with a mouthpiece. The diameter is about 21/4 inches by 3 inches, its  weight is two ounces, and it is so small that it can be carried without any  inconvenience in the coat or even in the waistcoat pocket. Its capacity is  such that all the air within it may be expelled by the compression of one  hand.    The mouthpiece is made to fit a tube in the bottom of the lamp, and when  pressed against the India rubber ring on the ball-flange, a perfectly tight  joint is made, which prevents the admission of any external air. The tube  in the bottom of the lamp is carried within a short distance of the height  of the wick-holder. It is covered at the upper end with gauze, besides  being fitted with other thicknesses of gauze at certain distances within  the tube; and if it be found desirable to further protect the flame against  strong currents of air, a small valve may be placed at the inlet, as shown  in the drawing. This valve is made of sufficient weight to resist the force  of a strong current, and is only lifted from its seat by the pressure of  the hand on the mouthpiece. It will be apparent from the small size and  elasticity of the detecter that the test can easily be made with one hand,  and when the ball is allowed to expand a vacuum is formed within it, and a  sample of the atmosphere drawn from the breaks, cavities, or highest parts  of the roof, or, of course, any portion of the mine. When the sample is  forced through the tube near the flame, gas if present at once reveals  itself by the elongation of the flame in the usual way, at the same time  giving an additional proof by burning with a blue flame on the top of the  test tube. If gas is not present, the distinction is easily seen by the  flame keeping the same size, but burning with somewhat greater brightness,  owing to the increased quality of oxygen forced upon it.    I venture to claim for this method of detecting fire-damp among other  advantages: 1. The detecter, on account of its size, can be placed in a  break in the roof where an ordinary lamp--even a small Davy--could not be  put, and a purer sample of the suspected atmosphere is obtained than would  be the case even a few inches below the level of the roof, 2. The obtaining  and testing of a sample in the manner above described takes away the  possibility of an explosion, which might be the result if a lamp with a  defective gauze were placed in an explosive atmosphere. No one knows how  many explosions have not been caused by the fire-trier himself. This will  now be avoided. (Although lamps fitted with a tin shield will be subjected  to the same strict examination as hitherto, still they do not admit of the  same frequent inspection as those without shields, for in the latter case  each workman can examine his own lamp as an extra precaution; whereas the  examination of the tin shield lamps will rest entirely with the lamp man.)  3. The lamp can be kept in a pure atmosphere while the sample is obtained  by the detecter, and at a greater height than the flame in a safety-lamp  could be properly distinguished. The test can afterward be made in a safe  place, at some distance from the explosive atmosphere; and, owing to the  vacuum formed, the ball (without closing the mouthpiece) has been carried a  mile or more without the gas escaping. 4. The detecter supplies a better  knowledge of the condition of the working places, especially in breaks and  cavities in the roof; which latter, with the help of a nozzle and staff,  may be reached to a height of ten feet or more, by the detecter being  pressed against the roof and sides, or by the use of a special form of  detecter. 5. Being able at will to force the contents of the detecter on to  the flame, the effects of an explosion inside the lamp need not be feared.  (This danger being removed, admits, I think, of the glass cylinder being  made of a larger diameter, whereby a better light is obtained; it may also  be considered quite as strong, when used with the detecter, as a lamp with  a small diameter, when the latter is placed in an explosive atmosphere.) 6.  The use of the detecter will permit the further protection of the present  tin shield lamp, by an extra thickness of gauze, if such addition is found  advantageous in resisting an increased velocity. 7. In the Mueseler,  Stephenson, and other lamps, where the flame is surrounded by glass, there  is no means of using the wire for shot firing. The detecter tube, although  protected by two thicknesses of gauze, admits of this being done by the use  of a special form of valve turned by the mouthpiece of the detecter. The  system of firing shots or using open lamps in the same pit where safety  lamps are used is exceedingly objectionable; still, under certain  conditions shots may be fired without danger. Whether safety lamps or  candles are used, it is thought the use of the detecter will afford such a  ready means of testing that more examinations will be made before firing a  shot, thereby insuring greater safety. 8. In testing for gas with a safety  lamp there is a fear of the light being extinguished, when the lamp is  suddenly placed in a quantity of gas, or in endeavoring to get a very  small light; this is especially the case with some kinds of lamps. With the  detecter this is avoided, as a large flame can be used, which is considered  by some a preferable means of testing for small quantities; and the test  can be made without risk. Where gas is present in large quantities, the  blue flame at the end of the test tube will be found a further proof. This  latter result is produced by the slightest compression of the ball.
