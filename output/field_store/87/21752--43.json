Her position physically and  sentimentally was awkward; the doctor called the nurse and left her.  Later he returned and did his best to appeal to her womanhood; he  analyzed her illness and showed her some of the damage it had wrought  both in her character and to others. He showed her the demoralization  which had grown out of her wretched surrender to impulsive desire. He  revealed to her the necessity for the effacement of much of her false  self and the true spiritualizing of her mind as the only road to  wholesome living. That same day Dr. Platt received a telegram  peremptorily demanding that he come for her. Upon his arrival he had a  short talk with the specialist who succinctly told him the problem as  he saw it. For a few minutes, and for a few minutes only, was his  faith in the helpless reality of his wife's sickness shaken; but faith  and pity and indignation were united as she told of her mistreatment  and how she had been outraged and her whole character questioned by  that \"brutal doctor,\" who talked to her as no one had ever dared  before. She was going home on the first train and going home we found  her, having another attack in the Pullman. A collapse, her husband  told himself, from over-exertion and the result of her wounded  womanhood. \"A plain case o' high-strikes\" was the porter's diagnosis;  a sickness sufficiently adequate to have the sweet incense of much  public attention poured upon her wounded spirit--and to secure the  coveted drawing-room!    On her way home! She had spurned her one chance to be scientifically  taught the woefully needed lessons of right living-on her way to the  home which had become more and more chaotic with the passing of the  years and the dwindling of their means.    Who can count the price this woman has paid for her nervousness? At  fifty, with a scrawny, under-nourished body, the wrinkled remnants of  beauty, she suffers actual weakness and distress. Quick prostration  follows all effort, excepting when she is fired by excitement. All  ability to reason in the face of desire is gone; she is dominated by  emotions which become each year more unattractive; even the air-  castles are tumbled into ruins. Her husband is a slave--used as a  convenience. Her waning best is for those who attract her, her growing  worst for those who offend. One child's life is maimed by indulgence,  the other's by injustice. She has reached that moral depravity which  fails to recognize and accept any truth which is opposed to her  wishes. As she looks back over the vista of years, filled with many  activities, no monument of wholesome constructiveness remains; she has  blighted what she touched. Lena Platt, a wilful, spoiled, selfish  hysteric!          CHAPTER IV    WRECKING A GENERATION      The afternoon's heat was intense; it was reflecting in shimmering  waves from everything motionless, this breathless September day in  Donaldsville, Texas. Main Street is a half-mile long, unpainted \"box-  houses\" fringe either end and cluster unkemptly to the west, forming  the \"city's\" thickly populated \"darky town.\" Near the station stands  the new three-story brick hotel, the pride of the metropolis. Not even  the Court House at the county seat is as imposing. Main Street is  flanked by parallel rows of one and two story, brick store-buildings,  from the fronts of which, and covering the wide, board-sidewalks,  extend permanent, wooden awnings; these are bordered by long racks  used for the ponies and mules of the Saturday crowds of \"bottom  niggers\" and \"post oak farmers.\" The higher ground east of Main Street  is preempted by the comfortable residences of Donaldsville proper and  culminates in Quality Hill, where the two bankers and a select group  of wealthy bottom-planters lived in aristocratic supremacy. On this  particular afternoon, the town's only business street was about  deserted. On its shady side were hitched a few Texas ponies whose  drooping heads and wilted ears bespoke the heat--so hot it was that  the flies, even, did not molest them. Scattered groups of lounging,  idle men indicated the enervating influence of the sizzling 108  degrees in the shade.    But Donaldsville was not dead--perspiring certainly, but still  possessing one lively evidence of animation. From time to time peals  of boisterous laughter, boisterous but refreshing as the breath of a  breeze, a congenial, almost contagious laughter would roll up and down  Main Street even to its box-house fringes. Each peal would call forth  from some dusky denizen of the suburbs the proud recognition: \"Dar's  Doctor Jim laughin' some mo'.\" Doctor Jim's laughter was one of  Donaldsville's attractive features. His friends living a mile away  claimed they often heard it--and everybody was Doctor Jim's friend. No  more genial, generous gentleman of the early post-bellum Texas South  could be found. His was an unfathomed well of good nature, good humor  and good stories. He knew all comers whether he had met them before or  not. For him, it was never \"Stranger,\" it was always \"Friend.\"    Let us take his proffered hand and feel the heartiness of its  greeting, feel its friendly shake, even to our shoe-soles. His good  humor beams from his deep-blue eyes; his shock of gray hair, which  knows no comb but his fingers, is pushed back from a brow which might  have been a scholar's, were it not so florid. A soft, white linen  shirt rolls deeply open, exposing a grizzled expanse of powerful  chest. Roomy, baggy, spotless, linen trousers do homage to the heat,  as does his broad, palm-fiber hat, used chiefly as a fan. Doctor Jim  McDonald, six feet in his socks, weighing 180 pounds, erect and manly  in bearing in spite of his negligee, is a remarkable specimen of  physical manhood at sixty-five. Even with the Saturday afternoon  crowds of the cotton-picking season, Main Street seems deserted if his  resounding laughter is not heard; but it takes something as serious as  a funeral to keep him away from his accustomed bench in front of  Doctor Will's drug-store, centrally located on the shady side of the  street. Doctor Will is Doctor Jim's brother, and is, according to the  negroes, a \"sho-nuff\" doctor.    Doctor Jim's life is comfortably monotonous. He had put up the first  windmill in the region roundabout and his was the first real bath-tub  in the county, and long before Donaldsville thought of water-works,  Doctor Jim's windmill was keeping the big cistern on stilts filled  from his deep artesian well. He started each day with a stimulating  plunge in his big tub, and never tired proclaiming that with this and  enough good whiskey he would live to be a hundred--and then Main  Street would stop and listen to the generous reverberations of his  deep-chested laugh. Three good meals, the best old Aunt Sue could cook  and Aunt Sue came from Mississippi with them after the war--were eaten  with an unflagging relish by this man whose digestion had never  discovered itself. Two mornings a week Doctor Jim drove leisurely out  to his big Trinity River plantation, a two-thousand-acre plantation,  where he was the beloved overlord of sixty negro families. This rich,  river-bottom farm, when cotton was at a good price, brought in so much  that Doctor Jim, with another of his big laughs, would say he was  \"mighty lucky in having those rascally twins to throw some of it  away.\" One night a week he could always be found at the Lodge, and  once a day he covered each way the half-mile separating his generous,  rambling home on Quality Hill and Doctor Will's office. His only real  recreation was funerals. He would desert his shady seat and drive  miles to help lay away friend or foe--if foes he had. On such  occasions only, would he pass the threshold of a church. He  contributed generously to each of the town's five denominations and  showed considerable restraint in the presence of the cloth in his  choice of reminiscences, but it was always the occasion of a good-  natured uproar for him to proclaim, \"The Missus has enough religion  for us both.\" Still the silence of his charity could have said truly  that his donation had constructed one-fifth of each church-building in  the town; in fact, it was his pride to double the Biblical one-tenth  in his giving.    Of his open-heartedness Doctor Jim rarely spoke but another pride was  his, to which he allowed no day to pass without some hilariously  expressed reference. He was proud of his whiskey-drinking. One quart  of Kentucky's best Bourbon from sun to sun, decade after decade! \"I  have drunk enough whiskey to float a ship--and some ship too. Look at  me! Where will you find a healthier man at sixty-five? I haven't known  a sick minute since the war. If you drink whiskey right, with plenty  of water and plenty of eatin', it won't hurt anybody.\" This was the  law and the gospel to Doctor Jim; he never failed to proclaim it to  pale-faced youths or ailing mankind; and the Book of Judgment, alone,  will reveal the harvest of destruction which Time reaped through  Doctor Jim's influence in L---County. Yet, oddly, it was Doctor Jim's  principle and practice never to treat. He claimed he had never offered  a living soul a social drink.    \"Drink whiskey right and it won't hurt anybody!\" Did it hurt?    Doctor Jim and his two brothers spent their early life on a plantation  in Mississippi. The father wanted the boys to be educated. Two of them  took medical courses in New Orleans. Doctor Jim wished to see more of  the world, and literally did see much of it on a two-year cruise  around the Horn to the East Indies and China. He was thirty-five years  old in '60 when he married. Then he served as surgeon--\"mighty poor  surgeon\" he used to say, for a Mississippi regiment throughout the  four years of the Civil War. He and his two brothers passed through  this conflict and returned home to find their father dead, the negroes "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#6)"],[1,"of  Mulek. These varied legends concerning Votan resembling in the respects  here pointed out the several Book of Mormon characters, lead one to  regard as reasonable the supposition advanced by nearly all writers who  speak of him, that Votan is a generic name; and that the legends which  center about this name represent the exploits of several of America's  culture-heroes, [13] and, as I believe, of several Book of Mormon  characters.    III.    _The Peruvian Tradition of the Messiah._    The natives of Chili have the following tradition concerning one  of their culture-heroes, which closely resembles Messiah as he was  revealed to the Nephites:        Rosales, in his inedited (i. e. unpublished) History of Chili,      declares that the inhabitants of that extremely southern portion      of America, situated at the distance of so many thousand miles      from New Spain, and who did not employ paintings to record      events, accounted for their knowledge of some of the doctrines of      Christianity by saying, \"that in former times, as they had heard      their fathers say, a wonderful man had come to that country,      wearing a long beard, with shoes, and a mantle such as the Indians      carry on their shoulders, who performed many miracles, cured the      sick with water, caused it to rain, and their crops and grain      to grow, kindled fire at a breath, and wrought other marvels,      healing at once the sick, and giving sight to the blind; and that      he spoke with as much propriety and elegance in the language of      their country as if he had always resided in it, addressing them      in words very sweet and new to them, telling them that the Creator      of the universe resided in the highest place of heaven, and that      many men and women who were resplendent as the sun dwelt with him.      They say that he shortly afterwards went to Peru, and that many, in      imitation of the habit and shoes which that man used, introduced      among themselves the fashion of wearing shoes, and the loose mantle      over the shoulders, either fastened with a clasp at the breast, or      knotted at the corners, whence it may be inferred that this man was      some apostle whose name they do not know.\" [14]    The points of comparison between the character referred to in the  foregoing quotation and the Messiah in his ministry among the Nephites,  are:    First: In personal appearance, if due allowance be made for the  imperfect description in the legend.    Second: In the character of the work performed, especially in  the matter of healing of the sick. While in their midst Jesus is  represented as saying to the Nephites:        Have ye any that are sick among you, bring them hither. Have ye      any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or      that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in      any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have      compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy; for I      perceive that ye desire that I shew unto you what I have done unto      your brethren at Jerusalem, for I see that your faith is sufficient      that I should heal you. And it came to pass that when he had thus      spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth with their      sick, and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind,      and with their dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any      manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth      unto him. [15]    Third: In relation to the graciousness of his language, the third Nephi  represents the Savior as praying for the Nephites in this manner:        And the things which he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude      did bear record who heard him. And after this manner did they      bear record: \"The eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard      before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus      speak unto the Father, and no tongue can speak, neither can there      be written by any man, neither can the heart of man conceive so      great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak;      and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the      time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.\" [16]    Fourth: Relative to teaching the people, that many men and women were  resplendent in their glory and were already dwelling with God, the Book  of Mormon mentions the circumstance of Jesus taking very great pains to  have recorded in the Nephite annals the fact that many of the ancient  Saints arose from the dead and appeared unto many and ministered  unto them; [17] and from the whole tenor of his instructions to the  Nephites, as found in III. Nephi, it is clear that there was ever  present in his thought the fact of redeemed and glorified immortals  dwelling with God in his kingdom.    Fifth: The reference in the quotation to the departure of the man-God  for another land is paralleled in the Book of Mormon account of Jesus,  where he is represented as declaring the existence of the lost tribes  of the house of Israel, and the declaration of his intention to visit  them. \"Now,\" said he, \"I go unto the Father, and also to show myself  unto the lost tribes of Israel, for they are not lost unto the Father,  for he knoweth whither he hath taken them.\" [18]    IV.    _Topilitzen Quetzalcohuatl._    This personage appears under different names in the native traditions  of various countries of America. In the Popol Vuh of the Quiches he is  known under the title of Gucumatz; [19] in Yucatan he appears under  the name of Cukulcan; [20] in Oajaca (despite some difficulties and  contradictions) as Huemac; and in Mexico, par excellence, as Toplitzin  Quetzalcohuatl. Respecting this character, various opinions are held.  By some he is regarded as the Apostle St. Thomas, whom they credit with  coming to America and preaching the Christian religion. \"In support  of their opinion,\" says Bancroft, \"that he [Quetzalcohuatl] was no  other than the apostle, they allege that the hero-god's proper name,  Topilitzen Quetzalcohuatl, closely resembles in sound and signification  that of 'Thomas, surnamed Didymus;' for 'to' in the Mexican name,  is an abbreviation of Thomas, to which 'pilcin,' meaning 'son' or  'disciple,' is added; while the meaning of Quetzalcohuatl (in the Aztec  language) is exactly the same as that of the Greek name 'Didymus,' 'a  twin,' being compounded of 'quetzalli,' a 'plume of green feathers,'  metaphorically signifying anything precious, and 'coatl,' a serpent,  metaphorically meaning one of two twins.\" [21]    Lord Kingsborough, it is well known, is the foremost among those who  have identified this traditionary personage (Quetzalcohuatl) with the  Hebrew Messiah--Jesus of Nazareth; and to this subject he devoted  an incredible amount of labor and research. [22] As Kingsborough's  interpretation of the name, Topilitzin Quetzalcohuatl, as also the  substance of his argument will appear in quotations from his works,  it is not necessary to make a statement of them here. Let it suffice,  at this point, to say that native American traditions assign too many  of the qualities of Deity to Quetzalcohuatl to regard him merely as  a man; and while many things are ascribed to him that are not in  harmony with the character and mission of Messiah as set forth in  the Book of Mormon, still one may trace the outlines of Messiah's  advent and labors among the Nephites in the career of Quetzalcohuatl,  as also the qualities of his divinity in what tradition ascribes to  the Aztec deity. As for those adventures and human qualities found  in Quetzalcohuatl not properly ascribable to Messiah, they arise,  doubtless, out of the fact that the native traditions have confounded  some of the exploits and characteristics of other great personages who  have figured in their history with those of Messiah.    In order that the reader may have a fairly full account of what is said  of this American man-divinity, I shall quote what several reliable  authorities have said of him, beginning with Prescott:        A far more interesting personage in their [i. e. the Mexicans]      mythology was Quetzalcohuatl, god of the air, a divinity, during      his residence on earth, instructed the natives in the use of      metals, in agriculture, and in the arts of government. He was one      of those benefactors of their species, doubtless, who have been      deified by gratitude of posterity. Under him, the earth teemed      with fruits and flowers, without the pains of culture. An ear of      Indian corn was as much as a single man could carry. The cotton,      as it grew took of its own accord, the rich dyes of human art. The      air was filled with intoxicating perfumes and the sweet melody of      birds. In short, these were the halcyon days, which find a place      in the mythic systems of so many nations in the Old World. It      was the golden age of Anahuac. From some cause, not explained,      Quetzalcohuatl, incurred the wrath of one of the principal gods,      and was compelled to abandon the country. On his way, he stopped at      the city of Cholula, where a temple was dedicated to his worship,      the massy ruins of which still form one of the most interesting      relics of antiquity in Mexico. When he reached the shores of the      Mexican Gulf, he took leave of his followers, promising that he and      his descendants would visit them hereafter, and then, entering his      wizard skiff, made of serpents' skins, embarked on the great ocean      for the fabled land of Tlapallan. He was said to have been tall in      stature, with a white skin, long, dark hair, and a flowing beard.      The Mexicans looked confidently to the return of the benevolent      deity; and this remarkable tradition, deeply cherished in their      hearts, prepared the way. * * * * * * for the future success of the      Spaniards.
