The strain of present circumstances he  felt to be intolerable.    The philosophical tall soldier measured a sandwich of cracker and pork  and swallowed it in a nonchalant manner.  \"Oh, I suppose we must go  reconnoitering around the country jest to keep 'em from getting too  close, or to develop 'em, or something.\"    \"Huh!\" said the loud soldier.    \"Well,\" cried the youth, still fidgeting, \"I'd rather do anything 'most  than go tramping 'round the country all day doing no good to nobody and  jest tiring ourselves out.\"    \"So would I,\" said the loud soldier.  \"It ain't right.  I tell you if  anybody with any sense was a-runnin' this army it--\"    \"Oh, shut up!\" roared the tall private.  \"You little fool.  You little  damn' cuss.  You ain't had that there coat and them pants on for six  months, and yet you talk as if--\"    \"Well, I wanta do some fighting anyway,\" interrupted the other.  \"I  didn't come here to walk.  I could 'ave walked to home--'round an'  'round the barn, if I jest wanted to walk.\"    The tall one, red-faced, swallowed another sandwich as if taking poison  in despair.    But gradually, as he chewed, his face became again quiet and contented.  He could not rage in fierce argument in the presence of such  sandwiches.  During his meals he always wore an air of blissful  contemplation of the food he had swallowed.  His spirit seemed then to  be communing with the viands.    He accepted new environment and circumstance with great coolness,  eating from his haversack at every opportunity.  On the march he went  along with the stride of a hunter, objecting to neither gait nor  distance.  And he had not raised his voice when he had been ordered  away from three little protective piles of earth and stone, each of  which had been an engineering feat worthy of being made sacred to the  name of his grandmother.    In the afternoon, the regiment went out over the same ground it had  taken in the morning.  The landscape then ceased to threaten the youth.  He had been close to it and become familiar with it.    When, however, they began to pass into a new region, his old fears of  stupidity and incompetence reassailed him, but this time he doggedly  let them babble.  He was occupied with his problem, and in his  desperation he concluded that the stupidity did not greatly matter.    Once he thought he had concluded that it would be better to get killed  directly and end his troubles.  Regarding death thus out of the corner  of his eye, he conceived it to be nothing but rest, and he was filled  with a momentary astonishment that he should have made an extraordinary  commotion over the mere matter of getting killed.  He would die; he  would go to some place where he would be understood.  It was useless to  expect appreciation of his profound and fine sense from such men as the  lieutenant.  He must look to the grave for comprehension.    The skirmish fire increased to a long clattering sound.  With it was  mingled far-away cheering.  A battery spoke.    Directly the youth could see the skirmishers running.  They were  pursued by the sound of musketry fire.  After a time the hot, dangerous  flashes of the rifles were visible.  Smoke clouds went slowly and  insolently across the fields like observant phantoms.  The din became  crescendo, like the roar of an oncoming train.    A brigade ahead of them and on the right went into action with a  rending roar.  It was as if it had exploded.  And thereafter it lay  stretched in the distance behind a long gray wall, that one was obliged  to look twice at to make sure that it was smoke.    The youth, forgetting his neat plan of getting killed, gazed spell  bound.  His eyes grew wide and busy with the action of the scene.  His  mouth was a little ways open.    Of a sudden he felt a heavy and sad hand laid upon his shoulder.  Awakening from his trance of observation he turned and beheld the loud  soldier.    \"It's my first and last battle, old boy,\" said the latter, with intense  gloom.  He was quite pale and his girlish lip was trembling.    \"Eh?\" murmured the youth in great astonishment.    \"It's my first and last battle, old boy,\" continued the loud soldier.  \"Something tells me--\"    \"What?\"    \"I'm a gone coon this first time and--and I w-want you to take these  here things--to--my--folks.\"  He ended in a quavering sob of pity for  himself.  He handed the youth a little packet done up in a yellow  envelope.    \"Why, what the devil--\" began the youth again.    But the other gave him a glance as from the depths of a tomb, and  raised his limp hand in a prophetic manner and turned away.          Chapter 4      The brigade was halted in the fringe of a grove.  The men crouched  among the trees and pointed their restless guns out at the fields.  They tried to look beyond the smoke.    Out of this haze they could see running men.  Some shouted information  and gestured as the hurried.    The men of the new regiment watched and listened eagerly, while their  tongues ran on in gossip of the battle.  They mouthed rumors that had  flown like birds out of the unknown.    \"They say Perry has been driven in with big loss.\"    \"Yes, Carrott went t' th' hospital.  He said he was sick.  That smart  lieutenant is commanding 'G' Company.  Th' boys say they won't be under  Carrott no more if they all have t' desert.  They allus knew he was a--\"    \"Hannises' batt'ry is took.\"    \"It ain't either.  I saw Hannises' batt'ry off on th' left not more'n  fifteen minutes ago.\"    \"Well--\"    \"Th' general, he ses he is goin' t' take th' hull command of th' 304th  when we go inteh action, an' then he ses we'll do sech fightin' as  never another one reg'ment done.\"    \"They say we're catchin' it over on th' left.  They say th' enemy driv'  our line inteh a devil of a swamp an' took Hannises' batt'ry.\"    \"No sech thing.  Hannises' batt'ry was 'long here 'bout a minute ago.\"    \"That young Hasbrouck, he makes a good off'cer.  He ain't afraid 'a  nothin'.\"    \"I met one of th' 148th Maine boys an' he ses his brigade fit th' hull  rebel army fer four hours over on th' turnpike road an' killed about  five thousand of 'em.  He ses one more sech fight as that an' th' war  'll be over.\"    \"Bill wasn't scared either.  No, sir!  It wasn't that.  Bill ain't  a-gittin' scared easy.  He was jest mad, that's what he was.  When that  feller trod on his hand, he up an' sed that he was willin' t' give his  hand t' his country, but he be dumbed if he was goin' t' have every  dumb bushwhacker in th' kentry walkin' 'round on it.  So he went t' th'  hospital disregardless of th' fight.  Three fingers was crunched.  Th'  dern doctor wanted t' amputate 'm, an' Bill, he raised a heluva row, I  hear.  He's a funny feller.\"    The din in front swelled to a tremendous chorus.  The youth and his  fellows were frozen to silence.  They could see a flag that tossed in  the smoke angrily.  Near it were the blurred and agitated forms of  troops.  There came a turbulent stream of men across the fields.  A  battery changing position at a frantic gallop scattered the stragglers  right and left.    A shell screaming like a storm banshee went over the huddled heads of  the reserves.  It landed in the grove, and exploding redly flung the  brown earth.  There was a little shower of pine needles.    Bullets began to whistle among the branches and nip at the trees.  Twigs and leaves came sailing down.  It was as if a thousand axes, wee  and invisible, were being wielded.  Many of the men were constantly  dodging and ducking their heads.    The lieutenant of the youth's company was shot in the hand.  He began  to swear so wondrously that a nervous laugh went along the regimental  line.  The officer's profanity sounded conventional.  It relieved the  tightened senses of the new men.  It was as if he had hit his fingers  with a tack hammer at home.    He held the wounded member carefully away from his side so that the  blood would not drip upon his trousers.    The captain of the company, tucking his sword under his arm, produced a  handkerchief and began to bind with it the lieutenant's wound.  And  they disputed as to how the binding should be done.    The battle flag in the distance jerked about madly.  It seemed to be  struggling to free itself from an agony.  The billowing smoke was  filled with horizontal flashes.    Men rushing swiftly emerged from it.  They grew in numbers until it was  seen that the whole command was fleeing.  The flag suddenly sank down  as if dying.  Its motion as it fell was a gesture of despair.    Wild yells came from behind the walls of smoke.  A sketch in gray and  red dissolved into a moblike body of men who galloped like wild horses.  The veteran regiments on the right and left of the 304th immediately  began to jeer.  With the passionate song of the bullets and the banshee  shrieks of shells were mingled loud catcalls and bits of facetious  advice concerning places of safety.    But the new regiment was breathless with horror.  \"Gawd!  Saunders's  got crushed!\" whispered the man at the youth's elbow.  They shrank back  and crouched as if compelled to await a flood.    The youth shot a swift glance along the blue ranks of the regiment.  The profiles were motionless, carven; and afterward he remembered that  the color sergeant was standing with his legs apart, as if he expected  to be pushed to the ground.    The following throng went whirling around the flank.  Here and there  were officers carried along on the stream like exasperated chips.  They  were striking about them with their swords and with their left fists,  punching every head they could reach.  They cursed like highwaymen.    A mounted officer displayed the furious anger of a spoiled child.  He  raged with his head, his arms, and his legs.    Another, the commander of the brigade, was galloping about bawling.  His hat was gone "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7300"],[0,"Woman and the Republic (#6)"],[1,"the social,  civil, and religious condition and rights of woman; and in preparation for  the meeting, they wrote a \"Declaration of Sentiments,\" which was adopted  by the assembly. They say, in describing the writing of this declaration:--  \"The reports of Peace, Temperance, and Anti-Slavery conventions were  examined, but all alike seemed too tame and pacific for the inauguration  of a rebellion such as the world had never before seen. We knew women had  wrongs, but how to state them was the difficulty, and this was increased  from the fact that we ourselves were fortunately organized and  conditioned.... After much delay, one of the circle took up the  Declaration of 1776, and read it aloud with spirit and emphasis, and it  was at once decided to adopt the historic document, with some slight  changes. Knowing that women must have more to complain of than men under  any circumstances possibly could, and seeing the Fathers had eighteen  grievances, a protracted search was made through statute books, church  usages, and the customs of society to find that exact number.\"    In such solemnly puerile fashion did they work out a travesty on one of  the most august utterances ever penned. A young man who was present  remarked: \"Tour grievances must be grievous indeed when you are obliged to  go to books in order to find them out.\" He might have added, \"And they  must be false indeed when you have to found most of your charges on dead-  letter statutes and outgrown usages and customs.\"    The Preamble of their Declaration reads: \"When, in the course of human  events, it becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to  assume among the people of the earth a position different from that which  they have hitherto occupied, but one to which the laws of nature and of  nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind  requires that they should declare the causes that impel them to such a  course.\"    The declaration is as follows: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident:  That all men and women are created equal; that they are endowed by their  Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life,  liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights  governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of  the governed. Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these  ends, it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to  it, and to insist upon the institution of a new government, laying its  foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as  to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should  not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all  experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while  evils are suffer able, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to  which they were accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and  usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to  reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their duty to throw off such  government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has  been the patient sufferance of the women under this government, and such  is now the necessity which constrains them to demand the equal station to  which they are entitled. The history of mankind is a history of repeated  injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct  object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her. To prove this,  let facts be submitted to a candid world.\" Then follows a categorical  parody of the eighteen grievances, which will be duly considered in this  and later chapters.    After thirty years of Suffrage effort, the leaders say that this  instrument contained all that the most radical have ever claimed. The  Fathers of the Revolution say in their Preamble: \"When, in the course of  human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the  political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume  among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the  laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the  opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which  impel them to the separation.\" The Mothers of the Woman's Rebellion say:  \"When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one portion  of the family of man to assume among the people of the earth a position  different from that which they have hitherto occupied, but one to which  the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect for  the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes that  impel them to such a course.\" The strained and ridiculous attitude  produced by ignoring the essential difference between a political movement  and a sex movement is visible in every line, and yet that instinct which  finds for a new cause its appropriate channel never carried more truly  than in this presentment of the ultimate purpose of woman suffrage. The  Fathers were met to dissolve the relations that bound their land  politically to a foreign power, and to form a separate and equal nation.  The Mothers were met to dissolve the relations that bound their sex  politically to man, and to form a separate and equal sex organization. The  Fathers proposed to free men, women, and children from the yoke of  England. The Mothers proposed to free women and girls from the yoke of  men. It is suggestive to consider the \"slight changes,\" between the two  Declarations.    The Fathers of the Revolution begin their protest by saying: \"We hold  these truths to be self-evident:--That all men are created equal, that  they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that  among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" The Mothers  of the Woman's Rebellion add nothing to the meaning, but detract greatly  from the force of its expression, when in their parody they say: \"We hold  these truths to be self-evident: That all men and women are created equal,  and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that  among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" These women  of all in America were the first to belittle themselves by seeming to  assume that in a revolutionary document that was promulgated to declare a  determination to wrest from tyranny the liberty that was an inalienable  right for all, they and their sex were excluded because the generic term  \"man\" was employed in relation to another inalienable right, which was  about to be set forth,--that of revolution against intolerable tyranny.  The Americans who framed that instrument would have been the last men in  the world to assert that women were not the equals of men. They were not  discussing abstract human or sex conditions. They met \"to institute a new  government.\" The Mothers of the Woman's Rebellion had an inalienable right  to meet \"to institute a new government,\" if they believed as sincerely as  did the Fathers of the Revolution that \"a long train of abuses and  usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinced a design to  reduce them under absolute despotism.\" Life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness were their natural and God-given rights. If they truly believed  that these were trampled upon by government, they might be justified in  revolting and attempting to form a new government. That they did not so  believe, seems to be proved by their statement that \"they knew that woman  had wrongs, but how to state them was the difficulty, and this was  increased from the fact that they themselves were fortunately organized  and conditioned.\" The Declaration of Independence meant war against the  ever-growing encroachment of despotism. The gauntlet was thrown down at  the feet of a king by his subjects. The Declaration of Sentiments meant  war against the whole social order as then constituted. The gauntlet was  thrown down at the feet of man by those who declared him to be a  determined foe.    They had not the remotest notion of \"instituting a new government,\" far  from it; they relied upon the old government to sustain them in making  their attempted \"rebellion\" a revolution. Without the backing of the  state's defence, they had no expectation or hope of enforcing any new  enactment they might desire. They were gladly consenting to be governed,  in order to prove that they withheld consent.    Should woman suffrage prevail, the foundation principles of democracy  would have to be overthrown and \"a new government instituted\" in which the  power should be delegated and not direct, if the nation thus formed was to  \"assume among the powers of the earth a separate and equal station.\" The  leaders of the Suffrage movement well understood that they claimed no  inalienable right to institute a new government, and this is again shown  in another \"slight change\" made by them. The first count in the suffrage  indictment against all men, but especially against those of the American  Republic, reads as follows: \"He has never permitted her to exercise her  inalienable right to the elective franchise.\" The Fathers made no claim or  suggestion that the suffrage was an inalienable right, or a right at all.  Not only is there nothing to intimate that voting was a natural right, but  from that day to this it has been the theory and the practice of our  Government to control the suffrage. The fact that \"governments were  instituted among men\" for the purpose of securing inalienable rights,  proves that in the opinion of the Declarers the method of instituting a  government was not in itself inalienable. Governments to secure certain  inalienable rights are instituted among men, wrote Jefferson, \"deriving  their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" This was not the  first"]]]
