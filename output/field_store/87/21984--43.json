[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1149"],[0,"From London to Land's End (#7)"],[1," cut through by the course of divers pleasant  and profitable rivers; in the course and near the banks of which there  always is a chain of fruitful meadows and rich pastures, and those  interspersed with innumerable pleasant towns, villages, and houses, and  among them many of considerable magnitude.  So that, while you view the  downs, and think the country wild and uninhabited, yet when you come to  descend into these vales you are surprised with the most pleasant and  fertile country in England.    There are no less than four of these rivers, which meet all together at  or near the city of Salisbury; especially the waters of three of them run  through the streets of the city--the Nadder and the Willy and the  Avon--and the course of these three lead us through the whole mountainous  part of the county.  The two first join their waters at Wilton, the  shiretown, though a place of no great notice now; and these are the  waters which run through the canal and the gardens of Wilton House, the  seat of that ornament of nobility and learning, the Earl of Pembroke.    One cannot be said to have seen anything that a man of curiosity would  think worth seeing in this county, and not have been at Wilton House; but  not the beautiful building, not the ancient trophy of a great family, not  the noble situation, not all the pleasures of the gardens, parks,  fountains, hare-warren, or of whatever is rare either in art or nature,  are equal to that yet more glorious sight of a noble princely palace  constantly filled with its noble and proper inhabitants.  The lord and  proprietor, who is indeed a true patriarchal monarch, reigns here with an  authority agreeable to all his subjects (family); and his reign is made  agreeable, by his first practising the most exquisite government of  himself, and then guiding all under him by the rules of honour and  virtue, being also himself perfectly master of all the needful arts of  family government--I mean, needful to make that government both easy and  pleasant to those who are under it, and who therefore willingly, and by  choice, conform to it.    Here an exalted genius is the instructor, a glorious example the guide,  and a gentle well-directed hand the governor and law-giver to the whole;  and the family, like a well-governed city, appears happy, flourishing,  and regular, groaning under no grievance, pleased with what they enjoy,  and enjoying everything which they ought to be pleased with.    Nor is the blessing of this noble resident extended to the family only,  but even to all the country round, who in their degree feel the effects  of the general beneficence, and where the neighbourhood (however poor)  receive all the good they can expect, and are sure to have no injury or  oppression.    The canal before the house lies parallel with the road, and receives into  it the whole river Willy, or at least is able to do so; it may, indeed,  be said that the river is made into a canal.  When we come into the  courtyards before the house there are several pieces of antiquity to  entertain the curious, as particularly a noble column of porphyry, with a  marble statue of Venus on the top of it.  In Italy, and especially at  Rome and Naples, we see a great variety of fine columns, and some of them  of excellent workmanship and antiquity; and at some of the courts of the  princes of Italy the like is seen, as especially at the court of  Florence; but in England I do not remember to have seen anything like  this, which, as they told me, is two-and-thirty feet high, and of  excellent workmanship, and that it came last from Candia, but formerly  from Alexandria.  What may belong to the history of it any further, I  suppose is not known--at least, they could tell me no more of it who  showed it me.    On the left of the court was formerly a large grotto and curious water-  works; and in a house, or shed, or part of the building, which opened  with two folding-doors, like a coach-house, a large equestrian statue of  one of the ancestors of the family in complete armour, as also another of  a Roman Emperor in brass.  But the last time I had the curiosity to see  this house, I missed that part; so that I supposed they were removed.    As the present Earl of Pembroke, the lord of this fine palace, is a  nobleman of great personal merit many other ways, so he is a man of  learning and reading beyond most men of his lordship's high rank in this  nation, if not in the world; and as his reading has made him a master of  antiquity, and judge of such pieces of antiquity as he has had  opportunity to meet with in his own travels and otherwise in the world,  so it has given him a love of the study, and made him a collector of  valuable things, as well in painting as in sculpture, and other  excellences of art, as also of nature; insomuch that Wilton House is now  a mere museum or a chamber of rarities, and we meet with several things  there which are to be found nowhere else in the world.    As his lordship is a great collector of fine paintings, so I know no  nobleman's house in England so prepared, as if built on purpose, to  receive them; the largest and the finest pieces that can be imagined  extant in the world might have found a place here capable to receive  them.  I say, they \"might have found,\" as if they could not now, which is  in part true; for at present the whole house is so completely filled that  I see no room for any new piece to crowd in without displacing some other  fine piece that hung there before.  As for the value of the piece that  might so offer to succeed the displaced, that the great judge of the  whole collection, the earl himself, must determine; and as his judgment  is perfectly good, the best picture would be sure to possess the place.  In a word, here is without doubt the best, if not the greatest,  collection of rarities and paintings that are to be seen together in any  one nobleman's or gentleman's house in England.  The piece of our Saviour  washing His disciples' feet, which they show you in one of the first  rooms you go into, must be spoken of by everybody that has any knowledge  of painting, and is an admirable piece indeed.    You ascend the great staircase at the upper end of the hall, which is  very large; at the foot of the staircase you have a Bacchus as large as  life, done in fine Peloponnesian marble, carrying a young Bacchus on his  arm, the young one eating grapes, and letting you see by his countenance  that he is pleased with the taste of them.  Nothing can be done finer, or  more lively represent the thing intended--namely, the gust of the  appetite, which if it be not a passion, it is an affection which is as  much seen in the countenance, perhaps more than any other.  One ought to  stop every two steps of this staircase, as we go up, to contemplate the  vast variety of pictures that cover the walls, and of some of the best  masters in Europe; and yet this is but an introduction to what is beyond  them.    When you are entered the apartments, such variety seizes you every way  that you scarce know to which hand to turn yourself.  First on one side  you see several rooms filled with paintings as before, all so curious,  and the variety such, that it is with reluctance that you can turn from  them; while looking another way you are called off by a vast collection  of busts and pieces of the greatest antiquity of the kind, both Greek and  Romans; among these there is one of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius in  basso-relievo.  I never saw anything like what appears here, except in  the chamber of rarities at Munich in Bavaria.    Passing these, you come into several large rooms, as if contrived for the  reception of the beautiful guests that take them up; one of these is near  seventy feet long, and the ceiling twenty-six feet high, with another  adjoining of the same height and breadth, but not so long.  Those  together might be called the Great Gallery of Wilton, and might vie for  paintings with the Gallery of Luxembourg, in the Faubourg of Paris.    These two rooms are filled with the family pieces of the house of  Herbert, most of them by Lilly or Vandyke; and one in particular outdoes  all that I ever met with, either at home or abroad; it is done, as was  the mode of painting at that time, after the manner of a family piece of  King Charles I., with his queen and children, which before the burning of  Whitehall I remember to hang at the east end of the Long Gallery in the  palace.    This piece fills the farther end of the great room which I just now  mentioned; it contains the Earl of Montgomery, ancestor of the house of  Herbert (not then Earls of Pembroke) and his lady, sitting, and as big as  life; there are about them their own five sons and one daughter, and  their daughter-in-law, who was daughter of the Duke of Buckingham,  married to the elder Lord Herbert, their eldest son.  It is enough to say  of this piece, it is worth the labour of any lover of art to go five  hundred miles to see it; and I am informed several gentlemen of quality  have come from France almost on purpose.  It would be endless to describe  the whole set of the family pictures which take up this room, unless we  would enter into the roof-tree of the family, and set down a genealogical  line of the whole house.    After we have seen this fine range of beauties--for such, indeed, they  are--far from being at an end of your surprise, you have three or four  rooms still upon the same floor, filled with wonders as before.  Nothing  can be finer than the pictures themselves, nothing more surprising than  the number of them.  At length you descend the back stairs, which are in  themselves large, though not like the other.  However, not a  hand's-breadth is left to crowd a picture in of the smallest size; and  even the upper rooms, which might be called garrets, are not naked, but  have some very good pieces in them.    Upon the whole, the genius of the noble collector "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11498"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 601, July 9, 1887 (#7)"],[1,"body of molten metal is poured into a mould in which they are placed,  they would be torn to fragments and float to the surface even though  they were unconsumed, yet such is not the case. I have found in practice  that the most delicate fabrics may be subjected to this treatment  without danger of destruction, and that no special care is needed either  in preparing the mould or in pouring the metal.    By the aid of the megascope, the enlarged images of some of these  castings, showing the delicate tracery of the patterns, will now be  projected upon the screen, and you can all see how perfectly the design  is reproduced.    In these experiments, the mould was made in \"green sand\" in the ordinary  manner, and the fabric laid smoothly upon one face, being cut slightly  larger than the mould, in order that it might project over the edge, so  that when the moulding flask was closed, the fabric was held in its  proper position. As the molten metal flowed into the mould, it forced  the fabric firmly against the sand wall, and when the casting was  removed, the carbonized fabric was stripped off from its face without  injury. In this way several castings have been made from one carbonized  material.    These castings are as sharp as electrotypes, whether made of soft fluid  iron or of hard, quick-setting metal. This peculiarity is owing to the  affinity between molten iron or steel and carbon. The molten metal tends  to absorb the carbon as it flows over it, thus causing the fabric to hug  the metal closely. It is somewhat analogous to the effect of pouring  mercury over zinc. You know that when mercury is poured upon a board, it  runs in a globular form, it does not \"wet\" the board, so to speak; but  when poured upon a plate of clean zinc, it flows like water and wets  every portion of the zinc, or, as we say, it amalgamates with the zinc.  So when molten iron is poured into an ordinary sand mould, which has  been faced with this refractorily carbonized fabric, it wets every  portion of it, tending to absorb the carbon, and doubtless would do so  if it remained fluid long enough, but as the metal cools almost  immediately, there is no appreciable destruction of the fibers.    The casting which I shall now exhibit represents a very interesting and  novel experiment. In this case, the piece of lace, having open meshes a  little larger than a pin's head, instead of being laid upon one face of  the mould, was suspended in it in such a way as to divide it into two  equal parts. Two gates or runners were provided, leading from the  \"sinking head\" to the bottom of the mould, one on each side of the lace  partition. The molten iron was poured into the sinking head, and flowing  equally through both runners, filled the mould to a common level. The  lace, which was held in position by having its edges embedded in the  walls of the mould, remained intact. When the casting was cold, it was  thrown upon the floor of the foundry and separated into two parts, while  the lace fell out uninjured, and the pattern was found to be reproduced  upon each face of the casting.    The question naturally arises, Why did not the iron run through the  holes and join together? The answer may be found in the fact that the  thin film of oxide of iron, or \"skin,\" as it is popularly called, which  always forms on the surface of molten iron, was caught in these fine  meshes, and thus prevented the molten metal from joining through the  holes. I have repeated the experiment a number of times, and find that  the meshes must be quite small (not over one fiftieth of an inch),  otherwise the metal will reunite.    I think that this observation explains the cause of many obscure flaws  found in castings, sometimes causing them to break when subjected to  quite moderate strains. We frequently find little \"cold shot,\" or  metallic globules, embedded in cast iron or steel, impairing the  strength of the metal, and it has long been asked, \"What is the cause of  this defect?\" The pellicles have been carefully analyzed, under the  supposition that they might be alloys of iron and nickel, or some other  refractory metal, but the analysis has failed to substantiate this  theory. Is it not probable that in the process of casting, little drops  of molten metal are sometimes splashed out of the stream, which  immediately solidify and become coated with a skin of oxide, then  falling back into the stream of rapidly cooling metal, they do not  remelt, neither do they weld or amalgamate with the mass, owing to this  protective coating, thus forming dangerous flaws in the casting?    The process of carbonizing the delicate fabrics, leaves, grasses, etc.,  is as follows: The objects are placed in a cast iron box, the bottom of  which is covered with a layer of powdered charcoal or other form of  carbon, then another layer of carbon dust is sprinkled over them, and  the box is covered with a close fitting lid. The box is next heated  gradually in an oven, to drive off moisture, and the temperature slowly  raised until the escape of blue smoke from under the lid ceases. The  heat is then increased until the box becomes white hot. It is kept in  this glowing condition for at least two hours. It is then removed from  the fire, allowed to cool, and the contents are tested in a gas flame.  If they have been thoroughly carbonized, they will not glow when removed  from the flame, and the fibers may even be heated white hot before  consuming.    Of course, the method employed to carbonize the materials is suspectible  of variation, but the scientific principles involved are unchangeable,  viz.:    (1) Partial exclusion of air and substitution therefor of a carbon  atmosphere.    (2) Slow heating to drive off moisture and volatile elements.    (3) Intense and prolonged heating of the partly charred objects to  eliminate remaining foreign elements, and to change the carbon from the  combustible form of ordinary charcoal to a highly refractory condition.

At the recent meeting of Scottish gas managers Mr. A. Macpherson, of  Kirkcaldy, the chairman, said:      THE REGENERATIVE SYSTEM OF RETORT FIRINGS.    For me to attempt, with the time at my disposal, to do full justice to  many important points which have cropped up since our last meeting, and  which will, no doubt, have been engaging your individual attention,  would be impossible. But I think there can be no doubt that, although at  our last meeting we had a very full and interesting discussion on the  different systems of regenerative retort settings, still we might very  profitably spend a little time to-day in hearing the experience of those  who have had some of the systems introduced into their works since then,  or who may have gained further experience with the system they were then  working, or have introduced improvements or modifications thereon.    For the purpose of inducing a discussion on this subject, I will give  you the result of the working of the bench of retorts which I erected  three years ago on the Siemens system. As I stated last year, my  experience up to that time had not been altogether a happy one, but one  of sunshine and cloud alternately. I am glad to be able to say, however,  that since then I have had nothing but the utmost satisfaction in the  working of the regenerative settings. The chief difficulties I have  before experienced were of a mixed nature--choked ascension pipes,  entailing considerable loss of gas; the choking of the orifices from  which the secondary heated air issued to join the producer gas; and the  eating away, in a \"scooped-out\" sort of fashion, of the brick lining of  the producers at the points where the primary air entered. These, I am  pleased to be able to say, I am now completely clear of; and this has  had the effect of converting what was before a considerable source of  annoyance and anxiety into as perfect a working bench of retorts as any  one could desire.    The results I have obtained have caused me much surprise, being far in  excess of anything I ever anticipated; and the saving effected will  materially assist in compensating for the greatly reduced value of  residuals. I may state that I have used 30 per cent. of fuel on an  average, saved from 25 to 30 per cent. on stokers' wages, and increased  my production of gas per ton of coal; while the regularity of the heats  was a pleasure to look upon.    As showing what I have been able to accomplish, I will give you a few  details. I was able regularly to produce 10,000 cubic feet of gas per  mouthpiece in 24 hours--the size of my retorts being 18 by 13 inches by  9 feet long, inside measure; and on a sudden dullness coming on, with an  increase of first class cannel I produced from 33 retorts 357,000 cubic  feet, or at the rate of 11,500 feet per mouthpiece in 24 hours. With 32  retorts I made as much gas as would have required 42 retorts to produce  on the old system. But I know that even this can be excelled; and I am  aware that there are works where, by the introduction of retorts  measuring 21 by 15 inches, instead of 18 by 13 inches--and which, I may  say, can be put quite easily into the same arch--a production of 12,000  cubic feet per mouthpiece can be obtained. This will, of course, still  further reduce the cost of production.    With such an experience, gentlemen, I think it is almost needless for me  to add that I am a strong advocate of the regenerative system. I have  often heard it asked, \"But can"]]]
