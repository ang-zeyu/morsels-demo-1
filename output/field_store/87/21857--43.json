One of the picturesque features of a Chinese landscape is the pagoda.  These structures were introduced in the early stages of Buddhism to  enshrine the relics of Buddha. It was said that Buddha's body consisted  of eighty thousand parts, hence numerous pagodas were erected to shelter  these relics. Inasmuch as a pagoda contained the relics of Buddha, it  possessed magic power and so came to play a great part in the control of  the winds and the rains. The pagoda in China has an odd number of  stories varying from three to thirteen. The odd numbers belong to the  positive principle in nature which is superior to the negative  principle. The pagoda plays quite a part in the festivals of the people.  On certain occasions the stories are hung with lanterns and the pagodas  are visited by numerous throngs.    _3. Prayer for Rain_    Prayers for rain afford such a common illustration of the relation of  Buddhism to the life of the peasant that a detailed presentation of such  a service may be of seal value.    During a prolonged drought in some district of China, when the heat  opens gaping cracks in the fields and the grain is drying up, the  populace may visit their highest official and apprise him of the dire  situation. He often forbids the slaughter of all animals for three days  and, in case rain has not thereby come, he goes in person or sends a  deputy to the nearest monastery to direct the monks to pray for rain.    _(a) The Altar._--On such an occasion the great hall of the Law may  be used for the ceremony. Quite often a special altar is erected in an  enclosure near the monastery on a platform one foot high and twenty-five  feet on each side, overspread by a tent of green cloth. In the center  seats are arranged for the presiding monk and his assistants. On each of  the four sides of the altar is placed an image of the Dragon King who is  supposed to control the rain. If an image is not obtainable a piece of  paper inscribed with the name of the dragon may be used. Flowers, fruits  and incense are spread before the images. On the doors of the tent are  painted dragons with clouds. The tent and altar are green and the monks  wear green garments, because green belongs to the spring and suggests  rain. For this ceremony the monks prepare themselves by abstinence and  cleansing. The presiding monk is one of high moral character and  religious fervor. While some monks recite appropriate sutras, two others  look after the offerings, the incense, and the sprinkling of water  during the ceremony to suggest the coming of rain. The services continue  day and night, being conducted by groups of monks in succession.    _(b) The Prayer Service._--The ceremonial is opened by a chant as  follows:    \"Pearly dew of the jade heavens, golden waves of Buddha's ocean, scatter  the lotus flowers on a thousand thousand worlds of suffering, that the  heart of mercy may wash away great calamity, that a drop may become a  flood, that a drop may purify mountains and rivers.    \"We put our trust in the Bodhisattvas and Mahâsattvas that purify the  earth.\"    The chant ended, a monk takes a bowl of water and repeats thrice: \"We  put our trust in the great merciful Kuan Yin Bodhisattva.\" Then follows  the chant:    \"The Bodhisattva's sweet dew of the willow is able to make one drop  spread over the ten directions. It washes away the rank odors and dirt.  It keeps the altars clean and pure. The mysterious words of the doctrine  will be reverently repeated.\"    This chant ended, the monks intone incantations of Kuan Yin, quite  unintelligible even to them, but of magical value. While these are being  uttered, the presiding monk and his attendants walk around the altar,  while one of them with a branch sprinkles water on the floor. This  symbolizes the cleansing of the altar and of the monks from all  impurities which might render the ritual ineffective. When the  perambulating monks have returned to their place, while the sprinkler  continues his duties, the monks repeat the words: \"We put our trust in  the sweet dew kings, Bodhisattvas and Mahâsattvas.\"    The Bodhisattvas have now come to the purified altar and while the abbot  offers incense to them, the monks repeat the words:    \"The fields are destroyed so that they resemble the back of a tortoise.  The demons of drought produce calamity. The dark people [Footnote: A  term denoting the Chinese.] pray earnestly while crops are being  destroyed. We pray that abundant, limpid liquid may descend to purify  and refresh the whole world. The clouds of incense rise.\"    This plaint is repeated thrice and is followed by an invocation:    \"Wholeheartedly we cast ourselves to the earth, O Triratna, who dost  exist eternally in the realm of _dharma_ of the ten directions.\"    The leader remains quiet a long time with his eyes closed, visualizing  the Buddhas, the Bodhisattvas, the dragon kings, and the saints, all  with their heavenly eyes and ears knowing that this region is afflicted  with drought, that an altar has been constructed and that all have come  to make petition. This meditation is regarded as of chief importance. It  is followed by an announcement to the effect that the sutra praying for  rain was given by the Buddha, that a drought is afflicting the land,  that the altar has been erected in accordance with the regulations and  that prayer is being made for rain. But fearing that something may have  been overlooked, the magic formula of \"the king of light who turns the  wheel\" is read seven times so as to remedy such oversight.    The altar having thus been cleansed of all impurities, the rain sutra is  opened and the one hundred and eighty-eight dragon kings are urged by  name in groups of ten to take action. The formula is as follows:    \"We with our whole heart invite such and such dragon kings to come. We  desire that the heart and wisdom which knows others intuitively will  move the spirits above to obey the Buddha, to take pity on the people  below and to come to our province and send down sweet rain.\"    When the dragons have all been duly invited, the monks chant suitable  magical formulas, while the leader sits in meditation visualizing these  dragon kings and their tender solicitude for the people in distress. The  monastery bell is sounded and the wooden fish is beaten, while drums and  cymbals add their effect. The whole is intended to draw the attention of  the dragon kings to the drought. Then the fifty-four Buddhas are invited  in a similar manner in groups of ten, the sixth group consisting of  four. A similar form of address is used and similar magical formulas are  recited with the noisy accompaniment. The ceremony concludes by the  expression of the hope that the three jewels (Buddha, the Law and the  Community of Monks) and the dragon kings will grant the rain.    Upon the altar are four copies of an announcement to the dragon kings  and Buddhas. On the first day three copies are sent to them through the  flames, one to the Buddhas, one to the dragon kings and one to the  devas. One copy is read daily and then sent up at the thanksgiving  ceremony. The announcement is as follows:    \"We put our trust in the limitless, reverent ocean clouds, the dragons  of august virtue and all their host, all dragon kings and holy saints.  Their august virtue is difficult to measure. In accord with the command  of Buddha they send liquid rain. May their quiet mercy descend to the  altar; may they send down purity and freshness, spreading over the ten  directions. We put our trust in the company of dragon kings of the  clouds, the saints and the Bodhisattvas.\"    The offerings are made only in the morning inasmuch as the Buddhas,  following ancient custom, are not supposed to eat after the noonday  meal. Great care is taken that the altar shall not be desecrated by any  one who eats meat or drinks wine. The magic formulas of great mercy are  uttered or the name of Kuan Yin is repeated a thousand times. The monks,  take turn in these services which continue day and night until rain  comes.    _(c) Its Meaning._--In the religious consciousness of the people is  the idea that the drought is a punishment for sin. The altar is made  pure and acceptable and sin is removed in various symbolic ways. This  fits in with the idea that man is an intimate part of the world order.  His sin disturbs the order of nature. Heaven manifests displeasures by  sending down calamities upon men. Men should cease their wrongdoing  which disturbs the natural order and should also wash away the effects  of their sins. The services for rain with their magic formulas help to  clear away the consequences of sin and to predispose Heaven to grant its  blessings again.    _4. Monasteries Are Supported Because They Control Fêng-shui_    The prayers for rain are an important part of the Chinese peasant's  world order. Drought is the manifestation of Heaven's displeasure at the  infraction of Heaven's laws. It calls for self-examination and  repentance. Thus the monastery opens up the windows of the universal  order as this touches the humble tiller of the soil.    The Buddhist monasteries not only hold services in time of drought, but  also in time of flood and at times when plagues of grasshoppers afflict  the land, or when diseases afflict human beings. Their adoption of  Chinese customs led them to have special ceremonies at the eclipse of  the sun and moon, although they knew the cause of the eclipse. Peasants  and officials support the monastery because of these services regulating  the wind and water influences and through them bringing the people into  harmonious relation with the great world of spirits.              BUDDHISM AND THE FAMILY    One of the criticisms of the Chinese against Buddhism is that it is  opposed to filial piety. According to Mencius the greatest unfilial act  is to leave no progeny. In spite of this charge Buddhism "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8395"],[0,"The Gods of Pegana (#6)"],[1,"ness, and there was light upon  the Worlds, and Mung trod no longer in the garden, Kabok forgot  his fears, and said: \"Perhaps it was but a herd of cattle that  stampeded in the garden of Kabok.\"    And Kabok went about his business, which was that of knowing All  Things, and telling All Things unto men, and making light of Mung.    But that night Mung trod again in the garden of Kabok, about his  house at night, and stood before the window of the house like a  shadow standing erect, so that Kabok knew indeed that it was Mung.    And a great fear fell upon the throat of Kabok, so that his speech  was hoarse; and he cried out: \"Thou art Mung!\"    And Mung slightly inclined his head, and went on to tread in the  garden of Kabok, about his house at night.    And Kabok lay and listened with horror at his heart.    But when the second morning grew to brightness, and there was  light upon the Worlds, Mung went from treading in the garden of  Kabok; and for a little while Kabok hoped, but looked with great  dread for the coming of the third night.    And when the third night was come, and the bat had gone to his  home, and the wind had sank, the night was very still.    And Kabok lay and listened, to whom the wings of the night flew  very slow.    But, ere night met the morning upon the highway between Pegana and  the Worlds, there came the tread of Mung in the garden of Kabok  towards Kabok's door.    And Kabok fled out of his house as flees a hunted beast and flung  himself before Mung.    And Mung made the sign of Mung, pointing towards THE END.    And the fears of Kabok had rest from troubling Kabok any more, for  they and he were among accomplished things.        OF THE CALAMITY THAT BEFEL YUN-ILARA BY THE SEA, AND OF THE  BUILDING OF THE TOWER OF THE ENDING OF DAYS      When Kabok and his fears had rest the people sought a prophet who  should have no fear of Mung, whose hand was against the prophets.    And at last they found Yun-Ilara, who tended sheep and had no fear  of Mung, and the people brought him to the town that he might be  their prophet.    And Yun-Ilara builded a tower towards the sea that looked upon the  setting of the Sun. And he called it the Tower of the Ending of  Days.    And about the ending of the day would Yun-Ilara go up to his  tower's top and look towards the setting of the Sun to cry his  curses against Mung, crying: \"O Mung! whose hand is against the  Sun, whom men abhor but worship because they fear thee, here stands  and speaks a man who fears thee not. Assassin lord of murder and  dark things, abhorrent, merciless, make thou the sign of Mung  against me when thou wilt, but until silence settles upon my lips,  because of the sign of Mung, I will curse Mung to his face.\" And  the people in the street below would gaze up with wonder towards  Yun-Ilara, who had no fear of Mung, and brought him gifts; only in  their homes after the falling of the night would they pray again  with reverence to Mung. But Mung said: \"Shall a man curse a god?\"    And still Mung came not nigh to Yun-Ilara as he cried his curses  against Mung from his tower towards the sea.    And Sish throughout the Worlds hurled Time away, and slew the  Hours that had served him well, and called up more out of the  timeless waste that lieth beyond the Worlds, and drave them forth  to assail all things. And Sish cast a whiteness over the hairs of  Yun-Ilara, and ivy about his tower, and weariness over his limbs,  for Mung passed by him still.    And when Sish became a god less durable to Yun-Ilara than ever  Mung hath been he ceased at last to cry from his tower's top his  curses against Mung whenever the sun went down, till there came  the day when weariness of the gift of Kib fell heavily upon  Yun-Ilara.    Then from the tower of the Ending of Days did Yun-Ilara cry out  thus to Mung, crying: \"O Mung! O loveliest of the gods! O Mung,  most dearly to be desired! thy gift of Death is the heritage of  Man, with ease and rest and silence and returning to the Earth.  Kib giveth but toil and trouble; and Sish, he sendeth regrets with  each of his hours wherewith he assails the World. Yoharneth-Lahai  cometh nigh no more. I can no longer be glad with Limpang-Tung.  When the other gods forsake him a man hath only Mung.\"    But Mung said: \"Shall a man curse a god?\"    And every day and all night long did Yun-Ilara cry aloud: \"Ah, now  for the hour of the mourning of many, and the pleasant garlands of  flowers and the tears, and the moist, dark earth. Ah, for repose  down underneath the grass, where the firm feet of the trees grip  hold upon the world, where never shall come the wind that now blows  through my bones, and the rain shall come warm and trickling, not  driven by storm, where is the easeful falling asunder of bone from  bone in the dark.\" Thus prayed Yun-Ilara, who had cursed in his  folly and youth, while never heeded Mung.    Still from a heap of bones that are Yun-Ilara still, lying about  the ruined base of the tower that once he builded, goes up a  shrill voice with the wind crying out for the mercy of Mung, if  any such there be.        OF HOW THE GODS WHELMED SIDITH      There was dole in the valley of Sidith. For three years there had  been pestilence, and in the last of the three a famine; moreover,  there was imminence of war.    Throughout all Sidith men died night and day, and night and day  within the Temple of All the gods save One (for none may pray to  MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI) did the priests of the gods pray hard.    For they said: \"For a long while a man may hear the droning of  little insects and yet not be aware that he hath heard them, so  may the gods not hear our prayers at first until they have been  very oft repeated. But when your praying has troubled the silence  long it may be that some god as he strolls in Pegana's glades may  come on one of our lost prayers, that flutters like a butterfly  tossed in storm when all its wings are broken; then if the gods be  merciful they may ease our fears in Sidith, or else they may crush  us, being petulant gods, and so we shall see trouble in Sidith no  longer, with its pestilence and dearth and fears of war.\"    But in the fourth year of the pestilence and in the second year  of the famine, and while still there was imminence of war, came  all the people of Sidith to the door of the Temple of All the gods  save One, where none may enter but the priests--but only leave  gifts and go.    And there the people cried out: \"O High Prophet of All the gods  save One, Priest of Kib, Priest of Sish, and Priest of Mung,  Teller of the mysteries of Dorozhand, Receiver of the gifts of the  People, and Lord of Prayer, what doest thou within the Temple of  All the gods save One?\"    And Arb-Rin-Hadith, who was the High Prophet, answered: \"I pray for  all the People.\"    But the people answered: \"O High Prophet of All the gods save One,  Priest of Kib, Priest of Sish, and Priest of Mung, Teller of the  mysteries of Dorozhand, Receiver of the gifts of the People, and  Lord of Prayer, for four long years hast thou prayed with the  priests of all thine order, while we brought ye gifts and died.  Now, therefore, since They have not heard thee in four grim years,  thou must go and carry to Their faces the prayer of the people of  Sidith when They go to drive the thunder to his pasture upon the  mountain Aghrinaun, or else there shall no longer be gifts upon  thy temple door, whenever falls the dew, that thou and thine order  may fatten.    \"Then thou shalt say before Their faces: 'O All the gods save One,  Lords of the Worlds, whose child is the eclipse, take back thy  pestilence from Sidith, for ye have played the game of the gods  too long with the people of Sidith, who would fain have done with  the gods'.\"    Then in great fear answered the High Prophet, saying: \"What if the  gods be angry and whelm Sidith?\" And the people answered: \"Then are  we sooner done with pestilence and famine and the imminence of war.\"    That night the thunder howled upon Aghrinaun, which stood a peak above  all others in the land of Sidith. And the people took Arb-Rin-Hadith  from his Temple and drave him to Aghrinaun, for they said: \"There walk  to-night upon the mountain All the gods save One.\"    And Arb-Rin-Hadith went trembling to the gods.    Next morning, white and frightened from Aghrinaun, came Arb-Rin-Hadith  back into the valley, and there spake to the people, saying: \"The  faces of the gods are iron and their mouths set hard. There is no  hope from the gods.\"    Then said the people: \"Thou shalt go to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, to whom  no man may pray: seek him upon Aghrinaun where it lifts clear into  the stillness before morning, and on its summit, where all things  seem to rest surely there rests also MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI. Go to him,  and say: 'Thou hast made evil gods, and They smite Sidith.'  Perchance he hath forgotten all his gods, or hath not heard of  Sidith. Thou hast escaped the thunder of the gods, surely thou  shalt also escape the stillness of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.\"    Upon a morning when the sky and lakes were clear and the world  still, and Aghrinaun was stiller than the world, Arb-Rin-Hadith  crept in fear towards the slopes of Aghrinaun because the people  were urgent.    All that day men saw him climbing. At night he rested near the  top. But ere the morning of the day that followed, such as rose  early saw him in the silence, a speck against the blue, stretch up  his arms upon the summit to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI. Then instantly they  saw him not, nor was he ever seen of men again who had dared to  trouble the stillness of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.    Such as now speak of Sidith tell of a fierce and potent tribe  that smote away a people in a valley enfeebled by pestilence,  where stood a temple to \"All the gods save One\" in which was no  high priest.
