I felt  that I should be unable to sleep, with that bestial thing haunting the  shrubberies, and yet, when evening fell, I had seen nothing. Then, as I  turned homeward, I heard a short, unintelligible noise, among the bushes  to my right. Instantly, I turned, and, aiming quickly, fired in the  direction of the sound. Immediately afterward, I heard something  scuttling away among the bushes. It moved rapidly, and in a minute had  gone out of hearing. After a few steps I ceased my pursuit, realizing  how futile it must be in the fast gathering gloom; and so, with a  curious feeling of depression, I entered the house.    That night, after my sister had gone to bed, I went 'round to all the  windows and doors on the ground floor; and saw to it that they were  securely fastened. This precaution was scarcely necessary as regards the  windows, as all of those on the lower storey are strongly barred; but  with the doors--of which there are five--it was wisely thought, as not  one was locked.    Having secured these, I went to my study, yet, somehow, for once, the  place jarred upon me; it seemed so huge and echoey. For some time I  tried to read; but at last finding it impossible I carried my book down  to the kitchen where a large fire was burning, and sat there.    I dare say, I had read for a couple of hours, when, suddenly, I heard a  sound that made me lower my book, and listen, intently. It was a noise  of something rubbing and fumbling against the back door. Once the door  creaked, loudly; as though force were being applied to it. During those  few, short moments, I experienced an indescribable feeling of terror,  such as I should have believed impossible. My hands shook; a cold sweat  broke out on me, and I shivered violently.    Gradually, I calmed. The stealthy movements outside had ceased.    Then for an hour I sat silent and watchful. All at once the feeling of  fear took me again. I felt as I imagine an animal must, under the eye of  a snake. Yet now I could hear nothing. Still, there was no doubting that  some unexplained influence was at work.    Gradually, imperceptibly almost, something stole on my ear--a sound  that resolved itself into a faint murmur. Quickly it developed and grew  into a muffled but hideous chorus of bestial shrieks. It appeared to  rise from the bowels of the earth.    I heard a thud, and realized in a dull, half comprehending way that I  had dropped my book. After that, I just sat; and thus the daylight found  me, when it crept wanly in through the barred, high windows of the  great kitchen.    With the dawning light, the feeling of stupor and fear left me; and I  came more into possession of my senses.    Thereupon I picked up my book, and crept to the door to listen. Not a  sound broke the chilly silence. For some minutes I stood there; then,  very gradually and cautiously, I drew back the bolt and opening the door  peeped out.    My caution was unneeded. Nothing was to be seen, save the grey vista of  dreary, tangled bushes and trees, extending to the distant plantation.    With a shiver, I closed the door, and made my way, quietly, up to bed.        _VI_    THE SWINE-THINGS    It was evening, a week later. My sister sat in the garden, knitting. I  was walking up and down, reading. My gun leant up against the wall of  the house; for, since the advent of that strange thing in the gardens, I  had deemed it wise to take precautions. Yet, through the whole week,  there had been nothing to alarm me, either by sight or sound; so that I  was able to look back, calmly, to the incident; though still with a  sense of unmitigated wonder and curiosity.    I was, as I have just said, walking up and down, and somewhat engrossed  in my book. Suddenly, I heard a crash, away in the direction of the Pit.  With a quick movement, I turned and saw a tremendous column of dust  rising high into the evening air.    My sister had risen to her feet, with a sharp exclamation of surprise  and fright.    Telling her to stay where she was, I snatched up my gun, and ran toward  the Pit. As I neared it, I heard a dull, rumbling sound, that grew  quickly into a roar, split with deeper crashes, and up from the Pit  drove a fresh volume of dust.    The noise ceased, though the dust still rose, tumultuously.    I reached the edge, and looked down; but could see nothing save a boil  of dust clouds swirling hither and thither. The air was so full of the  small particles, that they blinded and choked me; and, finally, I had to  run out from the smother, to breathe.    Gradually, the suspended matter sank, and hung in a panoply over the  mouth of the Pit.    I could only guess at what had happened.    That there had been a land-slip of some kind, I had little doubt; but  the cause was beyond my knowledge; and yet, even then, I had half  imaginings; for, already, the thought had come to me, of those falling  rocks, and that Thing in the bottom of the Pit; but, in the first  minutes of confusion, I failed to reach the natural conclusion, to which  the catastrophe pointed.    Slowly, the dust subsided, until, presently, I was able to approach the  edge, and look down.    For a while, I peered impotently, trying to see through the reek. At  first, it was impossible to make out anything. Then, as I stared, I saw  something below, to my left, that moved. I looked intently toward it,  and, presently, made out another, and then another--three dim shapes  that appeared to be climbing up the side of the Pit. I could see them  only indistinctly. Even as I stared and wondered, I heard a rattle of  stones, somewhere to my right. I glanced across; but could see nothing.  I leant forward, and peered over, and down into the Pit, just beneath  where I stood; and saw no further than a hideous, white swine-face, that  had risen to within a couple of yards of my feet. Below it, I could make  out several others. As the Thing saw me, it gave a sudden, uncouth  squeal, which was answered from all parts of the Pit. At that, a gust of  horror and fear took me, and, bending down, I discharged my gun right  into its face. Straightway, the creature disappeared, with a clatter of  loose earth and stones.    There was a momentary silence, to which, probably, I owe my life; for,  during it, I heard a quick patter of many feet, and, turning sharply,  saw a troop of the creatures coming toward me, at a run. Instantly, I  raised my gun and fired at the foremost, who plunged head-long, with a  hideous howling. Then, I turned to run. More than halfway from the house  to the Pit, I saw my sister--she was coming toward me. I could not see  her face, distinctly, as the dusk had fallen; but there was fear in her  voice as she called to know why I was shooting.    'Run!' I shouted in reply. 'Run for your life!'    Without more ado, she turned and fled--picking up her skirts with both  hands. As I followed, I gave a glance behind. The brutes were running on  their hind legs--at times dropping on all fours.    I think it must have been the terror in my voice, that spurred Mary to  run so; for I feel convinced that she had not, as yet, seen those hell  creatures that pursued.    On we went, my sister leading.    Each moment, the nearing sounds of the footsteps, told me that the  brutes were gaining on us, rapidly. Fortunately, I am accustomed to  live, in some ways, an active life. As it was, the strain of the race  was beginning to tell severely upon me.    Ahead, I could see the back door--luckily it was open. I was some  half-dozen yards behind Mary, now, and my breath was sobbing in my  throat. Then, something touched my shoulder. I wrenched my head 'round,  quickly, and saw one of those monstrous, pallid faces close to mine. One  of the creatures, having outrun its companions, had almost overtaken me.  Even as I turned, it made a fresh grab. With a sudden effort, I sprang  to one side, and, swinging my gun by the barrel, brought it crashing  down upon the foul creature's head. The Thing dropped, with an almost  human groan.    Even this short delay had been nearly sufficient to bring the rest of  the brutes down upon me; so that, without an instant's waste of time, I  turned and ran for the door.    Reaching it, I burst into the passage; then, turning quickly, slammed  and bolted the door, just as the first of the creatures rushed against  it, with a sudden shock.    My sister sat, gasping, in a chair. She seemed in a fainting condition;  but I had no time then to spend on her. I had to make sure that all the  doors were fastened. Fortunately, they were. The one leading from my  study into the gardens, was the last to which I went. I had just had  time to note that it was secured, when I thought I heard a noise  outside. I stood perfectly silent, and listened. Yes! Now I could  distinctly hear a sound of whispering, and something slithered over the  panels, with a rasping, scratchy noise. Evidently, some of the brutes  were feeling with their claw-hands, about the door, to discover whether  there were any means of ingress.    That the creatures should so soon have found the door was--to me--a  proof of their reasoning capabilities. It assured me that they must not  be regarded, by any means, as mere animals. I had felt something of this  before, when that first Thing peered in through my window. Then I had  applied the term superhuman to it, with an almost instinctive knowledge  that the creature was something different from the brute-beast.  Something beyond human; yet in no good sense; but rather as something  foul and hostile to the _great_ and _good_ in humanity. In a word, as  something intelligent, and yet inhuman. The very thought of the  creatures filled me with revulsion.    Now, I bethought me of my sister, and, going to the cupboard, I got  out a flask of brandy, and a wine-glass. Taking these, I went down to  the kitchen, carrying a lighted candle with me.
