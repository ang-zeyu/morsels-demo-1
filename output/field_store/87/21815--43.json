II, 7); 'The fetter of the heart is broken, all  doubts are solved and all his works perish when he has been beheld who  is high and low' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8); 'He knows Brahman, he becomes  Brahman only' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9); 'Knowing him only a man passes over  death; there is no other path to go' (Svet. Up. III, 8). In these and  similar passages, the term 'death' denotes Nescience; analogously to the  use of the term in the following words of Sanatsujâta, 'Delusion I call  death; and freedom from delusion I call immortality' (Sanatsuj. II, 5).  The knowledge again of the essential unity and non-difference of Brahman--  which is ascertained from decisive texts such as 'The True, knowledge,  the Infinite is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'Knowledge, bliss is  Brahman' (Bri. Up. III, 9, 28)--is confirmed by other passages, such as  'Now if a man meditates on another deity, thinking the deity is one and  he another, he does not know' (Bri. Up. I, 4, 10); 'Let men meditate  upon him as the Self (Bri. Up. I, 4, 7); 'Thou art that' (Ch. Up. VI, 8,  7); 'Am I thou, O holy deity? and art thou me, O holy deity?'; 'What I  am that is he; what he is that am I.'--This the Sûtrakâra himself will  declare 'But as the Self (scriptural texts) acknowledge and make us  apprehend (the Lord)' (Ve. Sû. IV, 1, 3). Thus the Vâkyakâra also, 'It  is the Self--thus one should apprehend (everything), for everything is  effected by that.' And to hold that by such cognition of the oneness of  Brahman essentially false bondage, together with its cause, comes to an  end, is only reasonable.    Scripture is of greater force than Perception    But, an objection is raised--how can knowledge, springing from the  sacred texts, bring about a cessation of the view of difference, in  manifest opposition to the evidence of Perception?--How then, we rejoin,  can the knowledge that this thing is a rope and not a snake bring about,  in opposition to actual perception, the cessation of the (idea of the)  snake?--You will perhaps reply that in this latter case there is a  conflict between two forms of perception, while in the case under  discussion the conflict is between direct perception and Scripture which  is based on perception. But against this we would ask the question how,  in the case of a conflict between two equal cognitions, we decide as to  which of the two is refuted (sublated) by the other. If--as is to be  expected--you reply that what makes the difference between the two is  that one of them is due to a defective cause while the other is not: we  point out that this distinction holds good also in the case of Scripture  and perception being in conflict. It is not considerations as to the  equality of conflicting cognitions, as to their being dependent or  independent, and so on, that determine which of the two sublates the  other; if that were the case, the perception which presents to us the  flame of the lamp as one only would not be sublated by the cognition  arrived at by inference that there is a succession of different flames.  Wherever there is a conflict between cognitions based on two different  means of knowledge we assign the position of the 'sublated one' to that  which admits of being accounted for in some other way; while that  cognition which affords no opening for being held unauthoritative and  cannot be accounted for in another way, is the 'sublating one [FOOTNOTE  25:1].' This is the principle on which the relation between 'what  sublates' and 'what is sublated' is decided everywhere. Now apprehension  of Brahman--which is mere intelligence, eternal, pure, free,  self-luminous--is effected by Scripture which rests on endless unbroken  tradition, cannot therefore be suspected of any, even the least,  imperfection, and hence cannot be non-authoritative; the state of  bondage, on the other hand, with its manifold distinctions is proved by  Perception, Inference, and so on, which are capable of imperfections and  therefore may be non-authoritative. It is therefore reasonable to  conclude that the state of bondage is put an end to by the apprehension  of Brahman. And that imperfection of which Perception--through which we  apprehend a world of manifold distinctions--may be assumed to be  capable, is so-called Nescience, which consists in the beginningless  wrong imagination of difference.--Well then--a further objection is  raised--let us admit that Scripture is perfect because resting on an  endless unbroken tradition; but must we then not admit that texts  evidently presupposing the view of duality, as e.g. 'Let him who desires  the heavenly world offer the Jyotishtoma-sacrifice'--are liable to  refutation?--True, we reply. As in the case of the Udgâtri and  Pratihartri breaking the chain (not at the same time, but) in  succession [FOOTNOTE 26:1], so here also the earlier texts (which refer  to duality and transitory rewards) are sublated by the later texts which  teach final release, and are not themselves sublated by anything else.    The texts which represent Brahman as devoid of qualities have greater  force    The same reasoning applies to those passages in the Vedânta-texts which  inculcate meditation on the qualified Brahman, since the highest Brahman  is without any qualities.--But consider such passages as 'He who  cognises all, who knows all' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9); 'His high power is  revealed as manifold, as essential, acting as force and knowledge' (Svet.  Up. VI, 8); 'He whose wishes are true, whose purposes are true' (Ch. Up.  VIII, 1, 5); how can these passages, which clearly aim at defining the  nature of Brahman, be liable to refutation?--Owing to the greater weight,  we reply, of those texts which set forth Brahman as devoid of qualities.  'It is not coarse, not fine, not short, not long' (Bri. Up. III, 8, 8);  'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'That  which is free from qualities,' 'that which is free from stain'--these  and similar texts convey the notion of Brahman being changeless, eternal  intelligence devoid of all difference; while the other texts--quoted  before--teach the qualified Brahman. And there being a conflict between  the two sets of passages, we--according to the Mîmâmsâ principle  referred to above--decide that the texts referring to Brahman as devoid  of qualities are of greater force, because they are later in order  [FOOTNOTE 27:1] than those which speak of Brahman as having qualities.  Thus everything is settled. The text Taitt. Up. II, 1 refers to Brahman  as devoid of qualities.    But--an objection is raised--even the passage 'The True, knowledge,  infinite is Brahman' intimates certain qualities of Brahman, viz. true  being, knowledge, infinity!--Not so, we reply. From the circumstance  that all the terms of the sentence stand in co-ordination, it follows  that they convey the idea of one matter (sense) only. If against this  you urge that the sentence may convey the idea of one matter only, even  if directly expressing a thing distinguished by several qualities; we  must remark that you display an ignorance of the meaning of language  which appears to point to some weakmindedness on your part. A sentence  conveys the idea of one matter (sense) only when all its constitutive  words denote one and the same thing; if, on the other hand, it expresses  a thing possessing several attributes, the difference of these  attributes necessarily leads to a difference in meaning on the part of  the individual words, and then the oneness of meaning of the sentence is  lost.--But from your view of the passage it would follow that the  several words are mere synonyms!--Give us your attention, we reply, and  learn that several words may convey one meaning without being idle  synonyms. From the determination of the unity of purport of the whole  sentence [FOOTNOTE 27:2] we conclude that the several words, applied to  one thing, aim at expressing what is opposite in nature to whatever is  contrary to the meanings of the several words, and that thus they have  meaning and unity of meaning and yet are not mere synonyms. The details  are as follows. Brahman is to be defined as what is contrary in nature  to all other things. Now whatever is opposed to Brahman is virtually set  aside by the three words (constituting the definition of Brahman in the  Taittiriya-text). The word 'true' (or 'truly being') has the purport of  distinguishing Brahman from whatever things have no truth, as being the  abodes of change; the word 'knowledge' distinguishes Brahman from all  non-sentient things whose light depends on something else (which are not  self-luminous); and the word 'infinite' distinguishes it from whatever  is limited in time or space or nature. Nor is this 'distinction' some  positive or negative attribute of Brahman, it rather is just Brahman  itself as opposed to everything else; just as the distinction of white  colour from black and other colours is just the true nature of white,  not an attribute of it. The three words constituting the text thus _have_  a meaning, have _one_ meaning, and are non-synonymous, in so far as they  convey the essential distinction of one thing, viz. Brahman from  everything else. The text thus declares the one Brahman which is  self-luminous and free from all difference. On this interpretation of  the text we discern its oneness in purport with other texts, such as  'Being only this was in the beginning, one only, without a second.'  Texts such as 'That from whence these beings are born' (Taitt. Up. III,  1); 'Being only this was in the beginning' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 1); 'Self  alone was this in the beginning' (Bri. Up. I, 4, 1), &c., describe  Brahman as the cause of the world; and of this Brahman the Taittirîya  passage 'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman' gives the strict  definition.    In agreement with the principle that all sâkhâs teach the same doctrine  we have to understand that, in all "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7298"],[0,"William Tell Told Again (#6)"],[1,"   Friesshardt and Leuthold got up, saluted, and limped slowly towards  him. They halted beside his horse, and stood to attention. The tears  trickled down their cheeks.    \"Come, come, come!\" said Gessler; \"tell me all about it.\"    [Illustration: PLATE IX]    And he patted Friesshardt on the head. Friesshardt bellowed.    Gessler beckoned to one of his courtiers.    \"Have you a handkerchief?\" he said.    \"I have a handkerchief, your Excellency.\"    \"Then dry this man's eyes.\"    The courtier did as he was bidden.    \"_Now_,\" said Gessler, when the drying was done, and Friesshardt's  tears had ceased, \"what has been happening here? I heard a cry of  'Help!' as I came up. Who cried 'Help!'?\"    \"Please, your lordship's noble Excellencyship,\" said Friesshardt, \"it  was me, Friesshardt.\"    \"You should say, 'It was I,'\" said Gessler. \"Proceed.\"    \"Which I am a loyal servant of your Excellency's, and in your  Excellency's army, and seeing as how I was told to stand by this 'ere  pole and guard that there hat, I stood by this 'ere pole, and guarded  that there hat--all day, I did, your Excellency. And then up comes this  man here, and I says to him--'Bow down to the hat,' I says. 'Ho!' he  says to me--'ho, indeed!' and he passed on without so much as nodding.  So I takes my pike, and I taps him on the head to remind him, as you  may say, that there was something he was forgetting, and he ups and  hits me, he does. And then the crowd runs up with their sticks and hits  me and Leuthold cruel, your Excellency. And while we was a-fighting  with them, this here man I'm a-telling you about, your Excellency, he  outs with an arrow, puts it into his bow, and sends it through the hat,  and I don't see how you'll ever be able to wear it again. It's a waste  of a good hat, your Excellency--that's what it is. And then the people,  they puts me and Leuthold on the ground, and hoists this here man--Tell,  they call him--up on their shoulders, and he starts making a speech,  when up you comes, your Excellency. That's how it all was.\"    Gessler turned pale with rage, and glared fiercely at Tell, who stood  before him in the grasp of two of the bodyguard.    \"Ah,\" he said, \"Tell, is it? Good-day to you, Tell. I think we've met  before, Tell? Eh, Tell?\"    \"We have, your Excellency. It was in the ravine of Schaechenthal,\" said  Tell firmly.    \"Your memory is good, Tell. So is mine. I think you made a few remarks  to me on that occasion, Tell--a few chatty remarks? Eh, Tell?\"    \"Very possibly, your Excellency.\"    \"You were hardly polite, Tell.\"    \"If I offended you I am sorry.\"    \"I am glad to hear it, Tell. I think you will be even sorrier before  long. So you've been ill-treating my soldiers, eh?\"    \"It was not I who touched them.\"    \"Oh, so you didn't touch them? Ah! But you defied my power by refusing  to bow down to the hat. I set up that hat to prove the people's  loyalty. I am afraid you are not loyal, Tell.\"    \"I was a little thoughtless, not disloyal. I passed the hat without  thinking.\"    \"You should always think, Tell. It is very dangerous not to do so. And  I suppose that you shot your arrow through the hat without thinking?\"    \"I was a little carried away by excitement, your Excellency.\"    \"Dear, dear! Carried away by excitement, were you? You must really be  more careful, Tell. One of these days you will be getting yourself into  trouble. But it seems to have been a very fine shot. You _are_ a  capital marksman, I believe?\"    \"Father's the best shot in all Switzerland,\" piped a youthful voice.  \"He can hit an apple on a tree a hundred yards away. I've seen him.  Can't you, father?\"    Walter, who had run away when the fighting began, had returned on  seeing his father in the hands of the soldiers.    Gessler turned a cold eye upon him.    \"Who is this?\" he asked.          CHAPTER XI      \"It is my son Walter, your Excellency,\" said Tell.    \"Your son? Indeed. This is very interesting. Have you any more  children?\"    \"I have one other boy.\"    \"And which of them do you love the most, eh?\"    \"I love them both alike, your Excellency.\"    \"Dear me! Quite a happy family. Now, listen to me, Tell. I know you are  fond of excitement, so I am going to try to give you a little. Your son  says that you can hit an apple on a tree a hundred yards away, and I am  sure you have every right to be very proud of such a feat.  Friesshardt!\"    \"Your Excellency?\"    \"Bring me an apple.\"    Friesshardt picked one up. Some apples had been thrown at him and  Leuthold earlier in the day, and there were several lying about.    \"Which I'm afraid as how it's a little bruised, your Excellency,\" he  said, \"having hit me on the helmet.\"    \"Thank you. I do not require it for eating purposes,\" said Gessler.  \"Now, Tell, I have here an apple--a simple apple, not over-ripe. I  should like to test that feat of yours. So take your bow--I see you  have it in your hand--and get ready to shoot. I am going to put this  apple on your son's head. He will be placed a hundred yards away from  you, and if you do not hit the apple with your first shot your life  shall pay forfeit.\"    [Illustration: PLATE X]    And he regarded Tell with a look of malicious triumph.    \"Your Excellency, it cannot be!\" cried Tell; \"the thing is too  monstrous. Perhaps your Excellency is pleased to jest. You cannot bid a  father shoot an apple from off his son's head! Consider, your  Excellency!\"    \"You shall shoot the apple from off the head of this boy,\" said Gessler  sternly. \"I do not jest. That is my will.\"    \"Sooner would I die,\" said Tell.    \"If you do not shoot you die with the boy. Come, come, Tell, why so  cautious? They always told me that you loved perilous enterprises, and  yet when I give you one you complain. I could understand anybody else  shrinking from the feat. But you! Hitting apples at a hundred yards is  child's play to you. And what does it matter where the apple is--whether  it is on a tree or on a boy's head? It is an apple just the same.  Proceed, Tell.\"    The crowd, seeing a discussion going on, had left the edge of the  meadow and clustered round to listen. A groan of dismay went up at the  Governor's words.    \"Down on your knees, boy,\" whispered Rudolph der Harras to Walter--\"down  on your knees, and beg his Excellency for your life.\"    \"I won't!\" said Walter stoutly.    \"Come,\" said Gessler, \"clear a path there--clear a path! Hurry  yourselves. I won't have this loitering. Look you, Tell: attend to me  for a moment. I find you in the middle of this meadow deliberately  defying my authority and making sport of my orders. I find you in the  act of stirring up discontent among my people with speeches. I might  have you executed without ceremony. But do I? No. Nobody shall say that  Hermann Gessler the Governor is not kind-hearted. I say to myself, 'I  will give this man one chance.' I place your fate in your own skilful  hands. How can a man complain of harsh treatment when he is made master  of his own fate? Besides, I don't ask you to do anything difficult. I  merely bid you perform what must be to you a simple shot. You boast of  your unerring aim. Now is the time to prove it. Clear the way there!\"    Walter Fuerst flung himself on his knees before the Governor.    \"Your Highness,\" he cried, \"none deny your power. Let it be mingled  with mercy. It is excellent, as an English poet will say in a few  hundred years, to have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous to  use it like a giant. Take the half of my possessions, but spare my  son-in-law.\"    But Walter Tell broke in impatiently, and bade his grandfather rise,  and not kneel to the tyrant.    \"Where must I stand?\" asked he. \"I'm not afraid. Father can hit a bird  upon the wing.\"    \"You see that lime-tree yonder,\" said Gessler to his soldiers; \"take  the boy and bind him to it.\"    \"I will not be bound!\" cried Walter. \"I am not afraid. I'll stand  still. I won't breathe. If you bind me I'll kick!\"    \"Let us bind your eyes, at least,\" said Rudolph der Harras.    \"Do you think I fear to see father shoot?\" said Walter. \"I won't stir  an eyelash. Father, show the tyrant how you can shoot. He thinks you're  going to miss. Isn't he an old donkey!\"    \"Very well, young man,\" muttered Gessler, \"we'll see who is laughing  five minutes from now.\" And once more he bade the crowd stand back and  leave a way clear for Tell to shoot.          CHAPTER XII      The crowd fell back, leaving a lane down which Walter walked, carrying  the apple. There was dead silence as he passed. Then the people began  to whisper excitedly to one another.    \"Shall this be done before our eyes?\" said Arnold of Melchthal to  Werner Stauffacher. \"Of what use was it that we swore an oath to rebel  if we permit this? Let us rise and slay the tyrant.\"    Werner Stauffacher, prudent man, scratched his chin thoughtfully.    \"We-e-ll,\" he said, \"you see, the difficulty is that we are not armed  and the soldiers _are_. There is nothing I should enjoy more than  slaying the tyrant, only I have an idea that the tyrant would slay us.  You see my point?\"    \"Why were we so slow!\" groaned Arnold. \"We should have risen before,  and then this would never have happened. Who was it that advised us to  delay?\"    \"We-e-ll,\" said Stauffacher (who had himself advised delay), \"I can't  quite remember at the moment, but I dare say you could find out by  looking up the minutes of our last meeting. I know the motion was  carried by a majority of two votes. See! Gessler grows impatient.\"    Gessler, who had been fidgeting on his horse for some time, now spoke  again, urging Tell to hurry.    \"Begin!\" he cried--\"begin!\"    \"Immediately,\" replied Tell, fitting the arrow to the string.    Gessler began to mock him once more.    \"You see now,\" he said, \"the danger of carrying arms. I don't know if  you have ever noticed it, but arrows very often recoil on the man who  carries them.
