[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10324"],[0,"Bull Hunter (#7)"],[1," things  lived, and where Bull could live more easily, also. Never had trees  seemed such beautiful and friendly things to him.    Once a thought stopped him completely. He was in a new world. He was  seeing everything for the first time. On other days he had gone out  with others. Under their guidance, not trusted to undertake an  expedition by himself, he looked at nothing until it was pointed out  to him, heard nothing that was not first called to his attention. He  had always wondered at the acuteness of the senses of all other men.  But now, looking on the mountains for himself, he decided, with a  start of the heart, that they were beautiful--beautiful and terrible  at once, with the reality that he had never found in his books. What  leveled spear of a knight, in the pages of romance, could equal the  invisible thrust of this wind?    He reached the timberline. Looking back, he saw the summit, a  brilliant line of white against a blue sky. Again the heart of Bull  Hunter leaped. Here was a great treasure that he had taken in with one  grasp of the eyes and which he could never lose!    He turned down the valley. Where it swerved out into the lower plain,  stood Johnstown, and there he was to cross the flight of Pete Reeve,  if Pete were indeed flying. But it was incredible that the man who had  struck down Uncle Bill Campbell should flee from any man or number  of men.    He had reached the bottom of the narrow valley. A dull noise came down  to him from the mountain in the lull of the wind. He looked up.    Far away, miles and miles, near the summit of Scalped Mountain, a  snaky form of mist was twisting swiftly down. He looked curiously. The  thing grew, traveling with great speed that increased with every  moment. It increased--it gained velocity--a snowslide!    He watched it in doubt. It was twisting like a snake down the farther  side of the mountain, but, in his experience, slides were as  treacherous as serpents. Bull started hastily for a low cliff that  stood up from the floor of the valley, clear of the trees.    He had not gone far when the wind fell away to a whisper, and a dull  roaring caught his ear. He looked back over his shoulder in alarm. A  great wall of white was shooting down the mountainside. The little  slide of surface snow, which had twisted across the surface of the old  snows of the winter, had been gaining in weight, in momentum, picking  up claws of shrubbery, teeth of stone, and eating through layer after  layer of the old snow, packed hard as ice. Now it was a roaring mass  with a front steadily increasing in height, and far away in the rear  it tossed up a tail of snow dust, a flying mist that gave Bull an  impression of speed greater than the main wall of the snow itself.    The noise grew amazingly, and coming in range of the opposite wall of  the valley, a low and steadily increasing thunder poured into the ears  of Bull. It was a fascinating thing to watch, and at this distance to  the side he was quite safe. But at the very moment that he reached  this decision, the front of the slide smashed with a noise like  volleyed canyon against the side of a hill, tossed immense arms of  white in the air, floundered, and then veered with the speed of an  express train rounding a curve and rocked away down the slope straight  for Bull. Turned cold with dread, he saw it hit the timberline with a  great crashing, and the dark forms of the trees were dashed up by the  running mass of stones and then swallowed in the boiling front of  the slide.    He waited to see no more, but dashed on for the saving cliff. Once his  back was turned it seemed that the slide gained speed. The immense  roaring literally leaped on him from behind, and in the roar, his  senses were drowned. He could feel his knees weaken and buckle, but  the cliff, now just before him, gave him fresh strength. But was the  cliff high enough? He hurried up to higher ground and flung himself  prostrate. The front of the slide was cutting down the heavily  forested slope as though the trees were blades of grass before a keen  scythe. The noise passed all description.    Once he thought the mass was changing direction. It put out a massive  arm to the left, licked down five hundred trees at a gulp, and then,  smashing its fist into a hillside, flung back into the valley floor,  tossing the great trees in its top and poured straight at him. He  watched it in one of those dazes during which one sees everything. The  whole body came like water down a chute, but one part of the front  wall spilled out ahead and then another, and then the top, overtaking  the rest, toppled crashing to the bottom. And so it rushed out of  sight beneath the cliff. But would it wash over the top?    The first answer was an impact that shook the ground under him, and  then he heard a noise like a huge ripping explosion. A dozen lofty  geysers of snow streamed up into the air, dazzling against the sun,  misty at the edges of each column, whose center was solid tons and  tons of snow. Old pines and spruces, their branches shaved away in the  tumult of the slide, were picked up and hurled like javelins over the  cliff; a shower of fragments beat on the body of Bull; and then the  main mass of snow washed up over the edge of the cliff in a great  mound, and the slide was ended.    He crawled slowly back to his feet. Far up the mountainside, beginning  in a point, the track of the slide swept down in a broadening scar,  black and raw, across forest and snow. Far down the valley the last  echoes of thunder were passing away to a murmur, and the valley floor,  beneath the cliff, was a mass of snow and tree trunks.    Bull took off the snowshoes and climbed along the valley wall until he  could descend to the clear floor beneath him. Then he headed down  toward Johnstown.    It was well past midday when he escaped the slide; it was the  beginning of night when, at the conclusion of that first heroic march,  he reached Johnstown. With hunger his stomach cleaved to his back, and  his knees were weak with the labor.    Stamping through the snow to the hotel he asked the idlers around the  stove, \"Has any of you gents seen a man named Pete Reeve pass through  this town?\"    They looked at him in amazement. He had closed the door behind him,  and now, with his battered hat pushed high on his head, he seemed  taller than the entrance--taller and as wide, a mountain of a man. The  efforts of the march had collected a continual frown on his forehead,  and as he peered about from face to face, no one for a moment was able  to answer, but each looked to his companion.    It was the proprietor who answered finally. Talk was his commercial  medium and staff of life. \"What sort of a looking man, captain?\"    Bull blinked at him. He was not used to honorary epithets such as  this, and he searched the face of the proprietor carefully to detect  mockery. To his surprise the other showed signs of what Bull dimly  recognized as fear. Fear of him--of Bull Hunter!    \"The way you look at me,\" said the other and laughed uneasily, \"I  figure it's pretty lucky that I ain't this here Pete Reeve. That  so, boys?\"    The boys joined in the laughter, but they kept it subdued, their eyes  upon the giant at the door. He was leaning against the wall, and the  sight of his outspread hand was far from reassuring.    But Bull went on to describe his man. \"Not very big; hands like the  claws of a bird's; iron-gray hair; quick ways.\" That was Uncle Bill's  description.    \"Sure he's been here,\" said the owner. \"I recognized him right off. He  was through about dusk. He came over the mountains and just got past  the summit, he said, before the storm hit. Lucky, eh?\" He looked at  the battered coat of Bull. \"Kind of appears like you mightn't of been  so lucky?\"    \"Me?\" asked Bull gently. \"Nope. I was at the timberline on the other  side about daybreak today.\"    There was a sudden and chilly silence; men looked at one another.  Obviously no man could have traveled that distance between dawn and  dark, but it was as well not to express disbelief to a man who could  tell a lie as big as his body.    \"I got to eat,\" said Bull.    The proprietor jumped out of his chair. \"I can fix you up, son.\"    He led the way, Bull following with his enormous strides, and, as the  floor creaked under him, the eyes of the others jerked after him,  stride by stride. It was beginning to seem possible that this man had  done what he said he had done. When the door slammed behind him and  his steps went creaking through the room beyond, a mutter of a hum  arose around the stove.    As a matter of fact it was the beginning of the great legend that was  finally to bulk around the name of the big man. And it was fitting  that the huge figure of Bull Hunter should have come upon the  attention of men in this way, descending out of the storm and the  mountains.    That he had done something historic was far from the mind of Bull as  he stalked into the dining room.    \"You sit right down here,\" his host was saying, placing a chair at the  table.    Bull tried the chair with his hand. It groaned and squeaked under the  weight. \"Chairs don't seem to be made for me,\" he said simply.  \"Besides I'm more used to sitting on the floor.\" He dropped to the  floor accordingly, with the effect of a small earthquake. The  proprietor stared, but he swallowed his astonishment. \"What you'd like  to eat is something hearty, I figure.\"    \"What you got?\" said Bull.    \"Well, Mrs. Jarney come in this morning with a dozen fresh eggs. Got  some prime bacon, too, and some jerky and--\"    \"That dozen eggs,\" said Bull thoughtfully, \"will start me, and then a  platter of bacon, and you might mix up a bowl of flapjacks. You ain't  got a quart or so of canned milk, partner?\"    The proprietor could only nod, for he dared not trust his voice.  Fleeing to the kitchen he repeated the prodigious order to his wife.  Then he circled by a back"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10338"],[0,"With the Turks in Palestine (#7)"],[1," too, and, Turkey having  declared a moratorium, cash was often unobtainable even by those who had  money in the banks, and much distress ensued.    As the defeated army was pouring in from the south, I decided to leave  Beersheba and go home. The roads and the fields were covered with dead  camels and horses and mules. Hundreds of soldiers were straggling in  disorder, many of them on leave but many deserting. Soon after the  defeat at the Canal several thousand soldiers deserted, but an amnesty  was declared and they returned to their regiments.    When I arrived at Jerusalem I found the city filled with soldiers.  Djemal Pasha had just returned from the desert, and his quarters were  guarded by a battery of two field guns. Nobody knew what to expect; some  thought that the country would have a little more freedom now that the  soldiery had lost its braggadocio, while others expected the lawlessness  that attends disorganization. I went to see Consul Glazebrook. He is a  true American, a Southerner, formerly a professor of theology at  Princeton. He was most earnest and devoted in behalf of the American  citizens that came under his care, rendering at Jerusalem the same sort  of service that Ambassador Morgenthau has rendered at Constantinople. He  was practically the only man who stood up for the poor, defenseless  people of the city. He received me kindly, and I told him what I knew of  conditions in the country, what I had heard among the Arabs, and of my  own fears and apprehensions. He was visibly impressed and he advised me  to see Captain Decker, of the U.S.S. Tennessee, who was then in Jaffa,  promising to write himself to the captain of my proposed visit.    I went to Jaffa the same day and after two days' delay succeeded in  seeing Captain Decker, with the further help of Mr. Glazebrook, who took  me with him. The police interfered and tried to keep me from going  aboard the ship, but after long discussions I was permitted to take my  place in the launch that the captain had sent for the consul.    Captain Decker was interested in what I had to say, and at his request I  dictated my story to his stenographer. What became of my report I do not  know,--whether it was transmitted to the Department of State or whether  Captain Decker communicated with Ambassador Morgenthau,--but at all  events we soon began to see certain reforms inaugurated in parts of the  country, and these reforms could have been effected only through  pressure from Constantinople. The presence of the two American cruisers  in the Mediterranean waters has without any doubt been instrumental in  the saving of many lives.          CHAPTER VII    FIGHTING THE LOCUSTS      While I was traveling in the south, another menace to our people's  welfare had appeared: the locusts. From the Soudan they came in  tremendous hosts--black clouds of them that obscured the sun. It seemed  as if Nature had joined in the conspiracy against us. These locusts were  of the species known as the pilgrim, or wandering, locust; for forty  years they had not come to Palestine, but now their visitation was like  that of which the prophet Joel speaks in the Old Testament. They came  full-grown, ripe for breeding; the ground was covered with the females  digging in the soil and depositing their egg-packets, and we knew that  when they hatched we should be overwhelmed, for there was not a foot of  ground in which these eggs were not to be found.    The menace was so great that even the military authorities were obliged  to take notice of it. They realized that if it were allowed to fulfill  itself, there would be famine in the land, and the army would suffer  with the rest. Djemal Pasha summoned my brother (the President of the  Agricultural Experiment Station at Athlit) and intrusted him with the  organization of a campaign against the insects. It was a hard enough  task. The Arabs are lazy, and fatalistic besides; they cannot understand  why men should attempt to fight the _Djesh Allah_ (\"God's Army\"), as  they call the locusts. In addition, my brother was seriously handicapped  by lack of petroleum, galvanized iron, and other articles which could  not be obtained because of the Allies' blockade.    In spite of these drawbacks, however, he attempted to work up a  scientific campaign. Djemal Pasha put some thousands of Arab soldiers at  his disposition, and these were set to work digging trenches into which  the hatching locusts were driven and destroyed. This is the only means  of coping with the situation: once the locusts get their wings, nothing  can be done with them. It was a hopeless fight. Nothing short of the  cooeperation of every farmer in the country could have won the day; and  while the people of the progressive Jewish villages struggled on to the  end,--men, women, and children working in the fields until they were  exhausted,--the Arab farmers sat by with folded hands. The threats of  the military authorities only stirred them to half-hearted efforts.  Finally, after two months of toil, the campaign was given up and the  locusts broke in waves over the countryside, destroying everything. As  the prophet Joel said, \"The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the  corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.... The  land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate  wilderness.\"    Not only was every green leaf devoured, but the very bark was peeled  from the trees, which stood out white and lifeless, like skeletons. The  fields were stripped to the ground, and the old men of our villages, who  had given their lives to cultivating these gardens and vineyards, came  out of the synagogues where they had been praying and wailing, and  looked on the ruin with dimmed eyes. Nothing was spared. The insects, in  their fierce hunger, tried to engulf everything in their way. I have  seen Arab babies, left by their mothers in the shade of some tree, whose  faces had been devoured by the oncoming swarms of locusts before their  screams had been heard. I have seen the carcasses of animals hidden from  sight by the undulating, rustling blanket of insects. And in the face of  such a menace the Arabs remained inert. With their customary fatalism  they accepted the locust plague as a necessary evil. They could not  understand why we were so frantic to fight it. And as a matter of fact,  they really got a good deal out of the locusts, for they loved to feast  upon the female insects. They gathered piles of them and threw them upon  burning charcoal, then, squatting around the fire, devoured the roasted  insects with great gusto. I saw a fourteen-year-old boy eat as many as a  hundred at a sitting.          CHAPTER VIII    THE LEBANON      During the locust invasion my brother sent me on an inspection tour to  investigate the ravages of the insect in Syria. With an official  _boyouroulton_ (passport) in my pocket, I was able to travel all over  the country without being interfered with by the military authorities. I  had an excellent opportunity to see what was going on everywhere. The  locusts had destroyed everything from as far south as the Egyptian  desert to the Lebanon Mountains on the north; but the locust was not the  only, nor the worst, plague that the people had to complain of. The  plundering under the name of \"military requisitions,\" the despotic rule  of the army officers, and the general insecurity were even more  desolating.    As I proceeded on my journey northward, I hoped to find consolation and  brighter prospects in the independent province of the Lebanon. Few  Americans know just what the Lebanon is. From the repeated allusions in  the Bible most people imagine it to be nothing but a mountain. The truth  is that a beautiful province of about four thousand square miles bears  that name. The population of the Lebanon consists of a Christian sect  called Maronites and the Druses, the latter a people with a secret  religion the esoteric teachings of which are known only to the  initiated, and never divulged to outsiders. Both these peoples are  sturdy, handsome folk. Through the machinations of the Turks, whose  policy is always to \"divide and rule,\" the Maronites were continually  fighting against the Druses. In 1860 Turkish troops joined with the  Druses and fell upon the Maronites with wholesale massacres that spread  as far south as Damascus, where ten thousand Christians were killed in  two days.    [ILLUSTRATION: THE CHRISTIAN TOWN OF ZAHLEH IN THE LEBANON]    The European powers were moved at last. Fifty warships were sent to  Beirut, and ten thousand French troops were landed in the Lebanon, to  create order. Under the pressure of the European powers the Sublime  Porte was forced to grant an autonomy for the province of the Lebanon.  The French, English, German, Russian, Austrian, and, a year later, the  Italian, Governments were signing the guaranty of this autonomy.    Since then the Lebanon has had peace. The Governor of the province must  always be a Christian, but the General Council of the Lebanon includes  representatives of all the different races and religions of the  population. A wonderful development began with the liberation from  Turkish oppression. Macadamized roads were built all over the province,  agriculture was improved, and there was complete safety for life and  property. There is a proverb now in Palestine and Syria which says, \"In  the Lebanon a virgin may travel alone at midnight and be safe, and a  purse of gold dropped in the road at midday will never be stolen.\" And  the proverb told the literal truth.    When one crossed the boundary from Turkish Palestine into the Lebanon  province, what a change met his eyes!--peaceful and prosperous villages,  schools filled with children, immense plantations of mulberry trees and  olives, the slopes of the mountains terraced with beautiful vineyards, a  handsome and sturdy population, police on every road to help the  stranger, and"]]]
