And he came unto him, and             said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich,             and the other poor.    10:012:002 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:    10:012:003 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which             he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with             him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and             drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him             as a daughter.    10:012:004 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to             take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the             wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's             lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.    10:012:005 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he             said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done             this thing shall surely die:    10:012:006 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this             thing, and because he had no pity.    10:012:007 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the             LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I             delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;    10:012:008 And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives             into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of             Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have             given unto thee such and such things.    10:012:009 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to             do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with             the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast             slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.    10:012:010 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;             because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of             Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.    10:012:011 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee             out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine             eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with             thy wives in the sight of this sun.    10:012:012 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before             all Israel, and before the sun.    10:012:013 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD.             And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy             sin; thou shalt not die.    10:012:014 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion             to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that             is born unto thee shall surely die.    10:012:015 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the             child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.    10:012:016 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,             and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.    10:012:017 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise             him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat             bread with them.    10:012:018 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.             And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child             was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet             alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our             voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the             child is dead?    10:012:019 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David             perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto             his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.    10:012:020 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed             himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of             the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and             when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.    10:012:021 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou             hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it             was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and             eat bread.    10:012:022 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:             for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me,             that the child may live?    10:012:023 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him             back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.    10:012:024 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,             and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name             Solomon: and the LORD loved him.    10:012:025 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called             his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.    10:012:026 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and             took the royal city.    10:012:027 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought             against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.    10:012:028 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and             encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city,             and it be called after my name.    10:012:029 And David gathered all the people together, and went to             Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.    10:012:030 And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight             whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it             was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the             city in great abundance.    10:012:031 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put             them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of             iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did             he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and             all the people returned unto Jerusalem.    10:013:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David             had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of             David loved her.    10:013:002 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister             Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him             to do anything to her.    10:013:003 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of             Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.    10:013:004 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean             from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto             him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.    10:013:005 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make             thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto             him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat,             and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it             at her hand.    10:013:006 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king             was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee,             let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my             sight, that I may eat at her hand.    10:013:007 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother             Amnon's house, and dress him meat.    10:013:008 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid             down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in             his sight, and did bake the cakes.    10:013:009 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he             refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And             they went out every man from him.    10:013:010 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber,             that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which             she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her             brother.    10:013:011 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of             her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.    10:013:012 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no             such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.    10:013:013 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,             thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I             pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me             from thee.    10:013:014 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being             stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.    10:013:015 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith             he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved             her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.    10:013:016 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending             me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But             he would not hearken unto her.    10:013:017 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,             Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.    10:013:018 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with             such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins             apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the             door after her.    10:013:019 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of             divers colours that was on her, and laid her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8018"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 18: Job (#6)"],[1,"his             branch be cut off.    18:018:017 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have             no name in the street.    18:018:018 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of             the world.    18:018:019 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any             remaining in his dwellings.    18:018:020 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they             that went before were affrighted.    18:018:021 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the             place of him that knoweth not God.    18:019:001 Then Job answered and said,    18:019:002 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with             words?    18:019:003 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that             ye make yourselves strange to me.    18:019:004 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with             myself.    18:019:005 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead             against me my reproach:    18:019:006 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me             with his net.    18:019:007 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud,             but there is no judgment.    18:019:008 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set             darkness in my paths.    18:019:009 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my             head.    18:019:010 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine             hope hath he removed like a tree.    18:019:011 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me             unto him as one of his enemies.    18:019:012 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me,             and encamp round about my tabernacle.    18:019:013 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are             verily estranged from me.    18:019:014 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have             forgotten me.    18:019:015 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a             stranger: I am an alien in their sight.    18:019:016 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him             with my mouth.    18:019:017 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the             children's sake of mine own body.    18:019:018 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake             against me.    18:019:019 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are             turned against me.    18:019:020 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped             with the skin of my teeth.    18:019:021 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the             hand of God hath touched me.    18:019:022 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my             flesh?    18:019:023 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed             in a book!    18:019:024 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock             for ever!    18:019:025 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at             the latter day upon the earth:    18:019:026 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my             flesh shall I see God:    18:019:027 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and             not another; though my reins be consumed within me.    18:019:028 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of             the matter is found in me?    18:019:029 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments             of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.    18:020:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,    18:020:002 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I             make haste.    18:020:003 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my             understanding causeth me to answer.    18:020:004 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,    18:020:005 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the             hypocrite but for a moment?    18:020:006 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head             reach unto the clouds;    18:020:007 Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which             have seen him shall say, Where is he?    18:020:008 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he             shall be chased away as a vision of the night.    18:020:009 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither             shall his place any more behold him.    18:020:010 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands             shall restore their goods.    18:020:011 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie             down with him in the dust.    18:020:012 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it             under his tongue;    18:020:013 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still             within his mouth:    18:020:014 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps             within him.    18:020:015 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up             again: God shall cast them out of his belly.    18:020:016 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall             slay him.    18:020:017 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey             and butter.    18:020:018 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not             swallow it down: according to his substance shall the             restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.    18:020:019 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because             he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;    18:020:020 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not             save of that which he desired.    18:020:021 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man             look for his goods.    18:020:022 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:             every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.    18:020:023 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of             his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is             eating.    18:020:024 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall             strike him through.    18:020:025 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering             sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.    18:020:026 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not             blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left             in his tabernacle.    18:020:027 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise             up against him.    18:020:028 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall             flow away in the day of his wrath.    18:020:029 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage             appointed unto him by God.    18:021:001 But Job answered and said,    18:021:002 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.    18:021:003 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock             on.    18:021:004 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why             should not my spirit be troubled?    18:021:005 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.    18:021:006 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on             my flesh.    18:021:007 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in             power?    18:021:008 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their             offspring before their eyes.    18:021:009 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God             upon them.    18:021:010 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and             casteth not her calf.    18:021:011 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their             children dance.    18:021:012 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of             the organ.    18:021:013 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to             the grave.    18:021:014 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not             the knowledge of thy ways.    18:021:015 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what             profit should we have, if we pray unto him?    18:021:016 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked             is far from me.    18:021:017 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft             cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows             in his anger.    18:021:018 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the             storm carrieth away.    18:021:019 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him,             and he shall know it.    18:021:020 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the             wrath of the Almighty.    18:021:021 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the             number of his months is cut off in the midst?    18:021:022 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that             are high.    18:021:023 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and             quiet.    18:021:024 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with             marrow.    18:021:025 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never             eateth with pleasure.    18:021:026 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall             cover them.    18:021:027 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye             wrongfully imagine against"]]]
