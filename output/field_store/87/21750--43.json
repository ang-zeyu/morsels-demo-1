The hidalgos say that, not keeping within the bounds of your  quality of gentleman, you have assumed the 'Don,' and made a knight of  yourself at a jump, with four vine-stocks and a couple of acres of land,  and never a shirt to your back. The caballeros say they do not want to  have hidalgos setting up in opposition to them, particularly squire  hidalgos who polish their own shoes and darn their black stockings with  green silk.\"    \"That,\" said Don Quixote, \"does not apply to me, for I always go well  dressed and never patched; ragged I may be, but ragged more from the wear  and tear of arms than of time.\"    \"As to your worship's valour, courtesy, accomplishments, and task, there  is a variety of opinions. Some say, 'mad but droll;' others, 'valiant but  unlucky;' others, 'courteous but meddling,' and then they go into such a  number of things that they don't leave a whole bone either in your  worship or in myself.\"    \"Recollect, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that wherever virtue exists in an  eminent degree it is persecuted. Few or none of the famous men that have  lived escaped being calumniated by malice. Julius Caesar, the boldest,  wisest, and bravest of captains, was charged with being ambitious, and  not particularly cleanly in his dress, or pure in his morals. Of  Alexander, whose deeds won him the name of Great, they say that he was  somewhat of a drunkard. Of Hercules, him of the many labours, it is said  that he was lewd and luxurious. Of Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of  Gaul, it was whispered that he was over-quarrelsome, and of his brother  that he was lachrymose. So that, O Sancho, amongst all these calumnies  against good men, mine may be let pass, since they are no more than thou  hast said.\"    \"That's just where it is, body of my father!\"    \"Is there more, then?\" asked Don Quixote.    \"There's the tail to be skinned yet,\" said Sancho; \"all so far is cakes  and fancy bread; but if your worship wants to know all about the  calumnies they bring against you, I will fetch you one this instant who  can tell you the whole of them without missing an atom; for last night  the son of Bartholomew Carrasco, who has been studying at Salamanca, came  home after having been made a bachelor, and when I went to welcome him,  he told me that your worship's history is already abroad in books, with  the title of THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA; and he  says they mention me in it by my own name of Sancho Panza, and the lady  Dulcinea del Toboso too, and divers things that happened to us when we  were alone; so that I crossed myself in my wonder how the historian who  wrote them down could have known them.\"    \"I promise thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"the author of our history  will be some sage enchanter; for to such nothing that they choose to  write about is hidden.\"    \"What!\" said Sancho, \"a sage and an enchanter! Why, the bachelor Samson  Carrasco (that is the name of him I spoke of) says the author of the  history is called Cide Hamete Berengena.\"    \"That is a Moorish name,\" said Don Quixote.    \"May be so,\" replied Sancho; \"for I have heard say that the Moors are  mostly great lovers of berengenas.\"    \"Thou must have mistaken the surname of this 'Cide'--which means in  Arabic 'Lord'--Sancho,\" observed Don Quixote.    \"Very likely,\" replied Sancho, \"but if your worship wishes me to fetch  the bachelor I will go for him in a twinkling.\"    \"Thou wilt do me a great pleasure, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for  what thou hast told me has amazed me, and I shall not eat a morsel that  will agree with me until I have heard all about it.\"    \"Then I am off for him,\" said Sancho; and leaving his master he went in  quest of the bachelor, with whom he returned in a short time, and, all  three together, they had a very droll colloquy.          CHAPTER III.    OF THE LAUGHABLE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE, SANCHO  PANZA, AND THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO      Don Quixote remained very deep in thought, waiting for the bachelor  Carrasco, from whom he was to hear how he himself had been put into a  book as Sancho said; and he could not persuade himself that any such  history could be in existence, for the blood of the enemies he had slain  was not yet dry on the blade of his sword, and now they wanted to make  out that his mighty achievements were going about in print. For all that,  he fancied some sage, either a friend or an enemy, might, by the aid of  magic, have given them to the press; if a friend, in order to magnify and  exalt them above the most famous ever achieved by any knight-errant; if  an enemy, to bring them to naught and degrade them below the meanest ever  recorded of any low squire, though as he said to himself, the  achievements of squires never were recorded. If, however, it were the  fact that such a history were in existence, it must necessarily, being  the story of a knight-errant, be grandiloquent, lofty, imposing, grand  and true. With this he comforted himself somewhat, though it made him  uncomfortable to think that the author was a Moor, judging by the title  of \"Cide;\" and that no truth was to be looked for from Moors, as they are  all impostors, cheats, and schemers. He was afraid he might have dealt  with his love affairs in some indecorous fashion, that might tend to the  discredit and prejudice of the purity of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso; he  would have had him set forth the fidelity and respect he had always  observed towards her, spurning queens, empresses, and damsels of all  sorts, and keeping in check the impetuosity of his natural impulses.  Absorbed and wrapped up in these and divers other cogitations, he was  found by Sancho and Carrasco, whom Don Quixote received with great  courtesy.    The bachelor, though he was called Samson, was of no great bodily size,  but he was a very great wag; he was of a sallow complexion, but very  sharp-witted, somewhere about four-and-twenty years of age, with a round  face, a flat nose, and a large mouth, all indications of a mischievous  disposition and a love of fun and jokes; and of this he gave a sample as  soon as he saw Don Quixote, by falling on his knees before him and  saying, \"Let me kiss your mightiness's hand, Senor Don Quixote of La  Mancha, for, by the habit of St. Peter that I wear, though I have no more  than the first four orders, your worship is one of the most famous  knights-errant that have ever been, or will be, all the world over. A  blessing on Cide Hamete Benengeli, who has written the history of your  great deeds, and a double blessing on that connoisseur who took the  trouble of having it translated out of the Arabic into our Castilian  vulgar tongue for the universal entertainment of the people!\"    Don Quixote made him rise, and said, \"So, then, it is true that there is  a history of me, and that it was a Moor and a sage who wrote it?\"    \"So true is it, senor,\" said Samson, \"that my belief is there are more  than twelve thousand volumes of the said history in print this very day.  Only ask Portugal, Barcelona, and Valencia, where they have been printed,  and moreover there is a report that it is being printed at Antwerp, and I  am persuaded there will not be a country or language in which there will  not be a translation of it.\"    \"One of the things,\" here observed Don Quixote, \"that ought to give most  pleasure to a virtuous and eminent man is to find himself in his lifetime  in print and in type, familiar in people's mouths with a good name; I say  with a good name, for if it be the opposite, then there is no death to be  compared to it.\"    \"If it goes by good name and fame,\" said the bachelor, \"your worship  alone bears away the palm from all the knights-errant; for the Moor in  his own language, and the Christian in his, have taken care to set before  us your gallantry, your high courage in encountering dangers, your  fortitude in adversity, your patience under misfortunes as well as  wounds, the purity and continence of the platonic loves of your worship  and my lady Dona Dulcinea del Toboso-\"    \"I never heard my lady Dulcinea called Dona,\" observed Sancho here;  \"nothing more than the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; so here already the  history is wrong.\"    \"That is not an objection of any importance,\" replied Carrasco.    \"Certainly not,\" said Don Quixote; \"but tell me, senor bachelor, what  deeds of mine are they that are made most of in this history?\"    \"On that point,\" replied the bachelor, \"opinions differ, as tastes do;  some swear by the adventure of the windmills that your worship took to be  Briareuses and giants; others by that of the fulling mills; one cries up  the description of the two armies that afterwards took the appearance of  two droves of sheep; another that of the dead body on its way to be  buried at Segovia; a third says the liberation of the galley slaves is  the best of all, and a fourth that nothing comes up to the affair with  the Benedictine giants, and the battle with the valiant Biscayan.\"    \"Tell me, senor bachelor,\" said Sancho at this point, \"does the adventure  with the Yanguesans come in, when our good Rocinante went hankering after  dainties?\"    \"The sage has left nothing in the ink-bottle,\" replied Samson; \"he tells  all and sets down everything, even to the capers that worthy Sancho cut  in the blanket.\"    \"I cut no capers in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/597"],[0,"The Story of Burnt Njal: The Great Icelandic Tribune, Jurist, and Counsellor (#6)"],[1,"slaying of Thorwald I award two hundred in  silver\" -- that was then thought a good price for a man -- \"and  thou shalt pay it down at once, brother, and pay it too with an  open hand.\"    Hauskuld did so, and then Hrut said to Oswif, \"I will give thee a  good cloak which I brought with me from foreign lands.\"    He thanked him for his gift, and went home well pleased at the  way in which things had gone.    After that Hauskuld and Hrut came to Oswif to share the goods,  and they and Oswif came to a good agreement about that too, and  they went home with their share of the goods, and Oswif is now  out of our story.  Hallgerda begged Hauskuld to let her come back  home to him, and he gave her leave, and for a long time there was  much talk about Thorwald's slaying.  As for Hallgerda's goods  they went on growing till they were worth a great sum.        13. GLUM'S WOOING    Now three brothers are named in the story.  One was called  Thorarin, the second Ragi, and the third Glum.  They were the  sons of Olof the Halt, and were men of much worth and of great  wealth in goods.  Thorarin's surname was Ragi's brother; he had  the Speakership of the Law after Rafn Heing's son.  He was a very  wise man, and lived at Varmalek, and he and Glum kept house  together.  Glum had been long abroad; he was a tall, strong,  handsome man.  Ragi their brother was a great manslayer.  Those  brothers owned in the south Engey and Laugarness.  One day the  brothers Thorarin and Glum were talking together, and Thorarin  asked Glum whether he meant to go abroad, as was his wont?    He answered, \"I was rather thinking now of leaving off trading  voyages.\"    \"What hast thou then in thy mind?  Wilt thou woo thee a wife?\"    \"That I will,\" says he, \"if I could only get myself well  matched.\"    Then Thorarin told off all the women who were unwedded in  Borgarfirth, and asked him if he would have any of these, \"Say  the word, and I will ride with thee!\"    But Glum answered, \"I will have none of these.\"    \"Say then the name of her thou wishest to have,\" says Thorarin.    Glum answered, \"If thou must know, her name is Hallgerda, and she  is Hauskuld's daughter away west in the dales.\"    \"Well,\" says Thorarin, \"'tis not with thee as the saw says, `be  warned by another's woe'; for she was wedded to a man, and she  plotted his death.\"    Glum said, \"Maybe such ill-luck will not befall her a second  time, and sure I am she will not plot my death.  But now, if thou  wilt show me any honour, ride along with me to woo her.\"    Thorarin said, \"There's no good striving against it, for what  must be is sure to happen.\"  Glum often talked the matter over  with Thorarin, but he put it off a long time.  At last it came  about that they gathered men together and rode off ten in  company, west to the dales, and came to Hauskuldstede.  Hauskuld  gave them a hearty welcome, and they stayed there that night.  But early next morning, Hauskuld sends for Hrut, and he came  thither at once: and Hauskuld was out of doors when he rode into  the \"town\".  Then Hauskuld told Hrut what men had come thither.    \"What may it be they want?\" asked Hrut.    \"As yet,\" says Hauskuld, \"they have not let out to me that they  have any business.\"    \"Still,\" says Hrut, \"their business must be with thee.  They will  ask the hand of thy daughter, Hallgerda.  If they do, what answer  wilt thou make?\"    \"What dost thou advise me to say?\" says Hauskuld.    \"Thou shalt answer well,\" says Hrut; \"but still make a clean  breast of all the good and all the ill thou knowest of the  woman.\"    But while the brothers were talking thus, out came the guests.   Hauskuld greeted them well, and Hrut bade both Thorarin and his  brothers good morning.  After that they all began to talk, and  Thorarin said, \"I am come hither, Hauskuld, with my brother Glum  on this errand, to ask for Hallgerda thy daughter, at the hand of  my brother Glum.  Thou must know that he is a man of worth.\"    \"I know well,\" says Hauskuld, \"that ye are both of you powerful  and worthy men; but I must tell you right out, that I chose a  husband for her before, and that turned out most unluckily for  us.\"    Thorarin answered, \"We will not let that stand in the way of the  bargain; for one oath shall not become all oaths, and this may  prove to be a good match, though that turned out ill; besides  Thiostolf had most hand in spoiling it.\"    Then Hrut spoke: \"Now I will give you a bit of advice -- this: if  ye will not let all this that has already happened to Hallgerda  stand in the way of the match, mind you do not let Thiostolf go  south with her if the match comes off, and that he is never there  longer than three nights at a time, unless Glum gives him leave,  but fall an outlaw by Glum's hand without atonement if he stay  there longer.  Of course, it shall be in Glum's power to give him  leave; but he will not if he takes my advice.  And now this match  shall not be fulfilled, as the other was, without Hallgerda's  knowledge.  She shall now know the whole course of this bargain,  and see Glum, and herself settle whether she will have him or  not; and then she will not be able to lay the blame on others if  it does not turn out well.  And all this shall be without craft  or guile.\"    Then Thorarin said, \"Now, as always, it will prove best if thy  advice be taken.\"    Then they sent for Hallgerda, and she came thither, and two women  with her.  She had on a cloak of rich blue woof, and under it a  scarlet kirtle, and a silver girdle round her waist, but her hair  came down on both sides of her bosom, and she had turned the  locks up under her girdle.  She sat down between Hrut and her  father, and she greeted them all with kind words, and spoke well  and boldly, and asked what was the news.  After that she ceased  speaking.    Then Glum said, \"There has been some talk between thy father and  my brother Thorarin and myself about a bargain.  It was that I  might get thee, Hallgerda, if it be thy will, as it is theirs;  and now, if thou art a brave woman, thou wilt say right out  whether the match is at all to thy mind; but if thou hast  anything in thy heart against this bargain with us, then we will  not say anything more about it.\"    Hallgerda said, \"I know well that you are men of worth and might,  ye brothers.  I know too that now I shall be much better wedded  than I was before; but what I want to know is, what you have said  already about the match, and how far you have given your words in  the matter.  But so far as I now see of thee, I think I might  love thee well if we can but hit it off as to temper.\"    So Glum himself told her all about the bargain, and left nothing  out, and then he asked Hauskuld and Hrut whether he had repeated  it right.  Hauskuld said he had; and then Hallgerda said, \"Ye  have dealt so well with me in this matter, my father and Hrut,  that I will do what ye advise, and this bargain shall be struck  as ye have settled it.\"    Then Hrut said, \"Methinks it were best that Hauskuld and I should  name witnesses, and that Hallgerda should betroth herself, if the  Lawman thinks that right and lawful.    \"Right and lawful it is,\" says Thorarin.    After that Hallgerda's goods were valued, and Glum was to lay  down as much against them, and they were to go shares, half and  half, in the whole.  Then Glum bound himself to Hallgerda as his  betrothed, and they rode away home south; but Hauskuld was to  keep the wedding-feast at his house.  And now all is quiet till  men ride to the wedding.        14. GLUM'S WEDDING    Those brothers gathered together a great company, and they were  all picked men.  They rode west to the dales and came to  Hauskuldstede, and there they found a great gathering to meet  them.  Hauskuld and Hrut, and their friends, filled one bench,  and the bridegroom the other.  Hallgerda sat upon the cross bench  on the dais, and behaved well.  Thiostolf went about with his axe  raised in air, and no one seemed to know that he was there, and  so the wedding went off well.  But when the feast was over,  Hallgerda went away south with Glum and his brothers.  So when  they came south to Varmalek, Thorarin asked Hallgerda if she  would undertake the housekeeping.  \"No, I will not,\" she said.  Hallgerda kept her temper down that winter, and they liked her  well enough.  But when the spring came, the brothers talked about  their property, and Thorarin said, \"I will give up to you the  house at Varmalek, for that is readiest to your hand, and I will  go down south to Laugarness and live there, but Engey we will  have both of us in common.\"    Glum was willing enough to do that.  So Thorarin went down to the  south of that district, and Glum and his wife stayed behind  there, and lived in the house at Varmalek.    Now Hallgerda got a household about her; she was prodigal in  giving, and grasping in getting.  In the summer she gave birth to  a girl.  Glum asked her what name it was to have?    \"She shall be called after my father's mother, and her name shall  be Thorgerda,\" for she came down from Sigurd Fafnir's-bane on the  father's side, according to the family pedigree.    So the maiden was sprinkled with water, and had this name given  her, and there she grew up, and got like her mother in looks and  feature.  Glum and Hallgerda agreed well together, and so it went  on for a while.  About that time these tidings were heard from  the north and Bearfirth, how Swan had rowed out to fish in the  spring, and a great storm came down on him from the east, and how  he was driven ashore at Fishless, and he and his men were there  lost.  But the fishermen who were at Kalback thought they saw  Swan go into the fell at Kalbackshorn, and that he was greeted  well; but some spoke against that story, and said there was  nothing in it.  But this all knew that he was never seen again  either alive or dead.  So when Hallgerda heard that, she thought  she had a great loss in her mother's brother."]]]
