For I see that which all men see.\"    And then Dorothy showed him the little mirror which was attached to  the long chain of turquoise matrix about her neck: and Jurgen  studied the frightened foolish aged face that he found in the  mirror.    Thus drearily did sanity return to Jurgen: and his flare of passion  died, and the fever and storm and the impetuous whirl of things was  ended, and the man was very weary. And in the silence he heard the  piping cry of a bird that seemed to seek for what it could not find.    \"Well, I am answered,\" said the pawnbroker: \"and yet I know that  this is not the final answer. Dearer than any hope of heaven was  that moment when awed surmises first awoke as to the new strange  loveliness which I had seen in the face of Dorothy. It was then I  noted the new faint flush suffusing her face from chin to brow so  often as my eyes encountered and found new lights in the shining  eyes which were no longer entirely frank in meeting mine. Well, let  that be, for I do not love Heitman Michael's wife.    \"It is a grief to remember how we followed love, and found his  service lovely. It is bitter to recall the sweetness of those vows  which proclaimed her mine eternally,--vows that were broken in their  making by prolonged and unforgotten kisses. We used to laugh at  Heitman Michael then; we used to laugh at everything. Thus for a  while, for a whole summer, we were as brave and comely and clean a  pair of sweethearts as the world has known. But let that be, for I  do not love Heitman Michael's wife.    \"Our love was fair but short-lived. There is none that may revive  him since the small feet of Dorothy trod out this small love's life.  Yet when this life of ours too is over--this parsimonious life which  can allow us no more love for anybody,--must we not win back,  somehow, to that faith we vowed against eternity? and be content  again, in some fair-colored realm? Assuredly I think this thing will  happen. Well, but let that be, for I do not love Heitman Michael's  wife.\"    \"Why, this is excellent hearing,\" observed Dorothy, \"because I see  that you are converting your sorrow into the raw stuff of verses. So  I shall be off to look for Jurgen, since he makes love quite  otherwise and far more amusingly.\"    And again, whatever was the matter upon which this girl now  meditated, her cheeks were tenderly colored by the thought of it,  and in her knowledge of this thing her eyes took infinite joy.    Thus it was for a moment only: for she left Jurgen now, with the  friendliest light waving of her hand; and so passed from him, not  thinking of this old fellow any longer, as he could see, even in the  instant she turned from him. And she went toward the dawn, in search  of that young Jurgen whom she, who was perfect in all things, had  loved, though only for a little while, not undeservedly.          5.    Requirements of Bread and Butter      \"Nessus,\" says Jurgen, \"and am I so changed? For that Dorothy whom I  loved in youth did not know me.\"    \"Good and evil keep very exact accounts,\" replied the Centaur, \"and  the face of every man is their ledger. Meanwhile the sun rises, it  is already another workday: and when the shadows of those two who  come to take possession fall full upon the garden, I warn you, there  will be astounding changes brought about by the requirements of  bread and butter. You have not time to revive old memories by  chatting with the others to whom you babbled aforetime in this  garden.\"    \"Ah, Centaur, in the garden between dawn and sunrise there was never  any other save Dorothy la Desiree.\"    The Centaur shrugged. \"It may be you forget; it is certain that you  underestimate the local population. Some of the transient visitors  you have seen, and in addition hereabouts dwell the year round all  manner of imaginary creatures. The fairies live just southward, and  the gnomes too. To your right is the realm of the Valkyries: the  Amazons and the Cynocephali are their allies: all three of these  nations are continually at loggerheads with their neighbors, the  Baba-Yagas, whom Morfei cooks for, and whose monarch is Oh, a person  very dangerous to name. Northward dwell the Lepracauns and the Men  of Hunger, whose king is Clobhair. My people, who are ruled by  Chiron, live even further to the north. The Sphinx pastures on  yonder mountain; and now the Chimaera is old and generally derided,  they say that Cerberus visits the Sphinx at twilight, although I was  never the person to disseminate scandal--\"    \"Centaur,\" said Jurgen, \"and what is Dorothy doing here?\"    \"Why, all the women that any man has ever loved live here,\" replied  the Centaur, \"for very obvious reasons.\"    \"That is a hard saying, friend.\"    Nessus tapped with his forefinger upon the back of Jurgen's hand.  \"Worm's-meat! this is the destined food, do what you will, of small  white worms. This by and by will be a struggling pale corruption,  like seething milk. That too is a hard saying, Jurgen. But it is a  true saying.\"    \"And was that Dorothy whom I loved in youth an imaginary creature?\"    \"My poor Jurgen, you who were once a poet! she was your masterpiece.  For there was only a shallow, stupid and airy, high-nosed and  light-haired miss, with no remarkable good looks,--and consider what  your ingenuity made from such poor material! You should be proud of  yourself.\"    \"No, Centaur, I cannot very well be proud of my folly: yet I do not  regret it. I have been befooled by a bright shadow of my own  raising, you tell me, and I concede it to be probable. No less, I  served a lovely shadow; and my heart will keep the memory of that  loveliness until life ends, in a world where other men follow  pantingly after shadows which are not even pretty.\"    \"There is something in that, Jurgen: there is also something in an  old tale we used to tell in Thessaly, about a fox and certain  grapes.\"    \"Well, but look you, Nessus, there is an emperor that reigns now in  Constantinople and occasionally does business with me. Yes, and I  could tell you tales of by what shifts he came to the throne--\"    \"Men's hands are by ordinary soiled in climbing,\" quoth the Centaur.    \"And 'Jurgen,' this emperor says to me, not many months ago, as he  sat in his palace, crowned and dreary and trying to cheat me out of  my fair profit on some emeralds,--'Jurgen, I cannot sleep of nights,  because of that fool Alexius, who comes into my room with staring  eyes and the bowstring still about his neck. And my Varangians must  be in league with that silly ghost, because I constantly order them  to keep Alexius out of my bedchamber, and they do not obey me,  Jurgen. To be King of the East is not to the purpose, Jurgen, when  one must submit to such vexations.' Yes, it was Caesar Pharamond  himself said this to me: and I deduce the shadow of a crown has led  him into an ugly pickle, for all that he is the mightiest monarch in  the world. And I would not change with Caesar Pharamond, not I who am  a respectable pawnbroker, with my home in fee and my bit of tilled  land. Well, this is a queer world, to be sure: and this garden is  visited by no stranger things than pop into a man's mind sometimes,  without his knowing how.\"    \"Ah, but you must understand that the garden is speedily to be  remodeled. Yonder you may observe the two whose requirements are to  rid the place of all fantastic unremunerative notions; and who will  develop the natural resources of this garden according to generally  approved methods.\"    And from afar Jurgen could see two figures coming out of the east,  so tall that their heads rose above the encircling hills and  glistened in the rays of a sun which was not yet visible. One was a  white pasty-looking giant, with a crusty expression: he walked with  the aid of a cane. The other was of a pale yellow color: his face  was oily, and he rode on a vast cow that was called AEdhumla.    \"Make way there, brother, with your staff of life,\" says the yellow  giant, \"for there is much to do hereabouts.\"    \"Ay, brother, this place must be altered a deal before it meets with  our requirements,\" the other grumbled. \"May I be toasted if I know  where to begin!\"    Then as the giants turned dull and harsh faces toward the garden,  the sun came above the circle of blue hills, so that the mingled  shadows of these two giants fell across the garden. For an instant  Jurgen saw the place oppressed by that attenuated mile-long shadow,  as in heraldry you may see a black bar painted sheer across some  brightly emblazoned shield. Then the radiancy of everything twitched  and vanished, as a bubble bursts.    And Jurgen was standing in the midst of a field, very neatly plowed,  but with nothing as yet growing in it. And the Centaur was with him  still, it seemed, for there were the creature's hoofs, but all the  gold had been washed or rubbed away from them in traveling with  Jurgen.    \"See, Nessus!\" Jurgen cried, \"the garden is made desolate. Oh,  Nessus, was it fair that so much loveliness should be thus wasted!\"    \"Nay,\" said the Centaur, \"nay!\" Long and wailingly he whinneyed,  \"Nay!\"    And when Jurgen raised his eyes he saw that his companion was not a  centaur, but only a strayed riding-horse.    \"Were you the animal, then,\" says Jurgen, \"and was it a quite  ordinary animal, that conveyed me to the garden between dawn and  sunrise?\" And Jurgen laughed disconsolately. \"At all events, you  have clothed me in a curious fine shirt. And, now I look, your  bridle is marked with a coronet. So I will return you to the castle  at Bellegarde, and it may be that Heitman Michael will reward me.\"    Then Jurgen mounted this horse and rode away from the plowed field  wherein nothing grew as yet.

(#6)"],[1,"miserable hags  Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:    \"Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left  This is Megaera; on the right hand she,  Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone  I' th' midst.\"  This said, in silence he remain'd  Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves  Smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais'd,  That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound.  \"Hasten Medusa: so to adamant  Him shall we change;\" all looking down exclaim'd.  \"E'en when by Theseus' might assail'd, we took  No ill revenge.\"  \"Turn thyself round, and keep  Thy count'nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire  Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return  Upwards would be for ever lost.\"  This said,  Himself my gentle master turn'd me round,  Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own  He also hid me.  Ye of intellect  Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal'd  Under close texture of the mystic strain!    And now there came o'er the perturbed waves  Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made  Either shore tremble, as if of a wind  Impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung,  That 'gainst some forest driving all its might,  Plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls  Afar; then onward passing proudly sweeps  Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.    Mine eyes he loos'd, and spake: \"And now direct  Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam,  There, thickest where the smoke ascends.\" As frogs  Before their foe the serpent, through the wave  Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one  Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits  Destroy'd, so saw I fleeing before one  Who pass'd with unwet feet the Stygian sound.  He, from his face removing the gross air,  Oft his left hand forth stretch'd, and seem'd alone  By that annoyance wearied.  I perceiv'd  That he was sent from heav'n, and to my guide  Turn'd me, who signal made that I should stand  Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full  Of noble anger seem'd he!  To the gate  He came, and with his wand touch'd it, whereat  Open without impediment it flew.    \"Outcasts of heav'n!  O abject race and scorn'd!\"  Began he on the horrid grunsel standing,  \"Whence doth this wild excess of insolence  Lodge in you? wherefore kick you 'gainst that will  Ne'er frustrate of its end, and which so oft  Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs?  What profits at the fays to but the horn?  Your Cerberus, if ye remember, hence  Bears still, peel'd of their hair, his throat and maw.\"    This said, he turn'd back o'er the filthy way,  And syllable to us spake none, but wore  The semblance of a man by other care  Beset, and keenly press'd, than thought of him  Who in his presence stands.  Then we our steps  Toward that territory mov'd, secure  After the hallow'd words.  We unoppos'd  There enter'd; and my mind eager to learn  What state a fortress like to that might hold,  I soon as enter'd throw mine eye around,  And see on every part wide-stretching space  Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.    As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles,  Or as at Pola, near Quarnaro's gulf,  That closes Italy and laves her bounds,  The place is all thick spread with sepulchres;  So was it here, save what in horror here  Excell'd: for 'midst the graves were scattered flames,  Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn'd,  That iron for no craft there hotter needs.    Their lids all hung suspended, and beneath  From them forth issu'd lamentable moans,  Such as the sad and tortur'd well might raise.    I thus: \"Master! say who are these, interr'd  Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear  The dolorous sighs?\"  He answer thus return'd:    \"The arch-heretics are here, accompanied  By every sect their followers; and much more,  Than thou believest, tombs are freighted: like  With like is buried; and the monuments  Are different in degrees of heat.\"  This said,  He to the right hand turning, on we pass'd  Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.          CANTO X    NOW by a secret pathway we proceed,  Between the walls, that hem the region round,  And the tormented souls: my master first,  I close behind his steps.  \"Virtue supreme!\"  I thus began; \"who through these ample orbs  In circuit lead'st me, even as thou will'st,  Speak thou, and satisfy my wish.  May those,  Who lie within these sepulchres, be seen?  Already all the lids are rais'd, and none  O'er them keeps watch.\"  He thus in answer spake  \"They shall be closed all, what-time they here  From Josaphat return'd shall come, and bring  Their bodies, which above they now have left.  The cemetery on this part obtain  With Epicurus all his followers,  Who with the body make the spirit die.  Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon  Both to the question ask'd, and to the wish,  Which thou conceal'st in silence.\"  I replied:  \"I keep not, guide belov'd! from thee my heart  Secreted, but to shun vain length of words,  A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself.\"    \"O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire  Alive art passing, so discreet of speech!  Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance  Declares the place of thy nativity  To be that noble land, with which perchance  I too severely dealt.\"  Sudden that sound  Forth issu'd from a vault, whereat in fear  I somewhat closer to my leader's side  Approaching, he thus spake: \"What dost thou?  Turn.  Lo, Farinata, there! who hath himself  Uplifted: from his girdle upwards all  Expos'd behold him.\"  On his face was mine  Already fix'd; his breast and forehead there  Erecting, seem'd as in high scorn he held  E'en hell.  Between the sepulchres to him  My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt,  This warning added: \"See thy words be clear!\"    He, soon as there I stood at the tomb's foot,  Ey'd me a space, then in disdainful mood  Address'd me: \"Say, what ancestors were thine?\"    I, willing to obey him, straight reveal'd  The whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow  Somewhat uplifting, cried: \"Fiercely were they  Adverse to me, my party, and the blood  From whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad  Scatter'd them.\"  \"Though driv'n out, yet they each time  From all parts,\" answer'd I, \"return'd; an art  Which yours have shown, they are not skill'd to learn.\"    Then, peering forth from the unclosed jaw,  Rose from his side a shade, high as the chin,  Leaning, methought, upon its knees uprais'd.  It look'd around, as eager to explore  If there were other with me; but perceiving  That fond imagination quench'd, with tears  Thus spake: \"If thou through this blind prison go'st.  Led by thy lofty genius and profound,  Where is my son? and wherefore not with thee?\"    I straight replied: \"Not of myself I come,  By him, who there expects me, through this clime  Conducted, whom perchance Guido thy son  Had in contempt.\"  Already had his words  And mode of punishment read me his name,  Whence I so fully answer'd.  He at once  Exclaim'd, up starting, \"How! said'st thou he HAD?  No longer lives he?  Strikes not on his eye  The blessed daylight?\"  Then of some delay  I made ere my reply aware, down fell  Supine, not after forth appear'd he more.    Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom  I yet was station'd, chang'd not count'nance stern,  Nor mov'd the neck, nor bent his ribbed side.  \"And if,\" continuing the first discourse,  \"They in this art,\" he cried, \"small skill have shown,  That doth torment me more e'en than this bed.  But not yet fifty times shall be relum'd  Her aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm,  Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art.  So to the pleasant world mayst thou return,  As thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws,  Against my kin this people is so fell?\"    \"The slaughter and great havoc,\" I replied,  \"That colour'd Arbia's flood with crimson stain--  To these impute, that in our hallow'd dome  Such orisons ascend.\"  Sighing he shook  The head, then thus resum'd: \"In that affray  I stood not singly, nor without just cause  Assuredly should with the rest have stirr'd;  But singly there I stood, when by consent  Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz'd,  The one who openly forbad the deed.\"    \"So may thy lineage find at last repose,\"  I thus adjur'd him, \"as thou solve this knot,  Which now involves my mind.  If right I hear,  Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time  Leads with him, of the present uninform'd.\"    \"We view, as one who hath an evil sight,\"  He answer'd, \"plainly, objects far remote:  So much of his large spendour yet imparts  The Almighty Ruler; but when they approach  Or actually exist, our intellect  Then wholly fails, nor of your human state  Except what others bring us know we aught.  Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all  Our knowledge in that instant shall expire,  When on futurity the portals close.\"    Then conscious of my fault, and by remorse  Smitten, I added thus: \"Now shalt thou say  To him there fallen, that his offspring still  Is to the living join'd; and bid him know,  That if from answer silent I abstain'd,  'Twas that my thought was occupied intent  Upon that error, which thy help hath solv'd.\"    But now my master summoning me back  I heard, and with more eager haste besought  The spirit to inform me, who with him  Partook his lot.  He answer thus return'd:    \"More than a thousand with me here are laid  Within is Frederick, second of that name,  And the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest  I speak not.\"  He, this said, from sight withdrew.  But I my steps towards the ancient bard  Reverting, ruminated on the words  Betokening me such ill.  Onward he mov'd,  And thus in going question'd: \"Whence the amaze  That holds thy senses wrapt?\"  I satisfied  The inquiry, and the sage enjoin'd me straight:  \"Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard  To thee importing harm; and note thou this,\"  With his rais'd finger bidding me take heed,    \"When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,  Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life  The future tenour will to "]]]
