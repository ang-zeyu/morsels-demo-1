The big boys were not long dipping their faces in and getting a drink  of the cool, clear water, but the girls had to take their hats off,  roll up their sleeves, and go through a \"regular performance,\" as Harry  said, before they could make up their minds to dip into the water.  Mabel brought up her supply with her hands, but when Nan tried it her  hands leaked, and the result was her fresh white frock got wet.  Flossie's curls tumbled in both sides, and when she had finished she  looked as if she had taken a plunge at the seashore.    \"Let me! Let me!\" cried Freddie impatiently, and without further  warning he thrust his yellow head in the spring clear up to his neck!    \"Oh, Freddie!\" yelled Nan, grabbing him by the heels and thus saving a  more serious accident.    \"Oh! oh! oh!\" spluttered Freddie, nearly choked, \"I'm drowned!\" and the  water really seemed to be running out of his eyes, noses and ears all  at once.    \"Oh, Freddie!\" was all Mrs. Bobbsey could say, as a shower of clean  handkerchiefs was sent from the hay wagon to dry the \"drowned\" boy.    \"Just like the flour barrel!\" laughed Bert, referring to the funny  accident that befell Freddie the winter before, as told in my other  book \"The Bobbsey Twins.\"    \"Only that was a dry bath and this a wet one,\" Nan remarked, as  Freddie's curls were shook out in the sun.    \"Did you get a drink?\" asked August, whose invitation to drink had  caused the mishap.    \"Yep!\" answered Freddie bravely, \"and I was a real fireman too, that  time, 'cause they always get soaked; don't they, Bert?\"    Being assured they did, the party once more started off for the woods.  It was getting to be all woods now, only a driveway breaking through  the pines, maples, and chestnut trees that abounded in that section.    \"Just turn in there, John!\" Harry directed, as a particularly thick  group of trees appeared. Here were chosen the picnic grounds and all  the things taken from the wagon, and before John was out of sight on  the return home the children had established their camp and were flying  about the woods like little fairies.    \"Let's build a furnace,\" Jack Hopkins suggested.    \"Let's,\" said all the boys, who immediately set out carrying stones and  piling them up to build the stove. There was plenty of wood about, and  when the fire was built, the raw potatoes that Harry had secretly  brought along were roasted, finer than any oven could cook them.    Mrs. Bobbsey and Aunt Sarah had spread the tablecloth on the grass, and  were now busy opening the baskets and arranging the places.  There were  so many pretty little nooks to explore in the woods that Mrs. Bobbsey  had to warn the children not to get too far away.    \"Are there giants?\" Freddie asked.    \"No, but there are very dark lonely places the woods and little boys  might find snakes.\"    \"And bears!\" put in Freddie, to which remark his mother said,  \"perhaps,\" because there really might be bears in a woods so close to  the mountains.        CHAPTER VIII    FUN IN THE WOODS    \"Dinner served in the dining car!\" called Bert through the woods,  imitating the call of the porter on the Pullman car.    \"All ready!\" echoed the other boys, banging on an old boiler like the  Turks do, instead of ringing a bell.    \"Oh, how pretty!\" the girls all exclaimed, as they beheld the \"feast in  the forest,\" as Nan put it. And indeed it was pretty, for at each place  was set a long plume of fern leaves with wood violets at the end, and  what could be more beautiful than such a decoration?    \"Potatoes first!\" Harry announced, \"because they may get cold,\" and at  this order everybody broke the freshly roasted potatoes into the paper  napkins and touched it up with the extra butter that had come along.    \"Simply fine!\" declared Nan, with the air of one who knew. Now, my old  readers will remember how Nan baked such good cake. So she ought to be  an authority on baked potatoes, don't you think?    Next came the sandwiches, with the watercress Harry and Bert had  gathered before breakfast, then (and this was a surprise) hot  chocolate! This was brought out in Martha's cider jug, and heated in a  kettle over the boys' stone furnace.    \"It must be fun to camp out,\" Mabel Herold remarked.    \"Yes, just think of the dishes saved,\" added Mildred Manners, who  always had so many dishes to do at home.    \"And we really don't need them,\" Nan argued, passing her tin cup on to  Flossie.    \"Think how the soldiers get along!\" Bert put in.    \"And the firemen'\" lisped Freddie, who never forgot the heroes of flame  and water.    Of course everybody was either sitting on the grass or on a \"soft  stump.\" These latter conveniences had been brought by the boys for Aunt  Sarah and Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"What's that!\" exclaimed little Flossie, as something was plainly  moving under the tables cloth.    \"A snake, a snake!\" called everybody at once, for indeed under the  white linen was plainly to be seen the creeping form of a reptile.    While the girls made a run for safety the boys carefully lifted the  cloth and went for his snakeship.    \"There he is! There he is!\" shouted Tom Mason, as the thing tried to  crawl under the stump lately used as a seat by Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"Whack him!\" called August Stout, who, armed with a good club, made  straight for the stump.    \"Look out! He's a big fellow!\" Harry declared, as the snake attempted  to get upright.    The boys fell back a little now, and as the snake actually stood on the  tip of his tail, as they do before striking, Harry sprang forward and  dealt him a heavy blow right on the head that laid the intruder flat.    \"At him, boys! At him!\" called Jack Hopkins, while the snake lay  wriggling in the grass; and the boys, making good use of the stunning  blow Harry had dealt, piled on as many more blows as their clubs could  wield.    All this time the girls and ladies were over on a knoll \"high and dry,\"  as Nan said, and now, when assured that the snake was done for they  could hardly be induced to come and look at him.    \"He's a beauty!\" Harry declared, as the boys actually stretched the  creature out to measure him. Bert had a rule, and when the snake was  measured up he was found to be five feet long!    \"He's a black racer!\" Jack Hopkins announced, and the others said they  guessed he was.    \"Lucky we saw him first!\" remarked Harry, \"Racers are very poisonous!\"    \"Let's go home; there might be more!\", pleaded Flossie, but the boys  said the snake hunt was the best fun at the picnic.    \"Goodness!\" exclaimed Harry suddenly, \"we forgot to let the pigeons  loose!\" and so saying he ran for the basket of birds that hung on the  low limb of a pretty maple. First Harry made sure the messages were  safe under each bird's wing, then he called:    \"All ready!\"    Snap! went something that sounded like a shot (but it wasn't), and then  away flew the pretty birds to take the messages home to John and  Martha. The shot was only a dry stick that Tom Mason snapped to imitate  a gun, as they do at bicycle races, but the effect was quite startling  and made the girls jump.    \"It won't take long for them to get home!\" said Bert, watching the  birds fly away.    \"They'll get lost!\" cried Freddie.    \"No, they won't. They know which way we came,\" Nan explained.    \"But they was shut up in the basket,\" argued Freddie.    \"Yet they could see,\" Nan told him.    \"Can pigeons see when they're asleep?\" inquired the little fellow.    \"Maybe,\" Nan answered.    \"Then I'd like to have pigeon eyes,\" he finished, thinking to himself  how fine it would be to see everything going on around and be fast  asleep too.    \"Oh, mamma, come quick!\" called Flossie, running along a path at the  edge of the wood. \"There's a tree over there pouring water, and it  isn't raining a drop!\"    Everybody set out now to look at the wonderful tree, which was soon  discovered where Flossie had found it.    \"There it is!\" she exclaimed. \"See the water dropping down!\"    \"A maple tree,\" Harry informed them, \"and that sap is what they make  maple sugar out of.\"    \"Oh, catch it!\" called Freddie, promptly holding his cap under the  drops.    \"It would take a good deal to make a sugar cake,\" Harry said, \"but  maybe we can get enough of it to make a little cake for Freddie.\"    At this the country boys began looking around for young maples, and as  small limbs of the trees were broken the girls caught the drops in  their tin cups. It took quite a while to get a little, but by putting  it all together a cupful was finally gathered.    \"Now we will put it in a clean milk bottle,\" Mrs. Bobbsey said, \"and  maybe we can make maple syrup cake to-morrow.\"    \"Let's have a game of hide-and-seek,\" Nan suggested.    In a twinkling every boy and girl was hidden behind a tree, and Nan  found herself \"It.\" Of course it took a big tree to hide the girls'  dresses, and Nan had no trouble in spying Mildred first. Soon the game  was going along merrily, and the boys and girls were out of breath  trying to get \"home free.\"    \"Where's Roy?\" exclaimed Tom Mason, the little boy's brother.    \"Hiding somewhere,\" Bessie ventured, for it only seemed a minute before  when the little fat boy who was Freddie's companion had been with the  others.    \"But where is he?\" they all soon exclaimed in alarm, as call after call  brought no answer.    \"Over at the maple tree!\" Harry thought.    \"Down at the spring,\" Nan said.    \"Looking for flowers,\" Flossie guessed.    But all these spots were searched, and the little boy was not found.    \"Oh, maybe the giants have stoled him!\" Freddie cried.    \"Or maybe the children's hawk has took him away,\" Flossie sobbed.    Meanwhile everybody searched and searched, but no Roy could they find.    \"The boat!\" suddenly exclaimed Tom, making a dash for the pond that ran  along at the foot of a steep"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7140"],[0,"The Great Conspiracy, Complete (#6)"],[1,"of  '87,\" for the government of the North-west Territory (from which the  Free States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin have  since been carved and admitted to the Union) was adopted in Congress by  the unanimous vote of all the eight States present.  And the sixth  article of this Ordinance, or \"Articles of Compact,\" which it was  stipulated should \"forever remain unalterable, unless by common  consent,\" was in these words:    \"Art. 6.  There shall be neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude in  the said Territory, otherwise than in punishment of crimes, whereof the  party shall have been duly convicted; provided always that any person  escaping into the same from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in  any one of the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed,  and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor, or service, as  aforesaid.\"    But this Ordinance of '87, adopted almost simultaneously with the  framing of our present Federal Constitution, was essentially different  from the Ordinance of three years previous, in this: that while the  latter included the territory south of the Ohio River as well as that  north-west of it, this did not; and as a direct consequence of this  failure to include in it the territory south of that river, the States  of Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, which were taken out of it, were  subsequently admitted to the Union as Slave States, and thus greatly  augmented their political power.  And at a later period it was this  increased political power that secured the admission of still other  Slave States--as Florida, Louisiana and Texas--which enabled the Slave  States to hold the balance of such power as against the original States  that had become Free, and the new Free States of the North-west.    Hence, while in a measure quieting the great question of Slavery for the  time being, the Ordinance of '87 in reality laid the ground-work for the  long series of irritations and agitations touching its restrictions and  extension, which eventually culminated in the clash of arms that shook  the Union from its centre to its circumference.  Meanwhile, as we have  seen--while the Ordinance of 1787 was being enacted in the last Congress  of the old Confederation at New York--the Convention to frame the  present Constitution was sitting at Philadelphia under the Presidency of  George Washington himself.  The old Confederation had proved itself to  be \"a rope of sand.\"  A new and stronger form of government had become a  necessity for National existence.    To create it out of the discordant elements whose harmony was essential  to success, was an herculean task, requiring the utmost forbearance,  unselfishness, and wisdom.  And of all the great questions, dividing the  framers of that Constitution, perhaps none of them required a higher  degree of self abnegation and patriotism than those touching human  Slavery.    The situation was one of extreme delicacy.  The necessity for a closer  and stronger Union of all the States was apparently absolute, yet this  very necessity seemed to place a whip in the hands of a few States, with  which to coerce the greater number of States to do their bidding.  It  seemed that the majority must yield to a small minority on even vital  questions, or lose everything.    Thus it was, that instead of an immediate interdiction of the African  Slave Trade, Congress was empowered to prohibit it after the lapse of  twenty years; that instead of the basis of Congressional Representation  being the total population of each State, and that of direct taxation  the total property of each State, a middle ground was conceded, which  regarded the Slaves as both persons and property, and the basis both of  Representation and of Direct Taxation was fixed as being the total Free  population \"plus three-fifths of all other persons\" in each State; and  that there was inserted in the Constitution a similar clause to that  which we have seen was almost simultaneously incorporated in the  Ordinance of '87, touching the reclamation and return to their owners of  Fugitive Slaves from the Free States into which they may have escaped.    The fact of the matter is, that the Convention that framed our  Constitution lacked the courage of its convictions, and was \"bulldozed\"  by the few extreme Southern Slave-holding States--South Carolina and  Georgia especially.  It actually paltered with those convictions and  with the truth itself.  Its convictions--those at least of a great  majority of its delegates--were against not only the spread, but the  very existence of Slavery; yet we have seen what they unwillingly agreed  to in spite of those convictions; and they were guilty moreover of the  subterfuge of using the terms \"persons\" and \"service or labor\" when they  really meant \"Slaves\" and \"Slavery.\"  \"They did this latter,\" Mr.  Madison says, \"because they did not choose to admit the right of  property in man,\" and yet in fixing the basis of Direct Taxation as well  as Congressional Representation at the total Free population of each  State with \"three-fifths of all other persons,\" they did admit the right  of property in man!  As was stated by Mr. Iredell to the North Carolina  Ratification Convention, when explaining the Fugitive Slave clause:  \"Though the word 'Slave' is not mentioned, this is the meaning of it.\"  And he added: \"The Northern delegates, owing to their peculiar scruples  on the subject of Slavery, did not choose the word 'Slave' to be  mentioned.\"    In March, 1789, the first Federal Congress met at New York.  It at once  enacted a law in accordance with the terms of the Ordinance of '87  --adapting it to the changed order of things under the new Federal  Constitution--prohibiting Slavery in the Territories of the North-west;  and the succeeding Congress enacted a Fugitive-Slave law.    In the same year (1789) North Carolina ceded her western territory (now  Tennessee) south of the Ohio, to the United States, providing as one of  the conditions of that cession, \"that no regulation made, or to be made,  by Congress, shall tend to emancipate Slaves.\"  Georgia, also, in 1802,  ceded her superfluous territorial domain (south of the Ohio, and now  known as Alabama and Mississippi), making as a condition of its  acceptance that the Ordinance of '87 \"shall, in all its parts, extend to  the territory contained in the present act of cession, the article only  excepted which forbids Slavery.\"    Thus while the road was open and had been taken advantage of, at the  earliest moment, by the Federal Congress to prohibit Slavery in all the  territory north-west of the Ohio River by Congressional enactment,  Congress considered itself barred by the very conditions of cession from  inhibiting Slavery in the territory lying south of that river.  Hence it  was that while the spread of Slavery was prevented in the one Section of  our outlying territories by Congressional legislation, it was stimulated  in the other Section by the enforced absence of such legislation.  As a  necessary sequence, out of the Territories of the one Section grew more  Free States and out of the other more Slave States, and this condition  of things had a tendency to array the Free and the Slave States in  opposition to each other and to Sectionalize the flames of that Slavery  agitation which were thus continually fed.    Upon the admission of Ohio to Statehood in 1803, the remainder of the  North-west territory became the Territory of Indiana.  The inhabitants  of this Territory (now known as the States of Indiana, Illinois,  Michigan and Wisconsin), consisting largely of settlers from the Slave  States, but chiefly from Virginia and Kentucky, very persistently (in  1803, 1806 and 1807) petitioned Congress for permission to employ Slave  Labor, but--although their petitions were favorably reported in most  cases by the Committees to which they were referred--without avail,  Congress evidently being of opinion that a temporary suspension in this  respect of the sixth article of the Ordinance of '87 was \"not  expedient.\"  These frequent rebuffs by Congress, together with the  constantly increasing emigration from the Free States, prevented the  taking of any further steps to implant Slavery on the soil of that  Territory.    Meanwhile the vast territory included within the Valley of the  Mississippi and known at that day as the \"Colony of Louisiana,\" was, in  1803, acquired to the United States by purchase from the French--to whom  it had but lately been retroceded by Spain.  Both under Spanish and  French rule, Slavery had existed throughout this vast yet sparsely  populated region.  When we acquired it by purchase, it was already  there, as an established \"institution;\" and the Treaty of acquisition  not only provided that it should be \"incorporated into the Union of the  United States, and admitted as soon as possible, according to the  principles of the Federal Constitution,\" but that its inhabitants in the  meantime \"should be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of  their liberty, property, and the religion which they professed\"--and,  as \"the right of property in man\" had really been admitted in practice,  if not in theory, by the framers of that Constitution itself--that  institution was allowed to remain there.  Indeed the sparseness of its  population at the time of purchase and the amazing fertility of its soil  and adaptability of its climate to Slave Labor, together with the then  recent invention by Eli Whitney, of Massachusetts, of that wonderful  improvement in the separation of cotton-fibre from its seed, known as  the \"cotton-gin\"--which with the almost simultaneous inventions of  Hargreaves, and Arkwright's cotton-spinning machines, and Watt's  application of his steam engine, etc., to them, marvelously increased  both the cotton supply and demand and completely revolutionized the  cotton industry--contributed to rapidly"]]]
