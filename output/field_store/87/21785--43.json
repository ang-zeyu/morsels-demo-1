In conclusion, we may attempt to classify and give Schiller his place in  the progress of the world's literary history. Progress is no doubt a law  of the individual, of nations, and of the whole race. To grow in  perfection, to exist in some sort at a higher degree, is the task imposed  by God on man, the continuation of the very work of God, the complement  of creation. But this moral growth, this need of increase, may, like all  the forces of nature, yield to a greater force; it is an impulsion rather  than a necessity; it solicits and does not constrain. A thousand  obstacles stay its development in individuals and in societies; moral  liberty may retard or accelerate its effects. Progress is therefore a  law which cannot be abrogated, but which is not invariably obeyed.    Nevertheless, in proportion to the increase of the mass of individuals,  the caprices of chance and of liberty neutralize each other to allow the  providential action that presides over our destinies to prevail. Looking  at the same total of the life of the world, humanity undoubtedly  advances: there are in our time fewer moral miseries, fewer physical  miseries, than were known in the past.    Consequently art and literature, which express the different states of  society, must share in some degree in this progressive march. But there  are two things in literary work: on the one hand the ideas and social  manners which it expresses, on the other the intelligence, the feeling,  the imagination of the writer who becomes its interpreter. While the  former of these elements tends incessantly to a greater perfection, the  latter is subject to all the hazards of individual genius. Accordingly  the progressive literature is only in the inspiration, and so to speak in  the matter; it may and must therefore not be continuous in form.    But more than this: in very advanced societies the very grandeur of  ideas, the abundance of models, the satiety of the public render the task  of the artist more and more difficult. The artist himself has no longer  the enthusiasm of the first ages, the youth of imagination and of the  heart; he is an old man whose riches have increased, but who enjoys his  wealth less.    If all the epochs of literature are considered as a whole it will be seen  that they succeed each other in a constant order. After the period when  the idea and the form combined in a harmonious manner comes another where  the social idea is superabundant, and destroys the literary form of the  preceding epoch.    The middle ages introduced spiritualism in art; before this new idea the  smiling untruths of Greek poetry fled away frightened. The classical  form so beautiful, so pure, cannot contain high Catholic thought. A new  art is formed; on this side the Alps it does not reach the maturity that  produces masterpieces. But at that time all Europe was one fatherland;  Italy completes what is lacking in France and elsewhere.    The renaissance introduces new ideas into civilization; it resuscitates  the traditions of antique science and seeks to unite them to the truths  of Christianity. The art of the middle ages, as a vessel of too limited  capacity, is broken by the new flood poured into it. These different  ideas are stirred up and in conflict in the sixteenth century; they  became co-ordinate and attain to an admirable expression in the following  age.    In the eighteenth century there is a new invasion of ideas; all is  examined and questioned; religion, government, society, all becomes a  matter of discussion for the school called philosophical. Poetry  appeared dying out, history drying up, till a truer spirit was breathed  into the literary atmosphere by the criticism of Lessing, the philosophy  of Kant, and the poetry of Klopstock. It was at this transition period  that Schiller appeared, retaining throughout his literary career much of  the revolutionary and convulsive spirit of his early days, and faithfully  reflecting much of the dominant German philosophy of his time.    Part of the nineteenth century seems to take in hand the task of  reconstructing the moral edifice and of giving back to thought a larger  form. The literary result of its effects is the renaissance of lyrical  poetry with an admirable development in history.    Schiller's most brilliant works were in the former walk, his histories  have inferior merit, and his philosophical writings bespeak a deep  thinking nature with great originality of conception, such as naturally  results from a combination of high poetic inspiration with much  intellectual power.    Schiller, like all great men of genius, was a representative man of his  country and of his age. A German, a Protestant free-thinker, a  worshipper of the classical, he was the expression of these aspects of  national and general thought.    The religious reformation was the work of the North. The instinct of  races came in it to complicate the questions of dogmas. The awakening of  individual nationalities was one of the characters of the epoch.    The nations compressed in the severe unity of the Middle Ages escaped in  the Reformation from the uniform mould that had long enveloped them, and  tended to that other unity, still very distant, which must spring from  the spontaneous view of the same truth by all men, result from the free  and original development of each nation, and, as in a vast concert, unite  harmonious dissonances. Europe, without being conscious of its aim,  seized greedily at the means--insurrection; the only thought was to  overthrow, without yet thinking of a reconstruction. The sixteenth  century was the vanguard of the eighteenth. At all times the North had  fretted under the antipathetic yoke of the South. Under the Romans,  Germany, though frequently conquered, had never been subdued. She had  invaded the Empire and determined its fall. In the Middle Ages the  struggle had continued; not only instincts, but ideas, were in conflict;  force and spirit, violence and polity, feudalism and the Catholic  hierarchy, hereditary and elective forms, represented the opposition of  two races. In the sixteenth century the schism long anticipated took  place. The Catholic dogma had hitherto triumphed over all outbreaks--  over Arnaldo of Brescia, the Waldenses, and Wickliffe. But Luther  appeared, and the work was accomplished: Catholic unity was broken.    And this breaking with authority went on fermenting in the nations till  its last great outburst at the French Revolution; and Schiller was born  at this convulsive period, and bears strong traces of his parentage in  his anti-dogmatic spirit.    Yet there is another side to Germanism which is prone to the ideal and  the mystical, and bears still the trace of those lovely legends of  mediaeval growth to which we have adverted. For Christianity was not a  foreign and antagonistic importation in Germany; rather, the German  character obtained its completeness through Christianity. The German  found himself again in the Church of Christ, only raised, transfigured,  and sanctified. The apostolic representation of the Church as the bride  of Christ has found its fullest and truest correspondence in that of  Germany. Hence when the German spirit was thoroughly espoused to the  Christian spirit, we find that character of love, tenderness, and depth  so characteristic of the early classics of German poetry, and reappearing  in glorious afterglow in the second classics, in Klopstock, Herder, and,  above all, Schiller.    It is this special instinct for the ideal and mystical in German nature  that has enabled spirits born of negation and revolution, like Schiller,  to unite with those elements the most genial and creative inspirations of  poetry.          VOCABULARY OF TERMINOLOGY.      Absolute, The. A conception, or, more strictly, in Kantian language, an  idea of the pure reason, embracing the fundamental and necessary yet free  ground of all things.    Antinomy. The conflict of the laws of pure reason; as in the question of  free will and necessity.    Autonomy (autonomous). Governing itself by the spontaneous action of  free will.    Aesthetics. The science of beauty; as ethics of duty.    Cognition (knowledge; Germanice, \"Erkenntniss\") is either an intuition or  a conception. The former has an immediate relation to the object, and is  singular and individual; the latter has but a mediate relation, by means  of a characteristic mark, which may be common to several things.    Cognition is an objective perception.    Conception. A conception is either empirical or pure. A pure  conception, in so far as it has its origin in the understanding alone,  and is not the conception of a pure sensuous image, is called notio.    Conceptions are distinguished on the one hand from sensation and  perception, and on the other hand from the intuitions of pure reason or  ideas. They are distinctly the product of thought and of the  understanding, except when quite free from empirical elements.    Feeling (Gefuehl). That part of our nature which relates to passion and  instinct. Feelings are connected both with our sensuous nature, our  imagination, and the pure reason.    Form. See Matter.    Ideas. The product of the pure reason (Vernunft) or intuitive faculty.  Wherever the absolute is introduced in thought we have ideas. Perfection  in all its aspects is an idea, virtue and wisdom in their perfect purity  and ideas. Kant remarks (\"Critique of Pure Reason,\" Meiklejohn's  translation, p. 256): \"It is from the understanding alone that pure and  transcendental conceptions take their origin; the reason does not  properly give birth to any conception, but only frees the conception of  the understanding from the unavoidable limitation of possible"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68"],[0,"Warlord of Mars (#6)"],[1,"S,  the top leg of which debouched suddenly into a large chamber, illy  lighted, and the floor of which was completely covered by venomous  snakes and loathsome reptiles.    To have attempted to cross that floor would have been to court  instant death, and for a moment I was almost completely discouraged.  Then it occurred to me that Thurid and Matai Shang with their party  must have crossed it, and so there was a way.    Had it not been for the fortunate accident by which I overheard  even so small a portion of the therns' conversation we should  have blundered at least a step or two into that wriggling mass of  destruction, and a single step would have been all-sufficient to  have sealed our doom.    These were the only reptiles I had ever seen upon Barsoom, but I  knew from their similarity to the fossilized remains of supposedly  extinct species I had seen in the museums of Helium that they  comprised many of the known prehistoric reptilian genera, as well  as others undiscovered.    A more hideous aggregation of monsters had never before assailed my  vision.  It would be futile to attempt to describe them to Earth  men, since substance is the only thing which they possess in  common with any creature of the past or present with which you are  familiar--even their venom is of an unearthly virulence that, by  comparison, would make the cobra de capello seem quite as harmless  as an angleworm.    As they spied me there was a concerted rush by those nearest the  entrance where we stood, but a line of radium bulbs inset along the  threshold of their chamber brought them to a sudden halt--evidently  they dared not cross that line of light.    I had been quite sure that they would not venture beyond the room  in which I had discovered them, though I had not guessed at what  deterred them.  The simple fact that we had found no reptiles in  the corridor through which we had just come was sufficient assurance  that they did not venture there.    I drew Woola out of harm's way, and then began a careful survey  of as much of the Chamber of Reptiles as I could see from where  I stood.  As my eyes became accustomed to the dim light of its  interior I gradually made out a low gallery at the far end of the  apartment from which opened several exits.    Coming as close to the threshold as I dared, I followed this  gallery with my eyes, discovering that it circled the room as far  as I could see.  Then I glanced above me along the upper edge of  the entrance to which we had come, and there, to my delight, I saw  an end of the gallery not a foot above my head.  In an instant I  had leaped to it and called Woola after me.    Here there were no reptiles--the way was clear to the opposite side  of the hideous chamber--and a moment later Woola and I dropped down  to safety in the corridor beyond.    Not ten minutes later we came into a vast circular apartment  of white marble, the walls of which were inlaid with gold in the  strange hieroglyphics of the First Born.    From the high dome of this mighty apartment a huge circular column  extended to the floor, and as I watched I saw that it slowly  revolved.    I had reached the base of the Temple of the Sun!    Somewhere above me lay Dejah Thoris, and with her were Phaidor,  daughter of Matai Shang, and Thuvia of Ptarth.  But how to reach  them, now that I had found the only vulnerable spot in their mighty  prison, was still a baffling riddle.    Slowly I circled the great shaft, looking for a means of ingress.  Part way around I found a tiny radium flash torch, and as I examined  it in mild curiosity as to its presence there in this almost  inaccessible and unknown spot, I came suddenly upon the insignia  of the house of Thurid jewel-inset in its metal case.    I am upon the right trail, I thought, as I slipped the bauble into  the pocket-pouch which hung from my harness.  Then I continued  my search for the entrance, which I knew must be somewhere about;  nor had I long to search, for almost immediately thereafter I came  upon a small door so cunningly inlaid in the shaft's base that it  might have passed unnoticed by a less keen or careful observer.    There was the door that would lead me within the prison, but where  was the means to open it?  No button or lock were visible.  Again  and again I went carefully over every square inch of its surface,  but the most that I could find was a tiny pinhole a little above  and to the right of the door's center--a pinhole that seemed only  an accident of manufacture or an imperfection of material.    Into this minute aperture I attempted to peer, but whether it was  but a fraction of an inch deep or passed completely through the door  I could not tell--at least no light showed beyond it.  I put my ear  to it next and listened, but again my efforts brought negligible  results.    During these experiments Woola had been standing at my side gazing  intently at the door, and as my glance fell upon him it occurred  to me to test the correctness of my hypothesis, that this portal  had been the means of ingress to the temple used by Thurid, the  black dator, and Matai Shang, Father of Therns.    Turning away abruptly, I called to him to follow me.  For a moment  he hesitated, and then leaped after me, whining and tugging at my  harness to draw me back.  I walked on, however, some distance from  the door before I let him have his way, that I might see precisely  what he would do.  Then I permitted him to lead me wherever he  would.    Straight back to that baffling portal he dragged me, again taking  up his position facing the blank stone, gazing straight at its  shining surface.  For an hour I worked to solve the mystery of the  combination that would open the way before me.    Carefully I recalled every circumstance of my pursuit of Thurid,  and my conclusion was identical with my original belief--that Thurid  had come this way without other assistance than his own knowledge  and passed through the door that barred my progress, unaided from  within.  But how had he accomplished it?    I recalled the incident of the Chamber of Mystery in the Golden  Cliffs that time I had freed Thuvia of Ptarth from the dungeon of  the therns, and she had taken a slender, needle-like key from the  keyring of her dead jailer to open the door leading back into the  Chamber of Mystery where Tars Tarkas fought for his life with the  great banths.  Such a tiny keyhole as now defied me had opened the  way to the intricate lock in that other door.    Hastily I dumped the contents of my pocket-pouch upon the ground  before me.  Could I but find a slender bit of steel I might yet  fashion a key that would give me ingress to the temple prison.    As I examined the heterogeneous collection of odds and ends that  is always to be found in the pocket-pouch of a Martian warrior my  hand fell upon the emblazoned radium flash torch of the black dator.    As I was about to lay the thing aside as of no value in my present  predicament my eyes chanced upon a few strange characters roughly  and freshly scratched upon the soft gold of the case.    Casual curiosity prompted me to decipher them, but what I read  carried no immediate meaning to my mind.  There were three sets of  characters, one below another:                             3 |--| 50 T                           1 |--|  1 X                           9 |--| 25 T      For only an instant my curiosity was piqued, and then I replaced  the torch in my pocket-pouch, but my fingers had not unclasped  from it when there rushed to my memory the recollection of the  conversation between Lakor and his companion when the lesser thern  had quoted the words of Thurid and scoffed at them:  \"And what  think you of the ridiculous matter of the light?  Let the light  shine with the intensity of three radium units for fifty tals\"--ah,  there was the first line of characters upon the torch's metal  case--3--50 T; \"and for one xat let it shine with the intensity  of one radium unit\"--there was the second line; \"and then for  twenty-five tals with nine units.\"    The formula was complete; but--what did it mean?    I thought I knew, and, seizing a powerful magnifying glass from the  litter of my pocket-pouch, I applied myself to a careful examination  of the marble immediately about the pinhole in the door.  I could  have cried aloud in exultation when my scrutiny disclosed the almost  invisible incrustation of particles of carbonized electrons which  are thrown off by these Martian torches.    It was evident that for countless ages radium torches had been  applied to this pinhole, and for what purpose there could be but  a single answer--the mechanism of the lock was actuated by light  rays; and I, John Carter, Prince of Helium, held the combination  in my hand--scratched by the hand of my enemy upon his own torch  case.    In a cylindrical bracelet of gold about my wrist was my Barsoomian  chronometer--a delicate instrument that records the tals and xats  and zodes of Martian time, presenting them to view beneath a strong  crystal much after the manner of an earthly odometer.    Timing my operations carefully, I held the torch to the small aperture  in the door, regulating the intensity of the light by means of the  thumb-lever upon the side of the case.    For fifty tals I let three units of light shine full in the pinhole,  then one unit for one xat, and for twenty-five tals nine units.  Those last twenty-five tals were the longest twenty-five seconds  of my life.  Would the lock click at the end of those seemingly  interminable intervals of time?    Twenty-three!  Twenty-four!  Twenty-five!    I shut off the light with a snap.  For seven tals I waited--there  had been no appreciable effect upon the lock's mechanism.  Could  it be that my theory was entirely wrong?    Hold!  Had the nervous strain resulted in a hallucination, or did  the door really move?  Slowly the solid stone sank noiselessly back  into the wall--there was no"]]]
