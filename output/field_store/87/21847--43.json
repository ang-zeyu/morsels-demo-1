The thought of Royal dignity elates me,                   But leaving thee behind me breaks my heart!                                               (Addressing Gianetta and    Tessa.)      GIANETTA and TESSA (together).                Farewell, my love; on board you must be getting;                   But while upon the sea you gaily roam,              Remember that a heart for thee is fretting                   The tender little heart you've left at home!      GIA.                     Now, Marco dear,                             My wishes hear:                                  While you're away                             It's understood                             You will be good                                  And not too gay.                             To every trace                             Of maiden grace                                  You will be blind,                             And will not glance                             By any chance                                  On womankind!                               If you are wise,                             You'll shut your eyes                                  Till we arrive,                             And not address                             A lady less                                  Than forty-five.                             You'll please to frown                             On every gown                                  That you may see;                             And, O my pet,                             You won't forget                                  You've married me!                     And O my darling, O my pet,                   Whatever else you may forget,                   In yonder isle beyond the sea,                   Do not forget you've married me!      TESS.                    You'll lay your head                             Upon your bed                                  At set of sun.                             You will not sing                             Of anything                                  To any one.                             You'll sit and mope                             All day, I hope,                                  And shed a tear                             Upon the life                             Your little wife                                  Is passing here.                               And if so be                             You think of me,                                  Please tell the moon!                             I'll read it all                             In rays that fall                                  On the lagoon:                             You'll be so kind                             As tell the wind                                  How you may be,                             And send me words                             By little birds                                  To comfort me!                     And O my darling, O my pet,                   Whatever else you may forget,                   In yonder isle beyond the sea,                   Do not forget you've married me!      QUARTET.       Oh my darling, O my pet, etc.      CHORUS (during which a \"Xebeque\" is hauled alongside the quay.)                     Then away we go to an island fair                        That lies in a Southern sea:                   We know not where, and we don't much care,                        Wherever that isle may be.      THE MEN (hauling on boat).                             One, two, three,                                  Haul!                             One, two, three,                                  Haul!                             One, two, three,                                  Haul!                             With a will!      ALL.      When the breezes are a-blowing              The ship will be going,                   When they don't we shall all stand still!              Then away we go to an island fair,              We know not where, and we don't much care,                   Wherever that isle may be.                                SOLOMARCO.                          Away we go                             To a balmy isle,                        Where the roses blow                             All the winter while.      ALL (hoisting sail).                        Then away we go to an island fair                             That lies in a Southern sea:                        Then away we go to an island fair,                             Then away, then away, then away!      (The men embark on the \"Xebeque.\"  Marco and Giuseppe embracing    Gianetta and Tessa.  The girls wave a farewell to the men as the    curtain falls.)                              END OF ACT I            ACT II         SCENE.Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and    Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,    occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers    are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,    etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various    degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social    distinctionssome playing cards, others throwing dice, some    reading, others playing cup and ball, \"morra\", etc.                   CHORUS OF MEN with MARCO and GIUSEPPE.                Of happiness the very pith                             In Barataria you may see:              A monarchy that's tempered with                             Republican Equality.              This form of government we find              The beau ideal of its kind              A despotism strict combined                             With absolute equality!                             MARCO and GIUSEPPE.                Two kings, of undue pride bereft,                             Who act in perfect unity,              Whom you can order right and left                             With absolute impunity.              Who put their subjects at their ease              By doing all they can to please!              And thus, to earn their bread-and-cheese,                             Seize every opportunity.      CHORUS.   Of happiness the very pith, etc.           MAR.  Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your    expressions of satisfaction and good feelingI say, we are much    obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good    feeling.         ALL.  We heard you.         MAR.  We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with    sentiments so charmingly expressed.         ALL.  That's all right.         GIU.  At the same time there is just one little grievance    that we should like to ventilate.         ALL (angrily).  What?         GIU.  Don't be alarmedit's not serious.  It is arranged    that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we    are to act as one person.         GIORGIO.  Exactly.         GIU.  Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point    of fact, two persons.         ANNIBALE.  Ah, I don't think we can go into that.  It is a    legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things.  Situated as    we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.         GIU.  No; but you can recognize two independent appetites.    It's all very well to say we act as one person, but when you    supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it    as a legal fiction carried a little too far.         ANNI.  It's rather a nice point.  I don't like to express an    opinion off-hand.
