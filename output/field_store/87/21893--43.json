Ozma is a fairy, and so is Glinda, so no power can kill or destroy  them, but you girls are all mortals and so are Button-Bright and I, so  we must watch out for ourselves.\"    \"Nothing can kill me,\" said Ojo the Munchkin boy.    \"That is true,\" replied the Sorceress, \"and I think it may be well to  divide the searchers into several parties, that they may cover all the  land of Oz more quickly.  So I will send Ojo and Unc Nunkie and Dr.  Pipt into the Munchkin Country, which they are well acquainted with;  and I will send the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman into the Quadling  Country, for they are fearless and brave and never tire; and to the  Gillikin Country, where many dangers lurk, I will send the Shaggy Man  and his brother, with Tik-Tok and Jack Pumpkinhead.  Dorothy may make  up her own party and travel into the Winkie Country.  All of you must  inquire everywhere for Ozma and try to discover where she is hidden.\"    They thought this a very wise plan and adopted it without question. In  Ozma's absence, Glinda the Good was the most important person in Oz,  and all were glad to serve under her direction.          CHAPTER 6    THE SEARCH PARTY      Next morning as soon as the sun was up, Glinda flew back to her castle,  stopping on the way to instruct the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, who  were at that time staying at the college of Professor H. M. Wogglebug,  T.E., and taking a course of his Patent Educational Pills.    On hearing of Ozma's loss, they started at once for the Quadling  Country to search for her.  As soon as Glinda had left the Emerald  City, Tik-Tok and the Shaggy Man and Jack Pumpkinhead, who had been  present at the conference, began their journey into the Gillikin  Country, and an hour later Ojo and Unc Nunkie joined Dr.  Pipt and  together they traveled toward the Munchkin Country.  When all these  searchers were gone, Dorothy and the Wizard completed their own  preparations.    The Wizard hitched the Sawhorse to the Red Wagon, which would seat four  very comfortably.  He wanted Dorothy, Betsy, Trot and the Patchwork  Girl to ride in the wagon, but Scraps came up to them mounted upon the  Woozy, and the Woozy said he would like to join the party.  Now this  Woozy was a most peculiar animal, having a square head, square body,  square legs and square tail.  His skin was very tough and hard,  resembling leather, and while his movements were somewhat clumsy, the  beast could travel with remarkable swiftness. His square eyes were mild  and gentle in expression, and he was not especially foolish.  The Woozy  and the Patchwork Girl were great friends, and so the Wizard agreed to  let the Woozy go with them.    Another great beast now appeared and asked to go along.  This was none  other than the famous Cowardly Lion, one of the most interesting  creatures in all Oz.  No lion that roamed the jungles or plains could  compare in size or intelligence with this Cowardly Lion, who--like all  animals living in Oz--could talk and who talked with more shrewdness  and wisdom than many of the people did.  He said he was cowardly  because he always trembled when he faced danger, but he had faced  danger many times and never refused to fight when it was necessary.  This Lion was a great favorite with Ozma and always guarded her throne  on state occasions.  He was also an old companion and friend of the  Princess Dorothy, so the girl was delighted to have him join the party.    \"I'm so nervous over our dear Ozma,\" said the Cowardly Lion in his  deep, rumbling voice, \"that it would make me unhappy to remain behind  while you are trying to find her.  But do not get into any danger, I  beg of you, for danger frightens me terribly.\"    \"We'll not get into danger if we can poss'bly help it,\" promised  Dorothy, \"but we shall do anything to find Ozma, danger or no danger.\"    The addition of the Woozy and the Cowardly Lion to the party gave Betsy  Bobbin an idea, and she ran to the marble stables at the rear of the  palace and brought out her mule, Hank by name.  Perhaps no mule you  ever saw was so lean and bony and altogether plain looking as this  Hank, but Betsy loved him dearly because he was faithful and steady and  not nearly so stupid as most mules are considered to be.  Betsy had a  saddle for Hank, and he declared she would ride on his back, an  arrangement approved by the Wizard because it left only four of the  party to ride on the seats of the Red Wagon--Dorothy and Button-Bright  and Trot and himself.    An old sailor man who had one wooden leg came to see them off and  suggested that they put a supply of food and blankets in the Red Wagon  inasmuch as they were uncertain how long they would be gone.  This  sailor man was called Cap'n Bill.  He was a former friend and comrade  of Trot and had encountered many adventures in company with the little  girl.  I think he was sorry he could not go with her on this trip, but  Glinda the Sorceress had asked Cap'n Bill to remain in the Emerald City  and take charge of the royal palace while everyone else was away, and  the one-legged sailor had agreed to do so.    They loaded the back end of the Red Wagon with everything they thought  they might need, and then they formed a procession and marched from the  palace through the Emerald City to the great gates of the wall that  surrounded this beautiful capital of the Land of Oz.  Crowds of  citizens lined the streets to see them pass and to cheer them and wish  them success, for all were grieved over Ozma's loss and anxious that  she be found again.  First came the Cowardly Lion, then the Patchwork  Girl riding upon the Woozy, then Betsy Bobbin on her mule Hank, and  finally the Sawhorse drawing the Red Wagon, in which were seated the  Wizard and Dorothy and Button-Bright and Trot.  No one was obliged to  drive the Sawhorse, so there were no reins to his harness; one had only  to tell him which way to go, fast or slow, and he understood perfectly.    It was about this time that a shaggy little black dog who had been  lying asleep in Dorothy's room in the palace woke up and discovered he  was lonesome.  Everything seemed very still throughout the great  building, and Toto--that was the little dog's name--missed the  customary chatter of the three girls.  He never paid much attention to  what was going on around him, and although he could speak, he seldom  said anything, so the little dog did not know about Ozma's loss or that  everyone had gone in search of her.  But he liked to be with people,  and especially with his own mistress, Dorothy, and having yawned and  stretched himself and found the door of the room ajar, he trotted out  into the corridor and went down the stately marble stairs to the hall  of the palace, where he met Jellia Jamb.    \"Where's Dorothy?\" asked Toto.    \"She's gone to the Winkie Country,\" answered the maid.    \"When?\"    \"A little while ago,\" replied Jellia.    Toto turned and trotted out into the palace garden and down the long  driveway until he came to the streets of the Emerald City.  Here he  paused to listen, and hearing sounds of cheering, he ran swiftly along  until he came in sight of the Red Wagon and the Woozy and the Lion and  the Mule and all the others.  Being a wise little dog, he decided not  to show himself to Dorothy just then, lest he be sent back home, but he  never lost sight of the party of travelers, all of whom were so eager  to get ahead that they never thought to look behind them.  When they  came to the gates in the city wall, the Guardian of the Gates came out  to throw wide the golden portals and let them pass through.    \"Did any strange person come in or out of the city on the night before  last when Ozma was stolen?\" asked Dorothy.    \"No indeed, Princess,\" answered the Guardian of the Gates.    \"Of course not,\" said the Wizard. \"Anyone clever enough to steal all  the things we have lost would not mind the barrier of a wall like this  in the least.  I think the thief must have flown through the air, for  otherwise he could not have stolen from Ozma's royal palace and  Glinda's faraway castle in the same night.  Moreover, as there are no  airships in Oz and no way for airships from the outside world to get  into this country, I believe the thief must have flown from place to  place by means of magic arts which neither Glinda nor I understand.\"    On they went, and before the gates closed behind them, Toto managed to  dodge through them.  The country surrounding the Emerald City was  thickly settled, and for a while our friends rode over nicely paved  roads which wound through a fertile country dotted with beautiful  houses, all built in the quaint Oz fashion.  In the course of a few  hours, however, they had left the tilled fields and entered the Country  of the Winkies, which occupies a quarter of all the territory in the  Land of Oz but is not so well known as many other parts of Ozma's  fairyland.  Long before night the travelers had crossed the Winkie  River near to the Scarecrow's Tower (which was now vacant) and had  entered the Rolling Prairie where few people live.  They asked everyone  they met for news of Ozma, but none in this district had seen her or  even knew that she had been stolen.  And by nightfall they had passed  all the farmhouses and were obliged to stop and ask for shelter at the  hut of a lonely shepherd.  When they halted, Toto was not far behind.  The little dog halted, too, and stealing softly around the party, he  hid himself behind the hut.    The shepherd was a kindly old man and treated the travelers with much  courtesy.  He slept out of doors that night, giving up his hut to the  three girls, who made their beds on the floor with the blankets they  had brought in the Red"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#6)"],[1,"or shut those big doors without a stepladder.\"    \"Perhaps, if we go nearer, we shall find out whether anybody lives  there or not,\" suggested Woot. \"Looks to me as if nobody lived there.\"    On they went, and when they reached the center of the valley, where the  great stone castle stood, it was beginning to grow dark. So they  hesitated as to what to do.    \"If friendly people happen to live here,\" said Woot. \"I shall be glad  of a bed; but should enemies occupy the place, I prefer to sleep upon  the ground.\"    \"And if no one at all lives here,\" added the Scarecrow, \"we can enter,  and take possession, and make ourselves at home.\"    While speaking he went nearer to one of the great doors, which was  three times as high and broad as any he had ever seen in a house  before, and then he discovered, engraved in big letters upon a stone  over the doorway, the words:        \"YOOP CASTLE\"    \"Oho!\" he exclaimed; \"I know the place now. This was probably the home  of Mr. Yoop, a terrible giant whom I have seen confined in a cage, a  long way from here. Therefore this castle is likely to be empty and we  may use it in any way we please.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said the Tin Emperor, nodding; \"I also remember Mr. Yoop.  But how are we to get into his deserted castle? The latch of the door  is so far above our heads that none of us can reach it.\"    They considered this problem for a while, and then Woot said to the Tin  Man:    \"If I stand upon your shoulders, I think I can unlatch the door.\"    \"Climb up, then,\" was the reply, and when the boy was perched upon the  tin shoulders of Nick Chopper, he was just able to reach the latch and  raise it.    At once the door swung open, its great hinges making a groaning sound  as if in protest, so Woot leaped down and followed his companions into  a big, bare hallway. Scarcely were the three inside, however, when they  heard the door slam shut behind them, and this astonished them because  no one had touched it. It had closed of its own accord, as if by magic.  Moreover, the latch was on the outside, and the thought occurred to  each one of them that they were now prisoners in this unknown castle.    \"However,\" mumbled the Scarecrow, \"we are not to blame for what cannot  be helped; so let us push bravely ahead and see what may be seen.\"    It was quite dark in the hallway, now that the outside door was shut,  so as they stumbled along a stone passage they kept close together, not  knowing what danger was likely to befall them.    Suddenly a soft glow enveloped them. It grew brighter, until they could  see their surroundings distinctly. They had reached the end of the  passage and before them was another huge door. This noiselessly swung  open before them, without the help of anyone, and through the doorway  they observed a big chamber, the walls of which were lined with plates  of pure gold, highly polished.    This room was also lighted, although they could discover no lamps, and  in the center of it was a great table at which sat an immense woman.  She was clad in silver robes embroidered with gay floral designs, and  wore over this splendid raiment a short apron of elaborate lace-work.  Such an apron was no protection, and was not in keeping with the  handsome gown, but the huge woman wore it, nevertheless. The table at  which she sat was spread with a white cloth and had golden dishes upon  it, so the travelers saw that they had surprised the Giantess while she  was eating her supper.    She had her back toward them and did not even turn around, but taking a  biscuit from a dish she began to butter it and said in a voice that was  big and deep but not especially unpleasant:    \"Why don't you come in and allow the door to shut? You're causing a  draught, and I shall catch cold and sneeze. When I sneeze, I get cross,  and when I get cross I'm liable to do something wicked. Come in, you  foolish strangers; come in!\"    Being thus urged, they entered the room and approached the table, until  they stood where they faced the great Giantess. She continued eating,  but smiled in a curious way as she looked at them. Woot noticed that  the door had closed silently after they had entered, and that didn't  please him at all.    \"Well,\" said the Giantess, \"what excuse have you to offer?\"    \"We didn't know anyone lived here, Madam,\" explained the Scarecrow;  \"so, being travelers and strangers in these parts, and wishing to find  a place for our boy friend to sleep, we ventured to enter your castle.\"    \"You knew it was private property, I suppose?\" said she, buttering  another biscuit.    \"We saw the words, 'Yoop Castle,' over the door, but we knew that Mr.  Yoop is a prisoner in a cage in a far-off part of the land of Oz, so we  decided there was no one now at home and that we might use the castle  for the night.\"    \"I see,\" remarked the Giantess, nodding her head and smiling again in  that curious way--a way that made Woot shudder. \"You didn't know that  Mr. Yoop was married, or that after he was cruelly captured his wife  still lived in his castle and ran it to suit herself.\"    \"Who captured Mr. Yoop?\" asked Woot, looking gravely at the big woman.    \"Wicked enemies. People who selfishly objected to Yoop's taking their  cows and sheep for his food. I must admit, however, that Yoop had a bad  temper, and had the habit of knocking over a few houses, now and then,  when he was angry. So one day the little folks came in a great crowd  and captured Mr. Yoop, and carried him away to a cage somewhere in the  mountains. I don't know where it is, and I don't care, for my husband  treated me badly at times, forgetting the respect a giant owes to a  giantess. Often he kicked me on my shins, when I wouldn't wait on him.  So I'm glad he is gone.\"    \"It's a wonder the people didn't capture you, too,\" remarked Woot.    \"Well, I was too clever for them,\" said she, giving a sudden laugh that  caused such a breeze that the wobbly Scarecrow was almost blown off his  feet and had to grab his friend Nick Chopper to steady himself. \"I saw  the people coming,\" continued Mrs. Yoop, \"and knowing they meant  mischief I transformed myself into a mouse and hid in a cupboard. After  they had gone away, carrying my shin-kicking husband with them, I  transformed myself back to my former shape again, and here I've lived  in peace and comfort ever since.\"    \"Are you a Witch, then?\" inquired Woot.    \"Well, not exactly a Witch,\" she replied, \"but I'm an Artist in  Transformations. In other words, I'm more of a Yookoohoo than a Witch,  and of course you know that the Yookoohoos are the cleverest  magic-workers in the world.\"    The travelers were silent for a time, uneasily considering this  statement and the effect it might have on their future. No doubt the  Giantess had wilfully made them her prisoners; yet she spoke so  cheerfully, in her big voice, that until now they had not been alarmed  in the least.    By and by the Scarecrow, whose mixed brains had been working steadily,  asked the woman:    \"Are we to consider you our friend, Mrs. Yoop, or do you intend to be  our enemy?\"    \"I never have friends,\" she said in a matter-of-fact tone, \"because  friends get too familiar and always forget to mind their own business.  But I am not your enemy; not yet, anyhow. Indeed, I'm glad you've come,  for my life here is rather lonely. I've had no one to talk to since I  transformed Polychrome, the Daughter of the Rainbow, into a  canary-bird.\"    \"How did you manage to do that?\" asked the Tin Woodman, in amazement.  \"Polychrome is a powerful fairy!\"    \"She was,\" said the Giantess; \"but now she's a canary-bird. One day  after a rain, Polychrome danced off the Rainbow and fell asleep on a  little mound in this valley, not far from my castle. The sun came out  and drove the Rainbow away, and before Poly wakened, I stole out and  transformed her into a canary-bird in a gold cage studded with  diamonds. The cage was so she couldn't fly away. I expected she'd sing  and talk and we'd have good times together; but she has proved no  company for me at all. Ever since the moment of her transformation, she  has refused to speak a single word.\"    \"Where is she now?\" inquired Woot, who had heard tales of lovely  Polychrome and was much interested in her.    \"The cage is hanging up in my bedroom,\" said the Giantess, eating  another biscuit. The travelers were now  more uneasy and suspicious of  the Giantess than before. If Polychrome, the Rainbow's Daughter, who  was a real fairy, had been transformed and enslaved by this huge woman,  who claimed to be a Yookoohoo, what was liable to happen to them? Said  the Scarecrow, twisting his stuffed head around in Mrs. Yoop's  direction:    \"Do you know, Ma'am, who we are?\"    \"Of course,\" said she; \"a straw man, a tin man and a boy.\"    \"We are very important people,\" declared the Tin Woodman.    \"All the better,\" she replied. \"I shall enjoy your society the more on  that account. For I mean to keep you here as long as I live, to amuse  me when I get lonely. And,\" she added slowly, \"in this Valley no one  ever dies.\"    They didn't like this speech at all, so the Scarecrow frowned in a way  that made Mrs. Yoop smile, while the Tin Woodman looked so fierce that  Mrs. Yoop laughed. The Scarecrow suspected she was going to laugh, so  he slipped behind his friends to escape the wind from her breath.  From  this safe position he said warningly:    \"We have powerful friends who will soon come to rescue us.\"    \"Let them come,\" she returned, with an accent of scorn. \"When they get  here they will find neither a boy, nor a tin man, nor a scarecrow, for  tomorrow morning I intend to transform you all into other shapes, so  that you cannot be recognized.\"    This threat filled them with dismay. The good-natured Giantess was more  terrible than they had imagined. She could smile and wear pretty  clothes and at the same time be even more cruel than her wicked husband  had been.
