To be  sure, there is something in the taste of the times; a modern work is  expressly adapted to modern readers. It appeals to our direct  experience, and to well-known subjects; it is part and parcel of the  world around us, and is drawn from the same sources as our daily  thoughts. There is, therefore, so far, a natural or habitual sympathy  between us and the literature of the day, though this is a different  consideration from the mere circumstance of novelty. An author now  alive, has a right to calculate upon the living public; he cannot count  upon the dead, nor look forward with much confidence to those that are  unborn. Neither, however, is it true that we are eager to read all new  books alike; we turn from them with a certain feeling of distaste and  distrust, unless they are recommended to us by some peculiar feature or  obvious distinction. Only young ladies from the boarding-school, or  milliners' girls, read all the new novels that come out. It must be  spoken of or against; the writer's name must be well known or a great  secret; it must be a topic of discourse and a mark for criticism--that  is, it must be likely to bring us into notice in some way--or we take  no notice of it. There is a mutual and tacit understanding on this head.  We can no more read all the new books that appear, than we can read all  the old ones that have disappeared from time to time.--_Monthly  Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *        THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF NEW WORKS.           *       *       *       *       *      THE PALACE OF ALI PASHA.      The secretary carried us through several chambers, decorated with much  cost and barbarous splendour. The wainscot of one of the principal  saloons is inlaid with mother-of-pearl, ebony, coral, and ivory; but the  workmanship seems harsh and ungraceful. The ceiling is plastered with  massive gilding, the effect of which is rather cumbrous than ornamental;  \"not graced with elegancy, but daubed with cost.\" Pillars, of a  composition to resemble the richest marble, support the compartments,  and the cornice is coloured with some imperfect efforts at arabesque  painting. There is, however, one article extremely elegant and  well-finished--a low sofa, carried round three-fourths of the room,  covered with dark velvet, tastefully embroidered, and hung with gold  fringe. The general arrangement of the rooms is certainly, grand and  imposing, though occasionally deformed by much bad taste. I should not  omit to mention, that our conductor desired us to notice two very  handsome carpets, which he gave us to understand were of British  manufacture. In the apartment where Ali sleeps, the walls are hung with  sabres and fire-arms of different descriptions; all of which are  ornamented with precious stones. One of the scimitars is profusely  adorned with diamonds and rubies, and a particular musket has a  cartouche-box, studded with brilliants of surpassing splendour, the  central stone being nearly the size of a die. A fowling-piece, sent to  the pasha by Bonaparte, is also enriched with gems, though this last  article is considered to derive its chief value from the circumstance of  having been once the property of the imperial warrior, by whom it was  presented. The chamber opens into a long and spacious gallery; at one  extremity we observed a singularly awkward piece of furniture,  resembling a large old-fashioned arm-chair. So useless an article in a  Turkish palace induced me to inquire the purpose to which it was  applied; and I was informed that, on certain festivals, the pasha gives  an entertainment for the diversion of the children of the principal  families in the capital, who on such occasions assemble in the gallery.  Ali himself always attends, to encourage and assist their gaiety; and,  while reclining on this cumbrous seat, distributes to them, as they are  successively presented to him, baskets of sweetmeats, and such other  tokens of regard as are suited to their respective ages and  condition.--_Narrative of an Excursion from Corfu to Smyrna_.           *       *       *       *       *      POLICE OFFICES AND POLICE REPORTS.      The police reports are frequently the most amusing part of the daily  press: they let the reader into many of the secrets of low, and, now and  then, of high life; they are redolent of the phraseology of the vulgar;  they often tickle our fancies by their humour, and sometimes touch our  sympathies by their pathos. As anecdotes of real life; daily catalogues  of droll and dismal occurrences among our fellow-citizens; pictures of  what is passing in the streets while we, who are sober sort of folks,  are dreaming in our beds; sketches of manners, and records of the  habits, feelings, and minor as well as major delinquencies of those who  breathe the same air with us; they could not fail to be interesting to  us all, were we not aware that, like the novels which are said to be  \"founded on fact,\" their most rich and racy parts are frequently  fiction.    Let not the non-gnostic portion of our readers imagine, that if they  haunt the justice-seat of Birnie and his judicial co-mates, that they  will ever witness such pleasant, sparkling, humorous examinations as  those reported in the columns of the papers which matinally grace their  breakfast-tables. The tyro upon town will stare at this. Why, will he  say, cannot I, if I frequent the same place, see and hear what those who  are employed for the press see and hear there? He can; but the fact is,  that our police reporters are by far too clever to set down the words of  other people, without throwing in something of their own. Their plan is  to drop the duller parts of a story or a speech, and to embellish its  livelier portion--to select the tit-bits, and sauce and spice them up  sufficiently high to please the palates of the news-reading public. The  offices afford them an excellent variety of characters, which, like  skilful dramatists, they work up until they become really humorous: many  of the cases afford them capital plots, into which they cleverly  dovetail pleasant little episodes, and adhere no closer to the deposed  facts than many of our by-gone playwrights have done to the sacred page  of history. We allude only to the cases of humour which occur at the  police-offices: those reports which can be interesting only in  proportion as they are correct, are, in general, accurately given; but  the matrimonial squabbles, the Irish farcettas, and the frays between  the Dogberrys of the night and late walkers--albeit they may,  peradventure, contain the leading facts disclosed--are highly wrought up  by the fanciful powers of those who cause the public and feed themselves  at a per-line-age for the daily press. Many cases which, on hearing, are  dull and oftentimes disgusting, under the magic pens of the  police-office scribes become lively and entertaining; they are furnished  with the raw material--the metal in its ore--which they purify and  polish, until it bears little or no resemblance to what it was before it  underwent the process of manufacturing for the paper-market under their  skilful hands. There are many who delight to visit the police-offices  for the sake of seeing those beings who appear there, of whom others  only read: some of our readers may, perhaps, be bitten with a similar  fancy; but, we warrant, that they will find the actual doings at  Bow-street very different to what they had imagined; as Charles Mathews'  _Sir Harry Skelton_ says, \"There's nothing at all in it; people talk a  great deal about it--but there's nothing in it, after all--nothing.\"    It is not often that we look in at morning or evening sitting of the  magistrates; we are content to have the police reports served up to us  with our potted beef and buttered toast at breakfast; we enjoy them,  although we feel convinced that many of them bear no more resemblance to  the affairs they are founded on, than mock-turtle to calf's-head; still,  like the soup, they are by far the most pleasant and palatable of the  two.--_Every Night Book_.           *       *       *       *       *      THE CURRAL.      The view in front was obstructed by a high ridge, of which we had nearly  gained the highest point, when we left our horses, and running up a few  yards of steep turf found ourselves all at once on the brink of the  Curral. It is a huge valley, or rather crater, of immense depth,  enclosed on all sides by a range of magnificent mountain precipices, the  sides and summit of which are broken in every variety of buttress or  pinnacle--now black and craggy and beetling--at other times spread with  the richest green turf, and scattered with a profusion of the evergreen  forest-trees, indigenous to the island; while far below, in the midst of  all these horrors, smiles a fairy region of cultivation and  fruitfulness, with a church and village, the white cabins of which seem  half smothered in the luxuriance of their own vines and orchards.    We gazed long and eagerly at the prospect. It is not easy to give an  accurate notion of its peculiar character; and even painting would but  ill assist, for one of the most striking features is the great and  sudden _depth_ which you look down, the effect of which we know the  pencil cannot at all convey. The side on which we stand, however, though  steep, is not absolutely precipitous; on the contrary, the gradation of  crag and projection, by which it descends to the bottom, is one of the  finest things in the view. Close on our right a lofty peak presents its  rocky face to the valley, to which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9925"],[0,"Black Jack (#6)"],[1,"taste. He became the most dreaded manhunter in those districts where  manhunting was most common. He had been sheriff at Craterville for a  dozen years now, and still his supremacy was not even questioned.    Vance Cornish was lucky to find the sheriff in town presiding at the head  of the long table of the hotel at dinner. He was a man of great dignity.  He wore his stiff black hair, still untarnished by gray, very long,  brushing it with difficulty to keep it behind his ears. This mass of  black hair framed a long, stern face, the angles of which had been made  by years. But there was no sign of weakness. He had grown dry, not  flabby. His mouth was a thin, straight line, and his fighting chin jutted  out in profile.    He rose from his place to greet Vance Cornish. Indeed, the sheriff acted  the part of master of ceremonies at the hotel, having a sort of silent  understanding with the widow who owned the place. It was said that the  sheriff would marry the woman sooner or later, he so loved to talk at her  table. His talk doubled her business. Her table afforded him an audience;  so they needed one another.    \"You don't remember me,\" said Vance.    \"I got a tolerable poor memory for faces,\" admitted the sheriff.    \"I'm Cornish, of the Cornish ranch.\"    The sheriff was duly impressed. The Cornish ranch was a show place. He  arranged a chair for Vance at his right, and presently the talk rose  above the murmur to which it had been depressed by the arrival of this  important stranger. The increasing noise made a background. It left Vance  alone with the sheriff.    \"And how do you find your work, sheriff?\" asked Vance; for he knew that  Uncle Joe Minter's great weakness was his love of talk. Everyone in the  mountains knew it, for that matter.    \"Dull,\" complained Minter. \"Men ain't what they used to be, or else the  law is a heap stronger.\"    \"The men who enforce the law are,\" said Vance.    The sheriff absorbed this patent compliment with the blank eye of  satisfaction and rubbed his chin.    \"But they's been some talk of rustling, pretty recent. I'm waiting for it  to grow and get ripe. Then I'll bust it.\"    He made an eloquent gesture which Vance followed. He was distinctly  pleased with the sheriff. For Minter was wonderfully preserved. His face  seemed five years younger than his age. His body seemed even younger--  round, smooth, powerful muscles padding his shoulders and stirring down  the length of his big arms. And his hands had that peculiar light  restlessness of touch which Vance remembered to have seen--in the hands  of Terence Colby, alias Hollis!    \"And how's things up your way?\" continued the sheriff.    \"Booming. By the way, how long is it since you've seen the ranch?\"    \"Never been there. Bear Creek Valley has always been a quiet place since  the Cornishes moved in; and they ain't been any call for a gent in my  line of business up that way.\"    He grinned with satisfaction, and Vance nodded.    \"If times are dull, why not drop over? We're having a celebration there  in five days. Come and look us over.\"    \"Maybe I might, and maybe I mightn't,\" said the sheriff. \"All depends.\"    \"And bring some friends with you,\" insisted Vance.    Then he wisely let the subject drop and went on to a detailed description  of the game in the hills around the ranch. That, he knew, would bring the  sheriff if anything would. But he mentioned the invitation no more. There  were particular reasons why he must not press it on the sheriff any more  than on others in Craterville.    The next morning, before traintime, Vance went to the post office and  left the article on Black Jack addressed to Terence Colby at the Cornish  ranch. The addressing was done on a typewriter, which completely removed  any means of identifying the sender. Vance played with Providence in only  one way. He was so eager to strike his blow at the last possible moment  that he asked the postmaster to hold the letter for three days, which  would land it at the ranch on the morning of the birthday. Then he went  to the train.    His self-respect was increasing by leaps and bounds. The game was still  not won, but, starring with absolutely nothing, in six days he had  planted a charge which might send Elizabeth's twenty-four years of labor  up in smoke.    He got off the train at Preston, the station nearest the ranch, and took  a hired team up the road along Bear Creek Gorge. They debouched out of  the Blue Mountains into the valley of the ranch in the early evening, and  Vance found himself looking with new eyes on the little kingdom. He felt  the happiness, indeed, of one who has lost a great prize and then put  himself in a fair way of winning it back.    They dipped into the valley road. Over the tops of the big silver spruces  he traced the outline of Sleep Mountain against the southern sky. Who but  Vance, or the dwellers in the valley, would be able to duly appreciate  such beauty? If there were any wrong in what he had done, this thought  consoled him: the ends justified the means.    Now, as they drew closer, through the branches he made out glimpses of  the dim, white front of the big house on the hill. That big, cool house  with the kingdom spilled out at its feet, the farming lands, the pastures  of the hills, and the rich forest of the upper mountains. Certainty came  to Vance Cornish. He wanted the ranch so profoundly that the thought of  losing it became impossible.        CHAPTER 6      But while he had been working at a distance, things had been going on  apace at the ranch, a progress which had now gathered such impetus that  he found himself incapable of checking it. The blow fell immediately  after dinner that same evening. Terence excused himself early to retire  to the mysteries of a new pump-gun. Elizabeth and Vance took their coffee  into the library.    The night had turned cool, with a sharp wind driving the chill through  every crack; so a few sticks were sending their flames crumbling against  the big back log. The lamp glowing in the corner was the only other  light, and when they drew their chairs close to the hearth, great tongues  of shadows leaped and fell on the wall behind them. Vance looked at his  sister with concern. There was a certain complacency about her this  evening that told him in advance that she had formed a new plan with  which she was well pleased. And he had come to dread her plans.    She always filled him with awe--and never more so than tonight, with her  thin, homely face illuminated irregularly and by flashes. He kept  watching her from the side, with glances.    \"I think I know why you've gone away for these few days,\" she said.    \"To get used to the new idea,\" he admitted with such frankness that she  turned to him with unusual sympathy. \"It was rather a shock at first.\"    \"I know it was. And I wasn't diplomatic. There's too much man in me,  Vance. Altogether too much, while you--\"    She closed her lips suddenly. But he knew perfectly the unspoken words.  She was about to suggest that there was too little man in him. He dropped  his chin in his hand, partly for comfort and partly to veil the sneer. If  she could have followed what he had done in the past six days!    \"And you are used to the new idea?\"    \"You see that I'm back before the time was up and ahead of my promise,\"  he said.    She nodded. \"Which paves the way for another new idea of mine.\"    He felt that a blow was coming and nerved himself against the shock of  it. But the preparation was merely like tensing one's muscles against a  fall. When the shock came, it stunned him.    \"Vance, I've decided to adopt Terence!\"    His fingertips sank into his cheek, bruising the flesh. What would become  of his six days of work? What would become of his cunning and his  forethought? All destroyed at a blow. For if she adopted the boy, the  very law would keep her from denying him afterward. For a moment it  seemed to him that some devil must have forewarned her of his plans.    \"You don't approve?\" she said at last, anxiously.    He threw himself back in the chair and laughed. All his despair went into  that hollow, ringing sound.    \"Approve? It's a queer question to ask me. But let it go. I know I  couldn't change you.\"    \"I know that you have a right to advise,\" she said gently. \"You are my  father's son and you have a right to advise on the placing of his name.\"    He had to keep fighting against surging desires to throw his rage in her  face. But he mastered himself, except for a tremor of his voice.    \"When are you going to do it?\"    \"Tomorrow.\"    \"Elizabeth, why not wait until after the birthday ceremony?\"    \"Because I've been haunted by peculiar fears, since our last talk, that  something might happen before that time. I've actually lain awake at  night and thought about it! And I want to forestall all chances. I want  to rivet him to me!\"    He could see by her eagerness that her mind had been irrevocably made up,  and that nothing could change her. She wanted agreement, not advice. And  with consummate bitterness of soul he submitted to his fate.    \"I suppose you're right. Call him down now and I'll be present when you  ask him to join the circle--the family circle of the Cornishes, you  know.\"    He could not school all the bitterness out of his voice, but she seemed  too glad of his bare acquiescence to object to such trifles. She sent Wu  Chi to call Terence down to them. He had apparently been in his shirt  sleeves working at the gun. He came with his hands still faintly  glistening from their hasty washing, and with the coat which he had just  bundled into still rather bunched around his big shoulders. He came and  stood against the massive, rough-finished stones of the fireplace looking  down at Elizabeth. There had always been a sort of silent understanding  between him and Vance. They never exchanged more words and looks than  were absolutely necessary. Vance realized it more than ever as he "]]]
