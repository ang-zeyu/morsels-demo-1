You are really a very useless girl for your  age.\"    \"There are heaps of things I could do.\"    \"Tell me a few of them.\"    I was silent. The professions at which I felt I had the latent power to  excel, were I but given a chance, were in a sphere far above us, and to  mention my feelings and ambitions to my matter-of-fact practical mother  would bring upon me worse ridicule than I was already forced to endure  day by day.    \"Mention a few of the things you could do.\"    I might as well have named flying as the professions I was thinking of.  Music was the least unmentionable of them, so I brought it forward.    \"Music! But it would take years of training and great expense before you  could earn anything at that! It is quite out of the question. The only  thing for you to do is to settle down and take interest in your work,  and help make a living at home, or else go out as a nurse-girl, and work  your way up. If you have any ability in you it would soon show. If you  think you could do such strokes, and the home work is not good enough  for you, go out and show the world what a wonderful creature you are.\"    \"Mother, you are unjust and cruel!\" I exclaimed. \"You do not understand  one at all. I never thought I could do strokes. I cannot help being  constituted so that grimy manual labour is hateful to me, for it is  hateful to me, and I hate it more and more every day, and you can preach  and preach till you go black in the face, and still I'll hate it more  than ever. If I have to do it all my life, and if I'm cursed with a long  life, I'll hate it just as much at the end as I do now. I'm sure it's  not any wish of mine that I'm born with inclinations for better things.  If I could be born again, and had the designing of myself, I'd be born  the lowest and coarsest-minded person imaginable, so that I could find  plenty of companionship, or I'd be born an idiot, which would be better  still.\"    \"Sybylla!\" said my mother in a shocked tone. \"It is a wonder God doesn't  strike you dead; I never heard--\"    \"I don't believe there is a God,\" I said fiercely, \"and if there is,  He's not the merciful being He's always depicted, or He wouldn't be  always torturing me for His own amusement.\"    \"Sybylla, Sybylla! That I should ever have nurtured a child to grow up  like this! Do you know that--\"    \"I only know that I hate this life. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it,\" I  said vehemently.    \"Talk about going out to earn your own living! Why, there's not a woman  living would have you in her house above a day. You are a perfect  she-devil. Oh God!\" And my mother began to cry. \"What have I done to be  cursed with such a child? There is not another woman in the district  with such a burden put upon her. What have I done? I can only trust that  my prayers to God for you will soften your evil heart.\"    \"If your prayers are answered, it's more than ever mine were,\" I  retorted.    \"_Your_ prayers!\" said my mother, with scorn. \"The horror of a child not  yet sixteen being so hardened. I don't know what to make of you, you  never cry or ask forgiveness. There's dear little Gertie now, she is  often naughty, but when I correct her she frets and worries and shows  herself to be a human being and not a fiend.\"    So saying my mother went out of the room.    \"I've asked forgiveness once too often, to be sat upon for my pains,\" I  called out.    \"I believe you're mad. That is the only feasible excuse I can make for  your conduct,\" she said as a parting shot.    \"Why the deuce don't you two get to bed and not wrangle like a pair of  cats in the middle of the night, disturbing a man's rest?\" came in my  father's voice from amid the bedclothes.    My mother is a good woman--a very good woman--and I am, I think, not  quite all criminality, but we do not pull together. I am a piece of  machinery which, not understanding, my mother winds up the wrong way,  setting all the wheels of my composition going in creaking discord.    She wondered why I did not cry and beg forgiveness, and thereby give  evidence of being human. I was too wrought up for tears. Ah, that tears  might have come to relieve my overburdened heart! I took up the  home-made tallow candle in its tin stick and looked at my pretty  sleeping sister Gertie (she and I shared the one bed). It was as mother  had said. If Gertie was scolded for any of her shortcomings, she  immediately took refuge in tears, said she was sorry, obtained  forgiveness, and straightaway forgot the whole matter. She came within  the range of mother's understanding, I did not; she had feelings, mother  thought, I had none. Did my mother understand me, she would know that I  am capable of more depths of agony and more exquisite heights of joy in  one day than Gertie will experience in her whole life.    Was I mad as mother had said? A fear took possession of me that I might  be. I certainly was utterly different to any girl I had seen or known.  What was the hot wild spirit which surged within me? Ah, that I might  weep! I threw myself on my bed and moaned. Why was I not like other  girls? Why was I not like Gertie? Why were not a new dress, everyday  work, and an occasional picnic sufficient to fill my mind? My movements  awakened Gertie.    \"What is the matter, dear Sybylla? Come to bed. Mother has been scolding  you. She is always scolding some one. That doesn't matter. You say you  are sorry, and she won't scold any more. That's what I always do. Do get  into bed. You'll be tired in the morning.\"    \"What does it matter if I will be. I wish I would be dead. What's the  good of a hateful thing like I am being alive. No one wants or cares for  me.\"    \"I love you, Sybylla, better than all the rest. I could not do without  you,\" and she put her pretty face to mine and kissed me.    What a balm to the tempest-tossed soul is a little love, though it may  be fleeting and fickle! I was able to weep now, with wild hot tears, and  with my sister's arms around me I fell asleep without undressing  further.          CHAPTER SEVEN    Was E'er a Rose Without Its Thorn?      I arose from bed next morning with three things in my head--a pair of  swollen eyes, a heavy pain, and a fixed determination to write a book.  Nothing less than a book. A few hours' work in the keen air of a late  autumn morning removed the swelling from my eyes and the pain from my  temples, but the idea of relieving my feelings in writing had taken firm  root in my brain. It was not my first attempt in this direction. Two  years previously I had purloined paper and sneaked out of bed every  night at one or two o'clock to write a prodigious novel in point of  length and detail, in which a full-fledged hero and heroine performed  the duties of a hero and heroine in the orthodox manner. Knowing our  circumstances, my grandmother was accustomed, when writing to me, to  enclose a stamp to enable me to reply. These I saved, and with them sent  my book to the leading Sydney publisher. After waiting many weeks I  received a polite memo to the effect that the story showed great  ability, but the writer's inexperience was too much in evidence for  publication. The writer was to study the best works of literature, and  would one day, no doubt, take a place among Australian novelists.    This was a very promising opinion of the work of a child of thirteen,  more encouraging than the great writers got at the start of their  literary career; but it seemed to even my childish intelligence that the  memo was a stereotyped affair that the publisher sent in answer to all  the MSS. of fameless writers submitted to him, and also sent in all  probability without reading as much as the name of the story. After that  I wrote a few short stories and essays; but now the spirit moved me to  write another book--not with any hope of success, as it was impossible  for me to study literature as advised. I seldom saw a book, and could  only spare time in tiny scraps to read them when I did.    However, the few shillings I had obtained at odd times I spent on paper,  and in secret robbed from much-needed rest a few hours weekly wherein to  write. This made me very weary and slow in the daytime, and a sore trial  to my mother. I was always forgetting things I should not have  forgotten, because my thoughts were engaged in working out my story. The  want of rest told upon me. I continually complained of weariness, and my  work was a drag to me.    My mother knew not what to make of it. At first she thought I was lazy  and bad, and punished me in various ways; but while my book occupied my  mind I was not cross, gave her no impudence, and did not flare up. Then  she began to fear I must be ill, and took me to a doctor, who said I was  much too precocious for my years, and would be better when the weather  got warmer. He gave me a tonic, which I threw out the window. I heard no  more of going out as nurse-girl: father had joined a neighbour who had  taken a road contract, and by this means the pot was kept, if not quite,  at least pretty near, boiling.    Life jogged along tamely, and, as far as I could see, gave promise of  going to the last slip-rails without a canter, until one day in July  1896 mother received a letter from her mother which made a pleasant  change in my life, though, like all sweets, that letter had its bitter  drop. It ran as follows:--      My dear daughter, Lucy,    Only a short letter this time. I am pressed for time, as four or five  strangers have just come and asked to stay for the night, and as one of  the girls is away, I have to get them beds. I am writing about Sybylla.  I am truly grieved to hear she is such a source of grief and annoyance  to you. The girl must surely be ill or she would never act as you  describe. She is young yet, and may settle down better by and by. We can  only entrust her to the good God who is ever near. Send her up to me as  soon as you can.

Or, this portion rather deserves the distinctive title adopted by  the editors, viz. \"A New General Index, exhibiting, at one view, all  that is geographically and historically interesting in the Holy  Scriptures.\" It presents such a digest as we rarely witness, and to give  the reader some idea of its laborious preparation, we select a specimen,  the matter being arranged in a tabular or columnar form, thus:    _Scriptural Name_--JEZREAL, Valley, or Plain.    _Classic Name_--Esdraelon.    _Tribe_--Issachar.    _Country_--Canaan.    _Scriptural Reference_--Judges, vi. 33.    _No. of Map_.--ix.    _Modern Name_--Merdj--Ibn Aamer.    _Distance and bearing from Jerusalem_--40 N.b.E.    _Lat. North_--32.27.    _Long. East_--35.25.    _Quarter_--Asia.    _Country_--Palestine.    _Province_--Akka.    _Remarks_--Here the spirit of the Lord descended upon Gideon, and here  the Lord gave him the sign he required by causing the fleece to be wet  or dry at his bidding.    The projector and artist is Mr. Thomas Starling, and its execution,  whether graphic or literary, is calculated to give the public a very  high opinion of his taste, talent, and application.           *       *       *       *       *      GEOGRAPHY.      Mr. Dowling, of Woodstock Boarding-School, has put Goldsmith's _Grammar  of Geography_ into question and answer for junior pupils, or, rather, he  has seized on the simplest part of the information contained in the  above work, and added a chapter on latitude and longitude. We hope the  attention of teachers will be directed to his Compendium, as it appears  to leave nothing to be desired in facilitating the progress of the  learner.           *       *       *       *       *      OUTLINES OF KNOWLEDGE.      Mr. Ince, whose _Outline of English History_ we noticed a few weeks  since, has been stimulated to the production of an _Outline of General  Knowledge_. His present Compendium is satisfactory as a little book of  Facts, and may serve as well for a _whet_ to the memory of adults as for  the tuition of children.           *       *       *       *       *      CURIOSITIES OF PHRENOLOGY.      The Third Edition of a Catechism of Phrenology, published at Glasgow,  induces us to pick out a few of the author's _facts_, and we accordingly  select the developements of the Feelings and Faculties. Thus, of  Amativeness, the organs are very large in the casts of Mitchell, Dean,  and Raphael. In Dr. Hette, very small.    Philoprogenitiveness, or love of children--the Hindoos, Negroes, and  Charibs.    Combativeness--The Charibs, King Robert Bruce, General Wurmser, David  Haggart, and generally in those who have murdered from the impulse of  the moment.    Destructiveness--In the heads of Dean, Thurtell, King Robert Bruce,  Bellingham, in cool and deliberate murderers, and in persons who delight  in cruelty, where the organ is large; and, in general, in the Hindoos,  small.    Combinativeness--In Raphael, Michael Angelo, Brunel, Haydon, and  Herschel, where it is very fully developed; the New Hollanders, have it  small. Being indispensable to the talent for works of art of every  description, it is found large in all those painters, sculptors,  mechanicians, and architects, who have distinguished themselves in their  particular departments.    Love of Approbation--In King Robert Bruce, Dr. Hette, Clara Fisher, and  the American Indians, where it is large. Such likewise is uniformly the  case in bashful individuals; this disposition arises in a great measure  from a fear of incurring disapprobation.    Cautiousness--In the Hindoos, large; in Bellingham, moderate. Robert  Bruce and Hannibal were remarkable for valour, while they at the same  time, possessed cautiousness in a high degree.    Benevolence--In Henri Quatre, where it is large. In Bellingham,  Griffiths, and the Charibs, very small. In King Robert Bruce, moderate.    Veneration--An individual may have this organ very large, without  possessing a high degree of religious feeling. Voltaire, in whom the  organ was extraordinarily large, affords a striking example of this. He  embraced every opportunity of turning religion into ridicule; but still,  in him, we find the strong manifestation of the faculty, in the high and  almost servile degree of deference which he paid to superiors in rank  and authority. In Raphael, Bruce, and the Negroes, this organ is large.  In Dr. Hette, small.    Firmness--In King Robert Bruce and the American Indians, large.    Hope--In Raphael, large; in Dr. Hette, small.    Ideality--In Milton, Shakspeare, Raphael, Wordsworth, Haydon, and Byron,  large. In Mr. Hume and Bellingham, small.    Wit--According to Dr. Spurzheim, the formation of this faculty is to  give rise to the feeling of the ludicrous, creating, when strong, an  almost irresistible disposition to view every object in that light,  while Dr. Gall defines it to be the predominant intellectual feature in  Rabelais, Cervantes, Boileau, Swift, Sterne, and Voltaire. In Sterne,  Voltaire, and Henri Quatre, this organ is large. In Sir J.E. Smith, Mr.  Hume, and the Hindoos, small.    Imitation--In Raphael, Clara Fisher, and uniformly in those artists and  players who have distinguished themselves for their imitative powers,  large.    Individuality--In the French, generally large; moderate in the English,  and in the Scotch, small.    Form--To judge of form in general. The function of this faculty is  essential to those engaged in the imitative arts: it enables the painter  to distinguish the different casts of features and countenances in  general; and upon the same principle, is of the most essential service  to the mineralogist. The organ is found large in King George III., and  in the Chinese sculls.    Weight or resistance, essential to a genius for mechanics, enabling the  individual to judge of momentum and resistance in that branch of  science. The organ is large in Brunel and Sir Isaac Newton.    Colouring--remarkably developed in the portraits of Reubens, Rembrandt,  Titian, Salvator Rosa, and Claude Lorraine, where its large size is  indicated by the arched appearance of the eyebrow in its situation; and  in the masks of the late Sir Henry Raeburn, Wilkie, and Haydon, by the  projection forwards of the eyebrow at that part.    Locality--or the power of remembering localities, in Kepler, Galileo,  Newton, Tycho, Descartes, Sir Walter Scott, and Captain Cook, is large.    Number, or a talent for calculation--in the portraits of Euler, Kepler,  Laplace, Gassendi, &c., and in George Bidder, Humboldt, and Colburn,  large.    Tune--In Gluck, where it has a pyramidal form. In Mozart, Viotti,  Turnsteg, Dussek, and Crescenti, where it is distinguished by a fullness  and roundness of the lateral parts of the forehead.    Language--in Sir J.E. Smith, Humboldt, and Voltaire, large.    Comparison--in Pitt, Roscoe, Raphael, Burke, John Bunyan, and Mr. Hume.    Casualty, or the connexion between cause and effect--remarkable in the  portraits and busts of Bacon, Kant, Locke, Voltaire, Dr. Thomas Brown;  and in the masks of Haydon, Brunel, Burke, Franklin, and Wilkie, where  it is largely developed. In Pitt, and Sir J.E. Smith, it is moderate,  and in the Charibs and New Hollanders, very deficient.           *       *       *       *       *      SONGS BY BARRY CORNWALL.      PAST TIMES.      Old Acquaintance, shall the nights      You and I once talked together,    Be forgot like common things,--    Like some dreary night that brings      Naught save foul weather?      We were young, when you and I      Talked of golden things together,--    Of love and rhyme, of books and men:    Ah! our hearts were buoyant _then_      As the wild-goose feather!      Twenty years have fled, we know,      Bringing care and changing weather;    But hath th' heart no _backward_ flights,    That we again may see those nights,      And laugh together?      Jove's eagle, soaring to the sun,      Renews the past year's mouldering feather:    Ah, why not you and I, then, soar    From age to youth,--and dream once more      Long nights together.    THE STRANGER.      A stranger came to a rich man's door.      And smiled on his mighty feast;    And away his brightest child he bore,      And laid her toward the East.      He came next spring, with a smile as gay,      (At the time the East wind blows,)    And another bright creature he led away,      With a cheek like a burning rose.      And he came once more, when the spring was blue,      And whispered the last to rest,    And bore her away,--yet nobody knew      The name of the fearful guest!      Next year, there was none but the rich man left,--      Left alone in his pride and pain,    Who called on the stranger, like one bereft,      And sought through the land,--in vain!      He came not: he never was heard nor seen      Again; (so the story saith;)    But, wherever his terrible smile had been,      Men shuddered, and talked of--Death!    THE QUADROON.      Say they that all beauty lies    In the paler maiden's hue?    Say they that all softness flies,    Save from the eyes of April blue?    Arise then, like a night in June,      Beautiful Quadroon!      Come,--all dark and bright, as skies    With the tender starlight hung!    Loose the love from out thine eyes!    Loose the angel from thy tongue!    Let them hear heaven's own sweet tune,      Beautiful Quadroon!      Tell them--Beauty (born above)    From no shade nor hue doth fly:    All she asks is mind, is love:    And both upon _thine_ aspect lie,--    Like the light upon the moon,      Beautiful Quadroon.    THE PAST.      This common field, this little brook--      What is there hidden in these two,    That I so often on them look,      Oftener than on the heavens blue?    No beauty lies upon the field;    Small music doth the river yield;    And yet I look and look again,    With something of a"]]]
