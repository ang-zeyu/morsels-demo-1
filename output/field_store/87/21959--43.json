Society can not be preserved nor can the people be  prosperous without good government. The government of our country is a  government of the people, and it becomes necessary that the class of  people upon whom the responsibility rests should assemble together and  consider and discuss the great questions of governmental policy which  from time to time are presented for their decision.    This often requires the assembling of caucuses in the night time, as  well as public assemblages in the daytime. It is a laborious task, for  which the male sex is infinitely better fitted than the female sex;  and after proper consideration and discussion of the measures that may  divide the country from time to time, the duty devolves upon those who  are responsible for the government, at times and places to be fixed by  law, to meet and by ballot to decide the great questions of government  upon which the prosperity of the country depends.    These are some of the active and sterner duties of life to which  the male sex is by nature better fitted than the female sex. If in  carrying out the policy of the State on great measures adjudged vital  such policy should lead to war, either foreign or domestic, it would  seem to follow very naturally that those who have been responsible for  the management of the State should be the parties to take the hazards  and hardships of the struggle.    Here, again, man is better fitted by nature for the discharge of the  duty--woman is unfit for it. So much for some of the duties imposed  upon the male sex, for the discharge of which the Creator has endowed  them with proper strength and faculties.    On the other hand, the Creator has assigned to woman very laborious  and responsible duties, by no means less important than those imposed  upon the male sex, though entirely different in their character. In  the family she is a queen. She alone is fitted for the discharge of  the sacred trust of wife and the endearing relation of mother.    While the man is contending with the sterner duties of life, the whole  time of the noble, affectionate, and true woman is required in the  discharge of the delicate and difficult duties assigned her in the  family circle, in her church relations, and in the society where her  lot is cast. When the husband returns home weary and worn in the  discharge of the difficult and laborious task assigned him, he finds  in the good wife solace and consolation, which is nowhere else  afforded. If he is despondent and distressed, she cheers his heart  with words of kindness; if he is sick or languishing, she soothes,  comforts, and ministers to him as no one but an affectionate wife  can do. If his burdens are onerous, she divides their weight by the  exercise of her love and her sympathy.    But a still more important duty devolves upon the mother. After  having brought into existence the offspring of the nuptial union, the  children are dependent upon the mother as they are not upon any other  human being. The trust is a most sacred, most responsible, and most  important one. To watch over them in their infancy, and as the mind  begins to expand to train, direct, and educate it in the paths of  virtue and usefulness is the high trust assigned to the mother. She  trains the twig as the tree should be inclined.    She molds the character. She educates the heart as well as the  intellect, and she prepares the future man, now the boy, for honor or  dishonor. Upon the manner in which she discharges her duty depends the  fact whether he shall in future be a useful citizen or a burden to  society. She inculcates lessons of patriotism, manliness, religion,  and virtue, fitting the man by reason of his training to be an  ornament to society, or dooming him by her neglect to a life of  dishonor and shame. Society acts unwisely when it imposes upon her  the duties that by common consent have always been assigned to the  stronger and sterner sex, and the discharge of which causes her to  neglect those sacred and all important duties to her children and to  the society of which they are members.    In the church, by her piety, her charity, and her Christian purity,  she not only aids society by a proper training of her own children,  but the children of others, whom she encourages to come to the sacred  altar, are taught to walk in the paths of rectitude, honor, and  religion. In the Sunday-school room the good woman is a princess, and  she exerts an influence which purifies and ennobles society, training  the young in the truths of religion, making the Sunday-school the  nursery of the church, and elevating society to the higher planes of  pure religion, virtue, and patriotism. In the sick room and among the  humble, the poor, and the suffering, the good woman, like an angel  of light, cheers the hearts and revives the hopes of the poor, the  suffering, and the despondent.    It would be a vain attempt to undertake to enumerate the refining,  endearing, and ennobling influences exercised by the true woman in her  relations to the family and to society when she occupies the sphere  assigned to her by the laws of nature and the Divine inspiration,  which are our surest guide for the present and the future life. But  how can woman be expected to meet these heavy responsibilities, and to  discharge these delicate and most important duties of wife, Christian,  teacher, minister of mercy, friend of the suffering, and consoler of  the despondent and needy, if we impose upon her the grosser, rougher,  and harsher duties which nature has assigned to the male sex?    If the wife and the mother is required to leave the sacred precincts  of home, and to attempt to do military duty when the state is in  peril; or if she is to be required to leave her home from day to day  in attendance upon the court as a juror, and to be shut up in the jury  room from night to night with men who are strangers while a question  of life or property is being discussed; if she is to attend political  meetings, take part in political discussions, and mingle with the male  sex at political gatherings; if she is to become an active politician;  if she is to attend political caucuses at late hours of the night;  if she is to take part in all the unsavory work that may be deemed  necessary for the triumph of her party; and if on election day she is  to leave her home and go upon the streets electioneering for votes for  the candidates who receive her support, and mingling among the crowds  of men who gather round the polls, she is to press her way through  them to the precinct and deposit her ballot; if she is to take part  in the corporate struggles of the city or town in which she resides,  attend to the duties of his honor, the mayor, the councilman, or of  policeman, to say nothing of the many other like obligations which are  disagreeable even to the male sex, how is she, with all these heavy  duties of citizen, politician, and officeholder resting upon her  shoulders, to attend to the more sacred, delicate, and refining trust  to which we have already referred, and for which she is peculiarly  fitted by nature? If she is to discharge the duties last mentioned,  how is she, in connection with them, to discharge the more refining,  elevating, and ennobling duties of wife, mother, Christian, and  friend, which are found in the sphere where nature has placed her?  Who is to care for and train the children while she is absent in the  discharge of these masculine duties?    If it were proper to reverse the order of nature and assign woman  to the sterner duties devolved upon the male sex, and to attempt to  assign man to the more refining, delicate, and ennobling duties of the  woman, man would be found entirely incompetent to the discharge of  the obligations which nature has devolved upon the gentler sex, and  society must be greatly injured by the attempted change. But if we are  told that the object of this movement is not to reverse this order of  nature, but only to devolve upon the gentler sex a portion of the more  rigorous duties imposed by nature upon the stronger sex, we reply that  society must be injured, as the woman would not be able to discharge  those duties so well, by reason of her want of physical strength, as  the male, upon whom they are devolved, and to the extent that the  duties are to be divided, the male would be infinitely less competent  to discharge the delicate and sacred trusts which nature has assigned  to the female.    But it has been said that the present law is unjust to woman; that she  is often required to pay tax on the property she holds without being  permitted to take part in framing or administering the laws by  which her property is governed, and that she is taxed without  representation. That is a great mistake.    It may be very doubtful whether the male or female sex in the present  state of things has more influence in the administration of the  affairs of the Government and the enactment of the laws by which we  are governed.    While the woman does not discharge military duty, nor does she attend  courts and serve on juries, nor does she labor on the public streets,  bridges, or highways, nor does she engage actively and publicly in  the discussion of political affairs, nor does she enter the crowded  precincts of the ballot-box to deposit her suffrage, still the  intelligent, cultivated, noble woman is a power behind the throne. All  her influence is in favor of morality, justice, and fair dealing, all  her efforts and her counsel are in favor of good government, wise and  wholesome regulations, and a faithful administration of the laws. Such  a woman, by her gentleness, kindness, and Christian bearing, impresses  her views and her counsels upon her father, her husband, her brothers,  her sons, and her other male friends who imperceptibly yield to her  influence many times without even being conscious of it. She rules not  with a rod of iron,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],[0,"Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#7)"],[1,"n. I'm dead sure to hear from  him again.\"    \"He's a cad,\" growled Dismal Jones.    \"I think you fellows judge him rather harshly,\" said Frank. \"He is a  Southerner, and he looks at many things differently than we do. From his  standpoint he seems to be right.\"    \"Well, he'll have to get those notions out of his head if he wants to  stay in college,\" airily declared Dan Dorman. \"Now, I came here with  the idea of falling into the ways in vogue. Everything goes with me.  That's the way to get along.\"    \"I am not so sure of that,\" Merriwell returned. \"A man must have some  individuality. If you do everything everybody wants you to, it won't be  long before they'll not want you to do anything.\"    \"Oh, well, what's the use to be always hanging off and getting yourself  disliked?\"    \"One extreme is as bad as the other. Now, I make allowances for Diamond,  and I am not inclined to believe him such a bad fellow.\"    Harry Rattleton flung a book across the room.    \"Oh, you give me the flubdubs!\" he exploded. \"Why, that fellow hates  you, and he means to do you some time. Still you are soft enough to say  he's not such a bad fellow! It's disgusting!\"    \"Time will tell,\" smiled Frank. \"All of you fellows must admit that he  has sand.\"    \"Oh, a kind of bulldog stick-to-it-iveness,\" murmured Stover.    \"I'll tell you one thing,\" said Bandy Robinson; \"now that Diamond has  not blowed, he's going to be backed by some of the leading sophs.\"    \"Eh? What makes you think so?\"    \"Oh, I've got it straight. Browning has been to see him.\"    \"No! Why, Browning is king of the sophs!\"    \"And he is jealous of Merriwell.\"    \"Jealous?\"    \"Sure. He says Merry is altogether too 'soon' for a fresh, and he must  be taken down. I tell you I've got it straight. He'll put up some kind  of a game to enable Diamond to get square.\"    \"Well, this is rather interesting,\" confessed Frank, showing that he was  aroused. \"I'll have to look out for Mr. Browning.\"    \"He's a hard fellow to go against,\" solemnly said Dismal Jones. \"He's a  Le Boule man, and they say he may take his choice of the other big  societies next year.\"    \"Oh, what's that amount to?\"    \"It amounts to something here; but then he's a fighter, and he is  authority on fighters and fighting.\"    \"He is too fat to fight.\"    \"They say he can train down in a week. He was the greatest freshman  half-back ever known at Yale.\"    \"Half-back--Browning a half-back! Oh, say, that fellow couldn't play  football!\"    \"Not a great deal now, perhaps, but he could last year. He'd be on the  regular team now, but his father swore to take him out of college if he  didn't stop it. You see, Browning is not entirely to blame for his  laziness. He inherits it from his father, and the old man will not  allow him to lead in athletics, so whatever he does must be done  secretly.\"    Frank was interested. He wondered how a fellow like Bruce Browning could  come to be know as \"king of the sophomores,\" unless such a title was  applied to him in derision. Now he began to understand that Browning was  something more than the lazy mischief planner that he had seemed.    Frank's interest in Browning grew.    \"And you say he is backing Diamond?\"    \"That's the way it looks from the road.\"    \"Well, Mr. Bruce Browning may need some attention. It is he who puts the  sophs up to their jobs on us. We ought to put up a big one on him.\"    \"That's right! that's right!\"    \"Merry,\" said Jones, \"set the complicated machinery of your fertile  brain to work and see what it will bring forth.\"    \"That's right! that's right!\"    \"I'll have to take time to think it over.\"    \"We have a few soph scalps,\" grinned Rattleton, pointing to a number of  caps with which the walls were decorated, all of which had been snatched  from the heads of sophomores. \"Have the rest of you fellows done as  well?\"    \"I have lost two,\" confessed Dan Dorman. \"They seem to single me out as  easy fruit.\"    \"And haven't you made an attempt to get one in return?\" asked Bandy  Robinson.    \"I haven't had a good chance.\"    \"If you wait for a good chance you'll never get a scalp. You must snatch  'em whenever you can.\"    \"By Jove!\" laughed Frank, \"this talk about scalps has given me an idea.\"    \"Let's have it!\" exclaimed several of the boys in unison.    \"Not now,\" he said. \"Wait till I have perfected it.\"    Roll Ditson strolled in, smoking a cigarette, and said:    \"Hello, Merry! Hello, fellows! What's up? Council of war?\"    \"Just that,\" said Dan Dorman. \"Merry is perfecting a scheme to put a  horse on Browning.\"    \"Eh? Browning? Great Scott! Is that so? He's a bad man to monkey with.  Better let him alone, Merry.\"    Ditson had a patronizing way that was offensive to Frank, who had given  him numberless digs; but he was too thick to tumble or he deliberately  refused to take Merriwell's words as they were intended.    \"You'll have to kick him before he knows he's not wanted,\" Rattleton had  said.    \"Thank you for your advice,\" said Frank, with mild sarcasm--\"thank you  exceedingly! Perhaps you are right.\"    \"Oh, I know I am. I don't want to get the king after me, and I don't  believe you care to have him on your trail. He is the most influential  soph in college. Why, his name is on a table down at Morey's.\"    Ditson looked around as if his last statement had settled the question  of Browning's vast superiority over all sophomores.    Morey's was the favorite resort of the students, and no freshman could  enter there. It was an old frame house, with low-posted rooms, and there  one could drink everything except beer. No beer could be had at Morey's.    Morey's was headquarters for the Society of the Cup. This cup had six  handles and was kept in a locked closet. On the cup was engraved in  large letters the word \"Velvet,\" which is a well-known Yale drink,  composed of champagne and Dublin stout, a drink that is mild and soft,  but has a terrific \"kick.\"    Besides the word \"Velvet,\" a number of students' names were engraved on  the cup, and no one whose name was not there could ask the proprietor to  show the cup.    The marked tables were two round tables on which names of the  frequenters of the place had been cut in the hard wood. One table had  been filled with six hundred and seventy-five names and was suspended  against the wall, where it would revolve, and the other tables were fast  filling up.    Merriwell laughed at Ditson's statement.    \"I don't see as it is such a wonderful thing for a soph to get his name  on one of those tables,\" he said. \"If you had said that Browning's name  was on the cup, it would have seemed a matter of some consequence.\"    \"It may be, for all I know. Sophs are not in the habit of telling us  everything. Steer clear of Browning, Merry, old man.\"    \"Thanks again! You have made me so nervous that I think I will take your  advice.\"    \"That's right, my boy--that's right,\" nodded Ditson, swelling with  importance. \"Always listen to your uncle, my lad, and you will never go  wrong.\"    The other lads seemed rather disappointed, but Merriwell said nothing  more of his scheme to get a \"horse\" on Browning--that is, he said  nothing more that night.          CHAPTER VII.    A SURPRISE.      It was singular how quickly Browning learned that Merriwell had  contemplated working a job on him. It seemed an absolute certainty that  some one of the party in Merriwell's room had gone forth and \"blowed.\"  Who had done so was a question.    As was the most natural thing, considering his dislike for the fellow,  Frank felt that Roll Ditson was the telltale. Of this he had no proof,  however, and he was too just to openly condemn a man without proof.    It was certain that Browning had learned all about it, for he sent word  to Merriwell to go slow. At the same time, in all public places he  avowed the utmost contempt and disregard for the freshman who had done  up Diamond.    \"The boy is altogether too new,\" Browning sneered. \"What he needs is  polishing off, and he is bound to get it.\"    Now, Frank had won admiration from the sophomores, and there were one or  two who did not like Browning and would have given not a little to have  seen him beaten at anything.    This being the case, it is not surprising that Merriwell received an  anonymous note warning him to keep in his room on a certain evening and  look out for squalls.    Frank knew Browning would not come alone, and he determined to be  prepared. With this object in view, he gathered ten stout freshmen and  had them come to his room early on the evening mentioned.    The curtains were drawn closely, and the arrivals were astonished to see  a lot of Indian toggery piled up on tables and chairs, imitation  buckskin suits, feathered headdresses, bows, arrows, tomahawks, and so  forth. On Merriwell's table was a full supply of Indian red grease  paint.    \"Oh, say,\" gasped Ned Stover, his eyes bulging, \"what's this--a powwow  outfit?\"    \"This is the result of the idea you fellows gave me when you spoke of  capturing scalps the other evening,\" laughed Frank. \"Select your suits,  gentlemen, and proceed to make up.\"    \"Make up? What for?\"    \"Just you make up, and I will tell you what for afterward.\"    Merriwell's influence was sufficient to induce them to obey, and he  aided them in the work.    \"Blate grazes--I mean great blazes!\" chuckled Rattleton, as he rubbed  the war paint on his face. \"Won't we make a bloodthirsty gang of roble  ned men--er, noble red men!\"    The boys aided each other, and Frank assisted them all.    \"Aren't you going to make up, Merry?\" asked Bandy Robinson.    \"Not now. I am to be the decoy.\"    \"The decoy? What's in the wind, anyway?\"    \"Well, I have it pretty straight that some sophs, led by Browning, are  coming to take me out for an airing to-night.\"    \"Eh? Take you out?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And he means to take them in,\" laughed Rattleton, arranging a war  bonnet on his head.    \"That's just it,\" nodded Frank. \"If they come"]]]
