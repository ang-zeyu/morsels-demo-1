Then, instead of the natty primness of your bachelor's apartment, you  have your eyes feasted by that elegant confusion of the little  sanctuary--the charm of which cannot, unseen, be apprehended, and is  only known to those who are privileged to enter, by the passport of  Hymen. A bit of bobbin here--a thread-paper there--here a hat  feather--there a scrap of silk.--Besides,\" [drawing his chair closer  to mine and looking very tender] \"when you love her, you know--.\" He  paused and sighed, and I groaned strenuously.--    \"And is this all you have to say in defence of an elopement with a  girl of sixteen.\" [\"A beautiful girl,\" he passionately interrupted]  \"well! a beautiful girl--so young, that it is perfectly impossible for  you to form any judgment on her inclinations or her temper--at a time  when her character is undecided--unformed--when that which is mere  caprice, frequently assumes the hue of passion, and wears all its  fervour and intensity. Or if it should continue unabated--as I must  confess [observing him turn himself with an air before a pier glass,]  I see no reason why it should not--you will find the unsophistication  of the young lady as quickly tending to domestic disquiet, as might  have been her inconstancy--She will be unreasonable in her exactions  on your confidence, and you will be compelled to take refuge in fits  of sullenness--perhaps rudeness;--and then what becomes of that  blissful state, where like you, every body expects, and so very--very  few _find_ happiness?--to secure which the most perfect union of taste  and feeling--the utmost kindliness of manner, and a politeness as  habitual as motion itself, are absolute requisites?--Have you no  further arguments to offer in favour of this measure of yours?--\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said he, very dryly, \"I have one more.\"    \"What may that be?\"    \"That I WILL marry her.\"    \"Oh!...\" said I.    And without exchanging another word, I put on my great coat, and we  sallied forth together to the rendezvous of the lovers. The fair  fugitive was true to her appointment, and at the first sound of the  expected footfall, glided from her concealment into the happy  scoundrel's arms. The action which followed I could not see (though it  was a bright moonlight,) for a breeze lifted the large veil which hung  over the lady's shoulder, in such a manner as to envelope the  countenances of both. What the action _ought_ to have been, perhaps  you, madam, or you, mademoiselle, may inform me?--I only know that  when the modest zephyr passed, and the veil fell back again, the fair  cheek that it revealed glowed with      \"A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't,     Might well have warm'd old Saturn.\"    Harry gave me his hand (heartily) as he stood on the carriage step,  and the bride wafted me a farewell with the prettiest action of her  fan from the window, and murmured,--\"Give me a good wish for the  tobacconist.\"    \"Yes,\" said I; \"may you never have occasion to say of the love that  now leads you to him, that        \"'Its beacon light is quench'd in _smoke_.'\"    [For although naturally grave, and silently given, I often catch  myself endeavouring to sport a bad pun, when I have got the ear of a  fair damsel] The only effect which the witticism produced in the  present instance, however, was an enormous groan, in which the fellows  on the dickey participated. Even the postilion who stood near, set up  a crowing laugh--and the very horses by their snorting and neighing,  seemed to be sensible of the utter and deplorable failure.    And away they went--and they were hotly pursued, and overtaken, _just_  in time to be too late--which left no other course but that of  reconciliation;--and where there is no choice to be made, every body  knows there is but one part to be taken.    That occurrence is now three years since, and it was only the other  day that I again met the pair of turtles. Dropping in rather late at a  card-party, I beheld them sitting vis-a-vis at one of the tables,  playing together against an old lady and gentleman, before whom Mrs.  L---- thought, perhaps, it was not necessary to appear _very_  fashionable towards dear Harry. With the requisite _ceremonious  unceremoniousness_ so popular at present, I took a chair behind him,  and annoyed him every moment by remarks upon his wife; of course all  highly nattering to both.    \"My love, you have played that card wrong--very wrong.\"    \"Did I, my dear?\" replied Mrs. L. smiling languidly, and looking in  his face more as if she was admiring the elegant turn of his forehead,  and the spirited expression of his dark eye, than as if she minded  what he was saying--\"'tis indeed--very.\"    \"'Tis what?\"    \"Oh! were you not speaking of something? I beg pardon, love--I thought  you spoke.\"    \"And so I did, my dear. I told you that card was played most  abominably.\"    \"I dare say, my love;--[still gazing in his eyes and smiling]--I know  I'm very stupid,\"--[playing a card.]    \"Well, you have taken a curious way to mend matters--that last play  was a thousand degrees worse than the other.\"    \"I dare say, my love,--[looking in his face, and continuing to drawl  and simper in the manner which we might imagine of Shakspeare's little  shepherdess--     \"'Sweet youth chide on--I had rather hear thee chide     Than others woo--'\"]    \"But tell me, love, when I play wrong,\" [playing again without taking  her eyes from his, even to look at her card.]    \"I had much better leave you to yourself,\" said L.    \"'_You will be compelled to take refuge in fits of sullenness_,'\"  muttered I, quoting from my former prophecy.    \"My dear,\"--[pronounced just in the same way as he might have said,  'you fool,']--pray open your eyes.\"    \"_Perhaps in rudeness_,\" I continued.    \"There again!\" cried poor L----, who seemed in danger of being ruined  by the admiration of his wife. \"It is not possible for a card to be  played worse than that. Your head, my dear, must be as confused as  your boudoir.\"    \"_A bit of bobbin here--a hat feather there_,\" I continued, growing  malicious.    \"Sir,\" cried L----, starting round in a passion. Fixing his eyes for a  moment on my wooden phiz, however, he burst into a fit of laughter,  and then as suddenly assuming a most doleful change of countenance, he  squeezed my hand and said to me apart, in a tragic tone, \"Ah, my dear  friend, you were right--you were right.\"     \"He that would lead a happy married life,    First learn to rule, and then to have, a wife,\"  say Beaumont and Fletcher--and a pleasant  aphorism it is too--and a wise and  useful--but with a slight alteration, a  periphrasis comprehending advice not less  to the purpose may be presented--     \"He that would lead a happy wedded life,    Beware of marrying a _too_ youthful wife.\"           *       *       *       *       *        USEFUL DOMESTIC HINTS.      FININGS FOR WINES.      If wine does not become clear soon enough, for each forty gallons  dissolve an ounce of isinglass in a quart of water. Strain and mix  this with part of the liquor, beat it up to a froth, and pour it into  the rest; stir the whole well, and bung it up, except there should be  an appearance of fermentation; if so, leave the bung out till it has  ceased. Instead of isinglass, some use hartshorn shavings, in rather  larger quantities; red wines are fined with eggs, twelve to the pipe,  beaten up to a froth, mixed with the wine, _and well stirred in_.    Gypsum or alabaster is used to clear cloudy white wines; as also fresh  slaked lime; and the size of a walnut of sugar of lead, with a table  spoonful of sal enixum, is put to forty gallons of muddy wine, to  clear it; and hence, as the sugar of lead is decomposed, and changed  into an insoluble sulphat of lead, which falls to the bottom, the  practice is not so dangerous as has been represented.      MANNER OF USING FININGS.      Put the finings, when ready, into a pail, with a little of what you  are going to fine; whisk them together till they are perfectly mixed,  and then nearly fill up the pail with the liquor, whisking it well  about again, after which, if the cask be full, take out four or five  gallons to make room; take a staff and stir it well; next whisk the  finings up, and put them in, stirring well together for five minutes;  then drive in the bung, leaving the vent-peg loose for three or four  days, after which drive it in tight.      OF FLAVOURING AND COLOURING WINES.      The quality of roughness natural to those red wines in which the skins  and a portion of the stems have been subjected to the process of  fermentation, is readily communicated by astringent substances, and by  none more easily or purely than by catechu and kino, substances free  from injurious flavour; the sloe is also used; similar roughness,  accompanied with flavour, is given by the chips of oak and beech; and  if logwood and walnut peels are used, the astringency will also be  united to a portion of colour and flavour. All these substances may be  rendered highly useful in giving positive qualities to insipid wines.

[Illustration: THE NEW ANGLESEA BRIDGE, CORK.]    The new swing bridge occupies the site of an older structure which had  been found inadequate to the requirements of the heavy and increasing  traffic, and the foundations of the old piers having fallen into an  insecure condition, the construction of a new opening bridge was taken  in hand jointly by the Corporation and Harbor Commissioners of Cork.    The new bridge, which has recently been completed, is of a somewhat  novel design, and the arrangement of the swing-span in particular  presents some original and interesting features, which appear to have  been dictated by a careful consideration of the existing local  conditions and requirements.    On each side of the river, both above and below the bridge, the quays  are ordinarily lined with vessels berthed alongside each of the quays,  and as the river is rather narrow at this point, the line of fairway for  vessels passing through the bridge is confined nearly to the center of  the river. This consideration, together with some others connected with  the proposed future deepening of the fairway, rendered it very desirable  to locate the opening span nearly in the center of the river, as shown  in the general plan of the situation, which we publish herewith. At the  same time it was necessary to avoid any encroachment upon the width of  the existing quays, which form important lines of communication for  vehicular and passenger traffic along each side of the river, and to and  from the railway stations. Again, it was necessary to preserve the full  existing width of waterway in the river itself, which is sometimes  subjected to heavy floods.    These considerations evidently precluded the construction of a central  pier and double-armed swing bridge, and on the other hand they also  precluded the construction of any solid masonry substructure for the  turntable, either upon the quay or projected into the river. To meet  these several conditions the bridge has been designed in the form of a  three-span bridge, that is to say, it is only supported by the two  abutments and two intermediate piers, each consisting of a pair of  cast-iron cylinders or columns, as shown by the dotted circles upon the  general plan.    The central opening is that which serves for the passage of vessels. The  swing bridge extends over two openings, or from the north abutment to  the southern pier, its center of revolution being situated over the  center of the northern span, and revolves upon a turntable, which is  carried upon a lower platform or frame of girders extending across the  northern span of the bridge. The southern opening is spanned by an  ordinary pair of lattice girders in line with the girders and  superstructure of the swing bridge.    We propose at an early date to publish further details of this bridge,  and the hydraulic machinery by which it is worked.    We present a perspective view of the bridge as seen from the entrance to  the exhibition building, which is situated in close proximity to the  southern end of the bridge.--_Engineering_.           *       *       *       *       *          PORTABLE RAILWAYS.    [Footnote: Paper read before the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.]    By M. DECAUVILLE, Aine, of Petit-Bourg (Seine and Oise), France.      Narrow gauge railways have been known for a very long time in Great  Britain. The most familiar lines of this description are in Wales, and  it is enough to instance the Festiniog Railway (2 feet gauge), which has  been used for the carriage of passengers and goods for nearly half a  century. The prosperous condition of this railway, which has been so  successfully improved by Mr. James Spooner and his son, Mr. Charles  Spooner, affords sufficient proof that narrow gauge railways are not  only of great utility, but may be also very remunerative.    In Wales the first narrow gauge railway dates from 1832. It was  constructed merely for the carriage of slates from Festiniog to  Port-Madoc, and some years later another was built from the slate  quarries at Penrhyn to the port of Bangor. As the tract of country  traversed by the railways became richer by degrees, the idea was  conceived of substituting locomotives for horses, and of adapting the  line to the carriage of goods of all sorts, and finally of passengers  also.    But these railways, although very economical, are at the same time very  complicated in construction. Their arrangements are based upon the same  principles as railways of the ordinary gauge, and are not by any means  capable of being adapted to agriculture, to public works, or to any  other purpose where the tracks are constantly liable to removal. These  permanent narrow gauge lines, the laying of which demands the service of  engineers, and the maintenance of which entails considerable expense,  suggested to M. Decauville, Aine, farmer and distiller at Petit-Bourg,  near Paris, the idea of forming a system of railways composed entirely  of metal, and capable of being readily laid. Cultivating one of the  largest farms in the neighborhood of Paris, he contemplated at first  nothing further than a farm railroad; and he contrived an extremely  portable plant, adapted for clearing the land of beetroot, for spreading  manure, and for the other needs of his farm.    From the beginning in his first railroads, the use of timber materials  was rigidly rejected by him; and all parts, whether the straight or  curved rails, crossings, turntables, etc., were formed of a single  piece, and did not require any special workman to lay them down. By  degrees he developed his system, and erected special workshops for the  construction of his portable plant; making use of his farm, and some  quarries of which he is possessed in the neighborhood, as experimental  areas. At the present time this system of portable railways serves all  the purposes of agriculture, of commerce, of manufactures, and even  those of war.    Within so limited a space it would be impossible to give a detailed  description of the rails and fastenings used in all these different  modes of application. The object of this paper is rather to direct the  attention of mechanical engineers to the various uses to which narrow  gauge portable railways may be put, to the important saving of labor  which is effected by their adoption, and to the ease with which they are  worked.    The success of the Decauville railway has been so rapid and so great  that many inventors have entered the same field, but they have almost  all formed the idea of constructing the portable track with detachable  sleepers. There are thus, at present, two systems of portable tracks:  those in which the sleepers are capable of being detached, and those in  which they are not so capable.    The portable track of the Decauville system is not capable of so coming  apart. The steel rails and sleepers are riveted together, and form only  one piece. The chief advantage of these railways is their great  firmness; besides this, since the line has only to be laid on the  surface just as it stands, there are not those costs of maintenance  which become unavoidable with lines of which the sleepers are fixed by  means of bolts, clamps, or other adjuncts, only too liable to be lost.  Moreover, tracks which are not capable of separation are lighter and  therefore more portable than those in which the sleepers are detachable.    With regard to sleepers, a distinction must be drawn between those which  project beyond the rails and those which do not so project. M.  Decauville has adopted the latter system, because it offers sufficient  strength, while the lines are lighter and less cumbersome. Where at  first he used flat iron sleepers, he now fits his lines with dished  steel sleepers, in accordance with Figs. 1 and 2.    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Fig. 2.]    This sleeper presents very great stiffness, at the same time preserving  its lightness; and the feature which specially distinguishes this  railway from others of the same class is not only its extreme strength,  but above all its solidity, which results from its bearing equally upon  the ground by means of the rail base and of the sleepers.    In special cases, M. Decauville provides also railroads with projecting  sleepers, whether of flat steel beaten out and rounded, or of channel  iron; but the sleeper and the rail are always inseparable, so as not to  lessen the strength, and also to facilitate the laying of the line. If  the ground is too soft, the railway is supported by bowl sleepers of  dished steel, Figs. 3 and 4, especially at the curves; but the necessity  for using these is but seldom experienced. The sleepers are riveted  cold. The rivets are of soft steel, and the pressure with which this  riveting is effected is so intense that the sleepers cannot be separated  from the rails, even after cutting off both heads of the rivets, unless  by heavy blows of the hammer, the rivets being driven so thoroughly into  the holes made in the rails and sleepers that they fill them up  completely.    The jointing of the rails is excessively simple. The rail to the right  hand is furnished with two fish-plates; that to the left with a small  steel plate riveted underneath the rail and projecting 11/4 in. beyond it.  It is only necessary to lay the lengths end to end with one another,  making the rail which is furnished with the small plate lie between the  two fish-plates, and the junction can at once be effected by fish-bolts.  A single fish-bolt, passing through the holes in the fish-plates, and  through an oval hole in the rail end, is sufficient for the purpose.    With this description of railway it does not matter whether the curves  are to the right or to the left. The pair of rails are curved to a  suitable"]]]
