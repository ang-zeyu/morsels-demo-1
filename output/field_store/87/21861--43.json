[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/85"],[0,"The Beasts of Tarzan (#6)"],[1," it was some great beast of prey stalking Bara for  the selfsame purpose as that which prompted him to await the fleet  animal.  Numa, perhaps, or Sheeta, the panther.    In any event, Tarzan could see his repast slipping from his grasp  unless Bara moved more rapidly toward the ford than at present.    Even as these thoughts passed through his mind some noise of the  stalker in his rear must have come to the buck, for with a sudden start  he paused for an instant, trembling, in his tracks, and then with a  swift bound dashed straight for the river and Tarzan.  It was his  intention to flee through the shallow ford and escape upon the opposite  side of the river.    Not a hundred yards behind him came Numa.    Tarzan could see him quite plainly now.  Below the ape-man Bara was  about to pass.  Could he do it?  But even as he asked himself the  question the hungry man launched himself from his perch full upon the  back of the startled buck.    In another instant Numa would be upon them both, so if the ape-man were  to dine that night, or ever again, he must act quickly.    Scarcely had he touched the sleek hide of the deer with a momentum that  sent the animal to its knees than he had grasped a horn in either hand,  and with a single quick wrench twisted the animal's neck completely  round, until he felt the vertebrae snap beneath his grip.    The lion was roaring in rage close behind him as he swung the deer  across his shoulder, and, grasping a foreleg between his strong teeth,  leaped for the nearest of the lower branches that swung above his head.    With both hands he grasped the limb, and, at the instant that Numa  sprang, drew himself and his prey out of reach of the animal's cruel  talons.    There was a thud below him as the baffled cat fell back to earth, and  then Tarzan of the Apes, drawing his dinner farther up to the safety of  a higher limb, looked down with grinning face into the gleaming yellow  eyes of the other wild beast that glared up at him from beneath, and  with taunting insults flaunted the tender carcass of his kill in the  face of him whom he had cheated of it.    With his crude stone knife he cut a juicy steak from the hindquarters,  and while the great lion paced, growling, back and forth below him,  Lord Greystoke filled his savage belly, nor ever in the choicest of his  exclusive London clubs had a meal tasted more palatable.    The warm blood of his kill smeared his hands and face and filled his  nostrils with the scent that the savage carnivora love best.    And when he had finished he left the balance of the carcass in a high  fork of the tree where he had dined, and with Numa trailing below him,  still keen for revenge, he made his way back to his tree-top shelter,  where he slept until the sun was high the following morning.          Chapter 4    Sheeta      The next few days were occupied by Tarzan in completing his weapons and  exploring the jungle.  He strung his bow with tendons from the buck  upon which he had dined his first evening upon the new shore, and  though he would have preferred the gut of Sheeta for the purpose, he  was content to wait until opportunity permitted him to kill one of the  great cats.    He also braided a long grass rope--such a rope as he had used so many  years before to tantalize the ill-natured Tublat, and which later had  developed into a wondrous effective weapon in the practised hands of  the little ape-boy.    A sheath and handle for his hunting-knife he fashioned, and a quiver  for arrows, and from the hide of Bara a belt and loin-cloth.  Then he  set out to learn something of the strange land in which he found  himself.  That it was not his old familiar west coast of the African  continent he knew from the fact that it faced east--the rising sun came  up out of the sea before the threshold of the jungle.    But that it was not the east coast of Africa he was equally positive,  for he felt satisfied that the Kincaid had not passed through the  Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the Red Sea, nor had she had time to  round the Cape of Good Hope.  So he was quite at a loss to know where  he might be.    Sometimes he wondered if the ship had crossed the broad Atlantic to  deposit him upon some wild South American shore; but the presence of  Numa, the lion, decided him that such could not be the case.    As Tarzan made his lonely way through the jungle paralleling the shore,  he felt strong upon him a desire for companionship, so that gradually  he commenced to regret that he had not cast his lot with the apes.  He  had seen nothing of them since that first day, when the influences of  civilization were still paramount within him.    Now he was more nearly returned to the Tarzan of old, and though he  appreciated the fact that there could be little in common between  himself and the great anthropoids, still they were better than no  company at all.    Moving leisurely, sometimes upon the ground and again among the lower  branches of the trees, gathering an occasional fruit or turning over a  fallen log in search of the larger bugs, which he still found as  palatable as of old, Tarzan had covered a mile or more when his  attention was attracted by the scent of Sheeta up-wind ahead of him.    Now Sheeta, the panther, was one whom Tarzan was exceptionally glad  to fall in with, for he had it in mind not only to utilize the great  cat's strong gut for his bow, but also to fashion a new quiver and  loin-cloth from pieces of his hide.   So, whereas the ape-man had gone  carelessly before, he now became the personification of noiseless  stealth.    Swiftly and silently he glided through the forest in the wake of the  savage cat, nor was the pursuer, for all his noble birth, one whit less  savage than the wild, fierce thing he stalked.    As he came closer to Sheeta he became aware that the panther on his  part was stalking game of his own, and even as he realized this fact  there came to his nostrils, wafted from his right by a vagrant breeze,  the strong odour of a company of great apes.    The panther had taken to a large tree as Tarzan came within sight of  him, and beyond and below him Tarzan saw the tribe of Akut lolling in a  little, natural clearing.  Some of them were dozing against the boles  of trees, while others roamed about turning over bits of bark from  beneath which they transferred the luscious grubs and beetles to their  mouths.    Akut was the closest to Sheeta.    The great cat lay crouched upon a thick limb, hidden from the ape's  view by dense foliage, waiting patiently until the anthropoid should  come within range of his spring.    Tarzan cautiously gained a position in the same tree with the panther  and a little above him.  In his left hand he grasped his slim stone  blade.  He would have preferred to use his noose, but the foliage  surrounding the huge cat precluded the possibility of an accurate throw  with the rope.    Akut had now wandered quite close beneath the tree wherein lay the  waiting death.  Sheeta slowly edged his hind paws along the branch  still further beneath him, and then with a hideous shriek he launched  himself toward the great ape.   The barest fraction of a second before  his spring another beast of prey above him leaped, its weird and savage  cry mingling with his.    As the startled Akut looked up he saw the panther almost above him, and  already upon the panther's back the white ape that had bested him that  day near the great water.    The teeth of the ape-man were buried in the back of Sheeta's neck and  his right arm was round the fierce throat, while the left hand,  grasping a slender piece of stone, rose and fell in mighty blows upon  the panther's side behind the left shoulder.    Akut had just time to leap to one side to avoid being pinioned beneath  these battling monsters of the jungle.    With a crash they came to earth at his feet.  Sheeta was screaming,  snarling, and roaring horribly; but the white ape clung tenaciously and  in silence to the thrashing body of his quarry.    Steadily and remorselessly the stone knife was driven home through the  glossy hide--time and again it drank deep, until with a final agonized  lunge and shriek the great feline rolled over upon its side and, save  for the spasmodic jerking of its muscles, lay quiet and still in death.    Then the ape-man raised his head, as he stood over the carcass of his  kill, and once again through the jungle rang his wild and savage  victory challenge.    Akut and the apes of Akut stood looking in startled wonder at the dead  body of Sheeta and the lithe, straight figure of the man who had slain  him.    Tarzan was the first to speak.    He had saved Akut's life for a purpose, and, knowing the limitations of  the ape intellect, he also knew that he must make this purpose plain to  the anthropoid if it were to serve him in the way he hoped.    \"I am Tarzan of the Apes,\" he said, \"Mighty hunter.  Mighty fighter.  By the great water I spared Akut's life when I might have taken it and  become king of the tribe of Akut.  Now I have saved Akut from death  beneath the rending fangs of Sheeta.    \"When Akut or the tribe of Akut is in danger, let them call to Tarzan  thus\"--and the ape-man raised the hideous cry with which the tribe of  Kerchak had been wont to summon its absent members in times of peril.    \"And,\" he continued, \"when they hear Tarzan call to them, let them  remember what he has done for Akut and come to him with great speed.  Shall it be as Tarzan says?\"    \"Huh!\" assented Akut, and from the members of his tribe there rose a  unanimous \"Huh.\"    Then, presently, they went to feeding again as though nothing had  happened, and with them fed John Clayton, Lord Greystoke.    He noticed, however, that Akut kept always close to him, and was often  looking at him with a strange wonder in his little bloodshot eyes, and  once he did a thing that Tarzan during all his long years among the  apes had never before seen an ape"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8502"],[0,"Common Diseases of Farm Animals (#6)"],[1,"by the oesophageal grove (Fig. 10), a demi-canal that  connects this with the oesophageal opening.    The third compartment, the _omasum_, communicates anteriorly with the  second and first, and posteriorly with the fourth compartment or true  stomach. The interior arrangement of this compartment is most singular. It  is divided by a number of large folds of the lining membrane between which  are smaller folds. It is between these folds that the contents pass.    The first three compartments possess no glands capable of secreting a  digestive juice. However, important digestive changes occur. The  carbohydrates are digested by means of enzymes contained in the feed. The  most important function of the rumen and omasum is the maceration of the  fibrous substances, and the digestion of the cellulose. Between sixty and  seventy per cent of the cellulose is digested in the rumen.    _The abomasum_ is lined by a gastric mucous membrane. The gastric juice  secreted converts the protein into peptones. In the young a milk curdling  ferment is also secreted by the glands of this compartment.    THE STOMACH OF THE HOG is a type between the carnivora and ruminant. The  digestive changes may be divided into four stages. The first period is one  of starch conversion; the second period is the same, only more pronounced;  the third period, both starch and protein conversion occurs; and the fourth  period is taken up mostly with protein digestion.    ACUTE INDIGESTION OF THE STOMACH OF SOLIPEDS.--Diseases of the stomach are  less common in solipeds than in ruminants. The simple stomach of the horse  and the comparatively unimportant place that it occupies in the digestion  of the feed renders it less subject to disease. Only under the most  unfavorable conditions for digestion of the feed does this class of  disorders occur. Acute indigestion in the form of overloading and  fermentation occurs in the stomach (Fig. 11).    _The predisposing causes_ that have to do with the development of these  disorders, are the small capacity of the stomach and the location and  smallness of the openings leading from the oesophagus and into the small  intestines. Greedy eaters are more prone to indigestion than animals that  eat slowly and are fed intelligently.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Dilated stomach of horse.]    _The following exciting causes_ may be mentioned: Sudden changes in ration;  feeding too much green feed or grain; feeding frozen or decomposed feeds;  drinking ice-cold water; and violent exercise or work that the animal is  not accustomed to, immediately after feeding are the common  disease-producing factors.    _The symptoms_ may vary from impaired appetite and slight restlessness to  violent, colicky pains. In the large majority of cases the attendant is  unable to differentiate between this and other forms of acute indigestion.  The characteristic symptoms are attempts at regurgitation and vomiting,  assuming a dog-sitting position and finally such nervous symptoms as  champing of the jaws, staggering movement and extreme dulness.    The violent form of gastric indigestion frequently ends in death. Rupture  of the stomach is not an uncommon complication (Fig. 12).    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Rupture of stomach of horse.]    _The treatment_ is both preventive and medicinal. This digestive disorder  can be prevented. The feeding of the right kind of a ration and in the  right way, and avoiding conditions that may interfere with the digestion of  the feed, are the general lines of preventive treatment indicated. Such  measures are of special importance in the handling of animals that possess  an individual predisposition toward this class of disease. In mild attacks  the animal should be subjected to a rigid or careful diet during the attack  and for a few days later.    It is advisable to place the animal in a comfortable stall that is well  bedded with straw and plenty large for it to move about in. If a roomy  sick-stall can not be provided, a grass lot or barn floor may be used. If  the weather is chilly or cold, the body should be covered with a blanket  and roller bandages applied to the limbs.    Bulky drenches should not be given. Stimulants and drugs capable of  retarding fermentation are indicated. Sometimes the administration of a  sedative is indicated. Treatment should be prompt, as in many cases  fermentation of the contents of the stomach occurs and gases form rapidly.  From two to four ounces of oil of turpentine may be given in from six to  eight ounces of linseed oil.    ACUTE INDIGESTION OF THE STOMACH OF RUMINANTS.--The different forms of  acute indigestion are bloating, overloading of the rumen and impaction of  the omasum.    TYMPANITES, \"BLOATING.\"--This disorder is usually caused by animals feeding  on green feeds, such as clover, alfalfa and green corn, that ferment  readily. Stormy, rainy weather seems to favor bloating. The consumption of  spoiled feeds such as potatoes and beets may cause it. The drinking of a  large quantity of water, especially if cold, chills the wall of the rumen  and interferes with its movement. Frozen feeds may act in the same way.  Sudden changes in the feed, inflammation of the rumen, and a weak  peristaltic movement of the paunch resulting from disease or insufficient  nourishment are frequent causes. It may occur in chronic disease. In  tuberculosis, bloating sometimes occurs.    _The symptoms_ are as follows: The paunch or rumen occupies the left side  of the abdominal cavity, hence the distention of the abdominal wall by the  collecting of gas in the rumen occurs principally on that side. The gas  forms quickly and the distended wall is highly elastic and resonant. The  animal stops eating and ruminating, the back may be arched and the ears  droop. In the more severe cases the wall of the abdomen is distended on  both sides, the respirations are quickened and labored, the pulse small and  quick, the eyes are prominent and the mucous membrane congested. Death  results from asphyxia brought on by the distended paunch pushing forward  and interfering with the movement of the lungs and the absorption of the  poisonous gases.    _The treatment_ is both preventive and medicinal. This form of acute  indigestion can be largely prevented by practising the following preventive  measures: All changes in the feed should be made gradually, especially if  the ration fed is heavy, or the new ration consists largely of green,  succulent feed. Cattle pasturing on clover should be kept under close  observation. It is not advisable to pasture cattle on rank growths of  clover that are wet with dew or a light rain. Bloating can be quickly  relieved by puncturing the wall of the paunch with the trocar and cannula.  The operation is quite simple and is not followed by bad results. The  instrument is plunged through the walls of the abdomen and rumen in the  most prominent portion of the flank, midway between the border of the last  rib and the point of the haunch (Fig. 13). The trocar is then withdrawn  from the cannula. After the gas has escaped through the cannula, the trocar  is replaced and the instrument withdrawn. After using the trocar and  cannula, the instrument should be cleaned by placing it in boiling hot  water. It is advisable to wash the skin at the seat of the operation with a  disinfectant before operating. In chronic tympanitis, it is sometimes  advisable to leave the cannula in position by tying a tape to the flange,  passing it around the body and tying.    As a cathartic for cattle, we may give one quart of linseed and from two to  four ounces of turpentine, or one to two pounds of Epsom or Glauber's  salts, dissolved in plenty of water. Sheep may be given about one-fourth  the dose recommended for cattle.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--The X indicates the point where the wall of flank  and rumen are punctured with trocar and cannula in \"bloat.\"]    OVERLOADING THE RUMEN.--This form of indigestion occurs when ruminants have  access to feeds that they are not accustomed to. As a result, they eat  greedily and the mass of feed in the rumen becomes so heavy that the walls  of the organ can not move it about, and digestion is interfered with. This  is especially true of succulent feeds. A diseased condition of the animal  predisposes it to this disorder. If after eating an excessive amount of  dry, innutritions fodder, the animal drinks freely of cold water, acute  symptoms of overloading are manifested.    _The general symptoms_ occurring in overloading resembles those seen in  bloating. The symptoms may be mild and extend over a period of several  days, or it may take on a highly acute form, terminating fatally within a  few hours. The acuteness of the attack depends on the character and  quantity of feed eaten. If a large quantity of green feed is eaten,  fermentation occurs and the animal may die within a few hours. The swelling  on the left side has a doughy feel. It is not as elastic and resonant as in  bloat, even when complicated by some gas formation. The animal may stop  ruminating, refuse to eat, and act dull. In the more severe cases the  respirations are hurried and labored, the pulse small and quick and the  expression of the face indicates pain. Colicky pains sometimes occur. Death  may occur from shock or asphyxia.    _The treatment_ is both preventive and curative. This disease can be  prevented by using the necessary precautions to prevent animals from  overeating. If gas forms, the trocar and cannula should be used. A drench  of from one to two pounds of Epsom or Glauber's salts should be given.  Sheep may be given from four to six ounces of Epsom or Glauber's salts. We  should endeavor to stimulate the movement of the paunch by pressure on the  flank with the hand, throwing cold water on the wall of the abdomen and by  hypodermic injections of strychnine. Rumenotomy should be performed when  necessary. This operation consists in opening the walls"]]]
