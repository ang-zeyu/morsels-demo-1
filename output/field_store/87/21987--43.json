Now the bishop, desirous no doubt of paying a compliment to the alcalde  and the friar by intrusting these sacred relics to their care, in place  of taking upon himself the honourable office of being their bearer,  said:--\"The relics are indeed efficacious in cases of this nature; and  while handling them, the greatest sinner upon earth has nothing to fear  from an interview with any spirit. I possess the power of delegating to  whom I will, the high honour of bearing these relics,--and into your hands,  gentlemen, I will jointly commit them; and while you are engaged in the  performance of your duty, I will invoke for you the protection of our  tutelary saint.\"    Such, I say, was the colloquy that took place between the bishop, the  alcalde, and the friar,--and when this proposal was made by the bishop,  there can be no question that the fears of the alcalde were greatly  allayed; and that the qualms even of the friar were in some degree  quieted--so great was the confidence placed in the virtues of the relics.    Meanwhile, the hours passed away, and night came. I entertained little  doubt, that this very night the coffin would be sent for Isabel; trusting  to the efficacy of the threat held out to the confessor; and I prepared  accordingly. \"You will have nothing to do, Isabel,\" said I, \"but to follow  close at my heels.\" In thus providing for the escape of Isabel, I confess  it was chiefly a regard for my own safety that prompted me to this. A  sojourn of between one and two weeks in the tower, upon half the miserable  pittance of a prisoner, had greatly cooled the fever of my love; and I  foresaw that a companion would, in no small degree, interfere with my  projects of independence, and might even perhaps lessen the chances of  my ultimate escape,--but then, if Isabel were left behind, or could be  prevailed upon to allow herself to be put into her coffin, it was too much  to expect of her, that she would permit it to be consigned to the earth  without giving some audible demonstration of being alive; and if one part  of the trick were detected, threats or punishment would soon discover all  the other parts of it; and my recapture would no doubt be the consequence.  Besides--for why should I conceal the virtuous movements of my mind--I felt  a repugnance in leaving Isabel to perpetual imprisonment, or to the chance  of being buried alive; but feeling at the same time, that if successful in  delivering her from confinement, I should in that case have sufficiently  acquitted myself of obligations, and satisfied my scruples, I resolved that  upon the first favourable opportunity I would dispose of Isabel, and  recover my independence.    And now, the crisis was at hand. Slow, heavy steps, as of persons  carrying a burden, were heard approaching: other, and more hesitating  steps, mingled with these. At length they reached the massive iron door,  and the burden was put down. The thickness of the door was too great, to  permit the words spoken without to be heard within; but for some time  the monotonous sound of a voice continued--doubtless, a prayer of length  and efficacy by the Franciscan. The voice ceased; the chains and bolts  were one by one withdrawn; the door slowly swung back, and a glare of  flambeaux flashed into the cell. Isabel lay on the pallet, while I stood  motionless in the middle of the floor--my face turned towards the door,  and my hood partly thrown back. No sooner did the light reveal my  figure, than the coffin-bearers, uttering an affrighted scream, made but  one step from the top to the bottom of the staircase: for a moment the  alcalde and the friar, who partly expected what they saw, and who partly  trusted to the protection of the relics which they held in their hands,  stood their ground; crossing themselves with great rapidity, and  muttering prayers the while: but upon the first movement I made towards  them, they followed the coffin-bearers with so much precipitancy, that  in their eagerness which should be the first, both rolled down the  stairs, and the flambeaux falling from their trembling hands, were  extinguished.    \"Now is the time,\" said I in a whisper; and I quickly descended the  staircase, followed by Isabel. By the light of a smothered flambeau,  I could perceive that the alcalde and the friar lay senseless, whether  from fear or from wounds, I could not tell. The friar's habit had  somehow slipped off his shoulders; and thinking it might be useful as a  disguise, I picked it up, and stumbling also upon one of the boxes of  relics, I hid it in my bosom: there was no obstacle to our escape--the  doors all stood open; and in a few moments we found ourselves outside of  the tower, while the retreating steps of the coffin-bearers were heard  dying away in the distance. We lost not a moment's time, but immediately  proceeded quickly along the mole, which we had all to ourselves; the  terrified coffin-bearers had no doubt spread the alarm, for as we  approached every post was in its turn abandoned; the alarmed sentinels  throwing down their weapons, and flying before us; and I took care not  to neglect the opportunity of arming myself against need, with a good  sabre.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NATURALIST.           *       *       *       *       *      THE ORNITHORHYNCUS PARADOXUS.      The following interesting fact in natural history was communicated by  Dr. Weatherhead, to the committee of science of the Zoological Society,  at their last meeting.    For the last five-and-twenty years naturalists in Europe have  been striving to obtain the carcass of the impregnated female  _Ornithorhynchus paradoxus_, for the purpose of ascertaining its mode  of gestation, but without success; for it is by dissection alone that  the hitherto doubtful and disputed point concerning the anomalous  and paradoxical manner of bring forth and rearing its young can be  satisfactorily demonstrated. This long-sought-for desideratum is at  length attained. Through the kindness of his friend, Lieut. the  honourable Lauderdale Maule, of the 39th regiment, Dr. Weatherhead has  had the bodies of several _ornithorynchi_ transmitted to him from New  Holland, in one of which the ova preserved; establishing, along with  other curious circumstances ascertained, the extraordinary fact, that  this animal, which combines the bird and quadruped together in its  outward form, lays eggs and hatches them like the one, and rears and  suckles them like the other.--_Proc.

This soldier of fortune being one day, during the siege of Toulon, at his  post at the battery of St. Culottes, an officer of artillery, who had  recently come from Paris to direct the operations of the siege, asked from  the officer who commanded the post for a young non-commissioned officer who  had at once intelligence and boldness. The officer immediately called for  Junot; the officer surveyed him with that eye which already began to take  the measure of human capacity.    \"You will change your dress,\" said the commander, \"and you will go there  to bear this order.\" He showed him with his hand a spot at a distance on  the same side. The young sergeant blushed up to the eyes; his eyes  kindled with fire. \"I am not a spy,\" said he, \"to execute their orders;  seek another to bear them.\" \"Do you refuse to obey?\" said the superior  officer; \"do you know to what punishment you expose yourself in so  doing?\" \"I am ready to obey,\" said Junot, \"but I will go in my uniform,  or not at all.\" The commander smiled, and looked at him attentively.  \"But if you do, they will kill you.\" \"What does that signify?\" said  Junot; \"you know me little to imagine I would be pained at such an  occurrence, and, as for me, it is all one--come, I go as I am; is it not  so?\" And he set off singing.    After he was gone, the superior officer asked, \"What is the name of that  young man?\" \"Junot,\" replied the other. The commanding officer then  wrote his name in his pocket-book. \"He will make his way,\" he replied.  This judgment was already of decisive importance to Junot, for the  reader must readily have divined that the officer of artillery was  Napoleon.    A few days after, being on his rounds at the same battery, Bonaparte  asked for some one who could write well. Junot stepped out of the ranks  and presented himself. Bonaparte recognised him as the sergeant who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11544"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#7)"],[1,"that white people had it and  told him where they lived and told him he would have to have a white man  go and git it for him. He was working for a good man and he told him  about it. He advertised for the colt and the next day, the man that  stole it came and told him that a colt had been found over on his place  and for him to come over and arrange to git it. But he said, 'No, I've  placed that matter in the hands of my boss.' He told his boss about it,  but the fellow brought the horse and give it to the boss without any  argument.      Family and Masters    \"My old master's slaves were called free niggers. He and his wife never  mistreated their slaves. When any of Madden's slaves were out and the  pateroles got after them, if they could make it home, that ended it.  Nobody beat Madden's niggers.    \"My father's name was Allen Madden and my mother's name was Amy Madden.  I knew my grandfather and grandmother on my mother's side. My  grandfather and grandmother never were 'round me though that I can  remember.    \"When the old man died, the Negroes were divided out. This boy got so  many and that one got so many. The old man, Mabe Madden, had two sons,  John and Little Mabe. My mother and father went to John. They were in  Talladega because John stayed there.    \"My father's mother and father fell to Little Mabe Madden. They never  did come to Alabama but I have heard my father talk about them so much.  My father's father was named Harry. His last name must have been Madden.    \"My grandfather on my mother's side was named Charlie Hall. He married  into the Madden family. He belonged to the Halls before he married. Old  man Charlie, his master, had a plantation that wasn't far from the  Madden's plantation. In those days, if you met a girl and fell in love  with her, you could git a pass and go to see her if you wanted to. You  didn't have to be on the same plantation at all. And you could marry her  and go to see her, and have children by her even though you belonged to  different masters. The Maddens never did buy Hall. Grandma never would  change her name to Hall. He stayed at my house after we married, stayed  with me sometimes, and stayed with his other son sometimes.    \"My mother was born a Madden. She was born right at Madden's place. When  grandma married Hall, like it is now, she would have been called Hall.  But she was born a Madden and stayed Madden and never did change to her  husband's name. So my mother was born a Madden although her father's  name was Hall.    \"I don't know what sort of man Mabe was, and I only know what my parents  said about John. They said he was a good man and I have to say what they  said. He didn't let nobody impose on his niggers. Pateroles did git  after them and bring them in with the hounds, but when they got in, that  settled it. Madden never would allow white people to beat on his  niggers.    \"They tried to git my daddy out so that they could whip him, but they  couldn't catch him. They shot him--the pateroles did--but he whipped  them. My daddy was a coon. I mean he was a good man.      Early Life    \"My brother was big enough to mind gaps. That was in slavery times. They  had good fences around the field. They didn't have gates like they do  now. They had gaps. The fence would zigzag, and the rails could be  lifted down at one section, and that would leave a gap. If you left a  gap, the stock would go into the field. When there was a gap, my brother  would stay in it and keep the stock from passing. When the folks would  come to dinner, he would go in and eat dinner with them just as big as  anybody. When they would leave, the gap would stay down till night. It  stayed down from morning till noon and from one o'clock till the men  come in at night. The gap was a place in the rails like I told you where  they could take down the rails to pass. It took time to lay the rails  down and more time to place then back up again. They wouldn't do it.  They would leave them down till they come back during the work hours and  a boy that was too small to do anything else was put to mind them. My  brother used to do that and I would keep him company. When I heard old  master coming there, I'd be gone, yes siree. I would see him when he  left the house and when he got to the gap, I would be home or at my  grandfather's.      Occupational Experiences    \"I have followed farming all my life. That is the sweetest life a man  can lead. I have been farming all my life principally. My occupation is  farming. That is it was until I lost my health. I ain't done nothin' for  about four years now. I would follow public work in the fall of the year  and make a crop every year. Never failed till I got disabled. I used to  make all I used and all I needed to feed my stock. I even raised my own  wheat before I left home in Alabama. That is a wheat country. They don't  raise it out here.[HW: ?]    \"I came here--lemme see, about how many years ago did I come here. I  guess I have been in Arkansas about twenty-eight years since the first  time I come here. I have gone in and out as I got a chance to work  somewheres. I have been living in this house about three years.    \"I preached for about twenty or more years. I don't know that I call  myself a preacher. I am a pretty good talker sometimes. I have never  pastored a church; somehow or 'nother the word come to me to go and I go  and talk. I ain't no pulpit chinch. I could have taken two or three  men's churches out from under them, but I didn't.      Freedom and Soldiers    \"I can't remember just how my father got freed. Old folks then didn't  let you stan' and listen when they talked. If you did it once, you  didn't do it again. They would talk while they were together, but the  children would have business outdoors. Yes siree, I never heard them say  much about how they got freedom.    \"I was there when the Yankees come through. That was in slave time. They  marched right through old man Madden's grove. They were playing the  fifes and beating the drums. And they were playing the fiddle. Yes sir,  they were playing the fiddle too. It must have been a fiddle; it sounded  just like one. The soldiers were all just a singin'. They didn't bother  nobody at our house. If they bothered anything, nothing was told me  about it. I heard my uncle say they took a horse from my old manager. I  didn't see it. They took the best horse in the lot my uncle said. Pardon  me, they didn't take him. A peckerwood took him and let the Yankees get  him. I have heard that they bothered plenty of other places. Took the  best mules, and left old broken down ones and things like that. Broke  things up. I have heard that about other places, but I didn't see any of  it.      Right after the War    \"Right after the War, my father went to farming--renting land. I mean he  sharecropped and done around. Thing is come way up from then when the  Negroes first started. They didn't have no stock nor nothin' then. They  made a crop just for the third of it. When they quit the third, they  started givin' them two-fifths. That's more than a third, ain't it? Then  they moved up from that, and give them half, and they are there yet. If  you furnish, they give you two-thirds and take one-third. Or they give  you so much per acre or give him produce in rent.      Marriage    \"I was married in 1883. My wife's name was Mary Elston. Her mother died  when she was an infant. Her grandmother was an Elston at first. Then she  changed her name to Cunningham. But she always went in the name of  Elston, and was an Elston when she married me. My wife I mean. I married  on a Thursday in the Christmas week. This December I will be married  fifty-five years. This is the only wife I have ever had. We had three  children and all of them are dead. All our birthed children are dead.  One of them was just three months old when he died. My baby girl had  three children and she lived to see all of them married.      Opinions    \"Our own folks is about the worst enemies we have. They will come and  sweet talk you and then work against you. I had a fellow in here not  long ago who came here for a dollar, and I never did hear from him again  after he got it. He couldn't get another favor from me. No man can fool  me more than one time. I have been beat out of lots of money and I have  got hurt trying to help people.    \"The young folks now is just gone astray. I tell you the truth, I  wouldn't give you forty cents a dozen for these young folks. They are  sassy and disrespectful. Don't respect themselves and nobody else. When  they get off from home, they'll respect somebody else better 'n they  will their own mothers.    \"If they would do away with this stock law, they would do better  everywhere. If you would say fence up your place and raise what you  want, I could get along. But you have to keep somebody to watch your  stock. If you don't, you'll have to pay something out. It's a bad old  thing this stock law. It's detrimental to the welfare of man.\"          Interviewer: Mrs. Bernice Bowden  Person interviewed: Lewis Mann                      1501 Bell Street, Pine Bluff, Arkansas  Age: 81      \"As nigh as I can come at it, I was bout five or six time of the war.
