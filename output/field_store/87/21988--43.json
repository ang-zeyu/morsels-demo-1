K[)U]T-O'-YIS    Long ago, down where Two Medicine and Badger Creeks come together, there  lived an old man. He had but one wife and two daughters. One day there came  to his camp a young man who was very brave and a great hunter. The old man  said: \"Ah! I will have this young man to help me. I will give him my  daughters for wives.\" So he gave him his daughters. He also gave this  son-in-law all his wealth, keeping for himself only a little lodge, in  which he lived with his old wife. The son-in-law lived in a lodge that was  big and fine.    At first the son-in-law was very good to the old people. Whenever he  killed anything, he gave them part of the meat, and furnished plenty of  robes and skins for their bedding and clothing. But after a while he began  to be very mean to them.    Now the son-in-law kept the buffalo hidden under a big log jam in the  river. Whenever he wanted to kill anything, he would have the old man go to  help him; and the old man would stamp on the log jam and frighten the  buffalo, and when they ran out, the young man would shoot one or two, never  killing wastefully. But often he gave the old people nothing to eat, and  they were hungry all the time, and began to grow thin and weak.    One morning, the young man called his father-in-law to go down to the log  jam and hunt with him. They started, and the young man killed a fat buffalo  cow. Then he said to the old man, \"Hurry back now, and tell your children  to get the dogs and carry this meat home, then you can have something to  eat.\" And the old man did as he had been ordered, thinking to himself:  \"Now, at last, my son-in-law has taken pity on me. He will give me part of  this meat.\" When he returned with the dogs, they skinned the cow, cut up  the meat and packed it on the dog travois, and went home. Then the young  man had his wives unload it, and told his father-in-law to go home. He did  not give him even a piece of liver. Neither would the older daughter give  her parents anything to eat, but the younger took pity on the old people  and stole a piece of meat, and when she got a chance threw it into the  lodge to the old people. The son-in-law told his wives not to give the old  people anything to eat. The only way they got food was when the younger  woman would throw them a piece of meat unseen by her husband and sister.    Another morning, the son-in-law got up early, and went and kicked on the  old man's lodge to wake him, and called him to get up and help him, to go  and pound on the log jam to drive out the buffalo, so that he could kill  some. When the old man pounded on the jam, a buffalo ran out, and the  son-in-law shot it, but only wounded it. It ran away, but at last fell down  and died. The old man followed it, and came to where it had lost a big clot  of blood from its wound. When he came to where this clot of blood was lying  on the ground, he stumbled and fell, and spilled his arrows out of his  quiver; and while he was picking them up, he picked up also the clot of  blood, and hid it in his quiver. \"What are you picking up?\" called out the  son-in-law. \"Nothing,\" said the old man; \"I just fell down and spilled my  arrows, and am putting them back.\" \"Curse you, old man,\" said the  son-in-law, \"you are lazy and useless. Go back and tell your children to  come with the dogs and get this dead buffalo.\" He also took away his bow  and arrows from the old man.    The old man went home and told his daughters, and then went over to his own  lodge, and said to his wife: \"Hurry now, and put the kettle on the fire. I  have brought home something from the butchering.\" \"Ah!\" said the old woman,  \"has our son-in-law been generous, and given us something nice?\" \"No,\"  answered the old man; \"hurry up and put the kettle on.\" When the water  began to boil, the old man tipped his quiver up over the kettle, and  immediately there came from the pot a noise as of a child crying, as if it  were being hurt, burnt or scalded. They looked in the kettle, and saw there  a little boy, and they quickly took it out of the water. They were very  much surprised. The old woman made a lashing to put the child in, and then  they talked about it. They decided that if the son-in-law knew that it was  a boy, he would kill it, so they resolved to tell their daughters that the  baby was a girl. Then he would be glad, for he would think that after a  while he would have it for a wife. They named the child K[)u]t-o'-yis (Clot  of Blood).    The son-in-law and his wives came home, and after a while he heard the  child crying. He told his youngest wife to go and find out whether that  baby was a boy or a girl; if it was a boy, to tell them to kill it. She  came back and told them that it was a girl. He did not believe this, and  sent his oldest wife to find out the truth of the matter. When she came  back and told him the same thing, he believed that it was really a  girl. Then he was glad, for he thought that when the child had grown up he  would have another wife. He said to his youngest wife, \"Take some pemmican  over to your mother; not much, just enough so that there will be plenty of  milk for the child.\"    Now on the fourth day the child spoke, and said, \"Lash me in turn to each  one of these lodge poles, and when I get to the last one, I will fall out  of my lashing and be grown up.\" The old woman did so, and as she lashed  him to each lodge pole he could be seen to grow, and finally when they  lashed him to the last pole, he was a man. After K[)u]t-o'-yis had looked  about the inside of the lodge, he looked out through a hole in the lodge  covering, and then, turning round, he said to the old people: \"How is it  there is nothing to eat in this lodge? I see plenty of food over by the  other lodge.\" \"Hush up,\" said the old woman, \"you will be heard. That is  our son-in-law. He does not give us anything at all to eat.\" \"Well,\" said  K[)u]t-o'-yis, \"where is your pis'kun?\" The old woman said, \"It is down by  the river. We pound on it and the buffalo come out.\"    Then the old man told him how his son-in-law abused him. \"He has taken my  weapons from me, and even my dogs; and for many days we have had nothing to  eat, except now and then a small piece of meat our daughter steals for us.\"    \"Father,\" said K[)u]t-o'-yis, \"have you no arrows?\" \"No, my son,\" he  replied; \"but I have yet four stone points.\"    \"Go out then and get some wood,\" said K[)u]t-o'-yis. \"We will make a bow  and arrows. In the morning we will go down and kill something to eat.\"    Early in the morning K[)u]t-o'-yis woke the old man, and said, \"Come, we  will go down now and kill when the buffalo come out.\" When they had reached  the river, the old man said: \"Here is the place to stand and shoot. I will  go down and drive them out.\" As he pounded on the jam, a fat cow ran out,  and K[)u]t-o'-yis killed it.    Meantime the son-in-law had gone out, and as usual knocked on the old man's  lodge, and called to him to get up and go down to help him kill. The old  woman called to him that her husband had already gone down. This made the  son-in-law very angry. He said: \"I have a good mind to kill you right now,  old woman. I guess I will by and by.\"    The son-in-law went on down to the jam, and as he drew near, he saw the old  man bending over, skinning a buffalo. \"Old man,\" said he, \"stand up and  look all around you. Look well, for it will be your last look.\" Now when  he had seen the son-in-law coming, K[)u]t-o'-yis had lain down and hidden  himself behind the buffalo's carcass. He told the old man to say to his  son-in-law, \"You had better take your last look, for I am going to kill  you, right now.\" The old man said this. \"Ah!\" said the son-in-law, \"you  make me angrier still, by talking back to me.\" He put an arrow to his bow  and shot at the old man, but did not hit him. K[)u]t-o'-yis told the old  man to pick up the arrow and shoot it back at him, and he did so. Now they  shot at each other four times, and then the old man said to K[)u]t-o'-yis:  \"I am afraid now. Get up and help me.\" So K[)u]t-o'-yis got up on his feet  and said: \"Here, what are you doing? I think you have been badly treating  this old man for a long time.\"    Then the son-in-law smiled pleasantly, for he was afraid of  K[)u]t-o'-yis. \"Oh, no,\" he said, \"no one thinks more of this old man than  I do. I have always taken great pity on him.\"    Then K[)u]t-o'-yis said: \"You lie. I am going to kill you now.\" He shot him  four times, and the man died. Then K[)u]t-o'-yis told the old man to go and  bring down the daughter who had acted badly toward him. He did so, and  K[)u]t-o'-yis killed her. Then he went up to the lodges and said to the  younger woman, \"Perhaps you loved your husband.\" \"Yes,\" she said, \"I love  him.\" So he killed her, too. Then he said to the old people: \"Go over there  now, and live in that lodge. There is plenty there to eat, and when it is  gone I will kill more. As for myself, I will make a journey around  about. Where are there any people? In what direction?\" \"Well,\" said the old  man, \"up above here on Badger Creek and Two Medicine, where the pis'kun is,  there are some people.\"    K[)u]t-o'-yis went up to where the pis'kun was, and saw there many lodges  of people. In the centre of the camp was a large lodge, with a figure of a  bear painted on it. He did not go into this lodge, but went into a very  small one near by, where two old women lived; and when he went in, he asked  them for something to eat. They set before him some lean dried meat and  some belly fat. \"How is this?\" he asked. \"Here is a pis'kun with plenty of  fat meat and back fat. Why do you not give me some of that?\" \"Hush,\" said  the old women. \"In that big lodge near by, lives a big bear and his wives  and children. He takes all those nice things and leaves us nothing. He is  the chief of this place.\"    Early in the morning, K[)u]t-o'-yis told the old women to get"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11553"],[0,"The Wonders of Prayer (#7)"],[1,"im.    \"Our friends and brethren in Cadereita tried hard to deter us from  going, as most likely we would fall into the hands of General Cortinas;  in which event, they said, the very utmost we could expect would be to  escape with our lives, being left destitute of everything, in a  wilderness road; but, as God had seemed to open up the way, providing  the means, we determined to go forward, trusting that He also would  protect us in the way. Therefore, having completed our arrangements, we  started for Matamoras, some three hundred miles distant, on the 19th of  March, the wives of the two men accompanying their husbands, making our  party six adults and one child; the brethren in Cadereita promising to  pray daily for our safety. The third morning, after commending  ourselves, as usual, into the care of our covenant-keeping God, we  started on our journey. Some two hours later, we espied the troops of  General Cortinas, about two miles distant, marching toward us. We again  all looked to God for protection, and prayed that, as he shut the mouths  of the lions, that they should not hurt his servant Daniel, so He would  now restrain the evil passions of men, that they might not hurt nor  injure us--then we went on till we met the advance guard, who commanded  us to halt and wait till the General came up. After nearly half an hour,  General Cortinas, with his escort, rode up to where we were waiting for  him. After the ordinary salutation, he asked: (_?de adonde vienen y  adonde van?_) 'From whence have you come, and where are you going?'--to  which we replied properly; then he asked: 'What is the news from Nueva  Leon?' (the State we left)--to which we replied as faithfully as we  could. Then I asked him, 'Is the road safe between us and Matamoras?' He  replied: 'Perfectly; you can go on without any fear, and as safely as  you would in your own country.' Then, bidding us 'good morning,' he rode  on, not even inquiring about or examining any of our baggage.    \"When we arrived in Brownsville, Texas, and told of how gentlemanly  General Cortinas had treated us, all pronounced it wonderful, and said,  'We could not have believed General Cortinas capable of such kindness to  Americans so in his power. It was truly a miracle.' We believed that it  was God who restrained the naturally vicious passions of the man, in  direct answer to prayer.\"      AN INFIDEL'S LIFE SPARED A FEW DAYS.      \"During the Summer of 1862, I became acquainted with a Mr. A----, who  professed infidelity, and who was, I think, as near an atheist as any I  ever met. I held several conversations with him on the subject of  religion, but could not seem to make any impression on his mind, and,  when a point was pressed strongly, he would become angry.    \"In the Fall, he was taken ill, and seemed to go into a rapid decline.  I, with others, sought kindly and prayerfully to turn his mind to his  need of a Saviour, but only met with rebuffs. As I saw that his end was  drawing near, one day I pressed the importance of preparing to meet God,  when he became angry and said I need not trouble myself any more about  his soul, as there was no God, the Bible was a fable, and when we die  that is the last of us, and was unwilling that I should pray with him. I  left him, feeling very sad.    \"Some four weeks after, on New Year's morning, I awoke with the  impression that I should go and see Mr. A----, and I could not get rid  of that impression; so, about nine o'clock, I went to see him, and, as I  approached the house, I saw the two doctors, who had been holding a  consultation, leaving. When I rang the bell, his sister-in-law opened  the door for me, and exclaimed, 'Oh! I am so glad you have come; John is  dying. The doctors say he cannot possibly live above two hours, and  probably not one.' When I went up to his room, he sat bolstered up in a  chair, and appeared to have fallen into a doze. I sat down, about five  feet from him, and when, in about two minutes, he opened his eyes and  saw me, he started up, with agony pictured on his face and in the tones  of his voice, exclaimed, 'O! Mr. P----, I am not prepared to die; there  is a God; the Bible is true! O, pray for me! pray God to spare me a few  days, till I shall know I am saved.'    \"These words were uttered with the intensest emotion, while his whole  physical frame quivered through the intense agony of his soul. I replied  in effect, that Jesus was a great Saviour, able and willing to save all  who would come unto Him, even at the eleventh hour, as He did the thief  on the cross.    \"When I was about to pray with him, he again entreated me to pray  especially that God would spare him a few days, till he might have the  evidences of his salvation. In prayer, I seemed to have great assurance  of his salvation, and asked God to give us the evidence of his  salvation, by granting him a few days more in this world. Several others  joined in praying God to spare him a few days, till he should give  evidence of being saved.    \"I called again in the evening; he seemed even stronger than in the  morning, and his mind was seeking the truth. The next day, as I  entered, his face expressed the fact that peace and joy had  taken the place of fear and anxiety. He was spared some five  days, giving very clear evidence that he had passed from death to life.  His case was a great mystery to the doctors. They could not understand  how he lived so long; but his friends, who had been praying for him, all  believed it was in direct answer to prayer.\"      REMARKABLE PRESERVATION FROM BRAIN DIFFICULTIES.      \"A few weeks ago, a man who had once been a member of my church, but had  fallen from his steadfastness through strong drink, fell from a ladder,  striking his head on the corner of a stone, which made a dent in the  skull of over two and one-half inches in length, and three-fourths of an  inch in width, and half an inch in depth. This happened on Friday  afternoon. At our prayer-meeting, in the evening, most earnest prayers  were offered in his behalf; the brethren prayed that God would restore  him his senses and spare him a few days, that he might repent of his  back-sliding and be saved.    \"The surgeons raised the skull, and his senses were restored; his mind  seemed clear. This continued over a week, when it was evident that there  was still some pressure on the brain. The surgeons removed the skull,  and found three pieces driven down into the brain. They expressed, from  the first, no hope of his recovery; but wondered much at the clearness  of his mind, which continued for over two weeks. We believed that it was  in answer to the prayers of the church that he might have time and  opportunity to repent and prepare to meet God, which we trust he did.\"      LITTLE GEORGE'S PRAYER.      A clergyman writes us these incidents:    \"I knew a poor family whose son George, four or five years old, was  accustomed to pray. They lived five or six miles from neighbors, and, at  times, were quite destitute. One day, as little George observed his  mother weeping over their destitution, he said, \"Why, mother, don't cry  any; we shall not starve; God will send us something to eat, I know He  will. I've just been praying, and asked Him to.\" The little fellow just  as much believed God would send them food, as if he had asked a reliable  neighbor and obtained his promise to supply their wants. In a day or two  after this, some friends living at a distance and knowing they were  poor, took them the welcome surprise of a wagon-load of substantial  material for food and other comforts. The little boy grew up to be a  Christian minister, and, about a year ago, on inquiry, his uncle told me  he had been at the head of an institution of learning in the  South-west.\"      A PRAYER FOR A HORSE.      \"My horse died, and, after traveling through the snow-drifts to my  appointments, till I was lame, half sick, and unfit for service--as I  had not means to purchase a horse, I thought of quitting the work and  going to teaching, and laid the matter before God, in prayer; soon after  which, some person at a distance, who heard that I had lost my horse,  without my saying a word about it, raised the means by which I procured  another.\"      A PRAYER FOR A WIFE.      \"When I believed it would be well for me to seek a companion for life, I  asked of God direction in making a wise choice, and that, in a matter of  so much importance to me and others, I might meet with success or  _hindrance_, as my heavenly Father knew best. He led me to a choice and  marriage, which I have not since regretted.\"      CHURCH TROUBLES QUELLED.      \"I might mention a dozen instances in which church troubles were  gathering, and trials between members appeared certain, when all my  tactics failed, and the wisdom of brethren was of no avail; my last  resort was to ask God to send help and deliver from the threatened  evil--and in ways that no one could foresee, complete deliverance came.\"      A MINISTER'S SUPPLIES FALL SHORT.      \"When very much in need of funds to procure supplies for a coming  Winter, all expedients failed; then I asked God for assistance, when,  unexpectedly, a friend in California sent me a little package of gold  dust, which I sold, at once, for $130. This came when it was needed, and  it did us good.\"      A PRAYER FOR A SERVANT.      \"Some time after, we failed to find anything like suitable help in the  house, which we greatly needed. Before starting out one morning, in  secret I prayed to God to direct me as I went on my uncertain business,  and prayed as I called at different places, and soon found a colored  girl sixteen years old wanting a place, who came and proved to be the  best help we ever had, before or since. For seven years and a half she  lived in the family, taught two of our children to read; was glad, from  choice, to move with us to different places, till she left to be  married, fell sick and passed away.
