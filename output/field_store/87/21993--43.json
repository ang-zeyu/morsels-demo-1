A  wire can be made from it finer than from any other metal. I have a sample  in my pocket, the gauge of which is only one two-thousandth of an inch,  and it is practicable to make it thinner. It has even been affirmed that  platinum wire has been made so fine as to be invisible to the naked eye,  but that I do not state as of my own knowledge. This wire my son made.\"    Mr. Baker exhibited the sample spoken of. It looked like a tress of silky  hair, and had it not been shown upon a piece of black paper could hardly  have been seen. He went on:    \"The draw plates, by means of which these fine wires are made, are  sapphires and rubies. You may fancy for yourselves how extremely delicate  must be the work of making holes of such exceeding smallness to accurate  gauge, too, in those very hard stones. I get all my draw plates from an  old Swiss lady in New York, who makes them herself to order. But, delicate  as is the work of boring the holes, there is something still more delicate  in the processes that produce such fine wire as this. That something is  the filing of a long point on the wire to enable the poking of the end of  it through the draw plate so that it can be caught by the nippers. Imagine  yourself filing a long, tapering point on the end of a wire only one  eighteen-hundredths of an inch in diameter, in order to get it through a  draw plate that will bring it down to one two-thousandths. My son does  that without using a magnifying glass. I cannot say positively what uses  this very thin wire is put to, but something in surgery, I believe, either  for fastening together portions of bone or for operations. A newly  invented instrument has been described to me, which, if it does what has  been affirmed, is one of the greatest and most wonderful discoveries of  modern science. A very thin platinum wire loop, brought to incandescence  by the current from a battery--which, though of great power, is so small  that it hangs from the lapel of the operator's coat--is used instead of a  knife for excisions and certain amputations. It sears as it cuts, prevents  the loss of blood, and is absolutely painless, which is the most  astonishing thing about it.    \"Our greatest consumers of platinum are the electricians, particularly the  incandescent light companies. I supply the platinum wire for both the  Edison and the Maxim companies, and the quantity they require so  constantly increases that the demand threatens to exceed the supply of the  metal. Sheets of platinum are bought by chemists, who have them converted  into crucibles and other forms.\"    The reporter's curiosity was awakened by Mr. Baker's mention of the old  lady who made those very fine draw plates, and on his return to the city  he hunted her up. Mrs. Francis A. Jeannot, the lady in question, was found  in neat apartments in a handsome flat in West Fifty-first street. Age has  silvered her hair, but her eyes are still bright, and her movements  indicate elasticity and strength. She is a native of Neufchatel,  Switzerland, and speaks English with a little difficulty, but whenever the  reporter's English was a little hard for her a very pretty girl with  brilliant eyes and crinkly jet-black hair, who subsequently proved to be a  daughter of Mrs. Jeannot, came to the rescue. With the girl's occasional  aid, the old lady's story was as follows:    \"I have been in this business for thirty years. I learned it when I was a  girl in Switzerland. Very few in this country know anything correctly  about it. Numbers of people endeavor to find it out, and they experiment  to learn it, especially to do it by machinery, but without success. But,  ah, me! It is no longer a business that is anything worth. Thirty years  ago many stone draw plates were wanted, for then there was a great deal  done in filigree gold jewelry. Then the plates were worth from $2.50 up to  as high as $15, according to the magnitude of the stones and the size of  the holes I bored in them. Now, however, all that good time is past.  Nobody wants filigree gold jewelry any more, and there is so little demand  for fine wire of the precious metals that few draw plates are desired. The  prices now are no more than from $1.25 up to say $8, but it is very rare  that one is required the cost of which is more than $4. And of that a very  large part must go to the lapidary to pay for the stone and for his work  in cutting it to an even round disk. Then, what I get for the long and  hard work of boring the stone by hand is very little. 'By hand?' Oh, yes.  That must always be the only good way. The work of the machine is not  perfect. It never produces such good plates as are made by the hand and  eye of the trained artisan. 'How are they bored?' Ah, sir, you must excuse  me that I do not tell you that. It is simple, but there is just a little  of it that is a secret, and that little makes a vast difference between  producing work which is good and that which is not. It has cost me no  little to learn it, and while it is worth very little just now, perhaps  fashion may change, and plates may be wanted to make gold wire again to an  extent that may be profitable. I do not wish to tell everybody that which  will deprive me of the little advantage my knowledge gives me. 'The  stones?' Oh, we of course do not use finely colored ones. They are too  valuable. But those that we employ must be genuine sapphires and rubies,  sound and without flaws. Here are some. You see they look like only  irregular lumps of muddy-tinted broken glass. Here is a finished one.\"    The old lady exhibited a piece of solid brass about an inch long,  three-quarters of an inch in width, and one-sixteenth in thickness. In its  center was a small disk of stone with a hole through it, a hole that was  very smooth, wide on one side and hardly perceptible on the other. The  stone was sunk deep into the brass and bedded firmly in it. She went on:    \"You will find, if you try, that you can with difficulty push through that  hole a hair from your beard. But, small as it is, it must be perfectly  smooth, and of an accurate gauge. I do not any longer myself set the  stones in the brass, as I am not so strong as I once was. My son does that  for me. But neither he nor my daughter, nor anybody else in this country,  I believe, can bore the holes so well as I can even yet. 'How long does a  draw plate last?' Ah! Practically forever. Except by clumsy handling or  accident, it does not need to be replaced, at least in one lifetime. And  there is another reason why I sell so few now. Those who require them are  supplied. 'Watch jewels?' Yes, I used to make them, but do so no longer.  They can be imported from Europe at the price of $1 a dozen, and at such a  figure one could not earn bread in making them here.\"--_Manuf. Gazette._           *       *       *       *       *          BAYLE'S LAMP CHIMNEY.      The different types of lamps used in domestic lighting present several  imperfections, and daily experience shows too often how difficult it is,  even with the most careful and best studied models, to have a perfect  combustion of the usual liquids--oil, kerosene, etc.    [Illustration: BAYLE'S NEW LAMP CHIMNEY.]    Mr. P. Bayle has endeavored to remedy this state of things by experiments  upon the chimney, inasmuch as he could not think of modifying the  arrangements of the lamps of commerce \"without injury to man\" interests,  and encountering material difficulties.    The chimney is not only an apparatus designed to carry off the smoke and  gases due to combustion, for its principal role is to break the  equilibrium of the atmospheric air, which is the great reservoir of  oxygen, and to suck into the flame, through the difference of densities,  this indispensable agent to combustion. The lamps which we now use are  provided with cylindrical chimneys either with or without a shoulder at  the base. The shouldered chimney would be sufficient to suck in the  quantity of air necessary for a good combustion if we could at will  increase its dimensions in the direction of the diameter or height. But,  on account of the fragile nature of the material of which it consists, as  also because of the arrangement of the lighting apparatus, we are forced  lo give the chimney limited dimensions. The result is an insufficient  draught, and consequently an imperfect combustion. It became a question,  then, of finding a chimney which, with small dimensions, should have great  suctional power. Mr. Bayle has taken advantage of the properties of  convergent-divergent ajutages, and of the discovery of Mr. Romilly that a  current of gas directed into the axis and toward the small base of a  truncated cone, at a definite distance therefrom, has the property of  drawing along with it a quantity of air nearly double that which this same  current could carry along if it were directed toward a cylinder. In  getting up his new chimney, Mr. Bayle has utilized these principles as  follows: Round-burner lamps have, as well known, two currents of air--an  internal current which traverses the small tube that carries the wick, and  an external one which passes under the chimney-holder externally to the  wick. In giving the upper part of the chimney, properly so called, the  form of a truncated cone whose smaller base is turned toward the internal  current of air, that is to say, in directing this current toward the  contracted part of the upper cone, at the point where the depression is  greatest, a strong suction is brought about, which has the effect of  carrying"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11649"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 799, April 25, 1891 (#7)"],[1,"e, except in that the  strains are transmitted through a single fly wheel, which is attached to  a crank shaft connecting the engines. In other words, a duplex air  compressor would be identical with a duplex steam engine were it not for  the fact that air cylinders are connected to the steam piston rods. The  result is, as shown in Fig. 7, that, at that point of the stroke  indicated in the top section, the upper right hand steam cylinder,  having steam at full pressure behind its piston, is doing work through  the angle of the crank shaft upon the air in the lower left hand  cylinder. At this point of the stroke the opposite steam cylinder has a  reduced steam pressure and is doing little or no work, because the  opposite air cylinder is beginning its stroke. Referring now to the  lower section, it will be seen that the conditions are reversed. One  crank has turned the center, and that piston which in the upper section  was doing the greatest work is now doing little or nothing, while the  labor of the engine has been transferred to those cylinders which a  moment before had been doing no work.    There are some advantages in this duplex construction, and some  disadvantages. The crank shafts being set quartering, as is the usual  construction, the engine may be run at low speed without getting on the  center. Each half being complete in itself, it is possible to detach the  one when only half the capacity is required. The power and resistance  being equalized through opposite cylinders, large fly wheels are not  necessary. Strange to say, the American practice seems to be to attach  enormous fly wheels to duplex air compressors. It is difficult to  justify this apparently useless expense in view of the facts shown in  Fig. 7. A fly wheel does not furnish power, nor does it add to the  economy of an engine except in so far as it enables it to cut off early  in the stroke, and to equalize the power and resistance. In other words,  a fly wheel is not a _source_ of power, and in many cases it is only a  means by which we accomplish rotative speed. It takes power to move  matter, and assuming that other conditions are equal, every engine that  carries a fly wheel that is larger than is necessary consumes a certain  number of foot pounds in turning so much metal around through space.  Were it possible to cut off at the same point and rotate as positively  without a fly wheel, it would be done away with entirely. Some straight  line air compressors are so constructed that the momentum of the piston  and other moving parts is nearly sufficient to equalize the strains  without a fly wheel; but the fly wheel is there because it insures a  definite length of stroke, and because it enables us to operate  eccentrics and to regulate the speed of the engine uniformly.    Objections to the duplex construction are: The strains are indirect,  angular and intermittent. It is necessary therefore to largely increase  the strength of parts; to add a crank shaft of large diameter with  enormous bearings, and to build expensive and very secure foundations.  Should the foundations settle at any point, excessive strains will be  brought upon the bearings, resulting in friction and liability to  breakage. A steam engine meets with a resistance on its crank shaft that  is uniform throughout the stroke; while an air compressor is subject to  a heavy maximum strain at the end of the stroke, hence the importance of  direct straight line connection between power and resistance.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]    The friction loss on a duplex compressor seldom gets lower than 15 per  cent., while straight line compressors show as low a loss as 5 per cent.  Fig. 8 illustrates the Rand Duplex Air Compressor, a machine largely  used in America, especially in the Lake Superior iron mines. Fig. 9  illustrates a Duplex Compound Condensing Corliss Air Compressor built by  the Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill Company. This is a compressor made of the  best type of Corliss engine, with air cylinders connected to the tail  rods of the steam cylinders. One of these machines, of about 400 horse  power capacity, is now at work furnishing compressed air power for the  Brightwood Street Railway in Washington, D.C. Fig. 10 illustrates the  Norwalk direct-acting straight line air compressor, with compound air  cylinder. The chief purpose of compounding is to reduce the maximum  strain. This construction also adds to isothermal economy. The large  cylinder to the left determines the capacity of the compressor, the air  being compressed first to a low pressure (ordinarily about 30 pounds per  square inch), afterward passing through an intercooler, by which its  temperature is reduced, and then it is compressed still higher, even to  5,000 pounds per square inch if desired. The terminal strain, which is  so severe in air compressors, is here considerably reduced, as in this  case it is only equal to the area of the initial air piston multiplied  by its low air pressure.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    Economical results are attained with this compressor at low cost of  construction. The fly wheels are small, and the bearings narrow, because  the maximum strain is less, and the momentum of the piston and other  moving parts is such that most of the high initial steam power is taken  up in starting these parts and is afterward given out at the end of the  stroke, when the steam pressure is low. The strains are direct, and  expensive foundations are not required. Fig. 11 illustrates the  Ingersoll-Sergeant Compound Straight Line Air Compressor. This differs  from the one just described chiefly in that it is single-acting, while  the other is double-acting.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    By single-acting is meant that the air cylinders compress their  respective volumes of air _once_ every revolution. The air is admitted  to the large cylinder through the piston, is compressed to about 30  pounds, and on the return stroke the pressure is raised to almost any  point required, and in proportion to the diameter of the smaller  cylinder. Though single-acting, the capacity of one of these compressors  is about equal to that of the double-acting machine of the same cost of  construction. The initial air cylinder is made large enough to  correspond with the capacity of the smaller double-acting cylinder. The  strains are equalized because the area of the large cylinder multiplied  by its low pressure is exactly equal to that of the small cylinder  multiplied by its high pressure. The maximum strains are reduced  considerably below those which exist in compressors that do not compound  the air.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    The advantage of the single-acting air cylinder over the double is that  it compresses a volume of free air only once every revolution, hence  there is a better chance to cool the air during compression. The  cylinders have time to impart to the water jackets the heat produced by  compression and are kept cooler. The large air head of the initial  cylinder is jacketed, also adding to isothermal economy.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    Fig. 12 illustrates the Ingersoll-Sergeant Piston Inlet Cold Air  Compressor. This a straight line direct-acting engine, with steam and  air pistons connected to a single rod through a crosshead which connects  with two fly wheels. The strains are direct and the power and resistance  are equalized by the inertia of the crosshead, piston, rods, and fly  wheels. The Meyer's adjustable cut-off is used on the steam cylinder.  The air cylinder is provided with a tail rod tube through which all the  air is admitted into the cylinder.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--AN AUTOMATIC AND ADJUSTABLE REGULATOR AND  UNLOADING DEVICE APPLIED TO INGERSOLL-SERGEANT AIR COMPRESSORS.]    Fig. 13 illustrates an unloading device and regulator applied to the  Ingersoll-Sergeant compressor.    The purpose of this unloading device is to maintain a uniform air  pressure in the receiver and a uniform speed of engine, notwithstanding  the consumption of the air, and to do this without waste of power or  attention on the part of the engineer. A weighted valve of safety valve  pattern is attached to the air cylinder, and is connected with the air  receiver, and with a discharge valve on each end of the air cylinder,  also with a balanced throttle valve in the steam pipe. When the pressure  of the air gets above the desired point in the receiver, the valve is  lifted and the air is exhausted from behind the discharge valves, thus  letting the compressed air at full receiver pressure into the cylinder  at both ends, and balancing the engine. At the same instant the  compressed air is exhausted from the little piston connected with the  balanced steam valve and the steam is automatically throttled, so that  only enough steam is admitted to keep the engine turning around, or to  overcome the friction, no work being done.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    When the compressor is unloaded, it is evident that the function of the  air piston is merely to force the compressed air through the discharge  valves and passages from one end to the other until more compressed air  is required, this being indicated by a fall in the receiver pressure.  The weighted valve now closes and the small connecting pipes are  instantly filled with compressed air; the steam valve automatically  opens, and the compression goes on in the regular way. Another function  of this device is to prevent the compressor from stopping or getting on  the center. Direct-acting compressors are liable to center when doing  work at slow speed.    [Illustration: FIG. 15. PISTON INLET VALVE OPERATED BY THE NATURAL LAWS  OF MOMENTUM.]    Fig. 15 illustrates the Ingersoll-Sergeant Air Cylinder and Piston.
