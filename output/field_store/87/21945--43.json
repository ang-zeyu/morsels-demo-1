Solemn and cold over the marshes arose  the evening.    It became very still.    Then the last pigeon went home to the trees on the dry land in the  distance, whose shapes already had taken upon themselves a mystery  in the haze.    Then all was still again.    As the light faded and the haze deepened, mystery crept nearer from  every side.    Then the green plover came in crying, and all alighted.    And again it became still, save when one of the plover arose and flew  a little way uttering the cry of the waste.  And hushed and silent  became the earth, expecting the first star.  Then the duck came in,  and the widgeon, company by company: and all the light of day faded  out of the sky saving one red band of light.  Across the light  appeared, black and huge, the wings of a flock of geese beating up  wind to the marshes.  These, too, went down among the rushes.    Then the stars appeared and shone in the stillness, and there was  silence in the great spaces of the night.    Suddenly the bells of the cathedral in the marshes broke out,  calling to evensong.    Eight centuries ago on the edge of the marsh men had built the huge  cathedral, or it may have been seven centuries ago, or perhaps  nine--it was all one to the Wild Things.    So evensong was held, and candles lighted, and the lights through  the windows shone red and green in the water, and the sound of the  organ went roaring over the marshes.  But from the deep and perilous  places, edged with bright mosses, the Wild Things came leaping up to  dance on the reflection of the stars, and over their heads as they  danced the marsh-lights rose and fell.    The Wild Things are somewhat human in appearance, only all brown  of skin and barely two feet high.  Their ears are pointed like the  squirrel's, only far larger, and they leap to prodigious heights.  They live all day under deep pools in the loneliest marshes, but at  night they come up and dance.  Each Wild Thing has over its head a  marsh-light, which moves as the Wild Thing moves; they have no  souls, and cannot die, and are of the kith of the Elf-folk.    All night they dance over the marshes, treading upon the reflection  of the stars (for the bare surface of the water will not hold them  by itself); but when the stars begin to pale, they sink down one by  one into the pools of their home.  Or if they tarry longer, sitting  upon the rushes, their bodies fade from view as the marsh-fires pale  in the light, and by daylight none may see the Wild Things of the  kith of the Elf-folk.  Neither may any see them even at night unless  they were born, as I was, in the hour of dusk, just at the moment  when the first star appears.    Now, on the night that I tell of, a little Wild Thing had gone  drifting over the waste, till it came right up to the walls of the  cathedral and danced upon the images of the coloured saints as they  lay in the water among the reflection of the stars.  And as it leaped  in its fantastic dance, it saw through the painted windows to where  the people prayed, and heard the organ roaring over the marshes.  The  sound of the organ roared over the marshes, but the song and prayers  of the people streamed up from the cathedral's highest tower like  thin gold chains, and reached to Paradise, and up and down them went  the angels from Paradise to the people, and from the people to  Paradise again.    Then something akin to discontent troubled the Wild Thing for the  first time since the making of the marshes; and the soft grey ooze  and the chill of the deep water seemed to be not enough, nor the  first arrival from northwards of the tumultuous geese, nor the wild  rejoicing of the wings of the wildfowl when every feather sings, nor  the wonder of the calm ice that comes when the snipe depart and  beards the rushes with frost and clothes the hushed waste with a  mysterious haze where the sun goes red and low, nor even the dance  of the Wild Things in the marvellous night; and the little Wild  Thing longed to have a soul, and to go and worship God.    And when evensong was over and the lights were out, it went back  crying to its kith.    But on the next night, as soon as the images of the stars appeared  in the water, it went leaping away from star to star to the farthest  edge of the marshlands, where a great wood grew where dwelt the  Oldest of the Wild Things.    And it found the Oldest of Wild Things sitting under a tree,  sheltering itself from the moon.    And the little Wild Thing said: 'I want to have a soul to worship  God, and to know the meaning of music, and to see the inner beauty  of the marshlands and to imagine Paradise.'    And the Oldest of the Wild Things said to it: 'What have we to do  with God? We are only Wild Things, and of the kith of the Elf-folk.'    But it only answered, 'I want to have a soul.'    Then the Oldest of the Wild Things said: 'I have no soul to give  you; but if you got a soul, one day you would have to die, and if  you knew the meaning of music you would learn the meaning of sorrow,  and it is better to be a Wild Thing and not to die.'    So it went weeping away.    But they that were kin to the Elf-folk were sorry for the little  Wild Thing; and though the Wild Things cannot sorrow long, having no  souls to sorrow with, yet they felt for awhile a soreness where  their souls should be, when they saw the grief of their comrade.    So the kith of the Elf-folk went abroad by night to make a soul for  the little Wild Thing.  And they went over the marshes till they came  to the high fields among the flowers and grasses.  And there they  gathered a large piece of gossamer that the spider had laid by  twilight; and the dew was on it.    Into this dew had shone all the lights of the long banks of the  ribbed sky, as all the colours changed in the restful spaces of  evening.  And over it the marvellous night had gleamed with all its  stars.    Then the Wild Things went with their dew-bespangled gossamer down to  the edge of their home.  And there they gathered a piece of the grey  mist that lies by night over the marshlands.  And into it they put  the melody of the waste that is borne up and down the marshes in the  evening on the wings of the golden plover.  And they put into it, too,  the mournful song that the reeds are compelled to sing before the  presence of the arrogant North Wind.  Then each of the Wild Things  gave some treasured memory of the old marshes, 'For we can spare  it,' they said.  And to all this they added a few images of the stars  that they gathered out of the water.  Still the soul that the kith of  the Elf-folk were making had no life.    Then they put into it the low voices of two lovers that went walking  in the night, wandering late alone.  And after that they waited for  the dawn.  And the queenly dawn appeared, and the marsh-lights of the  Wild Things paled in the glare, and their bodies faded from view;  and still they waited by the marsh's edge.  And to them waiting came  over field and marsh, from the ground and out of the sky, the myriad  song of the birds.    This, too, the Wild Things put into the piece of haze that they had  gathered in the marshlands, and wrapped it all up in their  dew-bespangled gossamer.  Then the soul lived.    And there it lay in  the hands of the Wild Things no larger than a hedgehog; and wonderful  lights were in it, green and blue; and they changed ceaselessly,  going round and round, and in the grey midst of it was a purple  flare.    And the next night they came to the little Wild Thing and  showed her the gleaming soul.  And they said to her: 'If you must  have a soul and go and worship God, and become a mortal and die,  place this to your left breast a little above the heart, and it will  enter and you will become a human.  But if you take it you can never  be rid of it to become immortal again unless you pluck it out and  give it to another; and we will not take it, and most of the humans  have a soul already.  And if you cannot find a human without a soul  you will one day die, and your soul cannot go to Paradise, because  it was only made in the marshes.'    Far away the little Wild Thing saw  the cathedral windows alight for evensong, and the song of the  people mounting up to Paradise, and all the angels going up and  down.  So it bid farewell with tears and thanks to the Wild Things of  the kith of Elf-folk, and went leaping away towards the green dry  land, holding the soul in its hands.    And the Wild Things were sorry that it had gone, but could not be  sorry long, because they had no souls.    At the marsh's edge the little Wild Thing gazed for some moments  over the water to where the marsh-fires were leaping up and down,  and then pressed the soul against its left breast a little above the  heart.    Instantly it became a young and beautiful woman, who was cold and  frightened.  She clad herself somehow with bundles of reeds, and went  towards the lights of a house that stood close by.  And she pushed  open the door and entered, and found a farmer and a farmer's wife  sitting over their supper.    And the farmer's wife took the little Wild Thing with the soul of  the marshes up to her room, and clothed her and braided her hair,  and brought her down again, and gave her the first food that she had  ever eaten.  Then the farmer's wife asked many questions.    'Where have you come from?' she said.    'Over the marshes.'    'From what direction?' said the farmer's wife.    'South,' said the little Wild Thing with the new soul.    'But none can come over the marshes from the south,' said the  farmer's wife.    'No, they can't do that,' said the farmer.    'I lived in the marshes.'    'Who are you?' asked the farmer's wife.    'I am a Wild Thing, and have found a soul in the marshes, and we are  kin to the Elf-folk.'

SPANISH PROSODY      The basis for the following remarks on Spanish prosody is, for the  most part, E. Benot's _Prosodia Castellana y Versification_, 3 vols.,  Madrid, 1892. Other works which have been consulted are the _Ortologia  y Arte Metrica_ of A. Bello, published in his _Obras Completas_, vol.  4, Madrid, 1890; Rengifo's _Arte Poetica Espanola_, Barcelona, 1759;  J. D. M. Ford's \"Notes on Spanish Prosody,\" in _A Spanish Anthology_,  published by Silver, Burdett & Co., 1901; and a _Tratado de Literatura  Preceptiva_, by D. Saturnino Milego e Inglada, published at Toledo in  1887.    Spanish versification has nothing to do with the quantity of vowels  (whether long or short), which was the basis of Latin prosody.    There are four important elements in Spanish versification. Of these  four elements two are essential, and the other two are usually  present.    The essential elements, without which Spanish verse cannot exist,  are--      I. A determined number of syllables per line.      II. A rhythmic distribution of the accents in the line.    The additional elements usually present in Spanish poetical  compositions are--      III. Caesural pauses.      IV. Rhyme.      I. SYLLABIFICATION    Consonants.--In verse the same rules hold as in prose for the  distribution of consonants in syllables.    Vowels.--If there were but one vowel in a syllable, Spanish  syllabification would be easy; but sometimes two or more vowels are  found either between consonants, or at the beginning or at the end of  a word. When such is the case, intricacies arise, for sometimes the  contiguous vowels are pronounced in a single syllable and sometimes  they are divided into separate syllables.    The contiguous vowels may belong to a single word (see A); or they may  be the final vowel or vowels of one word and the initial vowel or  vowels of a following word or words (see B).    A. _Diphthongization_,--If two contiguous vowels of a single word are  pronounced in but one syllable they form a diphthong, e.g. _hu^esped_.    B. _Synalepha_.--If two or more contiguous vowels belonging to two or  more words are pronounced in a single syllable, they form synalepha.      Ex. _Yo se^un himno gigante y^extrano_, p. 164, I, l. 1.    Since Spanish verse depends upon a determined number of syllables per  line, _diphthongization_ and _synalepha_ are important factors in  versification.      A. DIPHTHONGIZATION    Mute _h_ between vowels is disregarded and does not prevent  diphthongization, e.g. _a^h^ora_, _re^h^usar_.    The separation of two vowels that are usually united in one syllable  is called _diaeresis_, e.g. _vi|oleta_.    The union in one syllable of two vowels that are usually in separate  syllables is called _synaeresis_, e.g. _ca^os_.    1. THE TWENTY-FIVE POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OP VOWELS IN DIPHTHONGS    The vowels may be divided into strong vowels (a, e, o) and weak vowels  (i, u). For purposes of versification y as a vowel may be treated as  i. The five vowels (a, e, o, i, u) taken in pairs may form diphthongs  in twenty-five possible combinations, as follows:    a. Pairs of two weak vowels: ui, iu, ii, uu.    b. Pairs of two strong vowels:      { ae, ao, aa,    { ea, eo, ee,    { oa, oe, oo.    c. Pairs of a strong vowel plus a weak vowel      { ai, au,    { ei, eu,    { oi, ou.    d. Pairs of a weak vowel plus a strong vowel      { ua, ue, uo,    { ia, ie, io.    NOTE: In diphthongs a dominates o and e; and o dominates e. Any strong  vowel dominates a weak one.      Ex. In Bo^abdil, if a were not dominant, the diphthong would be    dissolved.      2. DIPHTHONGS AND WORD ACCENTUATION    There are with regard to accent three possible conditions under which  two contiguous vowels may occur within a word.    a. The contiguous vowels may precede the accented syllable.    b. One of the contiguous vowels may be accented.    c. The contiguous vowels may come after the accented syllable.      a. Two contiguous vowels before the accent.    (1) Of the twenty-five possible combinations all are admissible in  diphthongs in a syllable preceding the accented syllable.      Ex. _Habra po^esta_, p. 165, IV, l. 4.    (a) Diaeresis may be employed to dissolve the diphthong.      Ex. _Sobre una vi|oleta_, p. 169, XIII, l. 8.    b. One of two contiguous vowels accented.
