Only Miss Ophelia  and the doctor sighed and shook their heads. And little Eva herself  knew; but she was not troubled. She knew she was going to God.    'Papa' she said one day, 'there are some things I want to say to you. I  want to say them now while I am able.'    She seated herself on his knee, and laid her head on his shoulder.    'It is all no use, papa, to keep it to myself any longer. The time is  coming when I am going to leave you. I am going, never to come back',  and Eva sobbed.    'Eva, darling, don't say such things; you are better you know.'    'No, papa, I am not any better. I know it quite well, and I am going  soon.'    'And I want to go,' she went on, 'only I don't want to leave you--it  almost breaks my heart.'    'Don't, Eva, don't talk so. What makes you so sad?'    'I feel sad for our poor people. I wish, papa, they were all free. Isn't  there any way to have all slaves made free?'    'That is a difficult question, dearest. There is no doubt that this way  is a very bad one. A great many people think so. I do myself. I wish  there was not a slave in the land. But then, I don't know what is to be  done about it.'    'Papa, you are such a good man, and so noble and kind. Couldn't you go  all around and try and persuade people to do right about this? When I am  dead, papa, then you will think of me, and do it for my sake.'    'When you are dead, Eva! Oh, child, don't talk to me so.'    'Promise me at least, father, that Tom shall have his freedom, as soon  as I am gone.'    'Yes, dear, I will do anything you wish. Only don't talk so.'    Miss Ophelia and Eva had been to church together. Miss Ophelia had gone  to her room to take off her bonnet, while Eva talked to her father.    Suddenly Mr. St. Clare and his little girl heard a great noise coming  from Miss Ophelia's room. A minute later she appeared, dragging Topsy  behind her.    'Come out here' she was saying. 'I will tell your master.'    'What is the matter now?' asked Mr. St. Clare.    'The matter is that I cannot be plagued with this child any longer' said  Miss Ophelia. 'It is past all bearing. Here, I locked her up, and gave  her a hymn to learn. What does she do, but spy out where I put my key.  She has gone to my wardrobe, taken a bonnet-trimming, and cut it all to  pieces to make dolls' jackets! I never saw anything like it in my life.'    [Illustration]    'I don't know what to do' she went on; 'I have taught and taught. I have  talked till I'm tired. I've whipped her. I've punished her in every way  I can think of, and still she is as naughty as she was at first.'    'Come here, Topsy, you monkey,' said Mr. St. Clare.    Topsy came, her hard, round eyes glittering and blinking, half in fear,  half in mischief.    'What makes you behave so?' said Mr. St. Clare, who could not help being  amused at her funny expression.    'Spects it's my wicked heart; Miss Feely says so.'    'Don't you see how much Miss Ophelia has done for you? She says she has  done everything she can think of.'    'Lor', yes, mas'r! Old missis used to say so, too. She whipped me a heap  harder, and used to pull my hair and knock my head agin the door. But it  didn't do me no good. I 'spect if they is to pull every hair out o' my  head it wouldn't do no good neither. I's so wicked. Laws! I's nothin'  but a nigger noways.'    'I shall have to give her up,' said Miss Ophelia. 'I can't have that  trouble any longer.'    Eva had stood silent, listening. Now she took Topsy by the hand, and led  her into a little room close by.    'What makes you so naughty, Topsy?' she said, with tears in her eyes.  'Why don't you try to be good? Don't you love anybody, Topsy?'    'Dunno nothin' 'bout love. I love candy, that's all.'    'But you love your father and mother?'    'Never had none, ye know. I telled ye that, Miss Eva.'    'Oh, I forgot,' said Eva sadly. 'But hadn't you any brother, or sister  or aunt, or--'    'No, none on 'em. Never had nothin' nor nobody.'    'But, Topsy, if you would only try to be good you might--'    'Couldn't never be nothin' but a nigger, if I was ever so good,' said  Topsy. 'If I could be skinned, and come white, I'd try then.'    'But people can love you, if you are black, Topsy. Miss Ophelia would  love you if you were good.'    Topsy laughed scornfully.    'Don't you think so?' said Eva.    'No. She can't bear me, 'cause I'm a nigger. She'd as soon have a toad  touch her. There can't nobody love niggers, and niggers can't do  nothin'. I don't care,' and Topsy began whistling to show that she  didn't.    'Oh, Topsy! I love you,' said Eva, laying her little, thin hand on  Topsy's shoulder. 'I love you, because you haven't had any mother, or  father, or friends; because you have been a poor, ill-used child. I love  you, and I want you to be good. It makes me sorry to have you so  naughty. I wish you would try to be good for my sake, because I'm going  to die soon. I shan't be here very long.'    Topsy's round, bright eyes grew suddenly dim with tears. She did believe  at last that it was possible for some one to love her. She laid her head  down between her knees and wept and sobbed.    'Poor Topsy,' said Eva gently.    [Illustration]    'Oh, Miss Eva, dear Miss Eva,' cried the poor little black child, 'I  will try, I will try. I never did care nothin' about it before.'          CHAPTER XVI      EVA'S LAST GOOD-BYE      It soon became quite plain to everybody that Eva was very ill indeed.  She never ran about and played now, but spent most of the day lying on  the sofa in her own pretty room.    Every one loved her, and tried to do things for her. Even naughty little  Topsy used to bring her flowers, and try to be good for her sake.    Uncle Tom was a great deal in Eva's room. She used to get very restless,  and then she liked to be carried about. He was so big and strong that he  could do it very easily. He would walk about with her under the  orange-trees in the garden, or sitting down on some of their old seats,  would sing their favorite hymns.    He loved to do it, and could not bear to be long away from his little  mistress. He gave up sleeping in his bed, and lay all night on the mat  outside her door.    One day Eva made her aunt cut off a lot of her beautiful hair. Then she  called all the slaves together, said good-bye to them, and gave them  each a curl of her hair as a keepsake. They all cried very much, and  said they would never forget her, and would try to be good for her sake.    A few nights later Miss Ophelia came quickly to Tom, as he lay on the  mat outside Eva's door. 'Go, Tom,' she said, 'go as fast as you can for  the doctor.'    Tom ran. But in the morning little Eva lay on her bed, cold and white,  with closed eyes and folded hands.    She had gone to God.    Mr. St. Clare was very, very unhappy for a long time after Eva died. He  had loved her so much, that now his life seemed quite empty without her.    He did not forget his promise to her about Tom. He went to his lawyer,  and told him to begin writing out the papers that would make Tom free.  It took some time to make a slave free.    'Well, Tom,' said Mr. St. Clare the day after he had spoken to his  Lawyer, 'I'm going to make a free man of you. So have your trunk packed  and get ready to set out for home.'    Joy shone in Uncle Tom's face. 'Bless the Lord,' he said, raising his  hands to heaven.    Mr. St. Clare felt rather hurt. He did not like Tom to be so glad to  leave him.    'You haven't had such a very bad time here that you need be in such  rapture, Tom,' he said.    'No, no, mas'r! tan't that. It's bein' a free man! That's what I'm joyin'  for.'    'Why, Tom, don't you think that you are really better off as you are?'    'No, indeed, Mas'r St. Clare,' said Tom, very decidedly; 'no, indeed.'    'But, Tom, you couldn't possibly have earned by your work such clothes  and such nice, comfortable rooms and good food as I have given you.'    'I knows all that, Mas'r St. Clare. Mas'r has been too good. But, mas'r,  I'd rather have poor clothes, poor house, poor everything, and have 'em  mine than have the best, and have 'em any man's else. I had so, mas'r. I  thinks it's nature, mas'r.'    'I suppose so, Tom. You will be going off and leaving me, in a month or  two,' he said, rather discontentedly. 'Though why you shouldn't, I don't  know,' he added, in a gayer voice.    [Illustration]    'Not while mas'r is in trouble,' said Tom. 'I'll stay with mas'r as long  as he wants me--so as I can be of any use.'    'Not while I am in trouble, Tom?' said Mr. St. Clare, looking sadly out  of the window. 'And when will my trouble be over?' Then half-smiling he  turned from the window, and laid his hand on Tom's shoulder. 'Ah, Tom,  you soft, silly boy,' he said. 'I won't keep you. Go home to your wife  and children, and give them all my love.'    'Cousin,' said Miss Ophelia, coming into the room, 'I want to speak to  you about Topsy.'    'What has she been doing now?'    [Illustration]    'Nothing; she is a much better girl than she used to be. But I want to  ask you, whose is she--yours or mine?'    'Why yours, of course; I gave her to you,' said Mr. St. Clare.    'But not by law. There is no use my trying to make this child a  Christian, unless I can be quite sure that she will not be sold as a  slave again. If you are really willing I should have her, I want you to  give me a paper saying she is mine.'    'But you think it is wicked to keep slaves. Now you want to have one of  your own. Oh! shocking, cousin,' said Mr. St. Clare, who loved to tease.    'Nonsense! I only want to have her, so that I can set her free.'    'Very well,' said Mr. St. Clare, 'I will write the paper for you.' Then  he sat down and began to read.    'But I want it done now,' said Miss Ophelia.    'Why are you in such a hurry?'    'Because now is the only time there ever is to do a thing in,' said Miss  Ophelia.

Imitation of the Master in all things even to the  stigmata, is the characteristic feature of mediaeval Christianity. Nor  is the whole of the so-called Sunna obedience anything more than the  imitation of Muhammed which seeks to repeat the smallest details of  his life. The infinite importance attached by Islam to the Sunna seems  to me to have originated in Christian influence. The development of it  betrays original features, but the fundamental principle is Christian,  as all the leading ideas of Islam are Christian, in the sense of the  term as paraphrased above. Imitation of Christ in the first instance,  attempts to repeat his poverty and renunciation of personal property:  this is the great Christian ideal. Muhammed was neither poor nor  without possessions: at the end of his life he had become a prince and  had directly stated that property was a gift from God. In spite of  that his successors praise poverty and their praises were the best of  evidence that they were influenced not by the prophet himself but by  Christianity. While the traditions are full of the praises of poverty  and the dangers of wealth, assertions in praise of wealth also  occur, for the reason that the pure Muhammedan ideas opposed to  Christianity retained a certain influence. J. Goldziher has published  an interesting study showing how many words borrowed from this source  occur in the written Muhammedan traditions: an almost complete  version of the Lord's Prayer is quoted. Even the idea of love towards  enemies, which would have been unintelligible to Muhammed, made its  way into the traditions: \"the most virtuous of acts is to seek out him  who rejects thee, to give to him that despises thee and to pardon him  that oppresses thee.\" The Gospel precept to do unto others as we would  they should do unto us (Matt. vii. 12, Luke vi. 31) is to be found in  the Arab traditions, and many similar points of contact may be  noticed. A man's \"neighbour\" has ever been, despite the teaching of  Jesus, to the Christian and to the Muhammedan, his co-religionist. The  whole department of Muhammedan ethics has thus been subjected to  strong Christian influence.    Naturally this ecclesiasticism which dominated the whole of life, was  bound to assert itself in state organisation. An abhorrence of the  state, so far as it was independent of religion, a feeling unknown in  the ancient world, pervades both Christianity and Muhammedanism,  Christianity first struggled to secure recognition in the state and  afterwards fought with the state for predominance. Islam and the state  were at first identical: in its spiritual leaders it was soon  separated from the state. Its idea of a divine polity was elaborated  to the smallest details, but remained a theory which never became  practice. Yet this ideal retained such strength that every Muhammedan  usurper was careful to secure his investiture by the Caliph, the  nominal leader of this ecclesiastical state, even if force were  necessary to attain his object. For instance, Saladin was absolutely  independent of the nominal Caliph in Bagdad, but could not feel that  his position was secure until he had obtained his sultan's patent from  the Caliph. Only then did his supremacy rest upon a religious basis  and he was not regarded by popular opinion as a legitimate monarch  until this ceremony had been performed. This theory corresponds with  constitutional ideals essentially Christian. \"The tyranny,\" wrote  Innocent IV to the Emperor Frederick II, \"which was once generally  exercised throughout the world, was resigned into the hands of the  Church by Constantine, who then received as an honourable gift from  the proper source that which he had formerly held and exercised  unrighteously.\" The long struggle between Church and State in this  matter is well known. In this struggle the rising power of Islam had  adopted a similar attitude. The great abhorrence of a secular  \"monarchy\" in opposition to a religious caliphate, as expressed both  by the dicta of tradition and by the Abbassid historians, was  inspired, in my opinion, by Christian dislike of a divorce between  Church and State. The phenomenon might be explained without reference  to external influence, but if the whole process be considered in  connection, Christian influence seems more than probable.    A similar attitude was also assumed by either religion towards the  facts of economic life. In either case the religious point of view is  characteristic. The reaction against the tendency to condemn secular  life is certainly stronger in Islam, but is also apparent in  Christianity. Thomas Aquinas directly stigmatises trade as a  disgraceful means of gain, because the exchange of wares does not  necessitate labour or the satisfaction of necessary wants: Muhammedan  tradition says, \"The pious merchant is a pioneer on the road of God.\"  \"The first to enter Paradise is the honourable merchant.\" Here the  solution given to the problem differs in either case, but in Christian  practice, opposition was also obvious. Common to both religions is the  condemnation of the exaction of interest and monetary speculation,  which the middle ages regarded as usury. Islam, as usual, gives this  Christian idea the form of a saying enounced by Muhammed: \"He who  speculates in grain for forty days, grinds and bakes it and gives it  to the poor, makes an offering unacceptable to God.\" \"He who raises  prices to Muslims (by speculation) will be cast head downwards by God  into the hottest fire of hell.\" Many similar traditions fulminate  against usury in the widest sense of the word. These prohibitions were  circumvented in practice by deed of gift and exchange, but none the  less the free development of commercial enterprise was hampered by  these fetters which modern civilisation first broke. Enterprise was  thus confined to agriculture under these circumstances both for  Christianity and Islam, and economic life in either case became  \"mediaeval\" in outward appearance.    Methods of making profit without a proportional expenditure of labour  were the particular objects of this aversion. Manual labour was highly  esteemed both in the East and West. A man's first duty was to support  himself by the work of his own hands, a duty proclaimed, as we know,  from the apostolic age onwards. So far as Islam is concerned, this  view may be illustrated by the following utterances: \"The best of  deeds is the gain of that which is lawful\": \"the best gain is made by  sale within lawful limits and by manual labour.\" \"The most precious  gain is that made by manual labour; that which a man thus earns and  gives to himself, his people, his sons and his servants, is as  meritorious as alms.\" Thus practical work is made incumbent upon the  believer, and the extent to which manufacture flourished in East and  West during the middle ages is well known.    A similar affinity is apparent as regards ideas upon social position  and occupation. Before God man is but a slave: even the mighty Caliphs  themselves, even those who were stigmatised by posterity as secular  monarchs, included in their official titles the designation, \"slave of  God.\" This theory was carried out into the smallest details of life,  even into those which modern observers would consider as unconcerned  with religion. Thus at meals the Muslim was not allowed to recline at  table, an ancient custom which the upper classes had followed for  centuries: he must sit, \"as a slave,\" according to the letter of the  law. All are alike slaves, for the reason that they are believers:  hence the humiliation of those whom chance has exalted is thought  desirable. This idealism is undoubtedly more deeply rooted in the  popular consciousness of the East than of the West. In the East great  social distinctions occur; but while religion recognises them, it  forbids insistence upon them.    As especially distinctive of social work in either religion we might  be inclined to regard the unparalleled extent of organizations for the  care of the poor, for widows and orphans, for the old, infirm and  sick, the public hospitals and almshouses and religious foundations in  the widest sense of the term; but the object of these activities was  not primarily social nor were they undertaken to make life easier for  the poor: religious selfishness was the leading motive, the desire to  purify self by good works and to secure the right to pre-eminence in  heaven. \"For the salvation of my soul and for everlasting reward\" is  the formula of many a Christian foundation deed. Very similar  expressions of hope for eternal reward occur in Muhammedan deeds of  gift. A foundation inscription on a mosque, published by E. Littmann,  is stated in terms the purport of which is unmistakable. \"This has  been built by N or M: may a house be built for him in Paradise (in  return).\" Here again, the idea of the house in Paradise is borrowed  from Christian ideas.    We have already observed that in Islam the smallest trivialities of  daily life become matters of religious import. The fact is especially  apparent in a wide department of personal conduct. Islam certainly  went to further extremes than Christianity in this matter, but these  customs are clearly only further developments of Christian  regulations. The call to simplicity of food and dress has already been  mentioned. But even the simplest food was never to be taken before  thanks had been given to God: grace was never to be omitted either  before or after meals. Divine ordinances also regulated the manner of  eating. The prophet said, \"With one finger the devils eat, with two  the Titans of antiquity and with three fingers the prophets.\" The  application of the saying is obvious. Similar sayings prescribe the  mode of handling dishes and behaviour at a common meal, if the  blessing of God is to be secured. There seems to be a Christian touch  in one of these rules which"]]]
