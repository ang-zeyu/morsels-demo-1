He knew that  they could not see him, because the hat of darkness hid him; and yet he  trembled as he sank down near them, so terrible were those brazen claws.    Two of the Gorgons were foul as swine, and lay sleeping heavily, as swine  sleep, with their mighty wings outspread; but Medusa tossed to and fro  restlessly, and as she tossed Perseus pitied her, she looked so fair and  sad.  Her plumage was like the rainbow, and her face was like the face of  a nymph, only her eyebrows were knit, and her lips clenched, with  everlasting care and pain; and her long neck gleamed so white in the  mirror that Perseus had not the heart to strike, and said, 'Ah, that it  had been either of her sisters!'    But as he looked, from among her tresses the vipers' heads awoke, and  peeped up with their bright dry eyes, and showed their fangs, and hissed;  and Medusa, as she tossed, threw back her wings and showed her brazen  claws; and Perseus saw that, for all her beauty, she was as foul and  venomous as the rest.    Then he came down and stepped to her boldly, and looked steadfastly on  his mirror, and struck with Herpe stoutly once; and he did not need to  strike again.    Then he wrapped the head in the goat-skin, turning away his eyes, and  sprang into the air aloft, faster than he ever sprang before.    For Medusa's wings and talons rattled as she sank dead upon the rocks;  and her two foul sisters woke, and saw her lying dead.    Into the air they sprang yelling and looked for him who had done the  deed.  Thrice they swung round and round, like hawks who beat for a  partridge; and thrice they snuffed round and round, like hounds who draw  upon a deer.  At last they struck upon the scent of the blood, and they  checked for a moment to make sure; and then on they rushed with a fearful  howl, while the wind rattled hoarse in their wings.    On they rushed, sweeping and flapping, like eagles after a hare; and  Perseus' blood ran cold, for all his courage, as he saw them come howling  on his track; and he cried, 'Bear me well now, brave sandals, for the  hounds of Death are at my heels!'    And well the brave sandals bore him, aloft through cloud and sunshine,  across the shoreless sea; and fast followed the hounds of Death, as the  roar of their wings came down the wind.  But the roar came down fainter  and fainter, and the howl of their voices died away; for the sandals were  too swift, even for Gorgons, and by nightfall they were far behind, two  black specks in the southern sky, till the sun sank and he saw them no  more.    Then he came again to Atlas, and the garden of the Nymphs; and when the  giant heard him coming he groaned, and said, 'Fulfil thy promise to me.'  Then Perseus held up to him the Gorgon's head, and he had rest from all  his toil; for he became a crag of stone, which sleeps for ever far above  the clouds.    Then he thanked the Nymphs, and asked them, 'By what road shall I go  homeward again, for I wandered far round in coming hither?'    And they wept and cried, 'Go home no more, but stay and play with us, the  lonely maidens, who dwell for ever far away from Gods and men.'    But he refused, and they told him his road, and said, 'Take with you this  magic fruit, which, if you eat once, you will not hunger for seven days.  For you must go eastward and eastward ever, over the doleful Lybian  shore, which Poseidon gave to Father Zeus, when he burst open the  Bosphorus and the Hellespont, and drowned the fair Lectonian land.  And  Zeus took that land in exchange, a fair bargain, much bad ground for a  little good, and to this day it lies waste and desert with shingle, and  rock, and sand.'    Then they kissed Perseus, and wept over him, and he leapt down the  mountain, and went on, lessening and lessening like a sea-gull, away and  out to sea.        PART IV  HOW PERSEUS CAME TO THE AETHIOPS      So Perseus flitted onward to the north-east, over many a league of sea,  till he came to the rolling sand-hills and the dreary Lybian shore.    And he flitted on across the desert: over rock-ledges, and banks of  shingle, and level wastes of sand, and shell-drifts bleaching in the  sunshine, and the skeletons of great sea-monsters, and dead bones of  ancient giants, strewn up and down upon the old sea-floor.  And as he  went the blood-drops fell to the earth from the Gorgon's head, and became  poisonous asps and adders, which breed in the desert to this day.    Over the sands he went,--he never knew how far or how long, feeding on  the fruit which the Nymphs had given him, till he saw the hills of the  Psylli, and the Dwarfs who fought with cranes.  Their spears were of  reeds and rushes, and their houses of the egg-shells of the cranes; and  Perseus laughed, and went his way to the north-east, hoping all day long  to see the blue Mediterranean sparkling, that he might fly across it to  his home.    But now came down a mighty wind, and swept him back southward toward the  desert.  All day long he strove against it; but even the winged sandals  could not prevail.  So he was forced to float down the wind all night;  and when the morning dawned there was nothing to be seen, save the same  old hateful waste of sand.    And out of the north the sandstorms rushed upon him, blood-red pillars  and wreaths, blotting out the noonday sun; and Perseus fled before them,  lest he should be choked by the burning dust.  At last the gale fell  calm, and he tried to go northward again; but again came down the  sandstorms, and swept him back into the waste, and then all was calm and  cloudless as before.  Seven days he strove against the storms, and seven  days he was driven back, till he was spent with thirst and hunger, and  his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth.  Here and there he fancied  that he saw a fair lake, and the sunbeams shining on the water; but when  he came to it it vanished at his feet, and there was nought but burning  sand.  And if he had not been of the race of the Immortals, he would have  perished in the waste; but his life was strong within him, because it was  more than man's.    Then he cried to Athene, and said--    'Oh, fair and pure, if thou hearest me, wilt thou leave me here to die of  drought?  I have brought thee the Gorgon's head at thy bidding, and  hitherto thou hast prospered my journey; dost thou desert me at the last?  Else why will not these immortal sandals prevail, even against the desert  storms?  Shall I never see my mother more, and the blue ripple round  Seriphos, and the sunny hills of Hellas?'    So he prayed; and after he had prayed there was a great silence.    The heaven was still above his head, and the sand was still beneath his  feet; and Perseus looked up, but there was nothing but the blinding sun  in the blinding blue; and round him, but there was nothing but the  blinding sand.    And Perseus stood still a while, and waited, and said, 'Surely I am not  here without the will of the Immortals, for Athene will not lie.  Were  not these sandals to lead me in the right road?  Then the road in which I  have tried to go must be a wrong road.'    Then suddenly his ears were opened, and he heard the sound of running  water.    And at that his heart was lifted up, though he scarcely dare believe his  ears; and weary as he was, he hurried forward, though he could scarcely  stand upright; and within a bowshot of him was a glen in the sand, and  marble rocks, and date-trees, and a lawn of gay green grass.  And through  the lawn a streamlet sparkled and wandered out beyond the trees, and  vanished in the sand.    The water trickled among the rocks, and a pleasant breeze rustled in the  dry date-branches and Perseus laughed for joy, and leapt down the cliff,  and drank of the cool water, and ate of the dates, and slept upon the  turf, and leapt up and went forward again: but not toward the north this  time; for he said, 'Surely Athene hath sent me hither, and will not have  me go homeward yet.  What if there be another noble deed to be done,  before I see the sunny hills of Hellas?'    So he went east, and east for ever, by fresh oases and fountains,  date-palms, and lawns of grass, till he saw before him a mighty  mountain-wall, all rose-red in the setting sun.    Then he towered in the air like an eagle, for his limbs were strong  again; and he flew all night across the mountain till the day began to  dawn, and rosy-fingered Eos came blushing up the sky.  And then, behold,  beneath him was the long green garden of Egypt and the shining stream of  Nile.    And he saw cities walled up to heaven, and temples, and obelisks, and  pyramids, and giant Gods of stone.  And he came down amid fields of  barley, and flax, and millet, and clambering gourds; and saw the people  coming out of the gates of a great city, and setting to work, each in his  place, among the water-courses, parting the streams among the plants  cunningly with their feet, according to the wisdom of the Egyptians.  But  when they saw him they all stopped their work, and gathered round him,  and cried--    'Who art thou, fair youth? and what bearest thou beneath thy goat-skin  there?  Surely thou art one of the Immortals; for thy skin is white like  ivory, and ours is red like clay.  Thy hair is like threads of gold, and  ours is black and curled.  Surely thou art one of the Immortals;' and  they would have worshipped him then and there; but Perseus said--    'I am not one of the Immortals; but I am a hero of the Hellens.  And I  have slain the Gorgon in the wilderness, and bear her head with me.  Give  me food, therefore, that I may go forward and finish my work.'    Then they gave him food, and fruit, and wine; but they would not let him  go.  And when the news came into the city that the Gorgon was slain, the  priests came out to meet him, and the maidens, with songs and dances, and  timbrels and harps; and they would have brought him to their temple and  to their king; but Perseus put on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6782"],[0,"The Robbers (#6)"],[1,"  coolly flings him against the wall; Moor drops the letter and rushes  out. A general sensation.)    ROLLER. (calling after him). Moor! where are you going? What's the  matter?    GRIMM. What ails him? What has he been doing? He is as pale as death.    SCHW. He must have got strange news. Just let us see!    ROLLER. (picks up the letter from the ground, and reads). \"Unfortunate  brother!\"--a pleasant beginning--\"I have only briefly to inform you that  you have nothing more to hope for. You may go, your father directs me  to tell you, wherever your own vicious propensities lead. Nor are you  to entertain, he says, any hope of ever gaining pardon by weeping at his  feet, unless you are prepared to fare upon bread and water in the lowest  dungeon of his castle until your hair shall outgrow eagles' feathers,  and your nails the talons of a vulture. These are his very words. He  commands me to close the letter. Farewell forever! I pity you.                             \"FRANCIS VON MOOR\"      SCHW. A most amiable and loving brother, in good truth! And the  scoundrel's name is Francis.    SPIEGEL. (slinking forward). Bread and water! Is that it? A  temperate diet! But I have made a better provision for you. Did I not  say that I should have to think for you all at last?    SCHWEIT. What does the blockhead say! The jackass is going to think  for us all!    SPIEGEL. Cowards, cripples, lame dogs are ye all if you have not  courage enough to venture upon something great.    ROLLER. Well, of course, so we should be, you are right; but will your  proposed scheme get us out of this devil of a scrape? eh?    SPIEGEL. (with a proud laugh). Poor thing! Get us out of this scrape?  Ha, ha, ha! Get us out of the scrape!--and is that all your thimbleful  of brain can reach? And with that you trot your mare back to the  stable? Spiegelberg would have been a miserable bungler indeed if that  were the extent of his aim. Heroes, I tell you, barons, princes, gods,  it will make of you.    RAZ. That's pretty well for one bout, truly! But no doubt it is some  neck-breaking piece of business; it will cost a head or so at the least.    SPIEGEL. It wants nothing but courage; as to the headwork, I take that  entirely upon myself. Courage, I say, Schweitzer! Courage, Roller!  Grimm! Razman! Schufterle! Courage!    SCHW. Courage! If that is all, I have courage enough to walk through  hell barefoot.    SCHUFT. And I courage enough to fight the very devil himself under the  open gallows for the rescue of any poor sinner.    SPIEGEL. That's just what it should be! If ye have courage, let any  one of you step forward and say he has still something to lose, and not  everything to gain?    SCHW. Verily, I should have a good deal to lose, if I were to lose all  that I have yet to win!    PAZ. Yes, by Jove! and I much to win, if I could win all that I have  not got to lose.    SCHUFT. Were I to lose what I carry on my back on trust I should at any  rate have nothing to lose on the morrow.    SPIEGEL. Very well then! (He takes his place in the middle of them,  and says in solemn adjuration)--if but a drop of the heroic blood of the  ancient Germans still flow in your veins--come! We will fix our abode  in the Bohemian forests, draw together a band of robbers, and--What are  you gaping at? Has your slender stock of courage oozed out already?    ROLLER. You are not the first rogue by many that has defied the  gallows;--and yet what other choice have we?    SPIEGEL. Choice? You have no choice. Do you want to lie rotting in  the debtor's jail and beat hemp till you are bailed by the last trumpet?  Would you toil with pick-axe and spade for a morsel of dry bread? or  earn a pitiful alms by singing doleful ditties under people's windows?  Or will you be sworn at the drumhead--and then comes the question,  whether anybody would trust your hang-dog visages--and so under the  splenetic humor of some despotic sergeant serve your time of purgatory  in advance? Would you like to run the gauntlet to the beat of the drum?  or be doomed to drag after you, like a galley-slave, the whole iron  store of Vulcan? Behold your choice. You have before you the complete  catalogue of all that you may choose from!    ROLLER. Spiegelberg is not altogether wrong! I, too, have been  concocting plans, but they come much to the same thing. How would it  be, thought I, were we to club our wits together, and dish up a  pocketbook, or an almanac, or something of that sort, and write reviews  at a penny a line, as is now the fashion?    SCHUFT. The devil's in you! you are pretty nearly hitting on my own  schemes. I have been thinking to myself how would it answer were I to  turn Methodist, and hold weekly prayer-meetings?    GRIMM. Capital! and, if that fails, turn atheist! We might fall foul of  the four Gospels, get our book burned by the hangman, and then it would  sell at a prodigious rate.    RAZ. Or we might take the field to cure a fashionable ailment. I know  a quack doctor who has built himself a house with nothing but mercury,  as the motto over his door implies.    SCHWEIT. (rises and holds out his hand to Spiegelberg). Spiegelberg,  thou art a great man! or else a blind hog has by chance found an acorn.    SCHW. Excellent schemes! Honorable professions! How great minds  sympathize! All that seems wanting to complete the list is that we  should turn pimps and bawds.    SPIEGEL. Pooh! Pooh! Nonsense. And what is to prevent our combining  most of these occupations in one person? My plan will exalt you the  most, and it holds out glory and immortality into the bargain.  Remember, too, ye sorry varlets, and it is a matter worthy of  consideration: one's fame hereafter--the sweet thought of immortality--    ROLLER. And that at the very head of the muster-roll of honorable  names! You are a master of eloquence, Spiegelberg, when the question is  how to convert an honest man into a scoundrel. But does any one know  what has become of Moor?    SPIEGEL. Honest, say you? Do you think you'll be less honest then than  you are now? What do you call honest? To relieve rich misers of half  of those cares which only scare golden sleep from their eyelids; to  force hoarded coin into circulation; to restore the equalization of  property; in one word, to bring back the golden age; to relieve  Providence of many a burdensome pensioner, and so save it the trouble of  sending war, pestilence, famine, and above all, doctors--that is what I  call honesty, d'ye see; that's what I call being a worthy instrument in  the hand of Providence,--and then, at every meal you eat, to have the  sweet reflection: this is what thy own ingenuity, thy lion boldness, thy  night watchings, have procured for thee--to command the respect both of  great and small!    ROLLER. And at last to mount towards heaven in the living body, and in  spite of wind and storm, in spite of the greedy maw of old father Time,  to be hovering beneath the sun and moon and all the stars of the  firmament, where even the unreasoning birds of heaven, attracted by  noble instinct, chant their seraphic music, and angels with tails hold  their most holy councils? Don't you see? And, while monarchs and  potentates become a prey to moths and worms, to have the honor of  receiving visits from the royal bird of Jove. Moritz, Moritz, Moritz!  beware of the three-legged beast.*       *[The gallows, which in Germany is formed of three posts.]    SPIEGEL. And does that fright thee, craven-heart? Has not many a  universal genius, who might have reformed the world, rotted upon the  gallows? And does not the renown of such a man live for hundreds and  thousands of years, whereas many a king and elector would be passed over  in history, were not historians obliged to give him a niche to complete  the line of succession, or that the mention of him did not swell the  volume a few octavo pages, for which he counts upon hard cash from the  publisher. And when the wayfarer sees you swinging to and fro in the  breeze he will mutter to himself, \"That fellow's brains had no water in  them, I'll warrant me,\" and then groan over the hardship of the times.    SCHWEIT. (slaps him on the shoulder). Well said, Spiegelberg! Well  said! Why the devil do we stand here hesitating?    SCHW. And suppose it is called disgrace--what then? Cannot one, in  case of need, always carry a small powder about one, which quietly  smooths the weary traveller's passage across the Styx, where no  cock-crowing will disturb his rest? No, brother Moritz! Your scheme is  good; so at least says my creed.    SCHUFT. Zounds! and mine too! Spiegelberg, I am your recruit.    RAZ. Like a second Orpheus, Spiegelberg, you have charmed to sleep that  howling beast, conscience! Take me as I stand, I am yours entirely!    GRIMMM. _Si omnes consentiunt ego non dissentio_;* mind, without a  comma. There is an auction going on in my head--methodists--quack  doctors--reviewers--rogues;--the highest bidder has me. Here is my  hand, Moritz!       *[The joke is explained by placing a comma after non.]    ROLLER. And you too, Schweitzer? (he gives his right hand to  SPIEGELBERG). Thus I consign my soul to the devil.    SPIEGEL. And your name to the stars! What does it signify where the  soul goes to? If crowds of _avantcouriers_ give notice of our descent  that the devils may put on their holiday gear, wipe the accumulated soot  of a thousand years from their eyelashes, and myriads of horned heads  pop up from the smoking mouth of their sulphurous chimneys to welcome  our arrival! 'Up, comrades! (leaping up). Up! What in the world is  equal to this ecstacy of delight? Come along, comrades!    ROLLER. Gently, gently! Where are you going? Every beast must have a  head, boys!    SPIEGEL. (With bitterness). What is that incubus preaching about? Was  not the head already there before a single limb began to move? Follow  me, comrades!    ROLLER. Gently, I say! even liberty must have its master. Rome and  Sparta"]]]
