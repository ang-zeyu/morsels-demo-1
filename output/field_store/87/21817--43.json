That daring scoundrel was not satisfied with having escaped a great  danger scot free, and made a very rich prize, but he must needs return  to the Palazzo Maraviglia in another dress, in quest of fresh plunder.    The fact was that he was flushed with wine.    Else he would have thought twice of returning.    Mingling with the crowd in the large ball-room, he came to a group  discussing the late robbery in great excitement, and as he was pressing  forward to learn what he could, he became entangled in a lady's lace  flounces.    He turned sharply to apologise, and recognised the figure at once.    \"The lovely Marietta,\" Mathias exclaimed.    She heard him, and made off to the other end of the room, closely  followed by Mathias, who had conceived a violent fancy for her.    \"Stay, Senorita,\" he exclaimed, seizing her hand.    \"What do you want with me?\" said Marietta.    \"Only to plead--\"    \"Nonsense,\" she exclaimed, interrupting him abruptly; \"you don't know  me.\"    \"Let me plead--\"    \"Bother!\"    \"Nay,\" said the persistent robber, \"if you will not hear me speak, hear  me sing.\"    And then, being an admirable mimic, he imitated her strut before the  looking-glass, and general coquettish behaviour in the dressing-room at  the villa, while he sang in a falsetto voice--                            \"Sweet Marietta,                             Rarely has been                           A sweeter or better                             Face or form seen.                           Dear Marietta!\"    \"Hah!\" cried the girl, starting back as if she had been shot.    Her first impulse was to faint.    But as soon as she gained the cooler air without, she recovered, and  collecting her senses a little, she gave a pretty shrewd guess at the  truth.    She was silly, yet not a bad-natured girl.    She saw her duty plainly enough.    She must make herself known at once to her master.    Harkaway was close at hand, discussing the robbery still with  Jefferson.    The whole of this party were of course known to Marietta; so she made  straight up to Harkaway, and said hurriedly--    \"Have that man seized, sir--see, that one who is following me. I am  Marietta. He has just said something to me which convinces me that he  was hiding in the villa to-night.\"    \"Hullo!\" exclaimed Harkaway, not a little startled at this sudden  address; \"why, what in Heaven's name--\"    \"Lose no time,\" interrupted Marietta eagerly, \"or he will go--see, he  has taken the alarm.\"    \"The girl's right,\" said Jefferson, striding off after Mathias.    The latter now began to perceive that he had made a false step, and he  hurried through the crowded room towards the door, and was just passing  out, when a dwarfed and ugly figure leaped upon him.    So sudden was the attack that Mathias was capsized, and together they  rolled upon the floor.    \"Let go!\" said the Greek fiercely, \"or I'll--\"    \"Not me!\" exclaimed Magog Brand--for he was the Greek's assailant. \"I  know you, my yellow-feathered devil, even though you have shed your  skin!\"    \"Let go,\" hissed the Greek brigand, with compressed lips, \"or I'll have  your life!\"    \"I'll not let go,\" cried the brave little Brand. \"I have got you,  villain, and will hold you. Ah!\"    Mathias scrambled up, and tried to fly, but he was met with a blow from  Jefferson's fist which might have felled an ox in the shambles.    He dropped lifeless on the ground beside Magog,    And then a sudden outcry arose, for it was found that in that brief  struggle poor Magog Brand had been cruelly used.    A long-bladed poignard was buried up to the hilt in his side.    Poor Brand.    Death must have been almost instantaneous.    They tore the mask from Mathias' face, and thereupon an agent of the  secret police stepped forward and made known who it was.    \"This is the notorious Mathias,\" he said. \"One of the most daring of  the brigands hereabouts; we have been wanting him badly for some time  past.\"    \"You have got him,\" said Harkaway, \"but oh!\" he added, glancing at the  lifeless form of Magog Brand, \"at what a price for us!\"    At this juncture Harvey reached the spot, and taking in the whole scene  at a glance, he dropped on his knees beside the body of Magog Brand,  where Jefferson was already kneeling, seemingly half stupefied by the  catastrophe.    \"He has fainted,\" said he to Harvey.    Harvey shook his head mournfully.    \"He'll never faint again, Jefferson.\"    \"What?\"    \"Never.\"    \"You surely--no, no, Brand, dear old boy, look up.\"    He faltered and broke down.    \"Yes, Jefferson,\" said Harvey in deep emotion. \"Poor Magog Brand is at  the end of his troubles and pleasures alike--he is dead!\"    [Illustration: \"'MURDER! ABDUCTION! SHOUTED MOLE HUNSTON IS HERE\"--ADV  IN GREECE VOL II PAGE 39.]          CHAPTER V.    THE PURSUIT OF THE BRIGANDS--THE BATTLE--VARYING FORTUNES--HOW  HUNSTON AND TORO WERE LAID BY THE HEELS.      Consternation was upon every face.    The catastrophe was so sudden and unlocked for, that the people about  were half stupefied with fear.    On one side lay poor Magog Brand, lately so full of life and animation.    On the other was his assassin, felled by the dead man's best friend,  the doughty Jefferson, and with scarcely more life in him than his  victim.    And while the people were staring hopelessly at each other thus, a  voice was heard giving the alarm hard by.    \"Poor Brand, your murderer shall not escape,\" said Jefferson bitterly.    The noise continued, and presently the voice was recognised.    \"It is Mole,\" cried Harkaway.    He was right.    Just then the poor old gentleman appeared upon the scene.    \"Harkaway, Jefferson, Harvey!\" he cried.    \"What's the matter?\"    \"Murder!\" returned Mole. \"Hunston is here.\"    \"By Heaven! I thought it,\" ejaculated Jefferson.    \"He has carried off Emily and Paquita.\"    \"What?\"    \"I interfered, but they were too many for me. See how they have used  me.\"    \"Was he with the brigands?\" demanded Harkaway.    \"I suppose so. A whole mob of ruffians.\"    \"Where are they gone?\"    \"By the small gate.\"    A hurried explanation ensued with the agent of the secret police, who  gave them a few words of comfort.    \"He'll never be able to pass my men at the gate,\" said the officer,  with great confidence.    This was doubtful.    They knew too well Hunston's boldness and audacity.    But they lost no time in getting up a pursuit.    The contessa's stables were well furnished, and two horses were  speedily saddled for Harkaway and Jefferson.    Harvey, too impatient to wait for a mount, had rushed wildly away in  the direction of the small gate, followed by Mr. Mole.    Here he saw to his dismay that a scramble had taken place, in which the  gendarmes had got decidedly the worst of it.    The two who had been on guard at the gate had got very roughly handled,  one having a broken crown and the other showing an ugly wound in the  side.    \"They have gone this way, then?\" exclaimed Harvey, eagerly.    \"Yes.\"    \"Which way?\"    \"They made for the right,\" faltered one of the wounded men.    \"Is it long?\"    \"No; a few moments.\"    \"They can not get far,\" said the gendarme with the broken pate; \"the  two girls were struggling hard with him.\"    \"Hurrah!\" cried Harvey. \"I'll save my child yet.\"    \"You are not the first in the hunt,\" said the other gendarme, speaking  with evident pain; \"there are two black men after them.\"    \"That must be Sunday and Monday,\" exclaimed Harvey.    And off he ran.    He bounded over the ground like a deer, and when he got about half a  mile further on, he came suddenly upon two men struggling.    One of them was a negro.    Who, in fact, but our old friend the Prince of Limbi, the faithful  Monday?    The other was one of the Greeks, a face unknown to Harvey, but one who  has already figured in these pages.    Matteo!    And lying on the ground near him was a brigand struck down dead by  brave Monday.    As Harvey came up, it was nearing the end of what had been a precious  tough fight. Monday was uppermost, and Matteo, who had gradually  succumbed to the wiry negro, was by this time in a very queer way  indeed.    Monday held him by the throat, and in spite of his desperate efforts to  set himself free, Matteo had lost his breath.    And there he lay completely at the negro's mercy.    \"There, you dam tief!\" exclaimed the Prince of Limbi, \"take dat, an'  dat, an' dat, an' now, be golly, have dis for a little bit in.\"    At every word he pressed harder and harder and jerked his adversary  back.    The \"little bit in\" settled Matteo completely.    Something seemed to crack in the wretched Greek's throat, and he  dropped back.    \"Monday, Monday!\" said Harvey, eagerly, \"where are they?\"    \"Hullo, Massa Dick!\" said faithful Monday; \"I'se gwine to give this  fellar toko an' den I'll jine yar.\"    \"He's done for,\" said Dick, hastily. \"Come now.\"    \"He might come too,\" said Monday, in some doubt.    \"No fear.\"    \"Perhaps.\"    \"Why, he'll never trouble anyone more,\" returned Harvey; \"tell me,  where have they gone?\"    \"They went straight on.\"    \"This road?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Good. Come or stay. I'll go,\" exclaimed Harvey.    And off he ran.    Monday gave his silent enemy a shake to see if it was all over.    \"He's a gone coon,\" he said to himself. \"I'll bolt off after Massa  Dick.\"    Away he ran at a good swinging trot.    In about ten minutes more he came up with him.    And this was under the most alarming circumstances.    Not very long after this a horseman dashed up to the spot, and only  drew rein to give a glance at the lifeless form of the wretched Matteo.    \"He's dead,\" said the horseman, who was none other than Jack Harkaway.  \"This looks like some of Dick's handiwork. Dick or some of our party. I  hope Dick is safe.\" Saying which, he whipped up his horse, and tore on  at a mad gallop.    A very few moments after"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7346"],[0,"Among Malay Pirates : a Tale of Adventure and Peril (#6)"],[1," the British ship had come was not even touched  upon; refreshments, consisting of native sweets and palm wine, were then  passed round, and the captain, seeing that all business talk was to be  deferred, took his leave.    The doctor, who was fond of the two midshipmen, was always ready to chat  freely with them.    \"What did you think of our ally, Dr. Horsley?\" Dick asked him, when,  having changed his full uniform for a suit of undress, he came up on  deck.    \"Between you and me, Balderson, I have seldom seen a more unmitigated  looking ruffian in my life; even for a Malay, he is ugly. Soh Hay tells  me that in his young days he was a great fighter, and his face and  shoulders are seamed with scars. I asked how he came to be rajah; for he  does not look at all the type of the better class of people. Soh told  me that, in the first place, he took to the jungle, owing to his having  krised in a quarrel the son of the chief here. He was joined by other  fugitives, set up as a pirate, and captured by surprise one of the  chief's prahus. His force grew rapidly, and he made a night attack on  the chief's campong, killed him and all the members of his family, and  caused himself to be elected chief of the tribe, which was then a  small one. Gradually he swallowed up one after another of his weaker  neighbors, sometimes by force, sometimes by treachery. I believe he is  now confronted by more powerful chiefs, and that it is only because he  is possessed of some six or eight piratical prahus that he has been able  to maintain his position. No doubt he has become alarmed by a prospect  of a combination against him, and has so invited us to support him. Such  a step will, of course, greatly add to his unpopularity, but doubtless  he thinks that, with our help, he could defy his enemies.\"    \"But, he cannot suppose, Doctor,\" Harry said indignantly, \"that we are  going to fight for such a rascal as he is against the men he has been  plundering.\"    \"I don't expect he does think that we are going to fight for him, unless  he can show us that it is to our interest to do so. I should imagine  that he hopes that the effect of our appearance here will be to either  induce his neighbors to come to some arrangement with him, or that he  will endeavor to make peace with them by offering to throw us over, and  to join with them against us.\"    \"Then, I should say, Doctor, that the best thing would be to hang the  ruffian up at once.\"    \"Well, yes, that might be a good plan, Parkhurst,\" the doctor said with  a smile, \"and might save us a good deal of trouble; but, you see, we  have come up here at his invitation; we have just been eating his food  and drinking his liquor, and it would scarcely place us in a favorable  position in the eyes of the natives in general were we to commence our  alliance with him by hanging him.\"    Harry laughed. \"No, I suppose not, Doctor. Still, what are we to do?\"    \"We must wait, lad. We are here to ascertain the precise situation, and  it will be some time before that will be cleared up. Certainly for the  present there will be nothing for us to do but to keep quiet and see how  matters turn out, and to get through the time as best we may. We shall  have fine opportunities for shooting and botanizing, for whatever the  chief's designs may be, it is certain that at present he will do all in  his power to please us. The captain today, at my suggestion, said that,  in order to keep the men in good health, it would be desirable that they  should have every opportunity of going ashore, and that the officers  should make expeditions in search of game into the interior. He promised  at once to afford us every facility, and to provide us with guides and  beaters.\"    The next day permission was granted to several of the officers and to  twenty sailors and a dozen marines to go on shore. Before starting, the  whole ship's company were drawn up, and the captain addressed them upon  the absolute necessity for good behavior.    \"The Malays,\" he said, \"are a fierce race, very proud and independent,  and quick to resent the smallest insult. Each man carries a kris, and is  ready to use it on the slightest provocation. Every man who goes ashore  must remember that not only his own life, but those of many others,  and the success of the mission on which we have come hither, may be  forfeited by any careless act of aggression. Many of you have served on  the coast of Africa, but you must remember that the Malays are not to be  treated in the same free and easy manner that may go down with negroes.  You must comport yourselves with the same decency of behavior that you  would were you in the port of a friendly European Power. Any breach  of these orders will be most severely punished; and I appeal to every  officer and man to use his utmost efforts to keep on good terms with  these people, and to behave as if the honor and credit of the ship  depended upon him personally. Any man who comes on board in the  slightest degree the worse for liquor will not be allowed to land  again, even if we are stationed here for six months; and if there is any  misbehavior on shore, all leave will be stopped.\"    Two days later, the captain, with the second lieutenant and doctor,  again paid a visit to the rajah, and this time business matters were  entered upon. The chief began by stating that he rejoiced at the thought  of being under the protection of the great English Queen. The captain  replied that her Majesty was anxious to be on good terms with all  the Malay chiefs; that those rajahs and sultans who had accepted her  protection had greatly benefited by so doing, and by listening to  the advice of the officers whom she sent to reside at their seat of  government; but that, of course, before receiving his state under her  protection it was necessary that her representative, the Governor of  the Straits Settlements, should be thoroughly satisfied that the rajah  intended to be guided by the advice so given.    He said that it was thoroughly necessary this should be understood, for  that the allegiance offered to the Queen could not be lightly thrown  off. If a chief once owned her as his sovereign, he could not change  his mind afterwards; and should he disobey the advice and orders of  the Resident, he would be liable to be dethroned, and his government  bestowed upon one better fitted for it. He could not, for instance,  be allowed to engage in hostilities against his neighbors without the  consent of the Resident, for it was clear that the English could not  assist him in wars in which they considered that he was in the wrong.  In these matters there must be benefits on both sides: the chief would  obtain protection against warlike neighbors, would benefit by the  presence and advice of a British officer, and by the trade that would  spring up; while, in return for these benefits, he must acknowledge the  Queen as his sovereign, and must obey the orders of her officers just as  her native born subjects would do.    The chief looked very serious at this. \"Cannot,\" he asked at last, \"a  chief obtain the protection of the British, and afterwards remain as an  ally of theirs?\"    \"Not so,\" the captain said; \"he cannot come to us when he is in danger  and ask us to send ships and men to aid him, and afterwards, when the  danger has passed, wish us good morning, and give us nothing in return  for the benefits he had received.\"    \"What orders would a Resident give?\" the rajah asked, after a pause.    \"He would give such orders as would be necessary for the good of the  state; without interfering in matters of home government, he would not  allow acts of tyranny and cruelty that would imperil the peace of the  state, and perhaps bring about a rising. He would not suffer trade  passing through the dominions to be hampered and injured by heavy and  unjust exactions; although, doubtless, he would allow legitimate tolls  to be taken. He would not permit expeditions to be fitted out for  attacks upon harmless neighbors. His interference would always be for  the good of the state, and, consequently, for the good of its prince.  The incomes of the various rulers who have placed themselves under  British protection have always been largely augmented by the prosperity  and well doing of the state, the increase in its population, the  extension of its trade and agriculture, all of which enabled the people  to pay a larger amount of taxation.    \"You see, Rajah, we force no one to place himself under our protection;  we war with no one unless, by attack upon ourselves or upon princes  under our protection, he compels us to punish him, and, in extreme  cases, to take possession of his dominions. I am explaining all this to  you because I wish you thoroughly to understand what your position will  be if the Queen takes you under her protection--which she certainly will  not do unless it is found that you are likely, on your part, to carry  out faithfully the obligations you have assumed in return for that  protection.\"    When this had been translated to the rajah by the interpreter, the chief  sat for some time silent. It was evident that he was ill pleased, and  that he had reckoned upon obtaining the British aid without undertaking  any responsibilities whatever.    \"And the officer who will come up,\" he said at last, \"would he reside on  shore?\"    \"Certainly he would. A portion of ground would be allotted for the  Residency; on this a fort would be erected, which would be manned by a  small force for his protection; and he might either reside in the fort  or in a residence erected for him close to it, and under shelter of its  guns. The fort would, of course, be used for the protection of the town  against enemies, as well as for the protection of the officer against  any rising on the part of your people; in which case you, as well as  himself, would find a refuge in it.\"    \"Then I should no longer be a ruler,\" the rajah said"]]]
