They are not mad.  Who are ye?  And whence are ye?  Explain.\"    \"We are but peaceful strangers, sir,\" I said, \"and traveling upon  our own concerns.  We are from a far country, and unacquainted  here.  We have purposed no harm; and yet but for your brave  interference and protection these people would have killed us.  As you have divined, sir, we are not mad; neither are we violent  or bloodthirsty.\"    The gentleman turned to his retinue and said calmly: \"Lash me  these animals to their kennels!\"    The mob vanished in an instant; and after them plunged the horsemen,  laying about them with their whips and pitilessly riding down such  as were witless enough to keep the road instead of taking to the  bush.  The shrieks and supplications presently died away in the  distance, and soon the horsemen began to straggle back.  Meantime  the gentleman had been questioning us more closely, but had dug  no particulars out of us.  We were lavish of recognition of the  service he was doing us, but we revealed nothing more than that we  were friendless strangers from a far country.  When the escort were  all returned, the gentleman said to one of his servants:    \"Bring the led-horses and mount these people.\"    \"Yes, my lord.\"    We were placed toward the rear, among the servants.  We traveled  pretty fast, and finally drew rein some time after dark at a  roadside inn some ten or twelve miles from the scene of our  troubles.  My lord went immediately to his room, after ordering  his supper, and we saw no more of him.  At dawn in the morning  we breakfasted and made ready to start.    My lord's chief attendant sauntered forward at that moment with  indolent grace, and said:    \"Ye have said ye should continue upon this road, which is our  direction likewise; wherefore my lord, the earl Grip, hath given  commandment that ye retain the horses and ride, and that certain  of us ride with ye a twenty mile to a fair town that hight Cambenet,  whenso ye shall be out of peril.\"    We could do nothing less than express our thanks and accept the  offer.  We jogged along, six in the party, at a moderate and  comfortable gait, and in conversation learned that my lord Grip  was a very great personage in his own region, which lay a day's  journey beyond Cambenet.  We loitered to such a degree that it was  near the middle of the forenoon when we entered the market square  of the town.  We dismounted, and left our thanks once more for  my lord, and then approached a crowd assembled in the center of  the square, to see what might be the object of interest.  It was the  remnant of that old peregrinating band of slaves!  So they had  been dragging their chains about, all this weary time.  That poor  husband was gone, and also many others; and some few purchases  had been added to the gang.  The king was not interested, and  wanted to move along, but I was absorbed, and full of pity.  I could  not take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity.  There they sat, grounded upon the ground, silent, uncomplaining,  with bowed heads, a pathetic sight.  And by hideous contrast, a  redundant orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirty  steps away, in fulsome laudation of \"our glorious British liberties!\"    I was boiling.  I had forgotten I was a plebeian, I was remembering  I was a man.  Cost what it might, I would mount that rostrum and--    Click! the king and I were handcuffed together!  Our companions,  those servants, had done it; my lord Grip stood looking on.  The  king burst out in a fury, and said:    \"What meaneth this ill-mannered jest?\"    My lord merely said to his head miscreant, coolly:    \"Put up the slaves and sell them!\"    _Slaves!_  The word had a new sound--and how unspeakably awful!  The  king lifted his manacles and brought them down with a deadly force;  but my lord was out of the way when they arrived.  A dozen of  the rascal's servants sprang forward, and in a moment we were  helpless, with our hands bound behind us.  We so loudly and so  earnestly proclaimed ourselves freemen, that we got the interested  attention of that liberty-mouthing orator and his patriotic crowd,  and they gathered about us and assumed a very determined attitude.  The orator said:    \"If, indeed, ye are freemen, ye have nought to fear--the God-given  liberties of Britain are about ye for your shield and shelter!  (Applause.)  Ye shall soon see. Bring forth your proofs.\"    \"What proofs?\"    \"Proof that ye are freemen.\"    Ah--I remembered!  I came to myself; I said nothing.  But the  king stormed out:    \"Thou'rt insane, man.  It were better, and more in reason, that  this thief and scoundrel here prove that we are _not_ freemen.\"    You see, he knew his own laws just as other people so often know  the laws; by words, not by effects.  They take a _meaning_, and get  to be very vivid, when you come to apply them to yourself.    All hands shook their heads and looked disappointed; some turned  away, no longer interested.  The orator said--and this time in the  tones of business, not of sentiment:    \"An ye do not know your country's laws, it were time ye learned  them.  Ye are strangers to us; ye will not deny that. Ye may be  freemen, we do not deny that; but also ye may be slaves.  The law  is clear: it doth not require the claimant to prove ye are slaves,  it requireth you to prove ye are not.\"    I said:    \"Dear sir, give us only time to send to Astolat; or give us only  time to send to the Valley of Holiness--\"    \"Peace, good man, these are extraordinary requests, and you may  not hope to have them granted.  It would cost much time, and would  unwarrantably inconvenience your master--\"    \"_Master_, idiot!\" stormed the king.  \"I have no master, I myself  am the m--\"    \"Silence, for God's sake!\"    I got the words out in time to stop the king.  We were in trouble  enough already; it could not help us any to give these people  the notion that we were lunatics.    There is no use in stringing out the details.  The earl put us up  and sold us at auction.  This same infernal law had existed in  our own South in my own time, more than thirteen hundred years  later, and under it hundreds of freemen who could not prove that  they were freemen had been sold into lifelong slavery without  the circumstance making any particular impression upon me; but the  minute law and the auction block came into my personal experience,  a thing which had been merely improper before became suddenly  hellish.  Well, that's the way we are made.    Yes, we were sold at auction, like swine.  In a big town and an  active market we should have brought a good price; but this place  was utterly stagnant and so we sold at a figure which makes me  ashamed, every time I think of it.  The King of England brought  seven dollars, and his prime minister nine; whereas the king was  easily worth twelve dollars and I as easily worth fifteen.  But  that is the way things always go; if you force a sale on a dull  market, I don't care what the property is, you are going to make  a poor business of it, and you can make up your mind to it.  If  the earl had had wit enough to--    However, there is no occasion for my working my sympathies up  on his account.  Let him go, for the present; I took his number,  so to speak.    The slave-dealer bought us both, and hitched us onto that long  chain of his, and we constituted the rear of his procession.  We  took up our line of march and passed out of Cambenet at noon;  and it seemed to me unaccountably strange and odd that the King  of England and his chief minister, marching manacled and fettered  and yoked, in a slave convoy, could move by all manner of idle men  and women, and under windows where sat the sweet and the lovely,  and yet never attract a curious eye, never provoke a single remark.  Dear, dear, it only shows that there is nothing diviner about a king  than there is about a tramp, after all.  He is just a cheap and  hollow artificiality when you don't know he is a king.  But reveal  his quality, and dear me it takes your very breath away to look  at him.  I reckon we are all fools. Born so, no doubt.        CHAPTER XXXV    A PITIFUL INCIDENT    It's a world of surprises.  The king brooded; this was natural.  What would he brood about, should you say?  Why, about the prodigious  nature of his fall, of course--from the loftiest place in the world  to the lowest; from the most illustrious station in the world to  the obscurest; from the grandest vocation among men to the basest.  No, I take my oath that the thing that graveled him most, to start  with, was not this, but the price he had fetched!  He couldn't  seem to get over that seven dollars.  Well, it stunned me so, when  I first found it out, that I couldn't believe it; it didn't seem  natural.  But as soon as my mental sight cleared and I got a right  focus on it, I saw I was mistaken; it _was_ natural.  For this  reason: a king is a mere artificiality, and so a king's feelings,  like the impulses of an automatic doll, are mere artificialities;  but as a man, he is a reality, and his feelings, as a man, are  real, not phantoms.  It shames the average man to be valued below  his own estimate of his worth, and the king certainly wasn't  anything more than an average man, if he was up that high.    Confound him, he wearied me with arguments to show that in anything  like a fair market he would have fetched twenty-five dollars,  sure--a thing which was plainly nonsense, and full or the baldest  conceit; I wasn't worth it myself.  But it was tender ground for  me to argue on.  In fact, I had to simply shirk argument and do  the diplomatic instead.  I had to throw conscience aside, and  brazenly concede that he ought to have brought twenty-five dollars;  whereas I was quite well aware that in all the ages, the world had  never seen a king that was worth half the money, and during"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7249"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 8. (#6)"],[1,"useful and keep  them out of mischief.  The plan worked very well, the competition  for the places was hot.  The conductor of the 4.33 express was  a duke; there wasn't a passenger conductor on the line below  the degree of earl.  They were good men, every one, but they had  two defects which I couldn't cure, and so had to wink at: they  wouldn't lay aside their armor, and they would \"knock down\" fare  --I mean rob the company.    There was hardly a knight in all the land who wasn't in some useful  employment.  They were going from end to end of the country in all  manner of useful missionary capacities; their penchant for wandering,  and their experience in it, made them altogether the most effective  spreaders of civilization we had.  They went clothed in steel and  equipped with sword and lance and battle-axe, and if they couldn't  persuade a person to try a sewing-machine on the installment plan,  or a melodeon, or a barbed-wire fence, or a prohibition journal,  or any of the other thousand and one things they canvassed for,  they removed him and passed on.    I was very happy.  Things were working steadily toward a secretly  longed-for point.  You see, I had two schemes in my head which  were the vastest of all my projects.  The one was to overthrow the  Catholic Church and set up the Protestant faith on its ruins  --not as an Established Church, but a go-as-you-please one; and  the other project was to get a decree issued by and by, commanding  that upon Arthur's death unlimited suffrage should be introduced,  and given to men and women alike--at any rate to all men, wise  or unwise, and to all mothers who at middle age should be found  to know nearly as much as their sons at twenty-one.  Arthur was  good for thirty years yet, he being about my own age--that is  to say, forty--and I believed that in that time I could easily  have the active part of the population of that day ready and eager  for an event which should be the first of its kind in the history  of the world--a rounded and complete governmental revolution  without bloodshed.  The result to be a republic.  Well, I may  as well confess, though I do feel ashamed when I think of it:  I was beginning to have a base hankering to be its first president  myself.  Yes, there was more or less human nature in me; I found  that out.    Clarence was with me as concerned the revolution, but in a modified  way.  His idea was a republic, without privileged orders, but with  a hereditary royal family at the head of it instead of an elective  chief magistrate.  He believed that no nation that had ever known  the joy of worshiping a royal family could ever be robbed of it  and not fade away and die of melancholy.  I urged that kings were  dangerous.  He said, then have cats.  He was sure that a royal  family of cats would answer every purpose.  They would be as useful  as any other royal family, they would know as much, they would  have the same virtues and the same treacheries, the same disposition  to get up shindies with other royal cats, they would be laughably  vain and absurd and never know it, they would be wholly inexpensive;  finally, they would have as sound a divine right as any other  royal house, and \"Tom VII, or Tom XI, or Tom XIV by the grace  of God King,\" would sound as well as it would when applied to  the ordinary royal tomcat with tights on.  \"And as a rule,\" said  he, in his neat modern English, \"the character of these cats would  be considerably above the character of the average king, and this  would be an immense moral advantage to the nation, for the reason  that a nation always models its morals after its monarch's.  The  worship of royalty being founded in unreason, these graceful and  harmless cats would easily become as sacred as any other royalties,  and indeed more so, because it would presently be noticed that  they hanged nobody, beheaded nobody, imprisoned nobody, inflicted  no cruelties or injustices of any sort, and so must be worthy of  a deeper love and reverence than the customary human king, and  would certainly get it.  The eyes of the whole harried world would  soon be fixed upon this humane and gentle system, and royal butchers  would presently begin to disappear; their subjects would fill  the vacancies with catlings from our own royal house; we should  become a factory; we should supply the thrones of the world; within  forty years all Europe would be governed by cats, and we should  furnish the cats.  The reign of universal peace would begin then,  to end no more forever....  Me-e-e-yow-ow-ow-ow--fzt!--wow!\"    Hang him, I supposed he was in earnest, and was beginning to be  persuaded by him, until he exploded that cat-howl and startled me  almost out of my clothes.  But he never could be in earnest.  He  didn't know what it was.  He had pictured a distinct and perfectly  rational and feasible improvement upon constitutional monarchy,  but he was too feather-headed to know it, or care anything about  it, either.  I was going to give him a scolding, but Sandy came  flying in at that moment, wild with terror, and so choked with sobs  that for a minute she could not get her voice.  I ran and took her  in my arms, and lavished caresses upon her and said, beseechingly:    \"Speak, darling, speak!  What is it?\"    Her head fell limp upon my bosom, and she gasped, almost inaudibly:    \"HELLO-CENTRAL!\"    \"Quick!\" I shouted to Clarence; \"telephone the king's homeopath  to come!\"    In two minutes I was kneeling by the child's crib, and Sandy was  dispatching servants here, there, and everywhere, all over the  palace.  I took in the situation almost at a glance--membranous  croup!  I bent down and whispered:    \"Wake up, sweetheart!  Hello-Central.\"    She opened her soft eyes languidly, and made out to say:    \"Papa.\"    That was a comfort.  She was far from dead yet.  I sent for  preparations of sulphur, I rousted out the croup-kettle myself;  for I don't sit down and wait for doctors when Sandy or the child  is sick.  I knew how to nurse both of them, and had had experience.  This little chap had lived in my arms a good part of its small life,  and often I could soothe away its troubles and get it to laugh  through the tear-dews on its eye-lashes when even its mother couldn't.    Sir Launcelot, in his richest armor, came striding along the great  hall now on his way to the stock-board; he was president of the  stock-board, and occupied the Siege Perilous, which he had bought  of Sir Galahad; for the stock-board consisted of the Knights of  the Round Table, and they used the Round Table for business purposes  now.  Seats at it were worth--well, you would never believe the  figure, so it is no use to state it.  Sir Launcelot was a bear, and  he had put up a corner in one of the new lines, and was just getting  ready to squeeze the shorts to-day; but what of that?  He was  the same old Launcelot, and when he glanced in as he was passing  the door and found out that his pet was sick, that was enough  for him; bulls and bears might fight it out their own way for all  him, he would come right in here and stand by little Hello-Central  for all he was worth.  And that was what he did.  He shied his  helmet into the corner, and in half a minute he had a new wick  in the alcohol lamp and was firing up on the croup-kettle.  By this  time Sandy had built a blanket canopy over the crib, and everything  was ready.    Sir Launcelot got up steam, he and I loaded up the kettle with  unslaked lime and carbolic acid, with a touch of lactic acid added  thereto, then filled the thing up with water and inserted the  steam-spout under the canopy.  Everything was ship-shape now,  and we sat down on either side of the crib to stand our watch.  Sandy was so grateful and so comforted that she charged a couple  of church-wardens with willow-bark and sumach-tobacco for us,  and told us to smoke as much as we pleased, it couldn't get under  the canopy, and she was used to smoke, being the first lady in the  land who had ever seen a cloud blown.  Well, there couldn't be  a more contented or comfortable sight than Sir Launcelot in his  noble armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of a yard  of snowy church-warden.  He was a beautiful man, a lovely man,  and was just intended to make a wife and children happy.  But, of  course Guenever--however, it's no use to cry over what's done and  can't be helped.    Well, he stood watch-and-watch with me, right straight through,  for three days and nights, till the child was out of danger; then  he took her up in his great arms and kissed her, with his plumes  falling about her golden head, then laid her softly in Sandy's  lap again and took his stately way down the vast hall, between  the ranks of admiring men-at-arms and menials, and so disappeared.  And no instinct warned me that I should never look upon him again  in this world!  Lord, what a world of heart-break it is.    The doctors said we must take the child away, if we would coax  her back to health and strength again.  And she must have sea-air.  So we took a man-of-war, and a suite of two hundred and sixty  persons, and went cruising about, and after a fortnight of this we  stepped ashore on the French coast, and the doctors thought it  would be a good idea to make something of a stay there.  The little  king of that region offered us his hospitalities, and we were glad  to accept.  If he had had as many conveniences as he lacked, we  should have been plenty comfortable enough; even as it was, we  made out very well, in his queer old castle, by the help of comforts  and luxuries from the ship.    At the end of a month I sent the vessel home for fresh supplies,  and for news.  We expected her back in three or four days.  She  would bring me, along with other news, the result of a certain  experiment which I had been starting.  It was a project of mine  to replace the tournament with something which might furnish an  escape for the extra steam of "]]]
