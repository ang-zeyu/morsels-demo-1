Two canoes paddled  alongside, and their head-men came on board. One was a beautifully formed  man, and walked the deck with a picturesque dignity of aspect and motion.  He had more the movement of an Indian, than any negro I ever saw. Two men  were left in each boat, to keep her alongside, and wait the movements of  their master. They kneel in the boat, and sit on their heels. When a  biscuit is thrown to them, they put it on their thighs, and thence eat it  at their leisure.    16.--Ashore at Monrovia. The buildings look dilapidated, and the wooden  walls are in a state of decay. Houses of stone are coming into vogue.  There is a large stone court-house, intended likewise for a Legislative  Hall. What most interested me, was an African pony, a beautiful animal,  snow white, with a head as black as ebony. I also saw five men chained  together, by the neck; three colonists and two natives, with an overseer  superintending them. They had been splitting stone for Government.    A gun from the ship gave the signal for our return. Going on board, we got  under way, and sailed for Porto Praya.     20.--For four days, we have had much rain; and I have seldom visited the  deck, except when duty called me. Fortunately, Governor Roberts had lent  me the report of the Committee of Parliament, on the Western Coast of  Africa, the perusal of which has afforded me both pleasant and profitable  occupation. It is an excellent work, full of facts, from men who have  spent years on the coast.    21.--Wind still favorable. The day is sunny, and all are on deck to enjoy  the air. Damp clothes hang in the rigging to-day, and mouldy boots and  shoes fill the boats.    24.--We find ourselves again off the harbor of Porto Praya. I landed in  quest of news, and heard of the death of Mr. Legare, and the loss of the  store-ship, at this port. All hands were saved, but with the sacrifice of  several thousand dollars' worth of property, besides the vessel.    On approaching the shore, three flags are observed to be flying in the  town. One is the consular flag of our own nation; another is the banner of  Portugal; and the third, being blue, white, and blue, is apt to puzzle a  stranger, until he reads UNION HOTEL, in letters a foot long. When last at  Porto Praya, a few friends and myself took some slight refreshment at the  hotel, and were charged so exorbitantly, that we forswore all visits to  the house in future. To-day, the keeper stopt me in the street, and begged  the favor of our patronage. On my representing the enormity of his former  conduct, he declared that it was all a mistake; that he was the master of  the hotel, and was unfortunately absent at the time. I was pleased with  this effrontery, having paid the exorbitant charge into his own hands, not  a month before. It is delightful, in these remote, desolate, and  semi-barbarous regions, to meet with characteristics that remind us of a  more polished and civilized land.    The streets are hot and deserted, and the town more than ordinarily dull,  as most of the inhabitants are out planting. The court has gone to  Buonavista, on account of the unhealthiness of Porta Praya, at this season  of the year. A few dozen scrubby trees have been planted in the large  square, but, though protected by palings and barrels, have not reached the  height of two feet. In the centre stands a marble monument, possibly  intended for a fountain, but wholly destitute of water.    25.--The boat went ashore again, and brought off the consul, and some  stores. We then made sail, passing to the windward of all the islands, and  reached our former anchorage at Porto Grande.    28.--There are one barque and three brigs, all American whalers, in the  harbor of Porto Grande. They have been out from three to six months, and  are here for water, bad though it be, and fresh provisions. Their  inducements to visit this port, are the goodness of the harbor, and the  smallness of the port charges. No consular fee has been paid until now,  when, an agent being appointed, each vessel pays him a perquisite of four  dollars.    This group of islands is chiefly interesting to Americans, as being the  resort of our whale-ships, to refit and obtain supplies, and of other  vessels trading to the coast of Africa. Little was generally known of  them, however, in America, until 1832, when a long-continued drought  parched up the fields, destroyed the crops, and reduced the whole  population to the verge of death, by famine. Not less than ten thousand  did actually perish of hunger; and the remainder were saved only by the  timely, prompt and bountiful supplies, sent out from every part of the  United States. I well remember the thrill of compassion that pervaded the  community at home, on hearing that multitudes were starving in the Cape de  Verd islands. Without pausing to inquire who they were, or whether  entitled to our assistance, by any other than the all-powerful claim of  wretchedness, the Americans sent vessel after vessel, laden with food,  which was gratuitously distributed to the poor. The supplies were liberal  and unremitted, until the rains returned, and gave the usual crops to the  cultivators.    Twelve years have passed since that dismal famine; but the memory of the  aid extended by Americans has not yet faded, nor seems likely to fade,  from the minds of those who were succored in their need. I have heard men,  who were then saved from starvation, speak strongly and feelingly on the  subject, with quivering lip and faltering voice. Women, likewise, with  streaming eyes, to this day, invoke blessings on the foreign land that fed  their children, when there was no other earthly help. England, though  nearer, and in more intimate connection with these islands, sent not a  mouthful of food; and Portugal, the mother country, shipped only one or  two small cargoes to be sold; while America fed the starving thousands,  gratuitously, for months. Our consul at Porto Praya, Mr. Gardner, after  making a strong and successful appeal to the sympathies of his own  countrymen, distributed his own stores to the inhabitants, until he was  well-nigh beggared. He enjoys the only reward he sought, in the approval  of his conscience, as well as the gratitude of the community; and America,  too, may claim more true glory from this instance of general benevolence,  pervading the country from one end to the other, than from any victory in  our annals.    29.--Ashore again. An ox for our ship was driven in from the mountains by  three or four horsemen and as many dogs, who chased him till he took  refuge in the water. A boat now put off, and soon overtaking the tired  animal, he was tied securely. When towed ashore, one rope was fastened  round his horns, and another to his fore-foot, each held by a negro, while  a third took a strong gripe of his tail. In this manner, they led and  drove him along, the fellow behind occasionally biting the beast's tail,  to quicken his motions; until at length the poor creature was made fast to  an anchor on the beach, there to await the butcher.    There is here a miserable church, but no priest. Passing the edifice  to-day, I saw seven or eight women at their devotions. Instead of  kneeling, they were seated, with their chins resting on their knees, on  the shady side of the church.    30.--The crews of the whale-ships, when ashore, occasionally give no  little trouble to the colonial police. This evening, one of their sailors  came up to us, quite intoxicated, and bleeding from a hurt in his head. He  was bent upon vengeance for his wound, but puzzled how to get it; inasmuch  as a female hand had done the mischief, by cutting his head open with a  bottle. His chivalry would not allow him to strike a woman; nor could he  find any man who would acknowledge himself her relative. In this dilemma,  he was raving through the little village, accompanied by several of his  brother whale-men, mostly drunk, and ready for a row. The Portuguese  officer on duty called out the guard, consisting of two negroes with fixed  bayonets, and caused them to march back and forth in the street. Fifty  paces in the village would bring them to the country; when the detachment  came to the right about, and retraced its steps. These two negroes formed  precisely two-fifths of the regular military force at Porto Grande; but,  besides this formidable host, there are some thirty officers and soldiers  of the National Guard, comprising all the negro population able to bear  clubs.    The women here have a peculiar mode of carrying children, when two or  three years old. The child sits astride of the mother's left hip, clinging  with hands and feet, and partially supported by her left arm. The little  personage being in a state of total nudity, and of course very slippery,  this is doubtless the most convenient method that could be adopted.    The gait of the women is remarkably free and unembarrassed. With no  constraint of stays or corsets, and often innocent of any covering, the  shoulders have full play, and the arms swing more than I have ever seen  those of men, in our own country. Their robes are neither too abundant,  nor too tight, to prevent the exhibition of a very martial stride. The  scanty clothing worn here is owing partly, but not entirely, to the warmth  of the climate. Another cogent reason is the poverty of the inhabitants;  so, at least, I infer from the continual petitions for clothes, and from  remarks like the following, made to me by a mulatto woman:--\"You very good  man, you got plenty clothes, plenty shirt.\"    _September_ 3.--The Cornelia, of New Bedford, came in and anchored. She  has been out fifteen months, and has only 400 barrels of oil.    4.--Left the ship in the launch on an expedition to the neighboring island  of St. Antonio; being despatched by the Commodore to procure information  as to the facilities for anchoring"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7947"],[0,"The Diary of a U-boat Commander (#6)"],[1,"satisfied, but  cursing the fates that made it advisable to keep clear of No. 10,  Kafelle Strasse for thirty-six hours. Needless to say next day I rang  up again in order to tell the Colonel that Lieutenant Schenk had  apparently been detained, as he was not yet back in Bruges, and how I  felt sure that he would be sorry at missing the Colonel, etc., etc.,  but all this camouflage was unnecessary, as she herself came to the  'phone. I could have kissed the instrument when I told her of my  stratagem and heard her silvery laughter in my ear.    \"It is arranged that to-morrow, starting at 10.30, we motor for the day  to the Forest of Meten, taking our lunch and tea with us--pray Heaven  the weather holds.\"    To-night in the Mess it is generally considered that U.B.40 has been  lost; she is ten days overdue and was operating off Havre, she has made  no signal for a fortnight. Such is the price of victory and the cost of  war--death, perhaps, in some terrible form, but bah! away with such  thoughts, to-morrow there is love and life and Zoe!           *       *       *       *       *    Once more it is night, still the guns rumble on the same old dismal  tones, and as it is raining now it must be getting bad up at the front.  Except for the rain it might have been last night, but much has  happened to me in the meanwhile.    To-day in the forest by Ruysslede I found that I loved Zoe, loved her  as I have never yet loved woman, loved her with my soul and all that is  me.    The day was gloriously fine when we started, and an hour's run took us  to the forest. We left the car at an inn and wandered down one of the  glades.    I carried the basket and we strolled on and on until we found a  suitable place deep in the heart of the forest.    I have the sailor's love for woods, for their depths, their shadows,  their mysteries, which are so vivid a contrast to the monotony of the  sea, with the everlasting circle of the horizon and the half-bowl of  the heavens above.    In the forest to-day, though the leaves had turned to gold and red and  brown, the beeches were still well covered, and overhead we were tented  with a russet canopy.    I say, at last we found a spot, or rather Zoe, who, with girlish  pleasure in the adventure, had run ahead, called to me, and as I write  I seem to hear the echoes of \"Karl! Karl!\" which rang through the wood.  When I came up to her she proudly pointed to the place she had found.    It was ideal. An outcrop of rock formed a miniature Matterhorn in the  forest, and beneath its shelter with the old trees as silent witnesses  we sat and joked and laughed, and made twenty attempts to light a fire.    After lunch, a little incident happened which had an enormous effect on  me; Zoe asked me whether I would mind if she smoked.    How many women in these days would think of doing that? And yet, had  she but known it, I am still sufficiently old-fashioned to appreciate  the implied respect for any possible prejudices which was contained in  her request.    After lunch, I asked her a question to which I dreaded the answer.    I asked her whether, now that the old Colonel had gone to the Somme,  whether that meant that she would be leaving Bruges.    She laughed and teasingly said: \"Quien sabe, senor,\" but seeing my real  anxiety on this point, she assured me that she was not leaving for the  present. The Colonel, she said, had a strange belief that once a man  had served on the Flanders Front, and especially on the Ypres salient,  he always came back to die there.    It appears that the Colonel has done fourteen months' service on the  salient alone, and is firmly convinced he will end his career on that  great burial ground. As we were talking about the Colonel I longed to  ask her how she had met him, and perhaps find out why she lives with  him, for I cannot believe she loves him, but I did not dare.    Strangely enough I found that a curious shyness had taken hold of me  with regard to Zoe.    I said to myself, \"Fool! you are alone with her, you long to kiss her;  you have kissed her, first at the dinner-party, secondly when you said  good-bye at her flat,\" and yet to-day it was different.    Then I was kissing a pretty woman, I was on the eve of a dangerous  life, and I was simply extracting the animal pleasures whilst I lived.    To-day it was a case of Zoe, the personality I loved; I still longed to  kiss her, but I wanted to have the unquestioned right to kiss her, as  much as I wanted the kisses.    I wanted to have her for my own, away from the contaminating ownership  of the old Colonel, and I determined to get her.    I think she noticed the changed attitude on my part, and perhaps she  felt herself that a subtle change in our relationship had taken place,  and whilst I meditated on these things she fell into a doze at my side.    I was sitting slightly above her, smoking to keep the midges away, and  as I looked down on her childish figure a great tenderness for her  filled my mind. She is very beautiful and to me desirable above all  women; I can see her as she lay there trustfully at my feet. I will  describe her, and then, when I get her photograph, I will read this  when I am far away on a trip.    She is of average height, for I am just over six feet and she reaches  to just above my shoulder. Her hair is gloriously thick and of a deep  black colour, and lies low on her forehead. Her complexion is of the  purest whiteness beyond compare, which but accentuates the red warmth  of the lips which encircle her little mouth. Her figure is slight and  her ankles are my delight, but her crowning glories, which I have  purposely left till last, are her eyes.    I feel I could lose my soul; I have lost it, if I have one, in the  violet depths of those eyes, which were veiled as she slept by the long  black eyelashes which curled up delicately as they rested on her  cheeks. I have re-read this description, and it is oh, so unsatisfying;  would I had the pen of a Goethe or a Shakespeare, yet for want of more  skill the description shall stand.    How I long for her to be mine, and yet, unfortunate that I am, I cannot  for certain declare that she loves me.    A thousand doubts arise. I torment myself with recollections of her  behaviour at the dinner-party, when within two hours of our first  meeting she gave me her lips.    Yet did I not first roughly kiss her as we danced?    I find consolation in the fact that, though she has said nothing, yet  her conduct to-day was different. She was so quiet after tea as we  wandered back through the forests with the setting sun striking golden  beams aslant the tree trunks.    Before we left I sang to her Tchaikowsky's beautiful song, \"To the  Forest,\" and I think she was pleased, for I may say with justice that  my voice is of high quality for an amateur, and the song goes well  without an accompaniment, whilst the atmosphere and surroundings were  ideal.    There was only one jarring note in a perfect day; when we returned to  the car the chauffeur permitted himself a sardonic grin. Zoe  unfortunately saw it and blushed scarlet.    I could have struck him on his impudent mouth, but for her sake I  judged it advisable to notice nothing.    I feel I could go on writing about her all night, but it is nearly 2  a.m. I must get some sleep.    The guns rumble steadily in the south-west, and the sky is lit by their  flashes; may the fighting on the Somme be bloody these coming days.          [_Probably about ten days later.--Etienne._]      We leave to-night, having had a longer spell than usual. I am in a  distracted state of mind. Since our glorious day in the forest I have  seen her nearly every afternoon, though twice that swine Alten has kept  me in the boat in connection with some replacements of the battery.    I have found out that, like me, she is intensely musical. She plays  beautifully on the piano, and we had long hours together playing Chopin  and Beethoven; we also played some of Moussorgsky's duets, but I love  her best when she plays Chopin, the composer pre-eminent of love and  passion.    She has masses of music, as the Colonel gives her what she likes. We  also played a lot of Debussy. At first I demurred at playing a living  French composer's works, but she pouted and looked so adorable that all  my scruples vanished in an instant, so we closed all the doors and she  played it for hours very softly whilst I forgot the war and all its  horrors and remembered only that I was with the well-beloved girl.    The Colonel writes from Thiepval, where the British are pouring out  their blood like water. He writes very interesting letters, and has had  many narrow escapes, but unfortunately he seems to bear a charmed life.  His letters are full of details, and I wonder he gets them past the  Field Censorship, but I suppose he censors his own.    She laughs at them and calls them her Colonel's dispatches; she says he  is so accustomed to writing official reports that the poor old man  can't write an ordinary letter.    I told her that I thought the way he mentioned regiments and  dispositions rather indiscreet, and she agrees, but she says he has  asked her to keep them, with a view to forming a collection of letters  written from the front whilst the incidents he describes are vivid in  his mind. I suppose the old ass knows his own business, and one day the  collection may be completed by a telegram \"Regretting to announce, etc.  etc.\" The sooner the better.    So the days passed pleasantly enough, and never by a gesture or word of  mouth did she show that I was more to her than any other pleasant young  man.    I kissed her when I arrived, I kissed her when I left, each day was the  same. She would put her arms round my neck and look long and deeply  into my eyes, then she would gently kiss my lips. Not an atom of  emotion! not a spark from the fires which I feel must be raging beneath  that diabolically [1] extraordinary [1] amazingly"]]]
