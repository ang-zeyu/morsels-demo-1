Then sense unerring--because unreproved--    True as the finger on the dial moved,    Half-guide, half-playmate, of Earth's age of youth,    The sportive instinct of Eternal Truth.    Then, nor Initiate nor Profane were known;    Where the Heart felt--there Reason found a throne:    Not from the dust below, but life around    Warm Genius shaped what quick Emotion found.    One rule, like light, for every bosom glowed,    Yet hid from all the fountain whence it flowed.    But, gone that blessed Age!--our wilful pride    Has lost, with Nature, the old peaceful Guide.    Feeling, no more to raise us and rejoice,    Is heard and honored as a Godhead's voice;    And, disenhallowed in its eldest cell    The Human Heart--lies mute the Oracle,    Save where the low and mystic whispers thrill    Some listening spirit more divinely still.    There, in the chambers of the inmost heart,    There, must the Sage explore the Magian's art;    There, seek the long-lost Nature's steps to track,    Till, found once more, she gives him Wisdom back!    Hast thou--(O Blest, if so, whate'er betide!)--    Still kept the Guardian Angel by thy side?    Can thy Heart's guileless childhood yet rejoice    In the sweet instinct with its warning voice?    Does Truth yet limn upon untroubled eyes,    Pure and serene, her world of Iris-dies?    Rings clear the echo which her accent calls    Back from the breast, on which the music falls?    In the calm mind is doubt yet hush'd--and will    That doubt tomorrow, as today, be still?    Will all these fine sensations in their play,    No censor need to regulate and sway?    Fear'st thou not in the insidious Heart to find    The source of Trouble to the limpid mind?        No!--then thine Innocence thy Mentor be!    Science can teach thee naught--she learns from thee!    Each law that lends lame succor to the Weak--    The cripple's crutch--the vigorous need not seek!    From thine own self thy rule of action draw;    That which thou dost--what charms thee--is thy Law,    And founds to every race a code sublime--    What pleases Genius gives a Law to Time!    The Word--the Deed--all Ages shall command,    Pure if thy lip and holy if thy hand!    Thou, thou alone mark'st not within thy heart    The inspiring God whose Minister thou art,    Know'st not the magic of the mighty ring    Which bows the realm of Spirits to their King:    But meek, nor conscious of diviner birth,    Glide thy still footsteps thro' the conquered Earth!           *       *       *       *       *        VOTIVE TABLETS    [Under this title Schiller arranged that more dignified and  philosophical portion of the small Poems published as Epigrams in the  _Musen Almanach_; which rather sought to point a general thought, than  a personal satire.--Many of these, however, are either wholly without  interest for the English reader, or express in almost untranslatable  laconism what, in far more poetical shapes, Schiller has elsewhere  repeated and developed.

One  of the results of all this turmoil and of the heavy hand of the Greeks was  a great increase in the vitality of the Bogomil heresy already referred to;  it became a refuge for patriotism and an outlet for its expression. The  Emperor Alexis Comnenus instituted a bitter persecution of it, which only  led to its growth and rapid propagation westwards into Serbia from its  centre Philippopolis.    The reason of the complete overthrow of the Bulgarian monarchy by the  Greeks was of course that the nation itself was totally lacking in  cohesion and organization, and could only achieve any lasting success when  an exceptionally gifted ruler managed to discount the centrifugal  tendencies of the feudal nobles, as Simeon and Samuel had done. Other  discouraging factors wore the permeation of the Church and State by  Byzantine influence, the lack of a large standing army, the spread of the  anarchic Bogomil heresy, and the fact that the bulk of the Slav population  had no desire for foreign adventure or national aggrandizement.        8    _The Rise and Fall of the Second Bulgarian Empire,_ 1186-1258      From 1186 to 1258 Bulgaria experienced temporary resuscitation, the  brevity of which was more than compensated for by the stirring nature of  the events that crowded it. The exactions and oppressions of the Greeks  culminated in a revolt on the part of the Bulgars, which had its centre in  Tirnovo on the river Yantra in northern Bulgaria--a position of great  natural strength and strategic importance, commanding the outlets of  several of the most important passes over the Balkan range. This revolt  coincided with the growing weakness of the eastern empire, which,  surrounded on all sides by aggressive enemies--Kumans, Saracens, Turks,  and Normans--was sickening for one of the severe illnesses which preceded  its dissolution. The revolt was headed by two brothers who were Vlakh or  Rumanian shepherds, and was blessed by the archbishop Basil, who crowned  one of them, called John Asen, as _tsar_ in Tirnovo in 1186. Their first  efforts against the Greeks were not successful, but securing the support  of the Serbs under Stephen Nemanja in 1188 and of the Crusaders in 1189  they became more so; but there was life in the Greeks yet, and victory  alternated with defeat. John Asen I was assassinated in 1196 and was  succeeded after many internal discords and murders by his relative Kaloian  or Pretty John. This cruel and unscrupulous though determined ruler soon  made an end of all his enemies at home, and in eight years achieved such  success abroad that Bulgaria almost regained its former proportions.  Moreover, he re-established relations with Rome, to the great discomfiture  of the Greeks, and after some negotiations Pope Innocent III recognized  Kaloian as _tsar_ of the Bulgars and Vlakhs (roi de Blaquie et de Bougrie,  in the words of Villehardouin), with Basil as primate, and they were both  duly consecrated and crowned by the papal legate at Tirnovo in 1204. The  French, who had just established themselves in Constantinople during the  fourth crusade, imprudently made an enemy of Kaloian instead of a friend,  and with the aid of the Tartar Kumans he defeated them several times,  capturing and brutally murdering Baldwin I. But in 1207 his career was cut  short; he was murdered while besieging Salonika by one of his generals who  was a friend of his wife. After eleven years of further anarchy he was  succeeded by John Asen II. During the reign of this monarch, which lasted  from 1218 till 1241, Bulgaria reached the zenith of its power. He was the  most enlightened ruler the country had had, and he not only waged war  successfully abroad but also put an end to the internal confusion,  restored the possibility of carrying on agriculture and commerce, and  encouraged the foundation of numerous schools and monasteries. He  maintained the tradition of his family by making his capital at Tirnovo,  which city he considerably embellished and enlarged.    Constantinople at this time boasted three Greek emperors and one French.  The first act of John Asen II was to get rid of one of them, named  Theodore, who had proclaimed himself _basileus_ at Okhrida in 1223.  Thereupon he annexed the whole of Thrace, Macedonia, Thessaly, and Epirus  to his dominions, and made Theodore's brother Manuel, who had married one  of his daughters, viceroy, established at Salonika. Another of his  daughters had married Stephen Vladislav, who was King of Serbia from  1233-43, and a third married Theodore, son of the Emperor John III, who  reigned at Nicaea, in 1235. This daughter, after being sought in marriage  by the French barons at Constantinople as a wife for the Emperor Baldwin  II, a minor, was then summarily rejected in favour of the daughter of the  King of Jerusalem; this affront rankled in the mind of John Asen II and  threw him into the arms of the Greeks, with whom he concluded an alliance  in 1234. John Asen II and his ally, the Emperor John III, were, however,  utterly defeated by the French under the walls of Constantinople in 1236,  and the Bulgarian ruler, who had no wish to see the Greeks re-established  there, began to doubt the wisdom of his alliance. Other Bulgarian tsars  had been unscrupulous, but the whole foreign policy of this one pivoted on  treachery. He deserted the Greeks and made an alliance with the French in  1237, the Pope Gregory IX, a great Hellenophobe, having threatened him  with excommunication; he went so far as to force his daughter to  relinquish her Greek husband. The following year, however, he again  changed over to the Greeks; then again fear of the Pope and of his  brother-in-law the King of Hungary brought him back to the side of Baldwin  II, to whose help against the Greeks he went with a large army into Thrace  in 1239. While besieging the Greeks with indifferent success, he learned  of the death of his wife and his eldest son from plague, and incontinently  returned to Tirnovo, giving up the war and restoring his daughter to her  lonely husband. This adaptable monarch died a natural death in 1241, and  the three rulers of his family who succeeded him, whose reigns filled the  period 1241-58, managed to undo all the constructive work of their  immediate predecessors. Province after province was lost and internal  anarchy increased. This remarkable dynasty came to an inglorious end in  1258, when its last representative was murdered by his own nobles, and  from this time onwards Bulgaria was only a shadow of its former self.        9    _The Serbian Supremacy and the Final Collapse,_ 1258-1393      From 1258 onwards Bulgaria may be said to have continued flickering until  its final extinction as a state in 1393, but during this period it never  had any voice in controlling the destinies of the Balkan peninsula. Owing  to the fact that no ruler emerged capable of keeping the distracted  country in order, there was a regular _chasse-croise_ of rival princelets,  an unceasing tale of political marriages and murders, conspiracies and  revolts of feudal nobles all over the country, and perpetual ebb and flow  of the boundaries of the warring principalities which tore the fabric of  Bulgaria to pieces amongst them. From the point of view of foreign  politics this period is characterized generally by the virtual  disappearance of Bulgarian independence to the profit of the surrounding  states, who enjoyed a sort of rotativist supremacy. It is especially  remarkable for the complete ascendancy which Serbia gained in the Balkan  peninsula.    A Serb, Constantine, grandson of Stephen Nemanja, occupied the Bulgarian  throne from 1258 to 1277, and married the granddaughter of John Asen II.  After the fall of the Latin Empire of Constantinople in 1261, the  Hungarians, already masters of Transylvania, combined with the Greeks  against Constantine; the latter called the Tartars of southern Russia, at  this time at the height of their power, to his help and was victorious,  but as a result of his diplomacy the Tartars henceforward played an  important part in the Bulgarian welter. Then Constantine married, as his  second wife, the daughter of the Greek emperor, and thus again gave  Constantinople a voice in his country's affairs. Constantine was followed  by a series of upstart rulers, whose activities were cut short by the  victories of King Uro[)s] II of Serbia (1282-1321), who conquered all  Macedonia and wrested it from the Bulgars. In 1285 the Tartars of the  Golden Horde swept over Hungary and Bulgaria, but it was from the south  that the clouds were rolling up which not much later were to burst over  the peninsula. In 1308 the Turks appeared on the Sea of Marmora, and in  1326 established themselves at Brussa. From 1295 to 1322 Bulgaria was  presided over by a nobleman of Vidin, Svetoslav, who, unmolested by the  Greeks, grown thoughtful in view of the approach of the Turks, was able to  maintain rather more order than his subjects were accustomed to. After his  death in 1322 chaos again supervened. One of his successors had married  the daughter of Uro[)s] II of Serbia, but suddenly made an alliance with  the Greeks against his brother-in-law Stephen Uro[)s] III and dispatched  his wife to her home. During the war which ensued the unwonted allies were  utterly routed by the Serbs at Kustendil in Macedonia in 1330.    From 1331 to 1365 Bulgaria was under one John Alexander, a noble of Tartar  origin, whose sister became the wife of Serbia's greatest ruler, Stephen  Du[)s]an; John Alexander, moreover, recognized Stephen as his suzerain,  and from thenceforward Bulgaria was a vassal-state of Serbia. Meanwhile  the Turkish storm was gathering fast; Suleiman crossed the Hellespont in  1356, and Murad I made Adrianople his capital in 1366. After the death of  John Alexander in 1365 the Hungarians invaded northern Bulgaria, and"]]]
