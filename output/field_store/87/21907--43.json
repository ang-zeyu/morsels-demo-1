Jonathan caught two of the  animals which the Indians had turned loose, and tied them in the  forest. He then started after the three Indians who had gone  northward.    \"Well?\" Colonel Zane said impatiently, when Jonathan hesitated in his  story.    \"One got away,\" he said reluctantly. \"I barked him as he was runnin'  like a streak through the bushes, an' judged that he was hard hit. I  got the hosses, an' turned back on the trail of the white man.\"    \"Where did it end?\"    \"In that hard-packed path near the blacksmith shop. An' the fellar  steps as light as an Injun.\"    \"He's here, then, sure as you're born. We've lost no horses yet, but  last week old Sam heard a noise in the barn, and on going there found  Betty's mare out of her stall.\"    \"Some one as knows the lay of the land had been after her,\" suggested  Jonathan.    \"You can bet on that. We've got to find him before we lose all the  fine horse-flesh we own. Where do these stolen animals go? Indians  would steal any kind; but this thief takes only the best.\"    \"I'm to meet Wetzel on the ridge soon, an' then we'll know, for he's  goin' to find out where the hosses are taken.\"    \"That'll help some. On the way back you found where the white girl had  been taken from. Murdered father, burned cabin, the usual deviltry.\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"Poor Mabel! Do you think this white thief had anything to do with  carrying her away?\"    \"No. Wetzel says that's Bing Legget's work. The Shawnees were members  of his gang.\"    \"Well, Jack, what'll I do?\"    \"Keep quiet an' wait,\" was the borderman's answer.    Colonel Zane, old pioneer and frontiersman though he was, shuddered as  he went to his room. His brother's dark look, and his deadly calmness,  were significant.          CHAPTER IV    To those few who saw Jonathan Zane in the village, it seemed as if he  was in his usual quiet and dreamy state. The people were accustomed to  his silence, and long since learned that what little time he spent in  the settlement was not given to sociability. In the morning he  sometimes lay with Colonel Zane's dog, Chief, by the side of a spring  under an elm tree, and in the afternoon strolled aimlessly along the  river bluff, or on the hillside. At night he sat on his brother's  porch smoking a long Indian pipe. Since that day, now a week past,  when he had returned with the stolen horses, his movements and habits  were precisely what would have been expected of an unsuspicious  borderman.    In reality, however, Jonathan was not what he seemed. He knew all that  was going on in the settlement. Hardly a bird could have entered the  clearing unobserved.    At night, after all the villagers were in bed, he stole cautiously  about the stockade, silencing with familiar word the bristling  watch-hounds, and went from barn to barn, ending his stealthy tramp at  the corral where Colonel Zane kept his thoroughbreds.    But all this scouting by night availed nothing. No unusual event  occurred, not even the barking of a dog, a suspicious rustling among  the thickets, or whistling of a night-hawk had been heard.    Vainly the borderman strained ears to catch some low night-signal  given by waiting Indians to the white traitor within the settlement.  By day there was even less to attract the sharp-eyed watcher. The  clumsy river boats, half raft, half sawn lumber, drifted down the Ohio  on their first and last voyage, discharged their cargoes of grain,  liquor, or merchandise, and were broken up. Their crews came back on  the long overland journey to Fort Pitt, there to man another craft.  The garrison at the fort performed their customary duties; the  pioneers tilled the fields; the blacksmith scattered sparks, the  wheelwright worked industriously at his bench, and the housewives  attended to their many cares. No strangers arrived at Fort Henry. The  quiet life of the village was uninterrupted.    Near sunset of a long day Jonathan strolled down the sandy,  well-trodden path toward Metzar's inn. He did not drink, and  consequently seldom visited the rude, dark, ill-smelling bar-room.  When occasion demanded his presence there, he was evidently not  welcome. The original owner, a sturdy soldier and pioneer, came to  Fort Henry when Colonel Zane founded the settlement, and had been  killed during Girty's last attack. His successor, another Metzar, was,  according to Jonathan's belief, as bad as the whiskey he dispensed.  More than one murder had been committed at the inn; countless fatal  knife and tomahawk fights had stained red the hard clay floor; and  more than one desperate character had been harbored there. Once  Colonel Zane sent Wetzel there to invite a thief and outlaw to quit  the settlement, with the not unexpected result that it became  necessary the robber be carried out.    Jonathan thought of the bad name the place bore all over the frontier,  and wondered if Metzar could tell anything about the horse-thieves.  When the borderman bent his tall frame to enter the low-studded door  he fancied he saw a dark figure disappear into a room just behind the  bar. A roughly-clad, heavily-bearded man turned hastily at the  same moment.    \"Hullo,\" he said gruffly.    \"H' are you, Metzar. I just dropped in to see if I could make a trade  for your sorrel mare,\" replied Jonathan. Being well aware that the  innkeeper would not part with his horse, the borderman had made this  announcement as his reason for entering the bar-room.    \"Nope, I'll allow you can't,\" replied Metzar.    As he turned to go, Jonathan's eyes roamed around the bar-room.  Several strangers of shiftless aspect bleared at him.    \"They wouldn't steal a pumpkin,\" muttered Jonathan to himself as he  left the inn. Then he added suspiciously, \"Metzar was talkin' to some  one, an' 'peared uneasy. I never liked Metzar. He'll bear watchin'.\"    The borderman passed on down the path thinking of what he had heard  against Metzar. The colonel had said that the man was prosperous for  an innkeeper who took pelts, grain or meat in exchange for rum. The  village gossips disliked him because he was unmarried, taciturn, and  did not care for their company. Jonathan reflected also on the fact  that Indians were frequently coming to the inn, and this made him  distrustful of the proprietor. It was true that Colonel Zane had  red-skinned visitors, but there was always good reason for their  coming. Jonathan had seen, during the Revolution, more than one  trusted man proven to be a traitor, and the conviction settled upon  him that some quiet scouting would show up the innkeeper as aiding the  horse-thieves if not actually in league with them.    \"Good evening, Jonathan Zane.\"    This greeting in a woman's clear voice brought Jonathan out from his  reveries. He glanced up to see Helen Sheppard standing in the doorway  of her father's cabin.    \"Evenin', miss,\" he said with a bow, and would have passed on.    \"Wait,\" she cried, and stepped out of the door.    He waited by the gate with a manner which showed that such a summons  was novel to him.    Helen, piqued at his curt greeting, had asked him to wait without any  idea of what she would say. Coming slowly down the path she felt again  a subtle awe of this borderman. Regretting her impulsiveness, she lost  confidence.    Gaining the gate she looked up intending to speak; but was unable to  do so as she saw how cold and grave was his face, and how piercing  were his eyes. She flushed slightly, and then, conscious of an  embarrassment new and strange to her, blushed rosy red, making, as it  seemed to her, a stupid remark about the sunset. When he took her  words literally, and said the sunset was fine, she felt guilty of  deceitfulness. Whatever Helen's faults, and they were many, she was  honest, and because of not having looked at the sunset, but only  wanting him to see her as did other men, the innocent ruse suddenly  appeared mean and trifling.    Then, with a woman's quick intuition, she understood that coquetries  were lost on this borderman, and, with a smile, got the better of her  embarrassment and humiliation by telling the truth.    \"I wanted to ask a favor of you, and I'm a little afraid.\"    She spoke with girlish shyness, which increased as he stared at her.    \"Why--why do you look at me so?\"    \"There's a lake over yonder which the Shawnees say is haunted by a  woman they killed,\" he replied quietly. \"You'd do for her spirit, so  white an' beautiful in the silver moonlight.\"    \"So my white dress makes me look ghostly,\" she answered lightly,  though deeply conscious of surprise and pleasure at such an unexpected  reply from him. This borderman might be full of surprises. \"Such a  time as I had bringing my dresses out here! I don't know when I can  wear them. This is the simplest one.\"    \"An' it's mighty new an' bewilderin' for the border,\" he replied with  a smile in his eyes.    \"When these are gone I'll get no more except linsey ones,\" she said  brightly, yet her eyes shone with a wistful uncertainty of the future.    \"Will you be happy here?\"    \"I am happy. I have always wanted to be of some use in the world. I  assure you, Master Zane, I am not the butterfly I seem. I have worked  hard all day, that is, until your sister Betty came over. All the  girls have helped me fix up the cabin until it's more comfortable than  I ever dreamed one could be on the frontier. Father is well content  here, and that makes me happy. I haven't had time for forebodings. The  young men of Fort Henry have been--well, attentive; in fact, they've  been here all the time.\"    She laughed a little at this last remark, and looked demurely at him.    \"It's a frontier custom,\" he said.    \"Oh, indeed? Do all the young men call often and stay late?\"    \"They do.\"    \"You didn't,\" she retorted. \"You're the only one who hasn't been to  see me.\"    \"I do not wait on the girls,\" he replied with a grave smile.    \"Oh, you don't? Do you expect them "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9935"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 1: Essentials of Cookery; Cereals; (#6)"],[1,"foods  will assist in softening them.    Water is used in cooking chiefly for extracting flavors, as in the  making of coffee, tea, and soups; as a medium for carrying flavors and  foods in such beverages as lemonade and cocoa; for softening both  vegetable and animal fiber; and for cooking starch and dissolving sugar,  salt, gelatine, etc. In accomplishing much of this work, water acts as a  medium for conveying heat.    37. BOILING.--As applied to cooking, boiling means cooking foods in  boiling water. Water boils when its temperature is raised by heat to  what is commonly termed its _boiling point_. This varies with the  atmospheric pressure, but at sea level, under ordinary conditions, it is  always 212 degrees Fahrenheit. When the atmospheric pressure on the  surface of the water is lessened, boiling takes place at a lower  temperature than that mentioned, and in extremely high altitudes the  boiling point is so lowered that to cook certain foods by means of  boiling water is difficult. As the water heats in the process of  boiling, tiny bubbles appear on the bottom of the vessel in which it is  contained and rise to the surface. Then, gradually, the bubbles increase  in size until large ones form, rise rapidly, and break, thus producing  constant agitation of the water.    38. Boiling has various effects on foods. It toughens the albumin in  eggs, toughens the fiber and dissolves the connective tissues in meat,  softens the cellulose in cereals, vegetables, and fruits, and dissolves  other substances in many foods. A good point to bear in mind in  preparing foods by boiling is that slowly boiling water has the same  temperature as rapidly boiling water and is therefore able to do exactly  the same work. Keeping the gas burning full heat or running the fire  hard to keep the water boiling rapidly is therefore unnecessary;  besides, it wastes fuel without doing the work any faster and sometimes  not so well. However, there are several factors that influence the  rapidity with which water may be brought to the boiling point; namely,  the kind of utensil used, the amount of surface exposed, and the  quantity of heat applied. A cover placed on a saucepan or a kettle in  which food is to be boiled retains the heat, and thus causes the  temperature to rise more quickly; besides, a cover so used prevents a  loss of water by condensing the steam as it rises against the cover. As  water boils, some of it constantly passes off in the form of steam, and  for this reason sirups or sauces become thicker the longer they are  cooked. The evaporation takes place all over the surface of the water;  consequently, the greater the surface exposed, the more quickly is the  quantity of water decreased during boiling. Another point to observe in  the boiling process is that foods boiled rapidly in water have a  tendency to lose their shape and are reduced to small pieces if allowed  to boil long enough.    Besides serving to cook foods, boiling also renders water safe, as it  destroys any germs that may be present. This explains why water must  sometimes be boiled to make it safe for drinking. Boiled water, as is  known, loses its good taste. However, as this change is brought about by  the loss of air during boiling, the flavor can be restored and air again  introduced if the water is shaken in a partly filled jar or bottle, or  beaten vigorously for a short time with an egg beater.    39. SIMMERING, OR STEWING.--The cooking process known as simmering, or  stewing, is a modification of boiling. By this method, food is cooked in  water at a temperature below the boiling point, or anywhere from 185 to  200 degrees Fahrenheit. Water at the simmering point always moves  gently--never rapidly as it does in boiling. Less heat and consequently  less fuel are required to cook foods in this way, unless, of course, the  time consumed in cooking the food at a low temperature is much greater  than that consumed in cooking it more rapidly.    Aside from permitting economy in the use of fuel, simmering, or stewing,  cooks deliciously certain foods that could not be selected for the more  rapid methods. For example, tough cuts of meat and old fowl can be made  tender and tasty by long cooking at a low temperature, for this method  tends to soften the fiber and to develop an excellent flavor. Tough  vegetables, too, can be cooked tender by the simmering process without  using so much fuel as would be used if they were boiled, for whatever  method is used they require long cooking. Beets, turnips, and other  winter vegetables should be stewed rather than boiled, as it is somewhat  difficult to cook them tender, especially in the late winter and early  spring. If dry beans and peas are brought to the simmering point and  then allowed to cook, they can be prepared for the table in practically  the same length of time and without so much fuel as if they boiled  continuously.    40. STEAMING.--As its name implies, steaming is the cooking of food by  the application of steam. In this cooking process, the food is put into  a _steamer_, which is a cooking utensil that consists of a vessel with a  perforated bottom placed over one containing water. As the water boils,  steam rises and cooks the food in the upper, or perforated, vessel.  Steamers are sometimes arranged with a number of perforated vessels, one  on top of the other. Such a steamer permits of the cooking of several  foods at the same time without the need of additional fuel, because a  different food may be placed in each vessel.    Steaming is preferable to boiling in some cases, because by it there is  no loss of mineral salts nor food substances; besides, the flavor is not  so likely to be lost as when food is boiled. Vegetables prepared in this  way prove very palatable, and very often variety is added to the diet by  steaming bread, cake, and pudding mixtures and then, provided a crisp  outside is desired, placing them in a hot oven to dry out the  moist surface.    41. DRY STEAMING.--Cooking foods in a vessel that is suspended in  another one containing boiling water constitutes the cooking method  known as dry steaming. The double boiler is a cooking utensil devised  especially for carrying on this process. The food placed in the  suspended, or inner, vessel does not reach the boiling point, but is  cooked by the transfer of heat from the water in the outside, or lower,  vessel. A decided advantage of this method is that no watching is  required except to see that the water in the lower vessel does not boil  away completely, for as long as there is water between the food and the  fire, the food will neither boil nor burn.    Because of the nature of certain foods, cooking them by this process is  especially desirable. The flavor and consistency of cereals and foods  containing starch are greatly improved by long cooking in this way.  Likewise, custards and mixtures containing eggs can be conveniently  cooked in a double boiler, because they do not require a high  temperature; in fact, their texture is spoiled if they are cooked at the  boiling point. To heat milk directly over the flame without scorching it  is a difficult matter, and, on the other hand, boiled milk is hard to  digest. Because of these facts, food containing milk should not be  boiled, but should be cooked at a lower temperature in a double boiler.    42. BRAIZING.--Cooking meat in an oven in a closed pan with a small  quantity of water constitutes braizing. This cooking process might be  called a combination of stewing and baking, but when it is properly  carried out, the meat is placed on a rack so as to be raised above the  water, in which may be placed sliced vegetables. In this process the  meat actually cooks in the flavored steam that surrounds it in the hot  pan. The so-called double roasting pans are in fact braizing pans when  they are properly used. A pot roast is the result of a modification of  the braizing method.      COOKING WITH HOT FAT    43. Of the three mediums of conveying heat to food, namely, hot air, hot  water, and hot fat, that of hot fat renders food the least digestible.  Much of this difficulty, however, can be overcome if an effort is made  to secure as little absorption of the fat as possible. If the  ingredients of the food are properly mixed before applying the fat and  if the fat is at the right temperature, good results can be obtained by  the various methods of cooking with hot fat, which are frying, sauteing,  and fricasseeing.    44. FRYING.--By frying is meant the cooking of food in deep fat at a  temperature of 350 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Any kind of fat that will  not impart flavor to the food may be used for frying, but the vegetable  oils, such as cottonseed oils, combinations of coconut and cottonseed  oils, and nut oils, are preferable to lards and other animal fats,  because they do not burn so easily. Foods cooked in deep fat will not  absorb the fat nor become greasy if they are properly prepared, quickly  fried, and well drained on paper that will absorb any extra fat.    45. SAUTEING.--Browning food first on one side and then on the other in  a small quantity of fat is termed sauteing. In this cooking process, the  fat is placed in a shallow pan, and when it is sufficiently hot, the  food is put into it. Foods that are to be sauted are usually sliced thin  or cut into small pieces, and they are turned frequently during the  process of cooking. All foods prepared in this way are difficult to  digest, because they become more or less hard and soaked with fat. Chops  and thin cuts of meat, which are intended to be pan-broiled, are really  sauted if they are allowed to cook in the fat that fries out of them.    46. FRICASSEEING.--A combination of sauteing and stewing results in the  cooking process known as fricasseeing. This process is used in preparing  such foods as chicken, veal, or game, but it is more frequently employed  for cooking fowl, which, in"]]]
