I now began  to reason that my situation was in the last degree serious, dream  or no dream; for I knew by past experience of the lifelike intensity  of dreams, that to be burned to death, even in a dream, would be  very far from being a jest, and was a thing to be avoided, by any  means, fair or foul, that I could contrive.  So I said beseechingly:    \"Ah, Clarence, good boy, only friend I've got,--for you _are_ my  friend, aren't you?--don't fail me; help me to devise some way  of escaping from this place!\"    \"Now do but hear thyself!  Escape?  Why, man, the corridors are  in guard and keep of men-at-arms.\"    \"No doubt, no doubt.  But how many, Clarence?  Not many, I hope?\"    \"Full a score.  One may not hope to escape.\"  After a pause  --hesitatingly: \"and there be other reasons--and weightier.\"    \"Other ones? What are they?\"    \"Well, they say--oh, but I daren't, indeed daren't!\"    \"Why, poor lad, what is the matter?  Why do you blench?  Why do  you tremble so?\"    \"Oh, in sooth, there is need!  I do want to tell you, but--\"    \"Come, come, be brave, be a man--speak out, there's a good lad!\"    He hesitated, pulled one way by desire, the other way by fear;  then he stole to the door and peeped out, listening; and finally  crept close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his  fearful news in a whisper, and with all the cowering apprehension  of one who was venturing upon awful ground and speaking of things  whose very mention might be freighted with death.    \"Merlin, in his malice, has woven a spell about this dungeon, and  there bides not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate  enough to essay to cross its lines with you!  Now God pity me,  I have told it!  Ah, be kind to me, be merciful to a poor boy who  means thee well; for an thou betray me I am lost!\"    I laughed the only really refreshing laugh I had had for some time;  and shouted:    \"Merlin has wrought a spell!  _Merlin_, forsooth!  That cheap old  humbug, that maundering old ass?  Bosh, pure bosh, the silliest bosh  in the world!  Why, it does seem to me that of all the childish,  idiotic, chuckle-headed, chicken-livered superstitions that ev  --oh, damn Merlin!\"    But Clarence had slumped to his knees before I had half finished,  and he was like to go out of his mind with fright.    \"Oh, beware!  These are awful words!  Any moment these walls  may crumble upon us if you say such things.  Oh call them back  before it is too late!\"    Now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to  thinking.  If everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely  afraid of Merlin's pretended magic as Clarence was, certainly  a superior man like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrive  some way to take advantage of such a state of things.  I went  on thinking, and worked out a plan. Then I said:    \"Get up.  Pull yourself together; look me in the eye.  Do you  know why I laughed?\"    \"No--but for our blessed Lady's sake, do it no more.\"    \"Well, I'll tell you why I laughed.  Because I'm a magician myself.\"    \"Thou!\"  The boy recoiled a step, and caught his breath, for  the thing hit him rather sudden; but the aspect which he took  on was very, very respectful.  I took quick note of that; it  indicated that a humbug didn't need to have a reputation in this  asylum; people stood ready to take him at his word, without that.  I resumed.    \"I've known Merlin seven hundred years, and he--\"    \"Seven hun--\"    \"Don't interrupt me.  He has died and come alive again thirteen  times, and traveled under a new name every time: Smith, Jones,  Robinson, Jackson, Peters, Haskins, Merlin--a new alias every  time he turns up.  I knew him in Egypt three hundred years ago;  I knew him in India five hundred years ago--he is always blethering  around in my way, everywhere I go; he makes me tired.  He don't  amount to shucks, as a magician; knows some of the old common  tricks, but has never got beyond the rudiments, and never will.  He is well enough for the provinces--one-night stands and that  sort of thing, you know--but dear me, _he_ oughtn't to set up for  an expert--anyway not where there's a real artist.  Now look here,  Clarence, I am going to stand your friend, right along, and in  return you must be mine.  I want you to do me a favor.  I want  you to get word to the king that I am a magician myself--and the  Supreme Grand High-yu-Muck-amuck and head of the tribe, at that;  and I want him to be made to understand that I am just quietly  arranging a little calamity here that will make the fur fly in these  realms if Sir Kay's project is carried out and any harm comes  to me.  Will you get that to the king for me?\"    The poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me.  It was pitiful to see a creature so terrified, so unnerved, so  demoralized.  But he promised everything; and on my side he made  me promise over and over again that I would remain his friend, and  never turn against him or cast any enchantments upon him. Then  he worked his way out, staying himself with his hand along the  wall, like a sick person.    Presently this thought occurred to me: how heedless I have been!  When the boy gets calm, he will wonder why a great magician like me  should have begged a boy like him to help me get out of this place;  he will put this and that together, and will see that I am a humbug.    I worried over that heedless blunder for an hour, and called myself  a great many hard names, meantime.  But finally it occurred to me  all of a sudden that these animals didn't reason; that _they_ never  put this and that together; that all their talk showed that they  didn't know a discrepancy when they saw it.  I was at rest, then.    But as soon as one is at rest, in this world, off he goes on  something else to worry about.  It occurred to me that I had made  another blunder: I had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with  a threat--I intending to invent a calamity at my leisure; now  the people who are the readiest and eagerest and willingest to  swallow miracles are the very ones who are hungriest to see you  perform them; suppose I should be called on for a sample?  Suppose  I should be asked to name my calamity?  Yes, I had made a blunder;  I ought to have invented my calamity first.  \"What shall I do?  what can I say, to gain a little time?\"  I was in trouble again;  in the deepest kind of trouble...    \"There's a footstep!--they're coming.  If I had only just a moment  to think....  Good, I've got it.  I'm all right.\"    You see, it was the eclipse.  It came into my mind in the nick  of time, how Columbus, or Cortez, or one of those people, played  an eclipse as a saving trump once, on some savages, and I saw my  chance.  I could play it myself, now, and it wouldn't be any  plagiarism, either, because I should get it in nearly a thousand  years ahead of those parties.    Clarence came in, subdued, distressed, and said:    \"I hasted the message to our liege the king, and straightway he  had me to his presence.  He was frighted even to the marrow,  and was minded to give order for your instant enlargement, and  that you be clothed in fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so  great; but then came Merlin and spoiled all; for he persuaded  the king that you are mad, and know not whereof you speak; and  said your threat is but foolishness and idle vaporing.  They  disputed long, but in the end, Merlin, scoffing, said, 'Wherefore  hath he not _named_ his brave calamity?  Verily it is because he  cannot.'  This thrust did in a most sudden sort close the king's  mouth, and he could offer naught to turn the argument; and so,  reluctant, and full loth to do you the discourtesy, he yet prayeth  you to consider his perplexed case, as noting how the matter stands,  and name the calamity--if so be you have determined the nature  of it and the time of its coming.  Oh, prithee delay not; to delay  at such a time were to double and treble the perils that already  compass thee about.  Oh, be thou wise--name the calamity!\"    I allowed silence to accumulate while I got my impressiveness  together, and then said:    \"How long have I been shut up in this hole?\"    \"Ye were shut up when yesterday was well spent.  It is 9 of  the morning now.\"    \"No!  Then I have slept well, sure enough.  Nine in the morning  now!  And yet it is the very complexion of midnight, to a shade.  This is the 20th, then?\"    \"The 20th--yes.\"    \"And I am to be burned alive to-morrow.\"  The boy shuddered.    \"At what hour?\"    \"At high noon.\"    \"Now then, I will tell you what to say.\"  I paused, and stood over  that cowering lad a whole minute in awful silence; then, in a voice  deep, measured, charged with doom, I began, and rose by dramatically  graded stages to my colossal climax, which I delivered in as sublime  and noble a way as ever I did such a thing in my life: \"Go back  and tell the king that at that hour I will smother the whole world  in the dead blackness of midnight; I will blot out the sun, and he  shall never shine again; the fruits of the earth shall rot for lack  of light and warmth, and the peoples of the earth shall famish  and die, to the last man!\"    I had to carry the boy out myself, he sunk into such a collapse.  I handed him over to the soldiers, and went back.        CHAPTER VI    THE ECLIPSE    In the stillness and the darkness, realization soon began to  supplement knowledge.  The mere knowledge of a fact is pale; but  when you come to _realize_ your fact, it takes on color. It is  all the difference between hearing of a man being stabbed to  the heart, and seeing it done.  In the stillness and the darkness,  the knowledge that I was in deadly danger took to itself deeper  and deeper meaning all the time; a something which was realization  crept inch by inch through my veins and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7243"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 2. (#6)"],[1,"things, and not waste time with  useless fretting, but get down to business and see what can be  done.  In all lies there is wheat among the chaff; I must get at  the wheat in this case: so I sent for the girl and she came.  She  was a comely enough creature, and soft and modest, but, if signs  went for anything, she didn't know as much as a lady's watch.  I said:    \"My dear, have you been questioned as to particulars?\"    She said she hadn't.    \"Well, I didn't expect you had, but I thought I would ask, to make  sure; it's the way I've been raised.  Now you mustn't take it  unkindly if I remind you that as we don't know you, we must go  a little slow.  You may be all right, of course, and we'll hope  that you are; but to take it for granted isn't business.  _You_  understand that.  I'm obliged to ask you a few questions; just  answer up fair and square, and don't be afraid.  Where do you  live, when you are at home?\"    \"In the land of Moder, fair sir.\"    \"Land of Moder.  I don't remember hearing of it before.  Parents living?\"    \"As to that, I know not if they be yet on live, sith it is many  years that I have lain shut up in the castle.\"    \"Your name, please?\"    \"I hight the Demoiselle Alisande la Carteloise, an it please you.\"    \"Do you know anybody here who can identify you?\"    \"That were not likely, fair lord, I being come hither now for  the first time.\"    \"Have you brought any letters--any documents--any proofs that  you are trustworthy and truthful?\"    \"Of a surety, no; and wherefore should I?  Have I not a tongue,  and cannot I say all that myself?\"    \"But _your_ saying it, you know, and somebody else's saying it,  is different.\"    \"Different?  How might that be?  I fear me I do not understand.\"    \"Don't _understand_?  Land of--why, you see--you see--why, great Scott,  can't you understand a little thing like that?  Can't you understand  the difference between your--_why_ do you look so innocent and idiotic!\"    \"I?  In truth I know not, but an it were the will of God.\"    \"Yes, yes, I reckon that's about the size of it.  Don't mind my  seeming excited; I'm not.  Let us change the subject.  Now as  to this castle, with forty-five princesses in it, and three ogres  at the head of it, tell me--where is this harem?\"    \"Harem?\"    \"The _castle_, you understand; where is the castle?\"    \"Oh, as to that, it is great, and strong, and well beseen, and  lieth in a far country.  Yes, it is many leagues.\"    \"_How_ many?\"    \"Ah, fair sir, it were woundily hard to tell, they are so many,  and do so lap the one upon the other, and being made all in the  same image and tincted with the same color, one may not know  the one league from its fellow, nor how to count them except  they be taken apart, and ye wit well it were God's work to do  that, being not within man's capacity; for ye will note--\"    \"Hold on, hold on, never mind about the distance; _whereabouts_  does the castle lie?  What's the direction from here?\"    \"Ah, please you sir, it hath no direction from here; by reason  that the road lieth not straight, but turneth evermore; wherefore  the direction of its place abideth not, but is some time under  the one sky and anon under another, whereso if ye be minded that  it is in the east, and wend thitherward, ye shall observe that  the way of the road doth yet again turn upon itself by the space  of half a circle, and this marvel happing again and yet again and  still again, it will grieve you that you had thought by vanities  of the mind to thwart and bring to naught the will of Him that  giveth not a castle a direction from a place except it pleaseth  Him, and if it please Him not, will the rather that even all castles  and all directions thereunto vanish out of the earth, leaving the  places wherein they tarried desolate and vacant, so warning His  creatures that where He will He will, and where He will not He--\"    \"Oh, that's all right, that's all right, give us a rest; never mind  about the direction, _hang_ the direction--I beg pardon, I beg  a thousand pardons, I am not well to-day; pay no attention when  I soliloquize, it is an old habit, an old, bad habit, and hard  to get rid of when one's digestion is all disordered with eating  food that was raised forever and ever before he was born; good  land! a man can't keep his functions regular on spring chickens  thirteen hundred years old.  But come--never mind about that;  let's--have you got such a thing as a map of that region about  you?  Now a good map--\"    \"Is it peradventure that manner of thing which of late the unbelievers  have brought from over the great seas, which, being boiled in oil,  and an onion and salt added thereto, doth--\"    \"What, a map?  What are you talking about?  Don't you know what  a map is?  There, there, never mind, don't explain, I hate  explanations; they fog a thing up so that you can't tell anything  about it.  Run along, dear; good-day; show her the way, Clarence.\"    Oh, well, it was reasonably plain, now, why these donkeys didn't  prospect these liars for details.  It may be that this girl had  a fact in her somewhere, but I don't believe you could have sluiced  it out with a hydraulic; nor got it with the earlier forms of  blasting, even; it was a case for dynamite.  Why, she was a perfect  ass; and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if  she had been a leaf out of the gospel.  It kind of sizes up the  whole party.  And think of the simple ways of this court: this  wandering wench hadn't any more trouble to get access to the king  in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse  in my day and country.  In fact, he was glad to see her, glad  to hear her tale; with that adventure of hers to offer, she was  as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner.    Just as I was ending-up these reflections, Clarence came back.  I remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl;  hadn't got hold of a single point that could help me to find  the castle.  The youth looked a little surprised, or puzzled,  or something, and intimated that he had been wondering to himself  what I had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for.    \"Why, great guns,\" I said, \"don't I want to find the castle?  And  how else would I go about it?\"    \"La, sweet your worship, one may lightly answer that, I ween.  She will go with thee.  They always do.  She will ride with thee.\"    \"Ride with me?  Nonsense!\"    \"But of a truth she will.  She will ride with thee.  Thou shalt see.\"    \"What?  She browse around the hills and scour the woods with me  --alone--and I as good as engaged to be married?  Why, it's scandalous.  Think how it would look.\"    My, the dear face that rose before me!  The boy was eager to know  all about this tender matter.  I swore him to secrecy and then  whispered her name--\"Puss Flanagan.\"  He looked disappointed,  and said he didn't remember the countess.  How natural it was for  the little courtier to give her a rank.  He asked me where she lived.    \"In East Har--\" I came to myself and stopped, a little confused;  then I said, \"Never mind, now; I'll tell you some time.\"    And might he see her?  Would I let him see her some day?    It was but a little thing to promise--thirteen hundred years  or so--and he so eager; so I said Yes.  But I sighed; I couldn't  help it.  And yet there was no sense in sighing, for she wasn't  born yet.  But that is the way we are made: we don't reason,  where we feel; we just feel.    My expedition was all the talk that day and that night, and the  boys were very good to me, and made much of me, and seemed to have  forgotten their vexation and disappointment, and come to be as  anxious for me to hive those ogres and set those ripe old virgins  loose as if it were themselves that had the contract.  Well, they  _were_ good children--but just children, that is all.  And they  gave me no end of points about how to scout for giants, and how  to scoop them in; and they told me all sorts of charms against  enchantments, and gave me salves and other rubbish to put on my  wounds.  But it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if  I was such a wonderful necromancer as I was pretending to be,  I ought not to need salves or instructions, or charms against  enchantments, and, least of all, arms and armor, on a foray of any  kind--even against fire-spouting dragons, and devils hot from  perdition, let alone such poor adversaries as these I was after,  these commonplace ogres of the back settlements.    I was to have an early breakfast, and start at dawn, for that was  the usual way; but I had the demon's own time with my armor,  and this delayed me a little.  It is troublesome to get into, and  there is so much detail.  First you wrap a layer or two of blanket  around your body, for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold  iron; then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail--these  are made of small steel links woven together, and they form a fabric  so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor, it slumps  into a pile like a peck of wet fish-net; it is very heavy and  is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night  shirt, yet plenty used it for that--tax collectors, and reformers,  and one-horse kings with a defective title, and those sorts of  people; then you put on your shoes--flat-boats roofed over with  interleaving bands of steel--and screw your clumsy spurs into  the heels.  Next you buckle your greaves on your legs, and your  cuisses on your thighs; then come your backplate and your breastplate,  and you begin to feel crowded; then you hitch onto the breastplate  the half-petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs  down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down,  and isn't any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle, either  for looks or for wear, or to wipe your hands on; next you belt  on your sword; then you put your stove-pipe joints onto your arms,  your iron"]]]
