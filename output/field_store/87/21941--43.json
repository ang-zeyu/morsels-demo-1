Now, though I have spoken  of this journey down the passage as though it were a mile long, and  though it verily seemed so to me that night, yet I afterwards found it  was not more than twenty yards or thereabouts; and then I came upon a  stone wall which had once blocked the road, but was now broken through so  as to make a ragged doorway into a chamber beyond. There I stood on the  rough sill of the door, holding my breath and reaching out my candle  arm's-length into the darkness, to see what sort of a place this was  before I put foot into it. And before the light had well time to fall on  things, I knew that I was underneath the church, and that this chamber  was none other than the Mohune Vault.    It was a large room, much larger, I think, than the schoolroom where Mr.  Glennie taught us, but not near so high, being only some nine feet from  floor to roof. I say floor, though in reality there was none, but only a  bottom of soft wet sand; and when I stepped down on to it my heart beat  very fiercely, for I remembered what manner of place I was entering, and  the dreadful sounds which had issued from it that Sunday morning so short  a time before. I satisfied myself that there was nothing evil lurking in  the dark corners, or nothing visible at least, and then began to look  round and note what was to be seen. Walls and roof were stone, and at one  end was a staircase closed by a great flat stone at top--that same stone  which I had often seen, with a ring in it, in the floor of the church  above. All round the sides were stone shelves, with divisions between  them like great bookcases, but instead of books there were the coffins of  the Mohunes. Yet these lay only at the sides, and in the middle of the  room was something very different, for here were stacked scores of casks,  kegs, and runlets, from a storage butt that might hold thirty gallons  down to a breaker that held only one. They were marked all of them in  white paint on the end with figures and letters, that doubtless set forth  the quality to those that understood. Here indeed was a discovery, and  instead of picking up at the end of the passage a little brass or silver  casket, which had only to be opened to show Blackbeard's diamond gleaming  inside, I had stumbled on the Mohunes' vault, and found it to be nothing  but a cellar of gentlemen of the contraband, for surely good liquor would  never be stored in so shy a place if it ever had paid the excise.    As I walked round this stack of casks my foot struck sharply on the edge  of a butt, which must have been near empty, and straightway came from it  the same hollow, booming sound (only fainter) which had so frightened us  in church that Sunday morning. So it was the casks, and not the coffins,  that had been knocking one against another; and I was pleased with  myself, remembering how I had reasoned that coffin-wood could never give  that booming sound.    It was plain enough that the whole place had been under water: the floor  was still muddy, and the green and sweating walls showed the flood-mark  within two feet of the roof; there was a wisp or two of fine seaweed that  had somehow got in, and a small crab was still alive and scuttled across  the corner, yet the coffins were but little disturbed. They lay on the  shelves in rows, one above the other, and numbered twenty-three in all:  most were in lead, and so could never float, but of those in wood some  were turned slantways in their niches, and one had floated right away and  been left on the floor upside down in a corner when the waters went back.    First I fell to wondering as to whose cellar this was, and how so much  liquor could have been brought in with secrecy; and how it was I had  never seen anything of the contraband-men, though it was clear that they  had made this flat tomb the entrance to their storehouse, as I had made  it my seat. And then I remembered how Ratsey had tried to scare me with  talk of Blackbeard; and how Elzevir, who had never been seen at church  before, was there the Sunday of the noises; and how he had looked ill at  ease whenever the noise came, though he was bold as a lion; and how I had  tripped upon him and Ratsey in the churchyard; and how Master Ratsey lay  with his ear to the wall: and putting all these things together and  casting them up, I thought that Elzevir and Ratsey knew as much as any  about this hiding-place. These reflections gave me more courage, for I  considered that the tales of Blackbeard walking or digging among the  graves had been set afloat to keep those that were not wanted from the  place, and guessed now that when I saw the light moving in the churchyard  that night I went to fetch Dr. Hawkins, it was no corpse-candle, but a  lantern of smugglers running a cargo. Then, having settled these  important matters, I began to turn over in my mind how to get at the  treasure; and herein was much cast down, for in this place was neither  casket nor diamond, but only coffins and double-Hollands. So it was that,  having no better plan, I set to work to see whether I could learn  anything from the coffins themselves; but with little success, for the  lead coffins had no names upon them, and on such of the wooden coffins as  bore plates I found the writing to be Latin, and so rusted over that I  could make nothing of it.    Soon I wished I had not come at all, considering that the diamond had  vanished into air, and it was a sad thing to be cabined with so many dead  men. It moved me, too, to see pieces of banners and funeral shields, and  even shreds of wreaths that dear hearts had put there a century ago, now  all ruined and rotten--some still clinging, water-sodden, to the coffins,  and some trampled in the sand of the floor. I had spent some time in this  bootless search, and was resolved to give up further inquiry and foot it  home, when the clock in the tower struck midnight. Surely never was  ghostly hour sounded in more ghostly place. Moonfleet peal was known over  half the county, and the finest part of it was the clock bell. 'Twas said  that in times past (when, perhaps, the chimes were rung more often than  now) the voice of this bell had led safe home boats that were lost in the  fog; and this night its clangour, mellow and profound, reached even to  the vault. Bim-bom it went, bim-bom, twelve heavy thuds that shook the  walls, twelve resonant echoes that followed, and then a purring and  vibration of the air, so that the ear could not tell when it ended.    I was wrought up, perhaps, by the strangeness of the hour and place, and  my hearing quicker than at other times, but before the tremor of the bell  was quite passed away I knew there was some other sound in the air, and  that the awful stillness of the vault was broken. At first I could not  tell what this new sound was, nor whence it came, and now it seemed a  little noise close by, and now a great noise in the distance. And then it  grew nearer and more defined, and in a moment I knew it was the sound of  voices talking. They must have been a long way off at first, and for a  minute, that seemed as an age, they came no nearer. What a minute was  that to me! Even now, so many years after, I can recall the anguish of  it, and how I stood with ears pricked up, eyes starting, and a clammy  sweat upon my face, waiting for those speakers to come. It was the  anguish of the rabbit at the end of his burrow, with the ferret's eyes  gleaming in the dark, and gun and lurcher waiting at the mouth of the  hole. I was caught in a trap, and knew beside that contraband-men had a  way of sealing prying eyes and stilling babbling tongues; and I  remembered poor Cracky Jones found dead in the churchyard, and how men  _said_ he had met Blackbeard in the night.    These were but the thoughts of a second, but the voices were nearer, and  I heard a dull thud far up the passage, and knew that a man had jumped  down from the churchyard into the hole. So I took a last stare round,  agonizing to see if there was any way of escape; but the stone walls and  roof were solid enough to crush me, and the stack of casks too closely  packed to hide more than a rat. There was a man speaking now from the  bottom of the hole to others in the churchyard, and then my eyes were led  as by a loadstone to a great wooden coffin that lay by itself on the top  shelf, a full six feet from the ground. When I saw the coffin I knew that  I was respited, for, as I judged, there was space between it and the wall  behind enough to contain my little carcass; and in a second I had put out  the candle, scrambled up the shelves, half-stunned my senses with dashing  my head against the roof, and squeezed my body betwixt wall and coffin.  There I lay on one side with a thin and rotten plank between the dead man  and me, dazed with the blow to my head, and breathing hard; while the  glow of torches as they came down the passage reddened and flickered on  the roof above.          CHAPTER 4    IN THE VAULT    Let us hob and nob with Death--_Tennyson_      Though nothing of the vault except the roof was visible from where I  lay, and so I could not see these visitors, yet I heard every word  spoken, and soon made out one voice as being Master Ratsey's. This  discovery gave me no surprise but much solace, for I thought that if the  worst happened and I was discovered, I should find one friend with whom  I could plead for life.    'It is well the earth gave way', the sexton was saying, 'on a night when  we were here to find it. I was in the graveyard myself after midday, and  all was snug and tight then. 'Twould have been awkward enough to have the  hole stand open through the day, for any passer-by to light on.'    There were four or five men in the vault already, and I could hear more  coming down the passage, and guessed from their heavy footsteps that they  were carrying burdens.

Wherefore  I choose to believe good of such noble souls as they, and not evil of them.    [Sidenote: How Sir Launcelot dwelt at Camelot] Yet, though Sir Launcelot  thus abided at the court of the King, he ever loved the open world and a  life of adventure above all things else. For he had lived so long in the  Lake that these things of the sturdy life of out-of-doors never lost their  charm for him. So, though he found, for a while, great joy in being at the  court of the King (for there were many jousts held in his honor, and,  whithersoever he rode forth, men would say to one another: \"Yonder goeth  that great knight, Sir Launcelot, who is the greatest knight in the  world\"), yet he longed ever to be abroad in the wide world again. So one  day he besought King Arthur for leave to depart thence and to go forth for  a while in search of adventures; and King Arthur gave him leave to do as he  desired.    So now shall be told of several excellent adventures that Sir Launcelot  undertook, and which he carried through with entire success, and to the  great glory and renown of the Round Table, of which he was the foremost  knight.    [Illustration: Sir Lionel of Britain]          Chapter Second      _How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel Rode Forth Errant Together and How Sir  Lionel Met Sir Turquine to His Great Dole. Also How Sir Ector Grieved for  the Departure of His Brother Launcelot and So, Following Him, Fell into a  Very Sorry Adventure_.    Now after King Arthur had thus given Sir Launcelot leave to go errant and  whilst Sir Launcelot was making himself ready to depart there came to him  Sir Lionel, who was his cousin germain, and Sir Lionel besought leave to go  with him as his knight-companion, and Sir Launcelot gave him that leave.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel depart in search of adventure] So  when King Arthur confirmed Sir Launcelot's permission Sir Lionel also made  himself ready very joyfully, and early of the morning of the next day they  two took their leave of the court and rode away together; the day being  very fair and gracious and all the air full of the joy of that  season--which was in the flower of the spring-time.    So, about noon-tide, they came to a certain place where a great apple-tree  stood by a hedge, and by that time they had grown an-hungered. So they tied  their horses near-by in a cool and shady place and straightway sat them  down under the apple-tree in the soft tall grass, which was yet fresh with  the coolness of the morning.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot sleepeth beneath an apple-tree] Then when they  had ended their meal Sir Launcelot said: \"Brother, I have a great lust to  sleep for a little space, for I find myself so drowsy that mine eyelids are  like scales of lead.\" Unto which Sir Lionel made reply: \"Very well; sleep  thou for a while, and I will keep watch, and after that thou shalt watch,  and I will sleep for a little space.\" So Sir Launcelot put his helmet  beneath his head and turned upon his side, and in a little had fallen into  a sleep which had neither dream nor thought of any kind, but which was deep  and pure like to a clear well of water in the forest.    And, whilst he slept thus, Sir Lionel kept watch, walking up and down in  the shade of a hedge near-by.    [Sidenote: Sir Lionel perceives how one knight pursues three knights]  Where they were was upon the side of a hill, and beneath them was a little  valley; and a road ran through the valley, very white and shining in the  sunlight, like a silken ribbon, and the road lay between growing fields of  corn and pasture-land. Now as Sir Lionel walked beside the hedge he beheld  three knights come riding into that valley and along that road with very  great speed and in several clouds of dust; and behind them came a fourth  knight, who was very huge of frame and who was clad altogether in black  armor. Moreover, this knight rode upon a black horse and his shield was  black and his spear was black and the furniture of his horse was black, so  that everything appertaining to that knight was as black as any raven.    And Sir Lionel beheld that this one knight pursued those other three  knights and that his horse went with greater speed than theirs, so that by  and by he overtook the hindermost knight. And Sir Lionel beheld that the  sable knight smote the fleeing knight a great buffet with his sword, so  that that knight fell headlong from his horse and rolled over two or three  times upon the ground and then lay as though he were dead. Then the black  knight catched the second of the three, and served him as he had served his  fellow. Then the third of the three, finding that there was no escape for  him, turned as if to defend himself; but the black knight drave at him, and  smote him so terrible a blow that I believe had a thunderbolt smitten him  he would not have fallen from his horse more suddenly than he did. For,  though that combat was full three furlongs away, yet Sir Lionel heard the  sound of that blow as clearly as though it had been close by.    Then after the black knight had thus struck down those three knights he  went to each in turn and tied his hands behind his back. Then, lifting each  man with extraordinary ease, he laid him across the saddle of that horse  from which he had fallen, as though he were a sack of grain. And all this  Sir Lionel beheld with very great wonder, marvelling much at the strength  and prowess of that black knight. \"Ha,\" quoth he to himself, \"I will go and  inquire into this business, for it may haply be that yonder black knight  shall not find it to be so easy to deal with a knight of the Round Table as  with those other three knights.\"    So, with this, Sir Lionel loosed his horse very quietly and went his way so  softly that Sir Launcelot was not awakened. And after he had gone some way,  he mounted his steed and rode off at a fast gallop down into that valley.    [Sidenote: Sir Lionel addresses the sable knight] When Sir Lionel had come  to that place where the knight was, he found that he had just bound the  last of the three knights upon the saddle of his horse as aforetold. So Sir  Lionel spoke to the sable knight in this wise: \"Sir, I pray you tell me  your name and degree and why you treat those knights in so shameful a  fashion as I behold you to do.\"    \"Messire,\" said the black knight very fiercely, \"this matter concerns you  not at all; yet I may tell you that those knights whom I have overthrown  are knights of King Arthur's court, and so I serve all such as come into  this place. So will I serve you, too, if you be a knight of King Arthur's.\"    \"Well,\" said Sir Lionel, \"that is a very ungracious thing for you to say.  And as for that, I too am a knight of King Arthur's court, but I do not  believe that you will serve me as you have served those three. Instead of  that, I have great hope that I shall serve you in such a fashion that I  shall be able to set these knights free from your hands.\"    [Sidenote: The sable knight overcomes Sir Lionel] Thereupon, without more  ado, he made him ready with spear and shield, and the black knight,  perceiving his design, also made him ready. Then they rode a little  distance apart so as to have a fair course for a tilt upon the roadway.  Then each set spur to his horse and the two drave together with such  violence that the earth shook beneath them. So they met fair in the middle  of the course, but lo! in that encounter the spear of Sir Lionel broke into  as many as thirty or forty pieces, but the spear of the black knight held,  so that Sir Lionel was lifted clean out from his saddle and over the  crupper of his horse with such violence that when he smote the ground he  rolled three times over ere he ceased to fall. And because of that fierce,  terrible blow he swooned away entirely, and all was black before his eyes,  and he knew nothing.    Therewith the black knight dismounted and tied Sir Lionel's arms behind his  back and he laid him across the saddle of his horse as he had laid those  others across the saddles of their horses; and he tied him there very  securely with strong cords so that Sir Lionel could not move.    And all this while Sir Launcelot slept beneath the apple-tree upon the  hillside, for he was greatly soothed by the melodious humming of the bees  in the blossoms above where he lay.    [Sidenote: Of Sir Turquine the sable knight] Now you are to know that he  who had thus taken Sir Lionel and those three knights prisoner was one Sir  Turquine, a very cruel, haughty knight, who had a great and strong castle  out beyond the mouth of that valley in which these knights took combat as  aforetold. Moreover, it was the custom of Sir Turquine to make prisoner all  the knights and ladies who came that way; and all the knights and ladies  who were not of King Arthur's court he set free when they had paid a  sufficient ransom unto him; but the knights who were of King Arthur's  court, and especially those who were of the Round Table, he held prisoner  for aye within his castle. The dungeon of that castle was a very cold,  dismal, and unlovely place, and it was to this prison that he proposed to  take those four knights whom he had overcome, with intent to hold them  prisoner as aforetold.    And now turn we to King Arthur's court and consider what befell there after  Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel had left it in search of adventures.    [Sidenote: Sir Ector follows Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel] When Sir Ector  found that Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel had gone away in that fashion he  was very much grieved in spirit; wherefore he said to himself, \"Meseems my  brother might have taken me with him as well as our cousin.\" So he went to  King Arthur and besought his leave to quit the court and to ride after  those other two and to join in their adventures, and King Arthur very  cheerfully gave him that leave. So Sir Ector made him ready with all  "]]]
