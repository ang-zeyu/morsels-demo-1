Several Indians have acquired capitals nearly equal, and there  are upwards of a dozen houses possessing from forty to fifty thousand  pounds sterling. Wholesale trade is carried on here with greater  facility and profit, and with less intrigue and fraud, than any where I  have seen in the Levant; the principal reason of which is, that almost  all the bargains are made for ready money, very little or no credit  being given. This, however, is not to be understood as implying any  thing favourable to the character of the merchants, who are as notorious  for their bad faith as they are for their large fortunes; but the nature  of the trade, and the established usage, render it a less troublesome  and intriguing business here than in any other country of the East.    The commerce of Djidda may be divided into two principal branches--the  coffee trade, and the Indian trade; with both of which that of Egypt is  connected. Ships laden with coffee arrive from Yemen all the year round,  without being restricted to any particular season. During the voyage,  they sail constantly near the coast, and are thus enabled to take  advantage of the land breezes during the season when no[r]therly winds  prevail, and render the voyage difficult in mid-channel. They dispose of  their cargoes for dollars, which are almost the only article that the  merchants of Yemen take in return. The coffee trade is liable to great  fluctuations, and may be considered a species of lottery, in which those  only embark who have large capitals at their command, and who can bear  occasionally great losses. The price of coffee at Djidda, being  regulated by the advices from Cairo, varies almost with the arrival of  every ship from Suez. The price at the latter place depending upon the  demand for Mocha coffee in Turkey, is thus equally fluctuating. When I  arrived at Djidda, coffee-beans were at thirty-five dollars a hundred-  weight; three weeks after they fell to twenty-four dollars, in  consequence of the    [p.17] peace between England and America, and the expectation that West-  India coffee would be again imported in large quantities at Smyrna and  Constantinople. From the hazardous nature of this trade, there are many  merchants who will not engage in it, except as agents; others send the  coffee on their own account to Cairo, where the chief part of the trade  is in the hands of the Hedjaz merchants residing there. Within the last  six years, the coffee trade between Arabia and the Mediterranean has  suffered greatly by the importation of West-India coffee into the ports  of Turkey. These were formerly supplied exclusively with Mocha coffee;  the use of which has been almost entirely superseded in European Turkey,  Asia Minor, and Syria, by that of the West Indies. The Pasha of Egypt,  however, has hitherto strictly prohibited the importation of West-India  coffee into his dominions.    The trade in India goods is much safer, and equally profitable. The  fleets, principally from Calcutta, Surat, and Bombay, reach Djidda in  the beginning of May, when they find the merchants already prepared for  them, having collected as many dollars and sequins as their  circumstances admit, that they may effect bargains in wholesale at the  very first arrival of the ships. Large sums are also sent hither by the  Cairo merchants to purchase goods on their account; but the cargoes for  the greater part are bought up by the merchants of Djidda, who  afterwards send them to Cairo to be sold for their own advantage. The  India fleets return in June or July, when the prices of every article  brought by them immediately rise; [The ships from Bengal leave Djidda in  June, those from Surat and Bombay in July or the beginning of August.  The Maskat and Bassora shipping, and the slave vessels from the  Mozambique coast, arrive at the same time.] and it commonly occurs that,  on the very day when the last ships sail, ten per cent. profit may be  obtained upon the first price. The merchants, however, unless pressed  for money, do not sell at this time, but keep their goods in warehouses  for four or five    [p.18] months, during which the price continues to rise; so that if they  choose to wait till the January or February following, they may  calculate with great security upon a gain of from thirty to forty per  cent; and if they transport a part of their goods to Mekka for sale to  the Hadj, their profits are still greater. It is the nature of this  commerce that renders Djidda so crowded during the stay of the fleet.  People repair hither from every port on the Red Sea, to purchase at the  first hand; and the merchants of Mekka, Yembo, and Djidda, scrape  together every dollar they possess, to lay them out in these  purchases. [Some time after the Indian fleet had sailed from Djidda, I  was present when a merchant of great property and respectability called  upon an acquaintance of mine to borrow one hundred dollars, saying, he  had laid out every farthing of his money in India goods which he did not  wish yet to sell, and had, in the mean while, no money left for his  daily expenses. This occurs, I understood, very frequently among them.]  Another cause of the India trade with Djidda being more safe and  profitable is, the arrival of the merchant-ships but once in the year,  at a stated period, and all within a few weeks: there is, therefore,  nothing to spoil the market; the price of goods is settled according to  the known demand and quantity of imports; and it is never known to fall  till the return of the next fleet. In the coffee trade it was the  reverse.    In Syria and Egypt it is the work of several days, and the business of  three or four brokers, to conclude a bargain between two merchants to  the amount of a thousand dollars. At Djidda sales and purchases are made  of entire ships cargoes in the course of half an hour, and the next day  the money is paid down. The greater part of the merchandize thus bought  is shipped for Suez, and sold at Cairo, whence it finds its way into the  Mediterranean. The returns are made either in goods, which are disposed  of chiefly in the Hedjaz, or in dollars and sequins, large quantities of  which are carried off annually by the Indian fleet: this principally  causes the scarcity of silver in Egypt. The coffee ships    [p.19] from Yemen take a few articles of Egyptian manufacture in return,  as Mellayes, (blue-striped cotton cloths,) linen stuff's for shirts, and  glass beads; but their chief sales are mostly for cash.    If Suez were to participate in the direct Indian trade, the present  flourishing state of Djidda would, no doubt, be greatly diminished, and  the town would become merely what its position renders it, the harbour  of the Hedjaz, instead of being, as it now is, the port of Egypt. It was  natural that the sherifs of Mekka, who had the customs in their own  hands, should endeavour, by every means in their power, to make Djidda  an emporium for the Indian trade, the custom-duties on which formed the  principle source of their income. Suez, however, is not a place where  large capitals are always found ready to make purchases; even Cairo  could not, at least immediately, engage in this trade with advantage,  were it transferred to Suez; for, according to old customs, from which  Orientals seldom like to depart, ready money is almost unknown in the  commercial transactions of that city; India goods are in consequence  never sold there except at very long credit. Undoubtedly cash might in  time have found its way to Suez, as it now does to Djidda; but the  channel of trade was such, that a fleet of ships coming direct from  India to Suez, would hardly have been able to dispose of their cargoes  either with profit or within due time. Another cause also contributed to  favour the harbour of Djidda: the India ships, although most of them  sail under the English flag, are entirely manned and commanded by the  people of the country, Arabs and Lascars; [No English captain had been at  Djidda for five years, when, in 1814, the Resoul, Captain Boag, from  Bombay, arrived laden with rice. The ships are not navigated by  Englishmen, and very few English merchants resident in India have ever  speculated in the trade of the Red Sea, which is carried on almost  exclusively with the capitals of Muselman merchants of Djidda, Maskat,  Bombay, Surat, and Calcutta. The Americans seldom visit any other  harbour in this sea than that of Mekka.] and they have adopted the same  coasting navigation that is followed in every part of the Red    [p.20] Sea. They never venture out to sea, and must, therefore,  necessarily pass Djidda and Yembo, both harbours of the Sherif, who  could easily oblige them to anchor in his ports and pay duties, as he is  known to have done with many coffee ships bound direct for Suez from  Yemen. These causes, however, no longer exist; for Mohammed Aly, Pasha  of Egypt, having possession of the harbours and custom-houses of the  Hedjaz, might transfer the customs of Djidda to Suez, and thence open a  direct communication with India. The chief obstacles to such a change  which have hitherto presented themselves, are the jealousy and false  representations of the merchants of Djidda, and the Pashas ignorance of  his own real interests, added perhaps to the fear of displeasing his  sovereign; he has it, notwithstanding, in contemplation to change the  system, after the example of a very respectable English house at  Alexandria, which had, in concert with its correspondents at Bombay, in  1812, when the Hedjaz was not yet in the Pashas hands, concluded a  treaty with him for allowing English ships to come direct to Suez, and  for insuring the protection of merchandize across the Desert to Cairo.  The reports of the Wahabi war, and of hostile cruisers in the Red Sea,  prevented the merchants from taking advantage of the treaty till 1815,  when a large ship was despatched from Bombay to Suez."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9479"],[0,"The Boy Life of Napoleon, Afterwards Emperor of the French (#6)"],[1,"mountains that wall in the town of Ajaccio, the shepherd  boys were tending their scattered herds.    \"Who will exchange chestnut bread for the best town bread in Ajaccio?\"  he demanded. \"I will give piece for piece.\"    Those shepherd boys led a lonely sort of life, and welcomed anything  that was novel. Then, too, they were as tired of their bread, made from  pounded chestnuts, as was Napoleon of Saveria's wheat bread.    So Napoleon found a ready response to his offer.    \"Here! I'll do it!\"--\"and I\"--\"and I\"--\"and I\"--came the answers, in  such numbers that Napoleon saw that his little stock would soon be  exhausted; and, indeed, he was not overfond of chestnut bread.    So he improved on his idea.    \"Piece for piece, I will exchange, as I offered,\" he announced. \"But  there are too many of you. See! he who will give me the biggest slice of  broccio shall have first choice for the bread, and the next biggest, the  next.\"    This put a different face on the transaction, but it added spice to the  operation; and Napoleon actually succeeded in getting for his stale home  bread, goodly sized pieces of fresh chestnut bread, and enough of the  much-loved broccio, and bunches of luscious grapes, \"to boot,\" to  provide him with a generous meal. But the next day the shepherd boys  rebelled; they told Napoleon that his bread was stale, and not good.  They preferred their chestnut bread.    \"But if you will look after our sheep while we go into the town,\" said  one of them, \"we will give you some of our bread.\"    [Illustration: _\"He tossed his dry bread to the shepherd boys\"_]    This, however, did not suit Napoleon. \"I am not one to tend sheep,\" he  answered. \"Keep your bread. It is not so good that one wishes to eat it  twice; and--here, I pity you for having always to eat that stuff. Take  mine!\" With that, he tossed his store of dry bread to the shepherd boys,  and, walking back to town, ran in to visit his foster mother; that is,  the woman who had been his nurse when he was a baby.    Nurse Camilla, as he called her, or sometimes \"foster-mamma Camilla,\"  was now the widow Ilari; but since her husband had been killed in one of  those terrible family quarrels known as a Corsican _vendetta_, she had  lived in a little house on one of the narrow streets of Ajaccio, not far  from the Bonapartes.    She was very fond of her baby, as she called Napoleon; and when he told  her of his disgrace at home, she said,--    \"Bah! the sillies! Do they not know a truth-teller when they see one?  And so they would keep you on bread and water? Not if Nurse Camilla can  prevent it. See, now! here is a plenty to eat, and just what my own boy  likes, does he not? Eat, eat, my son, and never mind the stale bread of  that stingy Saveria.\"    Then she petted and caressed the boy she so adored; she gave him the  best her house afforded, and sent him away to his own home satisfied and  filled, but especially jubilant, I fear, because he had got the best, as  he termed it, of the home tyranny, and shown how he was able to do for  himself even when he was driven to extremities.    It was this ability to use all the conditions of life for his own  benefit, and to turn even privation and defeat into victory, that gave  to Napoleon, when he became a man, that genius of mastery that made this  neglected boy of Corsica the foremost man of all the world.          CHAPTER FIVE.    A WRONG RIGHTED.    It was the third day of the family's absence from the Bonaparte house.  Napoleon had been at his favorite resort,--the grotto that overlooked  the sea. He had been brooding over his fancied wrongs, as well as his  real ones; he had wished he could be a man to do as he pleased. He would  free Corsica from French tyranny, make his father rich, and his mother  free from worry, and, in fact, accomplish all those impossible things  that every boy of spirit and ambition is certain he could do if he might  but have the chance.    As he approached his home, he saw little Panoria swinging on the gate.  She was waiting for her friend Eliza; for she had learned from Pauline  that the absent ones were to return that evening from their visit to  Melilli.    Panoria, as you have learned, was a bright little girl, who spoke her  mind, and had no great awe for the Bonapartes--not even for the mighty  Canon Lucien, the all-powerful Nurse Saveria, nor the masterful little  Napoleon.    In fact, Napoleon stood more in awe of Panoria than she did of him. For  the boy was, as boys and girls say today, \"sweet on\" the little Panoria,  to whom he gave the pet name \"La Giacommetta.\" Many a battle royal he  had fought because of her with the fun-loving boys of Ajaccio, who  found that it enraged Napoleon to tease him about the little girl, and  therefore never let the opportunity slip to tease and torment him.    \"Ah, Napoleon, it is you!\" cried Panoria, as the boy approached her.  \"And what great stories have you been telling yourself today in your  grotto?\"    \"I tell no great stories to myself, little one,\" Napoleon replied with  rather a lordly air. \"I do but talk truth with myself.\"    \"Then should you talk truth with me, boy,\" the little lady replied, a  trifle haughty also. \"I am not to be called 'little one' by such a mite  as you. See! I am taller than you!\"    \"Yes; when one stands on a gate, one is taller than he who stands on the  ground,\" Napoleon admitted. \"But when we stand back to back, who then is  the taller? See! Call Pauline! She shall tell us!\"    \"That shall she not, then,\" said the little girl, who loved to tease  quite as well as most girls. \"It would be better to go and make yourself  look fine, than to stand here saying how big you are. Go look in the  glass. Your stockings are tumbling over your shoes, and your jacket is  all awry. How will your Mamma Letitia like that? Run, then! I hear the  carriage wheels! In with you, little Down-at-the-heel!\"    Smarting under the girl's teasing, and all the more because it came from  her, Napoleon sulked into the house.    But Panoria still swung on the gate. When the carriage stopped before  the house, she ran to welcome her friend Eliza, and, with the returned  family, entered the house.    In the doorway the fat little canon, Uncle Lucien, received them.    \"Back again, uncle!\" cried Mamma Letitia in welcome. \"And how do you  all? Where is Napoleon? Where is Pauline?\" The woman who spoke was  Madame Letitia Bonaparte, the mother of Napoleon. She was a remarkable  woman--remarkable for beauty, for ability, and for position. Born a  peasant, she became the mother of kings and queens; reared in poverty,  she became the mistress of millions. In her Corsican home she was  house-mother and care-taker; and when, made great by her great son, she  had every comfort and every luxury, she still remained house-mother and  care-taker, looking after her own household, and refusing to spend the  money with which her son provided her, for fear that some day she or her  family might need it. In all the troubles in Corsica she accompanied her  husband to the mountain-retreat and the battle-field, encouraging him by  her bravery, and urging him to patriotic purpose, until the end came,  and Corsica was defeated and conquered. She carried all the worries and  bore all the responsibilities of the Bonaparte household; and it was  only by her management and carefulness that the family was kept from  absolute poverty.    Her children loved her; but they feared her too, and never thought of  going contrary to her desires or commands. Late in life Napoleon  once told a boy of whom he was fond the consequences of the only time he  ever dared make fun of \"Mamma Letitia.\"    \"Pauline and I tried it,\" he said; \"but it was a great mistake on our  part. It was the only time in my life that my mother herself ever  whipped me. I don't believe Pauline ever forgot it. I never did.\"    So it was Mamma Letitia who first spoke on the arrival at home; and her  first question was as to the children who had remained behind.    \"Where is Napoleon? Where is Pauline?\" she asked.    Little Pauline sprang from behind her uncle the canon.    \"I am here, mamma,\" she said, and threw herself in her mother's arms.    \"But where is Napoleon?\"    \"He has not been good, mamma,\" Pauline replied. \"See! he is there,  behind the door. He dare not come out. He pouts.\"    \"It is not so, mamma,\" said Napoleon, coming forward; \"I do dare. I am  sad; but I do not pout.\"    \"And is he obstinate still, Uncle Lucien?\" Papa Charles asked. \"Has he  confessed, or asked your pardon?\"    \"He has done neither,\" Uncle Lucien replied. \"I have never seen, in any  child, such obstinacy as his.\"    \"Napoleon! Obstinacy!\" exclaimed Mamma Letitia. \"Why, tell me; what has  the boy done?\"    Then Uncle Lucien told the story of the rifled basket of fruit, excusing  the lad as much as he could, although it must be confessed that the kind  of canon was considerably \"put out\" by the reason of what he called  Napoleon's obstinacy.    When, however, he reached the part of his story that described how he  wished Napoleon to confess his misdeed, little Panoria, having, as  I have told you, none of that awe of the Canon Lucien that his grand  nephews and nieces had, burst in upon him,--    \"Why, then!\" she cried, \"I should not think Napoleon would confess. Poor  boy! He did not eat your fruit, Canon Lucien.\"    \"How, child! What do you say?\" the canon exclaimed. \"He did not? Who  did, then?\"    \"Why, I did--and Eliza,\" Panoria replied    \"You--and Eliza!\"--\"Eliza!\"--\"Why, she said nothing!\" These were the  exclamations of surprise and query that came from all present.    \"Why, surely!\" said Panoria; \"and was it wrong? Fruit is free to all  here in Corsica. But Eliza was so afraid of her uncle the canon's fruit  that I dared her to take some; and we did. Napoleon never touched it. He  knew nothing of it.\"    \"My poor boy my good child!\" said the Canon Lucien, taking Napoleon in  his arms. \""]]]
