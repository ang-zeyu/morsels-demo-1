[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61"],[0,"The Communist Manifesto (#6)"],[1,"on, it became the vocation of the  aristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against  modern bourgeois society.  In the French revolution of July 1830,  and in the English reform agitation, these aristocracies again  succumbed to the hateful upstart.  Thenceforth, a serious political  contest was altogether out of the question.  A literary battle  alone remained possible.  But even in the domain of literature  the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible.    In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy were obliged to  lose sight, apparently, of their own interests, and to formulate  their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the  exploited working class alone.  Thus the aristocracy took their  revenge by singing lampoons on their new master, and whispering  in his ears sinister prophecies of coming catastrophe.    In this way arose Feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half  lampoon; half echo of the past, half menace of the future; at  times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the  bourgeoisie to the very heart's core; but always ludicrous in  its effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of  modern history.    The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the  proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner.  But the people, so  often as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal  coats of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter.    One section of the French Legitimists and \"Young England\"  exhibited this spectacle.    In pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to  that of the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they  exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite  different, and that are now antiquated.  In showing that, under  their rule, the modern proletariat never existed, they forget  that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their  own form of society.    For the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary  character of their criticism that their chief accusation against  the bourgeoisie amounts to this, that under the bourgeois regime  a class is being developed, which is destined to cut up root and  branch the old order of society.    What they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it  creates a proletariat, as that it creates a revolutionary  proletariat.    In political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive  measures against the working class; and in ordinary life,  despite their high falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the  golden apples dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter  truth, love, and honour for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and  potato spirits.    As the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord,  so has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism.    Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist  tinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property,  against marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the  place of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification  of the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian  Socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates  the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.      B. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism    The feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by  the bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions of existence  pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society.  The mediaeval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were  the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie.  In those countries  which are but little developed, industrially and commercially,  these two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising  bourgeoisie.    In countries where modern civilisation has become fully  developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed,  fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever renewing  itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society.  The  individual members of this class, however, are being constantly  hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition,  and, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment  approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent  section of modern society, to be replaced, in manufactures,  agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen.    In countries like France, where the peasants constitute far more  than half of the population, it was natural that writers who  sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, should use,  in their criticism of the bourgeois regime, the standard of the  peasant and petty bourgeois, and from the standpoint of these  intermediate classes should take up the cudgels for the working  class.  Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism.  Sismondi was the  head of this school, not only in France but also in England.    This school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the  contradictions in the conditions of modern production.  It laid  bare the hypocritical apologies of economists.  It proved,  incontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and  division of labour; the concentration of capital and land in a  few hands; overproduction and crises; it pointed out the  inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery  of the proletariat, the anarchy in production, the crying  inequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial war of  extermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral  bonds, of the old family relations, of the old nationalities.    In its positive aims, however, this form of Socialism aspires  either to restoring the old means of production and of exchange,  and with them the old property relations, and the old society, or  to cramping the modern means of production and of exchange,  within the framework of the old property relations that have  been, and were bound to be, exploded by those means.  In either  case, it is both reactionary and Utopian.    Its last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture,  patriarchal relations in agriculture.    Ultimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all  intoxicating effects of self-deception, this form of Socialism  ended in a miserable fit of the blues.      C. German, or \"True,\" Socialism    The Socialist and Communist literature of France, a literature  that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power, and  that was the expression of the struggle against this power, was  introduced into Germany at a time when the bourgeoisie, in that  country, had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism.    German philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux esprits,  eagerly seized on this literature, only forgetting, that when  these writings immigrated from France into Germany, French social  conditions had not immigrated along with them.  In contact with  German social conditions, this French literature lost all its  immediate practical significance, and assumed a purely literary  aspect.  Thus, to the German philosophers of the eighteenth  century, the demands of the first French Revolution were nothing  more than the demands of \"Practical Reason\" in general, and the  utterance of the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie  signified in their eyes the law of pure Will, of Will as it was  bound to be, of true human Will generally.    The world of the German literate consisted solely in bringing  the new French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical  conscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without  deserting their own philosophic point of view.    This annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign  language is appropriated, namely, by translation.    It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic  Saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of  ancient heathendom had been written.  The German literate  reversed this process with the profane French literature.  They  wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original.  For instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic  functions of money, they wrote \"Alienation of Humanity,\" and  beneath the French criticism of the bourgeois State they wrote  \"dethronement of the Category of the General,\" and so forth.    The introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of  the French historical criticisms they dubbed \"Philosophy of  Action,\" \"True Socialism,\" \"German Science of Socialism,\"  \"Philosophical Foundation of Socialism,\" and so on.    The French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely  emasculated. And, since it ceased in the hands of the German to express  the struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having  overcome \"French one-sidedness\" and of representing, not true  requirements, but the requirements of truth; not the interests of the  proletariat, but the interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who  belongs to no class, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm  of philosophical fantasy.    This German Socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously  and solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such  mountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic  innocence.    The fight of the German, and especially, of the Prussian bourgeoisie,  against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, in other words, the  liberal movement, became more earnest.    By this, the long wished-for opportunity was offered to \"True\"  Socialism of confronting the political movement with the  Socialist demands, of hurling the traditional anathemas  against liberalism, against representative government, against  bourgeois competition, bourgeois freedom of the press, bourgeois  legislation, bourgeois liberty and equality, and of preaching to  the masses that they had nothing to gain, and everything to lose,  by this bourgeois movement.  German Socialism forgot, in the nick  of time, that the French"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6104"],[0,"Station Life in New Zealand (#6)"],[1," get away from the Dip, and back to the manager's  house, where we refreshed ourselves by a delicious cup of tea, and soon  after started for a nice long drive home in the cool, clear evening  air. The days are very hot, but never oppressive; and the mornings and  evenings are deliciously fresh and invigorating. You can remain out late  without the least danger. Malaria is unknown, and, in spite of the heavy  rains, there is no such thing as damp. Our way lay through very pretty  country--a series of terraces, with a range of mountains before us, with  beautiful changing and softening evening tints creeping over the whole.    I am sorry to say, we leave this next week. I should like to explore a  great deal more.          Letter VI: Society.--houses and servants.      Christchurch, January 1866. I am beginning to get tired of Christchurch  already: but the truth is, I am not in a fair position to judge of it  as a place of residence; for, living temporarily, as we do, in a sort of  boarding-house, I miss the usual duties and occupations of home, and the  town itself has no place of public amusement except a little theatre, to  which it is much too hot to go. The last two weeks have been _the_ gay  ones of the whole year; the races have been going on for three days, and  there have been a few balls; but as a general rule, the society may  be said to be extremely stagnant. No dinner-parties are ever given--I  imagine, on account of the smallness of the houses and the inefficiency  of the servants; but every now and then there is an assembly ball  arranged, in the same way, I believe, as at watering-places in England  only, of course, on a much smaller scale. I have been at two or three  of these, and noticed at each a most undue preponderance of black coats.  Nearly all the ladies were married, there were very few young girls; and  it would be a great improvement to the Christchurch parties if some of  the pretty and partnerless groups of a London ball-room, in all their  freshness of toilette, could be transferred to them. What a sensation  they would make, and what terrible heart-aches among the young gentlemen  would be the result of such an importation! There were the same knots of  men standing together as at a London party, but I must say that, except  so far as their tailor is concerned, I think we have the advantage of  you, for the gentlemen lead such healthy lives that they all look more  or less bronzed and stalwart--in splendid condition, not like your pale  dwellers in cities; and then they come to a ball to dance, arriving  early so as to secure good partners, and their great ambition appears to  be to dance every dance from the first to the last. This makes it hard  work for the few ladies, who are not allowed to sit down for a moment,  and I have often seen a young and pretty partner obliged to divide her  dances between two gentlemen.      Although it tells only against myself, I must make you laugh at an  account of a snub I received at one of these balls. Early in the evening  I had danced with a young gentleman whose station was a long way \"up  country,\" and who worked so hard on it that he very seldom found time  for even the mild dissipations of Christchurch; he was good-looking  and gentlemanly, and seemed clever and sensible, a little _brusque_,  perhaps, but one soon gets used to that here. During our quadrille he  confided to me that he hardly knew any ladies in the room, and that his  prospects of getting any dancing were in consequence very blank. I did  all I could to find partners for him, introducing him to every lady whom  I knew, but it was in vain; they would have been delighted to dance with  him, but their cards were filled. At the end of the evening, when I was  feeling thoroughly done up, and could hardly stand up for fatigue, my  poor friend came up and begged for another dance. I assured him I could  scarcely stand, but when he said in a _larmoyante_ voice, \"I have only  danced once this evening, that quadrille with you,\" my heart softened,  and I thought I would make a great effort and try to get through one  more set of Lancers; my partner seemed so grateful, that the demon of  vanity, or coquetry, or whatever it is that prompts one to say absurd  things induced me to fish for a compliment, and to observe, \"It was not  worth while taking all the trouble of riding such a distance to dance  only with me, was it?\" Whereupon my poor, doleful friend answered, with  a deep sigh, and an accent of profound conviction, \"No, indeed it was  _not_!\" I leave you to imagine my discomfiture; but luckily he never  observed it, and I felt all the time that I richly deserved what I got,  for asking such a stupid question.    The music at these balls is very bad, and though the principal room in  which they are given, at the Town Hall, is large and handsome, it is  poorly lighted, and the decorations are desolate in the extreme. I am  afraid this is not a very inviting picture of what is almost our only  opportunity of meeting together, but it is tolerably correct. Visiting  appears to be the business of some people's lives, but the acquaintance  does not seem to progress beyond incessant afternoon calls; we are  never asked inside a house, nor, as far as I can make out, is there any  private society whatever, and the public society consists, as I have  said, of a ball every now and then.    My greatest interest and occupation consist in going to look at my  house, which is being cut out in Christchurch, and will be drayed to our  station next month, a journey of fifty miles. It is, of course, only of  wood, and seems about as solid as a band-box; but I am assured by the  builder that it will be a \"most superior article\" when it is all put  together. F---- and I made the little plan of it ourselves, regulating  the size of the drawing-room by the dimensions of the carpet we brought  out, and I petitioned for a little bay-window, which is to be added; so  on my last visit to his timber-yard, the builder said, with an air of  great dignity, \"Would you wish to see the _h_oriel, mum?\" The doors all  come ready-made from America, and most of the wood used in building is  the Kauri pine from the North Island. One advantage, at all events, in  having wooden houses is the extreme rapidity with which they are run up,  and there are no plastered walls to need drying. For a long time we were  very uncertain where, and what, we should build on our station; but only  six weeks after we made up our minds, a house is almost ready for us.  The boards are sawn into the requisite lengths by machinery; and all the  carpentering done down here; the frame will only require to be fitted  together when it reaches its destination, and it is a very good time of  year for building, as the wool drays are all going back empty, and we  can get them to take the loads at reduced prices; but even with this  help, it is enormously expensive to move a small house fifty miles, the  last fifteen over bad roads; it is collar-work for the poor horses all  the way, Christchurch being only nine feet above the sea-level, while  our future home in the Malvern Hills is twelve hundred.    You know we brought all our furniture out with us, and even papers for  the rooms, just because we happened to have everything; but I should not  recommend any one to do so, for the expense of carriage, though moderate  enough by sea (in a wool ship), is enormous as soon as it reaches  Lyttleton, and goods have to be dragged up country by horses or  bullocks. There are very good shops where you can buy everything, and  besides these there are constant sales by auction where, I am told,  furniture fetches a price sometimes under its English value. House rent  about Christchurch is very high. We looked at some small houses in and  about the suburbs of the town, when we were undecided about our plans,  and were offered the most inconvenient little dwellings, with rooms  which were scarcely bigger than cupboards, for 200 pounds a year; we  saw nothing at a lower price than this, and any house of a better class,  standing in a nicely arranged shrubbery, is at least 300 pounds per  annum. Cab-hire is another thing which seems to me disproportionately  dear, as horses are very cheap; there are no small fares, half-a-crown  being the lowest \"legal tender\" to a cabman; and I soon gave up  returning visits when I found that to make a call in a Hansom three  or four miles out of the little town cost one pound or one pound ten  shillings, even remaining only a few minutes at the house.    All food (except mutton) appears to be as nearly as possible at London  prices; but yet every one looks perfectly well-fed, and actual want is  unknown. Wages of all sorts are high, and employment, a certainty. The  look and bearing of the immigrants appear to alter soon after they reach  the colony. Some people object to the independence of their manner, but  I do not; on the contrary, I like to see the upright gait, the well-fed,  healthy look, the decent clothes (even if no one touches his hat to  you), instead of the half-starved, depressed appearance, and too often  cringing servility of the mass of our English population. Scotchmen do  particularly well out here; frugal and thrifty, hard-working and sober,  it is easy to predict the future of a man of this type in a new country.  Naturally, the whole tone of thought and feeling is almost exclusively  practical; even in a morning visit there is no small-talk. I find no  difficulty in obtaining the useful information upon domestic subjects  which I so much need; for it is sad to discover, after all my  house-keeping experience, that I am still perfectly ignorant. Here it is  necessary to know _how_ everything should be done; it is not sufficient  to give an order, you must also be in a position to explain how it is to  be carried out I felt quite guilty when I saw the picture in _Punch_ the  other day, of a young and"]]]
