It is hardly to be supposed or hoped that  posterity will feel satisfied with our monographs of extinct species,  and the few crumbling bones and faded feathers, which may possibly  survive half a dozen centuries in some happily-placed museum. On the  contrary, such dreary mementoes will only serve to remind them of their  loss; and if they remember us at all, it will only be to hate our  memory, and our age--this enlightened, scientific, humanitarian age,  which should have for a motto \"Let us slay all noble and beautiful  things, for tomorrow we die.\"          CHAPTER II.    THE PUMA, OB LION OF AMERICA.      The Puma has been singularly unfortunate in its biographers. Formerly it  often happened that writers were led away by isolated and highly  exaggerated incidents to attribute very shining qualities to their  favourite animals; the lion of the Old World thus came to be regarded as  brave and I magnanimous above all beasts of the field--the Bayard of the  four-footed kind, a reputation which these prosaic and sceptical times  have not suffered it to keep. Precisely the contrary has happened with  the puma of literature; for, although to those personally acquainted  with the habits of this lesser lion of the New World it is known to  possess a marvellous courage and daring, it is nevertheless  always spoken of in books of natural history as the most pusillanimous  of the larger carnivores. It does not attack man, and Azara is perfectly  correct when he affirms that it never hurts, or threatens to hurt, man  or child, even when it finds them sleeping. This, however, is not a full  statement of the facts; the puma will not even defend itself against  man. How natural, then, to conclude that it is too timid to attack a  human being, or to defend itself, but scarcely philosophical; for even  the most cowardly carnivores we know--dogs and hyaenas, for  instance--will readily attack a disabled or sleeping man when pressed by  hunger; and when driven to desperation no animal is too small or too  feeble to make a show of resistance. In such a case \"even the armadillo  defends itself,\" as the gaucho proverb says. Besides, the conclusion is  in contradiction to many other well-known facts. Putting-aside the  puma's passivity in the presence of man, it is a bold hunter that  invariably prefers large to small game; in desert places killing  peccary, tapir, ostrich, deer, huanaco, &c., all powerful, well-armed,  or swift animals. Huanaco skeletons seen in Patagonia almost invariably  have the neck dislocated, showing that the puma was the executioner.  Those only who have hunted the huanaco on the sterile plains and  mountains it inhabits know how wary, keen-scented, and fleet of foot it  is. I once spent several weeks with a surveying party in a district  where pumas were very abundant, and saw not less than half a dozen deer  every day, freshly killed in most cases, and all with dislocated necks.  Where prey is scarce and difficult to capture, the puma, after  satisfying its hunger, invariably conceals the animal it has killed,  covering it over carefully with grass and brushwood; these deer,  however, had all been left exposed to the caracaras and foxes after a  portion of the breast had been eaten, and in many cases the flesh had  not been touched, the captor having satisfied itself with sucking the  blood. It struck me very forcibly that the puma of the desert pampas is,  among mammals, like the peregrine falcon of the same district among  birds; for there this wide-ranging raptor only attacks comparatively  large birds, and, after fastidiously picking a meal from the flesh of  the head and neck, abandons the untouched body to the polybori and other  hawks of the more ignoble sort.    In pastoral districts the puma is very destructive to the larger  domestic animals, and has an extraordinary fondness for horseflesh. This  was first noticed by Molina, whose _Natural History of Chili_ was  written a century and a half ago. In Patagonia I heard on all sides that  it was extremely difficult to breed horses, as the colts were mostly  killed by the pumas. A native told me that on one occasion, while  driving his horses home through the thicket, a puma sprang out of the  bushes on to a colt following behind the troop, killing it before his  eyes and not more than six yards from his horse's head. In this  instance, my informant said, the puma alighted directly on the colt's  back, with one fore foot grasping its bosom, while with the other it  seized the head, and, giving it a violent wrench, dislocated the neck.  The colt fell to the earth as if shot, and he affirmed that it was dead  before it touched the ground.    Naturalists have thought it strange that the horse, once common  throughout America, should have become extinct over a continent  apparently so well suited to it and where it now multiplies so greatly.  As a fact wherever pumas abound the wild horse of the present time,  introduced from Europe, can hardly maintain its existence. Formerly in  many places horses ran wild and multiplied to an amazing extent, but  this happened, I believe, only in districts where the puma was scarce or  had already been driven out by man. My own experience is that on the  desert pampas wild horses are exceedingly scarce, and from all accounts  it is the same throughout Patagonia.    Next to horseflesh, sheep is preferred, and where the puma can come at a  flock, he will not trouble himself to attack horned cattle. In Patagonia  especially I found this to be the case. I resided for some time at an  estancia close to the town of El Carmen, on the Rio Negro, which during  my stay was infested by a very bold and cunning puma. To protect the  sheep from his attacks an enclosure was made of upright willow-poles  fifteen feet long, while the gate, by which he would have to enter, was  close to the house and nearly six feet high. In spite of the  difficulties thus put in the way, and of the presence of several large  dogs, also of the watch we kept in the hope of shooting him, every  cloudy night he came, and after killing one or more sheep got safely  away. One dark night he killed four sheep; I detected him in the act,  and going up to the gate, was trying to make out his invisible form in  the gloom as he flitted about knocking the sheep over, when suddenly he  leaped clear over my head and made his escape, the bullets I sent after  him in the dark failing to hit him. Yet at this place twelve or fourteen  calves, belonging to the milch cows, were every night shut into a small  brushwood pen, at a distance from the house where the enemy could easily  have destroyed every one of them. When I expressed surprise at this  arrangement, the owner said that the puma was not fond of calves' flesh,  and came only for the sheep. Frequently after his nocturnal visits we  found, by tracing his footprints in the loose sand, that he had actually  used the calves' pen as a place of concealment while waiting to make his  attack on the sheep.    The puma often kills full-grown cows and horses, but exhibits a still  greater daring when attacking the jaguar, the largest of American  carnivores, although, compared with its swift, agile enemy, as heavy as  a rhinoceros. Azara states that it is generally believed in La Plata and  Paraguay that the puma attacks and conquers the jaguar; but he did not  credit what he heard, which was not strange, since he had already set  the puma down as a cowardly animal, because it does not attempt to harm  man or child. Nevertheless, it is well known that where the two species  inhabit the same district they are at enmity, the puma being the  persistent persecutor of the jaguar, following and harassing it as a  tyrant-bird harasses an eagle or hawk, moving about it with such  rapidity as to confuse it, and, when an opportunity occurs, springing  upon its back and inflicting terrible wounds with teeth and claws.  Jaguars with scarred backs are frequently killed, and others, not long  escaped from their tormentors, have been found so greatly lacerated that  they were easily overcome by the hunters.    In Kingsley's American _Standard Natural History_, it is stated that the  puma in North California has a feud with the grizzly bear similar to  that of the southern animal with the jaguar. In its encounter with the  grizzly it is said to be always the victor; and this is borne out by the  finding of the bodies of bears, which have evidently perished in the  struggle.    How strange that this most cunning, bold, and bloodthirsty of the  Felidae, the persecutor of the jaguar and the scourge of the ruminants  in the regions it inhabits, able to kill its prey with the celerity of a  rifle bullet, never attacks a human being! Even the cowardly,  carrion-feeding dog will attack a man when it can do so with impunity;  but in places where the puma is the only large beast of prey, it is  notorious that it is there perfectly safe for even a small child to go  out and sleep on the plain. At the same time it will not fly from man  (though the contrary is always stated in books of Natural History)  except in places where it is continually persecuted. Nor is this all: it  will not, as a rule, even defend itself against man, although in some  rare instances it has been known to do so.    The mysterious, gentle instinct of this ungentle species, which causes  the gauchos of the pampas to name it man's friend--\"amigo del  cristiano\"--has been persistently ignored by all travellers and  naturalists who have mentioned the puma. They have thus made it a very  incongruous creature, strong enough to kill a horse, yet so cowardly  withal that it invariably flies from a human being--even from a sleeping  child! Possibly its real reputation was known to some of those who havo  spoken about it; if so, they attributed what they heard to the love of  the marvellous "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7450"],[0,"Terre Napoleón; a History of French Explorations and Projects in Australia (#6)"],[1,"to God,\" wrote Napoleon; and, prodding the dilatory Minister  again to make haste, he wrote, \"You can surely, to meet the needs of our  colonies, send from several ports vessels laden with flour. There is no  need to be God for that!\"* (* Correspondance, volume 17 document 13,960.)    Now, if instead of the timid Linois, the French squadron in the Indian  Ocean had been commanded by an Admiral endowed with the qualities of  dash, daring, and enterprise, the consequences to the weak little British  settlement at Sydney would have been disastrous. After Trafalgar, British  interests in the South and the East were more amply safeguarded. But  before that great event, Linois had magnificent opportunities for doing  mischief. Port Jackson would have been a rich prize. Stores, which the  Isle of France badly needed, could have been obtained there plentifully.  Ships from China frequently made it a port of call, preferring to take  the route through the recently discovered Bass Straits than to run the  hazard of capture by crossing the Indian Ocean. It was just a lucky  accident that the enemy's admiral was a nervous gentleman who was afraid  to take risks. General Decaen, a fine soldier, openly cursed his nautical  colleague; but nothing could strike a spirit of vigorous initiative into  the breast of Linois. He was always afraid that if he struck he would be  struck at--in which view he was undoubtedly right.    Did Napoleon himself realise that there was so rich a prize in Port  Jackson? Not until it was too late. In 1810, when he was fitting out  another expedition for aggressive service in the Indian Ocean, he  probably remembered what he had read in Peron's account of the Voyage de  Decouvertes aux Terres Australes about the British colony there, and  directed that the new squadron should \"take the English colony of Port  Jackson, which is to the south of the Isle of France, and where  considerable resources will be found\" (\"faire prendre la colonie anglaise  de Jackson\"--sic),* (* Correspondance, volume 20 document 16,544.) But  the task was well-nigh hopeless then, and the squadron never sailed.  Probably it would not have reached the Indian Ocean if it had left  Europe, for the Cape, which was in Dutch hands when Linois had his great  chance, was recaptured by the British in January 1806. In 1810 Admirals  Pellew and Bertie were in command of strong British forces, and Lord  Minto, the Governor-General of India, was determined to root the French  out of the Isle of France, and clear India of danger from that source.  They succeeded, and Mauritius has been British ever since.    We must now leave the sphere of conflict in which the destinies of the  world were being shaped, and enter upon another phase of this history.  The reader will:         \"slip across the summer of the world,    Then, after a long tumble about the Cape    And frequent interchange of foul and fair,\"    --will accompany for a while an illustrious British explorer in his task  of filling up the map of the globe.      CHAPTER 1. FLINDERS AND THE INVESTIGATOR.    The Investigator at Kangaroo Island.  Thoroughness of Flinders' work.  His aims and methods.  His explorations; the theory of a Strait through Australia.  Completion of the map of the continents.  A direct succession of great navigators: Cook, Bligh, Flinders, and  Franklin.  What Flinders learnt in the school of Cook: comparison between the  healthy condition of his crew and the scurvy-stricken company on the  French vessels.    On April 7, 1802, His Majesty's ship Investigator, 334 tons, Commander  Matthew Flinders, was beating off the eastern extremity of Kangaroo  Island, endeavouring to make the mainland of Terra Australis, to follow  the course of discovery and survey for which she had been commissioned.  The winds were very baffling for pursuing his task according to the  carefully scientific method which Flinders had prescribed for himself. He  had declared to Sir Joseph Banks, the President of the Royal Society,  before he left England, that he would endeavour so to explore the then  unknown coasts of the vast island for which he himself afterwards  suggested the name Australia, \"that no person shall have occasion to come  after me to make further discoveries.\"* (* Flinders to Banks, April 29,  1801, Historical Records of New South Wales 4 351.) This principle of  thoroughness distinguished his work throughout the voyage. Writing  thirteen years later, after the long agony of his imprisonment in  Mauritius, he said that his \"leading object had been to make so accurate  an investigation of the shores of Terra Australis, that no future voyage  to the country should be necessary\" for the purpose; and that had not  circumstances been too strong for him, \"nothing of importance should have  been left for future discoverers upon any part of these extensive  coasts.\"* (* Flinders, A Voyage to Terra Australis 2 143.) Nobody can  study Flinders' beautiful charts without recognising them as the work of  a master of his craft; and so well did he fulfil his promise, until the  debility of his ship and a chain of misfortunes interposed to prevent  him, that the Admiralty charts in current use are substantially those  which Flinders made over a hundred years ago.* (* Sir J.K. Laughton in  Dictionary of National Biography 19 328.)    His method, though easy enough to pursue in a modern steamer,  comparatively indifferent to winds and currents, was one demanding from a  sailing ship hard, persistent, straining work, with unflagging vigilance  and great powers of endurance. It was this. The Investigator was kept all  day so close along shore that the breaking water was visible from the  deck, and no river mouth or inlet could escape notice. When the weather  was too rough to enable this to be done with safety, Flinders stationed  himself at the masthead, scanning every reach of the shore-line. \"Before  retiring to rest,\" he wrote, \"I made it a practice to finish the rough  chart for the day, as also my astronomical observations and bearings.\"  When darkness fell, the ship hauled off from the coast, and every  morning, as soon after daylight as possible, she was brought in-shore  again, great care being taken to resume the work at precisely the point  where it was suspended the night before. \"This plan,\" he wrote, \"to see  and lay down everything myself, required constant attention and much  labour, but was absolutely necessary to obtaining that accuracy of which  I was desirous.\"    Before Flinders reached Kangaroo Island, he had, in this painstaking  manner, discovered and mapped the stretch of coast westward from the head  of the Great Australian Bight, charted all the islands, and, by following  the two large gulfs, Spencer's and St. Vincent's, to their extremities,  had shattered the theory commonly favoured by geographers before his  time, that a passage would be found cleaving the continent from the Gulf  of Carpentaria to the Strait which George Bass had discovered in 1798.*  (* Pinkerton, in his Modern Geography (1807) volume 2 588, published  after Flinders had made his principal discoveries, but before the results  were known, reflected the general opinion in the passage: \"Some suppose  that this extensive region, when more thoroughly investigated, will be  found to consist of two or three vast islands, intersected by narrow  seas.\" The Committee of the Institute of France, which drew up the  instructions for the expedition commanded by Baudin, directed him to  search for a supposed strait dividing Australia longitudinally into \"two  great and nearly equal islands\" (Peron, Voyage de Decouvertes aux Terres  Australes 1 5). With these passages may be compared the following from  Kerr's General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels, published  in 1824, ten years after the appearance of Flinders' book: \"There are few  voyages from which more important accessions to geographical knowledge  have been derived than from this voyage of Captain Flinders, especially  when we reflect on the great probability that New Holland...[observe that  Kerr had not adopted the name Australia, which Flinders suggested only in  a footnote] will soon rank high in population and wealth. Before his  voyage it was doubtful whether New Holland was not divided into two great  islands, by a strait passing between Bass Straits and the Gulf of  Carpentaria. Captain Flinders has put an end to all doubts on this point.  He examined the coast in the closest and most accurate manner; he found,  indeed, two great openings; these he sailed up to their termination; and  consequently, as there were no other openings, and these were mere  inlets, New Holland can no longer be supposed to be divided into two  great islands. It must be regarded as forming one very large one; or  rather, from its immense size, a species of continent\" (Kerr 18 462).)    That part of the southern coast of Australia lying between Cape Leeuwin  and Fowler Bay, in the Bight, had been explored prior to Flinders' time,  partly by Captain George Vancouver, one of Cook's men, in 1791, and  partly in 1792 by the French commander, Bruni Dentrecasteaux, who was  despatched in search of the gallant La Perouse--\"vanished trackless into  blue immensity.\"* (* Carlyle, French Revolution book 2 cap 5.) Flinders  carefully revised what they had done, commencing his elaborate,  independent survey immediately after the Investigator made the Leeuwin,  on December 6, 1801. He had therefore been just four months in this  region, when he left his anchorage at Kangaroo Island--four months of  incessant daily and nightly labour diligently directed to the task in  hand. Always generous in his praise of good work, he paid a warm tribute  to the quality of the charts prepared by Beautemps Beaupre, \"geographical  engineer\" of La Recherche, Dentrecasteaux's corvette. \"Perhaps no chart  of a coast so little known as this is, will bear a comparison with its"]]]
