When  they did this, they were brought into very close relations with the  unfree cultivators; they were parts of the same system and subject to  some of the same regulations and services but their land was usually held  on terms that were economically better than the serfs obtained, and they  retained their personal freedom. They were members of the lords' courts,  and there the serfs were their peers; but they were also members of the  old national courts of hundred and shire, and there they were the peers  of knights and barons.    This system, this economic side of feudalism, is what we know as the  manorial system. Its unit was the manor, an estate of land larger or  smaller, but large enough to admit of this characteristic organization,  managed as a unit, usually from some well-defined centre, the manor  house, and directed by a single responsible head, the lord's steward. The  land which constituted the manor was divided into two clearly  distinguished parts, the \"domain\" and the \"tenures.\" The domain was the  part of each manor that was reserved for the lord's own use, and  cultivated for him by the labour of his tenants under the direction of  the steward, as a part of the services by which they held their lands;  that is, as a part of the rent paid for them. The returns from these  domain lands formed a very large part, probably the largest part, of the  income of the landlord class in feudal days. The \"tenures\" were the  holdings of the cultivators, worked for themselves by their own labour,  of varying sizes and held on terms of varying advantage, and usually  scattered about the manor in small strips, a bit here and another there.  Besides these cultivated lands there were also, in the typical manor,  common pasture lands and common wood lands, in which the rights of each  member of this little community were carefully regulated by the customary  law of the manor. This whole arrangement was plainly economic in  character and purpose it was not in the least political. Its object was  to get the soil cultivated, to provide mankind with the necessary food  and clothing, and the more fortunate members of the race with their  incomes. This purpose it admirably served in an age when local protection  was an ever present need, when the labouring man had often to look to the  rich and strong man of the neighbourhood for the security which he could  not get from the state. Whatever may have been the origin of this system,  it was at any rate this need which perpetuated it for centuries from the  fall of Rome to the later Middle Ages; and during this long time it was  by this system that the western world was fed and all its activities  sustained.    This economic side of feudalism, this manorial system, was not introduced  into England by the Norman Conquest. It had grown up in the Saxon states,  as it had on the continent, because of the prevalence there of the  general social and economic conditions which favoured its growth. It was  different from the continental system in some details; it used different  terms for many things; but it was essentially the same system. It had its  body of customary law and its private courts; and these courts, like  their prototypes in the Prankish state, had in numerous cases usurped or  had been granted the rights and functions of the local courts of the  nation, and so had annexed a minor political function which did not  naturally belong to the system. Indeed, this process had gone so far that  we may believe that the stronger government of the state established by  the Conqueror found it necessary to check it and to hold the operation of  the private courts within stricter limits. This economic organization  which the Normans found in England was so clearly parallel with that  which they had always known that they made no change in it. They  introduced their own vocabulary in many cases in place of the Saxon; they  identified in some cases practices which looked alike but which were not  strictly identical; and they had a very decided tendency to treat the  free members of the manorial population, strongly intrenched as they were  in the popular courts, as belonging at the same time to both sides of  feudalism, the economic and the political: but the confusion of language  and custom which they introduced in consequence is not sufficient to  disguise from us the real relationships which existed. Nor should it be  in the opposite process, which was equally easy, as when the Saxon  chronicler, led by the superficial resemblance and overlooking the great  institutional difference, called the curia of William by the Saxon name  of witenagemot.    With the other side of feudalism, the political, the case was different.  That had never grown up in the Saxon world. The starting-points in  certain minor Roman institutions from which it had grown, seem to have  disappeared with the Saxon occupation of Britain. The general conditions  which favoured its development--the almost complete breakdown of the  central government and the difficult and interrupted means of  communication--existed in far less degree in the Saxon states than in the  more extensive Frankish territories. Such rudimentary practices as seem  parallel to early stages of feudal growth were more so in appearance than  in reality, and we can hardly affirm with any confidence that political  feudalism was even in process of formation in England before the  Conquest, though it would undoubtedly have been introduced there by some  process before very long.    The political feudal organization was as intimately bound up with the  possession of land as the economic, but its primary object was different.  It may be described as that form of organization in which the duties of  the citizen to the state had been changed into a species of land rent. A  set of legal arrangements and personal relationships which had grown up  wholly in the field of private affairs, for the serving of private ends,  had usurped the place of public law in the state. Duties of the citizen  and functions of the government were translated into its terms and  performed as incidents of a private obligation. The individual no longer  served in the army because this service was a part of his obligation as a  citizen, but because he had agreed by private contract to do so as a part  of the rent he was to pay for the land he held of another man. The  judicial organization was transformed in the same way. The national  courts disappeared, and their place was taken by private courts made up  of tenants. The king summoned at intervals the great men of Church and  State to gather round him in his council, law court, and legislature, in  so far as there was a legislature in that age, the curia regis, the  mother institution of a numerous progeny; but he did not summon them, and  they came no longer, because they were the great men of Church and State,  the wise men of the land, but because they had entered into a private  obligation with him to attend when called upon, as a return for lands  which he had given them; or, in other words, as Henry II told the bishops  in the Constitutions of Clarendon, because they were his vassals. Public  taxation underwent the same change, and the money revenue of the feudal  state which corresponds most nearly to the income of taxation, was made  up of irregular payments due on the occurrence of specified events from  those who held land of the king, and these in turn collected like  payments of their tenants; the relief, for instance, on the succession of  the heir to his father's holding, or the aids in three cases, on the  knighting of the lord's eldest son, the marrying of his eldest daughter,  and the ransom of his own person from imprisonment. The contact of the  central government with the mass of the men of the state was broken off  by the intervening series of lords who were political rulers each of the  territory or group of lands immediately subject to himself, and exercised  within those limits the functions which the general government should  normally exercise for the whole state. The payments and services which  the lord's vassals made to him, while they were of the nature of rent,  were not rent in the economic sense; they were important to the suzerain  less as matters of income than as defining his political power and  marking his rank in this hierarchical organization. The state as a whole  might retain its geographical outlines and the form of a common  government, but it was really broken up into fragments of varying size,  whose lords possessed in varying degrees of completeness the attributes  of sovereignty.    This organization, however, never usurped the place of the state so  completely as might be inferred. It had grown up within the limits of a  state which was, during the whole period of its formation, nominally  ruled over by a king who was served by a more or less centralized  administrative system. This royal power never entirely disappeared. It  survived as the conception of government, it survived in the exercise of  some rights everywhere, and of many rights in some places, even in the  most feudal of countries. Some feeling of public law and public duty  still lingered. In the king's court, the curia regis, whether in  England or in France, there was often present a small group of members,  at first in a minor and subordinate capacity, who were there, not because  they were the vassals of the king, but because they were the working  members of a government machine.

Various forms  are adopted by different makers, the straight side and the curved sides,  as shown in Fig. 4, being most commonly used. The proportions as regards  length to breadth are also varied continually. In fact, no two makers of  fans use the same shapes.    [Illustration: FIG. 3]    As the work done by a fan consists in imparting motion at a stated  velocity to a given weight of air, it is very easy to calculate the  power which must be expended to do a certain amount of work. The  velocity at which the air leaves the fan cannot be greater than that of  the fan tips. In a good fan it may be about two-thirds of that speed.  The resistance to be overcome will be found by multiplying the area of  the fan blades by the pressure of the air and by the velocity of the  center of effort, which must be determined for every fan according to  the shape of its blades. The velocity imparted to the air by the fan  will be just the same as though the air fell in a mass from a given  height. This height can be found by the formula h = v squared / 64; that is to  say, if the velocity be multiplied by itself and divided by 64 we have  the height. Thus, let the velocity be 88 per second, then 88 x 88 =  7,744, and 7,744 / 64 = 121. A stone or other body falling from a height  of 121 feet would have a velocity of 88 per second at the earth. The  pressure against the fan blades will be equal to that of a column of air  of the height due to the velocity, or, in this case, 121 feet. We  have seen that in round numbers 13 cubic feet of air weigh one pound,  consequently a column of air one square foot in section and 121 feet  high, will weigh as many pounds as 13 will go times into 121. Now, 121  / 13 = 9.3, and this will be the resistance in pounds per _square foot_  overcome by the fan. Let the aggregate area of all the blades be 2  square feet, and the velocity of the center of effort 90 feet per  second, then the power expended will bve (90 x 60 x 2 x 9.3) / 33,000  = 3.04 horse power. The quantity of air delivered ought to be equal in  volume to that of a column with a sectional area equal that of one fan  blade moving at 88 feet per second, or a mile a minute. The blade having  an area of 1 square foot, the delivery ought to be 5,280 feet per  minute, weighing 5,280 / 13 = 406.1 lb. In practice we need hardly say  that such an efficiency is never attained.    [Illustration: FIG. 4]    The number of recorded experiments with fans is very small, and a great  deal of ignorance exists as to their true efficiency. Mr. Buckle is one  of the very few authorities on the subject. He gives the accompanying  table of proportions as the best for pressures of from 3 to 6 ounces per  square inch:    --------------------------------------------------------------                    |         Vanes.         | Diameter of inlet  Diameter of fans. |------------------------|    openings.                    |   Width.   |  Length.  |  --------------------------------------------------------------       ft. in.      |  ft. in.   | ft. in.   |       ft. in.        3  0        |   0   9    |  0   9    |        1   6        3  6        |   0  101/2   |  0  101/2   |        1   9        4  0        |   1   0    |  1   0    |        2   0        4  6        |   1   11/2   |  1   11/2   |        2   3        5  0        |   1   3    |  1   3    |        2   6        6  0        |   1   6    |  1   6    |        3   0                    |            |           |  --------------------------------------------------------------    For higher pressures the blades should be longer and narrower, and  the inlet openings smaller. The case is to be made in the form of an  arithmetical spiral widening, the space between the case and the blades  radially from the origin to the opening for discharge, and the upper  edge of the opening should be level with the lower side of the sweep of  the fan blade, somewhat as shown in Fig. 5.    [Illustration: FIG. 5]    A considerable number of patents has been taken out for improvements  in the construction of fans, but they all, or nearly all, relate to  modifications in the form of the case and of the blades. So far,  however, as is known, it appears that, while these things do exert a  marked influence on the noise made by a fan, and modify in some degree  the efficiency of the machine, that this last depends very much more on  the proportions adopted than on the shapes--so long as easy curves  are used and sharp angles avoided. In the case of fans running at low  speeds, it matters very little whether the curves are present or not;  but at high speeds the case is different.--_The Engineer_.           *       *       *       *       *          MACHINE FOR COMPRESSING COAL REFUSE INTO FUEL.      The problem as to how the refuse of coal shall be utilized has been  solved in the manufacture from it of an agglomerated artificial  fuel, which is coming more and more into general use on railways and  steamboats, in the industries, and even in domestic heating.    The qualities that a good agglomerating machine should present are as  follows:    1. Very great simplicity, inasmuch as it is called upon to operate in  an atmosphere charged with coal dust, pitch, and steam; and, under such  conditions, it is important that it may be easily got at for cleaning,  and that the changing of its parts (which wear rapidly) may be effected  without, so to speak, interrupting its running.    2. The compression must be powerful, and, that the product may be  homogeneous, must operate progressively and not by shocks. It must  especially act as much as possible upon the entire surface of the  conglomerate, and this is something that most machines fail to do.    3. The removal from the mould must be effected easily, and not depend  upon a play of pistons or springs, which soon become foul, and the  operation of which is very irregular.    The operations embraced in the manufacture of this kind of fuel are as  follows:    The refuse is sifted in order to separate the dust from the grains of  coal. The dust is not submitted to a washing. The grains are classed  into two sizes, after removing the nut size, which is sold separately.  The grains of each size are washed separately. The washed grains are  either drained or dried by a hydro-extractor in order to free them from  the greater part of the water, the presence of this being an obstacle to  their perfect agglomeration. The water, however, should not be entirely  extracted because the combustibles being poor conductors of heat, a  certain amount of dampness must be preserved to obtain an equal division  of heat in the paste when the mixture is warmed.    After being dried the grains are mixed with the coal dust, and broken  coal pitch is added in the proportion of eight to ten per cent. of the  coal. The mixture is then thrown into a crushing machine, where it is  reduced to powder and intimately mixed. It then passes into a pug-mill  into which superheated steam is admitted, and by this means is converted  into a plastic paste. This paste is then led into an agitator for the  double purpose of freeing it from the steam that it contains, and of  distributing it in the moulds of the compressing machine.    [Illustration: IMPROVED MACHINE FOR COMPRESSING REFUSE COAL INTO FUEL.]    Bilan's machine, shown in the accompanying cut, is designed for  manufacturing spherical conglomerates for domestic purposes. It consists  of a cast iron frame supporting four vertical moulding wheels placed at  right angles to each other and tangent to the line of the centers. These  wheels carry on their periphery cavities that have the form of a quarter  of a sphere. They thus form at the point of contact a complete sphere  in which the material is inclosed. The paste is thrown by shovel, or  emptied by buckets and chain, into the hopper fixed at the upper part  of the frame. From here it is taken up by two helices, mounted on a  vertical shaft traversing the hopper, and forced toward the point where  the four moulding wheels meet. The driving pulley of the machine is  keyed upon a horizontal shaft which is provided with two endless screws  that actuate two gear-wheels, and these latter set in motion the four  moulding wheels by means of beveled pinions. The four moulding wheels  being accurately adjusted so that their cavities meet each other at  every revolution, carry along the paste furnished them by the hopper,  compress it powerfully on the four quarters, and, separating by a  further revolution, allow the finished ball to drop out.    The external crown of the wheels carrying the moulds consists of four  segments, which may be taken apart at will to be replaced by others when  worn.    This machine produces about 40 tons per day of this globular artificial  fuel.--_Annales Industrielles_.           *       *       *       *       *          HANK SIZING AND WRINGING MACHINE.      We give a view of a hank sizing machine by Messrs. Heywood & Spencer,  of Radcliffe, near Manchester. The machine is also suitable for fancy  dyeing. It is well known, says the _Textile Manufacturer_, that when  hanks are wrung by hand, not only is the labor very severe, but in  dyeing it is scarcely possible to obtain even colors, and, furthermore,  the production is limited by the capabilities of the man. The machine  we illustrate is intended to perform the heavy part of the work with  greater expedition and with more certainty than could be relied upon  with hand labor. The illustration represents the machine that we  inspected. Its construction seems of the simplest character. It consists  of two vats, between which is placed the gearing for driving the hooks.  The large wheel in this gear, although it always runs in one direction,  contains internal segments, which fall into gear alternately with  pinions on the shanks of the hooks.
