Pranabanandaji  suddenly halted to ask me this question.    \"'About half an hour.'    \"'I have something else to do at present.' He gave me an enigmatical  glance. 'I must leave you behind. You can join me in my house,  where Bhagabati's son and I will be awaiting you.'    \"Before I could remonstrate, he dashed swiftly past me and disappeared  in the crowd. I walked here as fast as possible.\"    This explanation only increased my bewilderment. I inquired how  long he had known the swami.    \"We met a few times last year, but not recently. I was very glad  to see him again today at the bathing GHAT.\"    \"I cannot believe my ears! Am I losing my mind? Did you meet him  in a vision, or did you actually see him, touch his hand, and hear  the sound of his feet?\"    \"I don't know what you're driving at!\" He flushed angrily. \"I am  not lying to you. Can't you understand that only through the swami  could I have known you were waiting at this place for me?\"    \"Why, that man, Swami Pranabananda, has not left my sight a moment  since I first came about an hour ago.\" I blurted out the whole  story.    His eyes opened widely. \"Are we living in this material age, or  are we dreaming? I never expected to witness such a miracle in my  life! I thought this swami was just an ordinary man, and now I find  he can materialize an extra body and work through it!\" Together we  entered the saint's room.    \"Look, those are the very sandals he was wearing at the GHAT,\"  Kedar Nath Babu whispered. \"He was clad only in a loincloth, just  as I see him now.\"    As the visitor bowed before him, the saint turned to me with a  quizzical smile.    \"Why are you stupefied at all this? The subtle unity of the phenomenal  world is not hidden from true yogis. I instantly see and converse  with my disciples in distant Calcutta. They can similarly transcend  at will every obstacle of gross matter.\"    It was probably in an effort to stir spiritual ardor in my young  breast that the swami had condescended to tell me of his powers of  astral radio and television. {FN3-2} But instead of enthusiasm, I  experienced only an awe-stricken fear. Inasmuch as I was destined  to undertake my divine search through one particular guru-Sri  Yukteswar, whom I had not yet met-I felt no inclination to accept  Pranabananda as my teacher. I glanced at him doubtfully, wondering  if it were he or his counterpart before me.    [Illustration: Swami Pranabananda, \"The Saint With Two Bodies\", An  Exalted Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya--see pranabananda.jpg]    The master sought to banish my disquietude by bestowing a soul-awakening  gaze, and by some inspiring words about his guru.    \"Lahiri Mahasaya was the greatest yogi I ever knew. He was Divinity  Itself in the form of flesh.\"    If a disciple, I reflected, could materialize an extra fleshly form  at will, what miracles indeed could be barred to his master?    \"I will tell you how priceless is a guru's help. I used to meditate  with another disciple for eight hours every night. We had to work at  the railroad office during the day. Finding difficulty in carrying  on my clerical duties, I desired to devote my whole time to God.  For eight years I persevered, meditating half the night. I had  wonderful results; tremendous spiritual perceptions illumined my  mind. But a little veil always remained between me and the Infinite.  Even with super-human earnestness, I found the final irrevocable  union to be denied me. One evening I paid a visit to Lahiri Mahasaya  and pleaded for his divine intercession. My importunities continued  during the entire night.    \"'Angelic Guru, my spiritual anguish is such that I can no longer  bear my life without meeting the Great Beloved face to face!'    \"'What can I do? You must meditate more profoundly.'    \"'I am appealing to Thee, O God my Master! I see Thee materialized  before me in a physical body; bless me that I may perceive Thee in  Thine infinite form!'    \"Lahiri Mahasaya extended his hand in a benign gesture. 'You may  go now and meditate. I have interceded for you with Brahma.' {FN3-3}    \"Immeasurably uplifted, I returned to my home. In meditation that  night, the burning Goal of my life was achieved. Now I ceaselessly  enjoy the spiritual pension. Never from that day has the Blissful  Creator remained hidden from my eyes behind any screen of delusion.\"    Pranabananda's face was suffused with divine light. The peace of  another world entered my heart; all fear had fled. The saint made  a further confidence.    \"Some months later I returned to Lahiri Mahasaya and tried to  thank him for his bestowal of the infinite gift. Then I mentioned  another matter.    \"'Divine Guru, I can no longer work in the office. Please release  me.  Brahma keeps me continuously intoxicated.'    \"'Apply for a pension from your company.'    \"'What reason shall I give, so early in my service?'    \"'Say what you feel.'    \"The next day I made my application. The doctor inquired the grounds  for my premature request.    \"'At work, I find an overpowering sensation rising in my spine.  {FN3-4} It permeates my whole body, unfitting me for the performance  of my duties.'    \"Without further questioning the physician recommended me highly  for a pension, which I soon received. I know the divine will of  Lahiri Mahasaya worked through the doctor and the railroad officials,  including your father. Automatically they obeyed the great guru's  spiritual direction, and freed me for a life of unbroken communion  with the Beloved.\" {FN3-5}    After this extraordinary revelation, Swami Pranabananda retired  into one of his long silences. As I was taking leave, touching his  feet reverently, he gave me his blessing:    \"Your life belongs to the path of renunciation and yoga. I shall  see you again, with your father, later on.\" The years brought  fulfillment to both these predictions. {FN3-6}    Kedar Nath Babu walked by my side in the gathering darkness. I  delivered Father's letter, which my companion read under a street  lamp.    \"Your father suggests that I take a position in the Calcutta office  of his railroad company. How pleasant to look forward to at least  one of the pensions that Swami Pranabananda enjoys! But it is  impossible; I cannot leave Benares. Alas, two bodies are not yet  for me!\"    {FN3-1} CHOTO MAHASAYA is the term by which a number of Indian  saints addressed me. It translates \"little sir.\".    {FN3-2} In its own way, physical science is affirming the validity  of laws discovered by yogis through mental science. For example,  a demonstration that man has televisional powers was given on Nov.  26, 1934 at the Royal University of Rome. \"Dr. Giuseppe Calligaris,  professor of neuro-psychology, pressed certain points of a subject's  body and the subject responded with minute descriptions of other  persons and objects on the opposite side of a wall. Dr. Calligaris  told the other professors that if certain areas on the skin are  agitated, the subject is given super-sensorial impressions enabling  him to see objects that he could not otherwise perceive. To enable  his subject to discern things on the other side of a wall, Professor  Calligaris pressed on a spot to the right of the thorax for fifteen  minutes. Dr. Calligaris said that if other spots of the body were  agitated, the subjects could see objects at any distance, regardless  of whether they had ever before seen those objects.\".    {FN3-3} God in His aspect of Creator; from Sanskrit root BRIH, to  expand. When Emerson's poem BRAHMA appeared in the ATLANTIC MONTHLY  in 1857, most the readers were bewildered. Emerson chuckled. \"Tell  them,\" he said, \"to say 'Jehovah' instead of 'Brahma' and they will  not feel any perplexity.\"    {FN3-4} In deep meditation, the first experience of Spirit is on the  altar of the spine, and then in the brain. The torrential bliss is  overwhelming, but the yogi learns to control its outward manifestations.    {FN3-5} After his retirement, Pranabananda wrote one of the most  profound commentaries on the BHAGAVAD GITA, available in Bengali  and Hindi.    {FN3-6} See chapter 27.        CHAPTER: 4    MY INTERRUPTED FLIGHT TOWARD THE HIMALAYAS    \"Leave your classroom on some trifling pretext, and engage a hackney  carriage. Stop in the lane where no one in my house can see you.\"    These were my final instructions to Amar Mitter, a high school  friend who planned to accompany me to the Himalayas. We had chosen  the following day for our flight. Precautions were necessary,  as Ananta exercised a vigilant eye. He was determined to foil the  plans of escape which he suspected were uppermost in my mind. The  amulet, like a spiritual yeast, was silently at work within me.  Amidst the Himalayan snows, I hoped to find the master whose face  often appeared to me in visions.    The family was living now in Calcutta, where Father had been  permanently transferred. Following the patriarchal Indian custom,  Ananta had brought his bride to live in our home, now at 4 Gurpar  Road. There in a small attic room I engaged in daily meditations  and prepared my mind for the divine search.    The memorable morning arrived with inauspicious rain. Hearing the  wheels of Amar's carriage in the road, I hastily tied together a  blanket, a pair of sandals, Lahiri Mahasaya's picture, a copy of  the BHAGAVAD GITA, a string of prayer beads, and two loincloths.  This bundle I threw from my third-story window. I ran down the  steps and passed my uncle, buying fish at the door.    \"What is the excitement?\" His gaze roved suspiciously over my  person.    I gave him a noncommittal smile and walked to the lane. Retrieving  my bundle, I joined Amar with conspiratorial caution. We drove to  Chadni Chowk, a merchandise center. For months we had been saving  our tiffin money to buy English clothes. Knowing that my clever  brother could easily play the part of a detective, we thought to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7471"],[0,"The Man with Two Left Feet, and Other Stories (#6)"],[1,", he's a fine old boy, but as obstinate as  a mule, and he didn't like the idea of Ray marrying me because I wasn't  in the profession. Wouldn't hear of it. Well, you remember at Oxford I  could always sing a song pretty well; so Ray got hold of old Riesbitter  and made him promise to come and hear me rehearse and get me bookings  if he liked my work. She stands high with him. She coached me for  weeks, the darling. And now, as you heard him say, he's booked me in  the small time at thirty-five dollars a week.'    I steadied myself against the wall. The effects of the restoratives  supplied by my pal at the hotel bar were beginning to work off, and I  felt a little weak. Through a sort of mist I seemed to have a vision of  Aunt Agatha hearing that the head of the Mannering-Phippses was about  to appear on the vaudeville stage. Aunt Agatha's worship of the family  name amounts to an obsession. The Mannering-Phippses were an  old-established clan when William the Conqueror was a small boy going  round with bare legs and a catapult. For centuries they have called  kings by their first names and helped dukes with their weekly rent; and  there's practically nothing a Mannering-Phipps can do that doesn't blot  his escutcheon. So what Aunt Agatha would say--beyond saying that it  was all my fault--when she learned the horrid news, it was beyond me to  imagine.    'Come back to the hotel, Gussie,' I said. 'There's a sportsman there  who mixes things he calls \"lightning whizzers\". Something tells me I  need one now. And excuse me for one minute, Gussie. I want to send a  cable.'    It was clear to me by now that Aunt Agatha had picked the wrong man for  this job of disentangling Gussie from the clutches of the American  vaudeville profession. What I needed was reinforcements. For a moment I  thought of cabling Aunt Agatha to come over, but reason told me that  this would be overdoing it. I wanted assistance, but not so badly as  that. I hit what seemed to me the happy mean. I cabled to Gussie's  mother and made it urgent.    'What were you cabling about?' asked Gussie, later.    'Oh just to say I had arrived safely, and all that sort of tosh,' I  answered.           *       *       *       *       *    Gussie opened his vaudeville career on the following Monday at a rummy  sort of place uptown where they had moving pictures some of the time  and, in between, one or two vaudeville acts. It had taken a lot of  careful handling to bring him up to scratch. He seemed to take my  sympathy and assistance for granted, and I couldn't let him down. My  only hope, which grew as I listened to him rehearsing, was that he  would be such a frightful frost at his first appearance that he would  never dare to perform again; and, as that would automatically squash  the marriage, it seemed best to me to let the thing go on.    He wasn't taking any chances. On the Saturday and Sunday we practically  lived in a beastly little music-room at the offices of the publishers  whose songs he proposed to use. A little chappie with a hooked nose  sucked a cigarette and played the piano all day. Nothing could tire  that lad. He seemed to take a personal interest in the thing.    Gussie would cleat his throat and begin:    'There's a great big choo-choo waiting at the deepo.'    THE CHAPPIE (playing chords): 'Is that so? What's it waiting for?'    GUSSIE (rather rattled at the interruption): 'Waiting for me.'    THE CHAPPIE (surprised): For you?'    GUSSIE (sticking to it): 'Waiting for me-e-ee!'    THE CHAPPIE (sceptically): 'You don't say!'    GUSSIE: 'For I'm off to Tennessee.'    THE CHAPPIE (conceding a point): 'Now, I live at Yonkers.'    He did this all through the song. At first poor old Gussie asked him to  stop, but the chappie said, No, it was always done. It helped to get  pep into the thing. He appealed to me whether the thing didn't want a  bit of pep, and I said it wanted all the pep it could get. And the  chappie said to Gussie, 'There you are!' So Gussie had to stand it.    The other song that he intended to sing was one of those moon songs. He  told me in a hushed voice that he was using it because it was one of  the songs that the girl Ray sang when lifting them out of their seats  at Mosenstein's and elsewhere. The fact seemed to give it sacred  associations for him.    You will scarcely believe me, but the management expected Gussie to  show up and start performing at one o'clock in the afternoon. I told  him they couldn't be serious, as they must know that he would be  rolling out for a bit of lunch at that hour, but Gussie said this was  the usual thing in the four-a-day, and he didn't suppose he would ever  get any lunch again until he landed on the big time. I was just  condoling with him, when I found that he was taking it for granted that  I should be there at one o'clock, too. My idea had been that I should  look in at night, when--if he survived--he would be coming up for the  fourth time; but I've never deserted a pal in distress, so I said  good-bye to the little lunch I'd been planning at a rather decent  tavern I'd discovered on Fifth Avenue, and trailed along. They were  showing pictures when I reached my seat. It was one of those Western  films, where the cowboy jumps on his horse and rides across country at  a hundred and fifty miles an hour to escape the sheriff, not knowing,  poor chump! that he might just as well stay where he is, the sheriff  having a horse of his own which can do three hundred miles an hour  without coughing. I was just going to close my eyes and try to forget  till they put Gussie's name up when I discovered that I was sitting  next to a deucedly pretty girl.    No, let me be honest. When I went in I had seen that there was a  deucedly pretty girl sitting in that particular seat, so I had taken  the next one. What happened now was that I began, as it were, to drink  her in. I wished they would turn the lights up so that I could see her  better. She was rather small, with great big eyes and a ripping smile.  It was a shame to let all that run to seed, so to speak, in  semi-darkness.    Suddenly the lights did go up, and the orchestra began to play a tune  which, though I haven't much of an ear for music, seemed somehow  familiar. The next instant out pranced old Gussie from the wings in a  purple frock-coat and a brown top-hat, grinned feebly at the audience,  tripped over his feet, blushed, and began to sing the Tennessee song.    It was rotten. The poor nut had got stage fright so badly that it  practically eliminated his voice. He sounded like some far-off echo of  the past 'yodelling' through a woollen blanket.    For the first time since I had heard that he was about to go into  vaudeville I felt a faint hope creeping over me. I was sorry for the  wretched chap, of course, but there was no denying that the thing had  its bright side. No management on earth would go on paying thirty-five  dollars a week for this sort of performance. This was going to be  Gussie's first and only. He would have to leave the profession. The old  boy would say, 'Unhand my daughter'. And, with decent luck, I saw  myself leading Gussie on to the next England-bound liner and handing  him over intact to Aunt Agatha.    He got through the song somehow and limped off amidst roars of silence  from the audience. There was a brief respite, then out he came again.    He sang this time as if nobody loved him. As a song, it was not a very  pathetic song, being all about coons spooning in June under the moon,  and so on and so forth, but Gussie handled it in such a sad, crushed  way that there was genuine anguish in every line. By the time he  reached the refrain I was nearly in tears. It seemed such a rotten sort  of world with all that kind of thing going on in it.    He started the refrain, and then the most frightful thing happened. The  girl next to me got up in her seat, chucked her head back, and began to  sing too. I say 'too', but it wasn't really too, because her first note  stopped Gussie dead, as if he had been pole-axed.    I never felt so bally conspicuous in my life. I huddled down in my seat  and wished I could turn my collar up. Everybody seemed to be looking at  me.    In the midst of my agony I caught sight of Gussie. A complete change  had taken place in the old lad. He was looking most frightfully bucked.  I must say the girl was singing most awfully well, and it seemed to act  on Gussie like a tonic. When she came to the end of the refrain, he  took it up, and they sang it together, and the end of it was that he  went off the popular hero. The audience yelled for more, and were only  quieted when they turned down the lights and put on a film.    When I had recovered I tottered round to see Gussie. I found him  sitting on a box behind the stage, looking like one who had seen  visions.    'Isn't she a wonder, Bertie?' he said, devoutly. 'I hadn't a notion she  was going to be there. She's playing at the Auditorium this week, and  she can only just have had time to get back to her _matinee_. She  risked being late, just to come and see me through. She's my good  angel, Bertie. She saved me. If she hadn't helped me out I don't know  what would have happened. I was so nervous I didn't know what I was  doing. Now that I've got through the first show I shall be all right.'    I was glad I had sent that cable to his mother. I was going to need  her. The thing had got beyond me.           *       *       *       *       *    During the next week I saw a lot of old Gussie, and was introduced to  the girl. I also met her father, a formidable old boy with quick  eyebrows and a sort of determined expression. On the following  Wednesday Aunt Julia arrived. Mrs Mannering-Phipps, my aunt Julia, is,  I think, the most dignified person I know. She lacks Aunt Agatha's  punch, but in a quiet way she has always contrived to make me feel,  from boyhood up, that I was a poor worm. Not that she harries me like  Aunt Agatha."]]]
