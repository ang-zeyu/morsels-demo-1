In the sunlight it looks like a small pool, and the  goddess of love seems to rise from the undulations of its mirror-like  surface. About her head a swarm of gnats is dancing, which,  illuminated by the sun, seem to hover above her like an aureole.    Wanda is enjoying the lovely scene. As all the benches along the  walk are still wet, she supports herself on my arm to rest a while.  A soft weariness permeates her whole being, her eyes are half closed;  I feel the touch of her breath on my cheek.    How I managed to get up courage enough I really don't know, but I  took hold of her hand, asking,    \"Could you love me?\"    \"Why not,\" she replied, letting her calm, clear look rest upon me,  but not for long.    A moment later I am kneeling before her, pressing my burning face  against the fragrant muslin of her gown.    \"But Severin--this isn't right,\" she cried.    But I take hold of her little foot, and press my lips upon it.    \"You are getting worse and worse!\" she cried. She tore herself free,  and fled rapidly toward the house, the while her adorable slipper  remained in my hand.    Is it an omen?           *       *       *       *       *    All day long I didn't dare to go near her. Toward evening as I was  sitting in my arbor her gay red head peered suddenly through the  greenery of her balcony. \"Why don't you come up?\" he called down  impatiently.    I ran upstairs, and at the top lost courage again. I knocked very  lightly. She didn't say come-in, but opened the door herself, and  stood on the threshold.    \"Where is my slipper?\"    \"It is--I have--I want,\" I stammered.    \"Get it, and then we will have tea together, and chat.\"    When I returned, she was engaged in making tea. I ceremoniously  placed the slipper on the table, and stood in the corner like a child  awaiting punishment.    I noticed that her brows were slightly contracted, and there was an  expression of hardness and dominance about her lips which delighted  me.    All of a sudden she broke out laughing.    \"So--you are really in love--with me?\"    \"Yes, and I suffer more from it than you can imagine?\"    \"You suffer?\" she laughed again.    I was revolted, mortified, annihilated, but all this was quite  useless.    \"Why?\" she continued, \"I like you, with all my heart.\"    She gave me her hand, and looked at me in the friendliest fashion.    \"And will you be my wife?\"    Wanda looked at me--how did she look at me? I think first of all  with surprise, and then with a tinge of irony.    \"What has given you so much courage, all at once?\"    \"Courage?\"    \"Yes courage, to ask anyone to be your wife, and me in particular?\"  She lifted up the slipper. \"Was it through a sudden friendship with  this? But joking aside. Do you really wish to marry me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, Severin, that is a serious matter. I believe, you love me,  and I care for you too, and what is more important each of us finds  the other interesting. There is no danger that we would soon get  bored, but, you know, I am a fickle person, and just for that reason  I take marriage seriously. If I assume obligations, I want to be able  to meet them. But I am afraid--no--it would hurt you.\"    \"Please be perfectly frank with me,\" I replied.    \"Well then honestly, I don't believe I could love a man longer than--\"  She inclined her head gracefully to one side and mused.    \"A year.\"    \"What do you imagine--a month perhaps.\"    \"Not even me?\"    \"Oh you--perhaps two.\"    \"Two months!\" I exclaimed.    \"Two months is very long.\"    \"You go beyond antiquity, madame.\"    \"You see, you cannot stand the truth.\"    Wanda walked across the room and leaned back against the fireplace,  watching me and resting one of her arms on the mantelpiece.    \"What shall I do with you?\" she began anew.    \"Whatever you wish,\" I replied with resignation, \"whatever will give  you pleasure.\"    \"How illogical!\" she cried, \"first you want to make me your wife,  and then you offer yourself to me as something to toy with.\"    \"Wanda--I love you.\"    \"Now we are back to the place where we started. You love me, and  want to make me your wife, but I don't want to enter into a new  marriage, because I doubt the permanence of both my and your  feelings.\"    \"But if I am willing to take the risk with you?\" I replied.    \"But it also depends on whether I am willing to risk it with you,\"  she said quietly. \"I can easily imagine belonging to one man for my  entire life, but he would have to be a whole man, a man who would  dominate me, who would subjugate me by his inate strength, do you  understand? And every man--I know this very well--as soon as he falls  in love becomes weak, pliable, ridiculous. He puts himself into the  woman's hands, kneels down before her. The only man whom I could love  permanently would be he before whom I should have to kneel. I've gotten  to like you so much, however, that I'll try it with you.\"    I fell down at her feet.    \"For heaven's sake, here you are kneeling already,\" she said  mockingly. \"You are making a good beginning.\" When I had risen again  she continued, \"I will give you a year's time to win me, to convince  me that we are suited to each other, that we might live together. If  you succeed, I will become your wife, and a wife, Severin, who will  conscientiously and strictly perform all her duties. During this year  we will live as though we were married--\"    My blood rose to my head.    In her eyes too there was a sudden flame--    \"We will live together,\" she continued, \"share our daily life, so that  we may find out whether we are really fitted for each other. _I grant  you all the rights of a husband, of a lover, of a friend._ Are you  satisfied?\"    \"I suppose, I'll have to be?\"    \"You don't have to.\"    \"Well then, I want to--\"    \"Splendid. That is how a man speaks. Here is my hand.\"           *       *       *       *       *    For ten days I have been with her every hour, except at night. All  the time I was allowed to look into her eyes, hold her hands, listen  to what she said, accompany her wherever she went.    My love seems to me like a deep, bottomless abyss, into which I  subside deeper and deeper. There is nothing now which could save me  from it.    This afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of the  Venus-statue. I plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap; she  wound them into wreaths with which we adorned our goddess.    Suddenly Wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became  confused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration. Losing  command over myself, I threw my arms about her and clung to her lips,  and she--she drew me close to her heaving breast.    \"Are you angry?\" I then asked her.    \"I am never angry at anything that is natural--\" she replied, \"but  _I_ am afraid you suffer.\"    \"Oh, I am suffering frightfully.\"    \"Poor friend!\" she brushed my disordered hair back from my fore-head. \"I  hope it isn't through any fault of mine.\"    \"No--\" I replied,--\"and yet my love for you has become a sort of  madness. The thought that I might lose you, perhaps actually lose  you, torments me day and night.\"    \"But you don't yet possess me,\" said Wanda, and again she looked at  me with that vibrant, consuming expression, which had already once  before carried me away. Then she rose, and with her small transparent  hands placed a wreath of blue anemones upon the ringletted white head  of Venus. Half against my will I threw my arm around her body.    \"I can no longer live without you, oh wonderful woman,\" I said.  \"Believe me, believe only this once, that this time it is not a  phrase, not a thing of dreams. I feel deep down in my innermost soul,  that my life belongs inseparably with yours. If you leave me, I shall  perish, go to pieces.\"    \"That will hardly be necessary, for I love you,\" she took hold of my  chin, \"you foolish man!\"    \"But you will be mine only under conditions, while I belong to you  unconditionally--\"    \"That isn't wise, Severin,\" she replied almost with a start. \"Don't  you know me yet, do you absolutely refuse to know me? I am good when  I am treated seriously and reasonably, but when you abandon yourself  too absolutely to me, I grow arrogant--\"    \"So be it, be arrogant, be despotic,\" I cried in the fulness of  exaltation, \"only be mine, mine forever.\" I lay at her feet,  embracing her knees.    \"Things will end badly, my friend,\" she said soberly, without moving.    \"It shall never end,\" I cried excitedly, almost violently. \"Only death  shall part us. If you cannot be mine, all mine and for always, then _I  want to be your slave_, serve you, suffer everything from you, if only  you won't drive me away.\"    \"Calm yourself,\" she said, bending down and kissing my forehead, \"I  am really very fond of you, but your way is not the way to win and  hold me.\"    \"I want to do everything, absolutely everything, that you want, only  not to lose you,\" I cried, \"only not that, I cannot bear the thought.\"    \"Do get up.\"    I obeyed.    \"You are a strange person,\" continued Wanda. \"You wish to possess me  at any price?\"    \"Yes, at any price.\"    \"But of what value, for instance, would that be?\"--She pondered; a  lurking uncanny expression entered her eyes--\"If I no longer loved  you, if I belonged to another.\"    A shudder ran through me. I looked at her She stood firmly and  confident before me, and her eyes disclosed a cold gleam.    \"You see,\" she continued, \"the very thought frightens you.\" A  beautiful smile suddenly illuminated her face.    \"I feel a perfect horror, when I imagine, that the woman I love and  who has responded to my love could give herself to another regardless  of me. But have I still a choice? If I love such a woman, even unto  madness, shall I turn my back to her and lose everything for the sake  of a bit of boastful strength; shall I send a bullet through my  brains? I have two ideals of woman.

He had seen Fenn go into  the shop, and wished to talk to him. He had not seen him after the  concert, and he thought it would be interesting to know how Kay had  taken it, and what his comments had been on meeting Fenn in the house  that night.    Fenn had not much to say.    \"He was rather worried,\" he said, grinning as if the recollection of  the interview amused him. \"But he couldn't do anything. Of course,  there'll be a row next term, but it can't be helped.\"    \"If I were you,\" said Silver, \"I should point out to them that you'd a  perfect right to play what you liked for an encore. How were you to  know the gallery would go off like that? You aren't responsible for  them. Hullo, there's that bugle. Things seem to be on the move. We  must go.\"    \"So long,\" said Fenn.    \"Goodbye. Mind you come off against Middlesex.\"    Kennedy stayed for a moment.    \"Has the Old Man said anything to you yet?\" he asked.    \"Not yet. He'll do that next term. It'll be something to look forward  to.\"    Kennedy hurried off to take his place in the ranks.    Getting to camp at the end of the summer term is always a nuisance.  Aldershot seems a long way from everywhere, and the trains take their  time over the journey. Then, again, the heat always happens to be  particularly oppressive on that day. Snow may have fallen on the day  before, but directly one sets out for camp, the thermometer goes up  into three figures. The Eckleton contingent marched into the lines  damp and very thirsty.    Most of the other schools were already on the spot, and looked as if  they had been spending the last few years there. There was nothing  particular going on when the Eckleton warriors arrived, and everybody  was lounging about in khaki and shirt-sleeves, looking exasperatingly  cool. The only consolation which buoyed up the spirits of Eckleton  was the reflection that in a short space of time, when the  important-looking gentleman in uniform who had come to meet them had  said all he wanted to say on the subject of rules and regulations,  they would be like that too. Happy thought! If the man bucked up and  cut short the peroration, there would be time for a bathe in Cove  Reservoir. Those of the corps who had been to camp in previous years  felt quite limp with the joy of the thought. Why couldn't he get  through with it, and give a fellow a chance of getting cool again?    The gist of the oration was apparently that the Eckleton cadets were  to consider themselves not only as soldiers--and as such subject to  military discipline, and the rules for the conduct of troops quartered  in the Aldershot district--but also as members of a public school. In  short, that if they misbehaved themselves they would get cells, and a  hundred lines in the same breath, as it were.    The corps knew all this ages ago. The man seemed to think he was  telling them something fresh. They began positively to dislike him  after a while.    He finished at last. Eckleton marched off wearily, but in style, to  its lines.    \"Dis-miss!\"    They did.    \"And about time, too,\" said Jimmy Silver. \"I wish they would tie that  man up, or something. He's one of the worst bores I know. He may be  full of bright conversation in private life, but in public he will  talk about his beastly military regulations. You can't stop him. It's  a perfect mania with him. Now, I believe--that's to say, I have a sort  of dim idea--that there's a place round about here called a canteen. I  seem to remember such a thing vaguely. We might go and look for it.\"    Kennedy made no objection.    This was his first appearance at camp. Jimmy Silver, on the other  hand, was a veteran. He had been there twice before, and meant to go  again. He had a peculiar and extensive knowledge of the ins and outs  of the place. Kennedy was quite willing to take him as his guide. He  was full of information. Kennedy was surprised to see what a number of  men from the other schools he seemed to know. In the canteen there  were, amongst others, a Carthusian, two Tonbridge men, and a  Haileyburian. They all greeted Silver with the warmth of old friends.    \"You get to know a lot of fellows in camp,\" explained Jimmy, as they  strolled back to the Eckleton lines. \"That's the best of the place.  Camp's the best place on earth, if only you have decent weather. See  that chap over there? He came here last year. He'd never been before,  and one of the things he didn't know was that Cove Reservoir's only  about three feet deep round the sides. He took a running dive, and  almost buried himself in the mud. It's about two feet deep. He told me  afterwards he swallowed pounds of it. Rather bad luck. Somebody ought  to have told him. You can't do much diving here.\"    \"Glad you mentioned it,\" said Kennedy. \"I should have dived myself if  you hadn't.\"    Many other curious and diverting facts did the expert drag from the  bonded warehouse of his knowledge. Nothing changes at camp. Once get  to know the ropes, and you know them for all time.    \"The one thing I bar,\" he said, \"is having to get up at half-past  five. And one day in the week, when there's a divisional field-day,  it's half-past four. It's hardly worth while going to sleep at all.  Still, it isn't so bad as it used to be. The first year I came to camp  we used to have to do a three hours' field-day before brekker. We used  to have coffee before it, and nothing else till it was over. By Jove,  you felt you'd had enough of it before you got back. This is Laffan's  Plain. The worst of Laffan's Plain is that you get to know it too  well. You get jolly sick of always starting on field-days from the  same place, and marching across the same bit of ground. Still, I  suppose they can't alter the scenery for our benefit. See that man  there? He won the sabres at Aldershot last year. That chap with him is  in the Clifton footer team.\"    When a school corps goes to camp, it lives in a number of tents, and,  as a rule, each house collects in a tent of its own. Blackburn's had a  tent, and further down the line Kay's had assembled. The Kay  contingent were under Wayburn, a good sort, as far as he himself was  concerned, but too weak to handle a mob like Kay's. Wayburn was not  coming back after the holidays, a fact which perhaps still further  weakened his hold on the Kayites. They had nothing to fear from him  next term.    Kay's was represented at camp by a dozen or so of its members, of whom  young Billy Silver alone had any pretensions to the esteem of his  fellow man. Kay's was the rowdiest house in the school, and the cream  of its rowdy members had come to camp. There was Walton, for one, a  perfect specimen of the public school man at his worst. There was  Mortimer, another of Kay's gems. Perry, again, and Callingham, and the  rest. A pleasant gang, fit for anything, if it could be done in  safety.    Kennedy observed them, and--the spectacle starting a train of  thought--asked Jimmy Silver, as they went into their tent just before  lights-out, if there was much ragging in camp.    \"Not very much,\" said the expert. \"Chaps are generally too done up at  the end of the day to want to do anything except sleep. Still, I've  known cases. You sometimes get one tent mobbing another. They loose  the ropes, you know. Low trick, I think. It isn't often done, and it  gets dropped on like bricks when it's found out. But why? Do you feel  as if you wanted to do it?\"    \"It only occurred to me that we've got a lively gang from Kay's here.  I was wondering if they'd get any chances of ragging, or if they'd  have to lie low.\"    \"I'd forgotten Kay's for the moment. Now you mention it, they are  rather a crew. But I shouldn't think they'd find it worth while to rot  about here. It isn't as if they were on their native heath. People  have a prejudice against having their tent-ropes loosed, and they'd  get beans if they did anything in that line. I remember once there was  a tent which made itself objectionable, and it got raided in the night  by a sort of vigilance committee from the other schools, and the chaps  in it got the dickens of a time. None of them ever came to camp again.  I hope Kay's'll try and behave decently. It'll be an effort for them;  but I hope they'll make it. It would be an awful nuisance if young  Billy made an ass of himself in any way. He loves making an ass of  himself. It's a sort of hobby of his.\"    As if to support the statement, a sudden volley of subdued shouts came  from the other end of the Eckleton lines.    \"Go it, Wren!\"    \"Stick to it, Silver!\"    \"Wren!\"    \"Silver!\"    \"S-s-h!\"    Silence, followed almost immediately by a gruff voice inquiring with  simple directness what the dickens all this noise was about.    \"Hullo!\" said Kennedy. \"Did you hear that? I wonder what's been up?  Your brother was in it, whatever it was.\"    \"Of course,\" said Jimmy Silver, \"he would be. We can't find out about  it now, though. I'll ask him tomorrow, if I remember. I shan't  remember, of course. Good night.\"    \"Good night.\"    Half an hour later, Kennedy, who had been ruminating over the incident  in his usual painstaking way, reopened the debate.    \"Who's Wren?\" he asked.    \"Wha'?\" murmured Silver, sleepily.    \"Who's Wren?\" repeated Kennedy.    \"I d'know.... Oh.... Li'l' beast.... Kay's.... Red hair.... G'-ni'.\"    And sleep reigned in Blackburn's tent.          VI    THE RAID ON THE GUARD-TENT      Wren and Billy Silver had fallen out over a question of space. It was  Silver's opinion that Wren's nest ought to have been built a foot or  two further to the left. He stated baldly that he had not room to  breathe, and requested the red-headed one to ease off a point or so in  the direction of his next-door neighbour. Wren had refused, and, after  a few moments' chatty conversation, smote William earnestly in the  wind. Trouble had begun upon the instant. It had ceased "]]]
