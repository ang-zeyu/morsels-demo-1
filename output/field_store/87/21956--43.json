I allow that they are somewhat behind the whites in  intellectual culture; but I believe that this is not because they  are deficient in understanding, but because their education is  totally neglected.  No schools are erected for them, no instruction  given them--in a word, not the least thing is done to develop the  capabilities of their minds.  As was the case in old despotic  countries, their minds are purposely kept enchained; for, were they  once to awake from their present condition, the consequences to the  whites might be fearful.  They are four times as numerous as the  latter, and if they ever become conscious of this superiority, the  whites might probably be placed in the position that the unhappy  blacks have hitherto occupied.    But I am losing myself in conjectures and reasonings which may,  perhaps, become the pen of a learned man, but certainly not mine,  since I assuredly do not possess the necessary amount of education  to decide upon such questions; my object is merely to give a plain  description of what I have seen.    Although the number of slaves in the Brazils is very great, there is  nowhere such a thing as a slave-market.  The importation of them is  publicly prohibited, yet thousands are smuggled in every year, and  disposed of in some underhand manner, which every one knows, and  every one employs.  It is true, that English ships are constantly  cruising off the coasts of Brazil and Africa, but even if a slaver  happen to fall into their hands, the poor blacks, I was told, were  no more free than if they had come to the Brazils.  They are all  transported to the English colonies, where, at the expiration of ten  years, they are supposed to be set at liberty.  But during this  period, their owners allow the greater number to die--of course, in  the returns only--and the poor slaves remain slaves still; but I  repeat that I only know this from hearsay.    After all, slaves are far from being as badly off as many Europeans  imagine.  In the Brazils they are generally pretty well treated;  they are not overworked, their food is good and nutritious, and the  punishments are neither particularly frequent nor heavy.  The crime  of running away is the only one which is visited with great rigour.  Besides a severe beating, they have fetters placed round their neck  and feet; these they have to wear for a considerable period.  Another manner of punishment consists in making them wear a tin  mask, which is fastened with a lock behind.  This is the mode of  punishment adopted for those who drink, or are in the habit of  eating earth or lime.  During my long stay in the Brazils, I only  saw one negro who had got on a mask of this description.  I very  much doubt whether, on the whole, the lot of these slaves is not  less wretched than that of the peasants of Russia, Poland, or Egypt,  who are _not_ called slaves.    I was one day very much amused at being asked to stand godmother to  a negro, which I did, although I was not present at either baptism  or confirmation.  There is a certain custom here, that when a slave  has done anything for which he expects to be punished, he endeavours  to fly to some friend of his owner, and obtain a note, asking for  the remission of his punishment.  The writer of such a letter has  the title of godfather bestowed on him, and it would be accounted an  act of the greatest impoliteness not to grant the godfather's  request.  In this way, I myself was fortunate enough to save a slave  from punishment.      The town is tolerably well lighted, and the lighting is continued to  a considerable distance, on all sides, beyond the town itself; this  measure was introduced on account of the great number of blacks.  No  slave dare be seen in the streets later than 9 o'clock in the  evening, without having a pass from his master, certifying that he  is going on business for him.  If a slave is ever caught without a  pass, he is immediately conveyed to the House of Correction, where  his head is shaved, and he himself obliged to remain until his  master buys his freedom for four or five milreis.  (8s. 8d., or 10s.  10d.)  In consequence of this regulation, the streets may be  traversed with safety at any hour of the night.    One of the most disagreeable things in Rio Janeiro is the total  absence of sewers.  In a heavy shower, every street becomes a  regular stream, which it is impossible to pass on foot; in order to  traverse them, it is requisite to be carried over by negroes.  At  such times, all intercourse generally ceases, the streets are  deserted, parties are put off, and even the payment of bills of  exchange deferred.  It is very seldom that people will hire a  carriage, for it is an absurd custom here, to pay as much for a  short drive, as if the carriage were required for the whole day; in  both cases the charge is six milreis (13s.)  The carriages are half-  covered ones, with seats for two, and are drawn by a pair of mules,  on one of which the driver rides.  Carriages and horses like the  English are very seldom to be met with.    As regards the arts and sciences, I may mention the Academy of Fine  Arts, the Museum, Theatre, etc.  In the Academy of Fine Arts is  something of everything, and not much of anything--a few figures and  busts, most in plaster, a few architectural plans and pencil  drawings, and a collection of very old oil paintings.  It really  seemed to me as if some private picture gallery had been carefully  weeded of all the rubbish in it, which had then been put here out of  the way.  Most of the oil paintings are so injured, that it is  scarcely possible to make out what they are intended to represent,  which, after all, is no great loss.  The only thing respectable  about them is their venerable antiquity.  A startling contrast is  produced by the copies of them made by the students.  If the colours  in the old pictures are faded, in the modern ones they blaze with a  superfluity of vividness; red, yellow, green, etc., are there in all  their force; such a thing as mixing, softening, or blending them,  has evidently never been thought of.  Even at the present moment, I  really am at a loss to determine whether the worthy students  intended to found a new school for colouring, or whether they merely  desired to make up in the copies for the damage time had done the  originals.    There were as many blacks and mulattoes among the students as  whites, but the number of them altogether was inconsiderable.    Music, especially singing and the pianoforte, is almost in a more  degraded position than painting.  In every family the young ladies  play and sing; but of tact, style, arrangement, time, etc., the  innocent creatures have not the remotest idea, so that the easiest  and most taking melodies are often not recognisable.  The sacred  music is a shade better, although even the arrangements of the  Imperial Chapel itself are susceptible of many improvements.  The  military bands are certainly the best, and these are generally  composed of negroes and mulattoes.    The exterior of the Opera-house does not promise anything very  beautiful or astonishing, and the stranger is, consequently, much  surprised to find, on entering, a large and magnificent house with a  deep stage.  I should say it could contain more than 2,000 persons.  There are four tiers of spacious boxes rising one above the other,  the balustrades of which, formed of delicately-wrought iron trellis-  work, give the theatre a very tasty appearance.  The pit is only for  men.  I was present at a tolerably good representation, by an  Italian company, of the opera of Lucrezia Borgia; the scenery and  costumes are not amiss.    If, however, I was agreeably surprised by my visit to the theatre, I  experienced quite a contrary feeling on going to the Museum.  In a  land so richly and luxuriously endowed by Nature, I expected an  equally rich and magnificent museum, and found a number of very fine  rooms, it is true, which one day or other may be filled, but which  at present are empty.  The collection of birds, which is the most  complete of all, is really fine; that of the minerals is very  defective; and those of the quadrupeds and insects poor in the  extreme.  The objects which most excited my curiosity, were the  heads of four savages, in excellent preservation; two of them  belonged to the Malay, and two to the New Zealand tribes.  The  latter especially I could not sufficiently contemplate, completely  covered as they were with tattooing of the most beautiful and  elegant design, and so well preserved that they seemed only to have  just ceased to live.    During the period of my stay in Rio Janeiro, the rooms of the Museum  were undergoing repairs, and a new classification of the different  objects was also talked of.  In consequence of this, the building  was not open to the public, and I have to thank the kindness of Herr  Riedl, the director, for allowing me to view it.  He acted himself  as my guide; and, like me, regretted that in a country where the  formation of a rich museum would be so easy a task, so little had  been done.    I likewise visited the studio of the sculptor Petrich, a native of  Dresden, who came over at the unsolicited command of the court, to  execute a statue of the emperor in Carrara marble.  The emperor is  represented the size of life, in a standing position, and arrayed in  his imperial robes, with the ermine cloak thrown over his shoulder.  The head is strikingly like, and the whole figure worked out of the  stone with great artistic skill.  I believe this statue was destined  for some public building.      I was fortunate enough during my stay in Rio Janeiro to witness  several different public festivals.    The first was on the 21st of September, in the Church of St."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11074"],[0,"The Damned (#7)"],[1,"my hands. I might even help to  dissipate the Shadow, \"to get it straight again.\" It seemed, perhaps,  our long invitation was explained!    I went into the house laughing--at myself a little. \"Perhaps after all  the artist's outlook, with no hard and fast dogmas, is as narrow as the  others! How small humanity is! And why is there no possible and true  combination of all outlooks?\"    The feeling of \"unsettling\" was very strong in me just then, in spite of  my big discovery which was to clear everything up. And at the moment I  ran into Frances on the stairs, with a portfolio of sketches under her  arm.    It came across me then abruptly that, although she had worked a great  deal since we came, she had shown me nothing. It struck me suddenly as  odd, unnatural. The way she tried to pass me now confirmed my newborn  suspicion that--well, that her results were hardly what they ought to  be.    \"Stand and deliver!\" I laughed, stepping in front of her. \"I've seen  nothing you've done since you've been here, and as a rule you show me  all your things. I believe they are atrocious and degrading!\" Then my  laughter froze.    She made a sly gesture to slip past me, and I almost decided to let her  go, for the expression that flashed across her face shocked me. She  looked uncomfortable and ashamed; the color came and went a moment in he  cheeks, making me think of a child detected in some secret naughtiness.  It was almost fear.    \"It's because they're not finished then?\" I said, dropping the tone of  banter, \"or because they're too good for me to understand?\" For my  criticism of painting, she told me, was crude and ignorant sometimes.  \"But you'll let me see them later, won't you?\"    Frances, however, did not take the way of escape I offered. She changed  her mind. She drew the portfolio from beneath her arm instead. \"You can  see them if you really want to, Bill,\" she said quietly, and her tone  reminded me of a nurse who says to a boy just grown out of childhood,  \"you are old enough now to look upon horror and ugliness--only I don't  advise it.\"    \"I do want to,\" I said, and made to go downstairs with her. But,  instead, she said in the same low voice as before, \"Come up to my room,  we shall be undisturbed there.\" So I guessed that she had been on her  way to show the paintings to our hostess, but did not care for us all  three to see them together. My mind worked furiously.    \"Mabel asked me to do them,\" she explained in a tone of submissive  horror, once the door was shut, \"in fact, she begged it of me. You know  how persistent she is in her quiet way. I--er--had to.\"    She flushed and opened the portfolio on the little table by the window,  standing behind me as I turned the sketches over--sketches of the  grounds and trees and garden. In the first moment of inspection,  however, I did not take in clearly why my sister's sense of modesty had  been offended. For my attention flashed a second elsewhere. Another bit  of the puzzle had dropped into place, defining still further the nature  of what I called \"the Shadow.\" Mrs. Franklyn, I now remembered, had  suggested to me in the library that I might perhaps write something  about the place, and I had taken it for one of her banal sentences and  paid no further attention. I realized now that it was said in earnest.  She wanted our interpretations, as expressed in our respective  \"talents,\" painting and writing. Her invitation was explained. She left  us to ourselves on purpose.    \"I should like to tear them up,\" Frances was whispering behind me with a  shudder, \"only I promised--\" She hesitated a moment.    \"Promised not to?\" I asked with a queer feeling of distress, my eyes  glued to the papers.    \"Promised always to show them to her first,\" she finished so low I  barely caught it.    I have no intuitive, immediate grasp of the value of paintings; results  come to me slowly, and though every one believes his own judgment to be  good, I dare not claim that mine is worth more than that of any other  layman, Frances had too often convicted me of gross ignorance and error.  I can only say that I examined these sketches with a feeling of  amazement that contained revulsion, if not actually horror and disgust.  They were outrageous. I felt hot for my sister, and it was a relief to  know she had moved across the room on some pretence or other, and did  not examine them with me. Her talent, of course, is mediocre, yet she  has her moments of inspiration--moments, that is to say, when a view of  Beauty not normally her own flames divinely through her. And these  interpretations struck me forcibly as being thus \"inspired\"--not her  own. They were uncommonly well done; they were also atrocious. The  meaning in them, however, was never more than hinted. There the unholy  skill and power came in: they suggested so abominably, leaving most to  the imagination. To find such significance in a bourgeois villa garden,  and to interpret it with such delicate yet legible certainty, was a kind  of symbolism that was sinister, even diabolical. The delicacy was her  own, but the point of view was another's.    And the word that rose in my mind was not the gross description of  \"impure,\" but the more fundamental qualification--\"un-pure.\"    In silence I turned the sketches over one by one, as a boy hurries  through the pages of an evil book lest he be caught.    \"What does Mabel do with them?\" I asked presently in a low tone, as I  neared the end. \"Does she keep them?\"    \"She makes notes about them in a book and then destroys them,\" was the  reply from the end of the room. I heard a sigh of relief. \"I'm glad  you've seen them, Bill. I wanted you to--but was afraid to show them.  You understand?\"    \"I understand,\" was my reply, though it was not a question intended to  be answered. All I understood really was that Mabel's mind was as sweet  and pure as my sister's, and that she had some good reason for what she  did. She destroyed the sketches, but first made notes! It was an  interpretation of the place she sought. Brother-like, I felt resentment,  though, that Frances should waste her time and talent, when she might be  doing work that she could sell. Naturally, I felt other things as  well....    \"Mabel pays me five guineas for each one,\" I heard. \"Absolutely  insists.\"    I stared at her stupidly a moment, bereft of speech or wit. \"I must  either accept, or go away,\" she went on calmly, but a little white.  \"I've tried everything. There was a scene the third day I was here--when  I showed her my first result. I wanted to write to you, but hesitated--\"    \"It's unintentional, then, on your part--forgive my asking it, Frances,  dear?\" I blundered, hardly knowing what to think or say. \"Between the  lines\" of her letter came back to me. \"I mean, you make the sketches in  your ordinary way and--the result comes out of itself, so to speak?\"    She nodded, throwing her hands out like a Frenchman. \"We needn't keep  the money for ourselves, Bill. We can give it away, but--I must either  accept or leave,\" and she repeated the shrugging gesture. She sat down  on the chair facing me, staring helplessly at the carpet.    \"You say there was a scene?\" I went on presently, \"She insisted?\"    \"She begged me to continue,\" my sister replied very quietly. \"She  thinks--that is, she has an idea or theory that there's something about  the place--something she can't get at quite.\" Frances stammered badly.  She knew I did not encourage her wild theories.    \"Something she feels--yes,\" I helped her, more than curious.    \"Oh, you know what I mean, Bill,\" she said desperately. \"That the place  is saturated with some influence that she is herself too positive or too  stupid to interpret. She's trying to make herself negative and  receptive, as she calls it, but can't, of course, succeed. Haven't you  noticed how dull and impersonal and insipid she seems, as though she had  no personality? She thinks impressions will come to her that way. But  they don't--\"    \"Naturally.\"    \"So she's trying me--us--what she calls the sensitive and impressionable  artistic temperament. She says that until she is sure exactly what this  influence is, she can't fight it, turn it out, 'get the house straight',  as she phrases it.\"    Remembering my own singular impressions, I felt more lenient than I  might otherwise have done. I tried to keep impatience out of my voice.    \"And this influence, what--whose is it?\"    We used the pronoun that followed in the same breath, for I answered my  own question at the same moment as she did:    \"His.\" Our heads nodded involuntarily towards the floor, the dining room  being directly underneath.    And my heart sank, my curiosity died away on the instant; I felt bored.  A commonplace haunted house was the last thing in the world to amuse or  interest me. The mere thought exasperated, with its suggestions of  imagination, overwrought nerves, hysteria, and the rest.    Mingled with my other feelings was certainly disappointment. To see a  figure or feel a \"presence,\" and report from day to day strange  incidents to each other would be a form of weariness I could never  tolerate.    \"But really, Frances,\" I said firmly, after a moment's pause, \"it's too  far-fetched, this explanation. A curse, you know, belongs to the ghost  stories of early Victorian days.\" And only my positive conviction that  there was something after all worth discovering, and that it most  certainly was not this, prevented my suggesting that we terminate our  visit forthwith, or as soon as we decently could. \"This is not a haunted  house, whatever it is,\" I concluded somewhat vehemently, bringing my  hand down upon her odious portfolio.    My sister's reply revived my curiosity sharply.    \"I was waiting for you to say that. Mabel says exactly the same. He is  in it--but it's something more than that alone, something far bigger and  more complicated.\" Her sentence seemed to indicate the sketches, and"]]]
