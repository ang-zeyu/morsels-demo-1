And thus began the Second History of this world. And how  shall I set it all down in these little pages! For my task, even as I  see it, is too great for the power of a single life and a single pen.  Yet, to it!    And, later, through hundreds and thousands of years, there grew up in  the Outer Lands, beyond those which lay under the guard of the Redoubt,  mighty and lost races of terrible creatures, half men and half beast,  and evil and dreadful; and these made war upon the Redoubt; but were  beaten off from that grim, metal mountain, with a vast slaughter. Yet,  must there have been many such attacks, until the electric circle was  put about the Pyramid, and lit from the Earth-Current. And the lowest  half-mile of the Pyramid was sealed; and so at last there was a peace,  and the beginnings of that Eternity of quiet watching for the day when  the Earth-Current shall become exhausted.    And, at whiles, through the forgotten centuries, had the Creatures been  glutted time and again upon such odd bands of daring ones as had  adventured forth to explore through the mystery of the Night Lands; for  of those who went, scarce any did ever return; for there were eyes in  all that dark; and Powers and Forces abroad which had all knowledge; or  so we must fain believe.    And then, so it would seem, as that Eternal Night lengthened itself upon  the world, the power of terror grew and strengthened. And fresh and  greater monsters developed and bred out of all space and Outward  Dimensions, attracted, even as it might be Infernal sharks, by that  lonely and mighty hill of humanity, facing its end--so near to the  Eternal, and yet so far deferred in the minds and to the senses of those  humans. And thus hath it been ever.    And all this but by the way, and vague and ill told, and set out in  despair to make a little clear the beginnings of that State which is so  strange to our conceptions, and yet which had become a Condition of  Naturalness to Humanity in that stupendous future.    Thus had the giants come, fathered of bestial humans and mothered of  monsters. And many and diverse were the creatures which had some human  semblance; and intelligence, mechanical and cunning; so that certain of  these lesser Brutes had machinery and underground ways, having need to  secure to themselves warmth and air, even as healthy humans; only that  they were incredibly inured to hardship, as they might be wolves set in  comparison with tender children. And surely, do I make this thing clear?    And now to continue my telling concerning the Night Land. The Watcher of  the South was, as I have set to make known, a monster differing from  those other Watching Things, of which I have spoken, and of which there  were in all four. One to the North-West, and one to the South-East, and  of these I have told; and the other twain lay brooding, one to the  South-West, and the other to the North-East; and thus the four watchers  kept ward through the darkness, upon the Pyramid, and moved not, neither  gave they out any sound. Yet did we know them to be mountains of living  watchfulness and hideous and steadfast intelligence.    And so, in a while, having listened to the sorrowful sound which came  ever to us over the Grey Dunes, from the Country of Wailing, which lay  to the South, midway between the Redoubt and the Watcher of the South, I  passed upon one of the moving roadways over to the South-Western side of  the Pyramid, and looked from a narrow embrasure thence far down into the  Deep Valley, which was four miles deep, and in which was the Pit of the  Red Smoke.    And the mouth of this Pit was one full mile across, and the smoke of the  Pit filled the Valley at times, so that it seemed but as a glowing red  circle amid dull thunderous clouds of redness. Yet the red smoke rose  never much above the Valley; so that there was clear sight across to the  country beyond. And there, along the further edge of that great depth,  were the Towers, each, maybe, a mile high, grey and quiet; but with a  shimmer upon them.    Beyond these, South and West of them, was the enormous bulk of the  South-West Watcher, and from the ground rose what we named the Eye  Beam--a single ray of grey light, which came up out of the ground, and  lit the right eye of the monster. And because of this light, that eye  had been mightily examined through unknown thousands of years; and some  held that the eye looked through the light steadfastly at the Pyramid;  but others set out that the light blinded it, and was the work of those  Other Powers which were abroad to do combat with the Evil Forces. But  however this may be, as I stood there in the embrasure, and looked at  the thing through the spy-glass, it seemed to my soul that the Brute  looked straightly at me, unwinking and steadfast, and fully of a  knowledge that I spied upon it. And this is how I felt.    To the North of this, in the direction of the West, I saw The Place  Where The Silent Ones Kill; and this was so named, because there, maybe  ten thousand years gone, certain humans adventuring from the Pyramid,  came off the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, and into that place, and  were immediately destroyed. And this was told by one who escaped; though  he died also very quickly, for his heart was frozen. And this I cannot  explain; but so it was set out in the Records.    Far away beyond The Place Where The Silent Ones Kill, in the very mouth  of the Western Night was the Place of the Ab-humans, where was lost the  Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, in a dull green, luminous mist. And of  this place nothing was known; though much it held the thoughts and  attentions of our thinkers and imaginers; for some said that there was a  Place Of Safety, differing from the Redoubt (as we of this day suppose  Heaven to differ from the Earth), and that the Road led thence; but was  barred by the Ab-humans. And this I can only set down here; but with no  thought to justify or uphold it.    Later, I travelled over to the North-Eastern wall of the Redoubt, and  looked thence with my spy-glass at the Watcher of the North-East--the  Crowned Watcher it was called, in that within the air above its vast  head there hung always a blue, luminous ring, which shed a strange light  downwards over the monster--showing a vast, wrinkled brow (upon which an  whole library had been writ); but putting to the shadow all the lower  face; all save the ear, which came out from the back of the head, and  belled towards the Redoubt, and had been said by some observers in the  past to have been seen to quiver; but how that might be, I knew not; for  no man of our days had seen such a thing.    And beyond the Watching Thing was The Place Where The Silent Ones Are  Never, close by the great road; which was bounded upon the far side by  The Giant's Sea; and upon the far side of that, was a Road which was  always named The Road By The Quiet City; for it passed along that place  where burned forever the constant and never-moving lights of a strange  city; but no glass had ever shown life there; neither had any light ever  ceased to burn.    And beyond that again was the Black Mist. And here, let me say, that the  Valley of The Hounds ended towards the Lights of the Quiet City.    And so have I set out something of that land, and of those creatures and  circumstances which beset us about, waiting until the Day of Doom, when  our Earth-Current should cease, and leave us helpless to the Watchers  and the Abundant Terror.    And there I stood, and looked forth composedly, as may one who has been  born to know of such matters, and reared in the knowledge of them. And,  anon, I would look upward, and see the grey, metalled mountain going up  measureless into the gloom of the everlasting night; and from my feet  the sheer downward sweep of the grim, metal walls, six full miles, and  more, to the plain below.    And one thing (aye! and I fear me, many) have I missed to set out with  particularness:    There was, as you do know, all around the base of the Pyramid, which was  five and one-quarter miles every way, a great circle of light, which was  set up by the Earth-Current, and burned within a transparent tube; or  had that appearance. And it bounded the Pyramid for a clear mile upon  every side, and burned for ever; and none of the monsters had power ever  to pass across, because of what we did call The Air Clog that it did  make, as an invisible Wall of Safety. And it did give out also a more  subtile vibration, that did affect the weak Brain-Elements of the  monsters and the Lower Men-Brutes. And some did hold that there went  from it a further vibration of a greater subtileness that gave a  protecting against the Evil Forces. And some quality it had truly  thiswise; for the Evil Powers had no ability to cause harm to any  within. Yet were there some dangers against which it might not avail;  but these had no cunning to bring harm to any _within_ the Great Redoubt  who had wisdom to meddle with no dreadfulness. And so were those last  millions guarded until the Earth-Current should be used to its end. And  this circle is that which I have called the Electric Circle; though with  failure to explain. But there it was called only, The Circle.    And thus have I, with great effort, made a little clear that grim land  of night, where, presently, my listening heard one calling across the  dark. And how that this grew upon me, I will set out forthwith.          III    THE QUIET CALLING      Now, oft had I heard tell, not only in that great city which occupied  the thousandth floor, but in others of the one thousand, three hundred  and twenty cities of the Pyramid, that there was somewhere out in the  desolation of the Night Lands a second Place of Refuge, where had  gathered, in another part of this dead world, some last millions of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10671"],[0,"The Botanic Garden.

This curious stem is sometimes pushed out of the ground in its horizontal  situation by some of the inferior branches of the root, so as to give it  some resemblance to a Lamb standing on four legs; and has been said to  destroy all other plants in its vicinity. Sir Hans Sloane describes it  under the name of Tartarian Lamb, and has given a print of it. Philos.  Trans. abridged, v. II. p. 646. but thinks some art had been used to  give it an animal appearance. Dr. Hunter, in his edition of the Terra of  Evelyn, has given a more curious print of it, much resembling a sheep.  The down is used in India externally for stopping hemorrhages, and is  called golden moss.    The thick downy clothing of some vegetables seems designed to protect  them from the injuries of cold, like the wool of animals. Those bodies,  which are bad conductors of electricity, are also bad conductors of heat,  as glass, wax, air. Hence either of the two former of these may be melted  by the flame of a blow-pipe very near the fingers which hold it without  burning them; and the last, by being confined on the surface of animal  bodies, in the interstices of their fur or wool, prevents the escape of  their natural warmth; to which should be added, that the hairs themselves  are imperfect conductors. The fat or oil of whales, and other northern  animals, seems designed for the same purpose of preventing the too sudden  escape of the heat of the body in cold climates. Snow protects vegetables  which are covered by it from cold, both because it is a bad conductor of  heat itself, and contains much air in its pores. If a piece of camphor be  immersed in a snow-ball, except one extremity of it, on setting fire to  this, as the snow melts, the water becomes absorbed into the surrounding  snow by capillary attraction; on this account, when living animals are  buried in snow, they are not moistened by it; but the cavity enlarges as  the snow dissolves, affording them both a dry and warm habitation.]               --So, warm and buoyant in his oily mail,          Gambols on seas of ice the unwieldy Whale;          Wide-waving fins round floating islands urge          His bulk gigantic through the troubled surge;  295  With hideous yawn the flying shoals He seeks,          Or clasps with fringe of horn his massy cheeks;          Lifts o'er the tossing wave his nostrils bare,          And spouts pellucid columns into air;          The silvery arches catch the setting beams,  300  And transient rainbows tremble o'er the streams.            Weak with nice sense, the chaste MIMOSA stands,          From each rude touch withdraws her timid hands;          Oft as light clouds o'er-pass the Summer-glade,          Alarm'd she trembles at the moving shade;  305  And feels, alive through all her tender form,          The whisper'd murmurs of the gathering storm;          Shuts her sweet eye-lids to approaching night;          And hails with freshen'd charms the rising light.      [_Mimosa_. I. 301. The sensitive plant. Of the class Polygamy, one house.  Naturalists have not explained the immediate cause of the collapsing of  the sensitive plant; the leaves meet and close in the night during the  sleep of the plant, or when exposed to much cold in the day-time, in the  same manner as when they are affected by external violence, folding their  upper surfaces together, and in part over each other like scales or  tiles; so as to expose as little of the upper surface as may be to the  air; but do not indeed collapse quite so far, since I have found, when  touched in the night during their sleep, they fall still further;  especially when touched on the foot-stalks between the stems and the  leaflets, which seems to be their most sensitive or irritable part. Now  as their situation after being exposed to external violence resembles  their sleep, but with a greater degree of collapse, may it not be owing  to a numbness or paralysis consequent to too violent irritation, like the  faintings of animals from pain or fatigue? I kept a sensitive plant in  a dark room till some hours after day-break: its leaves and leaf-stalks  were collapsed as in its most profound sleep, and on exposing it to the  light, above twenty minutes passed before the plant was thoroughly awake  and had quite expanded itself. During the night the upper or smoother  surfaces of the leaves are appressed together; this would seem to shew  that the office of this surface of the leaf was to expose the fluids of  the plant to the light as well as to the air.

Many males, many females. Pliny says this flower  never opens its petals but when the wind blows; whence its name: it has  properly no calix, but two or three sets of petals, three in each set,  which are folded over the stamens and pistil in a singular and beautiful  manner, and differs also from ranunculus in not having a melliferous pore  on the claw of each petal. ]    [_The Swallow_. l. 322. There is a wonderful conformity between the  vegetation of some plants, and the arrival of certain birds of passage.  Linneus observes that the wood anemone blows in Sweden on the arrival  of the swallow; and the marsh mary-gold, Caltha, when the cuckoo sings.  Near the same coincidence was observed in England by Stillingfleet. The  word Coccux in Greek signifies both a young fig and a cuckoo, which is  supposed to have arisen from the coincidence of their appearance in Greece.  Perhaps a similar coincidence of appearance in some parts of Asia gave  occasion to the story of the loves of the rose and nightingale, so much  celebrated by the eastern poets. See Dianthus. The times however of the  appearance of vegetables in the spring seem occasionally to be influenced  by their acquired habits, as well as by their sensibility to heat: for the  roots of potatoes, onions, &c. will germinate with much less heat in the  spring than in the autumn; as is easily observable where these roots are  stored for use; and hence malt is best made in the spring. 2d. The grains  and roots brought from more southern latitudes germinate here sooner than  those which are brought from more northern ones, owing to their acquired  habits. Fordyce on Agriculture. 3d. It was observed by one of the scholars  of Linneus, that the apple-trees sent from hence to New England blossomed  for a few years too early for that climate, and bore no fruit; but  afterwards learnt to accommodate themselves to their new situation.  (Kalm's Travels.) 4th. The parts of animals become more sensible to heat  after having been previously exposed to  cold, as our hands glow on coming  into the house after having held snow in them; this seems to happen to  vegetables; for vines in grape-houses, which have been exposed to the  winter's cold, will become forwarder and more vigorous than those which  have been kept during the winter in the house. (Kenedy on Gardening.) This  accounts for the very rapid vegetation in the northern latitudes after the  solution of the snows.    The increase of the irritability of plants in respect to heat, after  having been previously exposed to cold, is further illustrated by an  experiment of Dr. Walker's. He"]]]
