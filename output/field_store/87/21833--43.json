The historical synthesis reduces itself, then, to uncovering the  psychologic processes of national development. The object before us to  be studied is the national spirit undergoing continuous evolution  during thousands of years. Our task is to arrive at the laws  underlying this growth. We shall reach our goal by imitating the  procedure of the geologist, who divides the mass of the earth into its  several strata or formations. In Jewish history there may be  distinguished three chief stratifications answering to its first three  periods, the Biblical period, the period of the Second Temple, and the  Talmudic period. The later periods are nothing more than these same  formations combined in various ways, with now and then the addition of  new strata. Of the composite periods there are four, which arrange  themselves either according to hegemonies, the countries in which at  given times lay the centre of gravity of the scattered Jewish people,  or according to the intellectual currents there predominant.    This, then, is our scheme:      I. The chief formations:      a) The primary or Biblical period.      b) The secondary or spiritual-political period        (the period of the Second Temple, 538        B. C. E. to 70 C.E.)      c) The tertiary or national-religious period        (the Talmudic period, 70-500).      II. The composite formations:      a) The Gaonic period, or the hegemony of        the Oriental Jews (500-980).      b) The Rabbinic-philosophical period, or the        hegemony of the Spanish Jews (980-1492).      c) The Rabbinic-mystical period, or the hegemony        of the German-Polish Jews        (1492-1789).      d) The modern period of enlightenment (the        nineteenth century).          V    THE PRIMARY OR BIBLICAL PERIOD      In the daybreak of history, the hoary days when seeming and reality  merge into each other, and the outlines of persons and things fade  into the surrounding mist, the picture of a nomad people, moving from  the deserts of Arabia in the direction of Mesopotamia and Western  Asia, detaches itself clear and distinct from the dim background. The  tiny tribe, a branch of the Semitic race, bears a peculiar stamp of  its own. A shepherd people, always living in close touch with nature,  it yet resists the potent influence of the natural phenomena, which,  as a rule, entrap primitive man, and make him the bond-slave of the  visible and material. Tent life has attuned these Semitic nomads to  contemplativeness. In the endless variety of the phenomena of nature,  they seek to discover a single guiding power. They entertain an  obscure presentiment of the existence of an invisible, universal soul  animating the visible, material universe. The intuition is personified  in the Patriarch Abraham, who, according to Biblical tradition, held  communion with God, when, on the open field, \"he looked up toward  heaven, and counted the stars,\" or when, \"at the setting of the sun,  he fell into benumbing sleep, and terror seized upon him by reason of  the impenetrable darkness.\" Here we have a clear expression of the  original, purely cosmical character of the Jewish religion.    There was no lack of human influence acting from without. Chaldea,  which the peculiar Semitic shepherds crossed in their pilgrimage,  presented them with notions from its rich mythology and cosmogony. The  natives of Syria and Canaan, among whom in the course of time the  Abrahamites settled, imparted to them many of their religious views  and customs. Nevertheless, the kernel of their pure original theory  remained intact. The patriarchal mode of life, admirable in its  simplicity, continued to hold its own within the circle of the  firmly-knitted tribe. It was in Canaan, however, that the shepherd  people hailing from Arabia showed the first signs of approaching  disintegration. Various tribal groups, like Moab and Ammon,  consolidated themselves. They took permanent foothold in the land, and  submitted with more or less readiness to the influences exerted by the  indigenous peoples. The guardianship of the sublime traditions of the  tribe remained with one group alone, the \"sons of Jacob\" or the \"sons  of Israel,\" so named from the third Patriarch Jacob. To this group of  the Israelites composed of smaller, closely united divisions, a  special mission was allotted; its development was destined to lie  along peculiar lines. The fortunes awaiting it were distinctive, and  for thousands of years have filled thinking and believing mankind with  wondering admiration.    Great characters are formed under the influence of powerful  impressions, of violent convulsions, and especially under the  influence of suffering. The Israelites early passed through their  school of suffering in Egypt. The removal of the sons of Jacob from  the banks of the Jordan to those of the Nile was of decisive  importance for the progress of their history. When the patriarchal  Israelitish shepherds encountered the old, highly complex culture of  the Egyptians, crystallized into fixed forms even at that early date,  it was like the clash between two opposing electric currents. The pure  conception of God, of _Elohim_, as of the spirit informing and  supporting the universe, collided with the blurred system of heathen  deities and crass idolatry. The simple cult of the shepherds,  consisting of a few severely plain ceremonies, transmitted from  generation to generation, was confronted with the insidious, coarsely  sensual animal worship of the Egyptians. The patriarchal customs of  the Israelites were brought into marked contrast with the vices of a  corrupt civilization. Sound in body and soul, the son of nature  suddenly found himself in unsavory surroundings fashioned by culture,  in which he was as much despised as the inoffensive nomad is by  \"civilized\" man of settled habit. The scorn had a practical result in  the enslavement of the Israelites by the Pharaohs. Association with  the Egyptians acted as a force at once of attraction and of repulsion.  The manners and customs of the natives could not fail to leave an  impression upon the simple aliens, and invite imitation on their part.  On the other hand, the whole life of the Egyptians, their crude  notions of religion, and their immoral ways, were calculated to  inspire the more enlightened among the Israelites with disgust. The  hostility of the Egyptians toward the \"intruders,\" and the horrible  persecutions in which it expressed itself, could not but bring out  more aggressively the old spiritual opposition between the two races.  The antagonism between them was the first influence to foster the germ  of Israel's national consciousness, the consciousness of his peculiar  character, his individuality. This early intimation of a national  consciousness was weak. It manifested itself only in the chosen few.  But it existed, and the time was appointed when, under more favorable  conditions, it would develop, and display the extent of its power.    This consciousness it was that inspired the activity of Moses,  Israel's teacher and liberator. He was penetrated alike by national  and religious feeling, and his desire was to impart both national and  religious feeling to his brethren. The fact of national redemption he  connected with the fact of religious revelation. \"I am the Lord thy  God who have brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt\" was  proclaimed from Sinai. The God-idea was nationalized. Thenceforth  \"Eternal\" became the name peculiar to the God of Israel. He was,  indeed, the same _Elohim_, the Creator of the world and its  Guide, who had been dimly discerned by the spiritual vision of the  Patriarchs. At the same time He was the special God of the Israelitish  nation, the only nation that avouched Him with a full and undivided  heart, the nation chosen by God Himself to carry out, alone, His  sublime plans.[9] In his wanderings, Israel became acquainted with the  chaotic religious systems of other nations. Seeing to what they paid  the tribute of divine adoration, he could not but be dominated by the  consciousness that he alone from of old had been the exponent of the  religious idea in its purity. The resolution must have ripened within  him to continue for all time to advocate and cherish this idea. From  that moment Israel was possessed of a clear theory of life in religion  and morality, and of a definite aim pursued with conscious intent.      [9] This is the true recondite meaning of the verses Exod. vi,      2-3: \"And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the      Eternal: and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto      Jacob, as _El-Shaddai_ (God Almighty), but by my name      Eternal I was not known unto them.\"    Its originators designed that this Israelitish conception of life  should serve not merely theoretically, as the basis of religious  doctrine, but also practically, as the starting point of legislation.  It was to be realized in the daily walks of the people, which at this  very time attained to political independence. Sublime religious  conceptions were not to be made the content of a visionary creed, the  subject of dreamy contemplation, but, in the form of perspicuous  guiding principles, were to control all spheres of individual and  social life. Men must beware of looking upon religion as an ideal to  be yearned for, it should be an ideal to be applied directly, day by  day, to practical contingencies. In \"Mosaism,\" so-called, the  religious and the ethical are intimately interwoven with the social  and the political. The chief dogmas of creed are stated as principles  shaping practical life. For instance, the exalted idea of One God  applied to social life produces the principle of the equality of all  men before the One Supreme Power, a principle on which the whole of  Biblical legislation is built.

Greater and greater grew his stature as he went  northwards and ever more kingly his mien. Now he took baronies at  a stride and now counties and came again to the snow-white frozen  lands where the wolves came out to meet him and, draping himself  anew with old grey clouds, strode through the gates of his invincible  home, two old ice barriers swinging on pillars of ice that had never  known the sun.    So the town was left to Spring. And she peered about to see  what she could do with it. Presently she saw a dejected dog coming  prowling down the road, so she sang to him and he gambolled. I saw  him next day strutting by with something of an air. Where there were  trees she went to them and whispered, and they sang the arboreal  song that only trees can hear, and the green buds came peeping out as  stars while yet it is twilight, secretly one by one. She went to gardens  and awaked from dreaming the warm maternal earth. In little patches  bare and desolate she called up like a flame the golden crocus, or its  purple brother like an emperor's ghost. She gladdened the graceless  backs of untidy houses, here with a weed, there with a little grass.  She said to the air, \"Be joyous.\"    Children began to know that daisies blew in unfrequented corners.  Buttonholes began to appear in the coats of the young men. The work  of Spring was accomplished.          HOW THE ENEMY CAME TO THLUNRANA      It had been prophesied of old and foreseen from the ancient days that  its enemy would come upon Thlunrana. And the date of its doom was  known and the gate by which it would enter, yet none had prophesied  of the enemy who he was save that he was of the gods though he dwelt  with men. Meanwhile Thlunrana, that secret lamaserai, that chief  cathedral of wizardry, was the terror of the valley in which it stood  and of all lands round about it. So narrow and high were the windows  and so strange when lighted at night that they seemed to regard men  with the demoniac leer of something that had a secret in the dark. Who  were the magicians and the deputy-magicians and the great arch-wizard  of that furtive place nobody knew, for they went veiled and hooded and  cloaked completely in black.    Though her doom was close upon her and the enemy of prophecy  should come that very night through the open, southward door that  was named the Gate of the Doom, yet that rocky edifice Thlunrana  remained mysterious still, venerable, terrible, dark, and dreadfully  crowned with her doom. It was not often that anyone dared wander  near to Thlunrana by night when the moan of the magicians invoking  we know not Whom rose faintly from inner chambers, scaring the  drifting bats: but on the last night of all the man from the black-thatched  cottage by the five pine-trees came, because he would see Thlunrana  once again before the enemy that was divine, but that dwelt with men,  should come against it and it should be no more. Up the dark valley he  went like a bold man, but his fears were thick upon him; his bravery  bore their weight but stooped a little beneath them. He went in at the  southward gate that is named the Gate of the Doom. He came into a  dark hall, and up a marble stairway passed to see the last of Thlunrana.  At the top a curtain of black velvet hung and he passed into a chamber  heavily hung with curtains, with a gloom in it that was blacker than  anything they could account for. In a sombre chamber beyond, seen  through a vacant archway, magicians with lighted tapers plied their  wizardry and whispered incantations. All the rats in the place were  passing away, going whimpering down the stairway. The man from  the black-thatched cottage passed through that second chamber: the  magicians did not look at him and did not cease to whisper. He passed  from them through heavy curtains still of black velvet and came into a  chamber of black marble where nothing stirred. Only one taper burned  in the third chamber; there were no windows. On the smooth floor and  under the smooth wall a silk pavilion stood with its curtains drawn close  together: this was the holy of holies of that ominous place, its inner  mystery. One on each side of it dark figures crouched, either of men  or women or cloaked stone, or of beasts trained to be silent. When  the awful stillness of the mystery was more than he could bear the  man from the black-thatched cottage by the five pine-trees went up  to the silk pavilion, and with a bold and nervous clutch of the hand  drew one of the curtains aside, and saw the inner mystery, and laughed.  And the prophecy was fulfilled, and Thlunrana was never more a terror  to the valley, but the magicians passed away from their terrific halls and  fled through the open fields wailing and beating their breasts, for  laughter was the enemy that was doomed to come against Thlunrana  through her southward gate (that was named the Gate of the Doom),  and it is of the gods but dwells with man.          A LOSING GAME      Once in a tavern Man met face to skull with Death. Man entered  gaily but Death gave no greeting, he sat with his jowl morosely over  an ominous wine.    \"Come, come,\" said Man, \"we have been antagonists long, and if I  were losing yet I should not be surly.\"    But Death remained unfriendly watching his bowl of wine and gave  no word in answer.    Then Man solicitously moved nearer to him and, speaking cheerily  still, \"Come, come,\" he said again, \"you must not resent defeat.\"    And still Death was gloomy and cross and sipped at his infamous  wine and would not look up at Man and would not be companionable.    But Man hated gloom either in beast or god, and it made him  unhappy to see his adversary's discomfort, all the more because he  was the cause, and still he tried to cheer him.    \"Have you not slain the Dinatherium?\" he said. \"Have you not put out  the Moon? Why! you will beat me yet.\"    And with a dry and barking sound Death wept and nothing said; and  presently Man arose and went wondering away; for he knew not if  Death wept out of pity for his opponent, or because he knew that he  should not have such sport again when the old game was over and  Man was gone, or whether because perhaps, for some hidden reason,  he could never repeat on Earth his triumph over the Moon.          TAKING UP PICADILLY      Going down Picadilly one day and nearing Grosvenor Place I saw,  if my memory is not at fault, some workmen with their coats off--or  so they seemed. They had pickaxes in their hands and wore corduroy  trousers and that little leather band below the knee that goes by the  astonishing name of \"York-to-London.\"    They seemed to be working with peculiar vehemence, so that I  stopped and asked one what they were doing.    \"We are taking up Picadilly,\" he said to me.    \"But at this time of year?\" I said. \"Is it usual in June?\"    \"We are not what we seem,\" said he.    \"Oh, I see,\" I said, \"you are doing it for a joke.\"    \"Well, not exactly that,\" he answered me.    \"For a bet?\" I said.    \"Not precisely,\" said he.    And then I looked at the bit that they had already picked, and  though it was broad daylight over my head it was darkness down  there, all full of the southern stars.    \"It was noisy and bad and we grew aweary of it,\" said he that wore  corduroy trousers. \"We are not what we appear.\"    They were taking up Picadilly altogether.          AFTER THE FIRE      When that happened which had been so long in happening and the  world hit a black, uncharted star, certain tremendous creatures out  of some other world came peering among the cinders to see if there  were anything there that it were worth while to remember. They  spoke of the great things that the world was known to have had;  they mentioned the mammoth. And presently they saw man's temples,  silent and windowless, staring like empty skulls.    \"Some great thing has been here,\" one said, \"in these huge places.\"  \"It was the mammoth,\" said one. \"Something greater than he,\" said  another.    And then they found that the greatest thing in the world had been  the dreams of man.          THE CITY      In time as well as space my fancy roams far from here. It led me  once to the edge of certain cliffs that were low and red and rose  up out of a desert: a little way off in the desert there was a city. It  was evening, and I sat and watched the city.    Presently I saw men by threes and fours come softly stealing out  of that city's gate to the number of about twenty. I heard the hum  of men's voices speaking at evening.    \"It is well they are gone,\" they said. \"It is well they are gone. We  can do business now. It is well they are gone.\" And the men that  had left the city sped away over the sand and so passed into the  twilight.    \"Who are these men?\" I said to my glittering leader.    \"The poets,\" my fancy answered. \"The poets and artists.\"    \"Why do they steal away?\" I said to him. \"And why are the people  glad that they have gone?\"    He said: \"It must be some doom that is going to fall on the city,  something has warned them and they have stolen away. Nothing  may warn the people.\"    I heard the wrangling voices, glad with commerce, rise up from  the city. And then I also departed, for there was an ominous look  on the face of the sky.    And only a thousand years later I passed that way, and there was  nothing, even among the weeds, of what had been that city.          THE FOOD OF DEATH      Death was sick. But they brought him bread that the modern bakers  make, whitened with alum, and the tinned meats of Chicago, with a  pinch of our modern substitute for salt. They carried him into the  dining-room of a great hotel (in that close atmosphere Death breathed  more freely), and there they gave him their cheap Indian tea. They  brought him a bottle of wine that they called champagne. Death  drank it up. They brought a"]]]
