The left-hand scene presented the view of a very fine park, composed  of very unequal ground, and agreeably varied with all the diversity  that hills, lawns, wood, and water, laid out with admirable taste, but  owing less to art than to nature, could give. Beyond this, the country  gradually rose into a ridge of wild mountains, the tops of which were  above the clouds.    It was now the middle of May, and the morning was remarkably serene,  when Mr Allworthy walked forth on the terrace, where the dawn opened  every minute that lovely prospect we have before described to his eye;  and now having sent forth streams of light, which ascended the blue  firmament before him, as harbingers preceding his pomp, in the full  blaze of his majesty rose the sun, than which one object alone in this  lower creation could be more glorious, and that Mr Allworthy himself  presented--a human being replete with benevolence, meditating in what  manner he might render himself most acceptable to his Creator, by  doing most good to his creatures.    Reader, take care. I have unadvisedly led thee to the top of as high a  hill as Mr Allworthy's, and how to get thee down without breaking thy  neck, I do not well know. However, let us e'en venture to slide down  together; for Miss Bridget rings her bell, and Mr Allworthy is  summoned to breakfast, where I must attend, and, if you please, shall  be glad of your company.    The usual compliments having past between Mr Allworthy and Miss  Bridget, and the tea being poured out, he summoned Mrs Wilkins, and  told his sister he had a present for her, for which she thanked  him--imagining, I suppose, it had been a gown, or some ornament for  her person. Indeed, he very often made her such presents; and she, in  complacence to him, spent much time in adorning herself. I say in  complacence to him, because she always exprest the greatest contempt  for dress, and for those ladies who made it their study.    But if such was her expectation, how was she disappointed when Mrs  Wilkins, according to the order she had received from her master,  produced the little infant? Great surprizes, as hath been observed,  are apt to be silent; and so was Miss Bridget, till her brother began,  and told her the whole story, which, as the reader knows it already,  we shall not repeat.    Miss Bridget had always exprest so great a regard for what the ladies  are pleased to call virtue, and had herself maintained such a severity  of character, that it was expected, especially by Wilkins, that she  would have vented much bitterness on this occasion, and would have  voted for sending the child, as a kind of noxious animal, immediately  out of the house; but, on the contrary, she rather took the  good-natured side of the question, intimated some compassion for the  helpless little creature, and commended her brother's charity in what  he had done.    Perhaps the reader may account for this behaviour from her  condescension to Mr Allworthy, when we have informed him that the good  man had ended his narrative with owning a resolution to take care of  the child, and to breed him up as his own; for, to acknowledge the  truth, she was always ready to oblige her brother, and very seldom, if  ever, contradicted his sentiments. She would, indeed, sometimes make a  few observations, as that men were headstrong, and must have their own  way, and would wish she had been blest with an independent fortune;  but these were always vented in a low voice, and at the most amounted  only to what is called muttering.    However, what she withheld from the infant, she bestowed with the  utmost profuseness on the poor unknown mother, whom she called an  impudent slut, a wanton hussy, an audacious harlot, a wicked jade, a  vile strumpet, with every other appellation with which the tongue of  virtue never fails to lash those who bring a disgrace on the sex.    A consultation was now entered into how to proceed in order to  discover the mother. A scrutiny was first made into the characters of  the female servants of the house, who were all acquitted by Mrs  Wilkins, and with apparent merit; for she had collected them herself,  and perhaps it would be difficult to find such another set of  scarecrows.    The next step was to examine among the inhabitants of the parish; and  this was referred to Mrs Wilkins, who was to enquire with all  imaginable diligence, and to make her report in the afternoon.    Matters being thus settled, Mr Allworthy withdrew to his study, as was  his custom, and left the child to his sister, who, at his desire, had  undertaken the care of it.        Chapter v.    Containing a few common matters, with a very uncommon observation upon  them.      When her master was departed, Mrs Deborah stood silent, expecting her  cue from Miss Bridget; for as to what had past before her master, the  prudent housekeeper by no means relied upon it, as she had often known  the sentiments of the lady in her brother's absence to differ greatly  from those which she had expressed in his presence. Miss Bridget did  not, however, suffer her to continue long in this doubtful situation;  for having looked some time earnestly at the child, as it lay asleep  in the lap of Mrs Deborah, the good lady could not forbear giving it a  hearty kiss, at the same time declaring herself wonderfully pleased  with its beauty and innocence. Mrs Deborah no sooner observed this  than she fell to squeezing and kissing, with as great raptures as  sometimes inspire the sage dame of forty and five towards a youthful  and vigorous bridegroom, crying out, in a shrill voice, \"O, the dear  little creature!--The dear, sweet, pretty creature! Well, I vow it is  as fine a boy as ever was seen!\"    These exclamations continued till they were interrupted by the lady,  who now proceeded to execute the commission given her by her brother,  and gave orders for providing all necessaries for the child,  appointing a very good room in the house for his nursery. Her orders  were indeed so liberal, that, had it been a child of her own, she  could not have exceeded them; but, lest the virtuous reader may  condemn her for showing too great regard to a base-born infant, to  which all charity is condemned by law as irreligious, we think proper  to observe that she concluded the whole with saying, \"Since it was her  brother's whim to adopt the little brat, she supposed little master  must be treated with great tenderness. For her part, she could not  help thinking it was an encouragement to vice; but that she knew too  much of the obstinacy of mankind to oppose any of their ridiculous  humours.\"    With reflections of this nature she usually, as has been hinted,  accompanied every act of compliance with her brother's inclinations;  and surely nothing could more contribute to heighten the merit of this  compliance than a declaration that she knew, at the same time, the  folly and unreasonableness of those inclinations to which she  submitted. Tacit obedience implies no force upon the will, and  consequently may be easily, and without any pains, preserved; but when  a wife, a child, a relation, or a friend, performs what we desire,  with grumbling and reluctance, with expressions of dislike and  dissatisfaction, the manifest difficulty which they undergo must  greatly enhance the obligation.    As this is one of those deep observations which very few readers can  be supposed capable of making themselves, I have thought proper to  lend them my assistance; but this is a favour rarely to be expected in  the course of my work. Indeed, I shall seldom or never so indulge him,  unless in such instances as this, where nothing but the inspiration  with which we writers are gifted, can possibly enable any one to make  the discovery.        Chapter vi.    Mrs Deborah is introduced into the parish with a simile. A short  account of Jenny Jones, with the difficulties and discouragements  which may attend young women in the pursuit of learning.      Mrs Deborah, having disposed of the child according to the will of her  master, now prepared to visit those habitations which were supposed to  conceal its mother.    Not otherwise than when a kite, tremendous bird, is beheld by the  feathered generation soaring aloft, and hovering over their heads, the  amorous dove, and every innocent little bird, spread wide the alarm,  and fly trembling to their hiding-places. He proudly beats the air,  conscious of his dignity, and meditates intended mischief.    So when the approach of Mrs Deborah was proclaimed through the street,  all the inhabitants ran trembling into their houses, each matron  dreading lest the visit should fall to her lot. She with stately steps  proudly advances over the field: aloft she bears her towering head,  filled with conceit of her own pre-eminence, and schemes to effect her  intended discovery.    The sagacious reader will not from this simile imagine these poor  people had any apprehension of the design with which Mrs Wilkins was  now coming towards them; but as the great beauty of the simile may  possibly sleep these hundred years, till some future commentator shall  take this work in hand, I think proper to lend the reader a little  assistance in this place.    It is my intention, therefore, to signify, that, as it is the nature  of a kite to devour little birds, so is it the nature of such persons  as Mrs Wilkins to insult and tyrannize over little people. This being  indeed the means which they use to recompense to themselves their  extreme servility and condescension to their superiors; for nothing  can be more reasonable, than that slaves and flatterers should exact  the same taxes on all below them, which they themselves pay to all  above them.    Whenever Mrs Deborah had occasion to exert any extraordinary  condescension to Mrs Bridget, and by that means had a little soured  her natural disposition, it was usual with her to walk forth among  these people,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6603"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage : 600-1776 King Aethelbert - King George III (#6)"],[1,"made a mild  alcoholic astringent, which was probably used to clean cuts and  sooth abraisons.    In the peaceful latter part of the 600s, Theodore, who had been a  monk in Rome, was appointed archbishop and visited all the island  speaking about the right rule of life and ordaining bishops to  oversee the priests. Each kingdom was split up into dioceses each  with one bishop. Thereafter, bishops were selected by the king and  his witan, usually after consulting the clergy and even the people  of the diocese. The bishops came to be the most permanent element  of society. They had their sees in villages or rural monasteries.  The bishops came to have the same wergeld as an eorldorman:  1200s., which was the price of about 500 oxen. A priest had the  wergeld as a landholding farmer [thegn], or 300s. The bishops  spoke Latin, but the priests of the local parishes spoke English.  Theodore was the first archbishop whom all the English church  obeyed. He taught sacred and secular literature, the books of holy  writ, ecclesiastical poetry, astronomy, arithmetic, and sacred  music. Theodore discouraged slavery by denying Christian burial to  the kidnapper and forbidding the sale of children over the age of  seven. A slave became entitled to two loaves a day and to his  holydays. A slave was allowed to buy his or his children's  freedom. In 673, Theodore started annual national ecclesiastical  assemblies, for instance for the witnessing of important actions.  The bishops, some abbots, the king, and the eorldormen were  usually present. From them the people learned the benefit of  common national action. There were two archbishops: one of  Canterbury in the south and one of York in the north. They  governed the bishops and could meet with them to issue canons that  would be equally valid all over the land. A bishop's house  contained some clerks, priests, monks, and nun and was a retreat  for the weary missionary and a school for the young. The bishop  had a deacon who acted as a secretary and companion in travel, and  sometimes as an interpreter. Ink was made from the outer husks of  walnuts steeped in vinegar.    The learned ecclesiastical life flourished in monastic  communities, in which both monks and nuns lived. Hilda, a noble's  daughter, became the first nun in Northumbria and abbess of one of  its monasteries. There she taught justice, piety, chastity, peace,  and charity. Several monks taught there later became bishops.  Kings and princes often asked her advice. Many abbesses came to  run monastic communities; they were from royal families. Women,  especially from royal families, fled to monasteries to obtain  shelter from unwanted marriage or to avoid their husbands. Kings  and eorldormen retired to them.    Danish Vikings made several invasions in the 800s for which a  danegeld tax on land was assessed on everyone every ten to twenty  years. The amount was determined by the witan and was typically  2s. per hide of land. (A hide was probably the amount of land  which could support a family or household for a year or as much  land as could be tilled annually by a single plow.) It was stored  in a strong box under the King's bed. King Alfred the Great, who  had lived for awhile in Rome, unified the country to defeat the  invaders. He established fortifications called \"burhs\", usually on  hill tops or other strategic locations on the borders to control  the main road and river routes into his realm. The burhs were  seminal towns. They were typically walled enclosures with towers  and an outer ditch and mound, instead of the hedge or fence  enclosure of a tun. Inside were several wooden thatched huts and a  couple of churches, which were lit by earthen oil lamps. The  populace met at burh-gemots. The land area protected by each burh  became known as a \"shire\", which means a share of a larger whole.  The shire or local landowners were responsible for repairing the  burh fortifications. There were about thirty shires.    Alfred gathered together fighting men who were at his disposal,  which included eorldormen with their hearthbands (retinues of men  each of whom had chosen to swear to fight to the death for their  eorldorman, and some of whom were of high rank), the King's  thegns, shire thegns (local landholding farmers, who were required  to bring fighting equipment such as swords, helmets, chainmail,  and horses), and ordinary freemen, i.e. ceorls (who carried food,  dug fortifications, and sometimes fought). Since the King was  compelled to call out the whole population to arms, the  distinction between the king's thegns from other landholders  disappeared. Some great lords organized men under them, whom they  provisioned. These vassals took a personal oath to their lord \"on  condition that he keep me as I am willing to deserve, and fulfill  all that was agreed on when I became his man, and chose his will  as mine.\" Alfred had a small navy of longships with 60 oars to  fight the Viking longships.    Alfred divided his army into two parts so that one half of the men  were fighting while the other half was at home sowing and  harvesting for those fighting. Thus, any small-scale independent  farming was supplanted by the open-field system, cultivation of  common land, more large private estates headed by a lord, and a  more stratified society in which the king and important families  more powerful and the peasants more curtailed. The witan became  mere witnesses. Many free coerls of the older days became bonded.  The village community tended to become a large private estate  headed by a lord. But the lord does not have the power to encroach  upon the rights of common that exist within the community.    In 886, a treaty between Alfred and the Vikings divided the  country along the war front and made the wergeld of every free  farmer, whether English or Viking, 200s. Men of higher rank were  given a wergeld of 4 1/2 marks of pure gold. A mark was probably a  Viking denomination and a mark of gold was equal to nine marks of  silver in later times and probably in this time. The word \"earl\"  replaced the word \"eorldormen\" and the word \"thegn\" replaced the  word \"aetheling\" after the Danish settlement. The ironed pleats of  Viking clothing indicated a high status of the wearer. The Vikings  brought combs and the practice of regular hair-combing to England.    King Alfred gave land with jurisdictional powers within its  boundaries such as the following: \"This is the bequest which King  Alfred make unequivocally to Shaftesbury, to the praise of God and  St. Mary and all the saints of God, for the benefit of my soul,  namely a hundred hides as they stand with their produce and their  men, and my daughter AEthelgifu to the convent along with the  inheritance, since she took the veil on account of bad health; and  the jurisdiction to the convent, which I myself possessed, namely  obstruction and attacks on a man's house and breach of protection.  And the estates which I have granted to the foundation are 40  hides at Donhead and Compton, 20 hides at Handley and Gussage 10  hides at Tarrant, 15 hides at Iwerve and 15 hides at Fontmell.    The witnesses of this are Edward my son and Archbishop AEthelred  and Bishop Ealhferth and Bishop AEthelhead and Earl Wulfhere and  Earl Eadwulf and Earl Cuthred and Abbot Tunberht and Milred my  thegn and AEthelwulf and Osric and Brihtulf and Cyma. If anyone  alters this, he shall have the curse of God and St. Mary and all  the saints of God forever to all eternity. Amen.\"    Sons usually succeeded their fathers on the same land as shown by  this lifetime lease: \"Bishop Denewulf and the community at  Winchester lease to Alfred for his lifetime 40 hides of land at  Alresford, in accordance with the lease which Bishop Tunbriht had  granted to his parents and which had run out, on condition that he  renders every year at the autumnal equinox three pounds as rent,  and church dues, and the work connected with church dues; and when  the need arises, his men shall be ready both for harvesting and  hunting; and after his death the property shall pass undisputed to  St. Peter's.    These are the signatures of the councilors and of the members of  the community who gave their consent, namely ...\"    Alfred invented a graduated candle with spaces indicating one hour  of burning, which could be used as a clock. He used a ventilated  cow's horn to put around the top of the candle to prevent its  blowing out, and then devised a wooden lantern with a horn window.  He described the world as like a yolk in the middle of an egg  whose shell moves around it. This agreed with the position of  Ptolemy Claudius of Alexandria, who showed the curvature of the  earth from north to south by observing that the Polar Star was  higher in the north and lower in the south. That it was curved  from east to west followed from the observation that two clocks  placed one west and one east would record a different time for the  same eclipse of the moon.    Alfred wrote poems on the worthiness of wisdom and knowledge in  preference to material pleasures, pride, and fame, in dealing with  life's sorrow and strife. His observations on human nature and his  proverbs include:    1.  As one sows, so will he mow.  2.  Every man's doom [judgment] returns to his door.  3.  He who will not learn while young, will repent of it when old.  4.  Weal [prosperity] without wisdom is worthless.  5.  Though a man had 70 acres sown with red gold, and the gold grew      like grass, yet he is not a whit the worthier unless he gain      friends for himself.  6.  Gold is but a stone unless a wise man has it.  7.  It's hard to row against the sea flood; so it is against      misfortune.  8.  He who toils in his youth to win wealth, so that he may enjoy      ease in his old age, has well bestowed his toil.  9.  Many a man loses his soul through silver.  10. Wealth may pass away, but wisdom will remain, and no man may      perish who has it for "]]]
