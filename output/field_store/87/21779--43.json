'I cured him of slicing.'    'You did what?'    'He used to slice his approach shots. I cured him.'    'The thing begins to hang together. A certain plausibility creeps  into it. The late Nutcombe was crazy about golf. The governor used  to play with him now and then at Walton Heath. It was the only  thing Nutcombe seemed to live for. That being so, if you got rid  of his slice for him it seems to me, that you earned your money.  The only point that occurs to me is, how does it affect your  amateur status? It looks to me as if you were now a pro.'    'But, Jerry, it's absurd. All I did was to give him a tip or two.  We were the only men down there, as it was out of the season, and  that drew us together. And when I spotted this slice of his I just  gave him a bit of advice. I give you my word that was all. He  can't have left me a fortune on the strength of that!'    'You don't tell the story right, Bill. I can guess what really  happened--to wit, that you gave up all your time to helping the  old fellow improve his game, regardless of the fact that it  completely ruined your holiday.'    'Oh, no!'    'It's no use sitting there saying \"Oh, no!\" I can see you at it.  The fact is, you're such an infernally good chap that something of  this sort was bound to happen to you sooner or later. I think  making you his heir was the only sensible thing old Nutcombe ever  did. In his place I'd have done the same.'    'But he didn't even seem decently grateful at the time.'    'Probably not. He was a queer old bird. He had a most almighty row  with the governor in this office only a month or two ago about  absolutely nothing. They disagreed about something trivial, and  old Nutcombe stalked out and never came in again. That's the sort  of old bird he was.'    'Was he sane, do you think?'    'Absolutely, for legal purposes. We have three opinions from leading  doctors--collected by him in case of accidents, I suppose--each of  which declares him perfectly sound from the collar upward. But a  man can be pretty far gone, you know, without being legally insane,  and old Nutcombe--well, suppose we call him whimsical. He seems to  have zigzagged between the normal and the eccentric.    'His only surviving relatives appear to be a nephew and a niece.  The nephew dropped out of the running two years ago when his aunt,  old Nutcombe's wife, who had divorced old Nutcombe, left him her  money. This seems to have soured the old boy on the nephew, for in  the first of his wills that I've seen--you remember I told you I  had seen three--he leaves the niece the pile and the nephew only  gets twenty pounds. Well, so far there's nothing very eccentric  about old Nutcombe's proceedings. But wait!    'Six months after he had made that will he came in here and made  another. This left twenty pounds to the nephew as before, but  nothing at all to the niece. Why, I don't know. There was nothing  in the will about her having done anything to offend him during  those six months, none of those nasty slams you see in wills about  \"I bequeath to my only son John one shilling and sixpence. Now  perhaps he's sorry he married the cook.\" As far as I can make out  he changed his will just as he did when he left the money to you,  purely through some passing whim. Anyway, he did change it. He  left the pile to support the movement those people are running for  getting the Jews back to Palestine.    'He didn't seem, on second thoughts, to feel that this was quite  such a brainy scheme as he had at first, and it wasn't long before  he came trotting back to tear up this second will and switch back  to the first one--the one leaving the money to the niece. That  restoration to sanity lasted till about a month ago, when he broke  loose once more and paid his final visit here to will you the  contents of his stocking. This morning I see he's dead after a  short illness, so you collect. Congratulations!'    Lord Dawlish had listened to this speech in perfect silence. He now  rose and began to pace the room. He looked warm and uncomfortable.  His demeanour, in fact, was by no means the accepted demeanour of  the lucky heir.    'This is awful!' he said. 'Good Lord, Jerry, it's frightful!'    'Awful!--being left a million pounds?'    'Yes, like this. I feel like a bally thief.'    'Why on earth?'    'If it hadn't been for me this girl--what's her name?'    'Her name is Boyd--Elizabeth Boyd.'    'She would have had the whole million if it hadn't been for me.  Have you told her yet?'    'She's in America. I was writing her a letter just before you came  in--informal, you know, to put her out of her misery. If I had  waited for the governor to let her know in the usual course of red  tape we should never have got anywhere. Also one to the nephew,  telling him about his twenty pounds. I believe in humane treatment  on these occasions. The governor would write them a legal letter  with so many \"hereinbefores\" in it that they would get the idea  that they had been left the whole pile. I just send a cheery line  saying \"It's no good, old top. Abandon hope,\" and they know just  where they are. Simple and considerate.'    A glance at Bill's face moved him to further speech.    'I don't see why you should worry, Bill. How, by any stretch of  the imagination, can you make out that you are to blame for this  Boyd girl's misfortune? It looks to me as if these eccentric wills  of old Nutcombe's came in cycles, as it were. Just as he was due  for another outbreak he happened to meet you. It's a moral  certainty that if he hadn't met you he would have left all his  money to a Home for Superannuated Caddies or a Fund for Supplying  the Deserving Poor with Niblicks. Why should you blame yourself?'    'I don't blame myself. It isn't exactly that. But--but, well, what  would you feel like in my place?'    'A two-year-old.'    'Wouldn't you do anything?'    'I certainly would. By my halidom, I would! I would spend that  money with a vim and speed that would make your respected  ancestor, the Beau, look like a village miser.'    'You wouldn't--er--pop over to America and see whether something  couldn't be arranged?'    'What!'    'I mean--suppose you were popping in any case. Suppose you had  happened to buy a ticket for New York on to-morrow's boat,  wouldn't you try to get in touch with this girl when you got to  America, and see if you couldn't--er--fix up something?'    Jerry Nichols looked at him in honest consternation. He had always  known that old Bill was a dear old ass, but he had never dreamed  that he was such an infernal old ass as this.    'You aren't thinking of doing that?' he gasped.    'Well, you see, it's a funny coincidence, but I was going to  America, anyhow, to-morrow. I don't see why I shouldn't try to fix  up something with this girl.'    'What do you mean--fix up something? You don't suggest that you  should give the money up, do you?'    'I don't know. Not exactly that, perhaps. How would it be if I  gave her half, what? Anyway, I should like to find out about her,  see if she's hard up, and so on. I should like to nose round, you  know, and--er--and so forth, don't you know. Where did you say the  girl lived?'    'I didn't say, and I'm not sure that I shall. Honestly, Bill, you  mustn't be so quixotic.'    'There's no harm in my nosing round, is there? Be a good chap and  give me the address.'    'Well'--with misgivings--'Brookport, Long Island.'    'Thanks.'    'Bill, are you really going to make a fool of yourself?'    'Not a bit of it, old chap. I'm just going to--er--'    'To nose round?'    'To nose round,' said Bill.    Jerry Nichols accompanied his friend to the door, and once more  peace reigned in the offices of Nichols, Nichols, Nichols, and  Nichols.    The time of a man who has at a moment's notice decided to leave  his native land for a sojourn on foreign soil is necessarily taken  up with a variety of occupations; and it was not till the  following afternoon, on the boat at Liverpool, that Bill had  leisure to write to Claire, giving her the news of what had  befallen him. He had booked his ticket by a Liverpool boat in  preference to one that sailed from Southampton because he had not  been sure how Claire would take the news of his sudden decision to  leave for America. There was the chance that she might ridicule or  condemn the scheme, and he preferred to get away without seeing  her. Now that he had received this astounding piece of news from  Jerry Nichols he was relieved that he had acted in this way.  Whatever Claire might have thought of the original scheme, there  was no doubt at all what she would think of his plan of seeking  out Elizabeth Boyd with a view to dividing the legacy with her.    He was guarded in his letter. He mentioned no definite figures. He  wrote that Ira Nutcombe of whom they had spoken so often had most  surprisingly left him in his will a large sum of money, and eased  his conscience by telling himself that half of a million pounds  undeniably was a large sum of money.    The addressing of the letter called for thought. She would have  left Southampton with the rest of the company before it could  arrive. Where was it that she said they were going next week?  Portsmouth, that was it. He addressed the letter Care of The Girl  and the Artist Company, to the King's Theatre, Portsmouth.          5      The village of Brookport, Long Island, is a summer place. It  lives, like the mosquitoes that infest it, entirely on its summer  visitors. At the time of the death of Mr Ira Nutcombe, the only  all-the-year-round inhabitants were the butcher, the grocer, the  chemist, the other customary fauna of villages, and Miss Elizabeth  Boyd, who rented the ramshackle farm known locally as Flack's and  eked out a precarious livelihood by keeping bees.

The sight of the Pinjarapala is less lugubrious and much more amusing.  The Pinjarapala is the Bombay Hospital for decrepit animals, but a  similar institution exists in every town where Jainas dwell. Being one  of the most ancient, this is also one of the most interesting, of the  sects of India. It is much older than Buddhism, which took its rise  about 543 to 477 B.C. Jainas boast that Buddhism is nothing more than a  mere heresy of Jainism, Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, having been a  disciple and follower of one of the Jaina Gurus. The customs, rites,  and philosophical conceptions of Jainas place them midway between the  Brahmanists and the Buddhists. In view of their social arrangements,  they more closely resemble the former, but in their religion they  incline towards the latter. Their caste divisions, their total  abstinence from flesh, and their non-worship of the relics of the  saints, are as strictly observed as the similar tenets of the Brahmans,  but, like Buddhists, they deny the Hindu gods and the authority of  the Vedas, and adore their own twenty-four Tirthankaras, or Jinas, who  belong to the Host of the Blissful. Their priests, like the Buddhists',  never marry, they live in isolated viharas and choose their successors  from amongst the members of any social class. According to them, Prakrit  is the only sacred language, and is used in their sacred literature,  as well as in Ceylon. Jainas and Buddhists have the same traditional  chronology. They do not eat after sunset, and carefully dust any place  before sitting down upon it, that they may not crush even the tiniest of  insects. Both systems, or rather both schools of philosophy, teach the  theory of eternal indestructible atoms, following the ancient atomistic  school of Kanada. They assert that the universe never had a beginning  and never will have an end. \"The world and everything in it is but an  illusion, a Maya,\" say the Vedantists, the Buddhists, and the Jainas;  but, whereas the followers of Sankaracharya preach Parabrahm (a deity  devoid of will, understanding, and action, because \"It is absolute  understanding, mind and will\"), and Ishwara emanating from It, the  Jainas and the Buddhists believe in no Creator of the Universe,  but teach only the existence of Swabhawati, a plastic, infinite,  self-created principle in Nature. Still they firmly believe, as do  all Indian sects, in the transmigration of souls. Their fear, lest, by  killing an animal or an insect, they may, perchance, destroy the life of  an ancestor, develops their love and care for every living creature to  an almost incredible extent. Not only is there a hospital for invalid  animals in every town and village, but their priests always wear a  muslin muzzle, (I trust they will pardon the disrespectful expression!)  in order to avoid destroying even the smallest animalcule, by  inadvertence in the act of breathing. The same fear impels them to drink  only filtered water. There are a few millions of Jainas in Gujerat,  Bombay, Konkan, and some other places.    The Bombay Pinjarapala occupies a whole quarter of the town, and is  separated into yards, meadows and gardens, with ponds, cages for beasts  of prey, and enclosures for tame animals. This institution would have  served very well for a model of Noah's Ark. In the first yard, however,  we saw no animals, but, instead, a few hundred human skeletons--old men,  women and children. They were the remaining natives of the, so-called,  famine districts, who had crowded into Bombay to beg their bread. Thus,  while, a few yards off, the official \"Vets.\" were busily bandaging the  broken legs of jackals, pouring ointments on the backs of mangy dogs,  and fitting crutches to lame storks, human beings were dying, at their  very elbows, of starvation. Happily for the famine-stricken, there were  at that time fewer hungry animals than usual, and so they were fed on  what remained from the meals of the brute pensioners. No doubt many of  these wretched sufferers would have consented to transmigrate instantly  into the bodies of any of the animals who were ending so snugly their  earthly careers.    But even the Pinjarajala roses are not without thorns. The graminivorous  \"subjects,\" of course, could mot wish for anything better; but I doubt  very much whether the beasts of prey, such as tigers, hyenas, and  wolves, are content with the rules and the forcibly prescribed diet.  Jainas themselves turn with disgust even from eggs and fish, and, in  consequence, all the animals of which they have the care must turn  vegetarians. We were present when an old tiger, wounded by an English  bullet, was fed. Having sniffed at a kind of rice soup which was offered  to him, he lashed his tail, snarled, showing his yellow teeth, and with  a weak roar turned away from the food. What a look he cast askance upon  his keeper, who was meekly trying to persuade him to taste his nice  dinner! Only the strong bars of the cage saved the Jaina from a vigorous  protest on the part of this veteran of the forest. A hyena, with a  bleeding head and an ear half torn off, began by sitting in the trough  filled with this Spartan sauce, and then, without any further ceremony,  upset it, as if to show its utter contempt for the mess. The wolves  and the dogs raised such disconsolate howls that they attracted the  attention of two inseparable friends, an old elephant with a wooden  leg and a sore-eyed ox, the veritable Castor and Pollux of this  institution. In accordance with his noble nature, the first thought of  the elephant concerned his friend. He wound his trunk round the neck  of the ox, in token of protection, and both moaned dismally. Parrots,  storks, pigeons, flamingoes--the whole feathered tribe--revelled  in their breakfast. Monkeys were the first to answer the keeper's  invitation and greatly enjoyed themselves. Further on we were shown a  holy man, who was feeding insects with his own blood. He lay with his  eyes shut, and the scorching rays of the sun striking full upon his  naked body. He was literally covered with flies, mosquitoes, ants and  bugs.    \"All these are our brothers,\" mildly observed the keeper, pointing to  the hundreds of animals and insects. \"How can you Europeans kill and  even devour them?\"    \"What would you do,\" I asked, \"if this snake were about to bite you? Is  it possible you would not kill it, if you had time?\"    \"Not for all the world. I should cautiously catch it, and then I should  carry it to some deserted place outside the town, and there set it  free.\"    \"Nevertheless; suppose it bit you?\"    \"Then I should recite a mantram, and, if that produced no good result,  I should be fair to consider it as the finger of Fate, and quietly leave  this body for another.\"    These were the words of a man who was educated to a certain extent, and  very well read. When we pointed out that no gift of Nature is aimless,  and that the human teeth are all devouring, he answered by quoting whole  chapters of Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection and Origin of Species.  \"It is not true,\" argued he, \"that the first men were born with  canine teeth. It was only in course of time, with the degradation of  humanity,--only when the appetite for flesh food began to develop--that  the jaws changed their first shape under the influence of new  necessities.\"    I could not help asking myself, \"Ou la science va-t'elle se fourrer?\"        The same evening, in Elphinstone's Theatre, there was given a special  performance in honour of \"the American Mission,\" as we are styled here.  Native actors represented in Gujerati the ancient fairy drama Sita-Rama,  that has been adapted from the Ramayana, the celebrated epic by Vilmiki.  This drama is composed of fourteen acts and no end of tableaux, in  addition to transformation scenes. All the female parts, as usual, were  acted by young boys, and the actors, accord-ing to the historical and  national customs, were bare-footed and half-naked. Still, the richness  of the costumes, the stage adornments and transformations, were truly  wonderful. For instance, even on the stages of large metropolitan  theatres, it would have been difficult to give a better representation  of the army of Rama's allies, who are nothing more than troops of  monkeys under the leadership of Hanuman--the soldier, statesman,  dramatist, poet, god, who is so celebrated in history (that of India  s.v.p.). The oldest and best of all Sanskrit dramas, Hanuman-Natak, is  ascribed to this talented forefather of ours.    Alas! gone is the glorious time when, proud of our white skin (which  after all may be nothing more than the result of a fading, under the  influences of our northern sky), we looked down upon Hindus and  other \"niggers\" with a feeling of contempt well suited to our own  magnificence. No doubt Sir William Jones's soft heart ached, when  translating from the Sanskrit such humiliating sentences as the  following: \"Hanuman is said to be the forefather of the Europeans.\"  Rama, being a hero and a demi-god, was well entitled to unite all  the bachelors of his useful monkey army to the daughters of the Lanka  (Ceylon) giants, the Rakshasas, and to present these Dravidian beauties  with the dowry of all Western lands. After the most pompous marriage  ceremonies, the monkey soldiers made a bridge, with the help of their  own tails, and safely landed with their spouses in Europe, where they  lived very happily and had a numerous progeny. This progeny are we,  Europeans. Dravidian words found in some European languages, in Basque  for instance, greatly rejoice the hearts of the Brahmans, who would  gladly promote the philologists to the rank of demi-gods for this  important discovery, which confirms so gloriously their ancient legend.  But it was Darwin who crowned the edifice of proof with the authority of  Western education and Western scientific literature. The Indians became  still "]]]
