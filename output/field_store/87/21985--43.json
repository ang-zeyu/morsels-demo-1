So Volsung weds her withal; and long  they abode together with good hap and great love. They had ten sons and  one daughter, and their eldest son was hight Sigmund, and their daughter  Signy; and these two were twins, and in all wise the foremost and the  fairest of the children of Volsung the king, and mighty, as all his seed  was; even as has been long told from ancient days, and in tales of long  ago, with the greatest fame of all men, how that the Volsungs have been  great men and high-minded and far above the most of men both in cunning  and in prowess and all things high and mighty.    So says the story that king Volsung let build a noble hall in such a  wise, that a big oak-tree stood therein, and that the limbs of the tree  blossomed fair out over the roof of the hall, while below stood the  trunk within it, and the said trunk did men call Branstock.        ENDNOTES:    (1)  May (A.S. \"maeg\"), a maid.        CHAPTER III. Of the Sword that Sigmund, Volsung's son, drew from the  Branstock.    There was a king called Siggeir, who ruled over Gothland, a mighty king  and of many folk; he went to meet Volsung, the king, and prayed him for  Signy his daughter to wife; and the king took his talk well, and his  sons withal, but she was loth thereto, yet she bade her father rule in  this as in all other things that concerned her; so the king took such  rede (1) that he gave her to him, and she was betrothed to King Siggeir;  and for the fulfilling of the feast and the wedding, was King Siggeir  to come to the house of King Volsung. The king got ready the feast  according to his best might, and when all things were ready, came the  king's guests and King Siggeir withal at the day appointed, and many a  man of great account had Siggeir with him.    The tale tells that great fires were made endlong the hall, and the  great tree aforesaid stood midmost thereof; withal folk say that, whenas  men sat by the fires in the evening, a certain man came into the hall  unknown of aspect to all men; and suchlike array he had, that over him  was a spotted cloak, and he was bare-foot, and had linen-breeches knit  tight even unto the bone, and he had a sword in his hand as he went up  to the Branstock, and a slouched hat upon his head: huge he was, and  seeming-ancient, and one-eyed. (2) So he drew his sword and smote it  into the tree-trunk so that it sank in up to the hilts; and all held  back from greeting the man. Then he took up the word, and said--    \"Whoso draweth this sword from this stock, shall have the same as a gift  from me, and shall find in good sooth that never bare he better sword in  hand than is this.\"    Therewith out went the old man from the hall, and none knew who he was  or whither he went.    Now men stand up, and none would fain be the last to lay hand to the  sword, for they deemed that he would have the best of it who might first  touch it; so all the noblest went thereto first, and then the others,  one after other; but none who came thereto might avail to pull it out,  for in nowise would it come away howsoever they tugged at it; but now up  comes Sigmund, King Volsung's son, and sets hand to the sword, and pulls  it from the stock, even as if it lay loose before him; so good that  weapon seemed to all, that none thought he had seen such a sword before,  and Siggeir would fain buy it of him at thrice its weight of gold, but  Sigmund said--    \"Thou mightest have taken the sword no less than I from there whereas it  stood, if it had been thy lot to bear it; but now, since it has first of  all fallen into my hand, never shalt thou have it, though thou biddest  therefor all the gold thou hast.\"    King Siggeir grew wroth at these words, and deemed Sigmund had answered  him scornfully, but whereas was a wary man and a double-dealing, he  made as if he heeded this matter in nowise, yet that same evening he  thought how he might reward it, as was well seen afterwards.

(2)  The man is Odin, who is always so represented, because he         gave his eye as a pledge for a draught from the fountain of         Mimir, the source of all wisdom.        CHAPTER IV. How King Siggeir wedded Signy, and bade King Volsung and his  son to Gothland.    Now it is to be told that Siggeir goes to bed by Signy that night, and  the next morning the weather was fair; then says King Siggeir that he  will not bide, lest the wind should wax, or the sea grow impassable;  nor is it said that Volsung or his sons letted him herein, and that the  less, because they saw that he was fain to get him gone from the feast.  But now says Signy to her father--    \"I have no will to go away with Seggeir; neither does my heart smile  upon him, and I wot; by my fore-knowledge, and from the fetch (1) of our  kin, that from this counsel will great evil fall on us if this wedding  be not speedily undone.\"    \"Speak in no such wise, daughter!\" said he, \"for great shame will it be  to him, yea, and to us also, to break troth with him, he being sackless;  (2) and in naught may we trust him, and no friendship shall we have of  him, if these matters are broken off; but he will pay us back in as evil  wise as he may; for that alone is seemly, to hold truly to troth given.\"    So King Siggeir got ready for home, and before he went from the feast he  bade King Volsung, his father-in-law, come see him in Gothland, and all  his sons with him, whenas three months should be overpast, and to bring  such following with him, as he would have; and as he deemed meet for his  honour; and thereby will Siggeir the king pay back for the shortcomings  of the wedding-feast, in that he would abide thereat but one night only,  a thing not according to the wont of men. So King Volsung gave word to  come on the day named, and the kinsmen-in-law parted, and Siggeir went  home with his wife.        ENDNOTES:    (1)  Fetch; wraith, or familiar spirit.    (2)  Sackless (A.S. \"sacu\", Icel. \"sok\".) blameless.        CHAPTER V. Of the Slaying of King Volsung.    Now tells the tale of King Volsung and his sons that they go at the time  appointed to Gothland at the bidding of King Siggeir, and put off from  the land in three ships, all well manned, and have a fair voyage, and  made Gothland late of an evening tide.    But that same night came Signy and called her father and brothers to a  privy talk, and told them what she deemed King Siggeir was minded to do,  and how that he had drawn together an army no man may meet. \"And,\" says  she, \"he is minded to do guilefully by you; wherefore I bid you get  ye gone back again to your own land, and gather together the mightiest  power ye may, and then come back hither and avenge you; neither go ye  now to your undoing, for ye shall surely fail not to fall by his wiles  if ye turn not on him even as I bid you.\"    Then spake Volsung the king, \"All people and nations shall tell of the  word I spake, yet being unborn, wherein I vowed a vow that I would flee  in fear from neither fire nor the sword; even so have I done hitherto,  and shall I depart therefrom now I am old? Yea withal never shall the  maidens mock these my sons at the games, and cry out at them that they  fear death; once alone must all men need die, and from that season shall  none escape; so my rede is that we flee nowhither, but do the work of  our hands in as manly wise as we may; a hundred fights have I fought,  and whiles I had more, and whiles I had less, and yet ever had I the  victory, nor shall it ever be heard tell of me that I fled away or  prayed for peace.\"    Then Signy wept right sore, and prayed that she might not go back to  King Siggeir, but King Volsung answered--    \"Thou shalt surely go back to thine husband, and abide with him,  howsoever it fares with us.\"    So Signy went home, and they abode there that night; but in the morning,  as soon as it was day, Volsung bade his men arise and go aland and make  them ready for battle; so they went aland, all of them all-armed, and  had not long to wait before Siggeir fell on them with all his army, and  the fiercest fight there was betwixt them; and Siggeir cried on his men  to the onset all he might; and so the tale tells that King Volsung and  his sons went eight times right through Siggeir's folk that day, smiting  and hewing on either hand, but when they would do so even once again,  King Volsung fell amidst his folk and all his men withal, saving his ten  sons, for mightier was the power against them than they might withstand.    But now are all his sons taken, and laid in bonds and led away; and  Signy was ware withal that her father was slain, and her brothers taken  and doomed to death; that she called King Siggeir apart to talk with  her, and said--    \"This will I pray of thee, that thou let not slay my brothers hastily,  but let them be set awhile in the stocks, for home to me comes the saw  that says, \"Sweet to eye while seen\": but longer life I pray not for  them, because I wot well that my prayer will not avail me.\"    Then answered Siggeir:    \"Surely thou art mad and witless, praying thus for more bale for thy  brothers than their present slaying; yet this will I grant thee, for the  better it likes me the more they must bear, and the longer their pain is  or ever death come to them.\"    Now he let it be done even as she prayed, and a mighty beam was brought  and set on the feet of those ten brethren in a certain place of the  wild-wood, and there they sit day-long until night; but at midnight, as  they sat in the stocks, there came on them a she-wolf from out the wood;  old she was, and both great and evil of aspect; and the first thing she  did was to bite one of those brethren till he died, and then she ate him  up withal, and went on her way.    But the next morning Signy sent a man to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11523"],[0,"Behind the News: Voices from Goa's Press (#7)"],[1,"Editor. The Chief Subs and Subs returned to their  original publications or to new jobs. A Goan Sub,  Vincent Rangel, from Tivim-Bardez, went into business,  as the Mumbai-end partner of Manvin Couriers. I joined  the FPJ Group (Free Press Journal, its  tabloid-eveninger Bulletin and fortnightly, Onlooker)  as Goa Correspondent; moved in like capacity to IE when  FPJ's Chief Editor, S. Krishnamurty joined IE's Mumbai  edition as Resident Editor; played a role in J.D. Fernandes'   decision to start an English avatar of the near  defunct Portuguese O Heraldo (including the hiring of  its first editor) -- and almost joined, but didn't  quite -- as that newspaper's Chief Reporter, for  reasons that Rajan Narayan should know. And finally got  into business. Without regrets.      Chapter 4:  Novem Goem: The Roof Caves In    Paul J FernandesPaul Fernandes, known to journalists in the state for  his amiable nature, as also his ability and inclination  to do off-beat and far-from-the-beaten-track stories,  has published a vast amount on issues that concern  rural Goa, archaeology and the average resident of Goa.  He was recently winner of a Centre for Science and  Environment (Delhi) fellowship to study water issues in  Goa.    Konkani as the official language of Goa was then still  a distant dream. And granting of statehood to the Union  Territory, a remote possibility. A few Konkani  protagonists casually discussing the issue felt that a  medium was sorely needed to project the aspirations of  true Goans. And only a \"people's newspaper\" free from  the shackles of the capitalist could achieve that, they thought.    A few years earlier, Uzvadd, reincarnated as Novo Uzvadd   and Novo Prakash, had become defunct after its editor  Evagrio Jorge learnt a few bitter truths. The Herald --  in its new English-language avatar as also in the  much-touted role of a champion of Konkani -- was yet to  appear on the horizon.    It was then in 1980 on a dark night ... in Panjim ...  that the idea of launching a Konkani daily was born.  And talk about the requirement of funds for the mammoth  project threw up a novel idea. The way out was a 'pad-iatra  ' (or, long march across Goa on foot) through the  villages of the then union territory. At a follow-up  meeting, the individuals involved formed a Trust --  called the Novem Goem Pratishthan. They crowned the  then young seminary-student turned trade union leader  Christopher Fonseca, who floated the idea of a  pad-iatra, as its general secretary.    Trustees were Sara Machado, Advocate Pandurang  Mulgaonkar, Gurunath Kelekar, Dr F M Rebello, Advocate  Antonio Lobo, and Gustav Clovis Costa. Mathany Saldanha  and Fr Braz Faleiro played a stellar role in getting  the idea through.    And so began an eventful, and an unforgettable, 70-day  trudge through the nooks and corners of Goa. There were  some 70-odd volunteers, which included a few women and  two vivacious sisters, Tina and Colete Xavier, students  at that time.    The pad-iatra started on October 26, 1980. Fonseca  recalls that wherever they went, they received a good  response. Money, small and big sums, was contributed.  There were occasions too when -- language being a  sensitive issue in Goa -- they were insulted. But they  had decided not to retaliate in any way. A person spat  on a young pad-iatri, Srikant Chodankar, when he  knocked at his door for his contribution for the new  paper. But he bravely said 'thank you' and stepped out  with the others.    Two of the girls accompanying him burst into tears, as  participants from that venture recall.    The eventful 'pad-iatra' ended on December 31, New  Year's eve. By then, the volunteers had managed to  collect around Rs 250,000, a tidy sum considering that  this was just in the start of the 'eighties, when the  rupee still had more value than now.    Needless to say, it took about six months to create the  requisite infrastructure to launch the daily. Finding  premises, purchasing machinery and recruiting the  staff. When the Novem Goem first hit the stands in  1980, many naturally had great expectations that it  would serve as a people's paper. Several dailies in the  past had not survived for long, given the huge  requirement of funds    Indeed, Novem Goem could not scale great heights; but  it had many 'lows' during its span. The coverage could  not be extensive, nay it was even below average. This  is perhaps understandably because the publication could  not engage a big team of reporters or set up a network  of reporters in all corners of Goa. But it carried to  work with few expectations and fewer rewards.    During the agitation, the tabloid served to keep the  mass of Konkani lovers, specially in its heartland of Salcete,  if it can be called that, posted of various  developments. The paper served to forge a relationship  and bridge the gap between the old Roman Konkani  writers and those who had just started writing in the  Devnagri script. Well-known poets, writers, such as  Uday Bhembre, Dr Bhikaji Ganekar, Manoharrari Sardesai  were among those who often contributed their writings  to the paper.    The paper also sought to raise the standard of Konkani  among its readers by often explaining difficult words,  as compared to the poor quality of writing in most  Roman script periodicals. I myself recall contributing  to a column Aichim Don Utram (Today's Two Words), which  gave the readers two new words to learn daily, with  meanings in English and also illustrated by examples.    'Konkni uloi, Konkni boroi, Konknintlean sorkar choloi'  (Speak Konkani, Write Konkani, Administer The State In  Konkani), the slogan coined by one of the trustees,  Gurunath Kelekar, gained currency and set the mood  among Konkani lovers.    While the paper finally closed down, coincidentally, it  did so after Konkani was included in the Eight Schedule  of the Constitution of India and Goa was granted  statehood -- two of the avowed objectives for which the  Trust had launched the paper. Many may be skeptical  about the contribution of this small paper to these two  great and important causes. But having worked in this  paper for just over three years as a sub-editor, I  recall that Dr Rebello, as its editor, contributed  significantly to the chorus for the twin demand.    DURING THE ENTIRE existence of the paper, its  management had to face several struggles and even  upheavals among the trustees.    Its problems started from the day the presses were set  up. While an offset machine could have been bought, a  Glockner machine owned by one of the Trustees was sold  to the Trust. With that, it was only possible to print  a tabloid paper. The machinery subsequently gave  several problems. How a newspaper cannot survive  without infusion of frequent doses of capital was best  exemplified here. Advertising revenue was very low,  though there were phases when its staff pooled their  efforts to raise funds by canvassing for advertisements  through their own initiative. There were managerial  problems, too. With lack of experience in running a  paper, and negligence by some of the Trustees at  certain stages, the roof finally had to cave in.    A former trustee alleges that the quantum of  advertisements released by the government to the paper  was meagre, and the staff even led a morcha to the  Secretariat, alleging shabby treatment. This continued  even after Konkani was made the official language of  the state.    If the paper survived for around a decade, it could be  termed as a miracle of sorts. There were around 7,000  readers, who religiously read the daily. However, the  poor coverage towards the end saw its readership go  down sharply. The emergence of a slickly printed and  produced Konkani-monthly Gulab also hastened its death.    However, there was no dearth of sympathisers. Gulf Goans   contributed generously, and quite often, to keep it  afloat. But tiatrists were largely not among them as  they showed apathy towards it vis-a-vis advertisements  of their shows. They preferred an English-language  daily and very few advertised in Novem Goem, if at all rarely.    The real heroes and the sufferers in the bargain were  the Novem Goem workers, who toiled during its entire  10-year existence. Lack of revenue meant that they  often received their salaries late. On the 10th of any  month, it was not unusual for the management to  announce they would give some advance on the salary.  For one thing, the salary was being delayed; over and  above, to be told that they would get it in  installments was the ultimate affront. More so when  these were people with families to feed. But this went  on month after month, specially during the last few years.    They were entitled to a scale of salaries under Palekar  Wage Award -- the Central Government-notified standards  then in force for minimum wages to be paid to  journalists -- but they accepted graciously whatever  they were offered. This was, naturally, much below the  Wage Board recommendations.    And the employees, having few options, hung on with  commendable courage, though there was no hope of a turn  around. Their toil and sacrifices were really something  to think about. After the paper closed, they should  have received their dues from what came in as the  proceeds from the sale of machinery and the balance of  a raffle draw, which had been floated to raise funds  for the paper.    But they are yet to be given their due.    The paper finally went to bed for the last time some  time in June 1988. And a novel experiment to offer a  people's paper to the masses made a quiet and sad  exit....      Chapter 5:  The Herald of A New Ethos    R.K. NairR.K.
