And O son of Pritha, the celestial  Rishis also, all of pure souls, with sins completely washed off and  resplendent as the fire, and possessed of energy, and without sorrow of  any kind, and freed from the fever of anxiety, and all performers of  the Soma sacrifice, also wait upon and worship Indra. And Parasara and  Parvata and Savarni and Galava; and Sankha, and the Muni, Gaursiras,  and Durvasa, and Krodhana and Swena and the Muni Dhirghatamas; and  Pavitrapani, Savarni, Yajnavalkya and Bhaluki; and Udyalaka, Swetaketu,  and Tandya, and also Bhandayani; and Havishmat, and Garishta, and king  Harischandra; and Hridya, Udarshandilya. Parasarya, Krishivala;  Vataskandha, Visakha, Vidhatas and Kala. Karaladanta, Tastri, and  Vishwakarman, and Tumuru; and other Rishis, some born of women and  others living upon air, and others again living upon fire, these all  worship Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt, the lord of all the  worlds. And Sahadeva, and Sunitha, and Valmiki of great ascetic merit;  and Samika of truthful speech, and Prachetas ever fulfilling their  promises, and Medhatithi, and Vamadeva, and Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu;  and Maruta and Marichi, and Sthanu of great ascetic merit; and  Kakshivat, and Gautama, and Tarkhya, and also the Muni Vaishwanara; and  the Muni Kalakavrikhiya and Asravya, and also Hiranmaya, and Samvartta,  and Dehavya, and Viswaksena of great energy; and Kanwa, and Katyayana,  O king, and Gargya, and Kaushika;--all are present there along with the  celestial waters and plants; and faith, and intelligence, and the  goddess of learning, and wealth, religion, and pleasure; and lightning,  O son of Pandu; and the rain-charged clouds, and the winds, and all the  loud-sounding forces of heaven; the eastern point, the twenty seven  fires conveying the sacrificial butter, Agni and Soma, and the fire of  Indra, and Mitra, and Savitri, and Aryaman; Bhaga, Viswa the Sadhyas,  the preceptor (Vrihaspati), and also Sukra; and Vishwavasu and  Chitrasena, and Sumanas, and also Taruna; the Sacrifices, the gifts to  Brahmanas, the planets, and the stars, O Bharata, and the mantras that  are uttered in sacrifices--all these are present there. And, O King,  many Apsaras and Gandharvas, by various kinds of dances and music both  instrumental and vocal, and by the practice of auspicious rites, and by  the exhibition of many feats of skill, gratify the lord of the  celestials--Satakratu--the illustrious slayer of Vala and Vritra.  Besides these, many other Brahmanas and royal and celestial Rishis, all  resplendent as the fire, decked in floral wreaths and ornaments,  frequently come to and leave that assembly, riding on celestial cars of  various kinds. And Vrihaspati and Sukra are present there on all  occasions. These and many other illustrious ascetics of rigid vows, and  Bhrigu and the seven Rishis who are equal, O king, unto Brahma himself,  come to and leave that assembly house, riding on cars beautiful as the  car of Soma, and themselves looking as bright therein as Soma himself.  This, O mighty armed monarch, is the assembly house, called  Pushkaramalini, of Indra of a hundred sacrifices that I have seen.  Listen now to the account of Yama's assembly house.'      SECTION VIII    \"Narada said,--'O Yudhisthira, I shall now describe the assembly house  of Yama, the son of Vivaswat, which, O son of Pritha, was built by  Viswakarma. Listen now to me. Bright as burnished gold, that assembly  house, O monarch, covers an area of much more than a hundred yojanas.  Possessed of the splendour of the sun, it yieldeth everything that one  may desire. Neither very cool nor very hot, it delighteth the heart. In  that assembly house there is neither grief nor weakness of age, neither  hunger nor thirst. Nothing disagreeable findeth a place there, nor any  kind of evil feelings there. Every object of desire, celestial or  human, is to be found in that mansion. And all kinds of enjoyable  articles, as also of sweet, juicy, agreeable, and delicious edibles in  profusion that are licked, sucked, and drunk, are there, O chastiser of  all enemies. The floral wreaths in that mansion are of the most  delicious fragrance, and the trees that stand around it yield fruits  that are desired of them. There are both cold and hot waters and these  are sweet and agreeable. In that mansion many royal sages of great  sanctity and Brahmana sages also of great purity, cheerfully wait upon,  O child, and worship Yama, the son of Vivaswat. And Yayati, Nahusha,  Puru, Mandhatri, Somaka, Nriga; the royal sage Trasadasyu, Kritavirya,  Sautasravas; Arishtanemi, Siddha, Kritavega, Kriti, Nimi, Pratarddana,  Sivi, Matsya, Prithulaksha, Vrihadratha, Vartta, Marutta, Kusika,  Sankasya, Sankriti, Dhruva, Chaturaswa, Sadaswormi and king Kartavirya;  Bharata and Suratha, Sunitha, Nisatha, Nala, Divodasa, and Sumanas,  Amvarisha, Bhagiratha; Vyaswa, Vadhraswa, Prithuvega, Prithusravas,  Prishadaswa, Vasumanas, Kshupa, and Sumahavala, Vrishadgu, and  Vrishasena, Purukutsa, Dhwajin and Rathin; Arshtisena, Dwilipa, and the  high-souled Ushinara; Ausinari, Pundarika, Saryati, Sarava, and Suchi;  Anga, Rishta, Vena, Dushmanta, Srinjaya and Jaya; Bhangasuri, Sunitha,  and Nishada, and Bahinara; Karandhama, Valhika, Sudymna, and the mighty  Madhu; Aila and the mighty king of earth Maruta; Kapota, Trinaka, and  Shadeva, and Arjuna also. Vysawa; Saswa and Krishaswa, and king  Sasavindu; Rama the son of Dasaratha, and Lakshmana, and Pratarddana;  Alarka, and Kakshasena, Gaya, and Gauraswa; Rama the son of Jamadagnya,  Nabhaga, and Sagara; Bhuridyumna and Mahaswa, Prithaswa, and also  Janaka; king Vainya, Varisena, Purujit, and Janamejaya; Brahmadatta,  and Trigarta, and king Uparichara also; Indradyumna, Bhimajanu,  Gauraprishta, Nala, Gaya; Padma and Machukunda, Bhuridyumna,  Prasenajit; Aristanemi, Sudymna, Prithulauswa, and Ashtaka also; a  hundred kings of the Matsya race and hundred of the Vipa and a hundred  of the Haya races; a hundred kings of the name of Dhritarashtra, eighty  kings of the name of Janamejaya; a hundred monarchs called Brahmadatta,  and a hundred kings of the name of Iri; more than two hundred Bhishmas,  and also a hundred Bhimas; a hundred Prativindhyas, a hundred Nagas,  and a hundred Palasas, and a hundred called Kasa and Kusa; that king of  kings Santanu, and thy father Pandu, Usangava, Sata-ratha, Devaraja,  Jayadratha; the intelligent royal sage Vrishadarva with his ministers;  and a thousand other kings known by the name of Sasa-vindu, and who  have died, having performed many grand horse-sacrifices with large  presents to the Brahmanas--these holy royal sages of grand achievements  and great knowledge of the Sastras, wait upon, O King, and worship the  son of Vivaswat in that assembly house. And Agastya and Matanga, and  Kala, and Mrityu (Death), performers of sacrifices, the Siddhas, and  many Yogins; the Prtris (belonging to the classes--called Agniswattas,  Fenapa, Ushampa, Swadhavat, and Verhishada), as also those others that  have forms; the wheel of time, and the illustrious conveyer himself of  the sacrificial butter; all sinners among human beings, as also those  that have died during the winter solstice; these officers of Yama who  have been appointed to count the allotted days of everybody and  everything; the Singsapa, Palasa, Kasa, and Kusa trees and plants, in  their embodied forms, these all, O king, wait upon and worship the god  of justice in that assembly house of his. These and many others are  present at the Sabha of the king of the Pitris (manes). So numerous are  they that I am incapable of describing them either by mentioning their  names or deeds. O son of Pritha, the delightful assembly house, moving  everywhere at the will of its owner, is of wide extent. It was built by  Viswakarma after a long course of ascetic penances. And, O Bharata,  resplendent with his own effulgence, it stands glorified in all its  beauty. Sannyasis of severe ascetic penance, of excellent vows, and of  truthful speech, peaceful and pure and sanctified by holy deeds, of  shining bodies and attired in spotless robes, decked with bracelets and  floral garlands, with ear-rings of burnished gold, and adorned with  their own holy acts as with the marks of their order (painted over  their bodies), constantly visit that Sabha (Assembly). Many illustrious  Gandharvas, and many Apsaras fill every part of that mansion with  music; both instrumental and vocal and with sounds of laughter and  dance. And, O son of Pritha, excellent perfumes, and sweet sounds and  garlands of celestial flowers always contribute towards making that  mansion supremely blest. And hundreds of thousands of virtuous persons,  of celestial beauty and great wisdom, always wait upon and worship the  illustrious Yama, the lord of created beings in that assembly house.  Such, O monarch, is the Sabha, of the illustrious king of the Pitris! I  shall now describe unto the assembly house of Varuna also called  Pushkaramalini!'      SECTION IX    \"Narada said--'O Yudhishthira, the celestial Sabha of Varuna is  unparalleled in splendour. In dimensions it is similar to that of Yama.  Its walls and arches are all of pure white. It hath been built by  Viswakarma (the celestial architect) within the waters. It is  surrounded on all sides by many celestial trees made of gems and jewels  and yielding excellent fruits and flowers. And many plants with their  weight of blossoms, blue and yellow, and black and darkish, and white  and red, that stand there, or excellent bowers around. Within those  bowers hundreds and thousands of birds of diverse species, beautiful  and variegated, always pour forth their melodies. The atmosphere of  that mansion is extremely delightful, neither cold nor hot. Owned by  Varuna, that delightful assembly house of pure white consists of many  rooms and is furnished with"]]]
