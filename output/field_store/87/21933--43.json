The defense was the first  to recover, Mike, with a swing, upsetting Stone, and Psmith, having  seized and emptied Jellicoe's jug over Spiller, getting to work again  with the cord in a manner that roused the utmost enthusiasm of the  spectators.    Agility seemed to be the leading feature of Psmith's tactics. He was  everywhere--on Mike's bed, on his own, on Jellicoe's (drawing a  passionate complaint from that noncombatant, on whose face he  inadvertently trod), on the floor--he ranged the room, sowing  destruction.    The enemy were disheartened; they had started with the idea that this  was to be a surprise attack, and it was disconcerting to find the  garrison armed at all points. Gradually they edged to the door, and a  final rush sent them through.    \"Hold the door for a second,\" cried Psmith, and vanished. Mike was alone  in the doorway.    It was a situation which exactly suited his frame of mind; he stood  alone in direct opposition to the community into which Fate had  pitchforked him so abruptly. He liked the feeling; for the first time  since his father had given him his views upon school reports that  morning in the Easter holidays, he felt satisfied with life. He hoped,  outnumbered as he was, that the enemy would come on again and not give  the thing up in disgust; he wanted more.    On an occasion like this there is rarely anything approaching concerted  action on the part of the aggressors. When the attack came, it was not a  combined attack; Stone, who was nearest to the door, made a sudden dash  forward, and Mike hit him under the chin.    Stone drew back, and there was another interval for rest and reflection.    It was interrupted by the reappearance of Psmith, who strolled back  along the passage swinging his dressing-gown cord as if it were some  clouded cane.    \"Sorry to keep you waiting, Comrade Jackson,\" he said politely. \"Duty  called me elsewhere. With the kindly aid of a guide who knows the lie of  the land, I have been making a short tour of the dormitories. I have  poured divers jugfuls of water over Comrade Spiller's bed, Comrade  Robinson's bed, Comrade Stone's--Spiller, Spiller, these are harsh  words; where you pick them up I can't think--not from me. Well, well, I  suppose there must be an end to the pleasantest of functions. Good  night, good night.\"    The door closed behind Mike and himself. For ten minutes shufflings and  whisperings went on in the corridor, but nobody touched the handle.    Then there was a sound of retreating footsteps, and silence reigned.    On the following morning there was a notice on the house board. It ran:      INDOOR GAMES      _Dormitory raiders are informed that in future neither Mr. Psmith    nor Mr. Jackson will be at home to visitors. This nuisance must now    cease._      R. PSMITH.    M. JACKSON.        7    ADAIR      On the same morning Mike met Adair for the first time.    He was going across to school with Psmith and Jellicoe, when a group of  three came out of the gate of the house next door.    \"That's Adair,\" said Jellicoe, \"in the middle.\"    His voice had assumed a tone almost of awe.    \"Who's Adair?\" asked Mike.    \"Captain of cricket, and lots of other things.\"    Mike could only see the celebrity's back. He had broad shoulders and  wiry, light hair, almost white. He walked well, as if he were used to  running. Altogether a fit-looking sort of man. Even Mike's jaundiced  eye saw that.    As a matter of fact, Adair deserved more than a casual glance. He was  that rare type, the natural leader. Many boys and men, if accident, or  the passage of time, places them in a position where they are expected  to lead, can handle the job without disaster; but that is a very  different thing from being a born leader. Adair was of the sort that  comes to the top by sheer force of character and determination. He was  not naturally clever at work, but he had gone at it with a dogged  resolution which had carried him up the school, and landed him high in  the Sixth. As a cricketer he was almost entirely self-taught. Nature had  given him a good eye, and left the thing at that. Adair's doggedness had  triumphed over her failure to do her work thoroughly. At the cost of  more trouble than most people give to their life work he had made  himself into a bowler. He read the authorities, and watched first-class  players, and thought the thing out on his own account, and he divided  the art of bowling into three sections. First, and most  important--pitch. Second on the list--break. Third--pace. He set himself  to acquire pitch. He acquired it. Bowling at his own pace and without  any attempt at break, he could now drop the ball on an envelope seven  times out of ten.    Break was a more uncertain quantity. Sometimes he could get it at the  expense of pitch, sometimes at the expense of pace. Some days he could  get all three, and then he was an uncommonly bad man to face on anything  but a plumb wicket.    Running he had acquired in a similar manner. He had nothing approaching  style, but he had twice won the mile and half mile at the Sports off  elegant runners, who knew all about stride and the correct timing of the  sprints and all the rest of it.    Briefly, he was a worker. He had heart.    A boy of Adair's type is always a force in a school. In a big public  school or six or seven hundred, his influence is felt less; but in a  small school like Sedleigh he is like a tidal wave, sweeping all before  him. There were two hundred boys at Sedleigh, and there was not one of  them in all probability who had not, directly or indirectly, been  influenced by Adair. As a small boy his sphere was not large, but the  effects of his work began to be apparent even then. It is human nature  to want to get something which somebody else obviously values very much;  and when it was observed by members of his form that Adair was going to  great trouble and inconvenience to secure a place in the form eleven or  fifteen, they naturally began to think, too, that it was worth being in  those teams. The consequence was that his form always played hard. This  made other forms play hard. And the net result was that, when Adair  succeeded to the captaincy of Rugger and cricket in the same year,  Sedleigh, as Mr. Downing, Adair's housemaster and the nearest approach  to a cricket master that Sedleigh possessed, had a fondness for saying,  was a keen school. As a whole, it both worked and played with energy.    All it wanted now was opportunity.    This Adair was determined to give it. He had that passionate fondness  for his school which every boy is popularly supposed to have, but which  really is implanted in about one in every thousand. The average  public-school boy _likes_ his school. He hopes it will lick Bedford at  Rugger and Malvern at cricket, but he rather bets it won't. He is sorry  to leave, and he likes going back at the end of the holidays, but as for  any passionate, deep-seated love of the place, he would think it rather  bad form than otherwise. If anybody came up to him, slapped him on the  back, and cried, \"Come along, Jenkins, my boy! Play up for the old  school, Jenkins! The dear old school! The old place you love so!\" he  would feel seriously ill.    Adair was the exception.    To Adair, Sedleigh was almost a religion. Both his parents were dead;  his guardian, with whom he spent the holidays, was a man with neuralgia  at one end of him and gout at the other; and the only really pleasant  times Adair had had, as far back as he could remember, he owed to  Sedleigh. The place had grown on him, absorbed him. Where Mike,  violently transplanted from Wrykyn, saw only a wretched little hole not  to be mentioned in the same breath with Wrykyn, Adair, dreaming of the  future, saw a colossal establishment, a public school among public  schools, a lump of human radium, shooting out Blues and Balliol Scholars  year after year without ceasing.    It would not be so till long after he was gone and forgotten, but he did  not mind that. His devotion to Sedleigh was purely unselfish. He did not  want fame. All he worked for was that the school should grow and grow,  keener and better at games and more prosperous year by year, till it  should take its rank among _the_ schools, and to be an Old Sedleighan  should be a badge passing its owner everywhere.    \"He's captain of cricket and Rugger,\" said Jellicoe impressively. \"He's  in the shooting eight. He's won the mile and half mile two years  running. He would have boxed at Aldershot last term, only he sprained  his wrist. And he plays fives jolly well!\"    \"Sort of little tin god,\" said Mike, taking a violent dislike to Adair  from that moment.    Mike's actual acquaintance with this all-round man dated from the dinner  hour that day. Mike was walking to the house with Psmith. Psmith was a  little ruffled on account of a slight passage-of-arms he had had with  his form master during morning school.    \"'There's a P before the Smith,' I said to him. 'Ah, P. Smith, I see,'  replied the goat. 'Not Peasmith,' I replied, exercising wonderful  self-restraint, 'just Psmith.' It took me ten minutes to drive the thing  into the man's head; and when I _had_ driven it in, he sent me out of  the room for looking at him through my eyeglass. Comrade Jackson, I fear  me we have fallen among bad men. I suspect that we are going to be much  persecuted by scoundrels.\"    \"Both you chaps play cricket, I suppose?\"    They turned. It was Adair. Seeing him face to face, Mike was aware of a  pair of very bright blue eyes and a square jaw. In any other place and  mood he would have liked Adair at sight. His prejudice, however, against  all things Sedleighan was too much for him. \"I don't,\" he said shortly.    \"Haven't you _ever_ played?\"    \"My little sister and I sometimes play with a soft ball at home.\"    Adair looked sharply at him. A temper was evidently one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10589"],[0,"Turkish Prisoners in Egypt (#7)"],[1,"an, by calling an employee in a  Constantinople factory, who speaks French and English perfectly, serves  as orderly-interpreter.    An English Red Cross orderly assists the doctor. An Austrian dentist,  formerly in business at Cairo, gives dental attention to the prisoners;  he has a complete outfit of instruments.    The infirmary is well housed in a stone building. It contains a  consulting-room, supplied with a full-flushed lavatory basin; a sick  ward with 6 iron beds, mattress and coverings _ad libitum_; an isolation  ward, and a dispensary.    Only slight cases are treated at the infirmary; serious cases are  removed to Hospital No. 21 at Alexandria, situated within 10 minutes of  the camp, a large modern hospital overlooking the sea.    On the day of our inspection there were in the infirmary 1 prisoner ill  with bronchitis; at the hospital 1 tuberculous case and 1 with a wounded  elbow.    The sanitary state of the camp has always been excellent. Apart from two  relapse cases of dysentery in 1916, there has been neither trachoma,  typhoid, typhus, malaria, nor any other infectious disease. This is  explained by the fact that the interned civilians were not in bad health  before their captivity, as was the case with soldiers who had sojourned  in the desert, whom we saw in the other Egyptian camps.    There had been no deaths in the camp or at the hospital in Alexandria.  The orderly, Abrahim Hassan, told us of his own accord that the sick  receive the most assiduous attention, and have nothing but praise for  the resident physician.      _Religion and Amusements._--The prisoners offer their prayers daily. A  mosque will be built for them in the new camp at Sidi Bishr.    Catholics are looked after by several Austrian priests, who used to  manage Catholic schools in Upper Egypt.    For the Germans and Austrians there is a good circulating library,  containing English, French and German books.    The prisoners have formed an orchestra, and organised theatrical  performances, for which they have painted pretty scenery.    There is a cinematograph performance every evening. There are a piano  and harmonium. A photographer, who had an establishment in Cairo before  the war, practises his art in the camp.      _Discipline._--The very occasional cases of infraction of rules which  entail one or more days' detention in the police cells, have a special  diet prescribed for them. The military authorities find the general  conduct of the civilians quite satisfactory.      _Exercise and Sports._--The prisoners have at their own disposal that  part of the grounds lying between the tents and the barracks, a broad  space where they can amuse themselves all day long with football and  other games.    They have also a tennis-court, of which the Austro-Germans make more use  than the Orientals; a committee of the prisoners arrange the hours for  each set of players. Skittles are very popular. Fencing is eagerly  learned; the English officer who teaches it being delighted with his  pupils' progress. Lessons in gymnastics, like those in other sports, are  optional.    Periodically a gymkhana is got up, with donkey races, gymnastic  competitions, and the distribution of prizes.      _Work._--No work is demanded from the prisoners.      _Correspondence, Money Orders and Parcels._--Very few money orders are  received. The interned Turks are chiefly illiterate; those whose wives  are interned at Cairo, and who are allowed to occasionally visit them,  seldom write, as they know them to be well treated. Parcels are seldom  sent to the camp, and hitherto no philanthropic society has busied  itself over the necessitous.      _Prisoners' Aid._--The only plea which has been addressed to us by means  of the Ottoman interpreter, who speaks French and English extremely  well, comes from a certain number of destitute prisoners. They wish to  have, in addition to the complete outfit with woollen overcoat supplied  by the English Government, a change of warm garments, which they have  not the means to buy. Many find it difficult to wear the kind of  foot-gear in ordinary use--the heelless leather Turkish slippers--and  wish for laced shoes such as they wear at home. We asked the interpreter  to make out a list of names of the needy; and after submitting it to the  commandant of the camps for verification, we decided to send him from  the Ottoman Red Cross Fund the sum of 2,000 francs, to provide these  prisoners with the extra garments which they require, and with shoes and  tobacco.          ~7. Sidi Bishr Camp.~    _(Visited on January 6, 1917.)_      The camp of Sidi Bishr is situated 15 kilometres (9-1/2 miles) to the  north-east of Alexandria in a healthy spot on the sea shore, where the  sand dunes form little hillocks intersected by miniature valleys. Palms  are scattered over it, and it lies open to the fresh breezes. The view  from the highest points of the camp is very extensive. A recently  constructed road for vehicular traffic leads into the camp, all the  appointments of which give the impression that everything has been done  to make the prisoners as comfortable as possible. A kitchen garden has  just been laid out in a sheltered place, and a flat piece of ground  surrounded by palm trees prepared for games, tennis, football, etc.      _Strength._--The camp at Sidi Bishr contains 430 officers, 60 of whom  have been here since February, 1915; 410 orderlies captured with their  officers, on whom they attend, each officer having 1 orderly; 10 imaums  (priests); 20 civilians, who were captured by the Sherif of Mecca and at  once handed over to the English.    The commandant of the camp is Lieut.-Colonel Coates.    The American charge d'affaires in Egypt has twice visited the camp.      _Accommodation._--The equipment of the camp at Sidi Bishr not having  been entirely completed before our visit we found some of the buildings  still in course of erection. But the officers' quarters were ready, and  lacked nothing except some furniture, which was daily expected. The  barracks, 25 metres (81 feet) long and 8 metres (20 feet) wide,  consisted of a solid wooden framework, with partitions either of timber  or cement, constructed in the camp by native workmen. A corridor about 1  metre 75 (6 feet) wide runs all along the front of the building, and  gives access to the chambers. These measure about 3 metres 50 (14 feet)  by 4 metres (17 feet), and 4 metres (17 feet) from the wooden floor to  the ceiling. All the interior walls are lime-washed. Each room has two  windows, glazed and also covered with wire gauze to exclude insects, and  a latched door. Chimneys rise above the roof, which is of timber covered  with tarred felt.    According to regulation, the number of occupants of each chamber depends  upon their grade. Officers up to the rank of captain are quartered four  in each dormitory; captains three, and colonels two. (Some superior  officers have each a separate chamber.) The orderlies are housed  elsewhere. All the buildings are lighted by electricity, generated by a  local plant.      _Bedding._--The iron beds have wire springs, mattresses stuffed with  vegetable fibre, pillows, and sufficiency of blankets, to which many  officers like to add curtains and coverlets. The rest of the furniture  is adequate, and easy-chairs are general.      _Food._--The officers' mess is run by a contractor. One of the officers,  appointed by his comrades, is entrusted with arranging the menus and  seeing them properly carried out. No limit is fixed to the choice and  quantity of food. The cost must not exceed 10 piastres (about 2s.)  daily, including tea, coffee, sugar, preserves, etc. The officers can  get any extras which they desire either from the canteen or from the  town, except alcoholic drinks, which are forbidden. The meat is  previously inspected by the veterinary of the sanitary department. The  bread is particularly good. Officers are given European bread, orderlies  native bread. We tasted the day's menu ourselves. No complaints with  regard to food reached us. The Turkish officers take their meals in two  dining-rooms, each of which seats 150. The tables are covered with  cloths; the china and plate are suitable.    The orderlies' fare is wholesome and sufficient.      _Dress._--The Turkish officers are warmly and suitably clad. They can  procure for themselves all kinds of toilet articles and other equipment.  Most of them wear civilian costume with a fez. An Alexandria tradesman  comes to the camp to take their orders.    When inspecting the orderlies we heard some of them complain of a lack  of linen, especially of drawers. Surprised by this, we made an immediate  inquiry, which produced the following results: the orderlies all  received their regulation supply of linen, and signed a receipt in the  register. A certain number of them subsequently sold the articles to  their officers; these are the men who now complain of a deficiency of  linen.      _Hygiene._--Abundant and wholesome drinking water is laid on from the  town system. The toilet supply comes to cement basins provided with many  taps. The water from the lavatories and kitchens empties itself into a  lake at some distance from the camp.    In the morning the officers use the baths or douches fitted up close to  the barracks, and separated from each other by woven grass partitions.    The officers' linen is washed by their orderlies in very convenient  wash-houses built of wood and cement.    There are 44 Turkish W.C.'s, cemented, at a good distance from the  quarters. They are arranged over cesspools 18 feet deep, disinfected  every day with whitewash and cresol, and are quite odourless.      _Medical Attention._--The health of the inmates of Sidi Bishr Camp is  looked after by an English doctor, Captain Gillespie, assisted by an  Armenian doctor, who practised at Aleppo in Turkey before the war.    These two doctors speak Arabic and Turkish.    An English"]]]
