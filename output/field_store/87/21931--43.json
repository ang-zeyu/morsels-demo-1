Eventually, after a trying night, he  found his way to Mr. Sipperley's residence, where he was able to secure  lodging and a change of costume in the morning.\"    I nestled against the pillows, the brow a bit drawn. It is all very well  to try to do old school friends a spot of good, but I could not but feel  that in espousing the cause of a lunkhead capable of mucking things up as  Gussie had done, I had taken on a contract almost too big for human  consumption. It seemed to me that what Gussie needed was not so much the  advice of a seasoned man of the world as a padded cell in Colney Hatch  and a couple of good keepers to see that he did not set the place on  fire.    Indeed, for an instant I had half a mind to withdraw from the case and  hand it back to Jeeves. But the pride of the Woosters restrained me. When  we Woosters put our hands to the plough, we do not readily sheathe the  sword. Besides, after that business of the mess-jacket, anything  resembling weakness would have been fatal.    \"I suppose you realize, Jeeves,\" I said, for though one dislikes to rub  it in, these things have to be pointed out, \"that all this was your  fault?\"    \"Sir?\"    \"It's no good saying 'Sir?' You know it was. If you had not insisted on  his going to that dance--a mad project, as I spotted from the first--this  would not have happened.\"    \"Yes, sir, but I confess I did not anticipate----\"    \"Always anticipate everything, Jeeves,\" I said, a little sternly. \"It is  the only way. Even if you had allowed him to wear a Pierrot costume,  things would not have panned out as they did. A Pierrot costume has  pockets. However,\" I went on more kindly, \"we need not go into that now.  If all this has shown you what comes of going about the place in scarlet  tights, that is something gained. Gussie waits without, you say?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then shoot him in, and I will see what I can do for him.\"        -6-      Gussie, on arrival, proved to be still showing traces of his grim  experience. The face was pale, the eyes gooseberry-like, the ears  drooping, and the whole aspect that of a man who has passed through the  furnace and been caught in the machinery. I hitched myself up a bit  higher on the pillows and gazed at him narrowly. It was a moment, I could  see, when first aid was required, and I prepared to get down to cases.    \"Well, Gussie.\"    \"Hullo, Bertie.\"    \"What ho.\"    \"What ho.\"    These civilities concluded, I felt that the moment had come to touch  delicately on the past.    \"I hear you've been through it a bit.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Thanks to Jeeves.\"    \"It wasn't Jeeves's fault.\"    \"Entirely Jeeves's fault.\"    \"I don't see that. I forgot my money and latchkey----\"    \"And now you'd better forget Jeeves. For you will be interested to hear,  Gussie,\" I said, deeming it best to put him in touch with the position of  affairs right away, \"that he is no longer handling your little problem.\"    This seemed to slip it across him properly. The jaws fell, the ears  drooped more limply. He had been looking like a dead fish. He now looked  like a deader fish, one of last year's, cast up on some lonely beach and  left there at the mercy of the wind and tides.    \"What!\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You don't mean that Jeeves isn't going to----\"    \"No.\"    \"But, dash it----\"    I was kind, but firm.    \"You will be much better off without him. Surely your terrible  experiences of that awful night have told you that Jeeves needs a rest.  The keenest of thinkers strikes a bad patch occasionally. That is what  has happened to Jeeves. I have seen it coming on for some time. He has  lost his form. He wants his plugs decarbonized. No doubt this is a shock  to you. I suppose you came here this morning to seek his advice?\"    \"Of course I did.\"    \"On what point?\"    \"Madeline Bassett has gone to stay with these people in the country, and  I want to know what he thinks I ought to do.\"    \"Well, as I say, Jeeves is off the case.\"    \"But, Bertie, dash it----\"    \"Jeeves,\" I said with a certain asperity, \"is no longer on the case. I am  now in sole charge.\"    \"But what on earth can you do?\"    I curbed my resentment. We Woosters are fair-minded. We can make  allowances for men who have been parading London all night in scarlet  tights.    \"That,\" I said quietly, \"we shall see. Sit down and let us confer. I am  bound to say the thing seems quite simple to me. You say this girl has  gone to visit friends in the country. It would appear obvious that you  must go there too, and flock round her like a poultice. Elementary.\"    \"But I can't plant myself on a lot of perfect strangers.\"    \"Don't you know these people?\"    \"Of course I don't. I don't know anybody.\"    I pursed the lips. This did seem to complicate matters somewhat.    \"All that I know is that their name is Travers, and it's a place called  Brinkley Court down in Worcestershire.\"    I unpursed my lips.    \"Gussie,\" I said, smiling paternally, \"it was a lucky day for you when  Bertram Wooster interested himself in your affairs. As I foresaw from the  start, I can fix everything. This afternoon you shall go to Brinkley  Court, an honoured guest.\"    He quivered like a _mousse_. I suppose it must always be rather a  thrilling experience for the novice to watch me taking hold.    \"But, Bertie, you don't mean you know these Traverses?\"    \"They are my Aunt Dahlia.\"    \"My gosh!\"    \"You see now,\" I pointed out, \"how lucky you were to get me behind you.  You go to Jeeves, and what does he do? He dresses you up in scarlet  tights and one of the foulest false beards of my experience, and sends  you off to fancy-dress balls. Result, agony of spirit and no progress. I  then take over and put you on the right lines. Could Jeeves have got you  into Brinkley Court? Not a chance. Aunt Dahlia isn't his aunt. I merely  mention these things.\"    \"By Jove, Bertie, I don't know how to thank you.\"    \"My dear chap!\"    \"But, I say.\"    \"Now what?\"    \"What do I do when I get there?\"    \"If you knew Brinkley Court, you would not ask that question. In those  romantic surroundings you can't miss. Great lovers through the ages have  fixed up the preliminary formalities at Brinkley. The place is simply ill  with atmosphere. You will stroll with the girl in the shady walks. You  will sit with her on the shady lawns. You will row on the lake with her.  And gradually you will find yourself working up to a point where----\"    \"By Jove, I believe you're right.\"    \"Of course, I'm right. I've got engaged three times at Brinkley. No  business resulted, but the fact remains. And I went there without the  foggiest idea of indulging in the tender pash. I hadn't the slightest  intention of proposing to anybody. Yet no sooner had I entered those  romantic grounds than I found myself reaching out for the nearest girl in  sight and slapping my soul down in front of her. It's something in the  air.\"    \"I see exactly what you mean. That's just what I want to be able to  do--work up to it. And in London--curse the place--everything's in such a  rush that you don't get a chance.\"    \"Quite. You see a girl alone for about five minutes a day, and if you  want to ask her to be your wife, you've got to charge into it as if you  were trying to grab the gold ring on a merry-go-round.\"    \"That's right. London rattles one. I shall be a different man altogether  in the country. What a bit of luck this Travers woman turning out to be  your aunt.\"    \"I don't know what you mean, turning out to be my aunt. She has been my  aunt all along.\"    \"I mean, how extraordinary that it should be your aunt that Madeline's  going to stay with.\"    \"Not at all. She and my Cousin Angela are close friends. At Cannes she  was with us all the time.\"    \"Oh, you met Madeline at Cannes, did you? By Jove, Bertie,\" said the poor  lizard devoutly, \"I wish I could have seen her at Cannes. How wonderful  she must have looked in beach pyjamas! Oh, Bertie----\"    \"Quite,\" I said, a little distantly. Even when restored by one of  Jeeves's depth bombs, one doesn't want this sort of thing after a hard  night. I touched the bell and, when Jeeves appeared, requested him to  bring me telegraph form and pencil. I then wrote a well-worded  communication to Aunt Dahlia, informing her that I was sending my friend,  Augustus Fink-Nottle, down to Brinkley today to enjoy her hospitality,  and handed it to Gussie.    \"Push that in at the first post office you pass,\" I said. \"She will find  it waiting for her on her return.\"    Gussie popped along, flapping the telegram and looking like a close-up of  Joan Crawford, and I turned to Jeeves and gave him a precis of my  operations.    \"Simple, you observe, Jeeves. Nothing elaborate.\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Nothing far-fetched. Nothing strained or bizarre. Just Nature's remedy.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"This is the attack as it should have been delivered. What do you call it  when two people of opposite sexes are bunged together in close  association in a secluded spot, meeting each other every day and seeing a  lot of each other?\"    \"Is 'propinquity' the word you wish, sir?\"    \"It is. I stake everything on propinquity, Jeeves. Propinquity, in my  opinion, is what will do the trick. At the moment, as you are aware,  Gussie is a mere jelly when in the presence. But ask yourself how he will  feel in a week or so, after he and she have been helping themselves to  sausages out of the same dish day after day at the breakfast sideboard.  Cutting the same ham, ladling out communal kidneys and bacon--why----\"    I broke off abruptly. I had had one of my ideas.    \"Golly, Jeeves!\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Here's an instance of how you have to think of everything. You heard me  mention sausages, kidneys and bacon and ham.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Well, there must be nothing of that. Fatal. The wrong note entirely.

Mr. Knopf took them round to the police-station himself immediately, and  identified the stones as some of his Parisian ones.    \"Later on the detective went to view the place where the find had been  made, and there conceived the plan upon which he built big cherished  hopes.    \"Acting upon the advice of Mr. Francis Howard, the police decided to let  the anonymous tramp out of his safe retreat within the station, and to  allow him to wander whithersoever he chose. A good idea, perhaps--the  presumption being that, sooner or later, if the man was in any way mixed  up with the cunning thieves, he would either rejoin his comrades or even  lead the police to where the remnant of his hoard lay hidden; needless  to say, his footsteps were to be literally dogged.    \"The wretched tramp, on his discharge, wandered out of the yard,  wrapping his thin coat round his shoulders, for it was a bitterly cold  afternoon. He began operations by turning into the Town Hall Tavern for  a good feed and a copious drink. Mr. Francis Howard noted that he seemed  to eye every passer-by with suspicion, but he seemed to enjoy his  dinner, and sat some time over his bottle of wine.    \"It was close upon four o'clock when he left the tavern, and then began  for the indefatigable Mr. Howard one of the most wearisome and  uninteresting chases, through the mazes of the London streets, he ever  remembers to have made. Up Notting Hill, down the slums of Notting  Dale, along the High Street, beyond Hammersmith, and through Shepherd's  Bush did that anonymous tramp lead the unfortunate detective, never  hurrying himself, stopping every now and then at a public-house to get a  drink, whither Mr. Howard did not always care to follow him.    \"In spite of his fatigue, Mr. Francis Howard's hopes rose with every  half-hour of this weary tramp. The man was obviously striving to kill  time; he seemed to feel no weariness, but walked on and on, perhaps  suspecting that he was being followed.    \"At last, with a beating heart, though half perished with cold, and with  terribly sore feet, the detective began to realize that the tramp was  gradually working his way back towards Kensington. It was then close  upon eleven o'clock at night; once or twice the man had walked up and  down the High Street, from St. Paul's School to Derry and Toms' shops  and back again, he had looked down one or two of the side streets  and--at last--he turned into Phillimore Terrace. He seemed in no hurry,  he oven stopped once in the middle of the road, trying to light a pipe,  which, as there was a high east wind, took him some considerable time.  Then he leisurely sauntered down the street, and turned into Adam and  Eve Mews, with Mr. Francis Howard now close at his heels.    \"Acting upon the detective's instructions, there were several men in  plain clothes ready to his call in the immediate neighbourhood. Two  stood within the shadow of the steps of the Congregational Church at the  corner of the mews, others were stationed well within a soft call.    \"Hardly, therefore, had the hare turned into the _cul-de-sac_ at the  back of Phillimore Terrace than, at a slight sound from Mr. Francis  Howard, every egress was barred to him, and he was caught like a rat in  a trap.    \"As soon as the tramp had advanced some thirty yards or so (the whole  length of this part of the mews is about one hundred yards) and was lost  in the shadow, Mr. Francis Howard directed four or five of his men to  proceed cautiously up the mews, whilst the same number were to form a  line all along the front of Phillimore Terrace between the mews and the  High Street.    \"Remember, the back-garden walls threw long and dense shadows, but the  silhouette of the man would be clearly outlined if he made any attempt  at climbing over them. Mr. Howard felt quite sure that the thief was  bent on recovering the stolen goods, which, no doubt, he had hidden in  the rear of one of the houses. He would be caught _in flagrante  delicto_, and, with a heavy sentence hovering over him, he would  probably be induced to name his accomplice. Mr. Francis Howard was  thoroughly enjoying himself.    \"The minutes sped on; absolute silence, in spite of the presence of so  many men, reigned in the dark and deserted mews.    \"Of course, this night's adventure was never allowed to get into the  papers,\" added the man in the corner with his mild smile. \"Had the plan  been successful, we should have heard all about it, with a long  eulogistic article as to the astuteness of our police; but as it  was--well, the tramp sauntered up the mews--and--there he remained for  aught Mr. Francis Howard or the other constables could ever explain. The  earth or the shadows swallowed him up. No one saw him climb one of the  garden walls, no one heard him break open a door; he had retreated  within the shadow of the garden walls, and was seen or heard of no  more.\"    \"One of the servants in the Phillimore Terrace houses must have belonged  to the gang,\" said Polly with quick decision.    \"Ah, yes! but which?\" said the man in the corner, making a beautiful  knot in his bit of string. \"I can assure you that the police left not a  stone unturned once more to catch sight of that tramp whom they had had  in custody for two days, but not a trace of him could they find, nor of  the diamonds, from that day to this.\"          CHAPTER VI    ALL HE KNEW      \"The tramp was missing,\" continued the man in the corner, \"and Mr.  Francis Howard tried to find the missing tramp. Going round to the  front, and seeing the lights at No. 26 still in, he called upon Mr.  Shipman. The jeweller had had a few friends to dinner, and was giving  them whiskies-and-sodas before saying good night. The servants had just  finished washing up, and were waiting to go to bed; neither they nor Mr.  Shipman nor his guests had seen or heard anything of the suspicious  individual.    \"Mr. Francis Howard went on to see Mr. Ferdinand Knopf. This gentleman  was having his warm bath, preparatory to going to bed. So Robertson told  the detective. However, Mr. Knopf insisted on talking to Mr. Howard  through his bath-room door. Mr. Knopf thanked him for all the trouble he  was taking, and felt sure that he and Mr. Shipman would soon recover  possession of their diamonds, thanks to the persevering detective.    \"He! he! he!\" laughed the man in the corner. \"Poor Mr. Howard. He  persevered--but got no farther; no, nor anyone else, for that matter.  Even I might not be able to convict the thieves if I told all I knew to  the police.    \"Now, follow my reasoning, point by point,\" he added eagerly.    \"Who knew of the presence of the diamonds in the house of Mr. Shipman  and Mr. Knopf? Firstly,\" he said, putting up an ugly claw-like finger,  \"Mr. Shipman, then Mr. Knopf, then, presumably, the man Robertson.\"    \"And the tramp?\" said Polly.    \"Leave the tramp alone for the present since he has vanished, and take  point number two. Mr. Shipman was drugged. That was pretty obvious; no  man under ordinary circumstances would, without waking, have his keys  abstracted and then replaced at his own bedside. Mr. Howard suggested  that the thief was armed with some anaesthetic; but how did the thief  get into Mr. Shipman's room without waking him from his natural sleep?  Is it not simpler to suppose that the thief had taken the precaution to  drug the jeweller _before_ the latter went to bed?\"    \"But--\"    \"Wait a moment, and take point number three. Though there was every  proof that Mr. Shipman had been in possession of L25,000 worth of goods  since Mr. Knopf had a cheque from him for that amount, there was no  proof that in Mr. Knopf's house there was even an odd stone worth a  sovereign.    \"And then again,\" went on the scarecrow, getting more and more excited,  \"did it ever strike you, or anybody else, that at _no_ time, while the  tramp was in custody, while all that searching examination was being  gone on with, no one ever saw Mr. Knopf and his man Robertson together  at the same time?    \"Ah!\" he continued, whilst suddenly the young girl seemed to see the  whole thing as in a vision, \"they did not forget a single detail--follow  them with me, point by point. Two cunning scoundrels--geniuses they  should be called--well provided with some ill-gotten funds--but  determined on a grand _coup_. They play at respectability, for six  months, say. One is the master, the other the servant; they take a house  in the same street as their intended victim, make friends with him,  accomplish one or two creditable but very small business transactions,  always drawing on the reserve funds, which might even have amounted to a  few hundreds--and a bit of credit.    \"Then the Brazilian diamonds, and the Parisians--which, remember, were  so perfect that they required chemical testing to be detected. The  Parisian stones are sold--not in business, of course--in the evening,  after dinner and a good deal of wine. Mr. Knopf's Brazilians were  beautiful; perfect! Mr. Knopf was a well-known diamond merchant.    \"Mr. Shipman bought--but with the"]]]
