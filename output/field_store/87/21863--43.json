He turned to the girl. \"I  couldn't get the sidesaddle,\" he explained apologetically. \"I looked where  Mrs. Hawley said it was, but I couldn't find it--and I didn't have much  time. You'll have to ride a stock saddle.\"    Valeria drew back a step. \"You mean--a man's saddle?\" Her voice was  carefully polite.    \"Why, yes.\" And he added: \"The horse is dead gentle--and a sidesaddle's no  good, anyhow. You'll like this better.\" He spoke, as was evident, purely  from a man's viewpoint.    That viewpoint Mrs. Fleetwood refused to share. \"Oh, I couldn't ride a  man's saddle,\" she protested, still politely, and one could imagine how her  lips were pursed. \"Indeed, I'm not sure that I care to leave town at all.\"  To her the declaration did not seem unreasonable or abrupt but she felt  that Kent was very much shocked. She saw him turn his head and look back  toward the town, as if he half expected a pursuit.    \"I don't reckon the oats box will hold Fred very long,\" he observed  meditatively. He added reminiscently to Manley: \"I had a deuce of a time  getting the cover down and fastened.\"    \"I'm very sorry,\" said Valeria, with sweet dignity, \"that you gave yourself  so much trouble--\"    \"I'm kinda sorry myself,\" Kent agreed mildly, and Valeria blushed hotly,  and was glad he could not see.    \"Come, Val--you can ride this saddle, all right. All the girls out here--\"    \"I did not come West to imitate all the girls. Indeed, I could never think  of such a thing. I couldn't possibly--really, Manley! And, you know, it  does seem so childish of us to run away--\"    Kent moved restlessly, and felt to see if the cinch was tight.    Fleetwood took her coaxingly by the arm. \"Come, sweetheart, don't be  stubborn. You know--\"    \"Well, really! If it's a question of obstinacy--You see, I look at the  matter in this way: You believe that you are doing what is best for my  sake; I don't agree with you--and it does seem as if I should be permitted  to judge what I desire.\" Then her dignity and her sweet calm went down  before a flash of real, unpolished temper. \"You two can take those nasty  horses and ride clear to Dakota, if you want to. I'm going back to the  hotel. And I'm going to tell somebody to let that poor fellow out of that  box. I think you're acting perfectly horrid, both of you, when I don't want  to go!\" She actually started back toward the scattered points of light.    She did not, however, get so faraway that she failed to hear Kent's \"Well,  I'll be damned!\" uttered in a tone of intense disgust.    \"I don't care,\" she assured herself, because of the thrill of compunction  caused by that one forcible sentence. She had never before in her life  heard a man really swear. It affected her very much as would the accidental  touch of an electric battery. She walked on slowly, stumbling a little and  trying to hear what it was they were saying.    Then Kent passed her, loping back to the town, the led horse shaking his  saddle so that it rattled the stirrups like castanets as he galloped. \"I  don't care,\" she told herself again very emphatically, because she was  quite sure that she did care--or that she would care if only she permitted  herself to be so foolish. Manley overtook her then, and drew her hand under  his arm to lead her. But he seemed quite sullen, and would not say a word  all the way back.          CHAPTER IV. THE \"SHIVAREE\"    Kent jerked open the stable door, led in his horses, turned them into their  stalls, and removed the saddles with quick, nervous movements which told  plainly how angry he was.    \"I'll get myself all excited trying to do her a favor again--I don't  think!\" he growled in the ear of Michael, his gray gelding. \"Think of me  getting let down on my face like that! By a woman!\"    He felt along the wall in the intense darkness until his fingers touched  a lantern, took it down from the nail where it hung, and lighted it. He  carried it farther down the rude passage between the stalls, hung it high  upon another nail, and turned to the great oats box, from within which came  a vigorous thumping and the sound of muttered cursing.    Kent was not in the mood to see the humor of anything in particular. Had he  known anything about Pandora's box he might have drawn a comparison very  neatly while he stood scowling down at the oats box, for certainly he was  likely to release trouble in plenty when he unfastened that lid. He felt of  the gun swinging at his hip, just to assure himself that it was there  and ready for business in case Fred wanted to shoot, and rapped with his  knuckles upon the box, producing instant silence within.    \"Don't make so much noise in there,\" he advised grimly, \"not unless you  want the whole town to know where you are, and have 'em give you the laugh.  And, listen here: I ain't apologizing for what I done, but, all the same,  I'm sorry I did it. It wasn't any use. I'd rather be shut up in an oats box  all night than get let down like I was--and I'm telling you this so as to  start us off even. If you want to fight about it when you come out, all  right; you're the doctor. But I'm just as sorry as you are it happened.  I lay down my hand right here. I hope you shivaree Man and his wife--and  shivaree 'em good. I hope you bust the town wide open.\"    \"Why this sudden change of heart?\" came muffled from within.    \"Ah--that's my own business. Well, I don't like you a little bit, and you  know it; but I'll tell you, just to give you a fair show. I wanted to keep  Man sober, and I tried to get him and his wife out of town before that  shivaree of yours was pulled off. But the lady wouldn't have it that way.  I got let right down on my face, and I'm done. Now you know just where I  stand. Maybe I'm a fool for telling you, but I seem to be in the business  to-night. Come on out.\"    He unfastened the big iron hasp, which was showing signs of the strain put  upon it, and stepped back watchfully. The thick, oaken lid was pushed up,  and Fred De Garmo, rather dusty and disheveled and purple from the  close atmosphere of the box and from anger as well, came up like a  jack-in-the-box and glared at Kent. When he had stepped out upon the stable  floor, however, he smiled rather unpleasantly.    [Illustration: He was jeered unmercifully by Fred De Garmo and his crowd]    \"If you've told the truth,\" he said maliciously, \"I guess the lady has  pretty near evened things up. If you haven't--if I don't find them both at  the hotel--well--Anyway,\" he added, with an ominous inflection, \"there'll  be other days to settle this in!\"    \"Why, sure. Help yourself, Fred,\" Kent retorted cheerfully, and stood where  he was until Fred had gone out. Then he turned and closed the box. \"Between  that yellow-eyed dame and the chump that went and left this box wide open  for me to tip Fred into,\" he soliloquized, while he took down the lantern,  and so sent the shadows dancing weirdly about him, \"I've got a bunch of  trouble mixed up, for fair. I wish the son of a gun would fight it out now,  and be done with it; but no, that ain't Fred. He'd a heap rather wait and  let it draw interest!\"    Over in the hotel the \"yellow-eyed dame\" was doing her unsophisticated best  to meet the situation gracefully, and to realize certain vague and rather  romantic dreams of her life out West. She meant to be very gracious, for  one thing, and to win the chivalrous friendship of every man who came to  participate in the rude congratulations that had been planned. Just how  she meant to do this she did not know--except that the graciousness would  certainly prove a very important factor.    \"I'm going to remain downstairs,\" she told Manley, when they reached the  hotel. It was the first sentence she had spoken since he overtook her. \"I'm  so glad, dear,\" she added diplomatically, \"that you decided to stay. I want  to see that funny landlady now, please, and get her to serve coffee and  cake to our guests in the parlor. I wish I might have had one of my trunks  brought over here; I should like to wear a pretty gown.\" She glanced down  at her tailored suit with true feminine dissatisfaction. \"But everything  was so--so confused, with your being late, and sick--is your head better,  dear?\"    Manley, in very few words, assured her that it was. Manley was struggling  with his inner self, trying to answer one very important question, and to  answer it truthfully: Could he meet \"the boys,\" do his part among them, and  still remain sober? That seemed to be the only course open to him now, and  he knew himself just well enough to doubt his own strength. But if Kent  would help him--He felt an immediate necessity to find Kent.    \"You'll find Mrs. Hawley somewhere around,\" he said hurriedly. \"I've got to  see Kent--\"    \"Oh, Manley! Don't have anything to do with that horrid cowboy! He's  not--nice. He--he swore, when he must have known I could hear him; and he  was swearing about _me_, Manley. Didn't you hear him?\" She stood in the  doorway and clung to his arm.    \"No,\" lied Manley. \"You must have been mistaken, sweetheart.\"    \"Oh, I wasn't; I heard him quite plainly.\" She must have thought it a  terrible thing, for she almost whispered the last words, and she released  him with much reluctance. It seemed to her that Manley was in danger of  falling among low associates, and that she must protect him in spite of  himself. It failed to occur to her that Manley had been exposed to that  danger for three years, without any protection whatever.    She was thankful, when he came to her later in the parlor, to learn from  him that he had not held any speech with Kent. That was some comfort--and  she felt that she needed a little comforting, just then. Her consultation  with Arline had been rather unsatisfactory. Arline had told her bluntly  that \"the bunch\" didn't want any coffee and cake. Whisky and cigars, said  Arline, without so much as a blush, was what appealed to them "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8547"],[0,"Pirke Avot: The Sayings of the Jewish Fathers (#6)"],[1,"to thee do not do unto thy fellow        man; this is the whole _Torah_, the rest is mere commentary.\"        See Bacher, _Agada der Tanaiten_; Schurer, _History_, I, ii,        p. 359 _et seq._; Myers, _story of the Jewish People_, I, p.        136 _et seq._; geiger, _Judaism and its History_, p. 113 _et        seq._          (30) Psalm XXIV, 15: \"Seek peace and pursue it.\"          (31) Draw men to the _Torah_ by good example, not by        endeavoring to make converts.          (32) He who seeks a name loses fame.          (33) Be self-reliant, but not selfish.    15. Shammai said, \"Set a fixed time for thy (study of) _Torah;_ say  little and do much (34); and receive all men with a cheerful  countenance.\"          (34) Or \"promise little.\"  Be like Abraham, who promised only        bread, but brought a \"calf tender and good\" (Genesis XVIII, 5        and 7).    16. Rabban (35) Gamaliel said, \"Provide thyself with a teacher; be  quit of doubt (36); and accustom not thyself to give tithes (37) by a  conjectural estimate.\"          (35) \"Our teacher,\" \"our master,\" a title given only to the        presidents of the _Sanhendrin_, Gamaliel being the first to be        thus known.  Gamaliel was a grandson of Hillel and a teacher        of Paul.  See Strack, _Einleitung_, p. 85.          (36) Establish over you the authority of a teacher, to hold        you from the clutch of doubt (Kohut).          (37) There were three kinds of tithes (the tenth part of        anything): (a) \"the first tithe\" (_maaser rishon), given to        the Lebites; \"the second tithe\" (_maaser sheni_), taken to        Jerusalem and consumed there by the owner and his family; and        (c) the tithe paid to the poor (_maaser ani_).  See Leviticus        XXVII, 30 _et seq._, Numbers XVIII, 21-24, and Deuteronomy        XIV, 22-29; also _Tractates Maasrot_ and _Maaser Sheni_ of the        _Mishnah_.  Consult Babbs, _The Law of Tithes_.    17. Simeon (38) his son, said, \"All my days I have grown up amongst  the wise, and I have found nothing better for man than silence (39);  not learning but doing is the chief thing (40); and whoso multiplies  words causes sin\" (41).          (38) Simeon beg Gamaliel I lived at the time of the war with        Rome.  See Josephus, _Jewish Wars_, IV, 3, 9.          (39) Cf. chapter III, 17.          (40) Where words fail, deeds tell.  _Non scholae sed vitae_.          (41) Cf. Proverbs X, 19.    18. Rabban Simeon, the son of Gamaliel (42) said, \"By three things is  the world preserved (43); by truth, by judgment, and by peace, as it  is said, 'Judge ye the truth and the judgment of peace in your gates'\"  (44).

(43) Cf. chapter I, 2.  _Torah_, Temple service, and        benevolence are the foundations and, at the same time, the        aims of the world.  Truth, judgment, and peace maintain the        world's permanency.          (44) Zechariah VIII, 16.    Rabbi Chanania (45), the son of Akashia, said, \"The Holy One, blessed  be He, was pleased to make Israel worthy; wherefore He gave them a  copious _Torah_ and many commandments, as it is said, 'It pleased the  Lord, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the _Torah_ and make it  honorable'\" (46).          (45) This saying did not belong originally to _Abot_, but was        taken from _Makkot_, III, 16.  According to Goldschmidt, it        was introduced into the _Mishnah_ from the separate editions,        and then found its way into the Talmudical texts of _Abot_.        This verse is recited at the end of each chapter.  See Rawicz,        _Commentor des Maimonides_, p. 114, n. 1.          (46) Isaiah, xlii, 21.              CHAPTER II    All Israel have a portion in the world to come, and it is said, \"And  thy people shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for  ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be  glorified\".    1. Rabbi (1) said, \"which is the right course that a man should choose  for himself? (2)  That which is a pride to him who pursues it and  which also brings him honor from mankind.  Be as scrupulous about a  light precept as about a grave one, for thou knowest not the grant of  reward for each precept.  Reckon the loss incurred by the fulfilment  of a precept against the reward secured by its observance (3), and the  gain gotten by a transgression against the loss it involves.  Consider  three things, that thou mayest not come within the power of sin (4).  Know what is above thee--a seeing eye, and a hearing ear, and all thy  deeds written in a book\" (5).          (1) Rabbi Judah (135-220 C.E.), son of Simeon (chapter I, 18),        was known as \"Rabbi,\" as a mark of distinction, owing to the        fact that he was the chief reviser and compiler of the        _Mishnah_.  Earlier compilers of the _Mishnah_ had been        Hillel, Akiba, and R. Meir.  Rabbi Judah was also known as        _Rabbenu_ (our Master), _ha-Nasi_ (the Prince), and        _ha-Kodesh_ (the Holy).  He is said to have died[*] on the day        that Akiba met his death at the hands of the Romans.  See        Danziger, _Jewish Forerunners of Christianity_, pp. 242-274,        Myers, _Story of the Jewish People_, I, 210-222, and Strack,        _Einleitung in den Talmud_, p. 96.  [* a prior owner of the        source text annotated it by crossing out \"died\" and writing in        \"been born\".]          (2) Maimonides interprets this verse as meaning to pursue a        medium course between two equally bad extremes, the _too much_        and the _too little_.  On this subject, see his celebrated        fourth chapter of the _Shemonah Perakim_ (_The Eight        Chapters_) on the \"mean\"; ed. Gorfinkle, p. 54, _et seq._          (3) _I.e._, the loss in this world as against the reward in        the future world.  On the Rabbinic idea of reward and        punishment, see Schechter, _Aspects_, pp. 162-163, and        Herford, _Pharisaism_, p. 267 _et seq._          (4) Cf. chapter III, 1.  No deeds, great or small, are lost        sight of by God.          (5) On the divine books or book, see Exodus XXXII, 35.        Malachi III, 16, and Daniel VII, 10, etc.  The heavenly \"Book        of Life\" is prominently mentioned in the ritual of the New        Year and the Day of Atonement, especially in the celebrated        prayer, _U-netanneh Tokef_ of Rabbi Amnon of Mayence.  The New        Year's greeting, \"May you be inscribed for a happy year!\" is        evidence of the popularity of the idea of a divine book in        which the fate of a man is written.  See the _Jewish        Encyclopedia_, art. _Book of Life_.    2. Rabban Gamaliel, the son of Rabbi Judah, the Prince, said,  \"Excellent is the study of _Torah_ combined with some worldly pursuit  (6), for the effort demanded by them both makes sin to be forgotten.  All study of _Torah_ without work must at length be futile, and leads  to sin (7).  Let all who are employed with the congregation act with  them for Heaven's sake, for then the merit of their fathers sustains  them, and their righteousness endures for ever (8).  And as for you  (God will then say), 'I account you worthy of great reward, as if you  had wrought it all yourselves.'  3. Be on your guard against the  ruling power (9); for they who exercise it draw no man near to them  except for their own interests; appearing as friends when it is to  their own advantage, they stand not by a man in the hour of his need.\"   4. He used to say, \"Do His will as if it were thy will.  Nullify thy  will before His will, that He may nullify the will of others before  thy will.\"          (6) The expression _Talmud Torah_ (lit., \"study of the Law\")        means the study of all sacred learning.  The word _Torah_,        here, is to be construed in its broadest sense.  See chapter        I, n. 4.  Such study was one of the duties to which no limit        was fixed (_Peah_ I, 1).  The expression [derech eretz] means        \"good manners\" (chapter III, 21), or \"worldly business,\" or        \"care\" (chapter III, 6), according to the context.  Study        combined with some trade or profession is, according to R.        Gamaliel, the proper thing.  See chapter IV, n. 24.          (7) Cf. _Kiddushin_, 29a, \"He who does not teach his son a        trade teaches him to be a thief.\"          (8) In every community, the work and goodness of past        generations live in the present, and the good that the        community does in the present will live on in the future.  On        the \"merit of the fathers\" ([z'chut avot]), see Schechter,        _Some Aspects of Rabbinic Theology_, chapter XII, especially        pp. 175-177, where this passage is quoted.          (9) This verse is directed toward the leaders of the        community.  Cf. above, chapter I, 10.    5. Hillel (10) said, \"Separate not thyself from the congregation (11);  trust not in thyself until the day of thy death (12); judge not thy  neighbor until thou art come into his place; and say not anything  which cannot be understood at once, in the hope that it will be  understood in the end (13); neither say, 'When I have leisure I will  study'; perchance thou wilt have no leisure.\"  6. He used to say, \"An  empty-headed man cannot be a sin-fearing man, nor can an ignorant  person (14) be pious, nor can a shamefaced man (15) learn, nor a  passionate man (16) teach, nor can one who is engaged overmuch in  business grow wise (17).  In a place where there are no men, strive to  be a man\" (18).  7. Moreover, he once saw a skull floating on the  surface of the water.  He said to it, \"Because thou didst drown  (others) they have drowned thee, and at the last they that drowned  thee shall themselves be drowned\" (19).  8. He used to say, \"The more  flesh, the more works; the more property, the more anxiety; the more  women, the more witchcraft; the more maid-servants, the more lewdness;  "]]]
