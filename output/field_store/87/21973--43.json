That you're a grandson you    As long as you're alive shall rue.\"                               _Faust_ (translation by Sir T. Martin).    Thus, no absolute rights can be laid down even for men who share the  same ideas in their private and social intercourse. The conception of  the constitutional State in the strictest sense is an impossibility, and  would lead to an intolerable state of things. The hard and fast  principle must be modified by the progressive development of the fixed  law, as well as by the ever-necessary application of mercy and of  self-help allowed by the community. If sometimes between individuals the  duel alone meets the sense of justice, how much more impossible must a  universal international law be in the wide-reaching and complicated  relations between nations and States! Each nation evolves its own  conception of right, each has its particular ideals and aims, which  spring with a certain inevitableness from its character and historical  life. These various views bear in themselves their living justification,  and may well be diametrically opposed to those of other nations, and  none can say that one nation has a better right than the other. There  never have been, and never will be, universal rights of men. Here and  there particular relations can be brought under definite international  laws, but the bulk of national life is absolutely outside codification.  Even were some such attempt made, even if a comprehensive international  code were drawn up, no self-respecting nation would sacrifice its own  conception of right to it. By so doing it would renounce its highest  ideals; it would allow its own sense of justice to be violated by an  injustice, and thus dishonour itself.    Arbitration treaties must be peculiarly detrimental to an aspiring  people, which has not yet reached its political and national zenith, and  is bent on expanding its power in order to play its part honourably in  the civilized world. Every Arbitration Court must originate in a certain  political status; it must regard this as legally constituted, and must  treat any alterations, however necessary, to which the whole of the  contracting parties do not agree, as an encroachment. In this way every  progressive change is arrested, and a legal position created which may  easily conflict with the actual turn of affairs, and may check the  expansion of the young and vigorous State in favour of one which is  sinking in the scale of civilization.    These considerations supply the answer to the second decisive question:  How can the judgment of the Arbitration Court be enforced if any State  refuses to submit to it? Where does the power reside which insures the  execution of this judgment when pronounced?    In America, Elihu Root, formerly Secretary of State, declared in 1908  that the High Court of International Justice established by the second  Hague Conference would be able to pronounce definite and binding  decisions by virtue of the pressure brought to bear by public opinion.  The present leaders of the American peace movement seem to share this  idea. With a childlike self-consciousness, they appear to believe that  public opinion must represent the view which the American plutocrats  think most profitable to themselves. They have no notion that the  widening development of mankind has quite other concerns than material  prosperity, commerce, and money-making. As a matter of fact, public  opinion would be far from unanimous, and real compulsion could only be  employed by means of war--the very thing which is to be avoided.    We can imagine a Court of Arbitration intervening in the quarrels of the  separate tributary countries when an empire like the Roman Empire  existed. Such an empire never can or will arise again. Even if it did,  it would assuredly, like a universal peace league, be disastrous to all  human progress, which is dependent on the clashing interests and the  unchecked rivalry of different groups.    So long as we live under such a State system as at present, the German  Imperial Chancellor certainly hit the nail on the head when he declared,  in his speech in the Reichstag on March 30, 1911, that treaties for  arbitration between nations must be limited to clearly ascertainable  legal issues, and that a general arbitration treaty between two  countries afforded no guarantee of permanent peace. Such a treaty merely  proved that between the two contracting States no serious inducement to  break the peace could be imagined. It therefore only confirmed the  relations already existing. \"If these relations change, if differences  develop between the two nations which affect their national existence,  which, to use a homely phrase, cut them to the quick, then every  arbitration treaty will burn like tinder and end in smoke.\"    It must be borne in mind that a peaceful decision by an Arbitration  Court can never replace in its effects and consequences a warlike  decision, even as regards the State in whose favour it is pronounced. If  we imagine, for example, that Silesia had fallen to Frederick the Great  by the finding of a Court of Arbitration, and not by a war of  unparalleled heroism, would the winning of this province have been  equally important for Prussia and for Germany? No one will maintain this.    The material increase in power which accrued to Frederick's country by  the acquisition of Silesia is not to be underestimated. But far more  important was the circumstance that this country could not be conquered  by the strongest European coalition, and that it vindicated its position  as the home of unfettered intellectual and religious development. It was  war which laid the foundations of Prussia's power, which amassed a  heritage of glory and honour that can never be again disputed. War  forged that Prussia, hard as steel, on which the New Germany could grow  up as a mighty European State and a World Power of the future. Here once  more war showed its creative power, and if we learn the lessons of  history we shall see the same result again and again.    If we sum up our arguments, we shall see that, from the most opposite  aspects, the efforts directed towards the abolition of war must not only  be termed foolish, but absolutely immoral, and must be stigmatized as  unworthy of the human race. To what does the whole question amount? It  is proposed to deprive men of the right and the possibility to sacrifice  their highest material possessions, their physical life, for ideals, and  thus to realize the highest moral unselfishness. It is proposed to  obviate the great quarrels between nations and States by Courts of  Arbitration--that is, by arrangements. A one-sided, restricted, formal  law is to be established in the place of the decisions of history. The  weak nation is to have the same right to live as the powerful and  vigorous nation. The whole idea represents a presumptuous encroachment  on the natural laws of development, which can only lead to the most  disastrous consequences for humanity generally.    With the cessation of the unrestricted competition, whose ultimate  appeal is to arms, all real progress would soon be checked, and a moral  and intellectual stagnation would ensue which must end in degeneration.  So, too, when men lose the capacity of gladly sacrificing the highest  material blessings--life, health, property, and comfort--for ideals; for  the maintenance of national character and political independence; for  the expansion of sovereignty and territory in the interests of the  national welfare; for a definite influence in the concert of nations  according to the scale of their importance in civilization; for  intellectual freedom from dogmatic and political compulsion; for the  honour of the flag as typical of their own worth--then progressive  development is broken off, decadence is inevitable, and ruin at home and  abroad is only a question of time. History speaks with no uncertain  voice on this subject. It shows that valour is a necessary condition of  progress. Where with growing civilization and increasing material  prosperity war ceases, military efficiency diminishes, and the  resolution to maintain independence under all circumstances fails, there  the nations are approaching their downfall, and cannot hold their own  politically or racially.    \"A people can only hope to take up a firm position in the political  world when national character and military tradition act and react upon  each.\" These are the words of Clausewitz, the great philosopher of war,  and he is incontestably right.    These efforts for peace would, if they attained their goal, not merely  lead to general degeneration, as happens everywhere in Nature where the  struggle for existence is eliminated, but they have a direct damaging  and unnerving effect. The apostles of peace draw large sections of a  nation into the spell of their Utopian efforts, and they thus introduce  an element of weakness into the national life; they cripple the  justifiable national pride in independence, and support a nerveless  opportunist policy by surrounding it with the glamour of a higher  humanity, and by offering it specious reasons for disguising its own  weakness. They thus play the game of their less scrupulous enemies, just  as the Prussian policy, steeped in the ideas of universal peace, did in  1805 and 1806, and brought the State to the brink of destruction.    The functions of true humanity are twofold. On the one hand there is the  promotion of the intellectual, moral, and military forces, as well as  of political power, as the surest guarantee for the uniform development  of character; on the other hand there is the practical realization of  ideals, according to the law of love, in the life of the individual and  of the community.    It seems to me reasonable to compare the efforts directed towards the  suppression of war with those of the Social Democratic Labour party,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11365"],[0,"The Fern Lover's Companion (#7)"],[1,"erect.

A. ebeneum_    Fronds upright, eight to eighteen inches high, linear-lanceolate, the  fertile ones much taller, and pinnate. Pinnae scarcely an inch long, the  lower ones very much shorter, alternate, spreading, finely serrate or  incised, the base auricled. Sori numerous, rather near the midvein, stipe  and rachis lustrous brown. (\"Ebony.\")    This rigidly upright but graceful fern flourishes in rocky, open woods, and  on rich, moist banks, often in the neighborhood of red cedars. Having come  upon it many times in our rambles, we should say it was not uncommon.    A lightly incised form of the pinnae has been described as var. _serratum_.  A handsome form discovered in Vermont in 1900 by Mrs. Horton and named  _Hortonae_ (also called _incisum_) has plume-like fronds with the pinnae cut  into oblique lobes, which are coarsely serrate.

From Mt. Toby, Mass., and Willoughby  Mountain, Vt., to Michigan, Missouri, Kentucky and southward.      B. THE LARGE SPLEENWORTS. _Athyrium_    The following species, which are often two to three feet high and grow in  rich soil, are quite different in appearance and habits from the small rock  spleenworts just described. Some botanists have kept them in the genus  _Asplenium_ because their sori are usually rather straight or only slightly  curved, but others are inclined to follow the practice of the British  botanists and put them into a separate group under _Athyrium_. Nearly all  agree that the lady fern, with its variously curved sori, should be placed  here, and many others would place the silvery spleenwort in the same genus,  partly because of its frequently doubled sori. In regard to the last member  of the group, the narrow-leaved spleenwort, there is more doubt. The sori  taken separately would place it with the _Aspleniums_, but considering its  size, structure, habits of growth and all, it seems more closely allied to  the two larger ferns than to the little rock species. We shall group the  three together as the large spleenworts, or for the sake of being more  definite adopt Clute's felicitous phrase.          THE LADY FERN AND ITS KIN      1. THE LADY FERNS    Fronds one to three feet high, broadly lanceolate, or ovate-oblong,  tapering towards the apex, bipinnate. Pinnae lanceolate, numerous. Pinnules  oblong-lanceolate, cut-toothed or incised. Fruit-dots short, variously  curved. Indusium delicate, often reniform, or shaped like a horseshoe, in  some forms confluent at maturity.    Widely distributed, common and varying greatly in outline. The newer  nomenclature separates the lady fern of our section into two distinct  species, which should be carefully studied.[A]    [Footnote A: See monograph by F.K. Butters in _Rhodora_ of September,  1917.]    (1) THE UPLAND LADY FERN. ATHYRIUM ANGUSTUM    _Asplenium Filix-femina_    The rootstock or rhizome of the Upland Lady Fern here pictured shows how  the thick, fleshy bases of the old fronds conceal the rootstock itself. In  the Lowland Lady Fern the rootstock is but slightly concealed by old stipe  bases, and so may be distinguished from its sister fern.    One design of such rootstocks is to store up food (mostly starch), during  the summer to nourish the young plants as they shoot forth the next spring.  The undecayed bases of the old stipes are also packed with starch for the  same purpose.    [Illustration: Rootstock of the Upland Lady Fern]    [Illustration: The same split lengthwise (From Waters's \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt  & Co.)]    [Illustration: Sori of Lady Fern. _Athyrium angustum_]    Rootstocks horizontal, quite concealed by the thick, fleshy bases of old  fronds. Scales of the long, tufted stipes dark brown. Indusium curved,  often horseshoe-shaped, usually toothed or fringed with fine hairs, but  without glands. Fronds bipinnate, one to three feet high, widest near the  middle.    This is the common species of northern New England and the Canadian  Provinces. The fronds differ very widely in form and a great many varieties  have been pointed out, but the fern student, having first learned to  identify the species, will gradually master the few leading varieties as he  meets them.    Those growing in warm, sunny places where the fruit-dots when mature  incline to cover the whole back of the frond are called \"sun forms.\" These  are varieties TYPICUM and ELATIUS, both with the pinnae obliquely ascending  (including variety _angustum_ of D.C. Eaton), but the latter has broader  fronds with the pinnules of the sterile fronds oblong-lanceolate, somewhat  acute and strongly toothed or pinnatifid.    [Illustration: Varieties of Lady Fern Left to right--1st and 2nd, Var.  _typicum; 3d, elatius; 4th, rubellum; 5th, uncertain, perhaps confertum_]    Var. RUBELLUM has the sori distinct even when mature; its pinnules stand  at a wide angle from the rachis of the pinna and are strongly toothed  or pinnatifid with obtuse teeth. This variety favors regions with cool  summers, or dense shade in warmer regions. The term RUBELLUM alludes to  the reddish stems so often seen but this sign alone may not determine the  variety. It occurs throughout the range of the species, being a common  New England fern. Fernald remarks that this is also a common form of the  species in southern Nova Scotia.    Among other varieties named by Butters are CONFERTUM, having the pinnules  irregularly lobed and toothed; joined by a membranous wing, the lobes of  the pinnules broad and overlapping, giving the fern a compact appearance;  LACINIATUM with pinnules very irregular in size and shape, with many long,  acute teeth, which project in various directions. \"An abnormal form which  looks as if it had been nibbled when young.\"    These varieties are represented in the Gray Herbarium.    (2) THE LOWLAND LADY FERN    ATHYRIUM ASPLENIOIDES    Rootstocks creeping, not densely covered with the persistent bases of the  fronds. Stipes about as long as the blade. Scales of the stipe very few,  seldom persistent, rarely over 3-16 of an inch long. Fronds narrowly  deltoid, lanceolate, widest near the base, the second pair of pinnae  commonly longest. Indusia ciliate, the cilia (hairs) ending in glands.  Spores dark, netted or wrinkled.    [Illustration: Lowland Lady Fern. ATHYRIUM ASPLENIOIDES (From the Gray  Herbarium)]    The following two forms are named by Butters:    F. TYPICUM. The usual form frequent in eastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island,  Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio, and Missouri.    F. SUBTRIPINNATUM. An unusually large and rare form with triangular,  lanceolate, and pinnatifid pinnules, having blunt, oblong segments. Wet  situations in half shade. Massachusetts, West Virginia, and Virginia.    Our lowland or southern lady fern flourishes in the southern states, comes  up the Atlantic Coast until it meets the upland or northern species in  Pennsylvania and southern New England, and their identification can hardly  fail to awaken in the student a keen interest.    Our American botanists are inclined to think that the real _Athyrium  filix-femina_ is not to be found in the northeastern United States, but  is rather a western species, with its habitat in California and the Rocky  Mountain region and identical with _Athyrium cyclosorum_.    But whatever changes may occur in the scientific name of the old _Athyrium  filix-femina_"]]]
