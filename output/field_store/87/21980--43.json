The  simple question for consideration would be, whether the conduct and  principles of the insect species have undergone such a material change  as to entitle them to new and extraordinary enactments in their favour?  Have they entirely divested themselves of their licentious and predatory  habits, and learnt now for the first time to distinguish between right  and wrong? Do they understand what it is to commit sacrilege? To intrude  into the sanctum sanctorum of the meat-safe? To rifle and defile the  half roseate, half lily-white charms of a virgin ham? To touch with  unhallowed proboscis the immaculate lip of beauty, the unprotected scalp  of old age, the savoury glories of the kitchen? To invade with the most  reckless indifference, and the most wanton malice, the siesta of the  alderman or the philosopher? To this we answer in the eloquent and  emphatic language of the late Mr. Canning--_No_! Unamiable and  unconciliating monsters! The wildest and most ferocious inhabitants of  the desert may be reclaimed from their savage nature, and taught to  become the peaceful denizens of a menagerie--but ye are altogether  untractable and untameable. Gratitude and sense of shame, the better  parts of instinct, have never yet interposed their sacred influence to  prevent the commission of one treacherous or unbecoming action of yours.  The holy rites of hospitality are by you abused and set at naught; and  the very roof which shelters you is desecrated with the marks of your  irreverential contempt for all things human and divine. Would that--(and  the wish is expressed more in sorrow than in anger)--would that your  entire species were condensed into one enormous bluebottle, that we  might crush you all at a single swoop!    Many, calling themselves philanthropists and Christians, have omitted to  squash a fly when they had an opportunity of so doing; nay, some of  these people have even been known to go the length of writing verses on  the occasion, in which they applaud themselves for their own humane  disposition, and congratulate the object of their mistaken mercy on its  narrow escape from impending fate. There is nothing more wanting than to  propose the establishment of a Royal Humane Society for the  resuscitation of flies apparently drowned or suffocated. Can it possibly  be imagined by the man who has succeeded after infinite pains in  rescuing a greedy and intrusive insect from a gin-and-watery grave in  his own vile potations, that he has thereby consulted the happiness of  his fellow creatures, or promoted the cause of decency, cleanliness,  good order, and domestic comfort? Let him watch the career of the  mischievous little demon which he has thus been the means of restoring  to the world, when he might have arrested its progress for ever. Observe  the stout and respectable gentleman, loved, honoured, and esteemed in  all the various relations of father, husband, friend, citizen, and  Christian, who is on cushioned sofa composing himself for his wonted  nap, after a dinner in substance and quantity of the most satisfactory  description, and not untempered by a modicum of old port. His amiable  partner, with that refined delicacy and sense of decorum peculiar to the  female sex, has already withdrawn with her infant progeny, leaving her  good man, as she fondly imagines, to enjoy the sweets of uninterrupted  repose. At one moment we behold him slumbering softly as an infant--\"so  tranquil, helpless, stirless, and unmoved;\" in the next, we remark with  surprise sundry violent twitches and contortions of the limbs, as though  the sleeper were under the operation of galvanism, or suffering from the  pangs of a guilty conscience. Of what hidden crime does the memory thus  agitate him--breaking in upon that rest which should steep the senses in  forgetfulness of the world and its cares? On a sudden he starts from his  couch with an appearance of frenzy!--his nostrils dilated, his eyes  gleaming with immoderate excitation--an incipient curse quivering on his  lips, and every vein swelling--every muscle tense with fearful and  passionate energy of purpose. Is he possessed with a devil, or does he  meditate suicide, that his manner is so wild and hurried? With impetuous  velocity he rushes to the window, and beneath his vehement but futile  strokes, aimed at a scarcely visible, and certainly impalpable object,  the fragile glass flies into fragments, the source of future colds and  curtain lectures without number. The immediate author of so much  mischief, it is true, is the diminutive vampire which is now making its  escape with cold-blooded indifference through a very considerable  fracture in one of the panes; but surely the person who saved from  destruction, and may thus be considered to have given existence to the  cause of all this loss of temper and of property, cannot conscientiously  affirm that _his_ withers are unwrung! Mercy and forbearance are very  great virtues when exercised with proper discretion; but man owes a  paramount duty to society, with which none of the weaknesses, however  amiable, of his nature should be allowed to interfere. It is no mercy to  pardon and let loose upon the community one who, having already been  convicted of manifold delinquencies, only waits a convenient season for  adding to the catalogue of his crimes; and what is larceny, or felony,  or even treason, compared with the perpetration of the outrages above  attempted to be described?--We pause for a reply.    Summer is a most delectable--a most glorious season. We, who are fond of  basking as a lizard, and whose inward spirit dances and exults like a  very mote in the sun-beam, always hail its approach with rapture; but  our anticipations of bright and serene days--of blue, cloudless, and  transparent skies--of shadows the deeper from intensity of surrounding  light--of yellow corn-fields, listless rambles, and lassitude rejoicing  in green and sunny banks--are allayed by this one consideration, that      Waked by the summer ray, the reptile young    Come winged abroad. From every chink    And secret corner, where they slept away    The wintry storms; by myriads forth at once,    Swarming they pour.    Go where you will, it is not possible to escape these \"winged reptiles.\"  They abound exceedingly in all sunny spots; nor in the shady lane do  they not haunt every bush, and lie perdu under every leaf, thence  sallying forth on the luckless wight who presumes to molest their  \"solitary reign;\" they hang with deliberate importunity over the path of  the sauntering pedestrian, and fly with the flying horseman, like the  black cares (that is to say, blue devils) described by the Roman lyrist.  Within doors they infest, harpy-like, the dinner-table--      Diripiuntque dapes, contactuque omnia foedant    Immundo--    and hover in impending clouds over the sugar basin at tea; in the pantry  it is buz; in the dairy it is buz; in the kitchen it is buz; one loud,  long-continued, and monotonous buz! Having little other occupation than  that of propagating their species, the natural consequence, as we may  learn from Mr. Malthus, is that their numbers increase in a frightfully  progressive ratio from year to year; and it has at length become  absolutely necessary that some decisive measures should be adopted to  counteract the growing evil.    Upon the whole, he would not, perhaps, be considered to speak rashly or  unadvisedly, who should affirm, that no earthly creature, of the same  insignificant character and pretensions, is the agent of nearly so much  mischief as the fly.--What a blessed order of things would immediately  ensue, if every one of them was to be entirely swept away from the face  of the earth! This most wished-for event, we fear, it will never be our  lot to witness; but it may be permitted to a sincere patriot, in his  benevolent and enthusiastic zeal for the well-being of his country, to  indulge in aspirations that are tinged with a shade of extravagance.  With respect, however, to the above mentioned vermin, the idea of their  total annihilation may not be altogether chimerical. We know that the  extirpation of wolves from England was accomplished by the commutation  of an annual tribute for a certain number of their heads; and it is well  worth the consideration of the legislature, whether, by adopting a  somewhat similar principle, they may not rid the British dominions of an  equally great and crying nuisance. The noble Duke, now at the head of  his Majesty's Government, has it in his power to add another ray to his  illustrious name, to secure the approbation and gratitude of all classes  of the community, and to render his ministry for ever memorable, by the  accomplishment of so desirable an object. In the mean time, let the  Society of Arts offer their next large gold medal to the person who  shall invent the most ingenious and destructive fly-trap. A certain  quantity of quassia might be distributed gratis at Apothecaries' Hall,  as vaccinatory matter is at the Cow-pox Hospital, with very considerable  effect; and an act of parliament should be passed without delay,  declaring the wilful destruction of a spider to be felony.--_Blackwood's  Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      THE CORONATION OF INEZ DE CASTRO.[7]    BY MRS.

There was music on the midnight;      From a royal fane it roll'd,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11414"],[0,"In the Claws of the German Eagle (#7)"],[1,"have forever burned themselves into my brain, a pitiful  protest against a mad, wild world at war.    Sleep was entirely out of the question with me. It wasn't the bad air  or the hard floor or the snores of my comrades, but just plain cold  fear. Now I possess an average amount of courage. Quite alone I  walked in and out of Liege when the Germans were painting the  skies red with the burning towns. My ribs were massaged all the  way by ends of revolvers, whose owners demanded me to give  forthwith my reasons for being there, they being sole arbiters of  whether my reasons were good or bad. I got so used to a bayonet  pointing into the pit of my stomach that it hardly looks natural in a  vertical position.    But this was a thrust from a different quarter. In the open a man  feels a sporting chance, at any rate, even if a bullet can beat him  on the run; but cooped up within four walls he is paralyzed by his  horrible helplessness. He feels that a military court reverses  ordinary procedure, holding that it is better for nine innocent to  suffer than for one guilty one to escape. He knows that his fate is  in the hands of a tribunal from whose arbitrary decision there is no  appeal, and that decision he knows may depend upon the whim of  the commandant, to whom a poor breakfast or a bad night's sleep  may give the wrong twist. The terrible uncertainty of it preys upon  one's mind.    I certainly prayed that the commandant was getting a better night  than mine, as I lay there staring up at the electric light with a  hundred hates and fears pounding through my brain. \"I'm a  prisoner,\" was one thought. \"Supposing the silence of the guns  means that the Germans, beaten, are being pressed back into  Brussels by the Allies. They may let us go. No, the Germans,  maddened by defeat, might order us all to be shot,\" was one idea.  \"How does it feel to be blindfolded and stood up against a wall by a  firing squad?\" was another pleasant companion idea that kept vigil  with me through the midnight hours. Then my fancies took a  frenzied turn, \"Suppose these be brutes of soldiers and they run  us through, saying we were trying to escape.\"    \"Escape!\" The word no sooner leaped into my mind than an  almost uncontrollable impulse to escape seized me, or at least I  thought one had. I got upon my feet, observing that the two  soldiers lying beside me on the floor were fast asleep and the  guards at the outer door were nodding. I stepped over their  sleeping forms arid made a reconnoiter of the hallway. There in the  semi-darkness stood seven soldiers of the Kaiser with their seven  guns and their seven glistening bayonets.    Cold steel is not supposed to act as a soothing syrup; but one  glance at those bayonets and my uncontrollable impulse utterly  vanished. You will observe that the bayonet is continually cropping  up in my story. It does, indeed. A bayonet looks far different from  what it did on dress parade. Meet one in war, and its true  significance first dawns upon you. It is not simply a decoration at  the end of a rifle, but it is made to stick in a man's stomach and  then be turned round; and when you realize that this particular one  is made to stick in your particular stomach, it takes on a still  different aspect.    I crawled back into my lair, resolved to seek for deliverance by  mental means, rather than by physical; and as the first rays of light  stole through the window I composed the following document to  His Excellency:      The Officer who has the case of the American, Albert B. Williams,  under supervision: SIR:    As you seem willing to be fair in hearing my case, may I take the  liberty this morning of addressing you upon my charge? I fear that  I made but a feeble defense of myself yesterday; but when I was  accused of offering much money for information relative to the  movements of German troops, the accusation came so suddenly  that I could only deny it. May I now offer a few observations upon  this charge, the nature of which just begins to become clear to  me?    In the first place, it was a sheer impossibility for me to offer \"much  money,\" because all I had was that which, as Mr. Van Hee knows,  Mr. Fletcher gave me when I was left behind.    In the second place, were I a spy, I certainly would not be offering  money in a voice loud enough to be heard by the several  witnesses that you have ready to testify.    In the third place, while not attempting to impeach the character of  my accuser, may I submit the fact that my own standing will be  vouched for by His Excellency the Governor of Massachusetts, the  President of the Pilgrim Amalgamated Associated Advertising  Clubs of America, the chief Rabbi in the Rabbinate of New  England, etc., etc.    These men will attest the utter absurdity of any such charge being  made against me.    In the last place, may I suggest that the theory of an unintentional  mistake throws the best light upon the case? For any conversation  with my accuser was either in German or English. You know my  German linguistic ability and the error that might be made there;  and as for English, I challenge my accuser to understand three  consecutive sentences in English.    I trust you will take these facts into account before sentence is  passed upon me.    Respectfully yours,    ALBERT R. WILLIAMS.      By the time this was finished a stir in the courtyard below heralded  the beginning of the day's activities. And what did this day hold in  store for me?          Chapter IV    Roulette And Liberty        Our morning toilet was completed with the aid of one small, flimsy  towel for thirty of us. Hot water tinctured with coffee and milk was  served from a bucket with two or three cups. Bread which had  been saved from the previous day was brought forth from pockets  and hiding-places, and for some unaccountable reason a piece of  good butter was brought in. Apparently the Germans were trying to  escape the stigma of mistreating or underfeeding their prisoners.    Orders were given to get ready to move out. After an hour, they  were changed to \"Clean up the room.\" When we had accomplished  this, an inspecting officer entered and began to sniff and snort  until his eyes fairly blazed with wrath, and then in a torrent of words  he expressed his private and official opinion of us. So fast and  freely did his language flow that I couldn't catch all the compliments  he showered upon us; but \"Verdammte!\" \"Donnerwetter!\" and  \"Schwein!\" were stressed frequently enough for me to retain  a distinct memory of the same. One did not have to be a German  linguist to get the drift of his remarks.    They had an electric effect upon the prisoners, who with one  accord got busy picking up microscopic and invisible bits from the  floor. To see these men crawling around upon their stomachs  must have been highly gratifying to His Self-inflated Highness. The  highly gratifying thing to myself now is the fact that I did not do any  crawling, but sat stolidly in my chair and stared back at him, letting  my indignation get enough the better of my discretion even to  sneer--at least I persuade myself now that I did. Outside of this  little act of gallantry I am heartily ashamed of my conduct at the  German Staff Headquarters. It was too acquiescent and obsequious  for some of those bureaucrats rough riding it over those helpless,  long-suffering, beaten Belgians.    Having called us \"Schwein,\" at high noon they brought in the swill.  It was a gray, putrid-looking mess in a big, battered bucket. They  told us that it came dried in bags and all that was necessary was to  mix the contents with hot water. The mixture was put up in 1911  and guaranteed to keep for 20 years. It looked as though it might  have already forfeited on its guarantee. There was nothing to  serve it with, and search of the room uncovered no implements of  attack. Our discomfiture furnished a young soldier with much  entertainment.    \"Nothing to eat your stew with? Well, just stand on that table there  and dive right into the bucket.\"    He was quite carried away with his own witticism, so that in sheer  good nature he went and returned with six soup plates which were  covered over with a thick grease quite impervious to cold water. I  had my misgivings about the mess and dreaded its steaming  odors. At last I summoned up courage and approached the  bucket, using my fingers in lieu of a clothes-pin as a defense for  my olfactory nerves. A surprise was in store for me; its palatability  and quality were quite the opposite of its appearance. While I  wouldn't enjoy that stew outside of captivity, and while the Brussels  men refused in any way to succumb to its charm, it was at least  very nutritious and furnished the strength to keep fighting.    But it is hard to battle against the blues, especially when all one's  comrades capitulate to them. Each man vied with the other in  radiating a blue funk, until the air was as thick as a London fog.    Picture, if you will, the scene. By a fine irony, the books on the  shelves were on international law, and by a finer irony the book in  green binding that caught my eye as it stood out from the black  array of volumes was R. Dimmont's \"The Origins of Belgian  Neutrality.\" The Belgians who were enjoying the peculiar blessings  of that neutrality were sprawled over the floor or pacing restlessly  up and down the room, or, in utter despair, buried their heads in  their arms flung out across the table.    About three o'clock the name \"Herr Peters\" was called. He had  been found guilty of mumbling to his comrades that their captain  was pushing them too hard in an advance. One could believe the  charge, for, as his name was called, he was sullen and unconcerned.  \"You are sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor in a fortress.  You must go at once.\"    He muttered in an undertone something about \"being luckier in  prison in winter than out there on the cold, freezing ground,\" and,"]]]
