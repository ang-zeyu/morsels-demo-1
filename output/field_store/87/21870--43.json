In 1973-74 the sharp increase in    oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious    program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the    mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the    nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since full    independence in 1988. The current government has put reform, including    privatization of some public sector companies and an overhaul of the banking    and financial system, on hold, but has continued efforts to admit private    enterprise to the hydrocarbon industry.

For it is impossible for a man to begin to learn what he has a  conceit that he already knows.          LXXIII    Give me but one young man, that has come to the School with this  intention, who stands forth a champion of this cause, and says, \"All  else I renounce, content if I am but able to pass my life free from  hindrance and trouble; to raise my head aloft and face all things as a  free man; to look up to heaven as a friend of God, fearing nothing that  may come to pass!\" Point out such a one to me, that I may say, \"Enter,  young man, into possession of that which is thine own. For thy lot is to  adorn Philosophy. Thine are these possessions; thine these books, these  discourses!\"    And when our champion has duly exercised himself in this part of the  subject, I hope he will come back to me and say:--\"What I desire is to  be free from passion and from perturbation; as one who grudges no pains  in the pursuit of piety and philosophy, what I desire is to know my duty  to the Gods, my duty to my parents, to my brothers, to my country, to  strangers.\"    \"Enter then on the second part of the subject; it is thine also.\"    \"But I have already mastered the second part; only I wished to stand  firm and unshaken--as firm when asleep as when awake, as firm when  elated with wine as in despondency and dejection.\"    \"Friend, you are verily a God! you cherish great designs.\"          LXXIV    \"The question at stake,\" said Epictetus, \"is no common one; it is  this:--Are we in our senses, or are we not?\"          LXXV    If you have given way to anger, be sure that over and above the evil  involved therein, you have strengthened the habit, and added fuel to  the fire. If overcome by a temptation of the flesh, do not reckon it  a single defeat, but that you have also strengthened your dissolute  habits. Habits and faculties are necessarily affected by the  corresponding acts. Those that were not there before, spring up: the  rest gain in strength and extent. This is the account which Philosophers  give of the origin of diseases of the mind:--Suppose you have once  lusted after money: if reason sufficient to produce a sense of evil  be applied, then the lust is checked, and the mind at once regains its  original authority; whereas if you have recourse to no remedy, you can  no longer look for this return--on the contrary, the next time it is  excited by the corresponding object, the flame of desire leaps up more  quickly than before. By frequent repetition, the mind in the long  run becomes callous; and thus this mental disease produces confirmed  Avarice.    One who has had fever, even when it has left him, is not in the same  condition of health as before, unless indeed his cure is complete.  Something of the same sort is true also of diseases of the mind. Behind,  there remains a legacy of traces and blisters: and unless these are  effectually erased, subsequent blows on the same spot will produce  no longer mere blisters, but sores. If you do not wish to be prone  to anger, do not feed the habit; give it nothing which may tend its  increase. At first, keep quiet and count the days when you were not  angry: \"I used to be angry every day, then every other day: next every  two, next every three days!\" and if you succeed in passing thirty days,  sacrifice to the Gods in thanksgiving.          LXXVI    How then may this be attained?--Resolve, now if never before, to approve  thyself to thyself; resolve to show thyself fair in God's sight; long to  be pure with thine own pure self and God!          LXXVII    That is the true athlete, that trains himself to resist such outward  impressions as these.    \"Stay, wretched man! suffer not thyself to be carried away!\" Great is  the combat, divine the task! you are fighting for Kingship, for Liberty,  for Happiness, for Tranquillity. Remember God: call upon Him to aid  thee, like a comrade that stands beside thee in the fight.          LXXVIII    Who then is a Stoic--in the sense that we call a statue of Phidias  which is modelled after that master's art? Show me a man in this sense  modelled after the doctrines that are ever upon his lips. Show me a man  that is sick--and happy; an exile--and happy; in evil report--and happy!  Show me him, I ask again. So help me Heaven, I long to see one Stoic!  Nay, if you cannot show me one fully modelled, let me at least see one  in whom the process is at work--one whose bent is in that direction. Do  me that favour! Grudge it not to an old man, to behold a sight he has  never yet beheld. Think you I wish to see the Zeus or Athena of Phidias,  bedecked with gold and ivory?--Nay, show me, one of you, a human soul,  desiring to be of one mind with God, no more to lay blame on God or man,  to suffer nothing to disappoint, nothing to cross him, to yield neither  to anger, envy, nor jealousy--in a word, why disguise the matter? one  that from a man would fain become a God; one that while still imprisoned  in this dead body makes fellowship with God his aim. Show me him!--Ah,  you cannot! Then why mock yourselves and delude others? why stalk about  tricked out in other men's attire, thieves and robbers that you are of  names and things to which you can show no title!          LXXIX    If you have assumed a character beyond your strength, you have both  played a poor figure in that, and neglected one that is within your  powers.          LXXX    Fellow, you have come to blows at home with a slave: you have turned the  household upside down, and thrown the neighbourhood into confusion; and  do you come to me then with airs of assumed modesty--do you sit down  like a sage and criticise my explanation of the readings, and whatever  idle babble you say has come into my head? Have you come full of envy,  and dejected because nothing is sent you from home; and while the  discussion is going on, do you sit brooding on nothing but how your  father or your brother are disposed towards you:--\"What are they saying  about me there? at this moment they imagine I am making progress and  saying, He will return perfectly omniscient! I wish I could become  omniscient before I return; but that would be very troublesome. No one  sends me anything--the baths at Nicopolis are dirty; things are wretched  at home and wretched here.\" And then they say, \"Nobody is any the better  for the School.\"--Who comes to the School with a sincere wish to learn:  to submit his principles to correction and himself to treatment? Who, to  gain a sense of his wants? Why then be surprised if you carry home from  the School exactly what you bring into it?          LXXXI    \"Epictetus, I have often come desiring to hear you speak, and you have  never given me any answer; now if possible, I entreat you, say something  to me.\"    \"Is there, do you think,\" replied Epictetus, \"an art of speaking as  of other things, if it is to be done skilfully and with profit to the  hearer?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And are all profited by what they hear, or only some among them? So  that it seems there is an art of hearing as well as of speaking. . . .  To make a statue needs skill: to view a statue aright needs skill also.\"    \"Admitted.\"    \"And I think all will allow that one who proposes to hear philosophers  speak needs a considerable training in hearing. Is that not so? The tell  me on what subject your are able to hear me.\"    \"Why, on good and evil.\"    \"The good and evil of what? a horse, an ox?\"    \"No; of a man.\"    \"Do we know then what Man is? what his nature is? what is the idea we  have of him? And are our ears practised in any degree on the subject?  Nay, do you understand what Nature is? can you follow me in any degree  when I say that I shall have to use demonstration? Do you understand  what Demonstration is? what True or False is? . . . must I drive you to  Philosophy? . . . Show me what good I am to do by discoursing with you.  Rouse my desire to do so. The sight of a pasture it loves stirs in  a sheep the desire to feed: show it a stone or a bit of bread and it  remains unmoved. Thus we also have certain natural desires, aye, and one  that moves us to speak when we find a listener that is worth his salt:  one that himself stirs the spirit. But if he sits by like a stone or a  tuft of grass, how can he rouse a man's desire?\"    \"Then you will say nothing to me?\"    \"I can only tell you this: that one who knows not who he is and to  what end he was born; what kind of world this is and with whom he is  associated therein; one who cannot distinguish Good and Evil, Beauty and  Foulness, . . . Truth and Falsehood, will never follow Reason in shaping  his desires and impulses and repulsions, nor yet in assent, denial, or  suspension of judgement; but will in one word go about deaf and blind,  thinking himself to be somewhat, when he is in truth of no account. Is  there anything new in all this? Is not this ignorance the cause of all  the mistakes and mischances of men since the human race began? . . .\"    \"This is all I have to say to you, and even this against the grain. Why?  Because you have not stirred my spirit. For what can I see in you to  stir me, as a spirited horse will stir a judge of horses? Your body?  That you maltreat. Your dress? That is luxurious. You behavior, your  look?--Nothing whatever. When you want to hear a philosopher, do not  say, You say nothing to me'; only show yourself worthy or fit to hear,  and then you will see how you will move the speaker.\"          LXXXII    And now, when you see brothers apparently good friends and living in  accord, do not immediately pronounce anything upon their friendship,  though they should affirm it with an oath, though they should declare,  \"For us to live apart in a thing impossible!\" For the heart of a bad  man is faithless, unprincipled, inconstant: now overpowered by one  impression, now by another. Ask not the usual questions, Were they born  of the same parents, reared together, and under the same"]]]
