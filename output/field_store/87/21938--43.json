XVII.--Then at length Liscus, moved by Caesar's speech, discloses what  he had hitherto kept secret:--that \"there are some whose influence with  the people is very great, who, though private men, have more power than  the magistrates themselves: that these by seditious and violent language  are deterring the populace from contributing the corn which they ought  to supply; [by telling them] that, if they cannot any longer retain the  supremacy of Gaul, it were better to submit to the government of Gauls  than of Romans, nor ought they to doubt that, if the Romans should  overpower the Helvetii, they would wrest their freedom from the Aedui  together with the remainder of Gaul. By these very men [said he] are our  plans, and whatever is done in the camp, disclosed to the enemy; that  they could not be restrained by _him_: nay more, he was well aware that,  though compelled by necessity, he had disclosed the matter to Caesar, at  how great a risk he had done it; and for that reason, he had been silent  as long as he could.\"    XVIII.--Caesar perceived that, by this speech of Liscus, Dumnorix, the  brother of Divitiacus, was indicated; but, as he was unwilling that  these matters should be discussed while so many were present, he  speedily dismisses the council, but detains Liscus: he inquires from him  when alone, about those things which he had said in the meeting. He  [Liscus] speaks more unreservedly and boldly. He [Caesar] makes  inquiries on the same points privately of others, and discovers that it  is all true; that \"Dumnorix is the person, a man of the highest daring,  in great favour with the people on account of his liberality, a man  eager for a revolution: that for a great many years he has been in the  habit of contracting for the customs and all the other taxes of the  Aedui at a small cost, because when _he_ bids, no one dares to bid  against him. By these means he has both increased his own private  property and amassed great means for giving largesses; that he maintains  constantly at his own expense and keeps about his own person a great  number of cavalry, and that not only at home, but even among the  neighbouring states, he has great influence, and for the sake of  strengthening this influence has given his mother in marriage among the  Bituriges to a man the most noble and most influential there; that he  has himself taken a wife from among the Helvetii, and has given his  sister by the mother's side and his female relations in marriage into  other states; that he favours and wishes well to the Helvetii on account  of this connection; and that he hates Caesar and the Romans, on his own  account, because by their arrival his power was weakened, and his  brother, Divitiacus, restored to his former position of influence and  dignity: that, if anything should happen to the Romans, he entertains  the highest hope of gaining the sovereignty by means of the Helvetii,  but that under the government of the Roman people he despairs not only  of royalty but even of that influence which he already has.\" Caesar  discovered too, on inquiring into the unsuccessful cavalry engagement  which had taken place a few days before, that the commencement of that  flight had been made by Dumnorix and his cavalry (for Dumnorix was in  command of the cavalry which the Aedui had sent for aid to Caesar); that  by their flight the rest of the cavalry was dismayed.    XIX.--After learning these circumstances, since to these suspicions the  most unequivocal facts were added, viz., that he had led the Helvetii  through the territories of the Sequani; that he had provided that  hostages should be mutually given; that he had done all these things,  not only without any orders of his [Caesar's] and of his own state's,  but even without their [the Aedui] knowing anything of it themselves;  that he [Dumnorix] was reprimanded by the [chief] magistrate of the  Aedui; he [Caesar] considered that there was sufficient reason why he  should either punish him himself, or order the state to do so. One thing  [however] stood in the way of all this--that he had learned by  experience his brother Divitiacus's very high regard for the Roman  people, his great affection towards him, his distinguished faithfulness,  justice, and moderation; for he was afraid lest by the punishment of  this man, he should hurt the feelings of Divitiacus. Therefore, before  he attempted anything, he orders Divitiacus to be summoned to him, and  when the ordinary interpreters had been withdrawn, converses with him  through Caius Valerius Procillus, chief of the province of Gaul, an  intimate friend of his, in whom he reposed the highest confidence in  everything; at the same time he reminds him of what was said about  Dumnorix in the council of the Gauls, when he himself was present, and  shows what each had said of him privately in his [Caesar's] own  presence; he begs and exhorts him, that, without offence to his  feelings, he may either himself pass judgment on him [Dumnorix] after  trying the case, or else order the [Aeduan] state to do so.    XX.-Divitiacus, embracing Caesar, begins to implore him, with many  tears, that \"he would not pass any very severe sentence upon his  brother; saying, that he knows that those [charges] are true, and that  nobody suffered more pain on that account than he himself did; for when  he himself could effect a very great deal by his influence at home and  in the rest of Gaul, and he [Dumnorix] very little on account of his  youth, the latter had become powerful through his means, which power and  strength he used not only to the lessening of his [Divitiacus]  popularity, but almost to his ruin; that he, however, was influenced  both by fraternal affection and by public opinion. But if anything very  severe from Caesar should befall him [Dumnorix], no one would think that  it had been done without his consent, since he himself held such a place  in Caesar's friendship; from which circumstance it would arise that the  affections of the whole of Gaul would be estranged from him.\" As he was  with tears begging these things of Caesar in many words, Caesar takes  his right hand, and, comforting him, begs him to make an end of  entreating, and assures him that his regard for him is so great that he  forgives both the injuries of the republic and his private wrongs, at  his desire and prayers. He summons Dumnorix to him; he brings in his  brother; he points out what he censures in him; he lays before him what  he of himself perceives, and what the state complains of; he warns him  for the future to avoid all grounds of suspicion; he says that he  pardons the past, for the sake of his brother, Divitiacus. He sets spies  over Dumnorix that he may be able to know what he does, and with whom he  communicates.    XXI.--Being on the same day informed by his scouts that the enemy had  encamped at the foot of a mountain eight miles from his own camp, he  sent persons to ascertain what the nature of the mountain was, and of  what kind the ascent on every side. Word was brought back that it was  easy. During the third watch he orders Titus Labienus, his lieutenant  with praetorian powers, to ascend to the highest ridge of the mountain  with two legions, and with those as guides who had examined the road; he  explains what his plan is. He himself during the fourth watch, hastens  to them by the same route by which the enemy had gone, and sends on all  the cavalry before him. Publius Considius, who was reputed to be very  experienced in military affairs, and had been in the army of Lucius  Sulla, and afterwards in that of Marcus Crassus, is sent forward with  the scouts.    XXII.--At day-break, when the summit of the mountain was in the  possession of Titus Labienus, and he himself was not further off than a  mile and half from the enemy's camp, nor, as he afterwards ascertained  from the captives, had either his arrival or that of Labienus been  discovered; Considius, with his horse at full gallop, comes up to him--  says that the mountain which he [Caesar] wished should be seized by  Labienus, is in possession of the enemy; that he has discovered this by  the Gallic arms and ensigns. Caesar leads off his forces to the next  hill: [and] draws them up in battle-order. Labienus, as he had been  ordered by Caesar not to come to an engagement unless [Caesar's] own  forces were seen near the enemy's camp, that the attack upon the enemy  might be made on every side at the same time, was, after having taken  possession of the mountain, waiting for our men, and refraining from  battle. When, at length, the day was far advanced, Caesar learned  through spies that the mountain was in possession of his own men, and  that the Helvetii had moved their camp, and that Considius, struck with  fear, had reported to him, as seen, that which he had not seen. On that  day he follows the enemy at his usual distance, and pitches his camp  three miles from theirs.    XXIII.--The next day (as there remained in all only two days' space [to  the time] when he must serve out the corn to his army, and as he was not  more than eighteen miles from Bibracte, by far the largest and best-stored  town of the Aedui) he thought that he ought to provide for a  supply of corn; and diverted his march from the Helvetii, and advanced  rapidly to Bibracte. This circumstance is reported to the enemy by some  deserters from Lucius Aemilius, a captain of the Gallic horse. The  Helvetii, either because they thought that the Romans, struck with  terror, were retreating from them, the more so, as the day before,  though they had seized on the higher grounds, they had not joined  battle; or because they flattered themselves that they might be cut off  from the provisions, altering their plan and changing their route, began  to pursue and to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10661"],[0,"A Selection from the Discourses of Epictetus with the Encheiridion (#7)"],[1,"ceived, and she will  not do it; but so long as you do not show it, what can she follow except  that which appears to herself (her opinion)? Nothing else. Why then are  you angry with the unhappy woman that she has been bewildered about the  most important things, and is become a viper instead of a human  creature? And why not, if it is possible, rather pity, as we pity the  blind and the lame, so those who are blinded and maimed in the faculties  which are supreme?    Whoever then clearly remembers this, that to man the measure of every  act is the appearance (the opinion), whether the thing appears good or  bad. If good, he is free from blame; if bad, himself suffers the  penalty, for it is impossible that he who is deceived can be one person,  and he who suffers another person--whoever remembers this will not be  angry with any man, will not be vexed at any man, will not revile or  blame any man, nor hate, nor quarrel with any man.    So then all these great and dreadful deeds have this origin, in the  appearance (opinion)? Yes, this origin and no other. The Iliad is  nothing else than appearance and the use of appearances. It appeared to  Alexander to carry off the wife of Menelaus. It appeared to Helene to  follow him. If then it had appeared to Menelaus to feel that it was a  gain to be deprived of such a wife, what would have happened? Not only  would the Iliad have been lost, but the Odyssey also. On so small a  matter then did such great things depend? But what do you mean by such  great things? Wars and civil commotions, and the destruction of many men  and cities. And what great matter is this? Is it nothing? But what great  matter is the death of many oxen, and many sheep, and many nests of  swallows or storks being burnt or destroyed? Are these things then like  those? Very like. Bodies of men are destroyed, and the bodies of oxen  and sheep; the dwellings of men are burnt, and the nests of storks. What  is there in this great or dreadful? Or show me what is the difference  between a man's house and a stork's nest, as far as each is a dwelling;  except that man builds his little houses of beams and tiles and bricks,  and the stork builds them of sticks and mud. Are a stork and a man then  like things? What say you? In body they are very much alike.    Does a man then differ in no respect from a stork? Don't suppose that I  say so; but there is no difference in these matters (which I have  mentioned). In what then is the difference? Seek and you will find that  there is a difference in another matter. See whether it is not in a man  the understanding of what he does, see if it is not in social community,  in fidelity, in modesty, in steadfastness, in intelligence. Where then  is the great good and evil in men? It is where the difference is. If the  difference is preserved and remains fenced round, and neither modesty is  destroyed, nor fidelity, nor intelligence, then the man also is  preserved; but if any of these things is destroyed and stormed like a  city, then the man too perishes: and in this consist the great things.  Alexander, you say, sustained great damage then when the Hellenes  invaded and when they ravaged Troy, and when his brothers perished. By  no means; for no man is damaged by an action which is not his own; but  what happened at that time was only the destruction of stork's nests.  Now the ruin of Alexander was when he lost the character of modesty,  fidelity, regard to hospitality, and to decency. When was Achilles  ruined? Was it when Patroclus died? Not so. But it happened when he  began to be angry, when he wept for a girl, when he forgot that he was  at Troy not to get mistresses, but to fight. These things are the ruin  of men, this is being besieged, this is the destruction of cities, when  right opinions are destroyed, when they are corrupted.           *       *       *       *       *    ON CONSTANCY (OR FIRMNESS).--The being (nature) of the good is a certain  will; the being of the bad is a certain kind of will. What, then, are  externals? Materials for the will, about which the will being conversant  shall obtain its own good or evil. How shall it obtain the good? If it  does not admire (over-value) the materials; for the opinions about the  materials, if the opinions are right, make the will good: but perverse  and distorted opinions make the will bad. God has fixed this law, and  says, \"If you would have anything good, receive it from yourself.\" You  say, No, but I will have it from another. Do not so: but receive it from  yourself. Therefore when the tyrant threatens and calls me, I say, Whom  do you threaten? If he says, I will put you in chains, I say, You  threaten my hands and my feet. If he says, I will cut off your head, I  reply, You threaten my head. If he says, I will throw you into prison, I  say, You threaten the whole of this poor body. If he threatens me with  banishment, I say the same. Does he then not threaten you at all? If I  feel that all these things do not concern me, he does not threaten me at  all; but if I fear any of them, it is I whom he threatens. Whom then do  I fear? the master of what? The master of things which are in my own  power? There is no such master. Do I fear the master of things which are  not in my power? And what are these things to me?    Do you philosophers then teach us to despise kings? I hope not. Who  among us teaches to claim against them the power over things which they  possess? Take my poor body, take my property, take my reputation, take  those who are about me. If I advise any persons to claim these things,  they may truly accuse me. Yes, but I intend to command your opinions  also. And who has given you this power? How can you conquer the opinion  of another man? By applying terror to it, he replies, I will conquer it.  Do you not know that opinion conquers itself, and is not conquered by  another? But nothing else can conquer will except the will itself. For  this reason too the law of God is most powerful and most just, which is  this: Let the stronger always be superior to the weaker. Ten are  stronger than one. For what? For putting in chains, for killing, for  dragging whither they choose, for taking away what a man has. The ten  therefore conquer the one in this in which they are stronger. In what  then are the ten weaker? If the one possesses right opinions and the  others do not. Well then, can the ten conquer in this matter? How is it  possible? If we were placed in the scales, must not the heavier draw  down the scale in which it is.    How strange then that Socrates should have been so treated by the  Athenians. Slave, why do you say Socrates? Speak of the thing as it is:  how strange that the poor body of Socrates should have been carried off  and dragged to prison by stronger men, and that anyone should have given  hemlock to the poor body of Socrates, and that it should breathe out the  life. Do these things seem strange, do they seem unjust, do you on  account of these things blame God? Had Socrates then no equivalent for  these things? Where then for him was the nature of good? Whom shall we  listen to, you or him? And what does Socrates say? \"Anytus and Melitus  can kill me, but they cannot hurt me.\" And further, he says, \"If it so  pleases God, so let it be.\"    But show me that he who has the inferior principles overpowers him who  is superior in principles. You will never show this, nor come near  showing it; for this is the law of nature and of God that the superior  shall always overpower the inferior. In what? In that in which it is  superior. One body is stronger than another: many are stronger than one:  the thief is stronger than he who is not a thief. This is the reason why  I also lost my lamp, because in wakefulness the thief was superior to  me. But the man bought the lamp at this price: for a lamp he became a  thief, a faithless fellow, and like a wild beast. This seemed to him a  good bargain. Be it so. But a man has seized me by the cloak, and is  drawing me to the public place: then others bawl out, Philosopher, what  has been the use of your opinions? see, you are dragged to prison, you  are going to be beheaded. And what system of philosophy ([Greek:  eisagogaen)] could I have made so that, if a stronger man should have  laid hold of my cloak, I should not be dragged off; that if ten men  should have laid hold of me and cast me into prison, I should not be  cast in? Have I learned nothing else then? I have learned to see that  everything which happens, if it be independent of my will, is nothing to  me. I may ask, if you have not gained by this. Why then do you seek  advantage in anything else than in that in which you have learned that  advantage is?    Will you not leave the small arguments ([Greek: logaria]) about these  matters to others, to lazy fellows, that they may sit in a corner and  receive their sorry pay, or grumble that no one gives them anything; and  will you not come forward and make use of what you have learned? For it  is not these small arguments that are wanted now; the writings of the  Stoics are full of them. What then is the thing which is wanted? A man  who shall apply them, one who by his acts shall bear testimony to his  words. Assume, I intreat you, this character, that we may no longer use  in the schools the examples of the ancients, but may have some example  of our own.    To whom then does the contemplation of these matters (philosophical  inquiries) belong? To him who has leisure, for man is an animal that  loves contemplation. But it is shameful to contemplate these things as  runaway slaves do; we should sit, as in a theatre, free from  distraction, and listen at one time to the tragic actor, at another time  to the lute-player; and not do as slaves do. As soon as the slave has  taken his station he praises the actor and at the same time looks round;  then if any one calls out his master's name, the slave is immediately  frightened and"]]]
