But I my steps towards the ancient bard  Reverting, ruminated on the words  Betokening me such ill.  Onward he mov'd,  And thus in going question'd:  \"Whence the' amaze  That holds thy senses wrapt?\"  I satisfied  The' inquiry, and the sage enjoin'd me straight:  \"Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard  To thee importing harm; and note thou this,\"  With his rais'd finger bidding me take heed,       \"When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,  Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life  The future tenour will to thee unfold.\"       Forthwith he to the left hand turn'd his feet:  We left the wall, and tow'rds the middle space  Went by a path, that to a valley strikes;  Which e'en thus high exhal'd its noisome steam.        CANTO XI    UPON the utmost verge of a high bank,  By craggy rocks environ'd round, we came,  Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow'd:  And here to shun the horrible excess  Of fetid exhalation, upward cast  From the profound abyss, behind the lid  Of a great monument we stood retir'd,  Whereon this scroll I mark'd:  \"I have in charge  Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew  From the right path.--Ere our descent behooves  We make delay, that somewhat first the sense,  To the dire breath accustom'd, afterward  Regard it not.\"  My master thus; to whom  Answering I spake:  \"Some compensation find  That the time past not wholly lost.\"  He then:  \"Lo! how my thoughts e'en to thy wishes tend!  My son! within these rocks,\" he thus began,  \"Are three close circles in gradation plac'd,  As these which now thou leav'st. Each one is full  Of spirits accurs'd; but that the sight alone  Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how  And for what cause in durance they abide.       \"Of all malicious act abhorr'd in heaven,  The end is injury; and all such end  Either by force or fraud works other's woe  But fraud, because of man peculiar evil,  To God is more displeasing; and beneath  The fraudulent are therefore doom'd to' endure  Severer pang.  The violent occupy  All the first circle; and because to force  Three persons are obnoxious, in three rounds  Hach within other sep'rate is it fram'd.  To God, his neighbour, and himself, by man  Force may be offer'd; to himself I say  And his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear  At full.  Death, violent death, and painful wounds  Upon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes  By devastation, pillage, and the flames,  His substance.  Slayers, and each one that smites  In malice, plund'rers, and all robbers, hence  The torment undergo of the first round  In different herds.  Man can do violence  To himself and his own blessings:  and for this  He in the second round must aye deplore  With unavailing penitence his crime,  Whoe'er deprives himself of life and light,  In reckless lavishment his talent wastes,  And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy.  To God may force be offer'd, in the heart  Denying and blaspheming his high power,  And nature with her kindly law contemning.  And thence the inmost round marks with its seal  Sodom and Cahors, and all such as speak  Contemptuously' of the Godhead in their hearts.       \"Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting,  May be by man employ'd on one, whose trust  He wins, or on another who withholds  Strict confidence.  Seems as the latter way  Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes.  Whence in the second circle have their nest  Dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries,  Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce  To lust, or set their honesty at pawn,  With such vile scum as these.  The other way  Forgets both Nature's general love, and that  Which thereto added afterwards gives birth  To special faith.  Whence in the lesser circle,  Point of the universe, dread seat of Dis,  The traitor is eternally consum'd.\"       I thus:  \"Instructor, clearly thy discourse  Proceeds, distinguishing the hideous chasm  And its inhabitants with skill exact.  But tell me this: they of the dull, fat pool,  Whom the rain beats, or whom the tempest drives,  Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet,  Wherefore within the city fire-illum'd  Are not these punish'd, if God's wrath be on them?  And if it be not, wherefore in such guise  Are they condemned?\"  He answer thus return'd:  \"Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind,  Not so accustom'd? or what other thoughts  Possess it?  Dwell not in thy memory  The words, wherein thy ethic page describes  Three dispositions adverse to Heav'n's will,  Incont'nence, malice, and mad brutishness,  And how incontinence the least offends  God, and least guilt incurs?  If well thou note  This judgment, and remember who they are,  Without these walls to vain repentance doom'd,  Thou shalt discern why they apart are plac'd  From these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours  Justice divine on them its vengeance down.\"       \"O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight,  Thou so content'st me, when thou solv'st my doubt,  That ignorance not less than knowledge charms.  Yet somewhat turn thee back,\" I in these words  Continu'd, \"where thou saidst, that usury  Offends celestial Goodness; and this knot  Perplex'd unravel.\"  He thus made reply:  \"Philosophy, to an attentive ear,  Clearly points out, not in one part alone,  How imitative nature takes her course  From the celestial mind and from its art:  And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds,  Not many leaves scann'd o'er, observing well  Thou shalt discover, that your art on her  Obsequious follows, as the learner treads  In his instructor's step, so that your art  Deserves the name of second in descent  From God.  These two, if thou recall to mind  Creation's holy book, from the beginning  Were the right source of life and excellence  To human kind.  But in another path  The usurer walks; and Nature in herself  And in her follower thus he sets at nought,  Placing elsewhere his hope.  But follow now  My steps on forward journey bent; for now  The Pisces play with undulating glance  Along the' horizon, and the Wain lies all  O'er the north-west; and onward there a space  Is our steep passage down the rocky height.\"        CANTO XII    THE place where to descend the precipice  We came, was rough as Alp, and on its verge  Such object lay, as every eye would shun.       As is that ruin, which Adice's stream  On this side Trento struck, should'ring the wave,  Or loos'd by earthquake or for lack of prop;  For from the mountain's summit, whence it mov'd  To the low level, so the headlong rock  Is shiver'd, that some passage it might give  To him who from above would pass; e'en such  Into the chasm was that descent: and there  At point of the disparted ridge lay stretch'd  The infamy of Crete, detested brood  Of the feign'd heifer:  and at sight of us  It gnaw'd itself, as one with rage distract.  To him my guide exclaim'd:  \"Perchance thou deem'st  The King of Athens here, who, in the world  Above, thy death contriv'd.  Monster! avaunt!  He comes not tutor'd by thy sister's art,  But to behold your torments is he come.\"       Like to a bull, that with impetuous spring  Darts, at the moment when the fatal blow  Hath struck him, but unable to proceed  Plunges on either side; so saw I plunge  The Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim'd:  \"Run to the passage! while he storms, 't is well  That thou descend.\"  Thus down our road we took  Through those dilapidated crags, that oft  Mov'd underneath my feet, to weight like theirs  Unus'd.  I pond'ring went, and thus he spake:       \"Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin'd steep,  Guarded by the brute violence, which I  Have vanquish'd now. Know then, that when I erst  Hither descended to the nether hell,  This rock was not yet fallen.  But past doubt  (If well I mark) not long ere He arrived,  Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil  Of the highest circle, then through all its bounds  Such trembling seiz'd the deep concave and foul,  I thought the universe was thrill'd with love,  Whereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft  Been into chaos turn'd:  and in that point,  Here, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down.  But fix thine eyes beneath:  the river of blood  Approaches, in the which all those are steep'd,  Who have by violence injur'd.\"  O blind lust!  O foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on  In the brief life, and in the eternal then  Thus miserably o'erwhelm us.  I beheld  An ample foss, that in a bow was bent,  As circling all the plain; for so my guide  Had told.  Between it and the rampart's base  On trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm'd,  As to the chase they on the earth were wont.       At seeing us descend they each one stood;  And issuing from the troop, three sped with bows  And missile weapons chosen first; of whom  One cried from far:  \"Say to what pain ye come  Condemn'd, who down this steep have journied?  Speak  From whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw.\"       To whom my guide:  \"Our answer shall be made  To Chiron, there, when nearer him we come.  Ill was thy mind, thus ever quick and rash.\"       Then me he touch'd, and spake:  \"Nessus is this,  Who for the fair Deianira died,  And wrought himself revenge for his own fate.  He in the midst, that on his breast looks down,  Is the great Chiron who Achilles nurs'd;  That other Pholus, prone to wrath.\"  Around  The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts  At whatsoever spirit dares emerge  From out the blood, more than his guilt allows.       We to those beasts, that rapid strode along,  Drew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,  And with the notch push'd back his shaggy beard  To the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view  Exposing, to his fellows thus exclaim'd:  \"Are ye aware, that he who comes behind  Moves what he touches?  The feet of the dead  Are not so wont.\"  My trusty guide, who now  Stood near his breast, where the two natures join,  Thus made reply:  \"He is indeed alive,  And solitary so must needs by me  Be shown the gloomy vale, thereto"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10084"],[0,"Kazan (#7)"],[1,"that it might be  there.    She told him many other things in the days and nights that followed. The  third night Kazan himself gathered the hunt-pack and led in the chase.  Three times that month, before the moon left the skies, he led the  chase, and each time there was a kill. But as the snows began to grow  softer under his feet he found a greater and greater companionship in  Gray Wolf, and they hunted alone, living on the big white rabbits. In  all the world he had loved but two things, the girl with the shining  hair and the hands that had caressed him--and Gray Wolf.    He did not leave the big plain, and often He took his mate to the top of  the ridge, and he would try to tell her what he had left back there.  With the dark nights the call of the woman became so strong upon him  that he was filled with a longing to go back, and take Gray Wolf with  him.    Something happened very soon after that. They were crossing the open  plain one day when up on the face of the ridge Kazan saw something that  made his heart stand still. A man, with a dog-sledge and team, was  coming down into their world. The wind had not warned them, and suddenly  Kazan saw something glisten in the man's hands. He knew what it was. It  was the thing that spat fire and thunder, and killed.    He gave his warning to Gray Wolf, and they were off like the wind, side  by side. And then came the _sound_--and Kazan's hatred of men burst  forth in a snarl as he leaped. There was a queer humming over their  heads. The sound from behind came again, and this time Gray Wolf gave a  yelp of pain, and rolled over and over in the snow. She was on her feet  again in an instant, and Kazan dropped behind her, and ran there until  they reached the shelter of the timber. Gray Wolf lay down, and began  licking the wound in her shoulder. Kazan faced the ridge. The man was  taking up their trail. He stopped where Gray Wolf had fallen, and  examined the snow. Then he came on.    Kazan urged Gray Wolf to her feet, and they made for the thick swamp  close to the lake. All that day they kept in the face of the wind, and  when Gray Wolf lay down Kazan stole back over their trail, watching and  sniffing the air.    For days after that Gray Wolf ran lame, and when once they came upon the  remains of an old camp, Kazan's teeth were bared in snarling hatred of  the man-scent that had been left behind. Growing in him there was a  desire for vengeance--vengeance for his own hurts, and for Gray Wolf's.  He tried to nose out the man-trail under the cover of fresh snow, and  Gray Wolf circled around him anxiously, and tried to lure him deeper  into the forest. At last he followed her sullenly. There was a savage  redness in his eyes.    Three days later the new moon came. And on the fifth night Kazan struck  a trail. It was fresh--so fresh that he stopped as suddenly as though  struck by a bullet when he ran upon it, and stood with every muscle in  his body quivering, and his hair on end. It was a man-trail. There were  the marks of the sledge, the dogs' feet, and the snow-shoeprints of his  enemy.    Then he threw up his head to the stars, and from his throat there rolled  out over the wide plains the hunt-cry--the wild and savage call for the  pack. Never had he put the savagery in it that was there to-night. Again  and again he sent forth that call, and then there came an answer and  another and still another, until Gray Wolf herself sat back on her  haunches and added her voice to Kazan's, and far out on the plain a  white and haggard-faced man halted his exhausted dogs to listen, while a  voice said faintly from the sledge:    \"The wolves, father. Are they coming--after us?\"    The man was silent. He was not young. The moon shone in his long white  beard, and added grotesquely to the height of his tall gaunt figure. A  girl had raised her head from a bearskin pillow on the sleigh. Her dark  eyes were filled beautifully with the starlight. She was pale. Her hair  fell in a thick shining braid over her shoulder, and she was hugging  something tightly to her breast.    \"They're on the trail of something--probably a deer,\" said the man,  looking at the breech of his rifle. \"Don't worry, Jo. We'll stop at the  next bit of scrub and see if we can't find enough dry stuff for a  fire.--Wee-ah-h-h-h, boys! Koosh--koosh--\" and he snapped his whip over  the backs of his team.    From the bundle at the girl's breast there came a small wailing cry. And  far back in the plain there answered it the scattered voice of the pack.    At last Kazan was on the trail of vengeance. He ran slowly at first,  with Gray Wolf close beside him, pausing every three or four hundred  yards to send forth the cry. A gray leaping form joined them from  behind. Another followed. Two came in from the side, and Kazan's  solitary howl gave place to the wild tongue of the pack. Numbers  grew, and with increasing number the pace became swifter.  Four--six--seven--ten--fourteen, by the time the more open and  wind-swept part of the plain was reached.    It was a strong pack, filled with old and fearless hunters. Gray Wolf  was the youngest, and she kept close to Kazan's shoulders. She could see  nothing of his red-shot eyes and dripping jaws, and would not have  understood if she had seen. But she could _feel_ and she was thrilled by  the spirit of that strange and mysterious savagery that had made Kazan  forget all things but hurt and death.    The pack made no sound. There was only the panting of breath and the  soft fall of many feet. They ran swiftly and close. And always Kazan was  a leap ahead, with Gray Wolf nosing his shoulder.    Never had he wanted to kill as he felt the desire in him to kill now.  For the first time he had no fear of man, no fear of the club, of the  whip, or of the thing that blazed forth fire and death. He ran more  swiftly, in order to overtake them and give them battle sooner. All of  the pent-up madness of four years of slavery and abuse at the hands of  men broke loose in thin red streams of fire in his veins, and when at  last he saw a moving blotch far out on the plain ahead of him, the cry  that came out of his throat was one that Gray Wolf did not understand.    Three hundred yards beyond that moving blotch was the thin line of  timber, and Kazan and his followers bore down swiftly. Half-way to the  timber they were almost upon it, and suddenly it stopped and became a  black and motionless shadow on the snow. From out of it there leaped  that lightning tongue of flame that Kazan had always dreaded, and he  heard the hissing song of the death-bee over his head. He did not mind  it now. He yelped sharply, and the wolves raced in until four of them  were neck-and-neck with him.    A second flash--and the death-bee drove from breast to tail of a huge  gray fighter close to Gray Wolf. A third--a fourth--a fifth spurt of  that fire from the black shadow, and Kazan himself felt a sudden swift  passing of a red-hot thing along his shoulder, where the man's last  bullet shaved off the hair and stung his flesh.    Three of the pack had gone down under the fire of the rifle, and half of  the others were swinging to the right and the left. But Kazan drove  straight ahead. Faithfully Gray Wolf followed him.    The sledge-dogs had been freed from their traces, and before he could  reach the man, whom he saw with his rifle held like a club in his hands,  Kazan was met by the fighting mass of them. He fought like a fiend, and  there was the strength and the fierceness of two mates in the mad  gnashing of Gray Wolf's fangs. Two of the wolves rushed in, and Kazan  heard the terrific, back-breaking thud of the rifle. To him it was the  _club_. He wanted to reach it. He wanted to reach the man who held it,  and he freed himself from the fighting mass of the dogs and sprang to  the sledge. For the first time he saw that there was something human on  the sledge, and in an instant he was upon it. He buried his jaws deep.  They sank in something soft and hairy, and he opened them for another  lunge. And then he heard the voice! It was _her voice_! Every muscle in  his body stood still. He became suddenly like flesh turned to lifeless  stone.    _Her voice_! The bear rug was thrown back and what had been hidden under  it he saw clearly now in the light of the moon and the stars. In him  instinct worked more swiftly than human brain could have given birth to  reason. It was not _she_. But the voice was the same, and the white  girlish face so close to his own blood-reddened eyes held in it that  same mystery that he had learned to love. And he saw now that which she  was clutching to her breast, and there came from it a strange thrilling  cry--and he knew that here on the sledge he had found not enmity and  death, but that from which he had been driven away in the other world  beyond the ridge.    In a flash he turned. He snapped at Gray Wolf's flank, and she dropped  away with a startled yelp. It had all happened in a moment, but the man  was almost down. Kazan leaped under his clubbed rifle and drove into the  face of what was left of the pack. His fangs cut like knives. If he had  fought like a demon against the dogs, he fought like ten demons now, and  the man--bleeding and ready to fall--staggered back to the sledge,  marveling at what was happening. For in Gray Wolf there was now the  instinct of matehood, and seeing Kazan tearing and righting the pack she  joined him in the struggle which she could not understand.    When it was over, Kazan and Gray Wolf were alone out on the plain. The  pack had slunk away into the night, and the same moon and stars that had  given to Kazan the first knowledge of his birthright told him now that  no longer would those wild brothers of the plains respond to his call  when he howled into the sky.    He was hurt. And Gray Wolf was hurt, but not so badly as Kazan. He was  torn and bleeding. One of his legs was terribly bitten. After a time he  saw"]]]
