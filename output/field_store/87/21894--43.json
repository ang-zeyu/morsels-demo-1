[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/961"],[0,"Glinda of Oz (#6)"],[1," the houses and other buildings--all made of  rocks--could not be seen over the edge by anyone standing in the plain  below.    But now a big fat Flathead stood before the girls and in a gruff voice  demanded:    \"What are you doing here? Have the Skeezers sent you to spy upon us?\"    \"I am Princess Ozma, Ruler of all the Land of Oz.\"    \"Well, I've never heard of the Land of Oz, so you may be what you  claim,\" returned the Flathead.    \"This is the Land of Oz--part of it, anyway,\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"So  Princess Ozma rules you Flathead people, as well as all the other  people in Oz.\"    The man laughed, and all the others who stood around laughed, too. Some  one in the crowd called:    \"She'd better not tell the Supreme Dictator about ruling the Flatheads.  Eh, friends?\"    \"No, indeed!\" they all answered in positive tones.    \"Who is your Supreme Dictator?\" answered Ozma.    \"I think I'll let him tell you that himself,\" answered the man who had  first spoken. \"You have broken our laws by coming here; and whoever you  are the Supreme Dictator must fix your punishment. Come along with me.\"    He started down a path and Ozma and Dorothy followed him without  protest, as they wanted to see the most important person in this queer  country. The houses they passed seemed pleasant enough and each had a  little yard in which were flowers and vegetables. Walls of rock  separated the dwellings, and all the paths were paved with smooth slabs  of rock. This seemed their only building material and they utilized it  cleverly for every purpose.    Directly in the center of the great saucer stood a larger building  which the Flathead informed the girls was the palace of the Supreme  Dictator. He led them through an entrance hall into a big reception  room, where they sat upon stone benches and awaited the coming of the  Dictator. Pretty soon he entered from another room--a rather lean and  rather old Flathead, dressed much like the others of this strange race,  and only distinguished from them by the sly and cunning expression of  his face. He kept his eyes half closed and looked through the slits of  them at Ozma and Dorothy, who rose to receive him.    \"Are you the Supreme Dictator of the Flatheads?\" inquired Ozma.    \"Yes, that's me,\" he said, rubbing his hands slowly together. \"My word  is law. I'm the head of the Flatheads on this flat headland.\"    \"I am Princess Ozma of Oz, and I have come from the Emerald City to--\"    \"Stop a minute,\" interrupted the Dictator, and turned to the man who  had brought the girls there. \"Go away, Dictator Felo Flathead!\" he  commanded. \"Return to your duty and guard the Stairway. I will look  after these strangers.\" The man bowed and departed, and Dorothy asked  wonderingly:    \"Is he a Dictator, too?\"    \"Of course,\" was the answer. \"Everybody here is a dictator of something  or other. They're all office holders. That's what keeps them contented.  But I'm the Supreme Dictator of all, and I'm elected once a year. This  is a democracy, you know, where the people are allowed to vote for  their rulers. A good many others would like to be Supreme Dictator, but  as I made a law that I am always to count the votes myself, I am always  elected.\"    \"What is your name?\" asked Ozma.    \"I am called the Su-dic, which is short for Supreme Dictator. I sent  that man away because the moment you mentioned Ozma of Oz, and the  Emerald City, I knew who you are. I suppose I'm the only Flathead that  ever heard of you, but that's because I have more brains than the rest.\"    Dorothy was staring hard at the Su-dic.    \"I don't see how you can have any brains at all,\" she remarked,  \"because the part of your head is gone where brains are kept.\"    \"I don't blame you for thinking that,\" he said. \"Once the Flatheads had  no brains because, as you say, there is no upper part to their heads,  to hold brains. But long, long ago a band of fairies flew over this  country and made it all a fairyland, and when they came to the  Flatheads the fairies were sorry to find them all very stupid and quite  unable to think. So, as there was no good place in their bodies in  which to put brains the Fairy Queen gave each one of us a nice can of  brains to carry in his pocket and that made us just as intelligent as  other people. See,\" he continued, \"here is one of the cans of brains  the fairies gave us.\" He took from a pocket a bright tin can having a  pretty red label on it which said: \"Concentrated Brains, Extra Quality.\"    \"And does every Flathead have the same kind of brains?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Yes, they're all alike. Here's another can.\" From another pocket he  produced a second can of brains.    \"Did the fairies give you a double supply?\" inquired Dorothy.    \"No, but one of the Flatheads thought he wanted to be the Su-dic and  tried to get my people to rebel against me, so I punished him by taking  away his brains. One day my wife scolded me severely, so I took away  her can of brains. She didn't like that and went out and robbed several  women of their brains. Then I made a law that if anyone stole another's  brains, or even tried to borrow them, he would forfeit his own brains  to the Su-dic. So each one is content with his own canned brains and my  wife and I are the only ones on the mountain with more than one can. I  have three cans and that makes me very clever--so clever that I'm a  good Sorcerer, if I do say it myself. My poor wife had four cans of  brains and became a remarkable witch, but alas! that was before those  terrible enemies, the Skeezers, transformed her into a Golden Pig.\"    \"Good gracious!\" cried Dorothy; \"is your wife really a Golden Pig?\"    \"She is. The Skeezers did it and so I have declared war on them. In  revenge for making my wife a Pig I intend to ruin their Magic Island  and make the Skeezers the slaves of the Flatheads!\"    The Su-dic was very angry now; his eyes flashed and his face took on a  wicked and fierce expression. But Ozma said to him, very sweetly and in  a friendly voice:    \"I am sorry to hear this. Will you please tell me more about your  troubles with the Skeezers?  Then perhaps I can help you.\"    She was only a girl, but there was dignity in her pose and speech which  impressed the Su-dic.    \"If you are really Princess Ozma of Oz,\" the Flathead said, \"you are  one of that band of fairies who, under Queen Lurline, made all Oz a  Fairyland. I have heard that Lurline left one of her own fairies to  rule Oz, and gave the fairy the name of Ozma.\"    \"If you knew this why did you not come to me at the Emerald City and  tender me your loyalty and obedience?\" asked the Ruler of Oz.    \"Well, I only learned the fact lately, and I've been too busy to leave  home,\" he explained, looking at the floor instead of into Ozma's eyes.  She knew he had spoken a falsehood, but only said:    \"Why did you quarrel with the Skeezers?\"    \"It was this way,\" began the Su-dic, glad to change the subject. \"We  Flatheads love fish, and as we have no fish on this mountain we would  sometimes go to the Lake of the Skeezers to catch fish. This made the  Skeezers angry, for they declared the fish in their lake belonged to  them and were under their protection and they forbade us to catch them.  That was very mean and unfriendly in the Skeezers, you must admit, and  when we paid no attention to their orders they set a guard on the shore  of the lake to prevent our fishing.    \"Now, my wife, Rora Flathead, having four cans of brains, had become a  wonderful witch, and fish being brain food, she loved to eat fish  better than any one of us. So she vowed she would destroy every fish in  the lake, unless the Skeezers let us catch what we wanted. They defied  us, so Rora prepared a kettleful of magic poison and went down to the  lake one night to dump it all in the water and poison the fish. It was  a clever idea, quite worthy of my dear wife, but the Skeezer Queen--a  young lady named Coo-ee-oh--hid on the bank of the lake and taking Rora  unawares, transformed her into a Golden Pig. The poison was spilled on  the ground and wicked Queen Coo-ee-oh, not content with her cruel  transformation, even took away my wife's four cans of brains, so she is  now a common grunting pig without even brains enough to know her own  name.\"    \"Then,\" said Ozma thoughtfully, \"the Queen of the Skeezers must be a  Sorceress.\"    \"Yes,\" said the Su-dic, \"but she doesn't know much magic, after all.  She is not as powerful as Rora Flathead was, nor half as powerful as I  am now, as Queen Coo-ee-oh will discover when we fight our great battle  and destroy her.\"    \"The Golden Pig can't be a witch any more, of course,\" observed Dorothy.    \"No; even had Queen Coo-ee-oh left her the four cans of brains, poor  Rora, in a pig's shape, couldn't do any witchcraft. A witch has to use  her fingers, and a pig has only cloven hoofs.\"    \"It seems a sad story,\" was Ozma's comment, \"and all the trouble arose  because the Flatheads wanted fish that did not belong to them.\"    \"As for that,\" said the Su-dic, again angry, \"I made a law that any of  my people could catch fish in the Lake of the Skeezers, whenever they  wanted to. So the trouble was through the Skeezers defying my law.\"    \"You can only make laws to govern your own people,\" asserted Ozma  sternly. \"I, alone, am empowered to make laws that must be obeyed by  all the peoples of Oz.\"    \"Pooh!\" cried the Su-dic scornfully. \"You can't make me obey your laws,  I assure you. I know the extent of your powers, Princess Ozma of Oz,  and I know that I am more powerful than you are. To prove it I shall  keep you and your companion prisoners in this mountain until after we  have fought and conquered the Skeezers. Then, if you promise to be  good, I may let you go home again.\"    Dorothy was amazed by this effrontery and defiance of the beautiful  girl Ruler of Oz, whom all until now had obeyed without question. But  Ozma, still unruffled and dignified, looked at the Su-dic and said:    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9612"],[0,"The Botanic Garden (#6)"],[1,"cid, or from a new method of  forming nitrous acid by means of mangonese or other calciform ores, it  may probably in time be applied to move machinery, and supersede the use  of steam.    There is a bitter invective in Don Quixot against the inventors of gun-  powder, as it levels the strong with the weak, the knight cased in steel  with the naked shepherd, those who have been trained to the sword, with  those who are totally unskilful in the use of it; and throws down all  the splendid distinctions of mankind. These very reasons ought to have  been urged to shew that the discovery of gunpowder has been of public  utility by weakening the tyranny of the few over the many.]             VI. NYMPHS!

[_Delighted Savery_. l. 254. The invention of the steam-engine for  raising water by the pressure of the air in consequence of the  condensation of steam, is properly ascribed to Capt. Savery; a plate and  description of this machine is given in Harris's Lexicon Technicum, art.  Engine. Though the Marquis of Worcester in his Century of Inventions  printed in the year 1663 had described an engine for raising water by  the explosive power of steam long before Savery's. Mr. Desegulier  affirms, that Savery bought up all he could procure of the books of the  Marquis of Worcester, and destroyed them, professing himself then to  have discovered the power of steam by accident, which seems to have been  an unfounded slander. Savery applied it to the raising of water to  supply houses and gardens, but could not accomplish the draining of  mines by it. Which was afterwards done by Mr. Newcomen and Mr. John  Cowley at Dartmouth, in the year 1712, who added the piston.    A few years ago Mr. Watt of Glasgow much improved this machine, and with  Mr. Boulton of Birmingham has applied it to variety of purposes, such as  raising water from mines, blowing bellows to fuse the ore, supplying  towns with water, grinding corn and many other purposes. There is reason  to believe it may in time be applied to the rowing of barges, and the  moving of carriages along the road. As the specific levity of air is too  great for the support of great burthens by balloons, there seems no  probable method of flying conveniently but by the power of steam, or  some other explosive material; which another half century may probable  discover.

The benevolence of the great Author of  all things is greatly manifest in the sum of his works, as Dr. Balguy  has well evinced in his pamphlet on Divine Benevolence asserted, printed  for Davis, 1781. Yet if we may compare the parts of nature with each  other, there are some circumstances of her economy which seem to  contribute more to the general scale of happiness than others. Thus the  nourishment of animal bodies is derived from three sources: 1. the milk  given from the mother to the offspring; in this excellent contrivance  the mother has pleasure in affording the sustenance to the child, and  the child has pleasure in receiving it. 2. Another source of the food of  animals includes seeds or eggs; in these the embryon is in a torpid or  insensible state, and there is along with it laid up for its early  nourishment a store of provision, as the fruit belonging to some seeds,  and the oil and starch belonging to others; when these are consumed by  animals the unfeeling seed or egg receives no pain, but the animal  receives pleasure which consumes it. Under this article may be included  the bodies of animals which die naturally. 3. But the last method of  supporting animal bodies by the destruction of other living animals, as  lions preying upon lambs, these upon living vegetables, and mankind upon  them all, would appear to be a less perfect part of the economy of  nature than those before mentioned, as contributing less to the sum of  general happiness.]             \"Now his hard hands on Mona's rifted crest,  280  Bosom'd in rock, her azure ores arrest;       With iron lips his rapid rollers seize       The lengthening bars, in thin expansion squeeze;       Descending screws with ponderous fly-wheels wound       The tawny plates, the new medallions round;  285  Hard dyes of steel the cupreous circles cramp,       And with quick fall his massy hammers stamp.

[_So mighty Hercules_. l. 297. The story of Hercules seems of great  antiquity, as appears from the simplicity of his dress and armour, a  lion's skin and a club; and from the nature of many of his exploits, the  destruction of wild beasts and robbers. This part of the history of  Hercules seems to have related to times before the invention of the bow  and arrow, or of spinning flax. Other stories of Hercules are perhaps of  later date, and appear to be allegorical, as his conquering the river-  god Achilous, and bringing Cerberus up to day light; the former might  refer to his turning the course of a river, and draining a morass, and  the latter to his exposing a part of the superstition of the times. The  strangling the lion and tearing his jaws asunder, are described from a  statue in the Museum Florentinum, and from an antique gem; and the  grasping Anteus to death in his arms as he lifts him from the earth, is  described from another antient cameo. The famous pillars of Hercules  have been variously explained. Pliny asserts that the natives of Spain  and of Africa believed that the mountains of Abyla and Calpe on each  side of the straits of Gibraltar were the pillars of Hercules; and that  they were reared by the hands of that god, and the sea admitted between  them. Plin. Hist. Nat. p. 46. Edit. Manut. Venet. 1609.    If the passage between the two continents was opened by an earthquake in  antient times, as this allegorical story would seem to countenance,  there must have been an immense current of water at first run into the  Mediterranean from the Atlantic; since there is at present a strong  stream sets always from thence into the Mediterranean.
