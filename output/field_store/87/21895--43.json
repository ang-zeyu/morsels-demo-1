Cut up four flounders, or half a dozen perch, two onions, and a  bunch of parsley. Put them into three quarts of water, and boil  them till the fish go entirely to pieces, and dissolve in the  water. Then strain the liquor through a sieve, and put it into a  kettle or stew-pan. Have ready a few more fish with the heads,  tails, and fins removed, and the brown skin taken off. Cut little  notches in them, and lay them for a short time in very cold water.  Then put them into the stew-pan with the liquor or soup-stock of  the first fish. Season with pepper, salt, and mace, and add half a  pint of white wine or two table-spoonfuls of vinegar. Boil it  gently for a quarter of an hour, and skim it well.    Provide some parsley roots, cut into slices and boiled till very  tender; and also a quantity of parsley leaves boiled nice and  green. After the fish-pan has boiled moderately fifteen minutes,  take it off the fire, and put in the parsley roots; also a little  mushroom catchup.    Take out the fish and lay them in a broad deep dish, or in a  tureen, and then pour on the soup very gently for fear of breaking  them. Strew the green parsley leaves over the top. Have ready  plates of bread and butter, which it is customary to eat with  water souchy.    You may omit the wine or vinegar, and flavour the soup just before  you take it from the fire with essence of anchovy, or with any  other of the essences and compound fish-sauces that are in general  use.    Water souchy (commonly pronounced _sookey_) is a Dutch soup.  It may be made of any sort of small fish; but flounders and perch  are generally used for it. It is very good made of carp.          FISH.      REMARKS.    In choosing fresh fish, select only those that are thick and firm,  with bright scales and stiff fins; the gills a very lively red,  and the eyes full and prominent. In the summer, as soon as they  are brought home, clean them, and put them in ice till you are  ready to cook them; and even then do not attempt to keep a fresh  fish till next day. Mackerel cannot be cooked too soon, as they  spoil more readily than any other fish.    Oysters in the shell may be kept from a week to a fortnight, by  the following process. Cover them with water, and wash them clean  with a birch broom. Then lay them with the deep or concave part of  the shell undermost, and sprinkle each of them well with salt and  Indian meal. Fill up the tub with cold water. Repeat this every  day; first pouring off the liquid of the day before.    The tub must stand all the time in a cool cellar, and be covered  well with an old blanket, carpeting, or something of the sort.    If carefully attended to, oysters kept in this manner will not  only live but fatten.    It is customary to eat fish only at the commencement of the  dinner. Fish and soup are generally served up alone, before any of  the other dishes appear, and with no vegetable but potatoes; it  being considered a solecism in good taste to accompany them with  any of the other productions of the garden except a little horseradish,  parsley, &c. as garnishing.    In England, and at the most fashionable tables in America, bread  only is eaten with fish. To this rule salt cod is an exception.      TO BOIL FRESH SALMON    Scale and clean the fish, handling it as little as possible, and  cutting it open no more than is absolutely necessary. Place it on  the strainer of a large fish-kettle and fill it up with cold  water. Throw in a handful of salt. Let it boil slowly. The length  of time depends on the size and weight of the fish. You may allow  a quarter of an hour to each pound; but experience alone can  determine the exact time. It must however be thoroughly done, as  nothing is more disgusting than fish that is under-cooked. You may  try it with a fork. Skim it well or the colour will be bad.    The minute it is completely boiled, lift up the strainer and rest  it across the top of the kettle, that the fish may drain, and  then, if you cannot send it to table immediately, cover it with a  soft napkin or flannel several folds double, to keep it firm by  absorbing the moisture.    Send it to table on a hot dish. Garnish with scraped horseradish  and curled parsley. Have ready a small tureen of lobster sauce to  accompany the salmon.    Take what is left of it after dinner, and put it into a deep dish  with a close cover. Having saved some of the water in which the  fish was boiled, take a quart of it, and season it with half an  ounce of whole pepper, and half an ounce of whole allspice, half a  pint of the best vinegar, and a tea-spoonful of salt. Boil it; and  when cold, pour it over the fish, and cover it closely again. In a  cold place, and set on ice, it will keep a day or two, and may be  eaten at breakfast or supper.    If much of the salmon has been left, you must proportion a larger  quantity of the pickle.    Boil salmon trout in a similar manner.      TO BAKE FRESH SALMON WHOLE    Having cleaned a small or moderate sized salmon, season it with  salt, pepper, and powdered mace rubbed on it both outside and in.  Skewer it with the tail turned round and put to the mouth. Lay it  on a stand or trivet in a deep dish or pan, and stick it over with  bits of butter rolled in flour. Put it into the oven, and baste it  occasionally, while baking, with its own drippings.    Garnish it with horseradish and sprigs of curled parsley, laid  alternately round the edge of the dish; and send to table with it  a small tureen of lobster sauce.    Salmon trout may be drest in the same manner.      SALMON BAKED IN SLICES.    Take out the bone and cut the flesh into slices. Season them with  cayenne and salt. Melt two ounces of butter that has been rolled  in flour, in a half pint of water, and mix with it two large  glasses of port wine, two table-spoonfuls of catchup, and two  anchovies. This allowance is for a small quantity of salmon. For a  large dish you must proportion the ingredients accordingly. Let  the anchovies remain in the liquid till they are dissolved. Then  strain it and pour it over the slices of salmon. Tie a sheet of  buttered paper over the dish, and put it into the oven.    You may bake trout or carp in the same manner.      SALMON STEAKS    Split the salmon and take out the bone as nicely as possible,  without mangling the flesh. Then cut it into fillets or steaks  about an inch thick. Dry them lightly in a cloth, and dredge them  with flour. Take care not to squeeze or press them. Have ready  some clear bright coals, such as are fit for beef-steaks. Let the  gridiron be clean and bright, and rub the bars with chalk to  prevent the fish from sticking. Broil the slices thoroughly,  turning them with steak tongs. Send them to table hot, wrapped in  the folds of a napkin that has been heated. Serve up with them  anchovy, or prawn, or lobster sauce.    Many epicures consider this the best way of cooking salmon.    Another way, perhaps still nicer, is to take some pieces of white  paper and butter them well. Wrap in each a slice of salmon,  securing the paper around them, with a string or pins. Lay them on  a gridiron, and broil them over a clear but moderate fire, till  thoroughly done. Take off the paper, and send the cutlets to table  hot, garnished with fried parsley.    Serve up with them prawn or lobster sauce in a boat.      PICKLED SALMON.    Take a fine fresh salmon, and having cleaned it, cut it into large  pieces, and boil it in salted water as if for eating. Then drain  it, wrap it in a dry cloth, and set it in a cold place till next  day. Then make the pickle, which must be in proportion to the  quantity of fish. To one quart of the water in which the salmon  was boiled, allow two quarts of the best vinegar, one ounce of  whole black pepper, one ounce of whole allspice, and a dozen  blades of mace. Boil all these together in a kettle closely  covered to prevent the flavour from evaporating. When the vinegar  thus prepared is quite cold, pour it over the salmon, and put on  the top a table-spoonful of sweet oil, which will make it keep the  longer.    Cover it closely, put it in a dry cool place, and it will be good  for many months.    This is the nicest way of preserving salmon, and is approved by  all who have tried it. Garnish with fennel.      SMOKED SALMON.    Cut the fish up the back; clean, and scale it, and take out the  roe, but do not wash it. Take the bone neatly out. Rub it well  inside and out with a mixture of salt and fine Havanna sugar, in  equal quantities, and a small portion of saltpetre. Cover the fish  with a board on which weights are placed to press it down, and let  it lie thus for two days and two nights. Drain it from the salt,  wipe it dry, stretch it open, and fasten it so with pieces of  stick. Then hang it up and smoke it over a wood fire. It will be  smoked sufficiently in five or six days.    When you wish to eat it, cut off slices, soak them awhile in  lukewarm water, and broil them for breakfast.      TO BOIL HALIBUT.    Halibut is seldom cooked whole; a piece weighing from four to six  pounds being generally thought sufficient. Score deeply the skin  of the back, and when you put it into the kettle lay it on the  strainer with the back undermost. Cover it with cold water, and  throw in a handful of salt. Do not let it come to a boil too fast.  Skim it carefully, and when it has boiled hard a few minutes, hang  the kettle higher, or diminish the fire under it, so as to let it  simmer for about twenty-five or thirty minutes. Then drain it, and  send it to table, garnished with alternate heaps of grated horseradish  and curled parsley, and accompanied by a boat of egg-sauce.    What is left of the halibut, you may prepare for the supper-table  by mincing it when cold, and seasoning it with a dressing of salt,  cayenne, sweet oil, hard-boiled yolk of egg, and a large  proportion of vinegar.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9628"],[0,"Buried Cities: Pompeii, Olympia, Mycenae (Complete) (#6)"],[1,"es.\"    After you leave the baths perhaps you will turn down Stabian Street. It  has narrow sidewalks. The broken walls of houses fence it in closely  on both sides and cast black shadows across it. It is paved with clean  blocks of lava. You will see wheel ruts worn deep in the hard stone.  Almost two thousand years old they are, made by the carts of the  farmers, perhaps, who brought in vegetables for the market. At the  street crossings you will see three or four big stone blocks standing  up above the pavement. They are stepping-stones for rainy weather.  Evidently floods used to pour down these sloping streets. You can  imagine little Roman boys skipping across from block to block and trying  to keep their sandals dry.    The street will lead you to the district of good houses where the  wealthy men lived. Through open doorways you will get glimpses into the  old ruined courtyards. It is hard guessing how the rooms used to look.  But when you come to the door of the house of Vettius you will cry out  with wonder. There is a lovely garden in the corner of the house. A long  passage leads to it straight from the street. Around it runs a paved  porch with pretty columns. Here you will walk in the shade and look out  at the gay little garden, blooming in the sunshine. In every corner tiny  streams of water spurt from little statues of bronze and marble and  trickle into cool basins. Marble tables stand among the flowers. You  will half expect a slave to bring out old drinking cups and wine bowls  and set them here for his master's pleasure, or tablets and stylus for  him to write his letters. Everything is in order and beautiful. It was  not quite so when the excavators uncovered this house. The statues were  thrown down. The flowers were scorched and dead under the piled-up  ashes. But it was easy for the modern excavators to tell from the ground  where the flower beds had been and where the gravel paths. Even the  lead water pipe that carried the stream to the fountain needed little  repairing. So the excavators set up the statues, cleaned the marble  tables and benches, planted shrubs and flowers, repaired the porch roof,  and we have a garden such as the old Romans loved and such as many  houses in Pompeii had.    Several rooms look out upon this garden. One of them is perhaps the most  interesting place in all Pompeii. You will walk into it and look around  and laugh with delight. The whole wall is painted with pictures, big and  little--pictures of columns and roofs, of plants and animals, of men  and gods. They are all framed in with wide spaces of beautiful red. And  tucked away between them in narrow bands of black are the gayest little  scenes in the world. They are worth going all the way across the ocean  to see. Psyches--delicate little winged girls like fairies--are picking  slender flowers and putting them into tall, graceful baskets. They are  so light and so tiny that they seem to be flitting along the wall  like bright butterflies. In other panels plump little cupids--winged  boys--are playing at being men. They are picking grapes and working a  wine press and selling wine. It is big work for tiny creatures, and they  must kick up their dimpled legs and puff out their chubby cheeks to do  it. They are melting gold and carrying gold dishes and selling jewelry  and swinging a blacksmith's hammer with their fat little arms. They are  carrying roses to market on a ragged goat and weaving rose garlands and  selling them to an elegant little lady. Everywhere these gay little  creatures are skipping about at their play among the beautiful red  spaces and large pictures. This was surely a charming dining room in the  old days. The guests must have been merry every time their eyes lighted  upon the bright wall. And if they looked out at the open side, there  smiled the garden with its flowers and statues and splashing fountains  and columns.    There lived in this house two men by the name of Vettius. We know this  because the excavators found here two seals. In those days men fastened  their letters and receipts and bills with wax. While the wax was soft  they stamped their names in it with a metal seal. On the stamps that  were found in this house were carved Aulus Vettius Restitutus and Aulus  Vettius Conviva. Perhaps they were freedmen who once had been slaves of  Aulus Vettius. But they must have earned a fortune for themselves, for  there were two money chests in the house. And they must have had slaves  of their own to take care of their twenty rooms and more. In the tiny  kitchen the excavators found a good store of charcoal and the ashes of  a little fire on top of the stone stove. And on its three little legs  a bronze dish was sitting over the dead fire. A slave must have been  cooking his master's dinner when the volcano frightened him away.    Vettius' dining room is empty of its wooden tables and couches. But some  houses had stone ones built in their gardens for pleasant summer days.  These the ashes did not crush, and they are still in place. Columns  stood about the tables and vines climbed up them and across to make cool  shade. The tables were always long and narrow and built around three  sides of a rectangle. Low couches stand along the outside edges. Here  guests used to lie propped up on their left elbows with pretty cushions  to make them comfortable. In the open space in the middle of the square  servants came and went and passed the dishes across the narrow tables.  Children used to have little wooden stools and sit in this middle space  opposite their elders. But in one old ruined garden dining room you will  see a little stone bench for the children, built along the end of the  table. It must have been pleasant to have supper there with the sunset  coloring the sky, behind old Vesuvius, the cool breeze shaking the  leaves of the garden shrubs, and the fountain tinkling, and a bird  chirping in a corner, and the shadows beginning to creep under the long  porches, and the tiny flames of lamps fluttering in the dusky rooms  behind.    After you leave the house of Vettius and walk down the street, you will  come to a certain door. In the sidewalk before it you will see \"Have\"  spelled with bits of colored marble. It is the old Latin word for  \"Welcome.\" It is too pleasant an invitation to refuse. Go in through  the high doorway and down the narrow passage to the atrium. Every Roman  house had this atrium. It is like a large reception hall with many  rooms opening off it--bedrooms, dining rooms, sitting rooms. Beautiful  hangings instead of doors used to shut these rooms in. The atrium had an  opening in the roof where the sun shone in and softly lighted the big  room. Here the master used to receive his guests. In the house of  Vettius the two money chests were found in the atrium. In this same room  in the house of \"Welcome,\" there was found on the floor a little bronze  statue, a dancing faun, one of the gay friends of Dionysus. It is a tiny  thing only two feet high, but so pretty that the excavators named the  house after it--The House of the Faun. Evidently the old owner loved  beautiful things and had money to buy them. Even the floors of some of  his rooms are made in mosaic pictures. There are doves at play, and  ducks and fish and shells all laid under your feet in bright bits of  colored marble. And beyond the pleasant court with its porches and  garden is a large sitting room. In the floor of this the excavators  found the most wonderful mosaic picture of all, a picture of a battle,  with waving spears and prancing horses and fallen men. Two kings are  facing each other to fight--Darius, king of Persia, standing in his  chariot, and Alexander, king of Greece, riding his war horse. The bits  of stone are so small and of such perfect color that the mosaic looks  like a beautiful painting. Imagine how the excavators' hearts leaped  when the spades took the gray ashes off this bright picture. It was too  precious a thing to leave here in the rain and wind. So the excavators  carefully took it up and put it into the museum of Naples where there  are other valuable things from Pompeii.    There are many other houses almost as pleasant and beautiful as this  House of the Faun. Every one has its atrium and its sunny court and its  fountains and statues and its painted walls. But Pompeii was a city of  business, too, and had many workshops. There is a dye shop where the  excavators found large lead pots and glass bottles still full of dye.  There are cleaners' shops where the slaves used to take their masters'  robes to be cleaned. Here the excavators found vats and white clay  for cleaning, and pictures on the wall showing men at work. There are  tanneries where leather was made. The rusted tools were found which the  men had thrown down so long ago. There is a pottery shop with two ovens  for baking the vases. On a certain street corner you will see an old  wine shop. It is a little room cut into the corner wall of a great  house. Its two sides are open upon the street with broad marble  counters. Below the counters are big, deep jars. Their open tops thrust  themselves through the slab. You can look into their mouths where the  shopkeeper used to dip out the wine. On the walls of the room are marks  that show where shelves hung in ancient days to hold cups and glasses.  In the outer edge of the sidewalk before the shop are two round holes  cut into the stone. Long ago poles were thrust into them to hold an  awning that shaded the walk in front of the counters. We can imagine men  stopping in this pleasant shade as they passed. The busy slave inside  the shop whips out a cup and a graceful, long-handled ladle and dips out  the sweet-smelling wine from the wide-mouthed jar. And we can imagine  how the cups fell clattering from the men's hands when Vesuvius  thundered. In one shop, indeed, the excavators found an overturned cup  on the counter and a wine stain on the"]]]
