[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7244"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 3. (#6)"],[1," It was of  a piece with the general simplicity of the country.    The sun was now setting.  It was about three in the afternoon when  Alisande had begun to tell me who the cowboys were; so she had made  pretty good progress with it--for her.  She would arrive some time  or other, no doubt, but she was not a person who could be hurried.    We were approaching a castle which stood on high ground; a huge,  strong, venerable structure, whose gray towers and battlements were  charmingly draped with ivy, and whose whole majestic mass was  drenched with splendors flung from the sinking sun.  It was the  largest castle we had seen, and so I thought it might be the one  we were after, but Sandy said no.  She did not know who owned it;  she said she had passed it without calling, when she went down  to Camelot.        CHAPTER XVI    MORGAN LE FAY    If knights errant were to be believed, not all castles were desirable  places to seek hospitality in.  As a matter of fact, knights errant  were _not_ persons to be believed--that is, measured by modern  standards of veracity; yet, measured by the standards of their own  time, and scaled accordingly, you got the truth.  It was very  simple: you discounted a statement ninety-seven per cent; the rest  was fact.  Now after making this allowance, the truth remained  that if I could find out something about a castle before ringing  the door-bell--I mean hailing the warders--it was the sensible  thing to do.  So I was pleased when I saw in the distance a horseman  making the bottom turn of the road that wound down from this castle.    As we approached each other, I saw that he wore a plumed helmet,  and seemed to be otherwise clothed in steel, but bore a curious  addition also--a stiff square garment like a herald's tabard.  However, I had to smile at my own forgetfulness when I got nearer  and read this sign on his tabard:      \"Persimmon's Soap -- All the Prime-Donna Use It.\"    That was a little idea of my own, and had several wholesome purposes  in view toward the civilizing and uplifting of this nation.  In the  first place, it was a furtive, underhand blow at this nonsense  of knight errantry, though nobody suspected that but me.  I had  started a number of these people out--the bravest knights I could  get--each sandwiched between bulletin-boards bearing one device  or another, and I judged that by and by when they got to be numerous  enough they would begin to look ridiculous; and then, even the  steel-clad ass that _hadn't_ any board would himself begin to look  ridiculous because he was out of the fashion.    Secondly, these missionaries would gradually, and without creating  suspicion or exciting alarm, introduce a rudimentary cleanliness  among the nobility, and from them it would work down to the people,  if the priests could be kept quiet.  This would undermine the Church.  I mean would be a step toward that.  Next, education--next, freedom  --and then she would begin to crumble.  It being my conviction that  any Established Church is an established crime, an established  slave-pen, I had no scruples, but was willing to assail it in  any way or with any weapon that promised to hurt it.  Why, in my  own former day--in remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb  of time--there were old Englishmen who imagined that they had been  born in a free country: a \"free\" country with the Corporation Act  and the Test still in force in it--timbers propped against men's  liberties and dishonored consciences to shore up an Established  Anachronism with.    My missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their  tabards--the showy gilding was a neat idea, I could have got the  king to wear a bulletin-board for the sake of that barbaric  splendor--they were to spell out these signs and then explain to  the lords and ladies what soap was; and if the lords and ladies  were afraid of it, get them to try it on a dog.  The missionary's  next move was to get the family together and try it on himself;  he was to stop at no experiment, however desperate, that could  convince the nobility that soap was harmless; if any final doubt  remained, he must catch a hermit--the woods were full of them;  saints they called themselves, and saints they were believed to be.  They were unspeakably holy, and worked miracles, and everybody  stood in awe of them.  If a hermit could survive a wash, and that  failed to convince a duke, give him up, let him alone.    Whenever my missionaries overcame a knight errant on the road  they washed him, and when he got well they swore him to go and  get a bulletin-board and disseminate soap and civilization the rest  of his days.  As a consequence the workers in the field were  increasing by degrees, and the reform was steadily spreading.  My soap factory felt the strain early.  At first I had only two  hands; but before I had left home I was already employing fifteen,  and running night and day; and the atmospheric result was getting  so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping  around and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer,  and Sir Launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up  and down the roof and swear, although I told him it was worse up  there than anywhere else, but he said he wanted plenty of air; and  he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap  factory anyway, and said if a man was to start one in his house  he would be damned if he wouldn't strangle him.  There were ladies  present, too, but much these people ever cared for that; they would  swear before children, if the wind was their way when the factory  was going.    This missionary knight's name was La Cote Male Taile, and he said  that this castle was the abode of Morgan le Fay, sister of  King Arthur, and wife of King Uriens, monarch of a realm about  as big as the District of Columbia--you could stand in the middle  of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom.  \"Kings\" and \"Kingdoms\"  were as thick in Britain as they had been in little Palestine in  Joshua's time, when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up  because they couldn't stretch out without a passport.    La Cote was much depressed, for he had scored here the worst  failure of his campaign.  He had not worked off a cake; yet he had  tried all the tricks of the trade, even to the washing of a hermit;  but the hermit died.  This was, indeed, a bad failure, for this  animal would now be dubbed a martyr, and would take his place  among the saints of the Roman calendar.  Thus made he his moan,  this poor Sir La Cote Male Taile, and sorrowed passing sore.  And  so my heart bled for him, and I was moved to comfort and stay him.  Wherefore I said:    \"Forbear to grieve, fair knight, for this is not a defeat.  We have  brains, you and I; and for such as have brains there are no defeats,  but only victories.  Observe how we will turn this seeming disaster  into an advertisement; an advertisement for our soap; and the  biggest one, to draw, that was ever thought of; an advertisement  that will transform that Mount Washington defeat into a Matterhorn  victory.  We will put on your bulletin-board, '_Patronized by the  elect_.'  How does that strike you?\"    \"Verily, it is wonderly bethought!\"    \"Well, a body is bound to admit that for just a modest little  one-line ad, it's a corker.\"    So the poor colporteur's griefs vanished away.  He was a brave  fellow, and had done mighty feats of arms in his time.  His chief  celebrity rested upon the events of an excursion like this one  of mine, which he had once made with a damsel named Maledisant,  who was as handy with her tongue as was Sandy, though in a different  way, for her tongue churned forth only railings and insult, whereas  Sandy's music was of a kindlier sort.  I knew his story well, and so  I knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he  bade me farewell.  He supposed I was having a bitter hard time of it.    Sandy and I discussed his story, as we rode along, and she said  that La Cote's bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that  trip; for the king's fool had overthrown him on the first day,  and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the  conqueror, but Maledisant didn't do it; and also persisted afterward  in sticking to him, after all his defeats.  But, said I, suppose  the victor should decline to accept his spoil?  She said that that  wouldn't answer--he must.  He couldn't decline; it wouldn't be  regular.  I made a note of that.  If Sandy's music got to be too  burdensome, some time, I would let a knight defeat me, on the chance  that she would desert to him.    In due time we were challenged by the warders, from the castle  walls, and after a parley admitted.  I have nothing pleasant to  tell about that visit.  But it was not a disappointment, for I knew  Mrs. le Fay by reputation, and was not expecting anything pleasant.  She was held in awe by the whole realm, for she had made everybody  believe she was a great sorceress.  All her ways were wicked, all  her instincts devilish.  She was loaded to the eyelids with cold  malice.  All her history was black with crime; and among her crimes  murder was common.  I was most curious to see her; as curious as  I could have been to see Satan.  To my surprise she was beautiful;  black thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive, age  had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its bloomy freshness.  She could have passed for old Uriens' granddaughter, she could  have been mistaken for sister to her own son.    As soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered  into her presence.  King Uriens was there, a kind-faced old man  with a subdued look; and also the son, Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains,  in whom I was, of course, interested on account of the tradition  that he had once done battle with thirty knights, and also on  account of his trip with Sir Gawaine and Sir Marhaus, which Sandy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7245"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 4. (#6)"],[1," \"Blank-blank-blank him,\" said Sir Madok, \"an I do not stove-polish  him an I may find him, leave it to me; for never no knight that  hight Ossaise or aught else may do me this disservice and bide  on live, an I may find him, the which I have thereunto sworn a  great oath this day.\"    And with these words and others, he lightly took his spear and  gat him thence.  In the middle of the afternoon we came upon one  of those very patriarchs ourselves, in the edge of a poor village.  He was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not  seen for fifty years; and about him and caressing him were also  descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now;  but to him these were all strangers, his memory was gone, his mind  was stagnant.  It seemed incredible that a man could outlast half  a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat, but here were his old  wife and some old comrades to testify to it.  They could remember  him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood,  when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mother's hands  and went away into that long oblivion.  The people at the castle  could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man  had been shut up there for his unrecorded and forgotten offense;  but this old wife knew; and so did her old child, who stood there  among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father  who had been to her a name, a thought, a formless image, a tradition,  all her life, and now was suddenly concreted into actual flesh  and blood and set before her face.    It was a curious situation; yet it is not on that account that  I have made room for it here, but on account of a thing which  seemed to me still more curious.  To wit, that this dreadful matter  brought from these downtrodden people no outburst of rage against  these oppressors.  They had been heritors and subjects of cruelty  and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but  a kindness.  Yes, here was a curious revelation, indeed, of the  depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery.  Their entire  being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of patience, resignation,  dumb uncomplaining acceptance of whatever might befall them in  this life.  Their very imagination was dead.  When you can say  that of a man, he has struck bottom, I reckon; there is no lower  deep for him.    I rather wished I had gone some other road.  This was not the sort  of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out  a peaceful revolution in his mind.  For it could not help bringing  up the unget-aroundable fact that, all gentle cant and philosophizing  to the contrary notwithstanding, no people in the world ever did  achieve their freedom by goody-goody talk and moral suasion:  it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must  _begin_ in blood, whatever may answer afterward.  If history teaches  anything, it teaches that.  What this folk needed, then, was a  Reign of Terror and a guillotine, and I was the wrong man for them.    Two days later, toward noon, Sandy began to show signs of excitement  and feverish expectancy.  She said we were approaching the ogre's  castle.  I was surprised into an uncomfortable shock.  The object  of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind; this sudden  resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing  for a moment, and roused up in me a smart interest.  Sandy's  excitement increased every moment; and so did mine, for that sort  of thing is catching.  My heart got to thumping.  You can't reason  with your heart; it has its own laws, and thumps about things which  the intellect scorns.  Presently, when Sandy slid from the horse,  motioned me to stop, and went creeping stealthily, with her head  bent nearly to her knees, toward a row of bushes that bordered  a declivity, the thumpings grew stronger and quicker.  And they  kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse  over the declivity; and also while I was creeping to her side on  my knees.  Her eyes were burning now, as she pointed with her  finger, and said in a panting whisper:    \"The castle!  The castle!  Lo, where it looms!\"    What a welcome disappointment I experienced!  I said:    \"Castle?  It is nothing but a pigsty; a pigsty with a wattled  fence around it.\"    She looked surprised and distressed.  The animation faded out of  her face; and during many moments she was lost in thought and  silent.  Then:    \"It was not enchanted aforetime,\" she said in a musing fashion,  as if to herself.  \"And how strange is this marvel, and how awful  --that to the one perception it is enchanted and dight in a base  and shameful aspect; yet to the perception of the other it is not  enchanted, hath suffered no change, but stands firm and stately  still, girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air  from its towers.  And God shield us, how it pricks the heart to  see again these gracious captives, and the sorrow deepened in their  sweet faces!  We have tarried along, and are to blame.\"    I saw my cue.  The castle was enchanted to _me_, not to her. It would  be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion, it couldn't  be done; I must just humor it.  So I said:    \"This is a common case--the enchanting of a thing to one eye and  leaving it in its proper form to another.  You have heard of it  before, Sandy, though you haven't happened to experience it.  But no harm is done.  In fact, it is lucky the way it is.  If these  ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves, it would be  necessary to break the enchantment, and that might be impossible  if one failed to find out the particular process of the enchantment.  And hazardous, too; for in attempting a disenchantment without the  true key, you are liable to err, and turn your hogs into dogs,  and the dogs into cats, the cats into rats, and so on, and end by  reducing your materials to nothing finally, or to an odorless gas  which you can't follow--which, of course, amounts to the same  thing.  But here, by good luck, no one's eyes but mine are under  the enchantment, and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it.  These ladies remain ladies to you, and to themselves, and to  everybody else; and at the same time they will suffer in no way  from my delusion, for when I know that an ostensible hog is a  lady, that is enough for me, I know how to treat her.\"    \"Thanks, oh, sweet my lord, thou talkest like an angel.  And I know  that thou wilt deliver them, for that thou art minded to great  deeds and art as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to will  and to do, as any that is on live.\"    \"I will not leave a princess in the sty, Sandy.  Are those three  yonder that to my disordered eyes are starveling swine-herds--\"    \"The ogres, Are _they_ changed also?  It is most wonderful.  Now  am I fearful; for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of  their nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible?  Ah, go warily,  fair sir; this is a mightier emprise than I wend.\"    \"You be easy, Sandy.  All I need to know is, how _much_ of an ogre  is invisible; then I know how to locate his vitals.  Don't you be  afraid, I will make short work of these bunco-steerers.  Stay  where you are.\"    I left Sandy kneeling there, corpse-faced but plucky and hopeful,  and rode down to the pigsty, and struck up a trade with the  swine-herds.  I won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs  at the lump sum of sixteen pennies, which was rather above latest  quotations.  I was just in time; for the Church, the lord of the  manor, and the rest of the tax-gatherers would have been along  next day and swept off pretty much all the stock, leaving the  swine-herds very short of hogs and Sandy out of princesses.  But  now the tax people could be paid in cash, and there would be  a stake left besides.  One of the men had ten children; and he  said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took  the fattest one for tithes, the wife burst out upon him, and offered  him a child and said:    \"Thou beast without bowels of mercy, why leave me my child, yet  rob me of the wherewithal to feed it?\"    How curious.  The same thing had happened in the Wales of my day,  under this same old Established Church, which was supposed by many  to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise.    I sent the three men away, and then opened the sty gate and beckoned  Sandy to come--which she did; and not leisurely, but with the rush  of a prairie fire.  And when I saw her fling herself upon those  hogs, with tears of joy running down her cheeks, and strain them  to her heart, and kiss them, and caress them, and call them  reverently by grand princely names, I was ashamed of her, ashamed  of the human race.    We had to drive those hogs home--ten miles; and no ladies were  ever more fickle-minded or contrary.  They would stay in no road,  no path; they broke out through the brush on all sides, and flowed  away in all directions, over rocks, and hills, and the roughest  places they could find.  And they must not be struck, or roughly  accosted; Sandy could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming  their rank.  The troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called  my Lady, and your Highness, like the rest.  It is annoying and  difficult to scour around after hogs, in armor.  There was one  small countess, with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair  on her back, that was the devil for perversity.  She gave me a race  of an hour, over all sorts of country, and then we were right where  we had started from, having made not a rod of real progress.  I seized her at last by the tail, and brought her along squealing.  When I overtook Sandy she was horrified, and said it was in the  last degree indelicate to drag a countess by her train.    We got the hogs home just at dark--most of them.  The princess  Nerovens de Morganore was missing, and two"]]]
