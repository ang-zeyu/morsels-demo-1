[In the city of New Orleans, in 1866, two thousand two hundred and  sixty-six ex-slaves were recruited for the service. None but the  largest and blackest Negroes were accepted. From these were formed  the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Infantry, and the Ninth and Tenth  Cavalry. All four are famous fighting regiments, yet the two cavalry  commands have earned the proudest distinction. While the record of the  Ninth Cavalry, better known as the \"Nigger Ninth,\" in its thirty-two  years of service in the Indian wars, in the military history of the  border, stands without a peer; and is, without exception, the most  famous fighting regiment in the United States service.]--Author.    [Illustration: COLONEL THEODORE B. ROOSEVELT.]          CHAPTER IV.      COLONEL THEODORE B. ROOSEVELT, NOW GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, WHO LED THE  ROUGH RIDERS, TELLS OF THE BRAVERY OF NEGRO SOLDIERS.      When Colonel Theodore Roosevelt returned from the command of the  famous Rough Riders, he delivered a farewell address to his men,  in which he made the following kind reference to the gallant Negro  soldiers:    \"Now, I want to say just a word more to some of the men I see standing  around not of your number. I refer to the colored regiments, who  occupied the right and left flanks of us at Guasimas, the Ninth and  Tenth cavalry regiments. The Spaniards called them 'Smoked Yankees,'  but we found them to be an excellent breed of Yankees. I am sure that  I speak the sentiments of officers and men in the assemblage when I  say that between you and the other cavalry regiments there exists a  tie which we trust will never be broken.\"--_Colored American_.           *       *       *       *       *    The foregoing compliments to the Negro soldiers by Colonel Roosevelt  started up an avalanche of additional praise for them, out of which  the fact came, that but for the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry (colored)  coming up at Las Guasimas, destroying the Spanish block house and  driving the Spaniards off, when Roosevelt and his men had been caught  in a trap, with a barbed-wire fence on one side and a precipice on  the other, not only the brave Capron and Fish, but the whole of his  command would have been annihilated by the Spanish sharp-shooters, who  were firing with smokeless powder under cover, and picking off the  Rough Riders one by one, who could not see the Spaniards. To break the  force of this unfavorable comment on the Rough Riders, it is claimed  that Colonel Roosevelt made the following criticism of the colored  soldiers in general and of a few of them in particular, in an article  written by him for the April Scribner; and a letter replying to  the Colonel's strictures, follows by Sergeant Holliday, who was an  \"eye-witness\" to the incident:    Colonel Roosevelt's criticism was, in substance, that colored  soldiers were of no avail without white officers; that when the white  commissioned officers are killed or disabled, colored non-commissioned  officers could not be depended upon to keep up a charge already begun;  that about a score of colored infantrymen, who had drifted into his  command, weakened on the hill at San Juan under the galling Spanish  fire, and started to the rear, stating that they intended finding  their regiments, or to assist the wounded; whereupon he drew his  revolver and ordered them to return to ranks and there remain, and  that he would shoot the first man who didn't obey him; and that after  that he had no further trouble.    Colonel Roosevelt is sufficiently answered in the following letter of  Sergeant Holliday, and the point especially made by many eye-witnesses  (white) who were engaged in that fight is, as related in Chapter V, of  this book, that the Negro troops made the charges both at San Juan and  El Caney after nearly all their officers had been killed or wounded.  Upon what facts, therefore, does Colonel Roosevelt base his  conclusions that Negro soldiers will not fight without commissioned  officers, when the only real test of this question happened around  Santiago and showed just the contrary of what he states? We prefer  to take the results at El Caney and San Juan as against Colonel  Roosevelt's imagination.    COLONEL ROOSEVELT'S ERROR.    TRUE STORY OF THE INCIDENT HE MAGNIFIED TO OUR HURT--THE WHITE  OFFICERS' HUMBUG SKINNED OF ITS HIDE BY SERGEANT HOLLIDAY--UNWRITTEN  HISTORY.    _To the Editor of the New York Age_:    Having read in _The Age_ of April 13 an editorial entitled \"Our Troops  in Cuba,\" which brings to my notice for the first time a statement  made by Colonel Roosevelt, which, though in some parts true, if read  by those who do not know the exact facts and circumstances surrounding  the case, will certainly give rise to the wrong impression of colored  men as soldiers, and hurt them for many a day to come, and as I was  an eye-witness to the most important incidents mentioned in that  statement, I deem it a duty I owe, not only to the fathers, mothers,  sisters and brothers of those soldiers, and to the soldiers  themselves, but to their posterity and the race in general, to be  always ready to make an unprejudiced refutation of such charges, and  to do all in my power to place the colored soldier where he properly  belongs--among the bravest and most trustworthy of this land.    In the beginning, I wish to say that from what I saw of Colonel  Roosevelt in Cuba, and the impression his frank countenance made  upon me, I cannot believe that he made that statement maliciously. I  believe the Colonel thought he spoke the exact truth. But did he know,  that of the four officers connected with two certain troops of the  Tenth Cavalry one was killed and three were so seriously wounded as to  cause them to be carried from the field, and the command of these two  troops fell to the first sergeants, who led them triumphantly to the  front? Does he know that both at Las Guasima and San Juan Hill the  greater part of troop B, of the Tenth Cavalry, was separated from its  commanding officer by accidents of battle and was led to the front by  its first sergeant?    When we reached the enemy's works on San Juan Hill our organizations  were very badly mixed, few company commanders having their whole  companies or none of some body else's company. As it was, Capt.  Watson, my troop commander, reached the crest of the hill with about  eight or ten men of his troop, all the rest having been accidentally  separated from him by the thick underbrush during the advance, and  being at that time, as was subsequently shown to be the firing line  under some one else pushing to the front. We kept up the forward  movement, and finally halted on the heights overlooking Santiago,  where Colonel Roosevelt, with a very thin line had preceded us, and  was holding the hill. Here Captain Watson told us to remain while he  went to another part of the line to look for the rest of his troop. He  did not come to that part of the field again.    The Colonel made a slight error when he said his mixed command  contained some colored infantry. All the colored troops in that  command were cavalry men. His command consisted mostly of Rough  Riders, with an aggregate of about one troop of the Tenth Cavalry, a  few of the Ninth and a few of the First Regular Cavalry, with a half  dozen officers.

Does he forget the small bed-room occupied by eighteen boys, the  pump you had to run to on Sunday mornings, when decency and the usher  commanded you to wash? Is he oblivious of the blue chalk and water they  flooded your bowels with at breakfast, and called it milk? Has he lost  the remembrance of the Yorkshire pudding, vulgarly called choke-dog, of  which you were obliged to eat a pound before you were allowed a slice  of beef, and of which, if you swallowed half that quantity, you thought  cooks and oxen mere works of supererogation, and totally useless on the  face of the earth? Has the fool lost all recollection of the prayers in  yon cold, wet, clay-floored cellar, proudly denominated the chapel? has  he forgot the cuffs from the senior boys, the pinches from the second  master? and, _in fine_, has he forgot the press at the end of the  school-room, where a cart-load of birch was deposited at the beginning  of every half year, and not a twig left to tickle a mouse with, long  before the end of it? He talks of freedom from care--what a negative  kind of happiness! Let him cut off his hand, he will never hurt his  nails. Let him enclose an order for all his money even unto us, and no  more will he be troubled with cares about the Stocks--no more will he be  teased with calculations on the price of grain. All that raving about  school-boys is perfect nonsense--it is the most miserable period of a  human being's life. Poor, shivering, trembling, kicked, buffetted,  thumped, and starved little mortals! We never see a large school but we  feel inclined to shoot them all, masters, ushers, and door-keepers  included, merely to put them out of pain.    But at College, how different!--_There_, a man begins to feel that it is  a matter of total indifference to him whether he sit on a hard wooden  bench, or a soft stuffed chair; _there_, the short coat is discarded,  and he stalks about with the air of a three-tailed bashaw, as his own  two, generally, at first, are prolonged a little below the knee;  _there_, his penny tart, which he bought on Saturdays at the door of the  school, is exchanged for a dessert from Golding's; his beer, which he  occasionally imbibed at the little pot-house, two miles beyond the  school bounds, is exchanged for his wine from Butler's.--Books from  Talboy's, the most enterprising of bibliopoles, supply the place of the  tattered Dictionary he brought to the University, which, after being  stolen when new, and passing, by the same process, through twenty hands,  is at last, when fluttering in its last leaves, restolen by the original  proprietor, who fancies he has made a very profitable \"nibble.\" The trot  he used to enjoy by stealth on the butcher's broken-kneed pony, is  succeeded now by a gallop on a steed of Quartermain's; and he is  delighted to find that horse and owner strive which shall be the  softest-mouthed and gentlest charger. The dandy mare, we suppose, has  many long years ago made fat the great-grandfathers of the present race  of dogs; and old Scroggins, we imagine, has been trod to pieces in boots  and shoes, the very memory of which departed long, long before they were  paid for. Of old Scroggins--as Dr. Johnson says--and of his virtues, let  us indulge ourself in the recollection. Though not formed in the finest  mould, or endowed with the extremity of swiftness, his pace was sure and  steady--equal to Hannibal in endurance of fatigue; and, like that  celebrated commander, his aspect was rendered peculiarly fierce and  striking by a blemish in his eye; not ignorant of the way to Woodstock  was the wall-eyed veteran; not unacquainted with the covers at Ditchley;  not unaccustomed to the walls at Hethrop: but Dandy and Scroggins have  padded the hoof from this terrestrial and unstable world--peace to their  manes!--_Blackwood's Magazine._             *       *       *       *       *    SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY.           *       *       *       *       *    _Friction of Screws and Screw-presses._    An examination of the friction in screws having their threads of various  forms, has led M. Poncelet to this very important conclusion, namely,  that the friction in screws with square threads is to that of equal  screws with triangular threads, as 2.90 to 4.78, proving a very  important advantage of the former over the latter, relative to the loss  of power incurred in both by friction.--_Brande's Journal._      _Fulminating Powder._    According to M. Landgerbe, a mixture of two parts nitre, two parts  neutral carbonate of potash, one part of sulphur, and six parts of  common salt, all finely pulverized, makes a very powerful fulminating  powder. M. Landgerbe adopts the extraordinary error of supposing that  these preparations act with more force downwards than in any other  direction.--_Bull. Univ._      _Aurora Borealis._    An aurora borealis was seen from North End, Hampstead, near London, from  about seven o'clock until eleven, on the evening of Dec. 1. It generally  appeared as a light resembling twilight, but shifting about both to the  east and the west of north, and occasionally forming streams which  continued for several minutes, and extended from 30 to 40 degrees high.  The light on the horizon was not more than 12 or 15 degrees in  height.--_Brande's Journal._      _Paper Linen._    According to the Paris papers, a new invention, called _papier linge_,  has lately attracted much attention. It consists of a paper made closely  to resemble damask and other linen, not only to the eye, but even to the  touch. The articles are used for every purpose to which linen is  applicable, except those requiring much strength and durability. The  price is low, a napkin costs only five or six centimes (about a  halfpenny), and when dirty, they are taken back at half-price. A good  sized table-cloth sells for a franc, and a roll of paper with one or two  colours for papering rooms or for bed curtains, may be had for the same  price.      _Maturation of Wine._    M. de St. Vincent, of Havre, states, from his own experience of long  continuance, that when bottles containing wine are closed by tying a  piece of parchment or bladder over their mouths, instead of using corks  in the ordinary manner, the wine acquires, in a few weeks only, those  qualities which is only given by age in the ordinary way after many  years.--_Nouveau Jour, de Paris._      _Indications of Wholesomeness in Mushrooms._    Whenever a fungus is pleasant in flavour and odour, it may be considered  wholesome; if, on the contrary, it have an offensive smell, a bitter,  astringent, or styptic taste, or even if it leave an unpleasant flavour  in the mouth, it should not be considered fit for food. The colour,  figure, and texture of these vegetables do not afford any characters on  which we can safely rely; yet it may be remarked, that in colour, the  pure yellow, gold colour, bluish pale, dark or lustre brown, wine red,  or the violet, belong to many that are esculent; whilst the pale or  sulphur yellow, bright or blood red, and the greenish, belong to few but  the poisonous. The safe kinds have most frequently a compact, brittle  texture; the flesh is white; they grow more readily in open places, such  as dry pastures and waste lands, than in places humid or shaded by wood.  In general, those should be suspected which grow in caverns and  subterranean passages, on animal matter undergoing putrefaction, as well  as those whose flesh is soft or watery.--_Brande's Journal._      _Zoological Society._    Dr. Brookes, in his address to the recent anniversary meeting of the  Zoological Society, stated that the _Museum_ already contains 600  species of mammalia, 4,000 birds, 1,000 reptiles and fishes, 1,000  testacea and Crustacea, and 30,000 insects. During the last seven  months, the _Gardens_ and Museum have been visited by upwards of 30,000  persons. The vivarium contains upwards of 430 living quadrupeds and  birds. The expenses of the past year have been 10,000 l., partly  contributed by the admission of the public, and still more largely by  the members of the Society, who already exceed 1,200 in number. These  are gratifying facts to every lover of natural history, as they serve to  indicate the progress of _zoology_ in this country--a study which it has  ever been our aim to identify with the pages of the MIRROR.             *       *       *       *       *    RETROSPECTIVE GLEANINGS.           *       *       *       *       *      ENGLISH ROADS.      The roads of England are the marvel of the world. The improvements which  have been effected during a century would be almost miraculous, did we  not consider that they had been produced by the spirit and intelligence  of the people, and were in no degree dependant upon the apathy or  caprice of the ruling power. The first turnpike-road was established by  an act of the 3rd Charles II. The mob pulled down the gates; and the new  principle was supported at the point of the bayonet. But long after that  period travelling was difficult and dangerous. In December, 1703,  Charles III. king of Spain, slept at Petworth on his way from Portsmouth  to Windsor, and Prince George of Denmark went to meet him there by  desire of the queen. In the relation of the journey given by one of the  prince's attendants, he states, \"We set out at six in the morning, by  torchlight, to go to Petworth, and did not get out of the coaches (save  only when we were overturned or stuck fast in the mire) till we arrived  at our journey's end. 'Twas a hard service for the prince to sit  fourteen hours in the coach that day without eating any thing, and  passing through the worst ways I ever saw in my life. We were thrown but  once indeed in going, but our coach, which was the leading one, and his  highnesses body coach, would have suffered"]]]
