The finest form of Discovery  is one attended by Peripeties, like that which goes with the Discovery  in _Oedipus_. There are no doubt other forms of it; what we have said  may happen in a way in reference to inanimate things, even things of a  very casual kind; and it is also possible to discover whether some one  has done or not done something. But the form most directly connected  with the Plot and the action of the piece is the first-mentioned. This,  with a Peripety, will arouse either pity or fear--actions of that nature  being what Tragedy is assumed to represent; and it will also serve to  bring about the happy or unhappy ending. The Discovery, then, being of  persons, it may be that of one party only to the other, the latter being  already known; or both the parties may have to discover themselves.  Iphigenia, for instance, was discovered to Orestes by sending the  letter; and another Discovery was required to reveal him to Iphigenia.    Two parts of the Plot, then, Peripety and Discovery, are on matters of  this sort. A third part is Suffering; which we may define as an action  of a destructive or painful nature, such as murders on the stage,  tortures, woundings, and the like. The other two have been already  explained.          12      The parts of Tragedy to be treated as formative elements in the whole  were mentioned in a previous Chapter. From the point of view, however,  of its quantity, i.e. the separate sections into which it is divided, a  tragedy has the following parts: Prologue, Episode, Exode, and a choral  portion, distinguished into Parode and Stasimon; these two are common to  all tragedies, whereas songs from the stage and Commoe are only found  in some. The Prologue is all that precedes the Parode of the chorus; an  Episode all that comes in between two whole choral songs; the Exode  all that follows after the last choral song. In the choral portion the  Parode is the whole first statement of the chorus; a Stasimon, a song of  the chorus without anapaests or trochees; a Commas, a lamentation sung  by chorus and actor in concert. The parts of Tragedy to be used as  formative elements in the whole we have already mentioned; the above  are its parts from the point of view of its quantity, or the separate  sections into which it is divided.          13      The next points after what we have said above will be these: (1) What is  the poet to aim at, and what is he to avoid, in constructing his Plots?  and (2) What are the conditions on which the tragic effect depends?    We assume that, for the finest form of Tragedy, the Plot must be not  simple but complex; and further, that it must imitate actions arousing  pity and fear, since that is the distinctive function of this kind of  imitation. It follows, therefore, that there are three forms of Plot to  be avoided. (1) A good man must not be seen passing from happiness to  misery, or (2) a bad man from misery to happiness.    The first situation is not fear-inspiring or piteous, but simply odious  to us. The second is the most untragic that can be; it has no one of the  requisites of Tragedy; it does not appeal either to the human feeling in  us, or to our pity, or to our fears. Nor, on the other hand, should (3)  an extremely bad man be seen falling from happiness into misery. Such  a story may arouse the human feeling in us, but it will not move us to  either pity or fear; pity is occasioned by undeserved misfortune, and  fear by that of one like ourselves; so that there will be nothing either  piteous or fear-inspiring in the situation. There remains, then, the  intermediate kind of personage, a man not pre-eminently virtuous and  just, whose misfortune, however, is brought upon him not by vice and  depravity but by some error of judgement, of the number of those in the  enjoyment of great reputation and prosperity; e.g. Oedipus, Thyestes,  and the men of note of similar families. The perfect Plot, accordingly,  must have a single, and not (as some tell us) a double issue; the change  in the hero's fortunes must be not from misery to happiness, but on the  contrary from happiness to misery; and the cause of it must lie not  in any depravity, but in some great error on his part; the man himself  being either such as we have described, or better, not worse, than that.  Fact also confirms our theory. Though the poets began by accepting any  tragic story that came to hand, in these days the finest tragedies are  always on the story of some few houses, on that of Alemeon, Oedipus,  Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, or any others that may have been  involved, as either agents or sufferers, in some deed of horror. The  theoretically best tragedy, then, has a Plot of this description. The  critics, therefore, are wrong who blame Euripides for taking this line  in his tragedies, and giving many of them an unhappy ending. It is, as  we have said, the right line to take. The best proof is this: on the  stage, and in the public performances, such plays, properly worked  out, are seen to be the most truly tragic; and Euripides, even if  his elecution be faulty in every other point, is seen to be nevertheless  the most tragic certainly of the dramatists. After this comes the  construction of Plot which some rank first, one with a double story  (like the _Odyssey_) and an opposite issue for the good and the bad  personages. It is ranked as first only through the weakness of the  audiences; the poets merely follow their public, writing as its wishes  dictate. But the pleasure here is not that of Tragedy. It belongs rather  to Comedy, where the bitterest enemies in the piece (e.g. Orestes and  Aegisthus) walk off good friends at the end, with no slaying of any one  by any one.          14      The tragic fear and pity may be aroused by the Spectacle; but they may  also be aroused by the very structure and incidents of the play--which  is the better way and shows the better poet. The Plot in fact should be  so framed that, even without seeing the things take place, he who simply  hears the account of them shall be filled with horror and pity at the  incidents; which is just the effect that the mere recital of the story  in _Oedipus_ would have on one. To produce this same effect by means  of the Spectacle is less artistic, and requires extraneous aid. Those,  however, who make use of the Spectacle to put before us that which is  merely monstrous and not productive of fear, are wholly out of touch  with Tragedy; not every kind of pleasure should be required of a  tragedy, but only its own proper pleasure.    The tragic pleasure is that of pity and fear, and the poet has to  produce it by a work of imitation; it is clear, therefore, that the  causes should be included in the incidents of his story. Let us see,  then, what kinds of incident strike one as horrible, or rather as  piteous. In a deed of this description the parties must necessarily  be either friends, or enemies, or indifferent to one another. Now when  enemy does it on enemy, there is nothing to move us to pity either in  his doing or in his meditating the deed, except so far as the actual  pain of the sufferer is concerned; and the same is true when the parties  are indifferent to one another. Whenever the tragic deed, however, is  done within the family--when murder or the like is done or meditated  by brother on brother, by son on father, by mother on son, or son  on mother--these are the situations the poet should seek after. The  traditional stories, accordingly, must be kept as they are, e.g. the  murder of Clytaemnestra by Orestes and of Eriphyle by Alcmeon. At the  same time even with these there is something left to the poet himself;  it is for him to devise the right way of treating them. Let us explain  more clearly what we mean by 'the right way'. The deed of horror may be  done by the doer knowingly and consciously, as in the old poets, and  in Medea's murder of her children in Euripides. Or he may do it, but in  ignorance of his relationship, and discover that afterwards, as does the  _Oedipus_ in Sophocles. Here the deed is outside the play; but it may  be within it, like the act of the Alcmeon in Astydamas, or that of  the Telegonus in _Ulysses Wounded_. A third possibility is for  one meditating some deadly injury to another, in ignorance of his  relationship, to make the discovery in time to draw back. These exhaust  the possibilities, since the deed must necessarily be either done or not  done, and either knowingly or unknowingly.    The worst situation is when the personage is with full knowledge on the  point of doing the deed, and leaves it undone. It is odious and also  (through the absence of suffering) untragic; hence it is that no one is  made to act thus except in some few instances, e.g. Haemon and Creon in  _Antigone_. Next after this comes the actual perpetration of the deed  meditated. A better situation than that, however, is for the deed to  be done in ignorance, and the relationship discovered afterwards, since  there is nothing odious in it, and the Discovery will serve to astound  us. But the best of all is the last; what we have in _Cresphontes_, for  example, where Merope, on the point of slaying her son, recognizes  him in time; in _Iphigenia_, where sister and brother are in a like  position; and in _Helle_, where the son recognizes his mother, when on  the point of giving her up to her enemy.    This will explain why our tragedies are restricted (as we said just now)  to such a small number of families. It was accident rather than art that  led the poets in quest of subjects to embody this kind of incident in  their Plots. They are still obliged, accordingly, to have recourse to  the families in which such horrors have occurred.    On the construction of the Plot, and the kind of Plot required for  Tragedy, enough has now been said.          15      In the Characters there are four"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6764"],[0,"Army Life in a Black Regiment (#6)"],[1,"lovable,  in the midst of this war for freedom on which they have intelligently  entered. Last night, before \"taps,\" there was the greatest noise in camp  that I had ever heard, and I feared some riot. On going out, I found the  most tumultuous sham-fight proceeding in total darkness, two companies  playing like boys, beating tin cups for drums. When some of  them saw me they seemed a little dismayed, and came and said,  beseechingly,--\"Gunnel, Sah, you hab no objection to we playin',  Sah?\"--which objection I disclaimed; but soon they all subsided, rather  to my regret, and scattered merrily. Afterward I found that some other  officer had told them that I considered the affair too noisy, so that  I felt a mild self-reproach when one said, \"Cunnel, wish you had let  we play a little longer, Sah.\" Still I was not sorry, on the whole; for  these sham-fights between companies would in some regiments lead to real  ones, and there is a latent jealousy here between the Florida and South  Carolina men, which sometimes makes me anxious.    The officers are more kind and patient with the men than I should  expect, since the former are mostly young, and drilling tries the  temper; but they are aided by hearty satisfaction in the results already  attained. I have never yet heard a doubt expressed among the officers as  to the _superiority_ of these men to white troops in aptitude for drill  and discipline, because of their imitativeness and docility, and the  pride they take in the service. One captain said to me to-day, \"I have  this afternoon taught my men to load-in-nine-times, and they do it  better than we did it in my former company in three months.\" I can  personally testify that one of our best lieutenants, an Englishman,  taught a part of his company the essential movements of the \"school for  skirmishers\" in a single lesson of two hours, so that they did them  very passably, though I feel bound to discourage such haste. However,  I \"formed square\" on the third battalion drill. Three fourths of drill  consist of attention, imitation, and a good ear for time; in the  other fourth, which consists of the application of principles, as, for  instance, performing by the left flank some movement before learned  by the right, they are perhaps slower than better educated men. Having  belonged to five different drill-clubs before entering the army, I  certainly ought to know something of the resources of human awkwardness,  and I can honestly say that they astonish me by the facility with which  they do things. I expected much harder work in this respect.    The habit of carrying burdens on the head gives them erectness of  figure, even where physically disabled. I have seen a woman, with a  brimming water-pail balanced on her head, or perhaps a cup, saucer,  and spoon, stop suddenly, turn round, stoop to pick up a missile, rise  again, fling it, light a pipe, and go through many evolutions with  either hand or both, without spilling a drop. The pipe, by the way,  gives an odd look to a well-dressed young girl on Sunday, but one often  sees that spectacle. The passion for tobacco among our men continues  quite absorbing, and I have piteous appeals for some arrangement  by which they can buy it on credit, as we have yet no sutler. Their  imploring, \"Cunnel, we can't _lib_ widout it, Sah,\" goes to my heart;  and as they cannot read, I cannot even have the melancholy satisfaction  of supplying them with the excellent anti-tobacco tracts of Mr. Trask.      December 19.    Last night the water froze in the adjutant's tent, but not in mine.  To-day has been mild and beautiful. The blacks say they do not feel  the cold so much as the white officers do, and perhaps it is so, though  their health evidently suffers more from dampness. On the other hand,  while drilling on very warm days, they have seemed to suffer more from  the heat than their officers. But they dearly love fire, and at night  will always have it, if possible, even on the minutest scale,--a  mere handful of splinters, that seems hardly more efficacious than a  friction-match. Probably this is a natural habit for the short-lived  coolness of an out-door country; and then there is something delightful  in this rich pine, which burns like a tar-barrel. It was, perhaps,  encouraged by the masters, as the only cheap luxury the slaves had at  hand.    As one grows more acquainted with the men, their individualities emerge;  and I find, first their faces, then their characters, to be as distinct  as those of whites. It is very interesting the desire they show to do  their duty, and to improve as soldiers; they evidently think about it,  and see the importance of the thing; they say to me that we white men  cannot stay and be their leaders always and that they must learn to  depend on themselves, or else relapse into their former condition.    Beside the superb branch of uneatable bitter oranges which decks my  tent-pole, I have to-day hung up a long bough of finger-sponge, which  floated to the river-bank. As winter advances, butterflies gradually  disappear: one species (a _Vanessa_) lingers; three others have vanished  since I came. Mocking-birds are abundant, but rarely sing; once or twice  they have reminded me of the red thrush, but are inferior, as I have  always thought. The colored people all say that it will be much cooler;  but my officers do not think so, perhaps because last winter was so  unusually mild,--with only one frost, they say.      December 20.    Philoprogenitiveness is an important organ for an officer of colored  troops; and I happen to be well provided with it. It seems to be the  theory of all military usages, in fact, that soldiers are to be treated  like children; and these singular persons, who never know their own age  till they are past middle life, and then choose a birthday with such  precision,--\"Fifty year old, Sah, de fus' last April,\"--prolong the  privilege of childhood.    I am perplexed nightly for countersigns,--their range of proper names is  so distressingly limited, and they make such amazing work of every new  one. At first, to be sure, they did not quite recognize the need of any  variation: one night some officer asked a sentinel whether he had the  countersign yet, and was indignantly answered, \"Should tink I hab 'em,  hab 'em for a fortnight\"; which seems a long epoch for that magic word  to hold out. To-night I thought I would have \"Fredericksburg,\" in honor  of Burnside's reported victory, using the rumor quickly, for fear of a  contradiction. Later, in comes a captain, gets the countersign for  his own use, but presently returns, the sentinel having pronounced it  incorrect. On inquiry, it appears that the sergeant of the guard, being  weak in geography, thought best to substitute the more familiar word,  \"Crockery-ware\"; which was, with perfect gravity, confided to all the  sentinels, and accepted without question. O life! what is the fun of  fiction beside thee?    I should think they would suffer and complain these cold nights; but  they say nothing, though there is a good deal of coughing. I should  fancy that the scarlet trousers must do something to keep them warm, and  wonder that they dislike them so much, when they are so much like their  beloved fires. They certainly multiply firelight in any case. I often  notice that an infinitesimal flame, with one soldier standing by it,  looks like quite a respectable conflagration, and it seems as if a group  of them must dispel dampness.      December 21.    To a regimental commander no book can be so fascinating as the  consolidated Morning Report, which is ready about nine, and tells how  many in each company are sick, absent, on duty, and so on. It is one's  newspaper and daily mail; I never grow tired of it. If a single recruit  has come in, I am always eager to see how he looks on paper.    To-night the officers are rather depressed by rumors of Burnside's being  defeated, after all. I am fortunately equable and undepressible; and it  is very convenient that the men know too little of the events of the  war to feel excitement or fear. They know General Saxton and me,--\"de  General\" and \"de Gunnel,\"--and seem to ask no further questions. We  are the war. It saves a great deal of trouble, while it lasts, this  childlike confidence; nevertheless, it is our business to educate them  to manhood, and I see as yet no obstacle.    As for the rumor, the world will no doubt roll round, whether Burnside  is defeated or succeeds.      Christmas Day.        \"We'll fight for liberty    Till de Lord shall call us home;      We'll soon be free    Till de Lord shall call us home.\"    This is the hymn which the slaves at Georgetown, South Carolina, were  whipped for singing when President Lincoln was elected. So said a little  drummer-boy, as he sat at my tent's edge last night and told me his  story; and he showed all his white teeth as he added, \"Dey tink _'de  Lord'_ meant for say de Yankees.\"    Last night, at dress-parade, the adjutant read General Saxton's  Proclamation for the New Year's Celebration. I think they understood it,  for there was cheering in all the company-streets afterwards. Christmas  is the great festival of the year for this people; but, with New Year's  coming after, we could have no adequate programme for to-day, and so  celebrated Christmas Eve with pattern simplicity. We omitted, namely,  the mystic curfew which we call \"taps,\" and let them sit up and burn  their fires, and have their little prayer-meetings as late as they  desired; and all night, as I waked at intervals, I could hear them  praying and \"shouting\" and clattering with hands and heels. It seemed to  make them very happy, and appeared to be at least an innocent Christmas  dissipation, as compared with some of the convivialities of the  \"superior race\" hereabouts.      December 26.    The day passed with no greater excitement for the men than  target-shooting, which they enjoyed. I had "]]]
