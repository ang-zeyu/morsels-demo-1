Seeing what had happened in Sebu, the natives of  other neighboring islands came peacefully before the adelantado,  rendered him homage, and supplied his camp with a few provisions. The  first of the Spanish settlements was made in that port, and was called  the city of Sanctisimo Nombre de Jesus [Most holy name of Jesus],  [15] because a carved image of Jesus had been found in one of the  houses of the natives when the Spaniards conquered the latter, which  was believed to have been left there by the fleet of Magallanes. The  natives held the image in great reverence, and it wrought miracles  for them in times of need. The Spaniards placed it in the monastery  of St. Augustine, in that city.    That same year the adelantado despatched the flagship of his fleet  to Nueva España, with the relation and news of what had happened  during the voyage, and of the settlement in Sebu. He requested men  and supplies in order to continue the pacification of the other  islands. Fray Andres de Urdaneta and his associate, Fray Andres de  Aguirre, sailed in the vessel.    One of the ships which left Puerto de la Navidad in company with the  fleet and under command of Don Alonso de Arellano, carried as pilot  one Lope Martin, a mulatto and a good sailor, although a turbulent  fellow. When the ship neared the islands, it left the fleet and  went among them ahead of the other vessels. There they bartered  for provisions, and, without awaiting the adelantado, returned to  Nueva España by a northerly course--either because of their slight  gratification at having made the voyage to the islands, or to gain  the reward for having discovered the return passage. They soon  arrived and declared that they had seen the islands and discovered  the return voyage. They alleged various reasons for their coming,  but brought no message from the adelantado, or news of what had  happened to him. Don Alonso de Arellano was well received by the  Audiencia which was governing, where the rewarding of him and  his pilot was considered. This would have been done, had not the  adelantado's flagship arrived during this time, after having made  the same voyage. It brought an authentic account of events, of the  actual state of affairs, and of the settlement of Sebu. Moreover, they  related that Don Alonso de Arellano, without receiving any orders,  and without any necessity for it, had preceded the fleet with his  ship at the entrance of the islands, and was seen no more. They said  also that, besides those islands which had peacefully submitted to  his Majesty, there were many others, large and rich, well-inhabited,  and abounding in food and gold. They hoped to pacify and reduce  those islands with the reënforcements requested. They said that the  adelantado had named all the islands Filipinas, [16] in honor of his  Majesty. Reënforcements were immediately sent to the adelantado,  and have been sent every year, as necessity has demanded, so that  the land has been conquered and maintained.    The adelantado heard that there were other islands near Sebu,  abounding in provisions, and accordingly sent some Spaniards thither  to reduce the natives to peace, and bring back rice for the camp. Thus  he relieved his necessity and maintained himself as well as possible  until, having gone to the island of Panay, he sent Martin de Goiti, his  master-of-camp, and other captains thence to the island of Luzon with  what men he deemed sufficient, and under the guidance of a native chief  of the latter island, called Maomat, to try to pacify it and reduce it  to the obedience of his Majesty. When they reached the bay of Manila,  they found its settlement on the seashore, near a large river, and  under the rule and protection of a chief called Rajamora. Opposite,  on the other side of the river, was another large settlement named  Tondo, which was likewise held by another chief named Rajamatanda. [17]  These settlements were fortified with palm-trees and stout arigues [18]  filled in with earth, and very many bronze culverins and other pieces  of larger bore. Martin de Goiti, having begun to treat with the chiefs  and their people concerning the peace and submission which he demanded,  found it necessary to come to blows with them. The Spaniards entered  the land by force of arms, and took it, together with the forts and  artillery, on the day of St. Potenciana, May nineteen, one thousand  five hundred and seventy-one. [19] Upon this the natives and their  chiefs made peace and rendered homage; and many others of the same  island of Luzon did the same. [20]    When the news of the taking of Manila and of the Spanish settlement  there reached Panay, Adelantado Legazpi set in order the affairs of  Sebu and other islands which he had subdued, entrusted their natives  to the most reliable soldiers, and having taken the most necessary  precautions for the government of those provinces, which are commonly  called Bicayas de los Pintados, [21] because the natives of them have  all their bodies marked with fire, went to Manila with the remainder  of his men. He was well received there, and established afresh with  the natives and their chiefs the peace, alliance, and homage, which  had been given. On the very site of Manila, of which Rajamora made a  donation to the Spaniards for their settlement, the adelantado founded  his town and colony, on account of its strength and its situation  in a well-provisioned district, and in the midst of all the other  islands. He left it its name of Manila which it had received from  the natives. [22] Taking sufficient land for the city, the governor  established therein his seat and residence, and fortified it with  special care. He paid more attention to the above, in order to make  this new settlement the seat of government, than to the temperature,  and width of the site, which is hot and narrow from having the river  on one side of the city and the bay on the other, while at the back are  to be found large swamps and marshes, which make the place very strong.    From this post he continued to prosecute the pacification of the  other provinces of this great island of Luzon and of surrounding  districts. Some submitted voluntarily; others were conquered by force  of arms or by the efforts of the religious, who have sown the good  seed of the holy gospel therein. Various of them have labored valiantly  in this, not only in the time and administration of Adelantado Miguel  Lopez de Legazpi, but also in that of the governors that have succeeded  him. The land was apportioned among its conquerors and colonizers. The  capitals of provinces, the ports, and the settlements of cities and  towns which had been founded, and other special encomiendas, were  assigned to the royal crown, for the necessities that arise and the  expenses of the royal exchequer. The affairs of government and the  conversion of the natives were treated as was necessary. Ships were  provided for the annual voyage to Nueva España, which return with the  usual supplies. Thus the condition of the Filipinas Islands has reached  its present known height in both spiritual and temporal matters.    Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, as above-said, discovered the  islands, colonized them, and made a good beginning in the work of  pacification and subjugation. He founded the city of Sanctisimo Nombre  de Jesus in the provinces of Pintados, and then the city of Manila  in the island of Luzon. In this island he conquered the province  of Ylocos, in whose settlement and port called Vigan, he founded a  Spanish colony, to which he gave the name of Villa Fernandina. [23]  He also pacified the province of Pangasinan and the island of Mindoro,  fixed the amount of tribute that the natives were to pay throughout the  islands, [24] and made many ordinances concerning their government and  conversion, until his death in the year one thousand five hundred and  seventy-four, at Manila, where his body was buried in the monastery  of St. Augustine. [25]    At his death, there was found among his papers a sealed despatch from  the Audiencia of Mexico, which was governing when the fleet left  Nueva Españia, appointing a successor to the government, in case  of the death of the adelantado. By virtue of this despatch, Guido  de Labazarris, formerly a royal official, took the office and was  obeyed. He continued the conversion and pacification of the islands  with great wisdom, valor, and system, and governed them.    During his term the pirate Limahon came from China, and attacked Manila  with a fleet of seventy large war-ships and many soldiers. He entered  the city, and, after killing the master-of-camp, Martin de Goiti,  with other Spaniards who were at his house, marched against the fort,  in which the Spaniards, who were but few, had taken refuge, with  the intention of seizing and subjecting the country. The Spaniards,  reinforced from Vigan by Captain Joan de Salzedo and his soldiers--for  Salzedo saw this pirate pass his coasts, and brought the reinforcement  to Manila--defended themselves so bravely that, after having killed  many of Limahon's men, they forced him to reembark, to leave the bay  in flight, and to take refuge in Pangasinan River. The Spaniards went  thither in search of him and burned his fleet. [26] For many days they  besieged this pirate on land, but he, taking flight in small boats  that he made there secretly, put to sea and abandoned the islands.    During the government of this same Guido de Labazarris, trade and  commerce were established between Great China and Manila. Merchant  ships came every year and the governor received them kindly, and as  a consequence commerce has been growing ever since.

ANDREW LANG.            CHAPTER FIRST.                   Go call a coach, and let a coach be called,                 And let the man who calleth be the caller;                 And in his calling let him nothing call,                 But Coach! Coach! Coach! O for a coach, ye gods!                                   Chrononhotonthologos.    It was early on a fine summer's day, near the end of the eighteenth  century, when a young man, of genteel appearance, journeying towards the  north-east of Scotland, provided himself with a ticket in one of those  public carriages which travel between Edinburgh and the Queensferry,  at which place, as the name implies, and as is well known to all my  northern readers, there is a passage-boat for crossing the Firth of  Forth. The coach was calculated to carry six regular passengers, besides  such interlopers as the coachman could pick up by the way, and intrude  upon those who were legally in possession. The tickets, which conferred  right to a seat in this vehicle, of little ease, were dispensed by a  sharp-looking old dame, with a pair of spectacles on a very thin nose,  who inhabited a \"laigh shop,\" anglice, a cellar, opening to the High  Street by a straight and steep stair, at the bottom of which she sold  tape, thread, needles, skeins of worsted, coarse linen cloth, and such  feminine gear, to those who had the courage and skill to descend to  the profundity of her dwelling, without falling headlong themselves, or  throwing down any of the numerous articles which, piled on each side of  the descent, indicated the profession of the trader below.    The written hand-bill, which, pasted on a projecting board, announced  that the Queensferry Diligence, or Hawes Fly, departed precisely at  twelve o'clock on Tuesday, the fifteenth July 17--, in order to secure  for travellers the opportunity of passing the Firth with the flood-tide,  lied on the present occasion like a bulletin; for although that hour was  pealed from Saint Giles's steeple, and repeated by the Tron, no coach  appeared upon the appointed stand. It is true, only two tickets had been  taken out, and possibly the lady of the subterranean mansion might have  an understanding with her Automedon, that, in such cases, a little space  was to be allowed for the chance of filling up the vacant places--or the  said Automedon might have been attending a funeral, and be delayed by  the necessity of stripping his vehicle of its lugubrious trappings--or  he might have staid to take a half-mutchkin extraordinary with his crony  the hostler--or--in short, he did not make his appearance.    The young gentleman, who began to grow somewhat impatient, was now  joined by a companion in this petty misery of human life--the person who  had taken out the other place. He who is bent upon a journey is usually  easily to be distinguished from his fellow-citizens. The boots, the  great-coat, the umbrella, the little bundle in his hand, the hat pulled  over his resolved brows, the determined importance of his pace, his  brief answers to the salutations of lounging acquaintances, are all  marks by which the experienced traveller in mail-coach or diligence can  distinguish, at a distance, the companion of his future journey, as he  pushes onward to the place of rendezvous. It is then that, with worldly  wisdom, the first comer hastens to secure the best berth in the coach  for himself, and to make the most convenient arrangement for his baggage  before the arrival of his competitors. Our youth, who was gifted with  little prudence, of any sort, and who was, moreover, by the absence of  the coach, deprived of the power of availing himself of his priority of  choice, amused himself, instead, by speculating upon the occupation and  character of the personage who was now come to the coach office.    He was a good-looking man of the age of sixty, perhaps older,--but his  hale complexion and firm step announced that years had not impaired  his strength or health. His countenance was of the true Scottish  cast, strongly marked, and rather harsh in features, with a shrewd  and penetrating eye, and a countenance in which habitual gravity was  enlivened by a cast of ironical humour. His dress was uniform, and of a  colour becoming his age and gravity; a wig, well dressed and powdered,  surmounted by a slouched hat, had something of a professional air. He  might be a clergyman, yet his appearance was more that of a man of  the world than usually belongs to the kirk of Scotland, and his first  ejaculation put the matter beyond question.    He arrived with a hurried pace, and, casting an alarmed glance towards  the dial-plate of the church, then looking at the place where the coach  should have been, exclaimed, \"Deil's in it--I am too late after all!\"    The young man relieved his anxiety, by telling him the coach had not  yet appeared. The old gentleman, apparently conscious of his own want of  punctuality, did not at first feel courageous enough to censure that  of the coachman. He took a parcel, containing apparently a large folio,  from a little boy who followed him, and, patting him on the head, bid  him go back and tell Mr. B----, that if he had known he was to have had so  much time, he would have put another word or two to their bargain,--then  told the boy to mind his business, and he would be as thriving a lad as  ever dusted a duodecimo. The boy lingered, perhaps in hopes of a penny  to buy marbles; but none was forthcoming. Our senior leaned his little  bundle upon one of the posts at the head of the staircase, and, facing  the traveller who had first arrived, waited in silence for about five  minutes the arrival of the expected diligence.    At length, after one or two impatient glances at the progress of the  minute-hand of the clock, having compared it with his own watch, a huge  and antique gold repeater, and having twitched about his features to  give due emphasis to one or two peevish pshaws, he hailed the old lady  of the cavern.    \"Good woman,--what the d--l is her name?--Mrs. Macleuchar!\"    Mrs. Macleuchar, aware that she had a defensive part to sustain in the  encounter which was to follow, was in no hurry to hasten the discussion  by returning a ready answer.    \"Mrs. Macleuchar,--Good woman\" (with an elevated voice)--then apart, \"Old  doited hag, she's as deaf as a post--I say, Mrs. Macleuchar!\"    \"I am just serving a customer.--Indeed, hinny, it will no be a bodle  cheaper than I tell ye.\"    \"Woman,\" reiterated the traveller, \"do you think we can stand here all  day till you have cheated that poor servant wench out of her half-year's  fee and bountith?\"    \"Cheated!\" retorted Mrs. Macleuchar, eager to take up the quarrel upon a  defensible ground; \"I scorn your words, sir: you are an uncivil  person, and I desire you will not stand there, to slander me at my ain  stair-head.\"    \"The woman,\" said the senior, looking with an arch glance at his  destined travelling companion, \"does not understand the words of  action.--Woman,\" again turning to the vault, \"I arraign not thy  character, but I desire to know what is become of thy coach?\"    \"What's your wull?\" answered Mrs. Macleuchar, relapsing into deafness.    \"We have taken places, ma'am,\" said the younger stranger, \"in your  diligence for Queensferry\"--\"Which should have been half-way on the road  before now,\" continued the elder and more impatient traveller, rising  in wrath as he spoke: \"and now in all likelihood we shall miss the tide,  and I have business of importance on the other side--and your cursed  coach\"--    \"The coach?--Gude guide us, gentlemen, is it no on the stand yet?\"  answered the old lady, her shrill tone of expostulation sinking into a  kind of apologetic whine. \"Is it the coach ye hae been waiting for?\"    \"What else could have kept us broiling in the sun by the side of the  gutter here, you--you faithless woman, eh?\"    Mrs. Macleuchar now ascended her trap stair (for such it might be  called, though constructed of stone), until her nose came upon a level  with the pavement; then, after wiping her spectacles to look for  that which she well knew was not to be found, she exclaimed, with  well-feigned astonishment, \"Gude guide us--saw ever onybody the like o'  that?\"    \"Yes, you abominable woman,\" vociferated the traveller, \"many have seen  the like of it, and all will see the like of it that have anything to do  with your trolloping sex;\" then pacing with great indignation before  the door of the shop, still as he passed and repassed, like a vessel who  gives her broadside as she comes abreast of a hostile fortress, he  shot down complaints, threats, and reproaches, on the embarrassed Mrs.  Macleuchar. He would take a post-chaise--he would call a hackney coach--he  would take four horses--he must--he would be on the north side,  to-day--and all the expense of his journey, besides damages, direct and  consequential, arising from delay, should be accumulated on the devoted  head of Mrs. Macleuchar.    There, was something so comic in his pettish resentment, that the  younger traveller, who was in no such pressing hurry to depart, could  not help being amused with it, especially as it was obvious, that  every now and then the old gentleman, though very angry, could not help  laughing at his own vehemence. But when Mrs. Macleuchar began also to  join in the laughter, he quickly put a stop to her ill-timed"]]]
