In ultra-Catholic countries  the descent of the sacred fire is represented by some secretly arranged  pyrotechny, and the credulous laity, believing they have witnessed a  miraculous display, eagerly solicit Paschal candles lit from it; and in  imitation of the ancient festivities in honor of the return of spring,  all Catholic churches, and most of Protestant ones, are adorned with  flowers, the bells ring out their merriest peals, and \"Gloria in  Excelsis\" and other jubilant songs, similar to the lays of the ancient  Hilaries, are sung.      Annunciation.    The anniversary of the Nativity having been placed on the 25th of  December, according to the course of nature, the 25th of March was  anciently celebrated as the anniversary of the annunciation, and is  still observed on that day, and the duty of saluting the Virgin (Virgo)  and announcing her conception by the Holy Ghost or third person in the  Trinity was assigned to the genius of Spring. In the Chaldean version  of the Gospel story the name of Gabriel was given to this  personification, and in the Christian version of that story he is made  to perform the same office; see Luke i. 26-35.      Ascension.    Celebrating the anniversary of the ascension forty days after Easter,  it was anciently observed on the 4th of May, and it was taught that the  incarnate saviours ascended bodily into heaven, in a golden chariot  drawn by four horses caparisoned with gilded trappings, all glittering  like fire in the fervid sunlight. Hence when we read in II. Kings ii.  11, that \"There appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire, . . .  and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven,\" we must accept this  text as descriptive of the imaginary ascension of one of the incarnate  saviours of ancient Judaism.      Assumption.    When the Summer solstice was in the sign of Cancer, the sun was in that  of Virgo in the month of August, and the anniversary of the Assumption  was observed on the 15th of that month, and is so observed at the  present time. The fact that the anniversary of the Ascension precedes  that of the Assumption explains why Jesus is made to say to his mother  (Virgo) soon after his resurrection, \"Touch me not: for I am not yet  ascended to my Father.\" John xx. 17.      The Lord's Supper.    In the ancient solar worship the so-called ordinance of the Lord's  Supper was observed just before the anniversary of the autumnal  crucifixion; and consisting of bread and wine, in reference to the  maturing of the crops and completion of the vintage, was, like the  modern festival of the hardest home, a season of thankfulness to the  Lord (God Sol) as the giver of all good gifts. Hence being observed but  once a year, it was in reality not an ordinance but an anniversary; and  the fact that Christians partake of these emblems so frequently during  the year indicates that the original signification of the Lord's Supper  has been lost.      Transubstantiation,    or the conversion of the bread and wine into the veritable blood and  body of Christ, is a doctrine of the Catholic church which was derived  from the ritual of the ancient solar worship.    In the 26th chapter of Matthew we have an account of the Lord  administering the last supper to his Disciples on the eve of the  autumnal crucifixion, and in verse 27 it reads that \"he took the cup,  and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it.\" The  compilers of the modern version of the Gospel story must surely have  inadvertently copied this text as it read in the ancient versions of  that old, old story, which, when observed in remembrance of \"Our Lord  and Saviour Bacchus,\" was called the Bacchanalia, or feast, of Bacchus.  At these orgies the participants give thanks for the wine by not only  drinking all of one cup, but many more; in fact they kept on drinking  until they fell under the table.      Autumnal Crucifixion.    The beneficent seasons of Spring and Summer coming to an end at the  Autumnal Equinox, the 22d of September was made the anniversary of the  Autumnal Crucifixion. The vernal resurrection and Autumnal Crucifixion,  representing the alternate triumph of the personified principles of  Good and Evil, as manifested in the diversity of the seasons; we find  appropriately expressed in two religious pictures. In the one, the  Saviour, appealing as a vigorous young man, surrounded by a brilliant  halo, representing the rays of the all-conquering Sun of Spring, is  rising triumphantly from the tomb, before whom the demon of Winter, or  Devil, is seen retreating in the background. In the other, the  vanquished Saviour, represented by the figure of a lean and haggard  man, with a crown of thorns upon his head, around which appears a faint  halo of the Sun's declining rays, and above which is placarded the  letters I. N. R. I., the initial letters of Latin words, signifying the  life to come, or the eternal life, is suspended upon the cross, at the  foot of which his mother Mary (Virgo) is represented as kneeling in a  mourning attitude, and by her side is seen a serpent and a skull, the  emblems of Evil and of Death.    [See plate5.gif & plate6.gif]      Michaelmas.    In the calendar of the ancient Astral Worship, the fourth day after the  Autumnal Equinox was dedicated to the genius of Autumn. In the Chaldean  allegories the name of Michael was given to this personification, and  called Michaelmas, or feast of Michael. In the Catholic calendar this  anniversary is placed an the 29th of September, instead of the 26th of  that month, while that of St. Matthew, the Christian genius of Autumn,  which should be placed on the 26th of that month, is observed on the  21st.    Thus we have shown that the anniversaries of the ancient Astral Worship  were all fixed, and from church history we learn that they were so  observed by the Christians until the Council of Nice in the year 325,  when the Bishops assembled at that celebrated convocation, desiring to  have the festival of Easter celebrated on Sunday, which had been made  the Sabbath by the edict of Constantine, in the year 321, ordered that  it should be observed on the Sunday of the full moon, which comes on or  next after the Vernal Equinox. Hence, converting it into a movable  festival, its allied feasts and fast days were also made movable.        PERSONIFICATIONS OF THE DIVISIONS OF TIME.    In the ancient solar fables the several divisions of time were  personified and made to pay homage to the Triune Deity, supposed to be  enthroned above the firmament.      The Hours.    The genii of the hours were designated as Elders, and we find them  described in the 4th chapter of Revelation as sitting round about the  throne upon four and twenty seats, clothed in white raiment, and crowns  of gold upon their heads.      The Days.    Each day of the year was appropriately personified, and these genii of  the days constitute the saints of the Christian calendar. Of these we  will refer to but one. According to the ancient belief that the sun  stood still for the space of three days at each of the cardinal points,  the 24th of June was made the first of the decreasing days; and  dedicating it to St. John the Baptist, he is made to say in reference  to his opposite, (the genius of the 25th of December, and first of the  increasing days,) \"He must increase, but I must decrease.\" This text,  found in John iii. 30, simply means that the days of the one must  increase in length, while the days of the other must decrease.      The Months.    The fable of the twelve labors having been superseded by others, in  which the genii of the twelve signs of the Zodiac, corresponding to the  months, were designated as angels, and made to minister to God Sol  while making his apparent annual revolution; but, when constituted the  attendants of the incarnate saviours during their imaginary earth life,  they were personified as men and called Disciples. Of these genii of  the months we will refer only to the first and the last. The first  month, dedicated to the genius known in the mythology as Janus, and  from which was derived the name January, was portrayed with two faces,  the one of an old man looking mournfully backward over the old year,  and the other of a young man looking joyfully forward to the new year.  This personification, made the opener of the year, and represented as  holding a pair of cross-keys, was called \"The carrier of the keys of  the kingdom of heaven.\" Hence, the Popes of Rome, claiming apostolic  succession from Peter, the Janus of the Christian twelve, wear  cross-keys as the insignia of their office. Sometimes a crosier, or  shepherd's crook, is substituted for one of the keys, in reference to  his arrogated office of the leader of the sheep! The authority for the  assumption that the Popes are Peter's successors is found in Matthew  xvi. 18, 19; but its fallacy becomes apparent when we bear in mind that  the scriptures are but collections of astronomical allegories, and that  the Peter referred to in the text was not a man, but the mythical  genius of the month of January.    In reference to the last month, we find that the authors of the ancient  solar fables, ever doubting whether God Sol, after inaugurating Winter  by his supposed retreat from the earth, would return to revivify nature  with his life-giving rays, gave to the genius of the twelfth month the  title of the Doubter. In the Christian calendar this personification is  known as Thomas, and a more specific dedication of the shortest day of  the year having been made to him, the 21st day of December is called  St. Thomas day.      The Seasons.    When the cardinal points were in the constellations Leo, Taurus,  Aquarius and Scorpio, the astrologers, objecting to the signification  of the latter, substituted the constellation in conjunction therewith,  which is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8866"],[0,"Wild Flowers Worth Knowing (#6)"],[1,"guarded against fertilization from its own pollen. The bee,  flying off to another iris, must first brush past the projecting lip of  the overarching style, and leave on the stigmatic outer surface of the  plate some of the pollen brought from the first flower, before reaching  the nectary. Thus cross-fertilization is effected; and Darwin has shown  how necessary this is to insure the most vigorous and beautiful  offspring. Without this wonderful adaptation of the flower to the  requirements of its insect friends, and of the insect to the needs of  the flower, both must perish; the former from hunger, the latter because  unable to perpetuate its race. And yet man has greedily appropriated all  the beauties of the floral kingdom as designed for his sole delight!    \"The fleur-de-lys, which is the flower of chivalry,\" says Ruskin, \"has a  sword for its leaf and a lily for its heart.\" When that young and pious  Crusader, Louis VII, adopted it for the emblem of his house, spelling  was scarcely an exact science, and the _fleur-de-Louis_ soon became  corrupted into its present form. Doubtless the royal flower was the  white iris, and as _li_ is the Celtic for white, there is room for  another theory as to the origin of the name. It is our far more regal  looking, but truly democratic blossom, jostling its fellows in the  marshes, that is indeed \"born in the purple.\"    The name iris, meaning a deified rainbow, which was given this  group of plants by the ancients, shows a fine appreciation of their  superb coloring, their ethereal texture, and the evanescent beauty  of the blossom.      Blackberry Lily    _Belamcanda chinensis_ (_Pardanthus chinensis_)    _Flowers_--Deep orange color, speckled irregularly with crimson and  purple within _(Pardos_ = leopard; _anthos_ = flower); borne in  terminal, forked clusters. Perianth of 6 oblong, petal-like, spreading  divisions; 6 stamens with linear anthers; style thickest above, with 3  branches. _Stem:_ 1-1/2 to 4 ft. tall, leafy. _Leaves:_ Like the iris;  erect, folded blades, 8 to 10 in. long. _Fruit:_ Resembling a  blackberry; an erect mass of round, black, fleshy seeds, at first  concealed in a fig-shaped capsule, whose 3 valves curve backward, and  finally drop off.    _Preferred Habitat_--Roadsides and hills.    _Flowering Season_--June-July.    _Distribution_--Connecticut to Georgia, westward to Indiana and  Missouri.    How many beautiful foreign flowers, commonly grown in our gardens here,  might soon become naturalized Americans were we only generous enough to  lift a few plants, scatter a few seeds over our fences into the fields  and roadsides--to raise the bars of their prison, as it were, and let  them free! Many have run away, to be sure. Once across the wide  Atlantic, or wider Pacific, their passage paid (not sneaking in among  the ballast like the more fortunate weeds), some are doomed to stay in  prim, rigidly cultivated flower beds forever; others, only until a  chance to bolt for freedom presents itself, and away they go. Lucky are  they if every flower they produce is not picked before a single seed  can be set.    This Blackberry Lily of gorgeous hue originally came from China.  Escaping from gardens here and there, it was first reported as a wild  flower at East Rock, Connecticut; other groups of vagabonds were met  marching along the roadsides on Long Island; near Suffern, New York;  then farther southward and westward, until it has already attained a  very respectable range. Every plant has some good device for sending its  offspring away from home to found new colonies, if man would but let it  alone. Better still, give the eager travellers a lift!      Pointed Blue-eyed Grass; Eye-bright; Blue Star    _Sisyrinchium angustifolium_    _Flowers_--From blue to purple, with a yellow centre; a Western  variety, white; usually several buds at the end of the stem, between 2  erect unequal bracts; about 1/2 in. across; perianth of 6 spreading  divisions, each pointed with a bristle from a notch; stamens 3, the  filaments united to above the middle; pistil 1, its tip 3-cleft.  _Stem:_ 3 to 14 in. tall, pale hoary green, flat, rigid, 2-edged.  _Leaves:_ Grass-like, pale, rigid, mostly from base. _Fruit:_ 3-celled  capsule, nearly globose.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist fields and meadows.    _Flowering Season_--May-August.    _Distribution_--Newfoundland to British Columbia, from eastern slope of  Rocky Mountains to Atlantic, south to Virginia and Kansas.    Only for a day, and that must be a bright one, will this \"little sister  of the stately blue flag\" open its eyes, to close them in indignation on  being picked; nor will any coaxing but the sunshine's induce it to open  them again in water, immediately after. The dainty flower, growing in  dense tufts, makes up in numbers what it lacks in size and lasting  power, flecking our meadows with purplish ultramarine blue on a sunny  June morning. Later in the day, apparently there are no blossoms there,  for all are tightly closed, never to bloom again. New buds will unfold  to tinge the field on the morrow.    Usually three buds nod from between a pair of bracts, the lower one of  which may be twice the length of the upper one; but only one flower  opens at a time. Slight variations in this plant have been considered  sufficient to differentiate several species formerly included by Gray  and other American botanists under the name of _S. Bermudiana_.          ORCHIS FAMILY _(Orchidaceae)_      Large Yellow Lady's Slipper; Whippoorwill's Shoe; Yellow Moccasin  Flower    _Cypripedium pubescens (C. hirsutum)_    _Flower_--Solitary, large, showy, borne at the top of a leafy stem 1 to  2 ft. high. Sepals 3, 2 of them united, greenish or yellowish, striped  with purple or dull red, very long, narrow; 2 petals, brown, narrower,  twisting; the third an inflated sac, open at the top, 1 to 2 in. long,  pale yellow, purple lined; white hairs within; sterile stamen  triangular; stigma thick. _Leaves:_ Oval or elliptic, pointed, 3 to 5  in. long, parallel-nerved, sheathing.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist or boggy woods and thickets; hilly ground.    _Flowering Season_--May-July.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Alabama, westward to Minnesota and  Nebraska.    Swinging outward from a leaf-clasped stem, this orchid attracts us by  its flaunted beauty and decorative form from tip to root, not less than  the aesthetic little bees for which its adornment and mechanism are so  marvellously adapted. Doubtless the heavy, oily odor is an additional  attraction to them.    These common orchids, which are not at all difficult to naturalize in a  well-drained, shady spot in the garden, should be lifted with a good  ball of earth and plenty of leaf-mould immediately after flowering.    The similar Small Yellow Lady's Slipper _(C. parviflorum)_, a delicately  fragrant orchid about half the size of its big sister, has a brighter  yellow pouch, and occasionally its sepals and petals are purplish. As  they usually grow in the same localities, and have the same blooming  season, opportunities for comparison are not lacking. This fairer,  sweeter, little orchid roams westward as far as the State of Washington.      Moccasin Flower; Pink, Venus', or Stemless Lady's Slipper    _Cypripedium acaule_    _Flowers_--Fragrant, solitary, large, showy, drooping from end of scape,  6 to 12 in. high. Sepals lance-shaped, spreading, greenish purple, 2 in.  long or less; petals narrower and longer than sepals. Lip an inflated  sac, often more than 2 in. long, slit down the middle, and folded  inwardly above, pale magenta, veined with darker pink; upper part of  interior crested with long white hairs. Stamens united with style into  unsymmetrical declined column, bearing an anther on either side, and a  dilated triangular petal-like sterile stamen above, arching over the  broad concave stigma. _Leaves:_ 2, from the base; elliptic, thick, 6 to  8 in. long.    _Preferred Habitat--Deep_, rocky, or sandy woods.    _Flowering Season_--May-June.    _Distribution_--Canada southward to North Carolina, westward to  Minnesota and Kentucky.    Because most people cannot forbear picking this exquisite flower that  seems too beautiful to be found outside a millionaire's hothouse, it is  becoming rarer every year, until the finding of one in the deep forest,  where it must now hide, has become the event of a day's walk. Once it  was the commonest of the orchids.    \"Cross-fertilization,\" says Darwin, \"results in offspring which vanquish  the offspring of self-fertilization in the struggle for existence.\" This  has been the motto of the orchid family for ages. No group of plants has  taken more elaborate precautions against self-pollination or developed  more elaborate and ingenious mechanism to compel insects to transfer  their pollen than this.    The fissure down the front of the Pink Lady's Slipper is not so wide but  that a bee must use some force to push against its elastic sloping sides  and enter the large banquet chamber where he finds generous  entertainment secreted among the fine white hairs in the upper part.  Presently he has feasted enough. Now one can hear him buzzing about  inside, trying to find a way out of the trap. Toward the two little  gleams of light through apertures at the end of a passage beyond the  nectary hairs he at length finds his way. Narrower and narrower grows  the passage until it would seem as if he could never struggle through;  nor can he until his back has rubbed along the sticky, overhanging  stigma, which is furnished with minute, rigid, sharply pointed papillae,  all directed forward, and placed there for the express purpose of  combing out the pollen he has brought from another flower on his back  or head. The imported pollen having been safely removed, he still has to  struggle on toward freedom through one of the narrow openings, where an  anther almost blocks his way.    As he works outward, this anther, drawn"]]]
