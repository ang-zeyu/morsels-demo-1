Bordering on the Chauci and Catti are the Cherusci; [188] who, for  want of an enemy, long cherished a too lasting and enfeebling peace:  a state more flattering than secure; since the repose enjoyed amidst  ambitious and powerful neighbors is treacherous; and when an appeal is  made to the sword, moderation and probity are names appropriated by the  victors. Thus, the Cherusci, who formerly bore the titles of just and  upright, are now charged with cowardice and folly; and the good fortune  of the Catti, who subdued them, has grown into wisdom. The ruin of the  Cherusci involved that of the Fosi, [189] a neighboring tribe, equal  partakers of their adversity, although they had enjoyed an inferior  share of their prosperity.    37. In the same quarter of Germany, adjacent to the ocean, dwell the  Cimbri; [191] a small [192] state at present, but great in renown. [193]  Of their past grandeur extensive vestiges still remain, in encampments  and lines on either shore, [194] from the compass of which the strength  and numbers of the nation may still be computed, and credit derived to  the account of so prodigious an army. It was in the 640th year of Rome  that the arms of the Cimbri were first heard of, under the consulate  of Caecilius Metellus and Papirius Carbo; from which era to the second  consulate of the emperor Trajan [195] is a period of nearly 210 years.  So long has Germany withstood the arms of Rome. During this long  interval many mutual wounds have been inflicted. Not the Samnite, the  Carthaginian, Spain, Gaul, or Parthia, have given more frequent alarms;  for the liberty of the Germans is more vigorous than the monarchy of  the Arsacidae. What has the East, which has itself lost Pacorus, and  suffered an overthrow from Ventidius, [196] to boast against us, but  the slaughter of Crassus? But the Germans, by the defeat or capture of  Carbo, [197] Cassius, [198] Scaurus Aurelius, [199] Servilius Caepio,  and Cneius Manlius, [200] deprived the Roman people of five consular  armies; [201] and afterwards took from Augustus himself Varus with three  legions. [202] Nor did Caius Marius [203] in Italy, the deified Julius  [204] in Gaul, or Drusus, [204] Nero, [204] or Germanicus [204] in their  own country, defeat then without loss. The subsequent mighty threats  of Caligula terminated in ridicule. Then succeeded tranquillity; till,  seizing the occasion of our discords and civil wars, they forced the  winter-quarters of the legions, [205] and even aimed at the possession  of Gaul; and, again expelled thence, they have in latter times been  rather triumphed over [206] than vanquished.    38. We have now to speak of the Suevi; [207] who do not compose a single  state, like the Catti or Tencteri, but occupy the greatest part of  Germany, and are still distributed into different names and nations,  although all hearing the common appellation of Suevi. It is a  characteristic of this people to turn their hair sideways, and tie it  beneath the poll in a knot. By this mark the Suevi are distinguished  from the rest of the Germans; and the freemen of the Suevi from the  slaves. [208] Among other nations, this mode, either on account of some  relationship with the Suevi, or from the usual propensity to imitation,  is sometimes adopted; but rarely, and only during the period of youth.  The Suevi, even till they are hoary, continue to have their hair growing  stiffly backwards, and often it is fastened on the very crown of the  head. The chiefs dress it with still greater care: and in this respect  they study ornament, though of an undebasing kind. For their design is  not to make love, or inspire it; they decorate themselves in this manner  as they proceed to war, in order to seem taller and more terrible; and  dress for the eyes of their enemies.    39. The Semnones [209] assert themselves to be the most ancient and  noble of the Suevi; and their pretensions are confirmed by religion.  At a stated time, all the people of the same lineage assemble by their  delegates in a wood, consecrated by the auguries of their forefathers  and ancient terror, and there by the public slaughter of a human victim  celebrate the horrid origin of their barbarous rites. Another kind of  reverence is paid to the grove. No person enters it without being bound  with a chain, as an acknowledgment of his inferior nature, and the power  of the deity residing there. If he accidentally fall, it is not lawful  for him to be lifted or to rise up; they roll themselves out along the  ground. The whole of their superstition has this import: that from this  spot the nation derives its origin; that here is the residence of the  Deity, the Governor of all, and that everything else is subject and  subordinate to him. These opinions receive additional authority from  the power of the Semnones, who inhabit a hundred cantons, and, from the  great body they compose, consider themselves as the head of the Suevi.    40. The Langobardi, [210] on the other hand, are ennobled by, the  smallness of their numbers; since though surrounded by many powerful  nations, they derive security, not from obsequiousness, but from their  martial enterprise. The neighboring Reudigni, [211] and the Avions,  [212] Angli, [213] Varini, Eudoses, Suardones, and Nuithones, [214]  are defended by rivers or forests. Nothing remarkable occurs in any of  these; except that they unite in the worship of Hertha, [215] or Mother  Earth; and suppose her to interfere in the affairs of men, and to visit  the different nations. In an island [216] of the ocean stands a sacred  and unviolated grove, in which is a consecrated chariot, covered with a  veil, which the priest alone is permitted to touch. He becomes conscious  of the entrance of the goddess into this secret recess; and with  profound veneration attends the vehicle, which is drawn by yoked cows.  At this season, [217] all is joy; and every place which the goddess  deigns to visit is a scene of festivity. No wars are undertaken; arms  are untouched; and every hostile weapon is shut up. Peace abroad and  at home are then only known; then only loved; till at length the same  priest reconducts the goddess, satiated with mortal intercourse, to her  temple. [218] The chariot, with its curtain, and, if we may believe it,  the goddess herself, then undergo ablution in a secret lake. This office  is performed by slaves, whom the same lake instantly swallows up. Hence  proceeds a mysterious horror; and a holy ignorance of what that can be,  which is beheld only by those who are about to perish. This part of the  Suevian nation extends to the most remote recesses of Germany.    41. If we now follow the course of the Danube, as we before did that of  the Rhine, we first meet with the Hermunduri; [219] a people faithful to  the Romans, [220] and on that account the only Germans who are admitted  to commerce, not on the bank alone, but within our territories, and in  the flourishing colony [221] established in the province of Rhaetia.  They pass and repass at pleasure, without being attended by a guard; and  while we exhibit to other nations our arms and camps alone, to these  we lay open our houses and country seats, which they behold without  coveting. In the country of the Hermunduri rises the Elbe; [222] a river  formerly celebrated and known among us, now only heard of by name.    42. Contiguous to the Hermunduri are the Narisci; [223] and next to  them, the Marcomanni [224] and Quadi. [225] Of these, the Marcomanni are  the most powerful and renowned; and have even acquired the country which  they inhabit, by their valor in expelling the Boii. [226] Nor are the  Narisci and Quadi inferior in bravery; [227] and this is, as it were,  the van of Germany as far as it is bordered by the Danube. Within our  memory the Marcomanni and Quadi were governed by kings of their own  nation, of the noble line of Maroboduus [228] and Tudrus. They now  submit even to foreigners; but all the power of their kings depends upon  the authority of the Romans. [229] We seldom assist them with our arms,  but frequently with our money; nor are they the less potent on that  account.    43. Behind these are the Marsigni, [230] Gothini, [231] Osi, [232] and  Burrii, [233] who close the rear of the Marcomanni and Quadi. Of these,  the Marsigni and Burrii in language [234] and dress resemble the Suevi.  The Gothini and Osi prove themselves not to be Germans; the first, by  their use of the Gallic, the second, of the Pannonian tongue; and both,  by their submitting to pay tribute: which is levied on them, as aliens,  partly by the Sarmatians, partly by the Quadi. The Gothini, to their  additional disgrace, work iron mines. [235] All these people inhabit but  a small proportion of champaign country; their settlements are chiefly  amongst forests, and on the sides and summits of mountains; for a  continued ridge of mountains [236] separates Suevia from various remoter  tribes. Of these, the Lygian [237] is the most extensive, and diffuses  its name through several communities. It will be sufficient to name  the most powerful of them--the Arii, Helvecones, Manimi, Elysii, and  Naharvali. [238] In the country of the latter is a grove, consecrated to  religious rites of great antiquity. A priest presides over them, dressed  in woman's apparel; but the gods worshipped there are said, according to  the Roman interpretation, to be Castor and Pollux. Their attributes are  the same; their name, Alcis. [239] No images, indeed, or vestiges of  foreign superstition, appear in their worship; but they are revered  under the character of young men and brothers. The Arii, fierce beyond  the superiority of strength they possess over the other just enumerated  people, improve their natural ferocity of aspect by artificial helps.

In the seventh century  B.C. it became once more an independent state which obeyed the rule of a  king who lived in the city of Sais in the Delta of the Nile. But in the  year 525 B.C., Cambyses, the king of the Persians, took possession  of Egypt and in the fourth century B.C., when Persia was conquered by  Alexander the Great, Egypt too became a Macedonian province. It regained  a semblance of independence when one of Alexander's generals set himself  up as king of a new Egyptian state and founded the dynasty of the  Ptolemies, who resided in the newly built city of Alexandria.    Finally, in the year 89 B.C., the Romans came. The last Egyptian queen,  Cleopatra, tried her best to save the country. Her beauty and charm were  more dangerous to the Roman generals than half a dozen Egyptian army  corps. Twice she was successful in her attacks upon the hearts of her  Roman conquerors. But in the year 30 B.C., Augustus, the nephew and  heir of Caesar, landed in Alexandria. He did not share his late uncle's  admiration for the lovely princess. He destroyed her armies, but spared  her life that he might make her march in his triumph as part of the  spoils of war. When Cleopatra heard of this plan, she killed herself by  taking poison. And Egypt became a Roman province.          MESOPOTAMIA    MESOPOTAMIA--THE SECOND CENTRE OF EASTERN CIVILISATION      I AM going to take you to the top of the highest pyramid and I am going  to ask that you imagine yourself possessed of the eyes of a hawk. Way,  way off, in the distance, far beyond the yellow sands of the desert, you  will see something green and shimmering. It is a valley situated between  two rivers. It is the Paradise of the Old Testament. It is the land of  mystery and wonder which the Greeks called Mesopotamia--the \"country  between the rivers.\"    The names of the two rivers are the Euphrates (which the Babylonians  called the Purattu) and the Tigris (which was known as the Diklat). They  begin their course amidst the snows of the mountains of Armenia where  Noah's Ark found a resting place and slowly they flow through the  southern plain until they reach the muddy banks of the Persian gulf.  They perform a very useful service. They turn the arid regions of  western Asia into a fertile garden.    The valley of the Nile had attracted people because it had offered them  food upon fairly easy terms. The \"land between the rivers\" was popular  for the same reason. It was a country full of promise and both the  inhabitants of the northern mountains and the tribes which roamed  through the southern deserts tried to claim this territory as their  own and most exclusive possession. The constant rivalry between the  mountaineers and the desert-nomads led to endless warfare. Only the  strongest and the bravest could hope to survive and that will explain  why Mesopotamia became the home of a very strong race of men who  were capable of creating a civilisation which was in every respect as  important as that of Egypt.          THE SUMERIANS    THE SUMERIAN NAIL WRITERS, WHOSE CLAY TABLETS TELL US THE STORY OF  ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA, THE GREAT SEMITIC MELTING-POT      THE fifteenth century was an age of great discoveries. Columbus tried  to find a way to the island of Kathay and stumbled upon a new and  unsuspected continent. An Austrian bishop equipped an expedition which  was to travel eastward and find the home of the Grand Duke of Muscovy,  a voyage which led to complete failure, for Moscow was not visited by  western men until a generation later. Meanwhile a certain Venetian  by the name of Barbero had explored the ruins of western Asia and had  brought back reports of a most curious language which he had found  carved in the rocks of the temples of Shiraz and engraved upon endless  pieces of baked clay.    But Europe was busy with many other things and it was not until the  end of the eighteenth century that the first \"cuneiform inscriptions\"  (so-called because the letters were wedge-shaped and wedge is called  \"Cuneus\" in Latin) were brought to Europe by a Danish surveyor, named  Niebuhr. Then it took thirty years before a patient German school-master  by the name of Grotefend had deciphered the first four letters, the  D, the A, the R and the SH, the name of the Persian King Darius.  And another twenty years had to go by until a British officer, Henry  Rawlinson, who found the famous inscription of Behistun, gave us a  workable key to the nail-writing of western Asia.    Compared to the problem of deciphering these nail-writings, the job of  Champollion had been an easy one. The Egyptians used pictures. But the  Sumerians, the earliest inhabitants of Mesopotamia, who had hit upon  the idea of scratching their words in tablets of clay, had discarded  pictures entirely and had evolved a system of V-shaped figures which  showed little connection with the pictures out of which they had been  developed. A few examples will show you what I mean. In the beginning a  star, when drawn with a nail into a brick looked as follows: {illust.}  This sign however was too cumbersome and after a short while when the  meaning of \"heaven\" was added to that of star the picture was simplified  in this way {illust.} which made it even more of a puzzle. In the same  way an ox changed from {illust} into {illust.} and a fish changed from  {illust.} into {illust.} The sun was originally a plain circle {illust.}  and became {illust.} If we were using the Sumerian script today we would  make an {illust.} look like {illust.}. This system of writing down our  ideas looks rather complicated but for more than thirty centuries it  was used by the Sumerians and the Babylonians and the Assyrians and the  Persians and all the different races which forced their way into the  fertile valley.    The story of Mesopotamia is one of endless warfare and conquest. First  the Sumerians came from the North. They were a white People who had  lived in the mountains. They had been accustomed to worship their Gods  on the tops of hills. After they had entered the plain they constructed  artificial little hills on top of which they built their altars. They  did not know how to build stairs and they therefore surrounded their  towers with sloping galleries. Our engineers have borrowed this idea, as  you may see in our big railroad stations where ascending galleries lead  from one floor to another. We may have borrowed other ideas from the  Sumerians but we do not know it. The Sumerians were entirely ab-sorbed  by those races that entered the fertile valley at a later date. Their  towers however still stand amidst the ruins of Mesopotamia. The Jews saw  them when they went into exile in the land of Babylon and they called  them towers of Babillli, or towers of Babel.    In the fortieth century before our era, the Sumerians had entered  Mesopotamia. They were soon afterwards over-powered by the Akkadians,  one of the many tribes from the desert of Arabia who speak a common  dialect and who are known as the \"Semites,\" because in the olden days  people believed them to be the direct descendants of Shem, one of the  three sons of Noah. A thousand years later, the Akkadians were forced to  submit to the rule of the Amorites, another Semitic desert tribe whose  great King Hammurabi built himself a magnificent palace in the holy  city of Babylon and who gave his people a set of laws which made the  Babylonian state the best administered empire of the ancient world. Next  the Hittites, whom you will also meet in the Old Testament, over-ran the  Fertile Valley and destroyed whatever they could not carry away. They  in turn were vanquished by the followers of the great desert God, Ashur,  who called themselves Assyrians and who made the city of Nineveh the  center of a vast and terrible empire which conquered all of western Asia  and Egypt and gathered taxes from countless subject races until the end  of the seventh century before the birth of Christ when the Chaldeans,  also a Semitic tribe, re-established Babylon and made that city the most  important capital of that day. Nebuchadnezzar, the best known of their  Kings, encouraged the study of science, and our modern knowledge of  astronomy and mathematics is all based upon certain first principles  which were discovered by the Chaldeans. In the year 538 B.C. a crude  tribe of Persian shepherds invaded this old land and overthrew the  empire of the Chaldeans. Two hundred years later, they in turn were  overthrown by Alexander the Great, who turned the Fertile Valley, the  old melting-pot of so many Semitic races, into a Greek province. Next  came the Romans and after the Romans, the Turks, and Mesopotamia, the  second centre of the world's civilisation, became a vast wilderness  where huge mounds of earth told a story of ancient glory.          MOSES    THE STORY OF MOSES, THE LEADER OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE      SOME time during the twentieth century before our era, a small and  unimportant tribe of Semitic shepherds had left its old home, which was  situated in the land of Ur on the mouth of the Euphrates, and had tried  to find new pastures within the domain of the Kings of Babylonia. They  had been driven away by the royal soldiers and they had moved westward  looking for a little piece of unoccupied territory where they might set  up their tents.    This tribe of shepherds was known as the Hebrews or, as we call them,  the Jews. They had wandered far and wide, and after many years of dreary  peregrinations they had been given shelter in Egypt. For more than five  centuries they had dwelt among the Egyptians and when their adopted  country had been overrun by the Hyksos marauders (as I told you in  the story of Egypt) they had managed to make themselves useful to the  foreign invader and had been left in the undisturbed possession of their  grazing fields.
