If you had the taste to make them  splendid, which I would not be so rude as to question, the general  poverty resulting from your extraordinary industrial system would not  have given you the means. Moreover, the excessive individualism which  then prevailed was inconsistent with much public spirit. What little  wealth you had seems almost wholly to have been lavished in private  luxury. Nowadays, on the contrary, there is no destination of the  surplus wealth so popular as the adornment of the city, which all enjoy  in equal degree.\"    The sun had been setting as we returned to the house-top, and as we  talked night descended upon the city.    \"It is growing dark,\" said Dr. Leete. \"Let us descend into the house; I  want to introduce my wife and daughter to you.\"    His words recalled to me the feminine voices which I had heard  whispering about me as I was coming back to conscious life; and, most  curious to learn what the ladies of the year 2000 were like, I assented  with alacrity to the proposition. The apartment in which we found the  wife and daughter of my host, as well as the entire interior of the  house, was filled with a mellow light, which I knew must be artificial,  although I could not discover the source from which it was diffused.  Mrs. Leete was an exceptionally fine looking and well preserved woman  of about her husband's age, while the daughter, who was in the first  blush of womanhood, was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Her  face was as bewitching as deep blue eyes, delicately tinted complexion,  and perfect features could make it, but even had her countenance lacked  special charms, the faultless luxuriance of her figure would have given  her place as a beauty among the women of the nineteenth century.  Feminine softness and delicacy were in this lovely creature deliciously  combined with an appearance of health and abounding physical vitality  too often lacking in the maidens with whom alone I could compare her.  It was a coincidence trifling in comparison with the general  strangeness of the situation, but still striking, that her name should  be Edith.    The evening that followed was certainly unique in the history of social  intercourse, but to suppose that our conversation was peculiarly  strained or difficult would be a great mistake. I believe indeed that  it is under what may be called unnatural, in the sense of  extraordinary, circumstances that people behave most naturally, for the  reason, no doubt, that such circumstances banish artificiality. I know  at any rate that my intercourse that evening with these representatives  of another age and world was marked by an ingenuous sincerity and  frankness such as but rarely crown long acquaintance. No doubt the  exquisite tact of my entertainers had much to do with this. Of course  there was nothing we could talk of but the strange experience by virtue  of which I was there, but they talked of it with an interest so naive  and direct in its expression as to relieve the subject to a great  degree of the element of the weird and the uncanny which might so  easily have been overpowering. One would have supposed that they were  quite in the habit of entertaining waifs from another century, so  perfect was their tact.    For my own part, never do I remember the operations of my mind to have  been more alert and acute than that evening, or my intellectual  sensibilities more keen. Of course I do not mean that the consciousness  of my amazing situation was for a moment out of mind, but its chief  effect thus far was to produce a feverish elation, a sort of mental  intoxication.[1]    Edith Leete took little part in the conversation, but when several  times the magnetism of her beauty drew my glance to her face, I found  her eyes fixed on me with an absorbed intensity, almost like  fascination. It was evident that I had excited her interest to an  extraordinary degree, as was not astonishing, supposing her to be a  girl of imagination. Though I supposed curiosity was the chief motive  of her interest, it could but affect me as it would not have done had  she been less beautiful.    Dr. Leete, as well as the ladies, seemed greatly interested in my  account of the circumstances under which I had gone to sleep in the  underground chamber. All had suggestions to offer to account for my  having been forgotten there, and the theory which we finally agreed on  offers at least a plausible explanation, although whether it be in its  details the true one, nobody, of course, will ever know. The layer of  ashes found above the chamber indicated that the house had been burned  down. Let it be supposed that the conflagration had taken place the  night I fell asleep. It only remains to assume that Sawyer lost his  life in the fire or by some accident connected with it, and the rest  follows naturally enough. No one but he and Dr. Pillsbury either knew  of the existence of the chamber or that I was in it, and Dr. Pillsbury,  who had gone that night to New Orleans, had probably never heard of the  fire at all. The conclusion of my friends, and of the public, must have  been that I had perished in the flames. An excavation of the ruins,  unless thorough, would not have disclosed the recess in the foundation  walls connecting with my chamber. To be sure, if the site had been  again built upon, at least immediately, such an excavation would have  been necessary, but the troublous times and the undesirable character  of the locality might well have prevented rebuilding. The size of the  trees in the garden now occupying the site indicated, Dr. Leete said,  that for more than half a century at least it had been open ground.      [1] In accounting for this state of mind it must be remembered that,  except for the topic of our conversations, there was in my surroundings  next to nothing to suggest what had befallen me. Within a block of my  home in the old Boston I could have found social circles vastly more  foreign to me. The speech of the Bostonians of the twentieth century  differs even less from that of their cultured ancestors of the  nineteenth than did that of the latter from the language of Washington  and Franklin, while the differences between the style of dress and  furniture of the two epochs are not more marked than I have known  fashion to make in the time of one generation.        Chapter 5    When, in the course of the evening the ladies retired, leaving Dr.  Leete and myself alone, he sounded me as to my disposition for sleep,  saying that if I felt like it my bed was ready for me; but if I was  inclined to wakefulness nothing would please him better than to bear me  company. \"I am a late bird, myself,\" he said, \"and, without suspicion  of flattery, I may say that a companion more interesting than yourself  could scarcely be imagined. It is decidedly not often that one has a  chance to converse with a man of the nineteenth century.\"    Now I had been looking forward all the evening with some dread to the  time when I should be alone, on retiring for the night. Surrounded by  these most friendly strangers, stimulated and supported by their  sympathetic interest, I had been able to keep my mental balance. Even  then, however, in pauses of the conversation I had had glimpses, vivid  as lightning flashes, of the horror of strangeness that was waiting to  be faced when I could no longer command diversion. I knew I could not  sleep that night, and as for lying awake and thinking, it argues no  cowardice, I am sure, to confess that I was afraid of it. When, in  reply to my host's question, I frankly told him this, he replied that  it would be strange if I did not feel just so, but that I need have no  anxiety about sleeping; whenever I wanted to go to bed, he would give  me a dose which would insure me a sound night's sleep without fail.  Next morning, no doubt, I would awake with the feeling of an old  citizen.    \"Before I acquired that,\" I replied, \"I must know a little more about  the sort of Boston I have come back to. You told me when we were upon  the house-top that though a century only had elapsed since I fell  asleep, it had been marked by greater changes in the conditions of  humanity than many a previous millennium. With the city before me I  could well believe that, but I am very curious to know what some of the  changes have been. To make a beginning somewhere, for the subject is  doubtless a large one, what solution, if any, have you found for the  labor question? It was the Sphinx's riddle of the nineteenth century,  and when I dropped out the Sphinx was threatening to devour society,  because the answer was not forthcoming. It is well worth sleeping a  hundred years to learn what the right answer was, if, indeed, you have  found it yet.\"    \"As no such thing as the labor question is known nowadays,\" replied Dr.  Leete, \"and there is no way in which it could arise, I suppose we may  claim to have solved it. Society would indeed have fully deserved being  devoured if it had failed to answer a riddle so entirely simple. In  fact, to speak by the book, it was not necessary for society to solve  the riddle at all. It may be said to have solved itself. The solution  came as the result of a process of industrial evolution which could not  have terminated otherwise. All that society had to do was to recognize  and cooperate with that evolution, when its tendency had become  unmistakable.\"    \"I can only say,\" I answered, \"that at the time I fell asleep no such  evolution had been recognized.\"    \"It was in 1887 that you fell into this sleep, I think you said.\"    \"Yes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/626"],[0,"The Love of Books: The Philobiblon of Richard de Bury (#6)"],[1,"n, ye would have been deservedly happy, if ye had been  allowed to beget offspring like yourselves, and to leave no degenerate  or doubtful progeny for the benefit of future times.    But, painful to relate, now slothful Thersites handles the arms of  Achilles and the choice trappings of war-horses are spread upon lazy  asses, winking owls lord it in the eagle's nest, and the cowardly kite  sits upon the perch of the hawk.      Liber Bacchus is ever loved,    And is into their bellies shoved,    By day and by night;    Liber Codex is neglected,    And with scornful hand rejected    Far out of their sight.    And as if the simple monastic folk of modern times were deceived by a  confusion of names, while Liber Pater is preferred to Liber Patrum, the  study of the monks nowadays is in the emptying of cups and not the  emending of books; to which they do not hesitate to add the wanton  music of Timotheus, jealous of chastity, and thus the song of the  merry-maker and not the chant of the mourner is become the office of  the monks.  Flocks and fleeces, crops and granaries, leeks and  potherbs, drink and goblets, are nowadays the reading and study of the  monks, except a few elect ones, in whom lingers not the image but some  slight vestige of the fathers that preceded them.  And again, no  materials at all are furnished us to commend the canons regular for  their care or study of us, who though they bear their name of honour  from their twofold rule, yet have neglected the notable clause of  Augustine's rule, in which we are commended to his clergy in these  words:  Let books be asked for each day at a given hour; he who asks  for them after the hour is not to receive them.  Scarcely anyone  observes this devout rule of study after saying the prayers of the  Church, but to care for the things of this world and to look at the  plough that has been left is reckoned the highest wisdom.  They take up  bow and quiver, embrace arms and shield, devote the tribute of alms to  dogs and not to the poor, become the slaves of dice and draughts, and  of all such things as we are wont to forbid even to the secular clergy,  so that we need not marvel if they disdain to look upon us, whom they  see so much opposed to their mode of life.    Come then, reverend fathers, deign to recall your fathers and devote  yourselves more faithfully to the study of holy books, without which  all religion will stagger, without which the virtue of devotion will  dry up like a sherd, and without which ye can afford no light to the  world.        CHAPTER VI    THE COMPLAINT OF BOOKS AGAINST THE MENDICANTS    Poor in spirit, but most rich in faith, off-scourings of the world and  salt of the earth, despisers of the world and fishers of men, how happy  are ye, if suffering penury for Christ ye know how to possess your  souls in patience!  For it is not want the avenger of iniquity, nor the  adverse fortune of your parents, nor violent necessity that has thus  oppressed you with beggary, but a devout will and Christ-like election,  by which ye have chosen that life as the best, which God Almighty made  man as well by word as by example declared to be the best.  In truth,  ye are the latest offspring of the ever-fruitful Church, of late  divinely substituted for the Fathers and the Prophets, that your sound  may go forth into all the earth, and that instructed by our healthful  doctrines ye may preach before all kings and nations the invincible  faith of Christ.  Moreover, that the faith of the Fathers is chiefly  enshrined in books the second chapter has sufficiently shown, from  which it is clearer than light that ye ought to be zealous lovers of  books above all other Christians.  Ye are commanded to sow upon all  waters, because the Most High is no respecter of persons, nor does the  Most Holy desire the death of sinners, who offered Himself to die for  them, but desires to heal the contrite in heart, to raise the fallen,  and to correct the perverse in the spirit of lenity.  For which most  salutary purpose our kindly Mother Church has planted you freely, and  having planted has watered you with favours, and having watered you has  established you with privileges, that ye may be co-workers with pastors  and curates in procuring the salvation of faithful souls.  Wherefore,  that the order of Preachers was principally instituted for the study of  the Holy Scriptures and the salvation of their neighbours, is declared  by their constitutions, so that not only from the rule of Bishop  Augustine, which directs books to be asked for every day, but as soon  as they have read the prologue of the said constitutions they may know  from the very title of the same that they are pledged to the love of  books.    But alas! a threefold care of superfluities, viz., of the stomach, of  dress, and of houses, has seduced these men and others following their  example from the paternal care of books, and from their study.  For,  forgetting the providence of the Saviour (who is declared by the  Psalmist to think upon the poor and needy), they are occupied with the  wants of the perishing body, that their feasts may be splendid and  their garments luxurious, against the rule, and the fabrics of their  buildings, like the battlements of castles, carried to a height  incompatible with poverty.  Because of these three things, we books,  who have ever procured their advancement and have granted them to sit  among the powerful and noble, are put far from their heart's affection  and are reckoned as superfluities; except that they rely upon some  treatises of small value, from which they derive strange heresies and  apocryphal imbecilities, not for the refreshment of souls, but rather  for tickling the ears of the listeners.  The Holy Scripture is not  expounded, but is neglected and treated as though it were commonplace  and known to all, though very few have touched its hem, and though its  depth is such, as Holy Augustine declares, that it cannot be understood  by the human intellect, however long it may toil with the utmost  intensity of study.  From this he who devotes himself to it  assiduously, if only He will vouchsafe to open the door who has  established the spirit of piety, may unfold a thousand lessons of moral  teaching, which will flourish with the freshest novelty and will  cherish the intelligence of the listeners with the most delightful  savours. Wherefore the first professors of evangelical poverty, after  some slight homage paid to secular science, collecting all their force  of intellect, devoted themselves to labours upon the sacred scripture,  meditating day and night on the law of the Lord.  And whatever they  could steal from their famishing belly, or intercept from their  half-covered body, they thought it the highest gain to spend in buying  or correcting books.  Whose worldly contemporaries observing their  devotion and study bestowed upon them for the edification of the whole  Church the books which they had collected at great expense in the  various parts of the world.    In truth, in these days as ye are engaged with all diligence in pursuit  of gain, it may be reasonably believed, if we speak according to human  notions, that God thinks less upon those whom He perceives to distrust  His promises, putting their hope in human providence, not considering  the raven, nor the lilies, whom the Most High feeds and arrays.  Ye do  not think upon Daniel and the bearer of the mess of boiled pottage, nor  recollect Elijah who was delivered from hunger once in the desert by  angels, again in the torrent by ravens, and again in Sarepta by the  widow, through the divine bounty, which gives to all flesh their meat  in due season.  Ye descend (as we fear) by a wretched anticlimax,  distrust of the divine goodness producing reliance upon your own  prudence, and reliance upon your own prudence begetting anxiety about  worldly things, and excessive anxiety about worldly things taking away  the love as well as the study of books; and thus poverty in these days  is abused to the injury of the Word of God, which ye have chosen only  for profit's sake.    With summer fruit, as the people gossip, ye attract boys to religion,  whom when they have taken the vows ye do not instruct by fear and  force, as their age requires, but allow them to devote themselves to  begging expeditions, and suffer them to spend the time, in which they  might be learning, in procuring the favour of friends, to the annoyance  of their parents, the danger of the boys, and the detriment of the  order.  And thus no doubt it happens that those who were not compelled  to learn as unwilling boys, when they grow up presume to teach though  utterly unworthy and unlearned, and a small error in the beginning  becomes a very great one in the end.  For there grows up among your  promiscuous flock of laity a pestilent multitude of creatures, who  nevertheless the more shamelessly force themselves into the office of  preaching, the less they understand what they are saying, to the  contempt of the Divine Word and the injury of souls.  In truth, against  the law ye plough with an ox and an ass together, in committing the  cultivation of the Lord's field to learned and unlearned.  Side by  side, it is written, the oxen were ploughing and the asses feeding  beside them: since it is the duty of the discreet to preach, but of the  simple to feed themselves in silence by the hearing of sacred  eloquence.  How many stones ye fling upon the heap of Mercury nowadays!  How many marriages ye procure for the eunuchs of wisdom!  How many  blind watchmen ye bid go round about the walls of the Church!    O idle fishermen, using only the nets of others, which when torn it is  all ye can do to clumsily repair, but can net no new ones of your own!  ye enter on the labours of others, ye repeat the lessons of others, ye  mouth with theatric effort the superficially repeated wisdom of others.  As the silly parrot imitates the "]]]
