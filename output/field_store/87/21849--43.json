The phratry was without governmental functions in the strict sense  of the phrase, these being confined to the gens tribe and confederacy;  but it entered into their social affairs with large administrative  powers, and would have concerned itself more and more with their  religious affairs as the condition of the people advanced. Unlike  the Grecian phratry and the Roman curia, it had no official head.  There was no chief of the phratry as such, and no religious  functionaries belonging to it as distinguished from the gene and  tribe. The phratric institution among the Iroquois was in its  rudimentary archaic form; but it grew into life by natural and  inevitable development, and remained permanent because it met  necessary wants Every institution of mankind which attained  permanence will be found linked with a perpetual want. With the gens  tribe and confederacy in existence the presence of the phratry was  substantially assured. It required time, however, and further  experience to manifest all the uses to which it might be made  subservient.    Among the Village Indians of Mexico and Central America the phratry  must have existed, reasoning upon general principles, and have been  a more fully developed and influential organization than among the  Iroquois Unfortunately mere glimpses at such an institution are all  that can be found in the teeming narratives of the Spanish writers  within the first century after the Spanish conquest. The four  \"lineages\" of the Tlascalans who occupied the four quarters of the  pueblo of Tlascalan were, in all probability, so many phratries. They  were sufficiently numerous for four tribes, but as they occupied the  same pueblo and spoke the same dialect the phratric organization was  apparently a necessity. Each lineage or phratry, so to call it, had  a distinct military organization, a peculiar costume and banner, and  its head war-chief (Teuctli), who was its general military commander.  They went forth to battle by phratries. The organization of a  military force by phratries and by tribes was not unknown to the  Homeric Greeks Thus, Nestor advised Agamemnon to \"separate the  troops by phratries and by tribes, so that phratry may support  phratry and tribe\" [Footnote: Illiad]    Under gentile institutions of the most advanced type the principle  of kin became to a considerable extent the basis of the army  organization. The Aztecs, in like manner occupied the pueblo of  Mexico in four distinct divisions, the people of each of which were  more nearly related to each other than to the people of the other  divisions. They were separate lineages, like the Tlas-calan, and it  seems highly probable were four phratries, separately organized as  such They were distinguished from each--other by costumes and  standards, and went out to war as separate divisions. Their  geographical areas were called the four quarters of Mexico.    With respect to the prevalence of this organization among the Indian  tribes in the Lower Status of barbarism the subject has been but  slightly investigated. It is probable that it was general in the  principal tribes from the natural manner in which it springs up as a  necessary member of the organic series, and from the uses, other  than governmental, to which it was adapted.    In some of the tribes the phratries stand out prominently upon the  face of their organization. Thus the Chocta gentes are united in two  phratries which must be mentioned first in order to show the  relation of the gentes to each other. The first phratry is called  \"Divided People,\" and contains four gentes. The second is called  \"Beloved People\" and also contains four gentes. This separation of  the people into two divisions by gentes created two phratries. Some  knowledge of the functions of these phratries is of course desirable,  but without it, the fact of their existence is established by the  divisions themselves. The evolution of a confederacy from a pair of  gentes--for less than two are never found in any tribe--may be  deduced theoretically from the known facts of Indian experience.  Thus the gens increases in the number of its members and divides  into two these again subdivide and in time reunite in two or more  phratries. These phratries form a tribe and its members speak the  same dialect. In course of time this tribe falls into several by the  process of segmentation, which in turn reunite in a confederacy.  Such a confederacy is a growth, through the tribe and phratry, from  a pair of gentes.    The Chickasas are organized in two phratries, of which one contains  four and the other eight gentes, as follows:    I. Panther Phratry.    Gentes. Wild Cat 2. Bird. 3. Fish. 4. Deer.    II. Spanish Phratry.    Gentes--5. Raccoon. 6. Spanish. 7. Royal. 8. Hush-ko'-ni. 9.  Squirrel 10. Alligator. 11 Wolf. 12. Blackbird.    A very complete illustration of the manner in which phratries are  formed by natural growth through the subdivision of gentes is  presented by the organization of the Mohegan tribe. It had three  original gentes, the Wolf, the Turtle, and the Turkey.    Each of these subdivided, and the subdivisions became independent  gentes; but they retained the names of the original gentes as their  respective phratric names In other words, the subdivisions of each  gens reorganized in a phratry. It proves conclusively the natural  process by which in course of time a gens breaks up into several,  and these remain united in a phratric organization, which is  expressed by assuming a phratric name. They are as follows:    I. Wolf Phratry    Gentes. 1. Wolf 2. Bear 3. Dog. 4 Opossum.    II. Turtle Phratry    Gentes--5 Little Turtle. 6. Mud Turtle. 7. Great Turtle     8. Yellow Eel.    III. Turkey Phratry    Gentes--9. Turkey 10. Crane 11. Chicken 12.    It is thus seen that the original Wolf gens divided into four gentes,  the Turtle into four, and the Turkey into three. Each new gens took  a new name, the original retaining its own, which became by  seniority that of the phratry. It is rare among the American Indian  tribes to find such plain evidence of the segmentation of gentes in  their external organization, followed by the formation into  phratries of their respective subdivisions. It shows also that the  phratry is founded upon the kinship of the gentes. As a rule, the  name of the original gens out of which others had formed is not known;  but in each of these cases it remains as the name of the phratry.  Since the latter, like the Grecian, was a social and religious  rather than a governmental organization, it is externally less  conspicuous than a gens or tribe, which were essential to the  government of society. The name of but one of the twelve Athenian  phratries has come down to us in history. Those of the Iroquois had  no name but that of a brotherhood.    The phratry also appears among the Thlinkits of the Northwest coast  upon the surface of their organization into gentes. They have two  phratries, as follows:    I. Wolf Phratry.    Gentes. 1. Bear 2. Eagle. 3. Dolphin. 4. Shark. 5. Alca.    II. Raven Phratry.    Gentes. 6. Frog. 7. Goose. 8. Sea-lion. 9. Owl. 10. Salmon.    Intermarriage in the phratry is prohibited, which shows of itself  that the gentes of each phratry were derived from an original gens.  The members of any gens in the Wolf phratry could marry into any  gens of the opposite phratry, and vice versa.    From the foregoing facts the existence of the phratry is established  in several linguistic stocks of the American aborigines. Its  presence in the tribes named raises a presumption of its general  prevalence in the Ganowanian family. Among the Village Indians,  where the numbers in a gens and tribe were greater, it would  necessarily have been more important, and consequently more fully  developed. As an institution it was still in its archaic form, but  it possessed the essential elements of the Grecian and the Roman.        THE TRIBE.      It is difficult to describe an Indian tribe by the affirmative  elements of its composition. Nevertheless it is clearly marked, and  is the ultimate organization of the great body of the American  aborigines. The large number of independent tribes into which they  had fallen by the natural process of segmentation is the striking  characteristic of their condition. Each tribe was individualized by  a name, by a separate dialect, by a supreme government, and by the  possession of a territory which it occupied and defended as its own.  The tribes were as numerous as the dialects, for separation did not  become complete until dialectical variation had commenced. Indian  tribes, therefore, are natural growths through the separation of the  same people in the area of their occupation, followed by divergence  of speech, segmentation, and independence.    The exclusive possession of a dialect and of a territory has led to  the application of the term nation to many Indian tribes,  notwithstanding the fewness of the people in each. Tribe and nation,  however, are not strict equivalents. A nation does not arise, under  gentile institutions, until the tribes united under the same  government have coalesced into one people, as the four Athenian  tribes coalesced in Attica, three Dorian tribes at Sparta, and three  Latin and Sabine tribes at Rome. Federation requires independent  tribes in separate territorial areas; but coalescence unites them by  a higher process in the same area, although the tendency to local  separation by gentes and by tribes would continue. The confederacy  is the nearest analogue of the nation, but not strictly equivalent.  Where the gentile organization exists, the organic series gives all  the terms which are needed for a correct description.    An Indian tribe is composed of several gentes, developed from two or  more, all the members of which are intermingled by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8115"],[0,"Authors of Greece (#6)"],[1,"nurse Eurycleia conceal from his mother his departure.    In Pylos Nestor told him all he knew of Odysseus, describing the sorrows  which came upon the Greek leaders on their return and especially the  evil end of Agamemnon. He added that Menelaus had just returned to  Sparta and was far more likely to know the truth than any other, for  he had wandered widely over the seas on his home-coming. Bidding Nestor  look after Telemachus, Athena vanished from his sight, but not before  she was recognised by the old hero. On the morrow Telemachus set out for  Sparta, accompanied by Pisistratus, one of Nestor's sons.    Menelaus gave them a kindly welcome and a casual mention of his father's  name stirred Telemachus to tears. At that moment Helen entered; her  quicker perception at once traced the resemblance between the young  stranger and Odysseus. When Telemachus admitted his identity, Helen told  some of his father's deeds. Once he entered Troy disguised as a beggar,  unrecognised of all save Helen herself. \"After he made her swear an oath  that she would not betray him, he revealed all the plans of the Greeks.  Then, after slaying many Trojans, he departed with much knowledge,  while Helen's heart rejoiced, for she was already bent on a return home,  repenting of the blindness which Aphrodite had sent her in persuading  her to abandon home and daughter and a husband who lacked naught,  neither wit not manhood.\" Menelaus then recounted how Odysseus saved  him when they were in the wooden horse, when one false sound would have  betrayed them. On the next morning Telemachus told the story of the ruin  of his home; Menelaus prophesied the end of the suitors, then preceded  to recount how in Egypt he waylaid and captured Proteus, the changing  god of the sea, whom he compelled to relate the fate of the Greek  leaders and to prophesy his own return; from him he heard that Odysseus  was with Calypso who kept him by force. On learning this important piece  of news Telemachus was eager to return to Ithaca with all speed.    Meanwhile the suitors had learned of the departure of Telemachus and  plotted to intercept him on his return. Their treachery was told to  Penelope, who was utterly undone on hearing it; feeling herself left  without a human protector she prayed to Athena, who appeared to her in  a dream in the likeness of her own sister to assure her that Athena was  watching over her, but refusing to say definitely whether Odysseus was  alive.    The poem at this point takes up the story of Odysseus himself. Going  to the isle where he was held captive, Hermes after admiring its great  beauty delivered Zeus' message to Calypso to let the captive go. She  reproached the gods for their jealousy and reluctantly promised to obey.  She found Odysseus on the shore, eating out his heart in the desire  for his home. When she informed him that she intended to let him go, he  first with commendable prudence made her swear that she did not design  some greater evil for him. Smiling at his cunning, she swore the most  solemn of all oaths to help him, then supplied tools and materials for  the building of his boat. When he was out on the deep, Poseidon wrecked  his craft, but a sea goddess Leucothea, once a mortal, gave him a scarf  to wrap round him, bidding him cast it from him with his back turned  away when he got to land. After two nights and two days on the deep he  at length saw land. Finding the mouth of a small stream, he swam up it,  then utterly weary flung himself down on a heap of leaves under a bush,  guarded by Athena.    The next episode introduces one of the most charming figures in ancient  literature. Nausicaa was the daughter of Alcinous, King of Phaeacia,  on whose island Odysseus had landed. To her Athena appeared in a dream,  bidding her obtain from her father leave to go down to the sea to wash  his soiled garments. The young girl obeyed, telling her father that it  was but seemly that he, the first man in the kingdom, should appear at  council in raiment white as snow. He gave her the leave she desired.  After their work was done, she and her handmaids began a game of ball;  their merry cries woke up Odysseus, who started up on hearing human  voices. Coming forward, he frightened by his appearance the handmaids,  but Nausicaa, emboldened by Athena, stood still and listened to his  story. She supplied him with clean garments after she had given him food  and drink. On the homeward journey Nausicaa bade Odysseus bethink him of  the inconvenient talk which his presence would occasion if he were seen  with her near the city. She therefore judged it best that she should  enter first, at the same time she gave him full information of the road  to the palace; when he entered it he was to proceed straight to the  Queen Arete, whose favour was indispensable if he desired a return home.    Just outside the city Athena met him in the guise of a girl to tell him  his way; she further cast about him a thick cloud to protect him from  curious eyes. Passing through the King's gardens, which were a marvel of  beauty and fruitfulness, Odysseus entered the palace and threw his arms  in supplication about Arete's knees. She listened kindly to him and  begged Alcinous give him welcome. When all the courtiers had retired to  rest, Arete, noticing that the garments Odysseus wore had been woven by  her own hands, asked him whence he had them and how he had come to the  island. On hearing the story of his shipwreck Alcinous promised him a  safe convoy to his home on the morrow.    At an assembly Alcinous consulted with his counsellors about Odysseus;  all agreed to help in providing him with a ship and rowers. At a trial  of skill Odysseus, after being taunted by some of the Phaeacians, hurled  the quoit beyond them all. Later, a song of the wooden horse of Troy  moved him to tears; though unnoticed by the others, he did not escape  the eye of Alcinous who bade him tell them plainly who he was. Then he  revealed himself and told the marvellous story of his wanderings.    First he and his companions reached the land of the Lotus-eaters.  Finding out that the lotus made all who ate it lose their desire for  home, Odysseus sailed away with all speed, forcing away some who had  tasted the plant. Thence they reached the island of the Cyclopes, a  wild race who knew no ordinances; each living in his cave was a law  to himself, caring nothing for the others. Leaving his twelve ships,  Odysseus proceeded with some of his men to the cave of one of the  Cyclopes, a son of Poseidon, taking with him a skin of wine. When the  one-eyed monster returned with his flock of sheep, he shut the mouth of  the cave with a mighty stone which no mortal could move; then lighting  a fire he caught sight of his visitors and asked who they were. Odysseus  answered craftily, whereupon the monster devoured six of his company.  Odysseus opened his wine-skin and offered some of the wine; when the  Cyclops asked his name, Odysseus told him he was called Noman; in return  for his kindness in offering him the strangely sweet drink the Cyclops  promised to eat him last of all. But the wine soon plunged the monster  into a slumber, from which he was awakened by the burning end of a great  stake which Odysseus thrust into his eye. On hearing his cries of agony  the other Cyclopes came to him, but went away when they heard that Noman  was killing him. As it was impossible for anyone but the Cyclops to open  the cave, Odysseus tied his men beneath the cattle, putting the beast  which carried a man between two which were unburdened; he himself hung  on to the ram. As the animals passed out, the Cyclops was a little  surprised that the ram went last, but thought he did so out of grief  for his master. When they were all safely outside, Odysseus freed his  friends and made haste to get to the ship. Thrusting out, when he was  at what seemed a safe distance he shouted to the Cyclops, who then  remembered an old prophecy and hurled a huge rock which nearly washed  them back; a second rock which he hurled on learning Odysseus' real name  narrowly missed the ship. Then the Cyclops prayed to Poseidon to punish  Odysseus; the god heard him, persecuting him from that time onward.  Reassembling his ships, Odysseus proceeded on his voyage.    He next called at the isle of Aeolus, king of the winds, who gave him in  a bag all the winds but one, a favouring breeze which was to waft him  to his own island. For nine days Odysseus guarded his bag, but at last,  when Ithaca was in sight, he sank into a sleep of exhaustion. Thinking  that the bag concealed some treasure, his men opened it, only to be  blown back to Aeolus who bid him begone as an evil man when he begged  aid a second time.    After visiting the Laestrygones, a man-eating people, who devoured all  the fleet except one ship's company, the remainder reached Aeaea,  the island where lived the dread goddess Circe. Odysseus sent forward  Eurylochus with some twenty companions who found Circe weaving at a  loom. Seeing them she invited them within; then after giving them a  charmed potion she smote them with her rod, turning them into swine.  Eurylochus who had suspected some trickery hurried back to Odysseus with  the news. The latter determined to go alone to save his friends. On the  way he was met by Hermes, who showed him the herb moly, an antidote to  Circe's draught. Finding that her magic failed, she at once knew that  her visitor was Odysseus whose visit had been prophesied to her by  Hermes. He bound her down by a solemn oath to refrain from further  mischief and persuaded her to restore to his men their humanity. When  Odysseus desired to depart home, she told him of the wanderings that  awaited him. First he must go to the land of the dead to consult the  shade of Teiresias, the blind old prophet, who would help him.    Following the goddess' instructions, they sailed to the land of the  Cimmerians on the"]]]
