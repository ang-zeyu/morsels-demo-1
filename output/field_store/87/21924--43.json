You just do as you're told, that's all you've got to  do,' said Jack, and he went home to get dressed and bring his wife.    After the dancing started that night I had a peep in once or twice. The  first time I saw Mary dancing with Jack, and looking serious; and the  second time she was dancing with the blarsted Jackaroo dude, and looking  excited and happy. I noticed that some of the girls, that I could see  sitting on a stool along the opposite wall, whispered, and gave Mary  black looks as the Jackaroo swung her past. It struck me pretty forcibly  that I should have taken fighting lessons from him instead of from poor  Romany. I went away and walked about four miles down the river road,  getting out of the way into the Bush whenever I saw any chap riding  along. I thought of poor Romany and wondered where he was, and thought  that there wasn't much to choose between us as far as happiness was  concerned. Perhaps he was walking by himself in the Bush, and feeling  like I did. I wished I could shake hands with him.    But somehow, about half-past ten, I drifted back to the river slip-rails  and leant over them, in the shadow of the peppermint-tree, looking at  the rows of river-willows in the moonlight. I didn't expect anything, in  spite of what Jack said.    I didn't like the idea of hanging myself: I'd been with a party who  found a man hanging in the Bush, and it was no place for a woman round  where he was. And I'd helped drag two bodies out of the Cudgeegong river  in a flood, and they weren't sleeping beauties. I thought it was a pity  that a chap couldn't lie down on a grassy bank in a graceful position in  the moonlight and die just by thinking of it--and die with his eyes  and mouth shut. But then I remembered that I wouldn't make a beautiful  corpse, anyway it went, with the face I had on me.    I was just getting comfortably miserable when I heard a step behind me,  and my heart gave a jump. And I gave a start too.    'Oh, is that you, Mr Wilson?' said a timid little voice.    'Yes,' I said. 'Is that you, Mary?'    And she said yes. It was the first time I called her Mary, but she did  not seem to notice it.    'Did I frighten you?' I asked.    'No--yes--just a little,' she said. 'I didn't know there was any  one----' then she stopped.    'Why aren't you dancing?' I asked her.    'Oh, I'm tired,' she said. 'It was too hot in the wool-shed. I thought  I'd like to come out and get my head cool and be quiet a little while.'    'Yes,' I said, 'it must be hot in the wool-shed.'    She stood looking out over the willows. Presently she said, 'It must be  very dull for you, Mr Wilson--you must feel lonely. Mr Barnes said----'  Then she gave a little gasp and stopped--as if she was just going to put  her foot in it.    'How beautiful the moonlight looks on the willows!' she said.    'Yes,' I said, 'doesn't it? Supposing we have a stroll by the river.'    'Oh, thank you, Mr Wilson. I'd like it very much.'    I didn't notice it then, but, now I come to think of it, it was a  beautiful scene: there was a horseshoe of high blue hills round behind  the house, with the river running round under the slopes, and in front  was a rounded hill covered with pines, and pine ridges, and a soft blue  peak away over the ridges ever so far in the distance.    I had a handkerchief over the worst of my face, and kept the best side  turned to her. We walked down by the river, and didn't say anything for  a good while. I was thinking hard. We came to a white smooth log in a  quiet place out of sight of the house.    'Suppose we sit down for a while, Mary,' I said.    'If you like, Mr Wilson,' she said.    There was about a foot of log between us.    'What a beautiful night!' she said.    'Yes,' I said, 'isn't it?'    Presently she said, 'I suppose you know I'm going away next month, Mr  Wilson?'    I felt suddenly empty. 'No,' I said, 'I didn't know that.'    'Yes,' she said, 'I thought you knew. I'm going to try and get into the  hospital to be trained for a nurse, and if that doesn't come off I'll  get a place as assistant public-school teacher.'    We didn't say anything for a good while.    'I suppose you won't be sorry to go, Miss Brand?' I said.    'I--I don't know,' she said. 'Everybody's been so kind to me here.'    She sat looking straight before her, and I fancied her eyes glistened.  I put my arm round her shoulders, but she didn't seem to notice it. In  fact, I scarcely noticed it myself at the time.    'So you think you'll be sorry to go away?' I said.    'Yes, Mr Wilson. I suppose I'll fret for a while. It's been my home, you  know.'    I pressed my hand on her shoulder, just a little, so as she couldn't  pretend not to know it was there. But she didn't seem to notice.    'Ah, well,' I said, 'I suppose I'll be on the wallaby again next week.'    'Will you, Mr Wilson?' she said. Her voice seemed very soft.    I slipped my arm round her waist, under her arm. My heart was going like  clockwork now.    Presently she said--    'Don't you think it's time to go back now, Mr Wilson?'    'Oh, there's plenty of time!' I said. I shifted up, and put my arm  farther round, and held her closer. She sat straight up, looking right  in front of her, but she began to breathe hard.    'Mary,' I said.    'Yes,' she said.    'Call me Joe,' I said.    'I--I don't like to,' she said. 'I don't think it would be right.'    So I just turned her face round and kissed her. She clung to me and  cried.    'What is it, Mary?' I asked.    She only held me tighter and cried.    'What is it, Mary?' I said. 'Ain't you well? Ain't you happy?'    'Yes, Joe,' she said, 'I'm very happy.' Then she said, 'Oh, your poor  face! Can't I do anything for it?'    'No,' I said. 'That's all right. My face doesn't hurt me a bit now.'    But she didn't seem right.    'What is it, Mary?' I said. 'Are you tired? You didn't sleep last  night----' Then I got an inspiration.    'Mary,' I said, 'what were you doing out with the gun this morning?'    And after some coaxing it all came out, a bit hysterical.    'I couldn't sleep--I was frightened. Oh! I had such a terrible dream  about you, Joe! I thought Romany came back and got into your room and  stabbed you with his knife. I got up and dressed, and about daybreak  I heard a horse at the gate; then I got the gun down from the  wall--and--and Mr Barnes came round the corner and frightened me. He's  something like Romany, you know.'    Then I got as much of her as I could into my arms.    And, oh, but wasn't I happy walking home with Mary that night! She was  too little for me to put my arm round her waist, so I put it round  her shoulder, and that felt just as good. I remember I asked her who'd  cleaned up my room and washed my things, but she wouldn't tell.    She wouldn't go back to the dance yet; she said she'd go into her room  and rest a while. There was no one near the old verandah; and when she  stood on the end of the floor she was just on a level with my shoulder.    'Mary,' I whispered, 'put your arms round my neck and kiss me.'    She put her arms round my neck, but she didn't kiss me; she only hid her  face.    'Kiss me, Mary!' I said.    'I--I don't like to,' she whispered.    'Why not, Mary?'    Then I felt her crying or laughing, or half crying and half laughing.  I'm not sure to this day which it was.    'Why won't you kiss me, Mary? Don't you love me?'    'Because,' she said, 'because--because I--I don't--I don't think it's  right for--for a girl to--to kiss a man unless she's going to be his  wife.'    Then it dawned on me! I'd forgot all about proposing.    'Mary,' I said, 'would you marry a chap like me?'    And that was all right.         *****    Next morning Mary cleared out my room and sorted out my things, and  didn't take the slightest notice of the other girls' astonishment.    But she made me promise to speak to old Black, and I did the same  evening. I found him sitting on the log by the fence, having a yarn on  the quiet with an old Bushman; and when the old Bushman got up and went  away, I sat down.    'Well, Joe,' said Black, 'I see somebody's been spoiling your face for  the dance.' And after a bit he said, 'Well, Joe, what is it? Do you want  another job? If you do, you'll have to ask Mrs Black, or Bob' (Bob was  his eldest son); 'they're managing the station for me now, you know.' He  could be bitter sometimes in his quiet way.    'No,' I said; 'it's not that, Boss.'    'Well, what is it, Joe?'    'I--well the fact is, I want little Mary.'    He puffed at his pipe for a long time, then I thought he spoke.    'What did you say, Boss?' I said.    'Nothing, Joe,' he said. 'I was going to say a lot, but it wouldn't be  any use. My father used to say a lot to me before I was married.'    I waited a good while for him to speak.    'Well, Boss,' I said, 'what about Mary?'    'Oh! I suppose that's all right, Joe,' he said. 'I--I beg your pardon. I  got thinking of the days when I was courting Mrs Black.'          Brighten's Sister-In-Law.      Jim was born on Gulgong, New South Wales. We used to say 'on'  Gulgong--and old diggers still talked of being 'on th' Gulgong'--though  the goldfield there had been worked out for years, and the place was  only a dusty little pastoral town in the scrubs. Gulgong was about the  last of the great alluvial 'rushes' of the 'roaring days'--and dreary  and dismal enough it looked when I was there. The expression 'on' came  from being on the 'diggings' or goldfield--the workings or the goldfield  was all underneath, of course, so we lived (or starved) ON them--not in  nor at 'em.    Mary and I had been married about two years when Jim came----His name  wasn't 'Jim', by the way, it was 'John Henry', after an uncle godfather;  but we called him Jim from the first--(and before it)--because Jim was a  popular Bush name, and most of my old mates were Jims.

For them it  is a weapon of the weak, an expedient. They consider non-co-operation  without violence to be the only thing open to them in the war of direct  action. I know that if some of them could offer successful violence,  they would do to-day. But they are convinced that humanly speaking it is  an impossibility. For them, therefore, non-co-operation is a matter not  merely of duty but also of revenge. Whereas I take up non-co-operation  against the Government as I have actually taken it up in practice  against members of my own family. I entertain very high regard for the  British constitution, I have not only no enmity against Englishmen but I  regard much in English character as worthy of my emulation. I count many  as my friends. It is against my religion to regard any one as an enemy.  I entertain similar sentiments with respect to Mahomedans. I find their  cause to be just and pure. Although therefore their viewpoint is  different from mine I do not hesitate to associate with them and invite  them to give my method a trial, for, I believe that the use of a pure  weapon even from a mistaken motive does not fail to produce some good,  even as the telling of truth if only because for the time being it is  the best policy, is at least so much to the good.      MR. CANDLER'S OPEN LETTER    Mr. Candler has favoured me with an open letter on this question of  questions. The letter has already appeared in the Press. I can  appreciate Mr. Candler's position as I would like him and other  Englishmen to appreciate mine and that of hundreds of Hindus who feel as  I do. Mr. Candler's letter is an attempt to show that Mr. Lloyd George's  pledge is not in any way broken by the peace terms. I quite agree with  him that Mr. Lloyd George's words ought not to be torn from their  context to support the Mahomedan claim. These are Mr. Lloyd George's  words as quoted in the recent Viceregal message: \"Nor are we fighting to  destroy Austria-Hungary or to deprive Turkey of its capital or of the  rich and renowned lands of Asia Minor and Thrace which are predominantly  Turkish in race.\" Mr. Candler seems to read 'which', as if it meant 'if  they,' whereas I give the pronoun its natural meaning, namely, that the  Prime Minister knew in 1918, that the lands referred to by him were  \"predominantly Turkish in race.\" And if this is the meaning I venture to  suggest that the pledge has been broken in a most barefaced manner, for  there is practically nothing left to the Turk of 'the rich and renowned  lands of Asia Minor and Thrace.'    I have already my view of the retention of the Sultan in Constantinople.  It is an insult to the intelligence of man to suggest that 'the  maintenance of the Turkish Empire in the homeland of the Turkish race  with its capital at Constantinople has been left unimpaired by the terms  of peace. This is the other passage from the speech which I presume Mr.  Candler wants me to read together with the one already quoted:--       \"While we do not challenge the maintenance of the Turkish Empire in     the home-land of the Turkish race with its capital at Constantinople,     the passage between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea being     inter-nationalised, Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine are in     our judgment entitled to a recognition of their separate national     condition.\"    Did that mean entire removal of Turkish influence, extinction of Turkish  suzerainty and the introduction of European-Christian influence under  the guise of Mandates? Have the Moslems of Arabia, Armenia, Mesopotamia,  Syria and Palestine been committed, or is the new arrangement being  superimposed upon them by Powers conscious of their own brute-strength  rather than of justice of their action? I for one would nurse by every  legitimate means the spirit of independence in the brave Arabs, but I  shudder to think what will happen to them under the schemes of  exploitation of their country by the greedy capitalists protected as  they will be by the mandatory Powers. If the pledge is to be fulfilled,  let these places have full self-government with suzerainty to be  retained with Turkey as has been suggested by the _Times of India_. Let  there be all the necessary guarantees taken from Turkey about the  internal independence of the Arabs. But to remove that suzerainty, to  deprive the Khalif of the wardenship of the Holy Places is to render  Khilafat a mockery which no Mahomedan can possibly look upon with  equanimity, I am not alone in my interpretation of the pledge. The Right  Hon'ble Ameer Ali calls the peace terms a breach of faith. Mr. Charles  Roberts reminds the British public that the Indian Mussalman sentiment  regarding the Turkish Treaty is based upon the Prime Minister's pledge  \"regarding Thrace, Constantinople and Turkish lands in Asia Minor,  repeated on February 26 last with deliberation by Mr. Lloyd George. Mr.  Roberts holds that the pledge must be treated as a whole, not as binding  only regarding Constantinople but also binding as regards Thrace and  Asia Minor. He describes the pledge as binding upon the nation as a  whole and its breach in any part as a gross breach of faith on the part  of the British Empire. He demands that if there is an unanswerable reply  to the charge of breach of faith it ought to be given and adds the Prime  Minister may regard his own word lightly if he chooses, but he has no  right to break a pledge given on behalf of the nation. He concludes that  it is incredible that such pledge should not have been kept in the  letter and in the spirit.\" He adds: \"I have reason to believe that these  views are fully shared by prominent members of the Cabinet.\"    I wonder if Mr. Candler knows what is going on to-day in England. Mr.  Pickthall writing in _New Age_ says: \"No impartial international enquiry  into the whole question of the Armenian massacres has been instituted in  the ample time which has elapsed since the conclusion of armistice with  Turkey. The Turkish Government has asked for such enquiry. But the  Armenian organisations and the Armenian partisans refuse to hear of such  a thing, declaring that the Bryce and Lepssens reports are quite  sufficient to condemn the Turks. In other words the judgment should be  given on the case for prosecution alone. The inter-allied commission  which investigated the unfortunate events in Smyrna last year, made a  report unfavourable to Greek claims. Therefore, that report has not been  published here in England, though in other countries it has long been  public property.\" He then goes on to show how money is being scattered  by Armenian and Greek emissaries in order to popularise their cause and  adds: \"This conjunction of dense ignorance and cunning falsehood is  fraught with instant danger to the British realm,\" and concludes: \"A  Government and people which prefer propaganda to fact as the ground of  policy--and foreign policy at that--is self-condemned.\"    I have reproduced the above extract in order to show that the present  British policy has been affected by propaganda of an unscrupulous  nature. Turkey which was dominant over two million square miles of  Asia, Africa and Europe in the 17th century, under the terms of the  treaty, says the _London Chronicle_, has dwindled down to little more  than 1,000 square miles. It says, \"All European Turkey could now be  accommodated comfortably between the Landsend and the Tamar, Cornawal  alone exceeding its total area and but for its alliance with Germany,  Turkey could have been assured of retaining at least sixty thousand  square miles of the Eastern Balkans.\" I do not know whether the  _Chronicle_ view is generally shared. Is it by way of punishment that  Turkey is to undergo such shrinkage, or is it because justice demands  it? If Turkey had not made the mistake of joining Germany, would the  principle of nationality have been still applied to Armenia, Arabia,  Mesopotamia and Palestine?    Let me now remind those who think with Mr. Candler that the promise was  not made by Mr. Lloyd George to the people of India in anticipation of  the supply of recruits continuing. In defending his own statement Mr.  Lloyd George is reported to have said:       \"The effect of the statement in India was that recruiting went up     appreciably from that very moment. They were not all Mahomedans but     there were many Mahomedans amongst them. Now we are told that was an     offer to Turkey. But they rejected it, and therefore we were     absolutely free. It was not. It is too often forgotten that we are     the greatest Mahomedan power in the world and one-fourth of the     population of the British Empire is Mahomedan. There have been no     more loyal adherents to the throne and no more effective and loyal     supporters of the Empire in its hour of trial. _We gave a solemn     pledge and they accepted it_. They are disturbed by the prospect of     our not abiding by it.\"    Who shall interpret that pledge and how? How did the Government of India  itself interpret it? Did it or did it not energetically support the  claim for the control of the Holy Places of Islam vesting in the Khalif?  Did the Government of India suggest that the whole of Jazirat-ul-Arab  could be taken away consistently with that pledge from the sphere of  influence of the Khalif, and given over to the Allies as mandatory  Powers? Why does the Government of India sympathise with the Indian  Mussalmans if the terms are all they should be? So much for the pledge.  I would like to guard myself against being understood that I stand or  fall absolutely by Mr. Lloyd George's declaration. I have advisedly used  the adverb 'practically' in connection with it. It is an important  qualification.'    Mr. Candler seems to suggest that my goal is something more than merely  attaining justice on the Khilafat. If so, he is right. Attainment of  justice is"]]]
