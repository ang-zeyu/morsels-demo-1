This circumstance may perhaps add to the interest of  a work which pourtrays the state of the greater part of the Spanish  colonies at the beginning of the 19th century. I even venture to  indulge the hope that this work will be thought worthy of attention  when passions shall be hushed into peace, and when, under the  influence of a new social order, those countries shall have made  rapid progress in public welfare. If then some pages of my book are  snatched from oblivion, the inhabitant of the banks of the Orinoco  and the Atabapo will behold with delight populous cities enriched  by commerce, and fertile fields cultivated by the hands of free  men, on those very spots where, at the time of my travels, I found  only impenetrable forests and inundated lands.    ***    PERSONAL NARRATIVE OF A JOURNEY TO THE EQUINOCTIAL REGIONS    OF THE NEW CONTINENT.    VOLUME 1.      CHAPTER 1.1.  PREPARATIONS.  INSTRUMENTS.  DEPARTURE FROM SPAIN.  LANDING AT THE CANARY ISLANDS.    From my earliest youth I felt an ardent desire to travel into  distant regions, seldom visited by Europeans. This desire is  characteristic of a period of our existence when appears an  unlimited horizon, and when we find an irresistible attraction in  the impetuous agitations of the mind, and the image of positive  danger. Though educated in a country which has no direct  communication with either the East or the West Indies, living  amidst mountains remote from coasts, and celebrated for their  numerous mines, I felt an increasing passion for the sea and  distant expeditions. Objects with which we are acquainted only by  the animated narratives of travellers have a peculiar charm;  imagination wanders with delight over that which is vague and  undefined; and the pleasures we are deprived of seem to possess a  fascinating power, compared with which all we daily feel in the  narrow circle of sedentary life appears insipid. The taste for  herborisation, the study of geology, rapid excursions to Holland,  England, and France, with the celebrated Mr. George Forster, who  had the happiness to accompany captain Cook in his second  expedition round the globe, contributed to give a determined  direction to the plan of travels which I had formed at eighteen  years of age. No longer deluded by the agitation of a wandering  life, I was anxious to contemplate nature in all her variety of  wild and stupendous scenery; and the hope of collecting some facts  useful to the advancement of science, incessantly impelled my  wishes towards the luxuriant regions of the torrid zone. As  personal circumstances then prevented me from executing the  projects by which I was so powerfully influenced, I had leisure to  prepare myself during six years for the observations I proposed to  make on the New Continent, as well as to visit different parts of  Europe, and to explore the lofty chain of the Alps, the structure  of which I might afterwards compare with that of the Andes of Quito  and of Peru.    I had traversed a part of Italy in 1795, but had not been able to  visit the volcanic regions of Naples and Sicily; and I regretted  leaving Europe without having seen Vesuvius, Stromboli, and Etna. I  felt, that in order to form a proper judgment of many geological  phenomena, especially of the nature of the rocks of trap-formation,  it was necessary to examine the phenomena presented by burning  volcanoes. I determined therefore to return to Italy in the month  of November, 1797. I made a long stay at Vienna, where the fine  collections of exotic plants, and the friendship of Messrs. de  Jacquin, and Joseph van der Schott, were highly useful to my  preparatory studies. I travelled with M. Leopold von Buch, through  several cantons of Salzburg and Styria, countries alike interesting  to the landscape-painter and the geologist; but just when I was  about to cross the Tyrolese Alps, the war then raging in Italy  obliged me to abandon the project of going to Naples.    A short time before, a gentleman passionately fond of the fine  arts, and who had visited the coasts of Greece and Illyria to  inspect their monuments, made me a proposal to accompany him in an  expedition to Upper Egypt. This expedition was to occupy only eight  months. Provided with astronomical instruments and able  draughtsmen, we were to ascend the Nile as far as Assouan, after  minutely examining the positions of the Said, between Tentyris and  the cataracts. Though my views had not hitherto been fixed on any  region but the tropics, I could not resist the temptation of  visiting countries so celebrated in the annals of human  civilization. I therefore accepted this proposition, but with the  express condition, that on our return to Alexandria I should be at  liberty to continue my journey through Syria and Palestine. The  studies which I entered upon with a view to this new project, I  afterwards found useful, when I examined the relations between the  barbarous monuments of Mexico, and those belonging to the nations  of the old world. I thought myself on the point of embarking for  Egypt, when political events forced me to abandon a plan which  promised me so much satisfaction.    An expedition of discovery in the South Sea, under the direction of  captain Baudin, was then preparing in France. The plan was great,  bold, and worthy of being executed by a more enlightened commander.  The purpose of this expedition was to visit the Spanish possessions  of South America, from the mouth of the river Plata to the kingdom  of Quito and the isthmus of Panama. After visiting the archipelago  of the Pacific, and exploring the coasts of New Holland, from Van  Diemen's Land to that of Nuyts, both vessels were to stop at  Madagascar, and return by the Cape of Good Hope. I was in Paris  when the preparations for this voyage were begun. I had but little  confidence in the personal character of captain Baudin, who had  given cause of discontent to the court of Vienna, when he was  commissioned to conduct to Brazil one of my friends, the young  botanist, Van der Schott; but as I could not hope, with my own  resources, to make a voyage of such extent, and view so fine a  portion of the globe, I determined to take the chances of this  expedition. I obtained permission to embark, with the instruments I  had collected, in one of the vessels destined for the South Sea,  and I reserved to myself the liberty of leaving captain Baudin  whenever I thought proper. M. Michaux, who had already visited  Persia and a part of North America, and M. Bonpland, with whom I  then formed the friendship that still unites us, were appointed to  accompany this expedition as naturalists.    I had flattered myself during several months with the idea of  sharing the labours directed to so great and honourable an object  when the war which broke out in Germany and Italy, determined the  French government to withdraw the funds granted for their voyage of  discovery, and adjourn it to an indefinite period. Deeply mortified  at finding the plans I had formed during many years of my life  overthrown in a single day, I sought at any risk the speediest  means of quitting Europe, and engaging in some enterprise which  might console me for my disappointment.    I became acquainted with a Swedish consul, named Skioldebrand, who  having been appointed by his court to carry presents to the dey of  Algiers, was passing through Paris, to embark at Marseilles. This  estimable man had resided a long time on the coast of Africa; and  being highly respected by the government of Algiers, he could  easily procure me permission to visit that part of the chain of the  Atlas which had not been the object of the important researches of  M. Desfontaines. He despatched every year a vessel for Tunis, where  the pilgrims embarked for Mecca, and he promised to convey me by  the same medium to Egypt. I eagerly seized so favourable an  opportunity, and thought myself on the point of executing a plan  which I had formed previously to my arrival in France. No  mineralogist had yet examined that lofty chain of mountains which,  in the empire of Morocco, rises to the limits of the perpetual  snow. I flattered myself, that, after executing some operations in  the alpine regions of Barbary, I should receive in Egypt from those  illustrious men who had for some months formed the Institute of  Cairo, the same kind attentions with which I had been honoured  during my abode in Paris. I hastily completed my collection of  instruments, and purchased works relating to the countries I was  going to visit. I parted from a brother who, by his advice and  example, had hitherto exercised a great influence on the direction  of my thoughts. He approved the motives which determined me to quit  Europe; a secret voice assured us that we should meet again; and  that hope, which did not prove delusive, assuaged the pain of a  long separation. I left Paris with the intention of embarking for  Algiers and Egypt; but by one of those vicissitudes which sway the  affairs of this life, I returned to my brother from the river  Amazon and Peru, without having touched the continent of Africa.    The Swedish frigate which was to convey M. Skioldebrand to Algiers,  was expected at Marseilles toward the end of October. M. Bonpland  and myself repaired thither with great celerity, for during our  journey we were tormented with the fear of being too late, and  missing our passage.    M. Skioldebrand was no less impatient than ourselves to reach his  place of destination. Several times a day we climbed the mountain  of Notre Dame de la Garde, which commands an extensive view of the  Mediterranean. Every sail we descried in the horizon excited in us  the most eager emotion; but after two months of anxiety and vain  expectation, we learned by the public papers, that the Swedish  frigate which was to convey us, had suffered greatly in a storm on  the coast of Portugal, and had been forced to enter the port of  Cadiz,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6329"],[0,"Catalogue of British Columbia Birds (#6)"],[1,"summer resident on the Mainland.
