He, without a care  For all the affliction of Admetus' halls,  Sang on; and, listening, one could hear the thralls  In the long gallery weeping for the dead.    We let him see no tears. Our master made  That order, that the stranger must not know.    So here I wait in her own house, and do  Service to some black thief, some man of prey;  And she has gone, has gone for ever away.  I never followed her, nor lifted high  My hand to bless her; never said good-bye....  I loved her like my mother. So did all  The slaves. She never let his anger fall  Too hard. She saved us alway....  And this wild beast  Comes in our sorrow when we need him least!    [_During the last few lines_ HERACLES _has entered, unperceived by  the_ SERVANT. _He has evidently bathed and changed his garments and  drunk his fill, and is now revelling, a garland of flowers on his head. He  frightens the_ SERVANT _a little from time to time during the  following speech._]    HERACLES.  Friend, why so solemn and so cranky-eyed?  'Tis not a henchman's office, to show pride  To his betters. He should smile and make good cheer.    There comes a guest, thy lord's old comrade, here;  And thou art all knitted eyebrows, scowls and head  Bent, because somebody, forsooth, is dead!    Come close! I mean to make thee wiser.    [_The_ SERVANT _reluctantly comes close._]                                              So.  Dost comprehend things mortal, how they grow?...  (_To himself_) I suppose not. How could he?...                                  Look this way!  Death is a debt all mortal men must pay;  Aye, there is no man living who can say  If life will last him yet a single day.  On, to the dark, drives Fortune; and no force  Can wrest her secret nor put back her course....    I have told thee now. I have taught thee. After this  Eat, drink, make thyself merry. Count the bliss  Of the one passing hour thine own; the rest  Is Fortune's. And give honour chiefliest  To our lady Cypris, giver of all joys  To man. 'Tis a sweet goddess. Otherwise,  Let all these questions sleep and just obey  My counsel.... Thou believest all I say?  I hope so.... Let this stupid grieving be;  Rise up above thy troubles, and with me  Drink in a cloud of blossoms. By my soul,  I vow the sweet plash-music of the bowl  Will break thy glumness, loose thee from the frown  Within. Let mortal man keep to his own  Mortality, and not expect too much.    To all your solemn dogs and other such  Scowlers--I tell thee truth, no more nor less--  Life is not life, but just unhappiness.    [_He offers the wine-bowl to the_ SERVANT, _who avoids it_.]    SERVANT.  We know all this. But now our fortunes be  Not such as ask for mirth or revelry.    HERACLES.  A woman dead, of no one's kin; why grieve  So much? Thy master and thy mistress live.    SERVANT.  Live? Man, hast thou heard nothing of our woe?    HERACLES.  Yes, thy lord told me all I need to know.    SERVANT.  He is too kind to his guests, more kind than wise.    HERACLES.  Must I go starved because some stranger dies?    SERVANT.  Some stranger?--Yes, a stranger verily!    HERACLES (_his manner beginning to change_).  Is this some real grief he hath hid from me?    SERVANT.  Go, drink, man! Leave to us our master's woes.    HERACLES.  It sounds not like a stranger. Yet, God knows...    SERVANT.  How should thy revelling hurt, if that were all?    HERACLES.  Hath mine own friend so wronged me in his hall?    SERVANT.  Thou camest at an hour when none was free  To accept thee. We were mourning. Thou canst see  Our hair, black robes...    HERACLES (_suddenly, in a voice of thunder_).                           Who is it that is dead?    SERVANT.  Alcestis, the King's wife.    HERACLES (_overcome_).                              What hast thou said?  Alcestis?... And ye feasted me withal!    SERVANT.  He held it shame to turn thee from his hall.    HERACLES.  Shame! And when such a wondrous wife was gone!    SERVANT (_breaking into tears_).  Oh, all is gone, all lost, not she alone!    HERACLES.  I knew, I felt it, when I saw his tears,  And face, and shorn hair. But he won mine ears  With talk of the strange woman and her rite  Of burial. So in mine own heart's despite  I crossed his threshold and sat drinking--he  And I old friends!--in his calamity.  Drank, and sang songs, and revelled, my head hot  With wine and flowers!... And thou to tell me not,  When all the house lay filled with sorrow, thou!  (_A pause; then suddenly_)  Where lies the tomb?--Where shall I find her now?    SERVANT (_frightened_).  Close by the straight Larissa road. The tall  White marble showeth from the castle wall.    HERACLES.  O heart, O hand, great doings have ye done  Of old: up now, and show them what a son  Took life that hour, when she of Tiryns' sod,  Electryon's daughter, mingled with her God!    I needs must save this woman from the shore  Of death and set her in her house once more,  Repaying Admetus' love.... This Death, this black  And winged Lord of corpses, I will track  Home. I shall surely find him by the grave  A-hungered, lapping the hot blood they gave  In sacrifice. An ambush: then, one spring,  One grip! These arms shall be a brazen ring,  With no escape, no rest, howe'er he whine  And curse his mauled ribs, till the Queen is mine!    Or if he escape me, if he come not there  To seek the blood of offering, I will fare  Down to the Houses without Light, and bring  To Her we name not and her nameless King  Strong prayers, until they yield to me and send  Alcestis home, to life and to my friend:  Who gave me shelter, drove me not away  In his great grief, but hid his evil day  Like a brave man, because he loved me well.  Is one in all this land more hospitable,  One in all Greece? I swear no man shall say  He hath cast his love upon a churl away!    [_He goes forth, just as he is, in the direction of the grave.  The_ SERVANT _watches a moment and goes back into the hall._]    [_The stage is empty; then_ ADMETUS _and the_ CHORUS  _return._]    ADMETUS.      Alas!  Bitter the homeward way,    Bitter to seek      A widowed house; ah me,    Where should I fly or stay,      Be dumb or speak?        Would I could cease to be!                Despair, despair!  My mother bore me under an evil star.    I envy them that are perished; my heart is there.  It dwells in the Sunless Houses, afar, afar.    I take no joy in looking upon the light;    No joy in the feel of the earth beneath my tread.  The Slayer hath taken his hostage; the Lord of the Dead    Holdeth me sworn to taste no more delight.    [_He throws himself on the ground in despair._]    CHORUS.  [_Each member of the_ CHORUS _speaks his line severally, as he  passes_ ADMETUS, _who is heard sobbing at the end of each line._]      --Advance, advance;        Till the house shall give thee cover.    --Thou hast borne heavy things        And meet for lamentation.    --Thou hast passed, hast passed,        Thro' the deepest of the River.    --Yet no help comes        To the sad and silent nation.    --And the face of thy beloved, it shall meet thee never, never!    ADMETUS.  Ye wrench my wounds asunder. Where    Is grief like mine, whose wife is dead?    My wife, whom would I ne'er had wed,  Nor loved, nor held my house with her....    Blessed are they who dare to dwell    Unloved of woman! 'Tis but one    Heart that they bleed with, and alone  Can bear their one life's burden well.    No young shall wither at their side,    No bridal room be swept by death....    Aye, better man should draw his breath  For ever without child or bride.    CHORUS (_as before_).    --'Tis Fate, 'tis Fate:        She is strong and none shall break her.    --No end, no end,        Wilt thou lay to lamentations?    --Endure and be still:        Thy lamenting will not wake her.    --There be many before thee,        Who have suffered and had patience.    --Though the face of Sorrow changeth, yet her hand is on all nations.    ADMETUS.  The garb of tears, the mourner's cry:    Then the long ache when tears are past!...    Oh, why didst hinder me to cast  This body to the dust and die  With her, the faithful and the brave?    Then not one lonely soul had fled,    But two great lovers, proudly dead,  Through the deep waters of the grave.    LEADER.  A friend I knew,    In whose house died a son,  Worthy of bitter rue,    His only one.  His head sank, yet he bare  Stilly his weight of care,  Though grey was in his hair    And life nigh done.    ADMETUS.  Ye shapes that front me, wall and gate,    How shall I enter in and dwell    Among ye, with all Fortune's spell  Dischanted? Aye, the change is great.    That day I strode with bridal song    Through lifted brands of Pelian pine;    A hand beloved lay in mine;  And loud behind a revelling throng    Exalted me and her, the dead.    They called us young, high-hearted; told    How princes were our sires of old,  And how we loved and we must wed....    For those high songs, lo, men that moan,    And raiment black where once was white;    Who guide me homeward in the night,  On that waste bed to lie alone.    SECOND ELDER.  It breaks, like strife,    Thy long peace, where no pain  Had entered; yet is life,    Sweet life, not slain.  A wife dead; a dear chair  Empty: is that so rare?  Men live without despair    Whose loves are ta'en.    ADMETUS (_erect and facing them_).  Behold, I count my wife's fate happier,  Though all gainsay me, than mine own. To her  Comes no more pain for ever; she hath rest  And peace from all toil, and her name is blest.  But I am one who hath no right to stay  Alive on earth; one that hath lost his way  In fate, and strays in dreams of life long past....  Friends, I have learned my lesson at the last.    I have my life. Here stands my house. But now  How dare I enter in? Or, entered, how  Go forth again? Go forth, when none is there  To give me a parting word, and I to her?...    Where shall I turn for refuge? There within,  The desert that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10542"],[0,"The Boats of the \"Glen Carrig\" (#7)"],[1,"was all blown up into vast clouds of dust-like  froth, and I knew that the storm was upon us. Immediately afterwards a  cold blast struck us; but we suffered no harm, for the bo'sun had gotten  the boat bows-on by this. The wind passed us, and there was an instant of  calm. And now all the air above us was full of a continuous roaring, so  very loud and intense that I was like to be deafened. To windward, I  perceived an enormous wall of spray bearing down upon us, and I heard  again the shrill screaming, pierce through the roaring. Then, the bo'sun  whipped in his oar under the cover, and, reaching forward, drew the  canvas aft, so that it covered the entire boat, and he held it down  against the gunnel upon the starboard side, shouting in my ear to do  likewise upon the larboard. Now had it not been for this forethought on  the part of the bo'sun we had been all dead men; and this may be the  better believed when I explain that we felt the water falling upon the  stout canvas overhead, tons and tons, though so beaten to froth as to  lack solidity to sink or crush us. I have said \"felt\"; for I would make  it so clear as may be, here once and for all, that so intense was the  roaring and screaming of the elements, there could no sound have  penetrated to us, no! not the pealing of mighty thunders. And so for the  space of maybe a full minute the boat quivered and shook most vilely, so  that she seemed like to have been shaken in pieces, and from a dozen  places between the gunnel and the covering canvas, the water spurted in  upon us. And here one other thing I would make mention of: During that  minute, the boat had ceased to rise and fall upon the great swell, and  whether this was because the sea was flattened by the first rush of the  wind, or that the excess of the storm held her steady, I am unable to  tell; and can put down only that which we felt.    Now, in a little, the first fury of the blast being spent, the boat  began to sway from side to side, as though the wind blew now upon the one  beam, and now upon the other; and several times we were stricken heavily  with the blows of solid water. But presently this ceased, and we returned  once again to the rise and fall of the swell, only that now we received a  cruel jerk every time that the boat came upon the top of a sea. And so a  while passed.    Towards midnight, as I should judge, there came some mighty flames of  lightning, so bright that they lit up the boat through the double  covering of canvas; yet no man of us heard aught of the thunder; for the  roaring of the storm made all else a silence.    And so to the dawn, after which, finding that we were still, by the mercy  of God, possessed of our lives, we made shift to eat and drink; after  which we slept.    Now, being extremely wearied by the stress of the past night, I slumbered  through many hours of the storm, waking at some time between noon and  evening. Overhead, as I lay looking upwards, the canvas showed of a dull  leadenish color, blackened completely at whiles by the dash of spray and  water. And so, presently, having eaten again, and feeling that all things  lay in the hands of the Almighty, I came once more upon sleep.    Twice through the following night was I wakened by the boat being hurled  upon her beam-ends by the blows of the seas; but she righted easily, and  took scarce any water, the canvas proving a very roof of safety. And so  the morning came again.    Being now rested, I crawled after to where the bo'sun lay, and, the noise  of the storm lulling odd instants, shouted in his ear to know whether the  wind was easing at whiles. To this he nodded, whereat I felt a most  joyful sense of hope pulse through me, and ate such food as could be  gotten, with a very good relish.    In the afternoon, the sun broke out suddenly, lighting up the boat most  gloomily through the wet canvas; yet a very welcome light it was, and  bred in us a hope that the storm was near to breaking. In a little, the  sun disappeared; but, presently, it coming again, the bo'sun beckoned to  me to assist him, and we removed such temporary nails as we had used to  fasten down the after part of the canvas, and pushed back the covering a  space sufficient to allow our heads to go through into the daylight. On  looking out, I discovered the air to be full of spray, beaten as fine as  dust, and then, before I could note aught else, a little gout of water  took me in the face with such force as to deprive me of breath; so that I  had to descend beneath the canvas for a little while.    So soon as I was recovered, I thrust forth my head again, and now I had  some sight of the terrors around us. As each huge sea came towards us,  the boat shot up to meet it, right up to its very crest, and there, for  the space of some instants, we would seem to be swamped in a very ocean  of foam, boiling up on each side of the boat to the height of many feet.  Then, the sea passing from under us, we would go swooping dizzily down  the great, black, froth-splotched back of the wave, until the oncoming  sea caught us up most mightily. Odd whiles, the crest of a sea would hurl  forward before we had reached the top, and though the boat shot upward  like a veritable feather, yet the water would swirl right over us, and we  would have to draw in our heads most suddenly; in such cases the wind  flapping the cover down so soon as our hands were removed. And, apart  from the way in which the boat met the seas, there was a very sense of  terror in the air; the continuous roaring and howling of the storm; the  _screaming_ of the foam, as the frothy summits of the briny mountains  hurled past us, and the wind that tore the breath out of our weak human  throats, are things scarce to be conceived.    Presently, we drew in our heads, the sun having vanished again, and  nailed down the canvas once more, and so prepared for the night.    From here on until the morning, I have very little knowledge of any  happenings; for I slept much of the time, and, for the rest, there was  little to know, cooped up beneath the cover. Nothing save the  interminable, thundering swoop of the boat downwards, and then the halt  and upward hurl, and the occasional plunges and surges to larboard or  starboard, occasioned, I can only suppose, by the indiscriminate might  of the seas.    I would make mention here, how that I had little thought all this while  for the peril of the other boat, and, indeed, I was so very full of our  own that it is no matter at which to wonder. However, as it proved, and  as this is a most suitable place in which to tell it, the boat that held  Josh and the rest of the crew came through the storm with safety; though  it was not until many years afterwards that I had the good fortune to  hear from Josh himself how that, after the storm, they were picked up by  a homeward-bound vessel, and landed in the Port of London.    And now, to our own happenings.          VI    The Weed-Choked Sea      It was some little while before midday that we grew conscious that the  sea had become very much less violent; and this despite the wind roaring  with scarce abated noise. And, presently, everything about the boat,  saving the wind, having grown indubitably calmer, and no great water  breaking over the canvas, the bo'sun beckoned me again to assist him lift  the after part of the cover. This we did, and put forth our heads to  inquire the reason of the unexpected quietness of the sea; not knowing  but that we had come suddenly under the lee of some unknown land. Yet,  for a space, we could see nothing, beyond the surrounding billows; for  the sea was still very furious, though no matter to cause us concern,  after that through which we had come.    Presently, however, the bo'sun, raising himself, saw something, and,  bending cried in my ear that there was a low bank which broke the force  of the sea; but he was full of wonder to know how that we had passed it  without shipwreck. And whilst he was still pondering the matter I raised  myself, and took a look on all sides of us, and so I discovered that  there lay another great bank upon our larboard side, and this I pointed  out to him. Immediately afterwards, we came upon a great mass of seaweed  swung up on the crest of a sea, and, presently, another. And so we  drifted on, and the seas grew less with astonishing rapidity, so that, in  a little, we stripped off the cover so far as the midship thwart; for the  rest of the men were sorely in need of the fresh air, after so long a  time below the canvas covering.    It was after we had eaten, that one of them made out that there was  another low bank astern upon which we were drifting. At that, the bo'sun  stood up and made an examination of it, being much exercised in his mind  to know how we might come clear of it with safety. Presently, however, we  had come so near to it that we discovered it to be composed of seaweed,  and so we let the boat drive upon it, making no doubt but that the other  banks, which we had seen, were of a similar nature.    In a little, we had driven in among the weed; yet, though our speed was  greatly slowed, we made some progress, and so in time came out upon the  other side, and now we found the sea to be near quiet, so that we hauled  in our sea anchor--which had collected a great mass of weed about it--and  removed the whaleback and canvas coverings, after which we stepped the  mast, and set a tiny storm-foresail upon the boat; for we wished to have  her under control, and could set no more than this, because of the  violence of the breeze.    Thus we drove on before the wind, the bo'sun steering, and avoiding all  such banks as showed ahead, and ever the sea grew calmer. Then, when it  was near on to evening, we discovered a huge stretch of the weed that  seemed to block all the sea ahead, and, at that, we hauled down the  foresail, and took to our oars, and began to pull, broadside on to it,  towards the West.
