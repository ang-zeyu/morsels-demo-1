Yet  witness the motly products of evolution: Man, ape, elephant, skunk,  scorpion, lizard, lark, toad, lobster, louse, flea, amoeba, hookworm,  and countless microscopic animals; also, the palm, lily, melon, maize,  mushroom, thistle, cactus, microscopic bacilli, etc. All developed  from one germ, all in some way related. Mark well the difference in  size between the elephant, louse, and microscopic hookworm, and the  difference in intellect between man and the lobster!    While all had the same start, only one species out of 3,000,000  reached the physical and intellectual and moral status of man. Why  only one? Why do we not find beings equal or similar to man, developed  from the cunning fox, the faithful dog, the innocent sheep, or the  hog, one of the most social of all animals? Or still more from the  many species of the talented monkey family?  Out of 3,000,000 chances,  is it not likely that more than one species would attain the status of  man?    \"Romanes, a disciple of Darwin, after collecting the manifestations of  intelligent reasoning from every known species of the lower animals,  found that they only equaled altogether the intelligence of a child 15  months old.\" Then man has easily 10,000,000 times as much power to  reason as the animals, and easily 10,000,000,000 times as much  conscience. Why have not many species filled the great gap between man  and the brute? Out of 3,000,000 births, would we expect but one male?  Or one female? Out of 3,000,000 deaths, would we expect all to be  males but one?  To be sure, all the skeletons and bones found by  evolutionists belong to males except one. Strange! If 3,000,000  pennies were tossed into the air, would we expect them all to fall  with heads up, save one? The Revolutionary war, out of 3,000,000  people, developed one great military chieftain, but many more  approximating his ability; one or more great statesmen with all  gradations down to the mediocre; scholars and writers, with others  little inferior; but there was no overtowering genius 10,000,000 or  10,000,000,000 times as great as any other. We would be astonished  beyond measure, if any great genius should rise in any nation as far  ahead of all others, as the species of mankind is ahead of all other  species. It is unthinkable that one species and only one reached the  measureless distance between the monkey and man. It violates  mathematical probability.    We have a right to expect, in many species and in large numbers, all  gradations of animals between the monkey and man in size, intellect,  and spirituality. Where are the anthropoids and their descendants  alleged to have lived during the 2,000,000 years of man's evolution?  They can not be found living or dead. They never existed. Creation  alone explains the great gap. What signs have we that other species  will ever approximate, equal or surpass man in attainments? Can we  hope that, in the far distant future, a baboon will write an epic  equal to Milton's Paradise Lost, or a bull-frog compose an oratorio  surpassing Handel's Messiah?    We find all gradations of species in size from the largest to the  smallest. Why not the same gradation in _intelligence, conscience  and spirituality_? The difference in brain, capacity and  intelligence between man and the ape is 50% greater than the  difference in size between the elephant and the housefly. There are  many thousands of species to fill the gap in size. Why not many  thousands to fill the greater gap in intelligence? Evidently no  species became human by growth. Many species like the amoeba, and the  microscopic disease germs, have not developed at all but are the same  as ever. Many other species of the lower forms of life have remained  unchanged during the ages.  If the tendency is to develop into the  higher forms of life, why do we have so many of those lower forms  which have remained stationary? Growth, development, evolution, is  not, by any means, a universal rule.    Evolution is not universally true in any sense of the term. Why are  not fishes _now_ changing into amphibians, amphibians into  reptiles, reptiles into birds and mammals, and monkeys into man? If  growth, development, evolution, were the rule, there would be no lower  order of animals for all have had sufficient time to develop into the  highest orders. Many have remained the same; some have deteriorated.    And now we have a new amendment to the theory of evolution: We are  told that the huge Saurians (reptiles) overworked the development  idea, and became too large and cumbersome, and hence are now  extinct. Prof. Cope says:--\"Retrogression in nature is as well  established as evolution.\" It seems that man also has, contrary to all  former conceptions, reached the limit of his development, if he has  not already gone too far.    Prof. R. S. Lull says, (Readings p. 95) \"Man's physical evolution has  virtually ceased, but in so far as any change is being effected, it is  largely retrogressive. Such changes are: Reduction of hair and teeth,  and of hand skill; and dulling of the senses of sight, smell and  hearing upon which active creatures depend so largely for safety.  That sort of charity which fosters the physically, mentally and  morally feeble, and is thus contrary to the law of natural selection,  must also, in the long run, have an adverse effect upon the race.\" Too  bad that Christian charity takes care of the feeble, endangering  evolution, and the doctrine that the weak have no rights that the  strong are bound to respect! We are not surprised that Nietzsche,  whose insane philosophy that _might is right_, helped to bring on  the world war, died in an insane asylum.    After all, evolution is not progress and development, but  retrogression and deterioration as well.    But evolutionists, compelled by the requirements of their theory, have  added another amendment, which will seem ridiculous to some:    Environment has had an evolution as well as plants and animals! Having  denied the existence of God, or his active control and interference,  they must account for environment by evolution. Listen:--\"Henderson  points out that environment, no less than organisms, has had an  evolution. Water, for example, has a dozen unique properties that  condition life. Carbon dioxide is absolutely necessary to life. The  properties of the ocean are so beautifully adjusted to life that we  marvel at the exactness of its fitness. [Yet no design!]. Finally, the  chemical properties of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are equally unique  and unreplaceable. The evolution of environment and the evolution of  organisms have gone hand in hand.\" And all by blind chance! Is it not  a thousand times better to believe that all things were created by an  all-wise and all powerful God? How could a lifeless environment come  by evolution? If we would listen to them, we would be told that the  ocean, the atmosphere, heat, light, electricity, all the elements, the  starry heavens, and all the universe, and religion itself, came by  evolution, some grudgingly granting that God _may_ have created  matter in the beginning.    It is unreasonable to believe that one species and only one out of  3,000,000 by evolution should attain the status of mankind; and that  one species and only one species of the primates should reach the  heights of intelligence, reason, conscience and spirituality. Huxley  says, \"There is an enormous gulf, a divergence practically infinite,  between the lowest man and the highest beast.\"    To declare that our species alone crossed this measureless gulf, while  our nearest relatives have not even made a fair start, is an affront  to the intelligence of the thoughtful student. It does fierce violence  to the doctrine of mathematical probability. It could not have  happened.        10. THE AGE OF THE EARTH      The estimates of the age of the world vary from 16,000,000 years to  100 times this number or 1,600,000,000 years. Even H.G. Wells admits  these estimates \"rest nearly always upon theoretical assumptions of  the slenderest kind.\" This is undoubtedly true of the reckless  estimates of evolutionists, whose theory requires such an enormous  length of time that science can not concede it.  Prof. H.H. Newman  says, \"The last decade has seen the demise (?) of the outworn (?)  objection to evolution, based on the idea that there has not been time  enough for the great changes that are believed by evolutionists to  have occurred. Given 100,000,000 or 1,000,000,000 years since life  began we can then allow 1,000,000 years for each important change to  arise and establish itself.\"    An objection is not \"outworn\" until answered, and to speak of the  demise of a generally accepted theory is hardly scientific. We will  not allow the evolutionist to dismiss so weighty an objection with a  wave of the hand.  Prof. Newman, in his \"Readings in Evolution,\"  p. 68, gives 60,000,000 years as the probable time since life began.  The writer, having based arguments upon that assumption, was surprised  to receive a private letter from him claiming that life has existed  for 500,000,000 years.  Indeed Prof. Russell, of Princeton, says, in  his \"Rice Lectures,\" that the earth is probably 4,000,000,000 years  old, possibly 8,000,000,000! We can do nothing but gasp, while the  bewildering guesses come in, and we wait for the next estimate. We  note their utter abandon, as they make a raid on God's eternity to  support a theory that would dethrone Him.    But these extravagantly long periods required by the theory, science  cannot grant, for the following reasons:--      1. According to the nebular hypothesis, and Helmholtz's contraction  theory, accounting for the regular supply of heat from the sun, the  sun itself is not likely more than 20,000,000 years old, and, of  course, the earth is much younger. Both of these theories are quite  generally accepted by scientists, and have much to support them."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/852"],[0,"Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education (#6)"],[1,"is in a country like our own a variety  of races, religious affiliations, economic divisions. Inside the modern  city, in spite of its nominal political unity, there are probably more  communities, more differing customs, traditions, aspirations, and forms  of government or control, than existed in an entire continent at an  earlier epoch.    Each such group exercises a formative influence on the active  dispositions of its members. A clique, a club, a gang, a Fagin's  household of thieves, the prisoners in a jail, provide educative  environments for those who enter into their collective or conjoint  activities, as truly as a church, a labor union, a business partnership,  or a political party. Each of them is a mode of associated or community  life, quite as much as is a family, a town, or a state. There are also  communities whose members have little or no direct contact with one  another, like the guild of artists, the republic of letters, the members  of the professional learned class scattered over the face of the  earth. For they have aims in common, and the activity of each member is  directly modified by knowledge of what others are doing.    In the olden times, the diversity of groups was largely a geographical  matter. There were many societies, but each, within its own territory,  was comparatively homogeneous. But with the development of commerce,  transportation, intercommunication, and emigration, countries like the  United States are composed of a combination of different groups with  different traditional customs. It is this situation which has, perhaps  more than any other one cause, forced the demand for an educational  institution which shall provide something like a homogeneous and  balanced environment for the young. Only in this way can the centrifugal  forces set up by juxtaposition of different groups within one and the  same political unit be counteracted. The intermingling in the school  of youth of different races, differing religions, and unlike customs  creates for all a new and broader environment. Common subject matter  accustoms all to a unity of outlook upon a broader horizon than  is visible to the members of any group while it is isolated. The  assimilative force of the American public school is eloquent testimony  to the efficacy of the common and balanced appeal.    The school has the function also of coordinating within the disposition  of each individual the diverse influences of the various social  environments into which he enters. One code prevails in the family;  another, on the street; a third, in the workshop or store; a fourth,  in the religious association. As a person passes from one of the  environments to another, he is subjected to antagonistic pulls, and  is in danger of being split into a being having different standards of  judgment and emotion for different occasions. This danger imposes upon  the school a steadying and integrating office.      Summary. The development within the young of the attitudes and  dispositions necessary to the continuous and progressive life of a  society cannot take place by direct conveyance of beliefs, emotions, and  knowledge. It takes place through the intermediary of the environment.  The environment consists of the sum total of conditions which are  concerned in the execution of the activity characteristic of a living  being. The social environment consists of all the activities of fellow  beings that are bound up in the carrying on of the activities of any  one of its members. It is truly educative in its effect in the degree in  which an individual shares or participates in some conjoint activity. By  doing his share in the associated activity, the individual appropriates  the purpose which actuates it, becomes familiar with its methods and  subject matters, acquires needed skill, and is saturated with its  emotional spirit.    The deeper and more intimate educative formation of disposition  comes, without conscious intent, as the young gradually partake of the  activities of the various groups to which they may belong. As a society  becomes more complex, however, it is found necessary to provide a  special social environment which shall especially look after nurturing  the capacities of the immature. Three of the more important functions  of this special environment are: simplifying and ordering the factors  of the disposition it is wished to develop; purifying and idealizing  the existing social customs; creating a wider and better balanced  environment than that by which the young would be likely, if left to  themselves, to be influenced.          Chapter Three: Education as Direction    1. The Environment as Directive.    We now pass to one of the special forms which the general function of  education assumes: namely, that of direction, control, or guidance.  Of these three words, direction, control, and guidance, the last best  conveys the idea of assisting through cooperation the natural capacities  of the individuals guided; control conveys rather the notion of an  energy brought to bear from without and meeting some resistance from the  one controlled; direction is a more neutral term and suggests the  fact that the active tendencies of those directed are led in a certain  continuous course, instead of dispersing aimlessly. Direction expresses  the basic function, which tends at one extreme to become a guiding  assistance and at another, a regulation or ruling. But in any case, we  must carefully avoid a meaning sometimes read into the term \"control.\"  It is sometimes assumed, explicitly or unconsciously, that an  individual's tendencies are naturally purely individualistic or  egoistic, and thus antisocial. Control then denotes the process by which  he is brought to subordinate his natural impulses to public or common  ends. Since, by conception, his own nature is quite alien to this  process and opposes it rather than helps it, control has in this view  a flavor of coercion or compulsion about it. Systems of government  and theories of the state have been built upon this notion, and it has  seriously affected educational ideas and practices. But there is no  ground for any such view. Individuals are certainly interested, at  times, in having their own way, and their own way may go contrary to  the ways of others. But they are also interested, and chiefly interested  upon the whole, in entering into the activities of others and taking  part in conjoint and cooperative doings. Otherwise, no such thing as  a community would be possible. And there would not even be any one  interested in furnishing the policeman to keep a semblance of harmony  unless he thought that thereby he could gain some personal advantage.  Control, in truth, means only an emphatic form of direction of powers,  and covers the regulation gained by an individual through his own  efforts quite as much as that brought about when others take the lead.    In general, every stimulus directs activity. It does not simply excite  it or stir it up, but directs it toward an object. Put the other way  around, a response is not just a re-action, a protest, as it were,  against being disturbed; it is, as the word indicates, an answer. It  meets the stimulus, and corresponds with it. There is an adaptation of  the stimulus and response to each other. A light is the stimulus to the  eye to see something, and the business of the eye is to see. If the  eyes are open and there is light, seeing occurs; the stimulus is but a  condition of the fulfillment of the proper function of the organ, not an  outside interruption. To some extent, then, all direction or control is  a guiding of activity to its own end; it is an assistance in doing fully  what some organ is already tending to do.    This general statement needs, however, to be qualified in two respects.  In the first place, except in the case of a small number of instincts,  the stimuli to which an immature human being is subject are not  sufficiently definite to call out, in the beginning, specific responses.  There is always a great deal of superfluous energy aroused. This energy  may be wasted, going aside from the point; it may also go against the  successful performance of an act. It does harm by getting in the way.  Compare the behavior of a beginner in riding a bicycle with that of the  expert. There is little axis of direction in the energies put forth;  they are largely dispersive and centrifugal. Direction involves  a focusing and fixating of action in order that it may be truly a  response, and this requires an elimination of unnecessary and confusing  movements. In the second place, although no activity can be produced in  which the person does not cooperate to some extent, yet a response may  be of a kind which does not fit into the sequence and continuity of  action. A person boxing may dodge a particular blow successfully, but in  such a way as to expose himself the next instant to a still harder  blow. Adequate control means that the successive acts are brought into  a continuous order; each act not only meets its immediate stimulus but  helps the acts which follow.    In short, direction is both simultaneous and successive. At a given  time, it requires that, from all the tendencies that are partially  called out, those be selected which center energy upon the point of  need. Successively, it requires that each act be balanced with those  which precede and come after, so that order of activity is achieved.  Focusing and ordering are thus the two aspects of direction, one  spatial, the other temporal. The first insures hitting the mark; the  second keeps the balance required for further action. Obviously, it is  not possible to separate them in practice as we have distinguished them  in idea. Activity must be centered at a given time in such a way as to  prepare for what comes next. The problem of the immediate response is  complicated by one's having to be on the lookout for future"]]]
