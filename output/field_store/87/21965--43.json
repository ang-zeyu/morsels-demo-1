[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11242"],[0,"The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti (#7)"],[1,",  being a friend of Michelangelo, confided to him a vision which pursued  him, to the following effect. Lorenzo de' Medici appeared to him  barely clad in one black tattered robe, and bade him relate to his son  Piero that he would soon be expelled and never more return to his  home. Now Piero was arrogant and overbearing to such an extent that  neither the good-nature of the Cardinal Giovanni, his brother, nor the  courtesy and urbanity of Giuliano, was so strong to maintain him in  Florence as his own faults to cause his expulsion. Michelangelo  encouraged the man to obey Lorenzo and report the matter to his son;  but Cardiere, fearing his new master's temper, kept it to himself. On  another morning, when Michelangelo was in the courtyard of the palace,  Cardiere came with terror and pain written on his countenance. Last  night Lorenzo had again appeared to him in the same garb of woe; and  while he was awake and gazing with his eyes, the spectre dealt him a  blow on the cheek, to punish him for omitting to report his vision to  Piero. Michelangelo immediately gave him such a thorough scolding that  Cardiere plucked up courage, and set forth on foot for Careggi, a  Medicean villa some three miles distant from the city. He had traveled  about halfway, when he met Piero, who was riding home; so he stopped  the cavalcade, and related all that he had seen and heard. Piero  laughed him to scorn, and, beckoning the running footmen, bade them  mock the poor fellow. His Chancellor, who was afterwards the Cardinal  of Bibbiena, cried out: 'You are a madman! Which do you think Lorenzo  loved best, his son or you? If his son, would he not rather have  appeared to him than to some one else?' Having thus jeered him, they  let him go; and he, when he returned home and complained to  Michelangelo, so convinced the latter of the truth of his vision that  Michelangelo after two days left Florence with a couple of comrades,  dreading that if what Cardiere had predicted should come true, he  would no longer be safe in Florence.\"    This ghost-story bears a remarkable resemblance to what Clarendon  relates concerning the apparition of Sir George Villiers. Wishing to  warn his son, the Duke of Buckingham, of his coming murder at the hand  of Lieutenant Felton, he did not appear to the Duke himself, but to an  old man-servant of the family; upon which behaviour of Sir George's  ghost the same criticism has been passed as on that of Lorenzo de'  Medici.    Michelangelo and his two friends travelled across the Apennines to  Bologna, and thence to Venice, where they stopped a few days. Want of  money, or perhaps of work there drove them back upon the road to  Florence. When they reached Bologna on the return journey, a curious  accident happened to the party. The master of the city, Giovanni  Bentivoglio, had recently decreed that every foreigner, on entering  the gates, should be marked with a seal of red wax upon his thumb. The  three Florentines omitted to obey this regulation, and were taken to  the office of the Customs, where they were fined fifty Bolognese  pounds. Michelangelo did not possess enough to pay this fine; but it  so happened that a Bolognese nobleman called Gianfrancesco Aldovrandi  was there, who, hearing that Buonarroti was a sculptor, caused the men  to be released. Upon his urgent invitation, Michelangelo went to this  gentleman's house, after taking leave of his two friends and giving  them all the money in his pocket. With Messer Aldovrandi he remained  more than a year, much honoured by his new patron, who took great  delight in his genius; \"and every evening he made Michelangelo read  aloud to him out of Dante or Petrarch, and sometimes Boccaccio, until  he went to sleep.\" He also worked upon the tomb of San Domenico during  this first residence at Bologna. Originally designed and carried  forward by Niccolo Pisano, this elaborate specimen of mediaeval  sculpture remained in some points imperfect. There was a San Petronio  whose drapery, begun by Niccolo da Bari, was unfinished. To this  statue Michelangelo put the last touches; and he also carved a  kneeling angel with a candelabrum, the workmanship of which surpasses  in delicacy of execution all the other figures on the tomb.      III    Michelangelo left Bologna hastily. It is said that a sculptor who had  expected to be employed upon the _arca_ of S. Domenic threatened to do  him some mischief if he stayed and took the bread out of the mouths of  native craftsmen. He returned to Florence some time in 1495. The city  was now quiet again, under the rule of Savonarola. Its burghers, in  obedience to the friar's preaching, began to assume that air of  pietistic sobriety which contrasted strangely with the gay  licentiousness encouraged by their former master. Though the reigning  branch of the Medici remained in exile, their distant cousins, who  were descended from Lorenzo, the brother of Cosimo, Pater Patriae,  kept their place in the republic. They thought it prudent, however, at  this time, to exchange the hated name of de' Medici for Popolano. With  a member of this section of the Medicean family, Lorenzo di  Pierfrancesco, Michelangelo soon found himself on terms of intimacy.  It was for him that he made a statue of the young S. John, which was  perhaps rediscovered at Pisa in 1874. For a long time this S.  Giovannino was attributed to Donatello; and it certainly bears decided  marks of resemblance to that master's manner, in the choice of  attitude, the close adherence to the model, and the treatment of the  hands and feet. Still it has notable affinities to the style of  Michelangelo, especially in the youthful beauty of the features, the  disposition of the hair, and the sinuous lines which govern the whole  composition. It may also be remarked that those peculiarities in the  hands and feet which I have mentioned as reminding us of Donatello--a  remarkable length in both extremities, owing to the elongation of the  metacarpal and metatarsal bones and of the spaces dividing these from  the forearm and tibia--are precisely the points which Michelangelo  retained through life from his early study of Donatello's work. We  notice them particularly in the Dying Slave of the Louvre, which is  certainly one of his most characteristic works. Good judges are  therefore perhaps justified in identifying this S. Giovannino, which  is now in the Berlin Museum, with the statue made for Lorenzo di  Pierfrancesco de' Medici.    The next piece which occupied Michelangelo's chisel was a Sleeping  Cupid. His patron thought this so extremely beautiful that he remarked  to the sculptor: \"If you were to treat it artificially, so as to make  it look as though it had been dug up, I would send it to Rome; it  would be accepted as an antique, and you would be able to sell it at a  far higher price.\" Michelangelo took the hint. His Cupid went to Rome,  and was sold for thirty ducats to a dealer called Messer Baldassare  del Milanese, who resold it to Raffaello Riario, the Cardinal di S.  Giorgio, for the advanced sum of 200 ducats. It appears from this  transaction that Michelangelo did not attempt to impose upon the first  purchaser, but that this man passed it off upon the Cardinal as an  antique. When the Cardinal began to suspect that the Cupid was the  work of a modern Florentine, he sent one of his gentlemen to Florence  to inquire into the circumstances. The rest of the story shall be told  in Condivi's words.    \"This gentleman, pretending to be on the lookout for a sculptor  capable of executing certain works in Rome, after visiting several,  was addressed to Michelangelo. When he saw the young artist, he begged  him to show some proof of his ability; whereupon Michelangelo took a  pen (for at that time the crayon [_lapis_] had not come into use), and  drew a hand with such grace that the gentleman was stupefied.  Afterwards, he asked if he had ever worked in marble, and when  Michelangelo said yes, and mentioned among other things a Cupid of  such height and in such an attitude, the man knew that he had found  the right person. So he related how the matter had gone, and promised  Michelangelo, if he would come with him to Rome, to get the difference  of price made up, and to introduce him to his patron, feeling sure  that the latter would receive him very kindly. Michelangelo, then,  partly in anger at having been cheated, and partly moved by the  gentleman's account of Rome as the widest field for an artist to  display his talents, went with him, and lodged in his house, near the  palace of the Cardinal.\" S. Giorgio compelled Messer Baldassare to  refund the 200 ducats, and to take the Cupid back. But Michelangelo  got nothing beyond his original price; and both Condivi and Vasari  blame the Cardinal for having been a dull and unsympathetic patron to  the young artist of genius he had brought from Florence. Still the  whole transaction was of vast importance, because it launched him for  the first time upon Rome, where he was destined to spend the larger  part of his long life, and to serve a succession of Pontiffs in their  most ambitious undertakings.    Before passing to the events of his sojourn at Rome, I will wind up  the story of the Cupid. It passed first into the hands of Cesare  Borgia, who presented it to Guidobaldo di Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino.  On the 30th of June 1502, the Marchioness of Mantua wrote a letter to  the Cardinal of Este, saying that she should very much like to place  this piece, together with an antique statuette of Venus, both of which  had belonged to her brother-in-law, the Duke of Urbino, in her own  collection. Apparently they had just become the property of Cesare  Borgia, when he took and sacked the town of Urbino upon the 20th of  June in that year. Cesare Borgia seems to have complied immediately  with her wishes; for in a second letter, dated July 22, 1502, she  described the Cupid as \"without a peer among the works"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11246"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 14, No. 394, (#7)"],[1,"feudal tyrant, and to have represented all the pride and insolence for  which the then beggarly-princes of Germany were remarkable), he was so  ill paid, that notwithstanding his utmost exertions as an instructor, it  was with difficulty he supported a wife and family. Anna Maria,[3] born  August 29, 1751, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, born January 27, 1756,  were the only two of seven children who survived. The sister made such  progress on the harpsichord, that in the first journeys which the father  took in order to display the talents of his children, she divided the  public attention with her brother. Wolfgang, however, not only profited  as a player, from the careful instruction which both the children  received from their parent, but began then to exhibit the extraordinary  precocity of his musical mind; the minuets and other little movements  which he composed from the age of four to seven show a consistency of  thought and a symmetry of design which promised a maturity of the  highest genius. Of the first expedition of Leopold Mozart with his son  and daughter, in January, 1762, little account is preserved, further  than that they visited Munich, and played concertos on the harpsichord  before the royal family. In the following autumn, (Wolfgang being then  in his seventh year), the father proceeded in the same company to  Vienna; the journey was made by water, and the family gave concerts at  the principal towns they passed, as occasion served. Leopold Mozart  writes, \"On Tuesday we arrived at Ips, where two Minorites and a  Benedictine who accompanied us said mass,[4] during which our little  Wolfgang _tumbled about_ upon the organ and played so well, that the  Franciscan fathers, who were just sitting down to dinner with some  guests, left the table, and ran with all their company into the choir,  where they were filled with wonder.\" A little before, he says, \"the  children are as merry as when they were at home. The boy is friendly  with every body, but particularly with military officers, as though he  had known them all his life. He is the admiration of all.\" At the Court  of Vienna the family was received with great favour, the Emperor Francis  I. being mightily pleased with \"the little magician,\" as he used  playfully to call young Mozart. \"There is nothing wonderful,\" said the  emperor one day, joking with him, \"in playing with all the fingers, but  to play with _one_ finger and with the keys covered, would really be  surprising.\" Upon which the child instantly performed in this manner  with as much neatness and certainty as if he had long practised it. The  father writes, \"you will scarcely believe me when I tell you how  graciously we have been received. The empress took Wolfgang on her lap,  and kissed him heartily.\"[5] It was at this time that Mozart began to  display the feeling of a great artist; just before he commenced a  concerto, seeing himself surrounded by people of the Court, he asked the  emperor--\"is not M. Wagenseil here? _he_ understands these things.\"  Wagenseil was called forward to the harpsichord; \"I am going to play one  of your concertos,\" said the boy, \"will you turn over for me?\"        [3] This lady is at present living in Salzburg, and in 1826 had      not entirely given up her occupation as an instructress in      piano-forte playing. Many pupils have been brought up under her,      who by a peculiar neatness and precision of performance, evince      the excellent tuition of Nanette Mozart.        [4] Probably at a convent.        [5] The following anecdote is recorded in the history of this      journey:--Little Mozart one day, on a visit to the empress, was      led into her presence by the two princesses, one of whom was      afterwards the unfortunate Queen of France, Marie Antoinette.      Being unaccustomed to the smoothness of the floor, his foot      slipped and he fell. One of the princesses took no notice of the      accident, but the other Marie Antoinette, lifted him up and      consoled him. Upon which he said to her, \"you are very good, I      will marry you.\" She related this to her mother, who asked      Wolfang how he came to make this resolution. He answered, \"from      gratitude--she was so kind to me--whereas her sister gave      herself no trouble.\"    As yet Mozart had only played on keyed instruments, but on his return to  Salzburg he practised privately on a little violin which he had  purchased in Vienna, and, to the surprise of his father and some friends  who had met to play over some new trios, he performed the second violin  part, and then the first, with correctness, though without method. His  horror of the sound of the trumpet in childhood, and the early passion  he displayed for arithmetic, are well known; to the last he was fond of  figures, and was extremely clever in making calculations; though very  improvident in his pecuniary affairs. The peculiar delicacy of Mozart's  organization is displayed in the fine sense of hearing which he evinced  at a tender age. Schachtner, a trumpeter, who used to visit his father,  had a violin that Wolfgang was fond of playing upon, which he used to  praise extremely for its soft tone, calling it the \"_butter fiddle_.\" On  one occasion, as the boy was amusing himself on his own little violin,  he said to Schachtner, \"if you have left your violin tuned as it was  when I last played upon it, it must be full half-a-quarter of a note  flatter than mine.\" Those present laughed at a nicety of distinction,  upon which the most critical ear could hardly pronounce; but the father,  who had many proofs of the extraordinary memory and exquisite feeling of  his son, sent for the instrument, and it was found to be as the boy had  said. Although he daily gave fresh instances of his extraordinary  endowments, he did not become proud or conceited, but was always an  amiable and tractable child. The affection and sweetness which  characterize his airs were inherent in his disposition, and the  following anecdote accounts for the prevalence of those delightful  qualities in his vein of melody:--\"Mozart loved his parents,  particularly his father, so tenderly, that every night before going to  bed he used to sing a little air that he had composed on purpose, his  father having placed him standing in a chair, and singing the second to  him. During the singing he often kissed his father _on the top of the  nose_, (the epicurism of childish fondness), and as soon as this  solemnity was over, he was laid in bed, perfectly contented and happy.\"    The young artist, in his eighth year, began to show a manly intellect.  It was in the third tour through Germany to Paris, London. &c. that the  fame of Mozart extended throughout Europe; but as many particulars of  this period of his life are already known, from the account published by  Daines Barrington in the Philosophical Transactions, the Letters of  Baron Grimm, and other sources, we shall only notice the newest and most  interesting incidents of this part of the Biography. From Wasserburg,  Leopold Mozart writes, \"We went up to the organ to amuse ourselves,  where I explained the pedals to Wolfgang. He began instantly to make an  attempt with them, pushed back the stool and preluded standing, treading  the bass to his harmonies as if he had practised for months.\" The  violin-playing of Nardini, whom the party heard at Ludwigsberg, is much  praised by Leopold Mozart for the neatness of the execution, and the  beauty and equality of the tone. At Frankfort, Wolfgang one morning on  waking began to cry. His father asked him the reason. He said he was so  sorry at not being able to see his friends Hagenaur, Wenzl, Spitzeder,  and Reibl. Though the children performed before all the persons of  distinction they met on their route, yet as they were often rewarded  with costly presents, swords, snuff-boxes, trinkets, &c. instead of  money, the father had much anxiety on this account. He says, in a letter  from Brussels, \"At Aix we saw the Princess Amelia, sister to the King of  Prussia, but she has no money. If the kisses which she gave my children,  especially to Master Wolfgang, had been louis d'ors, we might have  rejoiced.\" In Paris, little Mozart performed feats which would have done  honour to an experienced Kapellmeister, transposing at sight, into any  key whatever, any airs which were placed before him, writing the melody  to a bass, or the bass to a melody, with the utmost facility and without  premeditation. His deep acquaintance with harmony and modulation  surprised every one, and his organ-playing was particularly admired. A  very pleasant picture of the musical family was painted in Paris, of  which an engraving is given in the Biography. Mozart's sister relates,  that when they were at Versailles, Madame de Pompadour had her brother  placed upon a table, and that as he approached to salute her, she turned  away from him; upon which he said indignantly, \"I wonder who she is,  that she will not kiss me--the empress has kissed me!\" At Versailles the  whole court was present to hear the little boy of eight years play upon  the organ, and he was moreover treated by the royal family with great  distinction, particularly by the queen. When she dined in public, young  Mozart had the honour to stand near her, to converse with her  constantly, and now and then to receive some delicacy from her hand. The  father writes, \"the queen speaks as good German as we do. As, however,  the king understands nothing of it, the queen interprets all that our  _heroic_ Wolfgang says.\"    _(To be concluded in our next.)_           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER.
