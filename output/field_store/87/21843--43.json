[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7998"],[0,"The Frogs (#6)"],[1,"rt.      AESCH. Demeter, mistress, nourisher of my soul,    O make me worthy of thy mystic rites!      DIO. (_To Eur_.) Now put on incense, you.      EUR. Excuse me, no; My vows are paid to other gods than these.      DIO. What, a new coinage of your own?      EUR. Precisely.      DIO. Pray then to them, those private gods of yours.      EUR. Ether, my pasture, volubly-rolling tongue,    Intelligent wit and critic nostrils keen,    O well and neatly may I trounce his plays!        CHOR. We also are yearning from these to be learning      Some stately measure, some majestic grand      Movement telling of conflicts nigh.      Now for battle arrayed they stand,      Tongues embittered, and anger high.      Each has got a venturesome will,      Each an eager and nimble mind;      One will wield, with artistic skill,      Clearcut phrases, and wit refined;      Then the other, with words defiant,      Stern and strong, like an angry giant      Laying on with uprooted trees,      Soon will scatter a world of these      Superscholastic subtleties.      DIO. Now then, commence your arguments, and mind you both display    True wit, not metaphors, nor things which any fool could say.      EUR. As for myself, good people all, I'll tell you by-and-by    My own poetic worth and claims; but first of all I'll try    To show how this portentous quack beguiled the silly fools    Whose tastes were nurtured, ere he came, in Phrynichus's schools.    He'd bring some single mourner on, seated and veiled, 'twould be    Achilles, say, or Niobe--the face you could not         see--    An empty show of tragic woe, who uttered not one thing.      DIO. Tis true.      EUR. Then in the Chorus came, and rattled off a string    Of four continuous lyric odes: the mourner never stirred.      DIO. I liked it too. I sometimes think that I those mutes preferred    To all your chatterers now-a-days.      EUR. Because, if you must know,    You were an ass.      DIO. An ass, no doubt: what made him do it though?      EUR. That was his quackery, don't you see, to set the audience guessing    When Niobe would speak; meanwhile, the drama was progressing.      DIO. The rascal, how he took me in! 'Twas shameful, was it not?    (_To Aesch_.) What makes you stamp and fidget so?      EUR. He's catching it so hot.    So when he had humbugged thus awhile, and now his wretched play    Was halfway through, a dozen words, great wild-bull words, he'd say,    Fierce Bugaboos, with bristling crests, and shaggy eyebrows too,    Which not a soul could understand.      AESCH. O heavens!      DIO. Be quiet, do.      EUR. But not one single word was clear.      DIO. St! don't your teeth be gnashing.      EUR. 'Twas all Scamanders, moated camps, and griffin-eagles flashing In    burnished copper on the shields, chivalric-precipice-high Expressions,    hard to comprehend.      DIO. Aye, by the Powers, and I    Full many a sleepless night have spent in anxious thought, because    I'd find the tawny cock-horse out, what sort of bird it was!      AESCH. It was a sign, you stupid dolt, engraved the ships upon.      DIO. Eryxis I supposed it was, Philoxenus's son.      EUR. Now really should a cock be brought into a tragic play?      AESCH. You enemy of gods and men, what was _your_ practice, pray?      EUR. No cock-horse in _my_ plays, by Zeus, no goat-stag there you'll         see,    Such figures as are blazoned forth in Median tapestry.    When first I took the art from you, bloated and swoln, poor thing,    With turgid gasconading words and heavy dieting,    First I reduced and toned her down, and made her slim and neat    With wordlets and with exercise and poultices of beet,    And next a dose of chatterjuice, distilled from books, I gave her,    And monodies she took, with sharp Cephisophon for flavour.    I never used haphazard words, or plunged abruptly in;    Who entered first explained at large the drama's origin    And source.      DIO. Its source, I really trust, was better than your own.      EUR. Then from the very opening lines no idleness was shown;    The mistress talked with all her might, the servant talked as much,    The master talked, the maiden talked, the beldame talked.      AESCH. For such an outrage was not death your due?      EUR. No, by Apollo, no: That was my democratic way.      DIO. Ah, let that topic go. Your record is not there, my friend,    particularly good.      EUR. Then next I taught all these to speak.      AESCH. You did so, and I would    That ere such mischief you had wrought, your very lungs had split.      EUR. Canons of verse I introduced, and neatly chiselled wit;    To look, to scan: to plot, to plan: to twist, to turn, to woo:    On all to spy; in all to pry.      AESCH. You did: I say so too.      EUR. I showed them scenes of common life, the things we know and see,    Where any blunder would at once by all detected be.    I never blustered on, or took their breath and wits away    By Cycnuses or Memnons clad in terrible array,    With bells upon their horses' heads, the audience to dismay.    Look at _his_ pupils, look at mine: and there the contrast view.    Uncouth Megaenetus is his, and rough Phormisius too;    Great long-beard-lance-and-trumpet-men, flesh-tearers with the pine:    But natty smart Theramenes, and Cleitophon are mine.      DIO. Theramenes? a clever man and wonderfully sly:    Immerse him in a flood of ills, he'll soon be high and dry,    \"A Kian with a kappa, sir, not Chian with a chi.\"        EUR. I taught them all these knowing ways      By chopping logic in my plays,      And making all my speakers try      To reason out the How and Why.      So now the people trace the springs,      The sources and the roots of things,      And manage all their households too      Far better than they used to do,      Scanning and searching _What's amiss?_      And, _Why was that?_ And, _How is this?_        DIO. Ay, truly, never now a man      Comes home, but he begins to scan;      And to his household loudly cries,      _Why, where's my pitcher? What's the matter?      'Tis dead and gone my last year's platter.      Who gnawed these olives? Bless the sprat,      Who nibbled off the head of that?      And where's the garlic vanished, pray,      I purchased only yesterday?_      --Whereas, of old, our stupid youths      Would sit, with open mouths and eyes,      Like any dull-brained Mammacouths.        CHOR. \"All this thou beholdest, Achilles our boldest.\"      And what wilt thou reply?      Draw tight the rein      Lest that fiery soul of thine      Whirl thee out of the listed plain,      Past the olives, and o'er the line.      Dire and grievous the charge he brings.      See thou answer him, noble heart,      Not with passionate bickerings.      Shape thy course with a sailor's art,      Reef the canvas, shorten the sails,      Shift them edgewise to shun the gales.      When the breezes are soft and low,      Then, well under control, you'll go      Quick and quicker to strike the foe.      O first of all the Hellenic bards high loftily-towering verse to          rear,      And tragic phrase from the dust to raise, pour forth thy fountain          with right good cheer.      AESCH. My wrath is hot at this vile mischance, and my spirit revolts at    the thought that I    Must bandy words with a fellow like _him_: but lest he should vaunt    that I can't reply--    Come, tell me what are the points for which a noble poet our praise    obtains.      EUR. For his ready wit, and his counsels sage, and because the citizen    folk he trains    To be better townsmen and worthier men.      AESCH. If then you have done the very reverse,    Found noble-hearted and virtuous men, and altered them, each and all,    for the worse,    Pray what is the need you deserve to get?      DIO. Nay, ask not _him_. He deserves to die.      AESCH. For just consider what style of men he received from me, great         six-foot-high    Heroical souls, who never would blench from a townsman's duties in         peace or war;    Not idle loafers, or low buffoons, or rascally scamps such as now they         are.    But men who were breathing spears and helms, and the snow-white plume         in its crested pride    The greave, and the dart, and the warrior's heart in its seven-fold         casing of tough bull-hide.      DIO. He'll stun me, I know, with his armoury-work; this business is    going from bad to worse.      EUR. And how did you manage to make them so grand, exalted, and brave    with your wonderful verse?      DIO. Come, Aeschylus, answer, and don't stand mute in your self-willed    pride and arrogant spleen.      AESCH. A drama I wrote with the War-god filled.      DIO. Its name?      AESCH. 'Tis the \"Seven against Thebes\" that I mean. Which who so    beheld, with eagerness swelled to rush to the battlefield there and    then.      DIO. O that was a scandalous thing you did! You have made the Thebans         mightier men,    More eager by far for the business of war.    Now, therefore, receive this punch on the head.      AESCH. Ah, _ye_ might have practised the same yourselves, but ye turned         to other pursuits instead.    Then next the \"Persians\" I wrote, in praise of the noblest deed that         the world can show,    And each man longed for the victor's wreath, to fight and to vanquish         his country's foe.      DIO. I was pleased, I own, when I heard their moan for old Darius,         their great king, dead;    When they smote together their hands, like this, and _Evir alake_ the         Chorus said.      AESCH. Aye, such are the poet's appropriate works: and just consider         how all along    From the very first they have wrought you good, the noble bards, the         masters of song.    First, Orpheus taught you religious rites, and from bloody murder to         stay your hands:    Musaeus healing and oracle lore; and Hesiod all the culture of lands,    The time to gather, the time to plough.

And Abram hearkened to the voice of  Sarai.    01:016:003 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian,  after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to  her husband Abram to be his wife.    01:016:004 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she  saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.    01:016:005 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have  given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I  was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.    01:016:006 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand;  do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she  fled from her face.    01:016:007 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in  the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.    01:016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and  whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress  Sarai.    01:016:009 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy  mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.    01:016:010 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy  seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.    01:016:011 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art  with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael;  because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.    01:016:012 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every  man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the  presence of all his brethren.    01:016:013 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou  God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth  me?    01:016:014 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is  between Kadesh and Bered.    01:016:015 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,  which Hagar bare, Ishmael.    01:016:016 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare  Ishmael to Abram.    01:017:001 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD  appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before  me, and be thou perfect.    01:017:002 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will  multiply thee exceedingly.    01:017:003 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,    01:017:004 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt  be a father of many nations.    01:017:005 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name  shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.    01:017:006 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make  nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.    01:017:007 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy  seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be  a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.    01:017:008 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the  land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an  everlasting possession; and I will be their God.    01:017:009 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant  therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.    01:017:010 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you  and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.    01:017:011 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it  shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.    01:017:012 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,  every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or  bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.    01:017:013 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy  money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh  for an everlasting covenant.    01:017:014 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin  is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath  broken my covenant.    01:017:015 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt  not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.    01:017:016 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I  will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people  shall be of her.    01:017:017 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his  heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and  shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?    01:017:018 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before  thee!    01:017:019 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed;  and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant  with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.    01:017:020 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed  him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;  twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.    01:017:021 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah  shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.    01:017:022 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from  Abraham.    01:017:023 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in  his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the  men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in  the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.    01:017:024 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was  circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.    01:017:025 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was  circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.    01:017:026 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his  son.    01:017:027 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought  with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.    01:018:001 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he  sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;    01:018:002 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood  by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door,  and bowed himself toward the ground,    01:018:003 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight,  pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:    01:018:004 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your  feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:    01:018:005 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your  hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your  servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.    01:018:006 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make  ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon  the hearth.    01:018:007 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and  good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.    01:018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had  dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree,  and they did eat.    01:018:009 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,  Behold, in the tent.    01:018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to  the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah  heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.    01:018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and  it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.    01:018:012 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am  waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?    01:018:013 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,  saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?    01:018:014 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I  will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall  have a son.    01:018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.  And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.    01:018:016 And the"]]]
