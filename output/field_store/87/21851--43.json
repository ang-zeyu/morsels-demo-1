The elegant crested bird called cock-of-the-rock, admirably described  by Buffon, is a native of the woody mountains of Macoushia. In the  daytime it retires amongst the darkest rocks, and only comes out to  feed a little before sunrise and at sunset: he is of a gloomy  disposition and, like the houtou, never associates with the other birds  of the forest.    The Indians in the just-mentioned settlement seemed to depend more on  the wourali poison for killing their game than upon anything else. They  had only one gun, and it appeared rusty and neglected, but their  poisoned weapons were in fine order. Their blow-pipes hung from the  roof of the hut, carefully suspended by a silk-grass cord, and on  taking a nearer view of them no dust seemed to have collected there,  nor had the spider spun the smallest web on them, which showed that  they were in constant use. The quivers were close by them, with the  jaw-bone of the fish pirai tied by a string to their brim and a small  wicker-basket of wild cotton, which hung down to the centre; they were  nearly full of poisoned arrows. It was with difficulty these Indians  could be persuaded to part with any of the wourali poison, though a  good price was offered for it: they gave to understand that it was  powder and shot to them, and very difficult to be procured.    On the second day after leaving this settlement, in passing along, the  Indians show you a place where once a white man lived. His retiring so  far from those of his own colour and acquaintance seemed to carry  something extraordinary along with it, and raised a desire to know what  could have induced him to do so. It seems he had been unsuccessful, and  that his creditors had treated him with as little mercy as the strong  generally show to the weak. Seeing his endeavours daily frustrated and  his best intentions of no avail, and fearing that when they had taken  all he had they would probably take his liberty too, he thought the  world would not be hardhearted enough to condemn him for retiring from  the evils which pressed so heavily on him, and which he had done all  that an honest man could do to ward off. He left his creditors to talk  of him as they thought fit, and, bidding adieu for ever to the place in  which he had once seen better times, he penetrated thus far into these  remote and gloomy wilds and ended his days here.    According to the new map of South America, Lake Parima, or the White  Sea, ought to be within three or four days' walk from this place. On  asking the Indians whether there was such a place or not, and  describing that the water was fresh and good to drink, an old Indian,  who appeared to be about sixty, said that there was such a place, and  that he had been there. This information would have been satisfactory  in some degree had not the Indians carried the point a little too far.  It is very large, said another Indian, and ships come to it. Now these  unfortunate ships were the very things which were not wanted: had he  kept them out, it might have done, but his introducing them was sadly  against the lake. Thus you must either suppose that the old savage and  his companion had a confused idea of the thing, and that probably the  Lake Parima they talked of was the Amazons, not far from the city of  Para, or that it was their intention to deceive you. You ought to be  cautious in giving credit to their stories, otherwise you will be apt  to be led astray.    Many a ridiculous thing concerning the interior of Guiana has been  propagated and received as true merely because six or seven Indians,  questioned separately, have agreed in their narrative.    Ask those who live high up in the Demerara, and they will, every one of  them, tell you that there is a nation of Indians with long tails; that  they are very malicious, cruel and ill-natured; and that the Portuguese  have been obliged to stop them off in a certain river to prevent their  depredations. They have also dreadful stories concerning a horrible  beast called the water-mamma which, when it happens to take a spite  against a canoe, rises out of the river and in the most unrelenting  manner possible carries both canoe and Indians down to the bottom with  it, and there destroys them. Ludicrous extravagances! pleasing to those  fond of the marvellous, and excellent matter for a distempered brain.    The misinformed and timid court of policy in Demerara was made the dupe  of a savage who came down the Essequibo and gave himself out as king of  a mighty tribe. This naked wild man of the woods seemed to hold the  said court in tolerable contempt, and demanded immense supplies, all  which he got; and moreover, some time after, an invitation to come down  the ensuing year for more, which he took care not to forget.    This noisy chieftain boasted so much of his dynasty and domain that the  Government was induced to send up an expedition into his territories to  see if he had spoken the truth, and nothing but the truth. It appeared,  however, that his palace was nothing but a hut, the monarch a needy  savage, the heir-apparent nothing to inherit but his father's club and  bow and arrows, and his officers of state wild and uncultivated as the  forests through which they strayed.    There was nothing in the hut of this savage, saving the presents he had  received from Government, but what was barely sufficient to support  existence; nothing that indicated a power to collect a hostile force;  nothing that showed the least progress towards civilisation. All was  rude and barbarous in the extreme, expressive of the utmost poverty and  a scanty population.    You may travel six or seven days without seeing a hut, and when you  reach a settlement it seldom contains more than ten.    The farther you advance into the interior, the more you are convinced  that it is thinly inhabited.    The day after passing the place where the white man lived you see a  creek on the left-hand, and shortly after the path to the open country.  Here you drag the canoe up into the forest, and leave it there. Your  baggage must now be carried by the Indians. The creek you passed in the  river intersects the path to the next settlement; a large mora has  fallen across it and makes an excellent bridge. After walking an hour  and a half you come to the edge of the forest, and a savanna unfolds  itself to the view.    The finest park that England boasts falls far short of this delightful  scene. There are about two thousand acres of grass, with here and there  a clump of trees and a few bushes and single trees scattered up and  down by the hand of Nature. The ground is neither hilly nor level, but  diversified with moderate rises and falls, so gently running into one  another that the eye cannot distinguish where they begin nor where they  end; while the distant black rocks have the appearance of a herd at  rest. Nearly in the middle there is an eminence which falls off  gradually on every side, and on this the Indians have erected their  huts.    To the northward of them the forest forms a circle, as though it had  been done by art; to the eastward it hangs in festoons; and to the  south and west it rushes in abruptly, disclosing a new scene behind it  at every step as you advance along.    This beautiful park of Nature is quite surrounded by lofty hills, all  arrayed in superbest garb of trees: some in the form of pyramids,  others like sugar-loaves, towering one above the other, some rounded  off, and others as though they had lost their apex. Here two hills rise  up in spiral summits, and the wooded line of communication betwixt them  sinks so gradually that it forms a crescent; and there the ridges of  others resemble the waves of an agitated sea. Beyond these appear  others, and others past them, and others still farther on, till they  can scarcely be distinguished from the clouds.    There are no sand-flies nor bete-rouge nor mosquitos in this pretty  spot. The fire-flies, during the night, vie in numbers and brightness  with the stars in the firmament above; the air is pure, and the  north-east breeze blows a refreshing gale throughout the day. Here the  white-crested maroudi, which is never found in the Demerara, is pretty  plentiful; and here grows the tree which produces the moran, sometimes  called balsam-capivi.    Your route lies south from this place; and at the extremity of the  savanna you enter the forest and journey along a winding path at the  foot of a hill. There is no habitation within this day's walk. The  traveller, as usual, must sleep in the forest; the path is not so good  the following day. The hills over which it lies are rocky, steep and  rugged; and the spaces betwixt them swampy and mostly knee-deep in  water. After eight hours' walk you find two or three Indian huts,  surrounded by the forest; and in little more than half an hour from  these you come to ten or twelve others, where you pass the night. They  are prettily situated at the entrance into a savanna. The eastern and  western hills are still covered with wood; but on looking to the  south-west quarter you perceive it begins to die away. In these forests  you may find plenty of the trees which yield the sweet-smelling resin  called accaiari, and which, when pounded and burnt on charcoal, gives a  delightful fragrance.    From hence you proceed, in a south-west direction, through a long  swampy savanna. Some of the hills which border on it have nothing but a  thin coarse grass and huge stones on them: others quite wooded; others  with their summits crowned and their base quite bare; and others again  with their summits bare and their base in thickest wood.    Half of this day's march is in water nearly up to the knees. There are  four creeks to pass: one of them has a fallen tree across it. You must  make your own bridge across the other three. Probably, were the truth  known, these apparently four creeks are only the meanders of one.    The jabiru, the largest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8172"],[0,"History of Astronomy (#6)"],[1,"ully, be drawn to two points to be  found in his first and sixth books respectively. The first point  relates to the seasons, and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws  of rotating bodies. To use the words of Delambre,[7] in drawing  attention to the strange conception,      he imagined that the earth, revolving round the sun, ought always to    show to it the same face; the contrary phenomena surprised him: to    explain them he invented a third motion, and added it to the two    real motions (rotation and orbital revolution). By this third motion    the earth, he held, made a revolution on itself and on the poles of    the ecliptic once a year ... Copernicus did not know that motion in    a straight line is the natural motion, and that motion in a curve is    the resultant of several movements. He believed, with Aristotle,    that circular motion was the natural one.    Copernicus made this rotation of the earth's axis about the pole of  the ecliptic retrograde (i.e., opposite to the orbital revolution),  and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year,  the added part being 1/26000 of the whole, he was able to include the  precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons. His  explanation of the seasons is given on leaf 10 of his book (the pages  of this book are not all numbered, only alternate pages, or leaves).    In his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits  to the ecliptic. In regard to this the theory of Copernicus is unique;  and it will be best to explain this in the words of Grant in his great  work.[8] He says:--      Copernicus, as we have already remarked, did not attack the    principle of the epicyclical theory: he merely sought to make it    more simple by placing the centre of the earth's orbit in the centre    of the universe. This was the point to which the motions of the    planets were referred, for the planes of their orbits were made to    pass through it, and their points of least and greatest velocities    were also determined with reference to it.  By this arrangement the    sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary    system, but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with    the planets as the centre of their motions.    According to Copernicus' sixth book, the planes of the planetary  orbits do not pass through the sun, and the lines of apses do not pass  through to the sun.    Such was the theory advanced by Copernicus: The earth moves in an  epicycle, on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the  sun. The planets move in a similar way on epicycles, but their  deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun. The  moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle, itself centred  on a deferent, excentric to the earth.  The earth's axis rotates about  the pole of the ecliptic, making one revolution and a twenty-six  thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year, in the opposite  direction to its orbital motion.    In view of this fanciful structure it must be noted, in fairness to  Copernicus, that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged  to accept his system as showing the real motions; that it does not  matter whether they be true, even approximately, or not, so long as  they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets  among the stars can be predicted.[9] He says that whoever is not  satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that  \"mathematics are for mathematicians\" (Mathematicis mathematica  scribuntur).    At the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that  the earth is in motion. It is with him a pious belief, just as it was  with Pythagoras and his school and with Aristarchus. \"But\" (as Dreyer  says in his most interesting book, _Tycho Brahe_) \"proofs of the  physical truth of his system Copernicus had given none, and could give  none,\" any more than Pythagoras or Aristarchus.    There was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the  cautious astronomer to accept it, as there was in the later Keplerian  system; and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his  system, which had no physical basis to recommend it, and no  simplification at all over the Egypto-Tychonic system, to which  Copernicus himself drew attention. It has been necessary to devote  perhaps undue space to the interesting work of Copernicus, because by  a curious chance his name has become so widely known. He has been  spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is  now accepted. This seems unfair, and on reading over what has been  written about him at different times it will be noticed that the  astronomers--those who have evidently read his great book--are very  cautious in the words with which they eulogise him, and refrain from  attributing to him the foundation of our solar system, which is  entirely due to Kepler.  It is only the more popular writers who give  the idea that a revolution had been effected when Pythagoras' system  was revived, and when Copernicus supported his view that the earth  moves and is not fixed.    It may be easy to explain the association of the name of Copernicus  with the Keplerian system. But the time has long passed when the  historian can support in any way this popular error, which was started  not by astronomers acquainted with Kepler's work, but by those who  desired to put the Church in the wrong by extolling Copernicus.    Copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from  philosophers for opposing the authority of Aristotle, who had declared  that the earth was fixed.  So he sought and obtained the support of  the Church, dedicating his great work to Pope Paul III. in a lengthy  explanatory epistle. The Bishop of Cracow set up a memorial tablet in  his honour.    Copernicus was the most refined exponent, and almost the last  representative, of the Epicyclical School.  As has been already  stated, his successor, Tycho Brahe, supported the same use of  epicycles and excentrics as Copernicus, though he held the earth to be  fixed. But Tycho Brahe was eminently a practical observer, and took  little part in theory; and his observations formed so essential a  portion of the system of Kepler that it is only fair to include his  name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we  accept to-day.    In now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that  it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves. On reading  Airy's account of epicycles, in the beautifully clear language of his  _Six Lectures on Astronomy_, the impression is made that the  jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed  to be real. This is no more the case than that the spheres of Eudoxus  and Callippus were supposed to be real. Both were introduced only to  illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar,  planetary, and lunar tables were constructed.  The epicycles  represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the Fourier  series, which in the last century has become a basis of such  calculations, both in astronomy and physics generally.

[5] In his great book Copernicus says: \"The movement of the heavenly  bodies is uniform, circular, perpetual, or else composed of circular  movements.\" In this he proclaimed himself a follower of Pythagoras  (see p. 14), as also when he says: \"The world is spherical because the  sphere is, of all figures, the most perfect\" (Delambre,  _Ast. Mod. Hist_., pp. 86, 87).    [6] Kepler tells us that Tycho Brahe was pleased with this  device, and adapted it to his own system.    [7] _Hist. Ast._, vol. i., p. 354.    [8] _Hist. of Phys.

THE DYNAMICAL PERIOD        5. DISCOVERY OF THE TRUE SOLAR SYSTEM--TYCHO BRAHE--KEPLER.      During the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival, at the  beginning of the sixteenth century, the \"spirit of the age\" was  fostered by the invention of printing, by the downfall of the  Byzantine Empire, and the scattering of Greek fugitives, carrying the  treasures of literature through Western Europe, by the works of  Raphael and Michael Angelo, by the Reformation, and by the extension  of the known world through the voyages of Spaniards and Portuguese.  During that period there came to the front the founder of accurate  observational astronomy. Tycho Brahe, a Dane, born in 1546 of noble  parents, was the most distinguished, diligent, and accurate observer  of the heavens since the days of Hipparchus, 1,700 years before.    Tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood, and the  opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to  overcome difficulties.  He soon grasped the hopelessness of the old  deductive methods of reasoning, and decided that no theories ought to  be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of  accurate observations.  We may claim for him the title of founder of  the inductive method.    For a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to  Dreyer's _Tycho Brahe_, Edinburgh, 1890, containing a complete  bibliography. The present"]]]
