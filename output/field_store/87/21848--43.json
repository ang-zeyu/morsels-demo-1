Wort was given, with apparently good effect, and the symptoms  disappeared.    \"No other cases occurred during the voyage, but the wort was served out  at sea as a regular article of diet.\"    To this it may be added, that no opportunity was, as appears by the  Journal, ever lost of getting wild celery and any other wild herb that  presented itself.    The personal washing is mentioned by Mr. Perry, and the tradition in the  Navy is, that the men's deck was more constantly scrubbed than had then  been usual; in fact, that unusual attention was paid to cleanliness.  Stoves were used to dry the decks below even in hot weather.    As this voyage forms the subject of this book, its events may be passed  over briefly.    Calling at Madeira--where the log records that the Endeavour was fired  upon by the fort on the Loo Rock through some misapprehension while  shifting berth, though Cook passes this by in silence--and Rio Janeiro,  Cook proceeded to double Cape Horn. His predecessors had struggled  through the Strait of Magellan, losing much time and wearing out their  men with the continual anchoring and weighing in that long and narrow  passage, rendered necessary by the constant foul and strong winds that  prevail. The idea was to avoid the heavy seas and gales of the open sea;  but Cook's action was amply justified by a more rapid passage without any  danger. Discovering several of the low coral atolls of the Paumotu Group,  he arrived at Tahiti on April 13th, 1769.    On July 13th, the transit of Venus having been observed under favourable  conditions on June 1st, he left Tahiti, exploring and mapping the Society  Islands immediately to the westward, never before visited, and then stood  to the southward. It may here be mentioned that it is only during the  last decade that Cook's charts of the Society Group have been superseded  by more elaborate surveys by the French.    Cook went to 40 degrees south, discovering one of the Austral Group on  his way, when, finding no sign of the hypothetical southern Continent,  and getting into very dirty weather, he first gained a more northern  latitude and favourable winds, and then stood for New Zealand.    On October 7th he arrived at Poverty Bay, and during the next six months  he completely circumnavigated and mapped the islands of New Zealand. He  had received on board at Tahiti a native, one Tupia, formerly the high  priest, and a man of much intelligence. Tupia proved to be of the utmost  service, as, to their astonishment and delight, they found that the  languages were sufficiently identical to enable him to act as a most  efficient interpreter; which made it possible to obtain information, and  establish relations with the New Zealanders which they could never have  succeeded in doing without him.    Cook now, after consideration, determined to explore the unknown east  coast of New Holland. The health of his ship's company, and the good  order on board, permitted him to make this good use of his time, instead  of hurrying on to a civilised port, as all his forerunners had had to do.    He struck Australia at its south-east point, and followed the whole coast  to the northward, mapping it as he went.    When nearing the northern end the voyage nearly came to a premature  conclusion by the ship grounding on a coral reef, twenty miles from the  land. Cook's seamanship was, however, equal to the occasion. The ship was  got off, much damaged and leaking severely, and carried into a little  port they discovered not far off. Here she was cleared out and laid upon  the ground, the tide sufficing to dry enough of her bottom to let the  carpenters repair it.    The wisdom of Cook's choice of a ship of the build of the Endeavour was  here very apparent. It was not every ship that could be safely beached in  this way without danger of falling over. After long delay she proceeded  on her voyage, and soon had a second narrow escape. The long line of  coral reefs that front the northern part of Eastern Australia, for a  distance of 1200 miles, approach the coast about the place where the ship  had grounded. The passage between the outer reef and the land is strewn  with shoals, and finding his further progress much impeded by them, and  fearful of a repetition of his disaster, Cook with some difficulty found  a channel to seaward, and gained the open ocean. He was, however, yet  determined to follow the land he was exploring, and more especially to  solve the great question as to whether Australia was joined to New Guinea  or no; and three days after his escape from the line of reefs he found  himself with a light wind, embayed on the outer side of them, with the  reefs close to him, and the ship drifting slowly but surely on them, the  heavy swell of the great ocean breaking mountains high on their outer  edge.    Here again calmness and promptitude saved him, and the ship was pushed  through a narrow channel in these terrible reefs into the smooth, though  reef-dotted, waters within. No event in the voyage is more dramatically  narrated, though without any exaggeration, than this hair-breadth escape.    With the caution born of recent dangers, Cook now slowly found his way  through the maze of reefs, by a route that no one has again followed, to  the northern point of Australia, and was rewarded for his pertinacity by  finding the channel now known as Torres Strait, which led him between New  Guinea and Australia.    Thus far Cook's enthusiasm in adventure and desire to explore had been  fully shared by his companions; but it is apparent that at this point  they fell short of his high standard. Cook, having secured his direct  passage to Batavia, and having still a little provision left, was anxious  to do still more in the way of discovery, and stood over to the  little-known New Guinea shore. It is evident, however, from Cook's  expressions, though he does not complain, that his people were pining for  fresh food and civilisation. Australia had produced them little but  occasional fish and a few turtle. The salt provisions of those days were  most unpalatable, and the effect of their continued hard work and  inadequate food for so long, for they were now over two years from  England, with no communication of any kind with the outer world, were  telling on them, though they were still free from scurvy.    Cook, therefore, after landing once in New Guinea, unwillingly turned his  ship's head towards Batavia.    The complaints grew louder as he passed by Timor without attempting to  communicate, and falling in with the island of Savu, he yielded to  importunity, and touched there to get refreshments.    Thence he went by the south shore of the chain of islands to Sunda Strait  and Batavia.    So far all had gone well. It was undoubtedly far the most successful  voyage ever made. Much had been done--more than his orders directed--to  explore unknown lands, and the dire enemy of seamen, scurvy, had been  conquered.    But his luck was not to last.    It was absolutely necessary to remain some time at Batavia, while the  roughly repaired damage to the ship was made good in the Dutch dockyard.    Two months and a half in the sickly climate of Batavia, during a bad time  of the year, wrought a sad change in his ship's company. The port they so  much desired proved but the door of the grave to many of them, and Cook  sailed for England on December 27th, 1770, with dysentery pervading the  ship. The surgeon had already died of it; so had the poor Tahitian,  Tupia, with two seamen, and one of Mr. Banks' artists.    Worse was, however, to follow. Day by day, as the ship slowly found her  way over the Indian Ocean towards the Cape, against the wet and unhealthy  north-west monsoon, the sick list grew larger. Man after man succumbed,  and before half the distance to Capetown was traversed twenty-two more  were carried off. Green, the astronomer, two more of Banks' staff, two  midshipmen, the boatswain and carpenter were among the number. The crew  was more than decimated.    The ship touched at the Cape, and war with France being expected, the  Endeavour joined the East India convoy, under H.M.S. Portland, at St.  Helena. The heavy-sailing, collier-built craft was not, however, when the  ships had crossed the line and got upon a wind, able to keep up with  them, and she once more found herself alone on her way.    Two more officers, the First Lieutenant, Mr. Hicks, and the Master, Mr.  Molineux, died after leaving the Cape, but not of dysentery, and the ship  finally reached England on June 12th, 1771.    Ninety-four persons left England in the Endeavour, of whom fifty-four  returned. Thirty-eight died on the voyage, out of which number thirty-one  died after reaching Batavia, most of them from fever and dysentery  contracted at that place.    After paying off in August 1771, the Endeavour was sold in 1775, and for  many years sailed as a collier in the North Sea.    This voyage gave a new impetus to discovery, and the immediate thought  was to resume it, under this heaven-born leader.    Cook was given little leisure, as it was nearly at once decided to send  him out again, and he was appointed to command the Resolution on November  28th, 1771, the interval having been occupied in considering what ships  should be employed.    Cook's experience of the qualities of the Endeavour caused him to uphold  the selection of similar vessels, for there were to be two, and the  Resolution and Adventure, of 462 and 336 tons respectively, both Whitby  built colliers, were bought for the voyage. Cook was promoted to  Commander, and Tobias Furnaux, in the Adventure, was placed under his  command.

Thus much haue I written of these seuen Ilands by experience, because I was  a dweller there, as I haue sayd before, the space of seuen yeeres in the  affaires of master Thomas Locke, master Anthonie Hickman, and master Edward  Caselin, who in those dayes were worthy merchants, and of great credite in  the citie of London.      A description of the Iland of Madera.    The Iland of Madera standeth in 32 degrees distant from the equinoctinall  line, and seuentie leagues from the Ile of Tenerif Northeastward and  Southwest from Hercules pillars. This Iland was first discouered by one  Macham an Englishman, and was after conquered and inhabited by the  Portugall nation. It was first called the Iland of Madera, by reason of the  great wildernesse of sundry sortes of trees that there did growe, and yet  doe, as Cedars, Cypres, Vinatico, Barbuzano, Pine trees, and diuers others,  and therefore the sayd Iland continueth still with the same name. Howbeit  they hold opinion, that betweene the sayd Iland, and the Ile of Palma is an  Iland not yet discouered, which is the true Iland Madera called saint  Brandon. This Iland yeeldeth a great summe of money to the king of  Portugall yeerely: it hath one faire citie called Fouchall, which hath one  faire port or harbour for shippes, and a strong bulwarke, and a faire  Cathedrall church, with a bishop and other dignities thereunto  appertaining. There is also iustice and gouernment according to the  Portugall vse. But causes of appellation are remitted to the citie of  Lisbone in Portugall to the kings superior iudges there. This Iland hath  another towne called Machico, which hath likewise a good road for ships,  which towne and road were so called after the name of Macham the  Englishman, who first discouered the same. There are also sixteene sugar  houses called Ingenios, which make excellent good sugar.    There is besides the goodly timber before declared, great store of diuers  sortes of fruites, as Peares, Apples, Plummes, wild Dates, Peaches of  diuers sortes, Mellons, Batatas, Orenges, Lemmons, Pomgranates, Citrons,  Figges, and all maner of garden herbes. There are many Dragon trees, such  as grow in the Canarie Ilands, but chiefly this land produceth great  quantitie of singular good wines which are laden for many places. On the  North side of this land three leagues distant from the maine Iland standeth  another litle Iland called Porto santo: the people thereof liueth by  husbandrie, for the Iland of Madera yeeldeth but litle corne, but rather is  thereof prouided out of France and from the Iland of Tenerif. On the East  side of the Ile of Madera sixe leagues distant standeth another litle Iland  called the Desert, which produceth onely Orchell, and nourisheth a great  number of Goates, for the prouision of the maine Iland, which may be  thirtie leagues in circuit: and the land is of great heighth where the  foresayd trees growe. It is woonder to see the conueyance of the water to  the Ingenios by Mines through the mountaines.    In the mid way betweene Tenerif and the Iland of Madera standeth a litle  solitarie Iland called the Saluages, which may bee about one league in  compasse, which hath neither tree nor fruit, but is onely food for Goates.

Not  coueting to make of my floudde, a nother mannes ebbe (the Cancre of all  commune wealthes) but rather to sette other a flote, where I my self strake  on ground. Tourning me therefore, to the searche of wisedome and vertue,  for whose sake either we tosse, or oughte to tosse so many papers and  tongues: although I founde aboute my self, verie litle of that Threasure,  yet remembred I that a fewe yeres paste, at the instaunce of a good  Citezein, (who might at those daies, by aucthoritie commaunde me) I had  begonne to translate, a litle booke named in the Latine, Omnium gentium  mores, gathered longe sence by one Iohannes Boemus, a manne as it appereth,  of good iudgemente and diligence. But so corrupted in the Printing, that  after I had wrasteled a space, with sondrie Printes, I rather determined to  lose my labour of the quartre tanslacion, then to be shamed with the haulf.  And throwing it a side, entended no further to wearie my self therwithall,  at the leaste vntill I mighte finde a booke of a bettre impression. In  searching whereof at this my retourne to my studie, although I found not at  the full that, that I sought for: yet vndrestanding among the booke sellers  (as one talke bringes in another) that men of good learning and eloquence,  bothe in the Frenche and Italien tonge, had not thought skorne to bestowe  their time aboute the translacion therof, and that the Emperours Maiestie  that now is, vouched saulfe to receiue the presentacion therof, at the  Frenche translatours hande, as well appereth in his booke: it kindled me  againe, vpon regard of mine owne profite, and other mennes moe, to bring  that to some good pointe, that earst I had begonne. For (thought I) seing  the booke hath in it, much pleasant varietie of thinges, and yet more  profite in the pitthe: if it faile to bee otherwise rewarded, yet shal it  thankefully of the good be regarded. Wherefore setting vpon it a fresshe,  where the booke is deuided acording to thaunciente diuision of the earth  into thre partes, Affrique, Asie, and Europe: hauing brought to an ende the  two firste partes, I found no persons in mine opinion so fitte as your  honour, to present theim vnto.

Exercised so many waies in the waues of a fickle Commune  wealthe: troubled sometime, but neuer disapoincted of honourable successe.  To your good Lordeshippe then I yelde and committe, the firste fruictes of  my libertie, the firste croppe of my labours, this first daie of the Newe  yere: beseching the same in as good parte to receiue it, as I humblie offre  it, and at your pleasure to vnfolde the Fardle, and considre the stuffe.

And to conclude, if I shall vndrestande, that your honour  delighteth in this, it shal be a cause sufficiente, to make me go in hande  with Europe, that yet remaineth vntouched.
