To the President.--I write this letter not on my own account, but on  behalf of a personal friend of mine who is known as a mugwump. He is a  great worker for political reform, but he cannot spell very well, so he  has asked me to write this letter. He knew that I had been thrown among  great men all my life, and that, owing to my high social position and fine  education, I would be peculiarly fitted to write you in a way that would  not call forth disagreeable remarks, and so he has given me the points and  I have arranged them for you.    In the first place, my friend desires me to convey to you, Mr. President,  in a delicate manner, and in such language as to avoid giving offense,  that he is somewhat disappointed in your Cabinet. I hate to talk this way  to a bran-new President, but my friend feels hurt and he desires that I  should say to you that he regrets your short-sighted policy. He says that  it seems to him there is very little in the course of the administration  so far to encourage a man to shake off old party ties and try to make men  better. He desires to say that after conversing with a large number of the  purest men, men who have been in both political parties off and on for  years and yet have never been corrupted by office, men who have left  convention after convention in years past because those conventions were  corrupt and endorsed other men than themselves for office, he finds that  your appointment of Cabinet officers will only please two classes, viz:  Democrats and Republicans.    [Illustration: WORKING FOR REFORM.]    Now, what do you care for an administration which will only gratify those  two old parties? Are you going to snap your fingers in disdain at men who  admit that they are superior to anybody else? Do you want history to  chronicle the fact that President Cleveland accepted the aid of the pure  and highly cultivated gentlemen who never did anything naughty or  unpretty, and then appointed his Cabinet from men who had been known for  years as rude, naughty Democrats?    My friend says that he feels sure you would not have done so if you had  fully realized how he felt about it. He claims that in the first week of  your administration you have basely truckled to the corrupt majority. You  have shown yourself to be the friend of men who never claimed to be truly  good.    If you persist in this course you will lose the respect and esteem of my  friend and another man who is politically pure, and who has never smirched  his escutcheon with an office. He has one of the cleanest and most  vigorous escutcheons in that county. He never leaves it out over night  during the summer, and in the winter he buries it in sawdust. Both of  these men will go back to the Republican party in 1888 if you persist in  the course you have thus far adopted. They would go back now if the  Republican party insisted on it.    Mr. President, I hate to write to you in this tone of voice, because I  know the pain it will give you. I once held an office myself, Mr.  President, and it hurt my feelings very much to have a warm personal  friend criticise my official acts.    The worst feature of the whole thing, Mr. President, is that it will  encourage crime. If men who never committed any crime are allowed to earn  their living by the precarious methods peculiar to manual labor, and if  those who have abstained from office for years, by request of many  citizens, are to be denied the endorsement of the administration, they  will lose courage to go on and do right in the future. My friend desires  to state vicariously, in the strongest terms, that both he and his wife  feel the same way about it, and they will not promise to keep it quiet any  longer. They feel like crippling the administration in every way they can  if the present policy is to be pursued.    He says he dislikes to begin thus early to threaten a President who has  barely taken off his overshoes and drawn his mileage, but he thinks it may  prevent a recurrence of these unfortunate mistakes. He claims that you  have totally misunderstood the principles of the mugwumps all the way  through. You seem to regard the reform movement as one introduced for the  purpose of universal benefit. This was not the case. While fully endorsing  and supporting reform, he says that they did not go into it merely to kill  time or simply for fun. He also says that when he became a reformer and  supported you, he did not think there were so many prominent Democrats who  would have claims upon you. He can only now deplore the great national  poverty of offices and the boundless wealth of raw material in the  Democratic party from which to supply even that meagre demand.    He wishes me to add, also, that you must have over-estimated the zeal of  his party for civil service reform. He says that they did not yearn for  civil service reform so much as many people seem to think.    I must now draw this letter to a close. We are all well with the exception  of colds in the head, but nothing that need give you any uneasiness. Our  large seal-brown hen last week, stimulated by a rising egg market,  over-exerted herself, and on Saturday evening, as the twilight gathered,  she yielded to a complication of pip and softening of the brain and  expired in my arms. She certainly led a most exemplary life and the forked  tongue of slander could find naught to utter against her.    Hoping that you are enjoying the same great blessing and that you will  write as often as possible without waiting for me, I remain,    Very respectfully yours,    Bill Nye.    [Dictated Letter.]          Milling in Pompeii.    While visiting Naples, last fall, I took a great interest in the wonderful  museum there, of objects that have been exhumed from the ruins of Pompeii.  It is a remarkable collection, including, among other things, the  cumbersome machinery of a large woolen factory, the receipts, contracts,  statements of sales, etc., etc., of bankers, brokers, and usurers. I was  told that the exhumist also ran into an Etruscan bucket-shop in one part  of the city, but, owing to the long, dry spell, the buckets had fallen to  pieces.    The object which engrossed my attention the most, however, was what seems  to have been a circular issued prior to the great volcanic vomit of 79  A.D., and no doubt prior even to the Christian era. As the date is torn  off however, we are left to conjecture the time at which it was issued. I  was permitted to make a copy of it, and with the aid of my hired man, I  have translated it with great care.    Office of Lucretius & Procalus,  Dealers In  Flour, Bran, Shorts, Middlings, Screenings, Etruscan Hen Feed, and Other  Choice Bric-A-Brac.    _Highest Cash Price Paid for Neapolitan Winter Wheat and Roman Corn    Why haul your Wheat through the sand to Herculaneum when we pay the same  price here?_    Office and Mill, Via VIII, Near the Stabian Gate, Only Thirteen Blocks  From the P.O., Pompeii.    Dear Sir: This circular has been called out by another one issued last  month by Messrs. Toecorneous & Chilblainicus, alleged millers and wheat  buyers of Herculaneum, in which they claim to pay a quarter to a half-cent  more per bushel than we do for wheat, and charge us with docking the  farmers around Pompeii a pound per bushel more than necessary for cockle,  wild buck-wheat, and pigeon-grass seed. They make the broad statement that  we have made all our money in that way, and claim that Mr. Lucretius, of  our mill, has erected a fine house, which the farmers allude to as the  \"wild buckwheat villa.\"    [Illustration: TWO OLD ROMANS.]    We do not, as a general rule, pay any attention to this kind of stuff; but  when two snide romans, who went to Herculaneum without a dollar and drank  stale beer out of an old Etruscan tomato-can the first year they were  there, assail our integrity, we feel justified in making a prompt and  final reply. We desire to state to the Roman farmers that we do not test  their wheat with the crooked brass tester that has made more money for  Messrs. Toecorneous & Chilblainicus than their old mill has. We do not do  that kind of business. Neither do we buy a man's wheat at a cash price and  then work off four or five hundred pounds of XXXX Imperial hog feed on him  in part payment. When we buy a man's wheat we pay him in money. We do not  seek to fill him up with sour Carthagenian cracked wheat and orders on the  store.    We would also call attention to the improvements that we have just made in  our mill. Last week we put a handle in the upper burr, and we have also  engaged one of the best head millers in Pompeii to turn the crank  day-times. Our old head miller will oversee the business at night, so that  the mill will be in full blast night and day, except when the head miller  has gone to his meals or stopped to spit on his hands.    The mill of our vile contemporaries at Herculaneum is an old one that was  used around Naples one hundred years ago to smash rock for the Neapolitan  road, and is entirely out of repair. It was also used in a brick-yard here  near Pompeii; then an old junk man sold it to a tenderfoot from Jerusalem  as an ice-cream freezer. He found that it would not work, and so used it  to grind up potato bugs for blisters. Now it is grinding ostensible flour  at Herculaneum.    We desire to state to the farmers about Pompeii and Herculaneum that we  aim to please. We desire to make a grade of flour this summer that will  not have to be run through the coffee mill before it can be used.

At last she  succeeded in inducing him to go to sleep. While he was unconscious, the  deceitful princess stole the purse and left him alone in the chamber.    When he awoke, he saw that the princess had deserted him and that  his purse was gone. \"Surely I am doomed to die if I don't leave this  kingdom at once,\" said he to himself. \"My purse is gone, and I cannot  now fulfil my contract.\" He at once hurried home, told his parents to  abandon their home and town, and he himself started on a journey for  another kingdom. After much travelling, he reached mountainous places,  and had eaten but little for many a day.    By good luck he came across a tree heavily laden with fruits. The  tree was strange to him; but the delicious appearance of its fruit,  and his hunger, tempted him to try some. While he was eating, he was  terrified to find that two horns had appeared on his forehead. He tried  his best to pull them off, but in vain. The next day he saw another  tree, whose fruit appeared even more tempting. He climbed it, picked  some fruits, and ate them. To his surprise, his horns immediately  fell off. He wrapped some of this fruit up in his handkerchief,  and then went back to find the tree whose fruit he had eaten the day  before. He again ate some of its fruit, and again two horns grew out  of his head. Then he ate some of the other kind, and the horns fell  off. Confident now that he had a means of recovering his purse, he  gathered some of the horn-producing fruits, wrapped them in his shirt,  and started home. By this time he had been travelling for nearly two  years, and his face had so changed that he could not be recognized  by his own parents, or by his town-mates who had been hired by the  king to search for him for execution.    When he reached his town, he decided to place himself in the king's  palace as a helper of the royal cook. As he was willing to work without  pay, he easily came to terms with the cook. One of the conditions  of their agreement was that the cook would tell him whatever the  king or the king's family were talking about. After a few months  the charcoal-maker proved himself to be an excellent cook. In fact,  he was now doing all the cooking in the palace; for the chief cook  spent most of his time somewhere else, coming home only at meal times.    Now comes the fun of the story. One day while the cook was gone,  the youth ground up the two kinds of fruit. He mixed the kind that  produced horns with the king's food: the other kind, which caused  the horns to fall off, he mixed with water and put into a jar. The  cook arrived, and everything was ready. The table was prepared,  and the king and his family were called to eat. The queen and the  king and the beautiful princess, who were used to wearing golden  crowns set with diamonds and other precious stones, were then to be  seen with sharp ugly horns on their heads. When the king discovered  that they all had horns, he summoned the cook at once, and asked,  \"What kind of food did you give us?\"    \"The same food that your Highness ate a week ago,\" replied the cook,  who was terrified to see the royal family with horns.    \"Cook, go and find a doctor. Don't tell him or any one else that we  have horns. Tell the doctor that the king wants him to perform an  operation,\" ordered the king.    The cook set out immediately to find a doctor; but he was intercepted  by the charcoal-maker, who was eager to hear the king's order. \"Where  are you going? Say, cook, why are you in such a hurry? What is the  matter?\"    \"Don't bother me!\" said the cook. \"I am going to find a doctor. The  king and his family have horns on their heads, and I am ordered to  find a doctor who can take them off.\"    \"I can make those horns fall off. You needn't bother to find a  doctor. Here, try some of this food, cook!\" said the helper, giving him  some of the same food he had prepared for the king. The cook tried it,  and it was good; but, to his alarm, he felt two horns on his head. To  prevent rumors from reaching the ears of the king, the youth then  gave the cook a glass of the water he had prepared, and the horns  fell off. While the charcoal-maker was playing this trick on the cook,  he related the story of his magical purse, and how he had lost it.    \"Change your clothes, then, and get ready, and I will present you to  the king as the doctor,\" said the cook.    The helper then dressed himself just like a doctor of surgery, and  was conducted by the cook into the king's presence.    \"Doctor, I want you to do all you can, and use the best of your wisdom,  to take off these horns from our heads. But before doing it, promise me  first that you will not unfold the matter to the people; for my queen,  my daughter, and I would rather die than be known to have lived with  horns. If you succeed in taking them off, you shall inherit one-half  of my kingdom and have the hand of my fair daughter,\" said the king.    \"I do promise. But listen, O king! In order to get rid of those horns,  you must undergo the severest treatment, which may cause your death,\"  replied the doctor.    \"It is no matter. If we should die, we would rather die hornless than  live with horns,\" said the king.    After the agreement was written out, the doctor ordered the  treatment. The king and the queen were to be whipped until they bled,  while the princess was to dance with the doctor until she became  exhausted. These were the remedies given by the doctor.    While the king and queen were being whipped, the doctor who, we must  remember, was the cook's helper--went to the kitchen to get the jar of  water which he had prepared. The cruel servants who were scourging the  king and the queen took much delight in their task, and did not quit  until the king and queen were almost lifeless. The doctor forgot the  royal couple while he was dancing with the princess, and found them  just about to die. He succeeded, however, in giving them some of the  fruit-water he had made ready, and the horns fell off. The princess,  exhausted, also asked for a drink when she stopped dancing, and the  horns fell off her head too.    A few days afterwards the king and the queen died, and the doctor  succeeded to the throne, with the beautiful princess as his  wife. Then the doctor told her that he was the poor charcoal-maker  who had owned the magic purse that she had stolen from him. As soon  as he was seated on the throne, he made his friend the cook one of  his courtiers. Although the new king was uneducated and unrefined,  he welcomed all wise men to his palace as his counsellors, and his  kingdom prospered as it had never done under its previous rulers.      Notes.    Another Tagalog version, called \"Pedro's Fortunes\" and narrated by  Facundo Esquivel of Nueva Ecija, represents the hero as inheriting  the inexhaustible purse from his father.    Pedro, with his wealth, soon attracts the notice of the princess,  who slyly wheedles his purse away from him. Bent on revenge, he sets  out travelling. Hunger soon drives him to eat some beautiful blossoms  he finds on a strange tree in the mountains. No sooner has he eaten,  however, than horns grow out of his forehead. At first in despair,  but later becoming philosophical, he eats some of the leaves of the  tree. Horns disappear. Taking blossoms and leaves with him, he goes  on. He finds another tree with blossoms similar to the first. He  eats: fangs from upper jaw. Eats leaves from the same tree: fangs  disappear. Takes with him specimens of both flowers and leaves. Third  tree: blossoms tail-producing. When he reaches home, he makes a  decoction of the three kinds of flowers, then goes to the palace  and sells \"lemonade from Paradise.\" King, queen, and princess drink:  horns, fangs, tails. All efforts to remove them vain. Proclamation  that princess's hand will be given to whoever can cure the royal  family. Disguised as a doctor, Pedro cures king, queen, and princess  with a decoction of the three kinds of leaves, first, however,  demanding and getting back his purse. Pedro is married to princess.    These two stories (No. 2 and the variant) belong to the type in which  the hero loses a magic article (or three magic articles) through the  trickery of a princess, but recovers it (them) again by the aid of  fruits (blossoms) which, if eaten, cause bodily deformity,--leprosy,  horns, a tail, a long nose, transformation into an animal, or the  like. The princess, a victim of one of these fruits, which the  hero causes her to eat unwittingly, can be restored to her former  beauty only by eating of another fruit which the hero, disguised as a  physician, supplies on condition that the magic articles first stolen  be given up. A detailed study of this cycle has been made by Antti  Aarne (pp. 85-142). Aarne names the cycle \"The Three Magic Articles  and the Wonderful Fruit.\" After an examination of some hundred and  forty-five variants of the story, all but four of which are European,  he concludes that the tale arose among the Celts (British Isles and  France) and spread eastward (p. 135), and that the farther we go  from these two lands, the more freely are the original details of  the story handled (p. 137).    The prototype of this folk-tale Aarne reconstructs as follows  (pp. 124-125):--    There are three brothers, soldiers. Each comes into the possession of  a specific magic article. One obtains a purse which is never empty;  the second, a horn which when blown raises an army; and the third, a  mantle which transports its owner wherever he commands it to go. (The  owner of the purse begins to lead such a luxurious life, that he  becomes acquainted with the king and his family.) The king's daughter  deprives the hero of his magic purse. He gets from his brother the  second magic article, but the same thing happens again: the princess  steals the horn likewise. A third time the hero goes to"]]]
