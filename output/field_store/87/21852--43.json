LESSON 13.                                  Mal-, -in-.    In Esperanto certain syllables which have a definite meaning are placed  at the beginning (prefixes) or end (suffixes) of words to alter in some  way the meaning of those words.    The prefix \"mal-\" gives an exactly opposite meaning to the word to which  it is prefixed, as \"dekstra\", right (hand); \"maldekstra\", left (hand);  \"nova\", new; \"malnova\", old; \"helpi\", to help, \"malhelpi\", to hinder;  \"fermi\", to shut, \"malfermi\", to open.    The suffix \"-in-\" denotes the female sex. From \"viro\", [Footnote: The  word \"homo\" previously given (Lesson 2) signifies a human being, a  person, without reference to sex; \"viro\" means a man as distinguished  from a woman.] a man, we get \"virino\", a woman; \"filo\", son, \"filino\",  daughter; \"cxevalo\", a horse, \"cxevalino\", a mare; \"koko\", a cock,  \"kokino\", a hen.                                  VOCABULARY.       kresko : growth.                   ferm- : shut.     haro : hair (substance).           help- : help.     haroj : hair (of head).            farigx- : become.     nazo : nose.                       dekstra : right (hand).     vojo : road.                       meza : middle, medium.     viro : man.                        dika : thick, stout.     edzo : husband,                    mola : soft.     nepo : grandson.                   luma : light (luminous).     nevo : nephew.                     nobla : noble (character).     bovo : ox.                         rekta : straight.     vidvo : widower,                   kurba : curved.     fiancxo : fiance.                  felicxa : happy.     nenio : nothing.                   naskita : born.     turment- : torment.                fermita : shut.     sent- : feel.                      ecx : even.     ben- : bless.                      longe : for a long time.     estim- : have esteem for.          denove : anew, again.    Mia frato ne estas granda, sed li ne estas malgranda, li estas de meza  kresko. Haro estas tre maldika. La nokto estas tiel malluma, ke ni  nenion povas vidi ecx antaux nia nazo. Tiu cxi malfresxa pano estas  malmola, kiel sxtono. Malbonaj infanoj amas turmenti bestojn. Li sentis  sin tiel malfelicxa, ke li malbenis la tagon, en kiu li estis naskita.

LESSON 14.                                Re-, -ad-, ek-.    The prefixes \"re-\" and \"ek-\" and the suffix \"-ad-\" are attached to  verbs.    \"Re-\" has nearly the same meaning as in English, \"back\" or \"again\", as  \"re-pagi\", to pay back; \"re-porti\", to carry back; \"re-jxeti\", to throw  back; \"re-salti\", to rebound; \"re-kanti\" to sing again; \"re-legi\", to  read over again.    \"-ad-\" denotes the continuance or continued repetition of an action;  it means \"goes on doing\", or \"keeps on doing\", or \"is in the habit  of\", or in the past \"used to\", as \"spiri\", to breathe, \"spirado\",  respiration; \"movi\", to move, \"movado\", continued movement; \"fumi\", to  smoke, \"fumado\", the habit of smoking; \"auxdi\", to hear, \"auxdado\", the  sense of hearing.    \"Ek-\" has the opposite meaning to \"-ad-\"; it signifies the beginning of  an action, or a short or sudden action, as \"kanti\", to sing, \"ekkanti\",  to begin to sing; \"ridi\", to laugh, \"ekridi\", to burst out laughing;  \"krii\", to cry or call, \"ekkrii\", to cry out; \"iri\", to go, \"ekiri\", to  set out; \"dormi\", to sleep, \"ekdormi\", to fall asleep.                                  VOCABULARY.       rivero : river.                    fal- : fall.     lando : land.                      atend- : wait for, expect.     segxo : seat.                      lacig- : make tired.     dauxro : duration.                 frot- : rub.     okupo : occupation.                rigard- : look.     pluvo : rain.                      elrigard- : look out of.     vagonaro : train.                  salt- : jump.     surprizo : surprise.               rapida : quick.     diamanto : diamond.                klara : clear.     fulmo : lightning.                 lerte : cleverly.     lumo : a light.                    energie : energetically.     paf- : shoot.                      kelke : some.     jxet- : throw.                     cxiuminute : every minute. [p. 84]     auxd- : hear.                      tra : through.    Li donis al mi monon, sed mi gxin tuj redonis al li. Mi foriras, sed  atendu min, cxar mi baldaux revenos. La suno rebrilas en la klara akvo  de la rivero. Li reiris al sia lando. Sxi rejxetis sin sur la segxon.    En la dauxro de kelke da minutoj mi auxdis du pafojn. La pafado dauxris  tre longe. Lia hierauxa parolo estis tre bela, sed la tro multa parolado  lacigas lin. Li kantas tre belan kanton. La kantado estas agrabla  okupo. Per mia mano mi energie lin frotadis. La pluvo faladis per  riveroj. Cxiuminute sxi elrigardadis tra la fenestro, kaj malbenadis la  malrapidan iradon de la vagonaro.    Mi saltas tre lerte. Mi eksaltis de surprizo. Mi saltadis la tutan tagon  [Footnote: See Lesson 26 (iii.)] de loko al loko. Kiam vi ekparolis, mi  atendis auxdi ion novan. La diamanto havas belan brilon. Sxi lasis la  diamanton ekbrili. Du ekbriloj do fulmo trakuris tra la malluma cxielo.                                     LESSON 15.                               VERBS (continued).    In all the examples already given the Subject of the Sentence is the  \"doer\" of the action, but often it is \"the one to whom the action is  done\" who occupies our thoughts, and of whom we wish to speak. This one  then becomes the subject, and the form of the Verb is changed. Instead  of saying \"The police are "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8178"],[0,"The Politeness of Princes, and Other School Stories (#6)"],[1,"know,\" he concluded.    Linton's face beamed with astonishment and admiration.    \"Well, I'm hanged,\" he said. \"You're a marvel. But how did you know it  wouldn't poison you?\"    \"I relied on you. You said it wasn't poison when I asked you in the  lab. My faith in you is touching.\"    \"But why did you take any yourself?\"    \"Sort of idea of diverting suspicion. But the thing isn't finished  yet. Listen.\"    Linton left the dormitory five minutes later with a look of a young  disciple engaged on some holy mission.      PART 3    \"You think the food is unwholesome, then?\" said the headmaster after  dinner that night.    \"Unwholesome!\" said the school doctor. \"It must be deadly. It must be  positively lethal. Here we have six ordinary, strong, healthy boys  struck down at one fell swoop as if there were a pestilence raging.  Why----\"    \"One moment,\" said the headmaster. \"Come in.\"    A small figure appeared in the doorway.    \"Please, sir,\" said the figure in the strained voice of one speaking a  \"piece\" which he has committed to memory. \"Mr. Seymour says please  would you mind letting the doctor come to his house at once because  Linton is ill.\"    \"What!\" exclaimed the doctor. \"What's the matter with him?\"    \"Please, sir, I believe it's buckwheat cakes.\"    \"What! And here's another of them!\"    A second small figure had appeared in the doorway.    \"Sir, please, sir,\" said the newcomer, \"Mr. Bradfield says may the  doctor----\"    \"And what boy is it _this_ time?\"    \"Please, sir, it's Brown. He went to Ring's Stores----\"    The headmaster rose.    \"Perhaps you had better go at once, Oakes,\" he said. \"This is becoming  serious. That place is a positive menace to the community. I shall put  it out of bounds tomorrow morning.\"    And when Dunstable and Linton, pale but cheerful, made their way--slowly,  as befitted convalescents--to Cook's two days afterwards, they had to sit  on the counter. All the other seats were occupied.          THE GUARDIAN      In his Sunday suit (with ten shillings in specie in the right-hand  trouser pocket) and a brand-new bowler hat, the youngest of the  Shearnes, Thomas Beauchamp Algernon, was being launched by the  combined strength of the family on his public-school career. It was a  solemn moment. The landscape was dotted with relatives--here a small  sister, awed by the occasion into refraining from insult; there an  aunt, vaguely admonitory. \"Well, Tom,\" said Mr. Shearne, \"you'll soon  be off now. You're sure to like Eckleton. Remember to cultivate your  bowling. Everyone can bat nowadays. And play forward, not outside. The  outsides get most of the fun, certainly, but then if you're a forward,  you've got eight chances of getting into a team.\"    \"All right, father.\"    \"Oh, and work hard.\" This by way of an afterthought.    \"All right, father.\"    \"And, Tom,\" said Mrs. Shearne, \"you are sure to be comfortable at  school, because I asked Mrs. Davy to write to her sister, Mrs.  Spencer, who has a son at Eckleton, and tell her to tell him to look  after you when you get there. He is in Mr. Dencroft's house, which is  next door to Mr. Blackburn's, so you will be quite close to one  another. Mind you write directly you get there.\"    \"All right, mother.\"    \"And look here, Tom.\" His eldest brother stepped to the front and  spoke earnestly. \"Look here, don't you forget what I've been telling  you?\"    \"All right.\"    \"You'll be right enough if you don't go sticking on side. Don't forget  that, however much of a blood you may have been at that rotten little  private school of yours, you're not one at Eckleton.\"    \"All right.\"    \"You look clean, which is the great thing. There's nothing much wrong  with you except cheek. You've got enough of that to float a ship. Keep  it under.\"    \"All right. Keep your hair on.\"    \"There you go,\" said the expert, with gloomy triumph. \"If you say that  sort of thing at Eckleton, you'll get jolly well sat on, by Jove!\"    \"Bai Jove, old chap!\" murmured the younger brother, \"we're devils in  the Forty-twoth!\"    The other, whose chief sorrow in life was that he could not get the  smaller members of the family to look with proper awe on the fact that  he had just passed into Sandhurst, gazed wistfully at the speaker,  but, realising that there was a locked door between them, tried no  active measures.    \"Well, anyhow,\" he said, \"you'll soon get it knocked out of you,  that's one comfort. Look here, if you do get scrapping with anybody,  don't forget all I've taught you. And I should go on boxing there if I  were you, so as to go down to Aldershot some day. You ought to make a  fairly decent featherweight if you practise.\"    \"All right.\"    \"Let's know when Eckleton's playing Haileybury, and I'll come and look  you up. I want to see that match.\"    \"All right.\"    \"Good-bye.\"    \"Good-bye, Tom.\"    \"Good-bye, Tom, dear.\"    Chorus of aunts and other supers: \"Goodbye, Tom.\"    Tom (comprehensively): \"G'bye.\"    The train left the station.           *       *       *       *       *    Kennedy, the head of Dencroft's, said that when he wanted his study  turned into a beastly furnace, he would take care to let Spencer know.  He pointed out that just because it was his habit to warm the study  during the winter months, there was no reason why Spencer should light  the gas-stove on an afternoon in the summer term when the thermometer  was in the eighties. Spencer thought he might want some muffins cooked  for tea, did he? Kennedy earnestly advised Spencer to give up  thinking, as Nature had not equipped him for the strain. Thinking  necessitated mental effort, and Spencer, in Kennedy's opinion, had no  mind, but rubbed along on a cheap substitute of mud and putty.    More chatty remarks were exchanged, and then Spencer tore himself away  from the pleasant interview, and went downstairs to the junior study,  where he remarked to his friend Phipps that Life was getting a bit  thick.    \"What's up now?\" inquired Phipps.    \"Everything. We've just had a week of term, and I've been in extra  once already for doing practically nothing, and I've got a hundred  lines, and Kennedy's been slanging me for lighting the stove. How was  I to know he didn't want it lit? Wish I was fagging for somebody  else.\"    \"All the while you're jawing,\" said Phipps, \"there's a letter for you  on the mantelpiece, staring at you?\"    \"So there is. Hullo!\"    \"What's up? Hullo! is that a postal order? How much for?\"    \"Five bob. I say, who's Shearne?\"    \"New kid in Blackburn's. Why?\"    \"Great Scott! I remember now. They told me to look after him. I  haven't seen him yet. And listen to this: 'Mrs. Shearne has sent me  the enclosed to give to you. Her son writes to say that he is very  happy and getting on very well, so she is sure you must have been  looking after him.' Why, I don't know the kid by sight. I clean forgot  all about him.\"    \"Well, you'd better go and see him now, just to say you've done it.\"    Spencer perpended.    \"Beastly nuisance having a new kid hanging on to you. He's probably a  frightful rotter.\"    \"Well, anyway, you ought to,\" said Phipps, who possessed the  _scenario_ of a conscience.    \"I can't.\"    \"All right, don't, then. But you ought to send back that postal  order.\"    \"Look here, Phipps,\" said Spencer plaintively, \"you needn't be an  idiot, you know.\"    And the trivial matter of Thomas B. A. Shearne was shelved.           *       *       *       *       *    Thomas, as he had stated in his letter to his mother, was exceedingly  happy at Eckleton, and getting on very nicely indeed. It is true that  there had been one or two small unpleasantnesses at first, but those  were over now, and he had settled down completely. The little troubles  alluded to above had begun on his second day at Blackburn's. Thomas,  as the reader may have gathered from his glimpse of him at the station,  was not a diffident youth. He was quite prepared for anything Fate  might have up its sleeve for him, and he entered the junior day-room at  Blackburn's ready for emergencies. On the first day nothing happened.  One or two people asked him his name, but none inquired what his father  was--a question which, he had understood from books of school life, was  invariably put to the new boy. He was thus prevented from replying  \"coolly, with his eyes fixed on his questioner's\": \"A gentleman. What's  yours?\" and this, of course, had been a disappointment. But he reconciled  himself to it, and on the whole enjoyed his first day at Eckleton.    On the second there occurred an Episode.    Thomas had inherited from his mother a pleasant, rather meek cast of  countenance. He had pink cheeks and golden hair--almost indecently  golden in one who was not a choirboy.    Now, if you are going to look like a Ministering Child or a Little  Willie, the Sunbeam of the Home, when you go to a public school,  you must take the consequences. As Thomas sat by the window of the  junior day-room reading a magazine, and deeply interested in it,  there fell upon his face such a rapt, angelic expression that the  sight of it, silhouetted against the window, roused Master P. Burge,  his fellow-Blackburnite, as it had been a trumpet-blast. To seize a  Bradley Arnold's Latin Prose Exercises and hurl it across the room  was with Master Burge the work of a moment. It struck Thomas on the  ear. He jumped, and turned some shades pinker. Then he put down his  magazine, picked up the Bradley Arnold, and sat on it. After which he  resumed his magazine.    The acute interest of the junior day-room, always fond of a break in  the monotony of things, induced Burge to go further into the matter.    \"You with the face!\" said Burge rudely.    Thomas looked up.    \"What the dickens are you going with my book? Pass it back!\"    \"Oh, is this yours?\" said Thomas. \"Here you are.\"    He walked towards him, carrying the book. At two yards range he fired  it in. It hit Burge with some force in the waistcoat, and there"]]]
