Scythrop, tormented by the demon Jealousy, sat in  the corner biting his lips and fingers. Marionetta looked at him every  now and then with a smile of most provoking good humour, which he  pretended not to see, and which only the more exasperated his troubled  spirit. He took down a volume of Dante, and pretended to be deeply  interested in the Purgatorio, though he knew not a word he was  reading, as Marionetta was well aware; who, tripping across the room,  peeped into his book, and said to him, 'I see you are in the middle of  Purgatory.'--'I am in the middle of hell,' said Scythrop furiously.  'Are you?' said she; 'then come across the room, and I will sing you  the finale of Don Giovanni.'    'Let me alone,' said Scythrop. Marionetta looked at him with a  deprecating smile, and said, 'You unjust, cross creature, you.'--'Let  me alone,' said Scythrop, but much less emphatically than at first,  and by no means wishing to be taken at his word. Marionetta left him  immediately, and returning to the harp, said, just loud enough for  Scythrop to hear--'Did you ever read Dante, Mr Listless? Scythrop  is reading Dante, and is just now in Purgatory.'--'And I' said the  Honourable Mr Listless, 'am not reading Dante, and am just now in  Paradise,' bowing to Marionetta.      MARIONETTA    You are very gallant, Mr Listless; and I dare say you are very fond of  reading Dante.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    I don't know how it is, but Dante never came in my way till lately. I  never had him in my collection, and if I had had him I should not have  read him. But I find he is growing fashionable, and I am afraid I must  read him some wet morning.      MARIONETTA    No, read him some evening, by all means. Were you ever in love, Mr  Listless?      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    I assure you, Miss O'Carroll, never--till I came to Nightmare Abbey.  I dare say it is very pleasant; but it seems to give so much trouble  that I fear the exertion would be too much for me.      MARIONETTA    Shall I teach you a compendious method of courtship, that will give  you no trouble whatever?      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    You will confer on me an inexpressible obligation. I am all impatience  to learn it.      MARIONETTA    Sit with your back to the lady and read Dante; only be sure to begin  in the middle, and turn over three or four pages at once--backwards  as well as forwards, and she will immediately perceive that you are  desperately in love with her--desperately.      _(The Honourable Mr Listless sitting between Scythrop and Marionetta,  and fixing all his attention on the beautiful speaker, did not observe  Scythrop, who was doing as she described.)_      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    You are pleased to be facetious, Miss O'Carroll. The lady would  infallibly conclude that I was the greatest brute in town.      MARIONETTA    Far from it. She would say, perhaps, some people have odd methods of  showing their affection.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    But I should think, with submission--      MR FLOSKY (_joining them from another part of the room_)    Did I not hear Mr Listless observe that Dante is becoming fashionable?      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    I did hazard a remark to that effect, Mr Flosky, though I speak on  such subjects with a consciousness of my own nothingness, in the  presence of so great a man as Mr Flosky. I know not what is the colour  of Dante's devils, but as he is certainly becoming fashionable I  conclude they are blue; for the blue devils, as it seems to me, Mr  Flosky, constitute the fundamental feature of fashionable literature.      MR FLOSKY    The blue are, indeed, the staple commodity; but as they will not  always be commanded, the black, red, and grey may be admitted as  substitutes. Tea, late dinners, and the French Revolution, have played  the devil, Mr Listless, and brought the devil into play.      MR TOOBAD (_starting up_)    Having great wrath.      MR FLOSKY    This is no play upon words, but the sober sadness of veritable fact.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    Tea, late dinners, and the French Revolution. I cannot exactly see the  connection of ideas.      MR FLOSKY    I should be sorry if you could; I pity the man who can see the  connection of his own ideas. Still more do I pity him, the connection  of whose ideas any other person can see. Sir, the great evil is,  that there is too much common-place light in our moral and political  literature; and light is a great enemy to mystery, and mystery is a  great friend to enthusiasm. Now the enthusiasm for abstract truth is  an exceedingly fine thing, as long as the truth, which is the object  of the enthusiasm, is so completely abstract as to be altogether out  of the reach of the human faculties; and, in that sense, I have  myself an enthusiasm for truth, but in no other, for the pleasure of  metaphysical investigation lies in the means, not in the end; and if  the end could be found, the pleasure of the means would cease. The  mind, to be kept in health, must be kept in exercise. The proper  exercise of the mind is elaborate reasoning. Analytical reasoning is a  base and mechanical process, which takes to pieces and examines, bit  by bit, the rude material of knowledge, and extracts therefrom a few  hard and obstinate things called facts, every thing in the shape of  which I cordially hate. But synthetical reasoning, setting up as its  goal some unattainable abstraction, like an imaginary quantity in  algebra, and commencing its course with taking for granted some two  assertions which cannot be proved, from the union of these two assumed  truths produces a third assumption, and so on in infinite series, to  the unspeakable benefit of the human intellect. The beauty of this  process is, that at every step it strikes out into two branches, in  a compound ratio of ramification; so that you are perfectly sure of  losing your way, and keeping your mind in perfect health, by the  perpetual exercise of an interminable quest; and for these reasons I  have christened my eldest son Emanuel Kant Flosky.      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX    Nothing can be more luminous.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    And what has all that to do with Dante, and the blue devils?      MR HILARY    Not much, I should think, with Dante, but a great deal with the blue  devils.      MR FLOSKY    It is very certain, and much to be rejoiced at, that our literature is  hag-ridden. Tea has shattered our nerves; late dinners make us slaves  of indigestion; the French Revolution has made us shrink from the name  of philosophy, and has destroyed, in the more refined part of the  community (of which number I am one), all enthusiasm for political  liberty. That part of the _reading public_ which shuns the solid  food of reason for the light diet of fiction, requires a perpetual  adhibition of _sauce piquante_ to the palate of its depraved  imagination. It lived upon ghosts, goblins, and skeletons (I and my  friend Mr Sackbut served up a few of the best), till even the devil  himself, though magnified to the size of Mount Athos, became too base,  common, and popular, for its surfeited appetite. The ghosts have  therefore been laid, and the devil has been cast into outer darkness,  and now the delight of our spirits is to dwell on all the vices and  blackest passions of our nature, tricked out in a masquerade dress of  heroism and disappointed benevolence; the whole secret of which lies  in forming combinations that contradict all our experience, and  affixing the purple shred of some particular virtue to that precise  character, in which we should be most certain not to find it in the  living world; and making this single virtue not only redeem all the  real and manifest vices of the character, but make them actually  pass for necessary adjuncts, and indispensable accompaniments and  characteristics of the said virtue.      MR TOOBAD    That is, because the devil is come among us, and finds it for his  interest to destroy all our perceptions of the distinctions of right  and wrong.      MARIONETTA    I do not precisely enter into your meaning, Mr Flosky, and should be  glad if you would make it a little more plain to me.      MR FLOSKY    One or two examples will do it, Miss O'Carroll. If I were to take all  the mean and sordid qualities of a money-dealing Jew, and tack on to  them, as with a nail, the quality of extreme benevolence, I should  have a very decent hero for a modern novel; and should contribute my  quota to the fashionable method of administering a mass of vice, under  a thin and unnatural covering of virtue, like a spider wrapt in a  bit of gold leaf, and administered as a wholesome pill. On the same  principle, if a man knocks me down, and takes my purse and watch by  main force, I turn him to account, and set him forth in a tragedy as  a dashing young fellow, disinherited for his romantic generosity, and  full of a most amiable hatred of the world in general, and his own  country in particular, and of a most enlightened and chivalrous  affection for himself: then, with the addition of a wild girl to fall  in love with him, and a series of adventures in which they break all  the Ten Commandments in succession (always, you will observe, for some  sublime motive, which must be carefully analysed in its progress), I  have as amiable a pair of tragic characters as ever issued from that  new region of the belles lettres, which I have called the Morbid  Anatomy of Black Bile, and which is greatly to be admired and rejoiced  at, as affording a fine scope for the exhibition of mental power.      MR HILARY    Which is about as well employed as the power of a hothouse would be in  forcing up a nettle to the size of an elm. If we go on in this way, we  shall have a new art of poetry, of which one of the first rules will  be: To remember to forget"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9914"],[0,"The Babylonian Legends of the Creation (#6)"],[1,"much the same  way as the editor of the Gilgamish Legends included an account of the  Deluge in his narrative of the exploits of his hero. All forms of the  Legend of the Creation and of the Dragon were popular in Babylonia, and  one of them achieved so much notoriety that the priest employed recited  it as an incantation to charm away the toothache.    [Footnote 1: See Poebel, _Historical Texts_, No. 1.]    [Footnote 2: See King, _Cuneiform Texts_, Part XIII, Plate 33;  and Ebellog, _Assurtexte_, I, No. 6.]    [Footnote 3: The _biru_ was the distance which a man would travel  in two hours.]    The literary form of the text of the Seven Tablets fulfils the  requirements of Semitic poetry in general. The lines usually fall into  couplets, the second line being the antiphon of the first, e.g.:--      \"When in the height heaven was not named,      And the earth beneath did not yet bear a name.\"    Each line, or verse, falls into two halves, and a well-marked caesura  divides each line, or verse, into two equally accented parts. And the  half-lines can be further resolved into two halves, each containing a  single accented word or phrase. This is proved by tablet Spartali ii,  265A, where the scribe writes his lines and spaces the words in such a  way as to show the subdivision of the lines. Thus we have:--      _enuma_   | _elish_  || _la nabu_| _shamamu_    _shaplish_| _ammatum_|| _shuma_  | _la zakrat_    Here there is clearly a rhythm which resembles that found in the poems  of the Syrians and Arabs, but there are many instances of its  inconsistent use in several parts of the text.  Both rhyme and  alliteration appear to be used occasionally.          THE SEVEN TABLETS OF CREATION.--TRANSLATION.        FIRST TABLET.[1]    [Footnote 1: This translation is made from transcripts of the British  Museum fragments (_Cuneiform Texts_, Part XIII), and transcripts  of the Berlin fragments (Ebeling, _Keilschrifttexte aus Assur_,  Nos. 117, 118).]    1. When the heavens above were yet unnamed,[1]    [Footnote 1: The name of an object was the object itself, and it was  believed that nothing could exist apart from its name.]    2. And the name of the earth beneath had not been recorded,    3. Apsu, the oldest of beings, their progenitor,    4. \"Mummu\" Tiamat, who bare each and all of them--    5. Their waters were merged into a single mass.    6. A field had not been measured, a marsh had not been searched out,    7. When of the gods none was shining,    [Illustration: Portion of a tablet inscribed in Assyrian with a text  of the First Tablet of the Creation Series. [K. 5419C.]]    8. A name had not been recorded, a fate had not been fixed,    9. The gods came into being in the midst of them.    10. The god Lakhmu and the goddess Lakhamu were made to shine, they  were named.    11. [Together] they increased in stature, they grew tall.    12. Anshar and Kishar came into being, and others besides them.    13. Long were the days, the years increased.    14. The god Anu, their son, the equal of his fathers, [was created].    15. The god Anshar made his eldest son Anu in his own image.    16. And the god Anu begat Nudimmud (Ea) the image of himself.    17. The god Nudimmud was the first among his fathers,    18. Endowed with understanding, he who thinketh deeply, the orator    19. Exceedingly mighty in strength above his father Anshar who begat  him.    20. Unrivalled amongst the gods his brothers ...    21. The confraternity of the gods was established.    22. Tiamat was troubled and she ... their guardian.    23. Her belly was stirred up to its uttermost depths.    24. ...........    25. Apsu (the watery abyss) could not diminish their brawl    26. And Tiamat gathered herself together ...    27. She struck a blow, and their works ...    28. Their way was not good,...    29. At that time Apsu, the progenitor of the great gods,    30. Shouted out and summoned Mummu, the steward of his house, saying    31. \"[O] Mummu, my steward, who makest my liver to rejoice,    32. \"Come, to Tiamat we will go.\"    33. They went, they lay down [on a couch] facing Tiamat.    34. They took counsel together about the gods [their children].    35. Apsu took up his word and said,    36. To Tiamat, the holy (?) one, he made mention of a matter,  [saying],    37. \"... their way ...    38. \"By day I find no peace, by night I have no rest.    39. \"Verily I will make an end of their way, I will sweep them away,    40. \"There shall be a sound of lamentation; lo, then we shall rest.\"    41. Tiamat on hearing this    42. Was stirred up to wrath and shrieked to her husband,[1]    [Footnote 1: Tiamat's wrath was roused by Apsu, who had proposed to slay  the gods, her children. She took no part in the first struggle of Apsu  and Mummu against the gods, and only engaged in active hostilities to  avenge Apsu.]    43. ... unto sickness. She raged all alone,    44. She uttered a curse, and unto [Apsu, spake, saying,],    45. \"Whatsoever we have made we will destroy.    46. \"Verily their way shall be filled with disaster; lo, then we shall  rest.\"    47. Mummu answered and gave counsel unto Apsu,    48. The counsel of Mummu was ... and dire [in respect of the gods]:    49. \"Come, [do thou destroy] their way which is strong.    50. \"Then verily by day thou shalt find peace, [and] by night thou  shalt have rest.\"    51. Apsu heard him, his face grew bright,    52. For that they were planning evil against the gods, his children.    53. Mummu embraced his neck ...    54. He took him on his knee, he kissed him ...    55. They (i.e. Mummu and Apsu) planned the cursing in the  assembly,    56. They repeated the curses to the gods their eldest sons.    57. The gods made answer ...    58. They began a lamentation...    59. [Endowed] with understanding, the prudent god, the exalted one,    60. Ea, who pondereth everything that is, searched out their [plan].    61. He brought it to nought (?), he made the form of everything to  stand still.    62. He recited a cunning incantation, very powerful and holy.    [In the British Museum tablets lines 63-108 are either wanting  entirely, or are too broken to translate, and the last 130 lines of  the Berlin fragment are much mutilated. The fragments of text show  that Ea waged war against Apsu and Mummu. Ea recited an incantation  which caused Apsu to fall asleep. He then \"loosed the joints\" of  Mummu, who in some way suffered, but he was strong enough to attack Ea  when he turned to deal with Apsu. Ea overcame both his adversaries and  divided Apsu into chambers and laid fetters upon him.  In one of the  chambers of Apsu a god was begotten and born.  According to the  Ninevite theologians Ea begat by his wife, who is not named, his son  Marduk, and according to the theologians of the City of Ashur, Lakhmu  begat by his wife Lakhamu a son who is no other than Anshar, or  Ashur. A nurse was appointed to rear him, and he grew up a handsome  child, to the great delight of his father. He had four ears and four  eyes, a statement which suggests that he was two-headed, and resembled  the Latin god Janus.]    109. They formed a band, and went forth to battle to help Tiamat.    110. They were exceedingly wroth, they made plots by day and by night  without ceasing.    111. They offered battle, fuming and raging.    112. They set the battle in array, they uttered cries[1] of hostility,    [Footnote 1: Literally, \"they excited themselves to hostility.\"]    113. Ummu-Khubur,[1] who fashioned all things,    [Footnote 1: A title of Tiamat.]    114. Set up the unrivalled weapon, she spawned huge serpents,    115. Sharp of tooth, pitiless in attack (?)    116. She filled their bodies with venom instead of blood,    117. Grim, monstrous serpents, arrayed in terror,    118. She decked them with brightness, she fashioned them in exalted  forms,    119. So that fright and horror might overcome him that looked upon  them,    120. So that their bodies might rear up, and no man resist their  attack,    121. She set up the Viper, and the Snake, and the god Lakhamu,    122. The Whirlwind, the ravening Dog, the Scorpion-man,    123. The mighty Storm-wind, the Fish-man, the horned Beast  (Capricorn?)    124. They carried the Weapon[1] which spared not, nor flinched from  the battle.    [Footnote 1: These nine monsters with the Weapon (Thunderbolt?) and  Kingu form the Eleven Allies of Tiamat, and it is clear that she and  her Allies represent the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. When Marduk  destroyed Tiamat and her associates, he found it necessary to fix the  stars, the images of the great gods, in their places, as the Twelve  Signs of the Zodiac. (See the Fifth Tablet of Creation, p. 55.)]    125. Most mighty were Tiamat's decrees, they could not be resisted,    126. Thus she caused eleven [monsters] of this kind to come into  being,    127. Among the gods, her first-born son who had collected her company,    128. That is to say, Kingu, she set on high, she made him the great  one amongst them,    129. Leader of the hosts in battle, disposer of the troops,    130. Bearer of the firmly grasped weapon, attacker in the fight,    131. He who in the battle is the master of the weapon,    132. She appointed, she made him to sit down in [goodly apparel]    133. [Saying], \"I have uttered the incantation for thee. I have  magnified thee in the assembly of the gods.    134. \"I have filled his [_sic_, read 'thy'] hand with the  sovereignty of the whole company of the gods.    135. \"Mayest thou be magnified, thou who art my only spouse,    136. \"May the Anunnaki make great thy renown over all of them.\"    137. She gave him the TABLET OF DESTINIES, she fastened it on his  breast, [saying],    138. \"As for thee, thy command shall not fall empty, whatsoever goeth  forth from thy mouth shall be established.\"    139.
