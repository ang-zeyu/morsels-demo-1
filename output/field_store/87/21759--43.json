Drop me a line if he comes, and I'll get on to his record.'    I saw Tam off in the boat with a fairly satisfied mind.  I was going to  a place with a secret, and I meant to find it out.  The natives round  Blaauwildebeestefontein were queer, and diamonds were suspected  somewhere in the neighbourhood.    Henriques had something to do with the place, and so had the Rev. John  Laputa, about whom I knew one strange thing.  So did Tam by the way,  but he had not identified his former pursuer, and I had told him  nothing.  I was leaving two men behind me, Colles at Durban and Aitken  at Lourenco Marques, who would help me if trouble came.  Things were  shaping well for some kind of adventure.    The talk with Aitken had given Tam an inkling of my thoughts.  His last  words to me were an appeal to let him know if there was any fun going.    'I can see you're in for a queer job.  Promise to let me hear from you  if there's going to be a row, and I'll come up country, though I should  have to desert the service.  Send us a letter to the agents at Durban  in case we should be in port.  You haven't forgotten the Dyve Burn,  Davie?'        CHAPTER III    BLAAUWILDEBEESTEFONTEIN    The Pilgrim's Progress had been the Sabbath reading of my boyhood, and  as I came in sight of Blaauwildebeestefontein a passage ran in my head.  It was that which tells how Christian and Hopeful, after many perils of  the way, came to the Delectable Mountains, from which they had a  prospect of Canaan.  After many dusty miles by rail, and a weariful  journey in a Cape-cart through arid plains and dry and stony gorges, I  had come suddenly into a haven of green.  The Spring of the Blue  Wildebeeste was a clear rushing mountain torrent, which swirled over  blue rocks into deep fern-fringed pools.  All around was a tableland of  lush grass with marigolds and arum lilies instead of daisies and  buttercups.  Thickets of tall trees dotted the hill slopes and patched  the meadows as if some landscape-gardener had been at work on them.  Beyond, the glen fell steeply to the plains, which ran out in a faint  haze to the horizon.  To north and south I marked the sweep of the  Berg, now rising high to a rocky peak and now stretching in a level  rampart of blue.  On the very edge of the plateau where the road dipped  for the descent stood the shanties of Blaauwildebeestefontein. The  fresh hill air had exhilarated my mind, and the aromatic scent of the  evening gave the last touch of intoxication.  Whatever serpent might  lurk in it, it was a veritable Eden I had come to.    Blaauwildebeestefontein had no more than two buildings of civilized  shape; the store, which stood on the left side of the river, and the  schoolhouse opposite.  For the rest, there were some twenty native  huts, higher up the slope, of the type which the Dutch call _rondavels_.  The schoolhouse had a pretty garden, but the store stood bare in a  patch of dust with a few outhouses and sheds beside it.  Round the door  lay a few old ploughs and empty barrels, and beneath a solitary blue  gum was a wooden bench with a rough table.  Native children played in  the dust, and an old Kaffir squatted by the wall.    My few belongings were soon lifted from the Cape-cart, and I entered  the shop.  It was the ordinary pattern of up-country store--a bar in  one corner with an array of bottles, and all round the walls tins of  canned food and the odds and ends of trade.  The place was empty, and a  cloud of flies buzzed over the sugar cask.    Two doors opened at the back, and I chose the one to the right.  I  found myself in a kind of kitchen with a bed in one corner, and a  litter of dirty plates on the table.  On the bed lay a man, snoring  heavily.  I went close to him, and found an old fellow with a bald  head, clothed only in a shirt and trousers. His face was red and  swollen, and his breath came in heavy grunts.  A smell of bad whisky  hung over everything.  I had no doubt that this was Mr Peter Japp, my  senior in the store.  One reason for the indifferent trade at  Blaauwildebeestefontein was very clear to me: the storekeeper was a sot.    I went back to the shop and tried the other door.  It was a bedroom  too, but clean and pleasant.  A little native girl--Zeeta, I found they  called her--was busy tidying it up, and when I entered she dropped me a  curtsy.  'This is your room, Baas,' she said in very good English in  reply to my question. The child had been well trained somewhere, for  there was a cracked dish full of oleander blossom on the drawers'-head,  and the pillow-slips on the bed were as clean as I could wish. She  brought me water to wash, and a cup of strong tea, while I carried my  baggage indoors and paid the driver of the cart. Then, having cleaned  myself and lit a pipe, I walked across the road to see Mr Wardlaw.    I found the schoolmaster sitting under his own fig-tree reading one of  his Kaffir primers.  Having come direct by rail from Cape Town, he had  been a week in the place, and ranked as the second oldest white  resident.    'Yon's a bonny chief you've got, Davie,' were his first words. 'For  three days he's been as fou as the Baltic.'    I cannot pretend that the misdeeds of Mr Japp greatly annoyed me.  I  had the reversion of his job, and if he chose to play the fool it was  all in my interest.  But the schoolmaster was depressed at the prospect  of such company.  'Besides you and me, he's the only white man in the  place.  It's a poor look-out on the social side.'    The school, it appeared, was the merest farce.  There were only five  white children, belonging to Dutch farmers in the mountains.  The  native side was more flourishing, but the mission schools at the  locations got most of the native children in the neighbourhood.  Mr  Wardlaw's educational zeal ran high.  He talked of establishing a  workshop and teaching carpentry and blacksmith's work, of which he knew  nothing. He rhapsodized over the intelligence of his pupils and  bemoaned his inadequate gift of tongues.  'You and I, Davie,' he said,  'must sit down and grind at the business.  It is to the interest of  both of us.  The Dutch is easy enough.  It's a sort of kitchen dialect  you can learn in a fortnight.  But these native languages are a stiff  job.  Sesuto is the chief hereabouts, and I'm told once you've got that  it's easy to get the Zulu.  Then there's the thing the Shangaans  speak--Baronga, I think they call it.  I've got a Christian Kaffir  living up in one of the huts who comes every morning to talk to me for  an hour.  You'd better join me.'    I promised, and in the sweet-smelling dust crossed the road to the  store.  Japp was still sleeping, so I got a bowl of mealie porridge  from Zeeta and went to bed.      Japp was sober next morning and made me some kind of apology.  He had  chronic lumbago, he said, and 'to go on the bust' now and then was the  best cure for it.  Then he proceeded to initiate me into my duties in a  tone of exaggerated friendliness. 'I took a fancy to you the first time  I clapped eyes on you,' he said.  'You and me will be good friends,  Crawfurd, I can see that.  You're a spirited young fellow, and you'll  stand no nonsense.  The Dutch about here are a slim lot, and the  Kaffirs are slimmer.  Trust no man, that's my motto.  The firm know  that, and I've had their confidence for forty years.'    The first day or two things went well enough.  There was no doubt that,  properly handled, a fine trade could be done in  Blaauwildebeestefontein.  The countryside was crawling with natives,  and great strings used to come through from Shangaan territory on the  way to the Rand mines.  Besides, there was business to be done with the  Dutch farmers, especially with the tobacco, which I foresaw could be  worked up into a profitable export.  There was no lack of money either,  and we had to give very little credit, though it was often asked for.  I flung myself into the work, and in a few weeks had been all round the  farms and locations.  At first Japp praised my energy, for it left him  plenty of leisure to sit indoors and drink.  But soon he grew  suspicious, for he must have seen that I was in a fair way to oust him  altogether.  He was very anxious to know if I had seen Colles in  Durban, and what the manager had said.  'I have letters,' he told me a  hundred times, 'from Mr Mackenzie himself praising me up to the skies.  The firm couldn't get along without old Peter Japp, I can tell you.'  I  had no wish to quarrel with the old man, so I listened politely to all  he said.  But this did not propitiate him, and I soon found him so  jealous as to be a nuisance.  He was Colonial-born and was always  airing the fact.  He rejoiced in my rawness, and when I made a blunder  would crow over it for hours.  'It's no good, Mr Crawfurd; you new  chums from England may think yourselves mighty clever, but we men from  the Old Colony can get ahead of you every time.  In fifty years you'll  maybe learn a little about the country, but we know all about it before  we start.'  He roared with laughter at my way of tying a _voorslag_, and  he made merry (no doubt with reason) on my management of a horse.  I  kept my temper pretty well, but I own there were moments when I came  near to kicking Mr Japp.    The truth is he was a disgusting old ruffian.  His character was shown  by his treatment of Zeeta.  The poor child slaved all day and did two  men's work in keeping the household going. She was an orphan from a  mission station, and in Japp's opinion a creature without rights.  Hence he never spoke to her except with a curse, and used to cuff her  thin shoulders till my blood boiled.  One day things became too much  for my temper. Zeeta had spilled half a glass of Japp's whisky while  tidying up the room.

Now this ain't the case in a steamer. They  ain't vessels, they are more like floating factories; you see the  steam machines and the enormous fires, and the clouds of smoke, but  you don't visit the rooms where the looms are, that's all. They plough  through the sea dead and heavy, like a subsoiler with its eight-horse  team; there is no life in 'em; they can't dance on the waters as if  they rejoiced in their course, but divide the waves as a rock does in  a river; they seem to move more in defiance of the sea than as if they  were in an element of their own.    \"They puff and blow like boasters braggin' that they extract from the  ocean the means to make it help to subdue itself. It is a war in the  elements, fire and water contendin' for victory. They are black,  dingy, forbiddin' looking sea monsters. It is no wonder the  superstitious Spaniard, when he first saw one, said: 'A vessel that  goes against the tide, and against the wind, and without sails, goes  against God,' or that the simple negro thought it was a sea-devil.  They are very well for carrying freight, because they are beasts of  burden, but not for carrying travellers, unless they are mere birds of  passage like our Yankee tourists, who want to have it to say I was  'thar.' I hate them. The decks are dirty; your skin and clothes are  dirty; and your lungs become foul; smoke pervades everythin', and now  and then the condensation gives you a shower of sooty water by way of  variety, that scalds your face and dyes your coat into a sort of  pepper-and-salt colour.    \"You miss the sailors, too. There are none on board--you miss the nice  light, tight-built, lathy, wiry, active, neat, jolly crew. In their  place you have nasty, dirty, horrid stokers; some hoisting hot cinders  and throwing them overboard (not with the merry countenances of  niggers, or the cheerful sway-away-my-boys expression of the Jack Tar,  but with sour, cameronean-lookin' faces, that seem as if they were  dreadfully disappointed they were not persecuted any longer--had no  churches and altars to desecrate, and no bishops to anoint with the  oil of hill-side maledictions as of old), while others are emerging  from the fiery furnaces beneath for fresh air, and wipe a hot dirty  face with a still dirtier shirt sleeve, and in return for the nauseous  exudation, lay on a fresh coat of blacking; tall, gaunt wretches, who  pant for breath as they snuff the fresh breeze, like porpouses, and  then dive again into the lower regions. They are neither seamen nor  landsmen, good whips nor decent shots, their hair is not woolly enough  for niggers, and their faces are too black for white men. They ain't  amphibious animals, like marines and otters. They are Salamanders. But  that's a long word, and now they call them stokers for shortness.    \"Then steamers carry a mob, and I detest mobs, especially such ones as  they delight in--greasy Jews, hairy Germans, Mulatto-looking Italians,  squalling children, that run between your legs and throw you down, or  wipe the butter off their bread on your clothes; Englishmen that will  grumble, and Irishmen that will fight; priests that won't talk, and  preachers that will harangue; women that will be carried about,  because they won't lie still and be quiet; silk men, cotten men,  bonnet men, iron men, trinket men, and every sort of shopmen, who  severally know nothing in the world but silk, cotten, bonnets, iron,  trinkets, and so on, and can't talk of anythin' else; fellows who walk  up and down the deck, four or five abreast when there are four or five  of the same craft on board, and prevent any one else from promenadin'  by sweepin' the whole space, while every lurch the ship gives, one of  them tumbles atop of you, or treads on your toes, and then, instead of  apoligisin', turns round and abuses you like a pick-pocket for  stickin' your feet out and trippin' people up. Thinkin' is out of the  question, and as for readin', you might as well read your fortune in  the stars.    \"Just as you begin, that lovely-lookin', rosy-cheeked, wicked-eyed  gall, that came on board so full of health and spirits, but now looks  like a faded striped ribbon, white, yeller, pink, and brown--dappled  all over her face, but her nose, which has a red spot on it--lifts up  a pair of lack-lustre peepers that look glazed like the round dull  ground-glass lights let into the deck, suddenly wakes up squeamish,  and says, 'Please, Sir, help me down; I feel so ill.' Well, you take  her up in your arms, and for the first time in your life hold her head  from you, for fear she will reward you in a way that ain't no matter,  and she feels as soft as dough, and it seems as if your fingers left  dents in her putty-like arms, and you carry her to the head of the  stairs, and call out for the stewardess, and a waiter answers,  'Stewardess is tight, Sir.'    \"'I am glad of it, she is just the person I want. I wish all the other  passengers were tight also.'    \"'Lord, Sir, that ain't it--she is mops and brooms.'    \"'Mops and brooms, I suppose she is, she must have plenty use for  them, I reckon, to keep all snug and tidy down there.'    \"'Good gracious, Sir, don't you understand, she is half seas over.'    \"'True, so we all are, the captain said so to-day at twelve o'clock, I  wish we were over altogether. Send her up.'    \"'No, no, Sir, she is more than half shaved.'    \"'The devil! does she shave? I don't believe she is a woman at all. I  see how it is, you have been putting one of the sailors into  petticoats.' And the idea makes even the invalid gall laugh.    \"'No, no, Sir, she is tipsy.'    \"'Then why the plague couldn't you say so at once. I guess you kinder  pride yourself in your slang. Help me to assist this lady down to her  friends.'    \"Well, when you return on deck, lo and behold, your seat is occupied,  and you must go and stand by the rail till one is vacant, when another  gall that ain't ill, but inconveniently well, she is so full of chat,  says, 'Look, look, Sir, dear me, what is that, Sir? a porpoise. Why  you don't, did you ever! well, I never see a porpoise afore in all my  born days! are they good to eat, Sir?'    \"'Excellent food for whales, Miss.'    \"'Well I never! do they swallow them right down?'    \"'I guess they do, tank, shank, and flank, at one gulp.'    \"'Why how in the world do they ever get--' but she don't finish the  sentence, for the silk man, cotten man, iron man, or trinket man,  which ever is nearest, says, 'There is a ship on the lee-bow.' He says  that because it sounds sailor-like, but it happens to be the  weather-bow, and you have seen her an hour before.    \"'Can you make her out?' sais he; that's another sea tarm he has  picked up; he will talk like a horse-marine at last.    \"'Yes,' sais you, 'she is a Quang-Tonger.'    \"'A Quang-Tonger?' sais the gall, and before the old coon has  disgested that hard word, she asks, 'what in natur is that?'    \"'Why, Miss, Quang-Tong is a province of China, and Canton is the  capital; all the vessels at Canton are called Quang-Tongers, but  strangers call them Chinese Junks. Now, Miss, you have seen two new  things to-day, a bottle-nosed porpoise and--'    \"'Was that a bottle-nosed porpoise, Sir? why you don't say so! why,  how you talk, why do they call them bottle-noses?'    \"'Because, Miss, they make what is called velvet corks out of their  snouts. They are reckoned the best corks in the world. And then, you  have seen a Chinese Junk?'    \"'A Chinese Junk,' sais the astonished trinket man. 'Well I vow! a  Chinese Junk, do tell!' and one gall calls Jeremiah Dodge, and the  other her father and her sister, Mary Anne Matilda Jane, to come and  see the Chinese Junk, and all the passengers rush to the other side,  and say, 'whare, whare,' and the two discoverers say, 'there, there;'  and you walk across the deck and take one of the evacuated seats you  have been longin' for; and as you pass you give a wink to the officer  of the watch, who puts his tongue in his cheek as a token of  approbation, and you begin to read again, as you fancy, in peace.    \"But there is no peace in a steamer, it is nothin' but a large  calaboose,1 chock full of prisoners. As soon as you have found your  place in the book, and taken a fresh departure, the bonnet man sais,  'Please, Sir, a seat for a lady,' and you have to get up and give it  to his wife's lady's-maid. His wife ain't a lady, but having a  lady's-maid shows she intends to set up for one when she gets to home.  To be a lady, she must lay in a lot of airs, and to brush her own hair  and garter her own stockins is vulgar; if it was known in First  Avenue, Spruce Street, in Bonnetville, it would ruin her as a woman of  fashion for ever.      1 Calaboose is a Southern name for jail.      \"Now bonnet man wouldn't ask you to get up and give your place to his  wife's hired help, only he knows you are a Yankee, and we Yankees, I  must say, are regularly fooled with women and preachers; just as much  as that walking advertisement of a milliner is with her lady's-maid.
