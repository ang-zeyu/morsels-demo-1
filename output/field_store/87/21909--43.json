[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9943"],[0,"Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia, in Search of a (#6)"],[1,"map of Eastern Australia--INFRA.] The Darling is peopled more permanently  by these natives, than perhaps any other part of Australia: affording as  it does a more certain supply of food. It is only in seasons of very high  flood that this food, the fish, cannot be got at, and that they are  obliged to resort to the higher country at such seasons, between the  Darling, the Lachlan, and the Bogan. It also happens that the cattle of  the squatter are most accessible from the soft state of the ground; the  stockmen cannot even ride to protect them. The tribes from the Lachlan  and Macquarie meet on these higher lands, and when tribes assemble they  are generally ready for any mischief. The Bogan is particularly within  their reach, and when wet seasons do occur the cattle of squatters must  be very much at the mercy of the savages. The tribes from the Darling are  extremely hostile, even to the more peaceably disposed hilltribes near  the colony, and several stations have already been abandoned in  consequence of the outrages of the aborigines from the Darling and  Lachlan. Nothing is so likely to increase these evils as the precarious  or temporary occupation of such a country. The supply of water must  continue uncertain so long as there is no inducement from actual  possession to form dams, and by means of art to secure the full benefit  of the natural supply. Hence it is that half a million of acres, covered  with the finest grass, have been abandoned, and even savages smile at the  want of generalship by which they have been allowed to burn the white  man's dairy station and stockyards on the banks of the Bogan. The  establishment of a police station near the junction of the Bogan with the  Darling, or the formation of an inland township about Fort Bourke, had  been sufficient to have secured the stations along the Bogan and  Macquarie, and to have protected the Bogan natives as well as our own  countrymen from frequent robbery, murder, and insult. Such are the  results where SQUATTING has been permitted to supersede settling. With  possession, deficiency of water in dry seasons had been remedied, and no  such debateable land had remained on the borders of a British colony.    The part of the Bogan where least water can be found, has always been  that between our present camp and Muda, a very large lagoon about 50  miles lower down. I found by the barometer that there is a fall of 206  feet in that distance of 50 miles; whereas the fall in the bed of the  Bogan is only 50 feet between Muda and New Year's Range, in a distance of  upwards of 100 miles. The general course of the Bogan changes at Muda  from N.W. to north, the former being nearly in the direction of the  general declination of the country, the latter rather across it, of which  the overflowings of the parallel river Macquarie into Duck Creek, and  other channels to the westward, seemed to afford sufficient proofs. Where  the declination is least, the water is most likely to remain in ponds in  the channel of the river after floods, the water of which can neither  flow with so much velocity, nor bear down any of the obstructions by  which ponds are formed. Mr. Dixon found the velocity of the Bogan at this  part, during a flood in 1833, to be four miles in an hour; which is about  double the average rate of the larger rivers of Australia.    I had an order from Mr. Kerr, the proprietor of this station of  Derribong, to his superintendant, for such fat cattle as I might require  to take with me as live stock. Finding that the sheep answered very well,  having lost none, and that they rather improved in travelling, whereas  the working oxen had been much jaded and impoverished by the long  journey, heavy loads, and warm weather; I determined to take as many  young bullocks as might suffice to relieve and assist the others, and  break them in as we proceeded.    30TH DECEMBER.--The wind changed to S.E., and brought a cool morning.  Thermometer, 68 deg.. This day we selected from the herds of Mr. Kerr 32  young bullocks, and they were immediately yoked up in the stockyard.    Received letters from Sydney, by Corporal Graham.    31ST DECEMBER, 1845.--Thermometer at 5 A. M., 62 deg.: at noon, 109 deg.. Wind  S.E. At noon a whirlwind passed over the camp, fortunately avoiding the  tents in its course; but it carried a heavy tarpaulin into the air, also  some of the men's hats, and broke a half-hour sand-glass, much wanted for  the men on watch at night. The sky overcast from the west in the evening.    1ST JANUARY, 1846.--A strong wind from N.E. blew during the day, and was  very high at 11 A. M. The party were chiefly employed breaking in the  young bullocks. At noon, nimbus, and some rain, tantalised us with the  hope of a change; but the sky drew up into clouds of cumulus by the  evening. The vegetation of the Bogan now recalled former labours: the  ATRIPLEX SEMIBACCATA of Brown was a common straggling plant.    2D JANUARY.--The young cattle still occasioned delay. The morning was  cloudy and promised rain; but a N.W. wind broke through the clouds, which  resolved themselves into cirrostratus, and we had heat again. Besides the  SALSOLA AUSTRALIS, we found a HALGANIA with lilac flowers, probably  distinct from the species hitherto described, which are natives of the  south-west coast.    3D JANUARY.--This morning the young cattle were yoked up with the old;  and, after considerable delay, the party proceeded to some ponds in the  Bogan about five miles lower down. We were now nearly opposite to the  scene of Mr. Cunningham's disasters: I had recognised, amongst the first  hills I saw when on the Goobang Creek, the hill which I had named Mount  Juson, at his request, after the maiden name of his mother. The little  pyramid of bushes was no longer there, but the name of Cunningham was so  identified with the botanical history of almost all the shrubs in the  very peculiar scenery of that part of the country, that no other monument  seemed necessary. Other recollections recalled Cunningham to my mind; his  barbarous murder, and the uncertainty which still hung over the actual  circumstances attending it. The shrubs told indeed of Cunningham; of both  brothers, both now dead; but neither the shrubs named by the one, nor the  gloomy CASUARINOE trees that had witnessed the bloody deed, could tell  more. There the ACACIA PENDULA, first discovered and described by Allan,  could only    \"Like a weeping mourner stooping stand, For ever silent, and for ever  sad.\"    4TH JANUARY.--The early cooler part of the morning was taken up with the  young cattle. It was now but too obvious that this means of conveyance  was likely to retard the journey to an extent that no pecuniary saving  would compensate, as compared with light carts and horses. I proceeded  forward in search of a deserted stockyard, called Tabbaratong, where some  water was said still to remain. We found some mud and water only;  although some that was excellent was found about two miles lower down the  Bogan, late in the evening.    We had crossed the neutral ground between the savage and the squatter.  The advanced posts of an army are not better kept, and humiliating proofs  that the white man had given way, were visible in the remains of dairies  burnt down, stockyards in ruins, untrodden roads. We hoped to find within  the territory of the native, ponds of clear water, unsoiled by cattle,  and a surface on which we might track our own stray animals, without  their being confused by the traces of others.    5TH JANUARY.--Three of the young cattle having escaped during the night,  retarded us in the morning until 8 o'clock, at which hour they were  brought into the camp, having been tracked by Yuranigh, a most useful  native who had come with us from Buree. I proceeded with the light carts,  guided by a very young native boy, not more than ten years old, who had  come with the party from Kerr's station, and who, being a native of the  lower Bogan, could tell us where water was likely to be found. Our route  was rather circuitous, chiefly to avoid a thick scrub of CALLITRIS and  other trees, which, having been recently burnt, presented spikes so  thickly set together, that any way round them seemed preferable to going  through. We reached plains, and came upon an old track of the squatters.  The grass in parts was green and rich. I could see no traces of my former  route, but we arrived at length at an open spot which Dicky, the young  native, said was \"Cadduldury.\" Leaving Dr. Stephenson with the people  driving the light carts there, I proceeded towards the bed of the Bogan,  which was near, to see what water was there, and following the channel  downwards, I met with none. Still I rode on, accompanied by Piper (also  on horseback), and the dryness of the bed had forbidden further search,  but that I remembered the large ponds we had formerly seen at Bugabada  and Muda, which could not be far distant. But it was only after threading  the windings of the Bogan, in a ride of at least twelve miles, that we  arrived at the most eastern of the Bugabada ponds. The water was however  excellent, purer indeed than any we had seen for many days, and we  hastened back to the party at Cadduldury, which place we only arrived at  as darkness came on, so that Piper had nearly lost his way. The drays  with Mr. Kennedy had not come up, and I sent William Baldock and Yuranigh  back in haste to inform him that I was encamped without water, and that I  wished him, if still EN ROUTE, immediately to unyoke the cattle, encamp  on a grassy spot, and have them watched in their yokes during the night,  and to come forward at earliest dawn to the water-holes I had found near  Bugabada. We passed a miserable night without water at Cadduldury.    6TH JANUARY.--William Baldock returned at daybreak, bringing a message  from Mr. Kennedy, saying he should do as I had requested. I went forward  with the light party, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9963"],[0,"Elsie's Girlhood (#6)"],[1,"the future.    At length they reached the rustic seat where they had sat while Mr.  Dinsmore told his story, and he inquired of Rose if she would like to  stop and rest.    She assented, recognizing the place with a smile and a blush, and they  sat down.    \"Papa,\" said Elsie, \"I am not tired, mayn't I run on to the top of  that hill yonder?\"    \"Yes, if you will not go out of sight or hearing, so that I can see  that you are safe, and within call when I want you,\" he replied, and  she bounded away.    Rose was sitting thoughtfully, with her eyes upon the ground, while  those of her companion were following the graceful figure of his  little girl, as she tripped lightly along the road.    \"Mr. Dinsmore,\" Rose began.    \"I beg pardon, but were you speaking to me?\" he asked, turning to her  with a half smile.    \"Certainly,\" she replied, smiling in return; \"there is no one else  here.\"    \"Well then, Rose, dear, please to remember that I don't answer to that  name from your lips, at least not when we are alone. I am not Mr.  Dinsmore to you, unless you mean to be Miss Allison to me,\" he added,  taking her hand and gazing tenderly into her blushing face.    \"Oh! no, no; I would not have you call me that!\"    \"Well then, dear Rose, I want you to call me Horace. I would almost as  soon think of being Mr. Dinsmore to Elsie, as to you. And now, what  were you going to say to me?\"    \"Only that I wish to set out on my homeward way to-night, with Edward.  I think it would be best, more especially as mamma has written  complaining of our long absence, and urging a speedy return.\"    \"Of course your mother's wishes are the first to be consulted, until  you have given me a prior right,\" he said, in a playful tone; \"and  so I suppose Elsie and I will be obliged to continue our journey by  ourselves. But when may I claim you for my own indeed? Let it be as  soon as possible, dearest, for I feel that I ought to return to my  home ere long, and I am not willing to do so without my wife.\"    \"I must have a few weeks to prepare; you know a lady's wardrobe cannot  be got ready in a day. What would you say to six weeks? I am afraid  mamma would think it entirely too short.\"    \"Six weeks, dear Rose? why that would bring us to the middle of  November. Surely a month will be long enough to keep me waiting for my  happiness, and give the dressmakers sufficient time for their work.  Let us say one month from to-day.\"    Rose raised one objection after another, but he overruled them all and  pleaded his cause so earnestly that he gained his point at last, and  the wedding was fixed for that day month, provided the consent of  her parents, to so sudden a parting with their daughter, could be  obtained.    While Rose was at home making her preparations, Mr. Dinsmore and his  daughter were visiting the great lakes, and travelling through Canada.  He heard frequently from her, and there were always a few lines  to Elsie, which her father allowed her to answer in a little note  enclosed in his; and sometimes he read her a little of his own, or of  Miss Rose's letter, which she always considered a very great treat.    New York City was their last halting place on their route, and there  they spent nearly two weeks in shopping and sight-seeing. Mr. Dinsmore  purchased an elegant set of furniture for his wife's boudoir, and  sent it on to his home, with his orders to Mrs. Murray concerning  its arrangement. To this he added a splendid set of diamonds as his  wedding gift to his bride, while Elsie selected a pair of very costly  bracelets as hers.    They arrived in Philadelphia on Tuesday afternoon, the next morning  being the time appointed for the wedding. Mr. Dinsmore himself went to  his hotel, but sent Elsie and her nurse to Mr. Allison's, as he had  been urgently requested to do, the family being now in occupation of  their town residence.    Elsie found the whole house in a bustle of preparation. Sophy met her  at the door and carried her off at once to her own room, eager to  display what she called \"her wedding dress.\" She was quite satisfied  with the admiration Elsie expressed. \"But I suppose you bought ever so  many new dresses, and lots of other pretty things, in New York?\" she  said inquiringly.    \"Yes; papa and I together. And don't you think, Sophy, he let me help  him choose some of his clothes, and he says he thinks I have very good  taste in ladies' and gentlemen's dress too.\"    \"That was right kind of him, but isn't it odd, and real nice too, that  he and Rose are going to get married? I was so surprised. Do you like  it, Elsie? and shall you call her mamma?\"    \"Oh, yes, of course. I should be quite wretched if papa were going to  marry any one else; but I love Miss Rose dearly, and I am very glad  she is coming to us. I think it is very good of her, and papa thinks  so too.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Sophy honestly, \"and so do I; for I am sure I shouldn't  like to leave papa and mamma and go away off there to live, though I  do like you very much, Elsie, and your papa too. Only think! he is  going to be my brother; and then won't you be some sort of relation  too? I guess I'll be your aunt, won't I?\"    \"I don't know; I haven't thought about it,\" said Elsie; while at the  same instant Harold put his head in at the half-open door, saying, \"Of  course you will; and I'll be her uncle.\"    The little girls were quite startled at first, but seeing who it was,  Elsie ran towards him, holding out her hand.    \"How do you do, Harold?\" she said; \"I am glad to see you.\"    He had his satchel of books on his arm. \"Thank you, how are you? I  am rejoiced to see you looking so well, but, as for me, I am quite  sick--of lessons,\" he replied in a melancholy tone, and putting on a  comically doleful expression.    Elsie laughed and shook her head. \"I thought you ware a good boy and  quite fond of your books.\"    \"Commonly, I believe I am, but not in these wedding times. It's quite  too bad of your father, Elsie, to be carrying off Rose, when he won't  let us have you. But never mind, I'll be even with him some of these  days;\" and he gave her a meaning look.    \"Come in Harold, and put your books down,\" said Sophy; \"you can afford  to spend a few minutes talking to Elsie, can't you?\"    \"I think I will!\" he replied, accepting her invitation.    They chatted for some time, and then Adelaide came in. Elsie had heard  that she was coming on to be first bridesmaid. \"Elsie, dear, how  glad I am to see you! and how well and happy you are looking!\" she  exclaimed, folding her little niece in her arms, and kissing her  fondly. \"But come,\" she added, taking her by the hand and leading her  into the next room, \"Miss Rose came in from her shopping only a few  minutes ago, and she wants to see you.\"    Rose was standing by the toilet-table, gazing intently, with a blush  and a smile, at something she held in her hand. She laid it down as  they came in, and embracing the little girl affectionately, said how  very glad she was to see her.    Then, turning to the table again, she took up what she had been  looking at--which proved to be a miniature of Mr. Dinsmore--and  handed it to Adelaide, saying, \"Is it not excellent? and so kind and  thoughtful of him to give it to me.\"    \"It is indeed a most perfect likeness,\" Adelaide replied. \"Horace is  very thoughtful about these little matters. I hope he will make you  very happy, dear Rose. I cannot tell you how glad I was when I heard  you were to be my sister.\"    \"You have seemed like a sister to me ever since the winter I spent  with you,\" said Rose. And then she began questioning Elsie about her  journey asking if she were not fatigued, and would not like to lie  down and rest a little before tea.    \"No thank you,\" Elsie said; \"you know it is only a short trip from New  York, and I am not at all tired.\"    Just then the tea-bell rang, and Rose laughed and said it was well  Elsie had not accepted her invitation.    On going down to tea they found Mr. Dinsmore and Mr. Travilla there.  Elsie was delighted to meet her old friend, and it was evident that he  had already made himself a favorite with all the children, from Harold  down to little May.    The wedding was a really brilliant affair. The bride and her  attendants were beautifully dressed and, as every one remarked, looked  very charming. At an early hour in the morning carriages were in  waiting to convey the bridal party and the family to the church where  the ceremony was to be performed. When it was over they returned to  the house, where an elegant breakfast was provided for a large number  of guests; after which there was a grand reception for several hours.  Then, when the last guest had departed, Rose retired to her own room,  appearing shortly afterwards at the family dinner-table in her pretty  travelling dress, looking very sweet and engaging, but sober and  thoughtful, as were also her father and brothers; while Mrs. Allison's  eyes were constantly filling with tears at the thought of losing her  daughter.    There was very little eating done, and the conversation flagged  several times in spite of the efforts of the gentlemen to keep it up.  At length all rose from the table, and gathered in the parlor for  a few moments. Then came the parting, and they were gone; and Mrs.  Allison, feeling almost as if she had buried her daughter, tried to  forget her loss by setting herself vigorously to work overseeing the  business of putting her house in order.    Rose's feelings were mingled. She wept for a time, but the soothing  tenderness of her husband's manner, and Elsie's winning caresses, soon  restored her to herself, and smiles chased away the tears.    They had a very pleasant journey, without accident or detention, and  arrived in due time at their own home, where they were welcomed with  every demonstration of delight.    Rose was charmed with the Oaks, thought it even more lovely than  either Roselands or Elingrove, and Mr."]]]
