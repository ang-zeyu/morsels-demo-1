When Carson wrapped  his blanket around him, and lay down to rest, he knew his companion was  on guard and would not slumber. It was the same with his friend, their  watchfulness undoubtedly preventing the attack which scarcely could have  failed to be effectual.    It was needful now and then that one of them should venture out to  procure game, but that was so plentiful that he was never compelled to  go far, and he used such extreme care that he was not even so much as  fired upon.    Thus the time passed, until at the end of several weeks, the hunters  were surprised and delighted by the arrival of more than a dozen men on  their way with a complete outfit to join the main body. Carson and his  friend were glad enough to go with them and the long journey was begun.  They had not gone far, when they exchanged shots with hostiles and there  were almost daily skirmishes with them. By sunset they had travelled a  long distance, and went into camp, feeling certain that though Indians  had not shown themselves, they were in the vicinity. To prevent a  stampede of their animals, the long ropes around their necks were  fastened to stakes driven deep into the earth. This arrangement allowed  them to graze over sufficient ground and opposed an almost insuperable  obstacle to the success of the dusky thieves prowling around.    It was yet early in the evening when one of the dogs belonging to the  camp began barking. A score of causes might have caused this but Carson  believed the incitement in that instance was the one most dreaded.  Several men were added to the guard and the rest lay down, too uneasy to  gain much slumber, however.    The trappers were right in their suspicion that savages were near but  they could not have failed to note what precautions had been taken by  the whites against surprise and they withdrew without molesting them.  The party were in a beaver country, and Carson and three of his men went  up the stream some distance to learn whether it was worth their while to  set the traps.    They had not been gone long when a party of Indians, who were probably  awaiting such an opportunity, charged upon the camp and drove off all  the loose horses. Four of the hunters instantly saddled the swiftest  of those remaining and started in hot pursuit. So hot indeed was the  pursuit that they speedily came up with the marauders and opened a  running fight. One of the hunters was badly wounded, while a warrior  was shot from his horse pitching headlong to the earth with a screech  of agony. The remaining ones were pressed so hard that they were glad  enough to abandon the property which came back to the rightful owners,  probably before an animal was able to comprehend what had taken place.    The promptness and daring of the hunters had prevented a serious loss,  and though one of their number was severely hurt, his wound was not  mortal. It may be said that he suffered much but fully recovered in  time. Men with such iron constitutions and rugged frames rallied from  injuries that would have swept off those accustomed to less stirring  lives.    Having righted matters, so far as possible, the trappers picketed their  horses and awaited the return of Carson and his companions. They were  much disturbed by fears for their safety, as in truth they had good  cause to be.        CHAPTER VII.       An Unexpected Meeting--The Ambush--A Daring and Perilous Ride--Return to   Camp--Disappointments--The Beaver.    Meanwhile the Indians made it exceedingly lively for Kit Carson and his  three companions.    The latter had heard so much of the abundance of beavers in a  certain section that they determined to visit it and make a thorough  exploration. To do this, it was necessary to ride over a lofty Rocky  Mountain peak or take many hours to pass around it. Very naturally they  concluded to \"cut across lots,\" confident of their ability to take care  of themselves, no matter what danger threatened.    The ascent proved very exhausting to men and animals, for the trappers  did not compel the weary beasts to bear them up the steep slope where it  tired them to force their own way. They rested many times, but finally  accomplished the ascent and passed over into the valley beyond. There,  disappointment awaited them. The most careful search failed to show the  first sign of a beaver and they had their labor for their pains. The  toil of climbing the mountain peak was so severe that the hunters  concluded to take the longer route home. Their steeds had been pushed so  hard, that they were permitted to set their own pace on the return.  This naturally enough was a deliberate walk, while their riders talked,  laughed, jested and occasionally made some remark on the magnificent  scenery by which they were surrounded. There was no call for haste, and  they knew nothing of what had taken place in camp after their departure;  otherwise, they might have felt more impatience to rejoin their friends.    All at once, the hunters descried four Indian warriors in the path in  front. They were splendidly mounted, their hair ornamented with stained  eagle feathers, their ugly countenances daubed with yellow, black and  crimson paint, and they were fully armed. Their appearance showed they  were on the war path.    Such undoubtedly being the case, a sight of the braves was a challenge  to the hunters who accepted it without a second's hesitation.    Pausing not a moment to consult on their plan of action, Kit and his  companions spurred their horses to a dead run, with the purpose of  bringing them within range of their rifles, but the steeds of the dusky  foes were fleet of foot and they sped away like the wind.    The pursuit was a furious one, until the flying fugitives shot by a  hill, when more than fifty warriors similarly mounted and accoutred,  dashed out to intercept the enthusiastic hunters. Just then it dawned  upon Kit and his companions that the whole proceeding was a trap  arranged by the Indians into which he and his friends had dashed at  headlong speed.    It was in such crises that Kit Carson displayed his marvelous resources  and lightning-like perception of the best course to adopt. The discovery  of the ambush would have thrown almost any company of men, no matter  how brave into a panic, or at least into temporary confusion which would  have been equally disastrous. Most probably they would have reined up or  wheeled about and fled in the opposite direction. The whole band would  have dashed in pursuit and the running fight between four men and more  than twelve times their number, every one of whom it is fair to presume  was thoroughly familiar with the country, could have resulted in but one  way. Skilled and daring as were Carson and his comrades, they could  not accomplish the impossible, as they would have had to do in order to  escape the yelling band behind them.    Kit was slightly in advance of the others, and he did not check his  animal in the least. On the contrary, he urged him to his utmost, and  the four sped straight ahead on a dead run, seemingly as if they meant  to charge the entire war party.    Such, however, was not their intention: they shied off as much as they  could, and, throwing themselves forward and over the side of their  horses, ran the terrible gauntlet. No one of the trappers fired a shot,  for if dismounted by the bullets of their enemies, each wished to have  his loaded rifle in hand, with which to make his last defense.    The very audacity of the movement amazed the Indians. By the time they  comprehended what the white men were doing, they were thundering in  front of them. Then the warriors opened fire, and the bullets whistled  about the horses and riders, who kept their steeds to the highest  bent and finally passed beyond danger--their escape one of the most  extraordinary on record.    The Indians did not pursue the hunters, two of whom had been struck by  their bullets, and Carson and his friends drew their horses down to  a more moderate pace. The great scout admitted that he was never more  utterly deceived and entrapped by the red man in all his life. But  he saw in the occurrence a deeper significance than appeared on the  surface. The ambush into which he and his friends had been led was only  a part of the campaign against the entire party, who, weakened by the  absence of Carson and his companions were likely to fall victims to such  a large band of warriors. Trembling with fear for their comrades, they  again forced their animals to a high speed and lost no time in making  their way back to camp. They found everything in good shape, much to  their relief, and were not at all surprised to learn of the visit  that had been made by the savages during the absence of Kit and his  companions.    The wounds of the two trappers who were shot while running the fiery  gauntlet, were found to be of such a serious nature that the party had  not gone far when they were obliged to go into camp again. One of them  especially, was in such a bad way that it was found necessary to carry  him on a litter until the main camp was reached. There he was allowed to  rest and everything possible was done to make him comfortable. When he  had fully recovered, the entire company headed for Old Park, once  famous on account of the immense numbers of beavers found there.  Disappointment, however, awaited them, for other trappers had preceded  them, and made such thorough work that it was useless for the last  arrivals to unload and set their traps.    The party visited other sections but in every instance they appeared  to be \"a day too late for the fair;\" the beaver runs had been worked so  thoroughly by others that it was useless for them to expect success.    The beaver, as the reader probably knows, aside from its great value  in producing fur and perfume, possesses a most wonderful instinct.

So Tom came home again with his  spade on his shoulder, a little cooler than he went, and many's the  hearty curse he gave the Lepracaun every time he thought of the neat  turn he had served him.        THE HORNED WOMEN    A rich woman sat up late one night carding and preparing wool, while  all the family and servants were asleep. Suddenly a knock was given at  the door, and a voice called, \"Open! open!\"    \"Who is there?\" said the woman of the house.    \"I am the Witch of one Horn,\" was answered.    The mistress, supposing that one of her neighbours had called and  required assistance, opened the door, and a woman entered, having in  her hand a pair of wool-carders, and bearing a horn on her forehead, as  if growing there. She sat down by the fire in silence, and began to  card the wool with violent haste. Suddenly she paused, and said aloud:  \"Where are the women? they delay too long.\"    Then a second knock came to the door, and a voice called as before,  \"Open! open!\"    The mistress felt herself obliged to rise and open to the call, and  immediately a second witch entered, having two horns on her forehead,  and in her hand a wheel for spinning wool.    \"Give me place,\" she said; \"I am the Witch of the two Horns,\" and she  began to spin as quick as lightning.    And so the knocks went on, and the call was heard, and the witches  entered, until at last twelve women sat round the fire--the first with  one horn, the last with twelve horns.    And they carded the thread, and turned their spinning-wheels, and wound  and wove, all singing together an ancient rhyme, but no word did they  speak to the mistress of the house. Strange to hear, and frightful to  look upon, were these twelve women, with their horns and their wheels;  and the mistress felt near to death, and she tried to rise that she  might call for help, but she could not move, nor could she utter a word  or a cry, for the spell of the witches was upon her.    Then one of them called to her in Irish, and said, \"Rise, woman, and  make us a cake.\"    Then the mistress searched for a vessel to bring water from the well  that she might mix the meal and make the cake, but she could find none.    And they said to her, \"Take a sieve and bring water in it.\"    And she took the sieve and went to the well; but the water poured from  it, and she could fetch none for the cake, and she sat down by the well  and wept.    Then a voice came by her and said, \"Take yellow clay and moss, and bind  them together, and plaster the sieve so that it will hold.\"    This she did, and the sieve held the water for the cake; and the voice  said again:    \"Return, and when thou comest to the north angle of the house, cry  aloud three times and say, 'The mountain of the Fenian women and the  sky over it is all on fire.'\"    And she did so.    When the witches inside heard the call, a great and terrible cry broke  from their lips, and they rushed forth with wild lamentations and  shrieks, and fled away to Slievenamon, where was their chief abode. But  the Spirit of the Well bade the mistress of the house to enter and  prepare her home against the enchantments of the witches if they  returned again.    And first, to break their spells, she sprinkled the water in which she  had washed her child's feet, the feet-water, outside the door on the  threshold; secondly, she took the cake which in her absence the witches  had made of meal mixed with the blood drawn from the sleeping family,  and she broke the cake in bits, and placed a bit in the mouth of each  sleeper, and they were restored; and she took the cloth they had woven,  and placed it half in and half out of the chest with the padlock; and  lastly, she secured the door with a great crossbeam fastened in the  jambs, so that the witches could not enter, and having done these  things she waited.    Not long were the witches in coming back, and they raged and called for  vengeance.    \"Open! open!\" they screamed; \"open, feet-water!\"    \"I cannot,\" said the feet-water; \"I am scattered on the ground, and my  path is down to the Lough.\"    \"Open, open, wood and trees and beam!\" they cried to the door.    \"I cannot,\" said the door, \"for the beam is fixed in the jambs and I  have no power to move.\"    \"Open, open, cake that we have made and mingled with blood!\" they cried  again.    \"I cannot,\" said the cake, \"for I am broken and bruised, and my blood  is on the lips of the sleeping children.\"    Then the witches rushed through the air with great cries, and fled back  to Slievenamon, uttering strange curses on the Spirit of the Well, who  had wished their ruin; but the woman and the house were left in peace,  and a mantle dropped by one of the witches in her flight was kept hung  up by the mistress in memory of that night; and this mantle was kept by  the same family from generation to generation for five hundred years  after.        CONALL YELLOWCLAW    Conall Yellowclaw was a sturdy tenant in Erin: he had three sons. There  was at that time a king over every fifth of Erin. It fell out for the  children of the king that was near Conall, that they themselves and the  children of Conall came to blows. The children of Conall got the upper  hand, and they killed the king's big son. The king sent a message for  Conall, and he said to him--\"Oh, Conall! what made your sons go to  spring on my sons till my big son was killed by your children? but I  see that though I follow you revengefully, I shall not be much better  for it, and I will now set a thing before you, and if you will do it, I  will not follow you with revenge. If you and your sons will get me the  brown horse of the king of Lochlann, you shall get the souls of your  sons.\"    \"Why,\" said Conall, \"should not I do the pleasure of the king, though  there should be no souls of my sons in dread at all. Hard is the matter  you require of me, but I will lose my own life, and the life of my  sons, or else I will do the pleasure of the king.\"    After these words Conall left the king, and he went home: when he got  home he was under much trouble and perplexity. When he went to lie down  he told his wife the thing the king had set before him. His wife took  much sorrow that he was obliged to part from herself, while she knew  not if she should see him more.    \"Oh, Conall,\" said she, \"why didst not thou let the king do his own  pleasure to thy sons, rather than be going now, while I know not if  ever I shall see thee more?\"    When he rose on the morrow, he set himself and his three sons in order,  and they took their journey towards Lochlann, and they made no stop but  tore through ocean till they reached it. When they reached Lochlann  they did not know what they should do. Said the old man to his sons,  \"Stop ye, and we will seek out the house of the king's miller.\"    When they went into the house of the king's miller, the man asked them  to stop there for the night. Conall told the miller that his own  children and the children of his king had fallen out, and that his  children had killed the king's son, and there was nothing that would  please the king but that he should get the brown horse of the king of  Lochlann.    \"If you will do me a kindness, and will put me in a way to get him, for  certain I will pay ye for it.\"    \"The thing is silly that you are come to seek,\" said the miller; \"for  the king has laid his mind on him so greatly that you will not get him  in any way unless you steal him; but if you can make out a way, I will  keep it secret.\"    \"This is what I am thinking,\" said Conall, \"since you are working every  day for the king, you and your gillies could put myself and my sons  into five sacks of bran.\"    \"The plan that has come into your head is not bad,\" said the miller.    The miller spoke to his gillies, and he said to them to do this, and  they put them in five sacks. The king's gillies came to seek the bran,  and they took the five sacks with them, and they emptied them before  the horses. The servants locked the door, and they went away.    When they rose to lay hand on the brown horse, said Conall, \"You shall  not do that. It is hard to get out of this; let us make for ourselves  five hiding holes, so that if they hear us we may go and hide.\" They  made the holes, then they laid hands on the horse. The horse was pretty  well unbroken, and he set to making a terrible noise through the  stable. The king heard the noise. \"It must be my brown horse,\" said he  to his gillies; \"find out what is wrong with him.\"    The servants went out, and when Conall and his sons saw them coming  they went into the hiding holes. The servants looked amongst the  horses, and they did not find anything wrong; and they returned and  they told this to the king, and the king said to them that if nothing  was wrong they should go to their places of rest. When the gillies had  time to be gone, Conall and his sons laid their hands again on the  horse. If the noise was great that he made before, the noise he made  now was seven times greater. The king sent a message for his gillies  again, and said for certain there was something troubling the brown  horse. \"Go and look well about him.\" The servants went out, and they  went to their hiding holes. The servants rummaged well, and did not  find a thing. They returned and they told this.    \"That is marvellous for me,\" said the king: \"go you to lie down again,  and if I notice it again I will go out myself.\"    When Conall and his sons perceived that the gillies were gone, they  laid hands again on the horse, and one of them caught him, and if the  noise that the horse made on the two former times was great, he made  more this time.    \"Be this from me,\" said the king; \"it must be that some one is  troubling my brown horse.\" He sounded the bell"]]]
