The mighty king So, he of the Ryo line, worshipped the Great  Teacher Donran Daishi, naming him the Bodhisattva of Ran, turning  his face in worship unto the dwelling-place of his Teacher.      CONCERNING DOSHAKU-ZENJI    171. Having cast away from him all trust in the righteous deeds of  the sages, Doshaku-Zenji, the Great Teacher, hath taught us to enter  in at the only gate that is the Gospel of the Pure Land.    172. Having thus cast away from him the laborious study of the  Doctrine of Nirvana, Doshaku, the Great Teacher, himself trusted  only in the power of the Divine Promise, and he persuaded men to  follow after him.    173. In this world of sin that is so far removed from the blessed  day of our Lord, is there no man who attaineth unto the wisdom  Supreme, yea, not though he should compass all righteous doing. So  teacheth our Lord of Great Teaching.    174. He who succeeded unto the teaching of Donran-Daishi,  Doshaku-zenji, the Great Priest, thus declareth: \"To toil and labour  after righteous deeds in this life is the unavailing toil of  self-effort.\"    175. In this world, the doing of evil and the sin that is wrought of  men is violent and furious as the storm wind and rain. Therefore  have the compassionate Buddhas exhorted men to seek their refuge  within the Land of Purity.    176. From him that sinneth, throughout his life shall the fetters of  illusion fall away, if he shall recite the Holy Name with love and  adoration.    177. That he might lead men into the Eternal Kingdom--those men who  are in this life fast bound unto the evil thing, our Father teacheth  us, saying, \"Recite my name,\" and hath promised further, \"Doing  this, if they be not born again, I myself will not attain unto  Wisdom.\"      CONCERNING ZENDO-DAISHI    178. Rising like unto an incarnation of the Mighty Ocean, Zendo, the  great teacher, came into the world.    And for the sake of mankind in this sinful place, he called unto all  the Buddhas of the Ten Regions to be his testimony unto his  commentary on the Sutra.    179. Two interpreters of Zendo-Daishi were there in the age that  followed his own, and these were Hosho and Shoko. They, it is, who  have opened the Treasury of teaching that the inward purpose of the  Blessed One should be wholly made known.    180. How should women turn their hearts unto wisdom--they who are  fast bound with the five fetters? No, not through the ages of  myriads of Kalpas, until they seek refuge in the Divine Promise of  Him who is mighty.    181. Having thrown open the Gate of Righteousness, our Lord hath  instructed mankind in every sort of righteous deed. He hath set  before us how the five right deeds differ from the confused deeds  that are outside the Five, so that mankind may enter the way of the  Sole Practice.    182. To mingle the right action with the action that is not akin to  it is called the confused practice. The man that erreth therein  hath not attained unto the single heart. He knoweth not thankfulness  for the grace of the Enlightened One.    183. If he entreat in prayer the good things of this world, even  though he recite only the Blessed Name, he is condemned therein,  being also a man of the confused practice. He shall not be born into  the Land of Purity.    184. Not one, indeed, but not far asunder are the confused deed and  the confused practice. The teachings that are not the teachings of  the Land of Purity are to be condemned as confused deeds.    185. Having invoked the testimony of all the Buddhas, Zendo-Daishi  hath set before us the story of the two rivers, the one, the river  of fire, the other the river of water, that he might incline the  heart to righteous deeds, and guard the true faith of the Divine  Promise.    186. Verily a simple man may attain unto the true Illumination, if  he believe the Holy Promise that is the spirit of the teaching of  Shinshu. Because for this only was the Lord made manifest in this  world, and not according to those other teachings which shall pass  away and be no more.    187. Before the Almighty Power of the Divine teaching do all the  fetters of evil deeds fall away. Therefore is the Divine Promise of  our Father invoked as that Holy Thing which giveth unto us  omnipotent strength.    188. Yet, to whomsoever would enter the Promised Land, created in  the power of His Divine Vow, is belief in his own strength impotent.    And because they are needless, therefore the wise who have received  the Great and Lesser Vehicles must trust unto the promise of the  Almighty One.    189. Whoso hath known himself the slave of illusion shall yet,  relying on the Power of the Holy Promise, enter into the immortal  joy of the Truth, and all his earthly body shall fall from him.    190. Merciful and compassionate parents unto us are the Blessed One  and the Lord Buddha. For they have opened before us the ways of  good, having so purposed that the great Faith shall be.    191. He who is one with the True Soul hath attained unto a heart  clear and hard as diamond. Therefore is he at one with that man who  hath the three excellent forms of Penitence. This hath the Great  Teacher shown us.    192. By that faith alone, like unto a jewel of price, we who in this  sinful world have our being, may enter into the Eternal Kingdom,  being eternally freed from the yoke of birth and death.    193. At that moment when faith in the Enlightened One is perfected,  pure and lasting as the diamond, then shall the Spiritual Light  shine upon us and guard us, the light which for ever guideth us from  rebirth and death.    194. Whoso attaineth not unto the True Faith hath not in him one of  the Trinity of Virtues, that are Sincerity, Faith, and Hope, and the  man that hath not one of these three holdeth not the perfect faith.    195. Whoso attaineth unto the True Faith given of Him is freed from  all let and hindrance, for his heart is at one with the Divine  Promise, and he is obedient unto the true teaching that is the Very  Word of the Buddha.    196. Whoso hath comprehended the truth of the Holy Name is at that  very moment freed from doubt. He hath possessed the Right thought,  and he is commended as excellent and rare in his attainment.    197. He shall be let and hindered that is not at one with the Divine  Promise, and therefore he whose faith is not full of Peace is a man  who holdeth not the Divine Thought.    198. The attainment of the Divine Wisdom shall come unto him who  reciteth the Holy Name, for his faith cometh from the Divine Promise  of Him that leadeth him into the Promised Land. He shall not fail  to attain unto the Great Nirvana.    199. At this time when the five Signs of Degeneration are manifest,  many men are there who doubt and blaspheme the Holy Doctrine. Yea,  even the Priests, together with the people, are enemies unto him who  walketh in the right way.    200. He who blasphemeth the Divine Promise is a man born blind. He  shall sink into three evil worlds for age-long myriads of Kalpas.    201. Though the way into the Land that is in the West hath been made  plain before us, yet the age-long Kalpas have rolled away without  good fruit thereof, for we have hindered ourselves and our brethren  that we might not enter therein.    202. Without the Almighty Strength of the Divine Promise how should  we leave this sinful world? Wherefore we should live in hearty  thanksgiving for the Grace of our Father, thinking ever upon the  ocean deeps of his love.    203. For it is by the marvellous mercy of our Lord that we may cast  aside the anguish of birth and death, in the shining hope of our  Eternal Kingdom.    Therefore should we return unto the Lord righteous deeds in  thanksgiving for His grace and mercy.      CONCERNING GENSHIN-SOZU    204. Genshin the Great Teacher declareth: \"In this world have I,  even I, appeared as an incarnation of the Buddha, and now, my work  of Salvation being accomplished, I return unto the Eternal Kingdom  that is my home.    205. From the teaching of our Lord hath Genshin, the Great Teacher,  tenderly opened unto us the gate of the Doctrine of the Holy Name,  and hath so taught mankind in this evil world that is far removed  from the Golden Day of our Lord.    206. Genshin-Sozu, he who sat in the Assemblage on the Peak of  Vultures in the time of our Lord, hath taught us that there are two  Paradises, that which is eternal and that which is temporal, and  thus setteth forth the merit and the defect of the Right Practice  and of the Mingled Deed.    207. Acharya Genshin, the Great Teacher, considering one of the  Sutra with the commentary of Ekanzenji, hath made plain the  attributes of the Land of Outermost Places.    208. For he said: \"Not one man is there of thousands who may not be  born into the Land of Purity.\" And thus saying, he commendeth the  followers of the Right Practice.    And again:    \"There is not even one among tens of thousands who may enter it.\"  And so saying, he condemneth the doers of the mingled deed.    209. Further he setteth forth how few are the men who can enter into  the True Land of Purity. And very solemnly he warneth us that more  are they that are born into the Temporal Paradise.    210. Wheresoever men or women, be they noble or lowly born, recite  the Holy Name of our Father, there is no pre-eminence of place or  time. Freely may they do this, whether walking, resting, sitting,  or lying.    211. Though our eyes are so blinded by illusion that we discern not  the light whereby He embraceth us, yet that great mercy for ever  shineth upon us and is not weary.    212. Whatsoever may be his Visible Deed that would be born into the  Promised Land, he shall not forget day or night to hold fast unto  the name of the Divine Promise.    213. To us that in this world are sinners most sinful, there is none  other way of Salvation save that we should enter into the Land of  Purity, by reciting the holy name of Him who is our Father.       "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7025"],[0,"Rob Roy — Complete (#6)"],[1,"ribs on a former occasion,\" said he, \"and  now, Rob, if you provoke me farther, I will break your neck.\" But it must  be remembered that Edmondstone was a man of consequence in the Jacobite  party, as he carried the royal standard of James VII. at the battle of  Sheriffmuir, and also, that he was near the door of his own  mansion-house, and probably surrounded by his friends and adherents. Rob  Roy, however, suffered in reputation for retiring under such a threat.    Another well-vouched case is that of Cunningham of Boquhan.    Henry Cunningham, Esq. of Boquhan, was a gentleman of Stirlingshire, who,  like many _exquisites_ of our own time, united a natural high spirit and  daring character with an affectation of delicacy of address and manners  amounting to foppery.*    * His courage and affectation of foppery were united, which is less  frequently the case, with a spirit of innate modesty. He is thus  described in Lord Binning's satirical verses, entitled \"Argyle's Levee:\"                       \"Six times had Harry bowed unseen,                          Before he dared advance;                     The Duke then, turning round well pleased,                          Said, 'Sure you've been in France!                     A more polite and jaunty man                          I never saw before:'                     Then Harry bowed, and blushed, and bowed,                          And strutted to the door.\"    See a Collection of original Poems, by Scotch Gentlemen, vol. ii. p. 125.    He chanced to be in company with Rob Roy, who, either in contempt of  Boquhan's supposed effeminacy, or because he thought him a safe person to  fix a quarrel on (a point which Rob's enemies alleged he was wont to  consider), insulted him so grossly that a challenge passed between them.  The goodwife of the clachan had hidden Cunningham's sword, and while he  rummaged the house in quest of his own or some other, Rob Roy went to the  Shieling Hill, the appointed place of combat, and paraded there with  great majesty, waiting for his antagonist. In the meantime, Cunningham  had rummaged out an old sword, and, entering the ground of contest in all  haste, rushed on the outlaw with such unexpected fury that he fairly  drove him off the field, nor did he show himself in the village again for  some time. Mr. MacGregor Stirling has a softened account of this anecdote  in his new edition of Nimmo's Stirlingshire; still he records Rob Roy's  discomfiture.    Occasionally Rob Roy suffered disasters, and incurred great personal  danger. On one remarkable occasion he was saved by the coolness of his  lieutenant, Macanaleister or Fletcher, the _Little John_ of his band--a  fine active fellow, of course, and celebrated as a marksman. It happened  that MacGregor and his party had been surprised and dispersed by a  superior force of horse and foot, and the word was given to \"split and  squander.\" Each shifted for himself, but a bold dragoon attached himself  to pursuit of Rob, and overtaking him, struck at him with his broadsword.  A plate of iron in his bonnet saved the MacGregor from being cut down to  the teeth; but the blow was heavy enough to bear him to the ground,  crying as he fell, \"Oh, Macanaleister, is there naething in her?\" (_i.e._  in the gun). The trooper, at the same time, exclaiming, \"D--n ye, your  mother never wrought your night-cap!\" had his arm raised for a second  blow, when Macanaleister fired, and the ball pierced the dragoon's heart.    Such as he was, Rob Roy's progress in his occupation is thus described by  a gentleman of sense and talent, who resided within the circle of his  predatory wars, had probably felt their effects, and speaks of them, as  might be expected, with little of the forbearance with which, from their  peculiar and romantic character, they are now regarded.    \"This man (Rob Roy MacGregor) was a person of sagacity, and neither  wanted stratagem nor address; and having abandoned himself to all  licentiousness, set himself at the head of all the loose, vagrant, and  desperate people of that clan, in the west end of Perth and Stirling  shires, and infested those whole countries with thefts, robberies, and  depredations. Very few who lived within his reach (that is, within the  distance of a nocturnal expedition) could promise to themselves security,  either for their persons or effects, without subjecting themselves to pay  him a heavy and shameful tax of _black-mail._ He at last proceeded to  such a degree of audaciousness that he committed robberies, raised  contributions, and resented quarrels, at the head of a very considerable  body of armed men, in open day, and in the face of the government.\"*    * Mr. Grahame of Gartmore's Causes of the Disturbances in the Highlands.  See Jamieson's edition of Burt's Letters from the North of Scotland,  Appendix, vol. ii. p. 348.    The extent and success of these depredations cannot be surprising, when  we consider that the scene of them was laid in a country where the  general law was neither enforced nor respected.    Having recorded that the general habit of cattle-stealing had blinded  even those of the better classes to the infamy of the practice, and that  as men's property consisted entirely in herds, it was rendered in the  highest degree precarious, Mr. Grahame adds--    \"On these accounts there is no culture of ground, no improvement of  pastures, and from the same reasons, no manufactures, no trade; in short,  no industry. The people are extremely prolific, and therefore so  numerous, that there is not business in that country, according to its  present order and economy, for the one-half of them. Every place is full  of idle people, accustomed to arms, and lazy in everything but rapines  and depredations. As _buddel_ or _aquavitae_ houses are to be found  everywhere through the country, so in these they saunter away their time,  and frequently consume there the returns of their illegal purchases. Here  the laws have never been executed, nor the authority of the magistrate  ever established. Here the officer of the law neither dare nor can  execute his duty, and several places are about thirty miles from lawful  persons. In short, here is no order, no authority, no government.\"    The period of the rebellion, 1715, approached soon after Rob Roy had  attained celebrity. His Jacobite partialities were now placed in  opposition to his sense of the obligations which he owed to the indirect  protection of the Duke of Argyle. But the desire of \"drowning his  sounding steps amid the din of general war\" induced him to join the  forces of the Earl of Mar, although his patron the Duke of Argyle was at  the head of the army opposed to the Highland insurgents.    The MacGregors, a large sept of them at least, that of Ciar Mhor, on this  occasion were not commanded by Rob Roy, but by his nephew already  mentioned, Gregor MacGregor, otherwise called James Grahame of Glengyle,  and still better remembered by the Gaelic epithet of _Ghlune Dhu, i.e._  Black Knee, from a black spot on one of his knees, which his Highland  garb rendered visible. There can be no question, however, that being then  very young, Glengyle must have acted on most occasions by the advice and  direction of so experienced a leader as his uncle.    The MacGregors assembled in numbers at that period, and began even to  threaten the Lowlands towards the lower extremity of Loch Lomond. They  suddenly seized all the boats which were upon the lake, and, probably  with a view to some enterprise of their own, drew them overland to  Inversnaid, in order to intercept the progress of a large body of  west-country whigs who were in arms for the government, and moving in  that direction.    The whigs made an excursion for the recovery of the boats. Their forces  consisted of volunteers from Paisley, Kilpatrick, and elsewhere, who,  with the assistance of a body of seamen, were towed up the river Leven in  long-boats belonging to the ships of war then lying in the Clyde. At Luss  they were joined by the forces of Sir Humphrey Colquhoun, and James  Grant, his son-in-law, with their followers, attired in the Highland  dress of the period, which is picturesquely described.* The whole party  crossed to Craig-Royston, but the MacGregors did not offer combat.    * \"At night they arrived at Luss, where they were joined by Sir Humphrey  Colquhoun of Luss, and James Grant of Plascander, his son-in-law,  followed by forty or fifty stately fellows in their short hose and belted  plaids, armed each of them with a well-fixed gun on his shoulder, a  strong handsome target, with a sharp-pointed steel of above half an ell  in length screwed into the navel of it, on his left arm, a sturdy  claymore by his side, and a pistol or two, with a dirk and knife, in his  belt.\"--_Rae's History of the Rebellion,_ 4to, p. 287.    If we are to believe the account of the expedition given by the historian  Rae, they leapt on shore at Craig-Royston with the utmost intrepidity, no  enemy appearing to oppose them, and by the noise of their drums, which  they beat incessantly, and the discharge of their artillery and small  arms, terrified the MacGregors, whom they appear never to have seen, out  of their fastnesses, and caused them to fly in a panic to the general  camp of the Highlanders at Strath-Fillan.* The low-country men succeeded  in getting possession of the boats at a great expenditure of noise and  courage, and little risk of danger.    * Note C. The Loch Lomond Expedition.    After this temporary removal from his old haunts, Rob Roy was sent by the  Earl of Mar to Aberdeen, to raise, it is believed, a part of the clan  Gregor, which is settled in that country. These men were of his own  family (the race of the Ciar Mhor). They were the descendants of about  three hundred MacGregors whom the Earl of Murray, about the year 1624,  transported from his estates in Menteith to oppose against his enemies  the MacIntoshes, a race"]]]
