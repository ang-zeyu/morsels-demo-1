A grieved look came over her exquisite  features.    \"Have I no welcome here, pretty subjects?\" she asked gently. \"Have I  not come from my Royal Bush to be your Ruler?\"    \"You were picked by mortals, without our consent,\" replied the Moss  Rose, coldly; \"so we refuse to allow you to rule us.\"    \"Turn her out, Gardener, with the others!\" cried the Tea Rose.    \"Just a second, please!\" called Shaggy, taking the Love Magnet from his  pocket. \"I guess this will win their love, Princess. Here--take it in  your hand and let the roses see it.\"    Princess Ozga took the Magnet and held it poised before the eyes of her  subjects; but the Roses regarded it with calm disdain.    \"Why, what's the matter?\" demanded Shaggy in surprise. \"The Magnet  never failed to work before!\"    \"I know,\" said Betsy, nodding her head wisely. \"These Roses have no  hearts.\"    \"That's it,\" agreed the Gardener. \"They're pretty, and sweet, and  alive; but still they are Roses. Their stems have thorns, but no  hearts.\"    The Princess sighed and handed the Magnet to the Shaggy Man.    \"What shall I do?\" she asked sorrowfully.    \"Turn her out, Gardener, with the others!\" commanded the Roses. \"We  will have no Ruler until a man-rose--a King--is ripe enough to pick.\"    \"Very well,\" said the Gardener meekly. \"You must excuse me, my dear  Shaggy, for opposing your wishes, but you and the others, including  Ozga, must get out of Rose Kingdom immediately, if not before.\"    \"Don't you love me, Gardy?\" asked Shaggy, carelessly displaying the  Magnet.    \"I do. I dote on thee!\" answered the Gardener earnestly; \"but no true  man will neglect his duty for the sake of love. My duty is to drive you  out, so--out you go!\"    With this he seized a garden fork and began jabbing it at the  strangers, in order to force them to leave. Hank the mule was not  afraid of the fork and when he got his heels near to the Gardener the  man fell back to avoid a kick.    But now the Roses crowded around the outcasts and it was soon  discovered that beneath their draperies of green leaves were many sharp  thorns which were more dangerous than Hank's heels. Neither Betsy nor  Ozga nor Shaggy nor the mule cared to brave those thorns and when they  pressed away from them they found themselves slowly driven through the  garden door into the greenhouse. From there they were forced out at the  entrance and so through the territory of the flower-strewn Rose  Kingdom, which was not of very great extent.    The Rose Princess was sobbing bitterly; Betsy was indignant and angry;  Hank uttered defiant \"Hee-haws\" and the Shaggy Man whistled softly to  himself.    The boundary of the Rose Kingdom was a deep gulf, but there was a  drawbridge in one place and this the Royal Gardener let down until the  outcasts had passed over it. Then he drew it up again and returned with  his Roses to the greenhouse, leaving the four queerly assorted comrades  to wander into the bleak and unknown country that lay beyond.    \"I don't mind, much,\" remarked Shaggy, as he led the way over the  stony, barren ground. \"I've got to search for my long-lost little  brother, anyhow, so it won't matter where I go.\"    \"Hank and I will help you find your brother,\" said Betsy in her most  cheerful voice. \"I'm so far away from home now that I don't s'pose I'll  ever find my way back; and, to tell the truth, it's more fun traveling  around and having adventures than sticking at home. Don't you think so,  Hank?\"    \"Hee-haw!\" said Hank, and the Shaggy Man thanked them both.    \"For my part,\" said Princess Ozga of Roseland, with a gentle sigh, \"I  must remain forever exiled from my Kingdom. So I, too, will be glad to  help the Shaggy Man find his lost brother.\"    \"That's very kind of you, ma'am,\" said Shaggy. \"But unless I can find  the underground cavern of Ruggedo, the Metal Monarch, I shall never  find poor brother.\"      (This King was formerly named \"Roquat,\" but after he drank of the  \"Waters of Oblivion\" he forgot his own name and had to take another.)      \"Doesn't anyone know where it is?\" inquired Betsy.    \"_Some_ one must know, of course,\" was Shaggy's reply. \"But we are not  the ones. The only way to succeed is for us to keep going until we find  a person who can direct us to Ruggedo's cavern.\"    \"We may find it ourselves, without any help,\" suggested Betsy. \"Who  knows?\"    \"No one knows that, except the person who's writing this story,\" said  Shaggy. \"But we won't find anything--not even supper--unless we travel  on. Here's a path. Let's take it and see where it leads to.\"          Chapter Seven    Polychrome's Pitiful Plight      The Rain King got too much water in his basin and spilled some over the  brim. That made it rain in a certain part of the country--a real hard  shower, for a time--and sent the Rainbow scampering to the place to  show the gorgeous colors of his glorious bow as soon as the mist of  rain had passed and the sky was clear.    The coming of the Rainbow is always a joyous event to earth folk, yet  few have ever seen it close by. Usually the Rainbow is so far distant  that you can observe its splendid hues but dimly, and that is why we  seldom catch sight of the dancing Daughters of the Rainbow.    In the barren country where the rain had just fallen there appeared to  be no human beings at all; but the Rainbow appeared, just the same, and  dancing gayly upon its arch were the Rainbow's Daughters, led by the  fairylike Polychrome, who is so dainty and beautiful that no girl has  ever quite equalled her in loveliness.    Polychrome was in a merry mood and danced down the arch of the bow to  the ground, daring her sisters to follow her. Laughing and gleeful,  they also touched the ground with their twinkling feet; but all the  Daughters of the Rainbow knew that this was a dangerous pastime, so  they quickly climbed upon their bow again.    All but Polychrome. Though the sweetest and merriest of them all, she  was likewise the most reckless. Moreover, it was an unusual sensation  to pat the cold, damp earth with her rosy toes. Before she realized it  the bow had lifted and disappeared in the billowy blue sky, and here  was Polychrome standing helpless upon a rock, her gauzy draperies  floating about her like brilliant cobwebs and not a soul--fairy or  mortal--to help her regain her lost bow!    \"Dear me!\" she exclaimed, a frown passing across her pretty face, \"I'm  caught again. This is the second time my carelessness has left me on  earth while my sisters returned to our Sky Palaces. The first time I  enjoyed some pleasant adventures, but this is a lonely, forsaken  country and I shall be very unhappy until my Rainbow comes again and I  can climb aboard. Let me think what is best to be done.\"    She crouched low upon the flat rock, drew her draperies about her and  bowed her head.    It was in this position that Betsy Bobbin spied Polychrome as she came  along the stony path, followed by Hank, the Princess and Shaggy. At  once the girl ran up to the radiant Daughter of the Rainbow and  exclaimed:    \"Oh, what a lovely, lovely creature!\"    Polychrome raised her golden head. There were tears in her blue eyes.    \"I'm the most miserable girl in the whole world!\" she sobbed.    The others gathered around her.    \"Tell us your troubles, pretty one,\" urged the Princess.    \"I--I've lost my bow!\" wailed Polychrome.    \"Take me, my dear,\" said Shaggy Man in a sympathetic tone, thinking she  meant \"beau\" instead of \"bow.\"    \"I don't want you!\" cried Polychrome, stamping her foot imperiously; \"I  want my _Rain_bow.\"    \"Oh; that's different,\" said Shaggy. \"But try to forget it. When I was  young I used to cry for the Rainbow myself, but I couldn't have it.  Looks as if _you_ couldn't have it, either; so please don't cry.\"    Polychrome looked at him reproachfully.    \"I don't like you,\" she said.    \"No?\" replied Shaggy, drawing the Love Magnet from his pocket; \"not a  little bit?--just a wee speck of a like?\"    \"Yes, yes!\" said Polychrome, clasping her hands in ecstasy as she gazed  at the enchanted talisman; \"I love you, Shaggy Man!\"    \"Of course you do,\" said he calmly; \"but I don't take any credit for  it. It's the Love Magnet's powerful charm. But you seem quite alone and  friendless, little Rainbow. Don't you want to join our party until you  find your father and sisters again?\"    \"Where are you going?\" she asked.    \"We don't just know that,\" said Betsy, taking her hand; \"but we're  trying to find Shaggy's long-lost brother, who has been captured by the  terrible Metal Monarch. Won't you come with us, and help us?\"    Polychrome looked from one to another of the queer party of travelers  and a bewitching smile suddenly lighted her face.    \"A donkey, a mortal maid, a Rose Princess and a Shaggy Man!\" she  exclaimed. \"Surely you need help, if you intend to face Ruggedo.\"    \"Do you know him, then?\" inquired Betsy.    \"No, indeed. Ruggedo's caverns are beneath the earth's surface, where  no Rainbow can ever penetrate. But I've heard of the Metal Monarch. He  is also called the Nome King, you know, and he has made trouble for a  good many people--mortals and fairies--in his time,\" said Polychrome.    \"Do you fear him, then?\" asked the Princess, anxiously.    \"No one can harm a Daughter of the Rainbow,\" said Polychrome proudly.  \"I'm a sky fairy.\"    \"Then,\" said Betsy, quickly, \"you will be able to tell us the way to  Ruggedo's cavern.\"    \"No,\" returned Polychrome, shaking her head, \"that is one thing I  cannot do. But I will gladly go with you and help you search for the  place.\"    This promise delighted all the wanderers and after the Shaggy Man had  found the path again they began moving along it in a more happy mood.  The Rainbow's Daughter danced lightly over the rocky trail, no longer  sad, but with her beautiful features wreathed in smiles. Shaggy came  next, walking steadily and now and then supporting the Rose Princess,  who followed him. Betsy and Hank brought "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#6)"],[1," trees, where they obtained some of  the fruit, and at the edge of the little forest were wild plums. The  forest itself consisted entirely of nut trees--walnuts, filberts,  almonds and chestnuts--so there would be plenty of wholesome food for  them while they remained there.    Cap'n Bill and Trot decided to walk through the forest, to discover  what was on the other side of it, but the Ork's feet were still so sore  and \"lumpy\" from walking on the rocks that the creature said he  preferred to fly over the tree-tops and meet them on the other side.  The forest was not large, so by walking briskly for fifteen minutes  they reached its farthest edge and saw before them the shore of the  ocean.    \"It's an island, all right,\" said Trot, with a sigh.    \"Yes, and a pretty island, too,\" said Cap'n Bill, trying to conceal his  disappointment on Trot's account. \"I guess, partner, if the wuss comes  to the wuss, I could build a raft--or even a boat--from those trees,  so's we could sail away in it.\"    The little girl brightened at this suggestion. \"I don't see the Ork  anywhere,\" she remarked, looking around. Then her eyes lighted upon  something and she exclaimed: \"Oh, Cap'n Bill! Isn't that a house, over  there to the left?\"    Cap'n Bill, looking closely, saw a shed-like structure built at one  edge of the forest.    \"Seems like it, Trot. Not that I'd call it much of a house, but it's a  buildin', all right. Let's go over an' see if it's occypied.\"          Chapter Five    The Little Old Man of the Island      A few steps brought them to the shed, which was merely a roof of boughs  built over a square space, with some branches of trees fastened to the  sides to keep off the wind. The front was quite open and faced the sea,  and as our friends came nearer they observed a little man, with a long  pointed beard, sitting motionless on a stool and staring thoughtfully  out over the water.    \"Get out of the way, please,\" he called in a fretful voice. \"Can't you  see you are obstructing my view?\"    \"Good morning,\" said Cap'n Bill, politely.    \"It isn't a good morning!\" snapped the little man. \"I've seen plenty of  mornings better than this.  Do you call it a good morning when I'm  pestered with such a crowd as you?\"    Trot was astonished to hear such words from a stranger whom they had  greeted quite properly, and Cap'n Bill grew red at the little man's  rudeness. But the sailor said, in a quiet tone of voice:    \"Are you the only one as lives on this 'ere island?\"    \"Your grammar's bad,\" was the reply. \"But this is my own exclusive  island, and I'll thank you to get off it as soon as possible.\"    \"We'd like to do that,\" said Trot, and then she and Cap'n Bill turned  away and walked down to the shore, to see if any other land was in  sight.    The little man rose and followed them, although both were now too  provoked to pay any attention to him.    \"Nothin' in sight, partner,\" reported Cap'n Bill, shading his eyes with  his hand; \"so we'll have to stay here for a time, anyhow. It isn't a  bad place, Trot, by any means.\"    \"That's all you know about it!\" broke in the little man. \"The trees are  altogether too green and the rocks are harder than they ought to be. I  find the sand very grainy and the water dreadfully wet. Every breeze  makes a draught and the sun shines in the daytime, when there's no need  of it, and disappears just as soon as it begins to get dark. If you  remain here you'll find the island very unsatisfactory.\"    Trot turned to look at him, and her sweet face was grave and curious.    \"I wonder who you are,\" she said.    \"My name is Pessim,\" said he, with an air of pride. \"I'm called the  Observer.\"    \"Oh. What do you observe?\" asked the little girl.    \"Everything I see,\" was the reply, in a more surly tone. Then Pessim  drew back with a startled exclamation and looked at some footprints in  the sand. \"Why, good gracious me!\" he cried in distress.    \"What's the matter now?\" asked Cap'n Bill.    \"Someone has pushed the earth in!  Don't you see it?    \"It isn't pushed in far enough to hurt anything,\" said Trot, examining  the footprints.    \"Everything hurts that isn't right,\" insisted the man. \"If the earth  were pushed in a mile, it would be a great calamity, wouldn't it?\"    \"I s'pose so,\" admitted the little girl.    \"Well, here it is pushed in a full inch!  That's a twelfth of a foot,  or a little more than a millionth part of a mile.  Therefore it is  one-millionth part of a calamity--Oh, dear! How dreadful!\" said Pessim  in a wailing voice.    \"Try to forget it, sir,\" advised Cap'n Bill, soothingly. \"It's  beginning to rain. Let's get under your shed and keep dry.\"    \"Raining!  Is it really raining?\" asked Pessim, beginning to weep.    \"It is,\" answered Cap'n Bill, as the drops began to descend, \"and I  don't see any way to stop it--although I'm some observer myself.\"    \"No; we can't stop it, I fear,\" said the man. \"Are you very busy just  now?\"    \"I won't be after I get to the shed,\" replied the sailor-man.    \"Then do me a favor, please,\" begged Pessim, walking briskly along  behind them, for they were hastening to the shed.    \"Depends on what it is,\" said Cap'n Bill.    \"I wish you would take my umbrella down to the shore and hold it over  the poor fishes till it stops raining. I'm afraid they'll get wet,\"  said Pessim.    Trot laughed, but Cap'n Bill thought the little man was poking fun at  him and so he scowled upon Pessim in a way that showed he was angry.    They reached the shed before getting very wet, although the rain was  now coming down in big drops. The roof of the shed protected them and  while they stood watching the rainstorm something buzzed in and circled  around Pessim's head. At once the Observer began beating it away with  his hands, crying out:    \"A bumblebee! A bumblebee! The queerest bumblebee I ever saw!\"    Cap'n Bill and Trot both looked at it and the little girl said in  surprise:    \"Dear me! It's a wee little Ork!\"    \"That's what it is, sure enough,\" exclaimed Cap'n Bill.    Really, it wasn't much bigger than a big bumblebee, and when it came  toward Trot she allowed it to alight on her shoulder.    \"It's me, all right,\" said a very small voice in her ear; \"but I'm in  an awful pickle, just the same!\"    \"What, are you our Ork, then?\" demanded the girl, much amazed.    \"No, I'm my own Ork. But I'm the only Ork you know,\" replied the tiny  creature.    \"What's happened to you?\" asked the sailor, putting his head close to  Trot's shoulder in order to hear the reply better. Pessim also put his  head close, and the Ork said:    \"You will remember that when I left you I started to fly over the  trees, and just as I got to this side of the forest I saw a bush that  was loaded down with the most luscious fruit you can imagine.  The  fruit was about the size of a gooseberry and of a lovely lavender  color. So I swooped down and picked off one in my bill and ate it. At  once I began to grow small. I could feel myself shrinking, shrinking  away, and it frightened me terribly, so that I lighted on the ground to  think over what was happening. In a few seconds I had shrunk to the  size you now see me; but there I remained, getting no smaller, indeed,  but no larger. It is certainly a dreadful affliction! After I had  recovered somewhat from the shock I began to search for you. It is not  so easy to find one's way when a creature is so small, but fortunately  I spied you here in this shed and came to you at once.\"    Cap'n Bill and Trot were much astonished at this story and felt grieved  for the poor Ork, but the little man Pessim seemed to think it a good  joke. He began laughing when he heard the story and laughed until he  choked, after which he lay down on the ground and rolled and laughed  again, while the tears of merriment coursed down his wrinkled cheeks.    \"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\" he finally gasped, sitting up and wiping his  eyes. \"This is too rich! It's almost too joyful to be true.\"    \"I don't see anything funny about it,\" remarked Trot indignantly.    \"You would if you'd had my experience,\" said Pessim, getting upon his  feet and gradually resuming his solemn and dissatisfied expression of  countenance. \"The same thing happened to me.\"    \"Oh, did it?  And how did you happen to come to this island?\" asked the  girl.    \"I didn't come; the neighbors brought me,\" replied the little man, with  a frown at the recollection. \"They said I was quarrelsome and  fault-finding and blamed me because I told them all the things that  went wrong, or never were right, and because I told them how things  ought to be. So they brought me here and left me all alone, saying that  if I quarreled with myself, no one else would be made unhappy. Absurd,  wasn't it?\"    \"Seems to me,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"those neighbors did the proper thing.\"    \"Well,\" resumed Pessim, \"when I found myself King of this island I was  obliged to live upon fruits, and I found many fruits growing here that  I had never seen before. I tasted several and found them good and  wholesome. But one day I ate a lavender berry--as the Ork did--and  immediately I grew so small that I was scarcely two inches high. It was  a very unpleasant condition and like the Ork I became frightened. I  could not walk very well nor very far, for every lump of earth in my  way seemed a mountain, every blade of grass a tree and every grain of  sand a rocky boulder. For several days I stumbled around in an agony of  fear. Once a tree toad nearly gobbled me up, and if I ran out from the  shelter of the bushes the gulls and cormorants swooped down upon me.  Finally I decided to eat another berry and become nothing at all, since  life, to one as small as I was, had become a dreary nightmare.    \"At last I found a small tree that I thought bore the same fruit as  that I had eaten. The berry was dark purple instead of light lavender,  but otherwise it was quite similar. Being unable to climb the tree, I  was obliged to wait"]]]
