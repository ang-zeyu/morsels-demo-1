[Footnote: This is an exaggeration.] It is the  knowledge of this fact that makes British naval officers when  searching for deserters from their service, so harsh in their  scrutiny, and so sceptical of American oaths and asseverations.\"    The last sentence of the foregoing from James is an euphemistic  way of saying that whenever a British commander short of men came  across an American vessel he impressed all of her crew that he  wanted, whether they were citizens of the United States or not. It  must be remembered, however, that the only reason why Great Britain  did us more injury than any other power was because she was better  able to do so. None of her acts were more offensive than Napoleon's  Milan decree, by which it was declared that any neutral vessel which  permitted itself to be searched by a British cruiser should be  considered as British, and as the lawful prize of any French vessel.  French frigates and privateers were very apt to snap up any American  vessel they came across and were only withheld at all by the memory  of the sharp dressing they had received in the West Indies during  the quasi-war of 1799-1800. What we undoubtedly ought to have done  was to have adopted the measure actually proposed in Congress, and  declared war on both France and England. As it was, we chose as a  foe the one that had done, and could still do, us the greatest injury.    The principles for which the United States contended in 1812 are  now universally accepted, and those so tenaciously maintained by  Great Britain find no advocates in the civilized world. That England  herself was afterward completely reconciled to our views was amply  shown by her intense indignation when Commodore Wilkes, in the  exercise of the right of search for the persons of the foes of his  country, stopped the neutral British ship _Trent_; while the applause  with which the act was greeted in America proves pretty clearly  another fact, that we had warred for the right, not because it  _was_ the right, but because it agreed with our self-interest to do  so. We were contending for \"Free Trade and Sailors' Rights\": meaning  by the former expression, freedom to trade wherever we chose without  hindrance save from the power with whom we were trading; and by the  latter, that a man who happened to be on the sea should have the  same protection accorded to a man who remained on land. Nominally,  neither of these questions was settled by, or even alluded to, in  the treaty of peace; but the immense increase of reputation that  the navy acquired during the war practically decided both points  in our favor. Our sailors had gained too great a name for any one  to molest them with impunity again.    Holding views on these maritime subjects so radically different  from each other, the two nations could not but be continually dealing  with causes of quarrel. Not only did British cruisers molest our  merchant-men, but at length one of them, the 50-gun ship _Leopard_,  attacked an American frigate, the _Chesapeake_, when the latter was  so lumbered up that she could not return a shot, killed or disabled  some twenty of her men and took away four others, one Briton and  three Americans, who were claimed as deserters. For this act an  apology was offered, but it failed to restore harmony between  the two nations. Soon afterward another action was fought. The  American frigate _President_, Commodore Rodgers, attacked the  British sloop _Little Belt_, Captain Bingham, and exchanged one  or two broadsides with her,--the frigate escaping scot-free  while the sloop was nearly knocked to pieces. Mutual recriminations  followed, each side insisting that the other was the assailant.    When Great Britain issued her Orders in Council forbidding our  trading with France, we retaliated by passing an embargo act, which  prevented us from trading at all. There could be but one result to  such a succession of incidents, and that was war. Accordingly, in  June, 1812, war was declared; and as a contest for the rights of  seamen, it was largely waged on the ocean. We also had not a little  fighting to do on land, in which, as a rule, we came out second-best.  Few or no preparations for the war had been made, and the result  was such as might have been anticipated. After dragging on through  three dreary and uneventful years it came to an end in 1815, by a  peace which left matters in almost precisely the state in which  the war had found them. On land and water the contest took the form  of a succession of petty actions, in which the glory acquired by  the victor seldom eclipsed the disgrace incurred by the vanquished.  Neither side succeeded in doing what it intended. Americans declared  that Canada must and should be conquered, but the conquering came  quite as near being the other way. British writers insisted that  the American navy should be swept from the sea; and, during the  sweeping process it increased fourfold.    When the United States declared war, Great Britain was straining  every nerve and muscle in a death struggle with the most formidable  military despotism of modern times, and was obliged to entrust the  defence of her Canadian colonies to a mere handful of regulars, aided  by the local fencibles. But Congress had provided even fewer trained  soldiers, and relied on militia. The latter chiefly exercised their  fighting abilities upon one another in duelling, and, as a rule,  were afflicted with conscientious scruples whenever it was  necessary to cross the frontier and attack the enemy. Accordingly,  the campaign opened with the bloodless surrender of an American  general to a much inferior British force, and the war continued  much as it had begun; we suffered disgrace after disgrace, while  the losses we inflicted, in turn, on Great Britain were so slight  as hardly to attract her attention. At last, having crushed her  greater foe, she turned to crush the lesser, and, in her turn,  suffered ignominious defeat. By this time events had gradually  developed a small number of soldiers on our northern frontier,  who, commanded by Scott and Brown, were able to contend on equal  terms with the veteran troops to whom they were opposed, though  these formed part of what was then undoubtedly the most formidable  fighting infantry any European nation possessed. The battles at  this period of the struggle were remarkable for the skill and  stubborn courage with which they were waged, as well as for the  heavy loss involved; but the number of combatants was so small  that in Europe they would have been regarded as mere outpost  skirmishes, and they wholly failed to attract any attention  abroad in that period of colossal armies.    When Great Britain seriously turned her attention to her  transatlantic foe, and assembled in Canada an army of 14,000 men  at the head of Lake Champlain, Congressional forethought enabled  it to be opposed by soldiers who, it is true, were as well  disciplined, as hardy, and as well commanded as any in the world,  but who were only a few hundred strong, backed by more or less  incompetent militia. Only Macdonough's skill and Sir George  Prevost's incapacity saved us from a serious disaster; the sea-fight  reflected high honor on our seamen, but the retreat of the British  land-forces was due to their commander and not their antagonists.  Meanwhile a large British fleet in the Chesapeake had not achieved  much glory by the destruction of local oyster-boats and the burning  of a few farmers' houses, so an army was landed to strike a decisive  blow. At Bladensburg [Footnote: See the \"Capture of Washington,\"  by Edward D. Ingraham (Philadelphia. 1849).] the five thousand  British regulars, utterly worn out by heat and fatigue, by their  mere appearance, frightened into a panic double their number of  American militia well posted. But the only success attained was  burning the public buildings of Washington, and that result was  of dubious value. Baltimore was attacked next, and the attack  repulsed, after the forts and ships had shelled one another with  the slight results that usually attend that spectacular and harmless  species of warfare.    The close of the contest was marked by the extraordinary battle of  New Orleans. It was a perfectly useless shedding of blood, since  peace had already been declared. There is hardly another contest of  modern times where the defeated side suffered such frightful carnage,  while the victors came off almost scatheless. It is quite in  accordance with the rest of the war that the militia, hitherto worse  than useless, should on this occasion win against great odds in point  of numbers; and, moreover, that their splendid victory should have  been of little consequence in its effects upon the result. On the  whole, the contest by land, where we certainly ought to have been  successful, reflected greater credit on our antagonists than upon  us, in spite of the services of Scott, Brown, and Jackson. Our small  force of regulars and volunteers did excellently; as for the militia,  New Orleans proved that they _could_ fight superbly, and the other  battles that they generally _would not_ fight at all.    At sea, as will appear, the circumstances were widely different.  Here we possessed a small but highly effective force, the ships  well built, manned by thoroughly trained men, and commanded by  able and experienced officers. The deeds of our navy form a part  of history over which any American can be pardoned for lingering.           *       *        *       *        *    Such was the origin, issue, and general character of the war.

With such people the grey head is but the impression  of the old fellow's hand in giving them his blessing, and every wrinkle  but a notch in the quiet calendar of a well-spent life.    The person whom the traveller had so abruptly encountered was of  this kind: bluff, hale, hearty, and in a green old age: at peace with  himself, and evidently disposed to be so with all the world. Although  muffled up in divers coats and handkerchiefs--one of which, passed over  his crown, and tied in a convenient crease of his double chin, secured  his three-cornered hat and bob-wig from blowing off his head--there  was no disguising his plump and comfortable figure; neither did certain  dirty finger-marks upon his face give it any other than an odd and  comical expression, through which its natural good humour shone with  undiminished lustre.    'He is not hurt,' said the traveller at length, raising his head and the  lantern together.    'You have found that out at last, have you?' rejoined the old man. 'My  eyes have seen more light than yours, but I wouldn't change with you.'    'What do you mean?'    'Mean! I could have told you he wasn't hurt, five minutes ago. Give me  the light, friend; ride forward at a gentler pace; and good night.'    In handing up the lantern, the man necessarily cast its rays full on the  speaker's face. Their eyes met at the instant. He suddenly dropped it  and crushed it with his foot.    'Did you never see a locksmith before, that you start as if you had come  upon a ghost?' cried the old man in the chaise, 'or is this,' he added  hastily, thrusting his hand into the tool basket and drawing out a  hammer, 'a scheme for robbing me? I know these roads, friend. When I  travel them, I carry nothing but a few shillings, and not a crown's  worth of them. I tell you plainly, to save us both trouble, that there's  nothing to be got from me but a pretty stout arm considering my years,  and this tool, which, mayhap from long acquaintance with, I can use  pretty briskly. You shall not have it all your own way, I promise you,  if you play at that game. With these words he stood upon the defensive.    'I am not what you take me for, Gabriel Varden,' replied the other.    'Then what and who are you?' returned the locksmith. 'You know my name,  it seems. Let me know yours.'    'I have not gained the information from any confidence of yours, but  from the inscription on your cart which tells it to all the town,'  replied the traveller.    'You have better eyes for that than you had for your horse, then,' said  Varden, descending nimbly from his chaise; 'who are you? Let me see your  face.'    While the locksmith alighted, the traveller had regained his saddle,  from which he now confronted the old man, who, moving as the horse moved  in chafing under the tightened rein, kept close beside him.    'Let me see your face, I say.'    'Stand off!'    'No masquerading tricks,' said the locksmith, 'and tales at the club  to-morrow, how Gabriel Varden was frightened by a surly voice and a dark  night. Stand--let me see your face.'    Finding that further resistance would only involve him in a personal  struggle with an antagonist by no means to be despised, the traveller  threw back his coat, and stooping down looked steadily at the locksmith.    Perhaps two men more powerfully contrasted, never opposed each other  face to face. The ruddy features of the locksmith so set off and  heightened the excessive paleness of the man on horseback, that he  looked like a bloodless ghost, while the moisture, which hard riding had  brought out upon his skin, hung there in dark and heavy drops, like dews  of agony and death. The countenance of the old locksmith lighted up with  the smile of one expecting to detect in this unpromising stranger some  latent roguery of eye or lip, which should reveal a familiar person in  that arch disguise, and spoil his jest. The face of the other, sullen  and fierce, but shrinking too, was that of a man who stood at bay; while  his firmly closed jaws, his puckered mouth, and more than all a certain  stealthy motion of the hand within his breast, seemed to announce a  desperate purpose very foreign to acting, or child's play.    Thus they regarded each other for some time, in silence.    'Humph!' he said when he had scanned his features; 'I don't know you.'    'Don't desire to?'--returned the other, muffling himself as before.    'I don't,' said Gabriel; 'to be plain with you, friend, you don't carry  in your countenance a letter of recommendation.'    'It's not my wish,' said the traveller. 'My humour is to be avoided.'    'Well,' said the locksmith bluntly, 'I think you'll have your humour.'    'I will, at any cost,' rejoined the traveller. 'In proof of it, lay this  to heart--that you were never in such peril of your life as you have  been within these few moments; when you are within five minutes of  breathing your last, you will not be nearer death than you have been  to-night!'    'Aye!' said the sturdy locksmith.    'Aye! and a violent death.'    'From whose hand?'    'From mine,' replied the traveller.    With that he put spurs to his horse, and rode away; at first plashing  heavily through the mire at a smart trot, but gradually increasing in  speed until the last sound of his horse's hoofs died away upon the wind;  when he was again hurrying on at the same furious gallop, which had been  his pace when the locksmith first encountered him.    Gabriel Varden remained standing in the road with the broken lantern in  his hand, listening in stupefied silence until no sound reached his ear  but the moaning of the wind, and the fast-falling rain; when he struck  himself one or two smart blows in the breast by way of rousing himself,  and broke into an exclamation of surprise.    'What in the name of wonder can this fellow be! a madman? a highwayman?  a cut-throat? If he had not scoured off so fast, we'd have seen who was  in most danger, he or I. I never nearer death than I have been to-night!  I hope I may be no nearer to it for a score of years to come--if so,  I'll be content to be no farther from it. My stars!--a pretty brag this  to a stout man--pooh, pooh!'    Gabriel resumed his seat, and looked wistfully up the road by which the  traveller had come; murmuring in a half whisper:    'The Maypole--two miles to the Maypole. I came the other road from the  Warren after a long day's work at locks and bells, on purpose that I  should not come by the Maypole and break my promise to Martha by looking  in--there's resolution! It would be dangerous to go on to London without  a light; and it's four miles, and a good half mile besides, to the  Halfway-House; and between this and that is the very place where one  needs a light most. Two miles to the Maypole! I told Martha I wouldn't;  I said I wouldn't, and I didn't--there's resolution!'    Repeating these two last words very often, as if to compensate for the  little resolution he was going to show by piquing himself on the great  resolution he had shown, Gabriel Varden quietly turned back, determining  to get a light at the Maypole, and to take nothing but a light.    When he got to the Maypole, however, and Joe, responding to his  well-known hail, came running out to the horse's head, leaving the door  open behind him, and disclosing a delicious perspective of warmth and  brightness--when the ruddy gleam of the fire, streaming through the old  red curtains of the common room, seemed to bring with it, as part of  itself, a pleasant hum of voices, and a fragrant odour of steaming grog  and rare tobacco, all steeped as it were in the cheerful glow--when the  shadows, flitting across the curtain, showed that those inside had risen  from their snug seats, and were making room in the snuggest corner (how  well he knew that corner!) for the honest locksmith, and a broad glare,  suddenly streaming up, bespoke the goodness of the crackling log from  which a brilliant train of sparks was doubtless at that moment whirling  up the chimney in honour of his coming--when, superadded to these  enticements, there stole upon him from the distant kitchen a gentle  sound of frying, with a musical clatter of plates and dishes, and a  savoury smell that made even the boisterous wind a perfume--Gabriel  felt his firmness oozing rapidly away. He tried to look stoically at the  tavern, but his features would relax into a look of fondness. He turned  his head the other way, and the cold black country seemed to frown him  off, and drive him for a refuge into its hospitable arms.    'The merciful man, Joe,' said the locksmith, 'is merciful to his beast.  I'll get out for a little while.'    And how natural it was to get out! And how unnatural it seemed for a  sober man to be plodding wearily along through miry roads, encountering  the rude buffets of the wind and pelting of the rain, when there was  a clean floor covered with crisp white sand, a well swept hearth, a  blazing fire, a table decorated with white cloth, bright pewter flagons,  and other tempting preparations for a well-cooked meal--when there were  these things, and company disposed to make the most of them, all ready  to his hand, and entreating him to enjoyment!        Chapter 3      Such were the locksmith's thoughts when first seated in the snug corner,  and slowly recovering from a pleasant defect of vision--pleasant,  because occasioned by the wind blowing in his eyes--which made it a  matter of sound policy and duty to himself, that he should take refuge  from the weather, and tempted him, for the same reason, to aggravate  a slight cough, and declare he felt but poorly. Such were still his  thoughts more than a full hour afterwards, when, supper over, he still  sat with shining jovial face in the same warm nook, listening to the  cricket-like chirrup of"]]]
