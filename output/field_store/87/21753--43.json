[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59970"],[0,"The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet (#6)"],[1,"fourteen is seldom the object of universal  conversation and comment in his locality; yet this youth's enemies did  not rest short of lifting him to an eminence where he could the better  be seen and scorned of all men.    His family were made to share the vindictiveness and contumely  exhibited toward him which at last reached such a pitch that an attempt  was actually made to assassinate him. The family, on hearing the report  of the gun, rushed from the house only to find the marks made by the  crouching murderer at the side of the path, and the leaden missiles  embedded a short distance from the spot.    But persecution, slander and cruel outrage were all unable to change  the steadfast testimony of Joseph. Three years passed away, during  which time he was true to his trust through toil and poverty, through  scorn and tribulation. The heavens no more opened to his view in  this trying period; but the youth, who was fast maturing--growing in  strength and understanding--was able to show the staunchness of his  nature while he waited in patience and humility for the additional  light which he had been led to expect.    Yet Joseph was human, with human loves and human wants. He sorrowed to  find himself and his kindred cast off by all their old associates, and  he at times was forced into the society of persons who made few or no  pretensions to religion.    Doubtless the avowed infidels and unbelievers, whom he thus  occasionally met, were no more lacking in genuine purity than were  the self-righteous enthusiasts who shunned him except when they  could devise some means for persecution and torture. But he had not  yet learned to justly weigh the virtues and failings of others; and  often he reproached himself with sinfulness because of his enforced  associations. His quick conscience was apt to exaggerate every youthful  foible, and he regarded many of his acts of thoughtlessness as offenses  at which the Heavens must frown.    At last he felt the imperative need of light and help from the source  whence flows all truth. He acknowledged that he had fallen into many  foolish errors and youthful weaknesses; and he prayed without ceasing  for the pardon of every wrong which he had done. He plead earnestly  that he might gain greater knowledge for his guidance, and asked for  a manifestation, from which he might know concerning his state and  standing before the Lord. Despite his own self-accusation, the answer  to his prayer proves that his probationary period had been passed  satisfactorily to the Heavens and that he was still unstained by any  dark offense.        CHAPTER IV.    THE ANGEL MORONI VISITS JOSEPH THRICE IN THE NIGHT--A RECORD TO BE  BROUGHT FORTH--VISION OF CUMORAH.    It was on the night of the 21st of September, in the year 1823, that  Joseph, having retired to his humble room, invoked an answer to his  petition unto the Lord. While lying upon his bed thus seeking with all  the power of his spirit, the usual darkness of the room began to fade  away and a spreading glory appeared, which increased until the room was  lighter than at noonday. In the midst of this light, which was most  brilliant around his person, stood a radiant being, whose countenance  was more bright than vivid lightning and was marvelously lovely. He  seemed of greater stature than an ordinary man and moved and stood  without touching the floor. He was clothed in a robe of intense and  dazzling whiteness, far exceeding anything of an earthly character; and  his hands and wrists and feet and ankles, as well as his head and neck,  were bare. The glorious personage stood at Joseph's bedside; and to the  awed youth, in a voice of tenderness and comfort, calling Joseph by  name, the angel announced himself to be a messenger from the presence  of the Almighty, and that his name was Moroni. The holy visitor then  proceeded to unfold some of the grand purposes of the Lord. He said  that through Joseph, God's power and kingdom were to be restored to  earth; that Joseph's name should go out to all nations, kindred and  tongues, to be blessed by the pure reviled by the unholy--that it  should be both good and evil spoken of among all people; that in the  fulfillment of this mission, Joseph would be led to a hill, where was  buried an ancient record engraved upon plates of gold, which record was  a history of the nations that had inhabited the American continent,  and furthermore contained the fulness of the Gospel as given during  the administration of Jesus on this land. He said that with the plates  were hidden two sacred stones, set in a bow of silver fastened to a  breastplate, and called Urim and Thummim, by the possession and use of  which, men in ancient times had become seers, and by means of which,  aided by the inspiration of Heaven, Joseph also would become a seer and  be able to read and translate the engraven record.    While the angel was thus speaking, Joseph was enabled in vision to  see clearly and distinctly the holy hill and its environs, and the  particular spot upon the hillside where the plates were held in silent  trust. Moroni resumed his teachings, saying that the hour had not yet  come for the translation of the record, but Joseph must prepare his  mind by prayer and thought for the exalted duties and blessings which  awaited him; and he most solemnly warned the youth, on penalty of sure  destruction, against showing the hidden treasures to anyone except by  commandment of God. Before taking his leave, the angelic messenger  rehearsed much of ancient prophecy relating to the restoration of  all holiness, the second coming of our Savior and His dominion upon  earth; he explained many scriptural utterances; and of the wicked and  unbelieving blasphemies, he spoke in such a sorrowful yet terrible  voice that these words seemed to still the beating of the listener's  heart:    \"FOR BEHOLD, THE DAY COMETH THAT SHALL BURN AS AN OVEN; AND ALL THE  PROUD, YEA AND ALL THAT DO WICKEDLY SHALL BURN AS STUBBLE!\"    Among many commands and promises, Moroni gave this assurance from the  Lord to Joseph:    \"BEHOLD, I WILL REVEAL UNTO YOU THE PRIESTHOOD BY THE HAND OF ELIJAH  THE PROPHET, BEFORE THE COMING OF THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE  LORD.\"    As the angel ceased to speak, all the light of the room gathered to his  person. Above him all earthly things seemed moved away and a shining  pillar was stretching heavenward. With a look of hope and blessing upon  the youth, Moroni ascended; and when he disappeared, darkness again  fell about the bedside.    Powerful emotions crowded upon Joseph's mind as he recalled the things  which had been revealed to him. And while he yet pondered, once more  Moroni came and stood in a blazing glory and repeated solemnly the  heavenly lessons to the listening youth, adding that great judgments  were coming upon the earth, and that grievous desolations should be  poured out during this present generation.    Again Moroni ascended as before; and yet for the third time he  returned to repeat the message of which he was the bearer. The solemn  instructions were once more given, and with them a special warning  concerning the plates of gold and the sacred stones. He told Joseph  that by reason of the poverty of himself and family, Satan would try  to tempt him to use them for the purpose of getting rich, and that if  he had any other motive than the glory of God, they would be withheld.  Many hours had passed in this communion, and when the heavenly  ambassador disappeared for the third time, Joseph heard the birds of  the air heralding the coming of the dawn.        CHAPTER V.    A MID-DAY VISITATION--JOSEPH CONFIDES IN HIS EARTHLY FATHER--CUMORAH  AND THE SACRED BOX--NEW PROBATION IS FIXED--SUCCESSIVE VISITS AND  MINISTRATIONS OF THE ANGEL--JOSEPH'S GROWTH IN GODLINESS.    At his usual hour of arising, Joseph left his bed, and according to  his custom went to labor in the field. The experiences of the night  had swept all color from his face. His mind was filled with thoughts  unutterable, and his attention was fixed beyond his earthly toil. His  father observed that the boy seemed weak, and acted strangely, and told  him to go home. Joseph started from the field towards the house, but on  his way, in attempting to cross a fence, he sank helpless to the earth.  He was recalled from a partial swoon by a voice which gently spoke his  name. He looked up and saw the same glorious messenger standing above  his head, clothed about with an effulgence which eclipsed the splendor  of the noonday sun.    Once more the angel told the truths of the night before, with their  commands and warnings, and he instructed Joseph to return to his  father, and impart to him that which he had learned of the purposes  of God. He obeyed at once, and standing there in the harvest field,  related to his father all that had passed. The inspiration of heaven  rested upon the elder Joseph as he heard the lad's words; and when the  account was finished, he said \"My son, these things are of God; take  heed that you proceed in all holiness to do His will.\"    Having the consent and blessing of his earthly father, Joseph departed  to visit the hill. And now, within a few hours of its utterance, was  one of the angel's predictions fulfilled. During the journey of two or  three miles beyond Manchester toward the hill which had been pointed  out to him in vision, Joseph was made to feel within him the striving  of two invisible powers. On the one hand, the evil one presented  alluring prospects of worldly gain from the possession of the plates of  gold--on the other, the better influence whispered that the record was  sacred and must only be used for the glory of God and the fulfillment  of His purposes. In this frame of mind he approached the spot which  he had seen in vision. It was on the west side and near the top of a  hill which stood higher than any other in that neighborhood.

Moliere tells us that he wrote \"Les Facheux\"  in a fortnight; and a French critic adds that it reads indeed as if it  had been written in, a fortnight. Perhaps a self-confident censor might  venture a similar opinion about \"Guy Mannering.\" It assuredly shows  traces of haste; the plot wanders at its own will; and we may believe  that the Author often--did not see his own way out of the wood. But there  is little harm in that. \"If I do not know what is coming next,\" a modern  novelist has remarked, \"how can the public know?\" Curiosity, at least, is  likely to be excited by this happy-go-lucky manner of Scott's. \"The worst  of it is;\" as he wrote to Lady Abercorn about his poems (June 9,1808),  \"that I am not very good or patient in slow and careful composition; and  sometimes I remind myself of the drunken man, who could run long after he  could not walk.\" Scott could certainly run very well, though averse to a  plodding motion.    [He was probably thinking of a famous Edinburgh character, \"Singing Jamie  Balfour.\" Jamie was found very drunk and adhering to the pavement one  night. He could not raise himself; but when helped to his feet, ran his  preserver a race to the tavern, and won!]    The account of the year's work which preceded \"Guy Mannering\" is given by  Lockhart, and is astounding. In 1814 Scott had written, Lockhart  believes, the greater part of the \"Life of Swift,\" most of \"Waverley\" and  the \"Lord of the Isles;\" he had furnished essays to the \"Encyclopaedia,\"  and had edited \"The Memorie of the Somervilles.\" The spider might well  seem spun out, the tilth exhausted. But Scott had a fertility, a  spontaneity, of fancy equalled only, if equalled at all, by Alexandre  Dumas.    On November 7 of this laborious year, 1814, Scott was writing to Mr.  Joseph Train, thanking him for a parcel of legendary lore, including the  Galloway tale of the wandering astrologer and a budget of gypsy  traditions.  Falling in the rich soil of Scott's imagination, the tale of  the astrologer yielded a name and an opening to \"Guy Mannering,\" while  the gypsy lore blossomed into the legend of Meg Merrilies. The seed of  the novel was now sown. But between November 11 and December 25 Scott was  writing the three last cantos of the \"Lord of the Isles.\" Yet before the  \"Lord of the Isles\" was published (Jan. 18, 1815), two volumes of \"Guy  Mannering\" were in print  (Letter to Morritt, Jan. 17, 1815.) The novel  was issued on Feb. 14, 1815. Scott, as he says somewhere, was like the  turnspit dog, into whose wheel a hot cinder is dropped to encourage his  activity. Scott needed hot cinders in the shape of proof-sheets fresh  from the press, and he worked most busily when the printer's devil was  waiting. In this case, not only the printer's devil, but the wolf was at  the door. The affairs of the Ballantynes clamoured for moneys In their  necessity and his own, Scott wrote at the rate of a volume in ten days,  and for some financial reason published \"Guy Mannering\" with Messrs.  Longmans, not with Constable. Scott was at this moment facing creditors  and difficulties as Napoleon faced the armies of the Allies,--present  everywhere, everywhere daring and successful. True, his \"Lord of the  Isles\" was a disappointment, as James Ballantyne informed him. \"'Well,  James, so be it; but you know we must not droop, for we cannot afford to  give over. Since one line has failed, we must just stick to something  else.' And so he dismissed me, and resumed his novel.\"    In these circumstances, far from inspiring, was \"Guy Mannering\" written  and hurried through the press. The story has its own history: one can  watch the various reminiscences and experiences of life that crystallized  together in Scott's mind, and grouped themselves fantastically into his  unpremeditated plot. Sir Walter gives, in the preface of 1829, the legend  which he heard from John MacKinlay, his father's Highland servant, and on  which he meant to found a tale more in Hawthorn's manner than in his own.  That plan he changed in the course of printing, \"leaving only just enough  of astrology to annoy pedantic reviewers and foolish Puritans.\" Whence  came the rest of the plot,--the tale of the long-lost heir, and so on?  The true heir, \"kept out of his own,\" and returning in disguise, has been  a favourite character ever since Homer sang of Odysseus, and probably  long before that. But it is just possible that Scott had a certain modern  instance in his mind. In turning over the old manuscript diary at  Branxholme Park (mentioned in a note to \"Waverley\"), the Editor lighted  on a singular tale, which, in the diarist's opinion, might have suggested  \"Guy Mannering\" to Sir Walter. The resemblance between the story of  Vanbeest Brown and the hero of the diarist was scanty; but in a long  letter of Scott's to Lady Abercorn (May 21, 1813), a the Editor finds Sir  Walter telling his correspondent the very narrative recorded in the  Branxholme Park diary. Singular things happen, Sir Walter says; and he  goes on to describe a case just heard in the court where he is sitting as  Clerk of Sessions. Briefly, the anecdote is this: A certain Mr.  Carruthers of Dormont had reason to suspect his wife's fidelity. While  proceedings for a divorce were pending, Mrs. Carruthers bore a daughter,  of whom her husband, of course, was legally the father. But he did not  believe in the relationship, and sent the infant girl to be brought up,  in ignorance of her origin and in seclusion, among the Cheviot Hills.  Here she somehow learned the facts of her own story. She married a Mr.  Routledge, the son of a yeoman, and \"compounded\" her rights (but not  those of her issue) for a small sung of ready money, paid by old Dormont.  She bears a boy; then she and her husband died in poverty. Their son was  sent by a friend to the East Indies, and was presented with a packet of  papers, which he left unopened at a lawyer's. The young man made a  fortune in India, returned to Scotland, and took a shooting in  Dumfriesshire, near bormont, his ancestral home. He lodged at a small inn  hard by, and the landlady, struck by his name, began to gossip with him  about his family history. He knew nothing of the facts which the landlady  disclosed, but, impressed by her story, sent for and examined his  neglected packet of papers. Then he sought legal opinion, and was  advised, by President Blair, that he had a claim worth presenting on the  estate of Dormont. \"The first decision of the cause,\" writes Scott, \"was  favourable.\" The true heir celebrated his legal victory by a  dinner-party, and his friends saluted him as \"Dormont.\" Next morning he  was found dead. Such is the true tale. As it occupied Scott's mind in  1813, and as he wrote \"Guy Mannering\" in 1814-15, it is not impossible  that he may have borrowed his wandering heir, who returns by pure  accident to his paternal domains, and there learns his origin at a  woman's lips, from the Dormont case. The resemblance of the stories, at  least, was close enough to strike a shrewd observer some seventy years  ago.    Another possible source of the plot--a more romantic origin,  certainly--is suggested by Mr. Robert Chambers in \"Illustrations of the  Author of 'Waverley.'\" A Maxwell of Glenormiston, \"a religious and  bigoted recluse,\" sent his only son and heir to a Jesuit College in  Flanders, left his estate in his brother's management, and died. The  wicked uncle alleged that the heir was also dead. The child, ignorant of  his birth, grew up, ran away from the Jesuits at the age of sixteen,  enlisted in the French army, fought at Fontenoy, got his colours, and,  later, landed in the Moray Firth as a French officer in 1745. He went  through the campaign, was in hiding in Lochaber after Drumossie, and in  making for a Galloway port, was seized, and imprisoned in Dumfries. Here  an old woman of his father's household recognized him by \"a mark which  she remembered on his body.\" His cause was taken up by friends; but the  usurping uncle died, and Sir Robert Maxwell recovered his estates without  a lawsuit. This anecdote is quoted from the \"New Monthly Magazine,\" June,  1819. There is nothing to prove that Scott was acquainted with this  adventure. Scott's own experience, as usual, supplied him with hints for  his characters. The phrase of Dominie Sampson's father, \"Please God, my  bairn may live to wag his pow in a pulpit,\" was uttered in his own  hearing. There was a Bluegown, or Bedesman, like Edie Ochiltree, who had  a son at Edinburgh College. Scott was kind to the son, the Bluegown asked  him to dinner, and at this meal the old man made the remark about the  pulpit and the pow.' A similar tale is told by Scott in the Introduction  to \"The Antiquary\" (1830). As for the good Dominie, Scott remarks that,  for \"certain particular reasons,\" he must say what he has to say about  his prototype \"very generally.\" Mr. Chambers' finds the prototype in a  Mr. James Sanson, tutor in the house of Mr. Thomas Scott, Sir Walter's  uncle. It seems very unlike Sir Walter to mention this excellent man  almost by his name, and the tale about his devotion to his patron's  daughter cannot, apparently, be true of Mr. James Sanson. The prototype  of Pleydell, according to Sir Walter himself (Journal, June 19, 1830),  was \"my old friend Adam Rolland, Esq., in external circumstances, but not  in frolic or fancy.\" Mr. Chambers, however, finds the original in Mr.  Andrew Crosbie, an advocate of great talents, who frolicked to ruin, and  died in 1785. Scott may have heard tales of this patron of \"High Jinks,\"  but cannot have known him much personally. Dandie Dinmont is simply the  typical Border farmer. Mr. Shortreed, Scott's companion in his Liddesdale  raids, thought that Willie Elliot, in Millburnholm, was the great  original. Scott did not meet Mr."]]]
