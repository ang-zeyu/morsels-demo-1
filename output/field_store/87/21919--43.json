As for myself, I will shoot for this same golden arrow, and  should I win it, we will hang it to the branches of our good greenwood  tree for the joy of all the band. How like you the plan, my merry men  all?\"    Then \"Good, good!\" cried all the band right heartily.    A fair sight was Nottingham Town on the day of the shooting match. All  along upon the green meadow beneath the town wall stretched a row of  benches, one above the other, which were for knight and lady, squire and  dame, and rich burghers and their wives; for none but those of rank and  quality were to sit there. At the end of the range, near the target, was  a raised seat bedecked with ribbons and scarfs and garlands of flowers,  for the Sheriff of Nottingham and his dame.  The range was twoscore  paces broad. At one end stood the target, at the other a tent of striped  canvas, from the pole of which fluttered many-colored flags and  streamers. In this booth were casks of ale, free to be broached by any  of the archers who might wish to quench their thirst.    Across the range from where the seats for the better folk were raised  was a railing to keep the poorer people from crowding in front of the  target.  Already, while it was early, the benches were beginning to fill  with people of quality, who kept constantly arriving in little carts or  upon palfreys that curveted gaily to the merry tinkle of silver bells at  bridle reins. With these came also the poorer folk, who sat or lay upon  the green grass near the railing that kept them from off the range. In  the great tent the archers were gathering by twos and threes; some  talking loudly of the fair shots each man had made in his day; some  looking well to their bows, drawing a string betwixt the fingers to see  that there was no fray upon it, or inspecting arrows, shutting one eye  and peering down a shaft to see that it was not warped, but straight and  true, for neither bow nor shaft should fail at such a time and for such  a prize. And never was such a company of yeomen as were gathered at  Nottingham Town that day, for the very best archers of merry England had  come to this shooting match. There was Gill o' the Red Cap, the  Sheriff's own head archer, and Diccon Cruikshank of Lincoln Town, and  Adam o' the Dell, a man of Tamworth, of threescore years and more, yet  hale and lusty still, who in his time had shot in the famous match at  Woodstock, and had there beaten that renowned archer, Clym o' the  Clough.  And many more famous men of the longbow were there, whose names  have been handed down to us in goodly ballads of the olden time.    But now all the benches were filled with guests, lord and lady, burgher  and dame, when at last the Sheriff himself came with his lady, he riding  with stately mien upon his milk-white horse and she upon her brown  filly.  Upon his head he wore a purple velvet cap, and purple velvet was  his robe, all trimmed about with rich ermine; his jerkin and hose were  of sea-green silk, and his shoes of black velvet, the pointed toes  fastened to his garters with golden chains.  A golden chain hung about  his neck, and at his collar was a great carbuncle set in red gold. His  lady was dressed in blue velvet, all trimmed with swan's down. So they  made a gallant sight as they rode along side by side, and all the people  shouted from where they crowded across the space from the gentlefolk; so  the Sheriff and his lady came to their place, where men-at-arms, with  hauberk and spear, stood about, waiting for them.    Then when the Sheriff and his dame had sat down, he bade his herald wind  upon his silver horn; who thereupon sounded three blasts that came  echoing cheerily back from the gray walls of Nottingham.  Then the  archers stepped forth to their places, while all the folks shouted with  a mighty voice, each man calling upon his favorite yeoman.  \"Red Cap!\"  cried some; \"Cruikshank!\" cried others; \"Hey for William o' Leslie!\"  shouted others yet again; while ladies waved silken scarfs to urge each  yeoman to do his best.    Then the herald stood forth and loudly proclaimed the rules of the game  as follows:    \"Shoot each man from yon mark, which is sevenscore yards and ten from  the target.  One arrow shooteth each man first, and from all the archers  shall the ten that shooteth the fairest shafts be chosen for to shoot  again. Two arrows shooteth each man of these ten, then shall the three  that shoot the fairest shafts be chosen for to shoot again.  Three  arrows shooteth each man of those three, and to him that shooteth the  fairest shafts shall the prize be given.\"    Then the Sheriff leaned forward, looking keenly among the press of  archers to find whether Robin Hood was among them; but no one was there  clad in Lincoln green, such as was worn by Robin and his band.  \"Nevertheless,\" said the Sheriff to himself, \"he may still be there, and  I miss him among the crowd of other men. But let me see when but ten men  shoot, for I wot he will be among the ten, or I know him not.\"    And now the archers shot, each man in turn, and the good folk never saw  such archery as was done that day.  Six arrows were within the clout,  four within the black, and only two smote the outer ring; so that when  the last arrow sped and struck the target, all the people shouted aloud,  for it was noble shooting.    And now but ten men were left of all those that had shot before, and of  these ten, six were famous throughout the land, and most of the folk  gathered there knew them.  These six men were Gilbert o' the Red Cap,  Adam o' the Dell, Diccon Cruikshank, William o' Leslie, Hubert o' Cloud,  and Swithin o' Hertford.  Two others were yeomen of merry Yorkshire,  another was a tall stranger in blue, who said he came from London Town,  and the last was a tattered stranger in scarlet, who wore a patch over  one eye.    \"Now,\" quoth the Sheriff to a man-at-arms who stood near him, \"seest  thou Robin Hood among those ten?\"    \"Nay, that do I not, Your Worship,\" answered the man. \"Six of them I  know right well.  Of those Yorkshire yeomen, one is too tall and the  other too short for that bold knave. Robin's beard is as yellow as gold,  while yon tattered beggar in scarlet hath a beard of brown, besides  being blind of one eye. As for the stranger in blue, Robin's shoulders,  I ween, are three inches broader than his.\"    \"Then,\" quoth the Sheriff, smiting his thigh angrily, \"yon knave is a  coward as well as a rogue, and dares not show his face among good men  and true.\"    Then, after they had rested a short time, those ten stout men stepped  forth to shoot again.  Each man shot two arrows, and as they shot, not a  word was spoken, but all the crowd watched with scarce a breath of  sound; but when the last had shot his arrow another great shout arose,  while many cast their caps aloft for joy of such marvelous shooting.    \"Now by our gracious Lady fair,\" quoth old Sir Amyas o' the Dell, who,  bowed with fourscore years and more, sat near the Sheriff, \"ne'er saw I  such archery in all my life before, yet have I seen the best hands at  the longbow for threescore years and more.\"    And now but three men were left of all those that had shot before. One  was Gill o' the Red Cap, one the tattered stranger in scarlet, and one  Adam o' the Dell of Tamworth Town.  Then all the people called aloud,  some crying, \"Ho for Gilbert o' the Red Cap!\" and some, \"Hey for stout  Adam o' Tamworth!\"  But not a single man in the crowd called upon the  stranger in scarlet.    \"Now, shoot thou well, Gilbert,\" cried the Sheriff, \"and if thine be the  best shaft, fivescore broad silver pennies will I give to thee beside  the prize.\"    \"Truly I will do my best,\" quoth Gilbert right sturdily. \"A man cannot  do aught but his best, but that will I strive to do this day.\"  So  saying, he drew forth a fair smooth arrow with a broad feather and  fitted it deftly to the string, then drawing his bow with care he sped  the shaft. Straight flew the arrow and lit fairly in the clout, a  finger's-breadth from the center.  \"A Gilbert, a Gilbert!\" shouted all  the crowd; and, \"Now, by my faith,\" cried the Sheriff, smiting his hands  together, \"that is a shrewd shot.\"    Then the tattered stranger stepped forth, and all the people laughed as  they saw a yellow patch that showed beneath his arm when he raised his  elbow to shoot, and also to see him aim with but one eye. He drew the  good yew bow quickly, and quickly loosed a shaft; so short was the time  that no man could draw a breath betwixt the drawing and the shooting;  yet his arrow lodged nearer the center than the other by twice the  length of a barleycorn.    \"Now by all the saints in Paradise!\" cried the Sheriff, \"that is a  lovely shaft in very truth!\"    Then Adam o' the Dell shot, carefully and cautiously, and his arrow  lodged close beside the stranger's. Then after a short space they all  three shot again, and once more each arrow lodged within the clout, but  this time Adam o' the Dell's was farthest from the center, and again the  tattered stranger's shot was the best.  Then, after another time of  rest, they all shot for the third time.  This time Gilbert took great  heed to his aim, keenly measuring the distance and shooting with  shrewdest care. Straight flew the arrow, and all shouted till the very  flags that waved in the breeze shook with the sound, and the rooks and  daws flew clamoring about the roofs of the old gray tower, for the shaft  had lodged close beside the spot that marked the very center.    \"Well done, Gilbert!\" cried the Sheriff right joyously. \"Fain am I to  believe the prize is thine, and right fairly won. Now, thou ragged  knave, let me see thee shoot a better shaft than that.\"    Nought spake the stranger but took his place, while all was hushed, and  no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1015"],[0,"The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life (#7)"],[1,"s, in the way they do? Why, in  two minutes not a hoof would be in sight.\" We reminded the captain that  a hundred Pawnees would probably demolish the horse-guard, if he were to  resist their depredations.    \"At any rate,\" pursued the captain, evading the point, \"our whole system  is wrong; I'm convinced of it; it is totally unmilitary. Why, the way  we travel, strung out over the prairie for a mile, an enemy might attack  the foremost men, and cut them off before the rest could come up.\"    \"We are not in an enemy's country, yet,\" said Shaw; \"when we are, we'll  travel together.\"    \"Then,\" said the captain, \"we might be attacked in camp. We've no  sentinels; we camp in disorder; no precautions at all to guard against  surprise. My own convictions are that we ought to camp in a hollow  square, with the fires in the center; and have sentinels, and a regular  password appointed for every night. Besides, there should be vedettes,  riding in advance, to find a place for the camp and give warning of an  enemy. These are my convictions. I don't want to dictate to any man. I  give advice to the best of my judgment, that's all; and then let people  do as they please.\"    We intimated that perhaps it would be as well to postpone such  burdensome precautions until there should be some actual need of  them; but he shook his head dubiously. The captain's sense of military  propriety had been severely shocked by what he considered the irregular  proceedings of the party; and this was not the first time he had  expressed himself upon the subject. But his convictions seldom produced  any practical results. In the present case, he contented himself,  as usual, with enlarging on the importance of his suggestions, and  wondering that they were not adopted. But his plan of sending out  vedettes seemed particularly dear to him; and as no one else was  disposed to second his views on this point, he took it into his head to  ride forward that afternoon, himself.    \"Come, Parkman,\" said he, \"will you go with me?\"    We set out together, and rode a mile or two in advance. The captain,  in the course of twenty years' service in the British army, had seen  something of life; one extensive side of it, at least, he had enjoyed  the best opportunities for studying; and being naturally a pleasant  fellow, he was a very entertaining companion. He cracked jokes and told  stories for an hour or two; until, looking back, we saw the prairie  behind us stretching away to the horizon, without a horseman or a wagon  in sight.    \"Now,\" said the captain, \"I think the vedettes had better stop till the  main body comes up.\"    I was of the same opinion. There was a thick growth of woods just before  us, with a stream running through them. Having crossed this, we found  on the other side a fine level meadow, half encircled by the trees; and  fastening our horses to some bushes, we sat down on the grass; while,  with an old stump of a tree for a target, I began to display the  superiority of the renowned rifle of the back woods over the foreign  innovation borne by the captain. At length voices could be heard in the  distance behind the trees.    \"There they come!\" said the captain: \"let's go and see how they get  through the creek.\"    We mounted and rode to the bank of the stream, where the trail crossed  it. It ran in a deep hollow, full of trees; as we looked down, we saw a  confused crowd of horsemen riding through the water; and among the dingy  habiliment of our party glittered the uniforms of four dragoons.    Shaw came whipping his horse up the back, in advance of the rest, with  a somewhat indignant countenance. The first word he spoke was a blessing  fervently invoked on the head of R., who was riding, with a crest-fallen  air, in the rear. Thanks to the ingenious devices of the gentleman, we  had missed the track entirely, and wandered, not toward the Platte, but  to the village of the Iowa Indians. This we learned from the dragoons,  who had lately deserted from Fort Leavenworth. They told us that our  best plan now was to keep to the northward until we should strike the  trail formed by several parties of Oregon emigrants, who had that season  set out from St. Joseph's in Missouri.    In extremely bad temper, we encamped on this ill-starred spot; while the  deserters, whose case admitted of no delay rode rapidly forward. On the  day following, striking the St. Joseph's trail, we turned our horses'  heads toward Fort Laramie, then about seven hundred miles to the  westward.        CHAPTER V    \"THE BIG BLUE\"      The great medley of Oregon and California emigrants, at their camps  around Independence, had heard reports that several additional parties  were on the point of setting out from St. Joseph's farther to the  northward. The prevailing impression was that these were Mormons,  twenty-three hundred in number; and a great alarm was excited in  consequence. The people of Illinois and Missouri, who composed by far  the greater part of the emigrants, have never been on the best terms  with the \"Latter Day Saints\"; and it is notorious throughout the country  how much blood has been spilt in their feuds, even far within the limits  of the settlements. No one could predict what would be the result, when  large armed bodies of these fanatics should encounter the most impetuous  and reckless of their old enemies on the broad prairie, far beyond the  reach of law or military force. The women and children at Independence  raised a great outcry; the men themselves were seriously alarmed; and,  as I learned, they sent to Colonel Kearny, requesting an escort of  dragoons as far as the Platte. This was refused; and as the sequel  proved, there was no occasion for it. The St. Joseph's emigrants were as  good Christians and as zealous Mormon-haters as the rest; and the very  few families of the \"Saints\" who passed out this season by the route of  the Platte remained behind until the great tide of emigration had gone  by; standing in quite as much awe of the \"gentiles\" as the latter did of  them.    We were now, as I before mentioned, upon this St. Joseph's trail. It was  evident, by the traces, that large parties were a few days in advance of  us; and as we too supposed them to be Mormons, we had some apprehension  of interruption.    The journey was somewhat monotonous. One day we rode on for hours,  without seeing a tree or a bush; before, behind, and on either side,  stretched the vast expanse, rolling in a succession of graceful swells,  covered with the unbroken carpet of fresh green grass. Here and there a  crow, or a raven, or a turkey-buzzard, relieved the uniformity.    \"What shall we do to-night for wood and water?\" we began to ask of each  other; for the sun was within an hour of setting. At length a dark green  speck appeared, far off on the right; it was the top of a tree, peering  over a swell of the prairie; and leaving the trail, we made all haste  toward it. It proved to be the vanguard of a cluster of bushes and low  trees, that surrounded some pools of water in an extensive hollow; so we  encamped on the rising ground near it.    Shaw and I were sitting in the tent, when Delorier thrust his brown face  and old felt hat into the opening, and dilating his eyes to their utmost  extent, announced supper. There were the tin cups and the iron spoons,  arranged in military order on the grass, and the coffee-pot predominant  in the midst. The meal was soon dispatched; but Henry Chatillon still  sat cross-legged, dallying with the remnant of his coffee, the beverage  in universal use upon the prairie, and an especial favorite with him. He  preferred it in its virgin flavor, unimpaired by sugar or cream; and  on the present occasion it met his entire approval, being exceedingly  strong, or, as he expressed it, \"right black.\"    It was a rich and gorgeous sunset--an American sunset; and the ruddy  glow of the sky was reflected from some extensive pools of water among  the shadowy copses in the meadow below.    \"I must have a bath to-night,\" said Shaw. \"How is it, Delorier? Any  chance for a swim down here?\"    \"Ah! I cannot tell; just as you please, monsieur,\" replied Delorier,  shrugging his shoulders, perplexed by his ignorance of English, and  extremely anxious to conform in all respects to the opinion and wishes  of his bourgeois.    \"Look at his moccasion,\" said I. \"It has evidently been lately immersed  in a profound abyss of black mud.\"    \"Come,\" said Shaw; \"at any rate we can see for ourselves.\"    We set out together; and as we approached the bushes, which were at some  distance, we found the ground becoming rather treacherous. We could  only get along by stepping upon large clumps of tall rank grass, with  fathomless gulfs between, like innumerable little quaking islands in  an ocean of mud, where a false step would have involved our boots in a  catastrophe like that which had befallen Delorier's moccasins. The thing  looked desperate; we separated, so as to search in different directions,  Shaw going off to the right, while I kept straight forward. At last I  came to the edge of the bushes: they were young waterwillows, covered  with their caterpillar-like blossoms, but intervening between them  and the last grass clump was a black and deep slough, over which, by a  vigorous exertion, I contrived to jump. Then I shouldered my way through  the willows, tramping them down by main force, till I came to a wide  stream of water, three inches deep, languidly creeping along over a  bottom of sleek mud. My arrival produced a great commotion. A huge green  bull-frog uttered an indignant croak, and jumped off the bank with a  loud splash: his webbed feet twinkled above the surface, as he jerked  them energetically upward, and I could see him ensconcing himself in  the unresisting slime at the bottom, whence several large air bubbles  struggled lazily to the top. Some little spotted frogs instantly  followed the patriarch's example; and"]]]
