[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (#6)"],[1,"said that the length of an adult's size, when  added together, is two feet or a little more.  But the size of our  sides is not under consideration.  I am speaking of the EQUALITY of  sides, and it does not need much reflection to see that the whole of  the social life in Flatland rests upon the fundamental fact that Nature  wills all Figures to have their sides equal.    If our sides were unequal our angles might be unequal.  Instead of its  being sufficient to feel, or estimate by sight, a single angle in order  to determine the form of an individual, it would be necessary to  ascertain each angle by the experiment of Feeling.  But life would be  too short for such a tedious groping.  The whole science and art of  Sight Recognition would at once perish; Feeling, so far as it is an  art, would not long survive; intercourse would become perilous or  impossible; there would be an end to all confidence, all forethought;  no one would be safe in making the most simple social arrangements; in  a word, civilization might relapse into barbarism.    Am I going too fast to carry my Readers with me to these obvious  conclusions?  Surely a moment's reflection, and a single instance from  common life, must convince every one that our social system is based  upon Regularity, or Equality of Angles.  You meet, for example, two or  three Tradesmen in the street, whom your recognize at once to be  Tradesman by a glance at their angles and rapidly bedimmed sides, and  you ask them to step into your house to lunch.  This you do at present  with perfect confidence, because everyone knows to an inch or two the  area occupied by an adult Triangle: but imagine that your Tradesman  drags behind his regular and respectable vertex, a parallelogram of  twelve or thirteen inches in diagonal:--what are you to do with such a  monster sticking fast in your house door?    But I am insulting the intelligence of my Readers by accumulating  details which must be patent to everyone who enjoys the advantages of a  Residence in Spaceland.  Obviously the measurements of a single angle  would no longer be sufficient under such portentous circumstances;  one's whole life would be taken up in feeling or surveying the  perimeter of one's acquaintances.  Already the difficulties of avoiding  a collision in a crowd are enough to tax the sagacity of even a  well-educated Square; but if no one could calculate the Regularity of a  single figure in the company, all would be chaos and confusion, and the  slightest panic would cause serious injuries, or--if there happened to  be any Women or Soldiers present--perhaps considerable loss of life.    Expediency therefore concurs with Nature in stamping the seal of its  approval upon Regularity of conformation:  nor has the Law been  backward in seconding their efforts.  \"Irregularity of Figure\" means  with us the same as, or more than, a combination of moral obliquity and  criminality with you, and is treated accordingly.  There are not  wanting, it is true, some promulgators of paradoxes who maintain that  there is no necessary connection between geometrical and moral  Irregularity.  \"The Irregular,\" they say, \"is from his birth scouted by  his own parents, derided by his brothers and sisters, neglected by the  domestics, scorned and suspected by society, and excluded from all  posts of responsibility, trust, and useful activity.  His every  movement is jealously watched by the police till he comes of age and  presents himself for inspection; then he is either destroyed, if he is  found to exceed the fixed margin of deviation, at an uninteresting  occupation for a miserable stipend; obliged to live and board at the  office, and to take even his vacation under close supervision; what  wonder that human nature, even in the best and purest, is embittered  and perverted by such surroundings!\"    All this very plausible reasoning does not convince me, as it has not  convinced the wisest of our Statesmen, that our ancestors erred in  laying it down as an axiom of policy that the toleration of  Irregularity is incompatible with the safety of the State.  Doubtless,  the life of an Irregular is hard; but the interests of the Greater  Number require that it shall be hard.  If a man with a triangular front  and a polygonal back were allowed to exist and to propagate a still  more Irregular posterity, what would become of the arts of life?  Are  the houses and doors and churches in Flatland to be altered in order to  accommodate such monsters?  Are our ticket-collectors to be required to  measure every man's perimeter before they allow him to enter a theatre,  or to take his place in a lecture room?  Is an Irregular to be exempted  from the militia?  And if not, how is he to be prevented from carrying  desolation into the ranks of his comrades?  Again, what irresistible  temptations to fraudulent impostures must needs beset such a creature!  How easy for him to enter a shop with his polygonal front foremost, and  to order goods to any extent from a confiding tradesman!  Let the  advocates of a falsely called Philanthropy plead as they may for the  abrogation of the Irregular Penal Laws, I for my part have never known  an Irregular who was not also what Nature evidently intended him to  be--a hypocrite, a misanthropist, and, up to the limits of his power, a  perpetrator of all manner of mischief.    Not that I should be disposed to recommend (at present) the extreme  measures adopted by some States, where an infant whose angle deviates  by half a degree from the correct angularity is summarily destroyed at  birth. Some of our highest and ablest men, men of real genius, have  during their earliest days laboured under deviations as great as, or  even greater than forty-five minutes: and the loss of their precious  lives would have been an irreparable injury to the State.  The art of  healing also has achieved some of its most glorious triumphs in the  compressions, extensions, trepannings, colligations, and other surgical  or diaetetic operations by which Irregularity has been partly or wholly  cured.  Advocating therefore a VIA MEDIA, I would lay down no fixed or  absolute line of demarcation; but at the period when the frame is just  beginning to set, and when the Medical Board has reported that recovery  is improbably, I would suggest that the Irregular offspring be  painlessly and mercifully consumed.          SECTION 8  Of the Ancient Practice of Painting      If my Readers have followed me with any attention up to this point,  they will not be surprised to hear that life is somewhat dull in  Flatland.  I do not, of course, mean that there are not battles,  conspiracies, tumults, factions, and all those other phenomena which  are supposed to make History interesting; nor would I deny that the  strange mixture of the problems of life and the problems of  Mathematics, continually inducing conjecture and giving an opportunity  of immediate verification, imparts to our existence a zest which you in  Spaceland can hardly comprehend.  I speak now from the aesthetic and  artistic point of view when I say that life with us is dull;  aesthetically and artistically, very dull indeed.    How can it be otherwise, when all one's prospect, all one's landscapes,  historical pieces, portraits, flowers, still life, are nothing but a  single line, with no varieties except degrees of brightness and  obscurity?    It was not always thus.  Colour, if Tradition speaks the truth, once  for the space of half a dozen centuries or more, threw a transient  splendour over the lives of our ancestors in the remotest ages.  Some  private individual--a Pentagon whose name is variously reported--having  casually discovered the constituents of the simpler colours and a  rudimentary method of painting, is said to have begun by decorating  first his house, then his slaves, then his Father, his Sons, and  Grandsons, lastly himself.  The convenience as well as the beauty of  the results commended themselves to all.  Wherever Chromatistes,--for  by that name the most trustworthy authorities concur in calling  him,--turned his variegated frame, there he at once excited attention,  and attracted respect.  No one now needed to \"feel\" him; no one mistook  his front for his back; all his movements were readily ascertained by  his neighbours without the slightest strain on their powers of  calculation; no one jostled him, or failed to make way for him; his  voice was saved the labour of that exhausting utterance by which we  colourless Squares and Pentagons are often forced to proclaim our  individuality when we move amid a crowd of ignorant Isosceles.    The fashion spread like wildfire.  Before a week was over, every Square  and Triangle in the district had copied the example of Chromatistes,  and only a few of the more conservative Pentagons still held out.  A  month or two found even the Dodecagons infected with the innovation.  A  year had not elapsed before the habit had spread to all but the very  highest of the Nobility.  Needless to say, the custom soon made its way  from the district of Chromatistes to surrounding regions; and within  two generations no one in all Flatland was colourless except the Women  and the Priests.    Here Nature herself appeared to erect a barrier, and to plead against  extending the innovations to these two classes.  Many-sidedness was  almost essential as a pretext for the Innovators.  \"Distinction of  sides is intended by Nature to imply distinction of colours\"--such was  the sophism which in those days flew from mouth to mouth, converting  whole towns at a time to a new culture.  But manifestly to our Priests  and Women this adage did not apply.  The latter had only one side, and  therefore--plurally and pedantically speaking--NO SIDES.  The  former--if at least they would assert their claim to be readily and  truly Circles, and not mere high-class Polygons, with an infinitely  large number of infinitesimally small"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9791"],[0,"Harrigan (#6)"],[1,"him!\"    He retreated from the door, but before any of the sailors could go in  to fulfill the order, Harrigan walked of his own accord out onto the  deck. The wind on his face was sweet and keen; the vapors blew from  eyes and brain. He was himself again, weaker, but himself. He saw the  circle of wondering, awe-stricken faces; he saw McTee standing with  folded arms.          CHAPTER 7      \"Mutiny on the high seas,\" the captain was saying, \"is as bad as murder  on dry land. I could swing you by the neck from the mast for this,  Harrigan, and every court would uphold me. Or I can throw you into the  irons and leave your trial until we touch port. But--stand back!\"    At the wave of his hand the circle spread. McTee stepped close to  Harrigan.    \"I could do all that I've said, but why should I waste you on a prison  when there's a chance that I can use for myself? Harrigan, will you  stand up to me, man to man, and fist to fist, fighting fair and square  without advantage, and then if I thrash you, will you be my man? If I  beat you, will you swear to follow me, to do my bidding? Harrigan, if I  have you to work for me--I'll be king of the south seas!\"    \"Man to man--fair and square?\" repeated Harrigan vaguely. \"I'm weak.  You've had me in hell an' sweated me thin, McTee. If I was my old self,  I'd jump at the chance.\"    \"Then it's irons for you and ten years for mutiny when we reach port.\"    \"Ah-h, damn your heart!\"    \"But if I beat you, you'll be a lord of men, Harrigan, with only one  king over you--McTee! You'll live on the fat of the land and the  plunder of the high seas if you serve McTee.\"    \"What oath could I swear that you'd believe?\"    \"Your hand in mind for a pledge--I ask no more.\"    He held out his hand. The lean, strong fingers fascinated Harrigan.    \"I'd rather take your throat than your hand, McTee--an' mebbe I  will--an' mebbe I will!\"    He caught the hand in his own cracked, stained, black palm. The smile  of McTee was like the smile of Satan when he watched Adam driven from  the Eden.    \"Strip to the waist,\" he said, and turned on the crew.    \"You know me, lads. I've tried to break Harrigan, but I've only bent  him, and now he's going to stand up to me man to man, and if he wins,  he's free to do as he likes and never lift a hand till we reach port.  Aye, lick your chops, you dogs. There's none of you had the heart to  try what Harrigan is going to try.\"    If they did not actually lick their chops, there was hunger in their  eyes and a strange wistfulness as they watched Harrigan strip off his  shirt, but when they saw the wasted arms, lean, with the muscles  defined and corded as if by famine, their faces went blank again. For  they glanced in turn at the vast torso of McTee. When he moved his  arms, his smooth shoulders rippled in significant spots--the spots  where the driving muscles lay. But Harrigan saw nothing save the throat  of which he had dreamed.    \"This is to the finish?\" said McTee.    \"Aye.\"    \"And no quarter?\"    Harrigan grinned, and slipped out to the middle of the deck. Both of  them kicked off their shoes. Even in their bare feet it would be  difficult to keep upright, for the _Mary Rogers_ was rollicking through  a choppy sea. Harrigan sensed the crew standing in a loose circle with  the hunger of the wolf pack in winter stamped in their eyes.    McTee stood with his feet braced strongly, his hands poised. But  Harrigan stole about him with a gliding, unequal step. He did not seem  preparing to strike with his hands, which hung low, but rather like one  who would leap at the throat with his teeth. The ship heaved and  Harrigan sprang and his fists cracked--one, two. He leaped out again  under the captain's clubbed hands. Two spots of red glowed on McTee's  ribs and the wolf pack moistened their lips.    \"Come again, Harrigan, for I've smelled the meat, not tasted it.\"    \"It tastes red--like this.\"    And feinting at McTee's body, he suddenly straightened and smashed both  hands against the captain's mouth. McTee's head jarred back under the  impact. The wolf pack murmured. The captain made a long step, waited  until Harrigan had leaped back to the side of the deck to avoid the  plunge, and then, as the deck heaved up to give added impetus to his  lunge, he rushed. The angle of the deck kept the Irishman from taking  advantage of his agility. He could not escape. One pile-driver hand  cracked against his forehead--another thudded on his ribs. He leaped  through a shower of blows and clinched.    He was crushed against the rail. He was shaken by a quick succession of  short arm punches. But anything was preferable to another of those  long, driving blows. He clung until his head cleared. Then he shook  himself loose and dropped, as if dazed, to one knee. McTee's bellow of  triumph filled his ears. The captain bore down on him with outstretched  hands to grapple at his throat, but at the right instant Harrigan rose  and lurched out with stiff arm. The punch drove home to the face with a  shock that jarred Harrigan to his feet and jerked McTee back as if  drawn by a hand. Before he recovered his balance, Harrigan planted half  a dozen punches, but though they shook the captain, they did not send  him down, and Harrigan groaned.    McTee bellowed again. It was not pain. It was not mere rage. It was a  battle cry, and with it he rushed Harrigan. They raged back and forth  across the deck, and the wolf pack drew close, cursing beneath their  breath. They had looked for a quick end to the struggle, but now they  saw that the fighters were mated. The greater strength was McTee's; the  greater purpose was Harrigan's. McTee fought to crush and conquer;  Harrigan fought to kill.    The blows of the captain flung Harrigan here and there, yet he came  back to meet the attack, slinking with sure, catlike steps. The heel  and pitch of the deck sometimes staggered the captain, but Harrigan  seemed to know beforehand what would happen, and he leaped in at every  opening with blows that cut the skin.    His own flesh was bruised. He bled from mouth and nose, but what was  any other pain compared with the torture of his clenched fists? It made  his arms numb to the elbow and sent currents of fire through his veins.  His eyes kept on the thick throat of McTee. Though he was knocked  reeling and half senseless, his stare never changed, and the wolf pack,  with their heads jutting forward with eagerness watched, waited. The  \"Ha!\" of McTee rang with the strength of five throats. The \"Wah-h!\" of  Harrigan purred like a furious panther's snarl.    Then as the frenzy left Harrigan and the numbness departed from his  arms, he knew that he was growing weaker and weaker. In McTee's eyes he  saw the growing light of victory, the confidence. His own wild hunger  for blood grew apace with his desperation. He flung himself forward in  a last effort.    A ponderous fist cracked home between his eyes, fairly lifting him from  his feet and hurling him against the base of the wheelhouse. Then a  forearm shot under his shoulder and a hand fastened on the back of his  neck in an incomplete half-Nelson. As McTee applied the pressure,  Harrigan felt his vertebral column give under the tremendous strain. He  struggled furiously but could not break the grip. Far away, like the  storm wind in the forest, he heard the moan of the wolf pack.    \"Give in! Give in!\" panted McTee.    \"Ah-h!\" snarled Harrigan.    He felt the deck swing and jerked his legs high in the air. He could  not have broken that grip of his own strength, but the sway of the deck  gave his movement a mighty leverage. The hand slipped from his neck,  scraping skin away, as if a red-hot iron had been drawn across the  flesh. But he was half loosed, and that twist of his body sent them  both rolling one over the other to the scuppers of the ship--and it was  McTee who crashed against the rail, receiving the blow on the back of  his head. His eyes went dull; the red hands of Harrigan fastened on his  throat.    \"God!\" screamed McTee, and gripped Harrigan's wrists, but the Irishman  heaved him up and beat his head against the deck.    McTee's jaws fell open, and a bloody froth bubbled to his  lips; his eyes thrust out hideously.    \"Ah-h!\" snarled Harrigan, and shifted his grip lower, his thumbs  digging relentlessly into the great throat. This time the giant limbs  of the captain relaxed as if in sleep. Then through the fierce singing  in his ears the Irishman heard a yell. He turned his head. The wolf  pack saw their prey pulled down at last. They ran now to join the kill,  not men, but raging devils. Harrigan sprang to his feet, catching up a  marlinspike, and whirled it above his head.    \"Back!\" he shouted.    They shrank back, growling one to the other savagely, irresolute. There  came a moan at Harrigan's feet. He leaned over and lifted the bulk of  the captain's inert body. As if through a haze he saw the chief  engineer and the two mates running toward him and caught the glitter of  a revolver in the hands of the first officer. The Irishman's battered  lips stretched to a shapeless grin.    \"Help me to the captain's cabin,\" he said. \"He's afther bein' sick.\"          CHAPTER 8      And the four of them went aft carrying McTee's body. On the promenade  they passed Kate Malone. She shrank against the rail, her eyes blank  and her face white.    \"He's dead!\" she cried.    \"He's just beginnin' to live,\" said Harrigan.    The captain was muttering faintly as they laid him on the bunk in his  room. \"Now get out,\" commanded Harrigan. \"I will be alone with him when  he wakes up. I have something to whisper in his ear.\"    \"Is it safe?\" said the first mate to the chief engineer, gesturing with  his weapon.    Harrigan snatched it away and waved it like a club above his head.    \"Get out, or I'll bash your skull in.\"    His face was hideous, cut and blood-stained, starved with the long  hunger and lighted with the victory.
