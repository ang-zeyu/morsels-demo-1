Now that these have been consummated, I shall print this  biography.    The elder Booth in every land was a sojourner, as all his fathers were.  Of Hebrew descent, and by a line of actors, he united in himself that  strong Jewish physiognomy which, in its nobler phases, makes all that is  dark and beautiful, and the combined vagrancy of all men of genius and  all men of the stage. Fitful, powerful, passionate, his life was a  succession of vices and triumphs. He mastered the intricate characters  of dramatic literature by intuition, rather than by study, and produced  them with a vigor and vividness which almost passed the depicting of  real life. The stage on which he raved and fought became as historic as  the actual decks of battle ships, and his small and brawny figure comes  down to us in those paroxysms of delirious art, like that of _Harold, or  Richard, or Prince Rupert_. He drank to excess, was profligate but not  generous, required but not reliable, and licentious to the bounds of  cruelty. He threw off the wife of his bosom to fly from England with a  flower-girl, and, settling in Baltimore, dwelt with his younger  companion, and brought up many children, while his first-possessed went  down to a drunken and broken-hearted death. He himself, wandering  westward, died on the way, errant and feverish, even in the closing  moments. His widow, too conscious of her predecessor's wrongs, and often  taunted with them, lived apart, frugal and discreet, and brought her six  children up to honorable maturity. These were Junius Brutus, Edwin  Forrest (though he drops the Forrest for professional considerations),  John Wilkes, Joseph, and the girls. All of the boys are known to more or  less of fame; none of them in his art has reached the renown of the  father; but one has sent his name as far as that of the great playwright  to whom they were pupils; wherever Shakspeare is quoted, John Wilkes  Booth will be named, and infamously, like that Hubert in \"King John,\"  who would have murdered the gentle Prince Arthur.    It may not be a digression here to ask what has become of the children  of the weird genius I have sketched above. Mrs. Booth, against whom  calumny has had no word to say, now resides with her daughters in  Nineteenth street, New-York. John S. Clarke dwells in princely style in  Philadelphia, with the daughter whom he married; he is the business  partner of Edwin Booth, and they are likely to become as powerful  managers as they have been successful \"stars.\" Edwin Booth, who is said  to have the most perfect physical head in America, and whom the ladies  call the beau ideal of the melancholy Dane, dwells also on Nineteenth  street. He has acquired a fortune, and is, without doubt, a frankly  loyal gentleman. He could not well be otherwise from his membership in  the Century Club where literature and loyalty, are never dissolved.  Correct and pleasing without being powerful or brilliant, he has led a  plain and appreciated career, and latterly, to his honor, has been  awakening among dramatic authors some emulation by offering handsome  compensations for original plays. Junius Brutus Booth, the oldest of  them all, most resembles in feature his wild and wayward father; he is  not as good an actor as was Wilkes, and kept in the West, that border  civilization of the drama; he now lies, on a serious charge of  complicity, in Capitol Hill jail. Joseph Booth tried the stage as an  utility actor and promptly failed. The best part he ever had to play was  _Orson_ in the \"Iron Chest,\" and his discomfiture was signal; then he  studied medicine but grew discouraged, and is now in California in an  office of some sort. A son of Booth by his first wife became a first  class lawyer in Boston. He never recognized the rest of the family.  Wilkes Booth, the third son, was shot dead on Wednesday for attempting  to escape from the consequences of murder. Such are the people to whom  one of the greatest actors of our time gave his name and lineaments. But  I have anticipated the story:    Although her family was large, it was not so hard sailing with Mrs.  Rosalie Booth as may be inferred. Her husband's gains had been variably  great, and they owned a farm of some value near Baltimore. The boys had  plain but not sufficient schooling, though by the time John Wilkes grew  up Edwin and Junius were making some little money and helping the  family. So Wilkes was sent to a better school than they, where he made  some eventful acquaintances. One of these won his admiration as much in  the playground as in subsequent life upon the field of battle; this was  Fitzhugh Lee, son of the great rebel chieftain. I have not heard that  Lee ever had any friendship for young Wilkes, but his port and name were  enough to excite a less ardent imagination--the son of a soldier already  great, and a descendant of Washington. Wilkes Booth has often spoken of  the memory of the young man, envied his success, and, perhaps, boasted  of more intimacy than he ever had. The exemplars of young Wilkes, it was  soon seen, were anything but literary. He hated school and pent-up life,  and loved the open air. He used to stroll off to fish, though that sort  of amusement was too sedentary for his nature, but went on fowling  jaunts with enthusiasm. In these latter he manifested that fine nerve,  and certain eye, which was the talk of all his associates; but his  greatest love was the stable; He learned to ride with his first pair of  boots, and hung around the grooms to beg permission to take the nags to  water. He grew in later life to be both an indurated and a graceful  horseman. Toward his mother and sisters he was affectionate without  being obedient. Of all the sons, Wilkes was the most headstrong  in-doors, and the most contented away from home. He had a fitful  gentleness which won him forgiveness, and of one of his sisters he was  particularly fond, but none had influence over him. He was seldom  contentious, but obstinately bent, and what he willed, to did in  silence, seeming to discard sympathy or confidence. As a boy he was  never bright, except in a boy's sense; that is, he could run and leap  well, fight when challenged, and generally fell in with the sentiment of  the crowd. He therefore made many companions, and his early days all  passed between Baltimore city and the adjacent farm.    I have heard it said as the only evidence of Booth's ferocity in those  early times that he was always shooting cats, and killed off almost the  entire breed in his neighbourhood. But on more than one occasion he ran  away from both school and home, and once made the trip of the Chesapeake  to the oyster fisheries without advising anybody of his family.    While yet very young, Wilkes Booth became an habitue at the theater. His  traditions and tastes were all in that direction. His blood was of the  stage, like that of the Keans, the Kembles, and the Wallacks. He would  not commence at the bottom of the ladder and climb from round to round,  nor take part in more than a few Thespian efforts. One night, however, a  young actor, who was to have a benefit and wished to fill the house,  resolved for the better purpose to give Wilkes a chance. He announced  that a son of the great Booth of tradition, would enact the part of  Richmond, and the announcement was enough. Before a crowded place, Booth  played so badly that he was hissed. Still holding to his gossamer hopes  and high conceit, Wilkes induced John S. Clarke, who was then addressing  his sister, to obtain him a position in the company of the Arch Street  Theater at Philadelphia.    For eight dollars a week, Wilkes Booth, at the age of twenty-two,  contracted with William Wheatley to play in any piece or part for which  he might be cast, and to appear every day at rehearsal. He had to play  the _Courier_ in Sheridan Knowles's \"Wife\" on his first night, with five  or ten little speeches to make; but such was his nervousness that he  blundered continually, and quite balked the piece. Soon afterward he  undertook the part of one of the Venetian comrades in Hugo's \"Lucretia  Borgia,\" and was to have said in his turn--    \"Madame, I am Petruchio Pandolfo;\" instead of which he exclaimed:    \"Madame, I am Pondolfio Pet--, Pedolfio Pat--, Pantuchio Ped--; damn it?  what am I?\"    The audience roared, and Booth, though full of chagrin, was compelled to  laugh with them.    The very next night he was to play _Dawson_, an important part in  Moore's tragedy of \"The Gamester.\" He had bought a new dress to wear on  this night, and made abundant preparation to do himself honor. He  therefore invited a lady whom he knew to visit the theater, and witness  his triumph. But at the instant of his appearance on the stage, the  audience, remembering the Petruchio Pandolfo of the previous night,  burst into laughter, hisses, and mock applause, so that he was struck  dumb, and stood rigid, with nothing whatever to say. Mr. John Dolman, to  whose _Stukely_ has played, was compelled, therefore, to strike _Dawson_  entirely out of the piece.    These occurrences nettled Booth, who protested that he studied  faithfully but that his want of confidence ruined him. Mr. Fredericks  the stage manager made constant complaints of Booth, who by the way, did  not play under his full name, but as Mr. J. Wilkes--and he bore the  general reputation of having no promise, and being a careless fellow. He  associated freely with such of the subordinate actors as he liked; but  being, through Clarke, then a rising favourite, of better connections,  might, had he chosen, advanced himself socially, if not artistically.  Clarke was to have a benefit one evening, and to enact, among other  things, a mock _Richard III_., to which he allowed Wilkes Booth to play  a real _Richmond_. On this occasion, for the first time, Booth showed  some "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6630"],[0,"Curiosities of the Sky (#6)"],[1,"them  looking like tresses streaming in a breeze, lie amid fields of stars  which seem related to them. But the relation is of a most singular  kind, for notwithstanding the delicate structure of the long nebulae  they appear to act as barriers, causing the stars to heap themselves  on one side. The stars are two, three, or four times as numerous on  one side of the nebulae as on the other. These nebulae, as far as  appearance goes, might be likened to rail fences, or thin hedges,  against which the wind is driving drifts of powdery snow, which, while  scattered plentifully all around, tends to bank itself on the leeward  side of the obstruction. The imagination is at a loss to account for  these extraordinary phenomena; yet there they are, faithfully giving  us their images whenever the photographic plate is exposed to their  radiations.    Thus the more we see of the universe with improved methods of  observation, and the more we invent aids to human senses, each  enabling us to penetrate a little deeper into the unseen, the greater  becomes the mystery. The telescope carried us far, photography is  carrying us still farther; but what as yet unimagined instrument will  take us to the bottom, the top, and the end? And then, what hitherto  untried power of thought will enable us to comprehend the meaning of  it all?    Stellar Migrations    To the untrained eye the stars and the planets are not  distinguishable. It is customary to call them all alike ``stars.'' But  since the planets more or less rapidly change their places in the sky,  in consequence of their revolution about the sun, while the stars  proper seem to remain always in the same relative positions, the  latter are spoken of as ``fixed stars.'' In the beginnings of  astronomy it was not known that the ``fixed stars'' had any motion  independent of their apparent annual revolution with the whole sky  about the earth as a seeming center. Now, however, we know that the  term ``fixed stars'' is paradoxical, for there is not a single really  fixed object in the whole celestial sphere. The apparent fixity in the  positions of the stars is due to their immense distance, combined with  the shortness of the time during which we are able to observe them. It  is like viewing the plume of smoke issuing from a steamer, hull down,  at sea: if one does not continue to watch it for a long time it  appears to be motionless, although in reality it may be traveling at  great speed across the line of sight. Even the planets seem fixed in  position if one watches them for a single night only, and the more  distant ones do not sensibly change their places, except after many  nights of observation. Neptune, for instance, moves but little more  than two degrees in the course of an entire year, and in a month its  change of place is only about one-third of the diameter of the full  moon.    Yet, fixed as they seem, the stars are actually moving with a speed in  comparison with which, in some cases, the planets might almost be said  to stand fast in their tracks. Jupiter's speed in his orbit is about  eight miles per second, Neptune's is less than three and one-half  miles, and the earth's is about eighteen and one-half miles; while  there are ``fixed stars'' which move two hundred or three hundred  miles per second. They do not all, however, move with so great a  velocity, for some appear to travel no faster than the planets. But in  all cases, notwithstanding their real speed, long-continued and  exceedingly careful observations are required to demonstrate that they  are moving at all. No more overwhelming impression of the frightful  depths of space in which the stars are buried can be obtained than by  reflecting upon the fact that a star whose actual motion across the  line of sight amounts to two hundred miles per second does not change  its apparent place in the sky, in the course of a thousand years,  sufficiently to be noticed by the casual observer of the heavens!    There is one vast difference between the motions of the stars and  those of the planets to which attention should be at once called: the  planets, being under the control of a central force emanating from  their immediate master, the sun, all move in the same direction and in  orbits concentric about the sun; the stars, on the other hand, move in  every conceivable direction and have no apparent center of motion, for  all efforts to discover such a center have failed. At one time, when  theology had finally to accept the facts of science, a grandiose  conception arose in some pious minds, according to which the Throne of  God was situated at the exact center of His Creation, and, seated  there, He watched the magnificent spectacle of the starry systems  obediently revolving around Him. Astronomical discoveries and  speculations seemed for a time to afford some warrant for this view,  which was, moreover, an acceptable substitute for the abandoned  geocentric theory in minds that could only conceive of God as a  superhuman artificer, constantly admiring his own work. No longer ago  than the middle of the nineteenth century a German astronomer,  Maedler, believed that he had actually found the location of the  center about which the stellar universe revolved. He placed it in the  group of the Pleiades, and upon his authority an extraordinary  imaginative picture was sometimes drawn of the star Alcyone, the  brightest of the Pleiades, as the very seat of the Almighty. This idea  even seemed to gain a kind of traditional support from the mystic  significance, without known historical origin, which has for many  ages, and among widely separated peoples, been attached to the  remarkable group of which Alcyone is the chief. But since Maedler's  time it has been demonstrated that the Pleiades cannot be the center  of revolution of the universe, and, as already remarked, all attempts  to find or fix such a center have proved abortive. Yet so powerful was  the hold that the theory took upon the popular imagination, that even  today astronomers are often asked if Alcyone is not the probable site  of ``Jerusalem the Golden.''    If there were a discoverable center of predominant gravitative power,  to which the motions of all the stars could be referred, those motions  would appear less mysterious, and we should then be able to conclude  that the universe was, as a whole, a prototype of the subsidiary  systems of which it is composed. We should look simply to the law of  gravitation for an explanation, and, naturally, the center would be  placed within the opening enclosed by the Milky Way. If it were there  the Milky Way itself should exhibit signs of revolution about it, like  a wheel turning upon its hub. No theory of the star motions as a whole  could stand which failed to take account of the Milky Way as the basis  of all. But the very form of that divided wreath of stars forbids the  assumption of its revolution about a center. Even if it could be  conceived as a wheel having no material center it would not have the  form which it actually presents. As was shown in Chapter 2, there is  abundant evidence of motion in the Milky Way; but it is not motion of  the system as a whole, but motion affecting its separate parts.  Instead of all moving one way, the galactic stars, as far as their  movements can be inferred, are governed by local influences and  conditions. They appear to travel crosswise and in contrary  directions, and perhaps they eddy around foci where great numbers have  assembled; but of a universal revolution involving the entire mass we  have no evidence.    Most of our knowledge of star motions, called ``proper motions,''  relates to individual stars and to a few groups which happen to be so  near that the effects of their movements are measurable. In some cases  the motion is so rapid (not in appearance, but in reality) that the  chief difficulty is to imagine how it can have been imparted, and what  will eventually become of the ``runaways.'' Without a collision, or a  series of very close approaches to great gravitational centers, a star  traveling through space at the rate of two hundred or three hundred  miles per second could not be arrested or turned into an orbit which  would keep it forever flying within the limits of the visible  universe. A famous example of these speeding stars is ``1830  Groombridge,'' a star of only the sixth magnitude, and consequently  just visible to the naked eye, whose motion across the line of sight  is so rapid that it moves upon the face of the sky a distance equal to  the apparent diameter of the moon every 280 years. The distance of  this star is at least 200,000,000,000,000 miles, and may be two or  three times greater, so that its actual speed cannot be less than two  hundred, and may be as much as four hundred, miles per second. It  could be turned into a new course by a close approach to a great sun,  but it could only be stopped by collision, head-on, with a body of  enormous mass. Barring such accidents it must, as far as we can see,  keep on until it has traversed our stellar system, whence in may  escape and pass out into space beyond, to join, perhaps, one of those  other universes of which we have spoken. Arcturus, one of the greatest  suns in the universe, is also a runaway, whose speed of flight has  been estimated all the way from fifty to two hundred miles per second.  Arcturus, we have every reason to believe, possesses hundreds of times  the mass of our sun -- think, then, of the prodigious momentum that  its motion implies! Sirius moves more moderately, its motion across  the line of sight amounting to only ten miles per second, but it is at  the same time approaching the sun at about the same speed, its actual  velocity in space being the resultant of the two displacements.    What has been said about the motion of Sirius brings us to another  aspect of this subject. The fact is, that in every case of stellar  motion the"]]]
