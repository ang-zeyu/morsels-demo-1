He was also rich, of noble birth,  and had powerful friends, so that he feared he might be banished by  ostracism, and consequently held aloof from politics, but proved himself  a brave and daring soldier in the wars. But when Aristides was dead,  Themistocles banished, and Cimon generally absent on distant campaigns,  Pericles engaged in public affairs, taking the popular side, that of the  poor and many, against that of the rich and few; quite contrary to his  own feelings, which were entirely aristocratic. He feared, it seems,  that he might be suspected of a design to make himself despot, and  seeing that Cimon took the side of the nobility, and was much beloved by  them, he betook himself to the people, as a means of obtaining safety  for himself, and a strong party to combat that of Cimon. He immediately  altered his mode of life; was never seen in any street except that which  led to the market-place and the national assembly, and declined all  invitations to dinner and such like social gatherings. But Pericles  feared to make himself too common even with the people, and only  addressed them after long intervals; not speaking upon every subject,  and not constantly addressing them, but, as Critolaus says, keeping  himself like the Salaminian trireme for great crises, and allowing his  friends and the other orators to manage matters of less moment.    Wishing to adopt a style of speaking consonant with his haughty manner  and lofty spirit, Pericles made free use of the instrument which  Anaxagoras, as it were, put into his hand, and often tinged his oratory  with natural philosophy. He far surpassed all others by using this  \"lofty intelligence and power of universal consummation,\" as the divine  Plato calls it; in addition to his natural advantages, adorning his  oratory with apt illustrations drawn from physical science. For this  reason some think that he was nicknamed the Olympian; though some refer  this to his improvement of the city by new and beautiful buildings, and  others from his power both as a politician and a general. It is not by  any means unlikely that these causes all combined to produce the name.    Pericles was very cautious about his words, and, whenever he ascended  the tribune to speak, used first to pray to the gods that nothing  unfitted for the present occasion might fall from his lips. He left no  writings, except the measures which he brought forward, and very few of  his sayings are recorded.    Thucydides represents the constitution under Pericles as a democracy in  name, but really an aristocracy, because the government was all in the  hands of one leading citizen. But as many other writers tell us that,  during his administration, the people received grants of land abroad,  and were indulged with dramatic entertainments, and payments for their  services, in consequence of which they fell into bad habits, and became  extravagant and licentious, instead of sober hard-working people as they  had been before, let us consider the history of this change, viewing it  by the light of the facts themselves. First of all, Pericles had to  measure himself with Cimon, and to transfer the affections of the people  from Cimon to himself. As he was not so rich a man as Cimon, who used  from his own ample means to give a dinner daily to any poor Athenian who  required it, clothe aged persons, and take away the fences round his  property, so that anyone might gather the fruit, Pericles, unable to vie  with him in this, turned his attention to a distribution of the public  funds among the people, at the suggestion, we are told by Aristotle, of  Damonides of Oia. By the money paid for public spectacles, for citizens  acting as jurymen, and other paid offices, and largesses, he soon won  over the people to his side, so that he was able to use them in his  attack upon the senate of the Areopagus, of which he himself was not a  member, never having been chosen _archon_, or _thesmothete_, or _king  archon_, or _polemarch_. These offices had from ancient times been  obtained by lot, and it was only through them that those who had  approved themselves in the discharge of them were advanced to the  Areopagus. For this reason it was that Pericles, when he gained strength  with the populace, destroyed this senate, making Ephialtes bring forward  a bill which restricted its judicial powers, while he himself succeeded  in getting Cimon banished by ostracism, as a friend of Sparta and a  hater of the people, although he was second to no Athenian in birth or  fortune, and won most brilliant victories over the Persians, and had  filled Athens with plunder and spoils of war. So great was the power of  Pericles with the common people.    One of the provisions of ostracism was that the person banished should  remain in exile for ten years. But during this period the Lacedaemonians  with a great force invaded the territory of Tanagra, and, as the  Athenians at once marched out to attack them, Cimon came back from  exile, took his place in full armor among the ranks of his own tribe,  and hoped by distinguishing himself in the battle among his  fellow-citizens to prove the falsehood of the Laconian sympathies with  which he had been charged. However, the friends of Pericles drove him  away, as an exile. On the other hand, Pericles fought more bravely in  that battle than he had ever fought before, and surpassed everyone in  reckless daring. The friends of Cimon also, whom Pericles had accused of  Laconian leanings, fell, all together, in their ranks; and the Athenians  felt great sorrow for their treatment of Cimon, and a great longing for  his restoration, now that they had lost a great battle on the frontier,  and expected to be hard pressed during the summer by the Lacedaemonians.  Pericles, perceiving this, lost no time in gratifying the popular wish,  but himself proposed the decree for his recall; and Cimon on his return  reconciled the two states, for he was on familiar terms with the  Spartans, who were hated by Pericles and the other leaders of the common  people. Some say that, before Cimon's recall by Pericles, a secret  compact was made with him by Elpinice, Cimon's sister, that Cimon was to  proceed on foreign service against the Persians with a fleet of two  hundred ships, while Pericles was to retain his power in the city. It is  also said that, when Cimon was being tried for his life, Elpinice  softened the resentment of Pericles, who was one of those appointed to  impeach him. When Elpinice came to beg her brother's life of him, he  answered with a smile, \"Elpinice, you are too old to meddle in affairs  of this sort.\" But, for all that, he spoke only once, for form's sake,  and pressed Cimon less than any of his other prosecutors. How, then, can  one put any faith in Idomeneus, when he accuses Pericles of procuring  the assassination of his friend and colleague Ephialtes, because he was  jealous of his reputation? This seems an ignoble calumny which Idomeneus  has drawn from some obscure source to fling at a man who, no doubt, was  not faultless, but of a generous spirit and noble mind, incapable of  entertaining so savage and brutal a design. Ephialtes was disliked and  feared by the nobles, and was inexorable in punishing those who wronged  the people; wherefore his enemies had him assassinated by means of  Aristodicus of Tanagra. This we are told by Aristotle. Cimon died in  Cyprus while in command of the Athenian forces.    The nobles now perceived that Pericles was the most important man in the  state, and far more powerful than any other citizen; wherefore, as they  still hoped to check his authority, and not allow him to be omnipotent,  they set up Thucydides, of the township of Alopecae, as his rival, a man  of good sense and a relative of Cimon, but less of a warrior and more of  a politician, who, by watching his opportunities, and opposing Pericles  in debate, soon brought about a balance of power. He did not allow the  nobles to mix themselves up with the people in the public assembly as  they had been wont to do, so that their dignity was lost among the  masses; but he collected them into a separate body, and by thus  concentrating their strength was able to use it to counterbalance that  of the other party. From the beginning these two factions had been but  imperfectly welded together, because their tendencies were different;  but now the struggle for power between Pericles and Thucydides drew a  sharp line of demarcation between them, and one was called the party of  the Many, the other that of the Few. Pericles now courted the people in  every way, constantly arranging public spectacles, festivals, and  processions in the city, by which he educated the Athenians to take  pleasure in refined amusements; and also he sent out sixty triremes to  cruise every year, in which many of the people served for hire for eight  months, learning and practising seamanship. Besides this he sent a  thousand settlers to the Chersonese, five hundred to Naxos, half as many  to Andros, a thousand to dwell among the Thracian tribe of the Bisaltae,  and others to the new colony in Italy founded by the city of Sybaris,  which was named Thurii. By this means he relieved the state of numerous  idle agitators, assisted the necessitous, and overawed the allies of  Athens by placing his colonists near them to watch their behavior.    The building of the temples, by which Athens was adorned, the people  delighted, and the rest of the world astonished, and which now alone  prove that the tales of the ancient power and glory of Greece are no  fables, was what particularly excited the spleen of the opposite  faction, who inveighed against him in the public assembly, declaring  that the Athenians had disgraced themselves by transferring the common  treasury of the Greeks from the island of Delos to their own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10136"],[0,"The Book of Household Management (#7)"],[1,"cleanliness in the
