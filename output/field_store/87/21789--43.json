Why shouldn't I look at his study if I like? I've a  jolly good mind to go up and have another squint.\"    Harvey warmly approved the scheme.    \"No, I don't think I will,\" said Renford with a yawn. \"It's such a fag  going upstairs.\"    \"Yes, isn't it?\" said Harvey.    \"And he's such a beast, too.\"    \"Yes, isn't he?\" said Harvey.    \"I'm jolly glad his study _has_ been ragged,\" continued the  vindictive Renford.    \"It's jolly exciting, isn't it?\" added Harvey. \"And I thought this term  was going to be slow. The Easter term generally is.\"    This remark seemed to suggest a train of thought to Renford, who made  the following cryptic observation. \"Have you seen them today?\"    To the ordinary person the words would have conveyed little meaning. To  Harvey they appeared to teem with import.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"I saw them early this morning.\"    \"Were they all right?\"    \"Yes. Splendid.\"    \"Good,\" said Renford.    Barry's friend Drummond was one of those who had visited the scene of  the disaster early, before Mill's energetic hand had repaired the  damage done, and his narrative was consequently in some demand.    \"The place was in a frightful muck,\" he said. \"Everything smashed  except the table; and ink all over the place. Whoever did it must have  been fairly sick with him, or he'd never have taken the trouble to do  it so thoroughly. Made a fair old hash of things, didn't he, Bertie?\"    \"Bertie\" was the form in which the school elected to serve up the name  of De Bertini. Raoul de Bertini was a French boy who had come to Wrykyn  in the previous term. Drummond's father had met his father in Paris,  and Drummond was supposed to be looking after Bertie. They shared a  study together. Bertie could not speak much English, and what he did  speak was, like Mill's furniture, badly broken.    \"Pardon?\" he said.    \"Doesn't matter,\" said Drummond, \"it wasn't anything important. I was  only appealing to you for corroborative detail to give artistic  verisimilitude to a bald and unconvincing narrative.\"    Bertie grinned politely. He always grinned when he was not quite equal  to the intellectual pressure of the conversation. As a consequence of  which, he was generally, like Mrs Fezziwig, one vast, substantial  smile.    \"I never liked Mill much,\" said Barry, \"but I think it's rather bad  luck on the man.\"    \"Once,\" announced M'Todd, solemnly, \"he kicked me--for making a row in  the passage.\" It was plain that the recollection rankled.    Barry would probably have pointed out what an excellent and  praiseworthy act on Mill's part that had been, when Rand-Brown came in.    \"Prefects' meeting?\" he inquired. \"Or haven't they made you a prefect  yet, M'Todd?\"    M'Todd said they had not.    Nobody present liked Rand-Brown, and they looked at him rather  inquiringly, as if to ask what he had come for. A friend may drop in  for a chat. An acquaintance must justify his intrusion.    Rand-Brown ignored the silent inquiry. He seated himself on the table,  and dragged up a chair to rest his legs on.    \"Talking about Mill, of course?\" he said.    \"Yes,\" said Drummond. \"Have you seen his study since it happened?\"    \"Yes.\"    Rand-Brown smiled, as if the recollection amused him. He was one of  those people who do not look their best when they smile.    \"Playing for the first tomorrow, Barry?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Barry, shortly. \"I haven't seen the list.\"    He objected to the introduction of the topic. It is never pleasant to  have to discuss games with the very man one has ousted from the team.    Drummond, too, seemed to feel that the situation was an embarrassing  one, for a few minutes later he got up to go over to the gymnasium.    \"Any of you chaps coming?\" he asked.    Barry and M'Todd thought they would, and the three left the room.    \"Nothing like showing a man you don't want him, eh, Bertie? What do you  think?\" said Rand-Brown.    Bertie grinned politely.          VI    TREVOR REMAINS FIRM      The most immediate effect of telling anybody not to do a thing is to  make him do it, in order to assert his independence. Trevor's first act  on receipt of the letter was to include Barry in the team against the  Town. It was what he would have done in any case, but, under the  circumstances, he felt a peculiar pleasure in doing it. The incident  also had the effect of recalling to his mind the fact that he had tried  Barry in the first instance on his own responsibility, without  consulting the committee. The committee of the first fifteen consisted  of the two old colours who came immediately after the captain on the  list. The powers of a committee varied according to the determination  and truculence of the members of it. On any definite and important  step, affecting the welfare of the fifteen, the captain theoretically  could not move without their approval. But if the captain happened to  be strong-minded and the committee weak, they were apt to be slightly  out of it, and the captain would develop a habit of consulting them a  day or so after he had done a thing. He would give a man his colours,  and inform the committee of it on the following afternoon, when the  thing was done and could not be repealed.    Trevor was accustomed to ask the advice of his lieutenants fairly  frequently. He never gave colours, for instance, off his own bat. It  seemed to him that it might be as well to learn what views Milton and  Allardyce had on the subject of Barry, and, after the Town team had  gone back across the river, defeated by a goal and a try to nil, he  changed and went over to Seymour's to interview Milton.    Milton was in an arm-chair, watching Renford brew tea. His was one of  the few studies in the school in which there was an arm-chair. With the  majority of his contemporaries, it would only run to the portable kind  that fold up.    \"Come and have some tea, Trevor,\" said Milton.    \"Thanks. If there's any going.\"    \"Heaps. Is there anything to eat, Renford?\"    The fag, appealed to on this important point, pondered darkly for a  moment.    \"There _was_ some cake,\" he said.    \"That's all right,\" interrupted Milton, cheerfully. \"Scratch the cake.  I ate it before the match. Isn't there anything else?\"    Milton had a healthy appetite.    \"Then there used to be some biscuits.\"    \"Biscuits are off. I finished 'em yesterday. Look here, young Renford,  what you'd better do is cut across to the shop and get some more cake  and some more biscuits, and tell 'em to put it down to me. And don't be  long.\"    \"A miles better idea would be to send him over to Donaldson's to fetch  something from my study,\" suggested Trevor. \"It isn't nearly so far,  and I've got heaps of stuff.\"    \"Ripping. Cut over to Donaldson's, young Renford. As a matter of fact,\"  he added, confidentially, when the emissary had vanished, \"I'm not half  sure that the other dodge would have worked. They seem to think at the  shop that I've had about enough things on tick lately. I haven't  settled up for last term yet. I've spent all I've got on this study.  What do you think of those photographs?\"        Trevor got up and inspected them. They filled the mantelpiece and most  of the wall above it. They were exclusively theatrical photographs, and  of a variety to suit all tastes. For the earnest student of the drama  there was Sir Henry Irving in _The Bells_, and Mr Martin Harvey in  _The Only Way._ For the admirers of the merely beautiful there  were Messrs Dan Leno and Herbert Campbell.    \"Not bad,\" said Trevor. \"Beastly waste of money.\"    \"Waste of money!\" Milton was surprised and pained at the criticism.  \"Why, you must spend your money on _something.\"_    \"Rot, I call it,\" said Trevor. \"If you want to collect something, why  don't you collect something worth having?\"    Just then Renford came back with the supplies.    \"Thanks,\" said Milton, \"put 'em down. Does the billy boil, young  Renford?\"    Renford asked for explanatory notes.    \"You're a bit of an ass at times, aren't you?\" said Milton, kindly.  \"What I meant was, is the tea ready? If it is, you can scoot. If it  isn't, buck up with it.\"    A sound of bubbling and a rush of steam from the spout of the kettle  proclaimed that the billy did boil. Renford extinguished the Etna, and  left the room, while Milton, murmuring vague formulae about \"one  spoonful for each person and one for the pot\", got out of his chair  with a groan--for the Town match had been an energetic one--and began  to prepare tea.    \"What I really came round about--\" began Trevor.    \"Half a second. I can't find the milk.\"    He went to the door, and shouted for Renford. On that overworked  youth's appearance, the following dialogue took place.    \"Where's the milk?\"    \"What milk?\"    \"My milk.\"    \"There isn't any.\" This in a tone not untinged with triumph, as if the  speaker realised that here was a distinct score to him.    \"No milk?\"    \"No.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"You never had any.\"    \"Well, just cut across--no, half a second. What are you doing  downstairs?\"    \"Having tea.\"    \"Then you've got milk.\"    \"Only a little.\" This apprehensively.    \"Bring it up. You can have what we leave.\"    Disgusted retirement of Master Renford.    \"What I really came about,\" said Trevor again, \"was business.\"    \"Colours?\" inquired Milton, rummaging in the tin for biscuits with  sugar on them. \"Good brand of biscuit you keep, Trevor.\"    \"Yes. I think we might give Alexander and Parker their third.\"    \"All right. Any others?\"    \"Barry his second, do you think?\"    \"Rather. He played a good game today. He's an improvement on  Rand-Brown.\"    \"Glad you think so. I was wondering whether it was the right thing to  do, chucking Rand-Brown out after one trial like that. But still, if  you think Barry's better--\"    \"Streets better. I've had heaps of chances of watching them and  comparing them,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6886"],[0,"First Footsteps in East Africa (#6)"],[1,"so much trouble to native craft. We passed, on the right, the low  island of Masha, belonging to the \"City of the Slave Merchant,\"--  Tajurrah,--and on the left two similar patches of seagirt sand, called  Aybat and Saad el Din. These places supply Zayla, in the Kharif or hot  season [20], with thousands of gulls' eggs,--a great luxury. At noon we  sighted our destination. Zayla is the normal African port,--a strip of  sulphur-yellow sand, with a deep blue dome above, and a foreground of the  darkest indigo. The buildings, raised by refraction, rose high, and  apparently from the bosom of the deep. After hearing the worst accounts of  it, I was pleasantly disappointed by the spectacle of white-washed houses  and minarets, peering above a long low line of brown wall, flanked with  round towers.    As we slowly threaded the intricate coral reefs of the port, a bark came  scudding up to us; it tacked, and the crew proceeded to give news in  roaring tones. Friendship between the Amir of Harar and the governor of  Zayla had been broken; the road through the Eesa Somal had been closed by  the murder of Masud, a favourite slave and adopted son of Sharmarkay; all  strangers had been expelled the city for some misconduct by the Harar  chief; moreover, small-pox was raging there with such violence that the  Galla peasantry would allow neither ingress nor egress. [21] I had the  pleasure of reflecting for some time, dear L., upon the amount of  responsibility incurred by using the phrase \"I will;\" and the only  consolation that suggested itself was the stale assurance that      \"Things at the worst most surely mend.\"    No craft larger than a canoe can ride near Zayla. After bumping once or  twice against the coral reefs, it was considered advisable for our good  ship, the Sahalat, to cast anchor. My companions caused me to dress, put  me with my pipe and other necessaries into a cock-boat, and, wading  through the water, shoved it to shore. Lastly, at Bab el Sahil, the  Seaward or Northern Gate, they proceeded to array themselves in the  bravery of clean Tobes and long daggers strapped round the waist; each man  also slung his targe to his left arm, and in his right hand grasped lance  and javelin. At the gate we were received by a tall black spearman with a  \"Ho there! to the governor;\" and a crowd of idlers gathered to inspect the  strangers. Marshalled by the warder, we traversed the dusty roads--streets  they could not be called--of the old Arab town, ran the gauntlet of a  gaping mob, and finally entering a mat door, found ourselves in the  presence of the governor.    I had met Sharmarkay at Aden, where he received from the authorities  strong injunctions concerning my personal safety: the character of a  Moslem merchant, however, requiring us to appear strangers, an  introduction by our master of ceremonies, the Hammal, followed my  entrance. Sharmarkay was living in an apartment by no means splendid,  preferring an Arish or kind of cow-house,--as the Anglo-Indian Nabobs do  the bungalow              \"with mat half hung,    The walls of plaster and the floors of * * * *,\"    --to all his substantial double-storied houses. The ground was wet and  comfortless; a part of the reed walls was lined with cots bearing  mattresses and silk-covered pillows, a cross between a divan and a couch:  the only ornaments were a few weapons, and a necklace of gaudy beads  suspended near the door. I was placed upon the principal seat: on the  right were the governor and the Hammal; whilst the lowest portion of the  room was occupied by Mohammed Sharmarkay, the son and heir. The rest of  the company squatted upon chairs, or rather stools, of peculiar  construction. Nothing could be duller than this _assemblee_: pipes and  coffee are here unknown; and there is nothing in the East to act  substitute for them. [22]    The governor of Zayla, El Hajj Sharmarkay bin Ali Salih, is rather a  remarkable man. He is sixteenth, according to his own account, in descent  from Ishak el Hazrami [23], the saintly founder of the great Gerhajis and  Awal tribes. His enemies derive him from a less illustrious stock; and the  fairness of his complexion favours the report that his grandfather Salih  was an Abyssinian slave. Originally the Nacoda or captain of a native  craft, he has raised himself, chiefly by British influence, to the  chieftainship of his tribe. [24] As early as May, 1825, he received from  Captain Bagnold, then our resident at Mocha, a testimonial and a reward,  for a severe sword wound in the left arm, received whilst defending the  lives of English seamen. [25] He afterwards went to Bombay, where he was  treated with consideration; and about fifteen years ago he succeeded the  Sayyid Mohammed el Barr as governor of Zayla and its dependencies, under  the Ottoman Pasha in Western Arabia.    The Hajj Sharmarkay in his youth was a man of Valour: he could not read or  write; but he carried in battle four spears [26], and his sword-cut was  recognisable. He is now a man about sixty years old, at least six feet two  inches in stature, large-limbed, and raw-boned: his leanness is hidden by  long wide robes. He shaves his head and upper lip Shafei-fashion, and his  beard is represented by a ragged tuft of red-stained hair on each side of  his chin. A visit to Aden and a doctor cost him one eye, and the other is  now white with age. His dress is that of an Arab, and he always carries  with him a broad-bladed, silver-hilted sword. Despite his years, he is a  strong, active, and energetic man, ever looking to the \"main chance.\" With  one foot in the grave, he meditates nothing but the conquest of Harar and  Berberah, which, making him master of the seaboard, would soon extend his  power as in days of old even to Abyssinia. [27] To hear his projects, you  would fancy them the offspring of a brain in the prime of youth: in order  to carry them out he would even assist in suppressing the profitable  slave-trade. [28]    After half an hour's visit I was led by the Hajj through the streets of  Zayla [29], to one of his substantial houses of coralline and mud  plastered over with glaring whitewash. The ground floor is a kind of  warehouse full of bales and boxes, scales and buyers. A flight of steep  steps leads into a long room with shutters to exclude the light, floored  with tamped earth, full of \"evening flyers\" [30], and destitute of  furniture. Parallel to it are three smaller apartments; and above is a  terraced roof, where they who fear not the dew and the land-breeze sleep.  [31] I found a room duly prepared; the ground was spread with mats, and  cushions against the walls denoted the Divan: for me was placed a Kursi or  cot, covered with fine Persian rugs and gaudy silk and satin pillows. The  Hajj installed us with ceremony, and insisted, despite my remonstrances,  upon occupying the floor whilst I sat on the raised seat. After ushering  in supper, he considerately remarked that travelling is fatiguing, and  left us to sleep.    The well-known sounds of El Islam returned from memory. Again the  melodious chant of the Muezzin,--no evening bell can compare with it for  solemnity and beauty,--and in the neighbouring mosque, the loudly intoned  Amin and Allaho Akbar,--far superior to any organ,--rang in my ear. The  evening gun of camp was represented by the Nakkarah, or kettle-drum,  sounded about seven P.M. at the southern gate; and at ten a second  drumming warned the paterfamilias that it was time for home, and thieves,  and lovers,--that it was the hour for bastinado. Nightfall was ushered in  by the song, the dance, and the marriage festival,--here no permission is  required for \"native music in the lines,\"--and muffled figures flitted  mysteriously through the dark alleys.           *       *       *       *       *    After a peep through the open window, I fell asleep, feeling once more at  home.      FOOTNOTES    [1] \"A tradition exists,\" says Lieut. Cruttenden, \"amongst the people of  Harar, that the prosperity of their city depends upon the exclusion of all  travellers not of the Moslem faith, and all Christians are specially  interdicted.\" These freaks of interdiction are common to African rulers,  who on occasions of war, famine or pestilence, struck with some  superstitious fear, close their gates to strangers.    [2] The 6th of Safar in 1864 corresponds with our 28th October. The Hadis  is [Arabic] \"when the 6th of Safar went forth, my faith from the cloud  came forth.\"    [3] The Abyssinian law of detaining guests,--Pedro Covilhao the first  Portuguese envoy (A.D. 1499) lived and died a prisoner there,--appears to  have been the Christian modification of the old Ethiopic rite of  sacrificing strangers.    [4] It would be wonderful if Orientals omitted to romance about the origin  of such an invention as the Dayrah or compass. Shaykh Majid is said to  have been a Syrian saint, to whom Allah gave the power of looking upon  earth, as though it were a ball in his hand. Most Moslems agree in  assigning this origin to the Dayrah, and the Fatihah in honor of the holy  man, is still repeated by the pious mariner.    Easterns do not \"box the compass\" after our fashion: with them each point  has its own name, generally derived from some prominent star on the  horizon. Of these I subjoin a list as in use amongst the Somal, hoping  that it may be useful to Oriental students. The names in hyphens are those  given in a paper on the nautical instrument of the Arabs by Jas. Prinseps  (Journal of the As. Soc., December 1836). The learned secretary appears  not to have heard the legend of Shaykh Majid, for he alludes to the  \"Majidi Kitab\" or Oriental Ephemeris, without any explanation.
