She felt  really hurt that Beric should view even the possibility of her  going away with equanimity, and she very shortly went off to her  own apartment; while a few minutes later, Beric, after bidding  goodbye to Caius, started to rejoin Boduoc, whom he found waiting  at the edge of the forest.    That evening Berenice said to her father, \"I was angry with Beric  today, father.\"    \"Were you, child? what about?\"    \"I told him that perhaps in another three years, when I was sixteen,  you would take me to Rome, and that I thought, perhaps, if we went  there you would not come back again; and instead of being very  much grieved, as I thought he would, he seemed quite pleased at the  idea. Of course he said he was sorry, but he did not really seem  to be, and he says he thought it would be very much better for me.  I thought he was grateful, father, and liked us very much, and now  I am quite disappointed in him.\"    Caius was silent for a minute or two.    \"I do not think Beric is ungrateful,\" he said, \"and I am sure that  he likes us, Berenice.\"    \"He said he did, father, that he cared for us more than anyone except  his mother; but if he cared for us, surely he would be very, very  sorry for us to go away.\"    \"Beric is a Briton, my dear, and we are Romans. By this time he  must have thoroughly learned his people's feelings towards us. I  have never believed, as some do, that Britain is as yet completely  conquered, and that when we have finished with the Silures in the  west our work will be completely done.    \"Beric, who knows his countrymen, may feel this even more strongly  than I do, and may know that, sooner or later, there will be another  great effort on the part of the Britons to drive us out. It may be  a year, and it may be twenty, but I believe myself that some day we  shall have a fierce struggle to maintain our hold here, and Beric,  who may see this also, and who knows the feeling of his countrymen,  may wish that we should be away before the storm comes.    \"There is but little doubt, Berenice, that we despise these people  too much, still less that we treat them harshly and cruelly. Were  I propraetor of Britain, I would rule them differently. I am but the  commander of a legion, and my duty is but to rule my men. I would  punish, and punish sternly, all attempts at rising; but I would  give them no causes for discontent. We treat them as if their spirit  were altogether broken, as if they and their possessions were but  our chattels, as if they possessed no rights, not even the right to  live. Some day we shall find our mistake, and when the time comes  the awakening will be a rude one. It is partly because I see dimly  the storm gathering in the distance that I long to be home again.  As long as your mother lived this seemed a home to me, now I desire  rest and quiet. I have done my share of fighting, I have won honour  enough, and I may look before long to be a general; but I have  had enough of it, and long for my quiet villa in the Alban hills,  with an occasional visit to Rome, where you can take part in its  gaieties, and I can have the use of the libraries stored with the  learning of the world. So do not think harshly of Beric, my child;  he may see the distant storm more plainly than I do. I am sure that  he cares for us, and if he is glad at the news that we are going,  it is because he wishes us away and in safety before the trouble  comes.    \"Nero has come to the imperial throne, and the men he is sending  hither are of a widely different stamp from the lieutenants of  Claudius. The latter knew that the Britons can fight, and that, wild  and untutored as they are, it needed all the skill and courage of  Ostorius and Vespasian to reduce them to order. The newcomers regard  them as slaves to be trampled upon, robbed, and ill used as they  choose. I am sure they will find their mistake. As long as they  deal only with the tribes thoroughly subdued, the Trinobantes, the  Cantii, the Belgae, and the Dumnonii, all may be quiet; they dare  not move. But the Iceni and Brigantes, although they both have  felt the weight of our swords, are still partly independent, and  if pressed too severely will assuredly revolt, and if they give the  signal all Britain may be up in arms again. I am scoffed at if I  venture to hint to these newcomers that there is life yet in Britain.  Dwelling here in a Roman city, it seems to them absurd that there  can be danger from the savages who roam in the forests that stretch  away from beyond the river at our very feet to the far distant  north, to regions of which we are absolutely ignorant. I regard  what Beric has said as another warning.\"    \"But I thought that Beric was our friend, father, and you told me  you had heard that he was teaching his countrymen how great is our  history.\"    \"Beric is a Briton in the midst of Britons, child. He is a partially  tamed wolf cub, and had he been sent to Rome and remained there he  would have done credit to our teaching. He is fond of study, and  at the same time fond of arms; he might have turned out a wise  citizen or a valiant soldier. But this was not done. He has gone  back again among the wolves, and whatever his feelings towards  us personally may be, he must side with his own people. Did they  suspect him of being Roman at heart they would tear him in pieces.  I believe that as he knows our strength, and that in the end we  must conquer, his influence will always be on the side of peace;  but if arms are taken up he will have no choice but to side with  his countrymen, and should it be another ten years before the cloud  bursts, he may be one of our most formidable opponents. Don't blame  him, child; he only shows his regard for you, by wishing you back  safely in Rome before trouble arises.\"    \"You are just in time, Beric,\" Boduoc said as the young chief  joined him. \"The sun is but a hand's breadth above that hill. Here  are your spear and sword where you hid them, though why you should  have done it I know not, seeing that they have not yet ventured to  order us to disarm.\"    \"And if they did we should not obey them, Boduoc; but as the  Trinobantes have long been forbidden to carry arms, it might have  caused trouble had I gone armed into the town, and we don't want  trouble at present. I went on a peaceful visit, and there was no  occasion for me to carry my weapons. But give me a piece of that  deer flesh and an oaten cake; we have a long march before us.\"    \"Why, did you not eat with them?\"    \"No. I was, of course, invited, but I had but a short time to stop  and did not wish it to seem as if I had come for a taste of Roman  dainties again.\"    As soon as the meal was eaten they set out. It was but a track  through the forest, for although the trees had been cleared away for  a width of twenty feet there was but little traffic, for the road  was seldom traversed, save by an occasional messenger from Prasutagus.  It had been used by the legions at the time that Ostorius had  built a line of forts stretching from the Nen to the Severn, and by  it they had advanced when the Iceni had risen; but from that time  it had been unused by them, as the Iceni had paid their tribute  regularly, and held aloof from all hostile movements against them.  Prasutagus was always profuse in his assurance of friendship towards  Rome, and save that the Roman officers visited his capital once a  year to receive their tribute, they troubled but little about the  Iceni, having their hands occupied by their wars in the south and  west, while their main road to the north ran far to the west of  Camalodunum.    \"We shall arrive about midnight,\" Beric said as they strode along.    \"We may or we may not,\" Boduoc said curtly.    \"What is to prevent us, Boduoc?\"    \"Well, the wolves may prevent us, Beric; we heard them howling  several times as we came along this morning. The rapacious brutes  have not been so bold for years, and it is high time that we hunted  them down, or at any rate made our part of the country too hot to  hold them. I told Borgon before I started that if we did not return  by an hour after midnight it would be because we had been obliged  to take to a tree, and that he had better bring out a party at the  first break of day to rescue us.\"    \"But we have never had any trouble of that kind while we have been  hunting, Boduoc.\"    \"No; but I think there must have been some great hunts up in Norfolk,  and that the brutes have come south. Certain it is that there have  in the last week been great complaints of them, and, as you know,  it was for that reason that your mother ordered all the men of the  tribe to assemble by tomorrow morning to make war against them.  The people in the farms and villages are afraid to stay out after  nightfall. No man with arms in his hands fears a wolf, or even two  or three of them, in the daytime; but when they are in packs they  are formidable assailants, even to a strong party. Things are  getting as bad now as they were twenty years ago. My father has  told me that during one hard winter they destroyed full half our  herds, and that hundreds of people were devoured by them. They had  to erect stockades round the villages and drive in all the cattle,  and half the men kept guard by turns, keeping great fires alight  to frighten them away. When we have cleared the land of those two  legged wolves the Romans, we shall have to make a general war upon  them, for truly they are becoming a perfect scourge to the land.  It is not like the wild boar, of which there might with advantage  be more, for they do but little harm, getting their food for the  most part in the woods, and furnishing us with good eating as well  as good sport. But the wolves give us nothing in return, and save  for the sport no one would trouble to hunt them; and it is only by  a general order for their destruction, or by the offer of a reward  for their heads, that we shall get rid of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7050"],[0,"The Swoop! or, How Clarence Saved England: A Tale of the Great Invasion (#6)"],[1," Mullins, the prominent sand-bagger, as he emerged from  his twenty years' retirement at Dartmoor, and booked him solid for a  thirty-six months' lecturing tour on the McGinnis circuit. It was to  him, too, that Joe Brown, who could eat eight pounds of raw meat in  seven and a quarter minutes, owed his first chance of displaying his  gifts to the wider public of the vaudeville stage.    The idea of securing the services of the invading generals came to him  in a flash.    \"S'elp me!\" he cried. \"I believe they'd go big; put 'em on where you  like.\"    Solly was a man of action. Within a minute he was talking to the  managing director of the Mammoth Syndicate Halls on the telephone. In  five minutes the managing director had agreed to pay Prince Otto of  Saxe-Pfennig five hundred pounds a week, if he could be prevailed upon  to appear. In ten minutes the Grand Duke Vodkakoff had been engaged,  subject to his approval, at a weekly four hundred and fifty by the  Stone-Rafferty circuit. And in a quarter of an hour Solly Quhayne,  having pushed his way through a mixed crowd of Tricky Serios and  Versatile Comedians and Patterers who had been waiting to see him for  the last hour and a half, was bowling off in a taximeter-cab to the  Russian lines at Hampstead.    General Vodkakoff received his visitor civilly, but at first without  enthusiasm. There were, it seemed, objections to his becoming an  artiste. Would he have to wear a properly bald head and sing songs  about wanting people to see his girl? He didn't think he could. He had  only sung once in his life, and that was twenty years ago at a  bump-supper at Moscow University. And even then, he confided to Mr.  Quhayne, it had taken a decanter and a-half of neat vodka to bring him  up to the scratch.    The agent ridiculed the idea.    \"Why, your Grand Grace,\" he cried, \"there won't be anything of that  sort. You ain't going to be starred as a _comic_. You're a Refined  Lecturer and Society Monologue Artist. 'How I Invaded England,' with  lights down and the cinematograph going. We can easily fake the  pictures.\"    The Grand Duke made another objection.    \"I understand,\" he said, \"it is etiquette for music-hall artists in  their spare time to eat--er--fried fish with their fingers. Must I do  that? I doubt if I could manage it.\"    Mr Quhayne once more became the human semaphore.    \"S'elp me! Of course you needn't! All the leading pros, eat it with a  spoon. Bless you, you can be the refined gentleman on the Halls same as  anywhere else. Come now, your Grand Grace, is it a deal? Four hundred  and fifty chinking o'Goblins a week for one hall a night, and  press-agented at eight hundred and seventy-five. S'elp me! Lauder  doesn't get it, not in England.\"    The Grand Duke reflected. The invasion has proved more expensive than  he had foreseen. The English are proverbially a nation of shopkeepers,  and they had put up their prices in all the shops for his special  benefit. And he was expected to do such a lot of tipping. Four hundred  and fifty a week would come in uncommonly useful.    \"Where do I sign?\" he asked, extending his hand for the agreement.           *        *        *        *        *    Five minutes later Mr. Quhayne was urging his taxidriver to exceed the  speed-limit in the direction of Tottenham.          Chapter 3    A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF THE SITUATION      Clarence read the news of the two engagements on the tape at the office  of his paper, but the first intimation the general public had of it was  through the medium of headlines:--        MUSIC-HALL SENSATION      INVADING GENERALS' GIGANTIC SALARIES      RUMOURED RESENTMENT OF V.A.F.      WHAT WILL WATER-RATS DO?      INTERVIEW WITH MR. HARRY LAUDER    Clarence chuckled grimly as the tape clicked out the news. The end had  begun. To sow jealousy between the rival generals would have been easy.  To sow it between two rival music-hall artistes would be among the  world's softest jobs.    Among the general public, of course, the announcement created a  profound sensation. Nothing else was talked about in train and omnibus.  The papers had leaders on the subject. At first the popular impression  was that the generals were going to do a comedy duo act of the  Who-Was-It-I-Seen-You-Coming-Down-the-Street-With? type, and there was  disappointment when it was found that the engagements were for  different halls. Rumours sprang up. It was said that the Grand Duke had  for years been an enthusiastic amateur sword-swallower, and had,  indeed, come to England mainly for the purpose of getting bookings;  that the Prince had a secure reputation in Potsdam as a singer of songs  in the George Robey style; that both were expert trick-cyclists.    Then the truth came out. Neither had any specialities; they would  simply appear and deliver lectures.    The feeling in the music-hall world was strong. The Variety Artists'  Federation debated the advisability of another strike. The Water Rats,  meeting in mystic secrecy in a Maiden Lane public-house, passed fifteen  resolutions in an hour and a quarter. Sir Harry Lauder, interviewed by  the _Era_, gave it as his opinion that both the Grand Duke and the  Prince were gowks, who would do well to haud their blether. He himself  proposed to go straight to America, where genuine artists were cheered  in the streets and entertained at haggis dinners, and not forced to  compete with amateur sumphs and gonuphs from other countries.    Clarence, brooding over the situation like a Providence, was glad to  see that already the new move had weakened the invaders' power. The day  after the announcement in the press of the approaching _debut_ of  the other generals, the leader of the army of Monaco had hurried to the  agents to secure an engagement for himself. He held out the special  inducement of card-tricks, at which he was highly skilled. The agents  had received him coldly. Brown and Day had asked him to call again.  Foster had sent out a message regretting that he was too busy to see  him. At de Freece's he had been kept waiting in the ante-room for two  hours in the midst of a bevy of Sparkling Comediennes of pronounced  peroxidity and blue-chinned men in dusty bowler-hats, who told each  other how they had gone with a bang at Oakham and John o'Groats, and  had then gone away in despair.    On the following day, deeply offended, he had withdrawn his troops from  the country.    The strength of the invaders was melting away little by little.    \"How long?\" murmured Clarence Chugwater, as he worked at the  tape-machine. \"How long?\"          Chapter 4    CLARENCE HEARS IMPORTANT NEWS      It was Clarence's custom to leave the office of his newspaper at one  o'clock each day, and lunch at a neighbouring Aerated Bread shop. He  did this on the day following the first appearance of the two generals  at their respective halls. He had brought an early edition of the paper  with him, and in the intervals of dealing with his glass of milk and  scone and butter, he read the report of the performances.    Both, it seemed, had met with flattering receptions, though they had  appeared nervous. The Russian general especially, whose style, said the  critic, was somewhat reminiscent of Mr. T. E. Dunville, had made  himself a great favourite with the gallery. The report concluded by  calling attention once more to the fact that the salaries paid to the  two--eight hundred and seventy-five pounds a week each--established a  record in music-hall history on this side of the Atlantic.    Clarence had just finished this when there came to his ear the faint  note of a tarantula singing to its young.    He looked up. Opposite him, at the next table, was seated a youth of  fifteen, of a slightly grubby aspect. He was eyeing Clarence closely.    Clarence took off his spectacles, polished them, and replaced them on  his nose. As he did so, the thin gruffle of the tarantula sounded once  more. Without changing his expression, Clarence cautiously uttered the  deep snarl of a sand-eel surprised while bathing.    It was sufficient. The other rose to his feet, holding his right hand  on a line with his shoulder, palm to the front, thumb resting on the  nail of the little finger, and the other three fingers upright.    Clarence seized his hat by the brim at the back, and moved it swiftly  twice up and down.    The other, hesitating no longer, came over to his table.    \"Pip-pip!\" he said, in an undertone.    \"Toodleoo and God save the King!\" whispered Clarence.    The mystic ceremony which always takes place when two Boy Scouts meet  in public was complete.    \"Private Biggs of the Eighteenth Tarantulas, sir,\" said the boy  respectfully, for he had recognised Clarence.    Clarence inclined his head.    \"You may sit, Private Biggs,\" he said graciously. \"You have news to  impart?\"    \"News, sir, that may be of vital importance.\"    \"Say on.\"    Private Biggs, who had brought his sparkling limado and a bath-bun with  him from the other table, took a sip of the former, and embarked upon  his narrative.    \"I am employed, sir,\" he said, \"as a sort of junior clerk and  office-boy by Mr. Solly Quhayne, the music-hall agent.\"    Clarence tapped his brow thoughtfully; then his face cleared.    \"I remember. It was he who secured the engagements of the generals.\"    \"The same, sir.\"    \"Proceed.\"    The other resumed his story.    \"It is my duty to sit in a sort of rabbit-hutch in the outer office,  take the callers' names, and especially to see that they don't get  through to Mr. Quhayne till he wishes to receive them. That is the most  exacting part of my day's work. You wouldn't believe how full of the  purest swank some of these pros. are. Tell you they've got an  appointment as soon as look at you. Artful beggars!\"    Clarence nodded sympathetically.    \"This morning an Acrobat and Society Contortionist made such a fuss  that in the end I had to take his card in to the private office. Mr.  Quhayne was"]]]
