THE VANDERDECKEN OF TAPPAN ZEE    It is Saturday night; the swell of the Hudson lazily heaves against the  shores of Tappan Zee, the cliff above Tarrytown where the white lady  cries on winter nights is pale in starlight, and crickets chirp in the  boskage. It is so still that the lap of oars can be heard coming across  the water at least a mile away. Some small boat, evidently, but of heavy  build, for it takes a vigorous hand to propel it, and now there is a  grinding of oars on thole-pins. Strange that it is not yet seen, for the  sound is near. Look! Is that a shadow crossing that wrinkle of starlight  in the water? The oars have stopped, and there is no wind to make that  sound of a sigh.    Ho, Rambout Van Dam! Is it you? Are you still expiating your oath to pull  from Kakiat to Spuyten Duyvil before the dawn of Sabbath, if it takes you  a month of Sundays? Better for you had you passed the night with your  roistering friends at Kakiat, or started homeward earlier, for  Sabbath-breaking is no sin now, and you, poor ghost, will find little  sympathy for your plight. Grant that your month of Sundays, or your cycle  of months of Sundays, be soon up, for it is sad to be reminded that we  may be punished for offences many years forgotten. When the sun is high  to-morrow a score of barges will vex the sea of Tappan, each crowded with  men and maids from New Amsterdam, jigging to profane music and refreshing  themselves with such liquors as you, Rambout, never even smelled--be  thankful for that much. If your shade sits blinking at them from the  wooded buttresses of the Palisades, you must repine, indeed, at the  hardness of your fate.          THE GALLOPING HESSIAN    In the flower-gemmed cemetery of Tarrytown, where gentle Irving sleeps, a  Hessian soldier was interred after sustaining misfortune in the loss of  his head in one of the Revolutionary battles. For a long time after he  was buried it was the habit of this gentleman to crawl from his grave at  unseemly hours and gallop about the country, sending shivers through the  frames of many worthy people, who shrank under their blankets when they  heard the rush of hoofs along the unlighted roads.    In later times there lived in Tarrytown--so named because of the tarrying  habits of Dutch gossips on market days, though some hard-minded people  insist that Tarwe-town means Wheat-towna gaunt schoolmaster, one Ichabod  Crane, who cherished sweet sentiments for Katrina Van Tassell, the buxom  daughter of a farmer, also a famous maker of pies and doughnuts. Ichabod  had been calling late one evening, and, his way home being long,  Katrina's father lent him a horse to make the journey; but even with this  advantage the youth set out with misgivings, for he had to pass the  graveyard.    As it was near the hour when the Hessian was to ride, he whistled feebly  to keep his courage up, but when he came to the dreaded spot the whistle  died in a gasp, for he heard the tread of a horse. On looking around, his  hair bristled and his heart came up like a plug in his throat to hinder  his breathing, for he saw a headless horseman coming over the ridge  behind him, blackly defined against the starry sky. Setting spurs to his  nag with a hope of being first to reach Sleepy Hollow bridge, which the  spectre never passed, the unhappy man made the best possible time in that  direction, for his follower was surely overtaking him. Another minute and  the bridge would be reached; but, to Ichabod's horror, the Hessian dashed  alongside and, rising in his stirrups, flung his head full at the  fugitive's back. With a squeal of fright the schoolmaster rolled into a  mass of weeds by the wayside, and for some minutes he remained there,  knowing and remembering nothing.    Next morning farmer Van Tassell's horse was found grazing in a field near  Sleepy Hollow, and a man who lived some miles southward reported that he  had seen Mr. Crane striding as rapidly along the road to New York as his  lean legs could take him, and wearing a pale and serious face as he kept  his march. There were yellow stains on the back of his coat, and the man  who restored the horse found a smashed pumpkin in the broken bushes  beside the road. Ichabod never returned to Tarrytown, and when Brom  Bones, a stout young ploughman and taphaunter, married Katrina, people  made bold to say that he knew more about the galloping Hessian than any  one else, though they believed that he never had reason to be jealous of  Ichabod Crane.          STORM SHIP OF THE HUDSON    It was noised about New Amsterdam, two hundred years ago, that a round  and bulky ship flying Dutch colors from her lofty quarter was careering  up the harbor in the teeth of a north wind, through the swift waters of  an ebbing tide, and making for the Hudson. A signal from the Battery to  heave to and account for herself being disregarded, a cannon was trained  upon her, and a ball went whistling through her cloudy and imponderable  mass, for timbers she had none. Some of the sailor-folk talked of mirages  that rose into the air of northern coasts and seas, but the wise ones put  their fingers beside their noses and called to memory the Flying  Dutchman, that wanderer of the seas whose captain, having sworn that he  would round Cape Horn in spite of heaven and hell, has been beating to  and fro along the bleak Fuegian coast and elsewhere for centuries, being  allowed to land but once in seven years, when he can break the curse if  he finds a girl who will love him. Perhaps Captain Vanderdecken found  this maiden of his hopes in some Dutch settlement on the Hudson, or  perhaps he expiated his rashness by prayer and penitence; howbeit, he  never came down again, unless he slipped away to sea in snow or fog so  dense that watchers and boatmen saw nothing of his passing. A few old  settlers declared the vessel to be the Half Moon, and there were some who  testified to seeing that identical ship with Hudson and his spectre crew  on board making for the Catskills to hold carouse.    This fleeting vision has been confounded with the storm ship that lurks  about the foot of the Palisades and Point-no-Point, cruising through  Tappan Zee at night when a gale is coming up. The Hudson is four miles  wide at Tappan, and squalls have space enough to gather force; hence,  when old skippers saw the misty form of a ship steal out from the shadows  of the western hills, then fly like a gull from shore to shore, catching  the moonlight on her topsails, but showing no lanterns, they made to  windward and dropped anchor, unless their craft were stanch and their  pilot's brains unvexed with liquor. On summer nights, when falls that  curious silence which is ominous of tempest, the storm ship is not only  seen spinning across the mirror surface of the river, but the voices of  the crew are heard as they chant at the braces and halyards in words  devoid of meaning to the listeners.          WHY SPUYTEN DUYVIL IS SO NAMED    The tide-water creek that forms the upper boundary of Manhattan Island is  known to dwellers in tenements round about as \"Spittin' Divvle.\" The  proper name of it is Spuyten Duyvil, and this, in turn, is the  compression of a celebrated boast by Anthony Van Corlaer. This  redoubtable gentleman, famous for fat, long wind, and long whiskers, was  trumpeter for the garrison at New Amsterdam, which his countrymen had  just bought for twenty-four dollars, and he sounded the brass so sturdily  that in the fight between the Dutch and Indians at the Dey Street peach  orchard his blasts struck more terror into the red men's hearts than did  the matchlocks of his comrades. William the Testy vowed that Anthony and  his trumpet were garrison enough for all Manhattan Island, for he argued  that no regiment of Yankees would approach near enough to be struck with  lasting deafness, as must have happened if they came when Anthony was  awake.    Peter Stuyvesant-Peter the Headstrong--showed his appreciation of  Anthony's worth by making him his esquire, and when he got news of an  English expedition on its way to seize his unoffending colony, he at once  ordered Anthony to rouse the villages along the Hudson with a trumpet  call to war. The esquire took a hurried leave of six or eight ladies,  each of whom delighted to believe that his affections were lavished on  her alone, and bravely started northward, his trumpet hanging on one  side, a stone bottle, much heavier, depending from the other. It was a  stormy evening when he arrived at the upper end of the island, and there  was no ferryman in sight, so, after fuming up and down the shore, he  swallowed a mighty draught of Dutch courage,--for he was as accomplished  a performer on the horn as on the trumpet,--and swore with ornate and  voluminous oaths that he would swim the stream \"in spite of the devil\"  [En spuyt den Duyvil].    He plunged in, and had gone half-way across when the Evil One, not to be  spited, appeared as a huge moss-bunker, vomiting boiling water and  lashing a fiery tail. This dreadful fish seized Anthony by the leg; but  the trumpeter was game, for, raising his instrument to his lips, he  exhaled his last breath through it in a defiant blast that rang through  the woods for miles and made the devil himself let go for a moment. Then  he was dragged below, his nose shining through the water more and more  faintly, until, at last, all sight of him was lost. The failure of his  mission resulted in the downfall of the Dutch in America, for, soon  after, the English won a bloodless victory, and St. George's cross  flaunted from the ramparts where Anthony had so often saluted the setting  sun. But it was years, even then, before he was hushed, for in stormy  weather it was claimed that the shrill of his trumpet could be heard near  the creek that he had named, sounding above the deeper roar of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6622"],[0,"Legends That Every Child Should Know; a Selection of the Great Legends of All (#6)"],[1,"thee of thy daughter and of thy  kingdom to boot. He is even now plotting with her in her bower.\"    Then the King galloped home in a rage, and burst into Riminild's bower,  and there, sure enough, he found Horn, as Figold had said. \"Out of my  land, base foundling!\" he cried. \"What have you to do with the young  Queen here?\"    And Horn departed without a word. He went to the stable, saddled his  horse, then he girded on his sword and returned to the palace; he  crossed the hall and entered Riminild's apartments for the last time.  \"Lady,\" he said, \"I must go forth to strange lands for seven years; at  the end of that time I will either return or send a messenger; but if I  do neither, you may give yourself to another, nor wait longer for me.  Now kiss me a long farewell.\"    Riminild promised to be true to him, and she took a gold ring from her  finger, saying, \"Wear this above the other which I gave you, or if you  grow weary of them, fling them both away, and watch to see if its two  stones change colour; for if I die, the one will turn pale, and if I am  false, the other will turn red.\"    \"Riminild,\" said Childe Horn, \"I am yours for evermore! There is a pool  of clear water under a tree in the garden--go there daily and look for  my shadow in the water. If you see it not, know that I am unaltered; and  if you see it, know that I no longer love thee.\"    Then they embraced and kissed each other, and Horn parted from her, and  rode down to the coast, and took passage on a ship bound for Ireland.  When he landed there, two of its King's sons met him, and took him to  their father, good King Thurstan, before whom Horn bowed low, and the  King bade him welcome, and praised his beauty, and asked his name.    \"My name is Good Courage,\" said Horn boldly, and the King was well  pleased.    Now, at Christmas, King Thurstan made a great feast, and in the midst of  it one rushed in crying, \"Guests, O King! We are besieged by five  heathen chiefs, and one of them proclaims himself ready to fight any  three of our knights single handed to-morrow at sunrise.\"    \"That would be but a sorry Christmas service,\" said King Thurstan; \"who  can advise me how best to answer them?\" Then Horn spoke up from his seat  at the table, \"If these pagans are ready to fight, one against three,  what may not a Christian dare? I will adventure myself against them all,  and one after another they shall go down before my good sword.\"    Heavy of heart was King Thurstan that night, and little did he sleep.  But \"Sir Good Courage\" rose early and buckled on his armour. Then he  went to the King and said, \"Now, Sir King, come with me to the field,  and I will show you in what coin to pay the demands of these heathen.\"  So they rode on together in the twilight, till they came to the green  meadow, where a giant was waiting for them. Horn greeted him with a blow  that brought him to the ground at once, and ran another giant through  the heart with his sword; and when their followers saw that their  leaders were slain, they turned and fled back to the shore, but Horn  tried to cut them off from their ships, and in the scrimmage the King's  two sons fell. At this Horn was sore grieved, and he fell upon the  pagans in fury, and slew them right and left, to avenge the King and  himself.    Bitterly wept King Thurstan when his sons were brought home to him on  their biers; there was great mourning for the young princes, who were  buried with high honours in the vault under the church. Afterwards the  King called his knights together and said to Horn, \"Good Courage, but  for you we were all dead men. I will make you my heir; you shall wed my  daughter Swanhild, who is bright and beautiful as the sunshine, and  shall reign here after me.\"    So Horn lived there for six years, always under the name of Good  Courage, but he sent no messenger to Riminild, not wishing any man to  know his secret, and consequently Riminild was in great sorrow on his  account, not knowing whether he was true to her or not. Moreover, the  King of a neighbouring country sought her hand in marriage, and her  father now fixed a day for the wedding.    One morning, as Horn was riding to the forest, he saw a stranger  standing in the wayside, who, on being questioned said, \"I come from  Westland, and I seek the Knight Sir Horn. Riminild the maiden is in sore  heaviness of spirit, bewailing herself day and night, for on Sunday next  she is to be married to a King.\"    Then was Horn's grief as great as that of Riminild. His eyes overflowed  with tears. He looked at his ring with its colored stones; the one had  not turned red, but it seemed to him that the other was turning pale.  \"Well knew my heart that you would keep your troth with me, Riminild,\"  said he to himself, \"and that never would that stone grow red; but this  paling one bodes ill. And you doubtless have often looked in the garden  pool for my shadow, and have seen naught there but your own lovely  image. _That_ shadow shall never come, O sweet love, Riminild, to  prove to you that your love is false, but he himself shall come and  drive all shadows away.    \"And you, my trusty messenger,\" he said aloud, \"go back to maid Riminild  and tell her that she shall indeed wed a King next Sunday, for before  the church bells ring for service I will be with her.\"    The Princess Riminild stood on the beach and looked out to sea, hoping  to see Horn coming in his helmet and shield to deliver her; but none  came, save her own messenger, who was washed up on the shore--drowned!  And she wrung her hands in her anguish.    Horn had gone immediately to King Thurstan, and, after saluting him,  told him his real name and his present trouble. \"And now, O King,\" said  he, \"I pray you to reward me for all my services by helping me to get  possession of Riminild. Your daughter, Swanhild, will I give to a man  the best and faithfullest ever called to the ranks of knighthood.\"    Then said the King, \"Horn, follow your own counsel\"; then he sent for  his knights, and many of them followed Horn, so that he had a thousand  or more at his command. The wind favoured their course, and in a few  hours the ships cast anchor on the shore of Westland. Horn left his  forces in a wood while he went on to learn what was doing. Well did he  know the way, and lightly did he leap over the stones. As he went he met  a pilgrim, and asked him the latest news, who answered, \"I come from a  wedding feast--but the bride's true love is far away, and she only  weeps. I could not stay to see her grief.\"    \"May God help me!\" said Horn: \"but this is sorrowful news. Let us change  garments, good pilgrim. I must go to the feast, and once there I vow. I  will give them something by which to remember Horn!\" He blackened his  eyebrows, and took the pilgrim's hat and staff, and when he reached the  gate of the palace, the porter was for turning him back, but Horn took  him up and flung him over the bridge, and then went on to the hall where  the feast was being held. He sat down among the lowest, on the beggar's  bench, and glowered round from under his blackened eyebrows. At a  distance he saw Riminild sitting like one in a dream; then she rose to  pour out mead and wine for the knights and squires, and Horn cried out,  \"Fair Queen, if ye would have God's blessing, let the beggar's turn come  next.\"    She set down the flagon of wine, and poured him out brown beer in a jug,  saying: \"There, drink that off at a draught, thou boldest of beggar  men!\" But he gave it to the beggars, his companions, saying \"I am not  come to drink jugs of beer, but goblets of wine. Fair Queen,\" he cried,  \"thou deemest me a beggar, but I am rather a fisherman, come to haul in  my net, which I left seven years ago hanging from a fair hand here in  Westland.\" Then was Riminild much troubled within herself, and she  looked hard at Horn. She reached him the goblet and said, \"Drink wine  then, fisherman, and tell me who thou art.\"    He drank from the goblet, and then dropped into it the gold ring, and  said, \"Look, O Queen, at what thou findest in the goblet, and ask no  more who I am.\" The Queen withdrew into her bower with her four maidens,  and when she saw the gold ring that she had given to Horn, she was sore  distressed, and cried out, \"Childe Horn must be dead, for this is his  ring.\"    She then sent one of her waiting-maids to command the stranger to her  presence, and Horn, all unrecognised, appeared before her. \"Tell me,  honest pilgrim, where thou gottest this ring?\" she asked him.    \"I took it,\" said he, \"from the finger of a man whom I found lying sick  unto death in a wood. Loudly he was bewailing himself and the lady of  his heart, one Riminild, who should at this time have wedded him.\" As he  spoke he drew his cap down over his eyes, which were full of tears.    Then Riminild cried, \"Break, heart, in my bosom! Horn is no more--he who  hath already caused thee so many tender pangs.\" She threw herself on her  couch and called for a knife, to kill the bridegroom and herself.    Her maidens shrieked with fear, but Horn flung his arms around her and  pressed her to his heart. Then he cast away hat and staff, and wiped the  brown stain from his face, and stood up before his love in his own fair  countenance, asking, \"Dear love, Riminild, know thou me not now? Away  with your grief and kiss me--I am Horn!--Horn, your true lover and born  slave.\"    She gazed into his eyes. At first she could not believe that it was he,  but at last she could doubt no longer; she fell upon his neck, and in  the sweet greetings that followed were two sick hearts made whole.    \"Horn, you miscreant! how could you play me such a trick?\"    \"Have patience, sweet love, maid Riminild, and I will tell you all. Now  let me go and finish my work, and when it is done I will come and rest  at your side.\"    So he left her, and went back to the forest, and Riminild sent for  Athulf, who met her with a doleful"]]]
