'Your imprudence is not to be  forgiven,' said she to him: 'can you think that the King of  Samandal, whose character is so well known, will have greater  consideration for you than the many other kings he has refused his  daughter to with such evident contempt? Would you have him send you  away with the same confusion?'    'Madam,' replied King Saleh, 'I have already told you it was  contrary to my intention that the king, my nephew, should hear what  I related of the Princess Giauhara to the queen my sister. The  fault is committed; I will therefore do all that I can to remedy  it. I hope, madam, you will approve of my resolution to go myself  and wait upon the King of Samandal, with a rich present of precious  stones, and demand of him the princess, his daughter, for the King  of Persia, your grandson. I have some reason to believe he will not  refuse me, but will be pleased at an alliance with one of the  greatest potentates of the earth.'    'It were to have been wished,' replied the queen, 'that we had not  been under a necessity of making this demand, since the success of  our attempt is not so certain as we could desire; but since my  grandson's peace and content depend upon it, I freely give my  consent. But, above all, I charge you, since you well know the  temper of the King of Samandal, that you take care to speak to him  with due respect, and in a manner that cannot possibly offend him.'    The queen prepared the present herself, composed of diamonds,  rubies, emeralds, and strings of pearl; all of which she put into a  very neat and very rich box. Next morning, King Saleh took leave of  her majesty and the King of Persia, and departed with a chosen and  small troop of officers and other attendants. He soon arrived at the  kingdom and the palace of the King of Samandal, who rose from his  throne as soon as he perceived him; and King Saleh, forgetting his  character for some moments, though knowing whom he had to deal with,  prostrated himself at his feet, wishing him the accomplishment of  all his desires. The King of Samandal immediately stooped to raise  him up, and after he had placed him on his left hand, he told him he  was welcome, and asked him if there was anything he could do to  serve him.    'Sir,' answered King Saleh, 'though I should have no other motive  than that of paying my respects to the most potent, most prudent,  and most valiant prince in the world, feeble would be my  expressions how much I honour your majesty.' Having, spoken these  words, he took the box of jewels from one of his servants and  having opened it, presented it to the king, imploring him to accept  it for his sake.    'Prince,' replied the King of Samandal, 'you would not make me such  a present unless you had a request to propose. If there be anything  in my power, you may freely command it, and I shall feel the  greatest pleasure in granting it. Speak, and tell me frankly  wherein I can serve you.'    'I must own,' replied King Saleh, 'I have a boon to ask of your  majesty; and I shall take care to ask nothing but what is in your  power to grant. The thing depends so absolutely on yourself, that  it would be to no purpose to ask it of any other. I ask it then  with all possible earnestness, and I beg of you not to refuse it  me.'    'If it be so,' replied the King of Samandal, 'you have nothing to  do but acquaint me what it is, and you shall see after what manner  I can oblige when it is in my power.'    'Sir,' said King Saleh, 'after the confidence your majesty has been  pleased to encourage me to put in your goodwill, I will not  dissemble any longer. I came to beg of you to honour our house with  your alliance by the marriage of your honourable daughter the  Princess Giauhara, and to strengthen the good understanding that  has so long subsisted between our two crowns.'    At these words the King of Samandal burst out laughing falling back  in his throne against a cushion that supported him, and with an  imperious and scornful air, said to King Saleh: 'King Saleh, I have  always hitherto thought you a prince of great sense; but what you  say convinces me how much I was mistaken. Tell me, I beseech you,  where was your discretion, when you imagined to yourself so great  an absurdity as you have just now proposed to me? Could you  conceive a thought only of aspiring in marriage to a princess, the  daughter of so great and powerful a king as I am? You ought to have  considered better beforehand the great distance between us, and not  run the risk of losing in a moment the esteem I always had for your  person.'    King Saleh was extremely nettled at this affronting, answer, and  had much ado to restrain his resentment; however, he replied, with  all possible moderation, 'God reward your majesty as you deserve! I  have the honour to inform you, I do not demand the princess your  daughter in marriage for myself; had I done so your majesty and the  princess ought to have been so far from being offended, that you  should have thought it an honour done to both. Your majesty well  knows I am one of the kings of the sea as well as yourself; that  the kings, my ancestors, yield not in antiquity to any other royal  families; and that the kingdom I inherit from them is no less  potent and flourishing than it has ever been. If your majesty had  not interrupted me, you had soon understood that the favour I ask  of you was not for myself, but for the young King of Persia, my  nephew, whose power and grandeur, no less than his personal good  qualities, cannot be unknown to you. Everybody acknowledges the  Princess Giauhara to be the most beautiful person in the world: but  it is no less true that the young King of Persia, my nephew, is the  best and most accomplished prince on the land. Thus the favour that  is asked being likely to redound both to the honour of your majesty  and the princess your daughter, you ought not to doubt that your  consent to an alliance so equal will be unanimously approved in all  the kingdoms of the sea. The princess is worthy of the King of  Persia, and the King of Persia is no less worthy of her. No king or  prince in the world can dispute her with him.'    The King of Samandal would not have let King Saleh go on so long  after this rate, had not the rage he put him in deprived him of all  power of speech. It was some time before he could find his tongue,  so much was he transported with passion. At length, however, he  broke into outrageous language, unworthy of a great king. 'Dog!'  cried he, 'dare you talk to me after this manner, and so much as  mention my daughter's name in my presence? Can you think the son of  your sister Gulnare worthy to come in competition with my daughter?  Who are you? Who was your father? Who is your sister? And who your  nephew? Was not his father a dog, and a son of a dog, like you?  Guards, seize the insolent wretch, and cut off his head.'    The few officers that were about the King of Samandal were  immediately going to obey his orders, when King Saleh, who was  nimble and vigorous, got from them before they could draw their  sabres; and having reached the palace gate, he there found a  thousand men of his relations and friends, well armed and equipped,  who had just arrived. The queen his mother having considered the  small number of attendants he took with him, and, moreover,  foreseeing the bad reception he would probably have from the King  of Samandal, had sent these troops to protect and defend him in  case of danger, ordering them to make haste. Those of his relations  who were at the head of this troop had reason to rejoice at their  seasonable arrival, when they beheld him and his attendants come  running in great disorder and pursued. 'Sir,' cried his friends,  the moment he joined them, 'what is the matter? We are ready to  revenge you: you need only command us.'    King Saleh related his case to them in as few words as he could,  and putting himself at the head of a large troop, he, while some  seized on the gates, re-entered the palace as before. The few  officers and guards who had pursued him being soon dispersed, he  re-entered the King of Samandal's apartment, who, being abandoned  by his attendants, was soon seized. King Saleh left sufficient  guards to secure his person, and then went from apartment to  apartment, in search of the Princess Giauhara. But that princess,  on the first alarm, had, together with her women, sprung up to the  surface of the sea, and escaped to a desert island.    While this was passing in the palace of the King of Samandal, those  of King Saleh's attendants who had fled at the first menaces of  that king put the queen mother into terrible consternation upon  relating the danger her son was in. King Beder, who was by at that  time, was the more concerned, in that he looked upon himself as the  principal author of all the mischief: therefore, not caring to  abide in the queen's presence any longer, he darted up from the  bottom of the sea; and, not knowing how to find his way to the  kingdom of Persia, he happened to light on the island where the  Princess Giauhara had taken refuge.    The prince, not a little disturbed in mind, went and seated himself  under the shade of a large tree. Whilst he was endeavouring to  recover himself, he heard somebody talking, but was too far off to  understand what was said. He arose and advanced softly towards the  place whence the sound came, where, among the branches, he  perceived a most beautiful lady. 'Doubtless,' said he, within  himself, stopping and considering her with great attention, 'this  must be the Princess Giauhara, whom fear has obliged to abandon her  father's palace.' This said, he came forward, and approached the  princess with profound reverence. 'Madam,' said he, 'a greater  happiness could not have befallen me than this opportunity to offer  you my most humble services.

Those who think the physical circumstances of Woman would make a part  in the affairs of national government unsuitable, are by no means  those who think it impossible for negresses to endure field-work, even  during pregnancy, or for sempstresses to go through their killing  labors.    As to the use of the pen, there was quite as much opposition to  Woman's possessing herself of that help to free agency as there is now  to her seizing on the rostrum or the desk; and she is likely to draw,  from a permission to plead her cause that way, opposite inferences to  what might be wished by those who now grant it.    As to the possibility of her filling with grace and dignity any such  position, we should think those who had seen the great actresses, and  heard the Quaker preachers of modern times, would not doubt that Woman  can express publicly the fulness of thought and creation, without  losing any of the peculiar beauty of her sex. What can pollute and  tarnish is to act thus from any motive except that something needs to  be said or done. Woman could take part in the processions, the songs,  the dances of old religion; no one fancied her delicacy was impaired  by appearing in public for such a cause.    As to her home, she is not likely to leave it more than she now does  for balls, theatres, meetings for promoting missions, revival  meetings, and others to which she flies, in hope of an animation for  her existence commensurate with what she sees enjoyed by men.  Governors of ladies'-fairs are no less engrossed by such a charge,  than the governor of a state by his; presidents of Washingtonian  societies no less away from home than presidents of conventions. If  men look straitly to it, they will find that, unless their lives are  domestic, those of the women will not be. A house is no home unless it  contain food and fire for the mind as well as for the body. The female  Greek, of our day, is as much in the street as the male to cry, \"What  news?\" We doubt not it was the same in Athens of old. The women, shut  out from the market-place, made up for it at the religious festivals.  For human beings are not so constituted that they can live without  expansion. If they do not get it in one way, they must in another, or  perish.    As to men's representing women fairly at present, while we hear from  men who owe to their wives not only all that is comfortable or  graceful, but all that is wise, in the arrangement of their lives, the  frequent remark, \"You cannot reason with a woman,\"--when from those of  delicacy, nobleness, and poetic culture, falls the contemptuous phrase  \"women and children,\" and that in no light sally of the hour, but in  works intended to give a permanent statement of the best  experiences,--when not one man, in the million, shall I say? no, not  in the hundred million, can rise above the belief that Woman was made  _for Man_,--when such traits as these are daily forced upon the  attention, can we feel that Man will always do justice to the  interests of Woman? Can we think that he takes a sufficiently  discerning and religious view of her office and destiny _ever_ to  do her justice, except when prompted by sentiment,--accidentally or  transiently, that is, for the sentiment will vary according to the  relations in which he is placed? The lover, the poet, the artist, are  likely to view her nobly. The father and the philosopher have some  chance of liberality; the man of the world, the legislator for  expediency, none.    Under these circumstances, without attaching importance, in  themselves, to the changes demanded by the champions of Woman, we hail  them as signs of the times. We would have every arbitrary barrier  thrown down. We would have every path laid open to Woman as freely as  to Man. Were this done, and a slight temporary fermentation allowed to  subside, we should see crystallizations more pure and of more various  beauty. We believe the divine energy would pervade nature to a degree  unknown in the history of former ages, and that no discordant  collision, but a ravishing harmony of the spheres, would ensue.    Yet, then and only then will mankind be ripe for this, when inward and  outward freedom for Woman as much as for Man shall be acknowledged as  a _right_, not yielded as a concession. As the friend of the  negro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage, so  should the friend of Woman assume that Man cannot by right lay even  well-meant restrictions on Woman. If the negro be a soul, if the woman  be a soul, apparelled in flesh, to one Master only are they  accountable. There is but one law for souls, and, if there is to be an  interpreter of it, he must come not as man, or son of man, but as son  of God.    Were thought and feeling once so far elevated that Man should esteem  himself the brother and friend, but nowise the lord and tutor, of  Woman,--were he really bound with her in equal worship,--arrangements  as to function and employment would be of no consequence. What Woman  needs is not as a woman to act or rule, but as a nature to grow, as an  intellect to discern, as a soul to live freely and unimpeded, to  unfold such powers as were given her when we left our common home. If  fewer talents were given her, yet if allowed the free and full  employment of these, so that she may render back to the giver his own  with usury, she will not complain; nay, I dare to say she will bless  and rejoice in her earthly birth-place, her earthly lot. Let us  consider what obstructions impede this good era, and what signs give  reason to hope that it draws near.    I was talking on this subject with Miranda, a woman, who, if any in  the world could, might speak without heat and bitterness of the  position of her sex. Her father was a man who cherished no sentimental  reverence for Woman, but a firm belief in the equality of the sexes.  She was his eldest child, and came to him at an age when he needed a  companion. From the time she could speak and go alone, he addressed  her not as a plaything, but as a living mind. Among the few verses he  ever wrote was a copy addressed to this child, when the first locks  were cut from her head; and the reverence expressed on this occasion  for that cherished head, he never belied. It was to him the temple of  immortal intellect. He respected his child, however, too much to be an  indulgent parent. He called on her for clear judgment, for courage,  for honor and fidelity; in short, for such virtues as he knew. In so  far as he possessed the keys to the wonders of this universe, he  allowed free use of them to her, and, by the incentive of a high  expectation, he forbade, so far as possible, that she should let the  privilege lie idle.    Thus this child was early led to feel herself a child of the spirit.  She took her place easily, not only in the world of organized being,  but in the world of mind. A dignified sense of self-dependence was  given as all her portion, and she found it a sure anchor. Herself  securely anchored, her relations with others were established with  equal security. She was fortunate in a total absence of those charms  which might have drawn to her bewildering flatteries, and in a strong  electric nature, which repelled those who did not belong to her, and  attracted those who did. With men and women her relations were  noble,--affectionate without passion, intellectual without coldness.  The world was free to her, and she lived freely in it. Outward  adversity came, and inward conflict; but that faith and self-respect  had early been awakened which must always lead, at last, to an outward  serenity and an inward peace.    Of Miranda I had always thought as an example, that the restraints  upon the sex were insuperable only to those who think them so, or who  noisily strive to break them. She had taken a course of her own, and  no man stood in her way. Many of her acts had been unusual, but  excited no uproar. Few helped, but none checked her; and the many men  who knew her mind and her life, showed to her confidence as to a  brother, gentleness as to a sister. And not only refined, but very  coarse men approved and aided one in whom they saw resolution and  clearness of design. Her mind was often the leading one, always  effective.    When I talked with her upon these matters, and had said very much what  I have written, she smilingly replied; \"And yet we must admit that I  have been fortunate, and this should not be. My good father's early  trust gave the first bias, and the rest followed, of course. It is  true that I have had less outward aid, in after years, than most  women; but that is of little consequence. Religion was early awakened  in my soul,--a sense that what the soul is capable to ask it must  attain, and that, though I might be aided and instructed by others, I  must depend on myself as the only constant friend. This  self-dependence, which was honored in me, is deprecated as a fault in  most women. They are taught to learn their rule from without, not to  unfold it from within.    \"This is the fault of Man, who is still vain, and wishes to be more  important to Woman than, by right, he should be.\"    \"Men have not shown this disposition toward you,\" I said.    \"No; because the position I early was enabled to take was one of  self-reliance. And were all women as sure of their wants as I was, the  result would be the same. But they are so overloaded with precepts by  guardians, who think that nothing is so much to be dreaded for a woman  as originality of thought or character, that their minds are impeded  by doubts till they lose their chance of fair, free proportions. The  difficulty is to got them to the point from which they shall naturally  develop self-respect, and learn self-help.    \"Once I thought that men would help to"]]]
