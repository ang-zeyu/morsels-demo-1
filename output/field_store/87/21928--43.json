It is not unreasonable to suppose that both the Persians  and Jews worshipped substantially the one God who made the heaven and  the earth, notwithstanding the dualism which entered into the Persian  religion, and the symbolic worship of fire which is the most powerful  agent in Nature; and it is considered by many that from the Persians the  Jews received, during their Captivity, their ideas concerning a personal  Devil, or Power of Evil, of which no hint appears in the Law or the  earlier Prophets. It would certainly seem to be due to that monotheism  which modern scholars see behind the dualism of Persia, as an elemental  principle of the old religion of Iran, that the Persians were the  noblest people of Pagan antiquity, and practised the highest morality  known in the ancient world. Virtue and heroism went hand in hand; and  both virtue and heroism were the result of their religion. But when the  Persians became intoxicated with the wealth and power they acquired on  the fall of Babylon, then their degeneracy was rapid, and their faith  became obscured. Had it been the will of Providence that the Greeks  should have contended with the Persians under the leadership of  Cyrus,--the greatest Oriental conqueror known in history,--rather than  under Xerxes, then even an Alexander might have been baffled. The great  mistake of the Persian monarchs in their degeneracy was in trusting to  the magnitude of their armies rather than in their ancient discipline  and national heroism. The consequence was a panic, which would not have  taken place under Cyrus, whenever they met the Greeks in battle. It was  a panic which dispersed the Persian hosts in the fatal battle of Arbela,  and made Alexander the master of western Asia. But degenerate as the  Persians became, they rallied under succeeding dynasties, and in  Artaxerxes II. and Chosroes the Romans found, in their declining  glories, their most formidable enemies.    Though the brightness of the old religion of Zoroaster ceased to shine  after the Persian conquests, and religious rites fell into the hands of  the Magi, yet it is the only Oriental religion which entered into  Christianity after its magnificent triumph, unless we trace early  monasticism to the priests of India. Christianity had a hard battle with  Gnosticism and Manichaeism,--both of Persian origin,--and did not come  out unscathed. No Grecian system of philosophy, except Platonism,  entered into the Christian system so influentially as the disastrous  Manichaean heresy, which Augustine combated. The splendid mythology of  the Greeks, as well as the degrading polytheism of Egypt, Assyria, and  Phoenicia, passed away before the power of the cross; but Persian  speculations remained. Even Origen, the greatest scholar of Christian  antiquity, was tainted with them. And the mighty myths of the origin of  evil, which perplexed Zoroaster, still remain unsolved; but the belief  of the final triumph of good over evil is common to both Christians and  the disciples of the Bactrian sage.           *       *       *       *       *    AUTHORITIES.

RELIGIONS OF INDIA.      BRAHMANISM AND BUDDHISM.    That form of ancient religion which has of late excited the most  interest is Buddhism. An inquiry into its characteristics is especially  interesting, since so large a part of the human race--nearly five  hundred millions out of the thirteen hundred millions--still profess to  embrace the doctrines which were taught by Buddha, although his religion  has become so corrupted that his original teachings are nearly lost  sight of. The same may be said of the doctrines of Confucius. The  religions of ancient Egypt, Assyria, and Greece have utterly passed  away, and what we have had to say of these is chiefly a matter of  historic interest, as revealing the forms assumed by the human search  for a supernatural Ruler when moulded by human ambitions, powers, and  indulgence in the \"lust of the eye and the pride of life,\" rather than  by aspirations toward the pure and the spiritual.    Buddha was the great reformer of the religious system of the Hindus,  although he lived nearly fifteen hundred or two thousand years after the  earliest Brahmanical ascendency. But before we can appreciate his work  and mission, we must examine the system he attempted to reform, even as  it is impossible to present the Protestant Reformation without first  considering mediaeval Catholicism before the time of Luther. It was the  object of Buddha to break the yoke of the Brahmans, and to release his  countrymen from the austerities, the sacrifices, and the rigid  sacerdotalism which these ancient priests imposed, without essentially  subverting ancient religious ideas. He was a moralist and reformer,  rather than the founder of a religion.    Brahmanism is one of the oldest religions of the world. It was  flourishing in India at a period before history was written. It was  coeval with the religion of Egypt in the time of Abraham, and perhaps at  a still earlier date. But of its earliest form and extent we know  nothing, except from the sacred poems of the Hindus called the Vedas,  written in Sanskrit probably fifteen hundred years before Christ,--for  even the date of the earliest of the Vedas is unknown. Fifty years ago  we could not have understood the ancient religions of India. But Sir  William Jones in the latter part of the last century, a man of immense  erudition and genius for the acquisition of languages, at that time an  English judge in India, prepared the way for the study of Sanskrit, the  literary language of ancient India, by the translation and publication  of the laws of Menu. He was followed in his labors by the Schlegels of  Germany, and by numerous scholars and missionaries. Within fifty years  this ancient and beautiful language has been so perseveringly studied  that we know something of the people by whom it was once spoken,--even  as Egyptologists have revealed something of ancient Egypt by  interpreting the hieroglyphics; and Chaldaean investigators have found  stores of knowledge in the Babylonian bricks.    The Sanskrit, as now interpreted, reveals to us the meaning of those  poems called Vedas, by which we are enabled to understand the early laws  and religion of the Hindus. It is poetry, not history, which makes this  revelation, for the Hindus have no history farther back than five or six  hundred years before Christ. It is from Homer and Hesiod that we get an  idea of the gods of Greece, not from Herodotus or Xenophon.    From comparative philology, a new science, of which Prof. Max Mueller is  one of the greatest expounders, we learn that the roots of various  European languages, as well as of the Latin and Greek, are  substantially the same as those of the Sanskrit spoken by the Hindus  thirty-five hundred years ago, from which it is inferred that the Hindus  were a people of like remote origin with the Greeks, the Italic races  (Romans, Italians, French), the Slavic races (Russian, Polish,  Bohemian), the Teutonic races of England and the Continent, and the  Keltic races. These are hence alike called the Indo-European races; and  as the same linguistic roots are found in their languages and in the  Zend-Avesta, we infer that the ancient Persians, or inhabitants of Iran,  belonged to the same great Aryan race.    The original seat of this race, it is supposed, was in the high  table-lands of Central Asia, in or near Bactria, east of the Caspian  Sea, and north and west of the Himalaya Mountains. This country was so  cold and sterile and unpropitious that winter predominated, and it was  difficult to support life. But the people, inured to hardship and  privation, were bold, hardy, adventurous, and enterprising.    It is a most interesting process, as described by the philologists,  which has enabled them, by tracing the history of words through their  various modifications in different living languages, to see how the  lines of growth converge as they are followed back to the simple Aryan  roots. And there, getting at the meanings of the things or thoughts the  words originally expressed, we see revealed, in the reconstruction of a  language that no longer exists, the material objects and habits of  thought and life of a people who passed away before history began,--so  imperishable are the unconscious embodiments of mind, even in the airy  and unsubstantial forms of unwritten speech! By this process, then, we  learn that the Aryans were a nomadic people, and had made some advance  in civilization. They lived in houses which were roofed, which had  windows and doors. Their common cereal was barley, the grain of cold  climates. Their wealth was in cattle, and they had domesticated the cow,  the sheep, the goat, the horse, and the dog. They used "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10478"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 02: Jewish Heroes and Prophets (#7)"],[1,"over the land, second only to  the King in power and rank. And, further, he gives to him in marriage  the daughter of the High Priest of On, by which he becomes connected  with the priesthood.    Joseph deserves all the honor and influence he receives, for he saves  the kingdom from a great calamity. He predicts seven years of plenty and  seven years of famine, and points out the remedy. According to  tradition, the monarch whom he served was Apepi, the last Shepherd  King, during whose reign slaves were very numerous. The King himself had  a vast number, as well as the nobles. Foreign slaves were preferred to  native ones, and wars were carried on for the chief purpose of capturing  and selling captives.    The sacred narrative says but little of the government of Egypt by a  Hebrew slave, or of his abilities as a ruler,--virtually supreme in the  land, since Pharaoh delegates to him his own authority, persuaded both  of his fidelity and his abilities. It is difficult to understand how  Joseph arose at a single bound to such dignity and power, under a proud  and despotic king, and in the face of all the prejudices of the Egyptian  priesthood and nobility, except through the custom of all Oriental  despots to gratify the whim of the moment,--like the one who made his  horse prime minister. But nothing short of transcendent talents and  transcendent services can account for his retention of office and his  marked success. Joseph was then thirty years of age, having served  Potiphar ten years, and spent two or three years in prison.    This all took place, as some now suppose, shortly after 1700 B.C., under  the dynasty of the Hyksos or Shepherd Kings, who had conquered the  kingdom about three hundred years before. Their capital was Memphis,  near the pyramids, which had been erected several centuries earlier by  the older and native dynasties. Rawlinson supposes that Tanis on the  delta was the seat of their court. Conquered by the Hyksos, the old  kings retreated to their other capital, Thebes, and were probably made  tributary to the conquerors. It was by the earlier and later dynasties  that the magnificent temples and palaces were built, whose ruins have so  long been the wonder of travellers. The Shepherd Kings were warlike, and  led their armies from Scythia,--that land of roving and emigrant  warriors,--or, as Ewald thinks, from the land of Canaan: Aramaean  chieftains, who sought the spoil of the richest monarchy in the world.  Hence there was more affinity between these people and the Hebrews than  between them and the ancient Egyptians, who were the descendants of Ham.  Abraham, when he visited Egypt, found it ruled by these Scythian or  Aramaean warriors, which accounts for the kind and generous treatment he  received. It is not probable that a monarch of the ancient dynasties  would have been so courteous to Abraham, or would have elevated Joseph  to such an exalted rank, for they were jealous of strangers, and hated a  pastoral people. It was only under the rule of the Hyksos that the  Hebrews could have been tolerated and encouraged; for as soon as the  Shepherd Kings were expelled by the Pharaohs who reigned at Thebes, as  the Moors were expelled from Spain by the old Castilian princes, it  fared ill with the descendants of Jacob, and they were bitterly and  cruelly oppressed until the exodus under Moses. Prosperity probably led  the Hyksos conquerors to that fatal degeneracy which is unfavorable to  war, while adversity strengthened the souls of the descendants of the  ancient kings, and enabled them to subdue and drive away their invaders  and conquerors. And yet the Hyksos could not have ruled Egypt had they  not adapted themselves to the habits, religion, and prejudices of the  people they subdued. The Pharaoh who reigned at the time of Joseph  belonged like his predecessors to the sacerdotal caste, and worshipped  the gods of the Egyptians. But he was not jealous of the Hebrews, and  fully appreciated the genius of Joseph.    The wisdom of Joseph as ruler of the land destined to a seven years'  famine was marked by foresight as well as promptness in action. He  personally visited the various provinces, advising the people to husband  their harvests. But as all people are thoughtless and improvident, he  himself gathered up and stored all the grain which could be spared, and  in such vast quantities that he ceased to measure it. At last the  predicted famine came, as the Nile had not risen to its usual height;  but the royal granaries were full, since all the surplus wheat--about a  fifth of the annual produce--had been stored away; not purchased by  Joseph, but exacted as a tax. Nor was this exaction unreasonable in  view of the emergency. Under the Bourbon kings of France more than one  half of the produce of the land was taken by the Government and the  feudal proprietors without compensation, and that not in provision for  coming national trouble, but for the fattening of the royal purse.  Joseph exacted only a fifth as a sort of special tax, less than the  present Italian government exacts from all landowners.    Very soon the famine pressed upon the Egyptian people, for they had no  corn in reserve; the reserve was in the hands of the government. But  this reserve Joseph did not deal out gratuitously, as the Roman  government, under the emperors, dealt out food to the citizens. He made  the people pay for their bread, and took their money and deposited it in  the royal treasury. When after two years their money was all spent, it  was necessary to resort to barter, and cattle were given in exchange for  corn, by which means the King became possessed of all the personal  property of his subjects. As famine pressed, the people next surrendered  their land to avoid starvation,--all but the priests. Pharaoh thus  became absolute proprietor of the whole country; of money, cattle, and  land,--an unprecedented surrender, which would have produced a  wide-spread disaffection and revolt, had it not been that Joseph, after  the famine was past and the earth yielded its accustomed harvest,  exacted only one-fifth of the produce of the land for the support of  the government, which could not be regarded as oppressive. As the King  thus became absolute proprietor of Egypt by consent of the people, whom  he had saved from starvation through the wisdom and energy of his prime  minister, it is probable that later a new division of land took place,  it being distributed among the people generally in small farms, for  which they paid as rent a fifth of their produce. The gratitude of the  people was marked: \"Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the  eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves.\" Since the time of  Christ there have been two similar famines recorded,--one in the  eleventh century, lasting, like Joseph's, seven years; and the other in  the twelfth century, of which the most distressing details are given,  even to the extreme desperation of cannibalism. The same cause  originated both,--the failure of the Nile overflow. Out of the sacred  river came up for Egypt its fat kine and its lean,--its blessings and  its curses.    The price exacted by Joseph for the people's salvation made the King  more absolute than before, since all were thus made dependent on the  government.    This absolute rule of the kings, however, was somewhat modified by  ancient customs, and by the vast influence of the priesthood, to which  the King himself belonged. The priests of Egypt, under all the  dynasties, formed the most powerful caste ever seen among the nations  of the earth, if we except the Brahmanical caste of India. At the head  of it was the King himself, who was chief of the religion and of the  state. He regulated the sacrifices of the temples, and had the peculiar  right of offering them to the gods upon grand occasions. He  superintended the feasts and festivals in honor of the deities. The  priests enjoyed privileges which extended to their whole family. They  were exempt from taxes, and possessed one-third of the landed property,  which was entailed upon them, and of which they could not be deprived.  Among them there were great distinctions of rank, but the high-priests  held the most honorable station; they were devoted to the service of the  presiding deities of the cities in which they lived,--such as the  worship of Ammon at Thebes, of Phtha at Memphis, and of Ra at On, or  Heliopolis. One of the principal grades of the priesthood was that of  prophets, who were particularly versed in all matters pertaining to  religion. They presided over the temple and the sacred rites, and  directed the management of the priestly revenues; they bore a  distinguished part in solemn processions, carrying the holy vase.    The priests not only regulated all spiritual matters and superintended  the worship of the gods, but they were esteemed for their superior  knowledge. They acquired an ascendency over the people by their  supposed understanding of the sacred mysteries, only those priests being  initiated in the higher secrets of religion who had proved themselves  virtuous and discerning. \"The honor of ascending from the less to the  greater mysteries was as highly esteemed as it was difficult to obtain.  The aspirant was required to go through the most severe ordeal, and show  the greatest moral resignation.\" Those who aspired to know the  profoundest secrets, imposed upon themselves duties more severe than  those required by any other class. It was seldom that the priests were  objects of scandal; they were reserved and discreet, practising the  strictest purification of body and mind. Their life was so full of  minute details that they rarely appeared in public. They thus obtained  the sincere respect of the people, and ruled by the power of learning  and sanctity as well as by privilege. They are most censured for  concealing and withholding knowledge from the people.    How deep and"]]]
