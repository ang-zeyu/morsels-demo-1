A twelvemonth had been spent by the young man in weighing the  comparative advantages of the different classes of troops, when the  death of his father occurred. The ease of his situation, and the  attentions lavished upon a youth in the actual enjoyment of one of the  largest estates in the colonies, interfered greatly with his ambitious  projects. Love decided the matter; and Mr. Wharton, in becoming a  husband, ceased to think of becoming a soldier. For many years he  continued happy in his family, and sufficiently respected by his  countrymen, as a man of integrity and consequence, when all his  enjoyments vanished, as it were, at a blow. His only son, the youth  introduced in the preceding chapter, had entered the army, and had  arrived in his native country, but a short time before the commencement  of hostilities, with the reinforcements the ministry had thought it  prudent to throw into the disaffected parts of North America. His  daughters were just growing into life, and their education required all  the advantages the city could afford. His wife had been for some years  in declining health, and had barely time to fold her son to her bosom,  and rejoice in the reunion of her family, before the Revolution burst  forth, in a continued blaze, from Georgia to Massachusetts. The shock  was too much for the feeble condition of the mother, who saw her child  called to the field to combat against the members of her own family in  the South, and she sank under the blow.    There was no part of the continent where the manners of England and its  aristocratical notions of blood and alliances, prevailed with more force  than in a certain circle immediately around the metropolis of New York.  The customs of the early Dutch inhabitants had, indeed, blended in some  measures, with the English manners; but still the latter prevailed. This  attachment to Great Britain was increased by the frequent  intermarriages of the officers of the mother country with the wealthier  and most powerful families of the vicinity, until, at the commencement  of hostilities, their united influence had very nearly thrown the colony  into the scale on the side of the crown. A few, however, of the leading  families espoused the cause of the people; and a sufficient stand was  made against the efforts of the ministerial party, to organize, and,  aided by the army of the confederation, to maintain an independent  republican form of government.    The city of New York and the adjacent territory were alone exempted from  the rule of the new commonwealth; while the royal authority extended no  further than its dignity could be supported by the presence of an army.  In this condition of things, the loyalists of influence adopted such  measures as best accorded with their different characters and  situations. Many bore arms in support of the crown, and, by their  bravery and exertions, endeavored to secure what they deemed to be the  rights of their prince, and their own estates from the effects of the  law of attainder. Others left the country; seeking in that place they  emphatically called home, an asylum, as they fondly hoped, for a season  only, against the confusion and dangers of war. A third, and a more wary  portion, remained in the place of their nativity, with a prudent regard  to their ample possessions, and, perhaps, influenced by their  attachments to the scenes of their youth. Mr. Wharton was of this  description. After making a provision against future contingencies, by  secretly transmitting the whole of his money to the British funds, this  gentleman determined to continue in the theater of strife, and to  maintain so strict a neutrality as to insure the safety of his large  estate, whichever party succeeded. He was apparently engrossed in the  education of his daughters, when a relation, high in office in the new  state, intimated that a residence in what was now a British camp  differed but little, in the eyes of his countrymen, from a residence in  the British capital. Mr. Wharton soon saw this was an unpardonable  offense in the existing state of things, and he instantly determined to  remove the difficulty, by retiring to the country. He possessed a  residence in the county of Westchester; and having been for many years  in the habit of withdrawing thither during the heats of the summer  months, it was kept furnished and ready for his accommodation. His  eldest daughter was already admitted into the society of women; but  Frances, the younger, required a year or two more of the usual  cultivation, to appear with proper _eclat_; at least so thought Miss  Jeanette Peyton; and as this lady, a younger sister of their deceased  mother, had left her paternal home, in the colony of Virginia, with the  devotedness and affection peculiar to her sex, to superintend the  welfare of her orphan nieces, Mr. Wharton felt that her opinions were  entitled to respect. In conformity to her advice, therefore, the  feelings of the parent were made to yield to the welfare of  his children.    Mr. Wharton withdrew to the Locusts, with a heart rent with the pain of  separating from all that was left him of a wife he had adored, but in  obedience to a constitutional prudence that pleaded loudly in behalf of  his worldly goods. His handsome town residence was inhabited, in the  meanwhile, by his daughters and their aunt. The regiment to which  Captain Wharton belonged formed part of the permanent garrison of the  city; and the knowledge of the presence of his son was no little relief  to the father, in his unceasing meditations on his absent daughters. But  Captain Wharton was a young man and a soldier; his estimate of character  was not always the wisest; and his propensities led him to imagine that  a red coat never concealed a dishonorable heart.    The house of Mr. Wharton became a fashionable lounge to the officers of  the royal army, as did that of every other family that was thought  worthy of their notice. The consequences of this association were, to  some few of the visited, fortunate; to more, injurious, by exciting  expectations which were never to be realized, and, unhappily, to no  small number ruinous. The known wealth of the father and, possibly, the  presence of a high-spirited brother, forbade any apprehension of the  latter danger to the young ladies: but it was impossible that all the  admiration bestowed on the fine figure and lovely face of Sarah Wharton  should be thrown away. Her person was formed with the early maturity of  the climate, and a strict cultivation of the graces had made her  decidedly the belle of the city. No one promised to dispute with her  this female sovereignty, unless it might be her younger sister. Frances,  however, wanted some months to the charmed age of sixteen; and the idea  of competition was far from the minds of either of the affectionate  girls. Indeed, next to the conversation of Colonel Wellmere, the  greatest pleasure of Sarah was in contemplating the budding beauties of  the little Hebe, who played around her with all the innocency of youth,  with all the enthusiasm of her ardent temper, and with no little of the  archness of her native humor. Whether or not it was owing to the fact  that Frances received none of the compliments which fell to the lot of  her elder sister, in the often repeated discussions on the merits of the  war, between the military beaux who frequented the house, it is certain  their effects on the sisters were exactly opposite. It was much the  fashion then for the British officers to speak slightingly of their  enemies; and Sarah took all the idle vaporing of her danglers to be  truths. The first political opinions which reached the ears of Frances  were coupled with sneers on the conduct of her countrymen. At first she  believed them; but there was occasionally a general, who was obliged to  do justice to his enemy in order to obtain justice for himself; and  Frances became somewhat skeptical on the subject of the inefficiency of  her countrymen. Colonel Wellmere was among those who delighted most in  expending his wit on the unfortunate Americans; and, in time, Frances  began to listen to his eloquence with great suspicion, and sometimes  with resentment.    It was on a hot, sultry day that the three were in the parlor of Mr.  Wharton's house, the colonel and Sarah seated on a sofa, engaged in a  combat of the eyes, aided by the usual flow of small talk, and Frances  was occupied at her tambouring frame in an opposite corner of the room,  when the gentleman suddenly exclaimed,--    \"How gay the arrival of the army under General Burgoyne will make the  city, Miss Wharton!\"    \"Oh! how pleasant it must be,\" said the thoughtless Sarah, in reply; \"I  am told there are many charming women with that army; as you say, it  will make us all life and gayety.\"    Frances shook back the abundance of her golden hair, and raised her  eyes, dancing with the ardor of national feeling; then laughing, with a  concealed humor, she asked,--    \"Is it so certain that General Burgoyne will be permitted to reach the  city?\"    \"Permitted!\" echoed the colonel. \"Who is there to prevent it, my pretty  Miss Fanny?\"    Frances was precisely at that age when young people are most jealous of  their station in society; neither quite a woman, nor yet a child. The  \"pretty Miss Fanny\" was too familiar to be relished, and she dropped her  eyes on her work again with cheeks that glowed like crimson.    \"General Stark took the Germans into custody,\" she answered, compressing  her lip; \"may not General Gates think the British too dangerous to go  at large?\"    \"Oh! they were Germans, as you say,\" cried the colonel, excessively  vexed at the necessity of explaining at all; \"mere mercenary troops; but  when the really British regiments come in question, you will see a very  different result.\"    \"Of that there is no doubt,\" cried Sarah, without in the least partaking  of the resentment of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9882"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

PASCHE.           *       *       *       *       *        THE SKETCH BOOK    NO. XLI.           *       *       *       *       *      THE AUTHOR AND HIS COAT.    (_For the Mirror._)      My master, at first sight of me, expressed great admiration. He had  given his architect of garments orders to make him a blue coat in his  best style; in consequence of which I was ushered into the world. The  gentleman who introduced me into company was at the time in very high  spirits, being engaged in a new literary undertaking, of the success of  which he indulged very sanguine hopes. On this occasion we, that is, to  use similar language to Cardinal Wolsey, in a well-known instance, I and  my master paid a great number of visits to his particular friends, and  others whom he thought likely to encourage and promote his project The  reception _we_ generally met with was highly satisfactory; smiles and  promises of support were bestowed in abundance upon _us_. I use the  plural number, with justice, as it will appear in the sequel, although  my master scarcely ever dreamt that I had anything to do with it. As I  had, however, the special privilege of being _behind his back_, I had  the advantage which that situation peculiarly confers, of arriving at a  knowledge of the truth. He never dreamt that the expressions, \"How well  you are looking,\"--\"I am glad to see you,\" &c. so common in his ears,  would scarcely ever have been used had it not been for my influence. To  be sure I have overheard him say, as we have been walking along, \"There  goes an old acquaintance of mine; but, bless me, how altered he is! he  looks poor and meanly dressed, but I'm determined I'll speak to him, for  fear he should think me so shabby as to shy him.\" Thus giving an  instance in himself, certainly, of respect for the _man_ and not the  _coat_. My short history goes rather to prove that the reverse is almost  every day's experience. Matters went on pretty well with us until my  master was seized with a severe fit of illness, in consequence of which  his literary scheme was completely defeated, and his condition in life  materially injured; of course, the glad tones of encouragement which I  had been accustomed to hear were changed into expressions of condolence,  and sometimes assurances of unabated friendship; but then it must be  remembered that I, the handsomest blue coat, was _still in good  condition_, and it will perhaps appear, that if I were not my master's  _warmest_ friend, I was, at all events, the only one that _stuck to him  to the last_. Eternal respect to both of us continued much the same for  some time longer, but by degrees we both, _at the same time_, observed,  that an alteration began to take place. My master attributed this to his  altered fortunes, and I placed it to the score of my decayed  appearance--the threadbare cloth and tarnished button came in, I was  sure, for their full share of neglect, and he at last fell into the same  opinion. To describe all the variety of treatment that we experienced  would be a tedious and unpleasant task,--but I was the more convinced  that I had at least as much to do with it as my master, from observing  that all the gradations in manner, from coolness to shyness, and from  shyness to neglect, kept pace, remarkably, with the changes in my  appearance. My master was, at length, the only individual who paid any  respect or attention to me, after most of his old acquaintances had  ceased to notice him. I have heard him exclaim, \"Oh, that mankind would  treat me with as much constancy as my old true blue! Thou hast  faithfully served me throughout the vicissitudes of fortune, and art  faithful still, now both of us are left to wither in adversity.\"    I could make a long story of it, were I to detail all my adventures;  they may, however, be easily imagined from what has been stated, and  from which it is evident, that in too many instances, the world pays  more respect to _the coat_, than to _the man_, and therefore that a man  would often derive more consequence and benefit if he had the advantage  of having for his patron--_a tailor_ instead of _a man of rank_.

It was a cold stormy night in December, and the green logs as they  blazed and crackled on the Cotter's hearth, were rendered more  delightful, more truly comfortable, by the contrast with the icy showers  of snow and sleet which swept against the frail casement, making all  without cheerless and miserable.    The Cotter was a handsome, intelligent old man, and afforded me much  information upon glebes, and flocks, and rural economy; while his  spouse, a venerable matron, was humming to herself some long since  forgotten ballad; and industriously twisting and twirling about her long  knitting needles, that promised soon to produce a pair of formidable  winter hose. Their son, a stout, healthy young peasant of  three-and-twenty, was sitting in the spacious chimney corner, sharing  his frugal supper of bread and cheese with a large, shaggy sheep dog,  who sat on his haunches wistfully watching every mouthful, and snap,  snap, snapping, and dextrously catching every morsel that was cast  to him.    We were all suddenly startled, however, by his loud bark; when, jumping  up, he rushed, or rather flew towards the door.    \"Whew! whew!\" whistled the youth--\"Whoy--what the dickens ails thee,  Rover?\" said he, rising and following him to the door to learn the cause  of his alarm. \"What! be they gone again, ey?\" for the dog was silent.  \"What do thee sniffle at, boy? On'y look at 'un feyther; how the beast  whines and waggles his stump o' tail!--It's some 'un he knows for  sartain. I'd lay a wager it wur Bill Miles com'd about the  harrow, feyther.\"    \"Did thee hear any knock, lad?\" said the father.    \"Noa!\" replied the youth; \"but mayhap Bill peep'd thro' the hoal in the  shutter, and is a bit dash'd like at seeing a gentleman here. Bill! is't  thee, Master Miles?\" continued he, bawling. \"Lord! the wind whistles so  a' can't hear me. Shall I unlatch the door, feyther?\"    \"Ay, lad, do, an thou wilt,\" replied the old man; \"Rover's wiser nor we  be--a dog 'll scent a friend, when a man would'nt know un.\"    Rover still continued his low importunate whine, and began to scratch  against the door. The lad threw it open--the dog brushed past him in an  instant, and his quick, short, continuous yelping, expressed his  immoderate joy and recognition.    \"Hollo! where be'st thee, Bill?\" said the young peasant, stepping over  the threshold. \"Come, none of thee tricks upon travellers, Master Bill;  I zee thee beside the rick yon!\" and quitting the door for half a  minute, he again hastily entered the cot. The rich colour of robust  health had fled from his cheeks--his lips quivered--and he looked like  one bereft of his senses, or under the influence of some frightful  apparition.    The dame rose up--her work fell from trembling hands--    \"What's the matter?\" said she.    \"What's frighted thee, lad?\" asked the old man, rising.    \"Oh! feyther!--oh! mother!\"--exclaimed he, drawing them hastily on one  side and whispering something in a low, and almost inaudible voice.    The old woman raised her hands in supplication and tottered to her  chair while the Cotter, bursting out into a paroxysm of violent rage,  clutched his son's arm, and exclaimed in a loud voice:    \"Make fast the door, boy, an thou'lt not have my curse on thee!--I tell  'ee, she shan't come hither!--No--never--never;--there's poison in her  breath--a' will spurn her from me!--A pest on her!--What; wilt not do  my bidding?\"    \"O! feyther, feyther!\" cried the young peasant, whose heart seemed  overcharged with grief, \"It be a cold, raw night--ye wou'dna kick a cur  from the door to perish in the storm! Doant 'ee be hot and hasty,  feyther, thou art not uncharitable--On me knees!\"--    \"Psha!\" exclaimed the enraged father, only exasperated by his  remonstrances. \"Whoy talk 'ee to me, son--I am deaf--deaf!--Mine own  hand shall bar the door agen her!\"--adding with bitterness--\"let her  die!\"--and stepping past his prostrate son, was about to execute his  purpose--when, a young girl, whose once gay and flimsy raiment was  drenched and stained, and torn by the violence of the storm, appeared at  the door. The old man recoiled with a shudder--she was as pale as  death--and her trembling limbs seemed scarcely able to support her--a  profusion of light brown hair hung dishevelled and in disorder about her  neck and shoulders, and added to her forlorn appearance. She stretched  forth her arms and pronounced the name of \"Father!\" but further  utterance was prevented by the convulsive sobs that heaved her bosom.    \"Mary--woman!\" cried the old man, trembling--\"Call me not feyther--thou  art none of mine--thou hast no feyther now--nor I a daughter--thou art a  serpent that hath stung the bosom that cherished thee! Go to the fawning  villain--the black-hearted sycophant that dragged thee"]]]
