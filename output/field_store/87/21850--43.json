At last I was aware that somewhere near me a blade of grass was growing,  and the moss began to appear all over the dead houses. One day some  thistledown went drifting over the river.    For some years I watched these signs attentively, until I became certain  that London was passing away. Then I hoped once more, and all along both  banks of the river there was anger among the lost things that anything  should dare to hope upon the forsaken mud. Gradually the horrible houses  crumbled, until the poor dead things that never had had life got decent  burial among the weeds and moss. At last the may appeared and the  convolvulus. Finally, the wild rose stood up over mounds that had been  wharves and warehouses. Then I knew that the cause of Nature had  triumphed, and London had passed away.    The last man in London came to the wall by the river, in an ancient cloak  that was one of those that once my friends had worn, and peered over the  edge to see that I still was there. Then he went, and I never saw men  again: they had passed away with London.    A few days after the last man had gone the birds came into London, all the  birds that sing. When they first saws me they all looked sideways at me,  then they went away a little and spoke among themselves.    \"He only sinned against Man,\" they said; \"it is not our quarrel.\"    \"Let us be kind to him,\" they said.    Then they hopped nearer me and began to sing. It was the time of the  rising of the dawn, and from both banks of the river, and from the sky,  and from the thickets that were once the streets, hundreds of birds were  singing. As the light increased the birds sang more and more; they grew  thicker and thicker in the air above my head, till there were thousands of  them singing there, and then millions, and at last I could see nothing but  a host of flickering wings with the sunlight on them, and little gaps of  sky. Then when there was nothing to be heard in London but the myriad  notes of that exultant song, my soul rose up from the bones in the hole in  the mud and began to climb heavenwards. And it seemed that a lane-way  opened amongst the wings of the birds, and it went up and up, and one of  the smaller gates of Paradise stood ajar at the end of it. And then I knew  by a sign that the mud should receive me no more, for suddenly I found  that I could weep.    At this moment I opened my eyes in bed in a house in London, and outside  some sparrows were twittering in a tree in the light of the radiant  morning; and there were tears still wet upon my face, for one's restraint  is feeble while one sleeps. But I arose and opened the window wide, and  stretching my hands out over the little garden, I blessed the birds whose  song had woken me up from the troubled and terrible centuries of my dream.          BETHMOORA      There is a faint freshness in the London night as though some strayed  reveler of a breeze had left his comrades in the Kentish uplands and had  entered the town by stealth. The pavements are a little damp and shiny.  Upon one's ears that at this late hour have become very acute there hits  the tap of a remote footfall. Louder and louder grow the taps, filling the  whole night. And a black cloaked figure passes by, and goes tapping into  the dark. One who has danced goes homewards. Somewhere a ball has closed  its doors and ended. Its yellow lights are out, its musicians are silent,  its dancers have all gone into the night air, and Time has said of it,  \"Let it be past and over, and among the things that I have put away.\"    Shadows begin to detach themselves from their great gathering places. No  less silently than those shadows that are thin and dead move homewards the  stealthy cats. Thus have we even in London our faint forebodings of the  dawn's approach, which the birds and the beasts and the stars are crying  aloud to the untrammeled fields.    At what moment I know not I perceive that the night itself is irrevocably  overthrown. It is suddenly revealed to me by the weary pallor of the  street lamps that the streets are silent and nocturnal still, not because  there is any strength in night, but because men have not yet arisen from  sleep to defy him. So have I seen dejected and untidy guards still bearing  antique muskets in palatial gateways, although the realms of the monarch  that they guard have shrunk to a single province which no enemy yet has  troubled to overrun.    And it is now manifest from the aspect of the street lamps, those abashed  dependants of night, that already English mountain peaks have seen the  dawn, that the cliffs of Dover are standing white to the morning, that the  sea-mist has lifted and is pouring inland.    And now men with a hose have come and are sluicing out the streets.    Behold now night is dead.    What memories, what fancies throng one's mind! A night but just now  gathered out of London by the horrific hand of Time. A million common  artificial things all cloaked for a while in mystery, like beggars robed  in purple, and seated on dread thrones. Four million people asleep,  dreaming perhaps. What worlds have they gone into? Whom have they met? But  my thoughts are far off with Bethmoora in her loneliness, whose gates  swing to and fro. To and fro they swing, and creak and creak in the wind,  but no one hears them. They are of green copper, very lovely, but no one  sees them now. The desert wind pours sand into their hinges, no watchman  comes to ease them. No guard goes round Bethmoora's battlements, no enemy  assails them. There are no lights in her houses, no footfall on her  streets, she stands there dead and lonely beyond the Hills of Hap, and I  would see Bethmoora once again, but dare not.    It is many a year, they tell me, since Bethmoora became desolate.    Her desolation is spoken of in taverns where sailors meet, and certain  travellers have told me of it.    I had hoped to see Bethmoora once again. It is many a year ago, they say,  when the vintage was last gathered in from the vineyards that I knew,  where it is all desert now. It was a radiant day, and the people of the  city were dancing by the vineyards, while here and there one played upon  the kalipac. The purple flowering shrubs were all in bloom, and the snow  shone upon the Hills of Hap.    Outside the copper gates they crushed the grapes in vats to make the  syrabub. It had been a goodly vintage.    In the little gardens at the desert's edge men beat the tambang and the  tittibuk, and blew melodiously the zootibar.    All there was mirth and song and dance, because the vintage had been  gathered in, and there would be ample syrabub for the winter months, and  much left over to exchange for turquoises and emeralds with the merchants  who come down from Oxuhahn. Thus they rejoiced all day over their vintage  on the narrow strip of cultivated ground that lay between Bethmoora and  the desert which meets the sky to the South. And when the heat of the day  began to abate, and the sun drew near to the snows on the Hills of Hap,  the note of the zootibar still rose clear from the gardens, and the  brilliant dresses of the dancers still wound among the flowers. All that  day three men on mules had been noticed crossing the face of the Hills of  Hap. Backwards and forwards they moved as the track wound lower and lower,  three little specks of black against the snow. They were seen first in the  very early morning up near the shoulder of Peol Jagganoth, and seemed to  be coming out of Utnar Vehi. All day they came. And in the evening, just  before the lights come out and colours change, they appeared before  Bethmoora's copper gates. They carried staves, such as messengers bear in  those lands, and seemed sombrely clad when the dancers all came round them  with their green and lilac dresses. Those Europeans who were present and  heard the message given were ignorant of the language, and only caught the  name of Utnar Vehi. But it was brief, and passed rapidly from mouth to  mouth, and almost at once the people burnt their vineyards and began to  flee away from Bethmoora, going for the most part northwards, though some  went to the East. They ran down out of their fair white houses, and  streamed through the copper gate; the throbbing of the tambang and the  tittibuk suddenly ceased with the note of the Zootibar, and the clinking  kalipac stopped a moment after. The three strange travellers went back the  way they came the instant their message was given. It was the hour when a  light would have appeared in some high tower, and window after window  would have poured into the dusk its lion-frightening light, and the cooper  gates would have been fastened up. But no lights came out in windows there  that night and have not ever since, and those copper gates were left wide  and have never shut, and the sound arose of the red fire crackling in the  vineyards, and the pattering of feet fleeing softly. There were no cries,  no other sounds at all, only the rapid and determined flight. They fled as  swiftly and quietly as a herd of wild cattle flee when they suddenly see a  man. It was as though something had befallen which had been feared for  generations, which could only be escaped by instant flight, which left no  time for indecision.    Then fear took the Europeans also, and they too fled. And what the message  was I have never heard.    Many believe that it was a message from Thuba Mleen, the mysterious  emperor of those lands, who is never seen by man, advising that Bethmoora  should be left desolate. Others say that the message was one of warning  from the gods, whether from friendly gods or from adverse ones they know  not.    And others hold that the Plague was ravaging a line of cities over in  Utnar Vehi, following the South-west wind which for many weeks had been  blowing across them towards Bethmoora.    Some say that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/813"],[0,"Reminiscences of Tolstoy, (#6)"],[1,", an extraordinary restraint in the  expression of affection, which was often concealed under the mask of  indifference and sometimes even of unexpected harshness. In the matter  of wit and sarcasm, on the other hand, he was strikingly original.    At one period he spent several winters in succession with his family in  Moscow. One time, after a historic concert given by Anton Rubinstein, at  which Uncle Seryozha and his daughter had been, he came to take tea with  us in Weavers' Row.[13]    My father asked him how he had liked the concert.    \"Do you remember Himbut, Lyovotchka? Lieutenant Himbut, who was forester  near Yasnaya? I once asked him what was the happiest moment of his life.  Do you know what he answered?    \"'When I was in the cadet corps,' he said, 'they used to take down  my breeches now and again and lay me across a bench and flog me. They  flogged and they flogged; when they stopped, that was the happiest  moment of my life.' Well, it was only during the entr'actes, when  Rubinstein stopped playing, that I really enjoyed myself.\"    He did not always spare my father.    Once when I was out shooting with a setter near Pirogovo, I drove in to  Uncle Seryozha's to stop the night.    I do not remember apropos of what, but Uncle Seryozha averred that  Lyovotchka was proud. He said:    \"He is always preaching humility and non-resistance, but he is proud  himself.    \"Nashenka's [14] sister had a footman called Forna. When he got drunk,  he used to get under the staircase, tuck in his legs, and lie down. One  day they came and told him that the countess was calling him. 'She can  come and find me if she wants me,' he answered.    \"Lyovotchka is just the same. When Dolgoruky sent his chief secretary  Istomin to ask him to come and have a talk with him about Syntayef, the  sectarian, do you know what he answered?    \"'Let him come here, if he wants me.' Isn't that just the same as Forna?    \"No, Lyovotchka is very proud. Nothing would induce him to go, and he  was quite right; but it's no good talking of humility.\"    During the last years of Sergei Nikolayevitch's life my father was  particularly friendly and affectionate with him, and delighted in  sharing his thoughts with him.    A. A. Fet in his reminiscences describes the character of all the three  Tolstoy brothers with extraordinary perspicacity:    I am convinced that the fundamental type of all the three Tolstoy  brothers was identical, just as the type of all maple-leaves is  identical, despite the variety of their configurations. And if I set  myself to develop the idea, I could show to what a degree all three  brothers shared in that passionate enthusiasm without which it would  have been impossible for one of them to turn into the poet Lyoff  Tolstoy. The difference of their attitude to life was determined by  the difference of the ways in which they turned their backs on their  unfulfilled dreams. Nikolai quenched his ardor in skeptical derision,  Lyoff renounced his unrealized dreams with silent reproach, and Sergei  with morbid misanthropy. The greater the original store of love in such  characters, the stronger, if only for a time, is their resemblance to  Timon of Athens.    In the winter of 1901-02 my father was ill in the Crimea, and for a  long time lay between life and death. Uncle Seryozha, who felt himself  getting weaker, could not bring himself to leave Pirogovo, and in his  own home followed anxiously the course of my father's illness by the  letters which several members of our family wrote him, and by the  bulletins in the newspapers.    When my father began to improve, I went back home, and on the way from  the Crimea went to Pirogovo, in order to tell Uncle Seryozha personally  about the course of the illness and about the present condition of my  father's health. I remember how joyfully and gratefully he welcomed me.    \"How glad I am that you came! Now tell me all about it. Who is with him?  All of them? And who nurses him most? Do you go on duty in turn? And at  night, too? He can't get out of bed. Ah, that's the worst thing of all!    \"It will be my turn to die soon; a year sooner or later, what does it  matter? But to lie helpless, a burden to every one, to have others doing  everything for you, lifting you and helping you to sit up, that's what's  so awful.    \"And how does he endure it? Got used to it, you say? No; I cannot  imagine having Vera to change my linen and wash me. Of course she would  say that it's nothing to her, but for me it would be awful.    \"And tell me, is he afraid to die? Does he say not? Very likely; he's a  strong man, he may be able to conquer the fear of it. Yes, yes, perhaps  he's not afraid; but still--    \"You say he struggles with the feeling? Why, of course; what else can  one do?    \"I wanted to go and be with him; but I thought, how can I? I shall crack  up myself, and then there will be two invalids instead of one.    \"Yes, you have told me a great deal; every detail is interesting. It  is not death that's so terrible, it's illness, helplessness, and, above  all, the fear that you are a burden to others. That's awful, awful.\"    Uncle Seryozha died in 1904 of cancer in the face. This is what my aunt,  Maria Nikolayevna, [15] the nun, told me about his death. Almost to the  last day he was on his legs, and would not let any one nurse him. He was  in full possession of his faculties and consciously prepared for death.    Besides his own family, the aged Maria Mikhailovna and her daughters,  his sister, Maria Nikolayevna, who told me the story, was with him, too,  and from hour to hour they expected the arrival of my father, for whom  they had sent a messenger to Yasnaya. They were all troubled with the  difficult question whether the dying man would want to receive the holy  communion before he died.    Knowing Sergei Nikolayevitch's disbelief in the religion of the church,  no one dared to mention the subject to him, and the unhappy Maria  Mikhailovna hovered round his room, wringing her hands and praying.    They awaited my father's arrival impatiently, but were secretly afraid  of his influence on his brother, and hoped against hope that Sergei  Nikolayevitch would send for the priest before his arrival.    \"Imagine our surprise and delight,\" said Maria Tolstoy, \"when Lyovotchka  came out of his room and told Maria Mikhailovna that Seryozha wanted  a priest sent for. I do not know what they had been talking about, but  when Seryozha said that he wished to take the communion, Lyovotchka  answered that he was quite right, and at once came and told us what he  wanted.\"    My father stayed about a week at Pirogovo, and left two days before my  uncle died.    When he received a telegram to say he was worse, he drove over again,  but arrived too late; he was no longer living. He carried his body  out from the house with his own hands, and himself bore it to the  churchyard.    When he got back to Yasnaya he spoke with touching affection of his  parting with this \"inscrutable and beloved\" brother, who was so strange  and remote from him, but at the same time so near and so akin.          FET, STRAKHOF, GAY    \"WHAT'S this saber doing here?\" asked a young guardsman, Lieutenant  Afanasyi Afanasyevitch Fet, of the footman one day as he entered the  hall of Ivan Sergeyevitch Turgenieff's flat in St. Petersburg in the  middle of the fifties.    \"It is Count Tolstoy's saber; he is asleep in the drawing-room. And Ivan  Sergeyevitch is in his study having breakfast,\" replied Zalchar.    \"During the hour I spent with Turgenieff,\" says Fet, in his  reminiscences, \"we talked in low voices, for fear of waking the count,  who was asleep on the other side of the door.\"    \"He's like that all the time,\" said Turgenieff, smiling; \"ever since he  got back from his battery at Sebastopol, [16] and came to stay here, he  has been going the pace. Orgies, Gipsies, and gambling all night long,  and then sleeps like a dead man till two o'clock in the afternoon. I did  my best to stop him, but have given it up as a bad job.    \"It was in this visit to St. Petersburg that I and Tolstoy became  acquainted, but the acquaintance was of a purely formal character, as I  had not yet seen a line of his writings, and had never heard of his  name in literature, except that Turgenieff mentioned his 'Stories of  Childhood.'\"    Soon after this my father came to know Fet intimately, and they struck  up a firm and lasting friendship, and established a correspondence which  lasted almost till Fet's death.    It was only during the last years of Fet's life, when my father was  entirely absorbed in his new ideas, which were so at variance with  Afanasyi Afanasyevitch's whole philosophy of life, that they became  estranged and met more rarely.    It was at Fet's, at Stepanovka, that my father and Turgenieff quarreled.    Before the railway was made, when people still had to drive, Fet, on  his way into Moscow, always used to turn in at Yasnaya Polyana to see my  father, and these visits became an established custom. Afterward,  when the railway was made and my father was already married, Afanasyi  Afanasyevitch still never passed our house without coming in, and if he  did, my father used to write him a letter of earnest reproaches, and  he used to apologize as if he had been guilty of some fault. In those  distant times of which I am speaking my father was bound to Fet by a  common interest in agriculture as well as literature.    Some of my father's letters of the sixties are curious in this respect.    For instance, in 1860, he wrote a long dissertation on Turgenieff's  novel \"On the Eve,\" which had just come out, and at the end added  a postscript: \"What is the price of a set of the best quality of  veterinary instruments? And what is the price of a set of lancets and  bleeding-cups for human use?\"    In another letter there is a postscript:    \"When you are next in Oryol, buy me six-hundred weight of various ropes,  reins,"]]]
