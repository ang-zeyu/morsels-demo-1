I hate the  country.\"    A ball of fire seemed to burst in Kurt.    \"That kind of talk infuriates me,\" he blazed. \"I don't care if you are  my father. Why in the hell did you come to America? Why did you stay?  Why did you marry my mother--an American woman?... That's rot--just  spiteful rot! I've heard you tell what life was in Europe when you were  a boy. You ran off. You stayed in this country because it was a better  country than yours.... Fifty years you've been in America--many years on  this farm. And you love this land.... My God! father, can't you and men  like you see the truth?\"    \"Aye, I can,\" gloomily replied the old man. \"The truth is we'll lose the  land. That greedy Anderson will drive me off.\"    \"He will not. He's fine--generous,\" asserted Kurt, earnestly. \"All he  wanted was to see the prospects of the harvest and perhaps to help you.  Anderson has not had interest on his money for three years. I'll bet  he's paid interest demanded by the other stockholders in that bank you  borrowed from. Why, he's our friend!\"    \"Aye, and I see more,\" boomed the father. \"He fetched his lass up here  to make eyes at my son. I saw her--the sly wench!... Boy, you'll not  marry her!\"    Kurt choked back his mounting rage.    \"Certainly I never will,\" he said, bitterly. \"But I would if she'd have  me.\"    \"What!\" thundered Dorn, his white locks standing up and shaking like the  mane of a lion. \"That wheat banker's daughter! Never! I forbid it. You  shall not marry any American girl.\"    \"Father, this is idle, foolish rant,\" cried Kurt, with a high warning  note in his voice. \"I've no idea of marrying.... But if I had one--whom  else could I marry except an American girl?\"    \"I'll sell the wheat--the land. We'll go back to Germany!\"    That was maddening to Kurt. He sprang up, sending dishes to the floor  with a crash. He bent over to pound the table with a fist. Violent  speech choked him and he felt a cold, tight blanching of his face.    \"Listen!\" he rang out. \"If I go to Germany it'll be as a soldier--to  kill Germans!... I'm done--I'm through with the very name.... Listen to  the last words I'll ever speak to you in German--the last! _To hell with  Germany_!\"    Then Kurt plunged, blind in his passion, out of the door into the night.  And as he went he heard his father cry out, brokenly:    \"My son! Oh, my son!\"    The night was dark and cool. A faint wind blew across the hills, and it  was dry, redolent, sweet. The sky seemed an endless curving canopy of  dark blue blazing with myriads of stars.    Kurt staggered out of the yard, down along the edge of a wheat-field, to  one of the straw-stacks, and there he flung himself down in an agony.    \"Oh, I'm ruined--ruined!\" he moaned. \"The break--has come!... Poor old  dad!\"    He leaned there against the straw, shaking and throbbing, with a cold  perspiration bathing face and body. Even the palms of his hands were  wet. A terrible fit of anger was beginning to loose its hold upon him.  His breathing was labored in gasps and sobs. Unutterable stupidity of  his father--horrible cruelty of his position! What had he ever done in  all his life to suffer under such a curse? Yet almost he clung to his  wrath, for it had been righteous. That thing, that infernal twist in the  brain, that was what was wrong with his father. His father who had been  fifty years in the United States! How simple, then, to understand what  was wrong with Germany.    \"By God! I am--American!\" he panted, and it was as if he called to the  grave of his mother, over there on the dark, windy hill.    That tremendous uprising of his passion had been a vortex, an end, a  decision. And he realized that even to that hour there had been a drag  in his blood. It was over now. The hell was done with. His soul was  free. This weak, quaking body of his housed his tainted blood and the  emotions of his heart, but it could not control his mind, his will. Beat  by beat the helpless fury in him subsided, and then he fell back and lay  still for a long time, eyes shut, relaxed and still.    A hound bayed mournfully; the insects chirped low, incessantly; the  night wind rustled the silken heads of wheat.    After a while the young man sat up and looked at the heavens, at the  twinkling white stars, and then away across the shadows of round hills  in the dusk. How lonely, sad, intelligible, and yet mystic the night and  the scene!    What came to him then was revealing, uplifting--a source of strength to  go on. He was not to blame for what had happened; he could not change  the future. He had a choice between playing the part of a man or that of  a coward, and he had to choose the former. There seemed to be a spirit  beside him--the spirit of his mother or of some one who loved him and  who would have him be true to an ideal, and, if needful, die for it. No  night in all his life before had been like this one. The dreaming hills  with their precious rustling wheat meant more than even a spirit could  tell. Where had the wheat come from that had seeded these fields? Whence  the first and original seeds, and where were the sowers? Back in the  ages! The stars, the night, the dark blue of heaven hid the secret in  their impenetrableness. Beyond them surely was the answer, and perhaps  peace.    Material things--life, success--such as had inspired Kurt Dorn, on this  calm night lost their significance and were seen clearly. They could not  last. But the wheat there, the hills, the stars--they would go on with  their task. Passion was the dominant side of a man declaring itself, and  that was a matter of inheritance. But self-sacrifice, with its mercy,  its succor, its seed like the wheat, was as infinite as the stars. He  had long made up his mind, yet that had not given him absolute  restraint. The world was full of little men, but he refused to stay  little. This war that had come between him and his father had been bred  of the fumes of self-centered minds, turned with an infantile fatality  to greedy desires. His poor old blinded father could be excused and  forgiven. There were other old men, sick, crippled, idle, who must  suffer pain, but whose pain could be lightened. There were babies,  children, women, who must suffer for the sins of men, but that suffering  need no longer be, if men became honest and true.    His sudden up-flashing love had a few hours back seemed a calamity. But  out there beside the whispering wheat, under the passionless stars, in  the dreaming night, it had turned into a blessing. He asked nothing but  to serve. To serve her, his country, his future! All at once he who had  always yearned for something unattainable had greatness thrust upon him.  His tragical situation had evoked a spirit from the gods.    To kiss that blue-eyed girl's sweet lips would be a sum of joy, earthly,  all-satisfying, precious. The man in him trembled all over at the daring  thought. He might revel in such dreams, and surrender to them, since she  would never know, but the divinity he sensed there in the presence of  those stars did not dwell on a woman's lips. Kisses were for the  present, the all too fleeting present; and he had to concern himself  with what he might do for one girl's future. It was exquisitely sad and  sweet to put it that way, though Kurt knew that if he had never seen  Lenore Anderson he would have gone to war just the same. He was not  making an abstract sacrifice.    The wheat-fields rolling before him, every clod of which had been  pressed by his bare feet as a boy; the father whose changeless blood had  sickened at the son of his loins; the life of hope, freedom, of action,  of achievement, of wonderful possibility--these seemed lost to Kurt  Dorn, a necessary renunciation when he yielded to the call of war.    But no loss, no sting of bullet or bayonet, no torturing victory of  approaching death, could balance in the scale against the thought of a  picture of one American girl--blue-eyed, red-lipped, golden-haired--as  she stepped somewhere in the future, down a summer lane or through a  blossoming orchard, on soil that was free.          CHAPTER IV    Toward the end of July eastern Washington sweltered under the most  torrid spell of heat on record. It was a dry, high country, noted for an  equable climate, with cool summers and mild winters. And this  unprecedented wave would have been unbearable had not the atmosphere  been free from humidity.    The haze of heat seemed like a pall of thin smoke from distant forest  fires. The sun rose, a great, pale-red ball, hot at sunrise, and it  soared blazing-white at noon, to burn slowly westward through a  cloudless, coppery sky, at last to set sullen and crimson over the  ranges.    Spokane, being the only center of iron, steel, brick, and masonry in  this area, resembled a city of furnaces. Business was slack. The asphalt  of the streets left clean imprints of a pedestrian's feet; bits of  newspaper stuck fast to the hot tar. Down by the gorge, where the great  green river made its magnificent plunges over the falls, people  congregated, tarried, and were loath to leave, for here the blowing mist  and the air set into motion by the falling water created a temperature  that was relief.    Citizens talked of the protracted hot spell, of the blasted crops, of an  almost sure disaster to the wheat-fields, and of the activities of the  I.W.W. Even the war, for the time being, gave place to the nearer  calamities impending.    Montana had taken drastic measures against the invading I.W.W. The  Governor of Idaho had sent word to the camps of the organization that  they had five days to leave that state. Spokane was awakening to the  menace of hordes of strange, idle men who came in on the westbound  freight-trains. The railroads had been unable to handle the situation.  They were being hard put to it to run trains at all. The train crews  that refused to join the I.W."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],[0,"Town Geology (#7)"],[1,"ither.    If you wish to learn the first elements of geology by direct   experiment, do this:  The next rainy day--the harder it rains the   better--instead of sitting at home over the fire, and reading a book   about geology, put on a macintosh and thick boots, and get away, I   care not whither, provided you can find there running water.  If you   have not time to get away to a hilly country, then go to the nearest   bit of turnpike road, or the nearest sloping field, and see in little   how whole continents are made, and unmade again.  Watch the rain   raking and sifting with its million delicate fingers, separating the   finer particles from the coarser, dropping the latter as soon as it   can, and carrying the former downward with it toward the sea.  Follow   the nearest roadside drain where it runs into a pond, and see how it   drops the pebbles the moment it enters the pond, and then the sand in   a fan-shaped heap at the nearest end; but carries the fine mud on,   and holds it suspended, to be gradually deposited at the bottom in   the still water; and say to yourself:  Perhaps the sands which cover   so many inland tracts were dropped by water, very near the shore of a   lake or sea, and by rapid currents.  Perhaps, again, the brick clays,   which are often mingled with these sands, were dropped, like the mud   in the pond, in deeper water farther from the shore, and certainly in   stilt water.  But more.  Suppose once more, then, that looking and   watching a pond being cleared out, under the lowest layer of mud, you   found--as you would find in any of those magnificent reservoirs so   common in the Lancashire hills--a layer of vegetable soil, with grass   and brushwood rooted in it.  What would you say but:  The pond has   not been always full.  It has at some time or other been dry enough   to let a whole copse grow up inside it?    And if you found--as you will actually find along some English   shores--under the sand hills, perhaps a bed of earth with shells and   bones; under that a bed of peat; under that one of blue silt; under   that a buried forest, with the trees upright and rooted; under that   another layer of blue silt full of roots and vegetable fibre; perhaps   under that again another old land surface with trees again growing in   it; and under all the main bottom clay of the district--what would   common sense tell you?  I leave you to discover for yourselves.  It   certainly would not tell you that those trees were thrust in there by   a violent convulsion, or that all those layers were deposited there   in a few days, or even a few years; and you might safely indulge in   speculations about the antiquity of the aestuary, and the changes   which it has undergone, with which I will not frighten you at   present.    It will be fair reasoning to argue thus.  You may not be always right   in your conclusion, but still you will be trying fairly to explain   the unknown by the known.    But have Rain and Rivers alone made the soil?    How very much they have done toward making it you will be able to   judge for yourselves, if you will read the sixth chapter of Sir   Charles Lyell's new \"Elements of Geology,\" or the first hundred pages   of that admirable book, De la Beche's \"Geological Observer;\" and   last, but not least, a very clever little book called \"Rain and   Rivers,\" by Colonel George Greenwood.    But though rain, like rivers, is a carrier of soil, it is more.  It   is a maker of soil, likewise; and by it mainly the soil of an upland   field is made, whether it be carried down to the sea or not.    If you will look into any quarry you will see that however compact   the rock may be a few feet below the surface, it becomes, in almost   every case, rotten and broken up as it nears the upper soil, till you   often cannot tell where the rock ends and the soil begins.    Now this change has been produced by rain.  First, mechanically, by   rain in the shape of ice.  The winter rain gets into the ground, and   does by the rock what it has done by the stones of many an old   building.  It sinks into the porous stone, freezes there, expands in   freezing, and splits and peels the stone with a force which is slowly   but surely crumbling the whole of Northern Europe and America to   powder.    Do you doubt me?  I say nothing but what you can judge of yourselves.    The next time you go up any mountain, look at the loose broken stones   with which the top is coated, just underneath the turf.  What has   broken them up but frost?  Look again, as stronger proof, at the   talus of broken stones--screes, as they call them in Scotland;   rattles, as we call them in Devon--which lie along the base of many   mountain cliffs.  What has brought them down but frost?  If you ask   the country folk they will tell you whether I am right or not.  If   you go thither, not in the summer, but just after the winter's frost,   you will see for yourselves, by the fresh frost-crop of newly-broken   bits, that I am right.  Possibly you may find me to be even more   right than is desirable, by having a few angular stones, from the   size of your head to that of your body, hurled at you by the frost-  giants up above.  If you go to the Alps at certain seasons, and hear   the thunder of the falling rocks, and see their long lines--moraines,   as they are called--sliding slowly down upon the surface of the   glacier, then you will be ready to believe the geologist who tells   you that frost, and probably frost alone, has hewn out such a peak as   the Matterhorn from some vast table-land; and is hewing it down   still, winter after winter, till some day, where the snow Alps now   stand, there shall be rolling uplands of rich cultivable soil.    So much for the mechanical action of rain, in the shape of ice.  Now   a few words on its chemical action.    Rain water is seldom pure.  It carries in it carbonic acid; and that   acid, beating in shower after shower against the face of a cliff--  especially if it be a limestone cliff--weathers the rock chemically;   changing (in case of limestone) the insoluble carbonate of lime into   a soluble bicarbonate, and carrying that away in water, which,   however clear, is still hard.  Hard water is usually water which has   invisible lime in it; there are from ten to fifteen grains and more   of lime in every gallon of limestone water.  I leave you to calculate   the enormous weight of lime which must be so carried down to the sea   every year by a single limestone or chalk brook.  You can calculate   it, if you like, by ascertaining the weight of lime in each gallon,   and the average quantity of water which comes down the stream in a   day; and when your sum is done, you will be astonished to find it one   not of many pounds, but probably of many tons, of solid lime, which   you never suspected or missed from the hills around.  Again, by the   time the rain has sunk through the soil, it is still less pure.  It   carries with it not only carbonic acid, but acids produced by   decaying vegetables--by the roots of the grasses and trees which grow   above; and they dissolve the cement of the rock by chemical action,   especially if the cement be lime or iron.  You may see this for   yourselves, again and again.  You may see how the root of a tree,   penetrating the earth, discolours the soil with which it is in   contact.  You may see how the whole rock, just below the soil, has   often changed in colour from the compact rock below, if the soil be   covered with a dense layer of peat or growing vegetables.    But there is another force at work, and quite as powerful as rain and   rivers, making the soil of alluvial flats.  Perhaps it has helped,   likewise, to make the soil of all the lowlands in these isles--and   that is, the waves of the sea.    If you ever go to Parkgate, in Cheshire, try if you cannot learn   there a little geology.    Walk beyond the town.  You find the shore protected for a long way by   a sea-wall, lest it should be eaten away by the waves.  What the   force of those waves can be, even on that sheltered coast, you may   judge--at least you could have judged this time last year--by the   masses of masonry torn from their iron clampings during the gale of   three winters since.  Look steadily at those rolled blocks, those   twisted stanchions, if they are there still; and then ask yourselves-  -it will be fair reasoning from the known to the unknown--What effect   must such wave-power as that have had beating and breaking for   thousands of years along the western coasts of England, Scotland,   Ireland?  It must have eaten up thousands of acres--whole shires, may   be, ere now.  Its teeth are strong enough, and it knows neither rest   nor pity, the cruel hungry sea.  Give it but time enough, and what   would it not eat up?  It would eat up, in the course of ages, all the   dry land of this planet, were it not baffled by another counteracting   force, of which I shall speak hereafter.    As you go on beyond the sea-wall, you find what it is eating up.  The   whole low cliff is going visibly.  But whither is it going?  To form   new soil in the aestuary.  Now you will not wonder how old harbours   so often become silted up.  The sea has washed the land into them.    But more, the sea-currents do not allow the sands of the aestuary to   escape freely out to sea.  They pile it up in shifting sand-banks   about the mouth of the aestuary.  The prevailing sea-winds, from   whatever quarter, catch up the sand, and roll it up into sand-hills.    Those sand-hills are again eaten down by the sea, and mixed with the   mud of the tide-flats, and so is formed a mingled soil, partly of   clayey mud, partly of sand; such a soil as stretches over the greater   part of all our lowlands.    Now, why should not that soil, whether in England or in Scotland,   have been made by the same means as that of every aestuary.    You find over great tracts of East Scotland,"]]]
