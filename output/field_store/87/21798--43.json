ADJECTIVES.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--You are now prepared to consider the _fourth  part of speech_. Those words that are added to the subject to modify its  meaning are called +Adjectives+.    Some grammarians have formed a separate class of the little words _the_,  and _an_ or _a_, calling them _articles_.    I will write the word _boys_ on the board, and you may name adjectives that  will appropriately modify it. As you give them, _I_ will write these  adjectives in a column.    _Adjectives_.    small    |  large    |  white    |  black    |  straight + boys.  crooked  |  five     |  some     |  all      |    What words here modify _boys_ by adding the idea of size? What by adding  the idea of color? What by adding the idea of form? What by adding the idea  of number? What are such words called? Why?    Let the teacher name familiar objects and require the pupils to join  appropriate adjectives to the names till their stock is exhausted.      +DEFINITION.--An _Adjective_ is a word used to modify a noun or a pronoun+.    Analysis and Parsing.    +Model+.--_A fearful storm was raging_. Diagram and analyze as in Lesson  20.    +Written Parsing+.    _Nouns_. | _Pronouns_. | _Adjectives_. | _Verbs_.  storm    | ----        | A fearful     | was raging.    +Oral Parsing+.--_A_ is an _adjective_, because it is joined to the noun  _storm_, to modify its meaning; _fearful_ is an _adjective_, because  ------; _storm_ is a noun, because ------; _was raging_ is a verb, because  -----.    1. The rosy morn advances.  2. The humble boon was obtained.  3. An unyielding firmness was displayed.  4. The whole earth smiles.  5. Several subsequent voyages were made.  6. That burly mastiff must be secured.  7. The slender greyhound was released.  8. The cold November rain is falling.  9. That valuable English watch has been sold.  10. I alone have escaped.  11. Both positions can be defended.  12. All such discussions should have been avoided.  13. That dilapidated old wooden building has fallen.    +To the Teacher+.--See Notes, pp. 169, 170.          LESSON 23.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    Prefix five adjectives to each of the following nouns.    Shrubs, wilderness, beggar, cattle, cloud.    Write ten sentences with modified subjects, using in each two or more of  the following adjectives.    A, an, the, heroic, one, all, many, every, either, first, tenth, frugal,  great, good, wise, honest, immense, square, circular, oblong, oval, mild,  virtuous, universal, sweet, careless, fragrant.    Write five sentences with modified subjects, each of which shall contain  one of the following words as a subject.    Chimney, hay, coach, robber, horizon.    _An_ and _a_ are forms of the same word, once spelled _an_, and meaning  _one_. After losing something of this force, _an_ was still used before  vowels and consonants alike; as, _an eagle, an ball, an hair, an use_.  Still later, and for the sake of ease in speaking, the word came to have  the two forms mentioned above; and an was retained before letters having  vowel sounds, but it dropped its _n_ and became _a_ before letters having  consonant sounds. This is the present usage.    CORRECT THESE ERRORS.    A apple; a obedient child; an brickbat; an busy boy.    CORRECT THESE ERRORS.    A heir; a hour; a honor.    Notice, the first letter of these words is _silent_.    CORRECT THESE ERRORS.    An unit; an utensil; an university; an ewe; an ewer; an union; an use; an  history; an one.    _Unit_ begins with the sound of the consonant _y_; and _one_, with that of  _w_.    +To the Teacher+.--See \"Suggestions for COMPOSITION EXERCISES,\" p. 8, last  paragraph.          LESSON 24.    MODIFIED PREDICATES.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--I will now show you how the _predicate_ of a  sentence may be modified.    _The ship sails gracefully_. What word is here joined to _sails_ to tell  the _manner_ of sailing? +P+.--_Gracefully_.    +T+.--_The ship sails immediately_. What word is here joined to _sails_ to  tell the _time_ of sailing? +P+.--_Immediately_.    +T+.--_The, ship sails homeward_. What word is here joined to _sails_ to  tell the _direction_ of sailing? +P+.--_Homeward_.    +T+.--These words _gracefully, immediately_, and _homeward_ are modifiers  of the predicate. In the first sentence, _sails gracefully_ is the  +_Modified Predicate_+.    Let the following modifiers be written on the board as the pupil suggests  them.                   | instantly.                 | soon.                 | daily.                 | hither.  The ship sails + hence.                 | there.                 | rapidly.                 | smoothly.                 | well.    Which words indicate the time of sailing? Which, the place? Which, the  manner?    The teacher may suggest predicates, and require the pupils to find as many  appropriate modifiers as they can.      The Predicate with its modifiers is called the +_Modified Predicate_+.    Analysis and Parsing.    Analyze and diagram the following sentences, and parse the nouns, pronouns,  verbs, and adjectives.    +Model+.--_The letters were rudely carved_.     letters |  were carved  =========|===============   \\The    |    \\rudely    +Written Parsing+.--See _Model_, Lesson 22.    +Oral Analysis+.--This is a sentence, because----; _letters_ is the  subject, because----; _were carved_ is the predicate, because----; _The_ is  a modifier of the subject, because----; _rudely_ is a modifier of the  predicate, because----; _The letters_ is the modified subject, _were rudely  carved_ is the _modified predicate_.    1. He spoke eloquently.  2. She chattered incessantly.  3. They searched everywhere.  4. I shall know presently.  5. The bobolink sings joyously.  6. The crowd cheered heartily.  7. A great victory was finally won.  8. Threatening clouds are moving slowly.  9. The deafening waves dash angrily.  10. These questions may be settled peaceably.  11. The wounded soldier fought bravely.  12. The ranks were quickly broken.  13. The south wind blows softly.  14. Times will surely change.  15. An hour stole on.          LESSON 25.    ANALYSIS AND PARSING.    ONE MODIFIER JOINED TO ANOTHER.    Analyze and diagram the following sentences, and parse the nouns, pronouns,  adjectives, and verbs.    +Model+.--_The frightened animal fled still more rapidly_.          animal       |         fled  ===================|=====================   \\The \\frightened  |   \\rapidly                            \\more                               \\still    +Explanation of the Diagram+.--Notice that the three lines forming this  group all slant the same way to show that each stands for a modifying word.  The line standing for the principal word of the group is joined to the  predicate line. The end of each of the other two lines is broken, and  turned to touch its principal at an angle.    +Oral Analysis+.--This is a sentence, because----; _animal_ is the subject,  because----; _fled_ is the predicate, because----; _The_ and _frightened_  are modifiers of the subject, because----; _still more rapidly_ is a  modifier of the predicate, because it is a group of words joined to it to  limit its meaning; _rapidly_ is the principal word of the group; _more_  modifies _rapidly_, and _still_ modifies _more_, _The frightened animal_ is  the modified subject; _fled still more rapidly_ is the modified predicate.    1. The crocus flowers very early.  2. A violet bed is budding near.  3. The Quakers were most shamefully persecuted.  4. Perhaps he will return.  5. We laughed very heartily.  6. The yellow poplar leaves floated down.  7. The wind sighs so mournfully.  8. Few men have ever fought so stubbornly.  9. The debt will probably be paid.  10. The visitor will soon be here.  11. That humane project was quite generously sustained.  12. A perfectly innocent man was very cruelly persecuted.    REVIEW QUESTIONS.    What is an adjective? What are the words _an_ or _a_, and _the_ called by  some grammarians? When is _a_ used, and when _an?_ Give examples of their  misuse.    What is the modified predicate? Give an example. Give an example of one  modifier joined to another.          LESSON 26.    Select your subjects from Lesson 9, and construct twenty sentences having  modified subjects and modified predicates.    Impromptu Exercise.    Select sentences from Lessons 6, 7, and 11, and conduct the exercise as  directed in Lesson 10. Let the strife be to see who can supply the greatest  number of modifiers to the subject and to the predicate. The teacher can  vary this exercise.          LESSON 27.    ADVERBS.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--You have learned, in the preceding Lessons,  that the meaning of the predicate may be limited by modifiers, and that one  modifier may be joined to another. Words used to modify the predicate of a  sentence and those used to modify modifiers belong to one class, or one  _part of speech_, and are called +Adverbs+.    +T+.--_She decided too hastily_. What word tells how she decided?  +P+.---_Hastily_. +T+.--What word tells how hastily? +P+.--_Too_.  +T+.--What then are the words _too_ and _hastily?_ +P+.--Adverbs.    +T+.--_Too much time has been wasted_. What word modifies _much_ by telling  how much? +P+.--_Too_. +T+.--W"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7014"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#6)"],[1," confound with the Typha  angustifolia of our marshes. It is only after a careful examination,  that we recognise each of these plants for distinct species,* (*  Potamogeton tenuifolium, Chara compressa, Typha tenuifolia.) peculiar  to the new continent. How many plants of the straits of Magellan, of  Chile, and the Cordilleras of Quito have formerly been confounded with  the productions of the northern temperate zone, owing to their analogy  in form and appearance.    The inhabitants of the valleys of Aragua often inquire why the  southern shore of the lake, particularly the south-west part towards  los Aguacotis, is generally more shaded, and exhibits fresher verdure  than the northern side. We saw, in the month of February, many trees  stripped of their foliage, near the Hacienda de Cura, at Mocundo, and  at Guacara; while to the south-east of Valencia everything presaged  the approach of the rains. I believe that in the early part of the  year, when the sun has southern declination, the hills around  Valencia, Guacara, and Cura are scorched by the heat of the solar  rays, while the southern shore receives, along with the breeze when it  enters the valley by the Abra de Porto Cabello, an atmosphere which  has crossed the lake, and is loaded with aqueous vapour. On this  southern shore, near Guaruto, are situated the finest plantations of  tobacco in the whole province.    Among the rivers flowing into the lake of Valencia some owe their  origin to thermal springs, and deserve particular attention. These  springs gush out at three points of the granitic Cordillera of the  coast; near Onoto, between Turmero and Maracay; near Mariara,  north-east of the Hacienda de Cura; and near Las Trincheras, on the  road from Nueva Valencia to Porto Cabello. I could examine with care  only the physical and geological relations of the thermal waters of  Mariara and Las Trincheras. In going up the small river Cura towards  its source, the mountains of Mariara are seen advancing into the plain  in the form of a vast amphitheatre, composed of perpendicular rocks,  crowned by peaks with rugged summits. The central point of the  amphitheatre bears the strange name of the Devil's Nook (Rincon del  Diablo). The range stretching to the east is called El Chaparro; that  to the west, Las Viruelas. These ruin-like rocks command the plain;  they are composed of a coarse-grained granite, nearly porphyritic, the  yellowish white feldspar crystals of which are more than an inch and a  half long. Mica is rare in them, and is of a fine silvery lustre.  Nothing can be more picturesque and solemn than the aspect of this  group of mountains, half covered with vegetation. The Peak of  Calavera, which unites the Rincon del Diablo to the Chaparro, is  visible from afar. In it the granite is separated by perpendicular  fissures into prismatic masses. It would seem as if the primitive rock  were crowned with columns of basalt. In the rainy season, a  considerable sheet of water rushes down like a cascade from these  cliffs. The mountains connected on the east with the Rincon del  Diablo, are much less lofty, and contain, like the promontory of La  Cabrera, and the little detached hills in the plain, gneiss and  mica-slate, including garnets.    In these lower mountains, two or three miles north-east of Mariara, we  find the ravine of hot waters called Quebrada de Aguas Calientes. This  ravine, running north-west 75 degrees, contains several small basins.  Of these the two uppermost, which have no communication with each  other, are only eight inches in diameter; the three lower, from two to  three feet. Their depth varies from three to fifteen inches. The  temperature of these different funnels (pozos) is from 56 to 59  degrees; and what is remarkable, the lower funnels are hotter than the  upper, though the difference of the level is only seven or eight  inches. The hot waters, collected together, form a little rivulet,  called the Rio de Aguas Calientes, which, thirty feet lower, has a  temperature of only 48 degrees. In seasons of great drought, the time  at which we visited the ravine, the whole body of the thermal waters  forms a section of only twenty-six square inches. This is considerably  augmented in the rainy season; the rivulet is then transformed into a  torrent, and its heat diminishes for it appears that the hot springs  themselves are subject only to imperceptible variations. All these  springs are slightly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas. The  fetid smell, peculiar to this gas, can be perceived only by  approaching very near the springs. In one of these wells only, the  temperature of which is 56.2 degrees, bubbles of air are evolved at  nearly regular intervals of two or three minutes. I observed that  these bubbles constantly rose from the same points, which are four in  number; and that it was not possible to change the places from which  the gas is emitted, by stirring the bottom of the basin with a stick.  These places correspond no doubt to holes or fissures on the gneiss;  and indeed when the bubbles rise from one of the apertures, the  emission of gas follows instantly from the other three. I could not  succeed in inflaming the small quantities of gas that rise above the  thermal waters, or those I collected in a glass phial held over the  springs, an operation that excited in me a nausea, caused less by the  smell of the gas, than by the excessive heat prevailing in this  ravine. Is this sulphuretted hydrogen mixed with a great proportion of  carbonic acid or atmospheric air? I am doubtful of the first of these  mixtures, though so common in thermal waters; for example at Aix la  Chapelle, Enghien, and Bareges. The gas collected in the tube of  Fontana's eudiometer had been shaken for a long time with water. The  small basins are covered with a light film of sulphur, deposited by  the sulphuretted hydrogen in its slow combustion in contact with the  atmospheric oxygen. A few plants near the springs were encrusted with  sulphur. This deposit is scarcely visible when the water of Mariara is  suffered to cool in an open vessel; no doubt because the quantity of  disengaged gas is very small, and is not renewed. The water, when  cold, gives no precipitate with a solution of nitrate of copper; it is  destitute of flavour, and very drinkable. If it contain any saline  substances, for example, the sulphates of soda or magnesia, their  quantities must be very insignificant. Being almost destitute of  chemical tests,* (* A small case, containing acetate of lead, nitrate  of silver, alcohol, prussiate of potash, etc., had been left by  mistake at Cumana. I evaporated some of the water of Mariara, and it  yielded only a very small residuum, which, digested with nitric acid,  appeared to contain only a little silica and extractive vegetable  matter.) we contented ourselves with filling at the spring two  bottles, which were sent, along with the nourishing milk of the tree  called palo de vaca, to MM. Fourcroy and Vauquelin, by the way of  Porto Cabello and the Havannah. This purity in hot waters issuing  immediately from granite mountains is in Europe, as well as in the New  Continent, a most curious phenomenon.* (* Warm springs equally pure  are found issuing from the granites of Portugal, and those of Cantal.  In Italy, the Pisciarelli of the lake Agnano have a temperature equal  to 93 degrees. Are these pure waters produced by condensed vapours?)  How can we explain the origin of the sulphuretted hydrogen? It cannot  proceed from the decomposition of sulphurets of iron, or pyritic  strata. Is it owing to sulphurets of calcium, of magnesium, or other  earthy metalloids, contained in the interior of our planet, under its  rocky and oxidated crust?    In the ravine of the hot waters of Mariara, amidst little funnels, the  temperature of which rises from 56 to 59 degrees, two species of  aquatic plants vegetate; the one is membranaceous, and contains  bubbles of air; the other has parallel fibres. The first much  resembles the Ulva labyrinthiformis of Vandelli, which the thermal  waters of Europe furnish. At the island of Amsterdam, tufts of  lycopodium and marchantia have been seen in places where the heat of  the soil was far greater: such is the effect of an habitual stimulus  on the organs of plants. The waters of Mariara contain no aquatic  insects. Frogs are found in them, which, being probably chased by  serpents, have leaped into the funnels, and there perished.    South of the ravine, in the plain extending towards the shore of the  lake, another sulphureous spring gushes out, less hot and less  impregnated with gas. The crevice whence this water issues is six  toises higher than the funnel just described. The thermometer did not  rise in the crevice above 42 degrees. The water is collected in a  basin surrounded by large trees; it is nearly circular, from fifteen  to eighteen feet diameter, and three feet deep. The slaves throw  themselves into this bath at the end of the day, when covered with  dust, after having worked in the neighbouring fields of indigo and  sugar-cane. Though the water of this bath (bano) is habitually from 12  to 14 degrees hotter than the air, the negroes call it refreshing;  because in the torrid zone this term is used for whatever restores  strength, calms the irritation of the nerves, or causes a feeling of  comfort. We ourselves experienced the salutary effects of the bath.  Having slung our hammocks on the trees round the basin, we passed a  whole day in this charming spot, which abounds in plants. We found  near the bano of Mariara the volador, or gyrocarpus. The winged fruits  of this large tree turn like a fly-wheel, when they fall from the  stalk. On shaking the branches of the volador, we saw the air filled  with its fruits, the simultaneous fall of which presents the most  singular spectacle. The two membranaceous and striated wings are  turned so as to meet the air, in falling,"]]]
