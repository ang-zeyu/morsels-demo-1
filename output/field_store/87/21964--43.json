But is utility the only  creed which is able to furnish us with excuses for evil doing, and means  of cheating our own conscience? They are afforded in abundance by all  doctrines which recognise as a fact in morals the existence of  conflicting considerations; which all doctrines do, that have been  believed by sane persons. It is not the fault of any creed, but of the  complicated nature of human affairs, that rules of conduct cannot be so  framed as to require no exceptions, and that hardly any kind of action  can safely be laid down as either always obligatory or always  condemnable. There is no ethical creed which does not temper the  rigidity of its laws, by giving a certain latitude, under the moral  responsibility of the agent, for accommodation to peculiarities of  circumstances; and under every creed, at the opening thus made,  self-deception and dishonest casuistry get in. There exists no moral  system under which there do not arise unequivocal cases of conflicting  obligation. These are the real difficulties, the knotty points both in  the theory of ethics, and in the conscientious guidance of personal  conduct. They are overcome practically with greater or with less success  according to the intellect and virtue of the individual; but it can  hardly be pretended that any one will be the less qualified for dealing  with them, from possessing an ultimate standard to which conflicting  rights and duties can be referred. If utility is the ultimate source of  moral obligations, utility may be invoked to decide between them when  their demands are incompatible. Though the application of the standard  may be difficult, it is better than none at all: while in other systems,  the moral laws all claiming independent authority, there is no common  umpire entitled to interfere between them; their claims to precedence  one over another rest on little better than sophistry, and unless  determined, as they generally are, by the unacknowledged influence of  considerations of utility, afford a free scope for the action of  personal desires and partialities. We must remember that only in these  cases of conflict between secondary principles is it requisite that  first principles should be appealed to. There is no case of moral  obligation in which some secondary principle is not involved; and if  only one, there can seldom be any real doubt which one it is, in the  mind of any person by whom the principle itself is recognized.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote A: The author of this essay has reason for believing himself  to be the first person who brought the word utilitarian into use. He did  not invent it, but adopted it from a passing expression in Mr. Galt's  _Annals of the Parish_. After using it as a designation for several  years, he and others abandoned it from a growing dislike to anything  resembling a badge or watchword of sectarian distinction. But as a name  for one single opinion, not a set of opinions--to denote the recognition  of utility as a standard, not any particular way of applying it--the  term supplies a want in the language, and offers, in many cases, a  convenient mode of avoiding tiresome circumlocution.]    [Footnote B: An opponent, whose intellectual and moral fairness it is a  pleasure to acknowledge (the Rev. J. Llewellyn Davis), has objected to  this passage, saying, \"Surely the rightness or wrongness of saving a man  from drowning does depend very much upon the motive with which it is  done. Suppose that a tyrant, when his enemy jumped into the sea to  escape from him, saved him from drowning simply in order that he might  inflict upon him more exquisite tortures, would it tend to clearness to  speak of that rescue as 'a morally right action?' Or suppose again,  according to one of the stock illustrations of ethical inquiries, that a  man betrayed a trust received from a friend, because the discharge of it  would fatally injure that friend himself or some one belonging to him,  would utilitarianism compel one to call the betrayal 'a crime' as much  as if it had been done from the meanest motive?\"    I submit, that he who saves another from drowning in order to kill him  by torture afterwards, does not differ only in motive from him who does  the same thing from duty or benevolence; the act itself is different.  The rescue of the man is, in the case supposed, only the necessary first  step of an act far more atrocious than leaving him to drown would have  been. Had Mr. Davis said, \"The rightness or wrongness of saving a man  from drowning does depend very much\"--not upon the motive, but--\"upon  the _intention_\" no utilitarian would have differed from him. Mr. Davis,  by an oversight too common not to be quite venial, has in this case  confounded the very different ideas of Motive and Intention. There is no  point which utilitarian thinkers (and Bentham pre-eminently) have taken  more pains to illustrate than this. The morality of the action depends  entirely upon the intention--that is, upon what the agent _wills to do_.  But the motive, that is, the feeling which makes him will so to do, when  it makes no difference in the act, makes none in the morality: though it  makes a great difference in our moral estimation of the agent,  especially if it indicates a good or a bad habitual _disposition_--a  bent of character from which useful, or from which hurtful actions are  likely to arise.]          CHAPTER III.      OF THE ULTIMATE SANCTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF UTILITY.    The question is often asked, and properly so, in regard to any supposed  moral standard--What is its sanction? what are the motives to obey it?  or more specifically, what is the source of its obligation? whence does  it derive its binding force? It is a necessary part of moral philosophy  to provide the answer to this question; which, though frequently  assuming the shape of an objection to the utilitarian morality, as if it  had some special applicability to that above others, really arises in  regard to all standards. It arises, in fact, whenever a person is called  on to adopt a standard or refer morality to any basis on which he has  not been accustomed to rest it. For the customary morality, that which  education and opinion have consecrated, is the only one which presents  itself to the mind with the feeling of being _in itself_ obligatory; and  when a person is asked to believe that this morality _derives_ its  obligation from some general principle round which custom has not thrown  the same halo, the assertion is to him a paradox; the supposed  corollaries seem to have a more binding force than the original theorem;  the superstructure seems to stand better without, than with, what is  represented as its foundation. He says to himself, I feel that I am  bound not to rob or murder, betray or deceive; but why am I bound to  promote the general happiness? If my own happiness lies in something  else, why may I not give that the preference?    If the view adopted by the utilitarian philosophy of the nature of the  moral sense be correct, this difficulty will always present itself,  until the influences which form moral character have taken the same hold  of the principle which they have taken of some of the  consequences--until, by the improvement of education, the feeling of  unity with our fellow creatures shall be (what it cannot be doubted that  Christ intended it to be) as deeply rooted in our character, and to our  own consciousness as completely a part of our nature, as the horror of  crime is in an ordinarily well-brought-up young person. In the mean  time, however, the difficulty has no peculiar application to the  doctrine of utility, but is inherent in every attempt to analyse  morality and reduce it to principles; which, unless the principle is  already in men's minds invested with as much sacredness as any of its  applications, always seems to divest them of a part of their sanctity.    The principle of utility either has, or there is no reason why it might  not have, all the sanctions which belong to any other system of morals.  Those sanctions are either external or internal. Of the external  sanctions it is not necessary to speak at any length. They are, the hope  of favour and the fear of displeasure from our fellow creatures or from  the Ruler of the Universe, along with whatever we may have of sympathy  or affection for them or of love and awe of Him, inclining us to do His  will independently of selfish consequences. There is evidently no  reason why all these motives for observance should not attach themselves  to the utilitarian morality, as completely and as powerfully as to any  other. Indeed, those of them which refer to our fellow creatures are  sure to do so, in proportion to the amount of general intelligence; for  whether there be any other ground of moral obligation than the general  happiness or not, men do desire happiness; and however imperfect may be  their own practice, they desire and commend all conduct in others  towards themselves, by which they think their happiness is promoted.  With regard to the religious motive, if men believe, as most profess to  do, in the goodness of God, those who think that conduciveness to the  general happiness is the essence, or even only the criterion, of good,  must necessarily believe that it is also that which God approves. The  whole force therefore of external reward and punishment, whether  physical or moral, and whether proceeding from God or from our fellow  men, together with all that the capacities of human nature admit, of  disinterested devotion to either, become available to enforce the  utilitarian morality, in proportion as that morality is recognized; and  the more powerfully, the more the appliances of education and general  cultivation are bent to the purpose.

One day he was an hussar,  the next a lancer, and then again in some fancy uniform. At will he was  chief of a squadron, commandant, aide-de-camp, colonel, &c.; and to  command more consideration, he did not fail to give himself a  respectable parentage; he was by turns the son of the valiant Lasalle,  of the gallant Winter, colonel of the grenadiers of the imperial  horse-guard; nephew of the general Comte de Lagrange, and cousin-german  to Rapp; in fact, there was no name which he did not borrow, no  illustrious family to which he did not belong. Born of parents in a  decent situation of life, Winter had received an education sufficiently  brilliant to enable him to aspire to all these metamorphoses; the  elegance of his manner, and a most gentlemanly appearance, completed  the illusion.    Few men had made a better debut than Winter. Thrown early into the  career of arms, he obtained very rapid promotion; but when an officer he  soon lost the esteem of his superiors; who, to punish his misconduct,  sent him to the Isle of Re, to one of the colonial battalions. There  he so conducted himself as to inspire a belief that he had entirely  reformed. But no sooner was he raised a step, than committing some fresh  peccadillo, he was compelled to desert in order to avoid punishment.  He came thence to Paris, where his exploits as swindler and pickpocket  procured him the unenviable distinction of being pointed out to the  police as one of the most skilful in his twofold profession.    Winter, who was what is termed a _downy one_, plucked a multitude  of _gulpins_ even in the most elevated classes of society. He  visited princes, dukes, the sons of ancient senators, and it was on  them or the ladies of their circle that he made the experiments of his  misapplied talents. The females, particularly, however squeamish they  were, were never sufficiently so to prevent themselves from being  plundered by him. For several months the police were on the look out for  this seducing young man, who, changing his dress and abode incessantly,  escaped from their clutch at the moment when they thought they had him  securely, when I received orders to commence the chase after him, to  attempt his capture.    Winter was one of those Lovelaces who never deceive a woman without  robbing her. I thought that amongst his victims I could find at least  one, who, from a spirit of revenge, would be disposed to put me on the  scent of this monster. By dint of searching, I thought I had met with a  willing auxiliary, but as these Ariadnes, however ill used or forsaken  they may be, yet shrink from the immolation of their betrayer, I  determined to accost the damsel I met with cautiously. It was necessary,  before I ventured my bark, to take soundings, and I took care not to  manifest any hostility towards Winter, and not to alarm that residue of  tenderness, which, despite of ill usage, always remains in a sensitive  heart. I made my appearance in the character of almoner of the regiment  of which he was thought to command, and as such introduced to the  ci-devant mistress of the pretended colonel. The costume, the language,  the manner I assumed were in perfect unison with the character I was  about to play, and I obtained to my wish the confidence of the fair  forsaken one, who gave me unwittingly all the information I required.  She pointed out to me her favoured rival, who, already ill-treated by  Winter, had still the weakness to see him, and could not forbear making  fresh sacrifices for him.    I became acquainted with this charming lady, and to obtain favour in her  eyes, announced myself as a friend of her lover's family. The relatives  of the young giddy pate had empowered me to pay his debts; and if she  could contrive an interview with him for me, she might rely on being  satisfied with the result of the first. Madame ------ was not sorry to  have an opportunity of repairing the dilapidations made on her property,  and one morning sent me a note, stating that she was going to dine  with her lover the next day at the Boulevard du Temple, at La Galiote.  At four o'clock I went, disguised as a messenger, and stationed myself  at the door of the restaurant's; and after two hours' watch, I saw a  colonel of hussars approach. It was Winter, attended by two servants.  I went up to him, and offered to take care of the horses, which proffer  was accepted. Winter alighted, he could not escape me, but his eyes met  mine, and with one jump he flung himself on his horse, spurred him, and  disappeared.    I thought I had him, and my disappointment was great; but I did not  despair of catching my gentleman. Some time afterwards I learnt that  he was to be at the Cafe Hardi, in the Boulevard des Italiens. I went  thither with some of my agents, and when he arrived all was so well  arranged, that he had only to get into a hackney coach, of which I paid  the fare. Led before a commissary of police, he asserted that he was  not Winter; but, despite the insignia of the rank he had conferred on  himself, and the long string of orders hanging on his breast, he was  properly and officially identified as the individual mentioned in the  warrant which I had for his apprehension.    Winter was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, and would now be at  liberty but for a forgery which he committed while at Bicetre, which,  bringing on him a fresh sentence of eight years at the galleys, he was  conducted to the Bagne at the expiration of his original sentence, and  is there at present.    This adventurer does not want wit: he is, I am told, the author of a  vast many songs, much in fashion with the galley slaves, who consider  him us their Anacreon.           *       *       *       *       *      ANCIENT TYRE.      The Tyrians, although not so early celebrated either in sacred or  profane history, had yet attained greater renown than their Sidonian  kinsmen. It is useless to conjecture at what period or under what  circumstances these eastern colonists had quitted the shores of the  Persian gulf, and fixed their seat on the narrow belt between the  mountains of Lebanon and the sea. Probably at first they were only  factories, established for connecting the trade between the eastern and  western world. If so, their origin must be sought among the natives  to the east of the Assyrians, as that race of industrious cultivators  possessed no shipping, and was hostile to commerce. The colonists  took root on this shore, became prosperous and wealthy, covered the  Mediterranean with their fleets, and its shores with their factories.  Tyre in the course of time became the dominant city, and under her  supremacy were founded the Phoenician colonies in Greece, Sicily,  Africa, and Spain. The wealth of her merchant princes had often tempted  the cupidity of the despots of Asia. Salmanassar, the Assyrian conqueror  of Israel, directed his attacks against Tyre, and continued them for  five years, but was finally compelled to raise the siege. Nabuchadonosor  was more persevering, and succeeded in capturing the city, after a siege  that lasted thirteen years. The old town, situated on the continent was  never rebuilt; but a new Tyre rose from its ruins. This occupied the  area of a small island, described by Pliny as two miles and a half in  circumference. On this confined space a large population existed, and  remedied the want of extent by raising story upon story, on the plan  followed by the ancient inhabitants of Edinburgh. It was separated from  the main land by an armlet of the sea, about half a mile in breadth  and about eighteen feet deep. The city was encircled by walls and  fortifications of great strength and height, and scarcely pregnable  even if accessible.    _Family Library, No. 3._           *       *       *       *       *      SIR WILLIAM DEVEREUX,    _A Portrait--by the Author of Pelham._      My uncle did as his ancestors had done before him; and, cheap as the  dignity had grown, went up to court to be knighted by Charles II. He was  so delighted with what he saw of the metropolis, that he foreswore all  intention of leaving it, took to Sedley and champagne, flirted with Nell  Gwynne, lost double the value of his brother's portion at one sitting to  the chivalrous Grammont, wrote a comedy corrected by Etherege, and took  a wife recommended by Rochester. The wife brought him a child six months  after marriage, and the infant was born on the same day the comedy was  acted. Luckily for the honour of the house, my uncle shared the fate of  Plimneus, king of Sicyon, and all the offspring he ever had (that is to  say, the child and the play,) \"died as soon as they were born.\" My uncle  was now only at a loss to know what to do with his wife, that remaining  treasure, whose readiness to oblige him had been so miraculously  evinced. She saved him the trouble of long cogitation,--an exercise  of intellect to which he was never too ardently inclined. There was  a gentleman of the court celebrated for his sedateness and solemnity;  my aunt was piqued into emulating Orpheus, and six weeks after her  confinement she put this rock into motion,--they eloped. Poor gentleman!  it must have been a severe trial of patience to a man never known before  to transgress the very slowest of all possible walks, to have had two  events of the most rapid nature happen to him in the same week. Scarcely  had he recovered the shock of being ran away with by my aunt, before,  terminating for ever his vagrancies, he was ran through by my uncle.  The wits made an epigram upon the event; and my uncle, who was as bold  as a lion at the point of a sword, was, to speak frankly, terribly  disconcerted by the point of a jest. He retired to the country in a  fit of disgust and gout. Here his own _bon naturel_ rose from the  layers of art which had long oppressed it, and he solaced himself by  righteously governing domains worthy of a prince, for the mortifications  he had experienced "]]]
