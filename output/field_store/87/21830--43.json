Patrasche had lived in  harness, and he was proud of it. He suffered a great deal sometimes from  frost, and the terrible roads, and the rheumatic pains of his limbs, but  he only drew his breath hard and bent his stout neck, and trod onward  with steady patience.    \"Rest thee at home, Patrasche--it is time thou didst rest--and I can  quite well push in the cart by myself,\" urged Nello many a morning; but  Patrasche, who understood him aright, would no more have consented  to stay at home than a veteran soldier to shirk when the charge was  sounding; and every day he would rise and place himself in his shafts,  and plod along over the snow through the fields that his four round feet  had left their print upon so many, many years.    \"One must never rest till one dies,\" thought Patrasche; and sometimes it  seemed to him that that time of rest for him was not very far off. His  sight was less clear than it had been, and it gave him pain to rise  after the night's sleep, though he would never lie a moment in his straw  when once the bell of the chapel tolling five let him know that the  daybreak of labor had begun.    \"My poor Patrasche, we shall soon lie quiet together, you and I,\" said  old Jehan Daas, stretching out to stroke the head of Patrasche with the  old withered hand which had always shared with him its one poor crust of  bread; and the hearts of the old man and the old dog ached together with  one thought: When they were gone, who would care for their darling?    One afternoon, as they came back from Antwerp over the snow, which had  become hard and smooth as marble over all the Flemish plains, they found  dropped in the road a pretty little puppet, a tambourine--player, all  scarlet and gold, about six inches high, and, unlike greater personages  when Fortune lets them drop, quite unspoiled and unhurt by its fall. It  was a pretty toy. Nello tried to find its owner, and, failing, thought  that it was just the thing to please Alois.    It was quite night when he passed the mill-house: he knew the little  window of her room. It could be no harm, he thought, if he gave her his  little piece of treasure-trove, they had been playfellows so long. There  was a shed with a sloping roof beneath her casement: he climbed it and  tapped softly at the lattice: there was a little light within. The  child opened it and looked out half frightened. Nello put the  tambourine-player into her hands. \"Here is a doll I found in the snow,  Alois. Take it,\" he whispered--\"take it, and God bless thee, dear!\"    He slid down from the shed-roof before she had time to thank him, and  ran off through the darkness.    That night there was a fire at the mill. Outbuildings and much corn  were destroyed, although the mill itself and the dwelling-house were  unharmed. All the village was out in terror, and engines came tearing  through the snow from Antwerp. The miller was insured, and would lose  nothing: nevertheless, he was in furious wrath, and declared aloud that  the fire was due to no accident, but to some foul intent.    Nello, awakened from his sleep, ran to help with the rest: Baas Cogez  thrust him angrily aside. \"Thou wert loitering here after dark,\" he said  roughly. \"I believe, on my soul, that thou dost know more of the fire  than any one.\"    Nello heard him in silence, stupefied, not supposing that any one could  say such things except in jest, and not comprehending how any one could  pass a jest at such a time.    Nevertheless, the miller said the brutal thing openly to many of his  neighbors in the day that followed; and though no serious charge was  ever preferred against the lad, it got bruited about that Nello had been  seen in the mill-yard after dark on some unspoken errand, and that he  bore Baas Cogez a grudge for forbidding his intercourse with little  Alois; and so the hamlet, which followed the sayings of its richest  landowner servilely, and whose families all hoped to secure the riches  of Alois in some future time for their sons, took the hint to give grave  looks and cold words to old Jehan Daas's grandson. No one said anything  to him openly, but all the village agreed together to humor the miller's  prejudice, and at the cottages and farms where Nello and Patrasche  called every morning for the milk for Antwerp, downcast glances and  brief phrases replaced to them the broad smiles and cheerful greetings  to which they had been always used. No one really credited the miller's  absurd suspicion, nor the outrageous accusations born of them, but the  people were all very poor and very ignorant, and the one rich man of  the place had pronounced against him. Nello, in his innocence and his  friendlessness, had no strength to stem the popular tide.    \"Thou art very cruel to the lad,\" the miller's wife dared to say,  weeping, to her lord. \"Sure he is an innocent lad and a faithful, and  would never dream of any such wickedness, however sore his heart might  be.\"    But Baas Cogez being an obstinate man, having once said a thing held  to it doggedly, though in his innermost soul he knew well the injustice  that he was committing.    Meanwhile, Nello endured the injury done against him with a certain  proud patience that disdained to complain: he only gave way a little  when he was quite alone with old Patrasche. Besides, he thought, \"If it  should win! They will be sorry then, perhaps.\"    Still, to a boy not quite sixteen, and who had dwelt in one little world  all his short life, and in his childhood had been caressed and applauded  on all sides, it was a hard trial to have the whole of that little world  turn against him for naught. Especially hard in that bleak, snow-bound,  famine-stricken winter-time, when the only light and warmth there could  be found abode beside the village hearths and in the kindly greetings of  neighbors. In the winter-time all drew nearer to each other, all to all,  except to Nello and Patrasche, with whom none now would have anything  to do, and who were left to fare as they might with the old paralyzed,  bedridden man in the little cabin, whose fire was often low, and whose  board was often without bread, for there was a buyer from Antwerp who  had taken to drive his mule in of a day for the milk of the various  dairies, and there were only three or four of the people who had refused  his terms of purchase and remained faithful to the little green cart.  So that the burden which Patrasche drew had become very light, and the  centime-pieces in Nello's pouch had become, alas! very small likewise.    The dog would stop, as usual, at all the familiar gates, which were now  closed to him, and look up at them with wistful, mute appeal; and it  cost the neighbors a pang to shut their doors and their hearts, and let  Patrasche draw his cart on again, empty. Nevertheless, they did it, for  they desired to please Baas Cogez.    Noel was close at hand.    The weather was very wild and cold. The snow was six feet deep, and the  ice was firm enough to bear oxen and men upon it everywhere. At this  season the little village was always gay and cheerful. At the poorest  dwelling there were possets and cakes, joking and dancing, sugared  saints and gilded Jesus. The merry Flemish bells jingled everywhere on  the horses; everywhere within doors some well-filled soup-pot sang and  smoked over the stove; and everywhere over the snow without laughing  maidens pattered in bright kerchiefs and stout kirtles, going to and  from the mass. Only in the little hut it was very dark and very cold.    Nello and Patrasche were left utterly alone, for one night in the week  before the Christmas Day, Death entered there, and took away from life  forever old Jehan Daas, who had never known life aught save its poverty  and its pains. He had long been half dead, incapable of any movement  except a feeble gesture, and powerless for anything beyond a gentle  word; and yet his loss fell on them both with a great horror in it: they  mourned him passionately. He had passed away from them in his sleep,  and when in the gray dawn they learned their bereavement, unutterable  solitude and desolation seemed to close around them. He had long been  only a poor, feeble, paralyzed old man, who could not raise a hand in  their defence, but he had loved them well: his smile had always  welcomed their return. They mourned for him unceasingly, refusing to be  comforted, as in the white winter day they followed the deal shell that  held his body to the nameless grave by the little gray church. They were  his only mourners, these two whom he had left friendless upon earth--the  young boy and the old dog.    \"Surely, he will relent now and let the poor lad come hither?\" thought  the miller's wife, glancing at her husband smoking by the hearth.    Baas Cogez knew her thought, but he hardened his heart, and would not  unbar his door as the little, humble funeral went by. \"The boy is a  beggar,\" he said to himself: \"he shall not be about Alois.\"    The woman dared not say anything aloud, but when the grave was closed  and the mourners had gone, she put a wreath of immortelles into Alois's  hands and bade her go and lay it reverently on the dark, unmarked mound  where the snow was displaced.    Nello and Patrasche went home with broken hearts. But even of that poor,  melancholy, cheerless home they were denied the consolation. There was a  month's rent over-due for their little home, and when Nello had paid the  last sad service to the dead he had not a coin left. He went and begged  grace of the owner of the hut, a cobbler who went every Sunday night  to drink his pint of wine and smoke with Baas Cogez. The cobbler would  grant no mercy. He was a harsh, miserly man, and loved money. He claimed  in default of his rent every stick and stone, every pot and pan, in the  hut, and bade Nello and Patrasche be out of it on the morrow.    Now, the cabin was lowly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7777"],[0,"Narrative of the Voyages Round the World, Performed (#6)"],[1,"degrees to the westward, and three and a half to the  northward of the Strait of Magalhaens; and, during this time, the ship  scarcely received any damage. Whereas, if he had come into the Pacific  Ocean by that passage, he would not have been able to accomplish it in  less than three months; besides which, his people would have been  fatigued, and the anchors, cables, sails, and rigging of the vessel  much injured. By the course he pursued, none of these inconveniences  were suffered. In short, Lieutenant Cook, by his own example in  doubling Cape Horn, by his accurate ascertainment of the latitude and  longitude of the places he came to, and by his instructions to future  voyagers, performed the most essential services to this part of  navigation. It was on the 26th of January that the Endeavour took her  departure from Cape Horn; and it appeared; that, from that time to the  1st of March, during a run of six hundred and sixty leagues, there was  no current which affected the ship. Hence it was highly probable that  our navigators had been near no land of any considerable extent,  currents being always found when land is not remote.    In the prosecution of Lieutenant Cook's voyage from Cape Horn to  Otaheite, several islands were discovered, to which the names were  given of Lagoon Island, Thrump-cap, Bow Island, The Groups, Bird  Island, and Chain Island. It appeared that most of these islands were  inhabited; and the verdure, and groves of palm-trees, which were  visible upon some of them, gave them the aspect of a terrestrial  paradise to men who, excepting the dreary hills of Terra del Fuego,  had seen nothing for a long time but sky and water.    On the 11th of April, the Endeavour arrived in sight of Otaheite, and  on the 13th she came to an anchor in Port Royal Bay, which is called  MATAVIA by the natives. As the stay of the English in the island was  not likely to be very short, and much depended on the manner in which  traffic should be carried on with the inhabitants, Lieutenant Cook,  with great good sense and humanity, drew up a set of regulations for  the behaviour of his people, and gave it in command that they should  punctually be observed.[5]      [Footnote 5: The rules were as follow: '1. To endeavour, by every    fair means, to cultivate a friendship with the natives: and to    treat them with all imaginable humanity. 2. A proper person or    persons will be appointed to trade with the natives for all manner    of provisions, fruit, and other productions of the earth; and no    officer or seaman, or other person belonging to, the ship    excepting such as are so appointed, shall trade, or offer to    trade, for any sort of provision, fruit, or other productions of    the earth, unless they have leave so to do. 3. Every person    employed on shore, on any duty whatsoever, is strictly to attend    to the same; and if by any neglect he loseth any of his arms, or    working tools or suffers them to be stolen, the full value    therefore will be charged against his pay, according to the custom    of the navy in such cases, and he shall receive such further    punishment as the nature of the offence may deserve. 4. The same    penalty will be inflicted on every person who is found to    embezzle, trade, or offer to trade, with any part of the ship's    stores of what nature soever. 5. No sort of iron, or any thing    that is made of iron, or any sort of cloth, or other useful or    necessary articles, are to be given in exchange for any thing but    provision. J. COOK.']    One of the first things that occupied the lieutenant's attention,  after his arrival at Otaheite, was to prepare for the execution of his  grand commission. For this purpose, as, in an excursion to the  westward, he had not found any more convenient harbour than that in  which the Endeavour lay, he determined to go on shore and fix upon  some spot, commanded by the guns of the ship, where he might throw up  a small fort for defence, and get every thing ready for making the  astronomical observations. Accordingly, he took a party of men, and  landed, being accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Mr. Green.  They soon fixed upon a place very proper for their design, and which  was at a considerable distance from any habitation of the natives.  While the gentlemen were marking out the ground which they intended to  occupy, and seeing a small tent erected, that belonged to Mr. Banks, a  great number of the people of the country gathered gradually around  them, but with no hostile appearance, as there was not among the  Indians a single weapon of any kind. Mr. Cook, however, intimated that  none of them were to come within the line he had drawn excepting one,  who appeared to be a chief, and Owhaw, a native who had attached  himself to the English, both in Captain Wallis's expedition and in the  present voyage. The lieutenant endeavoured to make these two persons  understand, that the ground, which had been marked out, was only  wanted to sleep upon for a certain number of nights, and that then it  would be quitted. Whether his meaning was comprehended or not, he  could not certainly determine; but the people behaved with a deference  and respect that could scarcely have been expected, and which were  highly pleasing. They sat down without the circle, peaceably and  uninterruptedly attending to the progress of the business, which was  upwards of two hours in completing.    This matter being finished, and Mr. Cook having appointed thirteen  marines and a petty officer to guard the tent, he and the gentlemen  with him set out upon a little excursion into the woods of the  country. They had not, however, gone far, before they were brought  back by a very disagreeable event. One of the Indians, who remained  about the tent after the lieutenant and his friends had left it,  watched an opportunity of taking the sentry at unawares, and snatched  away his musket. Upon this, the petty officer who commanded the party,  and who was a midshipman, ordered the marines to fire. With equal want  of consideration, and, perhaps with equal inhumanity, the men  immediately discharged their pieces among the thickest of the flying  crowd, who consisted of more than a hundred. It being observed, that  the thief did not fall, he was pursued, and shot dead. From subsequent  information it happily appeared, that none of the natives besides were  either killed or wounded.    Lieutenant Cook, who was highly displeased with the conduct of the  petty officer, used every method in his power to dispel the terrors  and apprehensions of the Indians, but not immediately with effect. The  next morning but few of the inhabitants were seen upon the beach, and  not one of them came off to the shill. What added particularly to the  regret of the English was, that even Owhaw, who had hitherto been so  constant in his attachment, and who the day before had been remarkably  active in endeavouring to renew the peace which had been broken, did  not now make his appearance. In the evening, however, when the  lieutenant went on shore with only a boat's crew and some of the  gentlemen, between thirty and forty of the natives gathered around  them, and trafficked with them, in a friendly manner, for cocoa nuts  and other fruit.    On the 17th, Mr. Cook and Mr. Green set up a tent onshore, and spent  the night there, in order to observe an eclipse of the first satellite  of Jupiter; but they met with a disappointment, in consequence of the  weather's becoming cloudy. The next day, the lieutenant, with as many  of his people as could possibly be spared from the ship, began to  erect the fort. While the English were employed in this business, many  of the Indians were so far from hindering, that they voluntarily  assisted them, and with great alacrity brought the pickets and facines  from the wood where they had been cut. Indeed, so scrupulous had Mr.  Cook been of invading their property, that every stake which was used  was purchased, and not a tree was cut down till their consent had  first been obtained.    On the 26th, the lieutenant mounted six swivel guns upon the fort; on  which occasion he saw, with concern, that the natives were alarmed and  terrified. Some fishermen, who lived upon the point, removed to a  greater distance; and Owhaw informed the English by signs, of his  expectation that in four days they would fire their great guns.    The lieutenant, on the succeeding day, gave a striking proof of his  regard to justice, and of his care to preserve the inhabitants from  injury and violence, by the punishment he inflicted on the butcher of  the Endeavour, who was accused of having threatened, or attempted the  life of a woman, that was the wife of Tubourai Tamaide, a chief,  remarkable for his attachment to our navigators. The butcher wanted to  purchase of her a stone hatchet for a nail. To this bargain she  absolutely refused to accede; upon which the fellow catched up the  hatchet, and threw down the nail; threatening, at the same time, that  if she made any resistance, he would cut her throat with a  reaping-hook which he had in his hand. The charge was so fully proved  in the presence of Mr. Banks, and the butcher had so little to say in  exculpation of himself, that not the least doubt remained of his  guilt. The affair being reported by Mr. Banks to Lieutenant Cook, he  took an opportunity, when the chief and his women, with others of the  natives, were on board the ship, to call up the offender, and, after  recapitulating the accusation and the proof of it, to give orders for  his immediate punishment. While the butcher was stripped, and tied up  to the rigging, the Indians preserved a fixed attention, and waited  for the event in silent suspense. But as soon as the first stroke was  inflicted, such was the humanity of these people, that they interfered  with great agitation, and earnestly entreated that the rest of the  punishment might be"]]]
