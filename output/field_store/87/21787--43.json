Georgie (he was Georgie or Mr Georgie, never Pillson to the whole of  Riseholme) was not an obtrusively masculine sort of person. Such  masculinity as he was possessed of was boyish rather than adult, and  the most important ingredients in his nature were womanish. He had, in  common with the rest of Riseholme, strong artistic tastes, and in  addition to playing the piano, made charming little water-colour  sketches, many of which he framed at his own expense and gave to  friends, with slightly sentimental titles, neatly printed in gilt  letters on the mount. \"Golden Autumn Woodland,\" \"Bleak December,\"  \"Yellow Daffodils,\" \"Roses of Summer\" were perhaps his most notable  series, and these he had given to Lucia, on the occasion of four  successive birthdays. He did portraits as well in pastel; these were of  two types, elderly ladies in lace caps with a row of pearls, and boys  in cricket shirts with their sleeves rolled up. He was not very good at  eyes, so his sitters always were looking down, but he was excellent at  smiles, and the old ladies smiled patiently and sweetly, and the boys  gaily. But his finest accomplishment was needlework and his house was  full of the creations of his needle, wool-work curtains, petit-point  chair seats, and silk embroideries framed and glazed. Next to Lucia he  was the hardest worked inhabitant of Riseholme but not being so strong  as the Queen, he had often to go away for little rests by the sea-side.  Travelling by train fussed him a good deal, for he might not be able to  get a corner seat, or somebody with a pipe or a baby might get into his  carriage, or the porter might be rough with his luggage, so he always  went in his car to some neighbouring watering-place where they knew  him. Dicky, his handsome young chauffeur, drove him, and by Dicky's  side sat Foljambe, his very pretty parlour-maid who valetted him. If  Dicky took the wrong turn his master called \"Naughty boy\" through the  tube, and Foljambe smiled respectfully. For the month of August, his  two plain strapping sisters (Hermione and Ursula alas!) always came to  stay with him. They liked pigs and dogs and otter-hunting and  mutton-chops, and were rather a discordant element in Riseholme. But  Georgie had a kind heart, and never even debated whether he should ask  Hermy and Ursy or not, though he had to do a great deal of tidying up  after they had gone.    There was always a playful touch between the meetings of these two when  either of them had been away from Riseholme that very prettily  concealed the depth of Georgie's supposed devotion, and when she came  out into the garden where her Cavalier and her husband were waiting for  their tea under the pergola, Georgie jumped up very nimbly and took a  few chassee-ing steps towards her with both hands outstretched in  welcome. She caught at his humour, made him a curtsey, and next moment  they were treading a little improvised minuet together with hands held  high, and pointed toes. Georgie had very small feet, and it was a  really elegant toe that he pointed, encased in cloth-topped boots. He  had on a suit of fresh white flannels and over his shoulders, for fear  of the evening air being chilly after this hot day, he had a little  cape of a military cut, like those in which young ladies at music-halls  enact the part of colonels. He had a straw-hat on, with a blue riband,  a pink shirt and a red tie, rather loose and billowy. His face was pink  and round, with blue eyes, a short nose and very red lips. An almost  complete absence of eyebrow was made up for by a firm little brown  moustache clipped very short, and brushed upwards at its extremities.  Contrary to expectation he was quite tall and fitted very neatly into  his clothes.    The dance came to an end with a low curtsey on Lucia's part, an  obeisance hat in hand from Georgie (this exposure shewing a crop of  hair grown on one side of his head and brushed smoothly over the top  until it joined the hair on the other side) and a clapping of the hands  from Peppino.    \"Bravo, bravo,\" he cried from the tea-table. \"Capital!\"    Mrs Lucas blew him a kiss in acknowledgment of this compliment and  smiled on her partner. \"_Amico!_\" she said. \"It is nice to see you  again. How goes it?\"    \"_Va bene_,\" said Georgie to show he could talk Italian too.  \"_Va_ very _bene_ now that you've come back.\"    \"_Grazie!_ Now tell us all the news. We'll have a good gossip.\"    Georgie's face beamed with a \"solemn gladness\" at the word, like a  drunkard's when brandy is mentioned.    \"Where shall we begin?\" he said. \"Such a lot to tell you. I think we  must begin with a great bit of news. Something really mysterious.\"    Lucia smiled inwardly. She felt that she knew for dead certain what the  mysterious news was, and also that she knew far more about it than  Georgie. This superiority she completely concealed. Nobody could have  guessed it.    \"_Presto, presto!_\" she said. \"You excite me.\"    \"Yesterday morning I was in Rush's,\" said Georgie, \"seeing about some  _Creme de menthe_, which ought to have been sent the day before.  Rush is very negligent sometimes--and I was just saying a sharp word  about it, when suddenly I saw that Rush was not attending at all, but  was looking at something behind my back, and so I looked round. Guess!\"    \"Don't be tantalising, _amico_,\" said she. \"How can I guess? A  pink elephant with blue spots!\"    \"No, guess again!\"    \"A red Indian in full war paint.\"    \"Certainly not! Guess again,\" said Georgie, with a little sigh of  relief. (It would have been awful if she had guessed.) At this moment  Peppino suddenly became aware that Lucia had guessed and was up to some  game.    \"Give me your hand, Georgie,\" she said, \"and look at me. I'm going to  read your thoughts. Think of what you saw when you turned round.\"    She took his hand and pressed it to her forehead, closing her eyes.    \"But I do seem to see an Indian,\" she said. \"Ah, not red Indian, other  Indian. And--and he has slippers on and brown stockings--no, not brown  stockings; it's legs. And there's a beard, and a turban.\"    She gave a sigh.    \"That's all I can see,\" she said.    \"My dear, you're marvellous,\" said he. \"You're quite right.\"    A slight bubbling sound came from Peppino, and Georgie began to  suspect.    \"I believe you've seen him!\" he said. \"How tarsome you are....\"    When they had all laughed a great deal, and Georgie had been assured  that Lucia really, word of honour, had no idea what happened next, the  narrative was resumed.    \"So there stood the Indian, bowing and salaaming most politely and when  Rush had promised me he would send my _Creme de menthe_ that very  morning, I just looked through a wine list for a moment, and the Indian  with quantities more bows came up to the counter and said, 'If you will  have the great goodness to give me a little brandy bottle.' So Rush  gave it him, and instead of paying for it, what do you think he said?  Guess.\"    Mrs Lucas rose with the air of Lady Macbeth and pointed her finger at  Georgie.    \"He said 'Put it down to Mrs Quantock's account,'\" she hissed.    Of course the explanation came now, and Lucia told the two men the  contents of Mrs Quantock's letter. With that her cards were on the  table, and though the fact of the Brahmin from Benares was news to  Georgie, he had got many interesting things to tell her, for his house  adjoined Mrs Quantock's and there were plenty of things which Mrs  Quantock had not mentioned in her letter, so that Georgie was soon in  the position of informant again. His windows overlooked Mrs Quantock's  garden, and since he could not keep his eyes shut all day, it followed  that the happenings there were quite common property. Indeed that was a  general rule in Riseholme: anyone in an adjoining property could say,  \"What an exciting game of lawn-tennis you had this afternoon!\" having  followed it from his bedroom. That was part of the charm of Riseholme;  it was as if it contained just one happy family with common interests  and pursuits. What happened in the house was a more private matter, and  Mrs Quantock, for instance, would never look from the rising ground at  the end of her garden into Georgie's dining-room or, if she did she  would never tell anyone how many places were laid at table on that  particular day when she had asked if he could give her lunch, and he  had replied that to his great regret his table was full. But nobody  could help seeing into gardens from back windows: the \"view\" belonged  to everybody.    Georgie had had wonderful views.    \"That very day,\" he said, \"soon after lunch, I was looking for a letter  I thought I had left in my bedroom, and happening to glance out, I saw  the Indian sitting under Mrs Quantock's pear-tree. He was swaying a  little backwards and forwards.\"    \"The brandy!\" said Lucia excitedly. \"He has his meals in his own room.\"    \"No, _amica_, it was not the brandy. In fact I don't suppose the  brandy had gone to Mrs Quantock's then, for he did not take it from  Rush's, but asked that it should be sent....\" He paused a moment--\"Or  did he take it away? I declare I can't remember. But anyhow when he  swayed backwards and forwards, he wasn't drunk, for presently he stood  on one leg, and crooked the other behind it, and remained there with  his hands up, as if he was praying, for quite a long time without  swaying at all. So he couldn't have been tipsy. And then he sat down  again, and took off his slippers, and held his toes with one hand,  while his legs were quite straight out, and put his other hand round  behind his head, and grasped his other ear with it. I tried to do it on  my bedroom floor, but I couldn't get near it. Then he sat up again and  called 'Chela! Chela!' and Mrs Quantock came running out.\"    \"Why did he say 'Chela'?\" asked Lucia.    \"I wondered too. But I knew I had some clue to it,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6841"],[0,"Mosaics of Grecian History (#6)"],[1,"by a people simple in their habits and manners,  noted for their fondness for music and dancing, their hospitality,  and pastoral customs. With the poets Arcadia was a land of peace,  of simple pleasures, and untroubled quiet; and it was natural that  the pipe-playing Pan should first appear here, where musical  shepherds led their flocks along the woody vales of impetuous  streams.    13. Ar'golis, east of Arcadia, was mostly a rocky peninsula lying  between the Saron'ic and Argol'ic gulfs. It was in great part a  barren region, with the exception of the plain adjoining its  capital city, Argos, and in early times was divided into a number  of small but independent kingdoms, that afterward became republics.  The whole region is rich in historic associations of the Heroic  Age. Here was Tir'yns, whose massive walls were built by the  one-eyed Cy'clops, and whence Hercules departed at the commencement  of his twelve labors. Here, also, was the Lernae'an Lake, where  the hero slew the many-headed hydra; Ne'mea, the haunt of the  lion slain by Hercules, and the seat of the celebrated Ne'mean  games; and Myce'nae, the royal city of Agamemnon, who commanded  the Greeks in the Trojan War--now known, only by its ruins and  its legends of by-gone ages.      And still have legends marked the lonely spot      Where low the dust of Agamemnon lies;    And shades of kings and leaders unforgot,      Hovering around, to fancy's vision rise.      --HEMANS.    14. At the south-eastern extremity of the Peloponnesus was Laconia,  the fertile portions of which consisted mostly of a long, narrow  valley, shut in on three sides by the mountain ranges of Ta-yg'etus  on the west and Parnon on the north and east, and open only on  the south to the sea. Through this valley flows the river Euro'tas,  on whose banks, about twenty miles from the sea, stood the capital  city, Lacedae'mon, or Sparta, which was unwalled and unfortified  during its most flourishing period, as the Spartans held that the  real defence of a town consists solely in the valor of its citizens.  The sea-coast of Laconia was lined with towns, and furnished with  numerous ports and commodious harbors. While Sparta was equaled  by few other Greek cities in the magnificence of its temples and  statues, the private houses, and even the palace of the king,  were always simple and unadorned.    15. West of Laconia was Messe'nia, the south-western division of  Greece, a mountainous country, but with many fertile intervening  valleys, the whole renowned for the mildness and salubrity of  its climate. Its principal river, the Pami'sus, rising in the  mountains of Arcadia, flows southward to the Messenian Gulf through  a beautiful plain, the lower portion of which was so celebrated  for its fertility that it was called Maca'ria, or \"the blessed;\"  and even to this day it is covered with plantations of the vine,  the fig, and the mulberry, and is \"as rich in cultivation as can  be well imagined.\"    16. One district more--that of E'lis, north of Messenia and west  of Arcadia, and embracing the western slopes of the Achaian and  Arcadian mountains--makes up the complement of the ancient  Peloponnesian states. Though hilly and mountainous, like Messenia,  it had many valleys and hill-sides of great fertility. The river  Alphe'us, which the poets have made the most celebrated of the  rivers of Greece, flows westward through Elis to the Ionian Sea,  and on its banks was Olympia, the renowned seat of the Olympian  games. Here, also, was the sacred grove of olive and plane trees,  within which were temples, monuments, and statues, erected in  honor of gods, heroes, and conquerors. In the very midst stood  the great temple of Jupiter, which contained the colossal gold  and ivory statue of the god, the masterpiece of the sculptor  Phidias. Hence, by the common law of Greece Elis was deemed a  sacred territory, and its cities were unwalled, as they were  thought to be sufficiently protected by the sanctity of the  country; and it was only when the ancient faith began to give  way that the sacred character of Elis was disregarded.    17. The Isles of Greece.--      The Isles of Greece! the Isles of Greece!      Where burning Sappho loved and sung--    Where grew the arts of war and peace,      Where Delos rose and Phoebus sprung!    Eternal summer gilds them yet,    But all except their sun is set.      --BYRON.    The main-land of Greece was deeply indented by gulfs and almost  land-locked bays, and the shores were lined with numerous islands,  which were occupied by the Grecian race. Beginning our survey of  these in the northern AEge'an, we find, off the coast of Thessaly,  the Island of Lemnos, which is fabled as the spot on which the  fire-god Vulcan--the Lucifer of heathen mythology--fell, after  being hurled down from Olympus. Under a volcano of the island be  established his workshop, and there forged the thunder-bolts of  Jupiter and the arms of the gods and of godlike heroes.    Of the Grecian islands proper, the largest is Euboe'a, a long  and narrow island lying east of Central Greece, from which it  is separated by the narrow channel of the Euri'pus, or Euboe'an  Sea. South-east of Euboea are the Cyc'la-des, [Footnote: From  the Greek word kuklos, a circle.] a large group that kept guard  around the sacred Island of Delos, which is said to have risen  unexpectedly out of the sea. The Spor'a-des [Footnote: From the  Greek word speiro, to sow; scattered, like seed, so numerous were  they. Hence our word spore.] were another group, scattered over  the sea farther east, toward the coast of Asia Minor. The large  islands of Crete and Rhodes were south-east of these groups. In  the Saron'ic Gulf, between Attica and Ar'golis, were the islands  of Sal'amis and AEgi'na, the former the scene of the great naval  conflict between the Greeks on the one side and the Persians,  under Xerxes, on the other, and the latter long the maritime rival  of Athens.    Cyth'era, now Cer'igo, an island of great importance to the  Spartans, was separated by a narrow channel from the southern  extremity of Laconia. It was on the coast of this island that  the goddess Venus is fabled to have first appeared to mortals  as she arose out of the foam of the sea, having a beautifully  enameled shell for her chariot, drawn by dolphins, as some paintings  represent; but others picture her as borne on a shining seahorse.  She was first called Cyth-er-e'a, from the name of the island.  The nymphs of ocean, of the land, and the streams, the fishes  and monsters of the deep, and the birds of heaven, with rapturous  delight greeted her coming, and did homage to the beauty of the  Queen of Love. The following fine description of the scene, truly  Grecian in spirit, is by a modern poet:      Uprisen from the sea when Cytherea,    Shining in primal beauty, paled the day,    The wondering waters hushed, They yearned in sighs    That shook the world--tumultuously heaved    To a great throne of azure laced with light    And canopied in foam to grace their queen.    Shrieking for joy came O-ce-an'i-des,    And swift Ner-e'i-des rushed from afar,    Or clove the waters by. Came eager-eyed    Even shy Na-i'a-des from inland streams,    With wild cries headlong darting through the waves;    And Dryads from the shore stretched their long arms,    While, hoarsely sounding, heard was Triton's shell;    Shoutings uncouth, bewildered sounds,    And innumerable splashing feet    Of monsters gambolling around their god,    Forth shining on a sea-horse, fierce and finned.    Some bestrode fishes glinting dusky gold,    Or angry crimson, or chill silver bright;    Others jerked fast on their own scanty tails;    And sea-birds, screaming upward either side,    Wove a vast arch above the Queen of Love,    Who, gazing on this multitudinous    Homaging to her beauty, laughed. She laughed    The soft, delicious laughter that makes mad;    Low warblings in the throat, that clinch man's life    Tighter than prison bars.      --THOMAS WOOLNER.    Off the coast of Elis were the two small islands called the  Stroph'a-des, noted as the place of habitation of those fabled  winged monsters, the Harpies. Here AEne'as landed in his flight  from the ruins of Troy, but no pleasant greetings met him there.      \"At length I land upon the Strophades,    Safe from the dangers of the stormy seas.    Those isles are compassed by th' Ionian main,    The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign:    Monsters more fierce offended Heaven ne'er sent    From hell's abyss for human punishment.    We spread the tables on the greensward ground;    We feed with hunger, and the bowls go round;    When from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry    And clattering wings, the hungry Harpies fly:    They snatch the meat, defiling all they find,    And, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind.\"      --VIRGIL'S AEneid, B. III.    North of the Strophades, along the western coast of Greece, were  the six Ionian islands known in Grecian history as Paxos,  Zacyn'thus, Cephalo'nia, Ith'aca (the native island of Ulysses),  Leu'cas (or Leuca'dia), and Corcy'ra (now Corfu), which latter  island Homer calls Phaea'cia, and where he places the fabled gardens  of Alcin'o-us. It was King Alcinous who kindly entertained Ulysses  in his island home when the latter was shipwrecked on his coast.  He is highly praised in Grecian legends for his love of agriculture;  and his gardens, so beautifully described by Homer, have afforded  a favorite theme for poets of succeeding ages. HOMER'S description  is as follows:      Close to the gates a spacious garden lies,    From storms defended and inclement skies;    Four acres was the allotted space of ground,    Fenced with a green enclosure all around;    Tall thriving trees confessed the fruitful mould,    And reddening apples ripen here to gold.    Here the blue fig with luscious juice o'erflows;    With deeper red the full pomegranate"]]]
