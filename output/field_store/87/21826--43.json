It is round and inaccessible on all sides. The above mentioned  island I called Rodondo from its resemblance to that rock well-known to  all seamen in the West Indies. A set of breakers to the southward and  eastward of that rock, on which, though calm, the sea breaks much, bears  from us north-north-west 1/2 west distant 6 miles.    To the eastward there are five islands, the largest of which from its  resemblance to the Lion's Mount at the Cape of Good Hope I called Sir  Roger Curtis's Island, who then commanded on that Station. It is high and  inaccessible on the north-west side and covered with small bushes at the  top. Two other islands like haycocks, only higher and more perpendicular,  standing a considerable distance from each other, the largest of which  bore us south-east 1/4 south distant 16 or 17 miles and the other  south-east by east about 10 miles. The latter is nearly shut in with the  south-east end of Sir Roger Curtis's Island. The fourth is a rock  standing a considerable height out of the water nearly in a position  between the two haycocks or rather sugarloaf-like islands bearing from  south-east 1/4 south. The fifth is a high perpendicular barren cliff  which, as we get almost abreast, looked like two islands joined together  at the bottom, rising to a sharp edge ragged at the top and resembling a  large tower or castle. This island I named The Devil's Tower. An island  inshore was observed, it bore west-north-west distant 10 miles: I called  it Moncur's Island in compliment to Captain Moncur of the Royal Navy, and  another was visible bearing north by east 16 or 17 miles.    Land, apparently an island to the southward and eastward we can just see  from the masthead. It may be necessary to observe that these bearings  were taken at noon, and as it was then a stark calm the vessel was nearly  stationary. By a good observation the latitude was 39 degrees 30 minutes,  longitude 147 degrees 18 minutes east, calculated from lunar observation  2 days before. But I take it to be correctly 147 degrees east from my  making the Ramhead according to the best charts, therefore the bearings  are laid down in my chart from 147 degrees east.    \"Wilson's Promontory was so named by Mr. George Bass of H.M.S. Reliance  who was the first navigator that ascertained the real existence of a  strait separating Van Dieman's Land from New Holland in his voyage in a  whale boat from Sydney to Western Port.* (* \"Mr. Bass places Wilson's  Promontory in 38 degrees 56 minutes south, Lieutenant Grant in 39 degrees  17 minutes, and Mr. Black in 39 degrees 8 minutes. As Mr. Bass's latitude  is by computation from the whale boat, I think a preference may be given  to Lieutenant Grant's position, as he had the advantage of a good  sextant.\" P.G.K.) Having made it I set off in one of my boats early in  the morning of the 10th* (* Grant now abandons the plan previously used  of heading each entry in the diary with the date of the day on which it  was written, and includes the dates of the various events in the text of  his narrative.) to endeavour to land on one of the islands lying off it;  but after a long pull found the one I judged from its sloping aspect to  be the easiest for that purpose, a solid rock for a considerable height  with surf too powerful for such a small boat as mine. After several  fruitless attempts I was obliged to abandon the idea, contenting myself  with taking a view of it--and those contiguous. One of them was an  immense rock; on one side perfectly round, with a large hole in the other  in the form of an arch with a breastwork rising high enough above the  level of the sea to preclude the water from getting into it; the hollow  appeared as scooped out by art instead of nature. I gave it the name of  the Hole in the Wall and to the range of islands stretching along the  main--the name of Glennie's Islands after Mr. George Glennie, a  particular friend of Captain Schanck's to whom I was under personal  obligations. On the summit of all these islands there was a thick brush  growing, whereas the land off Cape Liptrap already mentioned exhibited a  fine level country. The day being far spent in this survey I deemed it  best to get on board as the vessel was just visible with her head towards  us and becalmed. On the 12th we had fresh gales and cloudy weather, the  shore we were running along was low and covered with thick brush training  in a north-east direction which Messieurs Flinders and Bass have given  very accurate descriptions of.\"    Of his coming to Sydney, Grant writes, \"Governor King had taken the  precaution of leaving a letter for me at the Cape, describing the  particular marks for knowing the entrance of the Port, which no doubt  saved us much trouble. They consisted of a flagstaff erected on the South  Head or left hand side of the entrance, and when vessels are seen the  flag is hoisted. This land being high may be seen at a considerable  distance on a clear day. In the afternoon of the 16th saw the flagstaff  as described by Governor King. At six in the evening we entered between  the Heads of Port Jackson. We found much swell in going in but were soon  in smooth water and an excellent harbour, perhaps one of the finest in  the known world. As the wind was from the south and contrary to getting  into Sydney Cove we were obliged to beat up to it, and at half-past seven  in the evening (on Tuesday December 16th) we let go our anchors in 8  fathoms water after a voyage of 71 days from the Cape of Good Hope, and  with the satisfaction of being the first vessel that ever pursued the  same track across that vast ocean, as we have no traces of its being done  particularly from the Island of Amsterdam, namely; between the degrees of  latitude 38 and 39 1/2 degrees south until the Lady Nelson made the coast  of New Holland in latitude 38 degrees and steering to the eastward along  a tract of land nearly four degrees to the westward of any seen by  Messieurs Flinders and Bass.\"    Following the example of many a first discoverer, he ends the account of  his voyage with an expression of thankfulness to God for the protection  shown him \"during the whole passage.\"    The Lady Nelson's arrival at Sydney gave great satisfaction to the  colony, and Colonel Collins remarks that a few such vessels were much  needed there in order to obtain a necessary knowledge of the coast.  Governor King naturally was most interested in Grant's description of his  passage through Bass Strait, and the news that the Lady Nelson had passed  deep indentations with beautifully wooded shores and rocky islands lying  off them pleased everybody. But King did not conceal his disappointment  that her commander had been unable to land anywhere or to penetrate the  deep bay called Governor King's Bay. The Admiralty had instructed the  Governor to have the whole of the south coast properly charted, and he  determined that Grant should return in the Lady Nelson and thoroughly  survey it. King also made an eye-sketch of the land, for he saw that  Grant's chart was imperfect. For that reason he sent Ensign Barrallier,  of the New South Wales Corps, who was a competent surveyor, in the brig,  and it is, chiefly, to Barrallier we are indebted for our earliest and  most authentic charts of the places which the Lady Nelson visited in the  second voyage.    Grant, however, had to contend with many difficulties in both voyages.  First and foremost he had to face the risk and dangers of an entirely new  coast, and this without a companion ship. King was aware of this for he  wrote to Banks: \"It is my intention to despatch the Lady Nelson to  complete the orders she first sailed with. I also hope to spare a vessel  to go with her which will make up for a very great defect which is the  utter impossibility of her ever being able to beat off a lee shore.\" It  is, therefore, well to remember that although Grant did not enter Port  Phillip he was the first to see the indentation in the coast within which  Port Phillip lay hidden.    Grant had been instructed by the Admiralty to join H.M.S. Supply at  Sydney. On his arrival he found this ship laid up as a hulk and unfit for  sea. He says that he felt completely adrift until Governor King invited  him to continue in his position as commander of the Lady Nelson but, in  the colonial service and on less pay. As there was no one in the colony  then fitted for the post, and as he did not wish the service to suffer  from delay, he accepted the offer. Matters being thus arranged he was  re-appointed to the Lady Nelson, his new commission dating from January  1st, 1801.    On January 11th Captain Black, from the Cape, arrived in Sydney in the  Harbinger, having followed the Lady Nelson through Bass Strait. On his  way through the strait Black met with an island which he named King  Island in honour of the Governor. Mr. Reid, of the Martha, however, had  first discovered it in 1799.    The Margaret, Captain Buyers, from England, was the third vessel to sail  through Bass Strait, arriving in Sydney on February 7th, 1801. Buyers  fell in with the Australian coast about Cape Bridgewater eastward of  where the Lady Nelson had made it and westward of the point reached by  the Harbinger.    Governor King allowed Grant the use of Garden Island in Sydney Harbour  for the purpose of raising vegetables for his crew, an article of diet of  importance to them; and here in \"the shell of a tolerable house\" was  installed Dr. Brandt, who, with his dog and baboon, had joined the Lady  Nelson at the Cape of Good Hope.    The chart (Illustration 2.) is a copy of one published in the narrative  of Grant's voyage, and his autograph has been reproduced from a logbook  at the Record Office.

By things indifferent were meant such as did not necessarily  contribute to virtue, for instance health, wealth, strength, and  honor. It is possible to have all these and not be virtuous, it is  possible also to be virtuous without them. But we have now to learn  that though these things are neither good nor evil, and are therefore  not matter for choice or avoidance, they are far from being  indifferent in the sense of arousing neither impulse nor repulsion.  There are things indeed that are indifferent in the latter sense,  such as whether you put out your finger this way or that, whether you  stoop to pick up a straw or not, whether the number of hairs on your  head be odd or even. But things of this sort are exceptional. The  bulk of things other than virtue and vice do arouse in us either  impulse or repulsion. Let it be understood then that there are two  senses of the word indifferent--       (1) neither good nor bad     (2) neither awaking impulse nor repulsion    Among things indifferent in the former sense, some were in accordance  with nature, some were contrary to nature and some were neither one  nor the other. Health, strengths and soundness of the senses were in  accordance with nature; sickness weakness and mutilation were  contrary to nature, but such things as the fallibility of the soul  and the vulnerability of the body were neither in accordance with  nature nor yet contrary to nature, but just nature.    All things that were in accordance with nature had 'value' and all  things that were contrary to nature had what we must call 'disvalue'.  In the highest sense indeed of the term 'value'--namely that of  absolute value or worth--things indifferent did not possess any value  at all. But still there might be assigned to them what Antipater  expressed by the term 'a selective value' or what he expressed by its  barbarous privative, 'a disselective disvalue'. If a thing possessed  a selective value you took that thing rather than its contrary,  supposing that circumstances allowed, for instance, health rather  than sickness, wealth rather than poverty, life rather than death.  Hence such things were called takeable and their contraries  untakeable. Things that possessed a high degree of value were called  preferred, those that possessed a high degree of disvalue were called  rejected. Such as possessed no considerable degree of either were  neither preferred nor rejected. Zeno, with whom these names  originated, justified their use about things really indifferent on  the ground that at court \"preferment\" could not be bestowed upon the  king himself, but only on his ministers.    Things preferred and rejected might belong to mind, body or estate.  Among things preferred in the case of the mind were natural ability,  art, moral progress, and the like, while their contraries were  rejected. In the case of the body, life, health, strength, good  condition, completeness, and beauty were preferred, while death,  sickness, weakness, ill condition, mutilation and ugliness were  rejected. Among things external to soul and body, wealth, reputation,  and nobility were preferred, while poverty, ill repute, and baseness  of birth were rejected.    In this way all mundane and marketable goods, after having been  solemnly refused admittance by the Stoics at the front door, were  smuggled in at a kind of tradesman's entrance under the name of  things indifferent. We must now see how they had, as it were, two  moral codes, one for the sage and the other for the world in general.    The sage alone could act rightly, but other people might perform \"the  proprieties.\" Any one might honor his parents, but the sage alone did  it as the outcome of wisdom, because he alone possessed the art of  life, the peculiar work of which was to do everything that was done  as the result of the best disposition. All the acts of the sage were  \"perfect proprieties,\" which were called \"rightnesses.\" All acts of  all other men were sins or \"wrongnesses.\" At their best they could  only be \"intermediate proprieties.\" The term \"propriety,\" then, is a  generic one. But, as often happens, the generic term got determined  in use to a specific meaning, so that intermediate acts are commonly  spoken of as \"proprieties\" in opposition to \"rightnesses.\" Instances  of \"rightnesses\" are displaying wisdom and dealing justly, instances  of proprieties or intermediate acts are marrying, going on an  embassy, and dialectic.    The word \"duty\" is often employed to translate the Greek term which  we are rendering by \"propriety.\" Any translation is no more than a  choice of evils, since we have no real equivalent for the term. It  was applicable not merely to human conduct, but also to the acting of  the lower animals, and even to the growth of plants. Now, apart from  a craze of generalization we should hardly think of the \"stern  daughter of the voice of God\" in connection with an amoeba  corresponding successfully to stimulus, yet the creature in its  inchoate way is exhibiting a dim analogy to duty. The term in  question was first used by Zeno, and was explained by him, in  accordance with its etymology, to mean what it came to one to do, so  that as far as this goes, 'becomingness' would be the most  appropriate translation.    The sphere of propriety was confined to things indifferent, so that  there were proprieties which were common to the sage and the fool. It  had to do with taking the things which were in accordance with nature  and rejecting those that were not. Even the propriety of living or  dying was determined, not by reference to virtue or vice, but to the  preponderance or deficiency of things in accordance with nature. It  might thus be a propriety for the sage in spite of his happiness, to  depart from life of his own accord, and for the fool notwithstanding  his misery, to remain in it. Life, being in itself indifferent, the  whole question was one of opportunism. Wisdom might prompt the  leaving herself should occasion seem to call for it.    We pass on now another instance of accommodation. According to the  high Stoic doctrine, there was no mean between virtue and vice. All  men indeed received from nature the starting-points for virtue, but  until perfection had been attained they rested under the condemnation  of vice. It was, to employ an illustration of the poet-philosopher  Cleanthes, as though Nature had begun an iambic line and left men to  finish it. Until that was done they were to wear the fool's cap. The  Peripatetics, on the other hand, recognized an intermediate state  between virtue and vice, to which they gave the name of progress and  proficience. Yet so entirely had the Stoics, for practical purposes,  to accept this lower level, that the word \"proficience\" has come to  be spoken of as though it were of Stoic origin.    Seneca is fond of contrasting the sage with the proficient. The sage  is like a man in the enjoyment of perfect health. But the proficient  is like a man recovering from a severe illness, with whom an  abatement of the paroxysm is equivalent to health, and who is always  in danger of a relapse. It is the business of philosophy to provide  for the needs of these weaker brethren. The proficient is still  called a fool, but it is pointed out that he is a very different kind  of fool from the rest. Further, proficients are arranged into three  classes, in a way that reminds one of the technicalities of  Calvinistic theology. First of all, there are those who are near  wisdom, but, however near they may be to the door of Heaven, they are  still on the wrong side of it. According to some doctors, these were  already safe from backsliding, differing from the sage only in not  having yet realized that they had attained to knowledge; other  authorities, however, refused to admit this, and regarded the first  class as being exempt only from settled diseases of the soul, but not  from passing attacks of passion. Thus did the Stoics differ among  themselves as to the doctrine of \"final assurance\". The second class  consisted of those who had laid aside the worst diseases and passions  of the soul, but might at any moment relapse into them. The third  class was of those who had escaped one mental malady but not another;  who had conquered lust, let us say, but not ambition; who disregarded  death, but dreaded pain, This third class, adds Seneca, is by no  means to be despised.    From these concessions to the weakness of humanity we now pass to the  Stoic paradoxes, where we shall see their doctrine in its full rigor.  It is perhaps these very paradoxes which account for the puzzled  fascination with which Stoicism affected the mind of antiquity, just  as obscurity in a poet may prove a surer passport to fame than more  strictly poetical merits.    The root of Stoicism being a paradox, it is not surprising that the  offshoots should be so too. To say that \"Virtue is the highest good\"  is a proposition to which every one who aspires to the spiritual life  must yield assent with his lips, even if he has not yet learned to  believe it in his heart. But alter it into \"Virtue is the only good\"  and by that slight change it becomes at once the teeming mother of  paradoxes. By a paradox is meant that which runs counter to general  opinion. Now it is quite certain that men have regarded, do regard,  and, we may safely add will regard things as good which are not  virtue. But if we grant this initial paradox, a great many others  will follow along with it--as for instance that \"Virtue is sufficient  of itself for happiness\". The fifth book of Cicero's _Tusculan  Disputations_ is an eloquent defense of this thesis, in which the  orator combats the suggestion that a good man is not happy when he is  being broken on the wheel.    Another glaring paradox of the Stoics is that \"All faults are equal\".  They took their stand upon a mathematical conception of rectitude. An  angle must be"]]]
