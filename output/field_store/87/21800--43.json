I thought to myself this is a very poor family,  but I will do the best I can to relieve them. While I was preparing the  food for the sick child, I heard the oldest boy (who was about fourteen),  say: \"You shall have the biggest piece now, because I had the biggest  piece before.\" I turned around to see who it was that manifested such a  principle of justice, and I saw four or five children sitting in the  corner, where the oldest was dividing a roasted potato among them. And  he said to one: \"You shall have the biggest piece now,\" etc. But the  other said: \"Why, brother, you are the oldest, and you ought to have the  biggest piece.\"    \"No,\" said the other, \"I had the biggest piece.\"    I turned to the mother, and said: \"Madam, you have potatoes to eat, I  suppose?\"    She replied, \"We have had, but this is the last one we have left; and  the children have now roasted that for their breakfast.\"    On hearing this, I hastened home, and informed my wife that food was  needed for the sick family. I then prescribed a gallon of milk, two  loaves of bread, some butter, meat and potatoes, and sent my boy with  these; and had the pleasure to hear in a few days that they were all well.    --Selected.        ONLY ONE VOTE    A local option contest was going on in W--, and Mrs. Kent was trying to  influence her husband to vote \"No License.\" Willie Kent, six years old,  was, of course on his mamma's side. The night before election Mr. Kent  went to see Willie safe in bed, and hushing his prattle, he said: \"Now,  Willie, say your prayers.\"    \"Papa, I want to say my own words, tonight,\" he replied. \"All right, my  boy, that is the best kind of praying,\" answered the father.    Fair was the picture, as Willie, robed in white, knelt at his father's  knee and prayed reverently: \"O dear Jesus, do help papa to vote No Whiskey  tomorrow. Amen.\"    Morning came, the village was alive with excitement. Women's hands, made  hard by toil, were stretched to God for help in the decision.    The day grew late and yet Mr. Kent had not been to the polls. Willie's  prayer sounded in his ears, and troubled conscience said: \"Answer your  boy's petition with your ballot.\"    At last he stood at the polling place with two tickets in his hand--  one, license; the other, \"No License.\" Sophistry, policy, avarice said:  \"Vote License.\" Conscience echoed: \"No License.\" After a moment's  hesitation, he threw from him the No License ticket and put the License  in the box.    The next day it was found that the contest was so close that it needed  but one vote to carry the town for prohibition. In the afternoon, Willie  found a No License ticket, and, having heard only one vote was necessary,  he started out to find the man who would cast this one ballot against  wrong, and in his eagerness he flew along the streets.    The saloon men were having a jubilee, and the highways were filled with  drunken rowdies. Little Willie rushed on through the unsafe crowd.    [Illustration]    Hark! a random pistol-shot from a drunken quarrel, a pierced heart, and  sweet Willie Kent had his death wound--    They carried him home to his mother. His father was summoned, and the  first swift thought that came to him, as he stood over the lifeless boy,  was: \"Willie will never pray again that I vote No Whiskey.\"    With a strange still grief he took in his own the quiet little hand  chilling into marble coldness, and there between the fingers, firmly  clasped, was the No License ballot with which the brave little soul  thought to change the verdict of yesterday.    Mr. Kent started back in shame and sorrow. That vote in his hand might  have answered the prayer so lately on his lips now dumb, and perhaps  averted the awful calamity. Fathers, may not the hands of the \"thousands  slain\" make mute appeal to you? Your one vote is what God requires of  you. You are responsible for it being in harmony with His law as if on  it hung the great decision.    --_The Issue_        How a Little Girl Utilized the Telephone    A mother living not very far from the post-office in this city, tired  with watching over a sick baby, came down stairs for a moment the other  day for a few second's rest. She heard the voice of her little,  four-year-old girl in the hall by herself, and, curious to know to whom  she was talking, stopped for a moment at the half-opened door. She saw  that the little thing had pulled a chair in front of the telephone, and  stood upon it, with the piece against the side of her head. The earnestness  of the child showed that she was in no playing mood, and this was the  conversation the mother heard, while the tears stood thick in her eyes;  the little one carrying on both sides, as if she were repeating the  answers:    [Illustration]    \"Hello.\"    \"Well, who's there?\"    \"Is God there?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Is Jesus there?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Tell Jesus I want to speak to him.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Is that you, Jesus?\"    \"Yes. What is it?\"    \"Our baby is sick, and we want you to let it get well. Won't you, now?\"  No answer, and statement and question again repeated, and finally answered  by a \"Yes.\"    The little one put the ear-piece back on its hook, clambered down from  the chair, and with a radiant face, went for her mother, who caught her  in her arms.    The baby whose life had been despaired of, began to mend that day and  got well.    --_Elmira Free Press_        Jesus Answers Ruth's Prayer    I went to sit up all night with a very sick neighbor. I took Ruth, my  little five-year-old girl along. When I started to leave the next morning,  the folks told me to leave Ruth there and they would send her home when  she awakened. Being very busy, they forgot about the child for some time,  and she got up and started home by herself. She started up the fence  which she thought led home, but she took the wrong fence and it led out  into a large pasture where there were deep canyons, bad cattle, wolves,  and other dangers.    The neighbors missed Ruth and sent their son to find out if Ruth had got  home all right. Her parents became alarmed when they were told that she  had left two hours before. Her father started out to find his precious  child, asking God to direct him to her. After going some distance, he  heard someone talking. He stopped and listened. His heart was so glad,  for he knew it was his child. She was kneeling by a post praying. And  this is what he heard her say, \"O sweet Jesus, please send my papa to  find me! I'm not afraid! I know that you wouldn't let nothing hurt your  little girl, but if my papa didn't find me, my mama would cry herself  to death and my papa would almost cry his self to death. So please, sweet  Jesus, send my papa to find me.\"    \"Here I am, Ruth,\" Papa said, as he walked toward her.    \"Oh, Papa, I knew Jesus would send you to find me!\" Ruth said as she  quickly jumped up and ran to her father, throwing her arms around him.    Mother was very happy when she saw father coming with their child, and  thanked God for caring for her.    --Essie Wilson        VERY SICK    \"Mother, Mrs. Oats is very sick!\" Ruth said as she came in the door,  looking very sad. \"Mama, she is sick; she is awful sick. I'm sorry for  her. What shall we do for her? Let's go into the other room and pray and  ask Jesus what he wants me to do.\"    So Mother and her little girl went into the other room and knelt down.  Ruth began to pray and ask Jesus what she should do for Mrs. Oats. And  all of a sudden she jumped up and said, \"Jesus told me what to do. He  told me to go over and lay my hands on her and pray for her, and he would  heal her.\" And without an answer, Ruth, who was just six years old ran  out the door and didn't stop running till she was at Mrs. Oat's bedside.      \"Turn over here, Mrs. Oats,\" Ruth said, as she laid her hand on Mrs.  Oats' shoulder. \"I came over here to pray for you and Jesus is going to  heal you.\"    Mrs. Oats replied, \"Well, pray for me, you blessed little angel; if the  Lord would hear anyone's prayers, he would hear yours.\"    Ruth laid her hands on her and prayed for her and the Lord instantly  healed her. She got up and dressed and came over and told Ruth's mother  what Ruth had done.    --Essie Wilson        THE DYING GIRL'S PRAYER FOR HER DRUNKEN FATHER    A child from a poor family had an intemperate father, who often used to  abuse his wife and children. This child had been to the Sunday School--  had become pious. The physician told the father that his little girl  would die. No! he did not believe it. Yes, she will--she must die in a  few hours. The father hastened to the bedside; would not part with her,  he said.    \"Yes, father, you must part with me; I am going to Jesus. Promise me two  things. One is, that you won't abuse mother any more, and will drink no  more whiskey.\"    He promised in a solemn, steady manner. The little girl's face lighted  up with joy.    \"The other thing is, promise me that you will PRAY,\" said the child.    [Illustration]    \"I cannot pray; don't know how,\" said the poor man.    \"Father, kneel down, please. There, take the words after me. I will pray--  I learned how to pray in Sunday School and God has taught me how to pray,  too; my heart prays, and you must let your heart pray. Now say the words.\"    And she began in her simple language to pray to the Savior of sinners.  After a little he began to repeat after her; as he went on his heart was  interested, and he broke out into an earnest prayer for himself; bewailed  his sins, confessed and promised to forsake them; entered into covenant  with God; light broke out in his darkness; how long he prayed he did not  know; he seemed to have forgotten his child in his prayer. When he came  to himself he raised his head from the bed on which he had rested it;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7028"],[0,"The Clicking of Cuthbert (#6)"],[1," thought very  highly of the idea before he finally went to sleep, and in the morning  the scheme looked just as good to him as it had done overnight.    James was breakfasting next morning, preparatory to going round to  disclose his plan to Peter, when Peter walked in, looking happier than  he had done for days.    \"'Morning,\" said James.    \"'Morning,\" said Peter.    Peter sat down and toyed absently with a slice of bacon.    \"I've got an idea,\" he said.    \"One isn't many,\" said James, bringing his knife down with a jerk-shot  on a fried egg. \"What is your idea?\"    \"Got it last night as I was lying awake. It struck me that, if either  of us was to clear out of this place, the other would have a fair  chance. You know what I mean--with Her. At present we've got each other  stymied. Now, how would it be,\" said Peter, abstractedly spreading  marmalade on his bacon, \"if we were to play an eighteen-hole match, the  loser to leg out of the neighbourhood and stay away long enough to give  the winner the chance to find out exactly how things stood?\"    James started so violently that he struck himself in the left eye with  his fork.    \"That's exactly the idea I got last night, too.\"    \"Then it's a go?\"    \"It's the only thing to do.\"    There was silence for a moment. Both men were thinking. Remember, they  were friends. For years they had shared each other's sorrows, joys, and  golf-balls, and sliced into the same bunkers.    Presently Peter said:    \"I shall miss you.\"    \"What do you mean, miss me?\"    \"When you're gone. Woodhaven won't seem the same place. But of course  you'll soon be able to come back. I sha'n't waste any time proposing.\"    \"Leave me your address,\" said James, \"and I'll send you a wire when you  can return. You won't be offended if I don't ask you to be best man at  the wedding? In the circumstances it might be painful to you.\"    Peter sighed dreamily.    \"We'll have the sitting-room done in blue. Her eyes are blue.\"    \"Remember,\" said James, \"there will always be a knife and fork for you  at our little nest. Grace is not the woman to want me to drop my  bachelor friends.\"    \"Touching this match,\" said Peter. \"Strict Royal and Ancient rules, of  course?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"I mean to say--no offence, old man--but no grounding niblicks in  bunkers.\"    \"Precisely. And, without hinting at anything personal, the ball shall  be considered holed-out only when it is in the hole, not when it stops  on the edge.\"    \"Undoubtedly. And--you know I don't want to hurt your feelings--missing  the ball counts as a stroke, not as a practice-swing.\"    \"Exactly. And--you'll forgive me if I mention it--a player whose ball  has fallen in the rough, may not pull up all the bushes within a radius  of three feet.\"    \"In fact, strict rules.\"    \"Strict rules.\"    They shook hands without more words. And presently Peter walked out,  and James, with a guilty look over his shoulder, took down Sandy  MacBean's great work from the bookshelf and began to study the  photograph of the short approach-shot showing Mr. MacBean swinging from  Point A, through dotted line B-C, to Point D, his head the while  remaining rigid at the spot marked with a cross. He felt a little  guiltily that he had stolen a march on his friend, and that the contest  was as good as over.           *       *       *       *       *    I cannot recall a lovelier summer day than that on which the great  Todd-Willard eighteen-hole match took place. It had rained during the  night, and now the sun shone down from a clear blue sky on to turf that  glistened more greenly than the young grass of early spring.  Butterflies flitted to and fro; birds sang merrily. In short, all  Nature smiled. And it is to be doubted if Nature ever had a better  excuse for smiling--or even laughing outright; for matches like that  between James Todd and Peter Willard do not occur every day.    Whether it was that love had keyed them up, or whether hours of study  of Braid's \"Advanced Golf\" and the Badminton Book had produced a  belated effect, I cannot say; but both started off quite reasonably  well. Our first hole, as you can see, is a bogey four, and James was  dead on the pin in seven, leaving Peter, who had twice hit the United  Kingdom with his mashie in mistake for the ball, a difficult putt for  the half. Only one thing could happen when you left Peter a difficult  putt; and James advanced to the lake hole one up, Peter, as he  followed, trying to console himself with the thought that many of the  best golfers prefer to lose the first hole and save themselves for a  strong finish.    Peter and James had played over the lake hole so often that they had  become accustomed to it, and had grown into the habit of sinking a ball  or two as a preliminary formality with much the same stoicism displayed  by those kings in ancient and superstitious times who used to fling  jewellery into the sea to propitiate it before they took a voyage. But  today, by one of those miracles without which golf would not be golf,  each of them got over with his first shot--and not only over, but dead  on the pin. Our \"pro.\" himself could not have done better.    I think it was at this point that the two men began to go to pieces.  They were in an excited frame of mind, and this thing unmanned them.  You will no doubt recall Keats's poem about stout Cortez staring with  eagle eyes at the Pacific while all his men gazed at each other with a  wild surmise, silent upon a peak in Darien. Precisely so did Peter  Willard and James Todd stare with eagle eyes at the second lake hole,  and gaze at each other with a wild surmise, silent upon a tee in  Woodhaven. They had dreamed of such a happening so often and woke to  find the vision false, that at first they could not believe that the  thing had actually occurred.    \"I got over!\" whispered James, in an awed voice.    \"So did I!\" muttered Peter.    \"In one!\"    \"With my very first!\"    They walked in silence round the edge of the lake, and holed out. One  putt was enough for each, and they halved the hole with a two. Peter's  previous record was eight, and James had once done a seven. There are  times when strong men lose their self-control, and this was one of  them. They reached the third tee in a daze, and it was here that  mortification began to set in.    The third hole is another bogey four, up the hill and past the tree  that serves as a direction-post, the hole itself being out of sight. On  his day, James had often done it in ten and Peter in nine; but now they  were unnerved. James, who had the honour, shook visibly as he addressed  his ball. Three times he swung and only connected with the ozone; the  fourth time he topped badly. The discs had been set back a little way,  and James had the mournful distinction of breaking a record for the  course by playing his fifth shot from the tee. It was a low, raking  brassey-shot, which carried a heap of stones twenty feet to the right  and finished in a furrow. Peter, meanwhile, had popped up a lofty ball  which came to rest behind a stone.    It was now that the rigid rules governing this contest began to take  their toll. Had they been playing an ordinary friendly round, each  would have teed up on some convenient hillock and probably been past  the tree with their second, for James would, in ordinary circumstances,  have taken his drive back and regarded the strokes he had made as a  little preliminary practice to get him into midseason form. But today  it was war to the niblick, and neither man asked nor expected quarter.  Peter's seventh shot dislodged the stone, leaving him a clear field,  and James, with his eleventh, extricated himself from the furrow. Fifty  feet from the tree James was eighteen, Peter twelve; but then the  latter, as every golfer does at times, suddenly went right off his  game. He hit the tree four times, then hooked into the sand-bunkers to  the left of the hole. James, who had been playing a game that was  steady without being brilliant, was on the green in twenty-six, Peter  taking twenty-seven. Poor putting lost James the hole. Peter was down  in thirty-three, but the pace was too hot for James. He missed a  two-foot putt for the half, and they went to the fourth tee all square.    The fourth hole follows the curve of the road, on the other side of  which are picturesque woods. It presents no difficulties to the expert,  but it has pitfalls for the novice. The dashing player stands for a  slice, while the more cautious are satisfied if they can clear the  bunker that spans the fairway and lay their ball well out to the left,  whence an iron shot will take them to the green. Peter and James  combined the two policies. Peter aimed to the left and got a slice, and  James, also aiming to the left, topped into the bunker. Peter,  realizing from experience the futility of searching for his ball in the  woods, drove a second, which also disappeared into the jungle, as did  his third. By the time he had joined James in the bunker he had played  his sixth.    It is the glorious uncertainty of golf that makes it the game it is.  The fact that James and Peter, lying side by side in the same bunker,  had played respectively one and six shots, might have induced an  unthinking observer to fancy the chances of the former. And no doubt,  had he not taken seven strokes to extricate himself from the pit, while  his opponent, by some act of God, contrived to get out in two, James's  chances might have been extremely rosy. As it was, the two men  staggered out on to the fairway again with a score of eight apiece.  Once past the bunker and round the bend of the road, the hole becomes  simple. A judicious use of the cleek put Peter on the green in  fourteen, while James, with a Braid iron, reached it in twelve. Peter  was down in seventeen, and James contrived to halve. It was only as he  was leaving the hole that the latter discovered that he had been  putting with his niblick,"]]]
