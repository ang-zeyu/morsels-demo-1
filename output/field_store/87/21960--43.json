And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?      Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch      narrow to an ell broad!      Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to      the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.      Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now      art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by      art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a      great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in      a hole.      Ben. Stop there, stop there!      Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.      Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.      Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I      was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to      occupy the argument no longer.      Rom. Here's goodly gear!                          Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].        Mer. A sail, a sail!      Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.      Nurse. Peter!      Peter. Anon.      Nurse. My fan, Peter.      Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of      the two.      Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.      Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.      Nurse. Is it good-den?      Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is      now upon the prick of noon.      Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!      Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.      Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'      quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the      young Romeo?      Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you      have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest      of that name, for fault of a worse.      Nurse. You say well.      Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,      wisely.      Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.      Ben. She will endite him to some supper.      Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!      Rom. What hast thou found?      Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is      something stale and hoar ere it be spent                                       He walks by them and sings.                       An old hare hoar,                     And an old hare hoar,                  Is very good meat in Lent;                     But a hare that is hoar                     Is too much for a score                  When it hoars ere it be spent.        Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.      Rom. I will follow you.      Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,      [sings] lady, lady, lady.                                        Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.      Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant      was this that was so full of his ropery?      Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and      will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.      Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an  'a      were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,      I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his      flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must      stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!      Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my      weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as      soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the      law on my side.      Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me      quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,      my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I      will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead      her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of      behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and      therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were      an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.      Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto      thee-      Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,      Lord! she will be a joyful woman.      Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.      Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I      take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.      Rom. Bid her devise      Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;      And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell      Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.      Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.      Rom. Go to! I say you shall.      Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.      Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.      Within this hour my man shall be with thee      And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,      Which to the high topgallant of my joy      Must be my convoy in the secret night.      Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.      Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.      Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.      Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?      Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,      Two may keep counsel, putting one away?      Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.      Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!      when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in      town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,      good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I      anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;      but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any      clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both      with a letter?      Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.      Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I      know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest      sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you      good to hear it.      Rom. Commend me to thy lady.      Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!      Peter. Anon.      Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.                                                           Exeunt.          Scene V.  Capulet's orchard.    Enter Juliet.        Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;      In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.      Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.      O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,      Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams      Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.      Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,      And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.      Now is the sun upon the highmost hill      Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve      Is three long hours; yet she is not come.      Had she affections and warm youthful blood,      She would be as swift in motion as a ball;      My words would bandy her to my sweet love,      And his to me,      But old folks, many feign as they were dead-      Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.                          Enter Nurse [and Peter].        O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?      Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.      Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.                                                     [Exit Peter.]      Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?      Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;      If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news      By playing it to me with so sour a face.      Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.      Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!      Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.      Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.      Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?      Do you not see that I am out of breath?      Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath      To say to me that thou art out of breath?      The excuse that thou dost make in this delay      Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.      Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.      Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.      Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?      Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to      choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better      than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a      foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet      they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll      warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve  God.      What, have you din'd at home?      Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.      What says he of our marriage? What of that?      Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!      It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.      My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!      Beshrew your heart for sending me about      To catch my death with jauncing up and down!      Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.      Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?      Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,      and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where      is your mother?      Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.      Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!      'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,      \"Where is your mother?\"'      Nurse. O God's Lady dear!      Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.      Is this the poultice for my aching bones?      Henceforward do your messages yourself.      Jul. Here's such "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11123"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 01 (#7)"],[1,"fore, continually occupied with  the comparison between German and foreign art, language, and  literature, which endeavor was continued later on and with other  methods by A.W. Schlegel. But Herder also, in his comparison of the  native art of Germany with the art of antiquity, of the Orient and of  England, produced effective results; no less did Lessing, although the  latter seeks to learn from the faults of his neighbors rather than  from their excellencies. Goethe's criticism is dominated to such a  degree by his absorption in the antique, and also in French and  English general literature, that he has no understanding of national  peculiarities when they do not conform to typical literary phenomena,  as Uhland's lyric and Kleist's drama--two literary phenomena which we,  nowadays, consider eminently national. The Romantic school was the  first to try to place the conception of national literature as a whole  on an autochthonous basis, and the scientific speculation to which  Romanticism gave rise, has, since the Brothers Grimm, also resulted in  serviceable rules gained from the increasingly thorough knowledge of  language, of national development, and of social conditions. This new  point of view reaches its climax in the attempts of Karl Muellenhoff  and Wilhelm Scherer to trace the native literary development directly  back to the nature and destiny of the German nation. But even as that  proved scientifically unsuccessful, so likewise it was not feasible  practically to establish a poetry confined to native materials, forms,  and opinions. In vain did Tieck try to play off the youthful Goethe,  as the only national one, against the Goethe of the Weimar period,  which attempt many after him have repeated; or again, it was proposed  to strike Heine out of the history of our literature as un-German--the  last two literary events of European significance in Germany,  according to Nietzsche. On the contrary, a comparison of German  literature with those of foreign nations was not only necessary but  also fruitful, as a certain exhaustion had set in, which lent an  aftermath character to the leaders of the German \"intellectual poetry\"  (_Bildungs-Poesie_) of that time. It was necessary once again to  compare our technique, our relationship between the poet and the  people, our participation in all the various literary _genres_ and  problems, with the corresponding phenomena in the countries of Zola,  Bjoernson, Tolstoy, Ibsen, and Strindberg.    This, now, leads up to another question, to that concerning _poetic  ideals_, and not only poetry in itself; the poet also becomes the  object of interest and expectation. Every age embodies a different  ideal, by which in all instances the already existing type and the  loftier hopes of youth are welded into one--if we maybe allowed so to  express it. Antiquity asked that the poet should fill the heart with  gladness; the Middle Ages desired edification with a spiritual or a  worldly coloring; the first centuries of modern times applied to him  for instruction. This last ideal was still in vogue at the beginning  of modern German literature. But gradually the conception of  \"instruction\" altered. The poet of the Germanic nations had now to be  one who could interpret the heart. He should no longer be the medium  for conveying those matters which the didactic novel and the edifying  lyric had treated--things valuable where knowledge of the world and  human nature, intercourse and felicity are concerned--but he must  become a seer again, an announcer of mysterious wisdom. \"Whatever,  unknown or unminded by others, wanders by night through the labyrinth  of the heart\"--that he must transmit to the hearer; he must allow the  listener to share with him the gift of \"being able to give expression  to his suffering.\" Thus the chief task of the modern poet became \"the  reproduction of the objective world through the subjective,\"  consequently \"experience.\" Real events, objects, manifestations must  pass through a human soul in order to gain poetic significance, and  upon the significance of the receiving soul, not upon the \"poetic\" or  \"unpoetic\" nature of the subject itself, depends the poetic  significance.    With this new conception, however, new dangers are connected. Near at  hand lies the fear of a too open declaration of the most intimate  feelings. In many old-style poets of modern times, in Hoelderlin, in  Kleist, Grillparzer, and Annette von Droste-Huelshoff this fear assumes  the character of ethical aversion to baring their feelings in public.  But near, too, lies the hunt after interesting experiences--the need  to \"experience something\" at any price--which marred the life of a  romantic poet of Brentano's talents, and also affected the conduct of  the realist Grabbe. A new responsibility was placed upon the shoulders  of the German poet, which rested heavily on men like Otto Ludwig, and  on account of which writers like Hebbel or Richard Wagner thought  themselves justified in claiming the royal privileges of the favorites  of the gods.    An entirely new method of poetic study began, which perhaps originated  with Heinrich von Kleist: a passionate endeavor to place the whole of  life at the service of observation or to spend it in the study of  technique. The consequence was not seldom a nervous derangement of the  whole apparatus of the soul, just at the moment when it should have  been ready for its greatest performances, as in the case of Nikolaus  Lenau; however, it also frequently resulted in an endlessly increased  receptivity for every experience, as in the case of Bettina von Arnim,  Heine, or Annette von Droste, and the most recent writers.    The infinitely difficult task of the modern poet is made still harder  by the fact that, in spite of all his efforts, he, happily, seldom  succeeds in transforming himself into, one would like to say, an  artistically working apparatus, such as Ibsen very nearly became; not,  however, without deploring the fact at the close of his life. The  German poet in particular has too strong a lyrical inheritance not to  reecho the impressions _directly_ received by his heart. The struggle  between the demands of a purely artistic presentation of reality,  i. e., one governed exclusively by esthetic rules, and its sympathetic  rendering, constitutes the poetic tragedy of most of our \"naturalistic  writers,\" and especially of the most important one among them, Gerhart  Hauptmann. But from this general ideal of the poet, who only through  his own experience will give to reality a true existence and the  possibility of permanence, there follows a straining after technical  requirements such as was formerly almost unknown. This results in an  effort in Germany all the more strenuous in proportion to the former  slackness regarding questions of artistic form. The peculiarities of  the different literary _genres_ are heeded with a severity such as has  been practised before only in antiquity or perhaps by the French.  Poets like Detlev von Liliencron, who formerly had appeared as  advocates of poetical frivolity, now chafed over banal aids for  rhyming, as once Alfred de Musset had done. Friedrich Spielhagen, the  brothers Heinrich and Thomas Mann, and Jacob Wassermann are seen to  busy themselves with the technical questions pertaining to the  prose-epic, no longer in a merely esthetical and easy-going fashion,  but as though they were working out questions vital to existence; and  truly it is bitter earnest with them where their art is concerned.  Often, as in painting, technique becomes the principal object, and the  young naturalism of Arno Holz and Johannes Schlaf has in all  seriousness raised technique to a dogma, without, however, in the long  run being able to get the upper hand of the German need of  establishing intimate relations with the subject of the art.    We must, however, at this point again remind ourselves that the  question is not one of abstract \"poets\" but one of a large number of  living _men_ who, happily, differ widely from one another. Above all,  when considering them we must think of the typical development of the  generations. Those for whom patriotic interests, at least in a direct  sense, seemed to have little meaning, were always followed by  generations patriotically inspired. The Germany of to-day hides, under  the self-deluding appearance of a confinement to purely esthetic  problems, a predominating and lively joy in the growth of the  Fatherland, and naturally also in its mental broadening. To have given  the strongest expression to this joy constitutes the historical  significance of Gustav Frenssen, just as solicitude for its future  inspired the muse of Wilhelm von Polenz.    The preference shown to individual literary _genres_ changes in an  almost regular order of sequence--the Swiss Bovet has even tried  recently to lay down a regular law of alternation. Especially is the  theatre from time to time abused for being a destructive negation of  art, in just as lively a fashion as it is declared at other times to  be the sole realization of the artistic ideal. As to prevailing  temperaments, a preferably pathetic tone--as, for example, in the  epoch of Freytag, Geibel, Treitschke--alternates with a sceptically  satiric one--as in Fontane who (like so many writers, in Germany  especially) did not belong to his own generation nor even to the  immediately succeeding one, but to the next after that! With these are  associated preferences for verse or prose; for idealism or realism and  naturalism; a falling away from philosophy or an inclination to  introduce it into poetry; and numerous other disguises for those  antagonistic principles, to which Kuno Francke in a general survey of  our literature has sought to trace back its different phases.    We have now said about all that, in our opinion, seems necessary for a  general introduction to modern German literature. For the rest, it is  "]]]
