There are many paradoxes in the world and one of them is this, that  wherever the landscape is immense, the sky unlimited, clouds intimately  dense, feelings unfathomable--that is to say where infinitude is  manifest--its fit companion is one solitary person; a multitude there  seems so petty, so distracting.    An individual and the infinite are on equal terms, worthy to gaze on one  another, each from his own throne. But where many men are, how small both  humanity and infinitude become, how much they have to knock off each  other, in order to fit in together! Each soul wants so much room to expand  that in a crowd it needs must wait for gaps through which to thrust a  little craning piece of a head from time to time.    So the only result of our endeavour to assemble is that we become unable  to fill our joined hands, our outstretched arms, with this endless,  fathomless expanse.          BOLPUR,    8_th Jaistha_ (_May_) 1892.      Women who try to be witty, but only succeed in being pert, are  insufferable; and as for attempts to be comic they are disgraceful in  women whether they succeed or fail. The comic is ungainly and exaggerated,  and so is in some sort related to the sublime. The elephant is comic, the  camel and the giraffe are comic, all overgrowth is comic.    It is rather keenness that is akin to beauty, as the thorn to the flower.  So sarcasm is not unbecoming in woman, though coming from her it hurts.  But ridicule which savours of bulkiness woman had better leave to our  sublime sex. The masculine Falstaff makes our sides split, but a feminine  Falstaff would only rack our nerves.          BOLPUR,    12_th Jaistha_ (_May_) 1892.      I usually pace the roof-terrace, alone, of an evening. Yesterday afternoon  I felt it my duty to show my visitors the beauties of the local scenery,  so I strolled out with them, taking Aghore as a guide.    On the verge of the horizon, where the distant fringe of trees was blue, a  thin line of dark blue cloud had risen over them and was looking  particularly beautiful. I tried to be poetical and said it was like blue  collyrium on the fringe of lashes enhancing a beautiful blue eye. Of my  companions one did not hear the remark, another did not understand, while  the third dismissed it with the reply: \"Yes, very pretty.\" I did not feel  encouraged to attempt a second poetical flight.    After walking about a mile we came to a dam, and along the pool of water  there was a row of _tal_ (fan palm) trees, under which was a natural  spring. While we stood there looking at this, we found that the line of  cloud which we had seen in the North was making for us, swollen and grown  darker, flashes of lightning gleaming the while.    We unanimously came to the conclusion that viewing the beauties of nature  could be better done from within the shelter of the house, but no sooner  had we turned homewards than a storm, making giant strides over the open  moorland, was on us with an angry roar. I had no idea, while I was  admiring the collyrium on the eyelashes of beauteous dame Nature, that she  would fly at us like an irate housewife, threatening so tremendous a slap!    It became so dark with the dust that we could not see beyond a few paces.  The fury of the storm increased, and flying stony particles of the rubbly  soil stung our bodies like shot, as the wind took us by the scruff of the  neck and thrust us along, to the whipping of drops of rain which had begun  to fall.    Run! Run! But the ground was not level, being deeply scarred with  watercourses, and not easy to cross at any time, much less in a storm. I  managed to get entangled in a thorny shrub, and was nearly thrown on my  face by the force of the wind as I stopped to free myself.    When we had almost reached the house, a host of servants came hurrying  towards us, shouting and gesticulating, and fell upon us like another  storm. Some took us by the arms, some bewailed our plight, some were eager  to show the way, others hung on our backs as if fearing that the storm  might carry us off altogether. We evaded their attentions with some  difficulty and managed at length to get into the house, panting, with wet  clothes, dusty bodies, and tumbled hair.    One thing I had learnt; and will never again write in novel or story the  lie that the hero with the picture of his lady-love in his mind can pass  unruffled through wind and rain. No one could keep any face in mind,  however lovely, in such a storm,--he has enough to do to keep the sand out  of his eyes!...    The Vaishnava-poets have sung ravishingly of Radha going to her tryst with  Krishna through a stormy night. Did they ever pause to consider, I wonder,  in what condition she must have reached him? The kind of tangle her hair  got into is easily imaginable, and also the state of the rest of her  toilet. When she arrived in her bower with the dust on her body soaked by  the rain into a coating of mud, she must have been a sight!    But when we read the Vaishnava poems, these thoughts do not occur. We only  see on the canvas of our mind the picture of a beautiful woman, passing  under the shelter of the flowering kadambas in the darkness of a stormy  _Shravan_[1] night, towards the bank of the Jumna, forgetful of wind  or rain, as in a dream, drawn by her surpassing love. She has tied up her  anklets lest they should tinkle; she is clad in dark blue raiment lest she  be discovered; but she holds no umbrella lest she get wet, carries no  lantern lest she fall!    [Footnote 1: July-August, the rainy season.]    Alas for useful things--how necessary in practical life, how neglected in  poetry! But poetry strives in vain to free us from their bondage--they  will be with us always; so much so, we are told, that with the march of  civilisation it is poetry that will become extinct, but patent after  patent will continue to be taken out for the improvement of shoes and  umbrellas.          BOLPUR,    16_th Jaistha (May)_ 1892.      No church tower clock chimes here, and there being no other human  habitation near by, complete silence falls with the evening, as soon as  the birds have ceased their song. There is not much difference between  early night and midnight. A sleepless night in Calcutta flows like a huge,  slow river of darkness; one can count the varied sounds of its passing,  lying on one's back in bed. But here the night is like a vast, still lake,  placidly reposing, with no sign of movement. And as I tossed from side to  side last night I felt enveloped within a dense stagnation.    This morning I left my bed a little later than usual and, coming  downstairs to my room, leant back on a bolster, one leg resting over the  other knee. There, with a slate on my chest, I began to write a poem to  the accompaniment of the morning breeze and the singing birds. I was  getting along splendidly--a smile playing over my lips, my eyes half  closed, my head swaying to the rhythm, the thing I hummed gradually taking  shape--when the post arrived.    There was a letter, the last number of the _Sadhana Magazine_, one of  the _Monist_, and some proof-sheets. I read the letter, raced my eyes  over the uncut pages of the _Sadhana_, and then again fell to nodding  and humming through my poem. I did not do another thing till I had  finished it.    I wonder why the writing of pages of prose does not give one anything like  the joy of completing a single poem. One's emotions take on such  perfection of form in a poem; they can, as it were, be taken up by the  fingers. But prose is like a sackful of loose material, heavy and  unwieldy, incapable of being lifted as you please.    If I could finish writing one poem a day, my life would pass in a kind of  joy; but though I have been busy tending poetry for many a year it has not  been tamed yet, and is not the kind of winged steed to allow me to bridle  it whenever I like! The joy of art is in freedom to take a distant flight  as fancy will; then, even after return within the prison-world, an echo  lingers in the ear, an exaltation in the mind.    Short poems keep coming to me unsought, and so prevent my getting on with  the play. Had it not been for these, I could have let in ideas for two or  three plays which have been knocking at the door. I am afraid I must wait  for the cold weather. All my plays except \"Chitra\" were written in the  winter. In that season lyrical fervour is apt to grow cold, and one gets  the leisure to write drama.          BOLPUR,    _31st May 1892._      It is not yet five o'clock, but the light has dawned, there is a  delightful breeze, and all the birds in the garden are awake and have  started singing. The _koel_ seems beside itself. It is difficult to  understand why it should keep on cooing so untiringly. Certainly not to  entertain us, nor to distract the pining lover[1]--it must have some  personal purpose of its own. But, sadly enough, that purpose never seems  to get fulfilled. Yet it is not down-hearted, and its Coo-oo! Coo-oo!  keeps going, with now and then an ultra-fervent trill. What can it mean?    [Footnote 1: A favourite conceit of the old Sanskrit poets.]    And then in the distance there is some other bird with only a faint  chuck-chuck that has no energy or enthusiasm, as if all hope were lost;  none the less, from within some shady nook it cannot resist uttering this  little plaint: chuck, chuck, chuck.    How little we really know of the household affairs of these innocent  winged creatures, with their soft, breasts and necks and their  many-coloured feathers! Why on earth do they find it necessary to sing so  persistently?          SHELIDAH,    _31st Jaistha (June)1892._      I hate these polite formalities. Nowadays I keep repeating the line: \"Much  rather would I be an Arab Bedouin!\" A fine, healthy, strong, and free  barbarity.    I feel I want to quit this constant ageing of mind and body, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7959"],[0,"The Reign of Tiberius, Out of the First Six Annals of Tacitus; (#6)"],[1,"Wood writes in another strain,  in the \"Athenae Oxonienis\": \"A rare Translation it is, and the Work of  a very Great Master indeed, both in our Tongue and that Story. For if  we consider the difficulty of the Original, and the Age wherein the  Translation lived, it is both for the exactness of the version, and  the chastity of the Language, one of the most accurate and perfect  translations that ever were made into English.\" There is a rendering  by Murphy, diffuse and poor; a dilution of Gordon, worthy neither of  Tacitus nor of the English tongue. There are translations, too, into  almost every modern language: I would give the highest praise to  Davanzati; a scholar of Tuscany, who lived in the sixteenth century.  In French, I cannot but admire the labours of M. Burnouf: although the  austere rules, the precise constructions, and the easy comportment of  the French prose are not suited to the style of Tacitus, and something  of his weight and brevity are lost; yet the translator never loses the  depth and subtilty of his author's meaning; his work is agreeable to  read, and very useful to consult. The maps and the genealogical tables  in the three volumes of Messrs. Church and Brodribb's translation are  also of the greatest service, and the notes are sometimes most amusing.    Of Tacitus himself, there is little for me to say: those, who know him,  can judge for themselves; to those who do not, no words are able to  convey an adequate impression. \"Who is able to infuse into me,\" Cardinal  Newman asks, \"or how shall I imbibe, a sense of the peculiarities of  the style of Cicero or Virgil, if I have not read their writings? No  description, however complete, could convey to my mind an exact likeness  of a tune, or an harmony, which I have never heard; and still less of a  scent, which I have never smelled: and if I said that Mozart's melodies  were as a summer sky, or as the breath of Zephyr, I shall be better  understood by those who knew Mozart, than by those who did not.\" These  truths are little remembered by modern critics: though, indeed, it is  not possible to convey to a reader adequate notions about the style  of an author, whom that reader has not pondered for himself; about  his thoughts or his subjects, it may be different. Still, I may write  something about the manner of Tacitus, which will not violate Cardinal  Newman's laws, nor be an outrage to taste and common-sense. \"It is the  great excellence of a writer,\" says Dr. Johnson, \"to put into his book  as much as it will hold:\" and if this judgment be sound, then is Tacitus  the greatest of all writers in prose. Gordon says of him, \"He explains  events with a redundancy of images, and a frugality of words: his  images are many, but close and thick; his words are few, but pointed and  glowing; and even his silence is instructive and affecting. Whatever he  says, you see; and all, that you see, affects you. Let his words be ever  so few, his thought and matter are always abundant. His imagination is  boundless, yet never outruns his judgment; his wisdom is solid and vast,  yet always enlivened by his imagination. He starts the idea, and lets  the imagination pursue it; the sample he gives you is so fine, that you  are presently curious to see the whole piece, and then you have your  share in the merit of the discovery; a compliment, which some able  writers have forgot to pay to their readers.\" I would remark here, that  many of the old writers give me the sense of handling things, they are  definite and solid; while some of the moderns appear to play with words  only, and never to come up with the objects of their pursuit: \"we are  too often ravished with a sonorous sentence,\" as Dr. Johnson says, \"of  which, when the noise is past, the meaning does not long remain.\" But  of Tacitus, Gordon says, \"His words and phrases are admirably adapted  to his matter and conceptions, and make impressions sudden and wonderful  upon the mind of man. Stile is a part of genius, and Tacitus had one  peculiar to himself; a sort of language of his own, one fit to express  the amazing vigour of his spirit, and that redundancy of reflections  which for force and frequency are to be equalled by no writer before nor  since.\"    Dr. Johnson, however, says in another place, \"Tacitus, Sir, seems to me  rather to have made notes for an historical work, than to have written  a history:\" I must own, that upon the subject of Tacitus, I prefer the  sentiments of Gordon; and Montaigne would agree with me, for he says, \"I  do not know any author, who, in a work of history, has taken so broad  a view of human events, or given a more just analysis of particular  characters.\" The impressions of Tacitus are indeed wonderful: I doubt,  whether volumes could bring us nearer to the mutinous legions, than the  few chapters in which he records their history. I am always delighted  by Gordon's way of telling the battle, in which the iron men of Sacrovir  were overthrown; the account begins on page 139. Then how satisfying is  the narrative of the wars in Germany, of the shipwreck, of the funeral  of Varus and the slaughtered legions; how pleasing the description of  Germanicus' antiquarian travels in Egypt, and in Greece. Though Tacitus  is not a maker of \"descriptions,\" in our modern sense: there is but one  \"description\" in \"The Annals,\" so far as I remember, it is of Capri; and  it is not the sort, that would be quoted by a reviewer, as a \"beautiful  cameo of description.\" With Tacitus, a field of battle is not an  occasion for \"word-painting,\" as we call it; the battle is always first,  the scenery of less importance. He tells, what it is necessary to know;  but he is too wise to think, that we can realise from words, a place  which we have never seen; and too sound in his taste, to forget the  wholesome boundaries between poetry and prose. This is the way of all  the ancient writers. In a work on \"Landscape,\" I remember that Mr.  Hamerton mourns over the Commentaries of Caesar; because they do not  resemble the letters of a modern war-correspondent; Ascham, on the other  hand, a man of real taste and learning, says of the Commentaries, \"All  things be most perfectly done by him; in Caesar only, could never yet  fault be found.\" I agree with Ascham: I think I prefer the Commentaries  as they are, chaste and quiet; I really prefer them to Mr. Kinglake's  \"Crimean War,\" or to Mr. Forbes' Despatches, or even to the most  effusive pages of Mr. Stanley's book on Africa.    In \"The Life of Agricola,\" I would mention the simplicity of the  treatment and the excellence of the taste. Tacitus does not recite the  whole of Roman history, nor assemble all the worthies out of Plutarch.  Agricola is not compared to the pyramids, to the Flavian circus, nor to  any works of art and literature: these flights of imagination were  not known to the Ancients; but in a learned modern, I have seen Dante  compared to Wagner's operas, to the Parthenon and St. Peter's, and to  Justinian's code. The sanctities of private life are not violated; yet  we know everything, that it is decent to know, about Agricola. Lord  Coleridge has given a beautiful rendering of the closing passages of  \"The Agricola,\" in his account of Mr. Matthew Arnold: these elegant  papers are not only models of good English; but are conspicuous,  among recent obituary notices, for their fine taste and their becoming  reticence. From the excesses of modern biographers, Tacitus was in  little danger; thanks to his Roman sense, and to the qualities of the  Roman Language. \"Economy,\" says Mr. Symonds, \"is exhibited in every  element of this athletic tongue. Like a naked gladiator all bone and  muscle, it relies upon bare sinewy strength.\" That author speaks of \"the  austere and masculine virtues of Latin, the sincerity and brevity of  Roman speech;\" and Tacitus is, beyond any doubt, the strongest, the  austerest, the most pregnant of all the Romans. \"Sanity,\" says Mr.  Matthew Arnold, in conclusion, \"that is the great virtue of the ancient  literature; the want of that is the great defect of the modern, in  spite of all its variety and power.\" \"It is impossible to read the great  ancients, without losing something of our caprice and eccentricity. I  know not how it is, but their commerce with the ancients appears to  me to produce, in those who constantly practise it, a steadying and  composing effect upon the judgment, not of literary works only, but of  men and events in general. They are like persons who have had a very  weighty and impressive experience; they are more truly than others under  the empire of facts, and more independent of the language current among  those with whom they live.\"    It has been told of Cardinal Newman, that he never liked to pass  a single day, without rendering an English sentence into Latin. To  converse with the Roman authors, to handle their precise and sparing  language, is, I can well believe it, a most wholesome discipline;  and the most efficient remedy against those faults of diffuseness, of  obscurity, and of excess, which are only too common among the writers  of our day. It may have been to this practice, that Cardinal Newman owed  something of his clearness, and of his exquisite simplicity: and for  his style, he should be idolised by every one who has a taste for  literature. I have said many things in praise of the ancient authors: it  pleases me, as I finish, to offer my humble tribute to an author who is  quite our own; to one, who in all his writings has bequeathed us perfect  models of chaste, of lucid, and of melodious prose.
