And as Scobell seems to be financing this  show, perhaps it's up to me to step lively if he wants it. But it's a  pity. I was just beginning to like this place. There is generally  something doing along the White Way after twilight, Crump.\"    The gravity of Mr. Scobell's secretary broke up unexpectedly into a  slow, wide smile. His eyes behind their glasses gleamed with a wistful  light.    \"Gee!\" he murmured.    John looked at him, amazed.    \"Crump,\" he cried. \"Crump, I believe you're a sport!\"    Mr. Crump seemed completely to have forgotten his responsible position  as secretary to a millionaire and special messenger to a prince. He  smirked.    \"I'd have liked a day or two in the old burg,\" he said softly. \"I  haven't been to Rector's since Ponto was a pup.\"    John reached across the table and seized the secretary's hand.    \"Crump,\" he said, \"you _are_ a sport. This is no time for delay.  If we are to liven up this great city, we must get busy right away.  Grab your hat, and come along. One doesn't become a prince every day.  The occasion wants celebrating. Are you with me, Crump, old scout?\"    \"Sure thing,\" said the envoy ecstatically.           *       *       *       *       *    At eight o'clock on the following morning, two young men, hatless and a  little rumpled, but obviously cheerful, entered the Astor Hotel,  demanding breakfast.    A bell boy who met them was addressed by the larger of the two, and  asked his name.    \"Desmond Ryan,\" he replied.    The young man patted him on his shoulder.    \"I appoint you, Desmond Ryan,\" he said, \"Grand Hereditary Bell Hop to  the Court of Mervo.\"    Thus did Prince John formally enter into his kingdom.          CHAPTER V    MR. SCOBELL HAS ANOTHER IDEA      Owing to collaboration between Fate and Mr. Scobell, John's state entry  into Mervo was an interesting blend between a pageant and a vaudeville  sketch. The pageant idea was Mr. Scobell's. Fate supplied the  vaudeville.    The reception at the quay, when the little steamer that plied between  Marseilles and the island principality gave up its precious freight,  was not on quite so impressive a scale as might have been given to the  monarch of a more powerful kingdom; but John was not disappointed.  During the voyage from New York, in the intervals of seasickness--for  he was a poor sailor--Mr. Crump had supplied him with certain facts  about Mervo, one of which was that its adult population numbered just  under thirteen thousand, and this had prepared him for any shortcomings  in the way of popular demonstration.    As a matter of fact, Mr. Scobell was exceedingly pleased with the scale  of the reception, which to his mind amounted practically to pomp. The  Palace Guard, forty strong, lined the quay. Besides these, there were  four officers, a band, and sixteen mounted carbineers. The rest of the  army was dotted along the streets. In addition to the military, there  was a gathering of a hundred and fifty civilians, mainly drawn from  fishing circles. The majority of these remained stolidly silent  throughout, but three, more emotional, cheered vigorously as a young  man was seen to step on to the gangway, carrying a grip, and make for  the shore. General Poineau, a white-haired warrior with a fierce  mustache, strode forward and saluted. The Palace Guards presented arms.  The band struck up the Mervian national anthem. General Poineau,  lowering his hand, put on a pair of _pince-nez_ and began to  unroll an address of welcome.    It was then seen that the young man was Mr. Crump. General Poineau  removed his glasses and gave an impatient twirl to his mustache. Mr.  Scobell, who for possibly the first time in his career was not smoking  (though, as was afterward made manifest, he had the materials on his  person), bustled to the front.    \"Where's his nibs, Crump?\" he enquired.    The secretary's reply was swept away in a flood of melody. To the band  Mr. Crump's face was strange. They had no reason to suppose that he was  not Prince John, and they acted accordingly. With a rattle of drums  they burst once more into their spirited rendering of the national  anthem.    Mr. Scobell sawed the air with his arms, but was powerless to dam the  flood.    \"His Highness is shaving, sir!\" bawled Mr. Crump, depositing his grip  on the quay and making a trumpet of his hands.    \"Shaving!\"    \"Yes, sir. I told him he ought to come along, but His Highness said he  wasn't going to land looking like a tramp comedian.\"    By this time General Poineau had explained matters to the band and they  checked the national anthem abruptly in the middle of a bar, with the  exception of the cornet player, who continued gallantly by himself till  a feeling of loneliness brought the truth home to him. An awkward stage  wait followed, which lasted until John was seen crossing the deck, when  there were more cheers, and General Poineau, resuming his  _pince-nez_, brought out the address of welcome again.    At this point Mr. Scobell made his presence felt.    \"Glad to meet you, Prince,\" he said, coming forward. \"Scobell's my  name. Shake hands with General Poineau. No, that's wrong. I guess he  kisses your hand, don't he?\"    \"I'll swing on him if he does,\" said John, cheerfully.    Mr. Scobell eyed him doubtfully. His Highness did not appear to him to  be treating the inaugural ceremony with that reserved dignity which we  like to see in princes on these occasions. Mr. Scobell was a business  man. He wanted his money's worth. His idea of a Prince of Mervo was  something statuesquely aloof, something--he could not express it  exactly--on the lines of the illustrations in the Zenda stories in the  magazines--about eight feet high and shinily magnificent, something  that would give the place a tone. That was what he had had in his mind  when he sent for John. He did not want a cheerful young man in a soft  hat and a flannel suit who looked as if at any moment he might burst  into a college yell.    General Poineau, meanwhile, had embarked on the address of welcome.  John regarded him thoughtfully.    \"I can see,\" he said to Mr. Scobell, \"that the gentleman is making a  good speech, but what is he saying? That is what gets past me.\"    \"He is welcoming Your Highness,\" said Mr. Crump, the linguist, \"in the  name of the people of Mervo.\"    \"Who, I notice, have had the bully good sense to stay in bed. I guess  they knew that the Boy Orator would do all that was necessary. He  hasn't said anything about a bite of breakfast, has he? Has his address  happened to work around to the subject of shredded wheat and shirred  eggs yet? That's the part that's going to make a hit with me.\"    \"There'll be breakfast at my villa, Your Highness,\" said Mr. Scobell.  \"My automobile is waiting along there.\"    The General reached his peroration, worked his way through it, and  finished with a military clash of heels and a salute. The band rattled  off the national anthem once more.    \"Now, what?\" said John, turning to Mr. Scobell. \"Breakfast?\"    \"I guess you'd better say a few words to them, Your Highness; they'll  expect it.\"    \"But I can't speak the language, and they can't understand English. The  thing'll be a stand-off.\"    \"Crump will hand it to 'em. Here, Crump.\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Line up and shoot His Highness's remarks into 'em.\"    \"Yes, sir.    \"It's all very well for you, Crump,\" said John. \"You probably enjoy  this sort of thing. I don't. I haven't felt such a fool since I sang  'The Maiden's Prayer' on Tremont Street when I was joining the frat.  Are you ready? No, it's no good. I don't know what to say.\"    \"Tell 'em you're tickled to death,\" advised Mr. Scobell anxiously.    John smiled in a friendly manner at the populace. Then he coughed.  \"Gentlemen,\" he said--\"and more particularly the sport on my left who  has just spoken his piece whose name I can't remember--I thank you for  the warm welcome you have given me. If it is any satisfaction to you to  know that it has made me feel like thirty cents, you may have that  satisfaction. Thirty is a liberal estimate.\"    \"'His Highness is overwhelmed by your loyal welcome. He thanks you  warmly,'\" translated Mr. Crump, tactfully.    \"I feel that we shall get along nicely together,\" continued John. \"If  you are chumps enough to turn out of your comfortable beds at this time  of the morning simply to see me, you can't be very hard to please. We  shall hit it off fine.\"    _Mr. Crump:_ \"His Highness hopes and believes that he will always  continue to command the affection of his people.\"    \"I--\" John paused. \"That's the lot,\" he said. \"The flow of inspiration  has ceased. The magic fire has gone out. Break it to 'em, Crump. For  me, breakfast.\"    During the early portion of the ride Mr. Scobell was silent and  thoughtful. John's speech had impressed him neither as oratory nor as  an index to his frame of mind. He had not interrupted him, because he  knew that none of those present could understand what was being said,  and that Mr. Crump was to be relied on as an editor. But he had not  enjoyed it. He did not take the people of Mervo seriously himself, but  in the Prince such an attitude struck him as unbecoming. Then he  cheered up. After all, John had given evidence of having a certain  amount of what he would have called \"get-up\" in him. For the purposes  for which he needed him, a tendency to make light of things was not  amiss. It was essentially as a performing prince that he had engaged  John. He wanted him to do unusual things, which would make people  talk--aeroplaning was one that occurred to him. Perhaps a prince who  took a serious view of his position would try to raise the people's  minds and start reforms and generally be a nuisance. John could, at any  rate, be relied upon not to do that.    His face cleared.    \"Have a good cigar, Prince?\" he said, cordially, inserting two fingers  in his vest-pocket.    \"Sure,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6971"],[0,"Judaism (#6)"],[1,"those that sleep in the grave. He is the Reviver of the  dead. He is Holy, and He sanctified Israel with His commandments. And  the whole is pervaded with the thought of God's Unity and the consequent  unity of mankind. Here again we meet the curious syncretism which we  have so often observed. God is in a special sense the God of Israel;  but He is unequivocally, too, the God of all flesh.    Moses Mendelssohn said that, when in the company of a Christian friend,  he never felt the remotest desire to convert him to Judaism. This is the  explanation of the effect on the Jews of the combined belief in God as  the God of Israel, and also as the God of all men. At one time Judaism  was certainly a missionary religion. But after the loss of nationality  this quality was practically dormant. Belief was not necessary to  salvation. 'The pious of all nations have a part in the world to come'  may have been but a casual utterance of an ancient Rabbi, but it rose  into a settled conviction of later Judaism. Moreover, it was dangerous  for Jews to attempt any religious propaganda in the Middle Ages, and  thus the pressure of fact came to the support of theory. Mendelssohn  even held that the same religion was not necessarily good for all,  just as the same form of government may not fit equally all the various  national idiosyncrasies. Judaism for the Jew may almost be claimed as  a principle of orthodox Judaism. It says to the outsider: You may come  in if you will, but we warn you what it means. At all events it does  not seek to attract. It is not strange that this attitude has led to  unpopularity. The reason of this resentment is not that men wish to be  invited to join Judaism; it lies rather in the sense that the absence  of invitation implies an arrogant reserve. To some extent this is the  case. The old-fashioned Jew is inclined to think himself superior to  other men. Such a thought has its pathos.    On the other hand, the national as contrasted with the universal aspect  of Judaism is on the wane. Many Jewish liturgies have, for instance,  eliminated the prayers for the restoration of sacrifices; and several have  removed or spiritualised the petitions for the recovery of the Jewish  nationality. Modern reformed Judaism is a universalistic Judaism. It  lays stress on the function of Israel, the Servant, as a 'Light to the  Nations.' It tends to eliminate those ceremonies and beliefs which are  less compatible with a universal than with, a racial religion. Modern  Zionism is not a real reaction against this tendency. For Zionism is  either non-religious or, if religious, brings to the front what has  always been a corrective to the nationalism of orthodox Judaism. For  the separation of Israel has ever been a means to an end; never an end  in itself. Often the end has been forgotten in the means, but never for  long. The end of Israel's separateness is the good of the world. And  the religious as distinct from the merely political Zionist who thinks  that Judaism would gain by a return to Palestine is just the one who also  thinks that return is a necessary preliminary to the Messianic Age, when  all men shall flow unto Zion and seek God there. Reformed Jews would have  to be Zionists also in this sense, were it not that many of them no longer  share the belief in the national aspects of the prophecies as to Israel's  future. These may believe that the world may become full of the knowledge  of God without any antecedent withdrawal of Israel from the world.    If Judaism as a system of doctrine is necessarily syncretistic in  its conception of God, then we may expect the same syncretism in its  theory of God's relation to man. It must be said at once that the term  'theory' is ill-chosen. It is laid to the charge of Judaism that it has no  'theory' of Sin. This is true. If virtue and righteousness are obedience,  then disobedience is both vice and sin. No further theory was required  or possible. Atonement is reversion to obedience. Now it was said above  that the doctrine of the Unity did not reach Judaism as a philosophical  truth exactly defined and apprehended. It came as the result of a long  historic groping for the truth, and when it came it brought with it olden  anthropomorphic wrappings and tribal adornments which were not easily to  be discarded, if they ever were entirely discarded. So with the relation  of God to man in general and Israel in particular. The unchangeable  God is not susceptible to the change implied in Atonement. But history  presented to the Jew examples of what he could not otherwise interpret  than as reconciliation between God the Father and Israel the wayward  but always at heart loyal Son. And this interpretation was true to the  inward experience. Man's repentance was correlated with the sorrow of  God. God as well as man repented, the former of punishment, the latter  of sin. The process of atonement included contrition, confession, and  change of life. Undoubtedly Jewish theology lays the greatest stress on  the active stage of the process. Jewish moralists use the word Teshubah  (literally 'turning' or 'return,' _i.e._ a turning from evil or  a return to God) chiefly to mean a change of life. Sin is evil life,  atonement is the better life. The better life was attained by fasting,  prayer, and charity, by a purification of the heart and a cleansing of the  hands. The ritual side of atonement was seriously weakened by the loss  of the Temple. The sacrificial atonement was gone. Nothing replaced  it ritually. Hence the Jewish tendency towards a practical religion  was strengthened by its almost enforced stress in atonement on moral  betterment. But this moral betterment depended on a renewed communion  with God. Sin estranged, atonement brought near. Jewish theology regarded  sin as a triumph of the _Yetser Ha-ra_ (the 'evil inclination')  over the _Yetser Ha-tob_ (the 'good inclination'). Man was always  liable to fall a prey to his lower self. But such a fall, though usual  and universal, was not inevitable. Man reasserted his higher self when  he curbed his passions, undid the wrong he had wrought to others, and  turned again to God with a contrite heart. As a taint of the soul, sin  was washed away by the suppliant's tears and confession, by his sense  of loss, his bitter consciousness of humiliation, but withal man was  helpless without God. God was needed for the atonement. Israel never  dreamed of putting forward his righteousness as a claim to pardon.  'We are empty of good works' is the constant refrain of the Jewish  penitential appeals. The final reliance is on God and on God alone. Yet  Judaism took over from its past the anthropomorphic belief that God could  be moved by man's prayers, contrition, amendment--especially by man's  amendment. Atonement was only real when the amendment began; it only  lasted while the amendment endured. Man must not think to throw his own  burden entirely on God. God will help him to bear it, and will lighten  the weight from willing shoulders. But bear it man can and must. The  shoulders must be at all events willing.    Judaism as a theology stood or fell by its belief that man can affect  God. If, for instance, prayer had no validity, then Judaism had no basis.  Judaism did not distinguish between the objective and subjective efficacy  of prayer. The two went together. The acceptance of the will of God  and the inclining of God's purpose to the desire of man were two sides  of one fact. The Rabbinic Judaism did not mechanically posit, however,  the objective validity of prayer. On the contrary, the man who prayed  expecting an answer was regarded as arrogant and sinful. A famous Talmudic  prayer sums up the submissive aspect of the Jew in this brief petition  (Berachoth, 29 a): 'Do Thy will in heaven above, and grant contentment of  spirit to those that fear Thee below; and that which is good in Thine eyes  do. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who hearest prayer.' This, be it remembered,  was the prayer of a Pharisee. So, too, a very large portion of all Jewish  prayer is not petition but praise. Still, Judaism believed, not that  prayer would be answered, but that it could be answered. In modern times  the chief cause of the weakening of religion all round, in and out of  the Jewish communion, is the growing disbelief in the objective validity  of prayer. And a similar remark applies to the belief in miracles.  But to a much less extent. All ancient religions were based on miracle,  and even to the later religious consciousness a denial of miracle seems  to deny the divine Omnipotence. Jewish theology from the Rabbinic age  sought to evade the difficulty by the mystic notion that all miracles  were latent in ordered nature at the creation. And so the miraculous  becomes interconnected with Providence as revealed in history. But the  belief in special miracles recurs again and again in Judaism, and though  discarded by most reformed theologies, must be admitted as a prevailing  concept of the older religion.    But the belief was rather in general than in special Providence. There  was a communal solidarity which made most of the Jewish prayers communal  more than personal. It is held by many that in the Psalter 'I' in the  majority of cases means the whole people. The sense of brotherhood, in  other relations besides public worship, is a perennial characteristic  of Judaism.    Even more marked is this in the conception of the family. The hallowing  of home-life was one of the best features of Judaism. Chastity was  the mark of men and women alike. The position of the Jewish woman was  in many ways high. At law she enjoyed certain privileges and suffered  certain disabilities. But in the house she was queen. Monogamy had been  the rule of Jewish life from the period of the return from the Babylonian  Exile. In the Middle Ages the custom of monogamy was legalised in Western  Jewish communities.
