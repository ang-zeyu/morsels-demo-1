Its arrangement was similar to that of  the room at the inn, with its raised dais for the master, his family,  and guests, while the rest of the room was devoted to the retainers  and servants. The cooking, however, was carried on in a room apart.  There were two fireplaces, one upon the dais and the other in the  body of the hall. On the walls hung trophies of the chase and arms  of all sorts. The wooden roof was supported by massive beams, and  with the exception of the trophies on the walls there was no attempt  at decoration of any kind. During the residence of the family at  the house, however, the hangings of tapestry, the work of generations  of dames of Steyning, their daughters and maids, hung upon the walls  round the dais.    The news quickly spread of the arrival of the young thane, and a  score of men and eight or ten women and maids flocked into the hall  to welcome him, and as he stood on the dais each in turn came forward  to kiss his hand and salute him.    \"I think my first order must be,\" he said to the steward, \"that a  cask of your best ale be broached.\"    \"That shall be done at once,\" Egbert replied; \"there is never a  lack of drink here, but the best is none too good for the occasion.  And who is this youth with you?\" he went on when he had given the  necessary orders, pointing to Osgod, who was standing somewhat shyly  apart.    \"He is my friend, and is going to be my body attendant and squire,\"  Wulf said. \"He, like myself, knows nothing as yet of his duties,  but that he will be faithful and trusty I know full well, and the  earl himself said that I did wisely to bring him with me.\"    \"I will myself instruct him in his duties,\" Egbert said, \"which  indeed are not hard to learn by one of willing mind. He will stand  behind you at table, will hand you your cup and take your orders.  In the old times it would have been his duty to see that you were  not struck down by a traitorous blow while you drank, but those  days are passed. When in the field he will carry your helmet till  you need to put it on; will keep close to you in the fight and guard  you with his shield from arrows, and with his sword from attacks  from behind; he will carry your banner, and see that as long as he  has strength to hold it, it floats fairly out as a rallying point  for your men. In the field indeed his duties are numerous, but at  home in peace, beyond seeing that your arms are bright and clean,  and that your orders are carried out properly, he will have but  little to do. It is well that you brought him with you, for otherwise  you would have had to choose one of the sons of your tenants, and  the choice would have been a difficult one, for each would have  desired the honour, and whichever you chose there would have been  sore jealousy among the others.\"    The next day there was a great gathering in the hall. The whole of  the tenants attended, and took the oath to be Wulf's men, as they  had been those of his father, to obey his orders, and to follow him  in the field with the due number of men according to the size of  their holdings; while Wulf on his part swore to protect them from  all wrong and oppression, to be a just master, calling upon them  only for such service as he was entitled to demand, and exacting  no feus or payments beyond those customary. A bullock had been  killed, and after the ceremony was over all present sat down to a  banquet at which much ale was drunk and feasting went on till  nightfall.    The next morning Wulf, accompanied by Leof and Egbert, rode round  the estate, choosing among the sons of the tenants thirty stout  young men willing to enrol themselves as house-carls, receiving a  regular rate of pay, and ready at all times to give service under  arms, and to remain in the field as long as they might be required,  whereas the general levy could only be kept under arms for a limited  time. He had already gone into the matter with Leof, who pointed  out that, as at present he had no wish to keep up any show or to  have a body of armed men in the house, it would suffice if the men  were exercised every day for a month, and after that merely practised  with sword and battle-axe for two or three hours once a week. On  these terms he had no difficulty in obtaining considerably more  than the number he asked for, and finally fifty men were enrolled.    For those carls helmets were bought and coats of ringed armour made,  and for a month they exercised daily. Of manoeuvring there was  little indeed. The Saxons and Danes alike fought in line, with but  room enough between them to swing their battle-axes. Each carried  a spear as well as an axe, and when repelling the assault of an  enemy closed up so that their shields well-nigh touched each other.  Their exercise was generally either to engage in combats between  chosen pairs, or, dividing into two parties, to fight line against  line with blunted poles for spears and with stout cudgels for axes.  Leof in these combats acted as judge, decided which side had gained  the victory, praised the skilful, and chided the careless and  sluggish. He gave lessons in the use of the sword and battle-axe  to Wulf and Osgod, sometimes pitting them against each other,  sometimes fighting himself against Wulf, and teaching Osgod how to  assist his master by covering him with his shield.    Sometimes he would order three or four of the men to shoot with  blunted arrows at Wulf, whom he taught to catch them on his shield  or to sever the shafts with a blow of his sword, while Osgod standing  by helped to cover him when two or three arrows flew at him together.  This was a daily exercise, and even after the month's regular work  was over some of the men came up every day to shoot, until Wulf had  attained such coolness and skill that he could in the great majority  of cases cut the shafts in two with his sword.    But the whole day was by no means given up to warlike exercises.  Wulf rode out with the steward inspecting the houses and farms,  learning what there was to be learned of the rude processes of  agriculture, investigating the complaints of the depredations  committed by errant herds of swine or by neighbours' cattle and  sheep, seeing what was required in the repairs of farmhouses, and  learning from Egbert to discriminate between those who were unable  to pay their dues owing to misfortune, illness, or murrain among  the animals, and those whose losses were due to their own sloth or  carelessness. Upon these visits, too, the arms of the tenants were  inspected to ascertain that they could properly fulfil their service  if summoned to take the field.    The lands embraced by Wulf's feof were of considerable extent,  reaching down to the sea, where they were some eight miles broad,  and running back twelve miles beyond Steyning. Several small hamlets  lay within it, and in case of war he could summon more than three  hundred men to his banner. Several of the neighbouring thanes rode  in as soon as they heard that Wulf had returned to fill his father's  place at Steyning, and these visits were duly returned. But accustomed  as Wulf had been to the orderliness of the court of the ascetic  King Edward the rude manners and nightly revelry of these rough  thanes by no means pleased him, so that he was glad when the visits  were over, and he could remain quietly at home, where he was not  without frequent guests.    The most regular of his visitors was the prior of the monastery at  Bramber, which had been founded by the piety of one of Wulf's  ancestors. The prior had, though Wulf was ignorant of it, received  a letter from Earl Harold asking him to befriend Wulf, to encourage  him to keep up the studies he had followed at Waltham, and to see  that he did not fall into the drinking habit so common among the  Saxons. The priest was well fitted for the mission. He was by no  means a strict disciplinarian, but the monastery had the reputation  of being one of the best managed in Sussex, and among the monks  were many of good blood. He was passionately fond of art, and  encouraged its exercise among the monks, so that the illuminated  missals of Bramber were highly prized, and added largely to the  revenues of the monastery.    The prior had been one of the monks at Waltham, and owed his elevation  to the influence of Earl Harold with the late thane of Steyning.  He was well taught in all the learning of the day, and having been  for a time at Westminster, knew more of court life than the majority  of the priors of isolated monasteries, and could suit his conversation  to his hearer. Harold had said in his letter, \"The lad has good  parts. He is somewhat full of mischief, and has got into a scrape  here by a quarrel with a Norman page, and by failing somewhat in  the respect due to William of London, who took his compatriot's  part with too much zeal. But Wulf is shrewd, and benefited greatly  by his stay at Waltham, and both for the lad's own sake and for my  friendship with the good thane, his father, I would fain that he  grew up not only a sturdy Englishman, as to which I have no manner  of doubt, but one who may some day play his part at court, and be  a worthy friend and counsellor of an English king. Therefore I pray  you, father, to keep an eye on the lad, and spare him what time you  can from your duties. Tell him not that I have written to you, for  it is the nature of youth to be averse to anything that looks like  guardianship.\"    Such a request from Earl Harold was regarded by the prior as an  order, and a few days after Wulf was installed at Steyning the prior  rode over on his palfrey, accompanied only by the almoner of the  convent.    \"Peace to you, my son,\" he said, as Wulf bowed respectfully to him,  \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],[0,"Milton (#6)"],[1,"again towards the level of  inspiration which it had once attained in _Lycidas_. And in the  development of the Miltonic genius this wonderful dirge marks the  culminating point. As the twin idylls of 1632 show a great advance  upon the _Ode on the Nativity_ (1629), the growth of the poetic mind  during the five years which follow 1632 is registered in _Lycidas_.  Like the _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_, _Lycidas_ is laid out on the  lines of the accepted pastoral fiction; like them it offers exquisite  touches of idealised rural life. But _Lycidas_ opens up a deeper vein  of feeling, a patriot passion so vehement and dangerous, that, like  that which stirred the Hebrew prophet, it is compelled to veil itself  from power, or from sympathy, in utterance made purposely enigmatical.  The passage which begins \"Last came and last did go\", raises in us a  thrill of awe-struck expectation which. I can only compare with that  excited by the Cassandra of Aeschylus's _Agamemnon_. For the reader to  feel this, he must have present in memory the circumstances of England  in 1637. He must place himself as far as possible in the situation of  a contemporary. The study of Milton's poetry compels the study of his  time; and Professor Masson's six volumes are not too much to enable  us to understand that there were real causes for the intense passion  which glows underneath the poet's words--a passion which unexplained  would be thought to be intrusive.    The historical exposition must be gathered from the English history of  the period, which may be read in Professor Masson's excellent summary.  All I desire to point out here is, that in _Lycidas_, Milton's  original picturesque vein is for the first time crossed with one  of quite another sort, stern, determined, obscurely indicative of  suppressed passion, and the resolution to do or die. The fanaticism of  the covenanter and the sad grace of Petrarch seem to meet in Milton's  monody. Yet these opposites, instead of neutralising each other, are  blended into one harmonious whole by the presiding, but invisible,  genius of the poet. The conflict between the old cavalier world--the  years of gaiety and festivity of a splendid and pleasure-loving court,  and the new puritan world into which love and pleasure were not to  enter--this conflict which was commencing in the social life of  England, is also begun in Milton's own breast, and is reflected in  _Lycidas_.        For we were nurs'd upon the self-same hill.    Here is the sweet mournfulness of the Spenserian time, upon whose joys  Death is the only intruder. Pass onward a little, and you are in presence  of the tremendous        Two-handed engine at the door,    the terror of which is enhanced by its obscurity. We are very sure  that the avenger is there, though we know not who he is. In these  thirty lines we have the preluding mutterings of the storm which was  to sweep away mask and revel and song, to inhibit the drama, and  suppress poetry. In the earlier poems Milton's muse has sung in the  tones of the age that is passing away; the poet is, except in his  austere chastity, a cavalier. Though even in _L'Allegro_ Dr. Johnson  truly detects \"some melancholy in his mirth.\" In _Lycidas_, for a  moment, the tones of both ages, the past and the coming, are combined,  and then Milton leaves behind him for ever the golden age, and one  half of his poetic genius. He never fulfilled the promise with which  _Lycidas_ concludes, \"Tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new.\"          CHAPTER III.    JOURNEY TO ITALY.      Before 1632 Milton had begun to learn Italian. His mind, just then  open on all sides to impressions from books, was peculiarly attracted  by Italian poetry. The language grew to be loved for its own sake.  Saturated as he was with Dante and Petrarch, Tasso and Ariosto, the  desire arose to let the ear drink in the music of Tuscan speech.    The \"unhappy gift of beauty,\" which has attracted the spoiler of all  ages to the Italian peninsula, has ever exerted, and still exerts, a  magnetic force on every cultivated mind. Manifold are the sources of  this fascination now. The scholar and the artist, the antiquarian and  the historian, the architect and the lover of natural scenery, alike  find here the amplest gratification of their tastes. This is so still;  but in the sixteenth century the Italian cities were the only homes  of an ancient and decaying civilization, Not insensible to other  impressions, it was specially the desire of social converse with the  living poets and men of taste--a feeble generation, but one still  nourishing the traditions of the great poetic age--which drew Milton  across the Alps.    In April, 1637, Milton's mother had died; but his younger brother,  Christopher, had come to live, with his wife, in the paternal home at  Horton. Milton, the father, was not unwilling that his son should have  his foreign tour, as a part of that elaborate education by which he  was qualifying himself for his doubtful vocation. The cost was not  to stand in the way, considerable as it must have been. Howell's  estimate, in his _Instructions for Forreine Travel_, 1642, was 300 l.  a year for the tourist himself, and 50 l. for his man, a sum equal to  about 1000 l. at present.    Among the letters of introduction with which Milton provided himself,  one was from the aged Sir Henry Wotton, Provost of Eton, in Milton's  immediate neighbourhood. Sir Henry, who had lived a long time in  Italy, impressed upon his young friend the importance of discretion on  the point of religion, and told him the story which he always told to  travellers who asked his advice. \"At Siena I was tabled in the house  of one Alberto Scipioni, an old Roman courtier in dangerous times....  At my departure for Rome I had won confidence enough to beg his advice  how I might carry myself securely there, without offence of others,  or of mine own conscience. 'Signor Arrigo mio,' says he, '_pensieri  stretti ed il viso sciolto_ (thoughts close, countenance open) will go  safely over the whole world.'\" Though the intensity of the Catholic  reaction had somewhat relaxed in Italy, the deportment of a Protestant  in the countries which were terrorised by the Inquisition was a matter  which demanded much circumspection. Sir H. Wotton spoke from his own  experience of far more rigorous times than those of the Barberini  Pope. But he may have noticed, even in his brief acquaintance with  Milton, a fearless presumption of speech which was just what was most  likely to bring him into trouble, The event proved that the hint was  not misplaced. For at Rome itself, in the very lion's den, nothing  could content the young zealot but to stand up for his Protestant  creed. Milton would not do as Peter Heylin did, who, when asked as to  his religion, replied that he was a Catholic, which, in a Laudian, was  but a natural equivoque. Milton was resolute in his religion at Rome,  so much so that many were deterred from showing him the civilities  they were prepared to offer. His rule, he says, was \"not of my own  accord to introduce in those places conversation about religion,  but, if interrogated respecting the faith, then, whatsoever I should  suffer, to dissemble nothing. What I was, if any one asked, I  concealed from no one; if any one in the very city of the Pope  attacked the orthodox religion, I defended it most freely.\" Beyond the  statement that the English Jesuits were indignant, we hear of no evil  consequences of this imprudence. Perhaps the Jesuits saw that Milton  was of the stuff that would welcome martyrdom, and were sick of the  affair of Galileo, which had terribly damaged the pretensions of their  church.    Milton arrived in Paris April or May, 1638. He received civilities  from the English ambassador, Lord Scudamore, who at his request gave  him an introduction to Grotius. Grotius, says Phillips, \"took Milton's  visit kindly, and gave him entertainment suitable to his worth, and  the high commendations he had heard of him.\" We have no other record  of his stay of many days in Paris, though A. Wood supposes that \"the  manners and graces of that place were not agreeable to his mind.\" It  was August before he reached Florence, by way of Nice and Genoa, and  in Florence he spent the two months which we now consider the most  impossible there, the months of August and September. Nor did he  find, as he would find now, the city deserted by the natives. We hear  nothing of Milton's impressions of the place, but of the men whom he  met there he retained always a lively and affectionate remembrance.  The learned and polite Florentines had not fled to the hills from the  stifling heat and blinding glare of the Lung' Arno, but seem to have  carried on their literary meetings in defiance of climate. This  was the age of academies--an institution, Milton says, \"of most  praiseworthy effect, both for the cultivation of polite letters  and the keeping up of friendships.\" Florence had five or six such  societies, the Florentine, the Delia Crusca, the Svogliati,  the Apotisti, &c. It is easy, and usual in our day, to speak  contemptuously of the literary tone of these academies, fostering,  as they did, an amiable and garrulous intercourse of reciprocal  compliment, and to contrast them unfavourably with our societies for  severe research. They were at least evidence of culture, and served to  keep alive the traditions of the more masculine Medicean age. And  that the members of these associations were not unaware of their own  degeneracy and of its cause, we learn from Milton himself. For as  soon as they found that they were safe with the young Briton, they  disclosed their own bitter hatred of the church's yoke which they had  to bear. \"I have sate among their learned men,\" Milton wrote in 1644,  \"and been counted happy to be born in such a place of philosophic  freedom as they supposed England was, while themselves did nothing  but bemoan"]]]
