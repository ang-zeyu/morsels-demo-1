Finally there were so many Greek cities in    southern Italy that it was named \"Great Greece.\" The Greeks also made    settlements in what is now southern France and eastern Spain. The    principal one was Massilia, or Marseilles. Through the traders of this    city the ancient world obtained a supply of tin from Britain, a country    which is now called England.    GREEK COLONIES AS CENTERS OF CIVILIZATION. The Greeks in these    colonies traded with the natives whose villages were near by, and many    of the natives learned to live like the Greeks. In this way the Greeks    became teachers of civilization, and the Greek world, which at first was    made up of cities on the shores of the Aegean Sea, was spread from place    to place along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea.      [Illustration: A GREEK TRIREME]    GREEK SHIPS. The ships of the Greeks were very different from    modern vessels. Of course they were not driven by steam, nor did they    rely as much on sails as modern sailing ships do. They had sails, but    were driven forward mostly by their oars. The trireme, or ordinary    war-ship, had its oars arranged in three banks, fifty men rowing at    once. After these had rowed several hours, or a \"watch,\" another fifty    took their places, and finally a third fifty, so that the ships could be    rowed at high speed all the time. With the aid of its two sails a    trireme is said to have gone one hundred and fifty miles in a day and a    night. These boats were about one hundred and twenty feet long and    fifteen feet wide. They could be rowed in shallow water, but were not    high enough to ride heavy seas safely. They had a sharp beak, which,    driven against an enemy's ship, would break in its sides. The Greek    grain ships and freight boats were heavier and more capable of enduring    rough weather.      [Illustration: ALEXANDER THE GREAT After the bust in the    Capitoline Museum, Rome]    ALEXANDER THE GREAT, KING OF MACEDON FROM 336 TO 323 B.C. Greek    ways of living were also carried eastward as well as westward. The    enlargement of the Greek world in this direction was due to Alexander    the Great, the most skilful soldier and the ablest leader of men among    all the Greeks. Alexander was king of Macedon, and like the earlier    Greeks he regarded the Persians as his enemies, and made war upon them.    After conquering the Persians he marched across western Asia until he    had reached the Indus River in India. He was a builder of cities as well    as a conqueror. He founded seventy cities, and sixteen of them were    named for him. The most important was the Alexandria which is still the    chief seaport of Egypt. Greek became the language commonly spoken    throughout the lands near the eastern Mediterranean. This is the reason    why in later times the New Testament was written in Greek.    ALEXANDRIA. Of this Greek world Athens ceased to be the center and    Alexandria took its place. At Alexandria there was a great library which    contained over five hundred thousand volumes or rolls. There also was    the museum or university, in which many learned men were at work. The    best known of these men was Euclid, who perfected the mathematics which    we call geometry, and Ptolemy, whose ideas about geography and the shape    and size of the globe Columbus carefully studied before he set out on    his great voyage. Alexandria was also a center of trade and commerce.    From Alexandria, because its ships were the first foreign ships to be    admitted to a Roman port, the Romans gained their liking for many of the    beautiful things which the Greeks made.

Death of Alexander the Great, 323 B.C.          CHAPTER V      NEW RIVALS OF THE GREEKS    THE GREEK COLONIES AND THE CARTHAGINIANS. The Greek colonies were    sometimes in danger of being attacked by the native tribes whose lands    they had seized or by the wilder tribes that dwelt further from the    coast. In Sicily their most dangerous neighbors were the Carthaginians    at the western end of the island. The chief town of these people was    Carthage, situated opposite Sicily in northern Africa in what is now    Tunis. The Carthaginians were emigrants from Tyre and other cities of    Phoenicia on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, and because of    their many ships held control of a large part of the western    Mediterranean. They had colonies even in Spain, where in very early    times Phoenician traders had gone to obtain gold and silver.    THE GREEKS AND THE ROMANS. In Italy the most dangerous neighbors of    the Greek colonists were the Romans, who lived half-way up the western    side of the peninsula along the river Tiber. The history of the Romans,    like the history of the Greeks, is full of interesting and wonderful    tales. Some of them are legends, such as every people likes to tell    about its early history. They relate how the city was founded by two    brothers, Romulus and Remus; how Horatius defended the bridge across the    Tiber against the hosts of the exiled Tarquin king; how the farmer    Cincinnatus, having been made leader or dictator, in sixteen days drove    off the neighboring tribes which were attacking the Romans and then went    back to his plough.    THE GAULS BURN ROME, 390 B.C. The Romans told stories of their    defeats as well as of their victories. One of these tells how hosts of    Gauls, a people of the same race as the forefathers of the French,    streamed southward from the valley of the Po. The Romans were alarmed by    such tall men, with fierce eyes, and fair, flowing hair, whose swords    crashed through the frail Roman helmets. They sent a large army to stop    the invaders, but in the battle, which was fought only twelve miles from    Rome, this army was destroyed.      The few defenders that were left withdrew to the Capitoline, the    steepest of the hills over which the city had spread. Some of the older    senators and several priests scorned to seek a refuge from the fury of    the barbarians, and took their seats quietly in ivory chairs in the    market place or Forum at the foot of the Capitoline hill. The Gauls at    first gazed in wonder at the strange sight of the motionless figures.    When one of them attempted to stroke the white beard of a senator, the    senator struck him with his staff; then the Gauls fell upon senators and    priests and slew them.      [Illustration: CLIFF OF THE CAPITOLINE HILL]      The sides of the Capitoline hill were so steep that for a long time the    Gauls were baffled in their attempts to seize it. At last they    discovered a path, and one dark night were on the point of scaling the    height when some geese, sacred to the goddess Juno, cackled and flapped    their wings until the garrison was aroused and the Gauls hurled headlong    down the precipice. The garrison was saved, but the city was burned.    This happened in Rome just one hundred years after the battle of    Marathon in Greece.    THE CAUDINE FORKS. Another adventure did not have so happy an    ending. The Romans were at war with the Samnites, a tribe living on the    slopes of the Apennines, who were continually attacking the Greek cities    on the coast. The war was caused by the attempt of the Romans to protect    one of the Greek cities. The Roman generals, with a large army, in    making their way into the Samnite country attempted to march through a    narrow gorge which broadened out into a plain and then was closed again    at the farther end by another gorge. When they reached this second gorge    they found the road blocked by fallen trees and heaps of stones. They    also saw Samnites on the heights above them. In alarm they hastened to    retrace their steps, only to find the other entrance closed in the same    way. After vain attempts to force a passage or to scale the surrounding    heights they were obliged to surrender.      [Illustration: THE REGION OF THE CAUDINE FORKS]      [Illustration: ITALY BEFORE THE GROWTH OF ROMAN POWER]      The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9903"],[0,"Way of the Lawless (#6)"],[1,"peak; her only movement was  to drag up the coverlet of the bed and hold it against the base of  her throat.    Andy drew off his hat and stepped a little closer. \"Do you know me?\" he  asked.    He watched her as she strove to speak, but if her lips stirred they made  no sound. It tortured him to see her terror, and yet he would not have  had her change. This crystal pallor or a flushed joy--in one of the two  she was most beautiful.    \"You saw me in Martindale,\" he continued. \"I am the blacksmith. Do you  remember?\"    She nodded, still watching him with those haunted eyes.    \"I saw you for the split part of a second,\" said Andy, \"and you stopped  my heart. I've come to see you for two minutes; I swear I mean you no  harm. Will you let me have those two minutes for talk?\" Again she  nodded. But he could see that the terror was being tempered a little in  her face. She was beginning to think, to wonder. It seemed a natural  thing for Andy to go forward a pace closer to the bed, but, lest that  should alarm her, it seemed also natural for him to drop upon one knee.  It brought the muzzle of the revolver jarringly home against the floor.    The girl heard that sound of metal and it shook her; but it requires a  very vivid imagination to fear a man upon his knees. And now that she  could look directly into his face, she saw that he was only a boy, not  more than two or three years older than herself. For the first time she  remembered the sooty figure which had stood in the door of the  blacksmith shop. The white face against the tawny smoke of the shop;  that had attracted her eyes before. It was the same white face now, but  subtly changed. A force exuded from him; indeed, he seemed neither  young nor old.    She heard him speaking in a voice not louder than a whisper, rapid,  distinct.    \"When you came through the town you waked me up like a whiplash,\" he was  saying. \"When you left I kept thinking about you. Then along came a  trouble. I killed a man. A posse started after me. It's on my heels, but  I had to see you again. Do you understand?\"    A ghost of color was going up her throat, staining her cheeks.    \"I had to see you,\" he repeated. \"It's my last chance. Tomorrow they  may get me. Two hours from now they may have me salted away with lead.  But before I kick out I had to have one more look at you. So I swung out  of my road and came straight to this house. I came up the stairs. I went  into a room down the hall and made a man tell me where to find you.\"    There was a flash in the eyes of the girl like the wink of sun on a bit  of quartz on a far-away hillside, but it cut into the speech of Andrew  Lanning. \"He told you where to find me?\" she asked in a voice no louder  than the swift, low voice of Andy. But what a world of scorn!    \"He had a gun shoved into the hollow of his throat,\" said Andy. \"He had  to tell--two doors down the hall--\"    \"It was Charlie!\" said the girl softly. She seemed to forget her fear.  Her head raised as she looked at Andy. \"The other man--the one  you--why--\"    \"The man I killed doesn't matter,\" said Andy. \"Nothing matters except  that I've got this minute here with you.\"    \"But where will you go? How will you escape?\"    \"I'll go to death, I guess,\" said Andy quietly. \"But I'll have a grin  for Satan when he lets me in. I've beat 'em, even if they catch me.\"    The coverlet dropped from her breast; her hand was suspended with stiff  fingers. There had been a sound as of someone stumbling on the stairway,  the unmistakable slip of a heel and the recovery; then no more sound.  Andy was on his feet. She saw his face whiten, and then there was a  glitter in his eyes, and she knew that the danger was nothing to him.  But Anne Withero whipped out of her bed.    \"Did you hear?\"    \"I tied and gagged him,\" said Andy, \"but he's broken loose, and now he's  raising the house on the quiet.\"    For an instant they stood listening, staring at each other.    \"They--they're coming up the hall,\" whispered the girl. \"Listen!\"    It was no louder than a whisper from without--the creak of a board.  Andrew Lanning slipped to the door and turned the key in the lock. When  he rejoined her in the middle of the room he gave her the key.    \"Let 'em in if you want to,\" he said.    But the girl caught his arm, whispering: \"You can get out that window  onto the top of the roof below, then a drop to the ground. But hurry  before they think to guard that way!\" \"Anne!\" called a voice suddenly  from the hall.    Andy threw up the window, and, turning toward the door, he laughed his  defiance and his joy.    \"Hurry!\" she was demanding. A great blow fell on the door of her room,  and at once there was shouting in the hall: \"Pete, run outside and watch  the window!\"    \"Will you go?\" cried the girl desperately.    He turned toward the window. He turned back like a flash and swept her  close to him.    \"Do you fear me?\" he whispered.    \"No,\" said the girl.    \"Will you remember me?\"    \"Forever!\"    \"God bless you,\" said Andy as he leaped through the window. She saw him  take the slope of the roof with one stride; she heard the thud of his  feet on the ground below. Then a yell from without, shrill and high  and sharp.    When the door fell with a crash, and three men were flung into the room,  Charles Merchant saw her standing in her nightgown by the open window.  Her head was flung back against the wall, her eyes closed, and one hand  was pressed across her lips.    \"He's out the window. Down around the other way,\" cried Charles  Merchant.    The stampede swept out of the room. Charles was beside her.    She knew that vaguely, and that he was speaking, but not until he  touched her shoulder did she hear the words: \"Anne, are you  unhurt--has--for heaven's sake speak, Anne. What's happened?\"    She reached up and put his hand away.    \"Charles,\" she said, \"call them back. Don't let them follow him!\"    \"Are you mad, dear?\" he asked. \"That murdering--\"    He found a tigress in front of him. \"If they hurt a hair of his head,  Charlie, I'm through with you. I'll swear that!\"    It stunned Charles Merchant. And then he went stumbling from the room.    His cow-punchers were out from the bunk house already; the guests and  his father were saddling or in the saddle.    \"Come back!\" shouted Charles Merchant. \"Don't follow him. Come back! No  guns. He's done no harm.\"    Two men came around the corner of the house, dragging a limp figure  between them.    \"Is this no harm?\" they asked. \"Look at Pete, and then talk.\"    They lowered the tall, limp figure of the man in pajamas to the ground;  his face was a crimson smear.    \"Is he dead?\" asked Charles Merchant.    \"No move out of him,\" they answered.    Other people, most of them on horseback, were pouring back to learn the  meaning of the strange call from Charles Merchant.    \"I can't tell you what I mean,\" he was saying in explanation. \"But you,  dad, I'll be able to tell you. All I can say is that he mustn't be  followed--unless Pete here--\"    The eyes of Pete opportunely opened. He looked hazily about him.    \"Is he gone?\" asked Pete.    \"Yes.\"    \"Thank the Lord!\"    \"Did you see him? What's he like?\"    \"About seven feet tall. I saw him jump off the roof of the house. I was  right under him. Tried to get my gun on him, but he came up like a wild  cat and went straight at me. Had his fist in my face before I could get  my finger on the trigger. And then the earth came up and slapped me in  the face.\" \"There he goes!\" cried some one.    The sky was now of a brightness not far from day, and, turning east, in  the direction pointed out, Charles Merchant saw a horseman ride over a  hilltop, a black form against the coloring horizon. He was moving  leisurely, keeping his horse at the cattle pony's lope. Presently he  dipped away out of sight.    John Merchant dropped his hand on the shoulder of his son. \"What is it?\"  he asked.    \"Heaven knows! Not I!\"    \"Here are more people! What's this? A night of surprise parties?\"    Six riders came through the trees, rushing their horses, and John  Merchant saw Bill Dozier's well-known, lanky form in the lead. He  brought his horse from a dead run to a halt in the space of a single  jump and a slide. The next moment he was demanding fresh mounts.    \"Can you give 'em to me, Merchant? But what's all this?\"    \"You make your little talk,\" said Merchant, \"and then I'll make mine.\"    \"I'm after Andy Lanning. He's left a gent more dead than alive back in  Martindale, and I want him. Can you give me fresh horses for me and my  boys, Merchant?\"    \"But the man wasn't dead? He wasn't dead?\" cried the voice of a girl.  The group opened; Bill Dozier found himself facing a bright-haired girl  wrapped to the throat in a long coat, with slippers on her feet.    \"Not dead and not alive,\" he answered. \"Just betwixt and between.\"    \"Thank God!\" whispered the girl. \"Thank God!\"    There was only one man in the group who should not have heard that  whispered phrase, and that man was Charles Merchant. He was standing  at her side.          CHAPTER 8      It took less than five minutes for the deputy sheriff to mount his men;  he himself had the pick of the corral, a dusty roan, and, as he drew the  cinch taut, he turned to find Charles Merchant at his side.    \"Bill,\" said the young fellow, \"what sort of a man is this Lanning?\"    \"He's been a covered card, partner,\" said Bill Dozier. \"He's been a  covered card that seemed pretty good. Now he's in the game, and he looks  like the rest of the Lannings--a good lump of daring and defiance. Why  d'you ask?\"    \"Are you keen to get him, Bill?\" continued Charlie Merchant eagerly.    \"I could stand it. Again, why?\"    \"You'd like a little gun play with that fellow?\"    \"I wouldn't complain none.\"    \"Ah? One more thing. Could you use a bit of ready cash?\"    \"I ain't pressed,\" said Bill Dozier. \"On the other hand, I ain't of a  savin' nature.\"    Then he added: \"Get it out, Charlie. I"]]]
