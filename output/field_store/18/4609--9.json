In these difficulties he began to think of  exciting a revolt of his countrymen; and while revolving the project he  received a message from his father-in-law, Histiaeus, urging him to  this very step.  Afraid of trusting any one with so dangerous a  message, Histiaeus had shaved the head of a trusty slave, branded upon  it the necessary words, and as soon as the hair had grown again sent  him off to Miletus.  His only motive for urging the Ionians to revolt  was the desire of escaping from captivity at Susa, thinking that Darius  would set him at liberty in order to put down an insurrection of his  countrymen.  The message from Histiaeus fixed the wavering resolution  of Aristagoras.  He forthwith called together the leading citizens of  Miletus, laid before them the project of revolt, and asked them for  advice.  They all approved of the scheme, with the exception of  Hecataeus, one of the earliest Greek historians.  Aristagoras laid down  the supreme power in Miletus, and nominally resigned to the people the  management of their own affairs.  A democratical form of government was  established in the other Greek cities of Asia, which thereupon openly  revolted from Persia (B.C. 500).    Aristagoras now resolved to cross over to Greece, in order to solicit  assistance.  The Spartans, to whom he first applied, refused to take  any part in the war; but at Athens he met with a very different  reception.  The Athenians sympathised with the Ionians as their kinsmen  and colonists, and were incensed against the satrap Artaphernes, who  had recently commanded them to recall Hippias.  Accordingly they voted  to send a squadron of twenty ships to the assistance of the Ionians;  and in the following year (B.C. 499) this fleet, accompanied by five  ships from Eretria in Euboea, crossed the AEgean.  The troops landed at  Ephesus, and, being reinforced by a strong body, of Ionians, marched  upon Sardis.  Artaphernes was taken unprepared; and not having  sufficient troops to man the walls, he retired into the citadel,  leaving the town a prey to the invaders.  Accordingly they entered it  unopposed; and while engaged in pillage, one of the soldiers set fire  to a house.  As most of the houses were built of wickerwork and  thatched with straw, the flames rapidly spread, and in a short time the  whole city was in flames.  The Greeks, on their return to the coast,  were overtaken by a large Persian force and defeated with great  slaughter.  The Athenians hastened on board their ships and sailed home.    When Darius heard of the burning of Sardis, he burst into a paroxysm of  rage.  It was against the obscure strangers who had dared to burn one  of his capitals that his wrath was chiefly directed.  \"The Athenians!\"  he exclaimed, \"who are they?\"  Upon being informed he took his bow,  shot an arrow high into the air, saying, \"Grant me, Jove, to take  vengeance upon the Athenians!\" And he charged one of his attendants to  remind him thrice every day at dinner \"Sire, remember the Athenians.\"  Meantime the insurrection spread to the Greek cities in Cyprus, as well  as to those on the Hellespont and the Propontis, and seemed to promise  permanent independence to the Asiatic Greeks; but they were no match  for the whole power of the Persian empire, which was soon brought  against them.  Cyprus was subdued, and siege laid to the cities upon  the coast of Asia.  Aristagoras now began to despair, and basely  deserted his countrymen, whom he had led into peril. Collecting a large  body of Milesians, he set sail for the Thracian coast, where he was  slain under the walls of a town to which he had laid siege.  Soon after  his departure, his father-in-law, Histiaeus came down to the coast.  The artful Greek not only succeeded in removing the suspicions which  Darius first entertained respecting him, but he persuaded the king to  send him into Ionia, in order to assist the Persian generals in  suppressing the rebellion.  Artaphernes, however, was not so easily  deceived as his master, and plainly accused Histiaeus of treachery when  the latter arrived at Sardis.  \"I will tell you how the facts stand\"  said Artaphernes to Histiaeus; \"it was you who made the shoe, and  Aristagoras has put it on.\"  Finding himself unsafe at Sardis, he  escaped to the island of Chios; but he was regarded with suspicion by  all parties.  At length he obtained eight galleys from Lesbos, with  which he sailed towards Byzantium, and carried on piracies as well  against the Grecian as the barbarian vessels.  This unprincipled  adventurer met with a traitor's death.  Having landed on the coast of  Mysia, he was surprised by a Persian force and made prisoner.  Being  carried to Sardis, Artaphernes at once caused him to be crucified, and  sent his head to Darius, who ordered it to be honourably buried,  condemning the ignominious execution of the man who had once saved the  life of the Great King.    In the sixth year of the revolt (B.C. 495), when several Grecian cities  had already been taken by the Persians, Artaphernes laid siege to  Miletus by sea and by land.  A naval engagement took place at Lade a  small island off Miletus, which decided the fate of the war.  The  Samians deserted at the commencement of the battle, and the Ionian  fleet was completely defeated.  Miletus was soon afterwards taken, and  was treated with signal severity. Most of the males were slain; and the  few who escaped the sword were carried with the women and children into  captivity (B.C. 494).  The other Greek cities in Asia and the  neighbouring islands were treated with the same cruelty.  The islands  of Chios, Lesbos, and Tenedos were swept of their inhabitants; and the  Persian fleet sailed up to the Hellespont and Propontis, carrying with  it fire and sword.  The Athenian Miltiades only escaped falling into  the power of the Persians by a rapid flight to Athens.    The subjugation of Ionia was now complete.  This was the third time  that the Asiatic Greeks had been conquered by a foreign power:  first  by the Lydian Croesus; secondly by the generals of Cyrus; and lastly by  those of Darius.  It was from the last that they suffered most, and  they never fully recovered their former prosperity.    Darius was now at liberty to take vengeance upon the Athenians. He  appointed Mardonius to succeed Artaphernes as satrap in western Asia,  and he placed under his command a large armament, with injunctions to  bring to Susa those Athenians and Eretrians who had insulted the  authority of the Great King.  Mardonius, after crossing the Hellespont,  commenced his march through Thrace and Macedonia, subduing, as he went  along, the tribes which had not yet submitted to the Persian power.  He  ordered the fleet to double the promontory of Mount Athos, and join the  land forces at the head of the gulf of Therma; but one of the  hurricanes which frequently blow off this dangerous coast overtook the  Persian fleet, destroyed 300 vessels and drowned or dashed upon the  rocks 20,000 men.  Meantime the land forces of Mardonius had suffered  so much from an attack made upon them by a Thracian tribe, that he  could not proceed farther.  He led his army back across the Hellespont,  and returned to the Persian court covered with shame and grief (B.C.  492).    The failure of this expedition did not shake the resolution of Darius.  He began to make preparations for another attempt on a still larger  scale, and meantime sent heralds to most of the Grecian states to  demand from each earth and water as the symbol of submission.  Such  terror had the Persians inspired by their recent conquest of Ionia,  that a large number of the Grecian cities at once complied with the  demand; but the Athenians cast the herald into a deep pit, and the  Spartans threw him into a well bidding him take earth and water from  thence.    In the spring of B.C. 490 a large army and fleet were assembled in  Cilicia, and the command was given to Datis, a Median, and Artaphernes,  son of the satrap of Sardis of that name.  Warned by the recent  disaster of Mardonius in doubling the promontory of Mount Athos, they  resolved to sail straight across the AEgean to Euboea, subduing on  their way the Cyclades.  These islands yielded a ready submission; and  it was not till Datis and Artaphernes reached Euboea that they  encountered any resistance. Eretria defended itself gallantly for six  days, and repulsed the Persians with loss; but on the seventh the gates  were opened to the besiegers by the treachery of two of its leading  citizens. The city was razed to the ground, and the inhabitants were  put in chains.  From Eretria the Persians crossed over to Attica, and  landed on the ever memorable plain of Marathon, a spot which had been  pointed out to them by the despot Hippias, who accompanied the army.    As soon as the news of the fall of Eretria reached Athens, a courier  had been sent to Sparta to solicit assistance.  This was promised; but  the superstition of the Spartans prevented them from setting out  immediately, since it wanted a few days to the full moon, and it was  contrary to their religious customs to commence a march during this  interval.  Meantime the Athenians had marched to Marathon, and were  encamped upon the mountains which surrounded the plain.  They were  commanded, according to the regular custom, by ten generals, one for  each tribe, and by the Polemarch, or third Archon, who down to this  time continued to be a colleague of the generals.  Among these the most  distinguished was Miltiades, who, though but lately a tyrant in the  Chersonesus, had shown such energy and ability, that the Athenians had  elected him one of their commanders upon the approach of the Persian  fleet.  Upon learning the answer which the courier brought from Sparta,  the ten generals were divided in opinion.  Five of them were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20967"],[0,"A Guide to Peterborough Cathedral (#12)"],[1,"whom  the church is dedicated, representing the apostle with the mitre, pall,  keys, and other insignia of the bishop of Rome.    \"The turrets, before mentioned, are divided by the round moulding and  string courses into six stages, which are empannelled in front with  arches of different forms and dimensions. In the first stage from the  ground, and rising from a channelled base, are two lofty pointed arches  resting on slender pillars. In the second stage are four trefoil arches  similarly supported; this range is continued round the facings of the  inner wall immediately over the doorways, and forms the base of the  windows. The third stage contains one pointed arch, intersected by a  pillar in the centre, with curved mouldings, forming two lesser arches;  which last are again subdivided by pillars sustaining one circular arch  in the centre, and segments of arches on the sides.    \"The interstices above contain two trefoil arches, with brackets at the  base for the figures. The mouldings of the outer arch, with the sides  of the pillars and all the sub-divisions, are studded with the  dog-toothed quatrefoil. In the fourth stage, are two deeply recessed  pointed arches, resting on clustered pillars; immediately over these is  a string course of stemmated trefoils, which is continued round the  front, the transepts, and the base of the north-west tower, together  with the more modern base towards the south. In the fifth stage are  four trefoil arches, like those of the second stage: these lie parallel  with those at the base of the pediments, already described, and with  those also of the side transepts. The sixth stage contains four long  and narrow pointed arches, having corbels in the space above, and  resting, like the whole series of arches below, on slender isolated  columns, with prominent foliated capitals: above these is a string  course of rosettes, forming the base of the parapet. Thus far the two  turrets are strictly uniform; but in the parapets, by which they are  surmounted, and in the pinnacles, which terminate the clustered shafts,  there is a marked difference.    \"The parapet of the north turret consists of the wave ornament, with  double featherings and intersections: the pinnacles at the angles are  hexagonal, corbelled at the base of the pyramid with human heads, and  finished above with crockets and finials.    \"The parapet of the south turret contains a series of quatrefoils,  while the pinnacles at the angles are beautifully blended with the  clustered shafts, so as to form a regular and continuous course and  termination; the mouldings are carried up in high pointed pediments,  and from these a cinquefoil arch at each angle, surmounted also by a  pediment, with a quatrefoil in the spandril, connects them with the  spire in the centre, and sustains a lofty triangular pinnacle, which,  like the pediments below, is decorated with crockets and a finial. In  this respect the south spire differs from the other, which has no  connection with the side pinnacles. Both are pierced with pointed  windows in two ranges, four in each range, divided by mullions, and  crowned with crocketted pediments; and the apex of each is terminated  by a finial and a cross, included in the extensive repairs carried on  by the present dean[27] and chapter.    \"The style of these spires, with the parapets and pinnacles, marks them  out as a later work than the turrets beneath; and we may infer from the  similarity of their details to those of the porch, that they formed a  part of the repairs and alterations which the whole front appears to  have undergone when the appendage was inserted; and when the central  window of the nave was enlarged, and that, and the others which now  enliven the inner wall, were filled with perpendicular tracery. The  porch is vaulted with stone, and is entered by an obtuse arch, over  which is an elliptical window, divided by mullions into six lights  under cinquefoil arches, which are again subdivided in the head into  lesser arches.    \"The spandrils formed by the curve of the arch, and the base of the  window, are enriched with circles, clasping shields of arms, and  rosettes with other devices. The arches and windows are bounded by  buttresses, which are broken by offsets and empannelled with niches.  Besides these, the porch is flanked with staircases, one on each side,  forming three parts of an octagon, and leading to an apartment now used  as a library. The summit is closed with an embattled parapet, having a  pediment at each end, and one in the centre. The surface of the walls  is enriched with canopied niches, pilasters, brackets, panel work, and  string courses in all the wildness and profusion which distinguish the  last stage of gothic architecture.    \"Besides the arch before mentioned, the porch has two smaller arches,  north and south, parallel with the piazza formed by the great arches  and piers of the front, and keeping up the communication with its  opposite extremities. Over these also are mullioned windows with blank  interstices.    \"The great window of the nave, the outer arch of which is obviously an  alteration from the original design, is divided by mullions into five  lights,--those of the side aisles into three lights, both under  cinquefoil arches, and the lancet windows of the transepts into two  lights, under trefoil arches: these windows are parted, each by an  embattled transome into an upper and lower range of lights, and the  heads filled with subordinate tracery.    \"The door-ways beneath are exceedingly rich, and in point of execution  and delicacy of detail perhaps the finest portions of the front. The  central door-way is divided by a pillar, rising from a carved  cylindrical base into two smaller arches; but the whole design and  finish cannot be made out, in consequence of the introduction of the  porch, the foundation and butments of which are built against it.    \"The arches of the side door-ways are lined with isolated columns,  receding in the manner of perspective; the ribbed mouldings between  these columns, the interlaced and pendent foliage of the capitals, and  the multiplied mouldings of which the arches above are composed, cannot  be too closely examined, or too much admired. This is that peculiar  style of gothic architecture, in which the beauty of the pointed arch,  with its accompaniments is best discerned; and, therefore, it is that  judges are wont to give it the preference over all subsequent  alterations and refinements. The spaces between these door-ways, like  those of the windows over them, are empannelled with pointed arches,  subdivided by smaller arches, and resting on slender pillars.    \"From the description thus given of this stately front, the reader will  perceive that it was begun in one age, and finished, as we now behold  it, in another. Some discrepancies of style may therefore be expected  to present themselves, but these are so eclipsed by the grandeur in its  leading features, that the eye takes in the whole as a single  conception, and overlooks, in its contemplation of such a magnificent  association of objects, the marks of difference that exist between the  efforts of earlier and later genius.\"[28]--The Purbeck pillar, which  divides the greater arch of the West door into two lesser arches, has a  curiously sculptured base, apparently representing a sinner being  tormented by devils.    [Sidenote: Gateway and Deanery.]    As we cross the square to the north-eastern side of the church, we pass  another gateway, which leads into the deanery, which is a fine specimen  of architecture, and bears the monogram of its builder, viz.--the  letter R, a kirk, and a tun, [R. Kirkton] and we then enter at once  into the      Burial Ground.    [Sidenote: Exterior north, east, and south.]    A finer association of beautiful and mournful objects could not well be  imagined than is here presented to us. The most graceful trees,  arranged in delightful groups, hang over the decayed tombs, which are  carpeted to their base by a green sward, covered with flowers. As we  pass along, we get a view of the deanery, and at the end of the eastern  part of the church we see Tout Hill with the Training College for  schoolmasters on the left, and the pretty villa in the vineyard, with a  splendid avenue of old elm trees leading to it by a broad gravel walk.  We pass likewise the large painted window, and as we turn the eastern  end of the building, we catch a glimpse of the ruins of the infirmary  and great hall, with their magnificent arches and ivy clad columns.  Proceeding round to the southern side of the cathedral, we enter the  square, where are the ruins of the cloisters, through a fine old  door-way with a pointed arch, surmounting others of a circular form,  and enriched with sculptural mouldings and figures. The southern and  western walls of the cloisters remain, and contain a singular variety  of tracery, mouldings, columns, and door-ways. Two door-ways to the  southern aisles of the nave are also seen in the cloisters--one having  a semicircular arch, with archivolt mouldings, enriched with the  chevron and other Norman ornaments; the other in the pointed or gothic  style, with raised mouldings, and supported by slender shafts at the  sides.[29] At the southern extremity of the cloisters is another  door-way of the same style and character as that by which we entered  them, which leads through the bishop's garden to the palace.[30] Passing  along the western wall of the cloisters we go through a plain Norman  door-way, which brings us again, by a narrow passage, to the west front  of the cathedral.      The Dimensions    _Of the several parts of the Cathedral are as follows:--_    The breadth of the west front, measuring from corner to corner on the  outside of it, is 156 feet.    The length of the whole cathedral, measured on the outside of it, is  471 feet. In this measurement are included the most prominent"]]]
