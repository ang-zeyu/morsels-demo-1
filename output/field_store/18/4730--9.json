Order the stock from the  mill ready cut to length, squared and sanded. The following pieces will  be needed:      4 posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 28 in.    4 side rails, 3/4 by 2 by 16 in.    4 end rails, 3/4 by 2 by 7 in.    2 door rails, 3/4 by 2 by 15 in.    2 door rails, 3/4 by 2 by 22-3/4 in.    1 door panel, 1/4 by 11-1/2 by 19-1/4 in.    1 back panel, 1/4 by 15-1/2 by 23-1/4 in.    2 end panels, 1/4 by 6-1/2 by 23-1/4 in.    2 pieces for top and bottom, 1/2 by 6-3/4 by 15-3/4 in.    [Illustration: Medicine Cabinet Complete]    Square the four posts and bevel the tops as shown.    [Illustration: Details of Medicine Cabinet]    Cut grooves in them with a plow plane to receive the 1/4-in. panels. The  tenons on the rails are cut 1/4 in. wide and fit into the grooves in the  posts the same as the panels. The rails have grooves cut at the inside  edges for the panels. The front posts do not have grooves on the inside  but have two mortises, one at each end for the top and bottom rails. The  back has a panel fitted in the same as the ends. See that the pieces  fit together perfectly square and tight, then glue them together and  give it time to dry.    The top and bottom boards are next put in place. The top is placed in  the center of the top rails while the bottom is put even with the lower  edge of the bottom rails, as shown in the detail drawing. The door frame  is mitered at the corners and rabbeted on the inner edge to take the  panel. A mirror can be used in place of the panel if desired. Suitable  hinges and a catch, which can be purchased at a hardware store, should  be supplied for the door.    The shelves are of soft wood and are to be arranged to suit the maker.  Before applying a finish, go over the cabinet with fine sandpaper and  remove all the surplus glue about the joints and the rough spots, else  the finish will not take evenly. The finish can be any one of the many  different kinds supplied by the trade for this purpose.

By daily life deteriorated,  Awhile this beauty captivated,  And that no longer could inspire.  Slowly exhausted by desire,  Yet satiated with success,  In solitude or worldly din,  He heard his soul's complaint within,  With laughter smothered weariness:  And thus he spent eight years of time,  Destroyed the blossom of his prime.    IV    Though beauty he no more adored,  He still made love in a queer way;  Rebuffed--as quickly reassured,  Jilted--glad of a holiday.  Without enthusiasm he met  The fair, nor parted with regret,  Scarce mindful of their love and guile.  Thus a guest with composure will  To take a hand at whist oft come:  He takes his seat, concludes his game,  And straight returning whence he came,  Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,  And in the morning doth not know  Whither that evening he will go.    V    However, Tania's letter reading,  Eugene was touched with sympathy;  The language of her girlish pleading  Aroused in him sweet reverie.  He called to mind Tattiana's grace,  Pallid and melancholy face,  And in a vision, sinless, bright,  His spirit sank with strange delight.  May be the empire of the sense,  Regained authority awhile,  But he desired not to beguile  Such open-hearted innocence.  But to the garden once again  Wherein we lately left the twain.    VI    Two minutes they in silence spent,  Oneguine then approached and said:  \"You have a letter to me sent.  Do not excuse yourself. I read  Confessions which a trusting heart  May well in innocence impart.  Charming is your sincerity,  Feelings which long had ceased to be  It wakens in my breast again.  But I came not to adulate:  Your frankness I shall compensate  By an avowal just as plain.  An ear to my confession lend;  To thy decree my will I bend.    VII    \"If the domestic hearth could bless--  My sum of happiness contained;  If wife and children to possess  A happy destiny ordained:  If in the scenes of home I might  E'en for an instant find delight,  Then, I say truly, none but thee  I would desire my bride to be--  I say without poetic phrase,  Found the ideal of my youth,  Thee only would I choose, in truth,  As partner of my mournful days,  Thee only, pledge of all things bright,  And be as happy--as I might.    VIII    \"But strange am I to happiness;  'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;  Me your perfections would not bless;  I am not worthy them in aught;  And honestly 'tis my belief  Our union would produce but grief.  Though now my love might be intense,  Habit would bring indifference.  I see you weep. Those tears of yours  Tend not my heart to mitigate,  But merely to exasperate;  Judge then what roses would be ours,  What pleasures Hymen would prepare  For us, may be for many a year.    IX    \"What can be drearier than the house,  Wherein the miserable wife  Deplores a most unworthy spouse  And leads a solitary life?  The tiresome man, her value knowing,  Yet curses on his fate bestowing,  Is full of frigid jealousy,  Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.  Such am I. This did ye expect,  When in simplicity ye wrote  Your innocent and charming note  With so much warmth and intellect?  Hath fate apportioned unto thee  This lot in life with stern decree?    X    \"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;  My soul I cannot renovate--  I love you with a brother's love,  Perchance one more affectionate.  Listen to me without disdain.  A maid hath oft, may yet again  Replace the visions fancy drew;  Thus trees in spring their leaves renew  As in their turn the seasons roll.  'Tis evidently Heaven's will  You fall in love again. But still--  Learn to possess more self-control.  Not all will like myself proceed--  And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.\"    XI    Thus did our friend Oneguine preach:  Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,  Attentive listened to his speech,  All breathless and without replies.  His arm he offers. Mute and sad  (_Mechanically_, let us add),  Tattiana doth accept his aid;  And, hanging down her head, the maid  Around the garden homeward hies.  Together they returned, nor word  Of censure for the same incurred;  The country hath its liberties  And privileges nice allowed,  Even as Moscow, city proud.    XII    Confess, O ye who this peruse,  Oneguine acted very well  By poor Tattiana in the blues;  'Twas not the first time, I can tell  You, he a noble mind disclosed,  Though some men, evilly disposed,  Spared him not their asperities.  His friends and also enemies  (One and the same thing it may be)  Esteemed him much as the world goes.  Yes! every one must have his foes,  But Lord! from friends deliver me!  The deuce take friends, my friends, amends  I've had to make for having friends!    XIII    But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss  Dark, unavailing reverie,  I just hint, in parenthesis,  There is no stupid calumny  Born of a babbler in a loft  And by the world repeated oft,  There is no fishmarket retort  And no ridiculous report,  Which your true friend with a sweet smile  Where fashionable circles meet  A hundred times will not repeat,  Quite inadvertently meanwhile;  And yet he in your cause would strive  And loves you as--a relative!    XIV    Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,  Are all your relatives quite well?  Permit me; is it worth the trouble  For your instruction here to tell  What I by relatives conceive?  These are your relatives, believe:  Those whom we ought to love, caress,  With spiritual tenderness;  Whom, as the custom is of men,  We visit about Christmas Day,  Or by a card our homage pay,  That until Christmas comes again  They may forget that we exist.  And so--God bless them, if He list.    XV    In this the love of the fair sex  Beats that of friends and relatives:  In love, although its tempests vex,  Our liberty at least survives:  Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,  The natural fickleness of passion,  The torrent of opinion,  And the fair sex as light as down!  Besides the hobbies of a spouse  Should be respected throughout life  By every proper-minded wife,  And this the faithful one allows,  When in as instant she is lost,--  Satan will jest, and at love's cost.    XVI    Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?  Where is he who doth not deceive?  Who words and actions will adjust  To standards in which we believe?  Oh! who is not calumnious?  Who labours hard to humour us?  To whom are our misfortunes grief  And who is not a tiresome thief?  My venerated reader, oh!  Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,  Spare yourself unavailing pain  And all your love on self bestow;  A worthy object 'tis, and well  I know there's none more amiable.    XVII    But from the interview what flowed?  Alas! It is not hard to guess.  The insensate fire of love still glowed  Nor discontinued to distress  A spirit which for sorrow yearned.  Tattiana more than ever burned  With hopeless passion: from her bed  Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.  Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,  Her smile and maidenly repose,  All vanished as an echo goes.  Across her youth a shade had come,  As when the tempest's veil is drawn  Across the smiling face of dawn.    XVIII    Alas! Tattiana fades away,  Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;  Listless is she the livelong day  Nor interest in aught betrays.  Shaking with serious air the head,  In whispers low the neighbours said:  'Tis time she to the altar went!  But enough! Now, 'tis my intent  The imagination to enliven  With love which happiness extends;  Against my inclination, friends,  By sympathy I have been driven.  Forgive me! Such the love I bear  My heroine, Tattiana dear.    XIX    Vladimir, hourly more a slave  To youthful Olga's beauty bright,  Into delicious bondage gave  His ardent soul with full delight.  Always together, eventide  Found them in darkness side by side,  At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove  Around the meadow and the grove.  And what resulted? Drunk with love,  But with confused and bashful air,  Lenski at intervals would dare,  If Olga smilingly approve,  Dally with a dishevelled tress  Or kiss the border of her dress.    XX    To Olga frequently he would  Some nice instructive novel read,  Whose author nature understood  Better than Chateaubriand did  Yet sometimes pages two or three  (Nonsense and pure absurdity,  For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),  He somewhat blushing would omit:  Far from the rest the pair would creep  And (elbows on the table) they  A game of chess would often play,  Buried in meditation deep,  Till absently Vladimir took  With his own pawn alas! his rook!    XXI    Homeward returning, he at home  Is occupied with Olga fair,  An album, fly-leaf of the tome,  He leisurely adorns for her.  Landscapes thereon he would design,  A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,  Or, with a pen and colours fit,  A dove which on a lyre doth sit;  The \"in memoriam\" pages sought,  Where many another hand had signed  A tender couplet he combined,  A register of fleeting thought,  A flimsy trace of musings past  Which might for many ages last.    XXII    Surely ye all have overhauled  A country damsel's album trim,  Which all her darling friends have scrawled  From first to last page to the rim.  Behold! orthography despising,  Metreless verses recognizing  By friendship how they were abused,  Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.  Upon the opening page ye find:  _Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_  Subscribed, _toujours a vous, Annette;_  And on the last one, underlined:  _Who in thy love finds more delight  Beyond this may attempt to write_.    XXIII    Infallibly you there will find  Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,  And vows will probably be signed:  _Affectionately yours till death_.  Some army poet therein may  Have smuggled his flagitious lay.  In such an album with delight  I would, my friends, inscriptions write,  Because I should be sure, meanwhile,  My verses, kindly meant, would earn  Delighted glances in return;  That afterwards with evil smile  They would not solemnly debate  If"]]]
