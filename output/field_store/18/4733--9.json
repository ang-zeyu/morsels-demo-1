The idea was quite new to her, and that Janie evidently  expected her to be her mother's companion and right hand surprised her.  She had already met with many astonishments at St. Chad's, where most  of the views of life seemed different from her old standards. She  scarcely liked to confess that she was of so little use at home, and  hastily turned the conversation back to her brother Dermot.    \"Do you think if I were to ask Miss Cavendish, she would let him call  to see me?\" she suggested.    Janie shook her head.    \"I'm quite sure she wouldn't,\" she replied. \"The rules are so strict  about visitors. Nobody but our parents is allowed, except an occasional  uncle or aunt--never a brother. You'd better not suggest it.\"    \"Then I shall have to go and see him.\"    \"How could you, Honor? Don't be so unreasonable!\"    \"I thought I might find an opportunity some day,\" said Honor  reflectively. \"One never knows what may turn up. Dear old Dermot! It  would be hard luck to be within two miles of him for a whole term,  without exchanging a single word.\"    \"Well, if you do, you'll get into a far bigger scrape than you'll like.  You'd much better wait until the holidays, when you'll probably both  travel home together,\" advised Janie.    There certainly were no opportunities at Chessington College for paying  calls. Except on half-holidays, the girls seldom went beyond the school  grounds, the large playing-fields providing a wide enough area for  exercise. The members of the Fifth and Sixth Forms were allowed to go  out occasionally, within specified bounds, if they went three together;  but the younger ones had not attained to such a privilege.    \"We mayn't even put our noses through the gate of the quad,\" said  Lettice Talbot, in reply to a question from Honor, who chafed sorely  against the rule; \"not unless we can get a special exeat from Miss  Cavendish, and that's only given once in a blue moon. It's no use  looking volcanic, Paddy! You'll have to grin and bear it.\"    \"It's as bad as being in prison,\" grumbled Honor.    \"Nonsense!\" snapped Maisie Talbot. \"You have cricket or tennis for  nearly two hours every afternoon. What more can you want? I'd rather  play games myself than do anything else.\"    \"You can't expect to do just as you like at school,\" remarked Dorothy  Arkwright, who sometimes joined with Maisie in \"squashing\" Honor.    \"The riding lessons begin next Thursday,\" said Lettice, with an attempt  at consolation. \"They are very jolly. Mr. Townsend always takes the  class a trot over the Tor. You said you were to learn riding?\"    \"It's the one lesson I begged for,\" replied Honor. \"I could have  dispensed with Latin, or German, or mathematics.\"    \"Maisie and I are to begin this term; we're looking forward to it  tremendously!\"    \"You are lucky,\" said Pauline Reynolds enviously. \"I'd give all I  possess to be going with you. I've never ridden anything more  interesting than a rocking-horse, or a donkey on the sands; and one  doesn't get much of a canter for six-pence!\"    \"I believe I'm horribly nervous, and I don't mind confessing it,\"  declared Lettice. \"The idea of being perched on a great, tall horse  makes me shake in my shoes. When it begins to trot I shall drop off--I  know I shall!\"    \"Don't be so silly!\" protested Maisie. \"You can stick on to Teddie at  home all right. Honor Fitzgerald, can you ride?\"    \"Bareback, if you like,\" said Honor. \"Dermot and I used to take our old  pony and practise what we called 'circus performances'. Pixie quite  entered into the spirit of the thing, and would walk along gently while  we stood on his back.\"    \"I hear Mr. Townsend brings very fresh horses,\" said Lettice, with a  shiver of apprehension. \"I do hope he'll choose me a quiet one!\"    \"The fresher the better for me,\" said Honor. \"I'm just longing for a  good gallop.\"    \"But suppose it runs away?\"    \"Then it will have to take me with it. If it's any kind of a beast with  four legs, I'll undertake to make it fly.\"    \"I heard that Mr. Townsend's horses aren't worth the fag of riding,\"  observed Flossie Taylor, who had joined the group.    \"There speaks the voice of envy! You wouldn't say so if you were taking  the lessons,\" retorted Maisie.    \"People who are accustomed to hunt at home don't care about hired  hacks,\" drawled Flossie, in her most supercilious manner.    \"It all depends on the sort of hunting,\" returned Honor, who was never  at a loss. \"If it's only 'hunt the slipper', I'll admit it's not much  of a training, and you might be afraid of your seat.\"    The riding course was a special feature of the summer term at  Chessington. It was an \"extra\", not part of the ordinary school  curriculum, as were the games. A master came from Dunscar, and would  escort select little parties of girls for a trot upon the Tor, a  stretch of moorland not far from the College. Mr. Townsend did not care  to take out many pupils at once, so on the following Thursday afternoon  only seven horses were waiting in the quadrangle. The Talbots, Ruth  Latimer, and Honor represented St. Chad's, while two girls from St.  Hilary's and one from St. Bride's completed the party. Lettice  confessed to a very superior and elated feeling as the reins were laid  in her hand and the cavalcade began to move, particularly as Flossie  Taylor and the Hammond-Smiths were just setting off for tennis, and  could not help witnessing the start, though they resolutely looked the  opposite way.    \"Flossie always tries to be extremely grand herself, and make other  people seem small,\" whispered Lettice.    \"Fortunately, one needn't take people at their own estimate,\" replied  Maisie, whose downright nature much disliked Flossie's habit of  bragging.    To all the seven girls it was a delight to find themselves passing  under the archway of the big gate, and away along the road towards the  Tor. A chestnut called Victor had fallen to Honor's share, and though  he was very tall in comparison with her old favourite Pixie, she  nevertheless sat him well.    \"She looks just like the picture of Diana Vernon in our _Rob Roy_,\"  remarked Lettice to Maisie, gazing with admiration at the upright,  graceful figure of her schoolmate, who seemed perfectly at home in the  saddle.    Lettice was getting on much better than her modest protestations  beforehand would have led her friends to expect. Violet Wright, the  girl from St. Bride's, was quite a beginner, and Mr. Townsend held her  horse by a leading rein; while Gwen Roby, from St. Hilary's, looked  rather solemn, as if she were not altogether sure that she was enjoying  the experience.    \"I've ridden before,\" she explained, \"but only on a small pony, and  this feels so very different.\"    At first the party went at a walking pace, but on coming to a good,  level stretch of road the master gave the order to trot, and his pupils  were able to test the capacities of their steeds. Honor, at least, was  most unwilling to pull up when Mr. Townsend called out \"Halt!\" I am  afraid she did not want a lesson, only a scamper through the fresh air;  and she listened impatiently while the master explained the right  position of the whip, the hold on the snaffle, and the principle of  rising elegantly in the saddle.    \"It's all very well to talk of principles,\" said poor Violet, who  happened to find herself next to Lettice; \"I expect a little practice  will be of more use to me. At present I jog up and down like a sack of  flour, and it's all I can manage to stick on anyhow. I know I shall be  as stiff as a board to-morrow!\"    \"When we reach the Tor we may manage a short canter,\" said Mr.  Townsend, \"but for the present I wish you to keep together. Now then,  young ladies, please, elbows in and heads up! Hold the reins rather  short in the hand, and take care not to bear on the curb!\"    \"It's no fun, is it?\" remarked Honor, as she passed Ruth Latimer. \"Are  we only going to walk in a stupid row, and then trot for about ten  yards? I thought we should be flying along, like a hunt. I'd rather be  on Pixie at home; I could always make him go when I tickled his ears.  If we don't hurry up a little more I shall try it on this horse, and  see if he won't break into something more interesting than a snail's  pace.\"    \"Oh, Honor, do take care!\" remonstrated prudent Ruth.    But Honor did not stop to listen, and pushed on ahead of the others,  swishing her whip about in a manner that drew instant reproof from the  master. They had left the highway, and were now on a road leading  across the open moor. On one side the cliffs descended steeply to the  sea, and on the other rose bare, rolling hills, covered with short,  fine grass, the sails of a windmill or an occasional storm-swept tree  alone breaking the line of the horizon. It was a very suitable place  for a canter, and after a few preliminary remarks Mr. Townsend started  his flock on what seemed to most of them a rather mad career, following  closely himself in their wake, to continue his instructions:    \"Courage, Miss Roby! Miss Talbot, you are leaning over in your saddle!  Miss Lettice, your elbows again! Miss Wright, you must learn not to  grasp the pommel. Don't drag the rein! Miss Latimer, keep a light hand!  What, tired already? Well, I won't work you too hard just at first.\"    A little shaken and agitated by the unwonted exercise, the girls  checked their horses to a walk. They were none of them practised  riders, and all were glad that no more was expected from them for the  present. Honor, however, was some way on in front, and, instead of  pulling up, as she was told, she gave her horse a switch across the  flank and a tweak on the ear, such as she had been accustomed to bestow  on her old pony at home. The effect was magical.

Yet all  the great things that were done seem dwarfed by one enormous thing left  undone; the heroic tasks which the Americans accomplished are forgotten  in the thought of the task which stared them in the face, but from which  they, perhaps justifiably, shrank. All the injustices which were  abolished in that superb crusade against privilege only made plainer the  shape of the one huge privilege, the one typical injustice which still  stood--the blacker against such a dawn--Negro Slavery.    It has already been mentioned that Slavery was at one time universal in  the English colonies and was generally approved by American opinion,  North and South. Before the end of the War of Independence it was almost  as generally disapproved, and in all States north of the borders of  Maryland it soon ceased to exist.    This was not because democratic ideals were more devotedly cherished in  the North than in the South; on the whole the contrary was the case. But  the institution of Slavery was in no way necessary to the normal life  and industry of the North; its abrogation made little difference, and  the rising tide of the new ideas to which it was necessarily odious  easily swept it away. In their method of dealing with it the Northerners,  it must be owned, were kinder to themselves than to the Negroes. They  declared Slavery illegal within their own borders, but they generally  gave the slave-holder time to dispose of his human property by selling  it in the States where Slavery still existed. This fact is worth noting,  because it became a prime cause of resentment and bitterness when, at a  later date, the North began to reproach the South with the guilt of  slave-owning. For the South was faced with no such easy and manageable  problem. Its coloured population was almost equal in number to its white  colonists; in some districts it was even greatly preponderant. Its staple  industries were based on slave labour. To abolish Slavery would mean an  industrial revolution of staggering magnitude of which the issue could  not be foreseen. And even if that were faced, there remained the sinister  and apparently insoluble problem of what to do with the emancipated  Negroes. Jefferson, who felt the reproach of Slavery keenly, proposed to  the legislature of Virginia a scheme so radical and comprehensive in its  character that it is not surprising if men less intrepid than he refused  to adopt it. He proposed nothing less than the wholesale repatriation of  the blacks, who were to set up in Africa a Negro Republic of their own  under American protection. Jefferson fully understood the principles and  implications of democracy, and he was also thoroughly conversant with  Southern conditions, and the fact that he thought (and events have  certainly gone far to justify him) that so drastic a solution was the  only one that offered hope of a permanent and satisfactory settlement is  sufficient evidence that the problem was no easy one. For the first time  Jefferson failed to carry Virginia with him; and Slavery remained an  institution sanctioned by law in every State south of the Mason-Dixon Line.    While the States were thus dealing with the problems raised by the  application to their internal administration of the principles of the  new democratic creed, the force of mere external fact was compelling  them to attempt some sort of permanent unity. Those who had from the  first a specific enthusiasm for such unity were few, though Washington  was among them, and his influence counted for much. But what counted for  much more was the pressure of necessity. It was soon obvious to all  clear-sighted men that unless some authoritative centre of union were  created the revolutionary experiment would have been saved from  suppression by arms only to collapse in mere anarchic confusion. The  Continental Congress, the only existing authority, was moribund, and  even had it been still in its full vigour, it had not the powers which  the situation demanded. It could not, for instance, levy taxes on the  State; its revenues were completely exhausted and it had no power to  replenish them. The British Government complained that the conditions of  peace were not observed on the American side, and accordingly held on to  the positions which it had occupied at the conclusion of the war. The  complaint was perfectly just, but it did not arise from deliberate bad  faith on the part of those who directed (as far as anyone was directing)  American policy, but from the simple fact that there was no authority in  America capable of enforcing obedience and carrying the provisions of  the treaty into effect. The same moral was enforced by a dozen other  symptoms of disorder. The Congress had disbanded the soldiers, as had  been promised, on the conclusion of peace, but, having no money, could  not keep its at least equally important promise to pay them. This led to  much casual looting by men with arms in their hands but nowhere to turn  for a meal, and the trouble culminated in a rebellion raised in New  England by an old soldier of the Continental Army called Shay. Such  incidents as these were the immediate cause of the summoning at  Philadelphia of a Convention charged with the task of framing a  Constitution for the United States.    Of such a Convention Washington was the only possible President; and he  was drawn from a temporary and welcome retirement in his Virginian home  to re-enter in a new fashion the service of his country. Under his  presidency disputed and compromised a crowd of able men representative  of the widely divergent States whose union was to be attempted. There  was Alexander Hamilton, indifferent or hostile to the democratic idea  but intensely patriotic, and bent above all things upon the formation of  a strong central authority; Franklin with his acute practicality and his  admirable tact in dealing with men; Gerry, the New Englander, Whiggish  and somewhat distrustful of the populace; Pinckney of South Carolina, a  soldier and the most ardent of the Federalists, representing, by a  curious irony, the State which was to be the home of the most extreme  dogma of State Rights; Madison, the Virginian, young, ardent and  intellectual, his head full of the new wine of liberty. One great name  is lacking. Jefferson had been chosen to represent the Confederacy at  the French Court, where he had the delight of watching the first act of  that tremendous drama, whereby his own accepted doctrine was to re-shape  France, as it had already re-shaped America. The Convention, therefore,  lacked the valuable combination of lucid thought on the philosophy of  politics and a keen appreciation of the direction of the popular will  which he above all men could have supplied.    The task before the Convention was a hard and perilous one, and nothing  about it was more hard and perilous than its definition. What were they  there to do? Were they framing a treaty between independent  Sovereignties, which, in spite of the treaty, would retain their  independence, or were they building a nation by merging these  Sovereignties in one general Sovereignty of the American people? They  began by proceeding on the first assumption, re-modelling the  Continental Congress--avowedly a mere alliance--and adding only such  powers as it was plainly essential to add. They soon found that such a  plan would not meet the difficulties of the hour. But they dared not  openly adopt the alternative theory: the States would not have borne it.  Had it, for example, been specifically laid down that a State once  entering the Union might never after withdraw from it, quite half the  States would have refused to enter it. To that extent the position  afterwards taken up by the Southern Secessionists was historically  sound. But there was a complementary historical truth on the other side.  There can be little doubt that in this matter the founders of the  Republic desired and intended more than they ventured to attempt. The  fact that men of unquestionable honesty and intelligence were in after  years so sharply and sincerely divided as to what the Constitution  really _was_, was in truth the result of a divided mind in those who  framed the Constitution. They made an alliance and hoped it would grow  into a nation. The preamble of the Constitution represents the  aspirations of the American Fathers; the clauses represent the furthest  they dared towards those aspirations. The preamble was therefore always  the rallying point of those who wished to see America one nation. Its  operative clause ran: \"We, the People of the United States, in order to  form a more perfect Union, ... do ordain and establish this Constitution  for the United States of America.\" That such language was a strong point  in favour of the Federalist interpreters of the Constitution was  afterwards implicitly admitted by the extreme exponents of State  Sovereignty themselves, for when they came to frame for their own  Confederacy a Constitution reflecting their own views they made a most  significant alteration. The corresponding clause in the Constitution of  the Southern Confederacy ran, \"We, _the deputies of the Sovereign and  Independent States_, ... do ordain,\" etc., etc.    For the rest two great practical measures which involved no overbold  challenge to State Sovereignty were wisely planned to buttress the Union  and render it permanent. A clause in the Constitution forbade tariffs  between the States and established complete Free Trade within the limits  of the Union. An even more important step was that by which the various  States which claimed territory in the as yet undeveloped interior were  induced to surrender such territory to the collective ownership of the  Federation.
