[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22775"],[0,"Psychotherapy (#12)"],[1,"ns,  psychology may be serviceable. Psychotherapy is thus only one special  part of psychomedicine. But the situation becomes still more complex by  the fact that the illness to be treated or the disturbance to be removed  may stand in different relations to the psychophysical processes. The  illness may be a disturbance in the psychophysical brain parts, or it  may belong to other brain parts which are only in an indirect way under  the influence of mental states or which are themselves indirectly  producing changes in the mental life. And finally the disturbance may  exist outside of the brain in any part of the body, and yet again  through the medium of brain and nervous system it may produce effects in  the mind or be open to the influence of the mind. Thus we have entirely  different groups of medical interests and it would be superficial to  ignore the differences.    Both psychodiagnostic and psychotherapeutic studies must be devoted to  cases in which the mind itself is abnormal, further to cases in which  the normal minds registers the abnormalities in other parts of the body,  and finally to cases in which the normal mind influences abnormal  processes in the body. These latter two cases have to be subdivided into  those where the bodily disturbance still lies in the brain parts and  those where it lies outside of the brain. But the situation becomes  still more complex by the mutual relations of those various processes.  The impulse to take morphine injections may have reached the character  of a mental obsession and thus represent an abnormality of the mind, but  yielding to it produces at the same time disturbances in the whole body  which thus become again external sources for abnormal experiences in  otherwise normal layers of the mind.    Of course the interest of the psychologist as such remains always  related to the psychological factor, but the relation of the  psychological factor itself to the total disturbance may be of most  different character. If I diagnose or treat the fixed idea of a  psychasthenic, the psychological factor itself represents the  disturbance. On the other hand, if I study the pain sensations of a  patient who suffers from a disease of the spinal cord, then the  sensations themselves, the only psychological factor in the case, are  only indications of a disease which belongs to an entirely different  physical region; the mind itself is normal. Or, on the other hand, if I  try to educate a sufferer from locomotor ataxia to develop his walking  by building up in his mind new motor ideas to regulate his cooerdinated  movements, the mind again is entirely normal but the physician needs his  psychology on account of the influence which the mind has on the bodily  system. Again, we must insist that psychomedicine covers this whole  ground. Wherever a psychical factor enters into the calculations of the  physician either by reason of its own abnormality or by its relation as  effect or as cause to a diseased part of the body in the brain or  without, there we have a psychomedical task, and as far as it is  therapeutic, we have psychotherapy.    The psychodiagnostic research lies outside of the compass of our book,  but we cannot emphasize sufficiently the great importance which belongs  to that work. Moreover, just in the field of psychodiagnostics, the  methods of the modern experimental psychological laboratory are most  promising and successful. Let us not forget that we deal with such  psychological factors even when we test the functions of eye and ear and  skin and nose by examining the sensations and perceptions. The oculist  who analyzes the color sensations of a patient and the aurist who finds  defects in the hearing of the musical scale and discovers that certain  pitches cannot be discriminated, is certainly dealing, for diagnostic  purposes, with the material that the psychological laboratory has sifted  and studied. Even that sensation symptom which enters into so many  diseases, the sensation of pain, belongs certainly within the compass of  the psychologist and it is only to be regretted that the systematic  study of the pain sensations, mostly for evident practical reasons, has  been much neglected in the psychological laboratory.    The psychologists have been at work all the more eagerly in the fields  of association and memory, attention and emotion, habit and volition,  distraction and fatigue. Here subtle methods have been elaborated,  methods which surely common sense cannot supply, and which showed  differences of mental behavior with the exactitude with which the  microscope reveals the hidden differences of form. If physicians are  slow in accepting the help which the psychological laboratory can  furnish, it may be in good harmony with the desirable conservative  policy in medicine, but finally the time must come when this  instinctive resistance against new methods will be overcome. The recent  attachment of psychological laboratories to certain leading psychiatric  clinics is a most promising symptom. Yet the diagnostic studies with the  means of the psychological laboratory cannot be confined to the cases of  mental disease. The mild abnormalities of the mind, and especially the  nervous disturbances which exist outside the field of insanity, demand  this support of psychology much more. And even the normal personality  will be more safely protected from disease and from social dangers for  its mental constitution if the resources of experimental psychology are  employed. The more we know of the psychological constitution of the  individual, the more we can foresee the development which is to be hoped  for or feared and which may be encouraged or retarded.    The psychologist may determine, for instance, the degree of attention  with its resistance against distracting stimuli, the power of memory  under various conditions and on various material, the mental  excitability and power of discrimination, the quickness and correctness  of perception, the chains of associations, the rapidity of the  associative process for various groups, the types of reaction, the  forming of habits and their persistence, the conditions of fatigue and  of exhaustion, the emotional expressions and the emotional stability,  the time needed for recreation and the resistance against drugs, the  degree of suggestibility and the power of inhibition: and every result  in any of these lines may contribute to the diagnosis and prognosis of  cases. The chronoscope here measures the reaction times and association  times in thousandths of a second; the kymograph, by the help of the  sphygmograph, writes the record of the pulse and its changes in  emotional states, while the pneumograph records the variations of  breathing, and the plethysmograph shows the changes in the filling of  blood vessels in the limbs which is immediately related to the blood  supply of the brain. Here belongs also the ergograph, which gives the  exact record of muscular work with all the influences of will and  attention and fatigue, the automatograph which writes the involuntary  movements, especially also the galvanoscope which may register the  influence of ideas and emotions on the glands of the skin, and thus lead  to an analysis of repressed mental states, and hundreds of other  instruments which are used in the psychological laboratory.    Yet it would be misleading to think only of complex apparatus when  experimental psychology is in question. An experiment is given whenever  the observation is made under conditions which are artificially  introduced for the purpose of the observation. Thus there is no need of  the physical instrument. If I bring a spoonful of soup to my mouth at  dinner and I become interested in the combination of warmth sensation  and touch sensation and taste sensation and smell sensation, then I have  performed an experiment if I take one more spoonful of soup just for the  purpose of the observation. The physician too may carry out important  psychological experiments, without needing the outfit of a real  laboratory. Association experiments, for instance, promise to become of  steadily growing importance. To make them serviceable to the problems of  his office, nothing but a subtle psychological understanding is needed,  inasmuch as any routine work schematically applied to every case alike  would be utterly useless. Give your man perhaps a hundred words and let  him speak the very first word which comes to his mind when he hears the  given ones. You call rose, and he may say red or flower or lily or  thorn; you call frog and he may answer pond or turtle or green or jump,  and if you choose your hundred words with psychological insight, his  hundred answers will allow a full view of his mental make-up. This is an  experiment which does not require any instruments at all but a man's  subtle analysis of the replies. That is not seldom sufficient to secure  the diagnosis of complex mental variations. The method yields still more  if the time for such a reply is measured, but there again not the costly  chronoscope of the laboratory is indispensable; a simple stop watch  which gives the fifths of a second would be fully sufficient for all  practical purposes. From such simple facts of the mental inventory the  association experiments may lead to complex questions which slowly may  disentangle the confused ideas, for instance, of a dementia praecox, and  thus lead to subtle differential diagnosis.    The psychological laboratory alone can also elaborate the methods of  studying, for instance, the feeble-minded with all the individual  variations. New and ever new methods have been tried; the memory was  tested by reading and repeating figures or letters, or colored papers  were shown or cardboards of different forms or nonsense syllables, and  the powers of remembering were studied.

It was these feudal lords and their  mailed horsemen who saved Western Europe; they took their own reward out  of the lands they saved and out of the neighbours whom they insisted on  saving, till they eventually became an unmitigated nuisance from which  Bohemia suffered as much as any other country. But for the moment we are  concerned with the times of St. Wenceslaus and the first half of the  tenth century.    It is a pity that no one had thought of holding an International  Conference in the early days of the tenth century; there were a great  many things to discuss, and a Conference would have added to the gaiety  of nations. There was the question of those Northern Slavonic tribes who  had steadfastly refused the blessings of Christianity as purveyed by the  Teuton; of course, no one could foresee that the Western Church's  activities in those northern regions would eventually produce the modern  Prussian. Then the Conference would have to decide whether or no  Vikings, Hungarians and Saracens should be admitted to the comity of  nations, and if not, how to start doing business with those people all  the same. Then the place of the Conference would have to be decided;  there was quite a fair choice of suitable localities. Paris was becoming  popular, had already been discovered by people from over the seas--by  the Vikings, who, in quest of souvenirs, on one occasion sacked the  city, on another burnt it down. Aix-la-Chapelle had been popular for  some centuries before the Vikings discovered the attractions of Paris;  it had the waters to recommend it, and also memories of pious  Charlemagne, on which members of the Conference might reflect when not  engaged in feasting and providing the Press with fiction. Constantinople  would also have been well suited to an International Conference in the  tenth century. The Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus was rather a dull  dog, but he kept a glittering court, and none but the most refined  society is good enough for secretaries, bottlewashers and other numerous  hangers-on of conferences. Kings and rulers would probably have attended  the Conference in person, not being willing to afford the luxury of  allowing a Prime Minister to neglect home affairs. It would have been a  pretty gathering, Constantine Porphyrogenitus the bookworm probably as  president, AEthelstan of England, Charles the Simple of France or as much  as his neighbours allowed him, that doughty poacher Henry the Fowler,  German King, and Pope Leo not on speaking terms with him, St. Wenceslaus  of Bohemia trying to make peace with Henry, and a make-weight of German  counts and churchmen, possibly representatives of Vikings, Hungarians  and Saracens. The proceedings would have been marked by a \"certain  liveliness,\" as we used to say at the front when the fur began to fly.  The Conference would have differed from those of the present day, by  leading to a definite result if only in the form of a handsome row of  corpses; Counts of the Marches, Vikings and others would have attended  to that. It would have been interesting to note how monkish reporters  would clothe, or rather veil, their account of proceedings in suitable  language.    On the accession of Wenceslaus I the relations between his house and  the German King were strained. This, we have seen, was due to  Dragomira's anti-German foreign policy. Wenceslaus, however, as we know,  had occasion to send his mother into exile; she cannot have gone very  far, as according to popular belief the earth swallowed her up before  she had had time to get clear of the Castle Hill. Later generations put  up a chapel over the spot where Dragomira vanished; I consider this  conduct lacking in tact.    Anyway, Wenceslaus had to face a guileful, determined and quite  unscrupulous adversary, who had even called at Prague with an army; so,  being a man of peace, he came to terms with King Henry for a slight  consideration, namely, an annual tribute of six hundred silver marks and  one hundred and twenty head of cattle. This warded off trouble from the  west, but there remained the danger of barbarian invasion from the east  and there was every reason for erecting strongholds in Bohemia as in  other countries of Europe. I have found no trace of any such work by  Wenceslaus. He surely must have done something towards strengthening the  Hrad[vs]any, Hrad S. Vaclav or something like that, as it seems to have  been called at the time. Wenceslaus had built a chapel here in which to  house the relic of St. Vitus; I cannot imagine him leaving such a  treasure quite unprotected. This precious relic, namely, the arm of St.  Vitus, had been presented to Wenceslaus by King Henry which was handsome  of him, as he only got a trifling annual contribution of money and  cattle out of Bohemia, whereas that country was started off with  something of sufficient value to account for that noble fane the  Cathedral of St. Vitus. Bohemia did very well in the way of saints and  sacred relics; some of her kings were enthusiastic collectors, and we  remember that Christianity among the Czechs started with a royal martyr,  the saintly Ludmilla, who was shortly to be joined by another, as you  will be told later on in this chapter.    We are still trying to find out what Wenceslaus did for his capital and  country besides collecting odds and ends of saints and building a  chapel here and there, and regretfully state that little record of  anything but his piety is handed down to us. Piety, it seems, was no  more compatible with statecraft in the early days of Christendom than it  is to-day, and as Wenceslaus took the pious line, he gave way too much  to the German menace, thus laying up a store of trouble for his  successors and the sons of Czech which lasted well up to the present and  does not appear to be exhausted yet. In the meantime Wenceslaus,  evidently well pleased with himself, continued to set his people a godly  ensample. I should like to know whether they appreciated him to the same  extent as did some members of his family, Boleslav for instance, who  helped Wenceslaus to a crown of celestial glory by the simple process of  hitting him over the head. I am rather inclined to think that the piety  of Wenceslaus interfered with some of the innocent amusements of his  people, among whom paganism was not quite dead yet, as subsequent events  show. There was an interesting burial ground lying on the route which  Wenceslaus would follow when going from the Hrad[vs]any to Vy[vs]ehrad,  which remained the seat of government for several generations of  P[vr]emysls after the pious prince's demise.... This burial ground, a  very extensive one, is now covered by the Church of Emaus and its  monastic buildings; you can see those twin towers, dark ochre in colour  and topped by characteristic steeple and pinnacles, rising from among  fruit-trees and red-tiled roofs. Na Morani was the name of this burial  ground, after Morana, the goddess of death. It was the correct thing in  pagan society to make pilgrimages to this place in spring: a pleasant  afternoon in a cemetery was a pastime as popular then as it appears to  be to-day. The _cachet_ of Na Morani had been rather spoilt by the  erection of a little church some time in the ninth century, perhaps by  Wenceslaus himself. Anyway, the pious prince found this church a  convenient half-way house between Vy[vs]ehrad and Hrad[vs]any, and he  was wont to put up a prayer or two here before going on to drop a tear  on the Hrad[vs]any relics. The little church was dedicated to Cosmas  (not the chronicler) and Damian, saints of the third and fourth  centuries. It is not known why these gentlemen clubbed together to have  a day to themselves, but this need not act as deterrent to anyone who  wishes to observe their day. Wherever pilgrims visit, there you will  find settlements growing up, beginning with booths and shanties of those  who sell appropriate commodities, candles, wreaths and such-like. The  traffic in these articles continues; it was only last Palm Sunday that I  was offered a variety of wreaths to choose from, small wreaths of  snowdrops and fir twigs, to be worn on the wrist, to be blessed by the  priest and then to be left lying about the sitting-room until fit for  the dustbin. I resisted all temptation to deck myself with snowdrops and  fir twigs; their subdued tones do not match my aura.    It seems to me that Wenceslaus did nothing in particular for his people;  he concentrated on his part as royal saint and martyr, and was already  posing for the statues of himself and the frescoes depicting his good  deeds, which later ages produced. There was little to show for all this  prince's good intentions. Pious, indeed, was Wenceslaus; he spent a  great part of the night in prayer when he should have been recuperating  for strenuous work on the following day: there was plenty to do for a  country threatened on the one hand by marauding Magyars, on the other by  insidious German influence. \"He was in the habit of himself cutting off  the wheat and grapes that the priests required to prepare the holy  wafers and the wine for the sacrament\"--I quote Count Luetzow, but his  conception of political economy allowed him to pay a large tribute in  exchange for German interference and the remains of a saint. He lavished  money on the Church, whereas strongholds were required in defence of  Christendom, and finally he adopted the tonsure. This struck home to the  family and made Boleslav's cup of bitterness o'erflow; he plotted more  persistently than ever against Wenceslaus. Another habit of the pious  Prince was that of attending Church dedication festivals and their  anniversaries,"]]]
