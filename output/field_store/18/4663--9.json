We see  those who content themselves practicing great outward austerities, yet  by indulging their senses in what is called innocent and necessary,  they remain forever unsubdued. Austerities, however severe, will not  conquer the senses. To destroy their power, the most effectual means  is, in general, to deny them firmly what will please, and to persevere  in this, until they are reduced to be without desire or repugnance. If  we attempt, during the warfare, to grant them any relaxation, we act  like those, who, under pretext of strengthening a man, who was  condemned to be starved to death, should give him from time to time a  little nourishment. It indeed would prolong his torments, and postpone  his death.    It is just the same with the death of the senses, the powers, the  understanding, and self-will. If we do not eradicate every remains of  self subsisting in these, we support them in a dying life to the end.  This state and its termination are clearly set forth by Paul. He speaks  of bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus. (II Cor.  4:10.). But, lest we should rest here, he fully distinguishes this from  the state of being dead and having our life hid with Christ in God. It  is only by a total death to self we can be lost in God.    He who is thus dead has no further need of mortification. The very end  of mortification is accomplished in him, and all is become new. It is  an unhappy error in those good souls, who have arrived at a conquest of  the bodily senses, through this unremitted and continual mortification,  that they should still continue attached to the exercise of it. They  should rather drop their attention thereto, and remain in indifference,  accepting with equality the good as the bad, the sweet as the bitter,  and bend their whole attention to a labor of greater importance;  namely, the mortification of the mind and self-will. They should begin  by dropping all the activity of self, which can never be done without  the most profound prayer; no more than the death of the senses can be  perfected without profound recollection joined to mortification.  Indeed, recollection is the chief means whereby we attain to a conquest  of the senses. It detaches and separates us from them, and sweetly saps  the very cause from whence they derive their influence over us.    The more Thou didst augment my love, and my patience, O my Lord, the  less respite had I from the most oppressive crosses; but love rendered  them easy to bear.    O ye poor souls, who exhaust yourselves with needless vexation, if you  would but seek God in your hearts, there would be a speedy end to all  your troubles. The increase of crosses would proportionately increase  your delight.    Love, at the beginning, athirst for mortification impelled me to seek  and invent various kinds. It is surprising, that as soon as the  bitterness of any new mode of mortification was exhausted, another kind  was pointed to me, and I was inwardly led to pursue it. Divine love so  enlightened my heart, and so scrutinized into its secret springs, that  the smallest defects became exposed. If I was about to speak, something  wrong was instantly pointed to me, and I was compelled to silence. If I  kept silence, faults were presently discovered--in every action there  was something defective--in my mortifications, my penances, my  alms-giving, my retirement, I was faulty. When I walked, I observed  there was something wrong; if I spoke any way in my own favor, I saw  pride. If I said within myself, alas, I will speak no more, here was  self. If I was cheerful and open, I was condemned. Pure love always  found matter for reproof in me, and was jealous that nothing should  escape unnoticed. It was not that I was particularly attentive over  myself, for it was even with constraint that I could look at all at  myself. My attention toward God, by an attachment of my will to His,  was without intermission. I waited continually upon Him, and He watched  incessantly over me, and He so led me by His providence, that I forgot  all things. I knew not how to communicate what I felt to anyone. I was  so lost to myself, that I could scarcely go about self-examination.  When I attempted it all ideas of myself immediately disappeared. I  found myself occupied with my ONE OBJECT, without distinction of ideas.  I was absorbed in peace inexpressible; I saw by the eye of faith that  it was God that thus wholly possessed me; but I did not reason at all  about it. It must not, however, be supposed that divine love suffered  my faults to go unpunished.    O Lord! with what rigor, dost Thou punish the most faithful, the most  loving and beloved of Thy children. I mean not externally, for this  would be inadequate to the smallest fault, in a soul that God is about  to purify radically. The punishments it can inflict on itself, are  rather gratifications and refreshments than otherwise. Indeed, the  manner in which He corrects His chosen, must be felt, or it is  impossible to conceive how dreadful it is. In my attempt to explain it,  I shall be unintelligible, except to experienced souls. It is an  internal burning, a secret fire sent from God to purge away the fault,  giving extreme pain, until this purification is complete. It is like a  dislocated joint, which is in incessant torment, until the bone is  replaced. This pain is so severe, that the soul would do anything to  satisfy God for the fault, and would rather be torn in pieces than  endure the torment. Sometimes the soul flies to others, and opens her  state that she may find consolation. Thereby she frustrates God's  designs toward her. It is of the utmost consequence to know what use to  make of the distress. The whole of one's spiritual advancement depends  on it. We should at these seasons of internal anguish, obscurity and  mourning, co-operate with God, endure this consuming torture in its  utmost extent (while it continues) without attempting to lessen or  increase it. Bear it passively, nor seek to satisfy God by anything we  can do of ourselves. To continue passive at such a time is extremely  difficult, and requires great firmness and courage. I knew some who  never advanced farther in the spiritual process because they grew  impatient, and sought means of consolation.          CHAPTER 12      The treatment of my husband and mother-in-law, however rigorous and  insulting, I now bore silently. I made no replies and this was not so  difficult for me, because the greatness of my interior occupation, and  what passed within, rendered me insensible to all the rest. There were  times when I was left to myself. Then I could not refrain from tears. I  did the lowest offices for them to humble myself. All this did not win  their favor. When they were in a rage, although I could not find that I  had given them any occasion, yet I did not fail to beg their pardon,  even from the girl of whom I have spoken. I had a good deal of pain to  surmount myself, as to the last. She became the more insolent for it;  reproaching me with things which ought to have made her blush and have  covered her with shame. As she saw that I contradicted and resisted her  no more in anything, she proceeded to treat me worse. And when I asked  her pardon she triumphed, saying, \"I knew very well I was in the  right.\" Her arrogance rose to the height that I would not have treated  the meanest slave.    One day, as she was dressing me, she pulled me roughly, and spoke to me  insolently. I said, \"It is not my account that I am willing to answer  you, for you give me no pain, but lest you should act thus before  persons to whom it would give offence. Moreover, as I am your mistress,  God is assuredly offended with you.\" She left me that moment, and ran  like a mad woman to meet my husband telling him she would stay no  longer, I treated her so ill, that I hated her for the care she took of  him in his continual indispositions, wanting her not to do any service  for him. My husband was very hasty, so he took fire at these words. I  finished dressing alone. Since she had left me I dared not call another  girl; she would not suffer another girl to come near me. I saw my  husband coming like a lion, he was never in such a rage as this. I  thought he was going to strike me; I awaited the blow with  tranquillity; he threatened with his up-lifted crutch; I thought he was  going to knock me down. Holding myself closely united to God, I beheld  it without pain. He did not strike me for he had presence of mind  enough to see what indignity it would be. In his rage he threw it at  me. It fell near me, but it did not touch me. He then discharged  himself in language as if I had been a street beggar, or the most  infamous of creatures. I kept profound silence, being recollected in  the Lord.    The girl in the meantime came in. At the sight of her his rage  redoubled. I kept near to God, as a victim disposed to suffer whatever  He would permit. My husband ordered me to beg her pardon, which I  readily did, and thereby appeased him. I went into my closet, where I  no sooner was, than my divine Director impelled me to make this girl a  present, to recompense her for the cross which she had caused me. She  was a little astonished, but her heart was too hard to be gained.    I often acted thus because she frequently gave me opportunities. She  had a singular dexterity in attending the sick. My husband, ailing  almost continually, would suffer no other person to administer to him.  He had a very great regard for her. She was artful; in his presence she  affected an extraordinary respect for me. When he was not present, if I  said a word to her, though with the greatest mildness and if she heard  him coming, she cried out with all her might that she was unhappy. She  acted like one distressed so that, without informing himself of the  truth, he was irritated against me, as was also my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22285"],[0,"An American Suffragette (#12)"],[1,"conviction. There was a moment's pause and then Jack  said, \"And you go to this meeting because----?\"    \"Because, little as I like it, I am not such a fool that I do not know  that the enfranchisement of women is certain, and it may help me to  understand the new and troublesome element which is to be injected into  public life if I watch the workings from the beginning. Anyhow, it is  part of my business to understand these things, and hence my acceptance  of Miss Holland's invitation. This is the place, isn't it?\"    The house differed in no wise from the rest of the block, save in its  air of thrift and cleanliness, and the brass plate on the door bore the  name, \"Industrial League House.\" It was evidently a settlement with  resident workers, for a troop of boys was straggling down into the  basement, where a gymnasium had been established, and several young  women were standing in the hall discussing some matter connected with  sterilized milk. At the right of the wide hall there was a large,  old-fashioned double parlor, with plenty of chairs for a meeting of  sixty or seventy people, and perhaps half that many were already in the  room. They were singing as the two men entered, and Dr. Earl and Frank  stood in the hallway listening to the words sung to the soul-stirring  old tune of \"John Brown's Body.\"        \"These are they who build thy houses, weave thy raiment, win thy wheat,      Smooth the rugged, fill the barren, turn the bitter into sweet;      All for thee this day--and ever. What reward for them is meet?                Till the host comes marching on.\"    As they struck into the chorus, the boys downstairs took up the swelling  chords, and it was echoed from the street beyond.        \"Hark, the rolling of the thunder;      Lo, the sun! and lo! thereunder      Riseth wrath, and hope, and wonder,            And the host comes marching on.\"    \"I wonder whether they sing the sixth stanza,\" said Frank curiously.  Jack looked at him in amazement. \"What is the song?\" he asked,  conscious that he was getting new sidelights upon his younger brother's  character this evening.    \"It's William Morris' 'March of the Workers,' and the verse I'm talking  about begins, 'O, ye rich men, hear and tremble.' Come on in, Jack,\" and  a moment later John Earl heard his brother's beautiful voice take up the  words:        \"Many a hundred years, passed over, have they labored deaf and blind;      Never tidings reached their sorrow, never hope their toil might find.      Now at last they've heard and hear it, and the cry comes down the wind                And their feet are marching on.        \"On we march, then, we, the workers, and the rumor that ye hear      Is the blended sound of battle and deliv'rance drawing near;      For the hope of every creature is the banner that we bear,                And the world is marching on.\"    Silvia Holland turned quickly when she heard the strong, unknown voice  join in the ringing words, and fairly gasped when she saw that it was  Frank Earl who was singing, while his brother looked at her with an air  as bewildered as her own. The moment that the song was concluded she  greeted them, and found them comfortable seats where they could see and  hear without being too conspicuous.    \"We like to have men come to our meetings, and a few generally drop in.  I expect several to-night, for we have a speaker from Colorado, but we  don't often have the luxury of a baritone note for our music, so we owe  you a special vote of thanks, Mr. Earl,\" she said to Frank.    He bowed. \"Oh, no; it's the other way about,\" he said lightly. \"You  don't know how grateful I am to you for not singing the 'Day of Wrath'  verse, in which all of us who haven't succeeded in swearing off our  taxes hear what is coming to us. How well that girl presides,\" he added,  as a businesslike young woman dispatched the reading and adoption of  minutes and the reports of committees without a hitch or a moment's  useless delay.    \"That is Florence Dresser,\" explained Miss Holland. \"She is one of the  leaders in the Laundry Girls' Association. The secretary,\" indicating a  young woman who might have been a twelve-year-old child, save for her  sad, careworn face, \"has nearly killed herself sewing for sweaters to  take care of her family; we've found homes for the children and she  lives here now; we are trying to make up to her for the lost years, but  it is hard work,\" and she sighed.    \"We have one meeting a month when we have a program,\" Miss Holland  explained. \"At the other three we consider various phases of industrial  life as it affects our own membership or women in general. I am rather  sorry that this happens to be a program night, for you would have had a  better idea of the scope we try to cover at the other kind, but perhaps  this will be more entertaining.\" She turned more directly to Frank. \"A  business meeting here always makes me think of the 'Antis,' and their  twaddle about woman's sphere, which they would like to reduce to a  demi-hemisphere.\"    Frank nodded. \"Of course there's nothing to that with intelligent people  now; woman's sphere is wherever she can make good, but I think it is a  pity that she has to take so large a place in the industrial world, and  I don't believe that voting will help her.\"    \"But it has helped men,\" Miss Holland replied quickly.    \"Not half so much as their unions,\" he answered. \"The thing that helps  is getting together and standing together.\"    \"Now you've lost your whole case,\" laughed Dr. Earl. \"There has never  been anything that brought all sorts and conditions of women together  like the suffrage cause. You see that in England. In fact, you see it  everywhere. Women are waking up, and getting to their feet and  stretching out their hands--to us? Not at all, to each other.\"    \"Oh, I wish you'd say that to my comrades here,\" said Miss Holland. \"We  should all be so glad to hear you. Will you not let me present you for a  few minutes during the informal discussion?\"    For an instant he wavered, then the face of Leonora flashed before him,  and he shook his head decisively. \"I'm too new at this sort of thing,\"  he answered. \"Get my brother here to talk to you about Colorado, and let  the audience heckle him.\"    \"We'd be delighted,\" laughed Miss Holland. \"The lady who is to conduct  the question box, which is the main thing to-night, comes from Denver.  Her name is Carroll Renner; do you happen to know her? Will she be able  to hold her own? Sometimes they ask pretty sharp questions.\"    \"Don't give yourself a moment's uneasiness,\" Frank answered. \"There'll  be no twelve baskets needed to remove the fragments of the contumacious  when she gets through. A small blotter will answer.\"    \"You know her very well, then?\" Miss Holland said, openly surprised.    \"Rather,\" he answered laconically. \"She is the most persistent lobbyist  in the State, and she infallibly discovers the one deadly section in a  bill that you thought so well hidden that no one would ever notice it.  She's the most troublesome woman I know and the best fellow.\"    Miss Holland and Dr. Earl both turned and looked at the little woman,  who had come in a few minutes before with a party of people, with added  interest. She was very simply gowned in black, and but for a certain  twinkle of the dark gray eyes, and a rather mocking smile, there was  nothing particularly distinctive about her.    \"Tell me some more,\" said Miss Holland curiously. \"Sometimes the voting  woman helps and sometimes she hurts; if they're freaky, and of course  some of them are, they hurt dreadfully.\"    \"I've seen her a good deal while I've been watching the Senate,\" he  said. \"I'd been out there for several sessions of the General Assembly  before I located there. She came in one day with a letter from some  national woman's organization--wanted the Beveridge Child Labor Law  endorsed, I think. Anyhow, time was of the essence of the contract, so  we drew up a concurrent resolution, and she got a Republican and a  Democrat to introduce it together, and it slid along on its way to  Washington within forty-eight hours; she and a Mrs. Platt worked it  together. All they said was that the women wanted it.\"    Miss Holland gasped. \"Go on,\" she said.    He lowered his voice, for the president was introducing a handsome girl  who was to give a reading.    \"Another time there was a bill--I don't recollect it, but something  about committing girl prisoners, or something of the sort; I saw her get  pretty white, and shut her lips hard, and then she got up and started to  walk out, and one of the Senators saw her, too. 'Say, you don't like  that bill?' he said, and she answered, as if she could hardly control  her anger, 'It's infamous!' 'Oh, it is, is it?' he said. 'Well, then,  we'll make them adjourn over until we can get a conference and amend the  thing.' No fuss, no talk; just straight goods. That's Carroll Renner.\"    \"And that's what it means to be an enfranchised woman!\" said Miss  Holland, with a long breath. \"None of us could do that here!\"    \"Well, that's part of it,\" acquiesced Frank, and then they listened  silently. The girl who was reading was not particularly well-trained,  but there were passion and pathos in her voice as she told the story of  the eaglet, chained to a log for fear it might fall if permitted to  attempt to fly.    \"We also have our dream of a Garden,\" the strong young voice went on.  \"But it lies in a distant future. We dream that woman shall eat of the  tree of knowledge together with man, and that side by side and hand  close to hand, through ages of much toil and labor, they shall together  raise about them an Eden nobler than any the Chaldean dreamed of; an  Eden created by their own labor and made beautiful by their own  fellowship.    \"In his Apocalypse there was one who saw a new heaven and a new earth;  we see a new earth; but therein dwells love--the love of comrades and  co-worke"]]]
