By this care and industry, at length he made himself master of a  very considerable library, wherein the choicest collection was Greek.'  At his death the collection came to his brother, the Lord Keeper.    As with Dr. John North, book-hunting was the consuming passion of the  life of a very different man--Richard Smyth or Smith (of whom there is a  very fine and rare engraving by W. Sherwin), one of the Secondaries or  Under-Sheriffs from 1644 to 1655. Having sufficient wealth, he resigned  his municipal appointment, which was worth L700 a year, in order to  devote himself entirely to book-hunting. Anthony a Wood describes him as  'infinitely curious and inquisitive after books,' and states that 'he  was constantly known every day to walk his rounds amongst the  booksellers' shops (especially in Little Britain).' Richard Chiswell,  the bookseller who drew up a catalogue of Smith's books, which  subsequently came into his possession _en bloc_, tells us that his skill  and experience enabled him 'to make choice of such books that were not  obvious to every man's eye. . . . He lived in times which ministered  peculiar opportunities of meeting with books that were not every day  brought into public light, and few eminent libraries were bought where  he had not the liberty to pick and choose. Hence arose, as that vast  number of his books, so the choiceness and rarity of the greatest part  of them, and that of all kinds, and in all sorts of learning.' This  collection was sold by auction in May, 1682, the catalogue of it  occupying 404 closely-printed pages in large quarto. There were fourteen  Caxtons, 'the aggregate produce' of which was L3 14s. 7d.; the 'Godfrey  of Bulloigne' selling for 18s., 'being K. Edwarde the IVth's owne  booke,' and the 'Booke of Good Manners,' for 2s.; the highest price in  the entire sale being given for Holinshed's 'Chronicle,' 'with the  addition of many sheets that were castrated, being . . . not allowed to  be printed,' L7. Smith left an interesting and valuable obituary list of  certain of his bibliopolic friends (which is reprinted in _Willis'  Current Notes_, February, 1853), one of whom, according to him, was  'buried at St. Bartholomew's, without wine or wafers, only gloves and  rosemary.'    [Illustration: _Little Britain in 1550._]    Dr. Francis Bernard, chief physician to James II., was an indefatigable  book-hunter; being 'a person who collected his books, not for  ostentation or ornament, he seemed no more solicitous about their dress  than his own, and, therefore, you'll find that a gilt back or a large  margin was very seldom an inducement for him to buy. 'Twas sufficient  for him that he had the book.' His library was sold in 1698, and  realized the then enormous sum of L2,000. John Bridges, of Lincoln's  Inn, the historian of Northamptonshire, was a collector who read as well  as bought books; his collection was sold at auction in 1726, when 4,313  lots realized L4,001. Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, was a collector  with comprehensive tastes and almost unlimited means. His collection is  now in the British Museum, and is computed to have numbered about 26,000  volumes, on the binding of only a portion of which he is said to have  expended L18,000, besides a mass of 350,000 pamphlets. Thomas Baker  (1625-1690) bequeathed a portion of his library to St. John's College,  Cambridge, notwithstanding the fact that he was ejected therefrom. He  was an unceasing collector, but his finances were scanty, and, worst of  all, he had to contend with collectors of greater wealth, or  'purse-ability' as Bodley calls it. Writing to Humfrey Wanley, he says:  'I begin to complain of the men of quality who lay out so much for  books, and give such prices that there is nothing to be had for poor  scholars, whereof I have found the effects. When I bid a fair price for  an old book, I am answered, the \"quality\" will give twice as much, and  so I have done. I have had much ado to pick up a few old books at  tolerable prices, and despair of any more.' About 2,000 of his books  went to St. John's College, and the others were sold by auction, many  bearing the inscription 'Thomas Baker, socius ejectus,' etc. The library  of another collector who, like Baker, had more of the kicks than of the  ha'pence of this life, Thomas Hearne (1678-1735), may be mentioned  briefly in this paragraph, for both were men of great learning. Hearne's  collection was sold in February, 1736, by Osborne the bookseller, 'the  lowest price being marked in each book.' On the title-page of the  catalogue, and beneath a poor portrait of Hearne, is the well-known  couplet:                  'Quoth Time to Thomas Hearne,       \"Whatever I forget, you learn.\"'    Humphrey Dyson is another book-collector of this period, and is  described by Hearne as 'a very curious man in collecting books.' The  Wesleys were book-lovers and readers, but have perhaps but little claim  to rank as collectors _pur sang_. However, it is interesting to point  out that Lilly's catalogue for 1863 included a copy of Purcell's  'Orpheus Britannicus,' 1706, with an inscription on the fly-leaf: 'C.  Wesley, junior. The valuable gift of his much-honor'd Father.'    The Restoration poets, like those of the Elizabethan period, had a  sufficiently hard fight to keep themselves in food; books were luxuries  which they could only venture to enjoy at long and uncertain intervals.  Dryden and Congreve, however, appear to have been addicted to the  pleasant pastime.    An exceedingly interesting copy of Spenser's 'Works,' folio, 1679, was  once in the possession of Mr. F. S. Ellis. On the fly-leaf occurred this  note: 'The corrections made in this book are of Mr. Dryden's own  handwriting. J. Tonson.' The volume occurred in an auction, where its  value was not detected. The 'corrections,' Mr. Ellis states, extend  through the whole of the volume, and bear witness to the care and  diligence with which Dryden had studied Spenser's poems. Several of the  notes are in explanation of the text, but for the most part are careful  and curious corrections of the text and press. The pedigree of this  volume is well established by its having in the cover the bookplate of  Thomas Barrett, of Lee, celebrated by Dibdin as a 'bibliomaniacal and  tasteful gentleman.' Though Barrett died in 1757, his library was not  dispersed till a few years since. Izaak Walton was a collector, and took  the wise precaution of writing his autograph in each volume, as the very  interesting score of examples now at Salisbury prove. His friend,  Charles Cotton, of cheerful memory, was much more of a book-collector,  although from the 'Angler' it would seem that his whole library was  contained in his hall window. Like Walton, Cotton wrote his autograph in  most of his books, which occur in the auction-room at irregular  intervals. The extent or variety of the Cotton correction may be  gathered from the following 'epigram' which Sir Aston Cokaine wrote  (1658) 'To my Cousin, Mr. Charles Cotton the Younger':         'D'Avila, Bentivoglio, Guicciardine,        And Machiavil, the subtle Florentine,        In their originals I have read through,        Thanks to your library, and unto you,        The prime historians of later times; at least        In the Italian tongue allow'd the best.        When you have more such books, I pray vouchsafe        Me their perusal, I'll return them safe.        Yet for the courtesy, the recompense        That I can make you will be only thanks.        But you are noble-soul'd, and had much rather        Bestow a benefit than receive a favour.'    [Illustration: _Charles, Third Earl of Sunderland._]    One of the most remarkable collections of books ever made by a private  individual was that known as the Sunderland Library. It was formed, not  only in the short space of twelve years, but at a time when many books,  now of almost priceless value, and scarcely to be had at any price, were  comparatively common, and certainly not costly. Neither money nor pains  was spared, 'and the bibliographical ardour of the founder soon began to  be talked of in the bookshops of the chief cities of Europe.' The  founder, Charles, third Earl of Sunderland, lived at Althorp, his town  house being in Piccadilly, on the site of which the Albany now stands.  At the latter place this library was lodged for several years. In  Macky's 'Journey through England,' 1724, Sunderland House is there  described as being separated from the street of Piccadilly 'by a wall  with large grown trees before the gate. . . . The greatest beauty of  this palace is the library, running from the house into the garden; and  I must say is the finest in Europe, both for the disposition of the  apartments, and of the books. The rooms, divided into five apartments,  are fully 150 feet long, with two stories of windows, and a gallery  runs round the whole in the second story for the taking down books. No  nobleman in any nation hath taken greater care to make his collection  complete, nor does he spare any cost for the most valuable and rare  books. Besides, no bookseller in Europe hath so many editions of the  same book as he, for he hath all, especially of the classicks.' The  founder of this famous library died on April 19, 1722. Evelyn has left a  few very interesting facts concerning this collection. Under the date  March 10, 1695, we read: 'I din'd at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord  Spencer. My Lord shew'd me his library, now again improv'd by many books  bought at the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician,  which was the very best collection, especially of mathematical books,  that was I believe in Europe, once design'd for the King's library at  St. James's, but the Queen dying, who was the greate patroness of the  designe, it was let fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.'

Never trust a book to a novice to be  cut, without showing him how to do it, and how not to do it.    The collation of new books in cloth or _broche_ should be done before  cutting, provided they are issued to readers untrimmed. In collating  books in two or more volumes double watchfulness is needed to guard  against a missing signature, which may have its place filled by the same  pages belonging to another volume--a mixture sometimes made in binderies,  in \"gathering\" the sheets, and which makes it necessary to see that the  signatures are right as well as the pages. The collator should check off  all plates and maps called for by the table of contents to make sure that  the copy is perfect. Books without pagination are of course to have their  leaves counted, which is done first in detail, one by one, and then  verified by a rapid counting in sections, in the manner used by printers  and binders in counting paper by the quire.    The binding of books may be divided into two styles or methods, namely,  machine-made book-bindings, and hand-made bindings. Binding by machinery  is wholly a modern art, and is applied to all or nearly all new books  coming from the press. As these are, in more than nine cases out of ten,  bound in cloth covers, and these covers, or cases, are cut out and  stamped by machinery, such books are called \"case-made.\" The distinction  between this method of binding and the hand method is that in the former  the case is made separately from the book, which is then put into it.  After the sheets of any book come pressed and dried from the printing  office, the first step is to fold them from the large flat sheets into  book form. This is sometimes done by hand-folders of bone or some other  hard material, but in large establishments for making books, it is done  by a folding machine. This will fold ten thousand or more sheets in a  day. The folded sheets are next placed in piles or rows, in their  numerical sequence, and \"gathered\" by hand, _i. e._: a bindery hand picks  up the sheets one by one, with great rapidity, until one whole book is  gathered and collated, and the process is repeated so long as any sheets  remain. Next, the books are thoroughly pressed or \"smashed\" as it is  called, in a powerful smashing-machine, giving solidity to the book,  which before pressing was loose and spongy. Then the books are sawed or  grooved in the back by another machine, operating a swiftly moving saw,  and sewed on cords by still another machine, at about half the cost of  hand-sewing. Next, they are cut or trimmed on the three edges in a  cutting-machine. The backs of the books are made round by a  rounding-machine, leaving the back convex and the front concave in form,  as seen in all finished books. The books are now ready for the covers.  These consist of binders' board or mill-board, cut out of large sheets  into proper size, with lightning-like rapidity, by another machine  called a rotary board-cutter. The cloth which is to form the back and  sides of the book is cut out, of proper size for the boards, from great  rolls of stamped or ribbed or embossed muslin, by another machine. The  use of cloth, now so universal for book-binding, dates back little more  than half a century. About 1825, Mr. Leighton, of London, introduced it  as a substitute for the drab-colored paper then used on the sides, and  for the printed titles on the backs. The boards are firmly glued to the  cloth, the edges of which are turned over the boards, and fastened on the  inside of the covers. The ornamental stamps or figures seen on the  covers, both at the back and sides are stamped in with a heated die of  brass, or other metal, worked by machinery. The lettering of the title is  done in the same way, only that gold-leaf is applied before the die  falls. Lastly, the book is pasted by its fly leaves or end-leaves,  (sometimes with the addition of a cloth guard) to the inside of the cloth  case or cover, and the book is done, after a final pressing. By these  rapid machine methods a single book-manufacturing house can turn out ten  thousand volumes in a day, with a rapidity which almost takes the breath  away from the beholder.    There is a kind of binding which dispenses entirely with sewing the  sheets of a book. The backs are soaked with a solution of india-rubber,  and each sheet must be thoroughly agglutinated to the backs, so as to  adhere firmly to its fellows. This requires that all the sheets shall be  folded as single leaves or folios, otherwise the inner leaves of the  sheets, having no sewing, would drop out. This method is employed on  volumes of plates, music, or any books made up of large separate sheets.    In notable contrast to these rapid methods of binding what are termed  case-made books, comes the hand-made process, where only partial use of  machinery is possible.    The rebinding process is divided into three branches: preparing,  forwarding, and finishing. The most vital distinction between a  machine-made and a hand-made binding, is that the cloth or case-made book  is not fastened into its cover in a firm and permanent way, as in  leather-backed books. It is simply pasted or glued to its boards--not  interlaced by the cords or bands on which it is sewed. Hence one can  easily tear off the whole cover of a cloth-bound book, by a slight  effort, and such volumes tend to come to pieces early, under constant  wear and tear of library service.    Let us now turn to the practical steps pursued in the treatment of books  for library use. In re-binding a book, the first step is to take the book  apart, or, as it is sometimes called, to take it to pieces. This is done  by first stripping off its cover, if it has one. Cloth covers easily come  off, as their boards are not tied to the cords on which the book is  sewed, but are simply fastened by paste or glue to the boards by a muslin  guard, or else the cloth is glued to the back of the book. If the book is  leather-covered, or half-bound, _i. e._: with a leather back and  (usually) leather on its four corners, taking it to pieces is a somewhat  slower process. The binder's knife is used to cut the leather at the  joints or hinges of the volume, so that the boards may be removed. The  cords that tie the boards to the volume are cut at the same time. If the  book has a loose or flexible back, the whole cover comes easily off: if  bound with a tight back, the glued leather back must be soaked with a  sponge full of water, till it is soft enough to peel off, and let the  sheets be easily separated.    The book is now stripped of its former binding, and the next step is to  take it apart, signature by signature. A signature is that number of  leaves which make up one sheet of the book in hand. Thus, an octavo  volume, or a volume printed in eights, as it is called, has eight leaves,  or sixteen pages to a signature; a quarto four leaves; a duodecimo, or 12  mo. twelve leaves. The term signature (from Lat. _signare_, a sign) is  also applied to a letter or figure printed at the foot of the first page  of each sheet or section of the book. If the letters are used, the  signatures begin with A. and follow in regular sequence of the alphabet.  If the book is a very thick one, (or more than twenty-six signatures)  then after signature Z, it is customary to duplicate the letters--A.  A.--etc., for the remaining signatures. If figures are used instead of  letters, the signatures run on to the last, in order of numbers. These  letters, indicating signatures are an aid to the binder, in folding,  \"gathering,\" and collating the consecutive sheets of any book, saving  constant reference to the \"pagination,\" as it is termed, or the paging of  the volume, which would take much more time. In many books, you find the  signature repeated in the \"inset,\" or the inner leaves of the sheet, with  a star or a figure to mark the sequence. Many books, however, are now  printed without any signature marks whatever.    To return: in taking apart the sheets or signatures, where they are stuck  together at the back by adhesive glue or paste, the knife is first used  to cut the thread in the grooves, where the book is sewed on cords or  tape. Then the back is again soaked, the sheets are carefully separated,  and the adhering substance removed by the knife or fingers. Care has to  be taken to lay the signatures in strict order or sequence of pages, or  the book may be bound up wrongly. The threads are next to be removed from  the inside of every sheet. The sheets being all separated, the book is  next pressed, to render all the leaves smooth, and the book solid for  binding. Formerly, books were beaten by a powerful hammer, to accomplish  this, but it is much more quickly and effectively done in most binderies  by the ordinary screw press. Every pressing of books should leave them  under pressure at least eight hours.    After pressing, the next step is to sew the sheets on to cords or twine,  set vertically at proper distances in a frame, called a \"sewing bench,\"  for this purpose. No book can be thoroughly well bound if the sewing is  slighted in any degree. Insist upon strong, honest linen thread--if it  breaks with a slight pull it is not fit to be used in a book. The book is  prepared for the sewer by sawing several grooves across the back with a  common saw. The two end grooves are light and narrow, the central ones  wider and deeper. Into these inner grooves, the cords fit easily, and the  book being taken, sheet by sheet, is firmly sewed around the cords, by  alternate movements of the needle and thread, always along the middle of  the sheet, the thread making a firm knot at each end (called the  \"kettle-stitch\") as it is returned for sewing on the next sheet.  Sometimes the backs are not sawed at all, but the sheets of the book are  sewed around"]]]
