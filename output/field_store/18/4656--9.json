BURTON.\"    Constitutionally irritable, energetic, and utterly persistent, Dr Burton  did not know what dulness or depression of spirits was. With grief he  was indeed acquainted, and while such a feeling lasted it engrossed him;  but his spirits were naturally elastic, and both by nature and on  principle he discouraged in himself and others any dwelling on the sad  or pathetic aspects of life. He has said that the nearest approach he  had ever felt to low spirits was when he had finished some great work,  and had not yet begun another.    Such blanks in his life were short, and ever shorter and fewer. He found  necessary excitement in his work, and, when he joined his family, needed  no particular encouragement or inducement to lead him to talk either  about what he was doing or something else. As he advanced in years his  family learned more and more to leave the choice of subjects of  conversation entirely to him. Any subject not chosen by himself was apt  to prove irritating. Sometimes even his own did. Often his irritations  were amusing. If his wife, or some one else, chose to affect a ludicrous  degree of ignorance on some of his special subjects, they might probably  elicit a volley of information which would not have been vouchsafed to  them in answer to a serious question. Old reminiscences sometimes led on  to those laughable sayings in which Dr Burton's talk was rich. For  instance,--He had once rented an old inn at Pettycur as summer  quarters, and a favourite amusement, both at the time and afterwards,  was to imagine and describe the visitors who might have called on him  there in ignorance of the changed destination of the house. He would  imagine and mimic the tones of a drouthy Highland drover demanding  refreshment,--which, by the way, he would have been sure to get had he  so applied to Dr Burton; of an entirely drunk Lowlander, persisting in  representing himself as a _bona fide_ traveller; of a highly  Conservative old nobleman, posting up to town with his carriage-and-four  in spite of railways: this story ended with, \"A wicked and perverse  generation shall come seeking a _Sign_, and no sign shall be given  them.\"    He delighted in a sort of practical bull, or confusion of ideas, such  as--\"One may never have a _widow_ all his _life_.\"    A favourite story was of a too hospitable elder in a country parish,  who invited his minister to sup and spend the night in his house without  his wife's consent. The wife sees a male figure in the darkish entrance  of the house, and in her anger deals him a violent blow on the head with  the family Bible, ejaculating, \"That's for asking him to stay a' nicht.\"  The husband, from an inner room, exclaims, \"Eh, woman, ye have felled  the minister!\" On which the virago says _to her victim_, \"My dear, I  thocht it was yersel'!\"    Ministers and clergy of all denominations are often the text of jokes.    Another story referred to an Episcopal clergyman, who was frequently too  late in reaching his church, and whose curate on such occasions began to  read the morning service instead of him, and had reached in one of the  lessons the well-known verse, St John xiv. 6, \"I am the way, and the  truth, and the life,\" when his ecclesiastical superior, panting with  exertion, reaches the reading-desk, pushes his curate from his place,  and intones, \"_I_ am the way, and the truth, and the life,\" adding a  strictly private aside to his curate, \"_You_ the way, and the truth, and  the life, indeed!\"    Another minister arriving at church drenched with rain, and claiming  sympathy from his wife, is told by her to \"Gang up into the pu'pit;  ye'll be dry eneuch there.\"    A story in a different spirit, said to have been reported to him by Lord  Cockburn, is ascribed to a Scotch shepherd. A set of gentlemen were  imprecating the prevailing east wind, and asked the shepherd if he could  in any way defend that prevalent evil of his country. \"Ay, sirs,\" said  he; \"it weets the sod, it slocks the yows [_i.e._, quenches the thirst  of the ewes], and it's God's wull.\"    Many Aberdeenshire stories are valueless without Dr Burton's Aberdeen  accent, which he could intensify at pleasure.    A reminiscence of college days at Aberdeen was of one of the professors  there trying to discipline his unruly class, who came tumbling in while  the professor was opening proceedings by reciting the Lord's Prayer in  Latin, according to custom, and wound up his \"In secula seculorum,  amen,\" with \"Quis loupavit ower the factions [Aberdeen for forms or  benches], ille solvit doon a saxpence.\"    Two neat little _mots_ relate, the one to the familiar subject of London  eggs, the other, to the name of his youngest son. London grocers--as all  Londoners know--label their eggs _Fresh Eggs_, and _New-laid Eggs_, only  the respective prices of the different sorts or hard-bought experience  pointing to the signification of the two appellations. Dr Burton on  hearing this, said, \"Oh, of course the _New-laid Eggs_ become _Fresh_ in  time.\"    The writer wished to bestow the name of David on her youngest son, in  addition to that of Cosmo, in memory of her husband's young brother  David, whom she had heard described as an interesting child at the time  of his early death. Dr Burton opposed this wish, not desiring to  diminish the compliment to the child's grandfather and name-father,  Cosmo Innes. The child was ultimately christened Cosmo Innes--thus, as  his father said, remaining _entirely Cosmetic_.    Two legal stories were told respectively of Lord ----and Lord  Corehouse:--    Lord ---- is pronouncing sentence on an assassin who had stabbed a  soldier: \"You did not only maliciously, wickedly, and feloniously stab  or cut his person, thereby depriving him of his life, but did also sever  the band of his military breeches, which are her Majesty's.\"    Lord Corehouse is listening to the pleading of an advocate who describes  some performance which, as he says, \"could be done as easily as your  Lordship could leap out of your breeches.\" Lord Corehouse interrupts:  \"Mr ----, the saltatory feat which you are pleased to ascribe to me is  not one which I have ever attempted, and I do not feel sure that if I  did I could perform it with any of that ease which you suppose.\"    Enough, perhaps, of such reminiscences, which, written, may fail  altogether of their effect when spoken.    The writer recollects vaguely an immense number, of which confused  images present themselves. Crocodiles with their hands in their  breeches-pockets. Persons throwing off their coats and waistcoats like  Newfoundland dogs. A master and man sleeping; master on the boards  a-top, and the man in the bed; master remarking in the morning he would  have preferred the lower station, but for the concetty o' the thing.    Coming down early one morning in great spirits at the prospect of a  long day's outing with his son, he said to the boy--        \"I am not an early riser,      As you may surmise, sir;      But when I'm on a ploy, sir,      I feel just like a boy, sir.\"    No chance rhyme or pun, bad, good, or indifferent, was let slip, however  much taking it up might interrupt the subject under discussion.    The following childish little poem seems worth preservation now. It was  presented to his daughter Matilda on the death of her little dog. She  happening to visit a relative, who was physician in a lunatic asylum,  and showing the little poem, it was printed in the 'Asylum Magazine,'  from which it was copied into the 'Animal World:'        LAMENT FOR FOXEY.        Poor little Foxey,      With your coaxy      Little way,      You're gone for aye.      I'll no longer hark      To your garrulous bark,      See the fleeching grimace      Of your comical face,      Nor be touched by your yelping      When you get a skelping.      You had no orthodoxy      Poor Foxey,      Nor a commanding spirit,      Nor any great merit.      The reason for sorrow, then, what is it?      Just that you're missed,      And that's all      That shall befall      The rest of us,      Even the best of us.      An empty chair      Somewhere,      To be filled by another      Some day or other.      Sick cur or hero in his prime,      It's a matter of time.      The world is growing, growing,      The blank is going, going,      And will be gone anon.          CHAPTER VI.    LITERARY LIFE (_continued_).    _Illness--Resignation of office--Sale of Craighouse--Morton--Domestic  life--'Queen Anne'--Letters about ballad-lore--Singular incident  connected with it--Letters from abroad._      In the end of the year 1877 Dr Burton had the first severe illness of  his life. On the 18th day of December of that year, Mrs Cunningham,  widow of Lord Cunningham, died at Morton House, which had been the  summer home of her twenty years of widowhood, and at which illness had  detained her during the winter of 1877. The editor of the 'Scotsman'  applied to Dr Burton for an obituary notice of Mrs Cunningham--an old  friend of his, and still older of his wife. He was then too ill to be  applied to on any subject, or to be told of his old friend's death.    For several days at that time he was alarmingly ill from bronchitis,  accompanied by unusually high fever. This passed off but slowly. The  bodily health and strength appeared to be fully restored at the end of a  few weeks, but there was an undefinable change. Shortly after this  illness, though not in consequence of it, Dr Burton resigned his office  of Prison Manager. He retired on an allowance of two-thirds of his  former salary, remaining chairman of the Board of Prisons and  Statistics, of which he was an honorary member.    He had not fully regained strength when, to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22153"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Rome (#12)"],[1,"of the roof. As for the disfiguration of sacred buildings  with all sorts of hangings, it is enough to quote the words of Livy  (xl. 51). \"In the year of Rome, 574, the censors M. Fulvius Nobilior  and M. AEmilius Lepidus restored the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol.  On this occasion they removed from the columns all the tablets,  medallions, and military flags _omnis generis_ which had been hung  against them.\"    The right of performing sacrifices was sometimes granted to  civilians, on payment of a fee. An inscription discovered among the  ruins of the Temple of Malakbelos, outside the Porta Portese, on the  site of the new railway station, relates how an importer of wine,  Quintus Octavius Daphnicus, having built at his own expense a  banqueting hall within the sacred enclosure, was rewarded with the  _immunitas sacrum faciendi_, that is, the right of performing  sacrifices without the assistance of priests. The performances were  regulated by tariffs, which specified a price for every item; and one  of these has actually survived to our day.[36]             D      PRO.SANGVINE (_nomen animalis_)       ET.CORIVM      SI.HOLOCAVSTVM.[Symbol: -X] X      PRO.SANGVINE.AGNI.ET.PELLE [Symbol: -X] IS      SI.HOLOCAVSTVM.[Symbol: -X].II[Greek: S]      PRO.GALLO HOLOCAVSTO [Symbol: -X] I[Greek: S]       PRO.SANGVINE.       A.XIII       PRO.CORONA.         A.IIII      PRO.CALIDAM.IN.HOMINEM.A.II             D....      For the blood of ---- (perhaps a bull) ----      And for its hide                       ----      If the victim be entirely burnt        xxv asses.      For the blood and skin of a lamb        iv asses.      If the lamb be entirely burnt          vi1/2 asses.      For a cock (entirely burnt)           iii1/2 asses.      For blood alone                       xiii asses.      For a wreath                            iv asses.      For hot water (per head)                ii asses.    The meaning of this tariff will be easily understood if we recall the  details of a Graeco-Roman sacrifice, in regard to the apportionment of  the victim's flesh. The parts which were the perquisite of the priests  differ in different worships; sometimes we hear of legs and skin,  sometimes of tongue and shoulder. In the case of private sacrifices  the rest of the animal was taken home by the sacrificer, to be used  for a meal or sent as a present to friends. This was, of course,  impossible in the case of \"holocausts,\" in which the victim was burnt  whole on the altar. In the Roman ritual, hides and skins were always  the property of the temple.[37] In the above tariff two prices are  charged: a smaller one for ordinary sacrifices, when only the  intestines were burnt, and the rest of the flesh was taken home by the  sacrificer; a larger one for \"holocausts,\" which required a much  longer use of the altar, spit, gridiron, and other sacrificial  instruments. Four asses are charged for each crown or wreath of  flowers, half that amount for hot water.    The site of a sanctuary can be determined not only from its actual  ruins, but, in many cases, from the contents of its _favissae_, or  vaults, which are sometimes collected in a group, sometimes spread  over a considerable space of ground. The origin of these deposits of  terra-cotta or bronze votive objects is as follows:--    Each leading sanctuary or place of pilgrimage was furnished with one  or more rooms for the exhibition and safe-keeping of ex-votos. The  walls of these rooms were studded with nails on which ex-voto heads  and figures were hung in rows by means of a hole on the back. There  were also horizontal spaces, little steps like those of a _lararium_,  or shelves, on which were placed those objects that could stand  upright. When both surfaces were filled, and no room was left for the  daily influx of votive offerings, the priests removed the rubbish of  the collection, that is, the terra-cottas, and buried them either in  the vaults (_favissae_) of the temple, or in trenches dug for the  purpose within or near the sacred enclosure.    During these last years I have been present at the discovery of five  deposits of ex-votos, each marking the site of a place of pilgrimage.  The first was found in March, 1876, on the site of a temple of  Hercules, outside the Porta S. Lorenzo; the second in the spring of  1885, on the site of the Temple of Diana Nemorensis; the third in  1886, near the Island of AEsculapius (now of S. Bartolomeo); the fourth  in 1887, near the shrine of Minerva Medica; the last in 1889, on the  site of the Temple of Juno at Veii.    The existence of a temple of Hercules, outside the Porta S. Lorenzo,  within the enclosure of the modern cemetery, was first made known in  1862, in consequence of the discovery of an altar raised to him by  Marcus Minucius, the \"master of the horse\" or lieutenant-general of Q.  Fabius Maximus (217 B. C.). This altar is now exhibited in the  Capitoline Museum.[38] Fourteen years later, in 1876, the _favissae_ of  the temple were found in the section of the cemetery called the  Pincio. There were about two hundred pieces of terra-cotta, vases of  Etruscan and Italo-Greek manufacture; several statuettes of bronze,  and pieces of _aes rude_, and _aes grave librale_, one of them from the  town of Luceria. This deposit seems to have been buried at the  beginning of the sixth century of Rome.    [Illustration: Nemi and the site of the Temple of Diana. _A_ Platform  of the Temple of Diana. _B_ Village of Nemi and Castle of the  Orsinis.]    [Illustration: Portrait Bust of Person cured at Nemi.]    The excavation of the temple of Diana Nemorensis was undertaken in  1885, by Sir John Savile Lumley, now Lord Savile of Rufford, the  English ambassador at Rome, with the kind consent of the Italian  government. It seems that this _Artemisium Nemorense_ was not only a  place of worship and devotion, but also a hydro-therapeutic  establishment. The waters employed for the cure were those which  spring from the lava rocks at Nemi, and which, until a few years ago,  fell in graceful cascades into the lake, at a place called \"Le Mole.\"  They now supply the city of Albano, which has long suffered from  water-famine. I can vouch for their therapeutic efficiency from  personal experience; in fact I could honestly put up my votive  offering to the long-forgotten goddess, having recovered health and  strength by following the old cure. Diana, however, was chiefly  worshipped in this place as Diana Lucina. I need not enter into  particulars on this subject. The ex-votos collected in large quantity  by Lord Savile, representing young mothers nursing their first-born,  and other offerings of the same nature, testify to the skill of the  priests. Perhaps they practised other branches of surgery, because,  among the curiosities brought to light in 1885, are several figures  with large openings on the front, through which the intestines are  seen. Professor Tommasi-Crudeli, who has made a study of this class of  curiosities, says that they cannot be considered as real anatomical  models, because the work is too rough and primitive to enable us to  distinguish one intestine from the other. The number of objects  collected by Lord Savile may be estimated at three thousand.    [Illustration: The stern of the ship of the Island of the Tiber.]    Characteristic objects of a like nature--breasts cut open and showing  the anatomy--have been found in large numbers in and near the island  of the Tiber, where the Temple of AEsculapius stood, at the stern of  the marble ship. It seems that the street leading from the Campus  Martius to the Pons Fabricius, and across it to the temple, was lined  with shops and booths for the sale of ex-votos, as is the case now  with the approaches to the sanctuaries of Einsiedeln, Lourdes,  Mariahilf, and S. Jago. In the foundations of the new quays of the  Tiber, above and below the bridge, the ex-votos have been found in  regular strata along the line of the banks, whereas in the island  itself they have come to light in much smaller quantities. As the  votive objects deposited in this sanctuary, from the year 292 before  Christ to the fall of the Empire, may be counted not by thousands, but  by millions of specimens, I believe that the bed of the Tiber must  have been used as a _favissa_.    The name of Minerva Medica is familiar to students and visitors of old  Rome;[39] but the monument which bears it, a nymphaeum of the gardens  of the Licinii, near the Porta Maggiore, has no connection whatever  with the goddess of wisdom. Minerva Medica was the name of a street on  the Esquiline, so called from a shrine which stood at the crossing, or  near the crossing, with the Via Merulana, not far from the church of  SS. Pietro e Marcellino. Its foundations and its deposit of ex-votos  were discovered in 1887. The shape and nature of the offerings bear  witness to numberless cases of recovery performed by the merciful  goddess, the Athena Hygieia or Paionia of the Greeks. There is a  fragment of a lamp inscribed with her name, which leaves no doubt as  to the identity of the deposit. There is also a votive head, not cast  from the mould, but modelled _a stecco_, which alludes to Minerva as a  restorer of hair. The scalp is covered with thick hair in front and on  the top, while the sides are bald, or showing only an incipient  growth. It is evident, therefore, that the woman whose portrait-head  we have found had lost her curls in the course of some malady, and  having regained them through the intercession of Minerva, as she  piously believed, offered her this curious token of gratitude. This,  at least, is Visconti's opinion. Another testimonial of Minerva's  efficiency in restoring hair has been found at Piacenza, a votive  tablet put up MINERVAE MEMORI by a lady named Tullia Superiana,  RESTITUTIONE SIBI FACTA CAPILLORUM (for having restored her hair).
