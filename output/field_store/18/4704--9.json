Here is _viaticum_--daily manna--for  him, to last the year round, and to last year after year; an  inexhaustible breviary for the church of this world! It is of the  gravest historical significance that Rabelais and Montaigne, but  especially Montaigne, should, to such an extent, for now three full  centuries, have been furnishing the daily intellectual food of  Frenchmen.    Pascal, in an interview with M. de Saci (carefully reported by the  latter), in which the conversation was on the subject of Montaigne and  Epictetus contrasted,--these two authors Pascal acknowledged to be the  ones most constantly in his hand,--said gently of Montaigne, \"Montaigne  is absolutely pernicious to those who have any inclination toward  irreligion, or toward vicious indulgences.\" We, for our part, are  prepared, speaking more broadly than Pascal, to say that, to a somewhat  numerous class of naturally dominant minds, Montaigne's \"Essays,\" in  spite of all that there is good in them,--nay, greatly because of so  much good in them,--are, by their subtly insidious persuasion to evil,  upon the whole quite the most powerfully pernicious book known to us in  literature, either ancient or modern.          V.    LA ROCHEFOUCAULD: 1613-1680 (La Bruyere: 1646 (?)-1696; Vauvenargues:  1715-1747).      In La Rochefoucauld we meet another eminent example of the author of one  book. \"Letters,\" \"Memoirs,\" and \"Maxims\" indeed name productions in  three kinds, productions all of them notable, and all still extant, from  La Rochefoucauld's pen. But the \"Maxims\" are so much more famous than  either the \"Letters\" or the \"Memoirs,\" that their author may be said to  be known only by those. If it were not for the \"Maxims,\" the \"Letters\"  and the \"Memoirs\" would probably now be forgotten. We here may dismiss  these from our minds, and concentrate our attention exclusively upon the  \"Maxims.\" Voltaire said, \"The 'Memoirs' of the Duc de La Rochefoucauld  are read, but we know his 'Maxims' by heart.\"    La Rochefoucauld's \"Maxims\" are detached sentences of reflection and  wisdom on human character and conduct. They are about seven hundred in  number, but they are all comprised in a very small volume; for they  generally are each only two or three lines in length, and almost never  does a single maxim occupy more than the half of a moderate-sized page.  The \"Maxims,\" detached, as we have described them, have no very marked  logical sequence in the order in which they stand. They all, however,  have a profound mutual relation. An unvarying monotone of sentiment, in  fact, runs through them. They are so many different expressions,  answering to so many different observations taken at different angles,  of one and the same persisting estimate of human nature. 'Self-love is  the mainspring and motive of every thing we do, or say, or feel, or  think:' that is the total result of the \"Maxims\" of La Rochefoucauld.    The writer's qualifications for treating his theme were unsurpassed. He  had himself the right character, moral and intellectual; his scheme of  conduct in life corresponded; he wrote in the right language, French;  and he was rightly situated in time, in place, and in circumstance. He  needed but to look closely within him and without him,--which he was  gifted, with eyes to do,--and then report what he saw, in the language  to which he was born. This he did, and his \"Maxims\" are the fruit. His  method was largely the sceptical method of Montaigne. His result, too,  was much the same result as his master's. But the pupil surpassed the  master in the quality of his work. There is a fineness, an  exquisiteness, in the literary form of La Rochefoucauld, which Montaigne  might indeed have disdained to seek, but which he could never, even with  seeking, have attained. Each maxim of La Rochefoucauld is a \"gem of  purest ray serene,\" wrought to the last degree of perfection in form  with infinite artistic pains. Purity, precision, clearness, density,  point, are perfectly reconciled in La Rochefoucauld's style with ease,  grace, and brilliancy of expression. The influence of such literary  finish, well bestowed on thought worthy to receive it, has been  incalculably potent in raising the standard of French production in  prose. It was Voltaire's testimony, \"One of the works which has most  contributed to form the national taste, and give it a spirit of accuracy  and precision, was the little collection of 'Maxims' by Francois Duc de  La Rochefoucauld.\"    There is a high-bred air about La Rochefoucauld the writer, which well  accords with the rank and character of the man La Rochefoucauld. He was  of one of the noblest families in France. His instincts were all  aristocratic. His manners and his morals were those of his class. Brave,  spirited, a touch of chivalry in him, honorable and amiable as the world  reckons of its own, La Rochefoucauld ran a career consistent throughout  with his own master-principle, self-love. He had a wife whose conjugal  fidelity her husband seems to have thought a sufficient supply in that  virtue for both himself and her. He behaved himself accordingly. His  illicit relations with other women were notorious. But they unhappily  did not make La Rochefoucauld in that respect at all peculiar among the  distinguished men of his time. His brilliant female friends collaborated  with him in working out his \"Maxims.\" These were the labor of years.  They were published in successive editions, during the lifetime of the  author; and some final maxims were added from his manuscripts after his  death.    Using, for the purpose, a very recent translation, that of A. S. Bolton  (which, in one or two places, we venture to conform more exactly to the  sense of the original), we give almost at hazard a few specimens of  these celebrated apothegms. We adopt the numbering given in the best  Paris edition of the \"Maxims:\"--         No. 11. The passions often beget their contraries. Avarice       sometimes produces prodigality, and prodigality avarice: we are       often firm from weakness, and daring from timidity.         No. 13. Our self-love bears more impatiently the condemnation of       our tastes than of our opinions.    How much just detraction from all mere natural human greatness is  contained in the following penetrative maxim!--         No. 18. Moderation is a fear of falling into the envy and contempt       which those deserve who are intoxicated with their good fortune; it       is a vain parade of the strength of our mind; and, in short, the       moderation of men in their highest elevation is a desire to appear       greater than their fortune.    What effectively quiet satire in these few words!--         No. 19. We have strength enough to bear the ills of others.    This man had seen the end of all perfection in the apparently great of  this world. He could not bear that such should flaunt a false plume  before their fellows:--         No. 20. The steadfastness of sages is only the art of locking up       their uneasiness in their hearts.    Of course, had it lain in the author's chosen line to do so, he might,  with as much apparent truth, have pointed out, that to lock up  uneasiness in the heart requires steadfastness no less--nay, more--than  not to feel uneasiness.    The inflation of \"philosophy\" vaunting itself is thus softly eased of  its painful distention:--         No. 22. Philosophy triumphs easily over troubles passed and       troubles to come, but present troubles triumph over it.    When Jesus once rebuked the fellow-disciples of James and John for  blaming those brethren as self-seekers, he acted on the same profound  principle with that disclosed in the following maxim:--         No. 34. If we had no pride, we should not complain of that of       others.    How impossible it is for that Proteus, self-love, to elude the presence  of mind, the inexorable eye, the fast hand, of this incredulous  Frenchman:--         No. 39. Interest [self-love] speaks all sorts of languages, and       plays all sorts of parts, even that of disinterestedness.         No. 49. We are never so happy, or so unhappy, as we imagine.         No. 78. The love of justice is, in most men, only the fear of       suffering injustice.    What a subtly unsoldering distrust the following maxim introduces into  the sentiment of mutual friendship!--         No. 83. What men have called friendship, is only a partnership, a       mutual accommodation of interests, and an exchange of good offices:       it is, in short, only a traffic, in which self-love always proposes       to gain something.         No. 89. Every one complains of his memory, and no one complains of       his judgment.    How striking, from its artful suppression of strikingness, is the first  following, and what a wide, easy sweep of well-bred satire it  contains!--         No. 93. Old men like to give good advice, to console themselves for       being no longer able to give bad examples.         No. 119. We are so much accustomed to disguise ourselves to others,       that, at last, we disguise ourselves to ourselves.         No. 127. The true way to be deceived, is to think one's self       sharper than others.    The plain-spoken proverb, \"A man that is his own lawyer, has a fool for  his client,\" finds a more polished expression in the following:--         No. 132. It is easier to be wise for others, than to be so for       one's self.    How pitilessly this inquisitor pursues his prey, \"the human soul, into  all its useless hiding-places!--         No. 138. We would rather speak ill of ourselves, than not talk of       ourselves.    The following maxim, longer and less felicitously phrased than is usual  with La Rochefoucauld, recalls that bitter definition of the bore,--\"One  who insists on talking about himself all the time that you are wishing  to talk about yourself:\"--         No."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23050"],[0,"Peter Biddulph: The Story of an Australian Settler (#12)"],[1,"England to do, and that there were no  wild beasts or other dangers that I knew of to fear.  \"Oh, but there are  those hideous black men, father,\" exclaimed Susan; \"do take care of  them, for I am sure that they look as if they would do any mischief.\"    \"No fear,\" answered Charley, \"they look worse than they are, and we  shall be able to manage any number of them, even if they should take it  into their heads to play us tricks.  Mary is not afraid, you see.\"  Mary  looked as if she thought Charley would be able, with his single arm, to  put to flight a whole host of blacks.  Those we had seen, though ugly  enough, were not very terrific-looking fellows.  We heard, however, that  away from Sydney, where the white settlers had found some blacks  pilfering, and had shot them dead, the survivors had retaliated, and  murdered two or three white men.    As horses were at that time very dear, I did not wish to purchase any  for our journey, and none were to be hired.  We had therefore to trudge  forward on foot.  One thing we wanted, and that was a guide who knew the  nature of the country, the best mode of traversing it, and where farms  were situated.  Unaccustomed to walking, we felt very weary the first  day of our journey as night approached, and yet no house appeared in  sight.  We were travelling along a high road made by convicts.  The  worst characters were employed on the roads, a labour which they  especially detested.  They were generally doubly convicted felons.  They  were worked in chains, but sometimes even then they broke away, and,  taking to the bush, robbed every one they met, and murdered those who  resisted them.    We thought at last that we should have to camp out, instead of getting  the shelter of a roof, which we had expected to do.  Just, however, as  we were about to stop, a light appeared ahead.  We made for it.  The  door of a cottage stood open.  We entered.  A fire was blazing on the  hearth, with a large damper baking under the ashes, and a huge teapot of  tea was steaming away on a table set out for a meal; while a joint of a  kangaroo was among the good things which gladdened our eyes.    \"You may walk in, strangers, and welcome,\" said a rough-looking man, who  at that moment appeared from the back part of the cottage.  \"Here,  missus, I see you have supper ready, where are you?\"  His wife, a buxom  dame, came when called from an inner room, and welcomed us as her  husband had done.  We were soon seated at the table, doing justice to  the kangaroo and damper.  When our host and his wife heard that we had  lately arrived, they were eager for us to tell them all the news from  England, but what we had to say was not what they cared much to hear,  that was very evident.  As I examined their countenances, I did not like  the expression they bore, nor warn the way they spoke altogether  satisfactory.  I suspected, and I was right, that they were convicts.  At that time there were many of that class, who had already risen to  considerable wealth, in the colony.        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    OUR JOURNEY INLAND.    Although, as I have said, the faces of our host and hostess did not  please me, and indeed gave me some disquietude, they both made  themselves so pleasant, and were so civil and hospitable, that I could  not help feeling it was ungrateful for me to harbour hard thoughts of  them.  While we were still at the table, a man came in and took his seat  opposite to me.  I supposed that he was living in the house, at all  events that he was expected.  He eyed me very hard, and then went on  eating his supper.  At last Charley White addressed me as Mr Biddulph,  though he generally called me father.  Immediately the stranger started  up, and coming round to me and taking my hand, exclaimed, \"Why, Mr  Biddulph, I thought that I knew your face, but I little expected to see  you out here.\"  When he spoke I recognised a man to whom I had once  rendered a considerable service.  He was in debt.  I gave him a sum of  money to save him from prison, and he promised to repay me.  Before he  did so he disappeared, and I did not expect to receive a farthing, but  on two occasions small amounts were sent to me, which I knew came from  him, though the larger portion still remained unpaid.    \"I hope that you are doing well, Jacob,\" said I, not thinking of the  debt.    \"Pretty well, but not as well as I could wish, Mr Biddulph,\" he  answered.  \"I have been in the country about five years, and know it as  well as most men, but there are one or two things on my mind which I  should like to get free of.  One of them is my debt to you, and the  honest truth is, that though I have worked hard, of money I have none.  Most of my wages have come in the shape of rum, and I never yet heard of  a man getting rich on such payment as that.\"    I saw that our host and hostess exchanged glances, but I took no notice  of them.    \"If you know the country you are just the man I want, and can quickly  repay me, and place me in your debt also,\" I observed.  \"I want a guide  through the country, and some one who knows the nature of the land, to  help me in choosing a farm.\"    \"Just the thing I should like,\" he exclaimed, jumping at the proposal;  \"I'm a free man, and can go where I like.\"    I judged from this that he had not always been free.  Our entertainers  did not seem over well pleased at his so readily accepting my proposal.  Still they treated us civilly, and we had no cause to complain.  They  brought us some sacks full of dry grass, which they spread on the floor,  with some kangaroo skins to cover us; in those days sheep skins were  rare.  We lay down, commending ourselves to God, and felt as secure  among convicts, with the possibility of a visit from the bush-rangers,  as we had done in our tight little craft in the middle of the ocean.    We were on foot before daybreak, and with Jacob Rawdon as our guide, set  out, as soon as we had taken some food, on our journey.  Our host and  his wife were evidently displeased at his leaving them.    After we had got to a distance I asked him why this was.  \"The reason is  that I had become well-nigh their slave,\" he answered.  \"They paid me my  wages in rum, which I drank mostly, or exchanged at a great loss for  necessaries, and so you see that I am not a shilling the richer than I  was when I first began to work for myself.  Still I hope to be able to  repay you, and it will be a great satisfaction to me to do so.\"    I did not doubt him, and had heard enough about the people I was likely  to meet to know that it would not do to question him too closely as to  why he had come to the country.  I observed that he was frequently  downcast, and that an expression of grief passed over his countenance;  indeed, from several things he said, I felt great hopes that, whatever  had been his errors, he was resolved to turn from them and to lead a new  life.  Under this belief I spoke seriously to him, and reminded him that  he could not go on in his own strength, that the best man alive could  not; and that if he would do right he must seek for aid from God the  Father, through the influence of the Holy Spirit, trusting entirely and  alone to the perfect sacrifice of Christ.  He listened attentively.  The  doctrine seemed entirely new to him, but he did not in any way appear  inclined to reject it.  He walked on by my side, often silent, now and  then he made a remark.  His voice faltered.  I saw that he was in tears.  \"Can God pardon such a vile, mad sinner as I have been?\" he asked at  length.    \"If you are looking to Christ as the Lamb slain for you, you are  pardoned, completely, entirely,\" I answered; \"though your sins be as  scarlet, they shall be white as snow in God's sight.\"    His step became elastic; a brightness spread over his countenance.  \"I  see it, I see it, but I would not have believed it,\" I heard him saying  to himself.    I cannot describe all the incidents of our journey.    One painful sight was a road-gang of convicts chained by the legs.  They  were certainly a villainous-looking set, mostly doubly convicted felons.  Despair was depicted in the countenances of many.  Jacob told me that  he had known several who had been guilty of murder, that they might be  hanged, and as they thought put out of their misery; others had  committed suicide.  Yet these men were once joyous, bright-cheeked,  innocent little boys, the pride of their parents.  Some had grown into  manhood before they fell into open sin, though many probably were born  among scenes of vice, ignorant even of the name of virtue or religion.  \"Still, debased as they are, all have souls to be saved,\" I thought to  myself, and I resolved that, though I could do those poor wretches no  good, I would do my best to improve the convicts assigned to me as  servants.    We soon came to the end of the road, and struck across the country.  Here Jacob's guidance became of great value.  We were much interested by  the novel appearance of the country, so different from anything we had  seen before.    The huge gum-trees (_eucalypti_), with their evergreen,  mistletoe-looking leaves, standing apart from each other, impressed us  most.  It seemed to us as if we were walking through a large park, with  wide open spaces and clumps of trees here and there; only the leaves of  the trees hung down long and thin, with their edges upwards, and the  grass, though tall, was sparse, the blades growing apart from each  other.    In some places the ground was covered with heather, and with other  bright-coloured small flowers, but all without scent.  This was  supplied, however, in abundance from the groves of acacia, near which we  passed.  The birds with gay plumage, especially the parrots--parroquets  climbing from branch to branch or flying amid the trees--made us feel  still more that we had got into a new land.    The greatest excitement, however, was caused the first time we fell in  with a kangaroo, now so "]]]
