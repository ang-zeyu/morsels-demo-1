The _third glume_ is a  little longer than the second and the fourth, usually 5-nerved, broadly  ovate, acute, paleate, always with three stamens which come out only  after the fading of the stigmas and enlargement of the ovary in the  fourth glume. _Lodicules_ are distinct and conspicuous; _palea_ is broad  with incurved broad margins and hyaline. The _fourth glume_ is thinly  coriaceous, shining, striolate, broadly ovate, mucronate, compressed,  faintly and thinly 5-nerved and _palea_ with infolded margins. _Anthers_  are yellow. _Stigmas_ are white when young. _Lodicules_ are distinct.    It is a common grass of the wet lands met with in many parts of the  Presidency and often confused and united with _Panicum punctatum_, Burm.    _Distribution._--Throughout India and Ceylon. It is also found in  Arabia, Afghanistan, Africa and Tropical America.    [Illustration: Fig. 86.--Panicum Crus-galli.]      =Panicum Crus-galli, _L._=    It is a tufted annual with many erect branches growing to a height  varying from 2 to 3 or 4 feet and the whole plant is glabrous. Stem is  stout or slender, simple or branched.    The _leaf-sheath_ is smooth, glabrous and loose, varying in length from  2 to 6 inches, keeled. The _ligule_ is only a smooth semilunar line  without hairs. _Nodes_ are glabrous and the lower nodes bear  adventitious roots.    The _leaf-blade_ is narrowly linear-lanceolate, flat, finely acuminate,  glabrous or very minutely scabrid with a stout midrib; margin is  minutely serrate and with tubercle-based hairs near the base. The blades  of the lower leaves are longer than those in the upper and at the  junction with the sheath the blade is narrow, just as broad or less than  the sheath, and becomes broader about the middle; the length varies from  6 to 10 inches generally, also to 14 inches, and breadth at base 1/4  inch and at the middle 5/16 inch; the upper leaf-blade is generally  shorter, varying from 5 to 10 inches and very broad at the base near the  sheath, about 7/16 inch and gets gradually narrow upwards. It is  convolute when young.    The _inflorescence_ is a compound spike varying in length from 4 to 8  inches, contracted and pyramidal and always erect; the main rachis is  stout, angled with very minute hairs on the ridges and with a tuft of  bristly hairs and also tubercle-based hairs at the place of insertion of  the spikes. _Spikes_ are many (up to 16 or rarely more), simple or  branched, the lower ones longer, but getting gradually shorter upwards,  and varying in length from 1/2 to 2 inches. The rachis of the spike is  angular, with scattered tubercle-based bristly hairs.    [Illustration: Fig. 87.--Panicum Crus-galli.    1 and 2. Front and back views of spike; 3. spikelet; 4 and 5. first and  second glumes; 6 and 7. third glume and its palea; 8. fourth glume,  front and back view; 9. ovary, anthers and lodicules.]    The _spikelets_ are turgid, densely packed on one side of the rachis in  three to five rows, sessile or subsessile, sub-globose or ovoid, with  unequal tubercle-based bristly hairs on the nerves of the glumes and  with short minute hairs on the outer surface of the glumes, 1/12 to 1/8  inch; awn 1/4 inch to 5/16 inch.    There are four _glumes_. The _first glume_ is 1/3 to 1/2 of the third  glume, suborbicular, abruptly acuminate or rarely mucronate and 5-nerved  (very rarely 5- to 7-nerved), clasping at base and margins thinly  ciliolate. The _second glume_ is ovate oblong, short, awned and  5-nerved; sometimes with partial nerves at the apex between the central  and the lateral nerves, and then 5- to 7- or 5- to 9-nerved, hispidly  hairy on the nerves, margins ciliolate. The _third glume_ is as long as  the second, ovate-oblong and the apex abruptly ending in a stout scabrid  nerved awn, varying in length from 1/4 to 3/8 inch, rarely 1 inch; 5- to  7-nerved (two partial at tip), paleate and sometimes with three stamens;  _palea_ is hyaline, ovate-oblong with infolded margins. The _fourth  glume_ is smooth, shining, broadly oblong, faintly 5-nerved, apex  rounded or cuspidate with a few cilia; paleate with a single bisexual  flower; _palea_ is similar to the glume in structure. _Anthers_ are  orange yellow, and _lodicules_ are very small. _Stigmas_ are white.  Grain is smooth and ovoid.    This grass grows in paddy fields and wet places generally. It is  considered to be a very good fodder grass in Australia and America. This  is the \"Barn-yard\" grass of the Americans, highly valued as a fodder  grass.    _Distribution._--Throughout India in wet places and in paddy fields.      =Panicum stagninum, _Retz._=    It is an annual. The stems are glabrous, creeping and somewhat prostrate  at the base, and the upper portion is erect, 3 to 4 feet long, and  rooting at the nodes in the geniculate portion of the stem.    The _leaf-sheath_ is smooth, striate, glabrous, sometimes pubescent  about the lower nodes, varying in length from 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 inches. The  _ligule_ is distinct, consisting of a fringe of stiff hairs.    The _leaf-blade_ is linear-lanceolate, acuminate or acute, base rounded,  glabrous, smooth below, especially in the lower part, and scabrid above  and in the upper part, 6 to 12 inches long, by 1/4 to 3/8 inch; the  lower leaves have their blades somewhat narrower at the base than in the  middle, but the blades in the upper part of the stem and in the middle  are of the same breadth; margins are very minutely serrate.    [Illustration: Fig. 88.--Panicum stagninum.    1. Front view of a portion of spike; 2. back view of the same; 3 and 4.  front and back views of a spikelet; 5, 6 and 7. the first, second and  the third glume, respectively; 8. palea of the third glume with its  anthers; 9. front and back view of fourth glume; 10. the ovary, stamens  and lodicules.]    The _inflorescence_ is 4 to 8 inches long; the main _rachis_ is angular,  grooved, scabrid on the ridges. The _spikes_ are 7 to 10 inches,  alternate, pale green or purplish, rather distant, spreading or suberect  (never erect) 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches long, sessile and with a tuft of  bristly hairs at the base; the rachis of the spike is angular, grooved  with scattered bulbous-based bristles on the ridges.    The _spikelets_ are four ranked, ovoid-lanceolate, 1/8 to 1/6 inch long  without the awn, somewhat flattened on one side and gibbous on the  other, pale green or purplish, with equal bulbous-based bristly hairs on  the nerves.    There are four _glumes_. The _first glume_ is half of the third glume,  thin, membranous, hairy, broadly ovate, abruptly cuspidate at the apex,  and acuminate, 5-nerved (rarely 3-nerved). The _second glume_ is broadly  ovate-lanceolate, concave, acuminate, short awned, 5-nerved with two  partial nerves one on each side of the central nerve (7- to 9-nerved at  the tip), hairs on nerves, a few tubercled. The _third glume_ is similar  to the second, broadly ovate-lanceolate, awned, awn 1/8 to 1/4 inch,  paleate with usually three stamens, occasionally neuter. _Lodicules_ are  present. The _fourth glume_ is chartaceous, shining, smooth  ovate-oblong, apex cuspidate, with a few hairs on the edges at the apex,  faintly 5-nerved. The _anthers_ within this glume come out before those  of the third glume. _Anthers_ are three, yellowish and _lodicules_ are  conspicuous though small.    In this grass very often, purple streaks or bands occur across the leaf  blades and the sheath and the spikelets become purple on one side as is  met with in P. colonum. This grass is occasionally found in the paddy  fields either alone, or along with _Panicum Crus-galli_.    _Distribution._--Throughout the Madras and the Bombay Presidencies and  in Ceylon in wet places especially in cultivated ground and in ditches.  Occurs more or less throughout India.    [Illustration: Fig. 89.--Panicum colonum.]      =Panicum colonum, _L._=    This is a slender annual growing to a height of 2 feet. The stems are  creeping below, erect above, and with roots in the lower internodes of  the decumbent part of the stem, smooth, dull green or partly purplish.    The _leaf-sheath_ is glabrous and sharply keeled. The _nodes_ are  glabrous or obscurely pubescent. There is no _ligule_.    The _leaf-blade_ is narrow, lanceolate, acuminate, glabrous but  sometimes tubercle-based hairs occur just on the margin at the base of  the leaf-blade close to the white band, varying in length from 1 to 6  inches and in breadth 3/16 to 5/16 inch; the margin is minutely and  distantly serrate, midrib is quite distinct and there are three main  veins on each side and three or four smaller between main ones. The  blades of the lower leaves are narrow at the base and broader at about  the middle but those of the upper are equally broad at the base, as well  as at the middle.    [Illustration: Fig. 90.--Panicum colonum.    1 and 2.

The _spikelets_ are small green or partly purplish 1/12 to 1/10 inch  long, globosely ovoid, acute, pubescent with minute hairs on the outer  surface of the glumes and bristly hairs on the nerves, all on one side,  sessile or very shortly pedicelled, two or three from a node, one or two  barren, 3- to 5-seriate.    There are four _glumes_ in the spikelet. The _first glume_ is about half  of the third glume, broadly ovate or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2407"],[0,"Die Leiden des jungen Werther — Band 1 (#12)"],[1,"en!  \"sie  stand auf, und ich ward erweckt und erschüttert, blieb sitzen und  hielt ihre Hand.--\"Wir wollen fort\", sagte sie, \"es wird Zeit\".--Sie  wollte ihre Hand zurückziehen, und ich hielt sie fester.--\"wir werden  uns wieder sehen\" rief ich, \"wir werden uns finden, unter allen  Gestalten werden wir uns erkennen.
