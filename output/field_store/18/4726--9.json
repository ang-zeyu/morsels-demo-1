But sacrifice for gain,    Offered for good repute, be sure that this,    O Best of Bharatas! is Rajas-rite,    With stamp of \"passion.\" And a sacrifice    Offered against the laws, with no due dole    Of food-giving, with no accompaniment    Of hallowed hymn, nor largesse to the priests,    In faithless celebration, call it vile,    The deed of \"Darkness!\"--lost!      Worship of gods    Meriting worship; lowly reverence    Of Twice-borns, Teachers, Elders; Purity,    Rectitude, and the Brahmacharya's vow,    And not to injure any helpless thing,--    These make a true religiousness of Act.      Words causing no man woe, words ever true,    Gentle and pleasing words, and those ye say    In murmured reading of a Sacred Writ,--    These make the true religiousness of Speech.      Serenity of soul, benignity,    Sway of the silent Spirit, constant stress    To sanctify the Nature,--these things make    Good rite, and true religiousness of Mind.      Such threefold faith, in highest piety    Kept, with no hope of gain, by hearts devote,    Is perfect work of Sattwan, true belief.      Religion shown in act of proud display    To win good entertainment, worship, fame,    Such--say I--is of Rajas, rash and vain.      Religion followed by a witless will    To torture self, or come at power to hurt    Another,--'tis of Tamas, dark and ill.      The gift lovingly given, when one shall say    \"Now must I gladly give!\" when he who takes    Can render nothing back; made in due place,    Due time, and to a meet recipient,    Is gift of Sattwan, fair and profitable.      The gift selfishly given, where to receive    Is hoped again, or when some end is sought,    Or where the gift is proffered with a grudge,    This is of Rajas, stained with impulse, ill.      The gift churlishly flung, at evil time,    In wrongful place, to base recipient,    Made in disdain or harsh unkindliness,    Is gift of Tamas, dark; it doth not bless![FN#37]      HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XVII. OF THE  BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled \"Sraddhatrayavibhagayog,\"    Or \"The Book of Religion by the Threefold Kinds of Faith.\"            CHAPTER XVIII        Arjuna.    Fain would I better know, Thou Glorious One!    The very truth--Heart's Lord!--of Sannyas,    Abstention; and  enunciation, Lord!    Tyaga; and what separates these twain!      Krishna.    The poets rightly teach that Sannyas    Is the foregoing of all acts which spring    Out of desire; and their wisest say    Tyaga is renouncing fruit of acts.      There be among the saints some who have held    All action sinful, and to be renounced;    And some who answer, \"Nay! the goodly acts--    As worship, penance, alms--must be performed!\"    Hear now My sentence, Best of Bharatas!      'Tis well set forth, O Chaser of thy Foes!    Renunciation is of threefold form,    And Worship, Penance, Alms, not to be stayed;    Nay, to be gladly done; for all those three    Are purifying waters for true souls!      Yet must be practised even those high works    In yielding up attachment, and all fruit    Produced by works. This is My judgment, Prince!    This My insuperable and fixed decree!      Abstaining from a work by right prescribed    Never is meet! So to abstain doth spring    From \"Darkness,\" and Delusion teacheth it.    Abstaining from a work grievous to flesh,    When one saith \"'Tis unpleasing!\" this is null!    Such an one acts from \"passion;\" nought of gain    Wins his Renunciation! But, Arjun!    Abstaining from attachment to the work,    Abstaining from rewardment in the work,    While yet one doeth it full faithfully,    Saying, \"Tis right to do!\" that is \"true \" act    And abstinence! Who doeth duties so,    Unvexed if his work fail, if it succeed    Unflattered, in his own heart justified,    Quit of debates and doubts, his is \"true\" act:    For, being in the body, none may stand    Wholly aloof from act; yet, who abstains    From profit of his acts is abstinent.      The fruit of labours, in the lives to come,    Is threefold for all men,--Desirable,    And Undesirable, and mixed of both;    But no fruit is at all where no work was.      Hear from me, Long-armed Lord! the makings five    Which go to every act, in Sankhya taught    As necessary. First the force; and then    The agent; next, the various instruments;    Fourth, the especial effort; fifth, the God.    What work soever any mortal doth    Of body, mind, or speech, evil or good,    By these five doth he that. Which being thus,    Whoso, for lack of knowledge, seeth himself    As the sole actor, knoweth nought at all    And seeth nought. Therefore, I say, if one--    Holding aloof from self--with unstained mind    Should slay all yonder host, being bid to slay,    He doth not slay; he is not bound thereby!      Knowledge, the thing known, and the mind which knows,    These make the threefold starting-ground of act.    The act, the actor, and the instrument,    These make the threefold total of the deed.    But knowledge, agent, act, are differenced    By three dividing qualities. Hear now    Which be the qualities dividing them.      There is \"true\" Knowledge. Learn thou it is this:    To see one changeless Life in all the Lives,    And in the Separate, One Inseparable.    There is imperfect Knowledge: that which sees    The separate existences apart,    And, being separated, holds them real.    There is false Knowledge: that which blindly clings    To one as if 'twere all, seeking no Cause,    Deprived of light, narrow, and dull, and \"dark.\"      There is \"right\" Action: that which being enjoined--    Is wrought without attachment, passionlessly,    For duty, not for love, nor hate, nor gain.    There is \"vain\" Action: that which men pursue    Aching to satisfy desires, impelled    By sense of self, with all-absorbing stress:    This is of Rajas--passionate and vain.    There is \"dark\" Action: when one doth a thing    Heedless of issues, heedless of the hurt    Or wrong for others, heedless if he harm    His own soul--'tis of Tamas, black and bad!      There is the \"rightful\"doer. He who acts    Free from self-seeking, humble, resolute,    Steadfast, in good or evil hap the same,    Content to do aright-he \"truly\" acts.    There is th' \"impassioned\" doer. He that works    From impulse, seeking profit, rude and bold    To overcome, unchastened; slave by turns    Of sorrow and of joy: of Rajas he!    And there be evil doers; loose of heart,    Low-minded, stubborn, fraudulent, remiss,    Dull, slow, despondent--children of the \"dark.\"      Hear, too, of Intellect and Steadfastness    The threefold separation, Conqueror-Prince!    How these are set apart by Qualities.      Good is the Intellect which comprehends    The coming forth and going back of life,    What must be done, and what must not be done,    What should be feared, and what should not be feared,    What binds and what emancipates the soul:    That is of Sattwan, Prince! of \"soothfastness.\"    Marred is the Intellect which, knowing right    And knowing wrong, and what is well to do    And what must not be done, yet understands    Nought with firm mind, nor as the calm truth is:    This is of Rajas, Prince! and \"passionate!\"    Evil is Intellect which, wrapped in gloom,    Looks upon wrong as right, and sees all things    Contrariwise of Truth. O Pritha's Son!    That is of Tamas, \"dark\" and desperate!      Good is the steadfastness whereby a man    Masters his beats of heart, his very breath    Of life, the action of his senses; fixed    In never-shaken faith and piety:    That is of Sattwan, Prince! \"soothfast\" and fair!    Stained is the steadfastness whereby a man    Holds to his duty, purpose, effort, end,    For life's sake, and the love of goods to gain,    Arjuna! 'tis of Rajas, passion-stamped!    Sad is the steadfastness wherewith the fool    Cleaves to his sloth, his sorrow, and his fears,    His folly and despair. This--Pritha's Son!--    Is born of Tamas, \"dark\" and miserable!        Hear further, Chief of Bharatas! from Me    The threefold kinds of Pleasure which there be.      Good Pleasure is the pleasure that endures,    Banishing pain for aye; bitter at first    As poison to the soul, but afterward    Sweet as the taste of Amrit. Drink of that!    It springeth in the Spirit's deep content.    And painful Pleasure springeth from the bond    Between the senses and the sense-world. Sweet    As Amrit is its first taste, but its last    Bitter as poison. 'Tis of Rajas, Prince!    And foul and \"dark\" the Pleasure is which springs    From sloth and sin and foolishness; at first    And at the last, and all the way of life    The soul bewildering. 'Tis of Tamas, Prince!      For nothing lives on earth, nor 'midst the gods    In utmost heaven, but hath its being bound    With these three Qualities, by Nature framed.      The work of Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas,    And Sudras, O thou Slayer of thy Foes!    Is fixed by reason of the Qualities    Planted in each:      A Brahman's virtues, Prince!    Born of his nature, are serenity,    Self-mastery, religion, purity,    Patience, uprightness, learning, and to know    The truth of things which be. A Kshatriya's pride,    Born of his nature, lives in valour, fire,    Constancy, skilfulness, spirit in fight,    And open-handedness and noble mien,    As of a lord of men. A Vaisya's task,    Born with his nature, is to till the ground,    Tend cattle, venture trade. A Sudra's state,    Suiting his nature, is to minister.      Whoso performeth--diligent, content--    The work allotted him, whate'er it be,    Lays hold of perfectness! Hear how a man    Findeth perfection, being so content:    He findeth it through worship--wrought by work--    Of Him that is the Source of all which lives,    Of HIM by Whom the universe was stretched.      Better thine own work is, though done with fault,    Than doing others' work, ev'n excellently.    He shall not fall in sin who fronts the task    Set him by Nature's hand!

The bullets were spraying all about the galloping dog, kicking up tiny  swirls of dust at his heels and in front of him and to either side.    Mahan, watching, with streaming eyes and blaspheming lips, recalled the  French sergeant's theory that Bruce bore a charmed life. And he prayed  that Vivier might be right. But in his prayer was very little faith.  For under such a fusillade it seemed impossible that at least one  highpower bullet should not reach the collie before the slope could be  traversed. A fast-running dog is not an easy mark for a  bullet--especially if the dog be a collie, with a trace of  wolf--ancestry in his gait. A dog, at best, does not gallop straight  ahead as does a horse. There is almost always a sidewise lilt to his  run.    Bruce was still further aided by the shell-plowed condition of the  hillside. Again and again he had to break his stride, to leap some  shell-hole. Often he had to encircle such holes. More than once he  bounded headlong down into a gaping crater and scrambled up its far  side. These erratic moves, and the nine-hundred-yard distance (a  distance that was widening at every second) made the sharpshooters'  task anything but an exact science.    Mahan's gaze followed the dog's every step. Bruce had cleared more than  three-fourths of the slope. The top-sergeant permitted himself the  luxury of a broad grin.    \"I'll buy Vivier all the red-ink wine he can gargle, next pay-day!\" he  vowed. \"He was dead right about the dog. No bullet was ever molded that  can get--\"    Mahan broke off in his exultation, with an explosive oath, as a new  note in the firing smote upon his trained hearing.    \"The swine!\" he roared. \"The filthy, unsportsmanly, dog-eating Prussian  swine! They're turning MACHINE-GUNS on him!\"    In place of the intermittent rattle of rifleshots now came the purring  cough of rapidfire guns. The bullets hit the upper hillside in swathes,  beginning a few yards behind the flying collie and moving upward toward  him like a sweeping of an unseen scythe.    \"That's the wind-up!\" groaned Mahan. \"Lord, send me an even break  against one of those Hun machinegunners some day! If--\"    Again Mahan failed to finish his train of thought. He stared  open-mouthed up the hill. Almost at the very summit, within a rod or  two of the point where the crest would intervene between him and his  foes, Bruce whirled in mid-air and fell prone.    The fast-following swaths of machine-gun bullets had not reached him.  But another German enemy had. From behind a heap of offal, on the  crest, a yellow-gray dog had sprung, and had launched himself bodily  upon Bruce's flank as the unnoticing collie had flashed past him.    The assailant was an enormous and hyena-like German police-dog. He was  one of the many of his breed that were employed (for work or food) in  the German camps, and which used to sneak away from their hard-kicking  soldier-owners to ply a more congenial trade as scavengers, and as  seekers for the dead. For, in traits as well as in looks, the  police-dog often emulates the ghoulish hyena.    Seeing the approaching collie (always inveterate foe of his kind), the  police-dog had gauged the distance and had launched his surprise attack  with true Teuton sportsmanship and efficiency. Down went Bruce under  the fierce weight that crashed against his shoulder. But before the  other could gain his coveted throat-grip, Bruce was up again. Like a  furry whirlwind he was at the police-dog, fighting more like a wolf  than a civilized collie--tearing into his opponent with a maniac rage,  snapping, slashing; his glittering white fangs driving at a dozen  vulnerable points in a single second.    It was as though Bruce knew he had no time to waste from his  life-and-death mission. He could not elude this enemy, so he must  finish him as quickly as possible.    \"Give me your rifle!\" sputtered Mahan to the soldier nearest him. \"I'll  take one potshot at that Prussian cur, before the machine-guns get the  two of 'em. Even if I hit Bruce by mistake, he'd rather die by a  Christian Yankee-made bullet than--\"    Just then the scythelike machine-gun fire reached the hillcrest  combatants. And in the same instant a shell smote the ground,  apparently between them. Up went a geyser of smoke and dirt and rocks.  When the cloud settled, there was a deep gully in the ground where a  moment earlier Bruce and the police-dog had waged their death-battle.    \"That settles it!\" muttered the colonel.    And he went to make ready for such puny defense as his men might hope  to put up against the German rush.    While these futile preparations were still under way, terrific  artillery fire burst from the Allied batteries behind the hill,  shielding the Here-We-Come trenches with a curtain of fire whose lower  folds draped themselves right unlovingly around the German lines. Under  cover of this barrage, down the hill swarmed the Allied reserves!    \"How did you get word?\" demanded the astonished colonel of the  Here-We-Comes, later in the day.    \"From your note, of course,\" replied the general he had questioned.  \"The collie--old Bruce.\"    \"Bruce?\" babbled the colonel foolishly.    \"Of course,\" answered the general. \"Who else? But I'm afraid it's the  last message he'll ever deliver. He came rolling and staggering up to  headquarters--one mass of blood, and three inches thick with caked  dirt. His right side was torn open from a shell-wound, and he had two  machine-gun bullets in his shoulder. He's deaf as a post, too, from  shell-shock. He tumbled over in a heap on the steps of headquarters.  But he GOT there. That's Bruce, all over. That's the best type of  collie, all over. Some of us were for putting him out of his misery  with a shot through the head. We'd have done it, too, if it had been  any other dog. But the surgeon-general waded in and took a hand in the  game--carried Bruce to his own quarters. We left him working over the  dog himself. And he swears Bruce will pull through!\"        CHAPTER IV. When Eyes Were No Use    \"Yes, it's an easy enough trade to pick up,\" lectured Top-Sergeant  Mahan, formerly of the regular army. \"You've just got to remember a few  things. But you've got to keep on remembering those few, all the time.  If you forget one of 'em, it's the last bit of forgetting you're ever  likely to do.\"    Top-Sergeant Mahan, of the mixed French-and-American regiment known as  \"Here-We-Come,\" was squatting at ease on the trench firing-step. From  that professorial seat he was dispensing useful knowledge to a group of  fellow-countrymen-newly arrived from the base, to pad the  \"Here-We-Come\" ranks, which had been thinned at the Rache attack.    \"What sort of things have we got to remember, Sergeant?\" jauntily asked  a lanky Missourian. \"We've got the drill pretty pat; and the trench  instructions and--\"    \"Gee!\" ejaculated Mahan. \"I had no idea of that! Then why don't you  walk straight ahead into Berlin? If you know all you say you do, about  war, there's nothing more for you to learn. I'll drop a line to General  Foch and suggest to him that you rookies be detailed to teach the game  to us oldsters.\"    \"I didn't mean to be fresh,\" apologized the jaunty one. \"Won't you go  ahead and tell us the things we need to remember?\"    \"Well,\" exhorted Mahan, appeased by the newcomer's humility, \"there  aren't so many of them, after all. Learn to duck, when you hear a  Minnie grunt or a whizzbang cut loose; or a five-nine begin to whimper.  Learn not to bother to duck when the rifles get to jabbering--for  you'll never hear the bullet that gets you. Study the nocturnal habits  of machine-guns and the ways of snipers and the right time not to play  the fool. And keep saying to yourself: 'The bullet ain't molded that  can get ME!' Mean it when you say it. When you've learned those few  things, the rest of the war-game is dead easy.\"    \"Except,\" timidly amended old Sergeant Vivier, the gray little  Frenchman, \"except when eyes are--are what you call it, no use.\"  \"That's right,\" assented Mahan. \"In the times when eyes are no use, all  rules fail. And then the only thing you can do is to trust to your  Yankee luck. I remember--\"    \"'When eyes are no use'?\" repeated the recruit. \"If you mean after  dark, at night--haven't we got the searchlights and the starshells and  all that?\"    \"Son,\" replied Mahan, \"we have. Though I don't see how you ever guessed  such an important secret. But since you know everything, maybe you'll  just kindly tell us what good all the lights in the world are going to  do us when the filthy yellow-gray fog begins to ooze up out of the mud  and the shell-holes, and the filthy gray mist oozes down from the  clouds to meet it. Fog is the one thing that all the war-science won't  overcome. A fogpenetrator hasn't been invented yet. If it had been,  there'd be many a husky lad living today, who has gone West, this past  few years, on account of the fogs. Fog is the boche's pet. It gives  Fritzy a lovely chance to creep up or, us. It--\"    \"It is the helper of US, too,\" suggested old Vivier. \"More than one  time, it has kept me safe when I was on patrol. And did it not help to  save us at Rache, when--\"    \"The fog may have helped us, one per cent, at Rache,\" admitted Mahan.  \"But Bruce did ninety-nine per cent of the saving.\"    \"A Scotch general?\" asked the recruit, as Vivier nodded cordial  affirmation of Mahan's words, and as others of the old-timers muttered  approval.    \"No,\" contradicted Mahan. \"A Scotch collie. If you were dry behind the  ears, in this life, you wouldn't have to ask who Bruce is.\"    \"I don't understand,\" faltered the rookie, suspicious of a possible  joke.    \"You will soon,\" Mahan told him. \"Bruce will be here to-day. I heard  the K.O. saying the big dog is going to be sent down with some  dispatches or something, from headquarters. It's his first trip since  he was cut up so.\"    \"I am saving him--this!\" proclaimed Vivier,"]]]
