I suppose Ringg's  told you what a tyrant I am? What do you want, feathertop?\"    Bart remembered being told that this was the Lhari equivalent of \"Kid\"  or \"Youngster.\" He fumbled in the capacious folds of his cloak for his  papers. His voice sounded shrill, even to himself.    \"Bartol son of Berihun in respectful greeting, _rieko mori_.\"  (\"Honorable old-bald-one,\" the Lhari equivalent of \"sir.\") \"Ringg told  me there is a vacancy among the Astrogators, and I want to sign out.\"    Unmistakably, Vorongil's snort was laughter.    \"So you've been talking, Ringg?\"    Ringg retorted, \"Better that I tell one man than that you have to hunt  the planet over--or run the long haul with the drive-room watches short  by one man.\"    \"Well, well, you're right,\" Vorongil growled. He glared at Bart. \"On the  last planet, one of our men disappeared. Jumped ship!\" The creases  around his eyes deepened, troubled. \"Probably just gone on the drift,  sight-seeing, but I wish he'd told me. As it is, I wonder if he's been  hurt, killed, kidnaped.\"    Ringg said, \"Who'd dare? It would be reported.\"    Bart knew, with a cold chill, that the missing Klanerol had not simply  gone \"on the drift.\" No Lhari port would ever see Klanerol, Second Class  Astrogator, again.    \"Bartol,\" mused the captain, riffling the forged papers. \"Served on the  Polaris run. Hm--you _are_ a good long way off your orbit, aren't you?  Never been out that way myself. All right, I'll take you on. You can do  system programming? Good. Rating in Second Galaxy mathematics?\"    He nodded, hauled out a sheet of thin, wax-coated fabric and his claws  made rapid imprints in the surface. He passed it to Bart, pointed. Bart  hesitated, and Vorongil said impatiently, \"Standard agreement, no hidden  clauses. Put your mark on it, feathertop.\"    Bart realized it was something like a fingerprint they wanted. _You'll  pass anything but X-rays._ He pressed the top of one claw into the wax.  Vorongil nodded, shoved it on a shelf without looking at it.    \"So much for that,\" said Ringg, laughing, as they came out. \"The Bald  One was in a good temper. I'm going to the port and celebrate, not that  this dim place is very festive. You?\"    \"I--I think I'll stay aboard.\"    \"Well, if you change your mind, I'll be down there somewhere,\" Ringg  said. \"See you later, shipmate.\" He raised his closed fist in farewell,  and went.    Bart stood in the corridor, feeling astounded and strange. He _belonged_  here! He had a right to be on board the ship! He wasn't quite sure what  to do next.    A Lhari, as short and fat as a Lhari could possibly be and still be a  Lhari, came or rather waddled out of the captain's office. He saw Bartol  and called, \"Are you the new First Class? I'm Rugel, coordinator.\"    Rugel had a huge cleft darkish scar across his lip, and there were two  bands on his cloak. He was completely bald, and he puffed when he  walked. \"Vorongil asked me to show you around. You'll share quarters  with Ringg--no sense shifting another man. Come down and see the chart  rooms--or do you want to leave your kit in your cabin first?\"    \"I don't have much,\" Bart said.    Rugel's seamed lip widened. \"That's the way--travel light when you're on  the drift,\" he confirmed.    Rugel took him down to the drive rooms, and here for a moment, in wonder  and awe, Bart almost forgot his disguise. The old Lhari led him to the  huge computer which filled one wall of the room, and Bart was smitten  with the universality of mathematics. Here was something he _knew_ he  could handle.    He could do this programming, easily enough. But as he stood before the  banks of complex, yet beautifully familiar levers, the sheer exquisite  complexity of it overcame him. To compute the movements of thousands of  stars, all moving at different speeds in different directions in the  vast swirling directionless chaos of the Universe--and yet to be sure  that every separate movement would come out to within a quarter of a  mile! It was something that no finite brain--man or Lhari--could ever  accomplish, yet their limited brains had built these computers that  _could_ do it.    Rugel watched him, laughing softly. \"Well, you'll have enough time down  here. I like to have youngsters who are still in the middle of a love  affair with their work. Come along, and I'll show you your cabin.\"    Rugel left him in a cabin amidships; small and cramped, but tidy, two of  the oval bunks slung at opposite ends, a small table between them, and  drawers filled with pamphlets and manuals and maps. Furtively, ashamed  of himself, yet driven by necessity, Bart searched Ringg's belongings,  wanting to get some idea of what possessions he ought to own. He looked  around the shower and toilet facilities with extra care--this was  something he _couldn't_ slip up on and be considered even halfway  normal. He was afraid Ringg would come in, and see him staring curiously  at something as ordinary, to a Lhari, as a cake of soap.    He decided to go down to the port again and look around the shops. He  was not afraid of being unable to handle his work. What he feared was  something subtler--that the small items of everyday living, something as  simple as a nail file, would betray him.    On his way he looked into the Recreation Lounge, filled with comfortable  seats, vision-screens, and what looked like simple pinball machines and  mechanical games of skill. There were also stacks of tapereels and  headsets for listening, not unlike those humans used. Bart felt  fascinated, and wanted to explore, but decided he could do that later.    Somehow he took the wrong turn coming out of the Recreation Lounge, and  went through a door where the sudden dimming of lights told him he was  in Mentorian quarters. The sudden darkness made him stumble, thrust out  his hands to keep from falling, and an unmistakably human voice said,  \"Ouch!\"    \"I'm sorry,\" Bart said in Universal, without thinking.    \"I admit the lights are dim,\" said the voice tartly, and Bart found  himself looking down, as his eyes adjusted to the new light level, at a  girl.    She was small and slight, in a metallic blue cloak that swept out, like  wings, around her thin shoulders; the hood framed a small, kittenlike  face. She was a Mentorian, and she was human, and Bart's eyes rested  with comfort on her face; she, on the other hand, was looking up with  anxiety and uneasy distrust. _That's right--I'm a Lhari, a nonhuman  freak!_    \"I seem to have missed my way.\"    \"What are you looking for, sir? The medical quarters are through here.\"    \"I'm looking for the elevator down to the crew exits.\"    \"Through here,\" she said, reopening the door through which he had come,  and shading her large, lovely, long-lashed eyes with a slender hand.  \"You took the wrong turn. Are you new on board? I thought all ships were  laid out exactly alike.\"    \"I've only worked on passenger ships.\"    \"I believe they are somewhat different,\" said the girl in good Lhari.  \"Well, that is your way, sir.\"    He felt as if he had been snubbed and dismissed.    \"What is your name?\"    She stiffened as if about to salute. \"Meta of the house of Marnay Three,  sir.\"    Bart realized he was doing something wholly out of character for a  Lhari--chatting casually with a Mentorian. With a wistful glance at the  pretty girl, he said a stiff \"Thank you\" and went down the ramp she had  indicated. He felt horribly lonely. Being a freak wasn't going to be  much fun.          CHAPTER EIGHT      He saw the girl again next day, when they checked in for blastoff. She  was seated at a small desk, triangular like so much of the Lhari  furniture, checking a register as they came out of the Decontam room,  making sure they downed their greenish solution of microorganisms.    \"Papers, please?\" She marked, and Bart noticed that she was using a red  pencil.    \"Bartol,\" she said aloud. \"Is that how you pronounce it?\" She made small  scribbles in a sort of shorthand with the red pencil, then made other  marks with the black one in Lhari; he supposed the red marks were her  own private memoranda, unreadable by the Lhari.    \"Next, please.\" She handed a cup of the greenish stuff to Ringg, behind  him. Bart went down toward the drive room, and to his own surprise,  found himself wishing the girl were a mathematician rather than a medic.  It would have been pleasant to watch her down there.    Old Rugel, on duty in the drive room, watched Bart strap himself in  before the computer. \"Make sure you check all dials at null,\" he  reminded him, and Bart felt a last surge of panic.    This was his first cruise, except for practice runs at the Academy! Yet  his rating called him an experienced man on the Polaris run. He'd had  the Lhari training tape, which was supposed to condition his responses,  but would it? He tried to clench his fists, drove a claw into his palm,  winced, and commanded himself to stay calm and keep his mind on what he  was doing.    It calmed him to make the routine check of his dials.    \"Strapdown check,\" said a Lhari with a yellowed crest and a rasping  voice. \"New man, eh?\" He gave Bart's straps perfunctory tugs at  shoulders and waist, tightened a buckle. \"Karol son of Garin.\"    Bells rang in the ship, and Bart felt the odd, tonic touch of fear.  _This was it._    Vorongil strode through the door, his banded cloak sweeping behind him,  and took the control couch.    \"Ready from fueling room, sir.\"    \"Position,\" Vorongil snapped.    Bart heard himself reading off a string of figures in Lhari. His voice  sounded perfectly calm.    \"Communication.\"    \"Clear channels from Pylon Dispatch, sir.\" It was old Rugel's voice.    \"Well,\" Vorongil said, slowly and almost reflectively, \"let's take her  up then.\"    He touched some controls. The humming grew. Then, swift, hard and  crushing, weight mashed Bart against"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2082"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#12)"],[1," thing; but as I am no longer of an age to inspire you with the passion  which I should feel towards you, I content myself with your friendship.  I have no enemy here, and no wish to hurt any person. Thus you need not  fear that I shall urge you to any measures that might compromise you. It  is the hatred of the kingdom that you will have to fear. France is about  to march in a better track, and the best plan is to follow its lead.  It pains me, madame, to use language which may appear severe to you; we  ought only to talk to you of your beauty and the love which it inspires.  But in your situation, even that beauty may serve the interests of  France, and it is for that motive that I come to solicit you.\"    I replied to M. de Chauvelin with equal frankness. I told him that my  sole intentions were to confine myself to the circle of my duties; that  I had none but to please the king, and no intention of mixing myself  up with state affairs. This was my plan I can assure you. I flattered  myself that I could follow it, not dreaming of those political nuisances  into which I was precipitated in spite of myself. I added, nevertheless,  that in my situation, which was delicate, I would not refuse the  counsels of a faithful servant of the king, and that under this title M.  de Chauvelin should be consulted on important occasions.    The marquis de Chauvelin had too much good sense, too much knowledge of  the world, not to perceive a refusal concealed under this politeness.  The secret inclination of my heart had already led me to select the duc  d'Aiguillon for my director, and I could not reconcile myself to any  other. He contented himself with asking me again for my friendship,  which I willingly accorded him, and I have always found myself fortunate  in his. Thus did I accept the offers of service from the prince de  Soubise, the duc de la Vauguyon, and the marquis de Chauvelin.    A fourth sought to swell the ranks; the comte, afterwards prince, de  Montbarrey. This gentleman made up in pretensions for what he lacked  in talent. He was weak, self-important, selfish, fond of women, and  endeavored to preserve all the airs of a man of good breeding in the  midst of the grossest debauchery. He was full of respect for himself and  his house, of which in time of need he could cite the whole genealogy.  His nomination was a real scandal; no one dreamt of his ever being  minister of war. It was one of the thousand follies of old Maurepas,  whom the late king knew well, and called the ballad-maker of the  council.    The comte de Montbarrey, whom I had known at Paris, came to me one fine  day, fully powdered, performed, and apparelled. He had a smile on  his lip, a loud tone, and an insolent look. He came not to ask  my friendship, but my obedience. He told me that he loved me to  distraction, and of course my head must be equally towards him. He  amused me. I let him run out the full length of his line; and when he  had spun it all out, I said to him, \"Monsieur, be so good as to call me  to the recollection of madame de Merfort.\"    She was one of the gambling ladies, and at her house I had formerly met  the chevalier de Montbarrey. My reply confounded him: he saw that he had  gone the wrong way to work with me; and, raising the siege, he left me  excessively embarrassed.    Figure to yourself, my friend, what confidence a man, lost in the  crowd of lower courtiers, could inspire me with; for to judge of the  proceedings of the comte de Montbarrey, it would have been necessary  to have seen him as he then was, and not what he became since the  imbecility of M. de Maurepas. When I told comte Jean of his visit, he  would not believe such insolence. You must know that my brother-in-law  also wished to direct me, but I did not consider him sufficiently  clever. His marvellous genius was eclipsed in politics. He swore at my  ingratitude, and I could only appease him by an offering of plenty of  money.    In the midst of this cross-fire of intrigues, one was devised against me  which might have terminated in my ruin; but, thanks to the indefatigable  activity of comte Jean, only served to fix me more firmly in my  situation. Lebel, of whom I have said nothing for this age, came to me  one day: his face was sad, and his look serious. By his manner I augured  that my reign had passed, and that I must quit my post. I awaited what  he should say with mortal impatience. At length he began thus:    \"Madame, you have many bitter enemies, who are laboring to effect your  ruin with a blood-thirstiness which nothing can assuage. They have now  spread a report that you are not married. This infamous calumny--\"    \"Ah, is that all?\" said I with joy; \"no, my dear Lebel, this time they  do not calumniate me. The worthy creatures for once are right.\"    \"What,\" said Lebel, in a tone of alarm almost comic, \"what, are you  really not married?\"    \"No.\"    \"Are you not the wife of the comte Guillaume du Barry?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then you have deceived the king, and played with me.\"    \"Lebel, my friend, take another tone. No one has any right to complain.  You have given me to the king as a person to please him; I do so. The  rest can be no matter of yours.\"    \"Pardon me, madame; it is a matter of the greatest consequence to me. I  am terribly compromised in this affair, and you with me.\"    Lebel told me that the duchesse de Grammont had begged him to call upon  her, and had bitterly reproached him about the mistress he had procured  for the king; the duchesse affirmed that I was a nameless and unmarried  creature; and added, that it was his duty to make the king acquainted  with these particulars, unless I, the pretended wife of du Barry, would  consent to go to England when a large pension should be assured to me.    \"No, my dear Lebel, I will not go to England; I will remain in France,  at Versailles, at the chateau. If I am not married I will be; the thing  is easily managed.\"    Lebel, somewhat assured, begged me to send for comte Jean, and when he  came he (Lebel) recommenced his tale of grief.    \"You are drowning yourself in a glass of water,\" said my future  brother-in-law to him, beginning to treat him with less ceremony; \"go  back to the duchesse de Grammont, and tell her that madame was married  at Toulouse. She will have an inquiry set on foot; in the mean while my  brother will arrive, and the marriage will take place. Then we will show  the rebels a real comtesse du Barry; and whether my sister-in-law be  a lady of six months' standing or only of yesterday, that is of no  consequence to the king of France.\"    After this conversation Lebel delivered the message to the duchesse  de Grammont, who told him that she should write to Toulouse to the  attorney-general. This was what the comte Jean wished and he was  prepared for her.    But, you will say to me, was it certain that your asserted husband would  marry you? Were there no difficulties to fear? None. Comte Guillaume was  poor, talented, and ambitious; he liked high living, and would have sold  himself to the devil for riches. He was happy in marrying me. Comte Jean  would not have ventured such a proposal to his other brother, the comte  d'Hargicourt, who had much good sense and great notions of propriety,  and who at Versailles was called the _honnete homme_; a distinction not  over flattering to his two brothers.    The same evening the whole family arrived, and was presented to me the  next day. My two future sisters-in-law frightened me at first with their  provincial manners and southern accent; but, after a few minutes,  I found that this Gascon pronunciation had many charms with it.  Mesdemoiselles du Barry were not handsome but very agreeable. One was  called Isabelle, whom they had nicknamed _Bischi_, the other's name was  Fanchon, and her name had been abbreviated to \"_Chon_.\" The latter had  much talent, and even brought to Versailles with her, an instinctive  spirit of diplomacy which would have done honor to a practised courtier.  She would have been thought simple, unsophisticated, and yet was full of  plot and cunning.    I was soon much pleased with her, and the king became equally so. He was  always very much amused at hearing her talk _patois_ (provincially), or  recite the verses of one Gondouli, a poet of Languedoc. He used to make  her jump upon his knees; and altho' she had passed the first bloom  of youth, he played with her like a child. But what most particularly  diverted the king, was calling my sister-in-law by her nickname;  \"_Petite Chon, grande Chon_,\" he was always saying, \"do this, go there,  come here.\" Louis XV did the same with his own daughters: he had amongst  them a _Loque_, a _Graille_, a _Chiffe_, and they were the ladies  Victoire, Adelaide, and Sophie, whom he thus elegantly designated. I so  soon saw the taste of the king for nicknames that I gave him one, it  was Lafrance. So far from being angry with me, he laughed to tears  every time that I called him so. I must confess, _en passant_, that  the anecdote about the coffee is true.* I will only justify myself by  saying, that if I expressed myself coarsely it was not in consequence  of my vulgar education, but because the king liked such modes of  expression.         *Louis XV had a habit of making his own coffee after       dinner.  One day the coffee boiled over the sides of the       pot, and madame du Barry cried out, \"Eh, Lafrance,       ton cafe f---- le camp.\"  (author)    Let me revert to my marriage, which was performed secretly at the parish  of Saint Laurent. I believe the king knew of it, altho' he never alluded  to it any more than myself. Thus the malice of my enemies was completely  balked in this affair. Some days afterwards comte Jean received a letter  from the attorney-general of the parliament of Toulouse, M. the marquis  de Bonrepos-Riquet. This gentleman informed my brother-in-law that he  had been applied to, to institute an inquiry at all the notaries,"]]]
