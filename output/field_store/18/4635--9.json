The Friedenskirche, near the entrance to the park of Sans Souci, has a  detached high clock-tower adjoining, and cloisters beautiful, even in  winter, with the myrtle and ivy and evergreens of the protected court  which they surround. In the inner court is a copy of Thorwaldsen's  celebrated statue of Christ (the original at Copenhagen); also,  Rauch's original \"Moses, supported by Aaron and Hur,\" and a beautiful  _Pieta_ is in the opposite colonnade. The church is in the form of the  ancient basilica, which is not favorable to much adornment. A crucifix  of _lapis lazuli_ under a canopy resting on jasper columns--a present  from the Czar Nicholas--stands on the marble altar. A beautiful angel  in Carrara marble adorns the space before the chancel, above the  burial-slabs of King Frederick William IV., founder of the church, and  his queen; and the apse is lined with a rare old Venetian mosaic. But  the chief interest of this \"Church of Peace\" will henceforth centre  around it as the burial-place of the Emperor Frederick III. In an  apartment not formerly shown to the public, his young son, Waldemar,  was laid to rest at the age of eleven years, deeply mourned by the  Crown Prince, the Crown Princess, and their family. Here in this  church, beside his sons Waldemar and Sigismund, who died in infancy,  it was the wish of the dying father to lie buried. Here the quiet  military funeral service was held; here the last look of that noble  face was taken amid the tears of those who loved him well, while the  sunlight, suddenly streaming through an upper window, illuminated as  with an electric light that face at rest, as the Court-preacher Koegel  uttered the words of solemn trust,--        \"What God doeth is well done.\"    Fitting it is that in this \"Church of Peace\" should rest all that was  mortal of the immortal Prince who could say, as he entered Paris in  the flush of victory: \"Gentlemen, I do not like war. If I should  reign, I would never make it.\"          V.    MUSEUMS.      The chief art treasures of Berlin are found in the Royal Museums, Old  and New, and in the National Gallery. There are few more  characteristic and inspiring sights in Europe than that which greets  the eye in a walk on a sunny afternoon in winter from the palace of  Kaiser Wilhelm I. through the Operahaus Platz and the Zeughaus Platz,  across the Schloss Bruecke and the Lustgarten, to the peerless building  of the Old Museum,--with the grand equipages, the brilliant uniforms,  and the busy but not overcrowded life which throng the vast spaces of  these handsome thoroughfares. The Old Museum is not so rich in  masterpieces as some other and older art galleries, but there are many  fine original works. The Friezes from the Altar of Zeus, excavated  within a few years at Pergamus, are extremely interesting, and are  exhibited with all the adjuncts which the most thorough German  scholarship can supply for their elucidation. The celebrated Raphael  tapestry, woven for Henry VIII. from the cartoons now in the South  Kensington Museum, and long the foremost ornament of the palace of  Whitehall, hangs in the great upper rotunda, which is a setting not  unworthy of its fame. Michael Angelo's \"John the Baptist as a Boy,\"  one of his early works, is quite unlike most of this master's work, in  conception and execution, and is interesting especially on this  account. The \"Altar-piece of the Mystic Lamb\" is remarkable for its  merits and because it is reputed to be the first picture ever painted  in oils. Murillo's \"Ecstasy of Saint Anthony\" is a picture of rare  sweetness and power. In one room are five of Raphael's Madonnas, but  only one of them is in his better style. \"The collection of pictures  in the Old Museum,\" wrote George Eliot in 1855, \"has three gems which  remain in the imagination,--'Titian's Daughter,' Correggio's 'Jupiter  and Io,' and his 'Head of Christ on a Handkerchief.' I was pleased,  also, to recognize among the pictures the one by Jan Steem which  Goethe describes in the 'Wahlverwandschaften' as the model of a  _tableau vivant_ presented by Lucian and her friends. It is the  daughter being reproved by her father, while the mother empties her  wine-glass.\"    The department of the Museum known as the Antiquarium has its  treasures. Here is the original silver table service, supposed to be  that of a Roman General, dug up in 1868 near the old German mediaeval  town of Hildesheim. A handsome copy of this service is among the  beginnings of Chicago's Art collections. Here are the exquisite  terra-cotta statuettes from the ancient Grecian Colony of Tanagra,  which no modern work of plastic art can imitate in grace of form and  delicacy of color,--dating three or four hundred years before the  Christian era; and in other rooms, a fabulous collection of jewels,  and numberless precious vases, illustrating especially the progress of  Ancient Grecian Art.    The New Museum, connected by a colonnade with the Old, is not, like  it, remarkable for architectural beauty; but its vast collections,  especially in marble, already need and are to have a new building.  The masterpieces of ancient sculpture gathered at Munich, Vienna,  Paris, Rome, Naples, and elsewhere, are here reproduced in casts,  making up a collection said to be, in its way, unrivalled in the  world. The collection of originals in Renaissance sculpture is also  extensive and valuable.    Referring to sculpture in Berlin, George Eliot wrote: \"We went again  and again to look at the Parthenon Sculptures, and registered a vow  that we would go to feast on the originals [in the British Museum] the  first day we could spare in London.\" At the date before mentioned, her  opinion was that \"the first work of art really worth looking at that  one sees in Berlin is the 'Horse-Tamers' in front of the [Old] palace.  It is by a sculptor [Baron Clodt, of St. Petersburg] who made horses  his especial study; and certainly, to us, they eclipsed the famous  Colossi at Monte Cavallo, casts of which are in [before] the New  Museum.\"    The Department of Coins has 200,000 specimens, many very old and rare;  and that of Northern Antiquities illustrates with great fulness the  prehistoric and Roman periods. The Cabinet of Engravings is extremely  interesting, and has some specimens of very great value; but it is  open to the general public for a few hours on Sunday only, and even  then the greater part of its collections is reserved to art students,  who have the entire monopoly of its treasures on other days of the  week. It well repays persistent effort, however, to make a few quiet  visits to this rare cabinet. Some of the finest works are hung on the  walls of the pleasant rooms.    The famous mural paintings by Kaulbach adorning the upper staircase  walls of the New Museum are widely admired, but critics differ in the  estimate of their place as works of art. The upper saloons reached by  this staircase show the cartoons of Cornelius, and foreshadow a  grandeur in German art not yet realized.    The third building in the group which holds the chief art treasures of  Berlin is the National Gallery, its pictures partaking, as such a  collection should, strongly of the German spirit as shown in modern  German art. The paintings are of various degrees of merit, many being  of value chiefly as reflecting the national life. A fine portrait of  Mommsen arrested me, on one visit; a striking picture, \"Christ healing  a Sick Child in its Mother's Arms,\" by Gabriel Max, was a continual  favorite; and many others were among those to which we went frequently  and before which we lingered long.    The crowning excellence of all the Royal Art Collections is their  singular method and completeness. The Old Museum, especially, in its  arrangement and illustration of the history of painting in all  schools, is without a peer, and it is particularly rich in the early  Italian masters. The National Gallery in London has been compared in  arrangement with the Berlin Museum, but our observation showed nowhere  else in Europe so great facility for systematic study of art as here.    Quite recently, a writer in the \"London Art Journal,\" in comparing  European art galleries, characterizes the Italian galleries, except  the Pitti, as mere storehouses of pictures, so great have been the  accessions, in late years, of altar-pieces from suppressed convents;  while, on the other hand, the Louvre, and the galleries of Munich,  Dresden, Vienna, St. Petersburg, and Madrid still retain their  original characteristics as collections made by persons of taste and  discrimination. \"The Berlin Gallery,\" says this writer, \"is neither a  storehouse nor a collection. It stands on a footing of its own. The  studious and organizing Prussian mind soon handed over the management  of all its collections to a body of specialists, trained to study the  objects in their keeping and to arrange them not so much for the  delight as for the information of a studious public. The Berlin  Gallery has been thus arranged, and its additions have been purchased  under the direction of scholars and historians rather than artists and  _dilettanti_. Historical sequence and historical completeness have  been aimed at. The collection is intended to exemplify the development  of the art of painting in mediaeval and renascence Europe. It is  impossible to enter the Museum gallery and not be struck with this  fact. The visitor finds himself turned into a student of the history  of painting, as he wanders from room to room. The ordering of the  pictures, the information contained in the catalogue,--everything  points in the same direction. So clearly has the Museum come to be  understood at Berlin as a kind of art-history branch of a university,  that a portion of the funds devoted to it is annually spent upon the  publication of a periodical universally recognized as the leading  magazine in the world devoted to the history"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],[0,"The Princess of the School (#12)"],[1," remote. Lilias longed to write to him, but  knew of no address to which it was possible to post a letter. She  worried often over his mysterious absence, and was quite angry with  Dulcie for not taking the matter more keenly to heart.    \"But Mr. Bowden and Cousin Clare think he's all right!\" protested that  easy going young damsel.    \"How do they know? I think you might show a little more interest in your  own brother, who, after all, has been treated extremely badly. It seems  to me hardly decent to circle round Carmel as you do!\"    Dulcie opened her blue eyes wide.    \"Do I circle round Carmel? Well, really, and why shouldn't I like her?  She's my cousin, and a jolly good sort too! I believe she'll give us all  a far better time at the Chase than Everard would have done. He always  wanted everything just his own way. None of us ever had an innings when  he was at home. I never could see why the eldest of a family should lord  it so over the others.\"    \"You never had any proper sense of propriety!\" retorted Lilias  indignantly. \"_I_ believe in keeping up the traditions of the Ingletons,  and the estate has always descended strictly in the male line. It's only  right it should have been left to Everard instead of to a girl, and I'll  always say so. There!\"    Dulcie shrugged her shoulders.    \"Say what you like, Sister o' Mine! The twentieth century is different  from the Middle Ages, and people don't bother so much nowadays as they  did about descent and all that. The owner of an estate hasn't to fight  for it. Oh yes, of course I'm glad I'm an Ingleton, but Carmel's an  Ingleton too, as much as we are, and if the Chase is hers we can't help  it, and we may just as well make the best of it!\"    With which piece of philosophy, Dulcie turned away, leaving Lilias to  shake her head over the decay of family feeling, and the degeneracy of  younger sisters.    It was perhaps Carmel's rendering of the Pastorale dance that suggested  to Miss Walters a scheme of entertainment for the garden fete which the  girls were to give in aid of the \"Homes for Waifs and Strays.\" She  decided that the garden of Chilcombe Hall would make an excellent  background for some classic representations, and that nothing could be  prettier than old Greek costumes. By a stroke of great good luck she  managed to engage Miss Adams, a former pupil who had been studying  classic dancing in Paris, to come for a few weeks and train the  performers. Miss Adams was a tremendous enthusiast, and arrived full of  ideas which she was burning to teach to the school. The girls were  delighted with her methods. It was quite a new phase of dancing to trip  barefooted on the lawn, holding up garlands of flowers. They liked the  exercises which she gave them for the cultivation of grace, and  practised classic attitudes on all occasions, with more or less success.    \"You go about the school so exactly like Minerva!\" complained Noreen to  Phillida, rather dismayed by the sudden change in her lively friend from  bounding spirits to a statuesque pose. \"Need you always walk as if you  were thinking of the shape of your ankles?\"    Phillida shook her head carefully, so as not to disarrange the Greek  fillet she was wearing.    \"It's been too hot lately to tear round and play tennis. I think, too,  that what Miss Adams says is quite right. English girls _are_ lacking in  grace and dignity. Just look at the way Ida and Joyce are flopping about  now. An artist would have fits to see them!\"    \"Well, of course they're not sitting for their portraits. Oh yes! I love  dancing, but I don't want to worry about being graceful all day long!\"    \"That's just the point, though,\" persisted Phillida, who was a zealous  convert. \"The dances are to make you graceful _always_. You so get into  the poetry of motion that it's quite impossible for you ever to flop  again!\"    \"Is it? Oh, Kafoozalum!\" burbled Noreen, exploding into a series of  chuckles. \"'She never flopped again!' We ought to make a parody on that  from the poem of 'The White Ship.'        \"Miss Adams to the school came down,         The classic wave rolled on:       And what was cricket's latest score         To those who danced alone?        \"From dawn they practised attitudes         Until the sun did wane;       And fast confirmed in Grecian pose,         They never flopped again!\"    \"You may mock as much as you please!\" retorted Phillida, \"but it's sheer  envy because you know you won't be chosen as a wood nymph. Play cricket  and tennis if you wish, by all means! But _I_ think when we're having a  performance we may just as well give our minds to it, and do it  properly, especially when Miss Adams is here to teach us.\"    \"Right you are! Float on, O goddess! You're getting too ethereal for the  school. I shall be glad when the entertainment's over, and we can have a  cricket match again. It's decidedly more in my line!\"    Miss Adams, with all the enthusiasm of youth and a new vocation, was  determined to make the entertainment a success. She spared no trouble  over constant rehearsals, and having weeded out those girls who could  not adapt themselves to her methods, she kept the rest well at work in  any time that was available. She determined not only to have dances, but  to give in addition a short Greek play, and selected for that purpose  the famous fifteenth idyll of Theocritus.    \"But we're not to act it in Greek, surely!\" objected Edith in alarm.    \"It's bad enough to have to learn French plays! We'd never be able to  tackle Greek!\" urged Dulcie, absolutely aghast.    \"Don't look so scared!\" laughed Miss Adams. \"I'm not going to ask you to  give it in Greek. Probably few people would understand it if you did! I  have a delightful translation here. It ought to take very well indeed  with the audience. Come and squat on the grass, and I'll read it aloud  to you first, and then I'll allot parts.\"    \"Is it _very_ stiff and educational?\" groaned Dulcie, obeying  unwillingly.    \"Wait and see! Come under the shade of the lilac bush, it's so hot to  sit in the sun.\"    The girls composed themselves into attitudes of more or less classic  elegance, and Miss Adams, book in hand, began to read.        \"IDYLL XV        \"_Gorgo._ Is Praxinoe at home?        \"_Praxinoe._ Dear Gorgo, how long it is since you have been here! She       _is_ at home. The wonder is that you have got here at last. Eunoe,       see that she has a chair. Throw a cushion on it, too.        \"_Gorgo._ It does most charmingly as it is.        \"_Praxinoe._ Do sit down.        \"_Gorgo._ Oh, what a thing spirit is! I have scarcely got to you       alive, Praxinoe! What a huge crowd! What hosts of four-in-hands!       Everywhere cavalry boots, everywhere men in uniform. And the road       is endless: yes, you really live _too_ far away!        \"_Praxinoe._ It is all the fault of that madman of mine! Here he came       to the ends of the earth, and took--a hole, not a house, and all       that we might not be neighbors. The jealous wretch, always the       same, ever for spite!        \"_Gorgo._ Don't talk of Dinon, your husband, like that, my dear girl,       before the little boy. Look how he is staring at you! Never mind,       Zopyrion, sweet child, she is not speaking about papa.        \"_Praxinoe._ Our Lady Persephone! The child takes notice!        \"_Gorgo._ Nice papa!        \"_Praxinoe._ That papa of his the other day--we call every day 'the       other day'--went to get soap and rouge at the shop, and back he       came to me with salt--the great, big endless fellow!\"    \"But, Miss Adams,\" interrupted Dulcie, \"surely this isn't an old Greek  play? It sounds absolutely and entirely modern!\"    \"As a matter of fact, it was written by Theocritus about the year 266 B.  C. It describes the visit paid by two Syracusan ladies residing in  Alexandria to the festival of Adonis. Their manners and talk then must  have been very similar to ours of to-day. Listen to the part where they  are getting ready to start.        \"_Gorgo._ It seems nearly time to go.        \"_Praxinoe._ Idlers have always holidays. Eunoe, bring the water, and       put it down in the middle of the room, lazy creature that you are!       Cats always like to sleep soft! Come, bustle, bring the       water--quicker! I want water first, and how she carries it! Give it       me all the same: don't pour out so much, you extravagant thing!       Stupid girl! Why are you wetting my dress? There, stop, I have       washed my hands, as heaven would have it! Where is the key of the       big chest? Bring it here.        \"_Gorgo._ Praxinoe, that full body becomes you wonderfully. Tell me,       how much did the stuff cost you just off the loom?        \"_Praxinoe._ Don't speak of it, Gorgo! More than eight pounds in good       silver money--and the work on it! I nearly slaved my soul out over       it.        \"_Gorgo._ Well, it is _most_ successful: all you could wish.        \"_Praxinoe._ Thanks for the pretty speech. Eunoe, bring my shawl, and       set my hat on my head, the fashionable way. No, Zopyrion, I don't       mean to take _you_! Boo! Bogies! There's a horse that bites! Cry as       much as you please, but I cannot have you lamed. Let us be moving.       Phrygia, take the child, and keep him amused, call in the dog, and       shut the street door!\"    \"It's exactly like anybody going out to-day!\" commented Carmel, as Miss  Adams came to a pause.    \"Why does it seem so modern?\" asked Dulcie.    \"Because it was written during the zenith of Greece's history, and one  great civilization always resembles another. England of to-day is far  more in touch with the times of ancient Egypt, Babylon, Greece and Rome,  than with the Middle Ages. Read Chaucer, and you find his mental outlook  is that of a child of seven. In the days of the Plantagenets grown men  and women enjoyed stories of a crude simplicity that now only appeals  to children. The human race is always progressing "]]]
