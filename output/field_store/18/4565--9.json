The places for the fingers upon the  finger board are marked by small brass points. Besides the intonations  due to stopping the strings, the players upon the ke are in the habit  of adding expression in a manner analogous to that of the _tremolo_ of  the modern violinist. With the left hand he touches the string beyond  the bridge and pulls it slightly, thus imparting to the tone a sliding  intonation upward or downward, familiar to all who have experimented  with strings. This habit the Japanese still have in playing their  ko-ko, and the results are said to be not unpleasing. The volume of  tone in the ke is very light, but the quality is sweet.    As a natural consequence of the long existence of this nation and  their commercial relations to the other parts of the world, which with  all their care they have never been able wholly to avoid, the Chinese  have many other varieties of instruments, including many trumpets; an  unexampled wealth of instruments of percussion, and a few of the  ruder types of the violin kind, which seem to have come in from India  or Thibet by the way of the Buddhist monks. The ravanastron is a  common instrument with the mendicant friars of this order. The  characteristic instrument of the Chinese, however, the one which  stands as the representative of all their higher musical culture, is  the ke.    In common with all other nations of antiquity, and with some of the  present day, the Chinese have always held strong conservative  opinions. The principle has been held among them from the earliest  times that the pattern of a good thing, whether a religion, an art or  a mechanism, having once been found satisfactory, should be made  official and never afterward changed. This principle, taken in  connection with the limited powers of their chief instrument, accounts  for the small progress they have made in music within the past 2000  years. It must be remembered, however, that our knowledge of the music  of this country is still far from perfect, the travelers and  missionaries from whom it has reached us not having been practical  musicians, nor having had sufficiently long opportunities for  mastering musical systems so different from what they had previously  known, and so contrary to all their inherited percepts of tone.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.]    The Japanese are a very musical people in their way. The chief  instrument of their culture is the ko-ko. (See Fig. 18.)    In structure it much resembles the Chinese ke. They have also many  other instruments, especially various kinds of imperfect guitars, a  few rude violins, and the usual outfit of trumpets, reed pipes and  instruments of percussion. Like all the other barbarous nations, they  have never had harmony until since they began to learn it from the  Europeans.    [Illustration]          Book Second.      THE    Apprentice Period of Modern Music.      THE DEVELOPMENT OF HARMONY, TONALITY, CANONIC IMITATION AND POLYPHONY.  THE GENERAL POPULARIZATION OF THE ART OF MUSIC IN EVERY DIRECTION.          CHAPTER V.    THE NATURE OF THE TRANSFORMATION, AND THE AGENCIES EFFECTING IT.      According to the division of the subject in the beginning of this  work, the period from the Christian era to that of Palestrina, A.D.  1600, is one of apprentice work, in which the details of art were  being mastered, but in which no music, according to our acceptation of  the term, was produced. The history of this period is somewhat  obscure, the writers who throw light on it averaging scarcely more  than one to a century, scattered about in different parts of Europe.  Nevertheless, the most important changes in the history of music took  place during this period. The monody and empyrical tonality of the  ancients gave place to polyphony and harmonized melodies resting upon  the relations of tones in key. New instruments came in, and the entire  practice of the art of music was deepened, ennobled and immeasurably  enlarged in every direction. There were four causes co-operating in  this transformation of the art, and it is not easy to say of any one  of them that this one was the chief. First of these, in the Roman  empire, or in the south of Europe more particularly, for about 800  years the Greek principles remained more or less in force. The Church  is here the foremost influence, and its part in the transformation  already noted will be considered presently. In the north of Europe the  Goths, Celts and Scandinavians built mighty empires and impressed  their enthusiastic and idealistic natures upon the whole form of  modern art. The Saracens conquered a foot-hold in the south of France  about 819, and remained there for twenty years. Their influence was  very important in the development of music, and became still more  active after the crusades, where the armies of the west came again in  contact with this peculiar civilization. Besides these three sources  measurably unprofessional and outside of music, or amateur, as we say  now, there was the work of the professional musicians strictly  so-called, who, from about 1100 in the old French school, commenced  the development of what is now known as polyphony, which culminated in  the hands of the Netherlanders, about 1580, Palestrina himself being  one of the latest products of this school. These influences reacted  upon each other, and all have entered into modern art, and have  imparted to it their most essential elements.    All modern music differs from the ancient in two important  particulars--_Harmony and Tonality_. Harmony is the use of combined  sounds. These may be either dissonant, inharmonious in relation to  each other, or harmonious, agreeable. All points of repose in a  harmonized piece of music must be consonant; or, to say it  differently, the combined sound (chord) standing at the beginning or  end of a musical phrase must be harmonious. All the elements in it  must bear consonant relations to all the others. Between the points of  repose the combined sounds may or may not be consonant. Under certain  conditions dissonances make an effect even better than consonance--better  because more appealing. The law of the introduction of dissonances is  that every dissonance must arise out of a consonance, and subside into  a consonance. When this law is observed there is hardly any  combination possible in the range of music which may not be employed  with good effect. Here already we have a progress in perception of  tones, in the ability to discriminate between those which harmonize  and those which dissonate. All consonance and dissonance are purely  relative. There is no such thing as a dissonant tone in music, by  itself considered; a tone becomes dissonant by being brought into  juxtaposition with some other tone with which it does not agree. This  part of the development of a tonal sense had its beginnings in Greece,  but only reached the point where the most elementary relations were  regarded as agreeable. The octave, the fourth and the fifth, were the  only consonances which they knew, and of these they used in the  combined sounds of their music only the octave. The third, which with  us is the most agreeable part of a pure harmony, because it adds so  many elements of agreement to the combined sound into which it enters,  was not only regarded as a dissonance by them, but actually _was_ a  dissonance as they tuned their scale.    The entire course of harmonic perception in modern music may be  roughly divided into three steps: First, the recognition of  consonance, especially of the most fruitful consonance of all--that of  the thirds, and the differentiation between consonance and dissonance.  A second step involved the recognition of dissonance as an element in  musical expression, on account of the motion it imparts to a harmonic  movement. Third, the establishment of these materials of music in the  mind in such depth and fullness that their aesthetic implications  became realized as elements of expression, so that when a composer had  a certain feeling to express, the proper combination of consonance and  dissonance immediately presented itself to his mind. The first of  these steps was taken by the minstrels of the north, somewhere between  the Christian era and the tenth century. The second was the particular  work of the old French school, the Netherlanders, and of all who  composed music between about 1100 A.D. and the epoch of Palestrina,  about 1600. The third, the spontaneous application of musical material  to the expression of feeling, had in it another element, that of  tonality, concerning which it is proper to say something at this  point.    By \"tonality\" is meant the dependence or interdependence of all the  tones in a key upon some one principal tone called the Key-tone. The  tonality of the music of the ancients was wholly artificial and  unreal. A mode and a point of repose for the melody were chosen  arbitrarily; the beginning was here made, and still more the ending  was conducted to this point of repose. Between the beginning and the  ending the same tones were employed, whether the melody proposed to  repose upon re, upon fa or do. The usual points of repose in Greek  music were mi, fa and re; never upon do, the real key tone, and rarely  upon la, the natural tonic of the minor mode.    One of the chief elements of modern musical expression, particularly  in the expression of melody, is the unconscious perception of the  \"relation of tones in key.\" With every tone sung the singer conceives  not only that tone, its predecessor and its follower, but all other  tones in the entire course of the melody; and the expression of every  tone in the series rests upon its place in rhythm, and still more upon  its \"place in key.\" Change a single tone in a melody, as, for  instance, to make fa a half step sharp, and the expression of the  entire melody is thereby changed, until such time as the hearer"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2030"],[0,"Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition (#12)"],[1,"may       perhaps have to be faced that the Hebrew parallels to       Sumerian and Babylonian traditions are here confined to       chronological structure and general contents, and do not       extend to Hebrew renderings of Babylonian names. It may be       added that such correspondence between personal names in       different languages is not very significant by itself. The       name of Zugagib of Kish, for example, is paralleled by the       title borne by one of the earliest kings of the Ist Dynasty       of Egypt, Narmer, whose carved slate palettes have been       found at Kierakonpolis; he too was known as \"the Scorpion.\"         (4) Gen. iv. 17 ff. (J).         (5) It may be noted that an account of the origin of       divination is included in his description of the descendents       of Noah by the writer of the Biblical Antiquities of Philo,       a product of the same school as the Fourth Book of Esdras       and the Apocalypse of Baruch; see James, _The Biblical       Antiquities of Philo_, p. 86.    I may add that a parallel is provided by the new Sumerian records to the  circumstances preceding the birth of the Nephilim at the beginning  of the sixth chapter of Genesis.(1) For in them also great prowess or  distinction is ascribed to the progeny of human and divine unions. We  have already noted that, according to the traditions the records embody,  the Sumerians looked back to a time when gods lived upon the earth with  men, and we have seen such deities as Tammuz and Lugalbanda figuring as  rulers of cities in the dynastic sequence. As in later periods, their  names are there preceded by the determinative for divinity. But more  significant still is the fact that we read of two Sumerian heroes, also  rulers of cities, who were divine on the father's or mother's side  but not on both. Meskingasher is entered in the list as \"son of the  Sun-god\",(2) and no divine parentage is recorded on the mother's side.  On the other hand, the human father of Gilgamesh is described as the  high priest of Kullab, and we know from other sources that his mother  was the goddess Ninsun.(3) That this is not a fanciful interpretation is  proved by a passage in the Gilgamesh Epic itself,(4) in which its  hero is described as two-thirds god and one-third man. We again find  ourselves back in the same stratum of tradition with which the Hebrew  narratives have made us so familiar.         (1) Gen. vi. 1-4 (J).         (2) The phrase recalls the familiar Egyptian royal       designation \"son of the Sun,\" and it is possible that we may       connect with this same idea the Palermo Stele's inclusion of       the mother's and omission of the father's name in its record       of the early dynastic Pharaohs. This suggestion does not       exclude the possibility of the prevalence of matrilineal       (and perhaps originally also of matrilocal and       matripotestal) conditions among the earliest inhabitants of       Egypt. Indeed the early existence of some form of mother-       right may have originated, and would certainly have       encouraged, the growth of a tradition of solar parentage for       the head of the state.         (3) Poebel, _Hist. Inscr._, p. 124 f.         (4) Tablet I, Col. ii, l. 1; and cf. Tablet IX, Col. ii. l.       16.    What light then does our new material throw upon traditional origins of  civilization? We have seen that in Egypt a new fragment of the Palermo  Stele has confirmed in a remarkable way the tradition of the predynastic  period which was incorporated in his history by Manetho. It has long  been recognized that in Babylonia the sources of Berossus must have  been refracted by the political atmosphere of that country during  the preceding nineteen hundred years. This inference our new material  supports; but when due allowance has been made for a resulting  disturbance of vision, the Sumerian origin of the remainder of his  evidence is notably confirmed. Two of his ten Antediluvian kings rejoin  their Sumerian prototypes, and we shall see that two of his three  Antediluvian cities find their place among the five of primitive  Sumerian belief. It is clear that in Babylonia, as in Egypt, the local  traditions of the dawn of history, current in the Hellenistic period,  were modelled on very early lines. Both countries were the seats of  ancient civilizations, and it is natural that each should stage its  picture of beginnings upon its own soil and embellish it with local  colouring.    It is a tribute to the historical accuracy of Hebrew tradition to  recognize that it never represented Palestine as the cradle of the human  race. It looked to the East rather than to the South for evidence of  man's earliest history and first progress in the arts of life. And it  is in the East, in the soil of Babylonia, that we may legitimately seek  material in which to verify the sources of that traditional belief.    The new parallels I have to-day attempted to trace between some of  the Hebrew traditions, preserved in Gen. iv-vi, and those of the early  Sumerians, as presented by their great Dynastic List, are essentially  general in character and do not apply to details of narrative or to  proper names. If they stood alone, we should still have to consider  whether they are such as to suggest cultural influence or independent  origin. But fortunately they do not exhaust the evidence we have lately  recovered from the site of Nippur, and we will postpone formulating our  conclusions with regard to them until the whole field has been surveyed.  From the biblical standpoint by far the most valuable of our new  documents is one that incorporates a Sumerian version of the Deluge  story. We shall see that it presents a variant and more primitive  picture of that great catastrophe than those of the Babylonian and  Hebrew versions. And what is of even greater interest, it connects the  narrative of the Flood with that of Creation, and supplies a brief but  intermediate account of the Antediluvian period. How then are we to  explain this striking literary resemblance to the structure of the  narrative in Genesis, a resemblance that is completely wanting in the  Babylonian versions? But that is a problem we must reserve for the next  lecture.          LECTURE II -- DELUGE STORIES AND THE NEW SUMERIAN VERSION    In the first lecture we saw how, both in Babylonia and Egypt, recent  discoveries had thrown light upon periods regarded as prehistoric, and  how we had lately recovered traditions concerning very early rulers both  in the Nile Valley and along the lower Euphrates. On the strength of  the latter discovery we noted the possibility that future excavation in  Babylonia would lay bare stages of primitive culture similar to those  we have already recovered in Egyptian soil. Meanwhile the documents from  Nippur had shown us what the early Sumerians themselves believed about  their own origin, and we traced in their tradition the gradual blending  of history with legend and myth. We saw that the new Dynastic List  took us back in the legendary sequence at least to the beginning of  the Post-diluvian period. Now one of the newly published literary texts  fills in the gap beyond, for it gives us a Sumerian account of the  history of the world from the Creation to the Deluge, at about which  point, as we saw, the extant portions of the Dynastic List take up the  story. I propose to devote my lecture to-day to this early version of  the Flood and to the effect of its discovery upon some current theories.    The Babylonian account of the Deluge, which was discovered by George  Smith in 1872 on tablets from the Royal Library at Nineveh, is, as you  know, embedded in a long epic of twelve Books recounting the adventures  of the Old Babylonian hero Gilgamesh. Towards the end of this composite  tale, Gilgamesh, desiring immortality, crosses the Waters of Death in  order to beg the secret from his ancestor Ut-napishtim, who in the past  had escaped the Deluge and had been granted immortality by the gods. The  Eleventh Tablet, or Book, of the epic contains the account of the  Deluge which Ut-napishtim related to his kinsman Gilgamesh. The close  correspondence of this Babylonian story with that contained in Genesis  is recognized by every one and need not detain us. You will remember  that in some passages the accounts tally even in minute details, such,  for example, as the device of sending out birds to test the abatement of  the waters. It is true that in the Babylonian version a dove, a swallow,  and a raven are sent forth in that order, instead of a raven and the  dove three times. But such slight discrepancies only emphasize the  general resemblance of the narratives.    In any comparison it is usually admitted that two accounts have been  combined in the Hebrew narrative. I should like to point out that this  assumption may be made by any one, whatever his views may be with  regard to the textual problems of the Hebrew Bible and the traditional  authorship of the Pentateuch. And for our purpose at the moment it is  immaterial whether we identify the compiler of these Hebrew narratives  with Moses himself, or with some later Jewish historian whose name has  not come down to us. Whoever he was, he has scrupulously preserved his  two texts and, even when they differ, he has given each as he found it.  Thanks to this fact, any one by a careful examination of the narrative  can disentangle the two versions for himself. He will find each gives a  consistent story. One of them appears to be simpler and more primitive  than the other, and I will refer to them as the earlier and the later  Hebrew Versions.(1) The Babylonian text in the Epic of Gilgamesh  contains several peculiarities of each of the Hebrew versions, though  the points of resemblance are more detailed in the earlier of the two.
