Then, having removed the cloths in which they had been  wrapped, and which were half-consumed from age and rottenness, they  covered them with other and more handsome palls, and bound them with linen  bands. They bore the saints, thus prepared, to their altars, and deposited  them in wooden chests, covered within and without with lead: which chests,  thus lead-covered, and strongly bound with iron, were inclosed in  stone-work that was consolidated with melted lead.\" This translation  was thus carried out by Prior Alan on the night before the formal re-entry  into the choir: the rest of the monks, who had not assisted at the  ceremony, were highly incensed by the prior's action, for they had  intended that the translation of the fathers should have been performed  with great and devout solemnity. They even went so far as to cite the  prior and the trusty monks who had assisted him before the Archbishop, and  it was only by the intervention of the latter, and other men of authority,  and \"after due apology and repentance,\" that harmony was restored in the  convent.    [Illustration: THE CHOIR BEFORE RESTORATION.]    The bones of St. Dunstan were long a cause of contention between the  churches of Canterbury and Glastonbury. The monks of Glastonbury  considered that they had a prior claim on the relics of the sainted  archbishop, and stoutly contended that his body had been conveyed to their  own sanctuary after the sack of Canterbury by the Danes; and they used to  exhibit a coffin as containing Dunstan's remains. But early in the  fourteenth century they went so far as to set up a gorgeous shrine in  which they placed, with much pomp and circumstance, the supposed relics.  Archbishop Warham, who then ruled at Canterbury, accordingly replied by  causing the shrine in our cathedral to be opened, and was able to declare  triumphantly that he had found therein the remains of a human body, in the  costume of an archbishop, with a plate of lead on his breast, inscribed  with the words \"SANCTUS DUNSTANUS.\" In the course of the subsequent  correspondence which passed between the two monasteries, the Abbot of  Glastonbury, after trying to argue that perhaps part only of the saint's  relics had been conveyed to his church, at last frankly confesses \"the  people had believed in the genuineness of their saint for so long, that he  is afraid to tell them the truth.\" This shrine of St. Dunstan stood on the  south of the high altar, and was erected after the manner of a tomb:  though the shrine itself perished at the time of the Reformation, there  still remains, on the south wall of the choir, between the monuments of  Archbishops Stratford and Sudbury, some very fine open diaper-work, in  what is known as the Decorated style, which once formed part of the  ornamentation of St. Dunstan's altar. The shrine of St. Elfege, or  Alphege, who was archbishop at the time of the sacking of Canterbury by  the Danes, and was murdered by them, has been altogether destroyed.    #The Choir Screen#, a solid structure of stone we know to be the work of  Prior de Estria, _i.e._, of Eastry in Kent, who was elected in 1285, and  died in 1331. According to the Obituary record, he \"fairly decorated the  choir of the church with most beautiful stone-work cunningly carved.\" In  his Register there is an entry which evidently refers to the same work:  \"Anno 1304-5. Reparation of the whole choir with three new doors and a new  screen (_pulpito_).\" The three doors referred to are the north and south  entrances and the western one. It has already been pointed out that the  present western screen is a later addition. Professor Willis, whose great  work on the Architectural History of Canterbury Cathedral should be  studied by all who wish to examine the details of the building more  closely than is allowed by the scope of this work, describes De Estria's  screen as follows: \"The lateral portions of this wall of enclosure are in  excellent order. In the western part of the choir, namely, between the  eastern transepts and the organ-screen, this wall is built so that its  inner face nearly ranges with the inner faces of the pillars; but eastward  of the transepts it is built between the pillars. The north doorway  remains perfect. The present south doorway, which is in a much later  style, is manifestly a subsequent insertion. This enclosure consists of a  solid wall, seven feet nine inches in height from the pavement of the  side-aisles. It has a stone-bench towards the side-aisles, and above that  a base, of the age of William of Sens; so that it is clear that the work  of De Estria belongs to the upper part only of the enclosure, which  consists of delicate and elaborately worked tracery, surmounted by an  embattled crest.... The entire work is particularly valuable on account  of its well-established date, combined with its great beauty and  singularity.\"    A portion of the choir-pavement, lying between the two transepts, is  interesting as being undoubtedly part of the original flooring of Conrad's  choir, and probably the only fragment of it that was left undisturbed  after the great fire which destroyed \"that glorious choir which had been  so magnificently completed by the care and industry of Prior Conrad.\" This  part of the pavement consists of large slabs of a peculiar \"stone, or  veined marble of a delicate brown colour. When parts of this are taken up  for repair or alteration, it is usual to find lead which has run between  the joints of the slabs and spread on each side below, and which is with  great reason supposed to be the effect of the fire of 1174, which melted  the lead of the roof, and caused it to run down between the paving stones  in this manner.\" It is said that when the choir was filled with pews in  1706, and it was necessary to remove part of the pavement, the men engaged  on the work picked up enough of this lead to make two large gluepots.    [Illustration: A MISERERE IN THE CHOIR.]    The original wooden #stalls of the choir# were described by the writer of a  book published in 1640. He relates that there were two rows on each side,  an upper and a lower, and that above the stalls on the south side stood  the archbishop's wooden chair, \"sometime richly guilt, and otherwise  richly set forth, but now nothing specious through age and late neglect.\"  Perhaps the battered and shabby condition of this part of the cathedral  furniture accounts for its having survived the Puritan period; it is at  least certain that it remained untouched until 1704, when the refurnishing  of the choir was begun by Archbishop Tenison; he himself presented a  wainscoted throne with lofty Corinthian canopy adorned with carving by  Gibbons, while the altar, the pulpit, and the stalls for the dean and  vice-dean were provided with rich fittings by Queen Mary II. The tracery  of the screen was hidden by a lining of wainscoting, which was put before  it. This arrangement lasted little more than a century. In the time of  Archbishop Howley, who held office from 1828 to 1848, the wainscoting  which concealed the screen was taken away, and Archbishop Tenison's throne  has made way for a lofty canopy of tabernacle work. Some carved work,  which has been ascribed to Gibbons, still remains before the eastern front  of the screen, between the choir and the nave.    The position of the organ has been frequently shifted. In Conrad's choir  it was placed upon the vault of the south transept; afterwards it was set  up upon a large corbel of stone, over the arch of St. Michael in the same  transept. This corbel has now been removed; subsequently it was placed  between two pillars on the north side of the choir, and, later on, it was  again transferred to a position over the west door of the choir, the usual  place for the organ in cathedral churches; finally it has been  \"ingeniously deposited out of sight in the triforium of the south aisle of  the choir; a low pedestal with its keys stands in the choir itself, so as  to place the organist close to the singers, as he ought to be, and the  communication between the keys and the organ is effected by trackers  passing under the pavement of the side aisles, and conducted up to the  triforium, through a trunk let into the south wall.\" This arrangement not  only secures the retirement from view of the organ, which, with its  tedious rows of straight and unsightly pipes, is generally more or less an  eyesore in cathedrals, but is said to have caused a great improvement in  the effect of its music. The present organ, which was built by Samuel  Green, is believed to have been used at the Handel Festival in Westminster  Abbey in 1784. It was enlarged by Hill in 1842, and entirely reconstructed  in 1886. In this connection we may mention that Archbishop Theodore first  introduced the ecclesiastical chant in Canterbury Cathedral.    The tombs in the choir are all occupied by famous archbishops and  cardinals. On the south side, hard by the site of the shrine of St.  Dunstan, is the tomb of Simon of Sudbury, who was archbishop from 1375 to  1381. He built the west gate of the city, and a great part of the town  walls; in consideration of these benefits the mayor and aldermen used at  one time to make an annual procession to his resting-place and offer  prayers for his soul. Outside Canterbury his acts were not regarded with  so much gratitude, for he was the inventor, or reviver, of the poll tax,  and was in consequence beheaded on Tower Hill by Wat Tyler and his  followers. Stanley relates that \"not many years ago, when this tomb was  accidentally opened, the body was seen within, wrapped in cere-cloth, a  leaden ball occupying the vacant place of the head.\" Sudbury is also  famous as having spoken against the \"superstitious\" pilgrimages to St.  Thomas' shrine, and his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#12)"],[1," favorite plan is to hide three or  four traps around an open place, and scatter some scraps of meat in the  middle. The traps are buried out of sight after being smoked to hide  the taint of hands and iron. Sometimes no bait is used except a little  piece of cotton or a tuft of feathers that may catch the Wolf's eye or  pique its curiosity and tempt it to circle on the fateful, treacherous  ground. A good trapper varies his methods continually so that the  Wolves cannot learn his ways. Their only safeguards are perpetual  vigilance and distrust of all smells that are known to be of man.    The wolver, with a load of the strongest steel traps, had begun his  autumn work on the 'Cottonwood.'    An old Buffalo trail crossing the river followed a little draw that  climbed the hills to the level upland. All animals use these trails,  Wolves and Foxes as well as Cattle and Deer: they are the main  thoroughfares. A cottonwood stump not far from where it plunged to the  gravelly stream was marked with Wolf signs that told the wolver of its  use. Here was an excellent place for traps, not on the trail, for  Cattle were here in numbers, but twenty yards away on a level, sandy  spot he set four traps in a twelve-foot square. Near each he scattered  two or three scraps of meat; three or four white feathers on a spear of  grass in the middle completed the setting. No human eye, few animal  noses, could have detected the hidden danger of that sandy ground, when  the sun and wind and the sand itself had dissipated the man-track taint.    The Yellow Wolf had seen and passed, and taught her giant son to pass,  such traps a thousand times before.    The Cattle came to water in the heat of the day. They strung down the  Buffalo path as once the Buffalo did. The little Vesper-birds flitted  before them, the Cowbirds rode on them, and the Prairie-dogs chattered  at them, just as they once did at the Buffalo.    Down from the gray-green mesa with its green-gray rocks, they marched  with imposing solemnity, importance, and directness of purpose. Some  frolicsome Calves, playing along-side the trail, grew sober and walked  behind their mothers as the river flat was reached. The old Cow that  headed the procession sniffed suspiciously as she passed the \"trap  set,\" but it was far away, otherwise she would have pawed and bellowed  over the scraps of bloody beef till every trap was sprung and harmless.    But she led to the river. After all had drunk their fill they lay down  on the nearest bank till late afternoon. Then their unheard dinner-gong  aroused them, and started them on the backward march to where the  richest pastures grew.    One or two small birds had picked at the scraps of meat, some  blue-bottle flies buzzed about, but the sinking sun saw the sandy mask  untouched.    A brown Marsh Hawk came skimming over the river flat as the sun began  his color play. Blackbirds dashed into thickets, and easily avoided his  clumsy pounce. It was too early for the Mice, but, as he skimmed the  ground, his keen eye caught the flutter of feathers by the trap and  turned his flight. The feathers in their uninteresting emptiness were  exposed before he was near, but now he saw the scraps of meat.  Guileless of cunning, he alighted and was devouring a second lump  when--clank--the dust was flirted high and the Marsh Hawk was held by  his toes, struggling vainly in the jaws of a powerful wolf-trap. He was  not much hurt. His ample wings winnowed from time to time, in efforts  to be free, but he was helpless, even as a Sparrow might be in a  rat-trap, and when the sun had played his fierce chromatic scale, his  swan-song sung, and died as he dies only in the blazing west, and the  shades had fallen on the melodramatic scene of the Mouse in the  elephant-trap, there was a deep, rich sound on the high flat butte,  answered by another, neither very long, neither repeated, and both  instinctive rather than necessary. One was the muster-call of an  ordinary Wolf, the other the answer of a very big male, not a pair in  this case, but mother and son--Yellow Wolf and Duskymane. They came  trotting together down the Buffalo trail. They paused at the telephone  box on the hill and again at the old cottonwood root, and were making  for the river when the Hawk in the trap fluttered his wings. The old  Wolf turned toward him,-a wounded bird on the ground surely, and she  rushed forward. Sun and sand soon burn all trail-scents; there was  nothing to warn her. She sprang on the flopping bird and a chop of her  jaws ended his troubles, but a horrid sound--the gritting of her teeth  on steel--told her of peril. She dropped the Hawk and sprang backward  from the dangerous ground, but landed in the second trap. High on her  foot its death-grip closed, and leaping with all her strength, to  escape, she set her fore foot in another of the lurking grips of steel.  Never had a trap been so baited before. Never was she so unsuspicious.  Never was catch more sure. Fear and fury filled the old Wolf's heart;  she tugged and strained, she chewed the chains, she snarled and foamed.  One trap with its buried log, she might have dragged; with two, she was  helpless. Struggle as she might, it only worked those relentless jaws  more deeply into her feet. She snapped wildly at the air; she tore the  dead Hawk into shreds; she roared the short, barking roar of a crazy  Wolf. She bit at the traps, at her cub, at herself. She tore her legs  that were held; she gnawed in frenzy at her flank, she chopped off her  tail in her madness; she splintered all her teeth on the steel, and  filled her bleeding, foaming jaws with clay and sand.    She struggled till she fell, and writhed about or lay like dead, till  strong enough to rise and grind the chains again with her teeth.    And so the night passed by.    And Duskymane? Where was he? The feeling of the time when his  foster-mother had come home poisoned, now returned; but he was even  more afraid of her. She seemed filled with fighting hate. He held away  and whined a little; he slunk off and came back when she lay still,  only to retreat again, as she sprang forward, raging at him, and then  renewed her efforts at the traps. He did not understand it, but he knew  this much, she was in terrible trouble, and the cause seemed to be the  same as that which had scared them the night they had ventured near the  Calf.    Duskymane hung about all night, fearing to go near, not knowing what to  do, and helpless as his mother.    At dawn the next day a sheepherder seeking lost Sheep discovered her  from a neighboring hill. A signal mirror called the wolver from his  camp. Duskymane saw the new danger. He was a mere Cub, though so tall;  he could not face the man, and fled at his approach.    The wolver rode up to the sorry, tattered, bleeding She-wolf in the  trap. He raised his rifle and soon the struggling stopped.    The wolver read the trail and the signs about, and remembering those he  had read before, he divined that this was the Wolf with the great  Cub--the She-wolf of Sentinel Butte.    Duskymane heard the \"crack\" as he scurried off into cover. He could  scarcely know what it meant, but he never saw his kind old  foster-mother again. Thenceforth he must face the world alone.      VII    THE YOUNG WOLF WINS A PLACE AND FAME    Instinct is no doubt a Wolf's first and best guide, but gifted parents  are a great start in life. The dusky-maned cub had had a mother of rare  excellence and he reaped the advantage of all her cleverness. He had  inherited an exquisite nose and had absolute confidence in its  admonitions. Mankind has difficulty in recognizing the power of  nostrils. A Gray-wolf can glance over the morning wind as a man does  over his newspaper, and get all the latest news. He can swing over the  ground and have the minutest information of every living creature that  has walked there within many hours. His nose even tells which way it  ran, and in a word renders a statement of every animal that recently  crossed his trail, whence it came, and whither it went.    That power had Duskymane in the highest degree; his broad, moist nose  was evidence of it to all who are judges of such things. Added to this,  his frame was of unusual power and endurance, and last, he had early  learned a deep distrust of everything strange, and, call it what we  will, shyness, wariness or suspicion, it was worth more to him than all  his cleverness. It was this as much as his physical powers that made a  success of his life. Might is right in wolf-land, and Duskymane and his  mother had been driven out of Sentinel Butte. But it was a very  delectable land and he kept drifting back to his native mountain. One  or two big Wolves there resented his coming. They drove him off several  times, yet each time he returned he was better able to face them; and  before he was eighteen months old he had defeated all rivals and  established himself again on his native ground; where he lived like a  robber baron, levying tribute on the rich lands about him and finding  safety in the rocky fastness.    Wolver Ryder often hunted in that country, and before long, he came  across a five-and-one-half-inch track, the foot-print of a giant Wolf.  Roughly reckoned, twenty to twenty-five pounds of weight or six inches  of stature is a fair allowance for each inch of a Wolf's foot; this  Wolf therefore stood thirty-three inches at the shoulder and weighed  about one hundred and forty pounds, by far the largest Wolf he had ever  met. King had lived in Goat country, and now in Goat language he  exclaimed: \"You bet, ain't that an old Billy?\" Thus by trivial chance  it was that Duskymane was known to his foe, as 'Badlands Billy.'    Ryder was familiar with the muster-call of the Wolves, the long, smooth  cry, but Billy's had a singular feature, a slurring that was always  distinctive. Ryder had heard this before, in the Cottonwood Canyon, and  when at length he got a sight"]]]
