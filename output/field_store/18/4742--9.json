The Perny silk worm is extensively cultivated by the Chinese in  Manchouria, where it feeds on the oak. Its silk is coarser than that of  the common silk worm, but is yet fine, strong and glossy. Bengal has  furnished the Tussah moth, which lives in India on the oak and a variety  of other trees. It is largely raised in French and English India,  according to Nogues, and is used in the manufacture of stuffs called  corahs.    [Illustration: 55. Chrysalis of American Silk Worm.]    [Illustration: 56. Cocoon of American Silk Worm.]    The last kind of importance is the Arrhindy silk worm, from India. It  has been naturalized in France and Algeria by M. Guerin-Meneville, who  has done so much in the application of entomology to practical life. It  is closely allied to the Cynthia or Ailanthus worm, with the same kind  of silk and a similar cocoon, and feeds on the castor oil plant.    The diseases of silk worms naturally receive much attention. Like those  afflicting mankind, they arise from bad air, resulting from too close  confinement, bad food, and other adverse causes. The most fatal and  wide-spread disease, and one which since 1854 has threatened the  extermination of silk worms in Europe, is the _pebrine_. It is due to  the presence of minute vegetable corpuscles, which attack both the worms  and the eggs. It was this disease which swept off thousands of Mr.  Trouvelot's Polyphemus worms, and put a sudden termination to his  important experiments, the germs having been implanted in eggs of the  Yama-mai moth imported from Japan by M. Guerin-Meneville, and which were  probably infected as they passed through Paris. Though the disaster  happened several years since, he tells us that it will be useless for  him to attempt the raising of silk worms in the town where his  establishment is situated, as the germs of the disease are most  difficult to eradicate.    So direful in France were the ravages of this disease that two of the  most advanced naturalists in France, Quatrefages and Pasteur, were  commissioned by the French government to investigate the disease.  Pasteur found that the infected eggs differed in appearance from the  sound ones, and could thus be sorted out by aid of the microscope and  destroyed. Thus these investigations, carried on year after year, and  seeming to the ignorant to tend to no practical end, resulted in saving  to France her silk culture. During the past year (1871) so successful  has his method proved that a French scientific journal expresses the  hope of the complete reestablishment and prosperity of this great  industry. A single person who obtained in 1871 in his nurseries 30,000  ounces of eggs, hopes the next year to obtain 100,000 ounces, from which  he expects to realize about one million dollars.    [Illustration: The Potato Caterpillar.]          CHAPTER V.    THE CLOTHES MOTH.      For over a fortnight we once enjoyed the company of the caterpillar of a  common clothes moth. It is a little pale, delicate worm (Fig. 57,  magnified), about the size of a darning needle, and rather less than  half an inch in length, with a pale horn-colored head, the ring next the  head being of the same color. It has sixteen feet, the first six of them  well developed and constantly in use to draw the slender body in and out  of its case. Its head is armed with a formidable pair of jaws, with  which, like a scythe, it mows its way through thick and thin.    But the case is the most remarkable feature in the history of this  caterpillar. Hardly has the helpless, tiny worm broken out of the egg,  previously laid in some old garment of fur or wool, or perhaps in the  haircloth of a sofa, when it begins to make a shelter by cutting the  woolly fibres or soft hairs into bits, which it places at each end in  successive layers, and, joining them together by silken threads,  constructs a cylindrical tube (Fig. 58) of thick, warm felt, lined  within with the finest silk the tiny worm can spin. The case is not  perfectly cylindrical, being flattened slightly in the middle, and  contracted a little just before each end, both of which are always kept  open. The case before us is of a stone-gray color, with a black stripe  along the middle, and with rings of the same color round each opening.  Had the caterpillar fed on blue or yellow cloth, the case would, of  course, have been of those colors. Other cases, made by larvae which had  been eating loose cotton, were quite irregular in form, and covered  loosely with bits of cotton thread, which the little tailor had not  trimmed off.    Days go by. A vigorous course of dieting on its feast of wool has given  stature to our hero. His case has grown uncomfortably small. Shall he  leave it and make another? No housewife is more prudent and saving. Out  come those scissor-jaws, and, lo! a fearful rent along each side of one  end of the case. Two wedge-shaped patches mend the breach; the  caterpillar retires for a moment and reappears at the other end; the  scissors are once more pulled out; two rents appear, to be filled up by  two more patches or gores, and our caterpillar once again breathes more  freely, laughs and grows fat upon horse hair and lambs' wool. In this  way he enlarges his case till he stops growing.    [Illustration: 59. 58. 57.    Early Stages of the Clothes Moth.]    Our caterpillar seeming to be full-grown, and apparently out of  employment, we cut the end of his case half off. Two or three days  after, he had mended it from the inside, drawing the two edges together  by silken threads, and, though he had not touched the outside, yet so  neatly were the two parts joined together that we had to search for some  time, with a lens, to find the scar.    To keep our friend busy during the cold, cheerless weather, for it was  mid-winter, we next cut a third of the case entirely off. Nothing  daunted, the little fellow bustled about, drew in a mass of the woolly  fibres, filling up the whole mouth of his den, and began to build on  afresh, and from the inside, so that the new-made portion was smaller  than the rest of the case. The creature worked very slowly, and the  addition was left in a rough, unfinished state.    We could easily spare these voracious little worms hairs enough to serve  as food, and to afford material for the construction of their paltry  cases; but that restless spirit that ever urges on all beings endowed  with life and the power of motion, never forsakes the young clothes moth  for a moment. He will not be forced to drag his heavy case over rough  hairs and furzy wool, hence with his keen jaws he cuts his way through.  Thus, the more he travels, the more mischief he does.    After taking his fill of this sort of life he changes to a chrysalid  (Fig. 59), and soon appears as one of those delicate, tiny, demure  moths that fly in such numbers from early in the spring until the  autumn.    Very many do not recognize these moths in their perfect stage, so small  are they, and vent their wrath on those great millers that fly around  lamps in warm summer evenings. It need scarcely be said that these large  millers are utterly guiltless of any attempts upon our wardrobes; they  make their attacks in a more open form on our gardens and orchards.    We will give a more careful description of the clothes moth, which was  found in its different stages June 12th in a mass of loose cotton. The  larva is white, with a tolerably plump body, which tapers slightly  towards the tail, while the head is much of the color of gum-copal. The  rings of the body are thickened above, especially on the thoracic ones,  by two transverse thickened folds. It is one-fifth of an inch long.    The body of the chrysalis, or pupa, is considerably curved, with the  head smooth and rounded. The long antennae, together with the hind legs,  which are folded along the breast, reach to the tip of the hind body, on  the upper surface of each ring of which is a short transverse row of  minute spines, which aid the chrysalis in moving towards the mouth of  its case, just before the moth appears. At first the chrysalis is  whitish, but just before the exclusion of the moth becomes the color of  varnish.    When about to cast its pupa skin, the skin splits open on the back, and  the perfect insect glides out. The act is so quickly over with, that the  observer has to look sharp to observe the different steps in the  operation.    [Illustration: 60. Clothes Moth.]    Our common clothes moth (Tinea flavifrontella, Fig. 60) is of a uniform  light-buff color, with a silky iridescent lustre, the hind wings and  abdomen being a little paler. The head is thickly tufted with hairs and  is a little tawny, and the upper side of the densely hirsute feelers  (palpi) is dusky. The wings are long and narrow, with the most beautiful  and delicate long silken fringe, which increases in length towards the  base of the wing.    They begin to fly in May, and last all through the season, fluttering  with a noiseless, stealthy flight in our apartments, and laying their  eggs in our woollens.    Successive broods of the clothes moth appear through the summer. In the  autumn they cease eating, retire within their cases, and early in spring  assume the chrysalis state.    There are several allied species which have much the same habits, except  that they do not all construct cases, but eat carpets, clothing,  articles of food, grain, etc., and objects of natural history.    Careful housewives are not much afflicted with these pests. The slovenly  and thriftless are overrun with them. Early in June woollens and furs  should be carefully dusted, shaken and beaten. Dr. T. W. Harris states  that \"powdered black pepper, strewed under the edge of carpets, is said  to repel moths. Sheets of paper sprinkled with spirits of turpentine,  camphor in coarse powder, leaves of tobacco, or shavings of Russia  leather, should be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2441"],[0,"The Burgess Animal Book for Children (#12)"],[1,"is very neat in his habits and keeps his home and himself  very clean.  During the day he leaves one of his mounds open for  a little while to let in fresh air.  But it is only for a little  while.  Then he closes it again.  He doesn't dare leave it open  very long, for fear Shadow the Weasel or a certain big Snake called  the Gopher Snake will find it and come in after him.  Digger the  Badger is the only one of his enemies who can dig fast enough to  dig him out, but at night, when he likes to come out for a little  air or to cut grain and grass, he must always watch for Hooty the  Owl.  Old Man Coyote and members of the Hawk family are always  looking for him by day, so you see he has plenty of enemies, like  the rest of you.    \"He got the name Gopher because that comes from a word meaning  honeycomb, and Grubby's tunnels go in every direction until the  ground is like honeycomb.  He isn't a bit social and has rather  a mean disposition.  He is always ready to fight.  On the plains  he has done a great deal to make the soil fine and rich, as I have  already told you, but on hillsides he does a great deal of harm.  The water runs down his tunnels and washes away the soil.  Because  of this and the damage he does to crops, man is his greatest  enemy.  But man has furnished him with new and splendid foods easy  to get, and so Grubby's family increases faster than it used to,  in spite of traps and poison.  Hello!  See who's here!  It is  about time.\"    There was a shuffling and rattling and grunting, and Prickly  Porky climbed up on an old stump, looking very peevish and much  out of sorts.  He had come to school much against his will.        CHAPTER XI  A Fellow With a Thousand Spears    \"There,\" said Old Mother Nature, pointing to Prickly Porky the  Porcupine, \"is next to the largest member of your order, which is?\"    \"Order of Rodents,\" piped up Striped Chipmunk.    \"He is not only next to the largest, but is the stupidest,\" continued  Old Mother Nature.  \"At least that is what people say of him, though  I suspect he isn't as stupid as he sometimes seems.  Anyway, he  manages to keep well fed and escape his enemies, which is more than  can be said for some others who are supposed to have quick wits.\"    \"Escaping his enemies is no credit to him.  They are only too glad  to keep out of his way; he doesn't have to fear anybody,\" said  Chatterer the Red Squirrel to his cousin, Happy Jack.    His remark didn't escape the keen ears of Old Mother Nature.  \"Are  you sure about that?\" she demanded.  \"Now there's Pekan the Fisher-\"    She was interrupted by a great rattling on the old stump.  Everybody  turned to look.  There was Prickly Porky backing down as fast as he  could, which wasn't fast at all, and rattling his thousand little  spears as he did so.  It was really very funny.  Everybody had to  laugh, even Old Mother Nature.  You see, it was plain that he was  in a great hurry, yet every movement was slow and clumsy.    \"Well, Prickly Porky, what does this mean?  Where are you going?\"  demanded Old Mother Nature.    Prickly Porky turned his dull-looking eyes towards her, and in them  was a troubled, worried look.  \"Where's Pekan the Fisher?\" he asked,  and his voice shook a little with something very much like fear.    Old Mother Nature understood instantly.  When she had said, \"Now  there's Pekan the Fisher,\" Prickly Porky had waited to hear no  more.  He had instantly thought that she meant that Pekan was  right there somewhere.  \"It's all right, Prickly Porky,\" said she.  \"Pekan isn't anywhere around here, so climb back on that stump and  don't worry.  Had you waited for me to finish, you would have saved  yourself a fright.  Chatterer had just said that you didn't have  to fear anybody and I was starting to explain that he was wrong,  that despite your thousand little spears you have reason to fear  Pekan the Fisher.\"    Prickly Porky shivered and this made the thousand little spears in  his coat rattle.  It was such a surprising thing to see Prickly Porky  actually afraid that the other little folks almost doubted their own  eyes.  \"Are you quite sure that Pekan isn't anywhere around?\" asked  Prickly Porky, and his voice still shook.    \"Quite sure,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"If he were I wouldn't  allow him to hurt you.  You ought to know that.  Now sit up so  that every one can get a good look at you.\"    Prickly Porky sat up, and the others gathered around the foot of  the stump to look at him.  \"He certainly is no beauty,\" murmured  Happy Jack Squirrel.    Happy Jack was quite right.  He was anything but handsome.  The  truth is he was the homeliest, clumsiest-looking fellow in all  the Green Forest.  He was a little bigger than Bobby Coon and his  body was thick and heavy-looking.  His back humped up like an  arch.  His head was rather small for the size of his body, short  and rather round.  His neck was even shorter.  His eyes were small  and very dull.  It was plain that he couldn't see far, or clearly  unless what he was looking at was close at hand.  His ears were  small and nearly hidden in hair.  His front teeth, the gnawing  teeth which showed him to be a Rodent, were very large and bright  orange.  His legs were short and stout.  He had four toes on each  front foot and five on each hind foot, and these were armed with  quite long, stout claws.    But the queerest thing and the most interesting thing about Prickly  Porky was his coat.  Not one among the other little people of the  Green Forest has a coat anything like his.  Most of them have a  soft, short under fur protected and more or less hidden by longer,  coarser hair.  Prickly Porky had the long coarse hair and on his  back it was very long and coarse, brownish-black in color up to  the tips, which were white.  Under this long hair was some soft  woolly fur, but what that long hair hid chiefly was an array of  wicked-looking little spears called quills.  They were white to the  tips, which were dark and very, very sharply pointed.  All down the  sides were tiny barbs, so small as hardly to be seen, but there  just the same.  On his head the quills were about an inch long,  but on his back they were four inches long, becoming shorter  towards the tail.  The latter was rather short, stout, and covered  with short quills.    As he sat there on that old stump some of Prickly Porky's little  spears could be seen peeping out from the long hair on his back,  but they didn't look particularly dangerous.  Peter Rabbit  suddenly made a discovery.  \"Why!\" he exclaimed.  \"He hasn't any  little spears on the under side of him!\"    \"I wondered who would be the first to notice that,\" said Old Mother  Nature.  \"No, Prickly Porky hasn't any little spears underneath,  and Pekan the Fisher has found that out.  He knows that if he can  turn Prickly Porky on his back he can kill him without much danger  from those little spears, and he has learned how to do that very  thing.  That is why Prickly Porky is afraid of him.  Now, Prickly  Porky, climb down off that stump and show these little folks what  you do when an enemy comes near.\"    Grumbling and growling, Prickly Porky climbed down to the ground.  Then he tucked his head down between his front paws and suddenly  the thousand little spears appeared all over him, pointing in  every direction until he looked like a giant chestnut burr.  Then  he began to thrash his tail from side to side.    \"What is he doing that for?\" asked Johnny Chuck, looking  rather puzzled.    \"Go near enough to be hit by it, and you'll understand,\" said Old  Mother Nature dryly.  \"That is his one weapon.  Whoever is hit by  that tail will find himself full of those little spears and will  take care never to go near Prickly Porky again.  Once those little  spears have entered the skin, they keep working in deeper and  deeper, and more than one of his enemies has been killed by them.  On account of those tiny barbs they are hard to pull out, and  pulling them out hurts dreadfully.  Just try one and see.\"    But no one was anxious to try, so Old Mother Nature paused only a  moment.  \"You will notice that he moves that tail quickly,\" she  continued.  \"It is the only thing about him which is quick.  When  he has a chance, in time of danger, he likes to get his head  under a log or rock, instead of putting it between his paws as he  is doing now.  Then he plants his feet firmly and waits for a  chance to use that tail.\"    \"Is it true that he can throw those little spears at folks?\"  asked Peter.    Old Mother Nature shook her head.  \"There isn't a word of truth in  it,\" she declared.  \"That story probably was started by some one  who was hit by his tail, and it was done so quickly that the victim  didn't see the tail move and so thought the little spears were  thrown at him.\"    \"How does he make all those little spears stand up that way?\"  asked Jumper the Hare.    \"He has a special set of muscles for just that purpose,\" explained  Old Mother Nature.    \"When those quills stick into some one they must pull out of  Prickly Porky's own skin; I should think that would hurt him,\"  spoke up Striped Chipmunk.    \"Not at all,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"They are very loosely  fastened in his skin and come out at the least little pull.  New  Ones grow to take the place of those he loses.  Notice that he  puts his whole foot flat on the ground just as Buster Bear and  Bobby Coon do, and just as those two-legged creatures called men  do.  Very few animals do this, and those that do are said to be  plantigrade.  Now, Prickly Porky, tell us what you eat and where  you make your home, and that will end today's lesson.\"    \"I eat bark, twigs and leaves mostly,\" grunted Prickly Porky  ungraciously.  \"I like hemlock best of all, but also eat poplar,  pine and other trees for a change.  Sometimes I stay in a tree for  days until I have stripped it of all its bark and leaves.  I don't  see any sense in moving about any more than is"]]]
