[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22409"],[0,"A Woman who went to Alaska (#12)"],[1,"   The night of June twelfth, about eleven o'clock, just after having  retired, but being still awake, I heard a sudden and piercing scream.  The English madam with me, being still dressed, rushed upon deck to find  out the cause of the disturbance. Rushing towards her with pale and  frightened face was her daughter who had been lunching in the dining  salon. An iceberg of immense proportions and greater height than usual  had struck the ship with a crash, coming up suddenly and most  unexpectedly from underneath the fog bank so that the watchful pilot was  taken unawares. The English girl said the berg, when alongside the ship,  reached the height of the upper deck and appeared like a huge mountain  of ice from her place at the window. It was consternation at the sight  of what was apparently sure and speedy destruction which had caused the  woman's scream.    Investigation was immediately made of the ship's plates, which, though  considerably dented by the ice, were still, thanks to a kind Providence,  intact; and again I settled myself for the night and slept.    Next day men were restless. They wanted to be on their way to Nome. It  was not for this that they had paid a large price for their tickets and  assurances that they would arrive early at Nome; and they agreed that  there was no more danger in steaming ahead than in lying anchored with  the ice bumping into us and liable to break through the ship's sides at  any moment.    \"Will you sign a petition to the captain asking that he proceed on his  way to Nome without further delay?\" asked a friend of me while the \"St.  Paul\" was anchored and the ice still drifting around us.    \"They are circulating such a petition, and have a good many signers, or  those who are willing to sign it, and I wanted to know how you feel  about it,\" said my friend.    \"What is the matter with the captain? Did they not announce their  confidence in him by coming aboard this steamer, and has he done  anything to cause them to lose faith in his ability to pilot them safely  through? Has he not brought them on their voyage thus far without  accident?\" I asked.    \"Oh, yes, certainly.\"    \"Then I, for one, shall abide by the captain's judgment, and remain  anchored here so long as he sees fit to order it. You can say to the  others that I will sign no petition,\" said I.    Whether my decision and firmness in the matter had any weight with  others, I know not; but the petition was dropped, and the captain  probably never knew that such a thing had been proposed.    The morning of June thirteenth the sun shone out clear and bright. Great  fields of ice surrounded us, and many other ships were also hemmed in at  different places. The \"Elder\" lay contentedly beside us. It was not so  cold when the fog had lifted, and the clearer atmosphere made it  possible to see for many miles over the berg-strewn waters. Men were  walking restlessly about on deck trying to keep their impatience down  and their hands and feet warm. They feared that other ships with  hundreds of passengers would land at Nome before they could, and that  would mean loss, perhaps in many ways, to them. We were less than two  hundred miles from Nome and could easily make the run in a day if  allowed a free sea.    By this time the face of the steward began to show anxiety and he  watched the horizon with interest. Serving, as he did, nearly fifteen  hundred meals daily, he feared a shortage of supplies if the ship was  delayed many days longer. Ten sacks of flour, and fifteen hundred pounds  of meat were used daily, and other things in proportion. For breakfast  one day ninety dozen eggs were fed to the people.    High overhead the stars and stripes were now hoisted to announce our joy  at being delivered from so many dangers, and at leading the way for  others to follow. No one could pass us, and we would, after all, be  among the first, if not the very first, to reach Nome.    The captain looked jaded and worn, but happy and relieved, being able  now to get some of the much-needed rest so long denied him when in the  ice fields. When congratulated by the passengers upon his skill, for by  this time they had entirely forgotten their discontent of the previous  days and were willing to give him and his crew due praise, he smiled and  thanked them kindly, then went away to rest.    Early next morning anchor was dropped at Nome. At last we had reached  our destination. We had traveled thirty-one hundred and thirty-nine  miles in nineteen days and could have done it in much shorter time had  it not been for the ice. Several small ships lay at anchor before us,  but we were immediately followed by many large steamers bringing  thousands of people to Nome. The weather was splendid. Many of the  passengers were in such haste to reach shore than they left without  breakfast; but we waited until ten in the morning before boarding the  \"lighter,\" and I donned a dress suitable to the occasion. This was cut  short, and was worn with high, stout boots, leggings, warm coat, cap and  veil, with extra wraps for the trip of two miles to shore.    Certainly we now presented a very unique spectacle. We were really a  sort of Noah's Ark collection, with the roof of the Ark omitted. Women  in abbreviated skirts, long rubber boots, golf capes, caps and sweaters;  men covered in long \"raglans,\" fur coats, \"jumpers,\" or whatever  happened to be at hand; and all rushing pell-mell in the direction of  the lighter, by means of which they hoped to land on the golden beach of  Nome. Baggage there was in stacks. There were boxes, grips, trunks, army  sacks; everything but babies, bird cages and band wagons. Passage for an  automobile had been engaged in San Francisco, but at the last moment the  lady accompanying the big machine was suddenly indisposed and obliged to  allow the \"St. Paul\" to sail without her.    The sea was now quite rough. The lighter was brought close alongside.  The rope ladder was thrown over the side of the ship with its lower end  dangling upon the lighter's deck, and we were told we could now go  ashore.    This was the moment for which we had longed, and all were ready, like  Cassibianca, minus the fire and peanuts. The fat widow of the company  tied her bonnet more tightly under her chin, clutched at her pudgy  skirts, and grasping the deck rail, placed her foot upon the rope ladder  to descend.    \"Don't look down!\" shouted some one to her, fearing she might grow dizzy  if she did so.    \"Don't hurry; take your time!\" called out another.    \"Keep cool and you're all right!\" instructed another, at which time the  widow, with fluttering veil, pale face and eyes starting from their  sockets with fright reached the lowest round of the ladder and stepped  to the deck of the lighter. Her bonnet was awry, the belt of her dress  had become unfastened, while her skirts were twisted around her in some  unaccountable way and her teeth chattering; but she only drew a long  sigh as she sank in a limp heap upon an army sack marked with big black  letters, and said gaspingly: \"This is terrible!\" Others followed her  example. Some protested they would rather stay on the ship or go back to  San Francisco than scramble down that \"beastly rope ladder\" swaying as  it did back and forth with every motion of the ship to which it was  attached. For myself, I had never posed as especially courageous, and  wondered how I should get on. But I said nothing. From watching the  others I had learned that to \"make haste slowly\" was a good method to  follow in the present case, as a misstep without a firm hand grip upon  the sides of the ladder while descending would be likely to send one  without warning into the yard wide gulf of boiling waters between the  ship's side and the lighter, as the barge was literally dancing  attendance upon the vessel in the rough sea.    Finally everything was ready. All passengers had left the ship. The  lighter was crowded to the last inch of space; baggage and freight along  the sides, and passengers in the middle, sitting wherever they could  find a box or bag upon which to sit. A tug boat made fast to the  lighter--we said good-bye to the \"St. Paul\" and moved away.    \"We are bidding good-bye to all comforts now!\" exclaimed an old Nomeite  dubiously, \"for we won't find any on shore; leastwise not unless it has  improved more in the last ten months than I think it has. It was a tough  place enough last summer, and that's no josh either!\" looking around him  at the ladies of the party and evidently wondering what they would think  of the celebrated mining town.    Many by this time looked sober, but it was not a hard camp that they  feared. They had expected to find a typical camp with all the attendant  evils usual in such a place, and now they were almost there. In fact  they looked out over the heaps of baggage towards shore at the long fine  of white tents, buildings of every description from a board shack to a  hotel or large store, and it seemed good in their eyes--very good. For  some unseen reason, as the barge, following as it did at the end of the  long line from the tug, rode first upon the top of a big breaker and  then below in the trough, there was a decided longing on the part of  some to be on land. It did not much matter where it was--Europe, Asia,  Africa or \"any old place\"; but as for this \"confounded, zig-zaggin',  heavin' old hulk which is tryin' its best to take us to Honolulu  sideways--I want no more of it!\" growled one man.    \"Give me Nome or I die!\" gasped another.    \"No more big water in mine for two years, and mebbe by that time they  will have air ships to fly in,\" muttered a little man as he lay on his  back among a pile of bags and gulped at something in his throat he was  trying to keep down.    So the barge bobbed up and down among the breakers, riding to the crest  of a wave with a gliding, graceful motion, only to reach out beyond it,  and then, as the waters underneath receded,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22420"],[0,"The Book of Nature Myths (#12)"],[1,"made in the rock, and through the hole  I saw--oh, wife, it was indeed a wonderful sight!\"    \"But what was it, my hunter?\"    \"There was a great hall, all shining and sparkling with precious  stones. There were diamonds and pearls and emeralds, more than we could  put into our little house, and among all the beautiful colors sat a  woman who was fairer than they. Her maidens were around her, and the  hall was as bright with their beauty as it was with the stones. One was  playing on a harp, one was singing, and others were dancing as lightly  and merrily as a sunbeam on a blossom. The woman was even more beautiful  than the maidens, and, wife, as soon as I saw her I thought that she was  no mortal woman.\"    \"Did you not fall on your knees and ask her to be good to us?\"    \"Yes, wife, and straightway she said: 'Rise, my friend. I have a gift  for you. Choose what you will to carry to your wife as a gift from  Holda.'\"    \"Did you choose pearls or diamonds?\"    \"I looked about the place, and it was all so sparkling that I closed my  eyes. 'Choose your gift,' she said. I looked into her face, and then I  knew that it was indeed the goddess Holda, queen of the sky. When I  looked at her, I could not think of precious stones, for her eyes were  more sparkling than diamonds, and I said: 'O goddess Holda, there is no  gift in all your magic hall that I would so gladly bear away to my home  as the little blue flower in your lily-white hand.'\"    \"Well!\" cried the wife, \"and when you might have had half the pearls and  emeralds in the place, you chose a little faded blue flower! I did think  you were a wiser man.\"    \"The goddess said I had chosen well,\" said the hunter. \"She gave me the  flower and the seed of it, and she said, 'When the springtime comes,  plant the seed, and in the summer I myself will come and teach you what  to do with the plant.'\"    In the spring the little seeds were put into the ground. Soon the green  leaves came up; then many little blue flowers, as blue as the sky,  lifted up their heads in the warm sunshine of summer. No one on the  earth knew how to spin or to weave, but on the brightest, sunniest day  of the summer, the goddess Holda came down from the mountain to the  little house.    [Illustration: \"SHE GAVE ME THE FLOWER\"]    \"Can you spin flax?\" she asked of the wife.    \"Indeed, no,\" said the wife.    \"Can you weave linen?\"    \"Indeed, no.\"    \"Then I will teach you how to spin and to weave,\" said the good goddess.  \"The little blue flower is the flax. It is my own flower, and I love the  sight of it.\"    So the goddess sat in the home of the hunter and his wife and taught  them how to spin flax and weave linen. When the wife saw the piece of  linen on the grass, growing whiter and whiter the longer the sun shone  upon it, she said to her husband, \"Indeed, my hunter, the linen is  fairer than the pearls, and I should rather have the beautiful white  thing that is on the grass in the sunshine than all the diamonds in the  hall of the goddess.\"          WHY THE JUNIPER HAS BERRIES.      Three cranberries once lived together in a meadow. They were sisters,  but they did not look alike, for one was white, and one was red, and one  was green. Winter came, and the wind blew cold. \"I wish we lived nearer  the wigwam,\" said the white cranberry timidly. \"I am afraid that Hoots,  the bear, will come. What should we do?\"    \"The women in the wigwam are afraid as well as we,\" the red cranberry  said. \"I heard them say they wished the men would come back from the  hunt.\"    \"We might hide in the woods,\" the green cranberry whispered.    \"But the bear will come down the path through the woods,\" replied the  white cranberry.    \"I think our own meadow is the best place,\" the red cranberry said. \"I  shall not go away from the meadow. I shall hide here in the moss.\"    \"I am so white,\" the white cranberry wailed, \"that I know Hoots would  see me. I shall hide in the hominy. That is as white as I.\"    \"I cannot hide in the hominy,\" said the green cranberry, \"but I have a  good friend in the woods. I am going to ask the juniper-tree to hide me.  Will you not go with me?\" But the red cranberry thought it best to stay  in the moss, and the white cranberry thought it best to hide in the  hominy, so the green cranberry had to go alone to the friendly  juniper-tree.    By and by a growling was heard, and soon Hoots himself came in sight. He  walked over and over the red cranberry that lay hidden in the moss. Then  he went to the wigwam. There stood the hominy, and in it was the white  cranberry, trembling so she could not keep still.    \"Ugh, ugh, what good hominy!\" said Hoots, and in the twinkling of an eye  he had eaten it up, white cranberry and all.    Now the red cranberry was dead, and the white cranberry was dead, but  the little green cranberry that went to the juniper-tree had hidden  away in the thick branches, and Hoots did not find her. She was so happy  with the kind-hearted tree that she never left it, and that is the  reason why the juniper-tree has berries.          WHY THE SEA IS SALT.      Frothi, king of the Northland, owned some magic millstones. Other  millstones grind corn, but these would grind out whatever the owner  wished, if he knew how to move them. Frothi tried and tried, but they  would not stir.    \"Oh, if I could only move the millstones,\" he cried, \"I would grind out  so many good things for my people. They should all be happy and rich.\"    One day King Frothi was told that two strange women were begging at the  gate to see him.    \"Let them come in,\" he said, and the were brought before him.    \"We have come from a land that is far away,\" they said.    \"What can I do for you?\" asked the king.    \"We have come to do something for you,\" answered the women.    \"There is only one thing that I wish for,\" said the king, \"and that is  to make the magic millstones grind, but you cannot do that.\"    \"Why not?\" asked the women. \"That is just what we have come to do. That  is why we stood at your gate and begged to speak to you.\"    Then the king was a happy man indeed. \"Bring in the millstones,\" he  called. \"Quick, quick! Do not wait.\" The millstones were brought in, and  the women asked, \"What shall we grind for you?\"    \"Grind gold and happiness and rest for my people,\" cried the king  gladly.    The women touched the magic millstones, and how they did grind! \"Gold  and happiness and rest for the people,\" said the women to one another.  \"Those are good wishes.\"    The gold was so bright and yellow that King Frothi could not bear to let  it go out of his sight. \"Grind more,\" he said to the women. \"Grind  faster. Why did you come to my gate if you did not wish to grind?\"    \"We are so weary,\" said the women. \"Will you not let us rest?\"    \"You may rest for as long a time as it needs to say 'Frothi,'\" cried the  king, \"and no longer. Now you have rested. Grind away. No one should be  weary who is grinding out yellow gold.\"    \"He is a wicked king,\" said the women. \"We will grind for him no more.  Mill, grind out hundreds and hundreds of strong warriors to fight Frothi  and punish him for his cruel words.\"    The millstones ground faster and faster. Hundreds of warriors sprang  out, and they killed Frothi and all his men.    \"Now I shall be king,\" cried the strongest of the warriors. He put the  two women and the magic millstones on a ship to go to a far-away land.  \"Grind, grind,\" he called to the women.    \"But we are so weary. Please let us rest,\" they begged.    \"Rest? No. Grind on, grind on. Grind salt, if you can grind nothing  else.\"    Night came and the weary women were still grinding. \"Will you not let us  rest?\" they asked.    \"No,\" cried the cruel warrior. \"Keep grinding, even if the ship goes to  the bottom of the sea.\" The women ground, and it was not long before the  ship really did go to the bottom, and carried the cruel warrior with it.  There at the bottom of the sea are the two millstones still grinding  salt, for there is no one to say that they must grind no longer. That is  why the sea is salt.          THE STORY OF THE FIRST WHITEFISH.      One day a crane was sitting on a rock far out in the water, when he  heard a voice say, \"Grandfather Crane, Grandfather Crane, please come  and carry us across the lake.\" It was the voice of a child, and when the  crane had come to the shore, he saw two little boys holding each other's  hands and crying bitterly.    \"Why do you cry?\" asked the crane, \"and why do you wish to go across the  lake, away from your home and friends?\"    \"We have no friends,\" said the little boys, crying more bitterly than  ever. \"We have no father and no mother, and a cruel witch troubles us.  She tries all the time to do us harm, and we are going to run away where  she can never find us.\"    \"I will carry you over the lake,\" said the crane. \"Hold on well, but do  not touch the back of my head, for if you do, you will fall into the  water and go to the bottom of the lake. Will you obey me?\"    \"Yes, indeed, we will obey,\" they said. \"We will not touch your head.  But please come quickly and go as fast as you can. We surely heard the  voice of the witch in the woods.\"    It really was the witch, and she was saying over and over to herself, \"I  will catch them, and I will punish them so that they will never run away  from me again. They will obey me after I have caught them.\"    The crane bore the two little boys gently to the other shore, and when  he came back, there stood the witch.    \"Dear, gentle crane,\" she said, \"you are so good to every one. Will you  carry me over the lake? My two dear children are lost in the woods, and  I have cried bitterly for them all day long.\"    [Illustration]    The spirit of the lake had told the crane to carry across the lake  every one that asked to be taken over; so he said, \"Yes, I will carry  you across. Hold on well, but do not touch the back of my head, for if  you do, you will fall into the water and "]]]
