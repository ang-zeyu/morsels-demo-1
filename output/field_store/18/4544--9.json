So it was evident that the pair had been in  league together to insure Sooka his revenge. What share Jackson had had  in the murder of his enemy I did not care to think of, but feared the  worst.    For myself, I had to remain on the Point for many months, until the  factory was finally closed--for no purchaser was ever found for it;  and doubtless, by this time, the buildings are in ruins, and long grass  hides the graves of those who sleep upon King Bemba's Point.          GHAMBA, By William Charles Scully         The darksome cave they enter, where they find       That cursed man, low sitting on the ground,       Musing full sadly in his sullen mind.       _The Faerie Queene._      When Corporal Francis Dollond and Trooper James Franks, of the Natal  Mounted Police, overstayed their ten days' leave of absence from the  camp on the Upper Tugela, in the early part of 1883, everybody was much  surprised; they being two of the best conducted and most methodical men  in the force. But the weeks and then the months went by without anything  whatever being heard of them, so they were officially recorded as  deserters. Nevertheless none of their comrades really believed that  these men had deserted; each one felt there was something mysterious  about the circumstances of their disappearance. They had applied for  leave for the alleged purpose of visiting Pietermaritzburg. They started  on foot, stating their intention of walking to Estcourt, hiring horses  from natives there, and proceeding on horseback. They had evidently  never reached Estcourt, as nothing could be heard of them at that  village. They were both young men--colonists by birth. Dollond had an  especially youthful appearance. Franks was older. He had joined the  force later in life. He and Dollond, who had only very recently before  his disappearance been promoted, were chums.    Some months later in the same year, when Troopers George Langley and  Hiram Whitson also applied for ten days' leave of absence,--likewise to  proceed to Pietermaritzburg,--the leave was granted; but the officer in  charge of the detachment laughingly remarked that he hoped they were not  going to follow Dollond and Franks.    Now, neither Langley nor Whitson had the remotest idea of visiting  Pietermaritzburg. It is necessary, of course, for the reader to know  where they did intend going to, and how the intention arose; but before  doing this we must deal with some antecedent circumstances.    Langley was most certainly the most boyish-looking man in the force. He  had a perfectly smooth face, ruddy complexion, and fair hair. He was of  middle height, and was rather inclined to stoutness. He was so fond of  talking that his comrades nicknamed him \"Magpie.\" A colonist by birth,  he could speak the Kaffir language like a native.    Whitson was a sallow-faced, spare-built man of short stature, with  dark-brown beard and hair, and piercing black eyes. His age was about  forty. He had a wiry and terrier-like appearance. A \"down-East\" Yankee,  he had spent some years in Mexico, and then drifted to South Africa  during the war period, which, it will be remembered, lasted from 1877 to  1882. He had served in the Zulu war as a non-commissioned officer in one  of the irregular cavalry corps, with some credit. The fact of his being  a man of extremely few words was enough to account for the friendship  which existed between him and the garrulous Langley. Whitson was known  to be a dead shot with the revolver.    This is how they came to apply for leave: One day Langley was strolling  about just outside the lines, looking for somebody to talk to, when he  noticed an apparently very old native man sitting on an ant-heap and  regarding him somewhat intently. This old native had been several times  seen in the vicinity of the camp, but he never seemed to speak to any  one, and he looked so harmless that the police did not even trouble to  ask him for the written pass which all natives are obliged by law to  carry when they move about the country. The old man saluted Langley  and asked in his own language for a pipeful of tobacco. Langley always  carried some loose leaves broken up in his pocket, so he at once pulled  some of these out and half filled the claw-like hand outstretched to  receive them. The old native was voluble in his thanks. There was a  large ant-heap close to the one on which he had been sitting, and on  which he reseated himself while filling his pipe. Against this Langley  leaned and took a good look at his companion. The man had a most  extraordinary face. His lower jaw and cheek-bones were largely  developed, but Langley hardly noticed this, so struck was he with  the strange formation of the upper jaw. That portion of the superior  maxillary bone which lies between the sockets of the eye-teeth  protruded, with the sockets, to a remarkable degree, and instead of  being curved appeared to be quite straight. The incisor teeth were very  large and white, but it was the development of the eye-teeth that was  most startling. These, besides being very massive, were produced below  the level of the incisors to a depth of nearly a quarter of an inch.  They distinctly suggested to Langley the tusks of a baboon.    As is not very unusual with natives, the man was perfectly bald. His  back was bent, and his limbs were somewhat shrunken, but he did not  appear in the least degree decrepit. His eyelids were very red, and his  eyes, though dim, had a deep and intent look. Ugly as was the man--or  perhaps by virtue of his ugliness--he exercised a strange fascination  over Langley.    The old man, whose name turned out to be Ghamba, proved himself a talker  after Langley's own heart. They discussed all sorts of things. Ghamba  startled his hearer by his breadth of experience and his shrewdness. He  said he was a \"Hlubi\" Kaffir from Qumbu, in the territory of Griqualand  East, but that he had for some time past been living in Basutoland,  which is situated just behind the frowning wall of the Drakensberg, to  the southwest of where they were speaking, and not twenty miles distant.    They talked until it was time for Langley to return to camp. He was so  pleased at the entertainment afforded by Ghamba that all the tobacco  he had with him found its way into the claw-like hand of that  strange-looking man of many experiences and quaint ideas. So Langley  asked him to come to the ant-heap again on the following day, and have  another talk at the same hour. This Ghamba, with a wide and prolonged  exposure of his teeth, readily agreed to do.    Langley was extremely voluble to Whitson that night over his new  acquaintance. Whitson listened with his usual impassiveness, and then  asked Langley how it was that \"an old loafing nigger,\" as he expressed  it, had impressed him so remarkably. Langley replied that he did not  quite know, but he thought the effect was largely due to the man's  teeth. But all the same he was \"a very entertaining old buffer.\"    Next afternoon Langley was so impatient to resume conversation with his  new friend that he repaired to the ant-heap quite half an hour before  the appointed time. He had not, however, long to wait, as Ghamba soon  appeared, emerging from a donga a couple of hundred yards away.    Langley was more impressed than ever. Ghamba told him all about the  Basutos, among whom he had lived; about the old days in Natal, before  even the Dutch occupation, when Tshaka's impis wiped whole tribes out of  existence; of the recent wars in Zululand and the Cape Colony, and as  to the probability of future disturbances. Charmed as was Langley by the  old man's conversation, he felt that on this occasion there was a little  too much of it; that Ghamba was not nearly so good a listener as he had  been on the previous day; so when the latter at length put a question  to him, thus affording an opportunity for the exercise of his own pentup  loquacity, Langley felt elated, more especially as several inquiries  were grouped together in the one asking. Ghamba asked whether anything  had been heard of Umhlonhlo; whether the capture of that fugitive rebel  was considered likely, and whether it was true that a reward of five  hundred pounds had been offered by the government for his capture, dead  or alive.    Umhlonhlo, it will be remembered, was the Pondomise chief who rebelled  in 1880, treacherously murdered Mr. Hope, the magistrate of Qumbu, and  his two companions, and who has since been an outlaw with a price on his  head.    Langley replied to the effect that it was quite true such a reward had  been offered as to Umhlonhlo's whereabouts, but that the government  believed him to be in Pondoland; that he was sure to be captured  eventually; that he, Langley, only wished he knew where Umhlonhlo was,  so as to have the chance of making five hundred pounds with which to buy  a certain nice little farm he knew of; and that should he ever succeed  in obtaining the reward, and consequently in taking his discharge and  purchasing the farm, he would be jolly glad if old Ghamba would come and  live with him. This is only some of what he said; when Langley's tongue  got into motion, he seemed to have some difficulty in stopping it.    However, he paused at last, and then Ghamba, looking very intently at  him, said:    \"Look here, can you keep a secret?\"    Here was a mystery.    \"Rather!\" said Langley.    \"Will you swear by the name of God that you will not reveal what I have  to tell you?\"    Langley swore.    Ghamba drew near until his teeth were within a few inches of Langley's  cheek, and said in a whisper:    \"I know where Umhlonhlo is.\"    Langley started, and said in an awed voice:    \"Where is he?\"    \"Wait a bit,\" said Ghamba; \"perhaps I will tell you, and perhaps I  won't.

(M112)    When Richard recovered his liberty and returned to England he was heartily  welcomed by all except his brother John. One of his first acts was to  visit the City and return thanks for his safety at St. Paul's.(167) The  City was on this occasion made to look its brightest, and the display of  wealth astonished the foreigners in the King's suite, who had been led to  believe that England had been brought to the lowest stage of poverty by  payment of the King's ransom.(168)    (M113) (M114)    In order to wipe out the stain of his imprisonment, he thought fit to go  through the ceremony of coronation for the second time. His first  coronation had taken place at Westminster (3 Sept., 1189,) soon after his  accession, and the citizens of London had duly performed a service at the  coronation banquet--a service which even in those days was recognised as an  \"ancient service\"--namely, that of assisting the chief butler, for which  the mayor was customarily presented with a gold cup and ewer. The citizens  of the rival city of Winchester performed on this occasion the lesser  service of attending to the viands.(169)    The second coronation taking place at Winchester and not at Westminster,  the burgesses of the former city put in a claim to the more honourable  service over the heads of the citizens of London, and the latter only  succeeded in establishing their superior claim by a judicious bribe of 200  marks.(170)    (M115)    Richard was ever in want of money, and cared little by what means it was  raised. He declared himself ready to sell London itself if a purchaser  could be found.(171) The tax of Danegelt, from which the citizens of  London had been specially exempted by charter of Henry I, and which had  ceased to be exacted under Henry II, mainly through the interposition of  Thomas of London, was practically revived under a new name. The charter  already mentioned as having been granted to the citizens by Richard after  his return from captivity was probably purchased, for one of the king's  regular methods of raising money was a lavish distribution of charters to  boroughs, not from any love he had for municipal government, but in order  to put money in his purse. As soon as Richard had collected all the money  he could raise in England, he again left the country, never to return.    (M116)    The pressure of taxation weighed heavily on the poor, and occasioned a  rising in the city under the leadership of William Fitz-Osbert. The cry  was that the rich were spared whilst the poor were called upon to pay  everything.(172) Accounts of the commotion differ according as the writer  favoured the autocratic or democratic side. One chronicler, for instance,  finds fault with Fitz-Osbert's personal appearance, imputing his  inordinate length of beard--he was known as \"Longbeard\"--to his desire for  conspicuousness, and declares him to have been actuated by base  motives.(173)    Others describe him as a wealthy citizen of the best family, and yet as  one who ever upheld the cause of the poor against the king's  extortions.(174) Whatever may have been the true character of the man and  the real motive of his action, it is certain that he had a large  following. When Hubert Walter, the justiciar, sent to arrest him,  \"Longbeard\" took refuge in the church of St. Mary-le-Bow. Thither he was  followed by the king's officers--described by a not impartial chronicler as  men devoid of truth and piety and enemies of the poor.(175)--who with the  aid of fire and faggot soon compelled him to surrender. On his way to the  Tower, he was struck at and wounded by one whose father (it was said) he  had formerly killed;(176) but this again may or may not be the whole  truth. A few days later he and a number of his associates were  hanged.(177)    (M117)    Two years before his death at Chaluz, Richard, with the view of aiding  commerce, caused the wears in the Thames to be removed, and forbade his  wardens of the Tower to demand any more the toll that had been accustomed.  The writ to this effect was dated from the Island of Andely or Les Andelys  on the Seine, the 14th July, 1197, in the neighbourhood of that fortress  which Richard had erected, and of which he was so proud--the Chateau  Gaillard or \"Saucy Castle,\" as he jestingly called it. The reputation  which the castle enjoyed for impregnability under Richard, was lost under  his successor on the throne.    (M118)    Soon after John's accession we find what appears to be the first mention  of a court of aldermen as a deliberative body. In the year 1200, writes  Thedmar (himself an alderman), \"were chosen five and twenty of the more  discreet men of the city, and sworn to take counsel on behalf of the city,  together with the mayor.\"(178) Just as in the constitution of the realm,  the House of Lords can claim a greater antiquity than the House of  Commons, so in the city--described by Lord Coke as _epitome totius  regni_--the establishment of a court of aldermen preceded that of the  common council.    (M119)    When, after thirteen years of misgovernment, during which John had enraged  the barons and excited general discontent by endless impositions, matters  were brought to a climax by his submission to the pope, it was in the city  of London that the first steps were taken by his subjects to recover their  lost liberty. On the 25th August, 1213, a meeting of the clergy and barons  was held in the church of St. Paul; a memorable meeting, and one that has  been described as \"a true parliament of the realm, though no king presided  in it.\"(179) Stephen Langton, whose appointment as Archbishop of  Canterbury had so raised John's ire, took the lead and produced to the  assembly a copy of the Charter of Liberties, granted by Henry I, when that  king undertook to put an end to the tyranny of William Rufus. If the  barons so pleased, it might (he said) serve as a precedent. The charter  having been then and there deliberately read, the barons unanimously  declared that for such liberties they were ready to fight, and, if  necessary, to die.(180)    The clergy and people who had hitherto supported the king against the  barons, having now engaged themselves to assist the barons against the  tyranny of the king, John found himself with but one friend in the world,  and that was the Pope. \"Innocent's view of the situation was very simple,\"  writes Dr. Gardiner, \"John was to obey the Pope, and all John's subjects  were to obey John.\" Within a few weeks of the council being held at St.  Paul's, the same sacred edifice witnessed the formality of affixing a  golden _bulla_ to the deed--the detestable deed (_carta  detestabilis_)--whereby John had in May last resigned the crown of England  to the papal legate, and received it again as the Pope's feudatory.(181)    (M120)    In the following year (1214), whilst the king was abroad, the barons met  again at Bury St. Edmunds, and solemnly swore that if John any longer  delayed restoring the laws and liberties of Henry the First, they would  make war upon him. It was arranged that after Christmas they should go in  a body and demand their rights, and that in the meantime they should  provide themselves with horses and arms, with the view of bringing force  to bear, in case of refusal.(182) The citizens at the same time took the  opportunity of strengthening their defences by digging a foss on the  further side of the city wall.(183)    (M121)    Christmas came and a meeting between John and the barons took place in  London at what was then known as the \"New\" Temple. The result, however,  was unsatisfactory, and both parties prepared for an appeal to force, the  barons choosing as their leader Robert Fitz-Walter, whom they dubbed  \"Marshal of the army of God and of Holy Church.\"(184)    (M122)    This Fitz-Walter was Baron of Dunmow in Essex, the owner of Baynard's  Castle in the City of London, and lord of a soke, which embraced the whole  of the parish known as St. Andrew Castle Baynard. He moreover enjoyed the  dignity of castellain and chief bannerer or banneret of London. The rights  and privileges attaching to his soke and to his official position in time  of peace were considerable, to judge from a claim to them put forward by  his grandson in the year 1303. Upon making his appearance in the Court of  Husting at the Guildhall, it was the duty of the Mayor, or other official  holding the court, to rise and meet him and place him by his side. Again,  if any traitor were taken within his soke or jurisdiction, it was his  right to sentence him to death, the manner of death being that the  convicted person should be tied to a post in the Thames at the Wood Wharf,  and remain there during two tides and two "]]]
