Many a tale was told about them, how they used to ride out hunting and  hawking, how many a magnificent banquet was given by them, and how  their beauty, their riches, and the gay and joyous life led by them  attracted many knights from near and far; how many a stately noble  came to their castle to woo one of the sisters, and how these maidens  at first ensnared and enchanted him with a thousand attractive  charms, only in the end to reject the enamoured suitor with scorn and  mockery.    Ashamed and very wrathful many a great knight had left the castle, and  with indignation and disdain had blotted out of his memory the names  of these bewitching sirens who at first had listened with deceitful  modesty to his honest wooing, only afterwards to declare with scornful  laughter that their liberty was so dear to them, that they would not  give it up for the sake of any man.    Alas! there were always youths to be found who put no faith in such  speeches and, trusting to their great names and peculiar merits,  sought their happiness among these maidens. But all the trials ended  in the same mournful manner; no suitor succeeded in winning the heart  of these seductive beings. Thus they continued their dangerous and  contemptible life for some years.    Once again there was a great banquet and feasting in the halls of the  castle. A circle of knightly figures sat round the brilliant board  among the seven sisters, who were quite conscious of their charms, one  rivalling the other in gaiety and liveliness.    The joyous scene was disturbed for a short time by two knights who  were disputing about one of the sisters, and had angered each other by  their growing jealousy.    The scene excited general attention and was looked on at first as a  most amusing one, but when the youths were about to draw their  swords, it was thought necessary to separate them.    Seizing this opportunity one of the other knights proposed that to  guard against further discord, the castle maidens should be urged to  make a final decision, so that each suitor--they all recognised one  another as such--might know what he had to expect.    The proposal met with general applause, only the sisters showed  discontentment, declaring they could not agree to such a presumptuous  plan. However the wooers tried every imaginable means of persuading  them, and at last one of the sisters wavered, a second followed her  example, and the remaining ones, after whispering to each other for  some time, declared with laughing countenances that they would decide  the fate of their suitors the next day.    The expected hour arrived, and the knights in great suspense assembled  in the large hall.    Every eye was riveted on the door through which these Graces should  enter, bringing a sweet surprise to some or a bitter disappointment to  others.    The folding-doors were suddenly thrown open, and an attendant  announced that the mistresses of the castle were waiting to receive  the knights in the garden near the river.    The numerous suitors all hurried out. To their great astonishment they  saw the fair ones all seated in a boat on the Rhine. With a peculiar  smile they beckoned the knights to approach, and the eldest sister  standing up in her seat, made the following speech.    \"You may all throw your hopes to the winds, for not one of us would  dream of falling in love with you, much less of marrying you. Our  liberty is much too precious to us, and we shall not sacrifice it for  any man. We are going to sail down to Cologne to the property of a  relation, and there we shall disappoint other suitors, just as we have  misled you, my noble lords. Good-bye, good-bye!\"    The scornful speech was accompanied by a scoffing laugh which was  re-echoed by the other sisters, and the boat set sail.    The rejected suitors stood speechless with shame and anger.    Suddenly a terrible storm arose, the boat was agitated violently, and  the laughter of the seven sisters was turned to cries for help. But  the roaring of the waves drowned their voices, and the billows rushed  over the boat, burying it and the seven sisters in the depths below.    Just on the spot where these stony-hearted maidens met their deaths,  seven pointed rocks appeared above the surface of the water, which up  to the present day are still to be seen, a salutary warning to all the  young maidens of the country.          ST. GOAR    Lorelei      [Illustration: Die Loreley--Nach dem Gemaelde von C. Begas]      I.    Above Coblenz where the Rhine flows through hills covered with  vineyards, there is a steep rock, round which many a legend has been  woven--the Lurlei Rock. The boatman gazes up at its gigantic summit  with awful reverence when his boat glides over the waters at twilight.  Like chattering children the restless waves whisper round the rock,  telling wonderful tales of its doings. Above on its gray head, the  legend relates that a beautiful but false nymph, clothed in white with  a wreath of stars in her flowing hair, used to sit and sing sweet  songs, until a sad tragedy drove her forever away.    Long long ago, when night in her dark garment descended from the  hills, and her silent comrade, the pale moon, cast a silver bridge  over the deep green stream, the soft voice of a woman was heard from  the rock, and a creature of divine beauty was seen on its summit. Her  golden locks flowed like a queenly mantle from her graceful shoulders,  covering her snow-white raiment so that her tenderly-formed body  appeared like a cloud of light. Woe to the boatsman who passed the  rock at the close of day! As of old, men were fascinated by the  heavenly song of the Grecian hero, so was the unhappy voyager allured  by this being to sweet forgetfulness, his eyes, even as his soul,  would be dazzled, and he could no longer steer clear of reefs and  cliffs, and this beautiful siren only drew him to an early grave.  Forgetting all else, he would steer towards her, already dreaming of  having reached her; but the jealous waves would wash round his boat  and at last dash him treacherously against the rocks. The roaring  waters of the Rhine would drown the cries of agony of the victim who  would never be seen again.    But the virgin to whom no one had ever approached, continued every  night to sing soft and low, till darkness vanished in the first rays  of light, and the great star of day drove the gray mists from the  valley.      II.    Ronald was a proud youth and the boldest warrior at the court of his  father, the Palatinate Count. He heard of this divine, enchanting  creature, and his heart burned with the desire to behold her. Before  having seen the water nymph, he felt drawn to her by an irresistible  power.    Under pretence of hunting, he left the court, and succeeded in getting  an old sailor to row him to the rock. Twilight was brooding over the  valley of the Rhine when the boat approached the gigantic cliff; the  departing sun had long sunk below the mountains, and now night was  creeping on in silence; the evening star was twinkling in the deep  blue firmament. Was it his protecting-angel who had placed it there  as a warning to the deluded young man?    He gazed at it in rapture for some time, until a low cry from the old  man at his side interrupted him. \"The Lorelei!\" whispered he,  startled, \"do you see her--the enchantress?\" The only answer was a  soft murmur which escaped from the youth. With wide-open eyes he  looked up and lo! there she was. Yes, this was she, this wonderful  creature! A glorious picture in a dark frame. Yes, that was her golden  hair, and those were her flowing white garments.    She was hovering up above on the rocks combing her beautiful hair;  rays of light surrounded her graceful head, revealing her charms in  spite of the night and the distance and as he gazed, her lips opened,  and a song thrilled through the silence, soft and plaintive like the  sweet notes of a nightingale on a still summer evening.    From her height she looked down into the hazy distance and cast at the  youth a rapturous look which sank down into his soul, thrilling his  whole frame.    His eyes were fixed on the features of this celestial being where he  read the sweet story of love.... Rocks, stream, glorious night, all  melted into a mist before his eyes, he saw nothing but the figure  above, nothing but her radiant eyes. The boat crept along, too slowly  for him, he could no longer remain in it, and if his ear did not  deceive him, this creature seemed to whisper his name with unutterable  sweetness, and calling to her, he dashed into the water.    A death-like cry echoed from the rocks ... and the waves sighed and  washed over the unhappy youth's corpse.    The old boatman moaned and crossed himself, and as he did so,  lightning tore the clouds asunder, and a loud peal of thunder was  heard over the mountains. Then the waves whispered gently below, and  again from the heights above, sad and dying away, sounded the Lurlei's  song.      III.    The sad news was soon brought to the Palatinate Count, who was  overpowered with grief and anger. He ordered the false enchantress to  be delivered up to him, dead or alive.    The next day a boat sailed down the Rhine, manned by four hardy bold  warriors. The leader looked up sternly at the great rocks which seemed  to be smiling silently down at him. He had asked permission to dash  the diabolical seducer from the top of the rocks into the foaming  whirlpool below, where she would find a certain death, and the count  had readily agreed to this plan of revenge.      IV.    The first shades of twilight were gliding softly over mountain and  hill.    The rock was surrounded by armed men, and the leader, followed by some  daring comrades, was climbing up the side of the mountain the top of  which was veiled in a golden mist, which the men thought were the  last rays of sunset."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20516"],[0,"Christmas: A Story (#12)"],[1,"Gussie.    \"Going to do _what_ on Christmas?\" she exclaimed. \"You ain't to do a  thing on Christmas. Or ain't you grown up, after all?\"    \"Well, we thought a Christmas funeral wouldn't hurt,\" interposed Bennet,  defensively. \"Can't we even have a funeral for fun on Christmas?\" he  ended, aggrieved.    \"It's Sandy Claus's funeral,\" observed little Emily putting a curl from  her face.    \"We're goin' dress up a Sandy Claus, you know,\" Pep added, _sotto voce_.  \"It's going to be right after breakfast, Christmas.\"    \"Come on, come ahead, fellows,\" said Bennet; \"I'll be corpse. Keep your  lids on. I don't mind. Go ahead, sing.\"    Already Mis' Winslow was walking back to the house; the other two women  overtook her; and from the porch they heard the children begin to  sing:--        \"_Go bury Saint Nicklis...._\"    The rest was lost in the closing of the door.    Back in the sitting room the women stood looking at one another. Mis'  Bates was frowning and all Mis' Moran's expressions were on the verge  of dissolving; but in Mis' Winslow's face it was as though she had found  some new way of consciousness.    \"Ladies,\" Mis' Winslow said, \"them children are out there pretending to  bury Santa Claus--and so are we. And I bet we can't any of us do it.\"    In the room, there was a moment of silence in which familiar things  seemed to join with their way of saying, \"We've been keeping still all  the while!\" Then Mis' Winslow pushed her hair, regardless of its  parting, straight back from her forehead,--a gesture with which she  characterized any moment of stress.    \"Ladies,\" she said, \"I don't want we should go back on our paper,  either. But mebbe there's more to Christmas than it knows about--or than  we know about. Mebbe we can do something that won't interfere with the  paper we've all signed, and yet that'll be something that is something.  Mebbe they's things to use that ain't never been used yet.... Oh, I  donno. Nor I guess you donno. But let's us find out!\"          IX      Christmas Week came.    Cities by thousands made preparation. Great shops took on vast cargoes  of silk and precious things and seemed ready to sail about, distributing  gifts to the town, and thought better of it, and let folk come in  numbers to them to pay toll for what they took. Banks opened their doors  and poured out, now a little trickling stream of pay envelopes, now a  torrent of green and gold. Flower stalls drew tribute from a million  pots of earth where miracles had been done. Pastry counters, those mock  commissariats, delicately masking as servants to necessity, made ready  their pretty pretences to nutrition. The woods came moving in--acres of  living green, taken in their sleep, their roots left faithful to a  tryst with the sap, their tops summoned to bear an hybrid fruitage. From  cathedrals rose the voices of children now singing little carols and  hymns in praise of the Christ-child, now speaking little verses in  praise of the saint, Nicholas, now clamouring for little new  possessions. And afar from the fields that lay empty about the clustered  roofs of towns came a chorus of voices of the live things, beast and  fowl, being offered up in the gorgeous pagan rites of the day.    Hither and yonder in every city the grown townsfolk ran. The most had  lists of names,--Grace, Margaret, Laura, Alice, Miriam, John, Philip,  Father, Mother,--beautiful names and of rich portent, so that,  remembering the time, one would have said that these were entered there  with some import of special comradeship, of being face to face, of  having realized in little what will some day be true in large. But on  looking closer, the lists were found to have quite other connotations:  as, Grace, bracelet; Margaret, spangled scarf; Laura, chafing-dish;  Philip, smoking set; Father (Memo: Ask mother what she thinks he'd  like). And every name, it seemed, stood for some bestowal of new  property, mostly of luxuries, and chiefly of luxuries of decoration. And  the minds of the buying adults were like lakes played upon by clouds and  storm birds and lightning, and, to be sure, many stars--but all in  unutterable confusion.    Also from the cargo-laden shops there came other voices in thousands,  but these were mostly answers. And when one, understanding Christmas,  listened to hear what part in it these behind the counter played, he  heard from them no voice of sharing in the theory of peace, or even of  truce, but instead:--    \"Two a yard and double width. Jewelry is in the Annex. Did you want  three pairs of each? Veils and neckwear three aisles over. Leather,  glassware, baskets, ribbons, down the store beyond the notions. Toys and  dolls are in the basement--toys and dolls are in the basement. Jewelry  is in the Annex....\"    So that a great part of the town seemed some strong chorus of invocation  to new possessions.    But there were other voices. Whole areas of every town lay, perforce,  within the days of Christmas Week--it must have been so, for there is  only one calendar to embrace humanity, as there is only one way of birth  and breath and death, one source of tears, one functioning for laughter.  But to these reaches of the town the calendar was like another thing,  for though it was upon them in name, its very presence was withdrawn. In  those ill-smelling stairways and lofts there was little to divulge the  imminence of anything other than themselves. And wherever some echo of  Christmas Week had crept, the wistfulness or the lust was for possession  also; but here one could understand its insistence. So here the voices  said only, \"I wish--I wish,\" and \"I choose this--and this,\" at windows;  or, \"If I had back my nickel....\" \"Don't you go expecting nothink!\" And  over these went the whirr of machinery, beat of treadles, throb of  engines, or the silence of forced idleness, or of the disease of  dereliction. It was a time of many pagan observances, as when some were  decked in precious stuffs and some were thrown to lions.    To all these in the towns Christmas Week came. And of them all not many  stood silent and looked Christmas Week in the face. Yet it is a human  experience that none is meant to die without sharing. For the season is  the symbol of what happens to folk if they claim it.    Christmas is the time of withdrawal of most material life. It is the  time when nature subtracts the externals, hides from man the phenomena  of even her evident processes. Left alone, his thought turns inward and  outward--which is to say, it lays hold upon the flowing force so  slightly externalized in himself. If he finds in his own being a  thousand obstructions, a thousand persons,--dogs, sorcerers,  whoremongers,--he will try to escape from them all, back to the  externals. But if he finds there a channel which the substance of being  is using, he will be no stranger, but a familiar, with himself. Only  when the channel has been long cleared, when there has left it all  consciousness of striving, of self in any form, only when he finds  himself empty, ready, immaculate, will he have the divine adventure. For  it is then that in him the spirit of God will have its birth, then that  he will first understand his own nature ... the nature of being.    Then the turn of the year comes in, the year begins to mount. Birth is  in it, growth is in it, Spring is in it. Sometime, away back in  beginnings, they knew this. They knew that the time of the Winter  solstice is in some strange fashion the high moment of the year, as the  beginning of new activity in nature and in the gods. They solemnized the  return of the fiery sun wheel; they traced in those solstice days the  operations on earth of Odin and Berchta. They knew in themselves a thing  they could not name. And when the supreme experience took place in  Christ, they made the one experience typify the other, and became  conscious of the divine nature of this nativity. So, by the illuminati,  the prophets, the adepts, the time that followed was yearly set  aside--forty days of dwelling within the temple of self, forty days of  reverence for being, of consciousness of new birth. Then the emergence,  then the apotheosis of expression typifying and typified by Spring--the  time when bursting, pressing life almost breaks bounds, when birth and  the impulse to birth are in every form of life, without and within.  These festivals are not arbitrary in date. They grow out of the  universal experience.    Is it not then cause for stupefaction that this time of \"divine  bestowal\" should have become so physical a thing? From the ancient  perception, to have slipped into a sense of annual social comradeship  and good will and peace was natural and fine--to live in the little what  will some day be true in the large. But from this to have plunged down  into a time of frantic physical bestowals, of \"present trading,\" of  lists of Grace and Margaret and Philip, of teeming shops with hunting  and hunted creatures within, of sacrificial trees and beasts, of a  sovereign sense of good for me and mine and a shameless show of Lord  and Lady Bountiful ... how can that have come about, how can the great  festival have been so dishonoured?    Not all dishonoured, for within it is its own vitality which nothing can  dishonour. Through all the curious variations which it receives at our  hands, something shines and sings: self-giving, joy giving, a vast, dim  upflickering on humanity of what this thing really is that it seeks to  observe, this thing that grips men so that no matter what they are  about, they will drop it at the touch of the gong and turn to some  expression, however crooked and thwarted, of the real spirit of the  time. If in war, then bayonets are stacked and holly-wreathed, and  candles stuck on each point! If at sea, some sailor climbs out on the  bowsprit with a wreath of green. If on the western plains, a turkey  wishbone for target will make the sport, at fifty paces; if at home,  some "]]]
