As  we must not doubt the good intentions of the Powers, we trust that  the Representatives of England and France, in their profound wisdom,  and with the spirit of equity by which they are animated, will not  refuse to take into consideration the serious difficulties which  exist, and that they will lend themselves to bring about a solution  which would preserve us from the two evils which I have pointed out  to you. That is the object which we must strive to attain.    It was in order to acquaint you with the progress of this matter  that I requested you to call upon me this morning.    Inclosure 3 in No. 30.    _Answer of Rifaat Pasha to M. Pisani, February_ 20, 1844.    Nous connaissons toute l'importance de la question dont il s'agit.  Mais il faut considérer que cette question n'est ni politique ni  administrative, et qu'elle regarde la religion. Il faut donc que  nous consultions préalablement les docteurs de la loi, et la mission  d'examiner cette affaire leur a été donnée de la part du Conseil;  cette affaire reviendra ensuite au Divan.    J'accomplis ma mission, qui est celle de porter exactement à la  connaissance des Ministres de la Sublime Porte tout ce que les deux  Représentans me disent, et je ne manquerai pas de leur faire savoir  la réponse du Conseil. Ainsi, non seulement je ne suis pas à même de  répondre aujourd'hui, mais il m'est encore impossible de vous dire  avec précision quel jour je pourrais vous la donner. Je ferai savoir  au Conseil le message dont vous vous êtes acquitté aujourd'hui.    (Translation.)    We know all the importance of the case in question. But it is  necessary to consider that this question is neither one of policy  nor of administration, and that it concerns religion. We must  therefore first consult the doctors of the law, and the charge of  inquiring into this matter has been entrusted to them by the  Council; the matter will then come back to the Divan.    I discharge my duty, which is to represent exactly to the Ministers  of the Sublime Porte what the two Representatives say to me, and I  shall not fail to let the latter know the answer of the Council. For  this reason, not only is it not in my power to give you an answer  to-day, but it is also impossible for me to say to you precisely on  what day I can give it to you. I will let the Council know the  message which you have communicated to-day.              No. 31.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received March_  24.)    (Extract.)                        _Constantinople, March_ 3, 1844.    I have this moment received important information, and I rely so  much upon its correctness that I send off an express to overtake the  messenger. The Turkish Government has virtually decided on complying  with your Lordship's requisition.    Rifaat Pasha has written to propose in rather urgent terms a private  interview with me. I have assented to this proposal, repeating at  the same time my opinion that no advantage is likely to result from  it. The French Minister will be present, and we shall probably meet  on the 5th.    In reply to our renewed demand for the Porte's official answer,  Rifaat Pasha has pressed for an additional delay of eight or ten  days, alleging that the deliberations of the Council are not yet  closed.    On the expiration of that term, or shortly afterwards, I trust it  will be in my power to forward the official confirmation of what I  now submit to your Lordship with confidence.              No. 32.      _Lord Cowley to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received March_ 27.)    My Lord,                          _Paris, March_ 25, 1844.    With reference to your Lordship's despatch of the 22nd instant  inclosing a copy of your instructions to Sir Stratford Canning under  date the 19th instant, I have the honour to state that upon  communicating those instructions to the Minister for Foreign  Affairs, he assured me that he would without loss of time send  instructions of a similar tenour to M. de Bourqueney, although that  Minister was already in possession of the sentiments of his  Government relative to those barbarous executions; which are, that  the Government of France had no intention of requiring of the  Ottoman Government that they should abrogate any law, but they  expect a satisfactory assurance in writing should be given to the  Allies that the practice complained of should cease.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) COWLEY.              No. 33.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received March_  30.)    My Lord,                          _Constantinople, March_ 6, 1844.    The confidential interview to which I was invited by Rifaat Pasha,  took place yesterday, and the French Minister was also present. In  order to mark more emphatically the private character of this  meeting we trusted entirely to Foad Effendi, who accompanied Rifaat  Pasha at my request, for the interpretation of what passed between  us. I am happy to say that although the Pasha repeated all the  arguments stated in M. Pisani's report, of which a copy has been  already transmitted to your Lordship, nothing occurred to shake my  confidence in the information previously conveyed to me and recorded  in my preceding despatch. The French Minister participated fully in  this impression, and gave me his support in a most frank and  effectual manner.    The Pasha's main position was this: if we refuse, we lose the  friendship of Europe; if we consent, we hazard the peace of the  empire; you come as friends, and therefore we reckon upon your  helping us to find some course by which we may satisfy you without  injuring ourselves.    In answer we confirmed his persuasion that our intentions were  friendly; but we added that our course was prescribed by the  instructions; that we could not admit the supposition of our  Governments having acted without a full consideration of the  consequences; and that although we were not called upon to require  an express and formal repeal of the law which they termed religious,  we must, at the very least, require an official declaration that  effectual measures would be taken to prevent the recurrence of  executions for apostacy, and a disclaimer of every idea involving  insult to Christianity, or the persecution of its followers, on  account of their faith.    This explanation appeared to produce a good effect on the Pasha's  mind, and I observed with particular satisfaction, that he admitted  that the Mufti had expressed to the Porte a personal opinion, which  drew a very desirable distinction between the strict language of the  law and the discretion warranted by State necessity.    Upon the whole, my Lord, it was sufficiently apparent that the  objections entertained by the Porte are far from insuperable; that  much of the remaining difficulty arises from the reference unwisely  made to the Ulemah; and that, with every wish to escape from our  demand, and every determination to give us the least acceptable  degree of satisfaction, there is no intention ultimately to refuse,  although it is possible that we shall not be able to obtain as  complete a declaration as we could desire without a reference to  London and Paris.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) STRATFORD CANNING.              No. 34.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received April_  4.)    (Extract.)                        _Constantinople, March_ 14, 1844.    Since I had last the honour of addressing your Lordship the Turkish  Ministers have been almost exclusively occupied with the great  question which formed the subject matter of your Lordship's  instruction of 16th January. The deferred settlement of this  question is, indeed, a source of much inconvenience to all who have  business to transact with the Porte. The affairs of Her Majesty's  Embassy, and those of the French and even of the Austrian Legation,  are almost suspended. I have, therefore, been doubly anxious to  obtain the Porte's definitive answer; but notwithstanding every  exertion consistent with the consideration due to an independent and  friendly Government, I have only this moment succeeded in obtaining  it; and I lament to say that it is so unsatisfactory as to induce me  to reject it without a moment's hesitation.    In this decision the French Minister concurs with equal promptitude  and completeness. I inclose herewith the terms of the answer, as  reported to us by our respective interpreters. It was given  verbally, but with some additional authority derived from the  presence of the Grand Vizier and the President of the Council.    The 16th instant had been previously fixed for the delivery of the  Porte's answer, and we were content to wait. This morning, however,  I received through several channels a confirmation of intelligence  which had reached me imperfectly the evening before, to the effect  that an unfavourable resolution had already been adopted by the  Council, and that the Turkish Ministers deferred the communication  of it for the sole purpose of engaging the Sultan's word, and  frustrating any eventual appeal to His Majesty. At the same time,  therefore, that, in concurrence with the French Minister, I directed  M. Pisani to demand an audience, if an immediate and satisfactory  answer were not delivered at the Porte, I sent to the Grand Marshal  of the Palace and called upon him to apprize the Sultan forthwith of  my intention to seek a formal audience of His Majesty, and to  entreat that the Royal decision might be withheld until I had an  opportunity of executing your Lordship's instruction in that  respect.    Meanwhile in spite of adverse appearances, I still retain the  opinion expressed in a former part of my correspondence. The Porte,  I am satisfied, is prepared to give"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2040"],[0,"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (#12)"],[1,"some shape or  other, with their distresses and sorrows, I at that time was disposed to  express my interest by sympathising with their pleasures.  The pains of  poverty I had lately seen too much of, more than I wished to remember;  but the pleasures of the poor, their consolations of spirit, and their  reposes from bodily toil, can never become oppressive to contemplate.  Now  Saturday night is the season for the chief, regular, and periodic return  of rest of the poor; in this point the most hostile sects unite, and  acknowledge a common link of brotherhood; almost all Christendom rests  from its labours.  It is a rest introductory to another rest, and divided  by a whole day and two nights from the renewal of toil.  On this account  I feel always, on a Saturday night, as though I also were released from  some yoke of labour, had some wages to receive, and some luxury of repose  to enjoy.  For the sake, therefore, of witnessing, upon as large a scale  as possible, a spectacle with which my sympathy was so entire, I used  often on Saturday nights, after I had taken opium, to wander forth,  without much regarding the direction or the distance, to all the markets  and other parts of London to which the poor resort of a Saturday night,  for laying out their wages.  Many a family party, consisting of a man,  his wife, and sometimes one or two of his children, have I listened to,  as they stood consulting on their ways and means, or the strength of  their exchequer, or the price of household articles.  Gradually I became  familiar with their wishes, their difficulties, and their opinions.  Sometimes there might be heard murmurs of discontent, but far oftener  expressions on the countenance, or uttered in words, of patience, hope,  and tranquillity.  And taken generally, I must say that, in this point at  least, the poor are more philosophic than the rich--that they show a more  ready and cheerful submission to what they consider as irremediable evils  or irreparable losses.  Whenever I saw occasion, or could do it without  appearing to be intrusive, I joined their parties, and gave my opinion  upon the matter in discussion, which, if not always judicious, was always  received indulgently.  If wages were a little higher or expected to be  so, or the quartern loaf a little lower, or it was reported that onions  and butter were expected to fall, I was glad; yet, if the contrary were  true, I drew from opium some means of consoling myself.  For opium (like  the bee, that extracts its materials indiscriminately from roses and from  the soot of chimneys) can overrule all feelings into compliance with the  master-key.  Some of these rambles led me to great distances, for an  opium-eater is too happy to observe the motion of time; and sometimes in  my attempts to steer homewards, upon nautical principles, by fixing my  eye on the pole-star, and seeking ambitiously for a north-west passage,  instead of circumnavigating all the capes and head-lands I had doubled in  my outward voyage, I came suddenly upon such knotty problems of alleys,  such enigmatical entries, and such sphynx's riddles of streets without  thoroughfares, as must, I conceive, baffle the audacity of porters and  confound the intellects of hackney-coachmen.  I could almost have  believed at times that I must be the first discoverer of some of these  _terrae incognitae_, and doubted whether they had yet been laid down in  the modern charts of London.  For all this, however, I paid a heavy price  in distant years, when the human face tyrannised over my dreams, and the  perplexities of my steps in London came back and haunted my sleep, with  the feeling of perplexities, moral and intellectual, that brought  confusion to the reason, or anguish and remorse to the conscience.    Thus I have shown that opium does not of necessity produce inactivity or  torpor, but that, on the contrary, it often led me into markets and  theatres.  Yet, in candour, I will admit that markets and theatres are  not the appropriate haunts of the opium-eater when in the divinest state  incident to his enjoyment.  In that state, crowds become an oppression to  him; music even, too sensual and gross.  He naturally seeks solitude and  silence, as indispensable conditions of those trances, or profoundest  reveries, which are the crown and consummation of what opium can do for  human nature.  I, whose disease it was to meditate too much and to  observe too little, and who upon my first entrance at college was nearly  falling into a deep melancholy, from brooding too much on the sufferings  which I had witnessed in London, was sufficiently aware of the tendencies  of my own thoughts to do all I could to counteract them.  I was, indeed,  like a person who, according to the old legend, had entered the cave of  Trophonius; and the remedies I sought were to force myself into society,  and to keep my understanding in continual activity upon matters of  science.  But for these remedies I should certainly have become  hypochondriacally melancholy.  In after years, however, when my  cheerfulness was more fully re-established, I yielded to my natural  inclination for a solitary life.  And at that time I often fell into  these reveries upon taking opium; and more than once it has happened to  me, on a summer night, when I have been at an open window, in a room from  which I could overlook the sea at a mile below me, and could command a  view of the great town of L---, at about the same distance, that I have  sate from sunset to sunrise, motionless, and without wishing to move.    I shall be charged with mysticism, Behmenism, quietism, &c., but _that_  shall not alarm me.  Sir H. Vane, the younger, was one of our wisest men;  and let my reader see if he, in his philosophical works, be half as  unmystical as I am.  I say, then, that it has often struck me that the  scene itself was somewhat typical of what took place in such a reverie.  The town of L--- represented the earth, with its sorrows and its graves  left behind, yet not out of sight, nor wholly forgotten.  The ocean, in  everlasting but gentle agitation, and brooded over by a dove-like calm,  might not unfitly typify the mind and the mood which then swayed it.  For  it seemed to me as if then first I stood at a distance and aloof from the  uproar of life; as if the tumult, the fever, and the strife were  suspended; a respite granted from the secret burthens of the heart; a  sabbath of repose; a resting from human labours.  Here were the hopes  which blossom in the paths of life reconciled with the peace which is in  the grave; motions of the intellect as unwearied as the heavens, yet for  all anxieties a halcyon calm; a tranquillity that seemed no product of  inertia, but as if resulting from mighty and equal antagonisms; infinite  activities, infinite repose.    Oh, just, subtle, and mighty opium! that to the hearts of poor and rich  alike, for the wounds that will never heal, and for \"the pangs that tempt  the spirit to rebel,\" bringest an assuaging balm; eloquent opium! that  with thy potent rhetoric stealest away the purposes of wrath; and to the  guilty man for one night givest back the hopes of his youth, and hands  washed pure from blood; and to the proud man a brief oblivion for       Wrongs undress'd and insults unavenged;    that summonest to the chancery of dreams, for the triumphs of suffering  innocence, false witnesses; and confoundest perjury, and dost reverse the  sentences of unrighteous judges;--thou buildest upon the bosom of  darkness, out of the fantastic imagery of the brain, cities and temples  beyond the art of Phidias and Praxiteles--beyond the splendour of Babylon  and Hekatompylos, and \"from the anarchy of dreaming sleep\" callest into  sunny light the faces of long-buried beauties and the blessed household  countenances cleansed from the \"dishonours of the grave.\"  Thou only  givest these gifts to man; and thou hast the keys of Paradise, oh, just,  subtle, and mighty opium!        INTRODUCTION TO THE PAINS OF OPIUM      Courteous, and I hope indulgent, reader (for all _my_ readers must be  indulgent ones, or else I fear I shall shock them too much to count on  their courtesy), having accompanied me thus far, now let me request you  to move onwards for about eight years; that is to say, from 1804 (when I  have said that my acquaintance with opium first began) to 1812.  The  years of academic life are now over and gone--almost forgotten; the  student's cap no longer presses my temples; if my cap exist at all, it  presses those of some youthful scholar, I trust, as happy as myself, and  as passionate a lover of knowledge.  My gown is by this time, I dare say,  in the same condition with many thousand excellent books in the Bodleian,  viz., diligently perused by certain studious moths and worms; or  departed, however (which is all that I know of his fate), to that great  reservoir of _somewhere_ to which all the tea-cups, tea-caddies,  tea-pots, tea-kettles, &c., have departed (not to speak of still frailer  vessels, such as glasses, decanters, bed-makers, &c.), which occasional  resemblances in the present generation of tea-cups, &c., remind me of  having once possessed, but of whose departure and final fate I, in common  with most gownsmen of either university, could give, I suspect, but an  obscure and conjectural history.  The persecutions of the chapel-bell,  sounding its unwelcome summons to six o'clock matins, interrupts my  slumbers no longer, the porter who rang it, upon whose beautiful nose  (bronze, inlaid with copper) I wrote, in retaliation so many Greek  epigrams whilst I was dressing, is dead, and has ceased to disturb  anybody; and I, and many others who suffered much from his tintinnabulous  propensities, have now agreed to overlook his errors, and have forgiven  him.  Even with the bell I am now in charity; it rings, I suppose, as  formerly, thrice a-day, and cruelly annoys, I doubt not, many worthy"]]]
