The terms defined in Sec. 120 are often combined with others, as  _e.g._,         _Pianissimo possibile_--as softly as possible.         _Piano assai_--very softly.         _Fortissimo possibile_--as loudly as possible.         _Forte piano_ (_fp_)--loud, followed at once by soft.    As in the case of terms relating to tempo, the meaning of many other  expressions relating to _dynamics_ may easily be arrived at by recalling  the list of auxiliary terms quoted under Sec. 96.    122. The terms _sforzando_, _forzando_, _sforzato_ and _forzato_ all  indicate a strong accent on a single tone or chord. These words are  abbreviated as follows:--_sf_,_fz_, and _sfz_, the abbreviation being  placed directly above (sometimes below) the note or chord affected. The  signs [vertical accent symbol] and [horizontal accent symbol] are also  commonly used to indicate such an accent.         In interpreting these accent marks the student must bear in       mind again the fact that they have a relative rather than an       absolute meaning: the mark _sf_ occurring in the midst of a       _piano_ passage will indicate a much milder form of accent       than would the same mark occurring in the midst of a _forte_       passage.    123. The words _rinforzando_ and _rinforzato_ (abb.--_rinf._ and _rfz._)  mean literally _reinforced_, and are used to indicate a sudden increase  in power usually extending over an entire phrase or passage instead of  applying only to a single tone or chord as in the case of _sforzando_,  etc.    124. _Crescendo_ (abb.--_cresc._ or [crescendo symbol]) means a gradual  increase in power. It will be noted that this word does not mean _loud_,  nor does it mean a sudden increase in power unless accompanied by some  auxiliary term such as _subito_, or _molto_.    Broadly speaking there are _two varieties of crescendo_: (1) that in  which the same tone increases in power while being prolonged; (2) that  in which succeeding tones are each sounded more strongly than the  preceding one. The first variety is possible only on instruments giving  forth a tone which can be varied _after it begins_. Thus _e.g._, the  human voice, the violin, the organ enclosed in a swell box, and certain  wind instruments, are all capable of sounding a tone softly at first and  gradually increasing the volume until the maximal point of power has  been reached. But on the piano, organ not enclosed in a swell-box,  kettle drum, etc., the power of the tone cannot be varied after the  tone has once been sounded, and a _crescendo_ effect is therefore  possible only in a _passage_, in rendering which each succeeding tone is  struck more forcibly than its immediate predecessor. This second variety  of _crescendo_ offers a means of dramatic effect which may be employed  most strikingly, as _e.g._, when a long passage begins very softly and  increases in power little by little until the utmost resources of the  instrument or orchestra have been reached. A notable example of such an  effect is found in the transition from the third to the fourth movements  of the Beethoven Fifth Symphony.         The difference between _sforzando_, _rinforzando_, and       _crescendo_ should now be noted: _sforzando_ indicates that a       single tone or chord is to be louder; _rinforzando_, that an       entire passage is to be louder, beginning with its first tone;       but _crescendo_ indicates that there is to be a gradual       increase in power, this increase sometimes occurring during       the sounding of a single tone, but more often in a passage.    125. Certain _combinations of the word crescendo_ with other words are  so common that they should be especially noted. Among these are:         _Crescendo al fortissimo_--keep on gradually increasing in       power until the fortissimo (or very loud) point has been       reached.         _Crescendo subito_--increase in power suddenly (or rapidly).         _Crescendo poco a poco_--increase in power very, very       gradually.         _Crescendo poi diminuendo_--first increase, then diminish the       tone.         _Crescendo e diminuendo_--same as _cresc. poi dim._         _Crescendo molto_--increase in power very greatly.         _Crescendo ed animando poco a poco_--growing gradually louder       in tone and quicker in _tempo_.         _Crescendo ed affrettando_--gradually louder and faster.       [Transcriber's Note: Corrected misspelling \"affretando\" in       original.]         _Crescendo poco a poco sin al fine_--crescendo gradually even       up to the very end.    126. _Decrescendo_ (_decresc._ or [decrescendo symbol]) means a gradual  diminishing of the tone. It is the opposite of _crescendo_. The word  _diminuendo_ is synonymous with _decrescendo_.    _Decrescendo_ (or _diminuendo_) _al pianissimo_ means--decrease  gradually in power until the _pianissimo_ (or very soft) point is  reached.    127. A number of _terms referring to both softer tone and slower tempo_  are in use. The most common of these are:--_mancando_, _moriente_,[30]  _morendo_, _perdendo_ (from _perdere_--to lose), _perdendosi_,  _calando_, and _smorzando_.[31] Such expressions are usually  translated--\"gradually dying away.\"    [Footnote 30: Both _moriente_ and _morendo_ mean literally--_dying_.]    [Footnote 31: From _smorzare_ (It.)--to extinguish.]    128. In piano music the abbreviation _Ped._ indicates that the damper  pedal (the one at the right) is to be depressed, while the sign [damper  release symbol] shows that it is to be released. In many modern editions  this depression and release of the damper pedal are more accurately  indicated by the sign [damper symbol].         The term _senza sordini_ is also occasionally found in old       editions, indicating that the damper pedal is to be depressed,       while _con sordini_ shows that it is to be released. These       expressions are taken from a usage in music for stringed       instruments, in which the term _con sordini_ means that the       mute (a small clamp of metal, ivory or hardwood) is to be       affixed to the bridge, this causing a modification in both       power and quality of the tone. The damper on the piano does       not in any way correspond to the mute thus used on stringed       instruments, and the terms above explained as sometimes       occurring in piano music are not to be recommended, even       though Beethoven used them in this sense in all his earlier       sonatas.    129. The words _una corda_ (lit.--one string) indicate that the \"soft  pedal\" (the one at the left) is to be depressed, while the words _tre  corde_ (lit. three strings) or _tutte le corde_ (all the strings) show  that the same pedal is to be released. These expressions refer to the  fact that on grand pianos the \"soft pedal\" when depressed moves the  hammers to one side so that instead of striking three strings they  strike only two (in the older pianos only one, hence _una corda_), all  three strings (_tre corde_) being struck again after the release of the  pedal.    130. Other terms relating either directly or indirectly to the subject  of dynamics are:         _Con alcuna licenza_--with some degree of license.         _Con amore_--with tenderness.         _Con bravura_--with boldness.         _Con celerita_--with rapidity.         _Con delicato_--with delicacy.         _Con energico_--with energy.         _Con espressione_--with expression.         _Con forza_--with force.         _Con fuoco_--with fire and passion.         _Con grand' espressione_--with great expression.         _Con grazia_--with grace.         _Con melinconia_--with melancholy. [Transcriber's Note:       archaic form of \"malinconia\".]         _Con passione_--with passion.         _Con spirito_--with spirit.         _Con tenerezza_--with tenderness.         _Delicato_--delicately.         _Dolce_--sweetly, gently.         _Dolcissimo_--most sweetly.         _Dolce e cantabile_--gently and with singing tone.         _Dolente_  }       _Doloroso_ } plaintively or sorrowfully.         _Espressivo_--expressively.         _Grandioso_--grandly, pompously.         _Grazioso_--gracefully.         _Giocoso_--humorously, (cf. jocose).         _Giojoso_--joyfully, (cf. joyous).         _Lacrimando_, _lacrimoso_--sorrowfully.         _Legato_--smoothly.         _Leggiero_--lightly.         _Leggierissimo_--most lightly; almost a staccato.         _Lusingando_--caressingly, coaxingly, tenderly.         _Maesta_, _maestoso_--majestically.         _Martellando_, _martellato_--strongly accented,       (lit.--hammered).         _Marziale_--martial--war-like.         _Mesto_--pensively.         _Mezzo voce_--with half voice.         _Misterioso_--mysteriously.         _Parlando_--well accented or enunciated; applied to melody       playing. (The word parlando means literally-speaking.)         _Pastorale_--in simple and unaffected style, (lit.--pastoral,       rural).         _Pomposo_--pompously.         _Precipitoso_--precipitously.         _Recitativo_--well enunciated. (This meaning applies only in       instrumental music in which a melody is to stand out above the       accompaniment. For def. of recitative in vocal music, see p.       78.)         _Risoluto_--firmly, resolutely.         _Scherzando_, _scherzoso_, etc.--jokingly. These terms are       derived from the word _scherzo_ meaning _a musical joke_.         _Semplice_--simply.         _Sempre marcatissimo_--always well marked, _i.e._, strongly       accented.         _Sentimento_--with sentiment.         _Solenne_--solemn.         _Sotto voce_--in subdued voice.         _Spiritoso_--with spirit.         _Strepitoso_--precipitously.         _Tranquillo_--tranquilly.         _Tristamente_--sadly.    131. Many other terms are encountered which on their face sometimes seem  to be quite formidable, but which yield readily to analysis. Thus  _e.g._, _crescendo poco a poco al forte ed un pochettino"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1951"],[0,"The Coming Race (#12)"],[1,"of the Vril-ya, with the  exception of the artful wings which served them, when on foot, as a  graceful mantle. But as many of the Vril-ya, when occupied in urban  pursuits, did not wear these wings, this exception created no marked  difference between myself and the race among whom I sojourned, and I was  thus enabled to visit the town without exciting unpleasant curiosity.  Out of the household no one suspected that I had come from the upper  world, and I was but regarded as one of some inferior and barbarous  tribe whom Aph-Lin entertained as a guest.    The city was large in proportion to the territory round it, which was of  no greater extent than many an English or Hungarian nobleman's estate;  but the whole if it, to the verge of the rocks which constituted its  boundary, was cultivated to the nicest degree, except where certain  allotments of mountain and pasture were humanely left free to the  sustenance of the harmless animals they had tamed, though not for  domestic use. So great is their kindness towards these humbler  creatures, that a sum is devoted from the public treasury for the  purpose of deporting them to other Vril-ya communities willing to  receive them (chiefly new colonies), whenever they become too numerous  for the pastures allotted to them in their native place. They do not,  however, multiply to an extent comparable to the ratio at which, with  us, animals bred for slaughter, increase. It seems a law of nature that  animals not useful to man gradually recede from the domains he occupies,  or even become extinct. It is an old custom of the various sovereign  states amidst which the race of the Vril-ya are distributed, to leave  between each state a neutral and uncultivated border-land. In the  instance of the community I speak of, this tract, being a ridge of  savage rocks, was impassable by foot, but was easily surmounted, whether  by the wings of the inhabitants or the air-boats, of which I shall speak  hereafter. Roads through it were also cut for the transit of vehicles  impelled by vril. These intercommunicating tracts were always kept  lighted, and the expense thereof defrayed by a special tax, to which all  the communities comprehended in the denomination of Vril-ya contribute  in settled proportions. By these means a considerable commercial traffic  with other states, both near and distant, was carried on. The surplus  wealth on this special community was chiefly agricultural. The community  was also eminent for skill in constructing implements connected with the  arts of husbandry. In exchange for such merchandise it obtained articles  more of luxury than necessity. There were few things imported on which  they set a higher price than birds taught to pipe artful tunes in  concert. These were brought from a great distance, and were marvellous  for beauty of song and plumage. I understand that extraordinary care was  taken by their breeders and teachers in selection, and that the species  had wonderfully improved during the last few years. I saw no other  pet animals among this community except some very amusing and sportive  creatures of the Batrachian species, resembling frogs, but with very  intelligent countenances, which the children were fond of, and kept in  their private gardens. They appear to have no animals akin to our dogs  or horses, though that learned naturalist, Zee, informed me that such  creatures had once existed in those parts, and might now be found in  regions inhabited by other races than the Vril-ya. She said that they  had gradually disappeared from the more civilised world since the  discovery of vril, and the results attending that discovery had  dispensed with their uses. Machinery and the invention of wings had  superseded the horse as a beast of burden; and the dog was no longer  wanted either for protection or the chase, as it had been when the  ancestors of the Vril-ya feared the aggressions of their own kind, or  hunted the lesser animals for food. Indeed, however, so far as the horse  was concerned, this region was so rocky that a horse could have been,  there, of little use either for pastime or burden. The only creature  they use for the latter purpose is a kind of large goat which is much  employed on farms. The nature of the surrounding soil in these  districts may be said to have first suggested the invention of wings and  air-boats. The largeness of space in proportion to the space occupied by  the city, was occasioned by the custom of surrounding every house with a  separate garden. The broad main street, in which Aph-Lin dwelt, expanded  into a vast square, in which were placed the College of Sages and all  the public offices; a magnificent fountain of the luminous fluid which I  call naptha (I am ignorant of its real nature) in the centre. All these  public edifices have a uniform character of massiveness and solidity.  They reminded me of the architectural pictures of Martin. Along the  upper stories of each ran a balcony, or rather a terraced garden,  supported by columns, filled with flowering plants, and tenanted by  many kinds of tame birds.    From the square branched several streets, all broad and brilliantly  lighted, and ascending up the eminence on either side. In my excursions  in the town I was never allowed to go alone; Aph-Lin or his daughter was  my habitual companion. In this community the adult Gy is seen walking  with any young An as familiarly as if there were no difference of sex.    The retail shops are not very numerous; the persons who attend on a  customer are all children of various ages, and exceedingly intelligent  and courteous, but without the least touch of importunity or cringing.  The shopkeeper himself might or might not be visible; when visible, he  seemed rarely employed on any matter connected with his professional  business; and yet he had taken to that business from special liking for  it, and quite independently of his general sources of fortune.    The Ana of the community are, on the whole, an indolent set of beings  after the active age of childhood. Whether by temperament or philosophy,  they rank repose among the chief blessings of life. Indeed, when you  take away from a human being the incentives to action which are found in  cupidity or ambition, it seems to me no wonder that he rests quiet.    In their ordinary movements they prefer the use of their feet to that  of their wings. But for their sports or (to indulge in a bold misuse of  terms) their public 'promenades,' they employ the latter, also for the  aerial dances I have described, as well as for visiting their country  places, which are mostly placed on lofty heights; and, when still young,  they prefer their wings for travel into the other regions of the Ana, to  vehicular conveyances.    Those who accustom themselves to flight can fly, if less rapidly than  some birds, yet from twenty-five to thirty miles an hour, and keep up  that rate for five or six hours at a stretch. But the Ana generally, on  reaching middle age, are not fond of rapid movements requiring violent  exercise. Perhaps for this reason, as they hold a doctrine which our  own physicians will doubtless approve--viz., that regular transpiration  through the pores of the skin is essential to health, they habitually  use the sweating-baths to which we give the name Turkish or Roman,  succeeded by douches of perfumed waters. They have great faith in the  salubrious virtue of certain perfumes.    It is their custom also, at stated but rare periods, perhaps four times  a-year when in health, to use a bath charged with vril.*    * I once tried the effect of the vril bath. It was very similar in its  invigorating powers to that of the baths at Gastein, the virtues  of which are ascribed by many physicians to electricity; but though  similar, the effect of the vril bath was more lasting.    They consider that this fluid, sparingly used, is a great sustainer of  life; but used in excess, when in the normal state of health, rather  tends to reaction and exhausted vitality. For nearly all their diseases,  however, they resort to it as the chief assistant to nature in throwing  off their complaint.    In their own way they are the most luxurious of people, but all their  luxuries are innocent. They may be said to dwell in an atmosphere of  music and fragrance. Every room has its mechanical contrivances for  melodious sounds, usually tuned down to soft-murmured notes, which seem  like sweet whispers from invisible spirits. They are too accustomed to  these gentle sounds to find them a hindrance to conversation, nor, when  alone, to reflection. But they have a notion that to breathe an air  filled with continuous melody and perfume has necessarily an effect  at once soothing and elevating upon the formation of character and the  habits of thought. Though so temperate, and with total abstinence from  other animal food than milk, and from all intoxicating drinks, they are  delicate and dainty to an extreme in food and beverage; and in all their  sports even the old exhibit a childlike gaiety. Happiness is the end at  which they aim, not as the excitement of a moment, but as the prevailing  condition of the entire existence; and regard for the happiness of each  other is evinced by the exquisite amenity of their manners.    Their conformation of skull has marked differences from that of any  known races in the upper world, though I cannot help thinking it a  development, in the course of countless ages of the Brachycephalic type  of the Age of Stone in Lyell's 'Elements of Geology,' C. X., p. 113, as  compared with the Dolichocephalic type of the beginning of the Age of  Iron, correspondent with that now so prevalent amongst us, and called  the Celtic type. It has the same comparative massiveness of forehead,  not receding like the Celtic--the same even roundness in the frontal  organs; but it is far loftier in the apex, and far less pronounced  in the hinder cranial hemisphere "]]]
