His figures are often  engaged in subjects that required great expression: yet his \"Judith and  Holofernes,\" the \"Daughter of Herodias with the Baptist's Head,\" the  \"Andromeda,\" and even the \"Mothers of the Innocents,\" have little more  expression than his \"Venus attired by the Graces.\"    Obvious as these remarks appear, there are many writers on our art, who,  not being of the profession, and consequently not knowing what can or  what cannot be done, have been very liberal of absurd praises in their  descriptions of favourite works.  They always find in them what they are  resolved to find.  They praise excellences that can hardly exist  together, and above all things are fond of describing with great  exactness the expression of a mixed passion, which more particularly  appears to me out of the reach of our art.    Such are many disquisitions which I have read on some of the cartoons and  other pictures of Raffaelle, where the critics have described their own  imagination; or indeed where the excellent master himself may have  attempted this expression of passions above the powers of the art; and  has, therefore, by an indistinct and imperfect marking, left room for  every imagination, with equal probability to find a passion of his own.  What has been, and what can be done in the art, is sufficiently  difficult; we need not be mortified or discouraged for not being able to  execute the conceptions of a romantic imagination.  Art has its  boundaries, though imagination has none.  We can easily, like the  ancients, suppose a Jupiter to be possessed of all those powers and  perfections which the subordinate Deities were endowed with separately.  Yet, when they employed their art to represent him, they confined his  character to majesty alone.  Pliny, therefore, though we are under great  obligations to him for the information he has given us in relation to the  works of the ancient artists, is very frequently wrong when he speaks of  them, which he does very often in the style of many of our modern  connoisseurs.  He observes that in a statue of Paris, by Fuphranor, you  might discover at the same time three different characters; the dignity  of a judge of the goddesses, the lover of Helen, and the conqueror of  Achilles.  A statue in which you endeavour to unite stately dignity,  youthful elegance, and stern valour, must surely possess none of these to  any eminent degree.    From hence it appears that there is much difficulty as well as danger in  an endeavour to concentrate upon a single subject those various powers  which, rising from different points, naturally move in different  directions.    The summit of excellence seems to be an assemblage of contrary qualities,  but mixed, in such proportions, that no one part is found to counteract  the other.  How hard this is to be attained in every art, those only know  who have made the greatest progress in their respective professions.    To conclude what I have to say on this part of the subject, which I think  of great importance, I wish you to understand that I do not discourage  the younger students from the noble attempt of uniting all the  excellences of art, but to make them aware that, besides the difficulties  which attend every arduous attempt, there is a peculiar difficulty in the  choice of the excellences which ought to be united; I wish you to attend  to this, that you may try yourselves, whenever you are capable of that  trial, what you can, and what you cannot do: and that, instead of  dissipating your natural faculties over the immense field of possible  excellence, you may choose some particular walk in which you may exercise  all your powers, in order each of you to be the first in his way.  If any  man shall be master of such a transcendant, commanding, and ductile  genius, as to enable him to rise to the highest, and to stoop to the  lowest flights of art, and to sweep over all of them unobstructed and  secure, he is fitter to give example than to receive instruction.    Having said thus much on the union of excellences, I will next say  something of the subordination in which various excellences ought to be  kept.    I am of opinion that the ornamental style, which in my discourse of last  year I cautioned you against considering as principal, may not be wholly  unworthy the attention of those who aim even at the grand style; when it  is properly placed and properly reduced.    But this study will be used with far better effect, if its principles are  employed in softening the harshness and mitigating the rigour of the  great style, than if in attempt to stand forward with any pretensions of  its own to positive and original excellence.    It was thus Lodovico Caracci, whose example I formerly recommended to  you, employed it.  He was acquainted with the works both of Correggio and  the Venetian painters, and knew the principles by which they produced  those pleasing effects which at the first glance prepossess us so much in  their favour; but he took only as much from each as would embellish, but  not overpower, that manly strength and energy of style, which is his  peculiar character.    Since I have already expatiated so largely in my former discourse, and in  my present, upon the styles and characters of painting, it will not be at  all unsuitable to my subject if I mention to you some particulars  relative to the leading principles, and capital works of those who  excelled in the great style, that I may bring you from abstraction nearer  to practice, and by exemplifying the propositions which I have laid down,  enable you to understand more clearly what I would enforce.    The principal works of modern art are in fresco, a mode of painting which  excludes attention to minute elegancies: yet these works in fresco are  the productions on which the fame of the greatest masters depend: such  are the pictures of Michael Angelo and Raffaelle in the Vatican, to which  we may add the cartoons, which, though not strictly to be called fresco,  yet may be put under that denomination; and such are the works of Giulio  Romano at Mantua.  If these performances were destroyed, with them would  be lost the best part of the reputation of those illustrious painters,  for these are justly considered as the greatest efforts of our art which  the world can boast.  To these, therefore, we should principally direct  our attention for higher excellences.  As for the lower arts, as they  have been once discovered, they may be easily attained by those possessed  of the former.    Raffaelle, who stands in general foremost of the first painters, owes his  reputation, as I have observed, to his excellence in the higher parts of  the art.  Therefore, his works in fresco ought to be the first object of  our study and attention.  His easel-works stand in a lower degree of  estimation; for though he continually, to the day of his death,  embellished his works more and more with the addition of these lower  ornaments, which entirely make the merit of some, yet he never arrived at  such perfection as to make him an object of imitation.  He never was able  to conquer perfectly that dryness, or even littleness of manner, which he  inherited from his master.  He never acquired that nicety of taste in  colours, that breadth of light and shadow, that art and management of  uniting light, to light, and shadow to shadow, so as to make the object  rise out of the ground with that plenitude of effect so much admired in  the works of Correggio.  When he painted in oil, his hand seemed to be so  cramped and confined that he not only lost that facility and spirit, but  I think even that correctness of form, which is so perfect and admirable  in his fresco works.  I do not recollect any pictures of his of this  kind, except perhaps the \"Transfiguration,\" in which there are not some  parts that appear to be even feebly drawn.  That this is not a necessary  attendant on oil-painting, we have abundant instances in more modern  painters.  Lodovico Caracci, for instance, preserved in his works in oil  the same spirit, vigour, and correctness, which he had in fresco.  I have  no desire to degrade Raffaelle from the high rank which he deservedly  holds: but by comparing him with himself, he does not appear to me to be  the same man in oil as in fresco.    From those who have ambition to tread in this great walk of the art,  Michael Angelo claims the next attention.  He did not possess so many  excellences as Raffaelle, but those he had were of the highest kind.  He  considered the art as consisting of little more than what may be attained  by sculpture, correctness of form, and energy of character.  We ought not  to expect more than an artist intends in his work.  He never attempted  those lesser elegancies and graces in the art.  Vasari says, he never  painted but one picture in oil, and resolved never to paint another,  saying it was an employment only fit for women and children.    If any man had a right to look down upon the lower accomplishments as  beneath his attention, it was certainly Michael Angelo: nor can it be  thought strange that such a mind should have slighted or have been  withheld from paying due attention to all those graces and embellishments  of art which have diffused such lustre over the works of other painters.    It must be acknowledged likewise, that together with these, which we wish  he had more attended to, he has rejected all the false though specious  ornaments which disgrace the works even of the most esteemed artists; and  I will venture to say, that when those higher excellences are more known  and cultivated by the artists and the patrons of arts, his fame and  credit will increase with our increasing knowledge.  His name will then  be held in the same veneration as it was in the enlightened age of Leo  the Tenth: and it is remarkable that the reputation of this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21781"],[0,"Text Book of Biology, Part 1: Vertebrata (#12)"],[1,"behind this curtain is the crystalline lens (l.), the  curvature of the anterior face or which is controlled by the ciliary  muscle (c.m.). In front of the lens is the aqueous humour (a.h.). The  description of the action of this apparatus involves the explanation of  several of the elementary principles of optics, and will be found by  the student in any text-book of that subject. Here it would have no  very instructive bearing, either on general physiological considerations  or upon anatomical fact.      Section 112. The structure of the retina demands fuller notice. Figure  9 shows an enlarged, diagram of a small portion of this, the  percipient part of the eye. The optic nerve (o.n. in Figure 8) enters  the eye at a spot called the blind spot (B.S.), and the nerve fibres  spread thence over the inner retinal surface. From this layer of nerve  fibres (o.n. in Figure 9) threads run outward, through certain clear  and granular layers, to an outermost stratum of little rods (r.) and  fusiform bodies called cones (c.), lying side by side. The whole of  the retina consists of quite transparent matter, and it is this outermost  layer of rods and cones (r. and c.) that receives and records the visual  impression. This turning of the recipient ends away from the light is  hardly what one would at first expect-- it seems such a roundabout  arrangement-- but it obtains in all vertebrata, and it is a striking point  of comparison with the ordinary invertebrate eye.      Section 113. We may pause to call the student's attention to a little  point in the physiology of nerves, very happily illustrated here. The  function of a nerve fibre is the conduction of impressions pure and  simple; the light radiates through the fibrous layer of the retina without  producing the slightest impression, and at the blind spot, where the  rods and cones are absent, and the nerve fibres are gathered  together, no visual impressions are recorded. If there is any doubt as  to the existence of a blind spot in the retinal picture, the proof is easy.  Let the reader shut his left eye, and regard these two asterisks, fixing  his gaze intently upon the left-hand one of them.       *   *    At a distance of three or four inches from the paper, both spots will be  focussed on his retina, the left one in the centre of vision, and the  right one at some spot internal to this, and he will see them both  distinctly. Now, if he withdraws his head slowly, the right spot will of  course appear to approach the left, and at a distance of ten or twelve  inches it will, in its approach, pass over the blind spot and vanish, to  reappear as he continues to move his head away from the paper.  The function of nerve fibres is simply conduction, and the nature of the  impressions they convey is entirely determined by the nature of their  distal and proximal terminations.      Section 114. Certain small muscles in the orbit (eye-socket) move the  eye, and by their action contribute to our perception of the  relative position of objects. There is a leash of four muscles rising  from a spot behind the exit of the optic nerve from the cranium to the  upper, under, anterior, and posterior sides of the eyeball. These are  the superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior recti. Running from the  front of the orbit obliquely to the underside of the eyeball is the  inferior oblique muscle. Corresponding to it above is a superior oblique.  A lachrymal gland lies in the postero-inferior angle of the orbit, and a  Handerian gland in the corresponding position in front. In addition to  the upper and lower eyelids of the human subject, the rabbit has a  third, the nictitating lid, in the anterior corner of the eye.      Section 115. The ear (Sheet VII.) consists of an essential organ of  hearing, and of certain superadded parts. The essential part is called  the internal ear, and is represented in all the true vertebrata (i.e.,  excluding the lancelet and its allies). In the lower forms it is a hollow  membranous structure, embedded in a mass of cartilage, the otic  capsule; in the mammal the latter is entirely ossified, to form the  periotic bone. The internal ear consists of a central sac, from which  three semicircular canals spring. The planes of the three canals are  mutually at right angles; two are vertical, the anterior and posterior  (p.v.c.) vertical canals, and one is horizontal, the horizontal canal  (h.c.). There are dilatations, called ampullae, at the anterior base of  the anterior, and at the posterior base of the posterior and horizontal  canals. Indirectly connected with the main sac is a spirally-twisted  portion, resembling a snail shell in form, the cochlea. This last part  is distinctive of the mammalia, but the rest of the internal ear is  represented in all vertebrata, with one or two exceptions. The whole of  the labyrinth is membranous, and contains a fluid, the endolymph;  between the membranous wall of the labyrinth and the enclosing bone  is a space containing the perilymph. Strange as it may appear at first,  the entire lining of the internal ear is, at an early stage, continuous  with the general epidermis of the animal. It grows in just as a gland  might grow in, and is finally cut off from the exterior; but a  considerable relic of this former communication remains as a thin,  vertical blind tube (not shown in the figure), the ductus  endolymphaticus.      Section 116. The eighth nerve runs from the brain case (Cr.), into the  periotic bone, and is distributed to the several portions of this  labyrinth. In an ordinary fish this internal ear is the sole auditory organ  we should find; the sound-waves would travel through the water to the  elastic cranium and so reach and affect the nerves. But in all  air-frequenting animals this original plan of an ear has to be added to,  to fit it to the much fainter sound vibrations of the compressible and  far less elastic air. A \"receiving apparatus\" is needed, and is supplied  by the ear-drum, middle ear, or tympanic cavity (T.). In the mammal  there is also a collecting ear trumpet (the ear commonly so-called),  the external ear, and external auditory meatus (e.a.m.). A tightly  stretched membrane, the tympanic membrane, separates this from  the drum. A chain of small bones, the malleus (m.), the incus (i.), the  os orbiculare (o.or.), a very small bone, and a stirrup-shaped stapes,  swing across the tympanum, from the tympanic membrane to the  internal ear. At two points the bony investment of this last is  incomplete-- at the fenestra rotunda (f.r.), and at the fenestra ovalis,  (f.o.), into which latter the end of the stapes fits, and so  communicates the sound vibrations of the tympanic membrane to the  endolymph. A passage, the Eustachian tube, communicates between  the tympanic cavity and the pharynx (Ph.), and serves to equalize the  pressure on either side of the drum-head. A comparative study of the  ears of the vertebrata brings to light the fact that, as we descend in  the animal scale, the four ear ossicles are replaced by large bones  and cartilages connected with the jaw, and the drum and Eustachian  tube by a gill slit. We have, in fact, in the ear, as the student will  perceive in the sequel, an essentially aquatic auditory organ, added to  and patched up to fit the new needs of a life out of water.      Section 117. The impressions of smell are conducted through the first  nerve to the brain, and are first received by special hair-bearing cells  in the olfactory mucous membrane of the upper part of the nasal  passage. The sense of taste has a special nerve in the ninth, the  fibres of which terminate in special cells and cell aggregates in the  little papillae (velvet pile-like processes) that cover the tongue.      Section 118. At an early stage in development, the brain of a  mammal consists of a linear arrangement of three hollow vesicles  (Figure 5, Sheet VIII., 1, 2, and 3), which are the fore-, mid-, and  hind-brain respectively. The cavities in these in these vesicles are  continuous with a hollow running through the spinal cord. On the  dorsal side of the fore-brain is a structure to be dealt with more fully  later, the pineal gland (p.g.), while on its under surface is the  pituitary body (pt.).      Section 119. The lower figure of (5) shows, in a diagrammatic manner,  the derivation of the adult brain from this primitive state. From the  fore-brain vesicle, a hollow outgrowth on either side gives rises to the  (paired) cerebral hemisphere (c.h.), which is prolonged forward as the  olfactory lobe (o.l.). From the fore-brain the retina of the eye and the  optic nerve also originate as an, at first, hollow outgrowth (op.). The  roof of the mid-brain is also thickened, and bulges up to form two  pairs of thickenings, the corpora quadrigemina, (c.q.). The hind-brain  sends up in front a median outgrowth, which develops lateral wings,  the cerebellum (cbm.), behind which the remainder of the hind-brain is  called the medulla oblongata, and passes without any very definite  demarcation into the spinal cord.      Section 120. Figure 1 is a corresponding figure of the actual state of  affairs in the adult. The brain is seen in median vertical section. (ch.)  is the right cerebral hemisphere, an inflated vesicle, which, in the  mammal-- but not in our lower types-- reaches back over the rest of  the fore-brain, and also over the mid-brain, and hides these and the  pineal gland in the dorsal view of the brain (Figure 2). The hollow of the  hemisphere on either side communicates with the third ventricle, the  original cavity of the fore-brain (1 in Figure 5), by an aperture (the  foramen of Monro), indicated by a black arrow (f.M.). Besides their  original communication through the intermediation of the fore-brain,  the hemispheres are also united above its roof by a broad bridge of  fibre, the corpus callosum (c.c.), which is distinctive of the  mammalian animals.
