[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21699"],[0,"The Rover of the Andes: A Tale of Adventure on South America (#12)"],[1," certain Manco Capac  founded the dynasty of the Incas.  According to an old legend this Manco  was the son of a white man who was shipwrecked on the coast of Peru.  He  married the daughter of an Indian chief, and taught the people  agriculture, architecture, and other arts.  He must have been a man of  great power, from the influence he exerted over the natives, who styled  him the `blooming stranger.'  His hair was of a golden colour, and this  gave rise to the story that he was a child of the sun, who had been sent  to rule over the Indians and found an empire.  Another tradition says  that Manco Capac was accompanied by a wife named Mama Oello Huaco, who  taught the Indian women the mysteries of spinning and weaving, while her  husband taught the arts of civilisation to the men.    \"Whatever truth there may be in these legends, certain it is that Manco  Capac did become the first of a race of Incas--or kings or chiefs--and,  it is said, laid the foundations of the city of Cuzco, the remains of  which at the present day show the power, splendour, and wealth to which  Manco Capac and his successors attained.  The government of the Incas  was despotic, but of a benignant and patriarchal type, which gained the  affections of those over whom they ruled, and enabled them to extend  their sway far and wide over the land, so that, at the time of the  invasion by the Spaniards under Pizarro, the Peruvians were found to  have reached a high degree of civilisation, as was seen by their public  works--roads, bridges, terrace-gardens, fortifications, and magnificent  buildings, and so forth.  It is said by those who have studied the  matter, that this civilisation existed long before the coming of the  Incas.  On this point I can say nothing, but no doubt or uncertainty  rests on the later history of this race.  Cuzco, on Lake Titicaca,  became the capital city of a great and flourishing monarchy, and  possessed many splendid buildings in spacious squares and streets.  It  also became the Holy City and great temple of the Sun, to which pilgrims  came from all parts of the country.  It was defended by a fortress and  walls built of stone, some blocks of which were above thirty feet long  by eighteen broad and six thick.  Many towns sprang up in the land.  Under good government the people flourished and became rich.  They had  plenty of gold and silver, which they used extensively in the adornment  of their temples and palaces.  But evil followed in the train of wealth.  By degrees their simplicity departed from them.  Their prosperity led  to the desire for conquest.  Then two sons of one of the Incas disputed  with each other for supremacy, and fought.  One was conquered and taken  prisoner by the other, who is reported to have been guilty of excessive  cruelties to his relations, and caused his brother to be put to death.  Finally, in 1532, the Spaniards came and accomplished the conquest of  Peru--from which date not much of peace or prosperity has fallen to the  lot of this unhappy land.    \"Yes,\" said the guide in conclusion, \"the Incas were, and some of their  descendants still are, a very fine race.  Many of the men are what I  call nature's gentlemen, having thoughts--ay, and manners too, that  would grace any society.  Some of their women, also, are worthy to--\"    \"Pedro!\" interrupted Lawrence eagerly, laying his hand on the guide's  arm, for a sudden idea had flashed into his mind.  (He was rather  subject to the flashing of sudden ideas!) \"Pedro! _she_ is a daughter of  a chief of the Incas--is she not? a princess of the Incas!  Have I not  guessed rightly?\"    He said this in a half whisper, and pointed as he spoke to the screen  behind which Manuela lay.    Pedro smiled slightly and tipped the ash from the end of his cigarette,  but made no answer.    \"Nay, I will not pry into other people's affairs,\" said Lawrence, in his  usual tone, \"but you once told me she is the daughter of a chief, and  assuredly no lady in this land could equal her in grace or dignity of  carriage and manner, to say nothing of modesty, which is the invariable  evidence.\"    \"Not of high rank?\" interrupted the guide, with a quick and slightly  sarcastic glance.    \"No, but of nobility of mind and heart,\" replied the youth, with much  enthusiasm.  In which feeling he was earnestly backed up by Quashy, who,  with eyes that absolutely glowed, said--    \"You's right, massa--sure an' sartin!  Modesty am de grandest t'ing I  knows.  Once I knowed a young nigger gal what libbed near your fadder's  mill--Sooz'n dey calls 'er--an' she's _so_ modest, so--oh!  I not kin  'splain rightly--but I say to 'er one day, when I'd got my courage  screwed up, `Sooz'n,' ses I.  `Well,' ses she.  `I--I lub you,' ses I,  `more nor myself, 'cause I t'ink so well ob you.  Eberybody t'inks well  ob you, Sooz'n.  What--what--' (I was gitten out o' bref by dis time  from 'citement, and not knowin' what more to say, so I ses) `what--what  you t'ink ob _you'self_ Sooz'n?'    \"`Nuffin',' ses she!  Now, _wasn't_ dat modest?\"    \"It certainly was, Quashy.  Couldn't have been more so,\" said Pedro.  \"And after that we couldn't, I think, do better than turn in.\"    The fire had by that time burned low, and the gale was still raging  around them, driving the snowdrift wildly against the hut, and sometimes  giving the door so violent a shake as to startle poor Quashy out of  sweet memories of Sooz'n into awful thoughts of the ghost that had not  yet been laid.    Each man appropriated a vacant corner of the hut in which to spread his  simple couch, the negro taking care to secure that furthest from the  door.    Lawrence Armstrong thought much over his supposed discovery before  falling asleep that night, and the more he thought the more he felt  convinced that the Indian girl was indeed a princess, and owed her good  looks, sweet disposition, graceful form and noble carriage to her  descent from a race which had at one period been highly civilised when  all around them were savage.  It was a curious subject of contemplation.  The colour of his waking thoughts naturally projected itself into the  young man's dreams.  He was engaged in an interesting anthropological  study.  He found himself in the ancient capital of the Incas.  He beheld  a princess of great beauty surrounded by courtiers, but she was _brown_!  He thought what an overwhelming pity it was that she was not _white_!  Then he experienced a feeling of intense disappointment that he himself  had not been born brown.  By degrees his thoughts became more confused  and less decided in colour--whitey-brown, in fact,--and presented a  series of complicated regrets and perplexing impossibilities, in a vain  effort to disentangle which he dropped asleep.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    THINGS BEGIN TO LOOK BRIGHTER--THE GUIDE'S STORY.    It was bright day when our travellers awoke, but only a dim light  penetrated into their dungeon-like dormitory, for, besides being very  small, the three windows, or loop-holes, had been so filled up with snow  as to shut out much of the light that would naturally have entered.    That the gale still raged outside was evident enough to the sense of  hearing, and sometimes the gusts were so sudden and strong that the  little building trembled, stout though it was.  Indeed, Lawrence at  first thought they must be experiencing the shocks of an earthquake, a  mistake not unnatural in one who, besides having had but little  experience in regard to such catastrophes, knew well that he was at the  time almost in the centre of a region celebrated for earthquakes.    It was with mingled feelings of interest, anxiety, and solemnity that he  surveyed the scene outside through a hole in the door.  It seemed as if  an Arctic winter had suddenly descended on them.  Snow completely  covered hill and gorge as far as the vision could range but they could  not see far, for at every fresh burst of the furious wind the restless  wreaths were gathered up and whirled madly to the sky, or swept wildly  down the valleys, or dashed with fury against black precipices and  beetling cliffs, to which they would sometimes cling for a few seconds,  then, falling away, would be caught up again by the tormenting gale, and  driven along in some new direction with intensified violence.    \"No prospect of quitting the hut to-day,\" observed Lawrence, turning  away from the bewildering scene.    \"None,\" said Pedro, stretching himself, and rising sleepily on one  elbow, as men are wont to do when unwilling to get up.    \"Nebber mind, massa; lots o' grub!\" cried Quashy, awaking at that  moment, leaping up like an acrobat, and instantly setting about the  kindling of the fire.    Having, as Quashy truly said, lots of grub, possessing a superabundance  of animal vigour, and being gifted with untried as well as unknown  depths of intellectual power, also with inexhaustible stores of youthful  hope, our travellers had no difficulty in passing that day in  considerable enjoyment, despite adverse circumstances; but when they  awoke on the second morning and found the gale still howling, and the  snow still madly whirling, all except Pedro began to express in word and  countenance feelings of despondency.  Manuela did not speak much, it is  true, but she naturally looked somewhat anxious.  Lawrence began to  recall the fate of previous travellers in that very hut, and his  countenance became unusually grave, whereupon Quashy--whose nature it  was to conform to the lead of those whom he loved, and, in conforming,  outrageously to overdo his part--looked in his young master's face and  assumed such an aspect of woeful depression that his visage became  distinctly oval, though naturally round.    Observing this, Lawrence could not restrain a short laugh, whereupon,  true as the compass to the Pole, the facile Quashy went right round; his  chin came up, his cheeks went out, his eyes opened with hopeful sheen,  and his thick lips"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21717"],[0,"Battles with the Sea (#12)"],[1," Looking at the matter in this light, the  records of the Institution show that thousands of men, women, and  children, are beneficially influenced by the lifeboat cause.    The highest contributor to its funds in the land is our Queen; the  lowliest a sailor's orphan child.  Here are a few of the gifts to the  Institution, culled almost at random from the Reports.  One gentleman  leaves it a legacy of 10,000 pounds.  Some time ago a sum of 5000 pounds  was sent anonymously by \"a friend.\"  A hundred pounds comes in as a  _second_ donation from \"a sailor's daughter.\"  Fifty pounds come from a  British admiral, and five shillings from \"the savings of a child!\"  One-and-sixpence is sent by another child in postage-stamps, and 1 pound  5 shillings as the collection of a Sunday school in Manchester; 15  pounds from three fellow-servants; 10 pounds from a shipwrecked pilot,  and 10 shillings, 6 pence from an \"old salt.\"  I myself had once the  pleasure of receiving twopence for the lifeboat cause from an  exceedingly poor but enthusiastic old woman!  But my most interesting  experience in this way was the receipt of a note written by a blind  boy--well and legibly written, too--telling me that he had raised the  sum of 100 pounds for the Lifeboat Institution.    And this beneficial influence of our lifeboat service travels far beyond  our own shores.  Here is evidence of that.  Finland sends 50 pounds to  our Institution to testify its appreciation of the good done by us to  its sailors.  President Lincoln, of the United States, when involved in  all the anxieties of the great war between North and South, found time  to send 100 pounds to the Institution in acknowledgment of services  rendered to American ships in distress.  Russia and Holland send naval  men to inspect--not our armaments and _materiel_ of hateful war, but--  our lifeboat management!  France, in generous emulation, starts a  Lifeboat Institution of its own, and sends over to ask our society to  supply it with boats--and, last, but not least, it has been said that  foreigners, driven far out of their course and stranded, soon come to  know that they have been wrecked on the British coast, by the  persevering efforts that are made to save their lives!    And now, good reader, let me urge this subject on your earnest  consideration.  Surely every one should be ready to lend a hand to  _rescue the perishing_!  One would think it almost superfluous to say  more.  So it would be, if there were none who required the line of duty  and privilege to be pointed out to them.  But I fear that many,  especially dwellers in the interior of our land, are not sufficiently  alive to the claims that the lifeboat has upon them.    Let me illustrate this by a case or two--imaginary cases, I admit, but  none the less illustrative on that account.    \"Mother,\" says a little boy, with flashing eyes and curly flaxen hair;  \"I want to go to sea!\"    He has been reading \"Cook's Voyages\" and \"Robinson Crusoe,\" and looks  wistfully out upon the small pond in front of his home, which is the  biggest \"bit of water\" his eyes have ever seen, for he dwells among the  cornfields and pastures of the interior of the land.    \"Don't think of it, darling Willie.  You might get wrecked,--perhaps  drowned.\"    But \"darling Willie\" does think of it, and asserts that being wrecked is  the very thing he wants, and that he's willing to take his chance of  being drowned!  And Willie goes on thinking of it, year after year,  until he gains his point, and becomes the family's \"sailor boy,\" and  mayhap, for the first time in her life, Willie's mother casts more than  a passing glance at newspaper records of lifeboat work.  But she does no  more.  She has not yet been awakened.  \"The people of the coast  naturally look after the things of the coast,\" has been her sentiment on  the subject--if she has had any definite sentiments about it at all.    On returning from his first voyage Willie's ship is wrecked.  On a  horrible night, in the howling tempest, with his flaxen curls tossed  about, his hands convulsively clutching the shrouds of the topmast, and  the hissing billows leaping up as if they wished to lick him off his  refuge on the cross-trees, Willie awakens to the dread reality about  which he had dreamed when reading Cook and Crusoe.  Next morning a lady  with livid face, and eyes glaring at a newspaper, gasps, \"Willie's  ship--is--wrecked! five lost--thirteen saved by the lifeboat.\"  One  faint gleam of hope!  \"Willie may be among the thirteen!\"  Minutes, that  seem hours, of agony ensue; then a telegram arrives, \"_Saved, Mother--  thank God,--by the lifeboat_.\"    \"Ay, thank God,\" echoes Willie's mother, with the profoundest emotion  and sincerity she ever felt; but think you, reader, that she did no  more?  Did she pass languidly over the records of lifeboat work after  _that_ day?  Did she leave the management and support of lifeboats to  _the people of the coast_?  I trow not.  But what difference had the  saving of Willie made in the lifeboat cause?  Was hers the only Willie  in the wide World?  Are we to act on so selfish a principle, as that we  shall decline to take an interest in an admittedly grand and good and  national cause, until our eyes are forcibly opened by \"our Willie\" being  in danger?  Of course I address myself to people who have really kind  and sympathetic hearts, but who, from one cause or another, have not yet  had this subject earnestly submitted to their consideration.  To those  who have _no heart_ to consider the woes and necessities of suffering  humanity, I have nothing whatever to say,--except,--God help them!    Let me enforce this plea--that _inland_ cities and towns and villages  should support the Lifeboat Institution--with another imaginary case.    A tremendous gale is blowing from the south-east, sleet driving like  needles--enough, almost, to put your eyes out.  A \"good ship,\" under  close-reefed topsails, is bearing up for port after a prosperous voyage,  but the air is so thick with drift that they cannot make out the guiding  lights.  She strikes and sticks fast on outlying sands, where the sea is  roaring and leaping like a thousand fiends in the wintry blast.  There  are passengers on board from the Antipodes, with boxes and bags of  gold-dust, the result of years of toil at the diggings.  They do not  realise the full significance of the catastrophe.  No wonder--they are  landsmen!  The tide chances to be low at the time; as it rises, they  awake to the dread reality.  Billows burst over them like miniature  Niagaras.  The good ship which has for many weeks breasted the waves so  gallantly, and seemed so solid and so strong, is treated like a cork,  and becomes apparently an egg-shell!    Night comes--darkness increasing the awful aspect of the situation  tenfold.  What are boxes and bags of gold-dust now--now that wild  despair has seized them all, excepting those who, through God's grace,  have learned to \"fear no evil?\"    Suddenly, through darkness, spray, and hurly-burly thick, a ghostly boat  is seen!  The lifeboat!  Well do the seamen know its form!  A cheer  arouses sinking hearts, and hope once more revives.  The work of  rescuing is vigorously, violently, almost fiercely begun.  The merest  child might see that the motto of the lifeboat-men is \"Victory or  death.\"  But it cannot be done as quickly as they desire; the rolling of  the wreck, the mad plunging and sheering of the boat, prevent that.    A sturdy middle-aged man named Brown--a common name, frequently  associated with common sense--is having a rope fastened round his waist  by one of the lifeboat crew named Jones--also a common name, not seldom  associated with uncommon courage.  But Brown must wait a few minutes  while his wife is being lowered into the boat.    \"Oh! be careful.  Do it gently, there's a good fellow,\" roars Brown, in  terrible anxiety, as he sees her swung off.    \"Never fear, sir; she's all right,\" says Jones, with a quiet reassuring  smile, for Jones is a tough old hand, accustomed to such scenes.    Mrs Brown misses the boat, and dips into the raging sea.    \"Gone!\" gasps Brown, struggling to free himself from Jones and leap  after her, but the grasp of Jones is too much for him.    \"Hold on, sir? _she's_ all right, sir, bless you; they'll have her on  board in a minute.\"    \"I've got bags, boxes, _bucketfuls_ of gold in the hold,\" roars Brown.  \"Only save her, and it's all yours!\"    The shrieking blast will not allow even _his_ strong voice to reach the  men in the lifeboat, but they need no such inducement to work.    \"The gold won't be yours long,\" remarks Jones, with another smile.  Neptune'll have it all to-night.  See! they've got her into the boat all  right, sir.  Now don't struggle so; you'll get down to her in a minute.  There's another lady to go before your turn comes.    During these few moments of forced inaction the self-possessed Jones  remarks to Brown, in order to quiet him, that they'll be all saved in  half an hour, and asks if he lives near that part of the coast.    \"Live near it!\" gasps Brown.  \"No!  I live nowhere.  Bin five years at  the diggings.  Made a fortune.  Going to live with the old folk now--at  Blunderton, far away from the sea; high up among the mountains.\"    \"Hm!\" grunts Jones.  \"Do they help to float the lifeboats at  Blunderton?\"    \"The lifeboats?  No, of course not; never think of lifeboats up there.\"    \"Some of you think of 'em down _here_, though,\" remarks Jones.  \"Do  _you_ help the cause in any way, sir?\"    \"Me?  No.  Never gave a shilling to it.\"    \"Well, never mind.  It's your turn now, sir.  Come along.  We'll save  you.  Jump!\" cries Jones.    And they do save him, and all on board of that ill-fated ship, with as  much heartfelt satisfaction as if the rescued ones had each been a  contributor of a thousand a year to the lifeboat cause.    \"Don't forget us, sir, when you gits home,\" whispers Jones"]]]
