And if a sparrow cannot fall to      the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can      rise without his aid?\" But in spite of this most earnest appeal      the motion was rejected, since, as we are told, \"the Convention,      except three or four persons, thought prayers unnecessary.\"        The accomplished American biographer, by whom this last incident      is recorded, expresses in the same passage deep regret that Dr.      Franklin did not bestow more attention than he seems to have done      on the evidences of Christianity. And indeed there are several      indications that he was less well acquainted with points of      Christian faith and discipline than with almost any other subject.      One of these indications, and surely a most strange one, occurs in      the Private Diary which he kept at Passy during part of 1784. It      appears that two young American gentlemen had come over to London      with the view of entering Holy Orders, but that the Archbishop of      Canterbury refused them Ordination unless they would take the Oath      of Allegiance. In this dilemma Franklin actually applied to the      Pope's Nuncio at Paris to ascertain whether a Roman Catholic      Bishop in America might not perform the ceremony for them as      Protestants, and he transcribes as remarkable the natural reply:      \"The Nuncio says the thing is impossible unless the gentlemen      become Roman Catholics.\"        The religious scepticism or indifference of Franklin, which his      present biographers justly lament, was, however, in his own day, a      recommendation and a merit with the French philosophists. On the      other hand, his hostility to England endeared him to the French      politicians. On both these grounds, as well as from his high      scientific attainments, he found himself during his residence of      several years at Paris in no common measure courted, flattered,      and caressed. A fine verse, one of the noblest which modern      Latinity can boast, describes him as having plucked the lightning      from Heaven and the sceptre from tyrants.        Descending from such lofty flights to the regions of sober      reality, we may observe that Franklin in his later years, and      especially in France, adopted to a great extent the Quaker garb.      He laid aside the huge wig which he used to wear in England, and      allowed his long white hair to flow down nearly to his shoulders.      His clothes were of the plainest cut and of the dunnest color. The      Parisians of that period, ever swayed by external impressions,      were greatly struck with, and in their writings frequently refer      to, his venerable aspect, and they compared him by turns to all      the sages of antiquity. It is also probable that his Quaker-like      attire may have tended to invest him in their estimation with the      other attributes which they assigned to the ideal Quaker      character, as simplicity, guilelessness, inviolable truth.                                     LA FAYETTE.        It so chanced that in the summer of 1776, La Fayette, still in his      teens, and serving as a subaltern with the French army, was      stationed with his regiment at Metz. It happened also that in the      course of a foreign tour their Royal Highnesses of Gloucester      passed a few days in that town. The principal officers entertained      the Duke at dinner, when the conversation turned to the last news      from Philadelphia and the new Declaration of Independence. Being      at that period offended with his Court, from its neglect of the      Duchess, the Duke indulged in Opposition topics, and, in some      degree at least, took the part of the Americans. The details were      new to La Fayette. He listened with eagerness, and prolonged the      conversation by asking questions of the Royal guest. The cause of      the colonies that had risen against England seemed to him just and      noble, even on the showing of one of the English princes; and      before he left the table, the thought came into his head that he      would go to America, and offer the Americans his services. He      determined to return to Paris, and make further inquiries. His      inquiries being mainly addressed to Silas Deane and other zealous      friends of the insurgents, could not fail to confirm him in his      first impressions. He became fired with an ardent zeal for      Republican principles and the American cause. That zeal continued      ever afterwards--for well nigh sixty years--the polar star of his      course. That zeal, favored as it was by fortune, adapted to the      times that came upon him, and urged forward by great personal      vanity, laid the foundations of his fame far more, as I conceive,      than any strength of mind or talents of his own. Few men have ever      been so conspicuous from afar with so little, when closely viewed,      of real weight or dimension. As a general, it can scarcely be      pretended that his exploits were either many or considerable. As      an orator, we look in vain for any high powers of debate. As a      statesman, we find only an undistinguishing eagerness to apply the      Transatlantic examples and to act the part of Washington, without      duly estimating either the immense superiority of Washington's      character above his own, or the manifold points of difference      between America and Europe.        It was said by Napoleon at St. Helena, that \"La Fayette was a man      of no ability, either in civil or military life; his understanding      was confined to narrow bounds; his character was full of      dissimulation, and swayed by vague ideas of liberty, which, in      him, were undefined and ill-digested.\" No doubt there is some      exaggeration in these words. No doubt the late Emperor, at that      period, was stirred by personal resentment at the hostile conduct      of the General in 1815; yet it will perhaps be found more easy by      any admirer of La Fayette to impugn the good faith of the      draughtsman than the general accuracy of the portrait.        The fortune of La Fayette was ample, his yearly income being      little short of two hundred thousand livres; and his connexions,      as we have seen, were among the first at Court. Under such      circumstances, Silas Deane felt the vast importance of securing      him. An agreement was concluded between them, by the intervention      of one Mr. Carmichael (for as yet La Fayette spoke no English, and      Deane little French), according to the terms of which the Marquis      de La Fayette was to join the American service, and to receive      from Congress the rank of Major-General--no slight temptation to a      stripling of nineteen! La Fayette was to be accompanied, or rather      attended, by the Baron de Kalb and eleven other officers of lower      rank, seeking service in America. He sent, in secret, an agent to      Bordeaux, there to purchase and prepare a vessel for their voyage.      Meanwhile he made an excursion of three weeks to London, where his      kinsman, the Marquis de Noailles, was ambassador. He was presented      to the King, and graciously received. He saw at the opera General      Clinton, who had come home on a winter leave of absence, and who      was next to meet him on a field of battle in America. But, mindful      of his own hostile designs, he deemed it proper to forbear from      prying into the military forces of the kingdom, and declined an      invitation to visit the naval armament at Portsmouth.        On his return to France, La Fayette bade farewell to his young      wife, leaving her four months gone with child, and set out for      Bordeaux. Thus far all had prospered according to his wishes. But      at Bordeaux he found that his preparations had been discovered and      complained of by Lord Stormont, and that a LETTRE DE CACHET for      his arrest was already issued. Nevertheless, he did not relinquish      his design. He crossed the Spanish frontier in the disguise of a      courier, found his vessel at Pasages, and there embarked with his      companions. Towards the middle of June he landed on the coast of      Carolina; and after a few days' rest, pursued his route to      Philadelphia. His reception by the Congress was not at first a      warm one; but La Fayette declared that he would accept no pay, and      was willing to serve as a volunteer; and under these      circumstances, the Assembly fulfilled the terms of the secret      agreement, and bestowed on him the rank of Major-General.        At Philadelphia La Fayette saw the American troops for the first      time, and, according to his own account, was struck with their      grotesque appearance--with green boughs fastened to their      hats--coarse hunting-shirts instead of uniforms--and muskets, many      wanting bayonets, and all of unequal make and size. But he soon      learnt to think more favorably of these raw levies, when,      notwithstanding all their disadvantages, he observed their conduct      in the field. With regard to their commander, his early      impressions never changed. It was also at Philadelphia, and at a      dinner-table, comprising several members of the Congress, that La      Fayette was introduced to Washington. The boy-general found      himself warmly welcomed by the chief whom he had long admired.      \"When you come to the army,\" said Washington, \"I shall be pleased      if you will make my quarters your home, and consider yourself as      one of my family.\" The invitation thus frankly tendered was no      less frankly accepted. Thus did a cordial intimacy arise between      them, Washington at all times treating La Fayette with fatherly      kindness, and La Fayette looking up to Washington with filial      regard.

I shall describe the  belief in immortality, or rather in the continued existence of the human  soul after death, as that belief is found among certain of the lower  races, and I shall give some account of the religion which has been  based upon it. That religion is in brief a propitiation or worship of  the human dead, who according to the degree of power ascribed to them by  the living are supposed to vary in dignity from the humble rank of a  mere common ghost up to the proud position of deity. The elements of  such a worship appear to exist among all races of men, though in some  they have been much more highly developed than in others.    [Sidenote: Preliminary account of savage beliefs concerning the nature  and origin of death.]    But before I address myself to the description of particular races, I  wish in this and the following lecture to give you some general account  of the beliefs of savages concerning the nature and origin of death. The  problem of death has very naturally exercised the minds of men in all  ages. Unlike so many problems which interest only a few solitary  thinkers this one concerns us all alike, since simpletons as well as  sages must die, and even the most heedless and feather-brained can  hardly help sometimes asking themselves what comes after death. The  question is therefore thrust in a practical, indeed importunate form on  our attention; and we need not wonder that in the long history of human  speculation some of the highest intellects should have occupied  themselves with it and sought to find an answer to the riddle. Some of  their solutions of the problem, though dressed out in all the beauty of  exquisite language and poetic imagery, singularly resemble the rude  guesses of savages. So little, it would seem, do the natural powers even  of the greatest minds avail to pierce the thick veil that hides the end  of life.    [Sidenote: The problem of death is one of universal interest.]    In saying that the problem is thrust home upon us all, I do not mean to  imply that all men are constantly or even often engaged in meditating on  the nature and origin of death. Far from it. Few people trouble  themselves about that or any other purely abstract question: the common  man would probably not give a straw for an answer to it. What he wants  to know, what we all want to know, is whether death is the end of all  things for the individual, whether our conscious personality perishes  with the body or survives it for a time or for eternity. That is the  enigma propounded to every human being who has been born into the world:  that is the door at which so many enquirers have knocked in vain. Stated  in this limited form the problem has indeed been of universal interest:  there is no race of men known to us which has not pondered the mystery  and arrived at some conclusions to which it more or less confidently  adheres. Not that all races have paid an equal attention to it. On some  it has weighed much more heavily than on others. While some races, like  some individuals, take death almost lightly, and are too busy with the  certainties of the present world to pay much heed to the uncertainties  of a world to come, the minds of others have dwelt on the prospect of a  life beyond the grave till the thought of it has risen with them to a  passion, almost to an obsession, and has begotten a contempt for the  fleeting joys of this ephemeral existence by comparison with the  hoped-for bliss of an eternal existence hereafter. To the sceptic,  examining the evidence for immortality by the cold light of reason, such  peoples and such individuals may seem to sacrifice the substance for the  shadow: to adopt a homely comparison, they are like the dog in the fable  who dropped the real leg of mutton, from his mouth in order to snap at  its reflection in the water. Be that as it may, where such beliefs and  hopes are entertained in full force, the whole activity of the mind and  the whole energy of the body are apt to be devoted to a preparation for  a blissful or at all events an untroubled eternity, and life becomes, in  the language of Plato, a meditation or practising of death. This  excessive preoccupation with a problematic future has been a fruitful  source of the most fatal aberrations both for nations and individuals.  In pursuit of these visionary aims the few short years of life have been  frittered away: wealth has been squandered: blood has been poured out in  torrents: the natural affections have been stifled; and the cheerful  serenity of reason has been exchanged for the melancholy gloom of  madness.      \"Oh threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise!    One thing at least is certain--_This_ Life flies;      One thing is certain and the rest is Lies;    The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.\"    [Sidenote: The belief in immortality general among mankind.]    The question whether our conscious personality survives after death has  been answered by almost all races of men in the affirmative. On this  point sceptical or agnostic peoples are nearly, if not wholly, unknown.  Accordingly if abstract truth could be determined, like the gravest  issues of national policy, by a show of hands or a counting of heads,  the doctrine of human immortality, or at least of a life after death,  would deserve to rank among the most firmly established of truths; for  were the question put to the vote of the whole of mankind, there can be  no doubt that the ayes would have it by an overwhelming majority. The  few dissenters would be overborne; their voices would be drowned in the  general roar. For dissenters there have been even among savages. The  Tongans, for example, thought that only the souls of noblemen are saved,  the rest perish with their bodies.[6] However, this aristocratic view  has never been popular, and is not likely to find favour in our  democratic age.    [Sidenote: Belief of many savages that they would never die if their  lives were not cut short by sorcery. Belief of the Abipones.]    But many savage races not only believe in a life after death; they are  even of opinion that they would never die at all if it were not for the  maleficent arts of sorcerers who cut the vital thread prematurely short.  In other words, they disbelieve in what we call a natural death; they  think that all men are naturally immortal in this life, and that every  death which takes place is in fact a violent death inflicted by the hand  of a human enemy, though in many cases the foe is invisible and works  his fell purpose not by a sword or a spear but by magic. Thus the  Abipones, a now extinct tribe of horse Indians in Paraguay, used to  allege that they would be immortal and that none of them would ever die  if only the Spaniards and the sorcerers could be banished from America;  for they were in the habit of attributing every death, whatever its  cause, either to the baleful arts of sorcerers or to the firearms of the  Spaniards. Even if a man died riddled with wounds, with his bones  smashed, or through the exhaustion of old age, these Indians would all  deny that the wounds or old age was the cause of his death; they firmly  believed that the death was brought about by magic, and they would make  careful enquiries to discover the sorcerer who had cast the fatal spell  on their comrade. The relations of the deceased would move every stone  to detect and punish the culprit; and they imagined that they could do  this by cutting out the heart and tongue of the dead man and"]]]
