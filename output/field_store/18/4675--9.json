[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22521"],[0,"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (#12)"],[1,"    In a small tent near the entrance were the curiosities. They were about  to walk in when a young man curtly asked for tickets.    \"We bought tickets at the gate. Here they are.\"    \"All right; but you need separate tickets here.\"    \"I declare that's a swindle,\" said Mrs. Bickford. \"I thought we could  see the whole show on these.\"    \"We only charge ten cents extra for this.\"    \"It's a shame. Shall we go in, Aaron?\"    \"I guess we will. I want to see that 'ere fat woman.\"    \"I'd like to see the dwarf and the woman with hair five feet long. A  circus is dreadful expensive, but bein' as we're here we might as well  see the whole thing.\"    Twenty cents was paid at the door, and the economical pair, grown  suddenly so extravagant, walked in.    The first object on which the blacksmith's eyes rested kindled him with  indignation, and recalled mortifying memories. It was Achilles  Henderson, the giant, who, on his side recognized Aaron Bickford.    \"Good evening, my friend,\" he said, with a smile. \"I believe we have met  before.\"    \"Do you know him?\" asked Mrs. Bickford, in surprise.    Aaron's brow contracted as he answered:    \"It's the ruffian that threw me over the fence this morning.\"    \"I see you remember me,\" said Achilles, good-naturedly.    \"I ought to remember you,\" retorted the blacksmith.    \"Come, don't bear malice. It was only a little joke.\"    \"I don't like such jokes.\"    \"Well, well; I'll give you satisfaction. I'll let you throw me over the  fence any time you want to, and I won't make a particle of resistance.\"    Somehow this proposal did not strike the blacksmith as satisfactory. He  asked abruptly: \"Where's the boy?\"    \"There were two boys.\"    \"I mean the stout, broad-shouldered boy.\"    \"I don't know just where he is at present.\"    \"Do you know why I've come here this evening?\"    \"To see the show, I expect.\"    \"I've come to get that boy. I've no doubt he's somewhere about here.\"    \"Oho!\" thought the giant; \"I must put my young friend on his guard.\"    \"If you'll help me I'll do as much for you some time.\"    \"So you are going to carry him back with you?\" went on Achilles,  desirous of learning the extent of Kit's danger.    \"Yes, I am.\"    \"You say he is your apprentice?\"    \"Of course he is.\"    \"And you've got the papers to show for it?\"    \"I don't need no papers. I've got his uncle's consent.\"    \"I think, my friend, you're not familiar with the law,\" thought  Achilles. \"Kit won't go with you to-night.\"    But it was nearly time for the performance. Mr. and Mrs. Bickford left  the smaller tent, and entering the big one took their seats. They  watched the performance with great wonder and enjoyment till the  entrance of Kit and the Vincenti brothers. They did not immediately  discover him, but when he stood on the shoulders of Alonzo Vincenti,  who, in turn, stood on the shoulders of Antonio, and the three-storied  acrobat walked round the ring, Mrs. Bickford recognized Kit, and,  pointing with her parasol to the young acrobat, as she half raised  herself from her seat, she exclaimed in a shrill voice: \"Look, Aaron,  there's your boy, all rigged out in circus clothes!\"    \"Well, that beats all!\" ejaculated the blacksmith, gazing with wide open  mouth at Kit.    Just then, Kit, reversing his attitude, raised his feet in the air and  was borne round the ring, amid the plaudits of the spectators.    \"How do you think he does it?\" asked Mrs. Bickford in astonishment.    \"I give it up,\" said the blacksmith.    \"He's a smart critter. Do you think they pay him?\"    \"I reckon he gets two or three dollars a week, but he hain't no business  to hire out to the circus folks. He's going back with us to-night, and  I'll turn him out a blacksmith in two years.\"    When Kit had finished his act, he went to the dressing room and changed  his clothes.    \"I wonder whether the old fellow is after me!\" he thought. \"What could  have put it into his head that I was here?\"    As he emerged from the dressing room he met Mr. Barlow, the proprietor  of the circus, who advanced towards him, and shook his hand cordially.    \"Bravo, my young friend!\" he said. \"You did yourself great credit. Are  you sure you have never performed in a circus before?\"    \"Quite sure, sir.\"    \"You went through your act like an old professional. You did as well as  either of the other two.\"    \"Thank you, sir. I am glad you are satisfied.\"    \"I ought to be. I regard you as a decided acquisition to my show. Keep  on doing your best, and I can assure you that your efforts will be  appreciated. How much did I agree to pay you?\"    \"Ten dollars a week, sir.\"    \"That isn't enough. I raise your salary at once to twenty-five.\"    Kit was dazzled by his good fortune. What! Twenty-five dollars a week  and traveling expenses for a boy of sixteen! It seemed marvelous.    \"I am afraid I am dreaming, Mr. Barlow,\" he said. \"I can't believe that  I am really to receive so handsome a salary.\"    \"You will realize it to-night when you collect your first week's pay.\"    \"But this won't be a full week, sir.\"    \"Never mind! You shall receive full pay. Do you think I forget your  heroic act at Smyrna?\"    \"Thank you, sir. I hope nothing will prevent my continuing in your  employ.\"    \"What should prevent?\" asked Mr. Barlow, quickly. \"Have you had an offer  from another show?\"    \"No, sir; I am not well known enough for that; but I saw a man in the  audience who would probably like to get me away.\"    \"Who is it?\"    \"A blacksmith from Oakford.\"    \"I don't understand. What have you to do with a blacksmith?\"    Kit explained briefly.    \"When do you think he will try to recover possession of you?\" asked the  circus proprietor.    \"Just after the show is over.\"    \"Has he any papers?\"    \"Not one.\"    \"Then he has no claim on you. If he makes any trouble let me know.\"    \"I will, Mr. Barlow.\"          CHAPTER XVII.    KIT'S STRATAGEM.      Kit, when dressed, sought the part of the house where he knew that  William Morris was seated.    \"How did I do, Will?\" he asked.    \"Splendidly!\" answered the boy enthusiastically. \"I felt proud of you.\"    \"I think I have a right to be satisfied myself. I have had my pay  raised.\"    \"You don't mean to say you are to get more than ten dollars?\" said his  friend, opening his eyes in amazement.    \"I am raised to twenty-five.\"    \"You don't mean to say you are to get twenty-five dollars a week, Kit?\"    \"Yes, I do.\"    \"And your board?\"    \"And my board and traveling expenses,\" added Kit, with a smile.    \"I wish I were in your shoes, Kit,\" said William. \"Think of me with only  one dollar a week.\"    \"Would you be willing to go through my acts for the money I am going to  receive?\"    William shook his head.    \"I couldn't do it, Kit,\" he replied. \"It always makes me dizzy when I  have my head down. I don't believe I could ever do anything in a  circus.\"    \"Well, William, I won't forget you. If I save money, as I am sure to do,  I'll see if I can't do something for you by and by. By the way, did you  see Mr. and Mrs. Bickford?\"    \"No, you don't mean to say they are here?\"    \"Look over there!\"    William followed the direction of Kit's finger, and he easily discovered  the blacksmith and his wife.    \"By gracious! You're right!\" he said. \"It's the first money I've known  old Bickford to pay for any amusement for years.\"    \"They came after me, William.\"    \"You won't go back with them?\"    \"Not much. I don't care to give up twenty-five dollars a week for the  privilege of learning the trade of a blacksmith.\"    \"Suppose they try to carry you off?\"    \"That gives me an idea. With your help I'll try to play a trick on them.  It'll be capital fun.\"    \"Go ahead and tell me what it is, Kit. I'm with you!\"    \"My plan is that you should ride home with Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit.    \"I don't understand,\" said William, looking puzzled.    \"I'll tell you my idea. Bickford has come here with the intention of  taking me back with him to Oakford.\"    \"But you don't mean to go?\"    \"Of course not, but when the show is over I shall put myself in his way,  and after a little objection agree to go. I will ask for five minutes to  get ready. In that time I will change hats with you, and as it is dark  you can easily pass yourself off for me.\"    \"Capital!\" exclaimed William, laughing. \"Won't the old man look foolish  when he finds out who is with him?\"    \"Don't let him know till you arrive, or he would force you to leave the  carriage, and walk home alone, and a six mile walk is no joke.\"    \"All right Kit! I understand, and I think I can carry out your idea. I  haven't much love for the old man or his wife either, and I am glad of a  chance to get even with them.\"    The performance continued till ten o'clock. The blacksmith and his wife  enjoyed it beyond their anticipations. Amusements of any kind were new  to them, and their pleasure was like that of children.    \"I begin to think, Sarah, we shall get our money's worth,\" said Aaron  cautiously, as the entertainment neared its end; \"this is a great show.\"    \"So it is, Aaron. I don't begrudge the money myself, though fifty cents  is a pretty high price to pay. Then, besides, you'll have a chance to  carry the boy home.\"    \"That's so, Sarah. Just as soon as the show is over, foller me, and  we'll try to find him.\"    At length the last act was ended, and the crowd of spectators began  pouring from the tent.    Mr. Bickford hurriedly emerged from the audience, and began to look  around for Kit. He had but little trouble in finding him, for the boy  purposely put himself in his way. Aaron Bickford strode up to him.    \"Well, I've caught you at last!\" he said, putting his hand on the boy's  shoulder.    \"What do you want of me, Mr. Bickford?\" said Kit.    \"What do I want of you? Well, I want you to go home with me, of  course.\"    \"Won't you let me stay with the circus a week?\" asked Kit, in a subdued  tone.    \"No, I won't. I've got the wagon here, and I'm goin' to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22522"],[0,"Artists' Wives (#12)"],[1,"my hiding-place; then, very softly  without saying a word, while he was still looking at his statue, I  placed myself on the platform in front of him, in the costume and  attitude in which I had seen that abominable model. Ah my dear I What  emotion I felt when he raised his eyes! I could have laughed and  cried. I was blushing all over. And that tiresome muslin took so  much arranging. Never mind! Etienne was so delighted that I was soon  re-assured. Indeed, to hear him, my dear, you might suppose----.    [Illustration: p162-173]    [Illustration: p164-175]    [Illustration: p165-176]          A GREAT MAN'S WIDOW    No one was astonished at hearing she was going to marry again.  Notwithstanding all his genius, perhaps even on account of his genius,  the great man had for fifteen years led her a hard life, full of  caprices and mad freaks that had attracted the attention of all  Paris. On the high road to fame, over which he had so triumphantly and  hurriedly travelled, like those who are to die young, she had sat behind  him, humbly and timidly, in a corner of the chariot, ever fearful of  collisions. Whenever she complained, relatives, friends, every one was  against her: \"Respect his weaknesses,\" they would say to her, \"they are  the weaknesses of a god. Do not disturb him, do not worry him. Remember  that your husband does not belong exclusively to you. He belongs much  more to Art, to his country, than to his family. And who knows if  each of the faults you reproach him with has not given us some sublime  creation?\" At last, however, her patience was worn out, she rebelled,  became indignant and even unjust, so much indeed, that at the moment of  the great man's death, they were on the point of demanding a judicial  separation and ready to see their great and celebrated name dragged into  the columns of a society paper.    After the agitation of this unhappy match, the anxieties of the last  illness, and the sudden death which for a moment revived her former  affection, the first months of her widowhood acted on the young woman  like a healthy calming water-cure. The enforced retirement, the quiet  charm of mitigated sorrow, lent to her thirty-five years a second youth  almost as attractive as the first.    [Illustration: p167-178]    Moreover black suited her, and then she had the responsible and rather  proud look of a woman left alone in life, with all the weight of a great  name to carry honourably. Mindful of the fame of the departed one, that  wretched fame that had cost her so many tears, and now grew day by day,  like a magnificent flower nourished by the black earth of the tomb, she  was to be seen draped in her long sombre veils holding interviews with  theatrical managers and publishers, busying herself in getting her  husband's operas put again on the stage, superintending the printing of  his posthumous works and unfinished manuscripts, bestowing on all these  details a kind of solemn care and as it were the respect for a shrine.    It was at this moment that her second husband met her. He too was a  musician, almost unknown it is true, the author of a few waltzes  and songs, and of two little operas, of which the scores, charmingly  printed, were scarcely more played than sold. With a pleasant  countenance, a handsome fortune that he owed to his exceedingly  _bourgeois_ family, he had above all an infinite respect for genius,  a curiosity about famous men, and the ingenuous enthusiasm of a still  youthful artist. Thus when he met the wife of the great man, he was  dazzled and bewildered. It was as though the image of the glorious muse  herself had appeared to him. He at once fell in love, and as the widow  was beginning to receive a few friends, he had himself presented to her.  There his passion grew in the atmosphere of genius that still lingered  in all the corners of the drawing-room. There was the bust of the  master, the piano he composed on, his scores spread over all the  furniture, melodious even to look at, as though from between their  half-opened pages, the written phrases re-echoed musically. The actual  and very real charm of the widow surrounded by those austere memories as  by a frame that became her, brought his love to a climax.    [Illustration: p169-180]    After hesitating a long time, the poor fellow at last proposed, but  in such humble and timid terms! \"He knew how unworthy he was of her. He  understood all the regret she would feel, in exchanging her illustrious  name for his, so unknown and insignificant.\" And a thousand other  artless phrases in the same style. In reality, the lady was indeed very  much flattered by her conquest; however, she played the comedy of a  broken heart, and assumed the disdainful, wearied airs of a woman whose  life is ended without hopes of renewal. She, who had never in her life  been so quiet and comfortable as since the death of her great man, she  actually found tears with which to mourn for him, and an enthusiastic  ardour in speaking of him. This, of course, only inflamed her youthful  adorer the more and made him more eloquent and persuasive.    In short, this severe widowhood ended in a marriage; but the widow did  not abdicate, and remained--although married--more than ever the widow  of a great man; well knowing that herein lay, in the eyes of her second  husband, her real prestige. As she felt herself much older than he, to  prevent his perceiving it, she overwhelmed him with her disdain, with  a kind of vague pity, and unexpressed and offensive regret at her  condescending marriage. However, he was not wounded by it, quite the  contrary. He was so convinced of his inferiority and thought it so  natural that the memory of such a man should reign despotically in her  heart! In order the better to maintain in him this humble attitude, she  would at times read over with him the letters the great man had  written to her when he was courting her. This return towards the past  rejuvenated her some fifteen years, lent her the assurance of a handsome  and beloved woman, seen through all the wild love and delightful  exaggeration of written passion. That she had since then changed her  young husband cared little, loving her on the faith of another, and  drawing therefrom I know not what strange kind of vanity. It seemed  to him that these passionate appeals added to his own, and that he  inherited a whole past of love.    A strange couple indeed! It was in society, however, that they presented  the most curious spectacle. I sometimes caught sight of them at the  theatre. No one would have recognized the timid and shy young woman, who  formerly accompanied the _maestro_, lost in the gigantic shadow he cast  around him. Now, seated upright in the front of the box, she displayed  herself, attracting all eyes by the pride of her own glance. It might be  said that her head was surrounded by her first husband's halo of glory,  his name re-echoing around her like a homage or a reproach. The other  one, seated a little behind her, with the subservient physiognomy of one  ready for every abnegation in life, watched each of her movements, ready  to attend to her slightest wish.    At home, the peculiarity of their attitude was still more noticeable. I  remember a certain evening party they gave a year after their marriage.  The husband moved about among the crowd of guests, proud but rather  embarrassed at gathering together so many in his own house. The wife,  disdainful, melancholy, and very superior, was on that evening more than  ever the widow of a great man! She had a peculiar way of glancing at her  husband from over her shoulder, of calling him \"my poor dear friend,\" of  casting on him all the wearisome drudgery of the reception, with an air  of saying: \"You are only fit for that.\" Around her gathered a circle of  former friends, those who had been spectators of the brilliant debuts of  the great man, of his struggles, and his success. She simpered to them;  played the young girl! They had known her so young! Nearly all of  them called her by her Christian name, \"Anais.\" They formed a kind of  conaculum, which the poor husband respectfully approached, to hear his  predecessor spoken of. They recalled the glorious first nights, those  evenings on which nearly every battle was won, and the great man's  manias, his way of working; how, in order to summon up inspiration, he  insisted on his wife being by his side, decked out in full ball dress.  \"Do you remember, Anais?\" And Anais sighed and blushed.    It was at that time that he had written his most tender pieces, above  all _Savonarole_, the most passionate of his creations, with a grand  duet, interwoven with rays of moonshine, the perfume of roses and the  warbling of nightingales. An enthusiast sat down and played it on the  piano, amid a silence of attentive emotion. At the last note of the  magnificent piece, the lady burst into tears. \"I cannot help it,\" she  said, \"I have never been able to hear it without weeping.\" The great  man's old friends surrounded his unhappy widow with sympathetic  expressions, coming up to her one by one, like at a funereal ceremony,  to give a thrilling clasp to her hand. \"Come, come, Anais, be  courageous.\" And the drollest thing was to see the second husband,  standing by the side of his wife, deeply touched and affected, shaking  hands all round, and accepting, he too, his share of sympathy. \"What  genius! what genius!\" he repeated as he mopped his eyes. It was at the  same time ridiculous and affecting.    [Illustration: p174-185]    [Illustration: p177-188]          THE DECEIVER.
