Finally  Lutonya meets the counterpart of the well-known Irishman who, when  counting the party to which he belongs, always forgets to count  himself, and so gets into numerical difficulties. After which he  returns home.[65]    It would be easy to multiply examples of this style of humor--to  find in the folk-tales current all over Russia the equivalents of  our own facetious narratives about the wise men of Gotham, the old  woman whose petticoats were cut short by the pedlar whose name was  Stout, and a number of other inhabitants of Fool-land, to whom the  heart of childhood is still closely attached, and also of the  exaggeration-stories, the German _Luegenmaehrchen_, on which was founded  the narrative of Baron Munchausen's surprising adventures. But instead  of doing this, before passing on to the more important groups of the  Skazkas, I will quote, as this chapter's final illustrations of the  Russian story-teller's art, an \"animal story\" and a \"legend.\" Here is  the former:--        THE MIZGIR.[66]      In the olden years, long long ago, with the spring-tide fair and    the summer's heat there came on the world distress and shame.    For gnats and flies began to swarm, biting folks and letting    their warm blood flow.      Then the Spider[67] appeared, the hero bold, who, with waving    arms, weaved webs around the highways and byways in    which the gnats and flies were most to be found.      A ghastly Gadfly, coming that way, stumbled straight into    the Spider's snare. The Spider, tightly squeezing her throat,    prepared to put her out of the world. From the Spider the    Gadfly mercy sought.      \"Good father Spider! please not to kill me. I've ever so    many little ones. Without me they'll be orphans left, and from    door to door have to beg their bread and squabble with dogs.\"      Well, the Spider released her. Away she flew, and everywhere    humming and buzzing about, told the flies and gnats of    what had occurred.      \"Ho, ye gnats and flies! Meet here beneath this ash-tree's    roots. A spider has come, and, with waving of arms and weaving    of nets, has set his snares in all the ways to which the flies    and gnats resort. He'll catch them, every single one!\"      They flew to the spot; beneath the ash-tree's roots they hid,    and lay there as though they were dead. The Spider came,    and there he found a cricket, a beetle, and a bug.      \"O Cricket!\" he cried, \"upon this mound sit and take    snuff! Beetle, do thou beat a drum. And do thou crawl, O    Bug, the bun-like, beneath the ash, and spread abroad this news    of me, the Spider, the wrestler, the hero bold--that the Spider,    the wrestler, the hero bold, no longer in the world exists; that    they have sent him to Kazan; that in Kazan, upon a block,    they've chopped his head off, and the block destroyed.\"      On the mound sat the Cricket and took snuff. The Beetle    smote upon the drum. The Bug crawled in among the ash-tree's    roots, and cried:--      \"Why have ye fallen? Wherefore as in death do ye lie    here? Truly no longer lives the Spider, the wrestler, the hero    bold. They've sent him to Kazan and in Kazan they've chopped    his head off on a block, and afterwards destroyed the block.\"      The gnats and flies grew blithe and merry. Thrice they    crossed themselves, then out they flew--and straight into the    Spider's snares. Said he:--      \"But seldom do ye come! I would that ye would far more    often come to visit me! to quaff my wine and beer, and pay me    tribute!\"[68]    This story is specially interesting in the original, inasmuch as it  is rhymed throughout, although printed as prose. A kind of lilt is  perceptible in many of the Skazkas, and traces of rhyme are often to  be detected in them, but \"The Mizgir's\" mould is different from  theirs. Many stories also exist in an artificially versified form, but  their movement differs entirely from that of the naturally cadenced  periods of the ordinary Skazka, or of such rhymed prose as that of  \"The Mizgir.\"    The following legend is not altogether new in \"motive,\" but a certain  freshness is lent to it by its simple style, its unstrained humor, and  its genial tone.        THE SMITH AND THE DEMON.[69]      Once upon a time there was a Smith, and he had one son, a    sharp, smart, six-year-old boy. One day the old man went to    church, and as he stood before a picture of the Last Judgment    he saw a Demon painted there--such a terrible one!--black, with    horns and a tail.      \"O my!\" says he to himself. \"Suppose I get just such    another painted for the smithy.\" So he hired an artist, and    ordered him to paint on the door of the smithy exactly such    another demon as he had seen in the church. The artist painted    it. Thenceforward the old man, every time he entered the    smithy, always looked at the Demon and said, \"Good morning,    fellow-countryman!\" And then he would lay the fire in the    furnace and begin his work.      Well, the Smith lived in good accord with the Demon for    some ten years. Then he fell ill and died. His son succeeded    to his place as head of the household, and took the smithy into    his own hands. But he was not disposed to show attention to    the Demon as the old man had done. When he went into the    smithy in the morning, he never said \"Good morrow\" to him;    instead of offering him a kindly word, he took the biggest hammer    he had handy, and thumped the Demon with it three times    right on the forehead, and then he would go to his work. And    when one of God's holy days came round, he would go to church    and offer each saint a taper; but he would go up to the Demon    and spit in his face. Thus three years went by, he all the    while favoring the Evil One every morning either with a spitting    or with a hammering. The Demon endured it and endured it,    and at last found it past all endurance. It was too much for    him.      \"I've had quite enough of this insolence from him!\" thinks    he. \"Suppose I make use of a little diplomacy, and play him    some sort of a trick!\"      So the Demon took the form of a youth, and went to the    smithy.      \"Good day, uncle!\" says he.      \"Good day!\"      \"What should you say, uncle, to taking me as an apprentice?    At all events, I could carry fuel for you, and blow the    bellows.\"      The Smith liked the idea. \"Why shouldn't I?\" he replied.    \"Two are better than one.\"      The Demon began to learn his trade; at the end of a month    he knew more about smith's work than his master did himself,    was able to do everything that his master couldn't do. It was    a real pleasure to look at him! There's no describing how    satisfied his master was with him, how fond he got of him.    Sometimes the master didn't go into the smithy at all himself,    but trusted entirely to his journeyman, who had complete charge    of everything.      Well, it happened one day that the master was not at home,    and the journeyman was left all by himself in the smithy.    Presently he saw an old lady[70] driving along the street in her    carriage, whereupon he popped his head out of doors and began    shouting:--      \"Heigh, sirs! Be so good as to step in here! We've    opened a new business here; we turn old folks into young    ones.\"      Out of her carriage jumped the lady in a trice, and ran into    the smithy.      \"What's that you're bragging about? Do you mean to say    it's true? Can you really do it?\" she asked the youth.      \"We haven't got to learn our business!\" answered the    Demon. \"If I hadn't been able to do it, I wouldn't have invited    people to try.\"      \"And how much does it cost?\" asked the lady.      \"Five hundred roubles altogether.\"      \"Well, then, there's your money; make a young woman of    me.\"      The Demon took the money; then he sent the lady's coachman    into the village.      \"Go,\" says he, \"and bring me here two buckets full of    milk.\"      After that he took a pair of tongs, caught hold of the lady    by the feet, flung her into the furnace, and burnt her up; nothing    was left of her but her bare bones.      When the buckets of milk were brought, he emptied them    into a large tub, then he collected all the bones and flung them    into the milk. Just fancy! at the end of about three minutes    the lady emerged from the milk--alive, and young, and beautiful!      Well, she got into her carriage and drove home. There she    went straight to her husband, and he stared hard at her, but    didn't know she was his wife.      \"What are you staring at?\" says the lady. \"I'm young and    elegant, you see, and I don't want to have an old husband! Be    off at once to the smithy, and get them to make you young; if    you don't, I won't so much as acknowledge you!\"      There was no help for it; off set the seigneur. But by that    time the Smith had returned home, and had gone into the    smithy. He looked about; the journeyman wasn't to be seen.    He searched and searched, he enquired and enquired, never a    thing came of it; not even a trace of the youth could be found.    He took to his work by himself, and was hammering away,    when at that moment up drove the seigneur, and walked straight    into the smithy.      \"Make a young man of me,\" says he.      \"Are you in your right mind, Barin? How can one make a    young man of you?\"      \"Come, now! you know all about that.\"      \"I know nothing of the kind.\"      \"You lie, you scoundrel! Since you made my old woman    young, make me young too; otherwise, there will be no living    with her for me.\"      \"Why I haven't so much as seen your good lady.\"      \"Your journeyman saw her, and that's just the same thing.    If he knew how to do the job, surely you, an old hand, must    have learnt how to do it long ago. Come, now, set to work at    once. If you don't, it will be the worse for you. I'll have you    rubbed down with a birch-tree towel.\"      The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22381"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome (#12)"],[1,"floated on to Cythera, and was thence transported to the  island of Cyprus. Lightly she stepped on shore, and under the gentle  pressure of her delicate foot the dry and rigid sand became transformed  into a verdant meadow, where every varied shade of colour and every sweet  odour charmed the senses. The whole island of Cyprus became clothed with  verdure, and greeted this fairest of all created beings with a glad smile  of friendly welcome. Here she was received by the Seasons, who decked her  with garments of immortal fabric, encircling her fair brow with a wreath of  purest gold, whilst from her ears depended costly rings, and a glittering  chain embraced her swan-like throat. And now, arrayed in all the panoply of  her irresistible charms, the nymphs escort her to the dazzling halls of  Olympus, where she is received with ecstatic enthusiasm by the admiring  gods and goddesses. The gods all vied with each other in aspiring to the  honour of her hand, but Hephaestus became the envied possessor of this  lovely being, who, however, proved as faithless as she was beautiful, and  caused her husband much unhappiness, owing to the preference she showed at  various times for some of the other gods and also for mortal men.    [Illustration]    The celebrated Venus of Milo, now in the Louvre, is an exquisite statue of  this divinity. The head is beautifully formed; the rich waves of hair  descend on her rather low but broad forehead and are caught up gracefully  in a small knot at the back of the head; the expression of the face is most  bewitching, and bespeaks the perfect {61} joyousness of a happy nature  combined with the dignity of a goddess; the drapery falls in careless folds  from the waist downwards, and her whole attitude is the embodiment of all  that is graceful and lovely in womanhood. She is of medium height, and the  form is perfect in its symmetry and faultless proportions.    Aphrodite is also frequently represented in the act of confining her  dripping locks in a knot, whilst her attendant nymphs envelop her in a  gauzy veil.    The animals sacred to her were the dove, swan, swallow, and sparrow. Her  favourite plants were the myrtle, apple-tree, rose, and poppy.    The worship of Aphrodite is supposed to have been introduced into Greece  from Central Asia. There is no doubt that she was originally identical with  the famous Astarte, the Ashtoreth of the Bible, against whose idolatrous  worship and infamous rites the prophets of old hurled forth their sublime  and powerful anathemas.    VENUS.    The Venus of the Romans was identified with the Aphrodite of the Greeks.  The worship of this divinity was only established in Rome in comparatively  later times. Annual festivals, called Veneralia, were held in her honour,  and the month of April, when flowers and plants spring forth afresh, was  sacred to her. She was worshipped as Venus Cloacina (or the Purifier), and  as Venus Myrtea (or the myrtle goddess), an epithet derived from the  myrtle, the emblem of Love.    HELIOS (SOL).    The worship of Helios was introduced into Greece from Asia. According to  the earliest conceptions of the Greeks he was not only the sun-god, but  also the personification of life and all life-giving power, for light is  well known to be an indispensable condition of all healthy terrestrial  life. The worship of the sun was originally very widely spread, {62} not  only among the early Greeks themselves, but also among other primitive  nations. To us the sun is simply the orb of light, which, high above our  heads, performs each day the functions assigned to it by a mighty and  invisible Power; we can, therefore, form but a faint idea of the impression  which it produced upon the spirit of a people whose intellect was still in  its infancy, and who believed, with child-like simplicity, that every power  of nature was a divinity, which, according as its character was baleful or  beneficent, worked for the destruction or benefit of the human race.    Helios, who was the son of the Titans Hyperion and Theia, is described as  rising every morning in the east, preceded by his sister Eos (the Dawn),  who, with her rosy fingers, paints the tips of the mountains, and draws  aside that misty veil through which her brother is about to appear. When he  has burst forth in all the glorious light of day, Eos disappears, and  Helios now drives his flame-darting chariot along the accustomed track.  This chariot, which is of burnished gold, is drawn by four fire-breathing  steeds, behind which the young god stands erect with flashing eyes, his  head surrounded with rays, holding in one hand the reins of those fiery  coursers which in all hands save his are unmanageable. When towards evening  he descends the curve[26] in order to cool his burning forehead in the  waters of the deep sea, he is followed closely by his sister Selene (the  Moon), who is now prepared to take charge of the world, and illumine with  her silver crescent the dusky night. Helios meanwhile rests from his  labours, and, reclining softly on the cool fragrant couch prepared for him  by the sea-nymphs, recruits himself for another life-giving, joy-inspiring,  and beauteous day.    It may appear strange that, although the Greeks considered the earth to be  a flat circle, no explanation is given of the fact that Helios sinks down  in the far {63} west regularly every evening, and yet reappears as  regularly every morning in the east. Whether he was supposed to pass  through Tartarus, and thus regain the opposite extremity through the bowels  of the earth, or whether they thought he possessed any other means of  making this transit, there is not a line in either Homer or Hesiod to  prove. In later times, however, the poets invented the graceful fiction,  that when Helios had finished his course, and reached the western side of  the curve, a winged-boat, or cup, which had been made for him by Hephaestus,  awaited him there, and conveyed him rapidly, with his glorious equipage, to  the east, where he recommenced his bright and glowing career.    This divinity was invoked as a witness when a solemn oath was taken, as it  was believed that nothing escaped his all-seeing eye, and it was this fact  which enabled him to inform Demeter of the fate of her daughter, as already  related. He was supposed to possess flocks and herds in various localities,  which may possibly be intended to represent the days and nights of the  year, or the stars of heaven.    Helios is said to have loved Clytie, a daughter of Oceanus, who ardently  returned his affection; but in the course of time the fickle sun-god  transferred his devotion to Leucothea, the daughter of Orchamus, king of  the eastern countries, which so angered the forsaken Clytie that she  informed Orchamus of his daughter's attachment, and he punished her by  inhumanly burying her alive. Helios, overcome with grief, endeavoured, by  every means in his power, to recall her to life. At last, finding all his  efforts unavailing, he sprinkled her grave with heavenly nectar, and  immediately there sprang forth from the spot a shoot of frankincense, which  spread around its aromatic perfume.    The jealous Clytie gained nothing by her cruel conduct, for the sun-god  came to her no more. Inconsolable at his loss, she threw herself upon the  ground, and refused all sustenance. For nine long days she turned her face  towards the glorious god of day, as he moved along the {64} heavens, till  at length her limbs became rooted in the ground, and she was transformed  into a flower, which ever turns towards the sun.    Helios married Perse, daughter of Oceanus, and their children were, Aetes,  king of Colchis (celebrated in the legend of the Argonauts as the possessor  of the Golden Fleece), and Circe, the renowned sorceress.    Helios had another son named Phaethon, whose mother was Clymene, one of the  Oceanides. The youth was very beautiful, and a great favourite with  Aphrodite, who intrusted him with the care of one of her temples, which  flattering proof of her regard caused him to become vain and presumptuous.  His friend Epaphus, son of Zeus and Io, endeavoured to check his youthful  vanity by pretending to disbelieve his assertion that the sun-god was his  father. Phaethon, full of resentment, and eager to be able to refute the  calumny, hastened to his mother Clymene, and besought her to tell him  whether Helios was really his father. Moved by his entreaties, and at the  same time angry at the reproach of Epaphus, Clymene pointed to the glorious  sun, then shining down upon them, and assured her son that in that bright  orb he beheld the author of his being, adding that if he had still any  doubt, he might visit the radiant dwelling of the great god of light and  inquire for himself. Overjoyed at his mother's reassuring words, and  following the directions she gave him, Phaethon quickly wended his way to  his father's palace.    As he entered the palace of the sun-god the dazzling rays almost blinded  him, and prevented him from approaching the throne on which his father was  seated, surrounded by the Hours, Days, Months, Years, and Seasons. Helios,  who with his all-seeing eye had watched him from afar, removed his crown of  glittering rays, and bade him not to be afraid, but to draw near to his  father. Encouraged by this kind reception, Phaethon entreated him to bestow  upon him such a proof of his love, that all the world might be convinced  that he was indeed his son; whereupon Helios desired him to ask any favour  he pleased, {65} and swore by the Styx that it should be granted. The  impetuous youth immediately requested permission to drive the chariot of  the sun for one whole day. His father listened horror-struck to this  presumptuous demand, and by representing the many dangers which would beset  his path, endeavoured to dissuade him from so perilous an undertaking; but  his son, deaf to all advice, pressed his point with"]]]
