He was utterly  ignorant of the reason for this sudden hostility on the part of the  people of Machias. He knew nothing of the quarrel that had thus  provoked the rebellion of the colonies. Therefore, he sought to avoid  a conflict; and, upon the approach of the sloop, he hoisted his  anchor, and fled down the bay.    The sloop followed in hot haste. The Yankees crowded forward, and  shouted taunts and jeers at their more powerful enemy who thus strove  to avoid the conflict. Both vessels were under full sail; and the size  of the schooner was beginning to tell, when, in jibing, she carried  away her main boom. Nevertheless, she was so far ahead of the sloop  that she was able to put into Holmes Bay, and take a spar out of a  vessel lying there, before the sloop overtook her. But the delay  incident upon changing the spars brought the sloop within range; and  Capt. Moore, still anxious to avoid an encounter, cut away his boats,  and stood out to sea. With plenty of sea room, and with a spanking  breeze on the quarter, the sloop proved to be the better sailer. Moore  then prepared for battle, and, as the sloop overhauled him, let fly  one of his swivels, following it immediately with his whole broadside,  killing one man. The sloop returned the fire with her one piece of  ordnance, which was so well aimed as to kill the man at the helm of  the \"Margaretta,\" and clear her quarter-deck. The two vessels then  closed, and a hand-to-hand battle began, in which muskets,  hand-grenades, pikes, pitchforks, and cutlasses were used with deadly  effect. The colonists strove to board their enemy, but were repeatedly  beaten back. If any had thought that Capt. Moore's continued efforts  to avoid a conflict were signs of cowardice, they were quickly  undeceived; for that officer fought like a tiger, standing on the  quarter-deck rail, cheering on his men, and hurling hand-grenades down  upon his assailants, until a shot brought him down. The fall of their  captain disheartened the British; and the Americans quickly swarmed  over the sides of the \"Margaretta,\" and drove her crew below.    This victory was no mean achievement for the colonists. The  \"Margaretta\" was vastly the superior, both in metal and in the  strength of her crew. She was ably officered by trained and courageous  seamen; while the Yankees had no leaders save one Jeremiah O'Brien,  whom they had elected, by acclamation, captain. That the Americans had  so quickly brought their more powerful foe to terms, spoke volumes for  their pluck and determination. Nor were they content to rest with the  capture of the schooner. Transferring her armament to the sloop,  O'Brien set out in search of prizes, and soon fell in with, and  captured, two small British cruisers. These he took to Watertown,  where the Massachusetts Legislature was then in session. The news of  his victory was received with vast enthusiasm; and the Legislature  conferred upon him the rank of captain, and ordered him to set out on  another cruise, and particularly watch out for British vessels  bringing over provisions or munitions of war to the king's troops in  America.    But by this time Great Britain was aroused. The king saw all America  up in arms against his authority, and he determined to punish the  rebellious colonists. A naval expedition was therefore sent against  Falmouth, and that unfortunate town was given to the flames. The  Legislature of Massachusetts then passed a law granting commissions to  privateers, and directing the seizure of British ships. Thereafter the  hostilities on the ocean, which had been previously unauthorized and  somewhat piratical, had the stamp of legislative authority.    Petty hostilities along the coast were very active during the first  few months of the war. The exploits of Capt. O'Brien stirred up seamen  from Maine to the Carolinas, and luckless indeed was the British  vessel that fell into their clutches. At Providence two armed American  vessels re-took a Yankee brig and sloop that had been captured by the  British. At Dartmouth a party of soldiers captured a British armed  brig. In addition to these exploits, the success of the American  privateers, which had got to sea in great numbers, added greatly to  the credit of the American cause.    The first order looking toward the establishment of a national navy  was given by Gen. Washington in the latter part of 1775. The  sagacious general, knowing that the British forces in Boston were  supplied with provisions and munitions of war by sea, conceived the  idea of fitting out some swift-sailing cruisers to intercept the  enemy's cruisers, and cut off their supplies. Accordingly, on his own  authority, he sent out Capt. Broughton with two armed schooners  belonging to the colony of Massachusetts. Broughton was ordered to  intercept two brigs bound for Quebec with military stores. This he  failed to do, but brought in ten other vessels. Congress, however,  directed the release of the captured ships, as it was then intended  only to take such vessels as were actually employed in the king's  service.    By this time Congress had become convinced that some naval force was  absolutely essential to the success of the American cause. In October,  1775, it therefore fitted out, and ordered to sea, a number of small  vessels. Of these the first to sail was the \"Lee,\" under command of  Capt. John Manly, whose honorable name, won in the opening years of  the Revolution, fairly entitles him to the station of the father of  the American navy.    With his swift cruiser, Manly patrolled the New England coast, and was  marvellously successful in capturing British storeships. Washington  wrote to Congress, \"I am in very great want of powder, lead, mortars,  and, indeed, most sorts of military stores.\" Hardly had the letter  been forwarded, when Manly appeared in port with a prize heavy laden  with just the goods for which the commander-in-chief had applied. A  queer coincidence is on record regarding these captured stores. Samuel  Tucker, an able Yankee seaman, later an officer in the American navy,  was on the docks at Liverpool as a transport was loading for America.  As he saw the great cases of guns and barrels of powder marked  \"Boston\" being lowered into the hold of the vessel, he said to a  friend who stood with him, \"I would walk barefoot one hundred miles,  if by that means these arms could only take the direction of  Cambridge.\" Three months later Tucker was in Washington's camp at  Cambridge, and there saw the very arms he had so coveted on the  Liverpool docks. They had been captured by Capt. Manly.    Manly's activity proved very harassing to the British, and the  sloop-of-war \"Falcon\" was sent out to capture the Yankee. She fell in  with the \"Lee\" near Gloucester, just as the latter was making for  that port with a merchant schooner in convoy. Manly, seeing that the  Englishman was too heavy for him, deserted his convoy and ran into the  port, where he anchored, out of reach of the sloop's guns. Capt.  Lindzee of the \"Falcon\" stopped to capture the abandoned schooner, and  then taking his vessel to the mouth of the port, anchored her in such  a way as to prevent any escape for the \"Lee.\" He then prepared to  capture the Yankee by boarding. The \"Falcon\" drew too much water to  run alongside the \"Lee\" at the anchorage Manly had chosen; and the  Englishman therefore put his men in large barges, and with a force of  about forty men set out to capture the schooner. Manly saw the force  that was to be brought against him, and sent his men to quarters,  preparing for a desperate resistance. The schooner was lying near the  shore; and the townspeople and militia gathered by the water-side,  with guns in their hands, prepared to lend their aid to the brave  defenders of the \"Lee.\" As the three barges drew near the schooner,  Manly mounted the rail, and hailed them, warning them to keep off lest  he fire upon them.    \"Fire, and be hanged to you,\" was the response of the lieutenant in  command of the assailants. \"We have no fear of traitors.\"    So saying, the British pressed on through a fierce storm of musketry  from the deck of the schooner and from the shore. They showed no lack  of courage. The lieutenant himself brought his boat under the cabin  windows, and was in the act of boarding, when a shot from the shore  struck him in the thigh, and he was carried back to the man-of-war.  Capt. Lindzee, who had watched the progress of the fight from the deck  of the \"Falcon,\" was greatly enraged when his lieutenant was thus  disabled; and he hastily despatched re-enforcements to the scene of  action, and directed the gunners on the \"Falcon\" to commence a  cannonade of the town.    \"Now,\" said he with an oath, \"my boys, we will aim at the Presbyterian  church. Well, my brave fellows, one shot more, and the house of God  will fall before you.\"    But the British were fairly outfought, and the outcome of the battle  was disastrous to them. A newspaper of the period, speaking of the  fight says, \"Under God, our little party at the water-side performed  wonders; for they soon made themselves masters of both the schooners,  the cutter, the two barges, the boat, and every man in them, and all  that pertained to them. In the action, which lasted several hours, we  have lost but one man; two others wounded,--one of whom is since dead,  the other very slightly wounded. We took of the man-of-war's men  thirty-five; several are wounded, and one since dead; twenty-four are  sent to headquarters. The remainder, being impressed from this and  neighboring towns, are permitted to return to their friends. This  morning Capt.

To whom?  To our next neighbours?  They are mad-folks.      BOSOLA.  Remove that noise.      DUCHESS.                     Farewell, Cariola.    In my last will I have not much to give:    A many hungry guests have fed upon me;    Thine will be a poor reversion.      CARIOLA.                         I will die with her.      DUCHESS.
