I now proceed to  notice some of the English monastic libraries of the middle ages, and by  early records and old manuscripts inquire into their extent, and revel  for a time among the bibliomaniacs of the cloisters. On the spot where  Christianity--more than twelve hundred years ago--first obtained a  permanent footing in Britain, stands the proud metropolitan cathedral of  Canterbury--a venerable and lasting monument of ancient piety and monkish  zeal. St. Augustine, who brought over the glad tidings of the Christian  faith in the year 596, founded that noble structure on the remains of a  church which Roman Christians in remote times had built there. To write  the literary history of its old monastery would spread over more pages  than this volume contains, so many learned and bookish abbots are  mentioned in its monkish annals. Such, however, is beyond the scope of my  present design, and I have only to turn over those ancient chronicles to  find how the love of books flourished in monkish days; so that, whilst I  may here and there pass unnoticed some ingenious author, or only casually  remark upon his talents, all that relate to libraries or book-collecting,  to bibliophiles or scribes, I shall carefully record; and, I think, from  the notes now lying before me, and which I am about to arrange in  something like order, the reader will form a very different idea of  monkish libraries than he previously entertained.    The name that first attracts our attention in the early history of  Canterbury Church is that of Theodore of Tarsus, the father of  Anglo-Saxon literature, and certainly the first who introduced  bibliomania into this island; for when he came on his mission from Rome  in the year 668 he brought with him an extensive library, containing many  Greek and Latin authors, in a knowledge of which he was thoroughly  initiated. Bede tells us that he was well skilled in metrical art,  astronomy, arithmetic, church music, and the Greek and Latin  languages.[88] At his death[89] the library of Christ Church Monastery  was enriched by his valuable books, and in the time of old Lambarde some  of them still remained. He says, in his quaint way, \"The Reverend Father  Mathew, nowe Archbishop of Canterburie, whose care for the conservation  of learned monuments can never be sufficiently commended, shewed me, not  long since, the Psalter of David, and sundrie homilies in Greek; Homer  also and some other Greeke authors beautifully wrytten on thicke paper,  with the name of this Theodore prefixed in the fronte, to whose librarie  he reasonably thought, being thereto led by shew of great antiquitie that  they sometimes belonged.\"[90]    Tatwine was a great book lover, if not a bibliomaniac. \"He was renowned  for religious wisdom, and notably learned in Sacred Writ.\"[91] If he  wrote the many pieces attributed to him, his pen must have been prolific  and his reading curious and diversified. He is said to have composed on  profane and sacred subjects, but his works were unfortunately destroyed  by the Danish invaders, and a book of poems and one of enigmas are all  that have escaped their ravages. The latter work, preserved in our  National Library, contains many curious hints, illustrative of the  manners of those remote days.[92]    Nothelm, or the Bold Helm, succeeded this interesting author; he was a  learned and pious priest of London. The bibliomaniac will somewhat envy  the avocation of this worthy monk whilst searching over the rich  treasures of the Roman archives, from whence he gleaned much valuable  information to aid Bede in compiling his history of the English  Church.[93] Not only was he an industrious scribe but also a talented  author, if we are to believe Pits, who ascribes to him several works,  with a Life of St. Augustine.[94]    It is well known that St. Dunstan was an ingenious scribe, and so  passionately fond of books, that we may unhesitatingly proclaim him a  bibliomaniac. He was a native of Wessex, and resided with his father near  Glastonbury Abbey, which holy spot many a legendary tale rendered dear to  his youthful heart. He entered the Abbey, and devoted his whole time to  reading the wondrous lives and miracles of ascetic men till his mind  became excited to a state of insanity by the many marvels and prodigies  which they unfolded; so that he acquired among the simple monks the  reputation of one holding constant and familiar intercourse with the  beings of another world. On his presentation to the king, which was  effected by the influence of his uncle Athelm, Archbishop of Canterbury,  he soon became a great favorite, but excited so much jealousy there, that  evil reports were industriously spread respecting him. He was accused of  practising magical arts and intriguing with the devil. This induced him  to retire again into the seclusion of a monastic cell, which he  constructed so low that he could scarcely stand upright in it. It was  large enough, however, to hold his forge and other apparatus, for he was  a proficient worker in metals, and made ornaments, and bells for his  church. He was very fond of music, and played with exquisite skill upon  the harp.[95] But what is more to our purpose, his biographer tells us  that he was remarkably skilful in writing and illuminating, and  transcribed many books, adorning them with beautiful paintings, whilst in  this little cell.[96] One of them is preserved in the Bodleian Library at  Oxford. On the front is a painting of St. Dunstan kneeling before our  Saviour, and at the top is written \"_Pictura et Scriptura hujus pagine  subtas visi est de propria manu sei Dunstani_.\"[97] But in the midst of  these ingenious pursuits he did not forget to devote many hours to the  study of the Holy Scriptures, as also to the diligent transcription and  correction of copies of them,[98] and thus arming himself with the sacred  word, he was enabled to withstand the numerous temptations which  surrounded him. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21632"],[0,"Fame and Fortune; or, The Progress of Richard Hunter (#12)"],[1,"in _my_ wearing  it.\"    Roswell evidently thought it very inappropriate that Dick should wear a  handsome gold watch, more especially as he was quite sure beforehand  that his mother would not gratify his own desire to possess one. Still  he resolved to ask.    There was another thing he meant to ask. Feeling that his services were  worth more than the wages he received, and convincing himself that his  employers would be unwilling to lose him, he determined to ask an  advance of two dollars a week, making six dollars in all. Not that he  considered that even this would pay him, but as he could hardly hope  that he would be appreciated according to his deserts, he limited his  request to that sum. He concluded to defer making his application until  Saturday evening, when he would receive his week's wages.    He consulted his mother upon this subject, and she, having nearly as  high an opinion of her promising son as he had himself, consented to the  application. If his cousin, James Gilbert, had heard of his intention,  he was enough of a business man to have dissuaded him from the attempt.  Though he saw fit to espouse the cause of Roswell against Dick, it was  more because he disliked the latter than because he was blind to the  faults of the former. Indeed, he had a very moderate opinion of his  young cousin's capabilities.    The days slipped by, and Saturday night came. It was nine o'clock before  Roswell was released, the Saturday-night trade being the best of the  week. The other clerks had been paid, Roswell's turn coming last,  because he was the youngest.    The designation of the firm was HALL & TURNER. Mr. Hall, the  senior partner, usually went home early in the evening; and Mr. Turner,  the junior partner, a man of about thirty-five, attended to the evening  business, and paid the weekly wages.    \"Here, Crawford,\" he said, counting out four one dollar bills; \"it's  your turn now.\"    \"I want to speak to you for a moment, Mr. Turner,\" said Roswell,  beginning to feel a little nervous; for now that the time had come for  making his request, he felt a little uncertain how it would be received.    \"Very well,\" said his employer, showing a little surprise; \"be quick  about it, for I want to get through.\"    \"I want to know if you will not be willing to raise my wages,\" said  Roswell, rather awkwardly.    \"On what ground do you ask for it?\" said Mr. Turner, looking up.    \"I thought I might be worth more,\" said Roswell.    \"How long have you been in my employment,--do you remember?\"    \"About four months,\" said Roswell.    \"Do you think you have learned enough in that time to make you worth  more?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Roswell, with a little hesitation.    \"How much more would satisfy you?\"    \"Two dollars more,--for the present,\" said Roswell, beginning to feel a  little hopeful.    \"That is six dollars a week.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And how soon would you expect another advance?\" asked Mr. Turner,  quietly.    \"In about six months.\"    \"You are quite moderate in your demands, certainly.\"    There was something in Mr. Turner's tone which struck Roswell as  unfavorable, and he hastily said in his own justification:--    \"There's a friend of mine, no older than I am, who gets ten dollars a  week.\"    Certainly Roswell must have spoken inadvertently, or he would hardly  have referred to Dick as his friend; but his main idea at present was to  produce an impression upon the mind of Mr. Turner.    \"Is your friend in a dry goods store?\" asked Mr. Turner.    \"No, sir.\"    \"Then I don't see that his wages have any bearing upon your case. There  may be some special circumstances that affect his compensation. How long  has he been in the service of his present employer?\"    \"Only a week or two.\"    \"Is this his first place?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"It may be that he is some relative of his employer.\"    \"That isn't very likely,\" said Roswell, his lip curling. \"He used to be  a boot-black about the streets.\"    \"Indeed!\" said Mr. Turner, keenly. \"I think you said he was a friend of  yours.\"    \"No, sir,\" said Roswell, proudly; \"I haven't the honor.\"    \"You certainly said 'There's a friend of mine, no older than I am, who  gets ten dollars a week.'\"    \"I didn't mean to speak of him as my friend,\" said Roswell; \"I'm a  gentleman's son.\"    \"If you are, his friendship might do you no harm. If he receives the  wages you state, he must be a smart fellow. If he didn't earn as much,  probably he would not receive it.\"    \"I don't believe he'll keep his place long,\" muttered Roswell, his wish  being father to the thought.    \"If he doesn't, you may be able to succeed him,\" said Mr. Turner. \"I  shall be compelled to refuse your request. Indeed, so far from  increasing your compensation, I have been considering during the last  week whether it would not be for my interest to get another boy in your  place.\"    \"Sir!\" exclaimed Roswell, in dismay.    \"I will give you my reasons. You appear to think yourself of too great  consequence to discharge properly the duties of your position.\"    \"I don't understand you, sir,\" stammered Roswell.    \"I believe you claim to be a gentleman's son.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Roswell. \"My father used to keep a store on Broadway.\"    \"And I am led to suppose you think it incompatible with your dignity to  carry bundles to different parts of the city.\"    \"I would rather stand behind the counter and sell goods,\" said Roswell.    \"Of course you will be a salesman in time, if you stick to business  faithfully. But it so happens that we didn't hire you as a salesman, but  as a boy, whose chief business it should be to carry bundles. But we  don't want to impose a disagreeable duty upon you. Therefore, if you  think upon reflection that you would prefer not to continue in your  situation, we will hire somebody else.\"    \"That won't be necessary, sir,\" said Roswell, considerably crest-fallen.    \"You are content, then, to remain?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And upon four dollars a week?\"    \"Yes, sir. I suppose I may hope to have my wages increased some time?\"    \"When we find your services worth more, you shall receive more,\" said  Mr. Turner. \"That is fair,--isn't it?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then here is your money. I didn't mean to talk so long; but it's as  well to come to an understanding.\"    Roswell left the store considerably crest-fallen. He found that, instead  of regarding him worth an advance of wages, Mr. Turner had had it in his  mind to discharge him; and that hurt his pride. It was certainly very  singular that people shouldn't be more impressed with the fact that he  was a gentleman's son. He could not have received less deference if he  had been an ex-boot-black, like Dick himself. He certainly was no more  contented than before, nor was his self-appreciation materially  diminished. If the world did not recognize his claims, there was one  comfort, his mother appreciated him, and he appreciated himself. As to  his cousin, he did not feel quite so certain.    \"Why are you so late, Roswell?\" asked his mother, looking up from her  work as he entered. \"It seems to me they kept you later than usual at  the store, even for Saturday evening.\"    \"I'm sick of the store,\" said Roswell, impatiently.    \"What's the matter?\"    \"I asked old Turner to-night if he wouldn't raise my wages,\" said  Roswell.    \"Well, what did he say?\"    \"He said he wouldn't do it.\"    \"Did he give any reason?\"    \"He said I didn't earn any more. He's a stingy old hunks, any way, and I  wish I was in another place.\"    \"So do I; but it isn't so easy to get a new position. You had better  stay in this till another offers.\"    \"I hate carrying bundles through the streets. It isn't fit work for a  gentleman's son.\"    \"Ah, if your poor father had lived, things would have been very  different with us all!\" said Mrs. Crawford, with a sigh. She chose to  forget that previous to his death her late husband's habits had been  such that he contributed very little to the comfort or support of the  family.    \"I wouldn't care if I were a salesman,\" continued Roswell; \"but I don't  like being an errand boy. I'd just as lives go to the post-office for  letters, or to the bank with money, but, as for carrying big bundles of  calico under my arm, I don't like it. I was walking on Madison Avenue  the other day with a ten-pound bundle, when the boot-black came up,  dressed handsomely, with a gold watch and chain, and exulted over me for  carrying such a big bundle.\"    There was a little exaggeration about this, for Dick was very far from  exulting over Roswell, otherwise he certainly would not have volunteered  to carry the bundle himself. But it often happens that older persons  than Roswell are not above a little misrepresentation now and then.    \"He's an impudent fellow, then!\" said Mrs. Crawford, indignantly. \"Then  Mr. Hall won't raise your wages?\"    \"It wasn't Mr. Hall I asked. It was Mr. Turner,\" said Roswell.    \"Didn't he hold out any hopes of raising your wages hereafter?\"    \"He said he would raise them when I deserve it. He don't amount to much.  He's no gentleman,\" said Roswell, scornfully.    \"Who's no gentleman?\" inquired James Gilbert, who chanced just then to  enter the room.    \"Mr. Turner.\"    \"Who's Mr. Turner?\"    \"My employer,--Hall & Turner, you know.\"    \"What's amiss with him?\"    \"I asked him to raise my wages to-night, and he wouldn't.\"    \"Umph! How much did you ask for?\"    \"Two dollars more a week.\"    \"You're a fool!\"    \"_What!_\" said Roswell, astonished.    \"WHAT!\" exclaimed Mrs. Crawford, angrily.    \"I say the lad's a fool to ask for so large an advance so soon. Of  course his employers refused it. I would, in their place.\"    \"You're very hard upon the poor boy!\" said Mrs. Crawford. \"I thought you  were his friend.\"    \"So I am; but he's acted foolishly for all that. He should have known  better.\"    \"I ought to be worth six dollars, if your boot-black is worth ten,\"  responded Roswell.    \"He isn't worth ten."]]]
