Its simplicity is noteworthy. But Quivil required no elaborate  sepulture; the cathedral itself is his mighty monument, since it was he  who founded--        \"A fane more noble than the vestal trod--       The Christian's temple, to the Christian's God.\"[4]        [4] Richard Clarke Sewell, 1825, Magdalen College.    #St. Gabriel's Chapel.#--This chapel was transformed by Bishop  Bronscombe (1257-80). The vaulting has been recoloured in conformity  with the ancient tints and patterns. The chapel contained several  monuments, but these have been removed to other parts of the cathedral.  Bronscombe transformed the chapel that it might be used for his burial  place. St. Gabriel was his patron saint, and he caused the day of the  archangel to be celebrated with honours similar to Easter Day and  Christmas Day. There is some old glass in the windows. Note the kneeling  figure of the bishop with the scroll: \"O Sancte Gabriel Archangele,  intercede pro gratia.\" The skilful restoration of the south window with  pieces of old glass is one of the most happy results of later work in  the cathedral. The altar slab marked with five crosses, appears to have  been used in Leofric's monument, where it was found in the last century.  It was placed here by Dean Cowie.    #St. Mary Magdalen Chapel#, first mentioned in the Fabric Rolls for  1284. It was probably Marshall's work originally, Bronscombe further  improved it, and Quivil entirely remodelled it. With the exception of  the Perpendicular screen shutting it off from the north aisle, it is of  the same date as the Lady Chapel. The north window is Bronscombe's work,  and the still finer east window, containing a good deal of the early  fifteenth-century glass, is Quivil's. The chapel originally contained an  altar to St John the Evangelist and a figure of the Magdalene, for in  Bishop Lacy's register are the words, \"extra vestibulum coram ymagine  Sanctae Marie Magdalene.\" On the floor of the chapel is a brass to Canon  Langton, dated 1413. He was a cousin of Bishop Stafford. He is  represented kneeling, clothed in a most rich cope and alb, on which is  designed the Stafford knot. His hands are met in prayer. The epitaph  only gives the date of his death, and refers to his relationship with  the above-named bishop.    In this chapel also is a magnificent monument to Sir Gawain Carew and  his wife, and their nephew, Sir Peter. It is in two parts: on the upper  lie the figures of Sir Gawain and his dame, on the lower that of the  more famous nephew, with his legs crossed, an unusual position for a  figure on so late a tomb. Sir Peter and his uncle took an active part in  quashing the rebellion that disturbed the western counties in the reign  of Edward VI. The former died at Waterford, in Ireland, 1575. Sir Peter  Carew sat on the King's Commission of 1552, which summoned the Dean and  Chapter to the bishop's palace, \"then and there to answer all demands  and questions concerning the jewells plate and other ornaments of your  cathedrall churche.\"    In 1857 the monument was admirably restored by the members of the Carew  family, the whole being gilded and coloured.      TOMBS IN THE CHOIR AND CHOIR AISLES.    The first tomb to notice on the north side of the choir is that of the  murdered bishop, Stapledon. The canopy was judiciously restored at the  beginning of the century. From beneath it one observes a great image of  Christ, the pierced hands raised to bless. The wounded feet stand upon a  sphere, possibly to represent His dominion over the world, and an  insignificant earthly king, in scarlet robes, seems to take refuge in  the shadow of the Saviour. Beneath the canopy lies the figure of the  bishop, grasping the crozier in his left hand and a book in his right.  The keys upon his sleeve represent the arms of the see. Above the  monument the arms of the bishop figure on the choir screen, and over the  tombs of Lacy and Marshall the same plan has been observed. This screen  was erected about the close of the fourteenth century.    Below the sacrarium, on the north, are the tombs of the Elizabethan  bishop, William Bradbridge, and that of Bishop Lacy (1420-55). His arms,  \"Three shovellers heads erased,\" may be seen on the screen work above  it. The tomb is despoiled of the brass that once adorned it--said to  have been taken out by the Reformation Dean, Simon Hayes (who also  despoiled St. Radegunde's Chapel), because pilgrims resorted to Lacy's  tomb, and regarded him as a saint.    The next tomb, that of Marshall, is of peculiar interest, and it is  unfortunate that a good view is not easily attainable. It has been  pointed out by a specialist that the ornament on the chasuble is almost  unique, reminding one of the foliage in Early English work. The  medallions at the side are especially interesting.    At the west, near the Speke Chantry, is the remarkable monument,  generally supposed to be the tomb of Sir Richard de Stapledon, an elder  brother of the great bishop whose tragic death we have already described  in the first chapter of this book. He was a lawyer and one of his  Majesty's judges. Prince's quaint description of his tomb is worth  quoting in full: \"In a niche in the wall is a monument erected to his  Memory, representing his Figure lively cut in stone sitting on  horseback; where is cut out also in the same, a cripple taking hold of  the foreleg of his horse: which seems to confirm the Tradition, That a  certain Cripple, as Sir Richard was riding into the City of London with  his Brother, lying at the gate, laid hold on one of his Horse's  Fore-legs, and by crossing of it threw Horse and Rider to the Ground; by  which means he was soon slain; and that from this occasion the place  obtain'd the name of Cripple-gate, which it retains to this day.\" It is  a pity so quaint a story belongs to the realm of legend, for there is no  substantial proof forthcoming of its truth.    [Illustration: TOMB OF BISHOP STAPLEDON.]    The next monument on this side is an emaciated figure, or _Memento  Mori_, a gruesome style popular in the fifteenth century. It may have  been intended for a cenotaph of Bishop Bothe, the legend, nearly erased,  at the top, being the same as that on his brass in the church of East  Horsley, Surrey, where he is buried.    [Illustration: MONUMENT OF BISHOP MARSHALL                 (FROM BRITTON'S 'EXETER,' 1826).]    The monument to Anthony Harvey of Colomb John is of no great interest,  being poorly designed. Its date is 1564. Harvey was steward of the  abbeys of Hartland, Buckland, and Newenham at the time when the  religious houses were suppressed. He is said to have amassed very  considerable wealth; for, in addition to the profits derived from the  spoliation of the above monasteries, he received from Henry VIII  considerable lands belonging to the abbey of Tewkesbury, which he sold,  probably most advantageously, to a clothier of Crediton. Harvey was  connected with the Carews through the marriage of his daughter, and  heiress, with George Carew, Dean of Exeter, the notorious pluralist.  Their son, Harvey's grandson, was created Earl of Totnes, but died  without issue.    At the west end of the south aisle is the monument of Bishop Gary  (1621-26) and a mural tablet commemorating Robert Hall, eldest son of  Bishop Hall, and treasurer of the cathedral. To him Exeter owes a  perpetual debt of gratitude, for, when the city surrendered to Fairfax  in 1646, he took down the Bishop's Throne and concealed it (buried it  according to local tradition), and after the Restoration was able to  re-erect in its proper place the most magnificent Bishop's throne in  England.    Neither the effigy of Bishop Cotton (1621) nor the angel resting on the  sarcophagus of Bishop Weston--a typical Georgian monument--are of much  intrinsic merit. Flaxman's statue to General Simcox, the hero of the  Queen's Rangers in the American War, is the only other notable  monumental achievement in the south choir aisle.    The Peter, or Great Bell, of Exeter is said to have been a gift of  Bishop Courtenay's. This opinion is very much disputed, as the Fabric  Rolls show that there were bells here in the time of Edward II. As early  as 1351 is an entry of 6s. for mending the Peter Bell. Again in 1453,  twenty-five years before Courtenay was created bishop, mention is made  of the spending of twenty pence \"in una bauderick pro Maxima Campana in  Campanili Boreali.\" Oliver, however, acutely points out that this last  entry is dated the very year that Courtenay was appointed Archdeacon of  Exeter, and suggests that \"on that occasion he may have offered such  valuable presents.\" On the 5th November, 1611, the bell was crazed, but  was recast in 1676. Its reputed weight is 12,500 lb. If this is correct,  it is the second largest bell in England. Great Tom of Christ Church,  Oxford, is more than 5,000 lb. heavier, but it easily exceeds its other  rivals, Tom of Lincoln and the Great Bell of St. Paul's, which weigh  respectively 11,296 lb. and 8,400 lb.           *       *       *       *       *    #The Chapter House# lies at the south end of the transept beyond the  Chapel of the Holy Ghost. The lower part of the room is the original  building of the early thirteenth century, between 1224 and 1244, and the  face of the wall is decorated with Early English arcades separated by  delicate shafts. This building probably had a stone vaulted roof. Lacy  heightened it, adding lofty Perpendicular windows; and the whole is  completed by a rich tie-beam roof, partly the work of Bishop Bothe  (1465-78), whose arms, with Lacy's, are painted on it (see p. 13). The  east window, recently restored, contains many coats of arms in ancient  glass. Among these is the Austrian eagle quartered with the lion of  Bohemia, reminding us that Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother of Henry  III, and lord of Rougemont"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19449"],[0,"The North American Indian, Vol. 1 (#12)"],[1,"the east and sits down on  the head of the large figure in the centre of the dry-painting. As he does  so the medicine-man commences to sing, and is joined by the chorus at  once. They may sing the song four times, or sing four different songs, or  any multiple of four, at the pleasure of the medicine-man. When the songs  are finished the four masked personages scrape the colored earths into a  heap about the patient and rub them in handfuls over his body. If this  ceremony proves to be ineffectual, it is believed to be the will of the  gods that the patient be not cured.                        [Illustration: _Das Lan_ - Apache]                                _Das Lan_ - Apache                 _From Copyright Photograph 1907 by E.S. Curtis_          THE MESSIAH CRAZE      Among the Apache, in the spring of 1906, the excessive use of a combined  cross and crescent symbol was noted. Men, women, and children had this  anchor-like design cut into wood, tin, and metal talismans, and also  tattooed on their faces and branded on their horses. It was used also as a  decorative device in much of the new basketry and worked in beads on their  moccasins, and new shirts and waists seldom failed to display a cross in  narrow yellow and black ribbon in front.    Four years before this time a forceful old medicine-man living on the  Cibicu, in a remote corner of the Apache reservation, either through the  influence of a vision or other hallucination, or by a desire to become the  ruling spirit in the tribe, proclaimed the gospel of a messiah who, he  claimed, had appeared to him in the hills and would later return to the  deliverance of his tribespeople.    In childhood this future prophet was given the name Das Lan, Hanging Up,  by which designation he is commonly known in familiar discourse among his  tribesmen; but on the census rolls of the White Mountain agency he is  recorded simply as \"V-9.\" On becoming a medicine-man in his youth, in  accordance with tribal custom he adopted the name--what may be termed a  professional title--Doni Tli{~COMBINING BREVE~}shi Noiltansh, which signifies Turquoise  Rolling Stone.    As hitherto mentioned, the Apache is the personification of devoutness in  the performance of his religious duties, and no matter where circumstances  may place him, he manages always to have a small pouch of _hadintin_  carefully secreted about his person for use in paying his devotions to  half a score of gods, at least once every four days. If occasion demands,  he may pray every day, or four times a day, or any multiple of four times.  This custom has a direct bearing on the story of the messiah, which is  this:    Das Lan, in a spirit of more than usual devotion, began a series of  prayers to the gods of Life, Peace, and Plenty, delivered as usual just as  the sun appeared over the eastern mountains. On the fourth morning, with  offerings of _hadintin_, he invoked the benediction of Kuterastan, the  Creator, Hadintin Skhin, God of Health, Hadintin Nalin, Goddess of Crops,  and of Chuganaai himself, the All-seeing Sun. As the fourth pinch of  pollen wafted away on the breeze there appeared the vision, immediately  beneath the sun, of a small bearded dwarf, less than three feet in height,  who approached him, and said:    \"I am a messenger sent by Kuterastan to talk to you. The Sun is my father;  I have just left him to come to you. You are to inform all your people  that a change is about to be made in their lives and in the nature of the  whole world. In place of this life of strife and toil with little to eat,  all, the white man as well as the Indian, will be taken to a place where  all things grow without labor, and where there will be no rough, barren  mountains, but instead broad valleys filled with grass, trees, corn,  fruits, nuts, and all kinds of game in abundance. There, too, you will  meet all your fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters and children  who have gone before you from their homes, for they are now there. There  no sickness or death will visit anyone. The old and feeble will become  strong, the crooked straight, and the blind shall see. But to be taken,  all must have faith, believing as one, and observe these instructions I am  to leave with you. You are commissioned to instruct the people. Those who  believe must adopt the _daiita ilhnaha_, the cross and crescent, as a  symbol of faith, for it represents the shape the new world will have and  the road all must travel to reach it, and any who start on the journey  without using this sign will be lost on the way. When the time comes to  depart, I will return to lead you. A great cloud, open in the centre, will  come down from above and surround us all, so that none shall see whither  he goes. Until then those who would go must do as you bid them. All males,  boys or men, must have caps of deerskin with the _daiita ilhnaha_ marked  on them in beads on four sides, and two eagle feathers attached to the  top, ready to wear on the journey. They must also have new shirts,  leggings, and moccasins upon which this figure has been made in black and  white.                          [Illustration: Apache Village]                                  Apache Village                 _From Copyright Photograph 1906 by E.S. Curtis_      \"The girls and the women must likewise have new clothing, bearing the  sacred symbol, ever in readiness. All their water bottles, burden baskets,  and saddlebags must also bear the sign, and should any desire to ride  horses, only the best, fleet and strong, branded upon the left buttock  with the _daiita ilhnaha_, may be taken. The permanent homes of all people  living in bands under a chief must no longer be scattered, but must be  built close together in long rows, that no time may be lost in assembling  when our Great Father wills that you depart from this life to go to that  where all is peace and plenty. Until that time, which is not far off, you  must conduct yourselves as I have directed, discarding also all old  medicine symbols for the new.\"    The plain Greek cross and the crescent have been used by the Apache as  decorative and religious symbols from early times, but this recent  adaptation of the combined form came as a sudden wave.    With an unusually strong personality, Das Lan had long been held in fear  by those who knew him best, and with his story of the new messiah he soon  became of great prominence in the tribe. Das Lan first made confidants of  the leading spirits in the various bands, who in turn converted others to  the new faith before public announcement was made. Having won the  strongest men in the tribe through personal appeal to their vanity, the  crafty Das Lan could now remain at home, enjoying the prosperous practice  that grew out of his new cult.    Throughout the reservation those most deeply affected by the messiah  belief have been appointed spies over the others. If any persist in the  use of old medicine paraphernalia, they are reported at once and harassed  by threats of plague, sickness, ill-luck, disaster, and even death, which  Das Lan claims to be able to cause or to dispel at pleasure. Once the  threat is made, nothing unwelcome can happen to one under the ban that is  not immediately attributed, by all the medicine-man's disciples, to the  disfavor of the gods; and nothing more potent is necessary to convert the  unbeliever, for there is no Indian reared in the wilds who is not steeped  in the belief that his gods are all-powerful in both causing and  eradicating every ill.    About two years ago, on the Cibicu, a woman murdered her husband. She did  not deny the act, but pleaded justification, alleging that her husband was  guilty of unfatherly conduct toward his daughter. The local authorities  were very sceptical of her defence, since the murdered man had always  borne an excellent reputation among both Indians and whites; but no  contradictory evidence could be adduced upon which to base an open trial,  so the matter became quieted. After time had cancelled the crime in the  mind of the guilty, it became known that the murder had been committed at  the instigation of the scheming Das Lan, who found the deceased an  obstacle to his prophetic assumptions, and under the guise of an order  from Kuterastan had him despatched. Naturally fierce, strong, and bold,  Das Lan has become more emboldened by his success as a prophet, and  indirect threats of further crafty murders are sometimes uttered by the  more fanatical members in each band when anyone presumes to defy his creed  and will.    In 1903, throughout the White Mountain reservation, the Government farmers  found it difficult to persuade the Apache to plant the usual corn. The  following winter found them with a scant food supply, and Government aid  was neccessary to relieve suffering. The cause of the failure to plant,  none of the officials then knew; but to his tribesmen Das Lan had  prophesied the probable advent of the messiah at that time--so why plant  corn?    Another effect of Das Lan's prophecy is noted in the fact that although a  few years ago the Apache houses were scattered far and wide, now there are  many villages consisting of long straight rows of grass-thatched huts,  bearing testimony to that deep-seated superstition which in the Apache  apparently will never be eradicated.                       [Illustration: Sand Mosaic - Apache]                               Sand Mosaic - Apache                 _From Copyright Photograph 1907 by E.S.
