Lastly, there were two, hand in  hand; two so alike that it was impossible to distinguish one from  the other. Both smiled. The first said, 'I am love.' The other, 'I am  death.'\"    Thus speaking, he pressed Thais in his arms, and not noticing the  sullen look in her downcast eyes, he went on adding thought to thought,  heedless of the fact that they were all lost upon her.    \"Yes, when I had before my eyes the line in which it was written,  'Nothing should deter you from improving your mind,' I read, 'The kisses  of Thais are warmer than fire, and sweeter than honey.' That is how  a philosopher reads the books of other philosophers--and that is your  fault, you naughty child. It is true that, as long as we are what we  are, we shall never find anything but our own thoughts in the thoughts  of others, and that all of us are somewhat inclined to read books as I  have read this one.\"    She did not hear him; her soul was still before the Nubian's tomb. As he  heard her sigh, he kissed her on the neck, and said--    \"Do not be sad, my child. We are never happy in this world, except when  we forget the world.    \"Come, let us cheat life--it is sure to take its revenge. Come, let us  love!\"    But she pushed him away.    \"_We_ love!\" she cried bitterly. \"_You_ never loved any one. And _I_  do not love _you_! No! I do not love you! I hate you! Go! I hate you!  I curse and despise all who are happy, and all who are rich! Go! Go!  Goodness is only found amongst the unfortunate. When I was a child I  knew a black slave who died on the cross. He was good; he was filled  with love, and he knew the secret of life. You are not worthy to wash  his feet. Go! I never wish to see you again!\"    She threw herself on her face on the carpet, and passed the night  sobbing and weeping, and forming resolutions to live, in future, like  Saint Theodore, in poverty and humbleness.    The next day, she devoted herself again to those pleasures to which she  was addicted. As she knew that her beauty, though still intact, would  not last very long, she hastened to derive all the enjoyment and all the  fame she could from it. At the theatre, where she acted and studied more  than ever, she gave life to the imagination of sculptors, painters, and  poets. Recognising that there was in the attitudes, movements, and walk  of the actress, an idea of the divine harmony which rules the spheres,  wise men and philosophers considered that such perfect grace was  a virtue in itself, and said, \"Thais also is a geometrician!\" The  ignorant, the poor, the humble, and the timid before whom she consented  to appear, regarded her as a blessing from heaven. Yet she was sad  amidst all the praise she received, and dreaded death more than ever.  Nothing was able to set her mind at rest, not even her house and  gardens, which were celebrated, and a proverb throughout the city.    The gardens were planted with trees, brought at great expense from India  and Persia. They were watered by a running brook, and colonnades in  ruins, and imitation rocks, arranged by a skilful artist, were reflected  in a lake, which also mirrored the statues that stood round it. In the  middle of the garden was the Grotto of Nymphs, which owed its name to  three life-size figures of women, which stood on the threshold. They  were represented as divesting themselves of their garments, and about to  bathe. They anxiously turned their heads, fearing to be seen, and looked  as though they were alive. The only light which entered the building  came, tempered and iridescent, through thin sheets of water. All the  walls were hung--as in the sacred grottoes--with wreaths, garlands, and  votive pictures, in which the beauty of Thais was celebrated. There  were also tragic and comic masks, bright with colours; and paintings  representing theatrical scenes or grotesque figures, or fabulous  animals. On a stele in the centre stood a little ivory Eros of wonderful  antique workmanship. It was a gift from Nicias. In one of the bays was a  figure of a goat in black marble, with shining agate eyes. Six alabaster  kids crowded round its teats; but, raising its cloven hoofs and its ugly  head, it seemed impatient to climb the rocks. The floor was covered with  Byzantine carpets, pillows embroidered by the yellow men of Cathay, and  the skins of Libyan lions. Perfumed smoke arose from golden censers.  Flowering plants grew in large onyx vases. And at the far end, in the  purple shadow, gleamed the gold nails on the shell of a huge Indian  tortoise turned upside down, which served as the bed of the actress. It  was here that every day, to the murmur of the water, and amid perfumes  and flowers, Thais reclined softly, and conversed with her friends,  while awaiting the hour of supper, or meditated in solitude on  theatrical art, or on the flight of years.    On the afternoon after the games, Thais was reposing in the Grotto of  Nymphs. She had noticed in her mirror the first signs of the decay of  her beauty, and she was frightened to think that white hair and wrinkles  would at last come. She vainly tried to comfort herself with the  assurance that she could recover her fresh complexion by burning certain  herbs and pronouncing a few magic words. A pitiless voice cried, \"You  will grow old Thais; you will grow old.\" And a cold sweat of terror  bedewed her forehead. Then, on looking at herself again in the mirror  with infinite tenderness, she found that she was still beautiful and  worthy to be loved. She smiled to herself, and murmured, \"There is not a  woman in Alexandria who can rival me in suppleness or grace or movement,  or in splendour of arms, and the arms, my mirror, are the real chains of  love!\"    While she was thus thinking she saw an unknown man--thin, with burning  eyes and unkempt beard, and clad in a richly embroidered robe--standing  before her. She let fall her mirror, and uttered a cry of fright.    Paphnutius stood motionless, and seeing how beautiful she was, he  murmured this prayer from the bottom of his heart--    \"Grant, my God, that the face of this woman may not be a temptation, but  may prove salutary to Thy servant.\"    Then, forcing himself to speak, he said--    \"Thais, I live in a far country, and the fame of thy beauty has led me  to thee. It is said that thou art the most clever of actresses and the  most irresistible of women. That which is related of thy riches and thy  love affairs seems fabulous, and calls to mind the old story of Rhodope,  whose marvellous history is known by heart to all the boatmen on the  Nile. Therefore I was seized with a desire to know thee, and I see that  the truth surpasses the rumour. Thou art a thousand times more clever  and more beautiful than is reported. And now that I see thee, I say  to myself, 'It is impossible to approach her without staggering like a  drunken man.'\"    The words were feigned; but the monk, animated by pious zeal, uttered  them with real warmth. Thais gazed, without displeasure, at this strange  being who had frightened her. The rough, wild aspect, and the fiery  glances of his eyes, astonished her. She was curious to learn the state  of life of a man so different from all others she had met. She replied,  with gentle raillery--    \"You seem prompt to admire, stranger. Beware that my looks do not  consume you to the bones! Beware of loving me!\"    He said--    \"I love thee, O Thais! I love thee more than my life, and more than  myself. For thee I have quitted the desert; for thee my lips--vowed  to silence--have pronounced profane words; for thee I have seen what I  ought not to have seen, and heard what it was forbidden to me to hear;  for thee my soul is troubled, my heart is open, and the thoughts gush  out like the running springs at which the pigeons drink; for thee I  have walked day and night across sandy deserts teeming with reptiles and  vampires; for thee I have placed my bare foot on vipers and scorpions!  Yes, I love thee! I love thee, but not like those men who, burning with  the lusts of the flesh, come to thee like devouring wolves or furious  bulls. Thou art dear to them as is the gazelle to the lion. Their  ravening lusts will consume thee to the soul, O woman! I love thee in  spirit and in truth; I love thee in God, and for ever and ever; that  which is in my breast is named true zeal and divine charity. I promise  thee better things than drunkenness crowned with flowers or the dreams  of a brief night. I promise thee holy feasts and celestial suppers.  The happiness that I bring thee will never end; it is unheard-of, it  is ineffable, and such that if the happy of this world could only see a  shadow of it they would die of wonder.\"    Thais laughed mischievously.    \"Friend,\" she said, \"show me this wonderful love. Make haste! Long  speeches would be an insult to my beauty; let us not lose a moment. I am  impatient to taste the felicity you announce; but, to say the truth, I  fear that I shall always remain ignorant of it, and that all you have  promised me will vanish in words. It is easier to promise a great  happiness than to give it. Everyone has a talent of some sort. I fancy  that yours is to make long speeches. You speak of an unknown love. It  is so long since kisses were first exchanged that it would be very  extraordinary if there still remained secrets in love. On this subject  lovers know more than philosophers.\"    \"Do not jest, Thais. I bring thee the unknown love.\"    \"Friend, you come too late. I know every kind of love.\"    \"The love that I bring thee abounds with glory, whilst the loves that  thou knowest breed only shame.\"    Thais looked at him with an angry eye, a frown gathered on her beautiful  face.    \"You are very bold, stranger, to offend your hostess. Look at me, and  say if I resemble a creature crushed down with shame. No, I am not  ashamed, and all others who live like me are not ashamed either,  although they are not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781"],[0,"Heidi (#12)"],[1,"here.    But Clara shrieked: \"Oh, Miss Rottenmeier, you must wait till Papa  comes home, and then he can punish Heidi.\"    The lady unwillingly replied: \"All right, Clara, but I shall also  speak a few words to Mr. Sesemann.\" With those words she left the  room. Since the child's arrival everything had been upset, and the  lady often felt discouraged, though nothing remarkable happened for a  few days.    Clara, on the contrary, enjoyed her companion's society, for she  always did funny things. In her lesson she could never get her letters  straight. They meant absolutely nothing to her, except that they would  remind her of goats and eagles. The girls always spent their evenings  together, and Heidi would entertain her friend with tales of her  former life, till her longing grew so great that she added: \"I have to  go home now. I must go tomorrow.\"    Clara's soothing words and the prospect of more rolls for the  grandmother kept the child. Every day after dinner she was left alone  in her room for some hours. Thinking of the green fields at home, of  the sparkling flowers on the mountains, she would sit in a corner till  her desire for all those things became too great to bear. Her aunt had  clearly told her that she might return, if she wished to do so, so one  day she resolved to leave for the Alm-hut. In a great hurry she packed  the bread in the red shawl, and putting on her old straw hat, started  off. The poor child did not get very far. At the door she encountered  Miss Rottenmeier, who stared at Heidi in mute surprise.    \"What are you up to?\" she exploded. \"Haven't I forbidden you to run  away? You look like a vagabond!\"    \"I was only going home,\" whispered the frightened child.    \"What, you want to run away from this house? What would Mr. Sesemann  say? What is it that does not suit you here? Don't you get better  treatment than you deserve? Have you ever before had such food,  service and such a room? Answer!\"    \"No,\" was the reply.    \"Don't I know that?\" the furious lady proceeded. \"What a thankless  child you are, just idle and good-for-nothing!\"    But Heidi could not bear it any longer. She loudly wailed: \"Oh, I want  to go home. What will poor Snowhopper do without me? Grandmother is  waiting for me every day. Poor Thistlefinch gets blows if Peter gets  no cheese, and I must see the sun again when he says good-night to the  mountains. How the eagle would screech if he saw all the people here  in Frankfurt!\"    \"For mercy's sake, the child is crazy!\" exclaimed Miss Rottenmeier,  running up the stairs. In her hurry she had bumped into Sebastian,  who was just then coming down.    \"Bring the unlucky child up!\" she called to him, rubbing her head.    \"All right, many thanks,\" answered the butler, rubbing his head, too,  for he had encountered something far harder than she had.    When the butler came down, he saw Heidi standing near the door with  flaming eyes, trembling all over. Cheerfully he asked: \"What has  happened, little one? Do not take it to heart, and cheer up. She  nearly made a hole in my head just now, but we must not get  discouraged. Oh, no!--Come, up with you; she said so!\"    Heidi walked up-stairs very slowly. Seeing her so changed, Sebastian  said:    \"Don't give in! Don't be so sad! You have been so courageous till now;  I have never heard you cry yet. Come up now, and when the lady's away  we'll go and look at the kittens. They are running round like wild!\"    Nodding cheerlessly, the child disappeared in her room.    That night at supper Miss Rottenmeier watched Heidi constantly, but  nothing happened. The child sat as quiet as a mouse, hardly touching  her food, except the little roll.    Talking with the tutor next morning, Miss Rottenmeier told him her  fears about Heidi's mind. But the teacher had more serious troubles  still, for Heidi had not even learned her A,B,C in all this time.    Heidi was sorely in need of some clothes, so Clara had given her some.  Miss Rottenmeier was just busy arranging the child's wardrobe, when  she suddenly returned.    \"Adelheid,\" she said contemptuously, \"what do I find? A big pile of  bread in your wardrobe! I never heard the like. Yes, Clara, it is  true.\" Then, calling Tinette, she ordered her to take away the bread  and the old straw hat she had found.    \"No, don't! I must keep my hat! The bread is for grandmother,\" cried  Heidi in despair.    \"You stay here, while we take the rubbish away,\" said the lady  sternly.    Heidi threw herself down now on Clara's chair and sobbed as if her  heart would break.    \"Now I can't bring grandmother any rolls! Oh, they were for  grandmother!\" she lamented.    \"Heidi, don't cry any more,\" Clara begged. \"Listen! When you go home  some day, I am going to give you as many rolls as you had, and more.  They will be much softer and better than those stale ones you have  kept. Those were not fit to eat, Heidi. Stop now, please, and don't  cry any more!\"    Only after a long, long time did Heidi become quiet. When she had  heard Clara's promise, she cried: \"Are you really going to give me as  many as I had?\"    At supper, Heidi's eyes were swollen and it was still hard for her to  keep from crying. Sebastian made strange signs to her that she did not  understand. What did he mean?    Later, though, when she climbed into her high bed, she found her old  beloved straw hat hidden under her cover. So Sebastian had saved it  for her and had tried to tell her! She crushed it for joy, and  wrapping it in a handkerchief, she hid it in the furthest corner of  her wardrobe.          IX    THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HEARS OF STRANGE DOINGS      A few days afterwards there was great excitement in the Sesemann  residence, for the master of the house had just arrived. The servants  were taking upstairs one load after another, for Mr. Sesemann always  brought many lovely things home with him.    When he entered his daughter's room, Heidi shyly retreated into a  corner. He greeted Clara affectionately, and she was equally delighted  to see him, for she loved her father dearly. Then he called to Heidi:  \"Oh, there is our little Swiss girl. Come and give me your hand!  That's right. Are you good friends, my girls, tell me now? You don't  fight together, what?\"    \"Oh, no, Clara is always kind to me,\" Heidi replied.    \"Heidi has never even tried to fight, Papa,\" Clara quickly remarked.    \"That's good, I like to hear that,\" said the father rising. \"I must  get my dinner now, for I am hungry. I shall come back soon and show  you what I have brought home with me.\"    In the dining-room he found Miss Rottenmeier surveying the table with  a most tragic face. \"You do not look very happy at my arrival, Miss  Rottenmeier. What is the matter? Clara seems well enough,\" he said to  her.    \"Oh, Mr. Sesemann, we have been terribly disappointed,\" said the lady.    \"How do you mean?\" asked Mr. Sesemann, calmly sipping his wine.    \"We had decided, as you know, to have a companion for Clara. Knowing  as I did that you would wish me to get a noble, pure child, I thought  of this Swiss child, hoping she would go through life like a breath of  pure air, hardly touching the earth.\"    \"I think that even Swiss children are made to touch the earth,  otherwise they would have to have wings.\"    \"I think you understand what I mean. I have been terribly  disappointed, for this child has brought the most frightful animals  into the house. Mr. Candidate can tell you!\"    \"The child does not look very terrible. But what do you mean?\"    \"I cannot explain it, because she does not seem in her right mind at  times.\"    Mr. Sesemann was getting worried at last, when the tutor entered.    \"Oh, Mr. Candidate, I hope you will explain. Please take a cup of  coffee with me and tell me about my daughter's companion. Make it  short, if you please!\"    But this was impossible for Mr. Candidate, who had to greet Mr.  Sesemann first. Then he began to reassure his host about the child,  pointing out to him that her education had been neglected till then,  and so on. But poor Mr. Sesemann, unfortunately, did not get his  answer, and had to listen to very long-winded explanations of the  child's character. At last Mr. Sesemann got up, saying: \"Excuse me,  Mr. Candidate, but I must go over to Clara now.\"    He found the children in the study. Turning to Heidi, who had risen at  his approach, he said: \"Come, little one, get me--get me a glass of  water.\"    \"Fresh water?\"    \"Of course, fresh water,\" he replied. When Heidi had gone, he sat down  near Clara, holding her hand. \"Tell me, little Clara,\" he asked,  \"please tell me clearly what animals Heidi has brought into the house;  is she really not right in her mind?\"    Clara now began to relate to her father all the incidents with the  kittens and the turtle, and explained Heidi's speeches that had so  frightened the lady. Mr. Sesemann laughed heartily and asked Clara if  she wished Heidi to remain.    \"Of course, Papa. Since she is here, something amusing happens every  day; it used to be so dull, but now Heidi keeps me company.\"    \"Very good, very good, Clara; Oh! Here is your friend back again. Did  you get nice fresh water?\" asked Mr. Sesemann.    Heidi handed him the glass and said: \"Yes, fresh from the fountain.\"    \"You did not go to the fountain yourself, Heidi?\" said Clara.    \"Certainly, but I had to get it from far, there were so many people at  the first and at the second fountain. I had to go down another street  and there I got it. A gentleman with white hair sends his regards to  you, Mr. Sesemann.\"    Clara's father laughed and asked: \"Who was the gentleman?\"    \"When he passed by the fountain and saw me there with a glass, he  stood still and said: 'Please give me to drink, for you have a glass;  to whom are you bringing the water?' Then I said: 'I am bringing it to  Mr. Sesemann.' When he heard that he laughed very loud and gave me his  regards for you, with the wish that you would enjoy"]]]
