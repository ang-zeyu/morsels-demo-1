Aside from these, the chief departures from the enforced  uniformity of worship throughout the colony in the early years of the  eighteenth century were found in a few meetings of persecuted and  vilified Quakers and Baptists. The government and clergy had little  notion of the significance of a slender stream of Scotch-Irish  emigration which, as early as 1720, began to flow into the valley of the  Shenandoah. So cheap a defense against the perils that threatened from  the western frontier it would have been folly to discourage by odious  religious proscription. The reasonable anxiety of the clergy as to what  might come of this invasion of a sturdy and uncompromising Puritanism  struggled without permanent success against the obvious interest of the  commonwealth. The addition of this new and potent element to the  Christian population of the seaboard colonies was part of the  unrecognized preparation for the Great Awakening.

Neill, above referred to, in \"Hours at Home,\" vol. vi.          CHAPTER VI.    THE NEIGHBOR COLONIES TO VIRGINIA--MARYLAND AND THE CAROLINAS.      The chronological order would require us at this point to turn to the  Dutch settlements on the Hudson River; but the close relations of  Virginia with its neighbor colonies of Maryland and the Carolinas are a  reason for taking up the brief history of these settlements in advance  of their turn.    The occupation of Maryland dates from the year 1634. The period of bold  and half-desperate adventure in making plantations along the coast was  past. To men of sanguine temper and sufficient fortune and influence at  court, it was now a matter of very promising and not too risky  speculation. To George Calvert, Lord Baltimore, one of the most  interesting characters at the court of James I., the business had  peculiar fascination. He was in both the New England Company and the  Virginia Company, and after the charter of the latter was revoked he was  one of the Provisional Council for the government of Virginia. Nothing  daunted by the ill luck of these companies, he tried colonizing on his  account in 1620, in what was represented to him as the genial soil and  climate of Newfoundland. Sending good money after bad, he was glad to  get out of this venture at the end of nine years with a loss of thirty  thousand pounds. In 1629 he sent home his children, and with a lady and  servants and forty of his surviving colonists sailed for Jamestown,  where his reception at the hands of the council and of his old Oxford  fellow-student, Governor Pott, was not cordial. He could hardly have  expected that it would be. He was a recent convert to the Roman Catholic  Church, with a convert's zeal for proselyting, and he was of the court  party. Thus he was in antagonism to the Puritan colony both in politics  and in religion. A formidable disturbing element he and his company  would have been in the already unquiet community. The authorities of the  colony were equal to the emergency. In answer to his lordship's  announcement of his purpose \"to plant and dwell,\" they gave him welcome  to do so on the same terms with themselves, and proceeded to tender him  the oath of supremacy, the taking of which was flatly against his Roman  principles. Baltimore suggested a mitigated form of the oath, which he  was willing to take; but the authorities \"could not imagine that so much  latitude was left for them to decline from the prescribed form\"; and his  lordship sailed back to England, leaving in Virginia, in token of his  intention to return, his servants and \"his lady,\" who, by the way, was  not the lawful wife of this conscientious and religious gentleman.    Returned to London, he at once set in motion the powerful influences at  his command to secure a charter for a tract of land south of the James  River, and when this was defeated by the energetic opposition of the  friends of Virginia, he succeeded in securing a grant of land north and  east of the Potomac, with a charter bestowing on him and his heirs \"the  most ample rights and privileges ever conferred by a sovereign of  England.\"[55:1] The protest of Virginia that it was an invasion of the  former grant to that colony was unavailing. The free-handed generosity  with which the Stuarts were in the habit of giving away what did not  belong to them rarely allowed itself to be embarrassed by the fear of  giving the same thing twice over to different parties.    The first Lord Baltimore died three months before the charter of  Maryland received the great seal, but his son Cecilius took up the  business with energy and great liberality of investment. The cost of  fitting out the first emigration was estimated at not less than forty  thousand pounds. The company consisted of \"three hundred laboring men,  well provided in all things,\" headed by Leonard and George Calvert,  brothers of the lord proprietor, \"with very near twenty other gentlemen  of very good fashion.\" Two earnest Jesuit priests were quietly added to  the expedition as it passed the Isle of Wight, but in general it was a  Protestant emigration under Catholic patronage. It was stipulated in the  charter that all liege subjects of the English king might freely  transport themselves and their families to Maryland. To discriminate  against any religious body in England would have been for the proprietor  to limit his hope of rapid colonization and revenue and to embroil  himself with political enemies at home. His own and his father's  intimate acquaintance with failure in the planting of Virginia and of  Newfoundland had taught him what not to do in such enterprises. If the  proprietor meant to succeed (and he _did_ mean to) he was shut up  without alternative to the policy of impartial non-interference with  religious differences among his colonists, and the promotion of mutual  forbearance among sects. Lord Baltimore may not have been a profound  political philosopher nor a prophet of the coming era of religious  liberty, but he was an adroit courtier, like his father before him, and  he was a man of practical good sense engaged in an enormous land  speculation in which his whole fortune was embarked, and he was not in  the least disposed to allow his religious predilections to interfere  with business. Nothing would have brought speedier ruin to his  enterprise than to have it suspected, as his enemies were always ready  to allege, that it was governed in the interest of the Roman Catholic  Church. Such a suspicion he took the most effective means of averting.  He kept his promises to his colonists in this matter in good faith, and  had his reward in the notable prosperity of his colony.[57:1]    The two priests of the first Maryland company began their work with  characteristic earnestness and diligence. Finding no immediate access to  the Indians, they gave the more constant attention to their own  countrymen, both Catholic and Protestant, and were soon able to give  thanks that by God's blessing on their labors almost all the Protestants  of that year's arrival had been converted, besides many others. In 1640  the first-fruits of their mission work among the savages were gathered  in; the chief of an Indian village on the Potomac nearly opposite Mount  Vernon, and his wife and child, were baptized with solemn pomp, in  which the governor and secretary of the colony took part.    The first start of the Maryland colony was of a sort to give promise of  feuds and border strifes with the neighbor colony of Virginia, and the  promise was abundantly fulfilled. The conflict over boundary questions  came to bloody collisions by land and sea. It is needless to say that  religious differences were at once drawn into the dispute. The vigorous  proselytism of the Jesuit fathers, the only Christian ministers in the  colony, under the patronage of the lord proprietor was of course  reported to London by the Virginians; and in December, 1641, the House  of Commons, then on the brink of open rupture with the king, presented a  remonstrance to Charles at Hampton Court, complaining that he had  permitted \"another state, molded within this state, independent in  government, contrary in interest and affection, secretly corrupting the  ignorant or negligent professors of religion, and clearly uniting  themselves against such.\" Lord Baltimore, perceiving that his property  rights were coming into jeopardy, wrote to the too zealous priests,  warning them that they were under English law and were not to expect  from him \"any more or other privileges, exemptions, or immunities for  their lands, persons, or goods than is allowed by his Majesty or  officers to like persons in England.\" He annulled the grants of land  made to the missionaries by certain Indian "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20191"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Durham (#12)"],[1,"were furious, and the bishop vainly denied  any knowledge of the deed. He called a meeting at Gateshead. Here a  tremendous tumult arose, the mob crying, \"Good rede, short rede, slay ye  the bishop,\" and eventually setting fire to the church. The bishop was  eventually reduced to a choice of facing the mob or being burnt in the  church. He chose the former, and, covering his face with his robe, went  out. He was immediately slain on the threshold, and dreadfully  mutilated. His body was removed by the monks to Jarrow, and afterwards  to Durham, where he was buried.    #William of S. Carileph# (1080-1096) was next appointed bishop. He  was a man of great attainments. To him we owe the founding of the  present cathedral. Carileph also made an important change, by the  removal from Durham of the secular clergy, and their replacement by  Benedictine monks drawn from Jarrow and Monkwearmouth. The foundations  of the new church were laid on 29th July 1093, the Bishop and Prior  Turgot being present. He did not live to see it very far advanced, being  taken ill at Windsor. He died about Christmas 1096.    #Ranulph Flambard# (1099-1128).--The see was kept vacant for three  years by William Rufus, when he appointed Flambard, a great builder. He  built the nave and aisles, the west doorway and lower part of the  western towers, and vaulted the aisles. He also built Framwellgate  Bridge over the Wear at Durham, erected and endowed S. Giles' Church,  Durham, and was the founder of Norham Castle on the Tweed.    #Galfrid Rufus# (1133-1140) was his successor. His episcopate was  much disturbed by wars with the Scots. The chapter-house was finished  during his time of office.    #William de S. Barbara# (1143-1152) was next appointed. Extraordinary  events marked his election. William Cumin, chancellor of the Scottish  king, attempted to take the bishopric for himself, and succeeded so far  as to capture the castle with the aid of the Scots. The rightful bishop  was not able to gain possession for sixteen months after his election.  Cumin submitted in 1144.    [Illustration: The Crypt.]    #Hugh Pudsey# (1153-1195) now succeeded to the bishopric at the age  of twenty-five. He bought for life the earldom of Northumberland and the  manor of Sadberg. In 1187 the news of the capture of Jerusalem by the  Saracens spread consternation in the Church, and Pudsey prepared to  accompany King Henry to the East. He fitted out ships and galleys in a  most sumptuous manner, his own having a seat for himself of solid  silver. Neither he nor King Henry embarked in the crusade, however. The  king died, and Richard his son undertook the expedition, leaving Bishop  Pudsey and Longchamp, Bishop of Ely, as justiciaries for the northern  and southern portions of the kingdom respectively. These two  quarrelled, and Pudsey was decoyed to London by Longchamp, and committed  to the Tower. He soon obtained his release, but was compelled to resign  the earldom of Northumberland. In 1195 he undertook a journey to London  to see the king, and endeavour to obtain restitution of his honours and  possessions, but was taken ill, and died on the way, at Howden. His work  in the cathedral we have seen. He also built the great hall of the  castle, most of the beautiful Church of S. Cuthbert at Darlington, and  the Elvet Bridge over the Wear at Durham, and founded the hospital at  Sherburn, near Durham. Darlington Church, which would well repay a  visit, is a fine specimen of Early Pointed architecture, second only to  the Galilee of Durham, the two showing in a wonderful manner the rapid  development of the change which was taking place in architectural style  during Pudsey's time.    #Philip de Pictavia# (1197-1208), elected at the urgent request of  the king. He was continually at loggerheads with his clergy. He  supported King John against the Pope, and was for this excommunicated;  died in 1208, and was buried in unconsecrated ground. This bishop is  said to have had the permission of the king to coin money at Durham.    #Richard de Marisco# (1217-1226) was elected after an interval of  nearly ten years. The feud with the monks continued during his  episcopate, and the bishop swore the Church of Durham should have no  peace while he lived; threatened that if a monk should show himself  beyond his cloister he should lose his head; and once, when his servants  had beaten a monk, and the man complained, he replied that it was a pity  they did not kill him. He died at Peterborough in 1226.    #Richard le Poore# (1229-1237), who was the next bishop, elected  after the see had been vacant two years and four months, was translated  from Salisbury, where he had commenced building the new cathedral. He  ended the dispute between the monks and the Bishop of Durham by an  agreement known as \"Le Convenit.\"    #Nicholas de Farnham# (1241-1248) became bishop after a three years'  dispute with the king. He resigned in 1248.    #Walter de Kirkham# (1249-1260), Dean of York, was next elected.    #Robert de Stitchill# (1261-1274), Prior of Finchale, succeeded him.  Dissensions again arose between the bishop and the monks. He died on his  return from France, where he had attended a council at Lyons. He was  buried in a monastery in France, but his heart was brought to Durham,  and buried in the chapter-house.    #Robert de Insula# (1274-1283), a native of Holy Island, as his name  suggests, was then elected bishop. His tenure of office was peaceful.    [Illustration: Stone Coffin Lid.]    #Anthony Bek# (1283-1310). The next bishop was of noble birth, the  son of Walter Bek, Baron of Eresby, in Lincolnshire. He took part with  Edward I. in his expedition to Scotland, and, being very wealthy, was of  great assistance to the king. His following consisted of twenty-six  standard bearers, one hundred and forty knights, and an army of five  thousand foot and five hundred horse. He was employed by the king, with  success, in many important State matters. In the year 1300 trouble again  arose with the monks. Some of them being dissatisfied with the Prior  Hotoun, the bishop proposed to hold a visitation. The prior refusing to  admit him unless he came unattended, the bishop deposed and  excommunicated him. The convent took sides, some with the bishop and  some with the prior, and it was only on the interference of the king  that a partial peace was restored. The quarrel soon reopened. Some men  made a complaint against the bishop. He had compelled them to take arms  under him in the Scottish war, and had imprisoned some who had returned  without leave. The barons upheld the men, and it led to them taking  sides with Prior Hotoun in his dispute. The bishop, calling the monks  together, ordered them to elect a new prior, which they promptly refused  to do. On this the bishop appointed Henry de Luceby of Holy Island to be  prior of Durham, and brought men from Weardale and Tynedale to expel the  old prior. They laid siege to the convent, and for three days Prior  Hotoun and forty-six monks were shut up with only six loaves and sixteen  herrings. They continued the services however. On the third day a  Tynedale man was sent to pull the prior out of his stall, but was so  awed by his venerable appearance that he dared not touch him. A monk on  the bishop's side, however, did the work. Prior Luceby was installed,  and Prior Richard seized and imprisoned. He soon escaped, however, and  carried his complaint before Parliament, and afterwards to the Pope,  Boniface VIII. The Pope decided in his favour, and Hotoun returned to  Durham, and Luceby and his friends were obliged to go, though they  tried, when doing so, to carry off some silver plate and other  valuables. Bek continued in great splendour until his death in 1310.  When he died he was king of the Isle of Man, Patriarch of Jerusalem,  Bishop of Durham, and Prince Palatine.    #Richard de Kellaw# (1311-1316), formerly a monk of Durham, succeeded  Bek. He was a good and learned man, and lived in harmony with the monks.    #Louis de Beaumont# (1318-1333) was next appointed bishop, after  great competition and intrigue. He was chosen in opposition to the  wishes of the chapter, who had elected Stamford, Prior of Finchale, to  succeed Kellaw. On his way to Durham for consecration and enthronement,  accompanied by two cardinals and a large retinue, he was waylaid at  Rushyford by a band of ruffians under Gilbert Middleton. They plundered  the cardinals, but carried the bishop a prisoner to Mitford Castle. His  release was only secured on payment by the monastery of a heavy ransom.  He was an ignorant man, and so innocent of Latin that he could not read  his profession of obedience, being continually prompted. Later, at an  ordination, he stumbled over the words \"_in oenigmate_\" and cried in  French, \"_Par Seynt Lewis, il ne fuit pas curtays qui cest parole ici  escrit._\" \"By Saint Lewis he was no gentleman who wrote this word.\"    #Richard de Bury# (1333-1345), who succeeded, was a great scholar,  tutor to Edward III., and author of \"Philobiblon,\" a book still extant.  He was a good man, and very kind to the poor.    #Thomas de Hatfield# (1345-1381) was, like Bishop Bek, a warrior  ecclesiastic. Soon after his election he led eighty archers to the siege  of Calais. His episcopate was notable for the wars with the Scots, and  the great victory obtained over them, with the capture of King David and  many nobles, at Neville's Cross, near Durham. Fifteen thousand Scots  were slain. The victory was attributed to the presence of the sacred  banner of S. Cuthbert, which Prior John Fossor took to a place near the  battlefield, kneeling in prayer the while for success. A hymn of  thanksgiving was appointed to be sung on the top of the cathedral tower  on each anniversary of the battle. This custom is still carried out,  though the day has been changed to the twenty-ninth of May. Hatfield was  a liberal supporter of Durham College at Oxford."]]]
