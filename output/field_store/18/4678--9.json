A man-of-war came sailing into the harbour, and from her masthead  floated, not the fleur-de-lis, but the blood-red flag of England.  This  new-comer was Samuel Argall, a young English sea captain, a coarse,  passionate, and daring man, who had been some time associated with the  fortunes of Virginia.  In the spring of 1613 he set sail in a stout  vessel of 130 tons, carrying 14 guns and 60 men, for a cruise to the  coast of Maine for a supply of cod-fish, and whilst becalmed off  Monts-Deserts, some Indians came on board and informed him of the  presence of the French in the vicinity of that island.  He looked upon  the French as encroaching upon British territory, and in a few hours  had destroyed the infant settlement of St. Sauveur.  Saussaye was  perfectly paralysed, and attempted no defence when he saw that Argall  had hostile intentions; but the Jesuit Du Thet did his utmost to rally  the men to arms, and was the first to fall a victim.  Fifteen of the  prisoners, including Saussaye and Masse, were turned adrift in an open  boat; but fortunately, they managed to cross the bay and reach the  coast of Nova Scotia, where they met with some trading vessels  belonging to St. Malo.  Father Biard and the others were taken to  Virginia by Argall.  Biard subsequently reached England, and was  allowed to return home.  All the rest of the prisoners taken at St.  Sauveur also found their way to France.    But how prospered the fortunes of Poutrincourt {65} whilst the fate of  Port Royal was hanging in the scale?  As we have previously stated, he  had been put into prison by his creditors, and had there lain ill for  some months.  When he was at last liberated, and appeared once more  among his friends he succeeded in obtaining some assistance, and  fitting out a small vessel, with a limited supply of stores for his  colony.  In the spring of 1614 he entered the basin of Annapolis for  the last time, to find his son and followers wanderers in the woods,  and only piles of ashes marking the site of the buildings on which he  and his friends had expended so much time and money.  The fate of Port  Royal may be very briefly told.  The Governor of Virginia, Sir Thomas  Dale, was exceedingly irate when he heard of the encroachments of  France on what he considered to be British territory by right of prior  discovery--that of John Cabot--and immediately sent Argall, after his  return from St. Sauveur, on an expedition to the northward.  Argall  first touched at St. Sauveur, and completed the work of destruction,  and next stopped at St. Croix, where he also destroyed the deserted  buildings.  To such an extent did he show his enmity, that he even  erased the fleur-de-lis and the initial of De Monts and others from the  massive stone on which they had been carved.  Biencourt and nearly all  the inmates of the fort were absent some distance in the country, and  returned to see the English in complete possession.    The destruction of Port Royal by Argall ends the first period in the  history of Acadia as a French colony.  Poutrincourt bowed to the  relentless fate that {66} drove him from the shores he loved so well,  and returned to France, where he took employment in the service of the  king.  Two years later he was killed at the siege of Meri on the upper  Seine, during the civil war which followed the successful intrigues of  Marie de' Medici with Spain, to marry the boy king, Louis XIII., to  Anne of Austria, and his sister, the Princess Elisabeth, to a Spanish  prince.  On his tomb at St. Just, in Champagne, there was inscribed an  elaborate Latin epitaph, of which the following is a translation:            \"Ye people so dear to God,          inhabitants of New France,          whom I brought over to the    Faith of Christ.  I am Poutrincourt, your    great chief, in whom was once your hope.    If envy deceived you, mourn for me.    My courage destroyed me.  I could not          hand to another the glory          that I won among you.          Cease not to mourn for me.      Port Royal, in later years, arose from its ashes, and the fleur-de-lis,  or the red cross, floated from its walls, according as the French or  the English were the victors in the long struggle that ensued for the  possession of Acadia.  But before we continue the story of its varying  fortunes in later times, we must proceed to the banks of the St.  Lawrence, where the French had laid the foundation of Quebec and New  France in the great valley, while Poutrincourt was struggling vainly to  make a new home for himself and family by the side of the river of Port  Royal.        [1] Now known as Douchet Island; no relics remain of the French  occupation.    [2] Champlain says the river was named after a little fish caught  there, _de grandeur d'un esplan_.          {67}    VI.    SAMUEL CHAMPLAIN IN THE VALLEY OF THE ST. LAWRENCE.    (1608-1635.)    When Samuel Champlain entered the St. Lawrence River for the second  time, in 1608, after his three years' explorations in Acadia, and laid  the foundation of the present city of Quebec, the only Europeans on the  Atlantic coast of America were a few Spaniards at St. Augustine, and a  few Englishmen at Jamestown.  The first attempt of the English, under  the inspiration of the great Raleigh, to establish a colony in the fine  country to the north of Spanish Florida, then known as Virginia, is  only remembered for the mystery which must always surround the fate of  Virginia Dare and the little band of colonists who were left on the  island of Roanoke.  Adventurous Englishmen, Gosnold, Pring, and  Weymouth, had even explored the coast of the present United States as  far as the Kennebec before the voyages of Champlain and Poutrincourt,  and the first is said to have given the name of Cape {68} Cod to the  point named Malebarre by the French.  It was not, however, until 1607  that Captain Newport, representing the great company of Virginia, to  whom King James II. gave a charter covering the territory of an empire,  brought the first permanent English colony of one hundred persons up  the James River in Chesapeake Bay.    [Illustration: Champlain.]    From this time forward France and England became rivals in America.  In  the first years of the seventeenth century were laid the foundations  not only of the Old Dominion of Virginia, which was in later times to  form so important a state among the American commonwealths, but also of  the New Dominion whose history may be said to commence on the shores of  Port Royal.  But Acadia was not destined to be the great colony of  France--the centre of her imperial aspirations in America.  The story  of the French in Acadia, from the days of De Monts and Poutrincourt,  until the beginning of the eighteenth century when it became an English  possession, is at most only a series of relatively unimportant episodes  in the history of that scheme of conquest which was planned in the  eighteenth century in the palace of Versailles and in the old castle of  St. Louis on the heights of Quebec, whose interesting story I must now  tell.    When Champlain returned to France in 1607 De Monts obtained from Henry  the Fourth a monopoly of the Canadian fur-trade for a year, and  immediately fitted out two vessels, one of which was given to  Pontgrave, who had taken part in previous expeditions to the new world.  Champlain was appointed {70} by De Monts as his representative, and  practically held the position of lieutenant-governor under different  viceroys, with all necessary executive and judicial powers, from this  time until his death, twenty-seven years later.    Champlain arrived on the 3rd of July off the promontory of Quebec,  which has ever since borne the name given to it by the Algonquin  tribes, in whose language _Kebec_ means such a strait or narrowing of a  river as actually occurs at this part of the St. Lawrence.  The French  pioneers began at once to clear away the trees and dig cellars on an  accessible point of land which is now the site of Champlain market in  what is called \"the lower town\" of the modern city.  Champlain has left  us a sketch of the buildings he erected--_habitation_ as he calls  them--and my readers will get from the illustration opposite an idea of  the plan he followed.  Champlain made one of the buildings his  headquarters for twelve years, until he built a fort on the heights,  which was the beginning of that famous Fort and Castle of St. Louis to  which reference is so constantly made in the histories of New France.    Champlain was obliged immediately after his arrival at Quebec to punish  some conspirators who had agreed to murder him and hand over the  property of the post to the Basque fishermen frequenting Tadousac.  The  leader, Jean du Val, was hanged after a fair trial and three of his  accomplices sent to France, where they expiated their crime in the  galleys.  Great explorers had in those days to run such risks among  their followers and crews, not affected {71} by their own enthusiasm.  Only three years later a famous sailor and discoverer of new seas and  lands, was left to die among the waste of waters which ever since have  recalled the name of Henry Hudson.

[Illustration]          CHAPTER 10.    THE BRAIDED MAN OF PYRAMID MOUNTAIN      The mountain before them was shaped like a cone and was so tall that its  point was lost in the clouds. Directly facing the place where Jim had  stopped was an arched opening leading to a broad stairway. The stairs  were cut in the rock inside the mountain, and they were broad and not  very steep, because they circled around like a cork-screw, and at the  arched opening where the flight began the circle was quite big. At the  foot of the stairs was a sign reading:            WARNING.    These steps lead to the          Land of the Gargoyles.      DANGER! KEEP OUT.    \"I wonder how Jim is ever going to draw the buggy up so many stairs,\"  said Dorothy, gravely.    \"No trouble at all,\" declared the horse, with a contemptuous neigh.  \"Still, I don't care to drag any passengers. You'll all have to walk.\"    \"Suppose the stairs get steeper?\" suggested Zeb, doubtfully.    \"Then you'll have to boost the buggy-wheels, that's all,\" answered Jim.    \"We'll try it, anyway,\" said the Wizard. \"It's the only way to get out  of the Valley of Voe.\"    So they began to ascend the stairs, Dorothy and the Wizard first, Jim  next, drawing the buggy, and then Zeb to watch that nothing happened to  the harness.    The light was dim, and soon they mounted into total darkness, so that  the Wizard was obliged to get out his lanterns to light the way. But  this enabled them to proceed steadily until they came to a landing where  there was a rift in the side of the mountain that let in both light and  air. Looking through this opening they could see the Valley of Voe lying  far below them, the cottages seeming like toy houses from that distance.    After resting a few moments they resumed their climb, and still the  stairs were broad and low enough for Jim to draw the buggy easily after  him. The old horse panted a little, and had to stop often to get his  breath. At such times they were all glad to wait for him, for  continually climbing up stairs is sure to make one's legs ache.    They wound about, always going upward, for some time. The lights from  the lanterns dimly showed the way, but it was a gloomy journey, and they  were pleased when a broad streak of light ahead assured them they were  coming to a second landing.    Here one side of the mountain had a great hole in it, like the mouth of  a cavern, and the stairs stopped at the near edge of the floor and  commenced ascending again at the opposite edge.    The opening in the mountain was on the side opposite to the Valley of  Voe, and our travellers looked out upon a strange scene. Below them was  a vast space, at the bottom of which was a black sea with rolling  billows, through which little tongues of flame constantly shot up. Just  above them, and almost on a level with their platform, were banks of  rolling clouds which constantly shifted position and changed color. The  blues and greys were very beautiful, and Dorothy noticed that on the  cloud banks sat or reclined fleecy, shadowy forms of beautiful beings  who must have been the Cloud Fairies. Mortals who stand upon the earth  and look up at the sky cannot often distinguish these forms, but our  friends were now so near to the clouds that they observed the dainty  fairies very clearly.    \"Are they real?\" asked Zeb, in an awed voice.    \"Of course,\" replied Dorothy, softly. \"They are the Cloud Fairies.\"    \"They seem like open-work,\" remarked the boy, gazing intently. \"If I  should squeeze one, there wouldn't be anything left of it.\"    In the open space between the clouds and the black, bubbling sea far  beneath, could be seen an occasional strange bird winging its way  swiftly through the air. These birds were of enormous size, and reminded  Zeb of the rocs he had read about in the Arabian Nights. They had fierce  eyes and sharp talons and beaks, and the children hoped none of them  would venture into the cavern.    \"Well, I declare!\" suddenly exclaimed the little Wizard. \"What in the  world is this?\"    They turned around and found a man standing on the floor in the center  of the cave, who bowed very politely when he saw he had attracted their  attention. He was a very old man, bent nearly double; but the queerest  thing about him was his white hair and beard. These were so long that  they reached to his feet, and both the hair and the beard were  carefully plaited into many braids, and the end of each braid fastened  with a bow of colored ribbon.    \"Where did you come from?\" asked Dorothy, wonderingly.    \"No place at all,\" answered the man with the braids; \"that is, not  recently. Once I lived on top the earth, but for many years I have had  my factory in this spot--half way up Pyramid Mountain.\"    \"Are we only half way up?\" enquired the boy, in a discouraged tone.    \"I believe so, my lad,\" replied the braided man. \"But as I have never  been in either direction, down or up, since I arrived, I cannot be  positive whether it is exactly half way or not.\"    \"Have you a factory in this place?\" asked the Wizard, who had been  examining the strange personage carefully.    \"To be sure,\" said the other. \"I am a great inventor, you must know, and  I manufacture my products in this lonely spot.\"    \"What are your products?\" enquired the Wizard.    \"Well, I make Assorted Flutters for flags and bunting, and a superior  grade of Rustles for ladies' silk gowns.\"    \"I thought so,\" said the Wizard, with a sigh. \"May we examine some of  these articles?\"    [Illustration: THE CLOUD FAIRIES.]    [Illustration: THE BRAIDED MAN.]    \"Yes, indeed; come into my shop, please,\" and the braided man turned and  led the way into a smaller cave, where he evidently lived. Here, on a  broad shelf, were several card-board boxes of various sizes, each tied  with cotton cord.    \"This,\" said the man, taking up a box and handling it gently, \"contains  twelve dozen rustles--enough to last any lady a year. Will you buy it,  my dear?\" he asked, addressing Dorothy.    \"My gown isn't silk,\" she said, smiling.    \"Never mind. When you open the box the rustles will escape, whether you  are wearing a silk dress or not,\" said the man, seriously. Then he  picked up another box. \"In this,\" he continued, \"are many assorted  flutters. They are invaluable to make flags flutter on a still day, when  there is no wind. You, sir,\" turning to the Wizard, \"ought to have this  assortment. Once you have tried my goods I am sure you will never be  without them.\"    \"I have no money with me,\" said the Wizard, evasively.    \"I do not want money,\" returned the braided man, \"for I could not spend  it in this deserted place if I had it. But I would like very much a blue  hair-ribbon. You will notice my braids are tied with yellow, pink,  brown, red, green, white and black; but I have no blue ribbons.\"    \"I'll get you one!\" cried Dorothy, who was sorry for the poor man; so  she ran back to the buggy and took from her suit-case a pretty blue  ribbon. It did her good to see how the braided man's eyes sparkled when  he received this treasure.    \"You have made me very, very happy, my dear!\" he exclaimed; and then he  insisted on the Wizard taking the box of flutters and the little girl  accepting the box of rustles.    \"You may need them, some time,\" he said, \"and there is really no use in  my manufacturing these things unless somebody uses them.\"    \"Why did you leave the surface of the earth?\" enquired the Wizard.    \"I could not help it. It is a sad story, but if you will try to restrain  your tears I will tell you about it. On earth I was a manufacturer of  Imported Holes for American Swiss Cheese, and I will acknowledge that I  supplied a superior article, which was in great demand. Also I made  pores for porous plasters and high-grade holes for doughnuts and  buttons. Finally I invented a new Adjustable Post-hole, which I thought  would make my fortune. I manufactured a large quantity of these  post-holes, and having no room in which to store them I set them all end  to end and put the top one in the ground. That made an extraordinary  long hole, as you may imagine, and reached far down into the earth; and,  as I leaned over it to try to see to the bottom, I lost my balance and  tumbled in. Unfortunately, the hole led directly into the vast space you  see outside this mountain; but I managed to catch a point of rock that  projected from this cavern, and so saved myself from tumbling headlong  into the black waves beneath, where the tongues of flame that dart out  would certainly have consumed me. Here, then, I made my home; and  although it is a lonely place I amuse myself making rustles and  flutters, and so get along very nicely.\"    When the braided man had completed this strange tale Dorothy nearly  laughed, because it was all so absurd; but the Wizard tapped his  forehead significantly, to indicate that he thought the poor man was  crazy. So they politely bade him good day, and went back to the outer  cavern to resume their journey.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER 11.    THEY MEET THE WOODEN GARGOYLES      Another breathless climb brought our adventurers to a third landing  where there was a rift in the mountain. On peering out all they could  see was rolling banks of clouds, so thick that they obscured all else.    But the travellers were obliged to rest, and while they were sitting on  the rocky floor the Wizard felt in his pocket and brought out the nine  tiny piglets. To his delight they were now plainly visible, which proved  that they had passed beyond the influence of the magical Valley of Voe.    \"Why, we can see each other again!\" cried one, joyfully.    \"Yes,\" sighed Eureka; \"and I also can see you again, and the sight  makes me dreadfully hungry. Please, Mr. Wizard, may I eat just one of  the fat little piglets? You'd never miss _one_ of them, I'm sure!\"    \"What a horrid, savage beast!\" exclaimed a piglet; \"and"]]]
