He  had carefully shaved his cheeks and chin; his mustachio was trimmed and  curled; he had arched his eyebrows by plucking out with tweezers  the fine hairs around them; he had trained his curly musk-coloured  love-locks to hang gracefully down his face; he had drawn broad lines of  antimony along his eyelids, a most brilliant sectarian mark was affixed  to his forehead, the colour of his lips had been heightened by chewing  betel-nut--    \"One would imagine that you are talking of a silly girl, not of a  prince, fiend!\" interrupted Vikram, who did not wish his son to hear  what he called these fopperies and frivolities.    --and whitened his neck by having it shaved (continued the Baital,  speaking quickly, as if determined not to be interrupted), and reddened  the tips of his ears by squeezing them, and made his teeth shine by  rubbing copper powder into the roots, and set off the delicacy of his  fingers by staining the tips with henna. He had not been less careful  with his dress: he wore a well-arranged turband, which had taken him at  least two hours to bind, and a rich suit of brown stuff chosen for the  adventure he was about to attempt, and he hung about his person a number  of various weapons, so as to appear a hero--which young damsels admire.    Vajramukut asked his friend how he looked, and smiled happily when the  other replied \"Admirable!\" His happiness was so great that he feared  it might not last, and he asked the minister's son how best to conduct  himself?    \"As a conqueror, my prince!\" answered that astute young man, \"if it so  be that you would be one. When you wish to win a woman, always impose  upon her. Tell her that you are her master, and she will forthwith  believe herself to be your servant. Inform her that she loves you, and  forthwith she will adore you. Show her that you care nothing for her,  and she will think of nothing but you. Prove to her by your demeanour  that you consider her a slave, and she will become your pariah. But  above all things--excuse me if I repeat myself too often--beware of the  fatal virtue which men call modesty and women sheepishness. Recollect  the trouble it has given us, and the danger which we have incurred:  all this might have been managed at a tank within fifteen miles of your  royal father's palace. And allow me to say that you may still thank your  stars: in love a lost opportunity is seldom if ever recovered. The time  to woo a woman is the moment you meet her, before she has had time to  think; allow her the use of reflection and she may escape the net. And  after avoiding the rock of Modesty, fall not, I conjure you, into the  gulf of Security. I fear the lady Padmavati, she is too clever and too  prudent. When damsels of her age draw the sword of Love, they throw away  the scabbard of Precaution. But you yawn--I weary you--it is time for us  to move.\"    Two watches of the night had passed, and there was profound stillness on  earth. The young men then walked quietly through the shadows, till they  reached the western gate of the palace, and found the wicket ajar. The  minister's son peeped in and saw the porter dozing, stately as a Brahman  deep in the Vedas, and behind him stood a veiled woman seemingly waiting  for somebody. He then returned on tiptoe to the place where he had left  his master, and with a parting caution against modesty and security,  bade him fearlessly glide through the wicket. Then having stayed a short  time at the gate listening with anxious ear, he went back to the old  woman's house.    Vajramukut penetrating to the staircase, felt his hand grasped by the  veiled figure, who motioning him to tread lightly, led him quickly  forwards. They passed under several arches, through dim passages and  dark doorways, till at last running up a flight of stone steps they  reached the apartments of the princess.    Vajramukut was nearly fainting as the flood of splendour broke upon him.  Recovering himself he gazed around the rooms, and presently a tumult of  delight invaded his soul, and his body bristled with joy. [62] The scene  was that of fairyland. Golden censers exhaled the most costly perfumes,  and gemmed vases bore the most beautiful flowers; silver lamps  containing fragrant oil illuminated doors whose panels were wonderfully  decorated, and walls adorned with pictures in which such figures were  formed that on seeing them the beholder was enchanted. On one side of  the room stood a bed of flowers and a couch covered with brocade of  gold, and strewed with freshly-culled jasmine flowers. On the other  side, arranged in proper order, were attar holders, betel-boxes,  rose-water bottles, trays, and silver cases with four partitions for  essences compounded of rose leaves, sugar, and spices, prepared sandal  wood, saffron, and pods of musk. Scattered about a stuccoed floor white  as crystal, were coloured caddies of exquisite confections, and in  others sweetmeats of various kinds.[63] Female attendants clothed in  dresses of various colours were standing each according to her rank,  with hands respectfully joined. Some were reading plays and beautiful  poems, others danced and others performed with glittering fingers and  flashing arms on various instruments--the ivory lute, the ebony pipe  and the silver kettledrum. In short, all the means and appliances of  pleasure and enjoyment were there; and any description of the appearance  of the apartments, which were the wonder of the age, is impossible.    Then another veiled figure, the beautiful Princess Padmavati, came up  and disclosed herself, and dazzled the eyes of her delighted Vajramukut.  She led him into an alcove, made him sit down, rubbed sandal powder upon  his body, hung a garland of jasmine flowers round his neck, sprinkled  rose-water over his dress, and began to wave over his head a fan of  peacock feathers with a golden handle.    Said the prince, who despite all efforts could not entirely shake off  his unhappy habit of being modest, \"Those very delicate hands of yours  are not fit to ply the pankha.[64] Why do you take so much trouble? I  am cool and refreshed by the sight of you. Do give the fan to me and sit  down.\"    \"Nay, great king!\" replied Padmavati, with the most fascinating of  smiles, \"you have taken so much trouble for my sake in coming here, it  is right that I perform service for you.\"    Upon which her favourite slave, taking the pankha from the hand of the  princess, exclaimed, \"This is my duty. I will perform the service; do  you two enjoy yourselves!\"    The lovers then began to chew betel, which, by the bye, they disposed of  in little agate boxes which they drew from their pockets, and they were  soon engaged in the tenderest conversation.    Here the Baital paused for a while, probably to take breath. Then he  resumed his tale as follows:    In the meantime, it became dawn; the princess concealed him; and when  night returned they again engaged in the same innocent pleasures.  Thus day after day sped rapidly by. Imagine, if you can, the youth's  felicity; he was of an ardent temperament, deeply enamoured, barely  a score of years old, and he had been strictly brought up by serious  parents. He therefore resigned himself entirely to the siren for whom he  willingly forgot the world, and he wondered at his good fortune, which  had thrown in his way a conquest richer than all the mines of Meru.[65]  He could not sufficiently admire his Padmavati's grace, beauty, bright  wit, and numberless accomplishments. Every morning, for vanity's sake,  he learned from her a little useless knowledge in verse as well as  prose, for instance, the saying of the poet--         Enjoy the present hour, 'tis thine; be this, O man, thy law;       Who e'er resew the yester? Who the morrow e'er foresaw?    And this highly philosophical axiom--         Eat, drink, and love--the rest's not worth a fillip.    \"By means of which he hoped, Raja Vikram!\" said the demon, not heeding  his royal carrier's \"ughs\" and \"poohs,\" \"to become in course of time  almost as clever as his mistress.\"    Padmavati, being, as you have seen, a maiden of superior mind, was  naturally more smitten by her lover's dulness than by any other of his  qualities; she adored it, it was such a contrast to herself.[66] At  first she did what many clever women do--she invested him with the  brightness of her own imagination. Still water, she pondered, runs deep;  certainly under this disguise must lurk a brilliant fancy, a penetrating  but a mature and ready judgment--are they not written by nature's hand  on that broad high brow? With such lovely mustachios can he be aught but  generous, noble-minded, magnanimous? Can such eyes belong to any but a  hero? And she fed the delusion. She would smile upon him with intense  fondness, when, after wasting hours over a few lines of poetry, he  would misplace all the adjectives and barbarously entreat the metre.  She laughed with gratification, when, excited by the bright sayings that  fell from her lips, the youth put forth some platitude, dim as the lamp  in the expiring fire-fly. When he slipped in grammar she saw malice  under it, when he retailed a borrowed jest she called it a good one, and  when he used--as princes sometimes will--bad language, she discovered in  it a charming simplicity.    At first she suspected that the stratagems which had won her heart were  the results of a deep-laid plot proceeding from her lover. But clever  women are apt to be rarely sharp-sighted in every matter which concerns  themselves. She frequently determined that a third was in the secret.  She therefore made no allusion to it.

OF A PLURALITY OF WIVES OR HUSBANDS.    What has been said of divorce applies with tenfold force to the custom  of a woman living as wife to several men, or of a man as husband to  several women. We should not speak of these customs, but that we know  both exist in America, not among the notoriously wicked, but among those  who claim to be the peculiarly good--the very elect of God. They  prevail, not as lustful excesses, but as religious observances.    It is worth while to say that such practices lead to physical  degradation. The woman who acknowledges more than one husband is  generally sterile; the man who has several wives has usually a weakly  offspring, principally males. Nature attempts to check polygamy by  reducing the number of females, and failing in this, by enervating the  whole stock. The Mormons of Utah would soon sink into a state of Asiatic  effeminacy were they left to themselves.      COURTSHIP.    A wise provision of nature ordains that _woman shall be sought_. She  flees, and man pursues. The folly of modern reformers, who would annul  this provision, is evident. Were it done away with, man, ever prone to  yield to woman's solicitations, and then most prone when yielding is  most dangerous, would fritter away his powers at an early age, and those  very impulses which nature has given to perpetuate the race would bring  about its destruction.    To prevent such a disaster, woman is endowed with a sense of shame, an  invincible modesty, her greatest protection, and her greatest charm. Let  her never forget it, never disregard it; for without it she becomes the  scorn of her own sex and the jest of the other.    The urgency of man and the timidity of woman are tempered by the period  of courtship.    This, as it exists in the United States, is something almost peculiar to  Americans. On the continent of Europe, girls are shut up in convents or  in seminaries, or are kept strictly under the eyes of their parents  until marriage, or, at any rate, betrothal. The liberty usual in America  is something unheard-of and inconceivable there. In Spain a duenna, in  France some aunt or elderly cousin, in Germany some similar person,  makes it her business to be present at every interview which a young  lady has with an admirer. He never dreams of walking, driving, or going  out of an evening with her alone. It is taken for granted that, should  he invite her for such a purpose, the mother or aunt is included in the  party. They would look on the innocent freedom of American girls as  simply scandalous.    We have had opportunities to see society in these various countries, and  have failed to perceive that the morality of either sex is at all  superior to what it is with us, while the effect of cloister-like  education on young women is to weaken their self-reliance, and often  prepare them for greater extravagances when marriage gives them liberty.    With us, the young woman is free until her wedding day. After that  epoch, she looks forward to withdrawing more or less from society, and  confining her thoughts to family matters. In France, Spain, or Italy, in  the wealthier classes, precisely the contrary is the rule. Marriage  brings deliverance from an irksome espionage and numberless fetters; it  is the avenue to a life in public and independent action. How injurious  to domestic happiness this is, can readily be imagined.    It is true that the liberty of American girls occasionally leads to  improprieties. But, except in certain great cities, such instances are  rare. The safeguards of virtue are knowledge and self-command, not  duennas and _jalousies_. Let mothers properly instruct their daughters,  and they need have no apprehension about their conduct.    The period of courtship is one full of importance. A young woman of  unripe experience must decide from what she can see of a man during the  intercourse of a few months, whether he will suit her for a  life-companion. She has no knowledge of human nature; and what would it  avail her if she had, when at such a time a suitor is careful only to  show his eligible traits? 'Go a-courting,' said old Dr Franklin, in his  homely language, 'in your everyday clothes.' Not one man out of a  thousand is honest enough to take his advice.    It is useless for her to ask aid of another. She must judge for herself.  What, then, is she to do?    There is a mysterious instinct in a pure-minded woman which is beyond  all analysis,--a tact which men do not possess, and do not readily  believe in. At such a crisis this instinct saves her. She feels in a  moment the presence of a base, unworthy nature. An unconscious repulsion  is manifest in her eye, her voice. Where a suitor is not a man of low  motive, but merely quite incongruous in temper and disposition, this  same instinct acts, and the man, without being able to say just why,  feels that he is laboring in vain. If he blindly insists in his wooing,  he has no one to chide but himself when he is finally discarded.    But if the man is worthy, and suitable, does this blessed instinct  whisper the happy news with like promptness to the maiden's soul? Ah!  that raises another issue. It brings us face to face with that difficult  question of      LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.    Jung Stilling, a German author of note, a religious enthusiast, and full  of queer fancies, was, when young, a tutor in a private family. On one  occasion his employer took him to a strange house, and introduced him  to a roomful of company. Stilling had not contemplated marriage; but, in  the company, he saw, for the first time, a young woman who he felt was  his destined wife. Walking across the room, he addressed her with the  utmost simplicity, telling her that an inward monitor advised him that  she, of all womankind, was his predestined helpmeet. She blushed, was  confused, but presently confessed that she had experienced the same  conviction on first beholding him. They married, and the most curious  part of the tale remains to tell,--it is, that they proved a happy,  well-matched couple.    We do not advise others to follow their example. Not many souls are  capable of such reciprocity. Choosing an associate for life is too  serious a business to be made the affair of a moment. Reason,  reflection, thought, prayer,--these are aids in such a momentous  question not to be lightly thrown aside. Many a passing fancy, many an  evanescent preference, catches for a moment the new-fledged affections.  But for the long and tedious journey of life we want a love rooted in  knowledge.    We are not blind to the fact, that often from the first interview the  maiden feels an undefined spell thrown around her by him who will become  her husband. She feels differently in his presence; she watches him with  other eyes than she has for the rest of men. She renders no account to  herself of this emotion; she attempts no analysis of it; she does not  acknowledge to herself that it exists. No matter. Sooner or later, if  true to herself, she will learn what it is, and it will be a guide in  that moment, looked forward to with mingled hopes and fears, when she  is asked to decide on the destiny, the temporal and eternal destiny, of  two human lives.    That she may then decide aright, and live free from the regrets of a  false step at this crisis of life, we shall now rehearse what medical  science has to say about      HOW TO CHOOSE A HUSBAND.        'Choose well. Your choice is      Brief, and yet endless.'    Woman holds as an inalienable right, in this country, the privilege of  choice. It is not left to notaries, or parents, to select for her, as is  the custom in some other parts of the world.    First comes the question of relationship. A school-girl is apt to see  more of her cousins than of other young men. Often some of them seek at  an early hour to institute a far closer tie than that of blood. Is she  wise to accept it?      SHALL COUSINS MARRY?    Hardly any point has been more warmly debated by medical men. It has  been said that in such marriages the woman is more apt to be sterile;  that if she have children, they are peculiarly liable to be born with  some defect of body or mind,--deafness, blindness, idiocy, or lameness;  that they die early; and that they are subject, beyond others, to fatal  hereditary diseases, as cancer, consumption, scrofula, etc.    An ardent physician persuaded himself so thoroughly of these evils  resulting from marriage of relatives, that he induced the Legislature  of Kentucky to pass a law prohibiting it within certain degrees of  consanguinity. Many a married couple have been rendered miserable by the  information that they had unwittingly violated one of nature's most  positive laws. Though their children may be numerous and blooming, they  live in constant dread of some terrible outbreak of disease. Many a  young and loving couple have sadly severed an engagement, which would  have been a prelude to a happy marriage, when they were informed of  these disastrous results.    For all such we have a word of consolation. We speak it authoritatively,  and not without a full knowledge of the responsibility we assume.    The risk of marrying a cousin, even a first cousin, is greatly  diminished, provided there is no decided hereditary taint in the family.  And when such hereditary taint does exist, the danger is little more  than in marrying into any other family where it is also found. Indeed, a  certain German author has urged the propriety of such unions, where the  family has traits of mental or physical excellence, as a means of  preserving and developing them!    So far as sterility is concerned, an examination of records shows, that  whereas in the average of unions one women in _eight_ is barren, in  those between relatives but one in _ten_ is so. And as for the early  deaths of children, while, on an average,"]]]
