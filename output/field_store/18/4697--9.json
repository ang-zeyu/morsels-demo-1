That anomaly  of mediaevalism was one of the few who could neglect a vain and  senseless theology and system of metaphysics to apply his genius  to the solid pursuits of truer philosophy; and if his influence  has not been so great as it might have been, it is the fault of  the age rather than of the man. Condemned by the fear or jealousy  of his Franciscan brethren and Dominican rivals, Bacon was thrown  into prison, where he was excluded from propagating 'certain  suspected novelties' during fourteen years, a victim of his more  liberal opinions and of theological hatred. One of the traditions  of his diabolical compacts gives him credit at least for  ingenuity in avoiding at once a troublesome bargain and a  terrible fate. The philosopher's compact stipulated that after  death his soul was to be the reward and possession of the devil,  whether he died within the church's sacred walls or without them.  Finding his end approaching, that sagacious magician caused a  cell to be constructed in the walls of the consecrated edifice,  giving directions, which were properly carried out, for his  burial in a tomb that was thus neither within nor without the  church--an evasion of a long-expected event, which lost the  disappointed devil his prize, and probably his temper. 'Friar  Bacon' became afterwards a well-known character in the vulgar  fables: he was the type of the mediaeval, as the poet Virgil was  of the ancient, magician. A popular drama was founded on his  reputed exploits and character in the sixteenth century, by  Robert Greene, in 'Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay;' but the famous  Dr. Faustus, the most popular magic hero of that time on the  stage, was a formidable rival. While his cotemporaries denounced  his rational method, preferring their theological jargon and  scholastic metaphysics; how much the Aristotle of mediaevalism has  been neglected even latterly is a surprising fact.[56]      [56] The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge have not    exhibited the same impatience for a worthy edition of the    works of Bacon with which Clement IV. expected a copy of the    _Opus Majus_. His principal writings remained in MS. and    were not published to the world until the middle of last    century.    But in proof of the prevalence of the popular suspicion, not even  the all-powerful spiritual Chief of Christendom was spared. Many  of the pontiffs were charged with being addicted to the 'Black  Art'--an odd imputation against the vicars of Christ and the  successors of St. Peter. A charge, however, which we may be  disposed to receive as evidence that in a long and disgusting  list of ambitious priests and licentious despots there have been  some popes who, by cultivating philosophy, may have in some  sort partially redeemed the hateful character of Christian  sacerdotalism. At a council held at Paris in the interest of  Philip IV., Boniface VIII. was publicly accused of sorcery: it  was affirmed that 'he had a familiar demon [the Socratic  Genius?]; for he has said that if all mankind were on one side  and he alone on the other, he could not be mistaken either in  point of fact or of right, which presupposes a diabolical art'--a  dogma of sacerdotalism sufficiently confident, but scarcely  requiring a miraculous solution. This pope's death, it is said,  was hastened by these and similar reports of his dealings with  familiar spirits, invented in the interest of the French king to  justify his hostility. Boniface VIII.'s esoteric opinions on  Catholicism and Christianity, if correctly reported, did not show  the orthodoxy to be expected from the supreme pontiff: but he  would not be a singular example amongst the numerous occupants of  the chair of St. Peter.[57]      [57] Leo X. (whose tastes were rather profane than pious)    instructed or amused himself by causing to be discussed the    question of the nature of the soul--himself adopting the    opinion 'redit in nihilum quod fuit ante nihil,' and the    decision of Aristotle and of Epicurus.    John XXII., one of his more immediate successors, is said to be  the pope who first formally condemned the crime of witchcraft,  more systematically anathematised some hundred and fifty years  afterwards by Innocent VIII. He complains of the universal  infection of Christendom: that his own court even, and immediate  attendants, were attached to the devil's service, applying to him  on all occasions for help. The earliest judicial trial for the  crime on record in England is said to have occurred in the reign  of John. It is briefly stated in the 'Abbreviatio Placitorum'  that 'Agnes, the wife of Odo the merchant, accused Gideon of  sorcery; and he was acquitted by the judgment of iron.' The first  account of which much information is given occurs in Edward II.'s  reign, when the lives of the royal favourites, the De Spencers,  and his own, were attempted by a supposed criminal, one John of  Nottingham, with the assistance of his man, Robert Marshall, who  became king's evidence, and charged his master with having  conspired the king's death by the arts of sorcery.[58] Cupidity  or malice was the cause of this informer's accusation. One of the  distinguishing characteristics in its annals was the abuse of the  common prejudice for political purposes, or for the gratification  of private passion.      [58] _Narratives of Sorcery and Magic_, by Thomas Wright.    At the commencement of the fourteenth century the persecution and  final destruction of the Order of the Knights Templars in the  different countries of Europe, but chiefly in France (an instance  of the former abuse), is one of the most atrocious facts in  the history of those times. The fate of the Knights of the  Temple (whose original office it had been to protect their  coreligionists during pilgrimages in the Holy City, and whose  quarters were near the site of the Temple--whence the title of  the Order) in France was determined by the jealousy or avarice of  Philip IV. Founded in the first half of the twelfth century as a  half-religious, half-military institution, that celebrated Order  was, in its earlier career, in high repute for valour and success  in fighting the battles of the Cross. With wealth and fame, pride  and presumption increased to the highest pitch; and at the end of  150 years the champions of Christendom were equally hated and  feared. Their entire number was no more than 1,500; but they were  all experienced warriors, in possession of a number of important  fortresses, besides landed property to the amount, throughout  their whole extent, of nine thousand manorial estates. When the  Holy Land was hopelessly lost to the profane ambition or  religious zeal of the West, its defenders returned to their homes  loaded with riches and prestige if not with unstained honour, and  without insinuations that they had betrayed the cause of Christ  and the Crusades. Such was the condition of the Temple when  Philip, after exhausting the coffers of Jews and Christians,  found his treasury still unfilled. The opportunity was not to  be neglected: it remained only to secure the consent of the  Church, and to provoke the ready credulity of the people. Church  and State united, supported by the popular superstition,  were irresistible; and the destined victims expected their  impending fate in silent terror. At length the signal was given.  Prosecutions in 1307 were carried on simultaneously throughout  the provinces; but in French territory they assumed the most  formidable shape. In many places they were acquitted of the  gravest indictments: the English king, from a feeling of justice  or jealousy, expressed himself in their favour. As for Spain, 'it  was not in presence of the Moors, and on the classic ground of  Crusade, that the thought could be entertained of proscribing the  old defenders of Christendom.' Paris, where was their principal  temple, was the centre of the Order; their wealth and power were  concentrated in France; and thus the spoils not of a single  province, but almost of the entire body, were within the grasp of  a single monarch. Hence he assumed the right of presiding as  judge and executioner.[59] On October 12, 1307, Jacques Molay,  with the heads of the Temple, was invited to Paris, where, loaded  with favours, they were lulled into fatal security. The delusion  was soon abruptly dispelled. Molay, together with 140 of his  brethren, was arrested--the signal for a more general procedure  throughout the kingdom.      [59] Dante seems to refer to this recent spoliation in the    following verses:--           'Lo! the new Pilate, of whose cruelty          Such violence cannot fill the measure up,          With no decree to sanction, pushes on          Into the Temple his yet eager sails.'                          _Purgat._ xx. Cary's Transl.    The charges have been resolved under three heads: (1) The denial  of Christ. (2) Treachery to the cause of Christianity. (3) The  worship of the devil, and the practice of sorcery. The principal  articles in the indictment were that the knights at initiation  formally denied the divinity of Christ, pronouncing he was not  truly a God--even going so far as to assert he was a false  prophet, a man who had been punished for his crimes; that they  had no hopes of salvation through him; that at the final  reception they always spat on the Cross, trampling it under foot;  that they worshipped the devil in the form of a cat, or some  other familiar animal; that they adored him in the figure of an  idol consecrated by anointing it with the fat of a new-born  infant, the illegitimate offspring of a brother; that a demon  appeared in the shape of a black or gray cat, &c. The idol is a  mysterious object. According to some it was a head with a beard,  or a head with three faces: by others it was said to be a skull,  a cat. One witness testified that in a chapter of the Order one  brother said to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22829"],[0,"No Animal Food; and Nutrition and Diet; with Vegetable Recipes (#12)"],[1,"removing the dark  inner skin in order to give the uncooked grain a white and polished  appearance, is not only an expensive operation, but a very foolish one,  for it detracts largely from the nutritive value of the food, as  considerable protein and other valuable matter is removed along with the  bran. We are told that the Burmese and Japanese and other nations who  use rice as their principal food-stuff, use the entire grain. As  compared to undressed rice, the ordinary, or polished rice is deficient  3 per cent. of protein; 6 per cent. of fat; 5 per cent. of mineral  matter. 'Once milled' rice can be procured in this country, but has to  be specially asked for. Rice is not nearly so nitrogenous as wheat, but  is equal to it in fuel value, this being due to the large amount of  starch it contains. It is an excellent food, being easily digested and  easily prepared.    Millet, buckwheat, wild rice, sesame, and Kaffir corn, are cereals  little known in this country, although where they are raised they are  largely used by the natives. However, we need not trouble to consider  their food value as they are not easily procurable either in Europe or  America.    Nuts are perhaps the best of all foods. There is no doubt but that man  in his original wild state lived on nuts and berries and perhaps roots.  Nuts are rich in protein and fat. They are a concentrated food, very  palatable, gently laxative, require no preparation but shelling, keep  well, are easily portable, and are, in every sense, an ideal food. They  have a name for being indigestible, but this may be due to errors in  eating, not to the nuts. If we eat nuts, as is often done, after having  loaded the stomach with a large dinner, the work of digesting them is  rendered very difficult, for the digestive apparatus tires itself  disposing of the meal just previously eaten. Most things are  indigestible eaten under such conditions. Nuts should be looked upon as  the essential part of the meal and should be eaten first; bread, salad  stuffs and fruit help to supply bulk and can follow as dessert if  desired. Another cause of nuts not being easily digested is insufficient  mastication. They are hard, solid food, and should be thoroughly chewed  and insalivated before being swallowed. If the teeth are not good, nuts  may be grated in an ordinary nut-mill, and then, if eaten slowly and  sparingly, will generally be found to digest. Of course with a weak  digestion nuts may have to be avoided, or used in very small quantities  until the digestion is strengthened; but with a normal, healthy person,  nuts are a perfect food and can be eaten all the year round. Perhaps it  is best not to eat a large quantity at once, but to spread the day's  supply over four or five light meals. With some, however, two meals a  day seems to work well.    Pine kernels are very suitable for those who have any difficulty in  masticating or digesting the harder nuts, such as the brazil, filbert,  etc. They are quite soft and can easily be ground into a soft paste with  a pestil and mortar, making delicious butter. They vary considerably in  nitrogenous matter, averaging about 25 per cent. and are very rich in  fat, averaging about 50 per cent. Chestnuts are used largely by the  peasants of Italy. They are best cooked until quite soft when they are  easily digested. Chestnut meal is obtainable, and when combined with  wheatmeal is useful for making biscuits and breadstuffs. Protein in  chestnuts averages 10 per cent. Walnuts, Hazelnuts, Filberts, Brazils,  Pecans, Hickory nuts, Beechnuts, Butternuts, Pistachio nuts and Almonds  average 16 per cent. protein; 52 per cent. fat; 20 per cent.  carbohydrates; 2 per cent. mineral salts. As each possesses a distinct  flavour, one can live on nuts alone and still enjoy the pleasure of  variety. A man weighing 140 lbs. would, at moderately active labour,  require, to live on almonds alone--11 ozs. per day. 10 ozs. of nuts per  day together with some fresh fruit or green salad in summer, and in  winter, some roots, as potato, carrot, or beetroot, would furnish an  ideal diet for one whose taste was simple enough to relish it.    Fruits are best left alone in winter. They are generally acid, and the  system is better without very acid foods in the cold weather. But fruits  are health-giving foods in warm and hot weather, and living under  natural, primitive conditions, this is the only time of the year we  should have them, for Nature only provides fruit during the months of  summer. The fraction of protein fruit contains, 1 per cent. or less, is  too small to be of any account. The nutritive value of fruits consists  in their mineral salts, grape-sugar and water.    Much the same applies to green vegetables. In cooking vegetables care  should be taken that the water they are cooked in is not thrown away as  it contains nearly all the nutrient properties of the vegetable; that is  to say, the various salts in the vegetable become dissolved in the water  they are boiled in. This water can be used for soup if desired, or  evaporated, and with flour added to thicken, served as sauce to the  vegetable. Potatoes are a salutary food, especially in winter. They  contain alkalies which help to lessen the accumulation of uric acid.  They should be cooked with skins on: 16 grains per lb. more of valuable  potash salts are thus obtained than when peeled and boiled in the  ordinary way. The ideal method, however, of taking most vegetables is in  the form of uncooked salads, for in these the health-giving, vitalising  elements remain unaltered.    If man is to be regarded, as many scientists regard him, as a frugivore,  constitutionally adapted and suited to a nut-fruit diet, then to regain  our lost original taste and acquire a liking for such simple foods  should be our aim. It may be difficult, if not impossible, to make a  sudden change after having lived for many years upon the complex  concoctions of the chef's art, for the system resents sudden changes,  but with proper care, changing discreetly, one can generally attain a  desired end, especially when it involves the replacing of a bad habit by  a good one.    In the recipes that follow no mention is made of condiments, _i.e._,  pepper, salt, mustard, spice, _et hoc genus omni_. Condiments are not  foods in any sense whatever, and the effect upon the system of  'seasoning' foods with these artificial aids to appetite, is always  deleterious, none the less because it may at the time be imperceptible,  and may eventually result in disease. Dr. Kellogg writes: 'By contact,  they irritate the mucous membrane, causing congestion and diminished  secretion of gastric juice when taken in any but quite small quantities.  When taken in quantities so small as to occasion no considerable  irritation of the mucous membrane, condiments may still work injury by  their stimulating effects, when long continued.... Experimental evidence  shows that human beings, as well as animals of all classes, live and  thrive as well without salt as with it, other conditions being equally  favorable. This statement is made with a full knowledge of counter  arguments and experiments, but with abundant testimony to support the  position taken.... All condiments hinder natural digestion.'    Condiments, together with such things as pickles, vinegar, alcohol, tea,  coffee, cocoa, tobacco, opium, are all injurious, and undoubtedly are  the cause of an almost innumerable number of minor, and, in some cases,  serious, complaints. Theine, caffeine, and theobromine, all stimulant  drugs, are present in tea, coffee, and cocoa, respectively. Tea also  contains tannin, a substance which is said to seriously impair  digestion.    Alcohol, tea, coffee, etc., are stimulants. Stimulants do not produce  force and should never be mistaken for food. They are undoubtedly  injurious, as they are the cause, among other evils, of _loss_ of force.  They cause an abnormal metabolism which ultimately weakens and exhausts  the whole system. While these internal activities are taking place,  artificial feelings of well-being, or, at least, agreeable sensations,  are produced, which are unfortunately mistaken for signs of benefit.  Speaking of alcohol Dr. Haig writes: 'It introduces no albumen or force,  it merely affects circulation, nutrition, and the metabolism of the  albumens already in the body, and this call on the resources of the body  is invariably followed by a corresponding depression or economy in the  future.... It has been truly said that the man who relies upon  stimulants for strength is lost, for he is drawing upon a reserve fund,  which is not completely replaced, and physiological bankruptcy must  inevitably ensue. This is what the stimulants such as tea, coffee,  alcohol, tobacco, opium and cocaine do for those who trust in them.'    He who desires to enjoy life desires to possess good physical health,  for a healthy body is almost essential to a happy life; and he who  desires to live healthily does not abuse his body with poisonous drugs.  It may require courage to reform, but he who reforms in this direction  has the satisfaction of knowing that his good health will probably some  day excite the envy of his critics.    The chemical composition of all the common food materials can be seen  from tables of analyses. It would be to the advantage of everyone to  spend a little time examining these tables. It is not a difficult  matter, and the trouble to calculate the quantity of protein in a given  quantity of food, when once the _modus operandi_ is understood, is  trifling. As it has not unwisely been suggested, if people would give,  say, one-hundredth the time and attention to studying the needs of the  body and how to satisfy them as they give to dress and amusement, there  is little doubt that there would be more happiness in the world.    The amount of protein in any particular prepared food is arrived at in  the following"]]]
