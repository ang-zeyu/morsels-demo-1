The days passed by, and the Kittens grew finely. They got their eyes  open, first in narrow cracks, and then wider and wider, until they were  round and staring. The White Kitten had blue ones, the others brown. In  the daytime, they had long, narrow black spots in the middle of their  eyes, and as the bright light faded, these black spots spread out  sideways until they were quite round. When it was very dark, these spots  glowed like great Fireflies in the night. Then the Mice, who often  scampered through the loft when the Cat was away, would see three pairs  of eyes glowing in the hay, and they would squeak to each other: \"See!  The Kittens are watching us.\"    And the Kittens, who were not yet old enough to go hunting, and who were  afraid of everything that stirred, would crowd up against each other,  arch their little backs, raise their pointed tails, stand their fur on  end, and say, \"Pst! Ha-a-ah!\"    Sometimes they did this when there was not a person in sight and what  frightened them was nothing but a wisp of hay, blown down by the wind.  Afterward, when anything moved, they sprang at it, held it down with  their sharp little claws, and chewed on it with their pointed white  teeth. When they were tired of this game, they played hide-and-seek, and  when they were tired of that they chased their tails. It was so nice  always to have playthings with them. Sometimes, too, they chased each  other's tails, and caught them and bit them hard, until the Kitten who  owned the tail cried, \"Mieow!\" and tumbled the biter over.    They were allowed to play all through the loft except over the mangers.  Their mother was afraid that if they went there they would fall through  the holes which had been left in the floor. During the winter, the  farmer used to throw hay down through these to the hungry Horses. When  the Cat saw her children going toward these places, she called them back  and scolded them. Sometimes she struck them lightly on the ears with her  forepaw. \"I don't like to,\" said she, \"but they must learn to keep away.  It is not safe for them to go there.\"    One morning when she was away, they were playing hide-and-seek, and the  White Kitten was hunting for a good hiding-place. \"I'll hide near one of  these holes,\" she said, \"and they won't dare come there to look. Then,  after they have hunted a long, long time, I'll get another place and  let them find me.\" She did hide there, and after a long, long time, when  her brother and sister were in the farther end of the loft, she tried to  run over to another dark corner. Instead of that, the hay began to slip  and slide under her and she went down, down, down, through a long dark  box, and hit with a hard thud at the bottom.    She was so scared that she couldn't have told how many toes she had on  her forefeet. Of course, she had five on each, like all Kittens, and  four on each hind-foot, but if anybody had asked her then, she would  have been quite likely to say \"three.\"    She was sore, too, and when she felt a warm breath on her and opened her  eyes, she saw that some great creature had thrust his nose through a  hole in the side of the dark box. \"It must be a Horse,\" she thought,  \"and my mother says that they are kind to Cats. I think I'd better tell  him who I am. I don't want him to take me for a Pig, because he may not  like Pigs.\" You see, she forgot that Horses had been living in the great  world and could tell to what family a person belonged the very first  time they saw him. The only people she had ever seen were Swallows and  Mice.    \"If--if you please, sir,\" she said, \"I am the White Kitten, and I just  tumbled down from the hay-loft, but I didn't mean to.\"    \"I am the Blind Horse,\" answered a strong and gentle voice outside, \"and  I hope you are not hurt.\"    \"Not very much,\" answered the Kitten. \"I just feel ache-y in my back and  scared all over.\"    \"Come out into the manger, White Kitten,\" said the Blind Horse, \"and  perhaps you won't be so scared. I won't touch you, although I should  like to. You know I am blind, and so, unless I can touch people I  don't know how they look.\"    [Illustration: I AM THE WHITE KITTEN.]    The White Kitten crawled out and saw him, and then she wasn't afraid at  all. She was so sorry for him that she couldn't be afraid. She  remembered the time before her eyes opened when she had to feel for  everything she wanted. It was not so hard then, because she did not know  anything different, but now she could not bear to think of not being  able to see all that was around her. \"If you will put your nose down in  the other end of the manger,\" she said, \"I will rub up against it, and  you will know more how I look.\"    The Blind Horse did this, and who can tell how happy it made him when  her warm and furry back rubbed up against his nose? \"Thank you,\" he  whinnied; \"you are very good.\"    \"Would you know I was a Kitten if I hadn't told you?\" she said.    \"Indeed I would,\" he answered.    \"And you wouldn't have thought me a Pig?\" she asked.    \"Never!\" said he; \"I wouldn't even have believed you if you had told me  that you were one.\"    The Blind Horse and the White Kitten became firm friends, and when she  tried to wash off the dirt that got into her fur she sat in the very  middle of the manger and told him all about it.    \"My mother always has washed me,\" she said, \"but my tongue is getting  big enough to wash with now. It is getting rougher, too, and that is a  good thing. My mother says that the reason why all the prickles on Cats'  tongues point backward is because then we can lick all the meat off from  bones with them. I'm 'most old enough to eat meat now. I can't wash the  top of my head though. You have to wet your paw and scrub it with that.  Can you wash the top of your head?\"    Then the Blind Horse told her how the men kept him clean; and while he  was telling this the Cat came into his stall, crying and looking for her  child.    \"Oh, mother,\" cried the White Kitten, \"I tumbled down, but I didn't mean  to, and I'm sorry I didn't mind you, and the Blind Horse can't wash the  top of his head, and he knew that I wasn't a Pig.\"    The Cat was so glad to find the White Kitten that she didn't scold at  all, but jumped into the manger and washed her clean, and then caught  the loose skin of the Kitten's neck between her teeth and carried her  through the stalls, across the barn-floor, and up the stairs to their  home. That made the Kitten much ashamed, for she thought that she was  old enough to go alone.    For two whole days after this the White Kitten was so lame from her fall  that she could only lie still on the hay, and she could see that her  mother did not treat her as before. \"I won't ever go near those places  again,\" she said. \"I never will.\"    \"You promised me before that you would stay away,\" said her mother, \"and  you broke your promise.\" She did not punish the White Kitten, but she  felt very sad and she could not help showing it. There was a dreadful  ache in her child's little Kitten-heart that was a great deal worse than  the lameness in her back or in her neck or in her legs.    At last there came a day when the whole family walked downstairs, and  the Cat showed her three children to the farmyard people and spoke a few  words about each. \"The yellow Kitten, my big daughter,\" said she,  \"promises to be the best hunter: she is a wonderful jumper, and her  claws are already nearly as long as mine. My son, the brown one, has a  remarkable voice. And this White Kitten, my little daughter, is the most  obedient of all. She has never disobeyed me since the day she fell into  the manger, and I can trust her perfectly.\"    Then the White Kitten knew that she was quite forgiven, and she was the  happiest person on the farm.          THE CHICKEN WHO WOULDN'T EAT GRAVEL      It was some time after the Dorking Hen had come off the nest with her  little brood, that the mother of the Shanghai Chickens began to have so  much trouble.    She had twelve as fine Chickens as you could find anywhere: tall,  wide-awake youngsters with long and shapely legs and thick down and  feathers. She was very proud of them, as any Hen mother might well be,  and often said to the Shanghai Cock, \"Did you ever see so fine a family?  Look at those twenty-four legs, all so long and straight, and not a  feather on one of them.\" His eyes would shine and he would stretch his  neck with pride, but all he ever said to her was, \"They will do very  well if they only behave as well as they look.\" He did not believe in  praising children to their faces, and he thought their mother spoiled  them.    Perhaps he was right, for the little Shanghais soon found out that they  were good-looking, and they wanted everybody in the poultry-yard to  notice their legs. It was very foolish, of course, to be proud of such  things, but when the other fowls said, \"We should think you would be  cold without feathers on your legs,\" they answered, \"Oh, we are  Shanghais, and our family never wear feathers there!\" And that was true,  just as it is true that the Dorkings have extra toes, and that the Black  Spanish fowls have white ears.    The Shanghai mother was now roaming the fields with her brood, and there  was rich picking in the wheat-stubble. All"]]]
