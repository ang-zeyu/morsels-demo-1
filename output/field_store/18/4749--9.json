ARTICLE 6. No future amendment of the Constitution shall       affect the five preceding articles, nor the third paragraph       of the second section of the first article of the       Constitution, nor the third paragraph of the second section       of the fourth article of said Constitution, and no amendment       shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or       give to Congress any power to abolish or interfere with       slavery in any of the States, by whose laws it is or may be       allowed or permitted.         ARTICLE 7, Sec. 1. The elective franchise and the right to       hold office, whether federal, State, territorial, or       municipal, shall not be exercised by persons who are, in       whole or in part, of the African race.         And _whereas_, also, besides those causes of dissension       embraced in the foregoing amendments proposed to the       Constitution of the United States, there are others which       come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and may be       remedied by its legislative power: and _whereas_ it is the       desire of this Convention, as far its influence may extend,       to remove all just cause for the popular discontent and       agitation which now disturb the peace of the country, and       threaten the stability of its institutions: Therefore,         1. _Resolved_, That the laws now in force for the recovery       of fugitive slaves are in strict pursuance of the plain and       mandatory provisions of the Constitution, and have been       sanctioned as valid and constitutional by the judgment of       the Supreme Court of the United States; that the       slaveholding States are entitled to the faithful observance       and execution of those laws, and that they ought not to be       repealed, or so modified or changed as to impair their       efficiency; and that laws ought to be made for the       punishment of those who attempt, by rescue of the slave or       other illegal means, to hinder or defeat the due execution       of said laws.         2. That all State laws which conflict with the fugitive       slave acts, or any other constitutional acts of Congress, or       which in their operation impede, hinder, or delay the free       course and due execution of any of said acts, are null and       void by the plain provisions of the Constitution of the       United States. Yet those State laws, void as they are, have       given color to practices, and led to consequences which have       obstructed the due administration and execution of acts of       Congress, and especially the acts for the delivery of       fugitive slaves, and have thereby contributed much to the       discord and commotion now prevailing. This Convention,       therefore, in the present perilous juncture, does not deem       it improper, respectfully and earnestly to recommend the       repeal of those laws to the several States which have       enacted them, or such legislative corrections or       explanations of them as may prevent their being used or       perverted to such mischievous purposes.         3. That the act of the 18th of September, 1850, commonly       called the Fugitive Slave Law, ought to be so amended as to       make the fee of the Commissioner, mentioned in the eighth       section of the act, equal in amount, in the cases decided by       him, whether his decision be in favor of or against the       claimant. And to avoid misconstructions, the last clause of       the fifth section, of said act, which authorizes the person       holding a warrant for the arrest or detention of a fugitive       slave, to summon to his aid the _posse comitatus_, and which       declares it to be the duty of all good citizens to assist       him in its execution, ought to be so amended as to expressly       limit the authority and duty to cases in which there shall       be resistance, or danger of resistance or rescue.         4. That the laws for the suppression of the African       slave-trade, and especially those prohibiting the       importation of slaves into the United States, ought to be       made effectual, and ought to be thoroughly executed, and all       further enactments necessary to those ends ought to be       promptly made.           No. 2.         _Proposed Amendments by Mr. Seddon._         To secure concert and promote harmony between the       slaveholding and non-slaveholding sections of the Union, the       assent of the majority of the Senators from the slaveholding       States, and of the majority of the Senators from the       non-slaveholding States, shall be requisite to the validity       of all action of the Senate, on which the ayes and noes may       be called by five Senators.         And on a written declaration, signed and presented for       record on the Journal of the Senate by a majority of       Senators from either the non-slaveholding or slaveholding       States, of their want of confidence in any officer or       appointee of the Executive, exercising functions exclusively       or continuously within the class of States, or any of them,       which the signers represent, then such officer shall be       removed by the Executive; and if not removed at the       expiration of ten days from the presentation of such       declaration, the office shall be deemed vacant and open to       new appointment.         The connection of every State with the Union is recognized       as depending on the continuing assent of its people, and       compulsion shall in no case, nor under any form, be       attempted by the Government of the Union against a State       acting in its collective or organic capacity. Any State, by       the action of a convention of its people, assembled pursuant       to a law of its Legislature, is held entitled to dissolve       its relation to the Federal Government, and withdraw from       the Union; and, on due notice given of such withdrawal to       the Executive of the Union, he shall appoint two       Commissioners, to meet two Commissioners to be appointed by       the Governor of the State, who, with the aid, if needed from       the disagreement of the Commissioners, of an umpire, to be       selected by a majority of them, shall equitably adjudicate       and determine finally a partition of the rights and       obligations of the withdrawing State; and such adjudication       and partition being accomplished, the withdrawal of such       State shall be recognized by the Executive, and announced by       public proclamation to the world.         But such withdrawing State shall not afterwards be       readmitted into the Union without the assent of two-thirds       of the States constituting the Union at the time of the       proposed readmission.    Mr. COALTER:--It is proper that I should say a word in relation to the  position of Missouri in this Conference. It is expressly referred to  in the resolution under which we hold our appointment, passed by the  Senate and House of Representatives. It is believed by the people of  Missouri that the rights and privileges of the slaveholding States are  in danger, and that the time has arrived when they should be secured  by additional guarantees. Those guarantees must be such as will secure  the honor and equal rights of the slaveholding States.    I wish to say, further, that we, as Commissioners, must act at all  times under the control of the General Assembly or the State  Convention of our State. Before we can act definitely upon either of  the propositions submitted, I think it will be our duty to transmit  them to the General Assembly for instructions.    Mr. WICKLIFFE:--The several reports are now before the Conference. I  presume it will be the desire of every member to give them a careful  examination. In order to prevent all unnecessary delay, I move that  the several reports be laid upon the table, that they be printed at  once and distributed to the members, and made the special order of the  Conference for 12 o'clock to-morrow.    The motion of Mr. WICKLIFFE was agreed to.    Mr. WICKLIFFE:--I have drawn up a preamble and a resolution which I  wish to offer for the consideration of the Conference. I shall not  press action upon them to-day, but desire to have them laid on the  table and printed. I shall call them up after the report of the  General Committee is disposed of. It would gratify me much, and I  think greatly tend to the peace and harmony of the country, if they  could be adopted at once, and published. It is well known to most of  you that there is nothing in all the legislation or action of the Free  States, which has created so much excitement and alarm among the  people of the slaveholding States, as the passage of the so called  \"personal liberty\" acts. They are regarded as deliberate infractions  and breaches of the Constitution, and as attempts to nullify the  operation of a constitutional enactment of Congress. But I do not wish  to invite discussion upon the subject now; I hope my motion will not  meet with objection.    The motion of Mr. WICKLIFFE was adopted, and the preamble and  resolution were presented as follows:         MR. WICKLIFFE'S PREAMBLE AND RESOLUTION.         _Whereas_, the second section of the fourth article of the       Constitution of the United States declares, \"that no person       held to service or labor in one State, under the laws       thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any       law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service       or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to       whom such service or labor may be due.\"         This clause is one of the compromises without which no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24562"],[0,"The Panjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir (#12)"],[1,"carrying a couple of small saddle-bags laden with borax or salt, which  is bartered in the Panjab bazars for Indian and foreign stores for the  winter requirements of the snow-blocked valleys beyond the frontier.    ~Sapphires.~--The sapphires of Zanskar have been worked at intervals since  the discovery of the deposit in 1881, and some of the finest stones in  the gem market have been obtained from this locality, where work is,  however, difficult on account of the great altitude and the difficulty  of access from the plains.    ~Limestone.~--Large deposits of Nummulitic limestone are found in the  older Tertiary formations of North-West India. It yields a pure lime and  is used in large quantities for building purposes. The constant  association of these limestones with shale beds, and their frequent  association with coal, naturally suggest their employment for the  manufacture of cement; and special concessions have recently been given  by the Panjab Government with a view of encouraging the development of  the industry. The nodular impure limestone, known generally by the name  of _kankar_, contains sufficient clay to give it hydraulic characters  when burnt, and much cement is thus manufactured. The varying  composition of _kankar_ naturally results in a product of irregular  character, and consequently cement so made can replace Portland cement  only for certain purposes.    ~Slate~ is quarried in various places for purely local use. In the Kangra  valley material of very high quality is obtained and consequently  secures a wide distribution, limited, however, by competition with  cheaply made tiles.    ~Gypsum~ occurs in large quantities in association with the rock-salt of  the Salt Range, but the local demand is small. There are also beds of  potash and magnesian salts in the same area, but their value and  quantity have not been thoroughly proved.

CHAPTER V    CLIMATE      ~Types of Climate.~--The climate of the Panjab plains is determined by  their distance from the sea and the existence of formidable mountain  barriers to the north and west. The factor of elevation makes the  climate of the Himalayan tracts very different from that of the plains.  Still more striking is the contrast between the Indian Himalayan climate  and the Central Asian Trans-Himalayan climate of Spiti, Lahul, and  Ladakh.    ~Zones.~--A broad division into six zones may be recognised:      A 1. Trans-Himalayan.    B 2. Himalayan.    C. Plains      3. North Western.                   4. Submontane.                   5. Central and South Eastern.                   6. South Western.    ~Trans-Himalayan Climate.~--Spiti, Lahul, and Ladakh are outside the  meteorological influences which affect the rest of the Indian Empire.  The lofty ranges of the Himalaya interpose an almost insurmountable  barrier between them and the clouds of the monsoon. The rainfall is  extraordinarily small, and, considering the elevation of the inhabited  parts, 10,000 to 14,000 feet, the snowfall there is not heavy. The air  is intensely dry and clear, and the daily and seasonal range of  temperature is extreme. Leh, the capital of Ladakh (11,500 feet), has an  average rainfall (including snow) of about 3 inches. The mean  temperature is 43 deg. Fahr., varying from 19 deg. in January to 64 deg. in July.  But these figures give no idea of the rigours of the severe but healthy  climate. The daily range is from 25 to 30 degrees, or double what we are  accustomed to in England. Once 17 deg. below zero was recorded. In the rare  dry clear atmosphere the power of the solar rays is extraordinary.  \"Rocks exposed to the sun may be too hot to lay the hand upon at the  same time that it is freezing in the shade.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 17. Average Barometric and Wind Chart for January.]    [Illustration: Fig. 18. Average Barometric and Wind Chart for July.]    ~The Indian Zones--Meteorological factors.~--The distribution of pressure  in India, determined mainly by changes of temperature, and itself  determining the direction of the winds and the character of the weather,  is shown graphically in figures 17 and 18. The winter or north-east  monsoon does not penetrate into the Panjab, where light westernly and  northernly winds prevail during the cold season. What rain is received  is due to land storms originating beyond the western frontier. The  branch of the summer or south-west monsoon which chiefly affects the  Panjab is that which blows up the Bay of Bengal. The rain-clouds  striking the Eastern Himalaya are deflected to the west and forced up  the Gangetic plain by south-westernly winds. The lower ranges of the  Panjab Himalaya receive in this way very heavy downpours. The rain  extends into the plains, but exhausts itself and dies away pretty  rapidly to the south and west. The Bombay branch of the monsoon mostly  spends itself on the Ghats and in the Deccan. But a part of it  penetrates from time to time to the south-east Panjab, and, if it is  sucked into the Bay current, the result is widespread rain.    ~Himalayan Zone.~--The impressions which English people get of the climate  of the Himalaya, or in Indian phrase \"the Hills,\" are derived mainly  from stations like Simla and Murree perched at a height of from 6500 to  7500 feet on the outer ranges. The data of meteorologists are mainly  taken from the same localities. Places between 8000 and 10,000 feet in  height and further from the plains enjoy a finer climate, being both  cooler and drier in summer. But they are less accessible, and weakly  persons would find the greater rarity of the air trying.    In the first fortnight of April the plains become disagreeably warm, and  it is well to take European children to the Hills. The Panjab Government  moves to Simla in the first fortnight of May. By that time Simla is  pretty warm in the middle of the day, but the nights are pleasant. The  mean temperature of the 24 hours in May and June is 65 deg. or 66 deg., the mean  maximum and minimum being 78 deg. and 59 deg.. Thunderstorms with or without  hail are not uncommon in April, May, and June. In a normal year the  monsoon clouds drift up in the end of June, and the next three months  are \"the Rains.\" Usually it does not rain either all day or every day;  but sometimes for weeks together Simla is smothered in a blanket of grey  mist. Normally the rain comes in bursts with longer or shorter breaks  between. About the third week of September the rains often cease quite  suddenly, the end being usually proclaimed by a thunderstorm. Next  morning one wakes to a new heaven and a new earth, a perfectly cloudless  sky, and clean, crisp, cool air. This ideal weather lasts for the next  three months. Even in December the days are made pleasant by bright  sunshine, and the range of temperature is much less than in the plains.  In the end of December or beginning of January the night thermometer  often falls lower at Ambala and Rawalpindi than at Simla and Murree.  After Christmas the weather becomes broken, and in January and February  falls of snow occur. It is a disagreeable time, and English residents  are glad to descend to the plains. In March also the weather is often  unsettled. The really heavy falls of snow occur at levels much higher  than Simla. These remarks apply _mutatis mutandis_ to Dharmsala,  Dalhousie, and Murree. Owing to its position right under a lofty  mountain wall Dharmsala is a far wetter place than Simla. Murree gets  its monsoon later, and the summer rainfall is a good deal lighter. In  winter it has more snow, being nearer the source of origin of the  storms. Himalayan valleys at an elevation of 5000 feet, such as the Vale  of Kashmir, have a pleasant climate. The mean temperature of Srinagar  (5255 feet) varies from 33 deg. in January to 75 deg. in July, when it is  unpleasantly hot, and Europeans often move to Gulmarg. Kashmir has a  heavy snowfall even in the Jhelam valley. Below 4000 feet, especially in  confined river valleys the Himalayan climate is often disagreeably hot  and stuffy.    ~Climate of the Plains.~--The course of the seasons is the same in the  plains. The jaded resident finds relief when the rains cease in the end  of September. The days are still warm, but the skies are clear, the air  dry, and the nights cool. November is rainless and in every way a  pleasant month. The clouds begin to gather before Christmas, but rain  often holds off till January. Pleasant though the early months of the  cold weather are, they lay traps for the unwary. In October and November  the daily range of temperature is very large, exceeding 30 deg., and the  fall at sunset very sudden. Care is needed to avoid a chill and the  fever that follows. Clear and dry though the air is, the blue of the  skies is pale owing to a light dust haze in the upper atmosphere. For  the same reason the Himalayan snows except after rain are veiled from  dwellers in the plains at a distance of 30 miles from the foot-hills.  The air in these months before the winter rains is wonderfully still. In  the three months after Christmas the Panjab is the pathway of a series  of small storms from the west, preceded by close weather and occurring  usually at intervals of a few weeks. After a day or two of wet weather  the sky clears, and the storm is followed by a great drop in the  temperature. The traveller who shivers after a January rain-storm finds  it hard to believe that the Panjab plain is a part of the hottest region  of the Old"]]]
