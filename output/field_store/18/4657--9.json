The  effective number of parallax stars is therefore essentially reduced.  Indirectly it is nevertheless possible to get a relatively large  catalogue of parallax stars with the help of the ingenious spectroscopic  method of ADAMS, which permits us to determine the absolute magnitude,  and therefore also the distance, of even farther stars through an  examination of the relative intensity of certain lines in the stellar  spectra. It may be that the method is not yet as firmly based as it  should be,[15] but there is every reason to believe that the course  taken is the right one and that the catalogue published by ADAMS of 500  parallax stars in Contrib. from Mount Wilson, 142, already gives a more  complete material than the catalogues of directly measured parallaxes. I  give here a short resume of the attributes of the parallax stars in this  catalogue.    The catalogue of ADAMS embraces stars of the spectral types F, G, K and  M. In order to complete this material by parallaxes of blue stars I add  from the catalogue of WALKEY those stars in his catalogue that belong to  the spectral types B and A, confining myself to stars for which the  parallax may be considered as rather reliable. There are in all 61 such  stars, so that a sum of 561 stars with known distance is to be  discussed.    For all these stars we know _m_ and _M_ and for the great part of them  also the proper motion [mu]. We can therefore for each spectral type  compute the mean values and the dispersion of these attributes. We thus  get the following table, in which I confine myself to the mean values of  the attributes.      TABLE 6.    _MEAN VALUES OF _m_, _M_ AND THE PROPER MOTIONS ([mu]) OF PARALLAX STARS  OF DIFFERENT SPECTRAL TYPES._    +---+-------+-------+-------+-------+  |Sp.|Number |  _m_  |  _M_  | [mu]  |  +---+-------+-------+-------+-------+  | B |  15   | +2.03 | -1.67 | 0\".05 |  | A |  46   | +3.40 | +0.64 | 0.21  |  | F | 125   | +5.60 | +2.10 | 0.40  |  | G | 179   | +5.77 | +1.68 | 0.51  |  | K | 184   | +6.17 | +2.31 | 0.53  |  | M |  42   | +6.02 | +2.30 | 0.82  |  +---+-------+-------+-------+-------+    We shall later consider all parallax stars taken together. We find from  table 6 that the apparent magnitude, as well as the absolute magnitude,  is approximately the same for all yellow and red stars and even for the  stars of type F, the apparent magnitude being approximately equal to +6m  and the absolute magnitude equal to +2m. For type B we find the mean  value of M to be -1m.7 and for type A we find M = +0m.6. The proper  motion also varies in the same way, being for F, G, K, M approximately  0\".5 and for B and A 0\".1. As to the mean values of _M_ and [mu] we  cannot draw distinct conclusions from this material, because the  parallax stars are selected in a certain way which essentially  influences these mean values, as will be more fully discussed below. The  most interesting conclusion to be drawn from the parallax stars is  obtained from their distribution over different values of _M_. In the  memoir referred to, ADAMS has obtained the following table (somewhat  differently arranged from the table of ADAMS),[16] which gives the  number of parallax stars for different values of the absolute magnitude  for different spectral types.    A glance at this table is sufficient to indicate a singular and well  pronounced property in these frequency distributions. We find, indeed,  that in the types G, K and M the frequency curves are evidently  resolvable into two simple curves of distribution. In all these types we  may distinguish between a bright group and a faint group. With a  terminology proposed by HERTZSPRUNG the former group is said to consist  of _giant_ stars, the latter group of _dwarf_ stars. Even in the stars  of type F this division may be suggested. This distinction is still more  pronounced in the graphical representation given in figures (plate IV).

Arguing from these statistics some  astronomers have put forward the theory that the stars in space are  divided into two classes, which are not in reality closely related. The  one class consists of intensely luminous stars and the other of feeble  stars, with little or no transition between the two classes. If the  parallax stars are arranged according to their apparent proper motion,  or even according to their absolute proper motion, a similar bipartition  is revealed in their frequency distribution.    Nevertheless the bipartition of the stars into two such distinct classes  must be considered as vague and doubtful. Such an _apparent_  bipartition is, indeed, necessary in all statistics as soon as  individuals are selected from a given population in such a manner as the  parallax stars are selected from the stars in space. Let us consider  three attributes, say _A_, _B_ and _C_, of the individuals of a  population and suppose that the attribute _C_ is _positively_ correlated  to the attributes _A_ and _B_, so that to great or small values of _A_  or _B_ correspond respectively great or small values of _C_. Now if the  individuals in the population are statistically selected in such a way  that we choose out individuals having great values of the attributes _A_  and small values of the attribute _B_, then we get a statistical series  regarding the attribute _C_, which consists of two seemingly distinct  normal frequency distributions. It is in like manner, however, that the  parallax stars are selected. The reason for this selection is the  following. The annual parallax can only be determined for near stars,  nearer than, say, 5 siriometers. The direct picking out of these stars  is not possible. The astronomers have therefore attacked the problem in  the following way. The near stars must, on account of their proximity,  be relatively brighter than other stars and secondly possess greater  proper motions than those. Therefore parallax observations are  essentially limited to (1) bright stars, (2) stars with great proper  motions. Hence the selected attributes of the stars are _m_ and [mu].  But _m_ and [mu] are both positively correlated to _M_. By the selection  of stars with small _m_ and great [mu] we get a series of stars which  regarding the attribute _M_ seem to be divided into two distinct  classes.    The distribution of the parallax stars gives us no reason to believe  that the stars of the types K and M are divided into the two supposed  classes. There is on the whole no reason to suppose the existence at all  of classes of giant and dwarf stars, not any more than a classification  of this kind can be made regarding the height of the men in a  population. What may be statistically concluded from the distribution of  the absolute magnitudes of the parallax stars is only that the  _dispersion_ in _M_ is increased at the transition from blue to yellow  or red stars. The filling up of the gap between the \"dwarfs\" and the  \"giants\" will probably be performed according as our knowledge of the  distance of the stars is extended, where, however, not the annual  parallax but other methods of measuring the distance must be employed.

Had you been in Tom's place you would have done as he did.\"    These plain words from Dick made George Strong hesitate. He knew the  Rover boys well, and knew that they were generally in the right. More  than this, he had caught Tad Sobber in a falsehood only the day before.    \"You may all go to your rooms and I will see about this later,\" he said.  \"Sobber, as you broke the dishes, you will have to pay for them.\"    \"Can't Rover pay half the bill?\" growled the bully.    \"No, for I cannot see how he is to blame for that.\"    After this some sharp words followed. Tad Sobber was impudent, and as a  consequence was marched off to a storeroom which was occasionally used  as a \"guardhouse\" by the teachers and Captain Putnam. Here he had to  stay in solitary confinement for twenty-four hours and on the plainest  kind of a diet. This imprisonment made Sobber furious, and he vowed he  would get square with Tom and Dick for it if it cost him his life.    \"They may have been able to down other fellows in this school, but they  shan't down me,\" was what he told Nick Pell.    \"Well, you want to go slow in what you do,\" answered Pell. \"I've been  talking to some of the others and I've learned that they got the best of  several fellows who were here at different times--Dan Baxter, Lew Flapp  and some others.\"    \"Humph! I am not afraid of them,\" growled Tad Sobber. \"I suppose they  think, because they are rich and have traveled some, they can lord it  over everybody. Well, I'll show them a trick or two before I'm done with  them.\"    After Tad Sobber came out of confinement the Rover boys thought he might  try to play some underhand trick on Tom, and consequently kept their  eyes open. But nothing developed for some days, and then it came in a  most unexpected way.    The boys settled down to their studies, but it was not in their nature  to go in for all work and no play. On the following Saturday they asked  for permission to visit Cedarville, to buy some things Sam and Tom  needed. They took with them Songbird and Hans, and went on foot, the  weather being ideal for walking. Just before leaving they saw Sobber and  Pell hurry away, also in the direction of the town.    \"I wonder where they are going?\" mused Dick.    \"Sobber is going to take a run by steamboat to Ithaca,\" answered  Songbird. \"I heard him speak to Captain Putnam about it.\"    \"Is Pell going along?\"    \"I don't think so.\"    The three Rover boys and their friends were soon on the way. They felt  in the best of spirits, and Powell could not resist the temptation to  break out into his usual doggerel:        \"I love to roam o'er hill and dale,      In calm or storm or windy gale,      I love the valley and the hill,      The brooklet and the running rill,      I love the broad and placid lake----\"        \"Where we can swim or take a skate,\"    finished Tom, and then went on:        \"And just remember, of the rest,      I love old Putnam Hall the best!\"    \"That last sentiment hits me,\" said Fred. \"Tell you what, fellows, no  place like our school.\"    \"I dink I make me some boetry alretty,\" said Hans, solemnly, and began:        \"I lof to hear der insects hum,      I lof to chew on chewing gum!      I lof to see der moon shine owit----\"        \"And love to eat my sauerkraut,\"    added Tom gaily. \"Songbird, can't you get up some real nice bit of verse  about sauerkraut and Limburger cheese for Hans' benefit?\"    \"The idea of poetry about sauerkraut and Limburger cheese!\" snorted the  verse maker in disgust.    \"Well, anyway, the lines about the cheese would be good and strong,\" was  Dick's comment.    \"A poem about sauerkraut wouldn't do for this automobile age,\" said Sam,  dryly.    \"Why not?\" asked Tom.    \"Because sauerkraut belongs to the cabbage,\" answered the youngest  Rover, and then dodged a blow Tom playfully aimed at him.    \"I shan't try to make up any more verses,\" said Songbird. \"Every time I  try----\"    \"Hullo, here comes a carriage with three young ladies in it,\" called out  Dick.    \"They look familiar to me,\" announced Tom. \"Yes, they are Dora Stanhope  and Grace and Nellie Laning!\" he cried.    \"Well, this is a pleasure,\" said Songbird, and forgot all about what he  was going to say concerning his verse making.    The carriage was soon up to them. It was a two-seated affair, and on the  front seat were Dora and Nellie and in the rear Grace and Mrs. Stanhope.    \"We were going to stop at Putnam Hall for a few minutes,\" said Dora,  after the greetings were over. \"It was such a lovely day we couldn't  resist the temptation to go out for a long drive.\"    \"Sorry we won't be at the Hall to receive you,\" answered Dick, and he  gave Dora such an earnest look that the pretty girl blushed.    \"The girls have something up their sleeve,\" said Mrs. Stanhope. \"And  they wanted to see you and Captain Putnam about it.\"    \"We are getting up a little party,\" announced Nellie. \"It is to come off  at Dora's home some time this fall. We wanted to find out if Captain  Putnam would let you and a few of your friends come over.\"    \"Oh, he'll have to let us come!\" cried Tom. \"Why, I wouldn't miss a  party for anything!\" And he said this so comically that all of the girls  laughed.    \"We haven't set any date yet,\" said Grace. \"But you'll speak to Captain  Putnam about it, won't you? We thought you might make up a party of say  eight or ten boys, and come over in the carryall.\"    \"It's as good as done,\" announced Sam, with a profound bow. \"Please put  me down on your card for the first two-step.\"    \"Und put me town for a dree-steps,\" added Hans, and at this there was  another laugh.    \"I don't know whether we'll have dancing or not,\" said Mrs. Stanhope.  \"But we'll try to have a good time.\"    \"Who do you want us to invite--if we can come?\" questioned Dick.    \"Oh, Dick, we'll leave that to you. Of course we want all who were on  the houseboat,\" and Dora looked at the Rovers and Songbird and Hans.    \"With Fred that will make six. Shall I ask Larry Colby and George  Granbury?\"    \"If you want to--and two more. But please don't ask those boys we just  met,\" went on Dora, hastily.    \"You mean Tad Sobber and Nick Pell?\" questioned Tom, quickly.    \"One called the other Nick. He was a very large lad,\" said Mrs.  Stanhope.    \"Sobber and Pell sure,\" murmured Tom. \"What did they do?\"    \"Stood right in the middle of the road and would not get out of the  way,\" explained Grace. \"I think they were perfectly horrid!\"    \"They made us drive around to one side and we nearly went into a ditch,\"  added Dora.    \"And then, after we had passed, they burst out laughing at us,\"  continued Nellie. \"They certainly weren't a bit nice.\"    \"We'll have to settle with Sobber and Pell for this,\" said Dick, and his  face took on a serious look that bode no good for the cadets who had  played so ungallant a part towards his lady friends.          CHAPTER XIV    AT THE ICE-CREAM ESTABLISHMENT      The Lanings and the Stanhopes had been in the best of health since  returning from the south. Mrs. Stanhope was no more the pale and  delicate person she had been, and her former nervous manner was entirely  gone. The cheeks of the three girls were like roses, and it was no  wonder that the Rovers thought them the nicest young ladies in the whole  world.    \"Wish we were in a carriage,\" observed Tom, after the turnout had gone  on. \"Then we might have gone for a drive together.\"    \"I know what Tom would like,\" said Sam. \"A nice buggy and a slow horse,  and Nellie beside him----\"    \"Humph, please change the names to Sam and Grace and you'll hit it  closer,\" answered Tom, his face growing red.    \"I'm going to make up a poem about them some day,\" said Songbird. \"I  shall call it--let me see--ah, yes--The Three Fair Maidens of  Cedarville.\"    \"Don't!\" cried Dick. \"Songbird, if you dare to do anything like  that----\"    \"You'll have to leave Dora out anyway,\" said Tom. \"If you don't, Dick  will get in your wool sure. He----\"    \"Say, what about Sobber and Pell?\" broke in the eldest Rover, his face  quite red. \"I feel like punishing them for making the ladies drive into  the ditch.\"    \"We'll remember it,\" answered Sam. \"If we catch them in Cedarville let's  speak of it and see what they have to say for themselves.\"    \"Speaking about a party,\" observed Songbird, as they approached the  village, \"do you realize that we haven't had any sort of a feast at the  Hall since we got back to the grind?\"    \"Fred was saying the same thing only a few days ago,\" answered Tom. \"We  certainly ought to have some sort of a blow-out.\"    \"Vot you vos going to plow owid?\" asked Hans innocently.    \"Blow out the stuffings from a mince pie, Hansy.\"    \"Vere you vos plow dem to, Dom?\"    \"Blow them into your stomach. Have a spread--a feast--a fill-up, so to  speak--something to eat, cheese, sandwiches, cake, pie, pudding, jam,  oranges, bananas, lard, salt, plum pudding, toothpicks, ice-cream,  turnips, and other delicacies,\" went on the fun-loving Rover, rapidly.    \"Ach, yah, I understand now, ain't it! I like dem feasts. Ve haf him in  von of der pedrooms alretty yet, hey?\"    \"If the crowd is willing,\" said Sam. \"For one, I vote in favor of it.\"    \"Second the nomination,\" put in Tom, promptly. \"It is elected by a  unanimous vote we have a feast at the school, some night in the near  future, at eleven o'clock, G. M.\"    The idea of a feast pleased all the boys. They always got enough to eat  during regular meal hours at the Hall, but there was something enticing  in the idea of having a feast on the sly some night in one of the  dormitories. They had had a number of such in the past and these had  been productive of a good deal of sport.    \"Let us go down to the steamboat landing and see if we can "]]]
