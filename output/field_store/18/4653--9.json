One morning I went early to the beaver pond and sat down against a gray  stump on the shore, with berry bushes growing to my shoulders all about  me. \"Now I shall keep still and see everything that comes,\" I thought,  \"and nothing, not even a blue jay, will see me.\"    That was almost true. Little birds, that had never seen a man in the  woods before, came for the berries and billed them off within six feet  of my face before they noticed anything unusual. When they did see me  they would turn their heads so as to look at me, first with one eye,  then with the other, and shoot up at last, with a sharp _Burr!_ of their  tiny wings, to a branch over my head. There they would watch me keenly,  for a wink or a minute, according to their curiosity, then swoop down  and whirr their wings loudly in my face, so as to make me move and show  what I was.    Across a little arm of the pond, a stone's throw away, a fine buck came  to the water, put his muzzle into it, then began to fidget uneasily.  Some vague, subtle flavor of me floated across and made him uneasy,  though he knew not what I was. He kept tonguing his nostrils, as a cow  does, so as to moisten them and catch the scent of me better. On my  right, and nearer, a doe was feeding unconcernedly among the lily pads.  A mink ran, hopping and halting, along the shore at my feet, dodging in  and out among roots and rocks. Cheokhes always runs that way. He knows  how glistening black his coat is, how shining a mark he makes for owl  and hawk against the sandy shore; and so he never runs more than five  feet without dodging out of sight; and he always prefers the roots and  rocks that are blackest to travel on.    A kingfisher dropped with his musical _K'plop!_ into the shoal of  minnows that were rippling the water in their play just in front of me.  Farther out, a fishhawk came down heavily, _Souse!_ and rose with a big  chub. And none of these sharp-eyed wood folk saw me or knew that they  were watched. Then a wide, wavy, blue line, like a great Cupid's bow,  came gliding swiftly along the opposite bank of green, and Quoskh hove  into sight for his morning's fishing.    Opposite me, just where the buck had stood, he folded his great wings;  his neck crooked sharply; his long legs, which had been trailed  gracefully behind him in his swift flight, swung under him like two  pendulums as he landed lightly on the muddy shore. He knew his ground  perfectly; knew every stream and frog-haunted bay in the pond as one  knows his own village; yet no amount of familiarity with his  surroundings can ever sing lullaby to Quoskh's watchfulness. The instant  he landed he drew himself up straight, standing almost as tall as a man,  and let his keen glance run along every shore just once. His head, with  its bright yellow eye and long yellow beak glistening in the morning  light, veered and swung over his long neck like a gilded weather-vane on  a steeple. As the vane swung up the shore toward me I held my breath, so  as to be perfectly motionless, thinking I was hidden so well that no eye  could find me at that distance. As it swung past me slowly I chuckled,  thinking that Quoskh was deceived. I forgot altogether that a bird never  sees straight ahead. When his bill had moved some thirty degrees off my  nose, just enough so as to bring his left eye to bear, it stopped  swinging instantly.--He had seen me at the first glance, and knew that I  did not belong there.    For a long moment, while his keen eye seemed to look through and through  me, he never moved a muscle. One could easily have passed over him,  thinking him only one of the gray, wave-washed roots on the shore. Then  he humped himself together, in that indescribably awkward way that all  herons have at the beginning of their flight, slanted heavily up to the  highest tree on the shore, and stopped for a longer period on a dead  branch to look back at me. I had not moved so much as an eyelid;  nevertheless he saw me too plainly to trust me. Again he humped himself,  rose high over the tree-tops and bore away in strong, even, graceful  flight for a lonelier lake, where there was no man to watch or bother  him.    Far from disappointing me, this keenness of Quoskh only whetted my  appetite to know more about him, and especially to watch him, close at  hand, at his fishing. Near the head of the little bay, where frogs were  plenty, I built a screen of boughs under the low thick branches of a  spruce tree, and went away to watch other wood folk.    Next morning he did not come back; nor were there any fresh tracks of  his on the shore. This was my first intimation that Quoskh knows well  the rule of good fishermen, and does not harry a pool or a place too  frequently, however good the fishing. The third morning he came back;  and again the sixth evening; and then the ninth morning, alternating  with great regularity as long as I kept tabs on him. At other times I  would stumble upon him far afield, fishing in other lakes and streams;  or see him winging homeward, high over the woods, from waters far beyond  my ken; but these appearances were too irregular to count in a theory. I  have no doubt, however, that he fished the near-by waters with as great  regularity as he fished the beaver pond, and went wider afield only when  he wanted a bit of variety, or bigger frogs, as all fishermen do; or  when he had poor luck in satisfying the clamorous appetite of his  growing brood.    It was on the sixth afternoon that I had the best chance of studying his  queer ways of fishing. I was sitting in my little blind at the beaver  pond, waiting for a deer, when Quoskh came striding along the shore. He  would swing his weather-vane head till he saw a frog ahead, then stalk  him slowly, deliberately, with immense caution; as if he knew as well as  I how watchful the frogs are at his approach, and how quickly they dive  headlong for cover at the first glint of his stilt-like legs. Nearer and  nearer he would glide, standing motionless as a gray root when he  thought his game was watching him; then on again more cautiously,  bending far forward and drawing his neck back to the angle of greatest  speed and power for a blow. A quick start, a thrust like lightning--then  you would see him shake his frog savagely, beat it upon the nearest  stone or root, glide to a tuft of grass, hide his catch cunningly, and  go on unincumbered for the next stalk, his weather-vane swinging,  swinging in the ceaseless search for frogs, or possible enemies.    If the swirl of a fish among the sedges caught his keen eye, he would  change his tactics, letting his game come to him instead of stalking it,  as he did with the frogs. Whatever his position was, both feet down or  one foot raised for a stride, when the fish appeared, he never changed  it, knowing well that motion would only send his game hurriedly into  deeper water. He would stand sometimes for a half hour on one leg,  letting his head sink slowly down on his shoulders, his neck curled  back, his long sharp bill pointing always straight at the quivering line  which marked the playing fish, his eyes half closed till the right  moment came. Then you would see his long neck shoot down, hear the  splash and, later, the whack of his catch against the nearest root, to  kill it; and watch with curious feelings of sympathy as he hid it in the  grass and covered it over, lest Hawahak the hawk should see, or Cheokhes  the mink smell it, and rob him while he fished.    If he were near his last catch, he would stride back and hide the two  together; if not, he covered it over in the nearest good place and went  on. No danger of his ever forgetting, however numerous the catch!  Whether he counts his frogs and fish, or simply remembers the different  hiding places, I have no means of knowing.    Sometimes, when I surprised him on a muddy shore and he flew away  without taking even one of his tidbits, I would follow his back track  and uncover his hiding places to see what he had caught. Frogs, fish,  pollywogs, mussels, a baby muskrat,--they were all there, each hidden  cunningly under a bit of dried grass and mud. And once I went away and  hid on the opposite shore to see if he would come back. After an hour or  more he appeared, looking first at my tracks, then at all the shore with  greater keenness than usual; then he went straight to three different  hiding places that I had found, and two more that I had not seen, and  flew away to his nest, a fringe of frogs and fish hanging at either side  of his long bill as he went.    He had arranged them on the ground like the spokes of a wheel, as a fox  does, heads all out on either side, and one leg or the tail of each  crossed in a common pile in the middle; so that he could bite down over  the crossed members and carry the greatest number of little frogs and  fish with the least likelihood of dropping any in his flight.    The mussels which he found were invariably, I think, eaten as his own  particular tidbits; for I never saw him attempt to carry them away,  though once I found two or three where he had hidden them. Generally he  could crack their shells easily by blows of his powerful beak, or by  whacking them against a root; and so he had no need (and probably no  knowledge) of the trick, which every gull knows, of mounting up to a  height with some obstinate hardshell and dropping it on a rock to crack  it.    If Quoskh were fishing for his own dinner, instead of for his hungry  nestlings, he adopted different tactics. For them he was a hunter, sly,  silent, crafty, stalking his game by approved still-hunting methods; for  himself he was the true fisherman, quiet, observant, endlessly patient.  He seemed to know that for himself he could afford to take his time and  be comfortable,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22107"],[0,"Wood-Carving: Design and Workmanship (#12)"],[1,"or partitions, stair newels, and  balusters, or it may be used as a cornice decoration in the manner  suggested by No. 26, where the pierced work can be backed by a hollow  cornice which it fills and enriches.    In our next exercise we shall try our hands upon a piece of hardwood for  a change--meantime do one or two of these fret patterns by way of  disciplinary exercise in outline forms.          CHAPTER XIV    HARDWOOD CARVING           Carvings can not be Independent Ornaments--Carving Impossible on       Commercial Productions--The Amateur Joiner--Corner       Cupboards--Introduction of Foliage Definite in Form, and Simple in       Character--Methods of Carving Grapes.      We now come to the question, what are we going to do with all the pieces  of carving which we propose to undertake.    There is no more inexorable law relating to the use of wood-carving than  the one which insists upon some kind of passport for its introduction,  wherever it appears. It must come in good company, and be properly  introduced. The slightest and most distant connection with a recognized  sponsor is often sufficient, but it will not be received alone. We do  not make carvings to hang on a wall and be admired altogether on their  own account. They must decorate some object. A church screen, a font, a  piece of furniture, or even the handle of a knife. It is not always an  easy matter to find suitable objects upon which to exercise our  wood-carving talents. Our furniture is all made now in a wholesale  manner which permits of no interference with its construction, while at  the same time, if we wish to put any carving upon it, it is absolutely  essential that both construction and decoration should be considered  together.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.]    A very modest beginning may be made in adapting ornament to a useful  article, by carving the surface of a bread plate. These are usually made  of some hard wood, such as sycamore. They may be made of oak, but  sycamore has the advantage in its lighter color, which is more likely to  be kept clean. Two suggestions are given in Figs. 27 and 28 for carving  appropriate to this purpose. The essentials are, that there should be a  well-defined _pattern_ simple in construction, and as effective as  possible with little labor; that there should be little or no rounding  of surface, the design consisting of gouge cuts and incisions arranged  to express the pattern. The incisions may form a regular sunk ground,  but it should not be deep, or it will not be easily kept clean. Then, as  in cutting bread the knife comes in contact with the surface, no  delicate work is advisable; a large treatment with broad surfaces, and  some plain spaces left to protect the carved work, is likely to prove  satisfactory in every way. A piece of sycamore should be procured, ready  for carving; this may be got from a wood-turner, but it will be as well  to give him a drawing, on which is shown the section of edge and the  position of all turned lines required for confining the carving. If the  plate is to be of any shape other than circular, then it must be neatly  made by a joiner, unless you can shape it yourself.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.]    Many of you are, I have no doubt, handy joiners, and may with a little  help put together some slight pieces of furniture to serve at least as  an excuse for the introduction of your carving. Here are some  suggestions for corner cupboards, chosen as giving the largest area for  carved surface with the minimum of expense in construction. The material  should be oak--English if possible, or it may be Italian walnut. The  doors of Figs. 40 and 41 are in three narrow boards with shallow beads  at the joints, those of the others are each made of a single board, and  should be 1/2 in. to 5/8 in. thick, the doors may be about 2 ft. 6 ins.  high, each having two ledges about 3 ins. wide, screwed on behind top  and bottom to keep them from twisting. All moldings, beads, etc., are to  be carved by hand, no planes being used. Having traced the lines of your  design upon the board, you may begin, if there are moldings as in Fig.  32, by using a joiner's marking gage to groove out the deepest parts of  the parallel lines in the moldings along the edges, doing the same to  the curved ones with a V tool or Veiner. Then form the moldings with  your chisels or gouges. Keep them very flat in section as in Fig. 29.  The fret patterns on Figs. 32, 35, and 36, where not pierced, should  also be done in low relief, not more than 1/8 in. deep, and the sides of  the bands beveled as in section _a_, Fig 30. The widths of these bands  ought not to be less than 1/2 in., and look better if they are wider.  Very narrow bands have a better appearance, if, instead of being cut  straight down, they are hollowed at sides like _b_ in Fig. 30.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.]    [Illustration: FIG. 30.]    [Illustration: FIG. 31.]    Fig. 31 is a detail of a kind of gouge work which you must all know very  well. One perpendicular cut of a gouge driven in with the mallet, and  one side cut, should form one of these crescent or thimble-shaped holes.  They should not be too deep in proportion to their size. Their  combinations may be varied to a great extent. Two or three common ones  are shown in the illustration. This form of ornament was in all  likelihood invented by some ingenious carpenter with a turn for art and  a limited stock of carving tools. His humble contribution to the  resources of the carver's art has received its due share of the flattery  which is implied by imitation. In all these patterns it is well to  remember that the flat surface of the board left between the cuts is  really the important thing to consider, as all variety is obtained by  disposing the holes in such a way as to produce the pattern required by  means of their outlines on the plain surface. Thus waved lines are  produced as in Fig. 31, and little niches like mimic architecture as in  Fig. 34, by the addition of the triangular-shaped holes at the top, and  the splayed sills at the bottom. (It is obvious that an arrangement like  the latter should never be turned upside down.) If this attention to the  surface pattern is neglected the holes are apt to become mere confused  and meaningless spots.    In small pieces of furniture like these, which are made of comparatively  thin wood, the carving need not have much depth, say the ground is sunk  1/4 in. at the deepest. As oak is more tenacious than pine, you will  find greater freedom in working it, although it is so much harder to  cut. You may find it necessary to use the mallet for the greater part of  the blocking out, but it need not be much used in finishing. A series of  short strokes driven by gentle taps of the mallet will often make a  better curve than if the same is attempted without its aid.    It will be well now to procure the remainder of the set of twenty-four  tools if you have not already got them, as they will be required for the  foliage we are about to attempt. The deep gouges are especially useful:  having two different sweeps on each tool, they adapt themselves to  hollows which change in section as they advance.    Fig. 32 contains very little foliage, such as there is being disposed in  small diamond-shaped spaces, sunk in the face of the doors, and a small  piece on the bracket below. All this work should be of a very simple  character, definite in form and broad in treatment.    [Illustration: FIG. 31. _Half_]    [Illustration: FIG. 32. _Half_]    Fig. 33 is more elaborate, but on much the same lines of design varied  by having a larger space filled with groups of leaves. Fig. 34 gives the  carving to a larger scale; in it the oak-leaves are shown with raised  veins in the center, the others being merely indicated by the gouge  hollows. There is some attempt in this at a more natural mode of  treating the foliage. While such work is being carved, it is well to  look now and then at the natural forms themselves (oak and laurel in  this case) in order to note their characteristic features, and as a  wholesome check on the dangers of mannerism.    It is a general axiom founded upon the evidence of past work, and a  respect for the laws of construction in the carpenter's department, that  when foliage appears in panels divided by plain spaces, it should never  be made to look as if it grew _from one panel into the other_, with the  suggestion of boughs passing behind the solid parts. This is a  characteristic of Japanese work, and may, perhaps, be admirable when  used in delicate painted decorations on a screen or other light  furniture, but in carvings it disturbs the effect of solidity in the  material, and serves no purpose which can not be attained in a much  better way.    [Illustration: CARVING IN PANELS OF FIG 33 FIG. 34.]    Expedients have been invented to overcome the difficulty of making a  fresh start in each panel, one of which is shown in Fig. 34, where the  beginning of the bough is hidden under a leaf. It is presumable that the  bough _may_ go on behind the uncarved portions of the board to reappear  in another place, but we need not insist upon the fancy, which loses all  its power when attention is called to it, like riddles when the answer  is known.    [Illustration: FIG. 35.]    [Illustration: FIG. 36.]    In Fig. 35, like the last, the treatment is somewhat realistic. This is  shown to a larger scale in Fig. 38. Nevertheless, it has all been  \"arranged\" to fit its allotted space, and all accidental elements  eliminated; such, for instance, as leaves disappearing in violent  perspective, or even turned sidewise, and all minute details which would  not be likely to show conspicuously if carved in wood. In Fig. 39, (_a_)  is an outline of a group of vine-leaves taken from nature, as it  appeared, and in which state it is quite unfitted for carving, on  account of its complicated perspective and want of definite"]]]
