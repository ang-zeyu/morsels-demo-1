Just then Slugger Brown peered out into the hallway and saw the two  Rover boys. He looked somewhat startled, and immediately placed his  hand over Nappy Martell's mouth.    \"I want to see you, Martell,\" cried Fred without hesitation. \"I want to  know what you did with my suitcase.\"    \"I don't know anything about your suitcase,\" growled the loudly dressed  youth in surly tones.    \"Yes, you do! You took it; and I want you to return it,\" answered Fred,  boldly.    \"See here! do you want a licking?\" burst out the New York boy, as he  doubled up his fists. \"You deserve one for the way you tripped me up in  that mud puddle. You say another word, and I'll give you what's coming  to you,\" and his manner was very threatening.    \"No use of fighting here, Nappy,\" remonstrated Slugger Brown. \"Keep it  until some time when you can meet him outside.\"    \"I didn't come here to fight,\" answered Fred. \"But I want my suitcase.\"    \"I don't know anything about your suitcase. Who says I took it?\" added  Nappy Martell with sudden suspicion.    \"I say you took it. There wouldn't be anyone else here to play such a  trick on me. Now, you must hand it over!\"    \"You go on about your business!\" roared the New York boy; and as Fred,  followed by Jack, attempted to enter the room, he slammed the door in  their faces and shot the bolt into place.    Fred was thoroughly angry, and if it had not been for his cousin he  would have tried then and there to batter the door down. But Jack  caught him by the arm and pulled him back.    \"No use of creating a disturbance so soon,\" said Jack. \"We'd only get  into hot water, and maybe Colonel Colby would become so disgusted he  would send us right home. If Martell took that suitcase, he won't dare  to keep it, for that would be stealing. More than likely he'll sneak it  back to you by to-morrow.\"    \"He ought to have his head knocked off of him,\" muttered the youngest  Rover. \"Jack, I feel in my bones that that fellow is going to cause us  a lot of trouble.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder,\" was the answer. \"Remember, Fred; he is as angry  at me for the row we had down in Wall Street as he is at you over that  mud-puddle affair.\"    \"Oh, dear! And I thought everything was going to be lovely when we got  here,\" sighed Fred.    There seemed nothing else to do, and so the two boys returned to where  they had left the others. A little while later their trunks came in,  and all spent an hour or more in unpacking these and stowing away the  various articles brought along.    \"You'll be measured for your uniforms to-morrow,\" announced Spouter.  \"And then, if the school has the right sizes on hand, you'll get them  at once. Otherwise, they'll be made to order and you'll have to wait at  least ten days for them.\"    \"Oh, I hope they've got my size in stock!\" cried Andy. \"I'd like to see  how it feels being a cadet.\"    \"Don't worry,\" answered his twin. \"I guess we'll get enough of that  before we leave Colby Hall. Remember, you've got to learn how to drill,  and march, and shoot at a target, and all that.\"    \"I think it'll be lots of fun,\" broke in Jack. \"My father told me he  liked that part of the life at Putnam Hall very much.\"    \"We're pretty well filled up here, it seems to me,\" came from Fred, as  he sat on his empty trunk surveying his surroundings.    \"The men will come to take the trunks away in a little while,\" answered  Fatty; and this proved to be so. With the trunks gone the boys had more  room in which to move about, for which they were thankful.    \"How about supper?\" questioned Andy, presently, as a bell rang out  sharply.    \"We have supper at six o'clock sharp,\" returned Fatty, quickly.    \"Last year we were at a table with Professor Grawson,\" put in Spouter.  \"He's a pretty nice man. I hope I get at his table again.\"    \"Excuse me from getting at a table with a man like Professor Lemm,\"  burst out Andy. \"Gee! what will I do if they put me with him?\" he  continued dolefully.    \"Well, you'll have to sit wherever you are placed,\" answered Spouter.    \"And what do you care so long as you get enough to eat?\" questioned  Fatty.    But Andy shook his head. He thought if he were placed at the same table  with Professor Asa Lemm, it would be an actual hardship.          CHAPTER X    GETTING ACQUAINTED      \"I don't see him anywhere,\" remarked Andy, as he and his cousins  approached the mess hall of the school.    The cadets were entering in little groups of twos and threes, for as  yet the regular term at Colby Hall had not begun. With the real opening  of the school, the cadets would have a dress parade previous to dining  and would then stack their arms outside and march in in regular order.    \"Who are you talking about?\" questioned Fred.    \"Professor Asa Lemm. I don't see him at any of the tables.\"    \"Maybe he didn't come to the Hall to-night. He might have had quite  some business to transact with that man who left the train with him.\"    As there were more tables than professors, some of the boards were  presided over by the senior cadets. There was a little confusion, due  to the entrance of so many new pupils, and then the Rovers were  assigned to a table presided over by a senior named Ralph Mason, who  was the major of the school battalion.    \"I am glad to meet you,\" said Major Mason, as he shook hands cordially.  \"I hope you will make yourselves at home,\" and he smiled in a manner  that won the confidence of all the boys at once.    The meal was a good, substantial one--for Colonel Colby believed in  setting a homelike table--and soon the clatter of knives and forks and  the rattle of dishes filled the air. Most of the boys had come in from  long journeys and were, consequently, hungry, so but little was said  while the meal progressed. Spouter and Fatty and several other boys  they had met sat at a table next to that occupied by the Rovers, but  Nappy Martell and his cronies were on the opposite side of the mess  hall, for which our friends were thankful.    \"I think if I had to look at the face of Codfish while I was eating, it  would spoil my appetite,\" was Andy's comment during the meal. \"They  ought to photograph his mouth and put it in the comic supplements.\"    \"Yes. Or else they ought to get him to act in some of the funny  movies,\" returned his twin.    As soon as the repast was at an end, Fred sought out Professor Brice  and asked him if anything had been learned concerning the missing  suitcase.    \"I am sorry to say I haven't learned anything,\" answered the professor,  a troubled look coming over his face. \"I really must say, Rover, I  don't know what to make of it. Do you suspect anyone in particular of  having taken it?\"    Fred was on the point of mentioning Nappy Martell's name, but suddenly  held himself in check.    \"I wouldn't like to say anything about that, Professor,\" he answered  slowly. \"I might be accusing a fellow cadet unfairly. If the suitcase  isn't returned by to-morrow I may have something to say about it.\"    \"Very well. I think I understand how you feel about it,\" and the young  professor looked knowingly at the boy. \"Did you have much in the  suitcase?\"    \"Yes, sir. It was well packed. You see, I wasn't sure whether my trunk  would come right along, so I carried all I could in my handbaggage.\"    When Fred joined the others, all of the crowd, led by Spouter, walked  down to the gymnasium. Here the Rovers were introduced to a number of  other pupils, including Ned Lowe, who was quite a mandolin player and  also a good singer, and a tall, studious youth named Dan Soppinger.    \"Ned is our great singer,\" announced Spouter. \"We expect some day that  he'll be singing in grand opera on the Metropolitan stage.\"    \"Did you say grand opera or grand uproar?\" questioned Andy, slyly.    \"Opera, my boy! Opera!\" repeated Spouter. \"I expect some day that he  will thrill great audiences with exquisite renderings of the famous  solos by Wagner, Beethoven, Mozart, Donizetti----\"    \"Great mackerel, Spouter! what are you giving us--a musical directory?\"  interrupted Randy.    \"No. I was only giving you a list of the things I expect to hear Ned  sing sooner or later. Now, as for Dan here--he is the human  encyclopedia.\"    \"If there is anything you don't want to know, ask Dan and he'll be sure  to tell you all about it,\" put in Fatty with a grin. \"How about it,  Dan?\"    \"Say! that's a fine way to introduce a fellow,\" cried Dan Soppinger,  with a doubtful grin on his studious face. \"Of course, I'm trying to  learn as much as possible, but there are a whole lot of things that I  don't know, and I'm not ashamed to acknowledge it. But say! by the way,  can any of you tell me what the date was when Jefferson was inaugurated  president?\"    At this question there came a sudden groan, not only from Fatty, but  also from Spouter and Ned Lowe. Then with one voice the three shouted:    \"Down with him! He's at it again!\"    \"I don't believe any of you know the date,\" retorted Dan Soppinger. \"If  you did, you'd tell me. I am writing an article about the presidents,  and I've got to put that in. And then, here's another thing. Can any of  you tell me who crossed the Pacific Ocean to----\"    But whatever the question was, it was never finished, for at that  moment Spouter, Fatty, Ned and several others piled on Dan Soppinger  and brought him to the gymnasium floor.    \"Hi! You let up!\" cried the victim, squirming from under the others as  best he could. \"Ca"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21899"],[0,"A Rip Van Winkle Of The Kalahari (#12)"],[1,"white and sparkled so when seen through the rippling surface.    Stretched upon the white sand lay the chalk-white skeleton of a man,  the grinning mouth and sightless eyes staring up at me in a hideous  travesty of mirth; and all around between the outstretched bones lay  diamonds, diamonds innumerable: big, bright, sparkling beauties by the  handful, wealth incredible to be had for the picking up, with no  guardian other than these bare bones of a long dead man.    The shock of coming face to face with this grim \"memento mori\" here in  the depths of the pool was too much even for my desire for the  diamonds, and I struck frantically for the surface, clambering out in  wild, senseless, unreasoning fear, and not even pausing till I was well  away from the vicinity of this spot, which had been my favorite resting  place for so long. And that night I tried in vain to sleep, my brain  whirling with wild surmises, as to how the long-dead man had found his  way into the crater. Was there a path after all, or had he used a rope  to let himself down in search of the diamonds, only to meet his death  in some manner where they lay thickest?    Or had he, perchance, passed years in the trap, vainly endeavoring to  find a way out, pacing day after day round the ring of encircling  cliffs, until at last, in utter despair, he had thrown himself into the  pool to end it all, and to leave his bones there watching the treasure  he could not take with him?    Each time I closed my eyes the mocking, grinning skeleton seemed to be  again before me, and it was not till early morning that I could rest.  But with the day my fears vanished; indeed what was there to fear, for  how could these few poor bones harm me?    Still, I could not bring myself to dive into the pool again, but set  about devising some other means of getting the diamonds. An empty  gourd, cut into the shape of a bowl, and lashed to a stick, solved the  difficulty, and with this primitive dredge I brought up diamonds  sufficient for a king's ransom; so many indeed that long before night  even I was satisfied. Large lustrous stones they were, of splendid  water, and several of them were blue, though none were as fine as the  one Inyati had given me. ...    So here was wealth far beyond my wildest dreams, and if I could but  escape then, even disfigured as I was, life might still hold pleasures  for me.    Even if the girl who had sent me to this turned away in horror from my  hideous disfigurements, there was much that money could bring travel,  adventure, sport, a thousand things and, at any rate, the companionship  of rational beings, for which I now craved as I had craved for water in  the desert. For God knows how long I had seen no human being no living  creature indeed but a few birds and I had almost forgotten the sound of  a human voice. Sunk in apathy I had become almost as a beast, but the  sight of the diamonds had aroused me, and I recalled how poor Inyati  had called them \"magic stones.\" Magic indeed, for they had saved my  reason.    And with the sight of all this wealth the desire to escape grew  stronger, and with it grew a hatred of my hitherto pleasant prison  until the thought of remaining in it became intolerable to me. That  very evening I began a minute examination of my prison walls; but it  was not till several days had passed that I at length discovered a  route where here a crack, there a tiny ledge, and again a small  projection, offered a precarious chance of foot or hand-hold, and  where, if anywhere at all, a human being might essay the terrible climb  to the desert above, with a remote chance of success. My mind made up  on this point, I made what preparation I could for the climb, and for  the desert beyond it. My water bottle was still sound, and little as it  held it must suffice. For food I killed a number of the partridges and  roasted them, cutting away their plump breasts from the bone, for I  realized that in the terrible climb before me every ounce would tell;  my knife, revolver, and a few cartridges I made a belt for by plaiting  the strong coarse grass that grew near the water, and of the same  material I made a hat, for I remembered, only too well, that I should  find no shade in the desert should I succeed in my desperate attempt.    Shoes I had none, but this did not trouble me, for my feet were  hardened to the consistency of leather. The diamonds I made into a  bundle with some shreds of clothing, and stowed them in the canvas  haversack, except for Inyati's and a few other blue ones which I  luckily put in my pocket.    All these belongings I conveyed one evening to the foot of the cliff up  which I intended attempting to climb, sleeping at the spot so as to be  ready and fresh for a start at daybreak. I feared little as to my  strength, for in spite of my injuries I was now stronger than I had  ever been; but what I did fear was vertigo. From a child I had always  had a horror of looking down from a great height, feeling an almost  irresistible desire to throw myself down whenever I did so, and I  feared that as I neared the top this would happen and I should be  dashed again to the floor of the crater.    But better that and death than this endless captivity; and I did not  shrink from my formidable undertaking. At early dawn I drank deep from  the gushing water that I was leaving, and fastening on my load I began  to climb. For a time all went well, though of necessity my progress was  but slow, and the sun was full overhead when I halted for a rest on a  small ledge about half way up. Here for the first time since I started  I could lie at full length without having to hold on, and I needed the  rest, for the strain had been terrific, and I feared that the worst  part of the climb was still to come.    So far, I had resisted all inclination to look down, but shortly after  leaving the ledge I was compelled to do so. I had been following a  crack running diagonally up from it, and which from below had appeared  to connect with another ledge favorable to me, but to my consternation  I found that this was not the case, ten or twelve feet of absolutely  smooth and vertical rock cutting me off from my coveted path to  freedom. I was flattened against the wall, my heels overhanging the  abyss, clutching with one hand a projection above me, and feeling with  my other for a new grip; but the rock was as smooth as polished marble,  and it was evident that I must work back to the ledge I had rested on  and try for a new route. And to do this I had of necessity to look  down. As I did so the deadly vertigo I feared so much came over me, and  it was well that I had good hand and foothold, or I should certainly  have fallen. As it was I clung helpless, sick, and giddy, with closed  eyes for some time, and it was only by the strongest effort of my will  that I could force myself to again open them, and work my way gradually  back to the little ledge. There I threw myself down, panting and deadly  sick, the whole world seeming to spin round me; and there I lay for  some time inert and helpless, before I could brace myself sufficiently  for a further effort. At length I roused myself and started up again in  another direction, towards where I could see a few stunted bushes  growing, and here to my joy I found a wider ledge than the last,  leading steeply upwards. It came to an end, however, far below the  cliff top; moreover, at this part the top actually overhung me, and it  was evident I must attempt to work my way farther round before climbing  higher. To add to my anxiety I noticed now that evening was fast  approaching and I realized that I had but little daylight left to me,  and should darkness find me still clinging like a fly to the face of  the cliff my fate was certain. I was almost exhausted, and my heart  sank as I searched in vain for a way up. The distance was not great  now, a bare fifty feet separating me from the topmost pinnacle, but  though I walked along the bottom of this barrier for some distance it  still presented the same insurmountable difficulties.    And the sun had set, and dusk was already falling, when half frantic  with fear, I at length made out a crevice which appeared to offer a  possible means of saving my life. It ran diagonally across the rock at  a steep angle upwards, going out of my sight around a big buttress that  overhung me, and I could not tell whether it reached to the actual top  or not. But it was my only chance, and with my heart in my mouth I made  my way towards it. I could just reach it, and setting my teeth and  summoning all my courage, I gripped it fast and made my way gradually  upward. For a few yards my feet found a little foothold to help me, but  soon I was dangling over the awful abyss. I dare not think of what lay  below me, but with set teeth, and muscles cracking with the strain, I  edged gradually along till I rounded the buttress face, and here within  ten feet of the summit I found scanty foothold again. Here I stood  quivering and exhausted till I had regained my breath, and then in the  fast waning light I examined the few feet of rock that still stood  between me and freedom. Barely two feet above my outstretched hand was  the pinnacle that formed the edge of the cliff, but how was I to reach  it? To spring from my precarious foothold was impossible, and not the  slightest hold could I find for my fingers anywhere to draw myself up.  Night was now upon me, to return to the ledge was out of the question,  and I knew that I could not cling for long where I was, but that long  before daylight came again I must fall into the awful abyss that yawned  beneath me. God! to die like this after all my struggle, to die within  a few inches of freedom. Had I but a rope! And with the thought came  inspiration. The sling of the haversack! It was of stout, strong  canvas, and might hold could I but throw the loop over the pinnacle. It  was a poor chance but my only"]]]
