I think if you were there with your present  feelings, you would be afraid to stay. It would seem like mocking God to  come to answer all those solemn questions, and not mean what you said.  I think it is wicked.\"    Louis spoke rapidly, and with great emotion.    Meredith looked angry, struggling with a feeling of shame, and a wish to  laugh it off. \"You are exclusively precise,\" he said; \"others are not,  and have as much right to their opinion as you to yours. Trevannion,  for instance--he's going into the church because it is so genteel.\"    \"I hope you are mistaken,\" said Louis, quickly.    \"Not I; I heard him say the same thing myself.\"    \"I am _very_ sorry,\" said Louis, sadly. \"Oh! I would rather be a laborer  than go into the church with such a wish--and yet, I had rather be a  very poor curate than a rich duke: it is such a happy, holy life.\" The  last part of Louis' speech was nearly inaudible, and no more was said  until the afternoon.    It was Dr. Wilkinson's wish that the Sabbath should be passed as  blamelessly as he had the power of ordering it in his household; but  to make it a day of reverence and delight among so large a number of  boys, with different dispositions and habits of life, was an arduous  task. Mr. James Wilkinson was with the boys the whole afternoon, as  well as his father, to whose utmost endeavors he joined his own, that  the day might not be wholly unprofitable. In spite, however, of all  diligence, it could not fail of often being grossly misspent with many  of the pupils; for it is not possible for human power effectually to  influence the heart, and, until that is done, any thing else can be but  an outward form.    This afternoon the boys were scattered over the large playground. In  one corner was the doctor, with twenty or thirty boys around him, and  in other directions, the different ushers hearing Catechisms and other  lessons. Some of the parties were very dull, for no effort was made by  the instructor to impart a real delight in the Word of God to his pupils;  and religion was made merely a matter of question and answer, to remain  engraved in such heartless form on the repugnant mind of the learner.  And, alas! how can it be otherwise, where the teacher himself does not  know that religion is a real and happy thing, and not to be learned as  we teach our boys the outlines of heathen mythology?    Sitting on the ground, lolling against one of the benches under a  tree, sat Hastings Meredith and Reginald and Louis Mortimer; and one  or two more were standing or sitting near; all of whom had just finished  answering all the questions in the Church Catechism to Mr. Danby, and  had said a Psalm.    Louis was sitting on the bench, looking flushed, thinking of holidays,  and, of course, of home,--home Sabbaths, those brightest days of home  life,--when Trevannion came up with his usual air of cool, easy  confidence. Trevannion was the most gentlemanly young man in the  school; he never was in a hurry; was particularly alive to any  thing \"vulgar,\" or \"snobbish,\" and would have thought it especially  unbecoming in him to exhibit the smallest degree of annoyance at any  untoward event. It took a good deal to put him out of countenance, and  he esteemed it rather plebeian to go his own errands, or, indeed, to  take any unnecessary trouble.    \"Were you in Bristol this morning, Meredith?\" he said.    \"Yes, sure, your highness,\" replied Meredith, yawning.    \"Tired apparently,\" said Trevannion ironically, glancing at the  recumbent attitude of the speaker.    \"Worried to death with that old bore Danby, who's been going backwards  and forwards for the last hour, with 'What is your name?' and 'My good  child,' &c. I'm as tired as--as--oh help me for a simile! as a pair of  worn-out shoes.\"    \"A poetical simile at last,\" remarked Reginald, laughing.    \"You would have a nice walk,\" said Trevannion.    \"Very! and a sermon gratis to boot,\" replied Meredith. \"It would  have done you good, Trevannion, to have heard what shocking things  you have done in being so _very genteel_.\"    \"What do you mean?\" said Trevannion, coolly.    \"Louis Mortimer was giving me a taste of his Methodistical mind on the  duties of clergymen generally, and your humble servant especially.\"    \"I presume you do not include yourself in the fraternity yet?\"  said Trevannion.    \"Not exactly; but having informed him of my prospects, the good child  began to upbraid me with my hypocrisy, and, bless you, such a thundering  sermon,--positively quite eloquent.\"    \"Perhaps I may be allowed to profit by the second part of it,\" said  Trevannion, turning to Louis; \"will you be kind enough to edify me?\"    Louis did not reply, and Trevannion's lips curled slightly as he  remarked, \"There is an old proverb about those who live in glass  houses--'Physician, cure thyself.'\"    Poor Louis turned away, and Meredith, stretching himself and yawning  terrifically, continued, \"You must know, Trevannion, that it is very  wicked to be any thing but a Methodist, very wicked for a clergyman  to be genteel, or to wish to make himself comfortable.\"    \"Hastings, I did not say so,\" said Louis, turning his head.    \"And so,\" continued Meredith, without noticing Louis, \"if we dare  to follow up our own or our fathers' wishes, we must listen to  Louis Mortimer, and he will tell us what to do.\"    \"Much obliged to him, I am sure,\" said Trevannion.    \"Yes, so am I,\" rejoined Meredith, \"though I forgot to tender my  thanks before; and hereby give notice, that when I am in orders,  I will not hunt more than convenient, nor play cards on Good Friday,  nor go to dancing parties on Saturday evening.\"    \"Pshaw, Meredith,\" said Trevannion: \"it is very unbecoming to talk  in this manner of so sacred a profession. A hunting and card-playing  clergyman ought to be stripped of his gown without hesitation. Any  right-minded person would recoil with horror at such a character. It  is a great disgrace to the profession; no clergyman ought to enter  into any kind of improper dissipation. Your ideas are very light  and indelicate.\"    \"Will you be kind enough to define that term, _improper dissipation_,\"  said Meredith, carelessly. \"I presume you have no objection to a quiet  dance now and then, only they must not call it a ball.\"    \"A clergyman ought not to dance,\" replied Trevannion, in precisely the  same cool, dictatorial manner.    \"He may look on them, may he not?\" said Meredith.    \"A clergyman has many serious duties to perform, and he should be  very careful that he does not degrade his office,\" replied Trevannion.  \"He has to uphold the dignity of the church, and should take care that  his conduct is such that no reproach can fall on that church from his  inconsistency.\"    \"Well, for my part,\" said Meredith, lightly, \"I think the church  too important to miss the weight of my example. I mean to have a  most exemplary curate.\"    Near these speakers sat Mr. James Wilkinson, with a few little boys,  whom at this moment he hastily dismissed, for the sound of the light  conversation reached him, and he arose quickly and introduced himself  to the little coterie just as Reginald exclaimed, \"For shame, Meredith!\"    \"Ay, for shame,\" said Mr. James: \"I have heard a little of what has been  going on among you, and am really very sorry to hear such expressions on  a subject so solemn and important. Meredith, you cannot be aware of what  you are saying. I should like to have a little talk about this matter;  and, Mr. Trevannion, if you will give me your attention for a few  minutes, I shall be obliged to you.\"    Trevannion seated himself on the bench, and folding his arms,  remained in an attitude of passive attention.    \"Lend me your prayer-book, Mortimer,\" said Mr. James, and he quickly  turned to the service for the ordering of deacons. \"The first question  here put to the candidate for holy orders is, 'Do you trust that you  are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost, to take upon you this office  and ministration, to serve God for the promoting of His glory and the  edifying of His people?' Now, Meredith, I ask you to think, whether,  with such sentiments as you have just expressed, you can dare to answer,  '_I trust so?_'\"    \"I never thought very seriously about it,\" said Meredith,  rather abruptly.    \"But you know these things must be thought of seriously and prayerfully.  It is required of a man in every station of life, that he be faithful  and diligent, serving the Lord, and whoever does not remember this,  must answer for his neglect of such duty to his Maker. It will not do  to say that our individual example can be of no importance; the command,  'Occupy till I come,' is laid upon each one of us; but what must be said  of him who, in a careless, light frame of mind, takes these holy vows  upon him, knowing in his own mind that he intends to break them; that  his sole desire to be put into the priest's office is to eat a morsel  of bread? What shall be said of him who goes into the house of God, and  in the presence of His people declares that it is his intention, 'to  search gladly and willingly for the sick and poor of his parish,  to relieve their necessities; to frame his own life and the lives  of his family according to the doctrine of Christ; to be diligent in  prayers and in reading of the Holy Scriptures, laying aside the study  of the world and the flesh,' and yet knows that he intends to enjoy  himself in the things of this world--a very hireling who forgets that  his master's eye is upon him. It is a fearful thing. It is coming before  the Almighty with a lie. Nay, hear me a little longer. The clergyman's  is a glorious and exalted path, the happiest I know of on earth. It is  his especially to bear the message of salvation from a tender Saviour.

An interesting ruin which occurs on a mesa point a short distance north  of Mashongnavi is known to the Tusayan under the name of Payupki. There  are traditions and legends concerning it among the Tusayan, but the only  version that could be obtained is not regarded by the writer as being up  to the standard of those incorporated in the \"Summary\" and it is  therefore given separately, as it has some suggestive value. It was  obtained through Dr. Jeremiah Sullivan, then resident in Tusayan.    The people of Payupki spoke the same language as those on the first mesa  (Walpi). Long ago they lived in the north, on the San Juan, but they  were compelled to abandon that region and came to a place about 20 miles  northwest from Oraibi. Being compelled to leave there, they went to  Canyon de Chelly, where a band of Indians from the southeast joined  them, with whom they formed an alliance. Together the two tribes moved  eastward toward the Jemez Mountains, whence they drifted into the valley  of the Rio Grande. There they became converts to the fire-worship then  prevailing, but retained their old customs and language. At the time of  the great insurrection (of 1680) they sheltered the native priests that  were driven from some of the Rio Grande villages, and this action  created such distrust and hatred among the people that the Payupki were  forced to leave their settlement. Their first stop was at Old Laguna (12  miles east of the modern village) and they had with them then some 35 or  40 of the priests. After leaving Laguna they came to Bear Spring (Fort  Wingate) and had a fight there with the Apache, whom they defeated. They  remained at Bear Spring for several years, until the Zuñi compelled them  to move. They then attempted to reach the San Juan, but were deceived in  the trail, turned to the west and came to where Pueblo Colorado is now  (the present post-office of Ganado, between Fort Defiance and Keam's  Canyon). They remained there a long time, and through their success in  farming became so favorably known that they were urged to come farther  west. They refused, in consequence of which some Tusayan attacked them.  They were captured and brought to Walpi (then on the point) and  afterwards they were distributed among the villages. Previous to this  capture the priests had been guiding them by feathers, smoke, and signs  seen in the fire. When the priest's omens and oracles had proved false  the people were disposed to kill them, but the priests persuaded them to  let it depend on a test case--offering to kill themselves in the event  of failure. So they had a great feast at Awatubi. The priests had long,  hollow reeds inclosing various substances--feathers, flour, corn-pollen,  sacred water, native tobacco (piba), corn, beans, melon seeds, etc., and  they formed in a circle at sunrise on the plaza and had their  incantations and prayers. As the sun rose a priest stepped forth before  the people and blew through his reed, desirous of blowing that which was  therein away from him, to scatter it abroad. But the wind would not  blow and the contents of the reed fell to the ground. The priests were  divided into groups, according to what they carried. In the evening all  but two groups had blown. Then the elder of the twain turned his back  eastward, and the reed toward the setting sun, and he blew, and the wind  caught the feather and carried it to the west. This was accepted as a  sign and the next day the Tusayan freed the slaves, giving each a  blanket with corn in it. They went to the mesa where the ruin now stands  and built the houses there. They asked for planting grounds, and fields  were given them; but their crops did not thrive, and they stole corn  from the Mashongnavi. Then, fearful lest they should be surprised at  night, they built a wall as high as a man's head about the top of their  mesa, and they had big doorways, which they closed and fastened at  night. When they were compelled to plant corn for themselves they  planted it on the ledges of the mesa, but it grew only as high as a  man's knees; the leaves were very small and the grains grew only on one  side of it. After a time they became friendly with the Mashongnavi  again, and a boy from that village conceived a passion for a Payupki  girl. The latter tribe objected to a marriage but the Mashongnavi were  very desirous for it and some warriors of that village proposed if the  boy could persuade the girl to fly with him, to aid and protect him. On  an appointed day, about sundown, the girl came down from the mesa into  the valley, but she was discovered by some old women who were baking  pottery, who gave the alarm. Hearing the noise a party of the  Mashongnavi, who were lying in wait, came up, but they encountered a  party of the Payupki who had come out and a fight ensued. During the  fight the young man was killed; and this caused so much bitterness of  feeling that the Payupki were frightened, and remained quietly in their  pueblo for several days. One morning, however, an old woman came over to  Mashongnavi to borrow some tobacco, saying that they were going to have  a dance in her village in five days. The next day the Payupki quietly  departed. Seeing no smoke from the village the Mashongnavi at first  thought that the Payupki were preparing for their dance, but on the  third day a band of warriors was sent over to inquire and they found the  village abandoned. The estufas and the houses of the priests were pulled  down.    The narrator adds that the Payupki returned to San Felipe whence they  came.      [Illustration: Plate XV. Standing walls of Payupki.]          CHAPTER II.    RUINS AND INHABITED VILLAGES OF TUSAYAN.      PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE PROVINCE.    That portion of the southwestern plateau country comprised in the  Province of Tusayan has usually been approached from the east, so that  the easternmost of the series of mesas upon which the villages are  situated is called the \"First Mesa.\" The road for 30 or 40 miles before  reaching this point traverses the eastern portion of the great plateau  whose broken margin, farther west, furnishes the abrupt mesa-tongues  upon which the villages are built. The sandstone measures of this  plateau are distinguished from many others of the southwest by their  neutral colors. The vegetation consisting of a scattered growth of  stunted piñon and cedar, interspersed with occasional stretches of  dull-gray sage, imparts an effect of extreme monotony to the landscape.  The effect is in marked contrast to the warmth and play of color  frequently seen elsewhere in the plateau country.    The plateaus of Tusayan are generally diversified by canyons and buttes,  whose precipitous sides break down into long ranges of rocky talus and  sandy foothills. The arid character of this district is especially  pronounced about the margin of the plateau. In the immediate vicinity of  the villages there are large areas that do not support a blade of grass,  where barren rocks outcrop through drifts of sand or lie piled in  confusion at the bases of the cliffs. The canyons that break through the  margins of these mesas often have a remarkable similarity of appearance,  and the consequent monotony is extremely embarrassing to the traveler,  the absence of running water and clearly defined drainage confusing his  sense of direction.    The occasional springs which furnish scanty water supply to the  inhabitants of this region are found generally at great distances apart,  and there are usually but few natural indications of their location.  They often occur in obscure nooks in the canyons, reached by tortuous  trails winding through the talus and foothills, or as small seeps at the  foot of some mesa. The convergence of numerous Navajo trails, however,  furnishes some guide to these rare water sources.      [Illustration: Plate XVI. Plan of Hano.]    The series of promontories upon which the Tusayan villages are built are  exceptionally rich in these seeps and springs. About the base of the  \"First Mesa\" (Fig. 1), within a distance of 4 or 5 miles from the  villages located upon it, there are at least five places where water can  be obtained. One of these is a mere surface reservoir, but the others  appear to be permanent springs. The quantity of water, however, is so  small that it produces no impression on the arid and sterile effect of  the surroundings, except in its immediate vicinity. Here small patches  of green, standing out in strong relief against their sandy  back-grounds, mark the position of clusters of low, stunted peach trees  that have obtained a foothold on the steep sand dunes.      [Illustration: Fig. 1. View of the First Mesa.]    In the open plains surrounding the mesa rim (6,000 feet above the sea),  are seen broad stretches of dusty sage brush and prickly greasewood.  Where the plain rises toward the base of the mesa a scattered growth of  scrub cedar and piñon begins to appear. But little of this latter growth  is seen in the immediate vicinity of the villages; it is, however, the  characteristic vegetation of the mesas, while, in still higher  altitudes, toward the San Juan, open forests of timber are met with.  This latter country seems scarcely to have come within the ancient  builder's province; possibly on account of its coldness in winter and  for the reason that it is open to the incursions of warlike hunting  tribes. Sage brush and greasewood grow abundantly near the villages, and  these curious gnarled and twisted shrubs furnish the principal fuel of  the Tusayan.    Occasionally grassy levels are seen that for a few weeks in early summer  are richly carpeted with multitudes"]]]
