Fortunately the slope grew  less steep, and Slone could see below where it reached out to  comparatively level ground. Still, a mishap might yet occur. Slone kept  as close to Nagger as possible, helping him whenever he could do it.  The mustang slipped, rolled over, and then slipped past Slone, went  down the slope to bring up in a cedar. Slone worked down to him and  extricated him. Then the huge Nagger began to slide. Snow and loose  rock slid with him, and so did Slone. The little avalanche stopped of  its own accord, and then Slone dragged Nagger on down and down,  presently to come to the end of the steep descent. Slone looked up to  see that he had made short work of a thousand-foot slope. Here cedars  and pinyons grew thickly enough to make a forest. The snow thinned out  to patches, and then failed. But the going remained bad for a while as  the horses sank deep in a soft red earth. This eventually grew more  solid and finally dry. Slone worked out of the cedars to what appeared  a grassy plateau inclosed by the great green-and-white slope with its  yellow wall over hanging, and distant mesas and cliffs. Here his view  was restricted. He was down on the first bench of the great canyon. And  there was the deer trail, a well-worn path keeping to the edge of the  slope. Slone came to a deep cut in the earth, and the trail headed it,  where it began at the last descent of the slope. It was the source of a  canyon. He could look down to see the bare, worn rock, and a hundred  yards from where he stood the earth was washed from its rims and it  began to show depth and something of that ragged outline which told of  violence of flood. The trail headed many canyons like this, all running  down across this bench, disappearing, dropping invisibly. The trail  swung to the left under the great slope, and then presently it climbed  to a higher bench. Here were brush and grass and huge patches of sage,  so pungent that it stung Slone's nostrils. Then he went down again,  this time to come to a clear brook lined by willows. Here the horses  drank long and Slone refreshed himself. The sun had grown hot. There  was fragrance of flowers he could not see and a low murmur of a  waterfall that was likewise invisible. For most of the time his view  was shut off, but occasionally he reached a point where through some  break he saw towers gleaming red in the sun. A strange place, a place  of silence, and smoky veils in the distance. Time passed swiftly.  Toward the waning of the afternoon he began to climb to what appeared  to be a saddle of land, connecting the canyon wall on the left with a  great plateau, gold-rimmed and pine-fringed, rising more and more in  his way as he advanced. At sunset Slone was more shut in than for  several hours. He could tell the time was sunset by the golden light on  the cliff wall again overhanging him. The slope was gradual up to this  pass to the saddle, and upon coming to a spring, and the first  pine-trees, he decided to halt for a camp. The mustang was almost  exhausted.    Thereupon he hobbled the horses in the luxuriant grass round the  spring, and then unrolled his pack. Once as dusk came stealing down,  while he was eating his meal, Nagger whistled in fright. Slone saw a  gray, pantherish form gliding away into the shadows. He took a quick  shot at it, but missed.    \"It's a lion country, all right,\" he said. And then he set about  building a big fire on the other side of the grassy plot, so to have  the horses between fires. He cut all the venison into thin strips, and  spent an hour roasting them. Then he lay down to rest, and he said:  \"Wonder where Wildfire is to-night? Am I closer to him? Where's he  headin' for?\"    The night was warm and still. It was black near the huge cliff, and  overhead velvety blue, with stars of white fire. It seemed to him that  he had become more thoughtful and observing of the aspects of his wild  environment, and he felt a welcome consciousness of loneliness. Then  sleep came to him and the night seemed short. In the gray dawn he arose  refreshed.    The horses were restive. Nagger snorted a welcome. Evidently they had  passed an uneasy night. Slone found lion tracks at the spring and in  sandy places. Presently he was on his way up to the notch between the  great wall and the plateau. A growth of thick scrub-oak made travel  difficult. It had not appeared far up to that saddle, but it was far.  There were straggling pine-trees and huge rocks that obstructed his  gaze. But once up he saw that the saddle was only a narrow ridge,  curved to slope up on both sides.    Straight before Slone and under him opened the canyon, blazing and  glorious along the peaks and ramparts, where the rising sun struck,  misty and smoky and shadowy down in those mysterious depths.    It took an effort not to keep on gazing. But Slone turned to the grim  business of his pursuit. The trail he saw leading down had been made by  Indians. It was used probably once a year by them; and also by wild  animals, and it was exceedingly steep and rough. Wildfire had paced to  and fro along the narrow ridge of that saddle, making many tracks,  before he had headed down again. Slone imagined that the great stallion  had been daunted by the tremendous chasm, but had finally faced it,  meaning to put this obstacle between him and his pursuers. It never  occurred to Slone to attribute less intelligence to Wildfire than that.  So, dismounting, Slone took Nagger's bridle and started down. The  mustang with the pack was reluctant. He snorted and whistled and pawed  the earth. But he would not be left alone, so he followed.    The trail led down under cedars that fringed a precipice. Slone was  aware of this without looking. He attended only to the trail and to his  horse. Only an Indian could have picked out that course, and it was  cruel to put a horse to it. But Nagger was powerful, sure-footed, and  he would go anywhere that Slone led him. Gradually Slone worked down  and away from the bulging rim-wall. It was hard, rough work, and risky  because it could not be accomplished slowly. Brush and rocks, loose  shale and weathered slope, long, dusty inclines of yellow earth, and  jumbles of stone--these made bad going for miles of slow, zigzag trail  down out of the cedars. Then the trail entered what appeared to be a  ravine.    That ravine became a canyon. At its head it was a dry wash, full of  gravel and rocks. It began to cut deep into the bowels of the earth. It  shut out sight of the surrounding walls and peaks. Water appeared from  under a cliff and, augmented by other springs, became a brook. Hot,  dry, and barren at its beginning, this cleft became cool and shady and  luxuriant with grass and flowers and amber moss with silver blossoms.  The rocks had changed color from yellow to deep red. Four hours of  turning and twisting, endlessly down and down, over boulders and banks  and every conceivable roughness of earth and rock, finished the  pack-mustang; and Slone mercifully left him in a long reach of canyon  where grass and water never failed. In this place Slone halted for the  noon hour, letting Nagger have his fill of the rich grazing. Nagger's  three days in grassy upland, despite the continuous travel by day, had  improved him. He looked fat, and Slone had not yet caught the horse  resting. Nagger was iron to endure. Here Slone left all the outfit  except what was on his saddle, and the sack containing the few pounds  of meat and supplies, and the two utensils. This sack he tied on the  back of his saddle, and resumed his journey.    Presently he came to a place where Wildfire had doubled on his trail  and had turned up a side canyon. The climb out was hard on Slone, if  not on Nagger. Once up, Slone found himself upon a wide, barren plateau  of glaring red rock and clumps of greasewood and cactus. The plateau  was miles wide, shut in by great walls and mesas of colored rock. The  afternoon sun beat down fiercely. A blast of wind, as if from a  furnace, swept across the plateau, and it was laden with red dust.  Slone walked here, where he could have ridden. And he made several  miles of up-and-down progress over this rough plateau. The great walls  of the opposite side of the canyon loomed appreciably closer. What,  Slone wondered, was at the bottom of this rent in the earth? The great  desert river was down there, of course, but he knew nothing of it.  Would that turn back Wildfire? Slone thought grimly how he had always  claimed Nagger to be part fish and part bird. Wildfire was not going to  escape.    By and by only isolated mescal plants with long, yellow-plumed spears  broke the bare monotony of the plateau. And Slone passed from red sand  and gravel to a red, soft shale, and from that to hard, red rock. Here  Wildfire's tracks were lost, the first time in seven weeks. But Slone  had his direction down that plateau with the cleavage lines of canyons  to right and left. At times Slone found a vestige of the old Indian  trail, and this made him doubly sure of being right. He did not need to  have Wildfire's tracks. He let Nagger pick the way, and the horse made  no mistake in finding the line of least resistance. But that grew  harder and harder. This bare rock, like a file, would soon wear  Wildfire's hoofs thin. And Slone rejoiced. Perhaps somewhere down in  this awful chasm he and Nagger would have it out with the stallion.  Slone began to look far ahead, beginning to believe that he might see  Wildfire. Twice he had seen Wildfire, but only at a distance. Then he  had resembled a running streak of fire, whence his name, which Slone  had given him.    This bare region of rock began to be cut up into gullies. It was  necessary to head them or to climb in and out. Miles of travel really  meant little progress straight ahead. But Slone kept on. He was hot and  Nagger was hot, and that made hard work easier. Sometimes on the wind  came a low "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],[0,"The Faith of Islam (#12)"],[1,".  Penal laws may be based on a deduction of this kind.    (2.) _Isharat_, that is, a sign or hint which may be given from the order  in which the words are placed.    (3.) _Dalalat_, or the argument which may be deduced from the use of some  special word in the verse, as: \"say not to your parents, \"Fie\" (Arabic  \"uff\") (Sura xvii. 23). From the use of the word \"uff,\" it is argued that  children may not beat or abuse their parents. Penal laws may be based on  \"dalalat,\" thus: \"Their aim will be to abet disorder on the earth; but God  loveth not the abettors of disorder.\" (Sura v. 69.) The word translated  \"aim\" is in Arabic literally yasa'una, \"they run.\" From this the argument  is deduced that as highwaymen wander about, they are included amongst those  whom \"God loveth not,\" and that, therefore, the severest punishment may be  given to {54} them, for any deduction that comes under the head of  \"dalalat\" is a sufficient basis for the formation of the severest penal  laws.    (4.) _Iqtiza._ This is a deduction which demands certain conditions:  \"whosoever killeth a believer by mischance, shall be bound to free a  believer from slavery.\" (Sura iv. 94). As a man has no authority to free  his neighbour's slave, the condition here required, though not expressed,  is that the slave should be his own property.    The Quran is divided into:--    (1). _Harf_ (plural _Huruf_), letters. The numbers given by different  authorities vary. In one standard book it is said that there are 338,606  letters.    (2). _Kalima_ (plural _Kalimat_), words, stated by some to amount to  79,087; by others to 77,934.    (3). _Ayat_ (plural _Ayat_), verses. Ayat really means a sign, and was the  name given by Muhammad to short sections or verses of the Quran. The end of  a verse is determined by the position of a small circle (.). The early  Quran Readers did not agree as to the position of these circles, and so  five different ways of arranging them have arisen. This accounts for a  variation in the number of verses in various editions. The varieties are:--    (1). _Kufa_ verses. The Readers in the city of Kufa say that they followed  the custom of 'Ali. Their way of reckoning is generally adopted in India.  They reckon 6,239 verses.    (2). _Basra_ verses. The Readers of Basra follow 'Asim bin Hajjaj, a  Companion. They reckon 6,204.    (3). _Shami_ verses. The Readers in Syria (Sham) followed Abd-ullah bin  'Umr, a Companion. They reckon 6,225 verses.    (4). _Mecca_ verses. According to this arrangement there are 6,219 verses.    (5). _Madina_ verses. This way of reading contains 6,211 verses.    {55}    In each of the above varieties the verse \"Bismillah\" (in the name of God)  is not reckoned. It occurs 113 times in the Quran.    This diversity of punctuation does not generally affect the meaning of any  important passage. The third verse of the third Sura is an important  exception. The position of the circle (.), the symbol denoting a full stop,  in that verse is of the highest importance in connection with the rise of  scholasticism ('Ilm-i-kalam) in Islam.    Most of the cases, however, are like the following:--    In Sura xxvii. an account is given of the Queen of Sheba's receiving a  letter from King Solomon. Addressing her nobles she said: \"Verily, Kings,  when they enter a city (by force) waste the same, and abase the most  powerful of the inhabitants hereof: and so will (these) do (with us).\" Many  Readers put the full stop after the word \"hereof,\" and say that God is the  speaker of the words \"and so will they do.\"    (4). _Sura_, or chapter. The word Sura means a row or series, such as a  line of bricks arranged in a wall, but it is now exclusively used for  chapters in the Quran. These are one hundred and fourteen in number. The  Suras are not numbered in the original Arabic, but each one has some  approximate name, (as Baqr--the cow, Nisa--women, &c.,) generally taken  from some expression which occurs in it. They are not arranged in  chronological order, but according to their length. As a general rule, the  shorter Suras which contain the theology of Islam, belong to the Meccan  period of the Prophet's career,[54] and the longer ones relating chiefly to  social duties and relationships, to the organisation of Islam as a civil  polity, to the time when he was consolidating his power at Madina. The best  way, therefore, to {56} read the Quran, is to begin at the end. The attempt  to arrange the Suras in due order, is a very difficult one, and, after all,  can only be approximately correct.[55] Carlyle referring to the confused  mass of \"endless iterations, long windedness, entanglement, most crude,  incondite\" says: \"nothing but a sense of duty could carry any European  through the Quran.\" When re-arranged the book becomes more intelligible.  The chief tests for such re-arrangement are the style and the matter. There  is a very distinct difference in both of these respects between the earlier  and later Suras. The references to historical events sometimes give a clue.  Individual Suras are often very composite in their character, but, such as  they are, they have been from the beginning. The recension made by Zeid, in  the reign of the Khalif Osman, has been handed down unaltered in its form.  The only variations (qira'at) now to be found in the text have been already  noticed. They in no way affect the arrangements of the Suras.    5. _Sipara_ a thirtieth portion. This is a Persian word derived from _si_,  thirty, and _para_, a portion. The Arabs call each of these divisions a  _Juz_. Owing to this division, a pious man can recite the whole Quran in a  month, taking one Sipara each day. Musalmans never quote the Quran as we do  by Sura and Ayat, but by the Sipara and Ruku', a term I now proceed to  explain.    6. _Ruku'_ (plural _Rukuat_). This word literally means a prostration made  by a worshipper in the act of saying the prayers. The collection of verses  recited from the Quran, ascriptions of praise offered to God, and various  ritual acts connected with these, constitute one act of worship called a  \"rak'at.\" After reciting some verses in this form of prayer, the worshipper  makes a _Ruku'_, or prostration, the {57} portion then recited takes the  name of _Ruku'_. Tradition states that the Khalif Osman, when reciting the  Quran during the month of Ramazan, used to make twenty rak'ats each  evening. In each rak'at he introduced different verses of the Quran,  beginning with the first chapter and going steadily on. In this way he  recited about two hundred verses each evening; that is, about ten verses in  each rak'at. Since then, it has been the custom to recite the Quran in this  way in Ramazan, and also to quote it by the ruku', _e.g._, \"such a passage  is in such a Sipara and in such a ruku'.\"    The following account of a rak'at will make the matter plain. When the  Faithful are assembled in the mosque, the Imam, or leader, being in front  facing the Qibla, the service commences thus:--Each worshipper stands and  says the Niyyat (literally \"intention\"), a form of words declaring his  intention to say his prayers. He then says: \"God is great.\" After this,  looking downwards, he says: \"Holiness to Thee, O God! and praise be to  Thee, Great is Thy name, Great is Thy greatness, there is no deity but  Thee.\" Then follows: \"I seek from God refuge from cursed Satan.\" Then the  Tasmiyah is repeated: \"In the name of God, the Compassionate and Merciful.\"  Then follows the Fatiha, that is, the short chapter at the commencement of  the Quran. After this has been recited, the Imam proceeds, on the first  night of the month Ramazan, with the first verse of the second chapter.[56]  After saying a few verses, he makes a ruku'; that is, he bends his head and  body down, and places his hands on his knees. In this position he says:  \"God is great.\" Then he repeats three times the words: \"I extol the  holiness of my Lord, the Great.\" He then stands up and says: \"God hears him  who praises Him.\" To this the people respond: \"O Lord, thou art praised.\"  Again, falling on his knees, the worshipper says: \"God is great.\" Then he  puts first his nose, and then his forehead on the {58} ground and says  three times: \"I extol the holiness of my Lord, the Most High.\" Then sitting  on his heels, he says: \"God is great;\" and again repeats as before: \"I  extol, etc.\" He then rises and says: \"God is great.\" This is one rak'at. On  each night in the month of Ramazan this is gone through twenty times, the  only variation being that after the Fatiha and before the first  prostration, fresh verses of the Quran are introduced. The whole is, of  course, done in Arabic, in whatever country the worshippers may be. The  name of the prostration (ruku') has been transferred to the portion of the  Quran recited just before it is made. There are altogether 557 Rukuat.    (7). The other divisions are not important. They are, a _Sumn_, _Ruba'_,  _Nisf_, _Suls_, that is one-eighth, one-fourth, one-half, one-third of a  Sipara respectively.    In reciting the Quran the worshipper must be careful to say the \"Takbir,\"  _i.e._ \"God is great,\" after the several appointed places. Such a place is  after the recital of the 93rd Sura. The custom arose in this way. The  hypocrites came to the Prophet and asked him to relate the story of the  \"Seven Sleepers.\" He said: \"I will tell you to-morrow;\" but he forgot to  add the words \"if God will.\" By way of warning, God allowed no inspiration  to descend upon him for some days. Then the hypocrites began to laugh and  say: \"God has left him.\" As it was not God's purpose to put his messenger  to ridicule, the Sura entitled \"The brightness\" (xciii) was immediately  brought by the ever-ready Gabriel. It begins: \"By the brightness of the  morning, and by the night when it groweth dark, _thy Lord hath not forsaken  thee_, neither doth He hate thee.\" In remembrance of this signal  interposition of Providence on his behalf, the"]]]
