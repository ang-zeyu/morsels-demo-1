But this advantage disappears when  compared with the hindrance caused by this very circumstance in the  raising of the individual idea to a general idea, for the fact that the  latter is designated by the image, or the elements of the image in which  the former consists, is no small obstacle to it in attaining complete  generality. The same bond that unites the concept with the conceiver  binds it likewise to one of the individual ideas conceived--e. g., when,  by pointing to his own flesh, his own skin, he designates the concept  flesh, skin (in general also the flesh or the skin of animals); whereas,  by means of the word, which the child who has all his senses is obliged  to learn, a constraint is indeed exercised as something foreign, but a  constraint that simply enforces upon his idea the claim of generality.    \"One example more. The deaf-mute designates the concept, or general  idea, 'red' by lightly touching his lips. With this sign he indicates  the red of the sky, of paintings, of dress-stuffs, of flowers, etc.  Thus, in however manifold connection with other concepts his concept  'red' may be repeated, it is to him as a concept always _one_ and the  same only. It is _common_ to _all_ the connections in which it  repeatedly occurs.\"    But before the thinking deaf-mute arrived at the concept \"red,\" he  formed for himself the ideas \"lip, dress, sky, flower,\" etc.    For a knowledge of intellectual development in the child possessed of  all the senses, and of the great extent to which he is independent of  verbal language in the formation of concepts, it is indispensable to  make a collection of such concepts as uneducated deaf-mutes not  acquainted either with the finger-alphabet or with articulation express  by means of their own gestures in a manner intelligible to others. Their  language, however, comprises \"not only the various expressive changes of  countenance (play of feature), but also the varied movements of the  hands (gesticulations), the positions, attitudes, bearing, and movements  of the other parts of the entire body, through which the deaf-mute  naturally, i. e., _untouched by educational influences_, expresses his  ideas and conceptions.\" But I refrain from making such a catalogue here,  as we are concerned with the fact that _many concepts are, without any  learning of words whatever, plainly expressed and logically combined  with one another_, and their correctness is proved by the conduct of any  and every untaught child born deaf. Besides, such a catalogue, in order  to possess the psychogenetic value desired by me, needs a critical  examination extremely difficult to carry through as to whether the  \"educational influences\" supposed to be excluded are actually wholly  excluded in all cases as they really are in some cases, e. g., in regard  to food.       Degerando (1827) has enumerated a long list of concepts, which     deaf-mutes before they are instructed represent by pantomimic     gesture. Many of these forms of expression in French deaf-mutes are     identical with those of German. It is most earnestly to be wished     that this international language of feature and gesture used by     children entirely uninstructed, born deaf, may be made accessible to     psycho-physiological and linguistic study by means of pictorial     representations--photographic best of all. This should be founded on     the experiences of German, French, English, Russian, Italian, and     other teachers of deaf-mutes.    For there is hardly a better proof that thinking is not dependent on the  language of words than the conduct of deaf-mutes, who express, indeed,  many more concepts of unlike content in the same manner than any verbal  language does--just as children with all their senses do before they  possess a satisfactory stock of words--but who, by gesticulation and  pantomime before receiving any instruction, demonstrate that concepts  are formed without words.    With reference to the manner in which uneducated deaf-mutes speak, the  following examples are characteristic performances in gesture-language:    One deaf-mute asks another, \"Stay, go you?\" (look of inquiry). Answer:  \"Go, I\" (i. e., \"Do you stay or go?\" \"I go\"). \"Hunter hare shoots.\"    \"Arm, man, be strong,\" means, \"The man's arm is strong.\"    \"N., spectacles, see,\" means, \"N. sees with the spectacles.\"    \"Run I finished, go to sleep,\" means, \"When I had finished running, I  went to sleep.\" \"Money, you?\" means, \"Have you money?\"    One of the most interesting sights I know of, in a psychological and  physiological point of view, is a conversation in gesture and pantomime  between two or three children born totally deaf, who do not know that  they are observed. I am indebted to Director Oehlwein, of Weimar, for  the opportunity of such observations, as also for the above questions  and answers. Especially those children (of about seven years) not yet  instructed in articulation employ an astonishing number of looks and  gestures, following one upon another with great rapidity, in order to  effect an understanding with one another. They understand one another  very easily, but, because their gestures, and particularly their  excessively subtilized play of feature, do not appear in ordinary life,  these children are just as hard to understand for the uninitiated as are  men who speak a wholly foreign language without any gestures. Even the  eye of the deaf-mute has a different expression from that of the person  who talks. The look seems more \"interested,\" and manifestly far fewer  unnecessary movements of the eyes and contractions of the facial muscles  are made by the deaf-mute than by the child of the same age who has his  hearing.    Further, deaf-mutes, even those of small ability, imitate all sorts of  movements that are plainly visible much better, in general, than do  persons with all their senses. I made, in presence of the children,  several not very easy crossings of the fingers, put my hands in  different positions, and the like--movements that they could not ever  have seen--and I was surprised that some of the children at once made  them deftly, whereas ordinary children, first consider a long time, and  then imitate clumsily. It is doubtless this exaltation of the imitative  functions in deaf-mute children which makes it appear as if they  themselves invented their gestures (see above, p. 23). Certainly they do  not get their first signs through \"any one's suggestion,\" they form them  for themselves, but, so far as I see, only through imitation and the  hereditary expressive movements. The signs are in great part themselves  unabridged imitations. The agreement, or \"convention,\" which many  teachers of deaf-mutes assume, and which would introduce an entirely  causeless, not to say mysterious, principle, consists in this, that all  deaf-mutes in the beginning imitate the same thing in the same way.  Thus, through this perfectly natural accord of all, it comes to pass  that they understand one another. When they have gained ideas, then they  combine the separate signs in manifold ways, as one who speaks combines  words, in order to express new ideas; they become thereby more and more  difficult to be understood, and often are only with difficulty  understood even among themselves; and they are able only in very limited  degree to form concepts of a higher order. \"Nothing, being dead,  space\"--these are concepts of a very high order for them.    For this reason it is easy to comprehend that a deaf-mute child,  although he has learned but few words through instruction in  articulation, weaves these continually into his pantomimic  conversation in place of his former elaborate gestures. I observed  that individual children, born totally deaf, preferred, even in  conversation with one another, and when ignorant of the fact that I  was observing them, the articulate words just learned, although these  were scarcely intelligible, to their own signs.    Thus mighty is the charm of the spoken word, even when the child does  not himself hear it, but merely feels it with his tongue.    But the schooling the deaf-mute must go through in order to become  acquainted with the sensations of sight, touch, and movement that go  with the sound, is unspeakably toilsome.    W. Gude says in his treatise, remarkable alike for acuteness and  clearness, \"Principles and Outlines of the Exposition of a Scheme of  Instruction for an Institution for Deaf-Mutes\" (\"Grundsaetze und  Grundzuege zur Aufstellung eines Lehrplans fuer eine Taubstummen-Anstalt,\"  1881): \"The utterances of tones and of articulate sounds called forth by  involuntary stimulus during the first years, in deaf-mutes, are such  unimportant motor phenomena that they are not immediately followed by a  motor sensation. But when the deaf-mute child is more awake mentally, he  perceives that his relatives make movements of the mouth in their  intercourse, and repeated attempts of those about him to make themselves  intelligible by pronouncing certain words to him are not entirely  without effect upon the deaf-mute that is intellectually active. When  such deaf-mutes now direct their attention to the matter, they succeed  in regard to only a part of the sounds--those that are conspicuous to  the eye in their utterance--in getting a tolerable imitation. Individual  deaf-mutes go so far, in fact, as to understand various words correctly  without repeating them; others succeed gradually in repeating such words  as 'papa, mamma,' so that one can understand what is meant. Those who  are deaf-mutes from birth do not, however, of themselves, succeed in  imitating accurately other vocal sounds in general.\"    A deaf-mut"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19550"],[0,"Natural History of the Mammalia of India and Ceylon (#12)"],[1," he had opportunities of observing the two animals in  life; he says he had a young specimen of _priamus_, which distinctly  showed the crest, and a young _thersites_ of the same age which showed  no sign of it.    In Emerson Tennent's 'Natural History of Ceylon,' (1861) page 5,  there is a plate of a group in which are included _priamus_ and  _thersites_; in the original they are wrongly numbered--the former  should be 2 and not 3, and the latter 3 and not 2. If these be correct  (and Wolf's name should be a voucher for their being so) there is  a decided difference. There is no crest in the latter, and the white  whiskers terminate abruptly on a level with the eyebrow, and the  superciliary ridge of hair is wanting.      NO. 16. SEMNOPITHECUS _vel_ PRESBYTES ALBINUS (_Kellaart_).  _The White Langur_.    HABITAT.--Ceylon, in the hills beyond Matelle.    DESCRIPTION.--Fur dense, sinuous, nearly of uniform white colour,  with only a slight dash of grey on the head; face and ears black;  palm, soles, fingers and toes flesh-coloured; limbs and body the  shape of _P. ursinus_; long white hairs prolonged over the toes and  claws, giving the appearance of a white spaniel dog to this monkey;  irides brown; whiskers white, full, and pointed laterally.--_Kellaart_.    The above description was taken by Dr. Kellaart from a living  specimen. He considered it to be a distinct species, and not an Albino,  from the black face and ears and brown eyes.    The Kandyans assured him that they were to be seen (rarely however)  in small parties of three and four over the hills beyond Matelle,  but never in company with the dark kind.    Emerson Tennent also mentions one that was brought to him taken  between Ambepasse and Kornegalle, where they were said to be  numerous; except in colour it had all the characteristics of _P.  cephalopterus_. So striking was its whiteness that it might have been  conjectured to be an Albino, but for the circumstance that its eyes  and face were black. An old writer of the seventeenth century, Knox,  says of the monkeys of Ceylon (where he was captive for some time)  that there are some \"milk-white in body and face, but of this sort  there is not such plenty.\"--_Tennent's 'Natural History of Ceylon,'  page 8_.    NOTE.--Since the above was in type I have found in the List of Animals  in the Zoological Society's Gardens, a species entered as  _Semnopithecus leucoprymnus_, the Purple-faced Monkey from  Ceylon--see P.Z.S.      PAPIONINAE.    This sub-family comprises the true baboons of Africa and the  monkey-like baboons of India. They have the stomach simple, and  cheek-pouches are always present. According to Cuvier they possess,  like the last family, a fifth tubercle on their last molars. They  produce early, but are not completely adult for four or five years;  the period of gestation is seven months.    The third sub-family of _Simiadae_ consists of the genera  _Cercopithicus_, _Macacus_, and _Cynocephalus_, as generally  accepted by modern zoologists, but Jerdon seems to have followed  Ogilby in his classification, which merges the long-tailed Macaques  into _Cercopithecus_, and substituting _Papio_ for the others.      _GENUS INUUS_.    Cuvier applies this term to the Magots or rudimentary-tailed  Macaques. The monkeys of this genus are more compactly built than  those of the last. They are also less herbivorous in their diet,  eating frogs, lizards, crabs and insects, as well as vegetables and  fruit. Their callosities and cheek-pouches are large, and they have  a sac which communicates with the larynx under the thyroid cartilage,  which fills with air when they cry out.    Some naturalists of the day, however, place all under the generic  name Macacus.      NO. 17. INUUS _vel_ MACACUS SILENUS.  _The Lion Monkey_ (_Jerdon's No. 6_).    NATIVE NAMES.--_Nil bandar_, Bengali; _Shia bandar_, Hindi; _Nella  manthi_, Malabari.    HABITAT.--The Western Ghats of India from North Lat. 14 degrees to  the extreme south, but most abundant in Cochin and Travancore  (_Jerdon_), also Ceylon (_Cuvier_ and _Horsfield_), though  not confirmed by Emerson Tennent, who states that the _silenus_ is  not found in the island except as introduced by Arab horse-dealers  occasionally, and that it certainly is not indigenous. Blyth was also  assured by Dr. Templeton of Colombo that the only specimens there  were imported.    [Figure: _Macacus silenus_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Black, with a reddish-white hood or beard surrounding  the face and neck; tail with a tuft of whitish hair at the tip; a  little greyish on the chest.    SIZE.--About 24 inches; tail, 10 inches.    There is a plate of this monkey in Carpenter and Westwood's edition  of Cuvier, under the mistaken name of _Wanderoo_.    It is somewhat sulky and savage, and is difficult to get near in a  wild state. Jerdon states that he met with it only in dense  unfrequented forest, and sometimes at a considerable elevation. It  occurs in troops of from twelve to twenty.      NO. 18. INUUS _vel_ MACACUS RHESUS.  _The Bengal Monkey_ (_Jerdon's No. 7_).    NATIVE NAMES.--_Bandar_, Hindi; _Markot_, Bengali; _Suhu_, Lepcha,  _Piyu_, Bhotia.    HABITAT.--India generally from the North to about Lat. 18 degrees  or 19 degrees; but not in the South, where it is replaced by _Macacus  radiatus_.    [Figure: _Macacus rhesus_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Above brownish ochrey or rufous; limbs and beneath  ashy-brown; callosities and adjacent parts red; face of adult males  red.    SIZE.--Twenty-two inches; tail 11 inches.    This monkey is too well-known to need description. It is the common  acting monkey of the _bandar-wallas_, the delight of all  Anglo-Indian children, who go into raptures over the romance of  _Munsur-ram_ and _Chameli_, their quarrels, parting, and  reconciliation, so admirably acted by these miniature comedians.    NOTE.--For _Macacus rheso-similis_, Sclater, see P.Z.S. 1872, p. 495,  pl. xxv., also P.Z.S. 1875, p. 418.      NO. 19. INUUS _vel_ MACACUS PELOPS.  _Syn_.--MACACUS ASSAMENSIS.  _The Hill Monkey_ (_Jerdon's No. 8_).    HABITAT.--The Himalayan ranges and Assam.    DESCRIPTION.--Brownish grey, somewhat mixed with slaty, and rusty  brownish on the shoulders in some; beneath light ashy brown; fur  fuller and more wavy than in _rhesus_; canine teeth long; of stout  habit; callosities and face less red than in the last species  (_Jerdon_). Face flesh-coloured, but interspersed with a few black  hairs (_McClelland_).      NO. 20. INUUS _vel_ MACACUS NEMESTRINUS.  _The Pig-tailed Monkey_.    HABITAT.--Tenasserim and the Malay Archipelago.    [Figure: _Macacus nemestrinus_.]    DESCRIPTION.--General colour grizzled brown; the piles annulated  with dusky and fulvous; crown darker, and the middle of the back also  darker; the hair lengthened on the fore-quarters; the back stripe  extends along the tail, becoming almost black; the tail terminates  in a bright ferruginous tuft. This monkey is noted for its docility,  and in Bencoolen is trained to be useful as well as amusing. According  to Sir Stamford Raffles it is taught to climb the cocoa palms for  the fruit for its master, and to select only those that are ripe.      NO. 21. INUUS _vel_ MACACUS LEONINUS.  _The Long-haired Pig-tailed Monkey_.    HABITAT.--Arracan.    DESCRIPTION.--A thick-set powerful animal, with a broad, rather  flattened head above, and a moderately short, well clad, up-turned  tail, about one-third the length of the body and head; the female  smaller.--_Anderson_.    Face fleshy brown; whitish round the eyes and on the forehead;  eyebrows brownish, a narrow reddish line running out from the  external angle of the eye. The upper surface of the head is densely  covered with short dark fur, yellowish brown, broadly tipped with  black; the hair radiating from the vertex; on and around the ear the  hair is pale grey; above the external orbital angle and on the sides  of the face the hair is dense and directed backwards, pale greyish,  obscurely annulated with dusky brown, and this is prolonged  downwards to the middle of the throat. On the shoulders, back of the  neck, and upper part of the thighs, the hairs are very long, fully  three inches in the first-mentioned localities; the basal halves  greyish; and the remainder ringed with eleven bands of dark brown  and orange; the tips being dark. The middle and small of the back  is almost black, the shorter hair there being wholly dark; and this  colour is prolonged on the tail, which is tufted. The hair on the  chest is annulated, but paler than on the shoulders, and it is  especially dense on the lower part. The lower halves of the limbs  are also well clad with annulated fur, like their outsides, but their  upper halves internally and the belly are only sparsely covered with  long brownish grey plain hairs, not ringed.    The female differs from the male in the absence of the black on the  head and back, and in the hair of the under parts being brownish grey,  without annulations. The shoulders somewhat brighter than the rest  of the fur, which is yellowish olive; greyish olive on outside of  limbs; dusky on upper surface of hands and feet; and black on upper  surface of tail.    SIZE.--Length of male, head and body 23 inches; tail, without hair,  8 inches; with hair 10 inches.    The above description is taken from Dr. Anderson's account, 'Anat.  and Zool. Res.,' where at page 54 will be found a plate of the skull  showing the powerful canine teeth. Blyth mentions a fine male with  hair on the shoulders four to five inches long.      NO. 22. INUUS _vel_ MACACUS ARCTOIDES.  _The Brown Stump-tailed Monkey_.    HABITAT.--Cachar, Kakhyen Hills, east of Bhamo.    DESCRIPTION.--Upper surface of head and along the back dark brown,  almost blackish; sides and limbs dark brown; the hair, which is very  long, is ringed with light yellowish and dark brown, darker still  at the tips; face red; tail short and stumpy, little over an inch  long.
