We should now find ourselves able to enjoy those  wonderful works of literature which we had always been hearing about  from the lips of others, but had never been able to know directly. How  we should revel in the prospect before us! At last to be able to read  the \"Iliad\"! To follow the fortunes of wandering Ulysses! To accompany  Dante in his mystical journey through the three worlds! To dare with  Macbeth and to doubt with Hamlet! Our trouble would be that we should  not know which to select first. We should wish we had the eyes of an  insect that we might read them all at once.    We have a familiar expression in taking leave of our friends, \"Be good  to yourself!\" which, it will be seen, is the modern man's translation of  the old \"farewell,\" with the truly modern implication that the question  of his faring well will depend upon himself. But can we call a man good  to himself who does not avail himself of advantages that are freely open  to him and that others about him are embracing? The great men of the  past have been such because to their natural abilities they added an  acquaintance with the thought of the great men who preceded them. The  same is true of the men whom we are glad to honor among our  contemporaries. We may feel very sure that we are not heaven-descended  geniuses, or even possessed of unusual talent; and yet, if we do not  give ourselves the advantages that all those had who have won  distinction, we have certainly not given ourselves a fair chance to show  what is in us. Therefore, as a duty to ourselves, we must make the  acquaintance of the books that the common judgment of the world has  pronounced to be of the most value. They must become more than names to  us. We may not indeed find in all of them food for our own spirits, but  it is a part of our business in seeking a knowledge of mankind to know  the thoughts and thought-forms that men have found of most worth. It is  not to be supposed that we shall prize all these books equally; some of  them will never be more to us than great monuments which, for some  reason peculiar to our temperaments, do not appeal to us; but among  their number we shall find some that will throw open to our souls the  very gates of heaven--books that will raise our natures forevermore to a  higher power, as if from two-dimensional Flatland creatures we had  suddenly been advanced to three dimensions, or, in our own humdrum world  of length, breadth, and thickness, we had received the liberty of the  mysterious fourth dimension.    Let us now take a brief inventory of our heritage. We can glance at only  the most precious of these treasures, the crown jewels of the world's  literature, which are all ours, whether we choose to wear them or not.  But first let me make it plain that I am not assuming that all the great  monuments of human genius are literary. I am not forgetful of the fact  that literature is only one of the fine arts, that the Strassburg  Cathedral, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Rembrandt's School of Anatomy,  Michelangelo's Moses are all products of man's creative genius, records  of the life of God in the soul of man. But I do insist that literature  is the most inclusive and the most definite of all the arts, and that  therefore books unlock to us a vaster world than obeys the spell of any  other art. One man's soul may attain its transfiguration through  architecture or music or painting or sculpture as another does through  poetry; the great thing is to attain the transfiguration; and let us be  thankful for the many ways in which God fulfills himself to man. I am  not trying to make out a case for literature, but literature is my  subject, and what I say of it must be taken as equally friendly to all  the other great forms of human expression and often as equally  applicable to them.    We will not talk of a five-foot or a three-foot shelf, or one of any  other exact dimension, though I suspect that no very long range of space  would be required to hold all the supremely great books for whose  contents we should have room in our souls. The limitation will prove to  be in us rather than in the material of literature. The Bible, while  containing supremely great literature, has still higher claims, and for  the present discussion may be left to its special advocates. But  meanwhile our treasures are waiting for their inventory.    Literature for people of our race begins with Homer and is confined to  Europe and English America. This means in a very true sense that all the  literature which concerns us is modern, for the Greeks are the first and  perhaps the greatest of the moderns. They present us as their first  contribution the works that go under the name of Homer, and we need not  disturb ourselves now with the question whether the \"Iliad\" and the  \"Odyssey\" were both written by the same man, or even each written by a  single hand. The point is that we have in them an imperishable picture  of the life of a vanished world. Each is an epic of the natural man, the  one national, the other personal. In the \"Iliad\" we are plunged into  the thickening close of the ten years' war between the Greeks and  Trojans, during which the beautiful cause of all the trouble, Helen,  retains all her youthful bloom and, in fact, nobody seems to grow any  older. We have a crowded stage with many episodes and interests. In the  \"Odyssey\" we trace the fortunes of one man, Ulysses, during his return  from the war, which occupies him ten years, so that he is away from  home, as Rip Van Winkle was, twenty years; but, instead of finding  everybody grown old or dead, as Irving's hero did, he finds his wife  still young and attractive and beset by numerous suitors. We are very  glad to have this so, because we are all children at heart and want just  such an ending. The telling of these stories, while simple, is on a  lofty plane; the gods themselves take part in the passions of the  contestants and even in the warfare. The poet, no doubt, meant this for  what it professes to be; but I cannot help seeing in the embroiling of  Olympus a perhaps unrealized tribute of the poet to the greatness of the  human soul in the scale of the universe, a suggestion that moral and  spiritual values and powers outweigh the stars in their courses.    Great as are the works of Homer, we are not to suppose them the only  masterpieces in Greek literature. Certainly the three great dramatists  cannot be omitted, all so great, yet so unlike. These three, together  with two pastoral poets, one lyric poet, and the greatest of prose  poets, are vividly pictured by Mrs. Browning in the glowing stanzas of  her \"Wine of Cyprus.\"        Oh, our AEschylus, the thunderous!        How he drove the bolted breath      Through the cloud, to wedge the ponderous        In the gnarled oak beneath.      Oh, our Sophocles, the royal,        Who was born to monarch's place,      And who made the whole world loyal,        Less by kingly power than grace.      Our Euripides, the human,        With his droppings of warm tears,      And his touches of things common        Till they rose to touch the spheres!      Our Theocritus, our Bion,        And our Pindar's shining goals!--      These were cup-bearers undying        Of the wine that's meant for souls.      And my Plato, the divine one,        If men know the gods aright      By their motions as they shine on        With a glorious trail of light!--    It would not be surprising if some who read these lines should find more  food for mind and soul in Plato than in any other of the Greek writers.  Certainly those works of Plato and his contemporary, Xenophon, that  relate to the life, teachings, and death of Socrates are contributions  to a yet uncollected Bible of humanity, one more inclusive than that of  Jew or Christian.    It is one of the great misfortunes of Roman literature that the works of  its chief writers are used as textbooks for schools, a misfortune shared  to some extent by the Greek. Yet Homer and Xenophon, Vergil and Cicero,  did not write for children or callow youth. They belong to Longfellow's                grand old masters,        Whose mighty thoughts suggest      Life's endless toil and endeavor,    and their writings have no relation to adolescence. Yet it is to be  feared that most people who have read their works remember them as seen  through the cloudy medium of their own immaturity. Byron speaks of  reading and hating Horace as a schoolboy, but no normal person can hate  Horace any more than he can hate Washington Irving. It is possible,  however, that pupils who have to read Irving's \"Sketch Book\" with the  fear of a college entrance examination before their minds may have no  affection even for him. So some of us may have something to unlearn in  our reading of Vergil and Horace, for we must approach their works as  strong meat for mature minds. Vergil's theme is nothing less than the  glorification of the Roman state through its divinely ordered and heroic  founding. School children seldom read more than the six books of the  \"Aeneid\" required for college; but the other six, though of much less  varied interest, are necessary for the appreciation of the poem. The  whole is a work that no one can afford to pass over in his search for  the burning words that keep alive the thought of other ages. Very  different in theme and manner is the poetry of Horace. He is the most  modern of all the men of old, far more modern than our own Puritan  ancestors. His mixture of grace and shrewdness, poetic charm and worldly  wisdom, we find nowhere else. The bulk of his work is not large, and  this fact, as in the case of Gray and Keats and Poe, is rather in his  favor, because the reader can easily become familiar with it all, though  then he will sigh for more. Horace wears well; the older we grow the  better we like him. He has"]]]
