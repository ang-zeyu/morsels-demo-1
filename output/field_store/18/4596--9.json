But he didn't see all de trick,  bless God!    We found out afterwards dat he told his mammy about it. She worked at  de big house and she stole something for him to give dat low white  trash I reckon, 'cause de next day he played sick along in de evening  and de black overlooker--he was my uncle--sent him back to de  quarters.    He never did git there, but when dey started de hunt dey found him  about a mile away in de woods wid his head shot off, and old Master  sold his mammy to a trader right away. He never whipped his grown  niggers.    Dat was de way it worked. Dey was all kinds of white folks jest like  dey is now. One man in Sesesh clothes would shoot you if you tried to  run away. Maybe another Sesesh would help slip you out to the  underground and say \"God bless you poor black devil\", and some of dem  dat was poor would help you if you could bring 'em sumpin you stole,  lak a silver dish or spoons or a couple big hams. I couldn't blame  them poor white folks, wid the men in the War and the women and  children hongry. The niggers didn't belong to them nohow, and they had  to live somehow. But now and then they was a devil on earth, walking  in the sight of God and spreading iniquity before him. He was de  low-down Sesesh dat would take what a poor runaway nigger had to give  for his chance to git away, and den give him 'structions dat would  lead him right into de hands of de patrollers and git him caught or  shot!    Yes, dat's de way it was. Devils and good people walking in de road at  de same time, and nobody could tell one from t'other.    I remember about de trickery so good 'cause I was \"grown and out\" at  that time. When I was a little boy I was a house boy, 'cause my mammy  was the house woman, but when the war broke I already been sent to the  fields and mammy was still at de house.    I was born on July 25, 1832. I know, 'cause old Master keep de book on  his slaves jest like on his own family. He was a good man, and old  Mistress was de best woman in de world!    De plantation had more than 500 acres and most was in cotton and  tobacco. But we raised corn and oats, and lots of cattle and horses,  and plenty of sheep for wool.    I was born on the plantation, soon after my pappy and mammy was  brought to it. I don't remember whether they was bought or come from  my Mistress's father. He was mighty rich and had several hundred  niggers. When she was married he give her 40 niggers. One of them was  my pappy's brother. His name was John, and he was my master's  overlooker.    We called a white man boss the \"overseer\", but a nigger was a  overlooker. John could read and write and figger, and old Master  didn't have no white overseer.    Master's name was Levi Dawson, and his plantation was 18 miles east of  Greenville, North Carolina. It was a beautiful place, with all the  fences around the Big House and along the front made out of barked  poles, rider style, and all whitewashed.    The Big House set back from the big road about a quarter of a mile. It  was only one story, but it had lots of rooms.    There was four rooms in a bunch on one side and four in a bunch on the  other, with a wide hall in between. They was made of square adzed  logs, all weatherboarded on the outside and planked up and plastered  on the inside. Then they was a long gallery clean across the front  with big pillars made out of bricks and plastered over. They called it  the passage 'cause it din't have no floor excepting bricks, and a  buggy could drive right under it. Mostly it was used to set under and  talk and play cards and drink the best whiskey old Master could buy.    Back in behind the big house was the kitchen, and the smokehouse in  another place made of plank, and all was whitewashed and painted white  all the time.    Old Mistress was named Miss Susie and she was born an Isley. She  brought 40 niggers from her pappy as a present, and Master Levi jest  had 4 or 5, but he had got all his land from his pappy. She had the  niggers and he had the land. That's the way it was, and that's the way  it stayed! She never let him punish one of her niggers and he never  asked her about buying or selling land. Her pappy was richer than his  pappy, and she was sure quality!    My pappy's name was Anthony, and mammy's name was Chanie. He was the  blacksmith and fixed the wagons, but he couldn't read and figger like  uncle John. Mammy was the head house woman but didn't know any letters  either.    They was both black like me. Old man Isley, where they come from, had  lots of niggers, but I don't think they was off the boat.    You can set the letters up and I can't tell them, but you can't fool  me with the figgers, 'less they are mighty big numbers.    Master Levi had three sons and no daughters. The oldest son was  Simeon. He was in the Sesesh army. The other two boys was too young. I  can't remember their names. They was a lot younger and I was grown and  out befo' they got big.    Old Master was a fine Christian but he like his juleps anyways. He let  us niggers have preachings and prayers, and would give us a parole to  go 10 or 15 miles to a camp meeting and stay two or three days with  nobody but Uncle John to stand for us. Mostly we had white preachers,  but when we had a black preacher that was Heaven.    We didn't have no voodoo women nor conjure folks at our 20 acres. We  all knowed about the Word and the unseen Son of God and we didn't put  no stock in conjure.    Course we had luck charms and good and bad signs, but everybody got  dem things even nowadays. My boy had a white officer in the Big War  and he tells me that man had a li'l old doll tied around his wrist on  a gold chain.    We used herbs and roots for common ailments, like sassafras and  boneset and peach tree poultices and coon root tea, but when a nigger  got bad sick Old Master sent for a white doctor. I remember that old  doctor. He lived in Greenville and he had to come 18 miles in a buggy.    When he give some nigger medicine he would be afraid the nigger was  like lots of them that believed in conjure, and he would say, \"If you  don't take that medicine like I tell you and I have to come back here  to see you I going to break your dam black neck next time I come out  here!\"    When it was bad weather sometime the black boy sent after him had to  carry a lantern to show him the way back. If that nigger on his mule  got too fur ahead so old doctor couldn't see de light he sho' catch de  devil from that old doctor and from old Master, too, less'n he was one  of old Missy's house niggers, and then old Master jest grumble to  satisfy the doctor.    Down in the quarters we had the spinning house, where the old woman  card the wool and run the loom. They made double weave for the winter  time, and all the white folks and slaves had good clothes and good  food.    Master made us all eat all we could hold. He would come to the  smokehouse and look in and say, \"You niggers ain't cutting down that  smoke side and that souse lak you ought to! You made dat meat and you  got to help eat it up!\"    Never no work on Sunday 'cepting the regular chores. The overlooker  made everybody clean up and wash de children up and after the praying  we had games. Antny over and marbles and \"I Spy\" and de likes of that.  Some times de boys would go down in de woods and git a possum. I love  possum and sweet taters, but de coon meat more delicate and de har  don't stink up de meat.    I wasn't at the quarters much as a boy. I was at the big house with my  mammy, and I had to swing the fly bresh over my old Mistress when she  was sewing or eating or taking her nap. Sometime I would keep the  flies off'n old Master, and when I would get tired and let the bresh  slap his neck he would kick at me and cuss me, but he never did reach  me. He had a way of keeping us little niggers scared to death and  never hurting nobody.    I was down in the field burning bresh when I first heard the guns in  the War. De fighting was de battle at Kingston, North Carolina, and it  lasted four days and nights. After while bunches of Sesesh come riding  by hauling wounded people in wagons, and then pretty soon big bunches  of Yankees come by, but dey didn't ack like dey was trying very hard  to ketch up.    Dey had de country in charge quite some time, and they had forages  coming round all the time. By dat time old Master done buried his  money and all de silver and de big clock, but the Yankees didn't pear  to search out dat kind of stuff. All dey ask about was did anybody  find a bottle of brandy!    When de War ended up most all de niggers stay with old Master and work  on de shares, until de land git divided up and sold off and the young  niggers git scattered to town.    I never did have no truck wid de Ku Kluckers, but I had to step mighty  high to keep out'n it! De sho' nuff Kluxes never did bother around us  'cause we minded our own business and never give no trouble.    We wouldn't let no niggers come 'round our place talking 'bout  delegates and voting, and we jest all stayed on the place. But dey was  some low white trash and some devilish niggers made out like dey was  Ku Klux ranging 'round de country stealing hosses and taking things.  Old Master said dey wasn't shore enough, so I reckon he knowed who the  regular ones was.    These bunches that come around robbing got into our neighborhood and  old Master told me I better not have my old horse at the house, 'cause  if I had him they would know nobody had been there stealing and it  wouldn't do no good to hide anything 'cause they would tear up the  place hunting what I had and maybe whip or kill me.    \"Your old hoss aint no good, Tony, and you better kill him to make  them think you already been raided on,\" old Master told me, so I led  him out and knocked him in the head with an axe, and then we hid all  our grub and waited for the Kluckers"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20788"],[0,"Storm Over Warlock (#12)"],[1,".    \"Grab hold!\" Shann was giving the orders now. \"By the look of that  opening we had better try crawling. I've a torch on at low----\"    \"Good enough.\" The other's fingers fumbled on the band about Shann's  slim waist until they gripped tight at his back. He started on into the  opening, drawing Thorvald by that hold with him.    Luckily, they did not have to crawl far, for shortly past the entrance  the fault or vein they were following became a passage high enough for  even the tall Thorvald to travel without stooping. And then only a  little later he released his hold on Shann, reporting he could now see  well enough to manage on his own.    The torch beam caught on a wall and awoke from there a glitter which  hurt their eyes--a green-gold cluster of crystals. Several feet on,  there was another flash of embedded crystals. Those might promise  priceless wealth, but neither Terran paused to examine them more closely  or touch their surfaces. From time to time Shann whistled. And always he  was answered by the wolverines, their calls coming from ahead. So the  men continued to hope that they were not walking into a trap from which  the Throgs could extract them.    \"Snap off your torch a moment!\" Thorvald ordered.    Shann obeyed. The subdued light vanished. Yet there was still light to  be seen--ahead and above.    \"Front door,\" Thorvald observed. \"How do we get up?\"    The torch showed them that, a narrow ladder of ledges branching off when  the passage they followed took a turn to the left and east. Afterward  Shann remembered that climb with wonder that they had actually made it,  though their advance had been slow, passing the torch from one to  another to make sure of their footing.    Shann was top man when a last spurt of effort enabled him to draw  himself out into the open, his hands raw, his nails broken and torn. He  sat there, stupefied with his own weariness, to stare about.    Thorvald called impatiently, and Shann reached for the torch to hold it  for the officer. Then Thorvald crawled out; he, too, looked around in  dull surprise.    On either side, peaks cut high into the amber of the sky. But this bowl  in which the men had found refuge was rich in growing things. Though the  trees were stunted, the grass grew almost as high here as it did on the  meadows of the lowlands. Quartering the pocket valley, galloped the  wolverines, expressing in that wild activity their delight in this  freedom.    \"Good campsite.\"    Thorvald shook his head. \"We can't stay here.\"    And, to underline that gloomy prophesy, there issued from that hole  through which they had just come, muffled and broken, but still  threatening, the howl of the Throgs' hound.    The Survey officer caught the torch from Shann's hold and knelt to flash  it into the interior of the passage. As the beam slowly circled that  opening, he held out his other arm, measuring the size of the aperture.    \"When that thing gets on a hot scent\"--he snapped off the beam--\"the  beetle-heads won't be able to control it. There will be no reason for  them to attempt to. Those hounds obey their first orders: kill--or  capture. And I think this one operates on 'capture.' So they'll loose it  to run ahead of their party.\"    \"And we move to knock it out?\" Shann relied now on the other's  experience.    Thorvald rose. \"It would need a blaster on full power to finish off a  hound. No, we can't kill it. But we can make it a doorkeeper to our  advantage.\" He trotted down into the valley, Shann beside him without  understanding in the least, but aware that Thorvald did have some plan.  The officer bent, searched the ground, and began to pull from under the  loose surface dirt one of those nets of tough vines which they had used  for cords. He thrust a double handful of this hasty harvest into Shann's  hold with a single curt order: \"Twist these together and make as thick a  rope as you can!\"    Shann twisted, discovering to his pleased surprise that under pressure  the vines exuded a sticky purple sap which not only coated his hands,  but also acted as an adhesive for the vines themselves so that his task  was not nearly as formidable as it had first seemed. With his force ax  Thorvald cut down two of the stunted trees and stripped them of  branches, wedging the poles into the rocks about the entrance of the  hole.    They were working against time, but on Thorvald's part with practiced  efficiency. Twice more that cry of the hunter arose from the depths  behind them. As the westering sun, almost down now, shone into the  valley hollow Thorvald set up the frame of his trap.    \"We can't knock it out, any more than we can knock out a Throg. But a  beam from a stunner ought to slow it up long enough for this to work.\"    Taggi burst out of the grass, approaching the hole with purpose. And  Togi was right at his heels. Both of them stared into that opening,  drooling a little, the same eagerness in their pose as they had  displayed when hunting. Shann remembered how that first howl of the  Throg hound had drawn both animals to the edge of the occupied camp in  spite of their marked distaste for its alien masters.    \"They're after it too.\" He told Thorvald what he had noted on the night  of their sortie.    \"Maybe they can keep it occupied,\" the other commented. \"But we don't  want them to actually mix with it; that might be fatal.\"    A clamor broke out in the interior passage. Taggi snarled, backing away  a few steps before he uttered his own war cry.    \"Ready!\" Thorvald jumped to the net slung from the poles; Shann raised  his stunner.    Togi underlined her mate's challenge with a series of snarls rising in  volume. There was a tearing, scrambling sound from within. Then Shann  fired at the jack-in-the-box appearance of a monstrous head, and  Thorvald released the deadfall.    The thing squalled. Ropes beat, growing taut. The wolverines backed from  jaws which snapped fruitlessly. To Shann's relief the Terran animals  appeared content to bait the now imprisoned--or collared--horror,  without venturing to make any close attack.    But he reckoned that too soon. Perhaps the stunner had slowed up the  hound's reflexes, for those jaws stilled with a last shattering snap,  the toad-lizard mask--a head which was against all nature as the Terrans  knew it--was quiet in the strangle leash of the rope, the rest of the  body serving as a cork to fill the exit hole. Taggi had been waiting  only for such a chance. He sprang, claws ready. And Togi went in after  her mate to share the battle.          7. UNWELCOME GUIDE      There was a small eruption of earth and stone as the hound came alive,  fighting to reach its tormentors. The resulting din was deafening.  Shann, avoiding by a hand's breadth a snap of jaws with power to crush  his leg into bone powder and mangled flesh, cuffed Togi across her nose  and buried his hands in the fur about Taggi's throat as he heaved the  male wolverine back from the struggling monster. He shouted orders, and  to his surprise Togi did obey, leaving him free to yank Taggi away.  Perhaps neither wolverine had expected the full fury of the hound.    Though he suffered a slash across the back of one hand, delivered by the  over-excited Taggi, in the end Shann was able to get both animals away  from the hole, now corked so effectively by the slavering thing.  Thorvald was actually laughing as he watched his younger companion in  action.    \"This ought to slow up the beetles! If they haul their little doggie  back, it's apt to take out some of its rage on them, and I'd like to see  them dig around it.\"    Considering that the monstrous head was swinging from side to side in a  collar of what seemed to be immovable rocks, Shann thought Thorvald  right. He went down on his knees beside the wolverines, soothing them  with hand and voice, trying to get them to obey his orders willingly.    \"Ha!\" Thorvald brought his mud-stained hands together with a clap, the  sharp sound attracting the attention of both animals.    Shann scrambled up, swung out his bleeding hand in the simple motion  which meant to hunt, being careful to signal down the valley westward.  Taggi gave a last reluctant growl at the hound, to be answered by one of  its ear-torturing howls, and then trotted off, Togi tagging behind.    Thorvald caught Shann's slashed hand, inspecting the bleeding cut. From  the aid packet at his belt he brought out powder and a strip of  protecting plasta-flesh to cleanse and bind the wound.    \"You'll do,\" he commented. \"But we'd better get out of here before full  dark.\"    The small paradise of the valley was no safe campsite. It could not be  so long as that monstrosity on the hillside behind them roared and  howled its rage to the darkening sky. Trailing the wolverines, the men  caught up with the animals drinking from a small spring and thankfully  shared that water. Then they pushed on, not able to forget that  somewhere in the peaks about must lurk the Throg flyer ready to attack  on sight.    Only darkness could not be held off by the will of men. Here in the open  there was no chance to use the torch. As long as they were within the  valley boundaries the phosphorescent bushes marked a path. But by the  coming of complete darkness they were once more out in a region of bare  rock.    The wolverines had killed a brace of skitterers, consuming hide and soft  bones as well as the meager flesh which was not enough to satisfy their  hunger. However, to Shann's relief, they did not wander too far ahead.  And as the men stopped at last on a ledge where a fall of rock gave them  some limited shelter both animals crowded in against the humans, adding  the heat of their bodies to the slight comfort of that cramped resting  place.    From time to time Shann was startled out of a troubled half sleep by the  howl of the hound. Luckily that sound never seemed any louder. If the  Throgs had caught up with their hunter, and certainly they must have "]]]
