He remembered the many stories he had listened to of this very  thing that was now happening, so, crushing down his excitement as well  as he could, he cocked his rifle and awaited the charge.  He knew that  it was of no use to fire at the head of the advancing foe, as the  thickness of the skull, together with the matted hair on the forehead,  rendered it impervious to a bullet.    When the bull was within a yard of him he leaped lightly to one side and  it passed.  Just as it did so, Dick aimed at its heart and fired, but  his knowledge of the creature's anatomy was not yet correct.  The ball  entered the shoulder too high, and the bull, checking himself as well as  he could in his headlong rush, turned round and made at Dick again.    The failure coupled with the excitement proved too much for Dick; he  could not resist discharging his second barrel at the brute's head as it  came on.  He might as well have fired at a brick wall; it shook its  shaggy front, and with a hideous bellow thundered forward.  Again Dick  sprang to one side, but in doing so a tuft of grass or a stone caught  his foot, and he fell heavily to the ground.    Up to this point Crusoe's admirable training had nailed him to the spot  where he had been left, although the twitching of every fibre in his  body and a low continuous whine showed how gladly he would have hailed  permission to join in the combat; but the instant he saw his master down  and the buffalo turning to charge again, he sprang forward with a roar  that would have done credit to his bovine enemy, and seized him by the  nose.  So vigorous was the rush that he well-nigh pulled the bull down  on its side.  One toss of its head, however, sent Crusoe high into the  air, but it accomplished this feat at the expense of its nose, which was  torn and lacerated by the dog's teeth.    Scarcely had Crusoe touched the ground, which he did with a sounding  thump, than he sprang up and flew at his adversary again.  This time,  however, he adopted the plan of barking furiously and biting by rapid  yet terrible snaps as he found opportunity, thus keeping the bull  entirely engrossed, and affording Dick an opportunity of re-loading his  rifle, which he was not slow to do.  Dick then stepped close up, and,  while the two combatants were roaring in each other's face; he shot the  buffalo through the heart.  It fell to the earth with a deep groan.    Crusoe's rage instantly vanished on beholding this, and he seemed to be  filled with tumultuous joy at his master's escape, for he gambolled  round him, and whined and fawned upon him in a manner that could not be  misunderstood.    \"Good dog; thank'ee, my pup,\" said Dick, patting Crusoe's head as he  stooped to brush the dust from his leggings; \"I don't know what would  ha' become o' me but for your help, Crusoe.\"    Crusoe turned his head a little to one side, wagged his tail, and looked  at Dick with an expression that said quite plainly, \"I'd die for you, I  would--not once, or twice, but ten times, fifty times if need be--and  that not merely to save your life, but even to please you.\"    There is no doubt whatever that Crusoe felt something of this sort.  The  love of a Newfoundland dog to its master is beyond calculation or  expression.  He who once gains such love carries the dog's life in his  hand.  But let him who reads note well, and remember, that there is only  one coin that can purchase such love, and that is _kindness_; the coin,  too, must be genuine.  Kindness merely _expressed_ will not do, it must  be _felt_.    \"Hallo! boy, ye've bin i' the wars!\" exclaimed Joe, raising himself from  his task as Dick and Crusoe returned.    \"You look more like it than I do,\" retorted Dick, laughing.    This was true, for cutting up a buffalo carcase with no other instrument  than a large knife is no easy matter.  Yet western hunters and Indians  can do it without cleaver or saw, in a way that would surprise a  civilised butcher not a little.  Joe was covered with blood up to the  elbows.  His hair, happening to have a knack of getting into his eyes,  had been so often brushed off with bloody hands, that his whole visage  was speckled with gore, and his dress was by no means immaculate.    While Dick related his adventure, or _mis-adventure_ with the bull, Joe  and Henri completed the cutting out of the most delicate portions of the  buffalo, namely, the hump on its shoulder--which is a choice piece, much  finer than the best beef--and the tongue, and a few other parts.  The  tongues of buffaloes are superior to those of domestic cattle.  When all  was ready the meat was slung across the back of the pack-horse, and the  party, remounting their horses, continued their journey, having first  cleansed themselves as well as they could in the rather dirty waters of  an old wallow.    \"See,\" said Henri, turning to Dick and pointing to a circular spot of  green as they rode along, \"that is one old _dry_ waller.\"    \"Ay,\" remarked Joe, \"after the waller dries, it becomes a ring o'  greener grass than the rest o' the plain, as ye see.  'Tis said the  first hunters used to wonder greatly at these myster'ous circles, and  they invented all sorts o' stories to account for 'em.  Some said they  wos fairy-rings, but at last they comed to know they wos nothin' more  nor less than places where buffaloes wos used to waller in.  It's often  seemed to me that if we knowed the _raisons_ o' things we wouldn't be so  much puzzled wi' them as we are.\"    The truth of this last remark was so self-evident and incontrovertible  that it elicited no reply, and the three friends rode on for a  considerable time in silence.    It was now past noon, and they were thinking of calling a halt for a  short rest to the horses and a pipe to themselves, when Joe was heard to  give vent to one of those peculiar hisses that always accompanied either  a surprise or a caution.  In the present case it indicated both.    \"What now, Joe?\"    \"Injuns!\" ejaculated Joe.    \"Eh! fat you say? ou is de?\"    Crusoe at this moment uttered a low growl.  Ever since the day he had  been partially roasted he had maintained a rooted antipathy to Red-men.  Joe immediately dismounted, and placing his ear to the ground listened  intently.  It is a curious fact that by placing the ear close to the  ground sounds can be heard distinctly which could not be heard at all if  the listener were to maintain an erect position.    \"They're arter the buffalo,\" said Joe, rising, \"an' I think it's likely  they're a band o' Pawnees.  Listen an' ye'll hear their shouts quite  plain.\"    Dick and Henri immediately lay down and placed their ears to the ground.    \"Now, me hear noting,\" said Henri, jumping up, \"but me ear is like me  eyes; ver' short-sighted.\"    \"I do hear something,\" said Dick as he got up, \"but the beating o' my  own heart makes row enough to spoil my hearin'.\"    Joe Blunt smiled.  \"Ah! lad, yer young an' yer blood's too hot yet, but  bide a bit; you'll cool down soon.  I wos like you once.  Now, lads,  what think ye we should do?\"    \"You know best, Joe.\"    \"Oui, nodoubtedly.\"    \"Then wot I advise is that we gallop to the broken sand hillocks ye see  yonder, get behind them an' take a peep at the Red-skins.  If they are  Pawnees we'll go up to them at once; if not, we'll hold a council o' war  on the spot.\"    Having arranged this they mounted and hastened towards the hillocks in  question, which they reached after ten minutes' gallop, at full stretch.  The sandy mounds afforded them concealment, and enabled them to watch  the proceedings of the savages in the plain below.  The scene was the  most curious and exciting that can be conceived.  The centre of the  plain before them was crowded with hundreds of buffaloes, which were  dashing about in the most frantic state of alarm.  To whatever point  they galloped they were met by yelling savages on horseback, who could  not have been fewer in numbers than a thousand--all being armed with  lance, bow, and quiver, and mounted on active little horses.  The  Indians had completely surrounded the herd of buffaloes, and were now  advancing steadily towards them, gradually narrowing the circle, and,  whenever the terrified animals endeavoured to break through the line,  they rushed to that particular spot in a body, and scared them back  again into the centre.    Thus they advanced until they closed in on their prey, and formed an  unbroken circle round them, whilst the poor brutes kept eddying and  surging to and fro in a confused mass, hooking and climbing upon each  other, and bellowing furiously.  Suddenly the horsemen made a rush, and  the work of destruction began.  The tremendous turmoil raised a cloud of  dust that obscured the field in some places, and hid it from our  hunters' view.  Some of the Indians galloped round and round the circle,  sending their arrows whizzing up to the feathers in the sides of the  fattest cows.  Others dashed fearlessly into the midst of the black  heaving mass, and, with their long lances, pierced dozens of them to the  heart.  In many instances the buffaloes, infuriated by wounds, turned  fiercely on their assailants and gored the horses to death, in which  cases the men had to trust to their nimble legs for safety.  Sometimes a  horse got jammed in the centre of the swaying mass, and could neither  advance nor retreat.  Then the savage rider leaped upon the buffaloes'  backs, and springing from one to another, like an acrobat, gained the  outer edge of the circle, not failing, however, in his strange flight,  to pierce with his lance several of the fattest of his stepping-stones  as he sped along.    A few of the herd succeeded in escaping from the blood"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],[0,"The Gorilla Hunters (#12)"],[1,"standing  on a low rock, which I instantly recognised to be pelicans.    \"Surely,\" said I, \"pelicans are not new to you!\"    \"Certainly not; but if you look a little more attentively, I think you  will find material for your note-book.\"    Jack was right.  I observed a very fine fish-hawk circling over the head  of one of the pelicans.  Its head and neck were white, and its body was  of a reddish chocolate colour.  Just as we came in sight, the pelican  caught a fine fish, which it stowed away safe in the pouch under its  chin.  The sly hawk, which had been watching for this, immediately made  a descent towards its victim, making a considerable noise with its wings  as it came down.  Hearing this, the pelican looked hastily up, and  supposing that a terrible and deadly assault was about to be made,  opened its mouth and screamed in terror.  This was just what the hawk  wanted.  The open bill revealed the fish in the pouch.  Down he swooped,  snatched it out, and then soared away with his ill-gotten gains in his  talons.    \"Oh, what a thief!\" exclaimed Peterkin.    \"And the pelican seems to take his loss in a remarkably philosophical  manner,\" observed Jack.    To my surprise the great stupid bird, instead of flying away, as I had  expected, quietly resumed his fishing as if nothing had happened.  No  doubt he was well pleased to find himself still alive, and it is not  improbable that the hawk made several more meals at the expense of his  long-beaked friend after we had passed by.    We soon put him to flight, however, by landing near the spot where he  stood, this being the place where we were to quit our canoes and pass  through the jungle on foot.  The hunters now prepared themselves for  action, for the recent tracks of elephants were seen on the bank of the  stream, and the natives said they could not be far off.  Jack and  Peterkin were armed with immensely heavy rifles, which carried balls of  the weight of six-ounces.  I carried my trusty, double-barrelled  fowling-piece, which is of the largest size, and which I preferred to a  rifle, because, not being a good shot, I resolved, on all occasions, to  reserve my fire until we should come to close quarters with game,  leaving my more expert comrades to take the longer shots.  We had also  two natives--one being our guide, Makarooroo, who carried Jack and  Peterkin's double-barrelled guns as a reserve.  These were loaded, of  course, with ball.    \"This looks something like business,\" said Jack, as he leaned on his  heavy rifle and looked at the natives, who were selecting their spears  and otherwise making preparations.    \"It does,\" replied Peterkin.  \"Are you loaded?\"    \"Ay, and I have just examined the caps to see that they are dry; for  it's not like grouse-shooting on the Scottish hills this African  hunting, depend upon it.  A snapping cap might cost us our lives,--  Ralph, my boy, you must keep well in rear.  I don't want to hurt your  feelings, but it won't do to go in front when you cannot depend on your  nerves.\"    I experienced a feeling of sadness not unmingled with shame as my friend  said this, but I could not question the justness of his remark, and I  knew well that he would not have made it at all, but for his anxiety  lest I should run recklessly into danger, which I might find myself,  when too late, unable to cope with.  I was careful, however, to conceal  my feelings as I replied with a smile--    \"You are right, Jack.  I shall act the part of a support, while you and  Peterkin skirmish in advance.\"    \"And be careful,\" said Peterkin, solemnly, \"that you don't fire into us  by mistake.\"    Somewhat of Peterkin's own spirit came over me as I replied, \"Indeed, I  have been thinking of that, and I'm not sure that I can restrain myself  when I see a chimpanzee monkey and a gorilla walking through the woods  before me.\"    \"I think we'd better take his gun from him,\" suggested Jack.    At this moment the king gave the signal to advance, so we shouldered our  weapons and joined him.  As we walked rapidly along, Jack suggested that  we should allow the natives to kill any elephants we might fall in with  in their own way, so as to observe how they managed it, rather than try  to push ourselves forward on this our first expedition.  We all agreed  to this, and shortly after we came to the place which elephants were  known to frequent.    Here great preparations had evidently been made for them.  A space of  more than a mile was partially enclosed by what might be termed a vine  wall.  The huge, thorny, creeping vines had been torn down from the  trees and woven into a rude sort of network, through which it was almost  impossible for any animal except an elephant to break.  This was  intended--not to stop the elephant altogether, but to entangle and  retard him in his flight, until the hunters could kill him with their  spears.  The work, we were given to understand, was attended with  considerable danger, for some of the natives were occasionally caught by  the thorny vines when flying from the charge of the infuriated animal,  and were instantly stamped to death by his ponderous feet.    I felt a new and powerful excitement creep over me as I saw the natives  extend themselves in a wide semicircle of nearly two miles in extent,  and begin to advance with loud shouts and cries, in order to drive the  game towards the vines, and the flashing eyes and compressed lips of my  two companions showed that they were similarly affected.  We determined  to keep together and follow close on that part of the line where the  king was.    \"You no be 'fraid?\" said Makarooroo, looking down at Peterkin, who, he  evidently supposed, was neither mentally nor physically adapted for an  African hunter.    Peterkin was so tickled with the question that he suddenly began to  tremble like an aspen leaf, and to chatter with his teeth and display  all the symptoms of abject terror.  Pointing over Makarooroo's shoulder  into the bush behind him, he gasped, \"The leopard!\"    The negro uttered a hideous yell, and springing nearly his own height  into the air, darted behind a tree with the agility of a wild-cat.    Instantly Peterkin resumed his composure, and turning round with a look  of cool surprise, said--    \"What! you're not afraid, Makarooroo?\"  The good-humoured fellow burst  into a loud laugh on perceiving the practical joke that had been passed  on him, and it was evident that the incident, trifling though it was,  had suddenly raised his estimation of Peterkin to a very exalted pitch.    We now began to draw near to the enclosure, and I was beginning to fear  that our hunt was to prove unsuccessful that day.  A considerable  quantity of small game had passed us, alarmed by the cries of the  natives; but we purposely withheld our fire, although I saw that Jack  was sorely tempted once or twice, when several beautiful gazelles and  one or two wild pigs ran past within shot.  Presently we heard a shrill  trumpeting sound, which Peterkin, who had hunted in the forests of  Ceylon, told us, in an excited voice, was the cry of the elephant.  We  hastened forward with our utmost speed, when suddenly we were brought to  a stand by hearing a tremendous roar close in front of us.  Immediately  after, a large male lion bounded from among the bushes, and with one  stroke of his enormous paw struck down a negro who stood not twenty  yards from us.  The terrible brute stood for an instant or two, lashing  his sides with his tail and glaring defiance.  It chanced that I  happened to be nearest to him, and that the position of the tangled  underwood prevented my companions from taking good aim; so without  waiting for them, being anxious to save, if possible, the life of the  prostrate negro, I fired both barrels into the lion's side.  Giving  utterance to another terrible roar, he bounded away into the bush,  scattering the negroes who came in his way, and made his escape, to our  great disappointment.    We found, to our horror, on going up to the fallen hunter, that he was  quite dead.  His skull had been literally smashed in, as if it had  received a blow from a sledge-hammer.    I cannot describe my feelings on beholding thus, for the first time, the  king of beasts in all the savage majesty of strength and freedom,  coupled with the terrible death of a human being.  My brain was in a  whirl of excitement; I scarce knew what I was doing.  But I had no time  to think, for almost immediately after firing the shots at the lion, two  elephants came crashing through the bushes.  One was between ten and  eleven feet high, the other could not have been less than twelve feet.  I had never seen anything like this in the menageries of England, and  their appearance, as they burst thus suddenly on my vision, was  something absolutely appalling.    Those who have only seen the comparatively small and sluggish animals  that are wont to ring their bells to attract attention, and to feed on  gingerbread nuts from the hands of little boys, can form no idea of the  terrible appearance of the gigantic monsters of Africa as they go  tearing in mad fury through the forests with their enormous ears, and  tails, and trunks erect, their ponderous tusks glistening in the  sunshine, and their wicked little eyes flashing like balls of fire as  they knock down, rend asunder, and overturn all that comes in their way.    The two that now approached us in full career were flying before a crowd  of negroes who had already fixed a number of spears in their sides, from  which the blood was flowing copiously.  To say that the bushes went down  before them like grass would not give a correct idea of the ponderous  rush of these creatures.  Trees of three and four inches diameter were  run against and snapped off like twigs, without proving in any degree  obstructive.    By this time the negroes had crowded in from all sides, and as the  elephants approached the place where we stood, a perfect"]]]
