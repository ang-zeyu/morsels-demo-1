Good-by.\"    \"So long.\"    And Mr. Chase walked on with long strides to the Cob.           *       *       *       *       *    The days passed slowly. I saw nothing more of Phyllis or her sister.  The professor I met once or twice on the links. I had taken earnestly  to golf in this time of stress. Golf, it has been said, is the game of  disappointed lovers. On the other hand, it has further been pointed  out that it does not follow that, because a man is a failure as a  lover, he will be any good at all on the links. My game was distinctly  poor at first. But a round or two put me back into my proper form,  which is fair. The professor's demeanor at these accidental meetings  on the links was a faithful reproduction of his attitude on the beach.  Only by a studied imitation of the absolute stranger did he show that  he had observed my presence.    Once or twice after dinner, when Ukridge was smoking one of his  special cigars while Mrs. Ukridge petted Edwin (now moving in society  once more, and in his right mind), I walked out across the fields  through the cool summer night till I came to the hedge that shut off  the Derricks' grounds. Not the hedge through which I had made my first  entrance, but another, lower, and nearer the house. Standing there  under the shade of a tree I could see the lighted windows of the  drawing-room.    Generally there was music inside, and, the windows being opened on  account of the warmth of the night, I was able to make myself a little  more miserable by hearing Phyllis sing. It deepened the feeling of  banishment.    I shall never forget those furtive visits. The intense stillness of  the night, broken by an occasional rustling in the grass or the hedge;  the smell of the flowers in the garden beyond; the distant drone of  the sea.        \"God makes sech nights, all white and still,        Fur'z you can look and listen.\"    Another day had generally begun before I moved from my hiding place,  and started for home, surprised to find my limbs stiff and my clothes  bathed with dew.    Life seemed a poor institution during these days.          I ENLIST A MINION'S SERVICES    X      It would be interesting to know to what extent the work of authors is  influenced by their private affairs. If life is flowing smoothly for  them, are the novels they write in that period of content colored with  optimism? And if things are running crosswise, do they work off the  resultant gloom on their faithful public? If, for instance, Mr. W. W.  Jacobs had toothache, would he write like Mr. Hall Caine? If Maxim  Gorky were invited to lunch by the Czar, would he sit down and dash  off a trifle in the vein of Mr. Dooley? Probably great authors have  the power of detaching their writing self from their living, workaday  self. For my own part, the frame of mind in which I now found myself  completely altered the scheme of my novel. I had designed it as a  light-comedy effort. Here and there a page or two to steady the  reader, and show him what I could do in the way of pathos if I cared  to try; but in the main a thing of sunshine and laughter. But now  great slabs of gloom began to work themselves into the scheme of it.  Characters whom I had hitherto looked upon as altogether robust  developed fatal illnesses. A magnificent despondency became the  keynote of the book. Instead of marrying, my hero and heroine had a  big scene in the last chapter, at the end of which she informed him  that she was already secretly wedded to another, a man with whom she  had not even a sporting chance of being happy. I could see myself  correcting proofs made pulpy by the tears of emotional printers.    It would not do. I felt that I must make a determined effort to shake  off my depression. More than ever the need for conciliating the  professor was borne in upon me. Day and night I spurred my brain to  think of some suitable means of engineering a reconciliation.    In the meantime I worked hard among the fowls, drove furiously on the  links, and swam about the harbor when the affairs of the farm did not  require my attention.    Things were not going very well on our model chicken farm. Little  accidents marred the harmony of life in the fowl run. On one occasion  a hen fell into a pot of tar, and came out an unspeakable object.  Chickens kept straying into the wrong coops, and, in accordance with  fowl etiquette, were promptly pecked to death by the resident. Edwin  murdered a couple of Wyandottes, and was only saved from execution by  the tears of Mrs. Ukridge.    In spite of these occurrences, however, his buoyant optimism never  deserted Ukridge. They were incidents, annoying, but in no way  affecting the prosperity of the farm.    \"After all,\" he said, \"what's one bird more or less? Yes, I know I was  angry when that beast of a cat lunched off those two, but that was  more for the principle of the thing. I'm not going to pay large sums  for chickens so that a beastly cat can lunch well. Still, we've plenty  left, and the eggs are coming in better now, though we've a deal of  leeway to make up yet in that line. I got a letter from Whiteley's  this morning asking when my first consignment was to arrive. You know,  these people make a mistake in hurrying a man. It annoys him. It  irritates him. When we really get going, Garny, my boy, I shall drop  Whiteley's. I shall cut them out of my list, and send my eggs to their  trade rivals. They shall have a sharp lesson. It's a little hard. Here  am I, worked to death looking after things down here, and these men  have the impertinence to bother me about their wretched business!\"    [Illustration: Things were not going very well on our model chicken  farm.]    It was on the morning after this that I heard him calling me in a  voice in which I detected agitation. I was strolling about the  paddock, as was my habit after breakfast, thinking about Phyllis and  my wretched novel. I had just framed a more than usually murky scene  for use in the earlier part of the book, when Ukridge shouted to me  from the fowl run.    \"Garnet, come here,\" he cried, \"I want you to see the most astounding  thing.\"    I joined him.    \"What's the matter?\" I asked.    \"Blest if I know. Look at those chickens. They've been doing that for  the last half hour.\"    I inspected the chickens. There was certainly something the matter  with them. They were yawning broadly, as if we bored them. They stood  about singly and in groups, opening and shutting their beaks. It was  an uncanny spectacle.    \"What's the matter with them?\"    \"It looks to me,\" I said, \"as if they were tired of life. They seem  hipped.\"    \"Oh, do look at that poor little brown one by the coop,\" said Mrs.  Ukridge sympathetically, \"I'm sure it's not well. See, it's lying  down. What _can_ be the matter with it?\"    \"Can a chicken get a fit of the blues?\" I asked. \"Because, if so,  that's what they've got. I never saw a more bored-looking lot of  birds.\"    \"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Ukridge. \"We'll ask Beale. He once  lived with an aunt who kept fowls. He'll know all about it. Beale!\"    No answer.    \"_Beale_!!\"    A sturdy form in shirt sleeves appeared through the bushes, carrying  a boot. We seemed to have interrupted him in the act of cleaning it.    \"Beale, you know about fowls. What's the matter with these chickens?\"    The hired retainer examined the _blase_ birds with a wooden expression  on his face.    \"Well?\" said Ukridge.    \"The 'ole thing 'ere,\" said the hired retainer, \"is these 'ere fowls  have bin and got the roop.\"    I had never heard of the disease before, but it sounded quite  horrifying.    \"Is that what makes them yawn like that?\" said Mrs. Ukridge.    \"Yes, ma'am.\"    \"Poor things!\"    \"Yes, ma'am.\"    \"And have they all got it?\"    \"Yes, ma'am.\"    \"What ought we to do?\" asked Ukridge.    The hired retainer perpended.    \"Well, my aunt, sir, when 'er fowls 'ad the roop, she give them snuff.  Give them snuff, she did,\" he repeated with relish, \"every morning.\"    \"Snuff!\" said Mrs. Ukridge.    \"Yes, ma'am. She give them snuff till their eyes bubbled.\"    Mrs. Ukridge uttered a faint squeak at this vivid piece of word  painting.    \"And did it cure them?\" asked Ukridge.    \"No, sir,\" responded the expert soothingly. \"They died.\"    \"Oh, go away, Beale, and clean your beastly boots,\" said Ukridge.  \"You're no use. Wait a minute. Who would know about this infernal roop  thing? One of those farmer chaps would, I suppose. Beale, go off to  farmer Leigh at Up Lyme, and give him my compliments, and ask him what  he does when his fowls get the roop.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"No, I'll go, Ukridge,\" I said, \"I want some exercise.\"    I whistled to Bob, who was investigating a mole heap in the paddock,  and set off to consult farmer Leigh. He had sold us some fowls shortly  after our arrival, so might be expected to feel a kindly interest in  their ailing families.    The path to Up Lyme lies across deep-grassed meadows. At intervals it  passes over a stream by means of foot bridges. The stream curls  through the meadows like a snake.    And at the first of these bridges I met Phyllis.    I came upon her quite suddenly. The other end of the bridge was hidden  from my view. I could hear somebody coming through the grass, but not  till I was on the bridge did I see who it was. We reached the bridge  simultaneously. She was alone. She carried a sketching block. All  nice girls sketch a little.    There was room for one alone on the foot bridge, and I drew back to  let her pass.    As it is the privilege of woman to make the first sign of recognition,  I said nothing. I merely lifted my hat in a noncommitting fashion.    \"Are you going to cut me, I wonder?\" I said to myself.    She answered the unspoken question as I hoped it would be answered.    \"Mr. Garnet,\" she said, stopping at the end of the bridge.    \"Miss Derrick?\"    \"I couldn't tell you so before, but I am so sorry this has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20547"],[0,"Stories of Birds (#12)"],[1,"very wonderful did happen!    One evening the little girl with her big shiny eyes ran shouting among  the trees which grew beside the river.    She was chasing a little field-mouse, which at last ran tremblingly up  the low branch of a tree and hid in the dark.    But the queer little girl, who could see quite well in the dark, jumped  to follow the mouse.    Lo, as she jumped, the queer little girl changed into a bird with a  long, long beak and great shining eyes!    Now when she saw what had happened to her she was frightened.  In her  fright she flew back to her mother's stone hut.    But now that she was a bird she did not remember about the doors and  windows.  She flew wildly against the stone wall of the house.    So rapid was her flight that she struck the wall with great force.  Her  long bill and her face were quite flattened by the blow.    She forgot her mother's house, and in pain flew again to the trees by  the river.    The next night the mother heard the voice of her queer little girl  among the leaves calling, \"Whoo-whoo-whoo!\"    But when she looked she saw only a flat-faced, big-eyed bird who was  making a supper of the poor little field-mouse.          THE OWL AND THE RAVEN[1]    Once upon a time the owl and the raven were fast friends.    They lived beside the same stream.  They built their nests in a tree  side by side.  They sang the same songs.  They ate the same food.  They  wore dresses of the same pale gray.    There was nothing that these friends would not do for each other.  So  great was their friendship that each was always finding ways to  surprise and please the other.    At one time the raven was absent for two whole days.    \"What can he be doing?\" said the owl to herself.  \"I know he is  planning some new surprise for me.\"    When, on the third day, the raven returned, the owl knew from his  contented looks that the present must be unusually fine.    \"It is something more than a beetle or a field-mouse this time,\" she  thought.  \"Now what can I do for him?  He is always so kind to me!\"    Then the owl began to look about for something to do for her friend the  raven.    On the shore near their home tree a huge whale had once been caught and  cut up by the Eskimo hunters.  Some of the bones still lay upon the  sandy beach.    \"Oh,\" said the owl, as she chanced upon these whalebones, \"I know the  very thing which will please my dear friend the raven!    \"I will make for him a pair of beautiful whalebone boots!  With them he  can walk over the sharp rocks and the icy cliffs in comfort and safety!\"    Thereupon the owl sat down in the sand and went to work.  It was not  long until the boots were finished.  They were beautifully smooth and  slender and graceful.    \"The raven cannot help being pleased,\" she said, as she carried the  boots toward the home tree.  \"I wonder if he is in!\"    As she drew near the owl heard the raven calling her name.  Answering  loudly, she hurried to the place where he waited.  But before the raven  saw her she hid the whalebone boots among the grasses, that she might  surprise him later.    She found the raven hopping impatiently about and calling loudly.    \"Here--here I am!\" she cried.  \"I have been away for but a short  time--but you were away for days!\"    \"Oh, owl, dear,\" replied the raven, \"though I have been absent I have  thought only of you!    \"See! here is a beautiful new dress which I have made for you!\"  And  the raven spread before his friend a beautiful dress of dappled black  and white.    It was made of the softest, most beautiful feathers, lovely enough to  delight the heart of any bird.    \"Oh, how very beautiful!\" cried the owl.  \"How kind you are to me!  How  did you ever think of anything so lovely?\"    The raven smiled, well pleased with himself.    \"Try it on,\" he said.  \"I am sure it will become you.  I am certain  that when you see how lovely you look, you will never again wish to  wear anything but black and white.\"    Quickly the owl slipped from her old gray dress into the splendid new  one.  Gently she fluttered about and ruffled the soft black and white  feathers.    \"Where did you get them?\" she said, circling about and looking at her  tail for the twentieth time.    \"Sit down,\" commanded the raven, \"and I will tell you!\"  So the owl  settled down on the branch beside the raven.    \"I found the feathers on that steep, rocky cliff beside the sea,\" he  said.  \"The stones were sharp and the winds were wearying, but at last  I finished the dress just as I planned.    \"I am glad that you are pleased.  I am very tired now, and must sit  still and rest.\"    So delighted was the owl that for a moment she had forgotten the  whalebone boots.  Now as she looked at the raven she saw that in  scratching about for the feathers he had broken one of his pink toes.    With a little cry of pity she flew to the grasses where the boots were  hidden.  Quickly she snatched them up and flew back to the poor tired  raven.    \"Here,\" she cried, \"here!--I thought of you while you were away.  Now  you shall put your tired feet into these strong whale-bone boots.  The  stones and the ice cannot hurt you again.\"    \"Oh, oh!\" croaked the raven.  \"They are the very things for which I  have been longing!\"    \"Put them on!  Put them on!\" cried the owl.  \"See how they will rest  you!  They will make you feel quite young again!\"    The raven slipped his tired feet into the whalebone boots.  Straight  away the old tired ache left him.  He hopped gaily about and croaked  cheerfully.    \"How graceful!\" he said.  \"How perfectly they fit!  How comfortable.\"    \"Now I shall make a coat for you,\" said the owl.  \"It shall be pure  white.  The feathers shall be the shiniest and the loveliest that I can  find!\"    By and bye the raven's white coat was ready to be fitted.    \"Come,\" commanded the owl.  \"Come and stand still while I fit your  coat.\"    The raven came, but so delighted was he with the whalebone boots that  he could not stand still.  As the owl worked over him he kept hopping  and dancing about.    \"Stand still!\" cried the owl.  \"I can do nothing with you hopping about  so.  I shall stick the pin-feathers into you!\"    For an instant the raven stood still, looking down at the boots.  Then  he jumped so suddenly that the owl dropped a whole clawful of the soft  white feathers with which she was finishing the neck.    Then the owl grew very angry.    \"Stand still!\" she hooted.  \"If you jump another time I will throw the  oil from the lamp on you!\"'    Now the lamp was filled with whale-oil.  In it wicks of moss and  twisted grass had been burned.  With time and many wicks the oil had  become as black as soot.    The raven looked at the black, sooty oil and then at his new white  coat.  He really stood still for as much as two minutes.    Just as the owl was trying to decide whether or not the coat should be  longer, to cover the tops of the new boots, the raven caught sight of  his own reflection in the clear water below.    So pleased was he with his appearance that he flapped his wings, and  jumped up and down.    The loose white feathers flew in every direction.  The pin-feathers  dropped to the ground.  The angry owl gasped for breath.    Then in a rage she seized the lamp.  She flung it at the raven.  Alas,  for the poor fellow!  The oil struck him full on the head.  It ran down  before.  It ran down behind!  There was not a dry feather on him!    \"Quag!  Quag!\" croaked he, the oil dripping down on all sides.  \"Quag!  Quag!  I shall never speak to you again!\"    \"No,\" cried the owl.  \"Do not speak to me again.  I would not have such  a sooty friend as you!\" and she flew far away.

THE OWL      When icicles hang by the wall,      And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,    And Tom bears logs into the hall,      And milk comes frozen home in pail;    When blood is nipped and ways be foul,    Then nightly sings the staring owl,          \"Tu-who!    Tu-whit! tu-who!\" a merry note,    While greasy Jean doth clean the pot.               --\"Love's Labour's Lost,\" Shakespeare.          ALL ABOUT THE BARRED OR HOOT OWL    SUGGESTIONS FOR FIELD LESSONS    Notes--deep-toned, startling hoot.    Heard most frequently at nesting time.    Upper parts brown, marked with white--face gray, mottled with black,  wings and tail barred with brown, eyes blue black, bill yellow, under  parts buff marked with darker, legs and feet feathered, bill and claws  dark, hooked, strong.    Feeds on chicken, mice, etc.    Usually take an old crow's or woodpecker's nest for their own  use--rarely make nests for themselves.  Nest very early in the season,  young being sometimes ready to fly early in March.          THE BOBOLINK    [Illustration: The Bobolink]    A SUMMER SONG    He sat upon the tallest bending grass stalk.  He paid not the slightest  attention to Phyllis.  He just swung lightly with the June breezes, and  sang his little heart out.    Such a careless, joyous, jingling song Phyllis had never before heard.  It seemed just a bubbling-over of happiness and gladness.    And such a common-looking little fellow to have such a wonderful voice!  He was but a little larger than a sparrow.    His plumage was mostly black.  His wings and tail were edged with pale  yellow, and there were splashes of white in places on his body.  There  was a light yellow spot on the back of his neck.    \"You seem filled with gladness,\" said Phyllis.    The little bird stared at her for a moment.  Then he nodded his head,  and quivered his small wings.  He opened his mouth again and warbled  out the jolliest, sweetest tune that bird throat ever sang.    \"How very beautiful!\" cried Phyllis.  \"What a world of happiness you  send out in that song!\"    \"Ah, but I should be happy,\" warbled the sweet-voiced bobolink.  \"I  have all that bird heart can wish!\"    \"Tell me--\" said Phyllis.    \"I at last have won my wife,\" sang the"]]]
