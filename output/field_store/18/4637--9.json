[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21688"],[0,"Scottish Cathedrals and Abbeys (#12)"],[1," the most  beautiful part of the structure, but later in its architecture than the  north aisle of the choir or lady chapel, which was originally separated  from the choir by a solid wall, in which there never was any opening  into the aisle except the small doorway near the east end, which is of  First Pointed date.[162] Above the vault there is an upper storey with  small two-lighted windows, which may possibly have been used as a  scriptorium.[163] The cathedral consists of a nave of eight bays, with  north and south aisles, an aisleless choir of six bays, an eastern aisle  unconnected with the choir except by a doorway, and the tower attached  to the south aisle of nave. The following is a narrative of the building  of the cathedral as given by the most recent authorities. \"The greater  part of the structure is of First Pointed date. The lady chapel may be  the oldest part (after the tower), and next to it is the east portion of  the nave. The western half of the nave seems to have followed soon after  the eastern portion, and is carried out nearly after the same design.  The transition tracery in the arcade of the clerestory and west end is  very interesting, as showing bar tracery in the act of being formed.  This could scarcely have occurred in Scotland before the end of the  thirteenth century. The style of the choir is further advanced than the  nave, and exhibits some transitional features between First Pointed and  Decorated work. The great east window and the large side windows of the  choir probably contained tracery more advanced than that of the west  end, and may probably date from the fourteenth century. The pinnacles  and parapet are of about 1500.\"[164] The west end, with its doorway,  deeply recessed with shafts and mouldings of First Pointed work, with an  acutely pointed blind arch on each side with trefoiled head within it;  with three lofty pointed windows, each divided into two lights by a  central mullion, and with arch-heads filled with cinquefoil and  quatrefoils; with north buttress so large as to contain a wheel  stair--is the finest part of the cathedral. Above the western window is  a vesica, set within a bevilled fringe of bay-leaves arranged  zigzagwise, with their points in contact. Of this Ruskin said in his  lecture,[165] \"Do you recollect the west window of your own Dunblane  Cathedral? It is acknowledged to be beautiful by the most careless  observer. And why beautiful? Simply because in its great contours it has  the form of a forest leaf, and because in its decoration it has used  nothing but forest leaves. He was no common man who designed that  cathedral of Dunblane. I know nothing so perfect in its simplicity, and  so beautiful, so far as it reaches, in all the Gothic with which I am  acquainted. And just in proportion to his power of mind, that man was  content to work under Nature's teaching, and, instead of putting a  merely formal dog-tooth, as everybody else did at that time, he went  down to the woody bank of the sweet river beneath the rocks on which he  was building, and he took up a few of the fallen leaves that lay by it,  and he set them in his arch, side by side for ever.\"    Six of the stalls with, and several others without, canopies still  survive, and on one of the misereres are the arms of the Chisholm  family, surmounted by a mitre. Three bishops of this name presided in  Dunblane,[166] and the stalls were probably provided by the first,  Bishop James Chisholm, dating between 1486 and 1534. The stalls were  probably brought from Flanders, and the carving is spirited and full of  grotesque figures.[167] Other bishops, who ought gratefully to be  remembered for building done, are Bishop Dermoch (1400-1419) and Bishop  Ochiltree (1429-1447). Maurice, Abbot of Inchaffray and Bishop of  Dunblane (1320-1347), is described as a man of fervent spirit, who gave  great encouragement at the battle of Bannockburn, and was chosen by King  Robert the Bruce as his chaplain and confessor.[168] There are some  vestiges of the bishop's palace still left to the south-west of the  cathedral; and the Bishop's Walk, leading southward not far from the  river, and overshadowed by venerable beech trees, will always be  associated with Leighton, of whom Burnet wrote, \"He had the most  heavenly disposition that I ever yet saw in mortal ... and I never once  saw him in any other temper but that which I wished to be in, in the  last moments of my life.\"[169] Leighton was Bishop of Dunblane from 1661  to 1670, and chose it as the poorest and smallest of Scotland's sees. At  his death he bequeathed to it his library, which is still preserved.  Those who wish to understand his devotion and inner life may be directed  to Dr. Walter Smith's beautiful poem _The Bishop's Walk_.    Until recently, only the choir was used as the parish church, but in  1893 the cathedral was reopened after a complete restoration costing  L28,000. The restoration was largely due to the munificent generosity of  Mrs. Wallace of Glassingall. The town bears witness to the influence of  the cathedral--        A quaint old place--a minster grey,      And grey old town that winds away      Through gardens, down the sloping ridge      To river's brim and ancient bridge,      Where the still waters flow      To the deep pool below.[170]      8. DIOCESE OF ROSS    David I. followed the foundation of the great bishoprics by dividing the  country north of the great range of the Mounth into separate sees, and  the first of such appears to have been the diocese of Rosemarky or Ross.  Makbeth, the first Bishop of Ross, appears as the witness to a charter  between 1128 and 1130.[171] The church was founded as a Columban  monastery by Lugadius or Moluoc of Lismore before 577, and Bonifacius  refounded it in the eighth century, and dedicated the church to St.  Peter. The Culdees disappear in the course of history, and instead there  emerges a regular cathedral body of canons under a dean.[172] The Bishop  of Ross had this peculiarity, that he took his title from the province,  and not from the town, where he held his see. When the see was founded  by David I., Rosmarkie continued as the cathedral centre, but after the  chapter was enlarged by Gregory IX. in 1235, the cathedral site was  changed to Fortrose or Chanonry, and the church was dedicated to SS.  Peter and Bonifacius. Chanonry is half a mile south-westward from  Rosemarkie, and was united with it in 1455 by James II. as a free burgh  under the common name of Fortrose. The presence of an educated clergy  made the place a centre of culture, and famous schools of divinity and  law flourished under the shadow of the cathedral.    The undercroft of the sacristy (afterwards enlarged) seems to indicate  that the work must have been begun before 1250,[173] but the  architecture of the aisle presents a beautiful specimen of the Middle  Pointed or Decorated period, and dates before or about the beginning of  the fifteenth century.[174] The cathedral, when entire, was a handsome  red sandstone building, comprising a nave of four bays, with aisles 14  feet wide and round-headed windows; a choir, with aisles, lady chapel,  west tower, quasi-transept, rood-turret, and to the north-east a vaulted  chapter-house over a crypt. It stood on level ground, and commanded a  fine view of the Moray Firth. When complete it must have been an  architectural gem, and its mouldings have been said to show that in  whatever other respects these remote parts of Scotland were barbarous,  in ecclesiology at least they were on a par with any other branch of the  mediaeval Church.[175] All that now remains of the cathedral consists of  the south aisle of the nave, and the sacristy or undercroft of the  chapter-house. No vestige remains of the various manses of the chapter  that were within the cathedral precincts. The cathedral suffered at the  Reformation, but was repaired by Bishop Lindsay in 1615, and in 1649 was  not very ruinous. It would appear that the tradition is correct which  says that the masonry of the walls was removed by Cromwell, like that of  Kinloss Abbey, to provide material for the construction of his fort at  Inverness.    In the south wall there is a beautiful piscina, and in the north wall an  ambry with a small stone penthouse; an octagonal baptismal font of  remarkable design stands against the east wall of the aisle. There is a  range of canopied monuments, which stand between the pillars on the  north side. The east end had a large traceried window of five lights,  and when complete it must have been very beautiful.    The most famous of the bishops was John Leslie (1527-1596), who studied  at King's College, Aberdeen, at Paris, and at Poitiers. He held offices  both in the Aberdeen University and in the State, and in 1566 Queen Mary  bestowed on him the Abbey of Lindores _in commendam_, and subsequently  appointed him Bishop of Ross. He was a zealous supporter of Queen Mary,  and, after her flight to England, followed her, and never afterwards  returned to reside in Scotland. He was imprisoned in the Tower,[176]  where he wrote two small books for her spiritual profit, which Queen  Mary liked and endeavoured to turn into French verse. After his release  he retired to France, where he wrote his _History of Scotland_. On the  day before her execution, Queen Mary wrote to Philip of Spain,  beseeching him to show kindness to the Bishop of Ross for his faithful  and devoted services to her. The request was complied with, and he was  able to end his days tranquilly in a monastery near Brussels. It is said  that the bishop persuaded the Queen in 1565 to grant to all men a  liberty of conscience.[177]      9. DIOCESE OF CAITHNESS    The early history of the Church in Caithness points to a time before the  Northmen had any footing there, and connects it with the missionaries of  Ireland and Scotland.

The cadi was a stern old Turk, with a long grey beard.  The son-in-law  elect was, as we have elsewhere said, an ill-favoured elderly man with  only one eye.  He did not look quite so happy as one would have expected  in a bridegroom so near his wedding-day, but that was to be accounted  for, to some extent, by the fact that he already possessed four wives,  and was naturally somewhat used to weddings.    \"No, no,\" said he, in a cautious tone, to the judge; \"it won't do to be  hasty about it, Achmet is too popular at present.\"    \"What has that to do with the question?\" asked the cadi, in a tone of  contempt.  \"If our party be strong enough we have only to strike; and I  tell you that I believe it to be quite strong enough.\"    \"I know it,\" returned Omar impatiently, \"but I also know that my enemy,  Sidi Hassan, is more than usually on the alert just now; I think it well  to delay for a time.  Besides,\" he added, smiling, \"you surely would not  have me begin a revolution on the very eve of my marriage!\"    \"I would have you lose as little time as possible,\" replied the cadi.  \"But see, if I mistake not, these two men are eyeing us rather  narrowly.\"    Seeing that they were observed, Rais Ali advanced, and, with a low  salaam, delivered his message to Sidi Omar, who gave him the necessary  reply, and dismissed him.    Resuming their conference, the two magnates turned to saunter along the  street, when Omar observed a dark object like a dog, coiled up in an  angle of the parapet.  Poking it with his cane, he caused it to uncoil  and display the vacant, features of a half-witted negro boy.  The poor  creature fell on his knees in alarm on seeing the well-known face of  Sidi Omar, but sprang to his feet with alacrity, and ran off at full  speed on being sternly told to \"be gone.\"    Meanwhile Rais Ali led his friend safely through the Bab-el-Oued gate,  and, turning his face in the right direction said--    \"Now, you git 'ome, fast.  Keep 'er steady--a point morer to the  westward--so, yoo can't go wrong.\"    Instead of obeying orders, Ted Flaggan turned, and, with an amused  smile, watched the retreating figure of the interpreter.  Then, after  sauntering on some distance in a reverie, he stopped and gazed long and  earnestly at the pirate city, whose white-washed domes and minarets  gleamed in the sunshine like marble, contrasting beautifully with the  bright green of the Sahel hills behind, and the intense blue of the sky  and sea.    \"A whited sepulchre!\" muttered the seaman, with a frown, as he turned  away and pushed forward at a rapid pace towards the residence of the  British consul.        CHAPTER NINE.    DESCRIBES A MOORISH BRIDE, A WEDDING, AND A METAMORPHOSIS, BESIDES  INDICATING A PLOT.    On the following morning Mrs Langley set out on horseback for the  palace of the cadi, to attend the wedding of his daughter with Sidi  Omar, and, true to her promise, turned aside on the way to pay a visit  to the imprisoned bride of Rais Ali.    She was accompanied, of course, by the remarkable bridegroom himself,  and also by her husband's janissary, Sidi Hassan, as well as by her  daughter Agnes, who rode a spirited Arab pony.    Immediately on entering the gate of the city, Rais and the ladies  dismounted, and leaving their horses in charge of a groom, ascended on  foot one of the narrow streets of the town.  So steep was this street  that it consisted of a flight of broad steps, which led ultimately to  the casba, or citadel, at the upper part of the town.  But before they  had ascended it very far, the interpreter diverged into a cross street,  which was much narrower.  It terminated in a _cul-de-sac_, at the bottom  of which stood the door of Rais Ali's town residence.    And a remarkable door it was, made of thick oaken planks, studded with  enormous nails, the heads of which were as large as a half-crown.  Just  above it there was a square hole grated with thick iron bars, which  served to enlighten the gloomy passage within.    Applying the key before mentioned to this door, Rais threw it open and  bade the visitors enter.    Having carefully shut and re-locked the door, the interpreter led them  through a narrow passage, which terminated in the usual square court of  Moorish houses.  This was very small, and, like all such courts, had no  roof, so that a pleasant gleam of sunshine flickered through the  creepers which twined up its pillars and gleamed on the drops that fell  from a tinkling fountain in the centre.    Entering an open doorway on the right of the court, the interpreter led  the way up a flight of marble steps to the second storey of the house.  A small gallery, such as one sees in public libraries in England, ran  round the four sides of the building over the balustrade, of which one  could look down on the leafy court with its ever singing _jet d'eau_.  The windows of the several private, apartments opened upon this gallery.    In the centre of one side of the square was a large open doorway, in the  form of a Moorish arch, by which entrance was obtained into a little  extremely ornate apartment.  The dome-shaped roof of this boudoir was  lighted by four little holes filled with stained-glass, and the walls  were covered with beautifully painted tiles.  Rich ornaments of various  Eastern and fanciful kinds were strewn about, and valuable Persian rugs  covered the marble floor.    On an ottoman, in the centre of all, sat Rais Ali's bride, cross-legged,  and on a cushion before her lay the cat, her only companion.    She was clothed in garments of the richest description, which glittered  with gold embroidery and jewels.  Seated thus, stroking the cat, and  with a self-satisfied smile on her fat pretty face, she seemed the very  personification of contentment.  Her soft brown neck was almost hidden  with rows of pearls, and long rows of the same jewels depended from the  high filigree cap which towered above her head.  Her dress consisted of  three open jackets or short caftans, one above the other, without  sleeves.  These were profusely garnished with gold lace, and fastened  only at the waist.  White linen trousers or drawers covered her limbs to  the ankles, but these were so immensely wide as to bear more resemblance  to female drapery than to the masculine appendages which their name  suggests.  A silken, gold-striped shawl was fastened by two corners  round her waist, and hung down in front like an apron.  Sleeves of fine  embroidered muslin and of great width covered her arms.  Her little feet  and ankles were bare, but the latter were ornamented with several thick  gold leglets.  In each ear she wore five large round ear-rings, two of  these fitting into two holes in the lower, and three into the upper part  of the ear.  One awkward result of this was that the upper ear-rings  pulled the ears down, and made them pendent like those of a poodle!    The visitors having been introduced, Madam Rais Ali received them with a  good-humoured stare, but said nothing.  Mrs Langley then tried to  engage her in conversation, but Mrs Ali continued to stare and smile  without speaking, for the good reason that she understood neither French  nor English.  Requesting Ali to interpret, Mrs Langley then put one or  two questions.  The bride turned her large dark eyes on her husband  while he was speaking, and then, instead of replying, turned them on her  visitors and laughed.  Whereupon little Agnes, unable to control  herself, also laughed; this unhinged Mrs Langley, who laughed likewise,  and Rais Ali followed suit from sympathy.    After this satisfactory ebullition, Mrs Langley again essayed to induce  conversation, but beyond yes, no, and a laugh, she could draw forth  nothing whatever from the bride, whose mind, in regard to all things  terrestrial, with the exception of household affairs, was a perfect  blank.  Mohammedan females are treated by their lords like babies.  They  receive no education worthy of the name, and are therefore apt to be  childish in their ideas.    After one or two fruitless attempts, the visitors took leave of the  happy bride, who was thereupon locked up again by her jealous husband,  and left to her own resources and the cat.    Returning to the place where their steeds had been left, the party  re-mounted, and proceeded to the palace of the cadi.    This palace, being situated in one of the narrow lanes of the town, had  a very undignified and dull exterior.  Indeed, no one could have  imagined it to be a palace, but for the spiral columns of marble and  other rich and costly carving around the entrance.  Inside, however, the  aspect of things was more in keeping with the dignity of the owner.    The lady and her daughter were ushered into a little square hall, in  which several guards were seated, cross-legged, on small stone seats or  niches round the walls, smoking long pipes.  Beyond this was the  principal entrance-hall or antechamber of the palace.  It was gorgeous  in marble pillars, stucco designs, horse-shoe arches, and other  Mooresque decorations.  Here a large party of officials and friends were  moving about.  Beyond this, they came to the square court, which is the  same in general arrangements, in all Moorish houses, though, of course,  not in size or luxury of detail.    Here the cadi himself met his guests, and conducted them to the suite of  chambers on the second storey, which were devoted to the ladies.  At the  principal entrance to these they were received by the cadi's wife, and,  with much display of friendliness and affection, were conducted into the  harem--that mysterious retreat which, in a Mohammedan household, is  never entered by mortal man, except the lord thereof.    It was Mrs Langley's first visit to such a scene, and, although she had  been prepared for something magnificent, the gorgeous nature of  everything far surpassed "]]]
