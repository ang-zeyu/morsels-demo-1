Boy, now your  fate is sealed!\"    Looking at the wicked seal-faces all around them, George and Jane felt  that their fate was sealed indeed.    The dwarfs seized the children in their furry arms. George kicked, but  it is no use kicking sealskin, and Jane howled, but the dwarfs were  getting used to that. They climbed up the dragon's side and dumped the  children down on his icy spine, with their backs against the North Pole.  You have no idea how cold it was--the kind of cold that makes you feel  small and prickly inside your clothes, and makes you wish you had twenty  times as many clothes to feel small and prickly inside of.    The sealskin dwarfs tied George and Jane to the North Pole, and, as they  had no ropes, they bound them with snow-wreaths, which are very strong  when they are made in the proper way, and they heaped up the fires very  close and said: \"Now the dragon will get warm, and when he gets warm he  will wake, and when he wakes he will be hungry, and when he is hungry he  will begin to eat, and the first thing he will eat will be you.\"    The little, sharp, many-colored flames sprang up like the stalks of  dream lilies, but no heat came to the children, and they grew colder and  colder.    \"We shan't be very nice when the dragon does eat us, that's one  comfort,\" said George. \"We shall be turned into ice long before that.\"    Suddenly there was a flapping of wings, and the white grouse perched on  the dragon's head and said: \"Can I be of any assistance?\"    [Illustration: \"The dwarfs seized the children.\" _See page 72._]    Now, by this time the children were so cold, so cold, so very, very  cold, that they had forgotten everything but that, and they could say  nothing else. So the white grouse said: \"One moment. I am only too  grateful for this opportunity of showing my sense of your manly conduct  about the firework!\"    And the next moment there was a soft whispering rustle of wings  overhead, and then, fluttering slowly, softly down, came hundreds and  thousands of little white fluffy feathers. They fell on George and Jane  like snowflakes, and, like flakes of fallen snow lying one above  another, they grew into a thicker and thicker covering, so that  presently the children were buried under a heap of white feathers, and  only their faces peeped out.    \"Oh, you dear, good, kind white grouse,\" said Jane, \"but you'll be cold  yourself, won't you, now you have given us all your pretty dear  feathers?\"    The white grouse laughed, and his laugh was echoed by thousands of kind,  soft bird voices.    \"Did you think all those feathers came out of one breast? There are  hundreds and hundreds of us here, and every one of us can spare a little  tuft of soft breast feathers to help to keep two kind little hearts  warm!\"    Thus spoke the grouse, who certainly had very pretty manners.    So now the children snuggled under the feathers and were warm, and when  the sealskin dwarfs tried to take the feathers away, the grouse and his  friends flew in their faces with flappings and screams, and drove the  dwarfs back. They are a cowardly folk.    The dragon had not moved yet--but then he might at any moment get warm  enough to move, and though George and Jane were now warm they were not  comfortable nor easy in their minds. They tried to explain to the  grouse; but though he is polite, he is not clever, and he only said:  \"You've got a warm nest, and we'll see that no one takes it from you.  What more can you possibly want?\"    Just then came a new, strange, jerky fluttering of wings far softer  than the grouse's, and George and Jane cried out together: \"Oh, _do_  mind your wings in the fires!\"    For they saw at once that it was the great white Arctic moth.    \"What's the matter?\" he asked, settling on the dragon's tail.    So they told him.    \"Sealskin, are they?\" said the moth. \"Just you wait a minute!\"    He flew off very crookedly, dodging the flames, and presently he came  back, and there were so many moths with him that it was as if a live  sheet of white wingedness were suddenly drawn between the children and  the stars.    And then the doom of the bad sealskin dwarfs fell suddenly on them.    For the great sheet of winged whiteness broke up and fell as snow falls,  and it fell upon the sealskin dwarfs; and every snowflake of it was a  live, fluttering, hungry moth that buried its greedy nose deep in the  sealskin fur.    Grown-up people will tell you that it is not moths but moths' children  who eat fur--but this is only when they are trying to deceive you. When  they are not thinking about you they say, \"I fear the moths have got at  my ermine tippet,\" or, \"Your poor Aunt Emma had a lovely sable cloak,  but it was eaten by moths.\" And now there were more moths than have ever  been together in this world before, all settling on the sealskin dwarfs.    The dwarfs did not see their danger till it was too late. Then they  called for camphor and bitter apple and oil of lavender and yellow soap  and borax; and some of the dwarfs even started to get these things, but  long before any of them could get to the chemist's, all was over. The  moths ate and ate and ate till the sealskin dwarfs, being sealskin  throughout, even to the empty hearts of them, were eaten down to the  very life--and they fell one by one on the snow and so came to their  end. And all around the North Pole the snow was brown with their flat  bare pelts.    \"Oh, thank you--thank you, darling Arctic moth,\" cried Jane. \"You are  good--I do hope you haven't eaten enough to disagree with you  afterward!\"    Millions of moth voices answered, with laughter as soft as moth wings,  \"We should be a poor set of fellows if we couldn't over eat ourselves  once in a while--to oblige a friend.\"    And off they all fluttered, and the white grouse flew off, and the  sealskin dwarfs were all dead, and the fires went out, and George and  Jane were left alone in the dark with the dragon!    \"Oh, dear,\" said Jane, \"this is the worst of all!\"    \"We've no friends left to help us,\" said George. He never thought that  the dragon himself might help them--but then that was an idea that would  never have occurred to any boy.    It grew colder and colder and colder, and even under the grouse feathers  the children shivered.    Then, when it was so cold that it could not manage to be any colder  without breaking the thermometer, it stopped. And then the dragon  uncurled himself from around the North Pole, and stretched his long, icy  length over the snow, and said: \"This is something like! How faint those  fires did make me feel!\"    The fact was, the sealskin dwarfs had gone the wrong way to work: The  dragon had been frozen so long that now he was nothing but solid ice all  through, and the fires only made him feel as if he were going to die.    But when the fires were out he felt quite well, and very hungry. He  looked around for something to eat. But he never noticed George and  Jane, because they were frozen to his back.    He moved slowly off, and the snow-wreaths that bound the children to the  Pole gave way with a snap, and there was the dragon, crawling  south--with Jane and George on his great, scaly, icy shining back. Of  course the dragon had to go south if he went anywhere, because when you  get to the North Pole there is no other way to go. The dragon rattled  and tinkled as he went, exactly like the cut-glass chandelier when you  touch it, as you are strictly forbidden to do. Of course there are a  million ways of going south from the North Pole--so you will own that it  was lucky for George and Jane when the dragon took the right way and  suddenly got his heavy feet on the great slide. Off he went, full speed,  between the starry lamps, toward Forest Hill and the Crystal Palace.    \"He's going to take us home,\" said Jane. \"Oh, he is a good dragon. I  _am_ glad!\"    George was rather glad too, though neither of the children felt at all  sure of their welcome, especially as their feet were wet, and they were  bringing a strange dragon home with them.    They went very fast, because dragons can go uphill as easily as down.  You would not understand why if I told you--because you are only in long  division at present; yet if you want me to tell you, so that you can  show off to other children, I will. It is because dragons can get their  tails into the fourth dimension and hold on there, and when you can do  that everything else is easy.    The dragon went very fast, only stopping to eat the collector and the  sportsman, who were still struggling to go up the slide--vainly, because  they had no tails, and had never even heard of the fourth dimension.    When the dragon got to the end of the slide he crawled very slowly  across the dark field beyond the field where there was a bonfire, next  to the next-door garden at Forest Hill.           *       *       *       *       *    He went slower and slower, and in the bonfire field he stopped  altogether, and because the Arctic regions had not got down so far as  that, and because the bonfire was very hot, the dragon began to melt and  melt and melt--and before the children knew what he was doing they found  themselves sitting in a large pool of water, and their boots were as wet  as wet, and there was not a bit of dragon left!    So they went indoors.    Of course some grown-up or other noticed at once that the boots of  George and Jane were wet and muddy, and that they had both been sitting  down in a very damp place, so they were sent to bed immediately.    It was long past their time, anyhow.    Now, if you are of an inquiring mind--not at all a nice thing in a  little child who reads fairy tales--you will want to know how it is that  since the sealskin dwarfs have all been killed, and the fires all been  let out, the Aurora Borealis shines, on cold nights, as brightly as  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23667"],[0,"Woodland Tales (#12)"],[1,"like is. You can find  it, and try it. It is one of the things that Monapini taught Ruth  Pilgrim to eat. (Tale 18).    Of course, the Brownies do not like you to dig up their treasure or  good-to-eats, but there are plenty more, far more than they ever need.  \"Yet what about it,\" you say, \"if the Brownie happens to be there?\"    He may be sitting right under the umbrella, but remember the little  people are invisible to our eyes. You will not see him; at least I never  did.      TALE 37    The Hickory Horn-devil    Hush, whisper! Did you ever meet a Hickory Horn-devil? No! Well I did,  and I tell you he is a terror. Look at this picture of him. It is true,  only he is not quite so big as that, though he looks as if he might be.  And I was not quite so small as that, only I felt as if I were! And  everything about him looked horribly strong, poisonous and ugly. He was  a real devil.    [Illustration: The Hickory Horn-devil (1/2 life size)]    I did not know his history then; I did not learn it for a long time  after, but I can tell it to you now.    Once upon a time there was a little, greenish, blackish worm. He loved  pretty things, and he hated to be ugly, as he was. No one wanted him,  and he was left all alone, a miserable little outcast. He complained  bitterly to Mother Carey, and asked if she would not bless him with some  grace, to help him in his troubles.    Mother Carey said: \"Little ugly worm; you are having a hard time,  because in your other life, before you came into this shape, you had an  ugly, hateful spirit. You must go through this one as you are, until the  Great Sleep comes; after that, you will be exactly what you have made of  yourself.\"    Then the little ugly worm said: \"Oh Mother Carey, I am as miserable as I  can be; let me be twice as ugly, if, in the end, I may be twice as  beautiful.\"    Mother Carey said gravely, \"Do you think you could stand it, little  worm? We shall see.\"    From that time the worm got bigger and uglier, no creature would even  talk to him. The birds seemed to fear him, and the Squirrels puffed out  little horror-snorts, when they saw him coming, even the other worms  kept away from him.    So he went on his lonely life, uglier and more hated than ever. He lived  chiefly on a big hickory tree, so men called him the Hickory Horn-devil.    One day as he was crawling on a fence, a hen with chickens came running  after him, to eat him. But when she saw how ugly he was she cried: \"Oh,  Lawk, lawk! Come away, children, at once!\"    At another time he saw a Chipmunk teaching its little ones to play tag.  They looked so bright and happy, he longed, not to join them because he  could only crawl, but to have the happiness of looking on. But when he  came slowly forward, and the old Chipmunk saw him waving his horns and  looking like a green poisonous reptile, she screamed, \"Run, my  children!\" and all darted into their hole while Mother Chipmunk stuffed  up the doorway with earth.    But the most thrilling thing of all that he saw was one day as the sun  went down, a winged being of dazzling beauty alighted for a moment on  his hickory tree. Never had the Horn-devil seen such a dream of  loveliness. Her slender body was clad in rose velvet, and her wings were  shining with gold. The very sight of her made him hate himself, yet he  could not resist the impulse to crawl nearer, to gaze at her beauty.    But her eyes rested a moment on his horrible shape, and she fled in  fear, while a voice near by said: \"The Spangled Queen does not love  poisonous reptiles.\" Then the poor little Horn-devil wished he were  dead. He hid away from sight for three days. Hunger however forced him  out, and as he was crawling across a pathway, a man who came along was  going to crush him underfoot, but Mother Carey whispered, \"No, don't do  it.\" So the man let him live, but roughly kicked the worm aside, and  bruised him fearfully.    Then came Mother Carey and said: \"Well, little ugly worm! Is your spirit  strong, or angry?\"    The worm said bravely, though feebly: \"Mother, Mother Carey, I am trying  to be strong. I want to win.\"    The breezes were losing their gentle warmth when Mother Carey came to  him one day, and said: \"Little one, your trial has been long, but it is  nearly over.    \"Prepare to sleep now, my little horny one, you have fought a brave  fight; your reward is coming. Because your soul has been made beautiful  by your suffering, I will give you a body blazing with such beauty as  shall make all stand in adoration when you pass.\" Then Mother Earth  said, \"Our little one shall have extra care because he has had extra  trials.\" So the tired little Horn-devil did not even have to make  himself a hammock, for Mother Earth received him and he snuggled into  her bosom. As Mother Carey waved her wand, he dropped off asleep. And he  slept for two hundred days.    Then came the great Awakening Day, the resurrection day of the woods.  Many new birds arrived. Many new flowers appeared. Sleepers woke from  underground, as Mother Carey's silent trumpeters went bugling ahead of  her, and her winged horse, the Warm Wind, came sweeping across the  meadows, with the white world greening as he came.    The bundle-baby of the Horn-devil woke up. He was cramped and sleepy,  but soon awake. Then he knew that he was a prisoner, bound up in silken  cords of strength. But new powers were his now, he was able to break the  cords and crawl out of his hole. He put up his feelers to find those  horrible horns, but they were gone, and his devil form fell off him like  a mask. He had wings, jewelled wings! on his back now. Out he came to  fluff the newfound wings awhile, and when they were spread and supple he  flew into the joyful night, one of the noblest of all the things that  fly, gorgeous in gold and velvet, body and wings; filled with the joy of  life and flight, he went careering through the soft splendour of the  coming night. And as he flew, he glimpsed a radiant form ahead, a being  like himself, with wings of velvet and gold. At first he thought it was  the Princess of the Hickory Tree, but now his eyes were perfect, and he  could see that this was a younger and more beautiful Spangled Princess  than the one of his bygone life, and all his heart was filled with the  blazing fire of love. Fearlessly now he flew to overtake her; for was  she not of his own kind? She sped away, very fast at first, but maybe  she did not go as fast as she could, for soon he was sailing by her  side. At first she turned away a little, but she was not cross or  frightened now. She was indeed inclined to play and tease. Then in their  own language, he asked her to marry him, and in their own language she  said, \"yes.\" Away they flew and flew on their wedding flight, high in  the trees in the purple night, glorious in velvet and gold, more happy  than these printed words can tell.    The wise men who saw them said, \"There go the Royal Citheronia and his  bride.\" And Mother Carey smiled as she saw their bliss, and remembered  the Hickory Horn-devil.

THINGS TO SEE IN AUTUMNTIME    [Illustration: The Purple and Gold of Autumn]          Things to See in Autumntime      TALE 38    The Purple and Gold of Autumn    There was once an old gentleman named Father Time, and he had four  beautiful daughters.    The eldest was called Winter Time. She was tall and pale. She dressed  chiefly in white wool trimmed with wonderful lacework. She was much  admired by some, but others considered her very cold and distant. And  most agreed that she was the least winsome of the sisters.    The second one was called Spring Time, and she was dressed in beautiful  golden-green satin. She had a gentle, sunny disposition; some thought  her the loveliest.    The third was Summer Time, and her robe was dark-green velvet. She was  warm-hearted and most attractive, full of life and energy, and as unlike  the eldest sister as possible.    The youngest was Autumn Time. She certainly was a wonderful creature,  with red rosy cheeks, plump form, and riotous good spirits. Her robes  were gorgeous and a little extravagant, for she wore a new one every  day, and of all that she had, the one that she loved the best and wore  the latest was of purple and gold. We can go out in October and see the  purple and gold, and gather some scraps of the robe, for it is on every  wayside and every hillside.      TALE 39    Why the Chicadee Goes Crazy Twice a Year    A long time ago, when it was always summer in our woods, the Chicadees  lived merrily with their cousins, and frolicked the whole year round.  But one day Mother Carey sent the small birds a warning that they must  move to the South, when the leaves fell from the trees, for hard frost  and snow were coming, and maybe starvation too.    All the cousins of the Chicadees listened to the warning and got ready  to go; but Tomtit, their leader, only laughed and turned a dozen wheels  around a twig that served him for a bar.    \"Go to the South?\" said he. \"Not I; I am too happy here; and as for  frost and snow, I never saw any, and I don't believe there are such  things.\"    Very soon the leaves fell from the trees and the Nut-hatches and the  King-wrens were so busy getting ready to go that the Chicadees left off  play for a minute, to ask questions. They were not pleased with the  answer they got, for the messenger had said that all of them were to  take a long, long journey that would last for days, and the little  King-wrens had actually to go as far as the Gulf of Mexico. Besides,  they were to fly by night, to avoid their enemies, the Hawks, and the  weather at this season was sure to be stormy. So the Chicadees said it  was all nonsense, and went off, singing and chasing one another through  the woods, led by Tomtit singing a new song in which he made fun of the  travellers.
