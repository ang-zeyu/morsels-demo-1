These used to be  given away in Tainton Church to such of the poor children of Burford  as attended. A sermon is preached on St. Thomas's Day, according to  directions supposed to be contained in the will of Edmund Harman, 6s.  8d. being also paid out of Lord Dynevor's estate to the preacher. The  children used to make so much riot and disturbance in the church, that  about 1809 it was thought better to distribute the cobbs in a stable  belonging to one of the churchwardens, and this course has been  pursued ever since.    [Footnote 21: _Ibid._, p. 25.]    At Slindon, Sussex,[22] a sum of L15 was placed in the Arundel Savings  Bank, in the year 1824, the interest of which is distributed on St.  Thomas's Day. It is said that this money was found many years since on  the person of a beggar, who died by the roadside, and the interest of  it has always been appropriated by the parish officers for the use of  the poor.    [Footnote 22: _Ibid._, p. 129.]    Where these gifts were not distributed, as a rule, the poor country  folk went round begging for something wherewith to keep the festival  of Christ-tide; and for this they can scarcely be blamed, for  agricultural wages were very low, and mostly paid in kind, so that the  labourer could never lay by for a rainy day, much less have spare cash  to spend in festivity. Feudality was not wholly extinct, and they  naturally leaned upon their richer neighbours for help--especially at  this season of rejoicing throughout all England--a time of feasting  ever since the Saxon rule. So, following the rule of using St.  Thomas's Day as the day for providing the necessaries for the  Christmas feast, they went about from farm-house to mansion soliciting  gifts of food. In some parts, as in Derbyshire, this was called \"going  a-Thomassing,\" and the old and young folks would come home laden with  gifts of milk, cheese, wheat, with which to make furmity or furmenty,  oatmeal, flour, potatoes, mince pies, pigs' puddings, or pork pies,  and other goodies. This collection went by the same name in Cheshire  and neighbouring counties, where the poor generally carried a bag and  a can into which they might put the flour, meal, or corn that might be  given them.    In other places, such as Northamptonshire, Kent, Sussex,  Herefordshire, Worcestershire, it went under the name of \"Going a  Gooding,\" and in some cases the benefactions were acknowledged by a  return present of a sprig of holly or mistletoe or a bunch of  primroses. In some parts of Herefordshire they \"called a spade a  spade,\" and called this day \"Mumping,\" or begging day; and in  Warwickshire, where they principally received presents of corn, it was  termed \"going-a-corning\"; and in that home of orchards Worcestershire,  this rhyme used to be sung--         Wissal, wassail through the town,       If you've got any apples throw them down;       Up with the stocking, and down with the shoe,       If you've got no apples money will do.       The jug is white, and the ale is brown,       This is the best house in the town.    \"Cuthbert Bede\" (the Rev. Edward Bradley) writes[23]--\"In the  Staffordshire parish whence I write, S. Thomas's Day is observed  thus:--Not only do the old women and widows, but representatives also  from each poorer family in the parish, come round for alms. The  clergyman is expected to give one shilling to each person, and, as no  'reduction is made on taking a quantity' of recipients, he finds the  celebration of the day attended with no small expense. Some of the  parishioners give alms in money, others in kind. Thus, some of the  farmers give corn, which the miller grinds _gratis_. The day's custom  is termed 'Gooding.' In neighbouring parishes no corn is given, the  farmers giving money instead; and in some places the money collected  is placed in the hands of the clergyman and churchwardens, who, on the  Sunday nearest to S. Thomas's Day, distribute it at the vestry. The  fund is called S. Thomas's Dole, and the day itself is termed Doleing  Day.\"    [Footnote 23: _Notes and Queries_, 2 series, iv. 487.]    There is very little folk-lore about this day. Halliwell says that  girls used to have a method of divination with a \"S. Thomas's Onion,\"  for the purpose of finding their future husbands. The onion was  peeled, wrapped in a clean handkerchief, and then being placed under  their heads, the following lines were said:         Good S. Thomas, do me right,       And see my true love come to-night,       That I may see him in the face,       And him in my kind arms embrace.    A writer in _Notes and Queries_[24] says, \"A Nottinghamshire  maid-servant tells me:--'One of my mistresses was brought up at  Ranskill, or not far from there. She used to say that when she and her  sister were children they always hid under the nurse's cloak if they  went out to a party on S. Thomas's Day. They were told that S. Thomas  came down at that time and sat on the steeple of the church.'\"    [Footnote 24: 7 series, x. p. 487.]          CHAPTER VII         Paddington Charity (Bread and Cheese Lands)--Barring-out at       Schools--Interesting narrative.      Until Christmas eve there is nothing remarkable about this Novena of  Christ-tide, excepting a curious charitable custom which used to  obtain in the parish of Paddington, which may be well described by a  quotation from the _London Magazine_ (December 1737, p. 705).    \"Sunday, December 18, 1737. This day, according to annual custom,  bread and cheese were thrown from Paddington steeple to the populace,  agreeable to the will of two women, who were relieved there with bread  and cheese when they were almost starved; and Providence afterwards  favouring them, they left an estate in that parish to continue the  custom for ever on that day.\"    Three pieces of land situated in the parish were certainly left by two  maiden ladies, whose names are unknown, and their charity was  distributed as described until the Sunday before Christmas 1834, when  the bread and cheese (consisting of three or four dozen penny rolls,  and the same quantity of pieces of cheese) were thrown for the last  time from the belfry of St. Mary's Church by Mr. Wm. Hogg, the parish  clerk. After that date the rents arising from these \"bread and cheese  lands,\" as they are called, were distributed in the shape of bread,  coals, and blankets, to poor families inhabiting the parish, of whom a  list was made out annually for the churchwardens, stating their  residence and occupation, and the number of children under ten years  of age. Subsequently the Court of Chancery assented to a scheme  whereby the rents are portioned amongst the national schools, etc.    A curious custom used to obtain in some schools just before the  Christmas holidays, of _barring-out_ the master, and keeping him out  of the schoolroom until the boys' grievances had been listened to and  promise of redress given; and the best account of this custom that I  have ever met with is in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for 1828, vol. ii.  p. 404, etc.    \"It was a few days before the usual period of the Christmas Holidays  arrived, when the leading scholars of the head form determined on  reviving the ancient but obsolete custom of _barring-out_ the master  of the school. Many years had elapsed since the attempt had succeeded;  and many times since that period had it been made in vain. The  scholars had heard of the glorious feats of their forefathers in their  boyish years, when they set the lash of the master at defiance for  days together. Now, alas! all was changed; the master, in the opinion  of the boys, reigned a despot absolute and uncontrolled; the merciless  cruelty of his rod, and the heaviness of his tasks, were  insupportable. The accustomed holidays had been rescinded; the usual  Christmas feast reduced to a non-entity, and the chartered rights of  the scholars were continually violated. These grievances were  discussed _seriatim_; and we were all unanimously of opinion that our  wrongs should, if possible, be redressed. But how the object should be  effected was a momentous and weighty affair. The master was a  clergyman of the old school, who for the last forty years had  exercised an authority hitherto uncontrolled, and who had no idea of  enforcing scholastic discipline without the exercise of the whip. The  consequences of a failure were terrible to think upon; but then the  anticipation of success, and the glory attendant upon the enterprise,  if successful, were sufficient to dispel every fear.    \"At the head of the Greek class was one whose very soul seemed formed  for the most daring attempts. He communicated his intentions to a  chosen few, of which the writer was one, and offered to be the leader  of the undertaking if we would promise him our support. We hesitated;  but he represented the certainty of success with such feeling  eloquence that he entirely subdued our opposition. He stated that  Addison had acquired immortal fame by a similar enterprise. He told us  that almost every effort in the sacred cause of freedom had succeeded.  He appealed to our classical recollections:--Epaminondas and Leonidas  were worthy of our example; Tarquin and Caesar, as tyrants, had fallen  before the united efforts of freedom; we had only to be unanimous, and  the rod of this scholastic despot would be for ever broken. We then  entered enthusiastically into his views. He observed that delays were  dangerous; 'the barring-out,' he said, 'should take place the very  next morning to prevent the possibility of being betrayed.' On a  previous occasion (he said), some officious little urchin had told the  master the whole plot, several days having been allowed to intervene  between the planning of the project and its execution, and, to the  astonishment of the boys, it appeared they found the master at his  desk two hours before his usual time, and had the mortification of  being"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19980"],[0,"A Joy For Ever (and Its Price in the Market) (#12)"],[1,"and bare as if blasted by  the locust; but the white hail never fell from those clouds of heaven as  the black hail will fall from the clouds of hell, if ever one breath of  Italian life stirs again in the streets of Verona.      78. Sad as you will feel this to be, I do not say that you can directly  prevent it; you cannot drive the Austrians out of Italy, nor prevent  them from building forts where they choose. But I do say,[11] that you,  and I, and all of us, ought to be both acting and feeling with a full  knowledge and understanding of these things; and that, without trying to  excite revolutions or weaken governments, we may give our own thoughts  and help, so as in a measure to prevent needless destruction. We should  do this, if we only realized the thing thoroughly. You drive out day by  day through your own pretty suburbs, and you think only of making, with  what money you have to spare, your gateways handsomer, and your  carriage-drives wider--and your drawing-rooms more splendid, having a  vague notion that you are all the while patronizing and advancing art;  and you make no effort to conceive the fact that, within a few hours'  journey of you, there are gateways and drawing-rooms which might just as  well be yours as these, all built already; gateways built by the  greatest masters of sculpture that ever struck marble; drawing-rooms,  painted by Titian and Veronese; and you won't accept nor save these as  they are, but you will rather fetch the house-painter from over the way,  and let Titian and Veronese house the rats.    [Note 11: The reader can hardly but remember Mrs. Browning's  beautiful appeal for Italy, made on the occasion of the first great  Exhibition of Art in England:--        Magi of the east and of the west,      Your incense, gold, and myrrh are excellent!--      What gifts for Christ, then, bring ye with the rest?      Your hands have worked well. Is your courage spent      In handwork only? Have you nothing best,      Which generous souls may perfect and present,      And He shall thank the givers for? no light      Of teaching, liberal nations, for the poor,      Who sit in darkness when it is not night?      No cure for wicked children? Christ,--no cure,      No help for women, sobbing out of sight      Because men made the laws? no brothel-lure      Burnt out by popular lightnings? Hast thou found      No remedy, my England, for such woes?      No outlet, Austria, for the scourged and bound,      No call back for the exiled? no repose,      Russia for knouted Poles worked underground,      And gentle ladies bleached among the snows?      No mercy for the slave, America?      No hope for Rome, free France, chivalric France?      Alas, great nations have great shames, I say.      No pity, O world, no tender utterance      Of benediction, and prayers stretched this way      For poor Italia, baffled by mischance?      O gracious nations, give some ear to me!      You all go to your Fair, and I am one      Who at the roadside of humanity      Beseech your alms,--God's justice to be done.      So, prosper!    ]      79. \"Yes,\" of course, you answer; \"we want nice houses here, not houses  in Verona. What should we do with houses in Verona?\" And I answer, do  precisely what you do with the most expensive part of your possessions  here: take pride in them--only a noble pride. You know well, when you  examine your own hearts, that the greater part of the sums you spend on  possessions is spent for pride. Why are your carriages nicely painted  and finished outside? You don't see the outsides as you sit in them--the  outsides are for other people to see. Why are your exteriors of houses  so well finished, your furniture so polished and costly, but for other  people to see? You are just as comfortable yourselves, writing on your  old friend of a desk, with the white cloudings in his leather, and using  the light of a window which is nothing but a hole in the brick wall. And  all that is desirable to be done in this matter is merely to take pride  in preserving great art, instead of in producing mean art; pride in the  possession of precious and enduring things, a little way off, instead  of slight and perishing things near at hand. You know, in old English  times, our kings liked to have lordships and dukedoms abroad: and why  should not your merchant princes like to have lordships and estates  abroad? Believe me, rightly understood, it would be a prouder, and in  the full sense of our English word, more \"respectable\" thing to be lord  of a palace at Verona, or of a cloister full of frescoes at Florence,  than to have a file of servants dressed in the finest liveries that ever  tailor stitched, as long as would reach from here to Bolton:--yes, and a  prouder thing to send people to travel in Italy, who would have to say  every now and then, of some fair piece of art, \"Ah! this was _kept_ here  for us by the good people of Manchester,\" than to bring them travelling  all the way here, exclaiming of your various art treasures, \"These were  _brought_ here for us, (not altogether without harm) by the good people  of Manchester.\"      80. \"Ah!\" but you say, \"the Art Treasures Exhibition will pay; but  Veronese palaces won't.\" Pardon me. They _would_ pay, less directly, but  far more richly. Do you suppose it is in the long run good for  Manchester, or good for England, that the Continent should be in the  state it is? Do you think the perpetual fear of revolution, or the  perpetual repression of thought and energy that clouds and encumbers the  nations of Europe, is eventually profitable for _us_? Were we any the  better of the course of affairs in '48? or has the stabling of the  dragoon horses in the great houses of Italy any distinct effect in the  promotion of the cotton-trade? Not so. But every stake that you could  hold in the stability of the Continent, and every effort that you could  make to give example of English habits and principles on the Continent,  and every kind deed that you could do in relieving distress and  preventing despair on the Continent, would have tenfold reaction on the  prosperity of England, and open and urge, in a thousand unforeseen  directions, the sluices of commerce and the springs of industry.      81. I could press, if I chose, both these motives upon you, of pride and  self-interest, with more force, but these are not motives which ought to  be urged upon you at all. The only motive that I ought to put before  you is simply that it would be right to do this; that the holding of  property abroad, and the personal efforts of Englishmen to redeem the  condition of foreign nations, are among the most direct pieces of duty  which our wealth renders incumbent upon us. I do not--and in all truth  and deliberateness I say this--I do not know anything more ludicrous  among the self-deceptions of well-meaning people than their notion of  patriotism, as requiring them to limit their efforts to the good of  their own country;--the notion that charity is a geographical virtue,  and that what it is holy and righteous to do for people on one bank of a  river, it is quite improper and unnatural to do for people on the other.  It will be a wonderful thing, some day or other, for the Christian world  to remember, that it went on thinking for two thousand years that  neighbours were neighbours at Jerusalem, but not at Jericho; a wonderful  thing for us English to reflect, in after-years, how long it was before  we could shake hands with anybody across that shallow salt wash, which  the very chalk-dust of its two shores whitens from Folkestone to  Ambleteuse.      82. Nor ought the motive of gratitude, as well as that of mercy, to be  without its influence on you, who have been the first to ask to see, and  the first to show to us, the treasures which this poor lost Italy has  given to England. Remember, all these things that delight you here were  hers--hers either in fact or in teaching; hers, in fact, are all the  most powerful and most touching paintings of old time that now glow upon  your walls; hers in teaching are all the best and greatest of descendant  souls--your Reynolds and your Gainsborough never could have painted but  for Venice; and the energies which have given the only true life to your  existing art were first stirred by voices of the dead that haunted the  Sacred Field of Pisa.    Well, all these motives for some definite course of action on our part  towards foreign countries rest upon very serious facts; too serious,  perhaps you will think, to be interfered with; for we are all of us in  the habit of leaving great things alone, as if Providence would mind  them, and attending ourselves only to little things which we know,  practically, Providence doesn't mind unless we do. We are ready enough  to give care to the growing of pines and lettuces, knowing that they  don't grow Providentially sweet or large unless we look after them; but  we don't give any care to the good of Italy or Germany, because we think  that they will grow Providentially happy without any of our meddling.      83. Let us leave the great things, then, and think of little things; not  of the destruction of whole provinces in war, which it may not be any  business of ours to prevent; but of the destruction of poor little  pictures in peace, from which it surely would not be much out of our way  to save them. You know I said, just now, we were all of us engaged in  pulling pictures to pieces by deputy, and you did not believe me.  Consider, then, this similitude of ourselves. Suppose you saw (as I  doubt not you often do see) a prudent and kind young lady sitting at  work, in the corner of a quiet room, knitting comforters for her  cousins, and that just outside, in the hall, you saw a cat and her  kittens at play among the family pictures; amusing themselves especially  with the best Vandykes, by getting on the tops of the frames, and then  scrambling down the canvases by"]]]
