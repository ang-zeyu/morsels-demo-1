When  future ages shall gather up in memory the glorious and transcendent  deeds of Napoleon; when they shall number the blessings which he  dispensed, and the victories which he gained, never will they believe  that one man can have worked such miracles in so short a period. They  will rather fancy that the historian was playing with the credulity of  posterity, that he culled out all the great deeds performed by  successive generations of the greatest men during an infinite series  of ages, and that he has attributed them all to his ideal hero.    The soldiers who had bled beneath the banners of Napoleon would not  listen in silence to the praises which others bestowed upon his name.  His foreign conquests, which even they had lately considered as the  causes of our misfortunes, became again the sources of inexhaustible  admiration.    They recollected that Napoleon had ruled as the master of Madrid, of  Lisbon, of Munich, of Warsaw, of Hamburgh, of Berlin, of Vienna, of  Milan, of Amsterdam, of Rome, of Moscow, of Cairo.    Some recalled the memory of the day of Lodi. They saw him standing on  the bridge re-animating his dispirited followers, defying danger and  death whilst he waved the national flag, and drove the enemy from  their entrenchments, and blasted their glory. Others pointed him out  whilst crossing the perpetual snows and yawning chasms of Mount St.  Bernard, and then victorious on the plains of Marengo, where he won  that battle which insured the peace and glory of the country.    Austerlitz had its chroniclers, who described Napoleon as he fell with  the rapidity and violence of the thunderbolt on the battalions of the  Austrian and the Russian, and when he afforded to those trembling  monarchs an example of magnanimity which they knew not how to imitate  when generosity became their duty. Nor did his enthusiastic advocates  omit the field of Jena, where his victorious ensigns chased the flying  troops of Frederic, who, deceived by their recollections, yet held  themselves to be the paragons of military worth. They retraced his  paths amidst the burning sands of Egypt, amidst the icy wastes of  Muscovy; and in either region Napoleon supported fire and frost  without ostentation, and taught resignation and endurance to his  soldiers by his unshaken constancy.    More recent and more painful victories contributed equally to endear  him. They saw Napoleon in Champagne, when his veteran army scarcely  equalled one of the numerous divisions of the enemy. At the head of  his scanty troops he watched, and avoided, and surprised the  Austrians, the Russians, and the Prussians: wounding them on all sides  by his victorious weapons, and with such promptitude, that he seemed  to have bestowed wings upon iron and death. They placed him at Arcis  sur Aube, advancing before his squadrons, and rushing forward to meet  the balls and bullets of the enemy; for he sought to sacrifice on the  field of battle that life, which he foresaw he could no longer  dedicate on the throne, to the glory and prosperity of the nation.    In short, generals, officers, and soldiers, all vied with each other  in calling to mind the marches, the sieges, the conflicts, the  attacks, the days, which had immortalized their general[24]; and is  there a heart amongst us which does not beat higher at these  recollections?                       [Footnote 24: The soldiers identified the name of                     Napoleon with their country and their honour. When                     the accession of Louis XVIII. put an end to the                     sufferings and captivity of those who were                     imprisoned in England, they returned to France,                     cursing the cause of their liberty, and exclaiming,                     \"Vive l'Empereur!\" Even in the deserts of Russia,                     neither threats of ill treatment, nor promises of                     assistance offered to the French prisoners at the                     moment when they were starving, could extort a                     single complaint against Napoleon.]    The sentiments thus awakening in favour of Napoleon were cherished by  his friends, and by all those who, wearied of the Bourbons or  discontented with their government, now wished for his return. His  name, which lately we had scarcely dared to utter, was now in every  mouth, his image in every mind. The nation began to regret the  Emperor, then they longed for him; and every one was impressed by a  secret presentiment that these expectations would soon be realized.    Whilst this formidable revulsion of opinion was increasing and  appearing throughout the kingdom, it was scarcely heeded by the  ministry, the court, and the emigrants, who reposed with complacent  security on the volcano which they had kindled, and without  entertaining the slightest apprehension of the approaching explosion.    \"If they wish to go out of the kingdom,\" said M. de Chateaubriand,  when alluding to the partisans of the Emperor, \"if they wish to return  again, to receive or despatch letters, to send expresses, to make  proposals, to circulate false intelligence, and even to distribute  bribes, to assemble in secret or in public, to menace, to disseminate  libels, in short, to conspire against the government,--they are at  liberty to do their worst. The royal government, which began but eight  months ago, now rests upon so sure a basis, that, were it now to be  obstinate in repeating folly after folly, it would hold good in spite  of all its errors.\"    This infatuation, however, soon diminished. Without understanding the  full extent of the evil, the government ascertained that the army and  the nation were agitated and discontented, and they deliberated on the  methods which it would be proper to employ, not for the purpose of  conciliation, but for enforcing silence.    Acquainted with the uneasiness of the government, certain frantic  Chouans gave out that it was full time to despatch the Bonapartists.  One chieftain, celebrated in the annals of La Vendee, was even so  audacious as to declare to general Ex..... that he only waited for the  arrival of his faithful Vendeans, and then he would fall upon the  Jacobins.    The news of this massacre soon reached the ears of the intended  victims. Some quitted Paris, others armed themselves, and prepared to  sell their lives as dearly as they could. It is said that the  government became acquainted with the bloody conspiracy of the  Chouans, and that they relieved France and the world from the  spectacle of another St. Bartholomew's day.    This intended massacre (I have never been able to believe in it,)  persuaded the revolutionists that they could expect neither respite  nor mercy from the royalists, and that one of the two parties would be  compelled to destroy the other. The soldiers of Napoleon began to  unite, and to make themselves ready. The ministers were anxious to  disperse these assemblages, which gave them uneasiness; orders were  issued, by which all officers, whether of the staff or regimental,  were prohibited from residing at Paris without permission; and all who  were not Parisians by birth were ordered to return to their native  provinces. This measure increased the exasperation of the military,  and it did not diminish the danger. The reduced officers, instead of  conforming to the order, encouraged each other in disobedience.  According to the regulations of the war department, their contumacious  residence at Paris would subject them to the loss of their half-pay;  and many of them, though in poverty, preferred independence to  submission. The ministers were irritated by this resistance, and they  determined to make an example. It happened that a letter of  congratulation which General Excelmans addressed to his former  sovereign, the king of Naples, was intercepted. This opportunity was  gladly seized by the new Minister at war[25]. He put the General on  the half-pay list, and ordered him to retire immediately, and until  further orders, to the distance of sixty leagues from Paris. Excelmans  maintained that the Minister at war had no right to remove an officer,  not being in active service, from his domicile; and he would not go:  upon this he was immediately taken into custody. It was pretended that  he had been guilty of a traitorous intercourse with the enemies of the  King, and that he was also guilty of disobedience to his Majesty's  orders. The government expected that this blow would produce the best  possible effect; but it recoiled against them: Excelmans was known to  all France; he was valued as one of her bravest and most estimable  children. The spite and hatred of the ministers had loaded him with  accusations; but his alleged treasons, far from depriving him of  public esteem and public affection, only endeared him to his  companions in arms, and to the nation at large.                       [Footnote 25: Marshal Soult had just succeeded                     General Dupont.]    Excelmans was brought to trial, and the court acquitted him[26]. The  council of war, by sanctioning the disobedience of the General,  declared that the government did not possess that authority over  reduced officers which they had assumed; and from this moment the  government was ruined.

But Theodore Roosevelt stuck to him and  showed him who was master; and after that matters went better. The snow  continued to come down, and before the end of the journey was reached,  at Great Geyser Basin, the hunters almost perished from the cold.    Such pictures as the above give us some idea of the varied life that  Theodore Roosevelt has led. Even at this early age--he was but  thirty-three years old--he had been a college student, a traveller, an  author, an assemblyman, a ranchman and hunter, and a Civil Service  Commissioner. He had travelled the length and breadth of Europe and  through a large section of our own country. He had visited the palaces  of kings and the shacks of the humble cowboys of the far West, he had  met men in high places and in low, and had seen them at their best and  at their worst. Surely if \"experience is the school wherein man learns  wisdom,\" then the future President had ample means of growing wise, and  his works prove that those means were not neglected.    As already mentioned, when Grover Cleveland became President a second  time, he requested Theodore Roosevelt to retain his place on the Civil  Service Commission. This was a practical illustration of the workings of  the merit system, and it made for Mr. Cleveland many friends among his  former political enemies. By this movement the workings of the  Commission were greatly strengthened, so that by the time Theodore  Roosevelt resigned, on May 5, 1895, the Commission had added twenty  thousand places filled by government employees to those coming under the  merit system. This number was larger than any placed under the system  before that time, and the record has scarcely been equalled since.    \"He was a fighter for the system, day and night,\" says one who knew him  at that time. \"He was enthusiastic to the last degree, and had all sorts  of statistics at his fingers' ends. If anybody in the government employ  was doing wrong, he was willing to pitch into that person regardless of  consequences. Some few politicians thought he was a crank on the  subject, but the results speak for themselves. Some politicians, who  wanted the old spoils system retained, were often after him like a swarm  of angry hornets, but he never got out of their way, and when they tried  to sting, he slapped them in a way that soon made them leave him alone.  And more than that, he was very clever in the way that he presented his  case to those representatives and senators who understood the real  value of Civil Service reform. He made them appreciate what he and his  fellow-commissioners were trying to do, and when the Commission was  attacked in Congress it always had, as a consequence, a support that  could not be easily overthrown.\"    When Theodore Roosevelt resigned, President Cleveland wrote as follows  to him:--    \"You are certainly to be congratulated upon the extent and permanency of  civil service reform methods which you have so substantially aided in  bringing about. The struggle for its firm establishment and recognition  is past. Its faithful application and reasonable expansion remain,  subjects of deep interest to all who really desire the best attainable  public service.\" It was high praise for the retiring commissioner, and  it was well deserved.          CHAPTER X    APPOINTED POLICE COMMISSIONER OF NEW YORK CITY--CORRUPTNESS OF THE  DEPARTMENT--STRENUOUS EFFORTS TO MAKE MATTERS BETTER--A \"DRY\"  SUNDAY--ENFORCING THE TENEMENT HOUSE LAW AND OTHER MEASURES      During the time that Theodore Roosevelt was a Civil Service Commissioner  there were several important political changes made in New York City.    In the past there had been a great deal of what is familiarly called  \"machine politics,\" and matters had been going from bad to worse. But  now there was an upward turn by the election of William S. Strong to the  office of mayor. Mr. Strong was a man of high character, and was elected  by a vote that combined the best elements of all the political parties.    It was at a time when New York City was in urgent need of reform. Those  in power were doing but little to stop the corruption that was stalking  abroad upon every hand. Bribes were given and taken in nearly all  departments, clerks were being paid large salaries for doing practically  nothing, and contracts were put out, not to those who could do the best  work, but to those who would pay the political tricksters the most money  for them.    The record of the police department was perhaps the blackest of the lot.  It was to this department that the citizens looked for protection from  crime, yet it was known that many in the department winked at all sorts  of vice, providing they were properly paid for so doing. Saloons and  worse resorts were kept open in defiance of the law, and wickedness  flaunted itself in the face of the public in a manner that was truly  shocking. Occasionally a private citizen would try to do something to  mend matters, but his complaint was generally \"pigeon-holed,\" and that  would be the end of the matter. The rottenness, as it was well called,  extended from the highest places in the department to the lowest, so  that it was said not even a policeman could secure his appointment  without paying several hundred dollars for it, and this he was, of  course, expected to get back by blackmailing those who lived or did  business on his beat. And get it back the policeman would, even if he  had to make an Italian fruit dealer pay him a dollar a month for having  a stand on the sidewalk, where the walk was supposed to be free from  obstruction.    When William Strong came into office, the first thing he did was to cast  his eyes about him for reliable men who might aid him in purifying the  city. He already knew of Theodore Roosevelt's work as an assemblyman and  a Civil Service Commissioner.    \"Mr. Roosevelt is just the man to take the office of Police Commissioner  and put the department on an honorable basis,\" said the newly elected  mayor, and he lost no time in tendering the office to Mr. Roosevelt. The  tender was accepted, and Theodore Roosevelt was sworn into his new  position on May 24, 1895.    The appointment of Mr. Roosevelt to the office of Police Commissioner  was a great shock to nearly the entire police department. He was known  for his sterling honesty, and it was felt that he would not condone  crime in any shape or form.    \"There will be a grand shaking up,\" said more than one. \"Just you wait  till he gets to the bottom of things. He'll turn the light on in a way  that will make more than one officer tremble in his boots.\"    On the Board with Mr. Roosevelt were Andrew D. Parker, Avery D. Andrews,  and Frederick D. Grant, the latter the son of former President Grant.  Theodore Roosevelt was chosen president, and the Board lost no time in  getting to work.    \"The new Board found the department in a demoralized condition,\" says  Mr. Roosevelt, in his report on the matter. \"A recent grand jury had  investigated the records of many officers, and many indictments had been  found; 268 vacancies existed in the department, and 26 officers,  including one inspector and five captains, were under suspension on  account of indictment for crime.\" This was truly a sad state of affairs,  and a horrible example to the other large cities of our Union.    The Commissioners went to work with a will, and Theodore Roosevelt was  the leading spirit in every move made. Every branch of the police  department was given an overhauling, and those who would not do their  duty were promptly dismissed, while minor offences were met with heavy  fines. By an act of the legislature the force of men was increased to  eight hundred, to keep pace with the growth of the metropolis. The men  who were particularly faithful in the discharge of their duties were  rewarded by honorable mention, engrossed certificates, medals of honor,  and by promotions. More than this, they were given to understand that if  they did their duty faithfully they need not fear trouble from those  over them, no matter what changes were made. No officer was allowed to  accept blackmail money from those lower in the service; and above all,  no politics were to interfere with the fair and square running of the  whole department.    It was a gigantic task, and it cannot be said that it was totally  successful, for the opposition in some quarters was strong. More than  once Mr. Roosevelt was threatened with violence, but, as when an  assemblyman, he paid but scant attention to these mutterings.    His habits of personally investigating matters still clung to him, and  it is well remembered how he went around at odd hours of the day and  night, and on Sundays, seeing if the policemen were really doing their  duty. There had been a boast that all policemen were at their posts at  night. Mr. Roosevelt went out once and found just two out of an even  dozen where they should be. Then began that \"shaking up\" that has  resulted in better police service in New York to this day.    The effect of the new vigor in the police department was felt in many  other ways. There was a tenement-house law regarding buildings which  were unfit for human habitations. New York City was crowded with such  buildings, but nobody had ordered them torn down, because either nobody  wanted to bother, or the owners paid blackmail money to keep them  standing for the rent they could get out of them.    \"Those tenements must come down,\" said Theodore Roosevelt.    \"If you order them down, the owners will fight you to the bitter end,\"  said another officer of the department.    \"I don't care if they do. The houses are a menace to life and health.  They are filthy, and if a fire ever started in them, some would prove  regular traps. They have got to go.\" And shortly after that about a  hundred were seized, and the most destroyed.    The enforcement of the Sunday"]]]
