My father, seated amidst the throng of worshippers, would  sometimes add his voice to the hymn of praise, and finding a stranger  joining in their devotions they would wax enthusiastically cordial, and  we would return loaded with the sanctified offerings of sugar crystals  and other sweets.    One day my father invited one of the chanting choir to our place and got  him to sing us some of their sacred songs. The man went away probably  more than satisfied with the reward he received. The result was that we  had to take stern measures of self-defence,--such an insistent army of  singers invaded us. When they found our house impregnable, the musicians  began to waylay us in the streets. And as we went out for our walk in  the morning, every now and then would appear a _Tambura_,[26] slung over  a shoulder, at which we felt like game birds at the sight of the muzzle  of the hunter's gun. Indeed, so wary did we become that the twang of the  _Tambura_, from a distance, scared us away and utterly failed to bag us.    When evening fell, my father would sit out in the verandah facing the  garden. I would then be summoned to sing to him. The moon has risen; its  beams, passing though the trees, have fallen on the verandah floor; I am  singing in the _Behaga_ mode:    O Companion in the darkest passage of life....    My father with bowed head and clasped hands is intently listening. I can  recall this evening scene even now.    I have told of my father's amusement on hearing from Srikantha Babu of  my maiden attempt at a devotional poem. I am reminded how, later, I had  my recompense. On the occasion of one of our _Magh_ festivals several of  the hymns were of my composition. One of them was    \"The eye sees thee not, who art the pupil of every eye....\"    My father was then bed-ridden at Chinsurah. He sent for me and my  brother Jyoti. He asked my brother to accompany me on the harmonium and  got me to sing all my hymns one after the other,--some of them I had to  sing twice over. When I had finished he said:    \"If the king of the country had known the language and could appreciate  its literature, he would doubtless have rewarded the poet. Since that is  not so, I suppose I must do it.\" With which he handed me a cheque.    My father had brought with him some volumes of the Peter Parley series  from which to teach me. He selected the life of Benjamin Franklin to  begin with. He thought it would read like a story book and be both  entertaining and instructive. But he found out his mistake soon after we  began it. Benjamin Franklin was much too business-like a person. The  narrowness of his calculated morality disgusted my father. In some cases  he would get so impatient at the worldly prudence of Franklin that he  could not help using strong words of denunciation. Before this I had  nothing to do with Sanskrit beyond getting some rules of grammar by  rote. My father started me on the second Sanskrit reader at one bound,  leaving me to learn the declensions as we went on. The advance I had  made in Bengali[27] stood me in good stead. My father also encouraged me  to try Sanskrit composition from the very outset. With the vocabulary  acquired from my Sanskrit reader I built up grandiose compound words  with a profuse sprinkling of sonorous 'm's and 'n's making altogether a  most diabolical medley of the language of the gods. But my father never  scoffed at my temerity.    Then there were the readings from Proctor's Popular Astronomy which my  father explained to me in easy language and which I then rendered into  Bengali.    Among the books which my father had brought for his own use, my  attention would be mostly attracted by a ten or twelve volume edition of  Gibbon's Rome. They looked remarkably dry. \"Being a boy,\" I thought, \"I  am helpless and read many books because I have to. But why should a  grown up person, who need not read unless he pleases, bother himself  so?\"          (15) _At the Himalayas_      We stayed about a month in Amritsar, and, towards the middle of April,  started for the Dalhousie Hills. The last few days at Amritsar seemed as  if they would never pass, the call of the Himalayas was so strong upon  me.    The terraced hill sides, as we went up in a _jhampan_, were all aflame  with the beauty of the flowering spring crops. Every morning we would  make a start after our bread and milk, and before sunset take shelter  for the night in the next staging bungalow. My eyes had no rest the  livelong day, so great was my fear lest anything should escape them.  Wherever, at a turn of the road into a gorge, the great forest trees  were found clustering closer, and from underneath their shade a little  waterfall trickling out, like a little daughter of the hermitage playing  at the feet of hoary sages wrapt in meditation, babbling its way over  the black moss-covered rocks, there the _jhampan_ bearers would put down  their burden, and take a rest. Why, oh why, had we to leave such spots  behind, cried my thirsting heart, why could we not stay on there for  ever?    This is the great advantage of the first vision: the mind is not then  aware that there are many more such to come. When this comes to be known  to that calculating organ it promptly tries to make a saving in its  expenditure of attention. It is only when it believes something to be  rare that the mind ceases to be miserly in assigning values. So in the  streets of Calcutta I sometimes imagine myself a foreigner, and only  then do I discover how much is to be seen, which is lost so long as its  full value in attention is not paid. It is the hunger to really see  which drives people to travel to strange places.    My father left his little cash-box in my charge. He had no reason to  imagine that I was the fittest custodian of the considerable sums he  kept in it for use on the way. He would certainly have felt safer with  it in the hands of Kishori, his attendant. So I can only suppose he  wanted to train me to the responsibility. One day as we reached the  staging bungalow, I forgot to make it over to him and left it lying on a  table. This earned me a reprimand.    Every time we got down at the end of a stage, my father had chairs  placed for us outside the bungalow and there we sat. As dusk came on the  stars blazed out wonderfully through the clear mountain atmosphere, and  my father showed me the constellations or treated me to an astronomical  discourse.    The house we had taken at Bakrota was on the highest hill-top. Though it  was nearing May it was still bitterly cold there, so much so that on the  shady side of the hill the winter frosts had not yet melted.    My father was not at all nervous about allowing me to wander about  freely even here. Some way below our house there stretched a spur  thickly wooded with Deodars. Into this wilderness I would venture alone  with my iron-spiked staff. These lordly forest trees, with their huge  shadows, towering there like so many giants--what immense lives had  they lived through the centuries! And yet this boy of only the other day  was crawling round about their trunks unchallenged. I seemed to feel a  presence, the moment I stepped into their shade, as of the solid  coolness of some old-world saurian, and the checkered light and shade on  the leafy mould seemed like its scales.    My room was at one end of the house. Lying on my bed I could see,  through the uncurtained windows, the distant snowy peaks shimmering  dimly in the starlight. Sometimes, at what hour I could not make out, I,  half awakened, would see my father, wrapped in a red shawl, with a  lighted lamp in his hand, softly passing by to the glazed verandah where  he sat at his devotions. After one more sleep I would find him at my  bedside, rousing me with a push, before yet the darkness of night had  passed. This was my appointed hour for memorising Sanscrit declensions.  What an excruciatingly wintry awakening from the caressing warmth of my  blankets!    By the time the sun rose, my father, after his prayers, finished with me  our morning milk, and then, I standing at his side, he would once more  hold communion with God, chanting the Upanishads.    Then we would go out for a walk. But how should I keep pace with him?  Many an older person could not! So, after a while, I would give it up  and scramble back home through some short cut up the mountain side.    After my father's return I had an hour of English lessons. After ten  o'clock came the bath in icy-cold water; it was no use asking the  servants to temper it with even a jugful of hot water without my  father's permission. To give me courage my father would tell of the  unbearably freezing baths he had himself been through in his younger  days.    Another penance was the drinking of milk. My father was very fond of  milk and could take quantities of it. But whether it was a failure to  inherit this capacity, or that the unfavourable environment of which I  have told proved the stronger, my appetite for milk was grievously  wanting. Unfortunately we used to have our milk together. So I had to  throw myself on the mercy of the servants; and to their human kindness  (or frailty) I was indebted for my goblet being thenceforth more than  half full of foam.    After our midday meal lessons began again. But this was more than flesh  and blood could stand. My outraged morning sleep _would_ have its  revenge and I would be toppling over with uncontrollable drowsiness.  Nevertheless, no sooner did my father take pity on my plight and let me  off, than my sleepiness was off likewise. Then ho! for the mountains.    Staff in hand I would often wander away from one peak to another, but my  father did not object. To the end of his life, I have observed, he never  stood in the way of our independence. Many a time have I said or done  things repugnant alike to his taste and his judgment; with a word he  could have stopped me; but he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22224"],[0,"At Aboukir and Acre: A Story of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt (#12)"],[1,"on the French  infantry. When within a short distance, however, they suddenly stopped  their horses, checking them almost instantaneously, then they discharged  their carbines, and retired as rapidly as they had come. This they  repeated several times, but the shells of the French batteries played  havoc among them.    Never before had the Mamelukes encountered a shell-fire, and the  destruction wrought by these novel missiles bursting among them caused  them to retire at full speed, leaving three or four hundred dead behind  them, and abandoning some of the guns they had placed in position before  Chebreisse. A large Arab force had been drawn up in front of the town  when the Mamelukes charged, in readiness to follow the latter as soon  as they had broken the French ranks. This was the first opportunity that  Edgar had had of seeing any considerable body of this famous cavalry,  and he acknowledged that nothing could be more superb than their  appearance. The splendour of their dress, the beauty of their horses,  and magnificence of their arms and trappings excited his admiration to  the highest.    \"Now you will see,\" the sheik said exultingly, \"how they will gallop  over the Franks!\"    Edgar said nothing, but sat watching the splendid array as they swept  down upon the French line. Each of the French divisions was formed up in  square, with the artillery and dismounted cavalry in the intervals. The  volleys of musketry that received the charging Mamelukes was sufficient  to quell the ardour of the boldest horsemen in the world. In vain,  before drawing off, they circled round and round the French formation,  seeking for some weak spot upon which they could hurl themselves, and  when at length they drew off, the French soldiers ran out from their  ranks to plunder the fallen.    In silence the Arabs followed the Mamelukes, and the chief did not say a  word until they had ridden, at a leisurely pace, some distance beyond  the town.    \"You were right,\" he said at last to Edgar. \"I did not think that any  men on foot could have resisted that charge, but the Franks stood as  steadily as if it were a flock of sheep that was approaching them. The  cannon are terrible. Who would have thought that the balls they shoot  would explode and fly into pieces when they reach their mark! How is it  done?\"    Edgar explained as well as he was able the nature of shells, and how,  when they were fired, a fuse was lighted of a length just sufficient to  burn down to the powder within the ball at the time it reached the  object at which it was fired.    The fight on the river had been more severe, and had been maintained  with great obstinacy. At one time two gun-boats were taken by the  Egyptians. These, however, were recaptured, and the admiral's ship  burnt. Admiral Perre, who commanded the first flotilla, was wounded by a  cannon-ball, and the loss on both sides was severe.    For eight days the French continued to march forward. They suffered  terrible hardships, and at times were almost in a state of mutiny. The  interminable extent of sand utterly dispirited them, and they came to  believe that all that they had heard of Egypt was false, and that they  had been deliberately sent there by the directory to die. They doubted  even the existence of Cairo. Some, in their despair, threw themselves  into the river and were drowned. Many died on the march, less from  sunstroke and exhaustion than from despair. At last the Pyramids came in  sight, and their spirits rose again, for here, they were told, the whole  army of Mamelukes, Janizaries, and Arabs were assembled to give battle,  and they hoped therefore to terminate the campaign at a blow.    During the whole march they were harassed by the Arabs, and many were  cut off and killed. Marches were always performed at night, and at ten  o'clock in the morning they halted for the day, preparing themselves for  slumber by a dip in the Nile. On the 21st of July they advanced from  Omdinar, and at ten o'clock made out the enemy drawn up in line of  battle. They had constructed a large entrenched camp, with forty pieces  of ancient cannon incapable of movement. In this camp were 20,000  infantry, Janizaries, Spahis, and militia from Cairo. On the right were  the Mameluke cavalry, some 10,000 strong, with one or two foot-soldiers  to each horseman. To the left of the Mamelukes, and between them and the  Pyramids, were some 3000 Arab horse.    The French army was drawn up in the same order as in their last fight,  in great squares of divisions, the left resting on the Nile, and the  right on a large village. Napoleon, with his staff, reconnoitered the  enemy's entrenched camp, and by means of telescopes discovered that the  cannon were not upon field-carriages, but were simply heavy ship guns  that had been taken from their flotilla, and were served by the sailors.  They, therefore, could not be moved, and it was evident that if the  infantry left the camp they must do so without guns. The entrenchment  itself was not formidable; it had been begun but three days before, and  although it might be impracticable for cavalry, it would offer no  serious obstacle to an attack by infantry.    The discovery that the cannon were immovable, decided Napoleon in his  dispositions for the battle, and he gave orders that his army should  move across to his right, and should thus be concentrated for the attack  upon the Mamelukes and Arabs. Mourad Bey, seeing Napoleon's object, at  once ordered two-thirds of his cavalry to charge the French while they  were in motion, while the others were to remain near the entrenched  camp. So rapidly did they sweep down, that the French squares fell into  some confusion, and Desaix, with his division, which formed the head of  the column, had difficulty in maintaining themselves, their ranks being  somewhat broken by a grove of palm-trees through which they were  passing. They, however, received the Mamelukes with so terrible a fire  of musketry and grape-shot that the charge was not pressed home. The  Mamelukes, however, fought with desperate courage, sweeping round the  French squares, and even endeavouring to back their horses into the  line of bayonets, in hopes of breaking the wall of steel.    At length, however, they could do no more, and Mourad, with 2000 men,  rode off towards Gizeh, while the rest, not noticing the way that he had  taken, owing to the cloud of dust and smoke, rode back to the  entrenchment. The French now pressed forward with all speed, and a  division was thrown across the plain, so as to prevent the horsemen from  retreating by the line that Mourad had taken. The latter, seeing what  had happened, charged again and again with his Mamelukes, to endeavour  to break an opening through the French, by which the rest of his forces  could join him. The divisions of Generals Bon and Menon advanced to the  attack of the entrenchments; but the infantry, panic-stricken at the  defeat of the cavalry, did not await the attack, and after but two or  three rounds of shot had been fired by their cannon, deserted the  position, and fled in wild confusion to the river.    Here some succeeded in making their way across by boats, while many swam  over. The Mamelukes also attempted to swim their horses; a few  succeeded, but more were drowned. The total loss on the Egyptian side  amounted to some 10,000 men, including infantry, cavalry, and the slaves  of the Mamelukes. 1000 prisoners were taken, and some 2000 camels and  horses fell into the victors' hands. Great booty was captured by the  French soldiers, and for days they occupied themselves in recovering the  bodies of the drowned Mamelukes, which amply repaid their trouble, as  four or five hundred pieces of gold were often found upon them, besides  jewels and other valuables. The great bulk of their less portable  property they had, however, placed on board sixty boats, and these, when  the battle was seen to be lost, were set on fire, and their contents  destroyed.    The Arabs had taken little share in the battle. When the Mamelukes  charged, they had been ordered to remain in reserve, and only to charge  when the latter had broken the French squares. Burning with impatience  they watched the mighty torrent of horse sweep across the plain, then  came the roar of artillery and the incessant rattle of musketry. Then  they saw with astonishment the cavalry recoil; they witnessed charge  after charge, and then saw them sweeping round the squares, while the  plain, where they had first attacked, was strewn thickly with the bodies  of men and horses right up to the bayonets of the French line. The Arabs  burst into cries of dismay.    \"Nothing can stand such a fire as that,\" Edgar said to Sidi; \"the  musketry and grape from the cannon are mowing them down like grass--it  is terrible!\"    For a time the Mamelukes were hidden from sight by the cloud of smoke  and by the dust raised by their horses' hoofs, then they were seen to  emerge.    \"There is Mourad's banner!\" the sheik exclaimed; \"they are making for  Gizeh, but surely all cannot be there--there are not more than 2000 with  him.\"    Then another body of about equal strength broke out from the dust of the  battle, and went towards the entrenchments.    \"Let us join them there,\" the Arab shouted; and at full gallop they rode  across and joined the Mamelukes. Then, heralded by a tremendous  artillery fire, the French line advanced, pouring heavy volleys of  musketry into the cavalry, and upon the defenders of the entrenchments.  In two or three minutes the infantry were seen to be throwing away their  guns, leaping from the entrenchments, and flying in a disordered crowd  towards the river. Had the French possessed any cavalry, not one of the  fugitives could have escaped. The Mamelukes, seeing that all was lost,  had ascertained that Mourad had ridden towards Gizeh, and now started to  endeavour to rejoin him; while among the Arabs the cry"]]]
