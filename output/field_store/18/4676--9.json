Hulks of boats and masts and cordage and  docks and warehouses in the front, with muddy streets. Behind, many  buildings, grey-weathered ones and white-painted ones topped with many  chimneys, and towering here and there a smoke stack or graceful spire or  dome with minarets. Between are seen spreading tree tops, too. All these  in strange confused order fill all the horizon there with the exception  of one space, through which in June can be seen the 11:30 p. m. setting  sun. And in this open space on clear evenings, which by the way, in  June-July never get even dusky, at various hours can be seen a wondrous  mirage of waters and shores that lie on the other side of the city below  the direct line of sight.    Prominently rises the impressive magnitudinous structure of the  reverenced cathedral there, its dome of the hue of heaven's blue and set  with stars of solid gold. And when all else in the landscape is bathed  in morning purple or evening gloaming-grey, the levelled rays of the  coming or departing sun with a brilliantly striking effect glisten these  white and gold structures. Miles and miles away they catch the eye of  the sailor or the soldier.    Built on a low promontory jutting into the Dvina River, the city appears  to be mostly water-front. In fact, it is only a few blocks wide, but it  is crescent shaped with one horn in Smolny--a southern suburb having  dock and warehouse areas--and the other in Solombola on the north, a  city half as large as Archangel and possessing saw-mills, shipyards,  hospitals, seminary and a hard reputation, Archangel is convex westward,  so that one must go out for some distance to view the whole expanse of  the city from that direction. A mass of trees, a few houses, some large  buildings and churches mainly near the river, with a foreground of  shipping, is the summer view. The winter view is better, the bare trees  and the smaller amount of shipping at the docks permitting a better view  of the general layout of the city, the buildings and the type of houses  used by the population as homes.    Along the main street, Troitsky Prospect, runs a two-track trolley line  connecting the north and south suburbs mentioned in the preceding  paragraph. The cars are light and run very smoothly. They are operated  chiefly by women. Between the main street and the river-front near the  center of the city is the market-place. This covers several blocks and  is full of dingy stalls and alleys occupied by almost hopeless traders  and stocks in trade. As new wooden ware, home-made trinkets, second-hand  clothing and fresh fish can be obtained there the year around, and in  summer the offerings of vegetables are plentiful and tempting, the  market-place never lacks shoppers who carry their paper money down in  the same basket they use to carry back their purchases.    Public buildings are of brick or stone and are colored white, pink, grey  or bright red to give a light or warm effect. Down-town stores are built  some of brick and some of logs. Homes are square in type, with few  exceptions, built of logs, usually of very plain architecture, set  directly against the sidewalks, the yards and gardens being at the side  or rear. For privacy, each man's holdings are surrounded by a seven-foot  fence. Thus the streets present long vistas of wooden ware, partly house  and partly fence, with sometimes over-hanging trees, and with an  inevitable set of doorsteps projecting from each house over part of the  sidewalk. This set of steps is seldom used, for the real entrance to the  home is at the side of the house reached through a gateway in the fence.    The houses in Archangel are usually of two stories, with double windows  packed with cotton or flax to resist the cold. When painted at all, the  houses have been afflicted by their owners with one or more coats of  yellowish-brown stuff familiar to every American farmer who has ever  \"primed\" a big barn. A few houses have been clap-boarded on the outside  and some of these have been painted white.    The rest of the street view is snow, or, lacking that, a cobbled  pavement very rough and uneven, and lined on each side--sometimes on one  side only, or in the centre--with a narrow sidewalk of heavy planks laid  lengthwise over the otherwise open public sewer, a ditch about three  feet wide and from three to six feet deep. Woe be to him who goes  through rotten plank! It has been done.    So much for general scenic effects at Archangel. The Technical  Institute, used as Headquarters by the American Forces, is worth a  glance. It is a four-story solid-looking building about one hundred and  fifty feet square and eighty feet high, with a small court in the  centre. The outside walls of brick and stone are nearly four feet thick,  and their external surface is covered by pink-tinted plaster which  catches the thin light of the low-lying winter sun and causes the  building to seem to glow. On the front of the building there are huge  pillars rising from the second story balcony to the great Grecian gable  facing the river.    Inside, this great building is simple and severe, but rather pleasing.  Windows open into the court from a corridor running around the building  on each floor, and on the other side of the corridor are the doors of  the rooms once used as recitation and lecture halls, laboratories,  manual training shops, offices, etc. Outside, it was one of the city's  imposing buildings; inside, it was well-appointed. To the people of the  city it was a building of great importance. It was worthy to offer the  Commander of the American troops.    Here Colonel Stewart set up his Headquarters. The British Commanding  General had his headquarters, the G. H. Q., N. R. E. F., in another  school building in the centre of the city, within close reach of the  Archangel State Capitol Building. Colonel Stewart's headquarters were  conveniently near the two buildings which afterward were occupied and  fitted up for a receiving hospital and for a convalescent hospital  respectively, as related elsewhere, and not far either from the  protection of the regimental Headquarters Company quartered in Olga  Barracks.    Here the Commanding Officer of this expeditionary force of Americans off  up here near the North Pole on the strangest fighting mission ever  undertaken by an American force, tried vainly to keep track of his  widely dispersed forces. Up the railroad he had seen his third  battalion, under command of Major C. G. Young, go with General Finlayson  whom General Poole had ordered to take Vologda, four hundred miles to  the south. His first battalion, under Lieutenant Colonel Corbley he had  seen hurried off up the Dvina River under another British  Brigadier-General to take Kotlas hundreds of miles up the river. His  second battalion under Major J. Brooks Nichols was on duty in Archangel  and the nearby suburbs. These forces, and his 310th Engineer Battalion  and his Ambulance and Hospital Units were shifted about by the British  Generals and Colonels and Majors often without any information whatever  to Colonel Stewart, the American commanding officer. He lost touch with  his battalion and company commanders.    He had a discouraging time even in getting his few general orders  distributed to the American troops. No wonder that often an American  officer or soldier reporting in from a front by order or permission of a  British field officer, did not feel that American Headquarters was his  real headquarters and in pure ignorance was guilty of omitting some duty  or of failure to comply with some Archangel restriction that had been  ordered by American Headquarters. As to general orders from American  Headquarters dealing with the action of troops in the field, those were  so few and of so little impressiveness that they have been forgotten. We  must say candidly that the doughboy came to look upon American  Headquarters in Archangel as of very trifling importance in the strange  game he was up against. He knew that the strategy was all planned at  British G. H. Q., that the battle orders were written in the British  field officer's headquarters, that the transportation and supplies of  food were under control of the British that altogether too much of the  hospital service was under control of the British. Somehow the doughboy  felt that the very limited and much complained about service of his own  American Supply Unit, that lived for the most part on the fat of the  land in Bakaritza, should have been corrected by his commanding officer  who sat in American Headquarters. And they felt, whether correctly or  not, that the court-martial sentences of Major C. G. Young, who acted as  summary court officer at Smolny after he was relieved of his command in  the field, were unnecessarily harsh. And they blamed their commanding  officer, Colonel Stewart, for not taking note of that fact when he  reviewed and approved them. The writers of this history of the  expedition think the doughboy had much to justify his feeling.        V    WHY AMERICAN TROOPS WERE SENT TO RUSSIA    This Was A Much Mooted Question Among Soldiers--Partisan Politicians  Attacked With Vitriol--Partisan Explanations Did Not Explain--Red  Propaganda Helped Confuse The Case--Russians Of Archangel, Too, Were  Concerned--We Who Were There Think Of Those Pitiable Folk And Their  Hopeless Military And Political Situation That Tried Our Patience And  That Of The Directors Of The Expedition Who Undoubtedly Knew No Better  Than We Did.      To many people in America and England and France the North Russian  Expedition appears to have been an unwarrantable invasion of the land of  an ally, an ally whose land was torn by internal upheavals. It has been  charged that commercial cupidity conceived the campaign. Men"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22542"],[0,"Jesus the Christ (#12)"],[1,"once regarded as authentic but excluded from  later compilations as not strictly canonical, were current among the  Hebrews at and long before the time of Christ's birth. These scriptures  had their beginning in the proclamation of the law through Moses,[101]  who wrote the same, and delivered the writing into the official custody  of the priests with an express command that it be read in the assemblies  of the people at stated times. To these earlier writings were added the  utterances of divinely commissioned prophets, the records of appointed  historians, and the songs of inspired poets, as the centuries passed; so  that at the time of our Lord's ministry the Jews possessed a great  accumulation of writings accepted and revered by them as  authoritative.[102] These records are rich in prediction and promise  respecting the earthly advent of the Messiah, as are other scriptures to  which the Israel of old had not access.    Adam, the patriarch of the race, rejoiced in the assurance of the  Savior's appointed ministry, through the acceptance of which, he, the  transgressor, might gain redemption. Brief mention of the plan of  salvation, the author of which is Jesus Christ, appears in the promise  given of God following the fall--that though the devil, represented by  the serpent in Eden, should have power to bruise the heel of Adam's  posterity, through the seed of the woman should come the power to bruise  the adversary's head.[103] It is significant that this assurance of  eventual victory over sin and its inevitable effect, death, both of  which were introduced to earth through Satan the arch-enemy of mankind,  was to be realized through the offspring of woman; the promise was not  made specifically to the man, nor to the pair. The only instance of  offspring from woman dissociated from mortal fatherhood is the birth of  Jesus the Christ, who was the earthly Son of a mortal mother, begotten  by an immortal Father. He is the Only Begotten of the Eternal Father in  the flesh, and was born of woman.    Through scriptures other than those embodied in the Old Testament we  learn with greater fulness of the revelations of God to Adam respecting  the coming of the Redeemer. As a natural and inevitable result of his  disobedience, Adam had forfeited the high privilege he once  enjoyed--that of holding direct and personal association with his God;  nevertheless in his fallen state he was visited by an angel of the Lord,  who revealed unto him the plan of redemption: \"And after many days an  angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer  sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the  Lord commanded me. And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a  similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is  full of grace and truth. Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in  the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name  of the Son for evermore. And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam,  which beareth record of the Father and the Son, saying: I am the Only  Begotten of the Father from the beginning, henceforth and for ever, that  as thou hast fallen thou mayest be redeemed, and all mankind, even as  many as will.\"[104]    The Lord's revelation to Adam making known the ordained plan whereby the  Son of God was to take upon Himself flesh in the meridian of time, and  become the Redeemer of the world, was attested by Enoch, son of Jared  and father of Methuselah. From the words of Enoch we learn that to him  as to his great progenitor, Adam, the very name by which the Savior  would be known among men was revealed--\"which is Jesus Christ, the only  name which shall be given under heaven, whereby salvation shall come  unto the children of men.\"[105] The recorded covenant of God with  Abraham, and the reiteration and confirmation thereof with Isaac and in  turn with Jacob--that through their posterity should all nations of the  earth be blessed--presaged the birth of the Redeemer through that chosen  lineage.[106] Its fulfilment is the blessed heritage of the ages.    In pronouncing his patriarchal blessing upon the head of Judah, Jacob  prophesied: \"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver  from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the  gathering of the people be.\"[107] That by Shiloh is meant the Christ is  evidenced by the fulfilment of the conditions set forth in the  prediction, in the state of the Jewish nation at the time of our Lord's  birth.[108]    Moses proclaimed the coming of a great Prophet in Israel, whose ministry  was to be of such importance that all men who would not accept Him would  be under condemnation; and that this prediction had sole reference to  Jesus Christ is conclusively shown by later scriptures. Thus spake the  Lord unto Moses: \"I will raise them up a Prophet from among their  brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he  shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it shall come to  pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak  in my name, I will require it of him.\"[109] The system of sacrifice  expressly enjoined in the Mosaic code was essentially a prototype of the  sacrificial death to be accomplished by the Savior on Calvary. The blood  of countless altar victims, slain by Israel's priests in the course of  prescribed ritual, ran throughout the centuries from Moses to Christ as  a prophetic flood in similitude of the blood of the Son of God appointed  to be shed as an expiatory sacrifice for the redemption of the race.  But, as already shown, the institution of bloody sacrifice as a type of  the future death of Jesus Christ dates from the beginning of human  history; since the offering of animal sacrifices through the shedding of  blood was required of Adam, to whom the significance of the ordinance,  as \"a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father\",  was expressly defined.[110]    The paschal lamb, slain for every Israelitish household at the annually  recurring feast of the Passover, was a particular type of the Lamb of  God who in due time would be slain for the sins of the world. The  crucifixion of Christ was effected at the Passover season; and the  consummation of the supreme Sacrifice, of which the paschal lambs had  been but lesser prototypes, led Paul the apostle to affirm in later  times: \"For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.\"[111]    Job in the day of dire affliction rejoiced in his testimony of the  coming Messiah, and declared with prophetic conviction: \"I know that my  redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the  earth.\"[112] The songs of David the psalmist abound in oft-recurring  allusion to the earthly life of Christ, many circumstances of which are  described in detail, and, as to these, corroboration of the utterances  is found in New Testament scriptures.[113]    Isaiah, whose prophetic office was honored by the personal testimony of  Christ and the apostles, manifested in numerous passages the burden of  his conviction relating to the great event of the Savior's advent and  ministry on earth. With the forcefulness of direct revelation he told of  the Virgin's divine maternity, whereof Immanuel should be born, and his  prediction was reiterated by the angel of the Lord, over seven centuries  later.[114] Looking down through the ages the prophet saw the  accomplishment of the divine purposes as if already achieved, and sang  in triumph: \"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and  the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called  Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince  of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no  end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to  establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even  forever.\"[115]    Immediately prior to its fulfilment, the blessed promise was repeated by  Gabriel, sent from the presence of God to the chosen Virgin of  Nazareth.[116] As made known to the prophet and by him proclaimed, the  coming Lord was the living Branch that should spring from the undying  root typified in the family of Jesse;[117] the foundation Stone insuring  the stability of Zion;[118] the Shepherd of the house of Israel;[119]  the Light of the world,[120] to Gentile as well as Jew; the Leader and  Commander of His people.[121] The same inspired voice predicted the  forerunner who should cry in the wilderness: \"Prepare ye the way of the  Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\"[122]    Isaiah was permitted to read the scroll of futurity as to many  distinguishing conditions to attend the Messiah's lowly life and atoning  death. In Him the prophet saw One who would be despized and rejected of  men, a Man of sorrows, acquainted with grief, One to be wounded and  bruised for the transgressions of the race, on whom would be laid the  iniquity of us all--a patient and willing Sacrifice, silent under  affliction, as a lamb brought to the slaughter. The Lord's dying with  sinners, and His burial in the tomb of the wealthy were likewise  declared with prophetic certainty.[123]    Unto Jeremiah came the word of the Lord in terms of plainness, declaring  the sure advent of the King by whom the safety of both Judah and Israel  should be assured;[124] the Prince of the House of David, through whom  the divine promise to the son of Jesse should be realized.[125] Under  the same spirit prophesied Ezekiel,[126] Hosea,[127] and Micah.[128]  Zechariah broke off in the midst of fateful prediction to voice the glad  song of thanksgiving and praise as he beheld in vision the simple  pageantry of the King's triumphal entry into the city of David.[129]  Then the prophet bewailed the grief of the conscience-smitten nation, by  whom, as was foreseen, the Savior"]]]
