Sure,  half of the children are not dry yet, and the other half are not  dressed. Bridget Honora, darlin', look in the other room and see how  they're coming on. (_Exit_ BRIDGET _at R._)    MATSY. I think we ought to be there early, so as we can get a good  seat on the front row. I don't want to miss nothing. (_Hangs up a  boy's union suit._)    MRS. MULLIGAN. True for you, Matsy, and I don't want yeez to be  missing anything either. It ain't like as if yeez go to a fine  Christmas entertainment ivery night of yer lives. (_Washes._)    MATSY. It's the first one any of us ever went to at all, at all. Do  yeez think they be after having moving pictures?    MRS. MULLIGAN. Of course not. Not in a Sunday School, Matsy. But  belike they'll have a fine, grand Christmas tree with singin' and  spaches and fine costumes and prisints for every one. (_Calls off  R._) Bridget Honora!    BRIDGET (_off R._). Yes, maw?    MRS. MULLIGAN. Come here.    _Enter_ BRIDGET _from R._    BRIDGET. Melissa and Micky Machree have been scrubbed until they  shine. They're sitting in the window drying in the sun. Mary Ann is  cleaning Peter Pan in the lard bucket, and Patsy is washing Teddy  Magee in the rain-barrel. Nora is curling Clarissa's hair with the  poker, and somebody's untied the goat.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Untied the goat, is it? Matsy Mulligan, put on yer hat  at once and see what's become of Shamus O'Brien. He's a good goat, is  Shamus, but he's like the late Mr. Mulligan, he has a rovin'  disposition and a tremenjous appetite. Hurry now, Matsy.    MATSY (_whining_). Aw, now, maw, I can't go and hunt the goat. I'm all  dressed up for the entertainment. If I go after the goat, sure it's  all mussed up I'll be.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Yis, if I swat you one wid this wet cloth, it's worse  than mussed up you'll be. Hurry after the goat. Niver a step does any  Mulligan take from this house tonight until Shamus O'Brien is safe in  the kitchen, wid his horns tied to the wash boiler.    MATSY. Sure, I dunno where to look fer him.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Go over to Mrs. O'Toole's cabbage garden; like as not  ye'll find him there. Sure, Shamus has a fine appetite for cabbages.    MATSY. Don't let 'em start afore I get back. I don't want to miss  nothin'. (_Takes cap and exits L._)    MRS. MULLIGAN. Now, Bridget Honora, lave off hanging up the clothes  and go in and see if Melissa and Micky Machree are dry yet. And if  they are call me in and I'll attend to their costumes.    BRIDGET. Maw, Mary Ann's having an awful time. She's growed so that  her skirt and her waist has parted company, and what she'll be after  doing I don't know at all, at all.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Is there anything she can use as a sash?    BRIDGET. No'm. Nora and Clarissa have used up all the sashes.    MRS. MULLIGAN (_takes fringed bureau cover from wash-basket_). Look  here, now, Bridget Honora, see what I've found in the wash. It's a  tidy to go on top of a dresser, but I'm thinking it's just the thing  to fill the gap between the skirt and the waist of Mary Ann.    BRIDGET. Yes, maw. (_Exit R._)    _Enter_ PATSY _from R. He runs in and is very much excited._    PATSY. Oh, maw, maw, come quick! Hurry, or he'll be drowned.    MRS. MULLIGAN. What is it, Patsy? Spake quick.    PATSY. It's Teddy Magee. I was givin' him a wash in the rain-barrel,  when all of a sudden, bad luck to him, he slipped through me fingers  and fell head-first down in the barrel. (_Cries._) Oh, it's drownded  dead he'll be. Oh, oh! (_Cries._)    MRS. MULLIGAN. Oh, me baby, me baby! (_Rushes out at R._)    _Enter_ NORA _and_ CLARISSA _from L._    NORA. Now sit right down there, Clarissa, and don't be moving a hair,  because you're all fixed and ready for the entertainment.    CLARISSA. And how do I look, Nora?    NORA. Ye look like a Christmas angel, so you do. Your hair curled just  lovely and your striped stockings will be the admiration and envy of  the entire Sunday School.    PATSY. Oh, Nora Eudora, come on quick. Teddy Magee fell in the  rain-barrel and it's drownded dead he is intirely. (_Cries._)    NORA. In the rain-barrel? How did he get in the rain-barrel?    PATSY. Sure, I was washing him, I was. And he was that slippery with  the soap that he slid through me fingers and down to the bottom of the  barrel.    NORA. Oh, the poor little Teddy Magee. (_Runs out R., followed by_  PATSY _and_ CLARISSA.)    _Enter_ MARY ANN _and_ PETER PAN _from L._    MARY ANN. And how de yeez like me new sash, Peter Pan?    PETER PAN. Scwumptious.    MARY ANN. It's a tidy cover off'n a bureau, and I don't want to wear  it at all, at all. Folks'll be after thinking I'm a bureau. Don't it  look funny, Peter Pan?    PETER PAN. Scwumptious.    MARY ANN. I'm not going to wear it, so I'm not.    _Enter_ BRIDGET _from L._    BRIDGET. Mary Ann Mulligan, and what are yeez trying to do with your  nice new sash?    MARY ANN. I ain't going to wear no tidy cover. Folks'll be after  thinking I'm a bureau.    BRIDGET. Sure they'll think worse than that if yeez take it off.  That's what comes of yer growing so fast. Yer skirt is fer six years  old, and yer waist is fer six years old, and so you have to wear the  sash to help out the other two years. Sashes are awful stylish,  anyhow. It's pretty, too, ain't it, Peter Pan?    PETER PAN. Scwumptious.    _Enter_ MRS. MULLIGAN _from R., followed by_ PASTY _and_ NORA.    MRS. MULLIGAN. It's lucky for him that there wasn't any more water in  the rain-barrel, or he would have been drownded dead sure. Patsy, yeez  had no business to let him drop. Nora, you go out and finish him.  Where's Clarissa?    _Enter_ CLARISSA _from R._    CLARISSA. Here I am, maw.    MRS. MULLIGAN (_looks her over carefully_). Well, you're all ready.  That's one. Nora and Patsy and Matsy are all ready. That makes four.  Mary Ann, are you all fixed?    MARY ANN. Yes, mum, but I don't like me sash at all, at all. Folks  will all know it's a bureau tidy, it's got fringe and everything.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Oh, ho, me fine young lady. I suppose yeez want a  peek-a-boo dress all trimmed with mayonnaise ruffles down the bias, do  you? It's lucky for you I found that tidy in the wash, so it is. And  don't yeez eat too much or breathe hard or ye'll bust it, and then  where'll you be at?    BRIDGET. Maw, Mary Ann's chewing her apron.    MRS. MULLIGAN (_at the wash-tub_). Mary Ann Mulligan, take that apron  out'n your mouth. I niver saw such a girl to be always chewing  something. It's first yer dress and then yer apron or your petticoat,  whatever happens to be your topmost garment. Clothes were not made to  chew.    _Enter_ NORA _with_ TEDDY, MELISSA _and_ MICKY, _from L._    NORA. Here they are, maw, all ready for the party.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Are ye sure they're all clean?    NORA. I am that. They've been scrubbed until me two arms ache. And  Micky's had a bath in the rain-barrel.    MICKY. I have that, and I don't want another one, either.    MRS. MULLIGAN. All yeez sit down and let me look ye over.    NORA. Have ye finished the washing, maw?    MRS. MULLIGAN. For the prisint, yes. I have more important duties to  perform. Now, first and foremost, don't walk pigeon-toed. Bridget,  have ye got a clane handkerchief?    BRIDGET. Yis, mum.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Well, don't forget to use it if the necessity arises,  and you'd better set next to Peter Pan so's he can use it, too. He's  been kinder nosey all day, and I shouldn't wonder if he wasn't coming  down with a cold in his head. How do you feel, Peter Pan?    PETER PAN. Scwumptious.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Micky Machree Mulligan, and what are yeez looking  cross-eyed for? Do ye think it improves yer beauty?    MICKY. I thought there was a speck of dirt on me nose.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Well, there's not, and hold yer head up straight.    PATSY. Maw, ain't it most time to go?    MRS. MULLIGAN. It lacks two hours yet of the time, and Matsy ain't  come back with the goat. Whatever's become of Shamus O'Brien I'd like  to know. Which of yeez seen him last?    NORA. I saw him this mornin'. He was eatin' a tin tomato can down in  the alley.    MRS. MULLIGAN. The poor thing! Now I suppose I'll have a sick goat on  me hands on top of all me other troubles--and tomorrow's Christmas  Day.    BRIDGET. Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all,  at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?    MRS. MULLIGAN. Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I  chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest  and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there,  and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it,  it's bound to be most fashionable and select.    MARY ANN. But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully  nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open  arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and  say, \"Thank yeez kindly and much obliged.\" Can ye do that?    ALL. Oh, yes, mum.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see  anything of Matsy and the goat.    CLARISSA. Yes, mum. (_Goes to door at L._)    MRS. MULLIGAN. Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've  told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and  yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.    CLARISSA (_at door_). Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.    MRS. MULLIGAN. It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the  O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.    _Enter_ MRS. O'TOOLE, _limping in from L._    MRS. O'TOOLE. Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.    MRS. MULLIGAN. The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.    MRS. O'TOOLE. I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to  set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Me goat, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19831"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"to the  General Government, and the responsibilities of citizens of the Northern  States, many of those citizens were, little by little, brought to the  conclusion that slavery was a sin for which _they_ were answerable, and  that it was the duty of the Federal Government to abate it. Though, at  the date above referred to, numerically so weak, when compared with  either of the political parties at the North, as to excite no  apprehension of their power for evil, the public demonstrations of the  Abolitionists were violently rebuked generally at the North. The party  was contemned on account of the character of its leaders, and the more  odious because chief among them was an Englishman, one Thompson, who was  supposed to be an emissary, whose mission was to prepare the way for a  dissolution of the Union. Let us hope that it was reverence for the  obligations of the Constitution as the soul of the Union that suggested  lurking danger, and rendered the supposed emissary for its destruction  so odious that he was driven from a Massachusetts hall where he  attempted to lecture. But bodies in motion will overcome bodies at rest,  and the unreflecting too often are led by captivating names far from the  principles they revere.    Thus, by the activity of the propagandists of abolitionism, and the  misuse of the sacred word Liberty, they recruited from the ardent  worshipers of that goddess such numbers as gave them in many Northern  States the balance of power between the two great political forces that  stood arrayed against each other; then and there they came to be courted  by both of the great parties, especially by the Whigs, who had become  the weaker party of the two. Fanaticism, to which is usually accorded  sincerity as an extenuation of its mischievous tenets, affords the best  excuse to be offered for the original abolitionists, but that can not be  conceded to the political associates who joined them for the purpose of  acquiring power; with them it was but hypocritical cant, intended to  deceive. Hence arose the declaration of the existence of an  \"irrepressible conflict,\" because of the domestic institutions of  sovereign, self-governing States--institutions over which neither the  Federal Government nor the people outside of the limits of such States  had any control, and for which they could have no moral or legal  responsibility.    Those who are to come after us, and who will look without prejudice or  excitement at the record of events which have occurred in our day, will  not fail to wonder how men professing and proclaiming such a belief  should have so far imposed upon the credulity of the world as to be able  to arrogate to themselves the claim of being the special friends of a  Union contracted in order to insure \"domestic tranquillity\" among the  people of the States united; that _they_ were the advocates of peace, of  law, and of order, who, when taking an oath to support and maintain the  Constitution, did so with a mental reservation to violate one of the  provisions of that Constitution--one of the conditions of the  compact--without which the Union could never have been formed. The tone  of political morality which could make this possible was well indicated  by the toleration accorded in the Senate to the flippant,  inconsequential excuse for it given by one of its most eminent  exemplars--\"Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this  thing?\"--meaning thereby, not that it would be the part of a dog to  _violate_ his oath, but to _keep_ it in the matter referred to. (See  Appendix D.)      [Footnote 12: Extract from a speech of Mr. Davis, of Mississippi, in the  Senate of the United States, May 17, 1860: \"There is a relation  belonging to this species of property, unlike that of the apprentice or  the hired man, which awakens whatever there is of kindness or of  nobility of soul in the heart of him who owns it; this can only be  alienated, obscured, or destroyed, by collecting this species of  property into such masses that the owner is not personally acquainted  with the individuals who compose it. In the relation, however, which can  exist in the Northwestern Territories, the mere domestic connection of  one, two, or at most half a dozen servants in a family, associating with  the children as they grow up, attending upon age as it declines, there  can be nothing against which either philanthropy or humanity can make an  appeal. Not even the emancipationist could raise his voice; for this is  the high-road and the open gate to the condition in which the masters  would, from interest, in a few years, desire the emancipation of every  one who may thus be taken to the northwestern frontier.\"]    [Footnote 13: See \"Report of Senate Committee of Inquiry into the John  Brown Raid.\"]          CHAPTER VI.        Agitation continued.--Political Parties: their Origin, Changes,      and Modifications.--Some Account of the \"Popular Sovereignty,\"      or \"Non-Intervention,\" Theory.--Rupture of the Democratic      Party.--The John Brown Raid.--Resolutions introduced by the      Author into the Senate on the Relations of the States, the      Federal Government, and the Territories; their Discussion and      Adoption.      The strife in Kansas and the agitation of the territorial question in  Congress and throughout the country continued during nearly the whole of  Mr. Buchanan's Administration, finally culminating in a disruption of  the Union. Meantime the changes, or modifications, which had occurred or  were occurring in the great political parties, were such as may require  a word of explanation to the reader not already familiar with their  history.    The _names_ adopted by political parties in the United States have not  always been strictly significant of their principles. The old Federal  party inclined to nationalism, or consolidation, rather than  federalization, of the States. On the other hand, the party originally  known as Republican, and afterward as Democratic, can scarcely claim to  have been distinctively or exclusively such in the primary sense of  these terms, inasmuch as no party has ever avowed opposition to the  general principles of government by the people. The fundamental idea of  the Democratic party was that of the sovereignty of the States and the  federal, or confederate, character of the Union. Other elements have  entered into its organization at different periods, but this has been  the vital, cardinal, and abiding principle on which its existence has  been perpetuated. The Whig, which succeeded the old Federal party,  though by no means identical with it, was, in the main, favorable to a  strong central government, therein antagonizing the transatlantic  traditions connected with its name. The \"Know-Nothing,\" or \"American,\"  party, which sprang into existence on the decadence of the Whig  organization, based upon opposition to the alleged overgrowth of the  political influence of naturalized foreigners and of the Roman Catholic  Church, had but a brief duration, and after the Presidential election of  1856 declined as rapidly as it had arisen.    At the period to which this narrative has advanced, the \"Free-Soil,\"  which had now assumed the title of \"Republican\" party, had grown to a  magnitude which threatened speedily to obtain entire control of the  Government. Based, as has been shown, upon sectional rivalry and  opposition to the growth of the Southern equally with the Northern  States of the Union, it had absorbed within itself not only the  abolitionists, who were avowedly agitating for the destruction of the  system of negro servitude, but other diverse and heterogeneous elements  of opposition to the Democratic party. In the Presidential election of  1856, their candidates (Fremont and Dayton) had received 114 of a total  of 296 electoral votes, representing a popular vote of 1,341,264 in a  total of 4,053,967. The elections of the ensuing year (1857) exhibited a  diminution of the so-called \"Republican\" strength, and the Thirty-fifth  Congress, which convened in December of that year, was decidedly  Democratic in both branches. In the course of the next two years,  however, the Kansas agitation and another cause, to be presently  noticed, had so swollen the ranks of the so-called Republicans, that, in  the House of Representatives of the Thirty-sixth Congress, which met in  December, 1859, neither party had a decided majority, the balance of  power being held by a few members still adhering to the virtually  extinct Whig and \"American,\" or Know-Nothing, organizations, and a still  smaller number whose position was doubtful or irregular. More than eight  weeks were spent in the election of a Speaker; and a so-called  \"Republican\" (Mr. Pennington, of New Jersey) was finally elected by a  majority of one vote. The Senate continued to be decidedly Democratic,  though with an increase of the so-called \"Republican\" minority.    The cause above alluded to, as contributing to the rapid growth of the  so-called Republican party after the elections of the year 1857, was the  dissension among the Democrats, occasioned by the introduction of the  doctrine called by its inventors and advocates \"popular sovereignty,\" or  \"non-intervention,\" but more generally and more accurately known as  \"squatter sovereignty.\" Its character has already been concisely stated  in the preceding chapter. Its origin is generally attributed to General  Cass, who is supposed to have suggested it in some general expressions  of his celebrated \"Nicholson letter,\" written in December, 1847. On the  16th and 17th of May, 1860, it became necessary for me in a debate, in  the Senate, to review that letter of Mr. Cass. From my remarks then  made, the following extract is taken:        \"The Senator [Mr. Douglas] might have remembered, if he had      chosen to recollect so unimportant a thing, that I once had to      explain to him, ten years ago, the fact that I repudiated the"]]]
