[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23624"],[0,"Ride Proud, Rebel! (#12)"],[1,"ago,\" Drew commented.    Kirby nodded toward the brush. They were facing a small woodland into  which a thin trace of path led. Good cover for trouble. Looping reins  over his arm, Drew walked forward, Colt in hand, using scout tricks to  cover the noise of his advance into the green shimmer of the trees.    The trail led ahead without any attempt at concealment. The other two  troopers must have tricked Boyd into taking that way; maybe they had  even put a revolver on him once they were off the road. It was only too  easy for a man to straggle from the company and not be missed until  hours and miles later.    \"Now, sonny, there ain't no use makin' a big fuss....\"    Drew dropped the reins and slipped on.    \"You can see for yourself, boy, that m' hoss ain't gonna be able to git  much farther. You can nurse him along an' take it easy. Them blue  bellies ain't gonna be hard on a nice little boy like you--no, suh,  they ain't--even if they find you. We jus' trade fair an' square. No  trouble....\"    \"'Course,\" another, harsher voice cut in, \"if you want to make it rough,  well, that's what you'll git! We're takin' that hoss, no matter what!\"    \"You ain't!\" There was a short snap of sound, the cocking of a hand gun.    \"Pull that on me, will you!\"    \"I'll shoot! I'm warnin' you ... touch m' horse, and I'll shoot!\" Boyd's  voice scaled higher.    Drew ran, his arm up to shield his face from the whip of branches. He  came out at a small stream. Boyd was backed against a tree while the two  others advanced on him from different directions.    \"That's enough!\" Drew's Colt was pointed at Hilders. The man's head  jerked around. \"Get goin',\" the scout ordered.    Cambridge blinked stupidly, but Hilders took a step back to catch up the  reins of a horse that stood dull-eyed, its head bent, pink foam roping  from its muzzle as it breathed in heavy gasps.    \"I said--get!\" Drew advanced, and Hilders gave ground again, towing the  trembling horse.    \"Now, we don't want no trouble,\" Cambridge said hurriedly. \"It woulda  bin a fair trade.... Sonny, heah, ain't got place in the company  anyhow----\"    \"Get!\" Drew's weapon raised a fraction of an inch. Cambridge's protest  thickened into a mumble and he went. When both men had disappeared, Drew  turned to Boyd.    \"Put that away--\" he flicked a finger at the other's Colt--\"and mount  up. We'll have to push to get back to the troop.\"    He watched the other lead the bay away from the stream side. Kirby was  right, the horse was in better condition than most of the others in the  company, and sooner or later someone might again try to rank Boyd out of  it. There were a good many in that hunted column who would see that in  the same light as Hilders and Cambridge did and would say so, with the  weight of public opinion to back them. Campbell had set their course for  Calhoun--and in that town Boyd and the raiders must definitely part  company.          6    _Horse Trade_      \"What's this heah Calhoun like?\" Kirby watched Drew loosen the saddle  blanket, lifting it from the gelding as gently as he could.    \"Not much--\" Drew was beginning, then he sucked in his breath and stood  staring at the nasty sight he had just uncovered. He slung the blanket  to the ground as Boyd came up, leading the bay. It was the younger boy  who spoke first.    \"You ain't goin' to try to ride him now, Drew!\" That protest came  spontaneously. Drew thought that Shawnee's end had put the last bit of  steel over his feelings, but he had to agree with Boyd now: no one with  any humanity could make the gelding carry so much as a blanket over that  back, let alone saddle and rider.    \"Here!\" Roughly, his face flushed, Boyd jerked on the reins of his own  mount, bringing the bay sidling toward Drew. \"You can take Bruce....\"    He stooped, reaching for Drew's saddlebags. \"You have to ride scout.  I'll walk this one a while. Maybe he can carry me later. I ride light.\"    Drew shook his head. \"Not that light,\" he commented dryly. \"No, I guess  this is where I do some tradin'--\"    \"House-smoke yonder ...\" Kirby pointed. They could see the thin trail of  smoke rising steadily this windless morning. \"Best make it fast--the  cap'n is already thinkin' about pointin' up an' headin' out.\"    Drew loosened his side arms in their holsters. He always hated this  business, but it was part of a day's work in the cavalry now. He just  hoped that he wouldn't have to do his impressing at gun point. He  entrusted saddle and blanket to Boyd, but made the other wait outside  the farmyard twenty minutes later as he shepherded the gelding into the  enclosure where chickens squawked and ran witlessly and a dog hurled  himself to the end of a chain, giving tongue like a hound on a hot  scent.    Drew skirted that defender, moving toward the barn. But he was still  well away from the half-open door when a woman hurried out, a basket in  her hands, her face picturing surprise and apprehension. She stopped  short to stare at Drew.    \"Who are you--what do you want?\" Her two questions ran together in a  single breathless sentence. Drew looked beyond her. No one else issued  from the barn or came in answer to the dog's warning. He took off his  hat.    \"I need a horse, ma'am.\" He said it bluntly, impatiently. After all, how  could you make a demand like that more courteous or soft? The very fact  that he had been driven to this made him angry.    For a moment she looked at him uncomprehendingly, and then her eyes  shifted to the gelding. She came forward a step or two, and there was a  blaze of anger in the gaze she directed once more to the man.    \"That horse's galled raw!\" She accused.    \"Don't you think I know it?\" he returned abruptly. \"That's why I have to  have another mount.\"    A quick step back and she was between him and the door of the barn,  holding the basket as a shield between them. It was full of eggs.    \"You won't get one here!\" she snapped.    \"Ma'am\"--Drew had his temper under control now--\"I don't want to take  your horse if you have one. But I'm under orders to keep up with the  company. And I'm goin' to do what I have to....\"    He dropped the gelding's reins, walked forward, hoping she wouldn't make  him push around her. But apparently she read the determination in his  face and stood aside, her expression bleak now.    \"There's only King in there,\" she said. \"And I wish you the joy of him,  you thief!\"    King proved to be a stallion, stabled in a box stall. Drew hesitated.  The stud might be mean, harder to handle even than the gelding. But it  was either taking him or being put afoot. If he could back this one even  as far as Calhoun tomorrow--or the next day--he might be able to make a  better exchange in town. It would depend on just how hard the stallion  was to control.    Making soothing noises, he worked fast to bit and bridle the big  chestnut. His experience with the Red Springs stud led him aright now.  He came out of the barn leading the horse while the dog, its first  incessant clamor stilled, growled menacingly from the end of its chain.  The woman had disappeared, maybe into the fields beyond in search of  help. Drew departed at a swift trot to where he had left Boyd.    \"That's all horse!\" Boyd eyed Drew's trade excitedly.    \"Too much so, maybe. We'll see.\" He saddled quickly, glad that so far  the chestnut had proved amiable. But how the stud might behave in troop  company he had yet to learn. He mounted and waited for any signs of  resentment, remembering the woman's warning. King snorted, pawed the  dust a bit, but trotted on when Drew urged him.    Kirby whistled from where he rode with the rear guard as they rejoined  the company. But Captain Campbell frowned. And King put on a display of  fireworks which almost shook Drew out of the saddle, rearing and pawing  the air.    \"Makes like a horny one on the prod,\" commented the Texan. \"That's  stud's a lotta hoss to handle, amigo.\"    \"Too much,\" the captain echoed Drew's earlier misgivings. \"Keep him away  from the rest until you're sure he won't start anything!\"    But that order fitted in with Drew's usual scouting duties. And when he  did bed down for one of the fugitives' limited halts he was careful to  stake King away from the improvised picket lines.    Drew was eating a mixture of hardtack and cold bacon, the last of their  captured provision from Bardstown, when Driscoll sauntered over to the  small mess Kirby, Boyd, and Drew had established without any formal  agreement.    \"The boys are plannin' 'em a high old time,\" Driscoll announced.    Kirby's left eyebrow slanted up in quizzical inquiry. Drew chewed  energetically and swallowed. It was Boyd who asked, \"What do you mean?\"    \"Calhoun--that's what I mean, sonny.\" Driscoll squatted on his heels.  \"They 'low as how they're gonna do a little impressin' in Calhoun.\"    \"The town's not very big,\" Drew observed. \"A couple of stores, a church,  maybe a smithy....\"    Driscoll snickered. \"Oh, the boys ain't particular 'long 'bout now. They  won't be too choosy. Only thought I'd tell you fellas, seem' as how you  been ridin' scout and ain't maybe heard the plans. If you want to load  up, better git into town early. Some of them fast workers from B Company  are gittin' set....\"    \"The cap'n know about this?\" asked Kirby.    Driscoll shrugged. \"He ain't deaf. But the cap'n also knows as how you  can't be too big a gold-lace officer when you're behind the enemy lines  with men on the run. We're gonna take Calhoun and take her good!\" He  grinned at the two veterans. \"Jus' like we took Mount Sterlin'.\"    Kirby was sober. \"There was a take theah which warn't no good. Somebody  cleaned out the bank, or else I wasn't hearin' too well afterward. I can  see some impressin'--stuff an hombre can put in his belly as paddin',  an' maybe what he can put on his back. That's fair an' square. The  Yankees do it too.

'Indeed,' said Bunyip--      'I rather think they'll rather rue    The haste with which they sought to sue    Us, in the Court of Tooraloo.      For, mark how just is Fate!      'The whole benighted, blooming crew,    The Puddin'-thieves, the Usher too,    Are being beaten black and blue      With bottles on the pate.      'I rather think they will eschew,    In future, Puddin'-owners who    Pass through the simple rural view      About the town of Tooraloo.'    'And now,' said Bill, when they had run a mile or two beyond the town,  'and now for some brilliant plan, swiftly conceived, which will put a  stop to this Puddin'-snatchin' business for ever. For the point is,'  continued Bill, lowering his voice, 'here we are pretty close up to the  end of the book, and something will have to be done in a Tremendous  Hurry, or else we'll be cut off short by the cover.'    'The solution is perfectly simple,' said Bunyip. 'We have merely to stop  wandering along the road, and the story will stop wandering through the  book. This, too, will baffle the puddin'-thieves, for while we wander  along the road, our Puddin' is exposed to the covetous glances of every  passing puddin'-snatcher. Let us, then, remove to some safe, secluded  spot and settle down to a life of gaiety, dance, and song, where no  puddin'-thief will dare to show a sacrilegious head. Let us, in fact,  build a house in a tree. For, mark the advantages of such a habitation--      'Up on high    No neighbours pry      In at the window,    On the sly.      'Up in a tree    You're always free      From bores and bailiffs,    You'll agree.      'Up on high    Bricks you shy      At bores and bailiffs    Passing by.      'Up in the leaves    One never grieves      Over the pranks    Of puddin'-thieves.      'If you would be    Gay and free,      Take my tip and    Live in a tree.'    'We will, we will,' shouted the Puddin'-owners; but the Puddin' said  sourly: 'This is all very well, all this high falutin'. But what about  the dreadful news of being poisoned at ten-thirty this morning?'    'You ain't poisoned, Albert,' said Bill. 'That was only a mere _ruse de  guerre_, as they say in the noosepapers.'    'A what?' demanded the Puddin', suspiciously.    'Let words be sufficient, without explanation,' said Bill, severely.  'And as we haven't time to waste talkin' philosophy to a Puddin', why,  into the bag he goes, or we'll never get the story finished.'    So Puddin' was bundled into the bag, and Bill said, hurriedly:  'Brilliant as our friend Bunyip had proved himself with his ready wit,  it remains for old Bill to suggest the brightest idea of all. Here is  our friend Ben, a market gardener of the finest description. Very well.  Why not build our house in his market garden. The advantages are  obvious. Vegetables free of charge the whole year round, and fruit in  season. Eggs to be had for the askin', and a fine, simple, honest feller  like Ben, to chat to of an evening. What could be more delightful?'    Ben looked very grave at this proposal and began: 'I very much doubt  whether there will be enough bed clothes for four people, let alone the  carrots are very nervous of strangers--' when Bill cut him short with a  hearty clap on the back.    'Say no more,' said Bill, handsomely. 'Rough, good-humoured fellers like  us don't need apologies, or any social fal-lals at all. We'll take you  as we find you. Without more ado, we shall build a house in your market  garden.'    And, without more ado, they did.    The picture overleaf saves the trouble of explaining how they built it,  and what a splendid house it is. In order that the Puddin' might have  plenty of exercise, they made him a little Puddin' paddock, whence he  can shout rude remarks to the people passing by; a habit, I grieve to  state, he is very prone to.    [Illustration]    Of course, at night they pull up the ladder in case a stray  puddin'-thief happens to be prowling around. If a friend calls to have a  quiet chat, or to join in a sing-song round the fire, they let the  ladder down for him.    And a very pleasant life they lead, sitting of a summer evening on the  balcony while Ben does his little market-garden jobs below, and the  Puddin' throws bits of bark at the cabbages, and pulls faces at the  little pickle onions, in order to make them squeak with terror.    On winter nights there is always Puddin' and hot coffee for supper, and  many's the good go in I've had up there, a-sitting round the fire.    I didn't mean to let on that I knew their address, on account of so many  people wanting to have a go at the Puddin'. However, it's out now.    When the wind blows and the rain comes down, it's jolly sitting up aloft  in the snug tree-house, especially when old Bill is in good form and  gives us the _Salt Junk Sarah_, with all hands joining in the chorus.      'Oh, rolling round the ocean,      From a far and foreign land,    May suit the common notion      That a sailor's life is grand.      'But as for me, I'd sooner be      A-roaring here at home    About the rolling, roaring life      Of them that sails the foam.      'For the homeward-bounder's chorus,      Which he roars across the foam,    Is all about chucking a sailor's life,      And settling down at home.      'Home, home, home,      That's the song of them that roam,    The song of the roaring, rolling sea      Is all about rolling home.'"]]]
