Yet there is a third reality in man, the spiritual reality. Through its  medium one discovers spiritual revelations, a celestial faculty which is  infinite as regards the intellectual as well as physical realms. That  power is conferred upon man through the breath of the Holy Spirit. It is  an eternal reality, an indestructible reality, a reality belonging to the  divine, supernatural kingdom; a reality whereby the world is illumined, a  reality which grants unto man eternal life. This third, spiritual reality  it is which discovers past events and looks along the vistas of the  future. It is the ray of the Sun of Reality. The spiritual world is  enlightened through it, the whole of the Kingdom is being illumined by it.  It enjoys the world of beatitude, a world which had not beginning and  which shall have no end.    That celestial reality, the third reality of the microcosm, delivers man  from the material world. Its power causes man to escape from nature's  world. Escaping, he will find an illuminating reality, transcending the  limited reality of man and causing him to attain to the infinitude of God,  abstracting him from the world of superstitions and imaginations, and  submerging him in the sea of the rays of the Sun of Reality.    This fact is proved from scientific as well as spiritual evidence.    When we ponder over the conditions of phenomena, we observe that all  phenomena are composed of single elements. This singular cell-element  travels and has its coursings through all the grades of existence. I wish  you to ponder carefully over this. This cellular element has at some time  been in the mineral kingdom. While staying in the mineral kingdom it has  had its coursings and transformations through myriads of images and forms.  Having perfected its journey in the mineral kingdom, it has ascended to  the vegetable kingdom; and in the vegetable kingdom it has again had  journeys and transformations through myriads of conditions. Having  accomplished its functions in the vegetable kingdom, the cellular element  ascends to the animal kingdom.    In the animal kingdom again it goes through the composition of myriads of  images, and then we have it in the human kingdom. In the human kingdom  likewise it has its transformations and coursings through multitudes of  forms. In short, this single primordial atom has had its great journeys  through every stage of life, and in every stage it was endowed with a  special and particular virtue or characteristic.    Consequently, the great divine philosophers have had the following  epigram: All things are involved in all things. For every single  phenomenon has enjoyed the postulates of God, and in every form of these  infinite electrons it has had its characteristics of perfection.    Thus this flower once upon a time was of the soil. The animal eats the  flower or its fruit, and it thereby ascends to the animal kingdom. Man  eats the meat of the animal, and there you have its ascent into the human  kingdom, because all phenomena are divided into that which eats and that  which is eaten. Therefore, every primordial atom of these atoms, singly  and indivisible, has had its coursings throughout all the sentient  creation, going constantly into the aggregation of the various elements.  Hence do you have the conservation of energy and the infinity of  phenomena, the indestructibility of phenomena, changeless and immutable,  because life cannot suffer annihilation but only change.    The apparent annihilation is this: that the form, the outward image, goes  through all these changes and transformations. Let us again take the  example of this flower. The flower is indestructible. The only thing that  we can see, this outer form, is indeed destroyed, but the elements, the  indivisible elements which have gone into the composition of this flower  are eternal and changeless. Therefore the realities of all phenomena are  immutable. Extinction or mortality is nothing but the transformation of  pictures and images, so to speak--the reality back of these images is  eternal. And every reality of the realities is one of the bounties of God.    Some people believe that the divinity of God had a beginning. They say  that before this particular beginning man had no knowledge of the divinity  of God. With this principle they have limited the operation of the  influences of God.    For example, they think there was a time when man did not exist, and that  there will be a time in the future when man will not exist. Such a theory  circumscribes the power of God, because how can we understand the divinity  of God except through scientifically understanding the manifestations of  the attributes of God?    How can we understand the nature of fire except from its heat, its light?  Were not heat and light in this fire, naturally we could not say that the  fire existed.    Thus, if there was a time when God did not manifest His qualities, then  there was no God, because the attributes of God presuppose the creation of  phenomena. For example, by present consideration we say that God is the  creator. Then there must always have been a creation--since the quality of  creator cannot be limited to the moment when some man or men realize this  attribute. The attributes that we discover one by one--these attributes  themselves necessarily anticipated our discovery of them. Therefore, God  has no beginning and no ending; nor is His creation limited ever as to  degree. Limitations of time and degree pertain to things created, never to  the creation as a whole. They pertain to the forms of things, not to their  realities. The effulgence of God cannot be suspended. The sovereignty of  God cannot be interrupted.    As long as the sovereignty of God is immemorial, therefore the creation of  our world throughout infinity is presupposed. When we look at the reality  of this subject, we see that the bounties of God are infinite, without  beginning and without end.    The greatest bounties of God in this phenomenal world are His  Manifestations. This is the greatest postulate. These Manifestations are  the Suns of Reality. For it is through the Manifestation that the reality  becomes known and established for man. History proves to us that apart  from the influence of the Manifestations, man sinks back into his animal  condition, using even his intellectual power to subserve an animal  purpose. Therefore there is no cessation whatsoever in the future for the  appearance of the Manifestation of God, because God is infinite and His  purpose cannot be limited in any way. If we ever dare to limit and  circumscribe God's purpose within any bounds, then of necessity we have  dared to set limitations to the omnipotence of God. The created has dared  to define his Creator!    Consequently, the perfect man ever beholds the rays of the Sun of Truth.  The perfect man ever awaits and expects the coming of the effulgence of  God, he ever ponders over the methods and purposes of God, knowing that of  certainty the realities of the Divine are not finite, the Divine names and  attributes are not finite. God's graces and bounties are without limit,  and the coming of the Manifestations of God are not circumscribed by time.            THE UNIVERSAL CYCLES      Each one of the luminous bodies in this limitless firmament has a cycle of  revolution which is of a different duration, and every one revolves in its  own orbit, and again begins a new cycle. So the earth, every three hundred  and sixty-five days, five hours, forty-eight minutes and a fraction,  completes a revolution; and then it begins a new cycle, that is to say,  the first cycle is again renewed. In the same way, for the whole universe,  whether for the heavens or for men, there are cycles of great events, of  important facts and occurrences. When a cycle is ended, a new cycle  begins, and the old one, on account of the great events which take place,  is completely forgotten, and not a trace or record of it will remain. As  you see, we have no records of twenty thousand years ago, although we have  before proved by argument that life on this earth is very ancient. It is  not one hundred thousand, or two hundred thousand, or one million or two  million years old; it is very ancient, and the ancient records and traces  are entirely obliterated.    Each of the Divine Manifestations has likewise a cycle, and during the  cycle his laws and commandments prevail and are performed. When his cycle  is completed by the appearance of a new Manifestation, a new cycle begins.  In this way cycles begin, end, and are renewed, until a universal cycle is  completed in the world, when important events and great occurrences will  take place which entirely efface every trace and every record of the past;  then a new universal cycle begins in the world, for this universe has no  beginning. We have before stated proofs and evidences concerning this  subject; there is no need of repetition.    Briefly, we say a universal cycle in the world of existence signifies a  long duration of time, and innumerable and incalculable periods and  epochs. In such a cycle the Manifestations appear with splendor in the  realm of the visible, until a great and universal Manifestation makes the  world the center of his radiance. His appearance causes the world to  attain to maturity, and the extension of his cycle is very great.  Afterwards other Manifestations will arise under his shadow, who according  to the needs of the time will renew certain commandments relating to  material questions and affairs, while remaining under his shadow.    We are in the cycle which began with Adam, and its universal Manifestation  is Baha'u'llah.            EDUCATION      According to the statement of philosophers the difference in degree of  humankind from lowest to highest is due to education. The proofs they  advance are these: The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#12)"],[1,"lights are  revealed through them; its virtues become resplendent in them, but the Sun  of Reality never descends from its own highest point and station. This is  unity, oneness, sanctity; this is glorification whereby we praise and  adore God.          THE QUICKENING SPIRIT      The greatest power in the realm and range of human existence is  spirit,--the divine breath which animates and pervades all things. It is  manifested throughout creation in different degrees or kingdoms. In the  vegetable kingdom it is the spirit augmentative or power of growth, the  animus of life and development in plants, trees and organisms of the  floral world. In this degree of its manifestation, spirit is unconscious  of the powers which qualify the kingdom of the animal. The distinctive  virtue or plus of the animal is sense perception; it sees, hears, smells,  tastes and feels but is incapable in turn, of conscious ideation or  reflection which characterize and differentiate the human kingdom. The  animal neither exercises nor apprehends this distinctive human power and  gift. From the visible it cannot draw conclusions regarding the invisible  whereas the human mind from visible and known premises attains knowledge  of the unknown and invisible. For instance, Christopher Columbus from  information based upon known and provable facts drew conclusions which led  him unerringly across the vast ocean to the unknown continent of America.  Such power of accomplishment is beyond the range of animal intelligence.  Therefore this power is a distinctive attribute of the human spirit and  kingdom. The animal spirit cannot penetrate and discover the mysteries of  things. It is a captive of the senses. No amount of teaching, for  instance, would enable it to grasp the fact that the sun is stationary and  the earth moves around it. Likewise the human spirit has its limitations.  It cannot comprehend the phenomena of the kingdom transcending the human  station, for it is a captive of powers and life forces which have their  operation upon its own plane of existence and it cannot go beyond that  boundary.    There is however another spirit which may be termed the divine, to which  Jesus Christ refers when He declares that man must be born of its  quickening and baptized with its living fire. Souls deprived of that  spirit are accounted as dead, though they are possessed of the human  spirit. His Holiness Jesus Christ has pronounced them dead inasmuch as  they have no portion of the divine spirit. He says: \"Let the dead bury  their dead.\" In another instance He declares: \"That which is born of the  flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.\" By this  He means that souls though alive in the human kingdom are nevertheless  dead if devoid of this particular spirit of divine quickening. They have  not partaken of the divine life of the higher kingdom; for the soul which  partakes of the power of the divine spirit is verily living.    This quickening spirit has spontaneous emanation from the Sun of Truth,  from the reality of divinity and is not a revelation or a manifestation.  It is like the rays of the sun. The rays are emanations from the sun. This  does not mean that the sun has become divisible; that a part of the sun  has come out into space. This plant beside me has risen from the seed;  therefore it is a manifestation and unfoldment of the seed. The seed, as  you can see, has unfolded in manifestation and the result is this plant.  Every leaf of the plant is a part of the seed. But the reality of divinity  is indivisible and each individual of human kind cannot be a part of it as  is often claimed. Nay, rather, the individual realities of mankind when  spiritually born are emanations from the reality of divinity, just as the  flame, heat and light of the sun are the effulgence of the sun and not a  part of the sun itself. Therefore a spirit has emanated from the reality  of divinity, and its effulgences have become visible in human entities or  realities. This ray and this heat are permanent. There is no cessation in  the effulgence. As long as the sun exists the heat and light will exist,  and inasmuch as eternality is a property of divinity, this emanation is  everlasting. There is no cessation in its outpouring. The more the world  of humanity develops, the more the effulgences or emanations of divinity  will become revealed, just as the stone when it becomes polished and pure  as a mirror will reflect in fuller degree the glory and splendor of the  sun.    The mission of the prophets, the revelation of the holy books, the  manifestation of the heavenly teachers and the purpose of divine  philosophy all center in the training of the human realities so that they  may become clear and pure as mirrors and reflect the light and love of the  Sun of Reality. Therefore I hope that whether you be in the east or the  west you will strive with heart and soul in order that day by day the  world of humanity may become glorified, more spiritual, more sanctified;  and that the splendor of the Sun of Reality may be revealed fully in human  hearts as in a mirror. This is worthy of the world of mankind. This is the  true evolution and progress of humanity. This is the supreme bestowal.  Otherwise, by simple development along material lines man is not  perfected. At most, the physical aspect of man, his natural or material  conditions may become stabilized and improved but he will remain deprived  of the spiritual or divine bestowal. He is then like a body without a  spirit, a lamp without the light, an eye without the power of vision, an  ear that hears no sound, a mind incapable of perceiving, an intellect  minus the power of reason.    Man has two powers, and his development two aspects. One power is  connected with the material world and by it he is capable of material  advancement. The other power is spiritual and through its development his  inner, potential nature is awakened. These powers are like two wings. Both  must be developed, for flight is impossible with one wing. Praise be to  God! material advancement has been evident in the world but there is need  of spiritual advancement in like proportion. We must strive unceasingly  and without rest to accomplish the development of the spiritual nature in  man, and endeavor with tireless energy to advance humanity toward the  nobility of its true and intended station. For the body of man is  accidental; it is of no importance. The time of its disintegration will  inevitably come. But the spirit of man is essential and therefore eternal.  It is a divine bounty. It is the effulgence of the Sun of Reality and  therefore of greater importance than the physical body.          SPIRITUAL EXISTENCE IS IMMORTALITY      According to divine philosophy, there are two important and universal  conditions in the world of material phenomena; one which concerns life,  the other concerning death; one relative to existence, the other  non-existence; one manifest in composition, the other in decomposition.  Some define existence as the expression of reality or being, and  non-existence as non-being, imagining that death is annihilation. This is  a mistaken idea, for total annihilation is an impossibility. At most,  composition is ever subject to decomposition or disintegration; that is to  say, existence implies the grouping of material elements in a form or  body, and non-existence is simply the de-composing of these groupings.  This is the law of creation in its endless forms and infinite variety of  expression. Certain elements have formed the composite creature man. This  composite association of the elements in the form of a human body is  therefore subject to disintegration which we call death, but after  disintegration the elements themselves persist unchanged. Therefore total  annihilation is an impossibility, and existence can never become  non-existence. This would be equivalent to saying that light can become  darkness, which is manifestly untrue and impossible. As existence can  never become non-existence, there is no death for man; nay, rather, man is  everlasting and everliving. The rational proof of this is that the atoms  of the material elements are transferable from one form of existence to  another, from one degree and kingdom to another, lower or higher. For  example, an atom of the soil or dust of earth may traverse the kingdoms  from mineral to man by successive incorporations into the bodies of the  organisms of those kingdoms. At one time it enters into the formation of  the mineral or rock; it is then absorbed by the vegetable kingdom and  becomes a constituent of the body and fibre of a tree; again it is  appropriated by the animal, and at a still later period is found in the  body of man. Throughout these degrees of its traversing the kingdoms from  one form of phenomenal being to another, it retains its atomic existence  and is never annihilated nor relegated to non-existence.    Non-existence therefore is an expression applied to change of form, but  this transformation can never be rightly considered annihilation, for the  elements of composition are ever present and existent as we have seen in  the journey of the atom through successive kingdoms, unimpaired; hence  there is no death; life is everlasting. So to speak, when the atom entered  into the composition of the tree, it died to the mineral kingdom, and when  consumed by the animal, it died to the vegetable kingdom, and so on until  its transference or transmutation into the kingdom of man; but throughout  its traversing it was subject to transformation and not annihilation.  Death therefore is applicable to a change or transference from one degree  or condition to another. In the mineral realm there was a spirit of  existence; in the world of plant life and organisms it reappeared as the  vegetative spirit; thence it attained the animal spirit and finally  aspired to the human spirit. These are degrees"]]]
