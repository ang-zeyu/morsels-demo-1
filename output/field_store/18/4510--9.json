The flames of sedition, so  maliciously kindled in the past by those who have dared to flout His will,  are gone out for ever, and the fondest hopes of these evil plotters are  now abandoned, doomed never to revive. He has indeed redeemed His promise!    It seemed not a long time ago that their agitation, so violently renewed  immediately after the passing of our Beloved, would for a time confuse the  Divine Message of Baha'u'llah, obscure His Covenant, retard the progress  of His Cause, and shatter its unity; and yet how well we see them all  today, not through our efforts, but by their own folly, and above all, by  the intervention of the hidden hand of God, reduced to the vilest and most  humiliating position.    And now, with the Cause purified and inwardly victorious, its principles  vindicated, its enemies silenced and sunk in unspeakable misery, may we  not, henceforth, direct all our efforts to collective action and  constructive achievement, and, in utter disregard of the flickerings of  their fast-fading light, arise to carry out those urgent measures that  will secure the outward and complete triumph of the Cause.    I, for my part, as I look back to the unfortunate circumstances of  ill-health and physical exhaustion that have attended the opening years of  my career of service to the Cause, feel hardly gratified, and would be  truly despondent but for the sustaining memory and inspiring example of  the diligent and ceaseless efforts which my fellow-workers the world over  have displayed during these two trying years in the service of the Cause.    I cherish the hope that, from now on, the Beloved may bestow upon me all  the strength and vigor that will enable me to pursue over a long and  unbroken period of strenuous labor the supreme task of achieving, in  collaboration with the friends in every land, the speedy triumph of the  Cause of Baha'u'llah. This is the prayer I earnestly request all my  fellow-brethren and sisters in the Faith to offer on my behalf.    Let us pray to God that in these days of world-encircling gloom, when the  dark forces of nature, of hate, rebellion, anarchy and reaction are  threatening the very stability of human society, when the most precious  fruits of civilization are undergoing severe and unparalleled tests, we  may all realize, more profoundly than ever, that though but a mere handful  amidst the seething masses of the world, we are in this day the chosen  instruments of God's grace, that our mission is most urgent and vital to  the fate of humanity, and, fortified by these sentiments, arise to achieve  God's holy purpose for mankind.    Your brother in His Service,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine.  November 14, 1923.          Letter of November 26, 1923.      To the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.    Friends and fellow-workers in the Vineyard of God!    After a long and unbroken silence, it gives me the greatest joy to be  enabled to correspond again with my dearly-beloved co-workers of the  National Spiritual Assembly.    Your three letters, dated June 8th, July 10th and October 12th, have been  safely received, and to each I have given my earnest and fullest  attention. Their perusal which reflects only a certain amount of your  activities together with the study of the enclosed communications and  circulars and of the detailed and admirable report of the proceedings of  the Annual Convention have all served to heighten my admiration for the  thoroughness, the ability, and the devotion with which you are conducting  the affairs of the Cause of God in that land.    How often I have wished and yearned to be nearer to the field of your  activities and thus be able to keep in a more constant and closer touch  with every detail of the manifold and all-important services you render. I  cherish the hope that erelong the facilities in the means of communication  and transport will serve to draw us still nearer to one another, and  fulfill, though partially, this long-desired wish.          The Annual Convention      I have been made happy and grateful to learn from your first letter that  \"throughout the sessions (of the last Convention) the atmosphere was one  of great detachment and spirituality combined with practical vision and  purpose.\" I am deeply convinced that if the Annual Convention of the  friends in America, as well as the National Spiritual Assembly, desire to  become potent instruments for the speedy realization of the Beloved's  fondest hopes for the future of that country, they should endeavor, first  and foremost, to exemplify, in an increasing degree, to all Baha'is and to  the world at large the high ideals of fellowship and service which  Baha'u'llah and the beloved Master repeatedly set before them. They can  claim the admiration, the support and eventually the allegiance of their  fellow-countrymen only by their strict regard for the dignity, the  welfare, and the unity of the Cause of God, by their zeal, their  disinterestedness, and constancy in the service of mankind, and by  demonstrating, through their words and deeds, the need and practicability  of the lofty principles which the Movement has proclaimed to the world.    The efforts you have displayed, and the considerable success you have  achieved in consolidating the forces of the Movement in the United States  and Canada have been a source of inspiration to every one of us, and, I am  certain, will spur the friends throughout the East to combined and  sympathetic activity for the promotion of the Cause.    My fervent prayer at the three Holy Shrines is that the bountiful Lord may  bless His American friends who constitute the vanguard of His host in the  Western world, and prosper them in their material affairs and pursuits,  that the Cause which stands today in sore need of material help and  assistance may advance, rapidly and unhindered, towards the fulfillment of  its destiny.          The Baha'i Fund      With regard to the Baha'i Fund, recently established amongst the friends,  I trust that the matter now stands clear to every one throughout the  country. As I have previously intimated, although individual friends and  local Assemblies are absolutely free to specify the object and purpose of  their donations to the National Spiritual Assembly, yet, in my opinion, I  regard it of the utmost vital importance that individuals, as well as  local Assemblies, throughout the land should, in view of the paramount  importance of National Teaching and as an evidence of their absolute  confidence in their national representatives, endeavor, however small at  first, to contribute freely towards the upkeep and the increase of the  National Baha'i Fund, so that the members of the National Assembly may at  their full discretion expend it for whatever they deem urgent and  necessary.          The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar      Concerning the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, I shall always recall with pride and  gratitude the self-sacrifice of the American friends and, in particular  the devoted services of our dear Baha'i sister, Mrs. True, and our beloved  brethren, Dr. Bagdadi, Mr. Remey and Mr. Bourgeois, whose persistent  efforts and devoted services are in the eyes of all friends highly  praiseworthy. I would feel indeed disheartened were the friends to think  for a moment, that its work should fall into abeyance, nay, rather they  should do all in their power (and I trust their fellow-brethren and  sisters throughout the East may share in their stupendous efforts) to  provide for the steady and uninterrupted progress of the work, until the  day may come when this sublime Edifice, raised in its majestic splendor in  the very heart of the continent, may be yet another evidence of the  triumph and vitality of the Cause.    Your reference to the friends in Akron, Ohio, and their harmonious  participation in the proceedings of the Convention have rejoiced my heart,  for it has removed another obstacle in the way of the rapid and vigorous  development of the Cause in those regions.    The beneficent services and unremitting labors of that selfless and able  teacher of the Cause of God, Jinab-i-Fadil-i-Mazandarani, the details of  whose travels and activities I have followed with deep interest, have been  to me a constant source of hope and real encouragement, and my hope is  that the seeds he has so wisely sown may with your support yield in the  not distant future an abundant harvest.          Green Acre      I was delighted to hear of the progressive activities of that  dearly-beloved spot, Green Acre, upon which the Master has bestowed His  tender care and loving-kindness, and of which we are all hopeful that it  may become, while the work of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar is in progress,  the focal center of the devotional, humanitarian, social and spiritual  activities of the Cause. The sacrifice of the time, energy and money made  by our dearly beloved friends, Mr. and Mrs. Randall, Mr. and Mrs.  Schopflocher, and those who have helped them in their task, I shall never  forget, and will fervently pray on their behalf that our Beloved may  fulfill their heart's desire. I feel that no interference with its present  organization should be attempted, as it enjoys in its present condition  unique opportunities for the diffusion of the Baha'i spirit and the  promotion of the Word of God.    I am glad to report that the situation of the houses in Ba_gh_dad is free  from immediate danger, though the issue has not yet been definitely  determined. I wish in this respect to express my high admiration and deep  gratitude for the promptness, caution, and care with which you, and  particularly Mrs. Parsons and Mr. Mills, have approached and handled this  delicate question. I shall inform you of any future developments in this  matter.    With regard to the Star of the West, I have been impressed by the beauty  and force of the various"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19254"],[0,"Citadel of Faith (#12)"],[1,"allenging, so rich in their  potentialities, in the North American continent, must, whatever betide it,  be carried out, in their entirety and without the slightest reservation or  hesitation. The pledge to multiply the local administrative institutions,  throughout the length and breadth of this continent must be honored, and  the placing of the contract for the interior ornamentation of the holiest  House of Worship ever to be erected to the glory of Baha'u'llah expedited.  Above all a prodigious effort, nationwide, sustained and wholly  unprecedented in the annals of a richly endowed and spiritually blessed  community, aiming at the immediate increase of the financial resources  required for the effective prosecution of its manifold and pressing tasks,  is required.          TRIPLE CAMPAIGN OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE      The triple campaign, conducted in two hemispheres, comprising within the  scope of its operation the entire territory of the North American  republic, the Dominion of Canada, twenty republics of Latin America, and  no less than ten sovereign states of the European continent, is indeed of  critical importance. Every phase of this threefold crusade, undertaken at  the dawn of the second Baha'i century by the executors of 'Abdu'l-Baha's  Will and the custodians of His Plan, must be accorded its due measure of  consideration and its needs simultaneously and vigorously fulfilled. The  allurements of the glorious adventure in the Latin American field, the  glittering prizes already won and the new ones within reach, must, at no  time, obscure the issues, or retard the task confronting the prosecutors  of the Plan in their homeland, or allow the interests of its assemblies,  for the most part new and struggling, to be either neglected or forgotten.  Nor must the glamor of the still more recent and glorious adventure  embarked upon across the Atlantic, within a turbulent, politically  convulsed, economically disrupted and spiritually depleted continent, dim,  in however small a measure, the radiance, or detract from the urgency, of  the magnificent enterprises, whose first fruits in Latin America are only  beginning to mature, in direct consequence of the initial operation of the  Plan bequeathed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the American believers.    To the vital requirements of this Plan, at so critical a juncture, both in  the fortunes of mankind in general, and of the Plan itself, to which  detailed reference has been made in a previous communication, I need not  again refer. All I desire to emphasize is my fervent plea, addressed to  both the administrators who, as the elected representatives of the  community must devise the plans, coordinate the activities, and direct the  agencies of a continually expanding community, and to those whose  privilege it is to labor, at home and abroad, to insure the effective  prosecution of these sacred tasks, to realize the propitiousness of the  present hour, recognize its urgency, meet its challenge and appreciate its  unique potentialities. As the international situation worsens, as the  fortunes of mankind sink to a still lower ebb, the momentum of the Plan  must be further accelerated, and the concerted exertions of the community  responsible for its execution rise to still higher levels of consecration  and heroism. As the fabric of present-day society heaves and cracks under  the strain and stress of portentous events and calamities, as the  fissures, accentuating the cleavage separating nation from nation, class  from class, race from race, and creed from creed, multiply, the  prosecutors of the Plan must evince a still greater cohesion in their  spiritual lives and administrative activities, and demonstrate a higher  standard of concerted effort, of mutual assistance, and of harmonious  development in their collective enterprises.    Then, and only then, will the reaction to the stupendous forces, released  through the operation of a divinely conceived, divinely impelled Plan, be  made apparent, and the fairest fruit of the weightiest spiritual  enterprise launched in recorded history under the aegis of the Center of  the Covenant of Baha'u'llah be garnered.    [October 25, 1947]            RECOGNITION OF PREEMINENT SERVICES      Highly gratified at unceasing, compelling evidences of exalted spirit of  Baha'i stewardship animating American Baha'i Community, as attested by the  alacrity of its national representatives in executing the first Temple  contract, their promptitude in extending effective assistance to their  Persian brethren, their vigilance in safeguarding integrity of the Faith  in the City of the Covenant and their vigor in prosecuting the national  campaign of publicity.    In recognition of preeminent services continually enriching the record of  achievements associated with preeminent community of the Baha'i world, I  am arranging transfer of extensive, valuable property acquired in  precincts of Shrines on Mount Carmel to name of Palestine Branch of  American Assembly.    Happy to announce completion of plans and specifications for erection of  arcade surrounding the Bab's Sepulcher, constituting the first step in the  process destined to culminate in construction of the dome anticipated by  'Abdu'l-Baha and marking consummation of enterprise initiated by Him fifty  years ago according to instructions given Him by Baha'u'llah.    [December 15, 1947]            CRITICAL STAGE OF TASK ON HOME FRONT      I am deeply concerned at critical stage of task confronting North American  Teaching Committee, constituting at this juncture the paramount objective  of present Plan. Owing to urgent, overriding importance of Committee's  responsibility and to swiftly approaching time limit fixed for attainment  of the goal of one hundred seventy-five assemblies, emergency measures  carefully, promptly devised by national representatives of the community  and wholeheartedly supported by entire mass of the believers of the North  American continent, designed to safeguard the existing assemblies and  rapidly multiply their number, are imperative. The placing of further  contract for Temple, the reinforcement of basis of forthcoming Canadian  National Spiritual Assembly, the additional consolidation of the  institutions of the Faith in Latin America, the wider proclamation of its  message to the masses, even the multiplication of pioneers in the European  field, should be unhesitatingly subordinated to demands of the one  disconcerting aspect of an otherwise successfully conducted Plan. I  address this last-minute appeal to every single member of the community,  the champion warriors in the army of Baha'u'llah, which since launching  the Plan formulated by the Center of His Covenant never succumbed to  defeat nor was thwarted in its purpose, to arise resolutely, volunteer  instantly to fill the gap in the main defenses of the home front and  register total victory ere the termination of the second year of the  Second Seven Year Plan. Fervently praying for instantaneous, decisive  response.    [January 10, 1948]            NO SACRIFICE TOO GREAT      The gravity of the emergency facing the North American believers is  unprecedented since the initiation of the Divine Plan and unparalleled in  the history of the American Baha'i Community since 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing.  No obstacle is insuperable, no sacrifice too great for attainment of  supremely important objective. The eyes of her sister communities in every  continent of the globe and of her daughter communities of Latin America,  handicapped by a variety of adverse circumstances, are fixed upon the  community of followers of Baha'u'llah in North American continent who are  enjoying the blessings of internal peace, adequate resources,  administrative experience and organizing ability for their divinely  appointed mission, expecting them to arise and avert the reverse which  would mar the splendor of their record of unexampled stewardship. I am  moved to plead, at this eleventh hour, that the rank and file of the  community, particularly the members resident in long-established leading  strongholds of the Faith--New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco,  Washington--issue forth unhesitatingly, determinedly, sacrifice every  interest, assume positions in the forefront of the struggle and emulate in  the course of the first decade of second Baha'i century, opening years of  the second epoch of Formative Age of the Faith, exploits of their  spiritual progenitors, the dawn-breakers of the Heroic Age, which  immortalized the dawn of the first Baha'i century. The immediate fortunes  of the Plan are precariously hanging in the balance. The three months'  interval is swiftly running out. My heart aches at contemplation of the  possibility of failure of the stalwart community to rise to the heights of  the occasion. I refuse to believe that its members, invested with unique  apostolic mission of 'Abdu'l-Baha, will shrink from meeting the most  challenging requirement of the present hour.    [February 1, 1948]            PREVAILING CRISIS      Hope is welling up in my anxious, overburdened heart that the North  American Baha'i Community may yet emerge triumphant over the prevailing  crisis, demonstrate its capacity to preserve its hard-won prizes and  redeem its pledges through a further display of its qualities of  unconquerable faith, unbreakable solidarity, dauntless valor and heroic  self-sacrifice, and vindicate its right to primacy in the world community  of the followers of Baha'u'llah. High water mark is still unattained  notwithstanding the mounting tide of enthusiastic response displayed by an  aroused community. Dangerous passage now forded in this eleventh-hour  campaign. I am fervently praying that further intensification of effort,  sustained, coordinated, consecrated and unanimously exerted, will sweep  its members on crest of the wave to total victory. I feel assured that  cumulative efforts of"]]]
