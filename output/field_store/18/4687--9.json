When  the plate was bit in, the name was left out; it was afterwards added  with the dry point; also a little shading was given to the hat of one  of the figures on the bridge, which in the rare state is white. I may  notice here that it was also Rembrandt's practice to sketch with the dry  point alone, as several of his landscapes show; this has a very rich  and full effect. His most finished and striking landscape is perhaps the  etching of the \"Three Trees.\" What I have said respecting his giving  force to those parts nearest the eye, may be seen in the strong dark  under the platform of the mill--which etching I have given, as it has  always been considered the mill in which he was born; but I believe it  is merely a mill of a picturesque character, which he consequently  etched. In the rare impressions, the sky is much stained on the plate  towards the house and mill, and I believe intentionally so, as it  enables the subject to melt more softly into the background, by the  outline being less harsh; at least, I found in my copy, when the person  employed to clean the margin of the plate cleaned the stains in the sky  also, that I had to restore them. As it will be necessary to go over the  ground again with regard to Rembrandt's landscapes, when we enter upon  an investigation of his principles of colour, I shall now commence upon  that department, fully conscious how high he stands as an artist in that  difficult branch of the art, at the same time aware how feeble words  must be to express adequately the deep-toned richness of Rembrandt's  colouring.    [Illustration: SIX'S BRIDGE]    [Illustration: REMBRANDT'S MILL]          COLOUR.      Perhaps, if we can comprehend a species of coloured chiaro-scuro, or  the addition of colour to the broad and soft principles of light and  shade, we shall be able to form a clear perception of the effects of  Rembrandt's colouring. Indistinctness of tint, such as colours assume  under the influence of twilight, is a strong characteristic of his  manner--the shadows never so dark that a black or blue cannot tell  firmly in the midst of them; with the total absence of all harshness,  from the outlines of objects melting into their adjacent grounds,  or assuming an importance after emerging from a mass of indefinite  corresponding hues. As he has a mass of shadow with a mass of light, so  he has an accumulation of warm colours in opposition to a congregation  of cold--every combination introduced conducing to the great principles  of breadth. When such is the plan upon which a work is laid down, we can  easily perceive how powerfully the smallest touch of positive colour  will tell--as in the midst of stillness a pin falling to the ground  will be heard. Cuyp has this quality in a high degree, only on another  scale--a uniformity of unbroken tone, and in masses of half-tint  only, like a few sparkles of light touches, dealt out with the most  parsimonious pencil, producing a glitter like so many diamonds. This  it is that prevents a work from being heavy, for by their fewness they  require not the aid of black grounds to give them consequence, and by  their being touched upon colours of the same quality, they avoid the  appearance of harshness; in fact, the principles of these two great  artists were the same; only from the general tone of Cuyp's pictures  being light, his strong darks tell with great power, and Rembrandt's  half tints being of a low tone, his high lights become more forcible.  I may here mention not only the breadth of Rembrandt's shadows,  but their peculiar transparency and clearness, loose in the handling,  and filled with air and space, whereas his lights are solid and  firm--possessing not only the characteristics of nature in  distinctiveness, but also in variety; and though we see always, on a  general principle, light upon light and dark on a dark ground, yet we  perceive inroads made upon each by their several antagonists; hot and  cold colours darting into each other's provinces. This practice is also  conducive to breadth, for tints of different hues may be interspersed  both in the darks and lights, provided they are of equal strength  with those adjoining them. We may observe in Rembrandt--that those  colours introduced into the shadows are more under the influence of  indistinctness, while those in the light are brighter; this is quite  a deviation from the Roman school, where the colours are pronounced  so harshly as to set the influence of chiaro-scuro at defiance.    Barry, in his sixth lecture, speaking of colours, says--\"The happy  effects of those sure and infallible principles of light and colour  which Rubens had so successfully disseminated in the Netherlands, were  soon found in every department of art. Landscapes, portraits, drolls,  and even the dullest and most uninteresting objects of still life,  possess irresistible charms and fascination from the magic of those  principles. Rembrandt, who, it is said, was never at Venice, might,  notwithstanding, have seen, without going out of his country, many  pictures of the Venetian school. Besides, he was about thirty years  younger than Rubens, whose works were a general object of study when  Rembrandt was forming himself. But, however it be, there is no doubt,  for the colouring and chiaro-scuro, Rembrandt is one of the most able  artists that ever lived. Nothing can exceed the beauty, freshness, and  vigour of his tints. They have the same truth, high relish, and sapidity  as those of Titian. Indeed, they have the closest resemblance to the  hues of Titian when he had Giorgione most in view. There is identically  the same attention to the relievo and force obtained by his strong  shadows and low deep tones; and his chiaro-scuro, though sometimes  too artificial, is yet often (particularly in contrasted subjects)  productive of the most fascinating effects. In the tones of Rembrandt,  though we recognise the same richness and depth as in Giorgione and  Titian, yet there is a suppleness and lifelike character in his flesh  unlike either, both from his manner of handling, and also his hot and  cold tints being less blended.\"    The late Sir David Wilkie, in one of his letters, speaking of the death  of Sir Thomas Lawrence, says--\"I do not wonder at the impression made  among you in Rome by the death of Sir Thomas Lawrence; here, it  engrossed for a time every other pursuit. One of the last remarks he  made to me indicated his extreme admiration of Sir Joshua Reynolds, who,  he thought, had, with Rembrandt, carried the imitation of nature, in  regard to colours, further than any of the old masters.\" In many of the  higher qualities of colour and chiaro-scuro, Reynolds comes nearer to  Rembrandt than any other artist who has succeeded him.    Reynolds, in his lectures, speaking of Gainsborough, observes--\"We  must not forget, whilst we are on this subject, to make some remarks  on his custom of painting by night, which confirms what I have already  mentioned--his great affection to his art, since he could not amuse  himself in the evening by any other means so agreeable to himself. I am,  indeed, much inclined to believe that it is a practice very advantageous  and improving to an artist, for by this means he will acquire a new  and higher perception of what is great and beautiful in nature. By  candlelight, not only objects appear more beautiful, but from their  being in a greater breadth of light and shadow, as well as having a  greater breadth and uniformity of colour, nature appears in a higher  style, and even the flesh seems to take a higher and richer tone of  colour. Judgment is to direct us in the use to be made of this method of  study; but the method itself is, I am very sure, advantageous. I have  often imagined that the two great colourists, Titian and Coreggio,  though I do not know that they painted by night, formed their high  ideas of colouring from the effects of objects by this artificial light.  But I am more assured that whoever attentively studies the first and  best manner of Guercino will be convinced that he either painted by this  light, or formed his manner on this conception.\"    How far Coreggio may have formed his principles upon the effects of  lamplight it is impossible to decide, seeing that, though his shadows  have great breadth, yet his lights have more of a phosphorescent  character, tinged, as it were, with the coolness of moonlight; but  Titian has all the glow of this property, or, as Reynolds remarks, \"as  if he painted with the sun shining into the room.\" The Italian pictures  of Vandyke have much of this phosphorescent character--whereas many of  those he painted in England have more of a daylight appearance. With  regard to Rembrandt, he seems to have regulated the entire scheme both  of his chiaro-scuro and colour, on this foundation: his many paintings,  drawings, and etchings of candlelight subjects, show how much his taste  led to this class of art; and his daylight pictures, from the warmth of  colour and breadth of shadow, proclaim the source from which he derived  the cause of their brilliancy and force. From the light being tinged  with yellow, the half-tone partakes of the same warmth, which gives a  greenish tint even to his grey tones. This conduct conveys an emanation  of the principal light passing over the more delicate shadows. In his  daylight subjects it is not so; the light being often comparatively  cool, is allowed to extend its influence to the secondary lights, and  then, as it subsides into the shadow, is led in by the dark being  lighted up by touches of red and brown; thus the light touches in the  dark are warm, though the high light and secondary are cool.

And again she  thought, \"I shall atone.\" And so, when day was come, she took her way  along the weary road that leads to that dark place from whence no  traveller can ever hope to return, and still with gladness in her  heart. But, as she went onward, \"cold thoughts and dreadful fears\"  came to her.    \"Better were it for me to hasten my journey to the shades,\" she  thought.    And when she came to an old grey tower, that seemed like an old man  that Death has forgotten, she resolved to throw herself down from it,  and thus swiftly to find herself at her journey's end. But as she  stood on the top of the tower, her arms outstretched, like a white  butterfly that poises its wings for flight, a voice spoke in her ear.    \"Oh, foolish one,\" it said, \"why dost thou strive to stay the hope  that is not dead?\" And while she held her breath, her great eyes wide  open, the voice spoke on, and told her by what means she might  speedily reach Hades and there find means to face with courage the  King of Darkness himself and his fair wife, Proserpine.    All that she was bidden to do, Psyche did, and so at last did she  come before the throne of Proserpine, and all that Psyche endured, all  that she saw, all that through which she came with bleeding heart and  yet with unscathed soul, cannot here be written.    To her Proserpine gave the box of precious ointment that Aphrodite  described, and gladly she hastened homeward. Good, indeed, it was to  her when again she reached the fair light of day. Yet, when she had  won there, there came to Psyche a winged thought, that beat against  the stern barriers of her mind like a little moth against a window.    \"This ointment that I carry with me,\" said Psyche to herself, \"is an  ointment that will bring back to those all faded by time, or worn by  suffering, a beauty greater than any beauty that has joyed the  Immortals!\" And then she thought:    \"For my beauty, Eros--_Love_--loved me; and now my beauty is worn and  wasted and well-nigh gone. Were I to open this box and make use of the  ointment of Proserpine, then indeed I should be fair enough to be the  bride of him who, even now, believes that he loves me--of Eros whose  love is my life!\"    So it came to pass that she opened the fateful box. And out of it  there came not Beauty, but Sleep, that put his gyves upon her limbs,  and on her eyelids laid heavy fingers. And Psyche sank down by the  wayside, the prisoner of Sleep.    But Eros, who had loved her ever, with a love that knew the ebb and  flow of no tides, rose from his bed and went in search of her who had  braved even the horrors of Hades for his dear sake. And by the wayside  he found her, fettered by sleep. Her little oval face was white as a  snowdrop. Like violets were her heavy eyelids, and underneath her  sleeping eyes a violet shadow lay. Once had her mouth been as the bow  of Eros, painted in carmine. Now either end of the bow was turned  downwards, and its colour was that of a faded rose-leaf.    And as Eros looked at her that he loved, pity stirred his heart, as  the wind sweeps through the sighing, grey leaves of the willow, or  sings through the bowing reeds.    \"My _Beloved_!\" he said, and he knew that Psyche was indeed his  beloved. It was her fair soul that he loved, nor did it matter to him  whether her body was like a rose in June or as a wind-scourged tree in  December. And as his lips met hers, Psyche awoke, and heard his soft  whisper:                   \"Dear, unclose thine eyes.      Thou mayst look on me now. I go no more,      But am thine own forever.\"            Lewis Morris.    Then did there spring from the fair white shoulders of Psyche, wings  of silver and of gold, and, hand in hand with Eros, she winged her way  to Olympus.    And there all the deathless gods were assembled, and Aphrodite no  longer looked upon her who had once been her slave with darkened  brows, but smiled upon her as the sun smiles upon a new-born flower.  And when into the hand of Psyche there was placed a cup of gold, the  voice of the great Father and King of Olympus rang out loud and clear:        \"Drink now, O beautiful, and have no fear!      For with this draught shalt thou be born again,      And live for ever free from care and pain.\"            William Morris.    In this wise did Psyche, a human soul, attain by bitter suffering to  the perfect happiness of purified love.    And still do we watch the butterfly, which is her emblem, bursting  from its ugly tomb in the dark soil, and spreading joyous white and  gold-powdered wings in the caressing sunshine, amidst the radiance and  the fragrance of the summer flowers. Still, too, do we sadly watch her  sister, the white moth, heedlessly rushing into pangs unutterable,  thoughtlessly seeking the anguish that brings her a cruel death.          THE CALYDONIAN HUNT      OEneus and Althaea were king and queen of Calydon, and to them was  born a son who was his mother's joy and yet her bitterest sorrow.  Meleager was his name, and ere his birth his mother dreamed a dream  that the child that she bore was a burning firebrand. But when the  baby came he was a royal child indeed, a little fearless king from the  first moment that his eyes, like unseeing violets, gazed steadily up  at his mother. To the chamber where he lay by his mother's side came  the three Fates, spinning, ceaselessly spinning.    \"He shall be strong,\" said one, as she span her thread. \"He shall be  fortunate and brave,\" said the second. But the third laid a billet of  wood on the flames, and while her withered fingers held the fatal  threads, she looked with old, old, sad eyes at the new-born child.    \"To thee, O New-Born,\" she said, \"and to this wood that burns, do we  give the same span of days to live.\"    From her bed sprang Althaea, and, heedless of the flames, she seized  the burning wood, trod on it with her fair white feet, and poured on  it water that swiftly quenched its red glow. \"Thou shalt live forever,  O Beloved,\" she said, \"for never again shall fire char the brand that  I have plucked from the burning.\"    And the baby laughed.        \"Those grey women with bound hair      Who fright the gods frighted not him; he laughed      Seeing them, and pushed out hands to feel and haul      Distaff and thread.\"    The years sped on, and from fearless and beautiful babyhood, Meleager  grew into gallant boyhood, and then into magnificent youth. When Jason  and his heroes sailed away into a distant land to win the Golden  Fleece, Meleager was one of the noble band. From all men living he won  great praise for his brave deeds, and when the tribes of the north and  west made war upon AEtolia, he fought against their army and scattered  it as a wind in autumn drives the fallen leaves before it.    But his victory brought evil upon him. When his father OEneus, at  the end of a fruitful year, offered sacrifices to the gods, he omitted  to honour the goddess Diana by sacrificing to her, and to punish his  neglect, she had sent this destroying army. When Meleager was victor,  her wrath against his father grew yet more hot, and she sent a wild  boar, large as the bulls of Epirus, and fierce and savage to kill and  to devour, that it might ravage and lay waste the land of Calydon. The  fields of corn were trampled under foot, the vineyards laid waste, and  the olive groves wrecked as by a winter hurricane. Flocks and herds  were slaughtered by it, or driven hither and thither in wild panic,  working havoc as they fled. Many went out to slay it, but went only to  find a hideous death. Then did Meleager resolve that he would rid the  land of this monster, and called on all his friends, the heroes of  Greece, to come to his aid. Theseus and his friend Pirithous came;  Jason; Peleus, afterwards father of Achilles; Telamon, the father of  Ajax; Nestor, then but a youth; Castor and Pollux, and Toxeus and  Plexippus, the brothers of Althaea, the fair queen-mother. But there  came none more fearless nor more ready to fight the monster boar of  Calydon than Atalanta, the daughter of the king of Arcadia. When  Atalanta was born, her father heard of her birth with anger. He  desired no daughter, but only sturdy sons who might fight for him, and  in the furious rage of bitter disappointment he had the baby princess  left on the Parthenian Hill that she might perish there. A she-bear  heard the baby's piteous cries, and carried it off to its lair, where  she suckled it along with her young, and there the little Atalanta  tumbled about and played with her furry companions and grew strong and  vigorous as any other wild young creature of the forest.    Some hunters came one day to raid the den and kill the foster-mother,  and found, amazed, a fearless, white-skinned thing with rosy cheeks  and brave eyes, who fought for her life and bit them as did her fierce  foster-brothers, and then cried human tears of rage and sorrow when  she saw the bear who had been her mother lying bloody and dead. Under  the care of the hunters Atalanta grew into a maiden, with all the  beauty of a maid and all the strength and the courage of a man. She  ran as swiftly as Zephyrus runs when he rushes up from the west and  drives the white clouds before him like a flock of timid fawns that a  hound is pursuing. The shafts that her strong arm sped from her bow  smote straight to the heart of the beast that she chased, and almost  as swift as her arrow was she there to drive her spear into her  quarry. When at length her father the king learned that the beautiful  huntress, of whom all men spoke as of one only a little lower than  Diana, was none other than his daughter, he was not slow to own her as  his child. So proud was he of her beauty and grace, and of her  marvellous swiftness of foot and skill in the chase, that he would  fain have married her to one of the great ones of Greece, but Atalanta  had consulted an oracle. \"M"]]]
