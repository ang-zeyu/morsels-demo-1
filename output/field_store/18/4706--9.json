From thirty to forty horses may be driven very well in this  manner, and, if they are wild, it is perhaps the safest method, except  that of leading them with halters held by men riding beside them. The  rope to which the horses are attached should be about an inch and a  quarter in diameter, with loops or rings inserted at intervals  sufficient to admit the horses without allowing them to kick each  other, and the halter straps tied to these loops. The horses, on first  starting, should have men by their sides, to accustom them to this  manner of being led. The wagons should be so driven as to keep the rope  continually stretched. Good drivers must be assigned to these wagons,  who will constantly watch the movements of the horses attached, as well  as their own teams.    I have had 150 loose horses driven by ten mounted herdsmen. This  requires great care for some considerable time, until the horses become  gentle and accustomed to their herders. It is important to ascertain,  as soon as possible after starting, which horses are wild, and may be  likely to stampede and lead off the herd; such should be led, and never  suffered to run loose, either on the march or in camp. Animals of this  character will soon indicate their propensities, and can be secured  during the first days of the march. It is desirable that all animals  that will not stampede when not working should run loose on a march, as  they pick up a good deal of grass along the road when traveling, and  the success of an expedition, when animals get no other forage but  grass, depends in a great degree upon the time given them for grazing.  They will thrive much better when allowed a free range than when  picketed, as they then are at liberty to select such grass as suits  them. It may therefore be set down as an infallible rule never to be  departed from, that all animals, excepting such as will be likely to  stampede, should be turned loose for grazing immediately after arriving  at the camping-place; but it is equally important that they should be  carefully herded as near the camp as good grass will admit; and those  that it is necessary to picket should be placed upon the best grass,  and their places changed often. The ropes to which they are attached  should be about forty feet long; the picket-pins, of iron, fifteen  inches long, with ring and swivel at top, so that the rope shall not  twist as the animal feeds around it; and the pins must be firmly driven  into tenacious earth.    Animals should be herded during the day at such distances as to leave  sufficient grass undisturbed around and near the camp for grazing  through the night.      METHOD OF MARCHING.    Among men of limited experience in frontier life will be found a great  diversity of opinion regarding the best methods of marching, and of  treating animals in expeditions upon the prairies. Some will make late  starts and travel during the heat of the day without nooning, while  others will start early and make two marches, laying by during the  middle of the day; some will picket their animals continually in camp,  while others will herd them day and night, etc., etc. For mounted  troops, or, indeed, for any body of men traveling with horses and  mules, a few general rules may be specified which have the sanction of  mature experience, and a deviation from them will inevitably result in  consequences highly detrimental to the best interests of an expedition.    In ordinary marches through a country where grass and water are  abundant and good, animals receiving proper attention should not fall  away, even if they receive no grain; and, as I said before, they should  not be made to travel faster than a walk unless absolutely necessary;  neither should they be taken off the road for the purpose of hunting or  chasing buffalo, as one buffalo-chase injures them more than a week of  moderate riding. In the vicinity of hostile Indians, the animals must  be carefully herded and guarded within protection of the camp, while  those picketed should be changed as often as the grass is eaten off  within the circle described by the tether-rope. At night they should be  brought within the chain of sentinels and picketed as compactly as is  consistent with the space needed for grazing, and under no  circumstances, unless the Indians are known to be near and an attack is  to be expected, should they be tied up to a picket line where they can  get no grass. Unless allowed to graze at night they will fall away  rapidly, and soon become unserviceable. It is much better to march  after nightfall, turn some distance off the road, and to encamp without  fires in a depressed locality where the Indians can not track the  party, and the animals may be picketed without danger.    In descending abrupt hills and mountains one wheel of a loaded wagon  should always be locked, as this relieves the wheel animals and makes  every thing more secure. When the declivity is great both rear wheels  should be locked, and if very abrupt, requiring great effort on the  wheel animals to hold the wagon, the wheels should be rough-locked by  lengthening the lock-chains so that the part which goes around the  wheels will come directly upon the ground, and thus create more  friction. Occasionally, however, hills are met with so nearly  perpendicular that it becomes necessary to attach ropes to the rear  axle, and to station men to hold back upon them and steady the vehicle  down the descent. Rough-locking is a very safe method of passing heavy  artillery down abrupt declivities. There are several mountains between  the Missouri River and California where it is necessary to resort to  one of the two last-mentioned methods in order to descend with  security. If there are no lock-chains upon wagons, the front and rear  wheels on the same side may be tied together with ropes so as to lock  them very firmly.    It is an old and well-established custom among men experienced in  frontier life always to cross a stream upon which it is intended to  encamp for the night, and this rule should never be departed from where  a stream is to be forded, as a rise during the night might detain the  traveler for several days in awaiting the fall of the waters.      STORMS.    In Western Texas, during the autumn and winter months, storms arise  very suddenly, and, when accompanied by a north wind, are very severe  upon men and animals; indeed, they are sometimes so terrific as to make  it necessary for travelers to hasten to the nearest sheltered place to  save the lives of their animals. When these storms come from the north,  they are called \"_northers;_\" and as, during the winter season, the  temperature often undergoes a sudden change of many degrees at the time  the storm sets in, the perspiration is checked, and the system receives  an instantaneous shock, against which it requires great vital energy to  bear up. Men and animals are not, in this mild climate, prepared for  these capricious meteoric revolutions, and they not unfrequently perish  under their effects.    While passing near the head waters of the Colorado in October, 1849, I  left one of my camps at an early hour in the morning under a mild and  soft atmosphere, with a gentle breeze from the south, but had marched  only a short distance when the wind suddenly whipped around into the  north, bringing with it a furious chilling rain, and in a short time  the road became so soft and heavy as to make the labor of pulling the  wagons over it very exhausting upon the mules, and they came into camp  in a profuse sweat, with the rain pouring down in torrents upon them.    They were turned out of harness into the most sheltered place that  could be found; but, instead of eating, as was their custom, they  turned their heads from the wind, and remained in that position,  chilled and trembling, without making the least effort to move. The  rain continued with unabated fury during the entire day and night, and  on the following morning thirty-five out of one hundred and ten mules  had perished, while those remaining could hardly be said to have had a  spark of vitality left. They were drawn up with the cold, and could  with difficulty walk. Tents and wagon-covers were cut up to protect  them, and they were then driven about for some time, until a little  vital energy was restored, after which they commenced eating grass, but  it was three or four days before they recovered sufficiently to resume  the march.    The mistake I made was in driving the mules after the \"norther\"  commenced. Had I gone immediately into camp, before they became heated  and wearied, they would probably have eaten the grass, and this, I have  no doubt, would have saved them; but as it was, their blood became  heated from overwork, and the sudden chill brought on a reaction which  proved fatal. If an animal will eat his forage plentifully, there is  but little danger of his perishing with cold. This I assert with much  confidence, as I once, when traveling with about 1500 horses and mules,  encountered the most terrific snow-storm that has been known within the  memory of the oldest mountaineers. It commenced on the last day of  April, and continued without cessation for sixty consecutive hours. The  day had been mild and pleasant; the green grass was about six inches  high; the trees had put out their new leaves, and all nature conspired  to show that the sombre garb of winter had been permanently superseded  by the smiling attire of spring. About dark, however, the wind turned  into the north; it commenced to snow violently, and increased until it  became a frightful tempest, filling the atmosphere with a dense cloud  of driving snow, against which it was impossible to ride or walk. Soon  after the storm set in, one herd of three hundred horses and mules  broke away from the herdsmen who were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23186"],[0,"The Handbook to English Heraldry (#12)"],[1,"to _every plain surface_. A Shield is said to be  \"borne\" by the personage to whom it belongs: and, in its turn, the  Shield \"bears\" whatever figures and devices may be displayed upon it;  whence, all these figures and devices are entitled \"_Bearings_\" or  \"_Armorial Bearings_.\" All figures and devices are also styled  \"_Charges_\"; and they are said to be \"_charged_\" upon a Shield, Banner,  or Surcoat, or upon one another. In blazoning, the field of the Shield  is always first noticed and described: next follow the charges that rest  upon the field of the Shield itself; then descriptions are given of the  secondary bearings that are charged upon others of greater importance.  As a general rule, of several charges which all alike rest immediately  upon the field of the Shield, the most important is the first to be  blazoned; so that the arrangement of blazoning is determined by the  comparative dignity of the bearings, as well as by the degree in which  charges are nearer to the field and further from beholders. In some  cases, however, a bearing charged upon the field of a Shield and many  times repeated on a small scale, is blazoned (for the sake of simplicity  and clearness of expression) next to the field of the Shield  itself:--thus, if a lion be charged on the field of a Shield, and a  considerable number of crosses surround the lion, and, like him, are  placed on the field of the Shield also--the field of the Shield is  blazoned first, the crosses second, and the lion third; and, if a  crescent (or other bearing) be charged upon the lion's shoulder, it is  the last in the blazon. In quartered Shields the blazoning commences  afresh with each quartering. In blazoning armorial banners and  horse-trappings, the latter often gorgeously enriched with heraldic  blazonry, the dexter side of a flag is always next to the staff, and the  head of a horse is supposed always to be looking towards the dexter.          CHAPTER V    THE GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY    SECTION II      _The Tinctures' Metals-- Colours-- Furs-- Varied Fields-- Law of    Tinctures-- Counterchanging-- Diaper-- Disposition-- Blazoning in    Tinctures._      \"All the devices blazoned on the Shield    In their own tinct\"      --ELAINE.      In English Heraldry the TINCTURES comprise _Two Metals_, _Five Colours_,  and _Eight Furs_. They are symbolised or indicated by dots and lines--a  very convenient system, said to have been introduced, about the year  1630, by an Italian named Silvestre de Petrasancta. Some such  symbolisation, however, may occasionally be found in anticipation of  Petrasancta. The system now in use was not generally adopted till the  commencement of the eighteenth century. This system is never officially  employed in a matter of record, and is now being discarded by many  artists. The Metals, Colours, and Furs are named, their names are  abbreviated, and they are severally indicated, as follows:--      [Illustration: No. 50.]      [Illustration: No. 51.]      [Illustration: No. 52.]      [Illustration: No. 53.]      [Illustration: No. 54.]      [Illustration: No. 55.]      [Illustration: No. 56.]    TWO METALS.

TITLES      1. _Ermine_,--black spots on white                      No. 57.    2. _Ermines_,--white spots on black                     No. 58.    3. _Erminois_,--black spots on gold                     No. 59.    4. _Pean_,--gold spots on black                         No. 60.    5. _Vair_,--alternate divisions of blue and white, Nos. 61, 62.    6. _Counter Vair_ (note difference of arrangement)      No. 63.    7. _Potent_ (note different shape of divisions)         No. 64.    8. _Counter Potent_                                     No. 65.    Two other Colours, or tints of Colour, are sometimes heard of--_Tenne_,  a tawny or orange colour, indicated by vertical lines crossing those of  _Purpure_: and _Murrey_ or _Sanguine_, a dark crimson red, indicated by  diagonal lines from both dexter and sinister, crossing each other. These  two are sometimes termed stains, but their real usage was in liveries.  The Furs, Nos. 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, and 65, are of comparatively rare  occurrence, and do not appear in the best ages of Heraldry. _Vair_ and  _Ermine_ are common. A good early form of _Vair_ is shown in No. 62: and  in No. 57A, I give a fine example of the treatment of _Ermine_, from the  monument of EDWARD III.      [Illustration: No. 57A.]    In order to avoid repeating or referring to the word \"_Or_,\" the word  \"_Gold_\" is sometimes used. The Furs, Nos. 61, 62, 63, 64, and 65, are  always _argent_ and _azure_, unless some other metal and colour be named  in the blazoning. Animated beings and all objects, that in Heraldry are  represented in their natural aspect and colouring, are blazoned  \"_proper_\" abbreviated _ppr._ Heraldic charges and compositions, when  sketched in outline with pen and ink or with pencil, and with the  colours _written_ thereon, are said to be \"_tricked_,\" or \"_in trick_.\"    VARIED FIELDS.--It is not necessary that the Field of a Shield, or of  any Bearing, should be of any one uniform tincture: but varied surfaces  are usually tinctured of some one metal and some one colour alternating;  and the patterns or devices thus produced are generally derived (the  Furs, Nos. 61-65, which are good examples of varied surfaces, being the  exceptions) from the forms of the original simple charges that are  distinguished as _Ordinaries_ and _Subordinaries._ And these varied  surfaces or fields are always _flat_; the whole of their devices or  patterns are _level_, their metal and colour lying in the same plane. It  is evident that, in representing any examples of this class, no shading  is to be introduced to denote relief.      [Illustration: No. 66.]      [Illustration: No. 67.]    Should the field of any charge be divided into a single row of small  squares, alternately, _e.g._ of a metal and a colour, as No. 66, it is  _Componée_ or _Compony_ (sometimes written _gobony_): if into two such  rows, as in No. 67, it is _Counter Compony_: but, if the field of a  Shield, or the surface of any charge be divided into three, or more than  three, such rows, it is _Chequée_ or _Checky_; thus, the Arms of the  Earl de WARENNE are _Chequée or and az._, No. 68 (H. 3 and E. 2).    THE LAW OF TINCTURES.--Every charge is supposed to rest upon the field  of a Shield, or on the surface of some charge. It is a strict rule, that  a charge of a metal must rest upon a field that is of a colour or fur;  or, contrariwise, that a charge of a colour must rest on a field that is  of a metal or fur,--that is, that _metal be not on metal, nor colour on  colour_. This rule is modified in the case of _varied fields_, upon  which may be charged a bearing of either a metal or a colour: also,  a partial relaxation of the rule is conceded when one bearing is charged  upon another, should the conditions of any particular case require such  a concession. This rule does not apply to bordures, nor very stringently  to augmentations or crests, and it is not so rigidly enforced in Foreign  as in British Heraldry. There are, of course, a few exceptions, but they  are not numerous, the one usually instanced as an intentional violation  being the _silver_ armorial Shield of the CRUSADER KINGS of JERUSALEM,  No. 69, upon which _five golden crosses_ are charged; the motive in this  remarkable exception to an established rule being said to be to cause  this Shield to be unlike that of any other potentate. What may be termed  the accessories of a charge are not included in this law of tinctures:  thus, a silver lion having a red tongue may be charged on a blue shield,  and the red tongue may rest on the blue field of the Shield.      [Illustration: No. 69.--Arms of Jerusalem.]      [Illustration: No. 70.--Arms of Fenwick.]    COUNTERCHANGING is dividing the field of a Shield in such a manner that  it is, _e.g._ in part of a metal and in part of a colour, and then  arranging the charges in such a manner that they shall be reciprocally  of the same colour and metal: thus, the shield of John Fenwick, No. 70  (R. 2) is,--_per-fesse gu. and arg., six martlets, three, two, one,  counterchanged_; that is, the field is red in chief and silver in base,  and the birds or parts of the birds on the red field are silver, and  those on the silver field are red.    DIAPERING.--This term denotes a system of decorating plain surfaces in  various ways, which was in great favour with the early heraldic artists.  In the use of Diaper, which is often desirable when artistic reasons  suggest its suitability, care must be taken that the decorative designs  and patterns do not in any way admit of their being mistaken for  charges. This diaper may be executed in low relief, subordinated to the  relief of the charges; and it is not required to yield any obedience to  the law of tinctures. In the Shield, No. 68 (the original, a very noble  shield, is at Castle Acre Priory, Norfolk), which is simply _chequée_,  the Diapering may be alternately azure and or on the squares that are  alternately or and azure; or"]]]
