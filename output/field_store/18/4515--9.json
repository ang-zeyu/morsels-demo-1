Consider then, how all the  peoples of the world are bowing the knee to a fancy of their own  contriving, how they have created a creator within their own minds, and  they call it the Fashioner of all that is--whereas in truth it is but an  illusion. Thus are the people worshipping only an error of perception.    But that Essence of Essences, that Invisible of Invisibles, is sanctified  above all human speculation, and never to be overtaken by the mind of man.  Never shall that immemorial Reality lodge within the compass of a  contingent being. His is another realm, and of that realm no understanding  can be won. No access can be gained thereto; all entry is forbidden there.  The utmost one can say is that Its existence can be proved, but the  conditions of Its existence are unknown.    That such an Essence doth exist, the philosophers and learned doctors one  and all have understood; but whenever they tried to learn something of Its  being, they were left bewildered and dismayed, and at the end, despairing,  their hopes in ruins, they went their way, out of this life. For to  comprehend the state and the inner mystery of that Essence of Essences,  that Most Secret of Secrets, one needs must have another power and other  faculties; and such a power, such faculties would be more than humankind  can bear, wherefore no word of Him can come to them.    If, for example, one be endowed with the senses of hearing, of taste, of  smell, of touch--but be deprived of the sense of sight, it will not be  possible for one to gaze about; for sight cannot be realized through  hearing or tasting, or the sense of smell or touch. In the same way, with  the faculties at man's disposal it is beyond the realm of possibility for  him to grasp that unseeable Reality, holy and sanctified above all the  sceptics' doubts. For this, other faculties are required, other senses;  should such powers become available to him, then could a human being  receive some knowledge of that world; otherwise, never.            25: O THOU HANDMAID OF GOD! IT IS RECORDED IN EASTERN ...      O thou handmaid of God! It is recorded in eastern histories that Socrates  journeyed to Palestine and Syria and there, from men learned in the things  of God, acquired certain spiritual truths; that when he returned to  Greece, he promulgated two beliefs: one, the unity of God, and the other,  the immortality of the soul after its separation from the body; that these  concepts, so foreign to their thought, raised a great commotion among the  Greeks, until in the end they gave him poison and killed him.    And this is authentic; for the Greeks believed in many gods, and Socrates  established the fact that God is one, which obviously was in conflict with  Greek beliefs.    The Founder of monotheism was Abraham; it is to Him that this concept can  be traced, and the belief was current among the Children of Israel, even  in the days of Socrates.    The above, however, cannot be found in the Jewish histories; there are  many facts which are not included in Jewish history. Not all the events of  the life of Christ are set forth in the history of Josephus, a Jew,  although it was he who wrote the history of the times of Christ. One may  not, therefore, refuse to believe in events of Christ's day on the grounds  that they are not to be found in the history of Josephus.    Eastern histories also state that Hippocrates sojourned for a long time in  the town of Tyre, and this is a city in Syria.            26: O THOU WHO SEEKEST THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN! THY ...      O thou who seekest the Kingdom of Heaven! Thy letter hath been received  and its contents noted.    The Holy Manifestations of God possess two stations: one is the physical  station, and one the spiritual. In other words, one station is that of a  human being, and one, of the Divine Reality. If the Manifestations are  subjected to tests, it is in Their human station only, not in the  splendour of Their Divine Reality.    And further, these tests are such only from the viewpoint of mankind. That  is, to outward seeming, the human condition of the Holy Manifestations is  subjected to tests, and when Their strength and endurance have by this  means been revealed in the plenitude of power, other men receive  instruction therefrom, and are made aware of how great must be their own  steadfastness and endurance under tests and trials. For the Divine  Educator must teach by word and also by deed, thus revealing to all the  straight pathway of truth.    As to my station, it is that of the servant of Baha; 'Abdu'l-Baha, the  visible expression of servitude to the Threshold of the Abha Beauty.            27: IN CYCLES GONE BY, EACH ONE OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ...      In cycles gone by, each one of the Manifestations of God hath had His own  rank in the world of existence, and each hath represented a stage in the  development of humanity. But the Manifestation of the Most Great Name--may  my life be a sacrifice for His loved ones--was an expression of the coming  of age, the maturing of man's inmost reality in this world of being. For  the sun is the source and well-spring of light and heat, the focal point  of splendours, and it compriseth all the perfections that are made  manifest by the other stars which have dawned upon the world. Make thou an  effort that thou mayest take thy place under the sun and receive an  abundant share of its dazzling light. In truth do I tell thee, once thou  hast attained this station, thou shalt behold the saints bowing down their  heads in all humility before Him. Haste thou to life before death cometh;  haste thou to the spring season before autumn draweth in; and before  illness striketh, haste thou to healing--that thou mayest become a  physician of the spirit who, with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, healeth  all manner of sickness in this famed and glorious age.            28: O LEAF UPON THE TREE OF LIFE! THE TREE OF LIFE, OF ...      O leaf upon the Tree of Life! The Tree of Life, of which mention is made  in the Bible, is Baha'u'llah, and the daughters of the Kingdom are the  leaves upon that blessed Tree. Then thank thou God that thou hast become  related to that Tree, and that thou art flourishing, tender and fresh.    The gates of the Kingdom are opened wide, and every favoured soul is  seated at the banquet table of the Lord, receiving his portion of that  heavenly feast. Praised be God, thou too art present at this table, taking  thy share of the bountiful food of heaven. Thou art serving the Kingdom,  and art well acquainted with the sweet savours of the Abha Paradise.    Then strive thou with all thy might to guide the people, and eat thou of  the bread that hath come down from heaven. For this is the meaning of  Christ's words: 'I am the living bread which came down from heaven ... he  that eateth of this bread shall live forever.'(24)            29: O THOU WHO ART CAPTIVATED BY THE TRUTH AND ...      O thou who art captivated by the truth and magnetized by the Heavenly  Kingdom! Thy long letter hath come and it brought great joy, as it clearly  betokened thy strenuous efforts and high purposes. Praised be God, thou  wishest well to men, and yearnest after the Kingdom of Baha, and art  longing to see the human race press forward. It is my hope that because of  these high ideals, these noble intimations of the heart, and these tidings  of heaven, thou shalt become so luminous that down all the ages the light  of thy love for God will shed its glory.    Thou hast described thyself as a student in the school of spiritual  progress. Fortunate art thou! If these schools of progress lead to the  university of heaven, then branches of knowledge will be developed whereby  humanity will look upon the tablet of existence as a scroll endlessly  unfolding; and all created things will be seen upon that scroll as letters  and words. Then will the different planes of meaning be learned, and then  within every atom of the universe will be witnessed the signs of the  oneness of God. Then will man hear the cry of the Lord of the Kingdom, and  behold the confirmations of the Holy Spirit coming to succour him. Then  will he feel such bliss, such ecstasy, that the wide world with its  vastness will no longer contain him, and he will set out for the Kingdom  of God, and hurry along to the realm of the spirit. For once a bird hath  grown its wings, it remaineth on the ground no more, but soareth upward  into high heaven--except for those birds that are tied by the leg, or those  whose wings are broken, or mired down.    O thou seeker after truth! The world of the Kingdom is one world. The only  difference is that spring returneth over and over again, and setteth up a  great new commotion throughout all created things. Then plain and hillside  come alive, and trees turn delicately green, and leaves, blossoms and  fruits come forth in beauty, infinite and tender. Wherefore the  dispensations of past ages are intimately connected with those that follow  them: indeed, they are one and the same, but as the world groweth, so doth  the light, so doth the downpour of heavenly grace, and then the Day-Star  shineth out in noonday splendour.    O thou seeker after the Kingdom! Every divine Manifestation is the very  life of the world, and the skilled physician of each ailing soul. The  world of man is sick, and that competent Physician knoweth the cure,  arising as He doth with teachings, counsels and admonishments that are the  remedy for every pain, the healing balm to every wound. It is certain that  the wise physician can diagnose his patient's needs at any season, and  apply the cure. Wherefore, relate thou the Teachings of the Abha Beauty to  the urgent needs of this present day, and thou wilt see that they provide  an instant remedy for the ailing body of the world. Indeed, they are the  elixir that bringeth eternal health.

All will dwell in one common fatherland, which  is the planet itself. Universal peace and concord will be realized between  all the nations, and that Incomparable Branch will gather together all  Israel, signifying that in this cycle Israel will be gathered in the Holy  Land, and that the Jewish people who are scattered to the East and West,  South and North, will be assembled together.    Now see: these events did not take place in the Christian cycle, for the  nations did not come under the One Standard which is the Divine Branch.  But in this cycle of the Lord of Hosts all the nations and peoples will  enter under the shadow of this Flag. In the same way, Israel, scattered  all over the world, was not reassembled in the Holy Land in the Christian  cycle; but in the beginning of the cycle of Baha'u'llah this divine  promise, as is clearly stated in all the Books of the Prophets, has begun  to be manifest. You can see that from all the parts of the world tribes of  Jews are coming to the Holy Land; they live in villages and lands which  they make their own, and day by day they are increasing to such an extent  that all Palestine will become their home.          13: COMMENTARY ON THE TWELFTH CHAPTER OF THE REVELATION OF ST. JOHN      We have before explained that what is most frequently meant by the Holy  City, the Jerusalem of God, which is mentioned in the Holy Book, is the  Law of God. It is compared sometimes to a bride, and sometimes to  Jerusalem, and again to the new heaven and earth. So in chapter 21, verses  1, 2 and 3 of the Revelation of St. John, it is said: \"And I saw a new  heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were  passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new  Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned  for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold,  the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they  shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their  God.\"    Notice how clear and evident it is that the first heaven and earth signify  the former Law. For it is said that the first heaven and earth have passed  away and there is no more sea--that is to say, that the earth is the place  of judgment, and on this earth of judgment there is no sea, meaning that  the teachings and the Law of God will entirely spread over the earth, and  all men will enter the Cause of God, and the earth will be completely  inhabited by believers; therefore, there will be no more sea, for the  dwelling place and abode of man is the dry land. In other words, at that  epoch the field of that Law will become the pleasure-ground of man. Such  earth is solid; the feet do not slip upon it.    The Law of God is also described as the Holy City, the New Jerusalem. It  is evident that the New Jerusalem which descends from heaven is not a city  of stone, mortar, bricks, earth and wood. It is the Law of God which  descends from heaven and is called new, for it is clear that the Jerusalem  which is of stone and earth does not descend from heaven, and that it is  not renewed; but that which is renewed is the Law of God.    The Law of God is also compared to an adorned bride who appears with most  beautiful ornaments, as it has been said in chapter 21 of the Revelation  of St. John: \"And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down  from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.\"(73)  And in chapter 12, verse 1, it is said: \"And there appeared a great wonder  in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and  upon her head a crown of twelve stars.\" This woman is that bride, the Law  of God that descended upon Muhammad. The sun with which she was clothed,  and the moon which was under her feet, are the two nations which are under  the shadow of that Law, the Persian and Ottoman kingdoms; for the emblem  of Persia is the sun, and that of the Ottoman Empire is the crescent moon.  Thus the sun and moon are the emblems of two kingdoms which are under the  power of the Law of God. Afterward it is said: \"upon her head is a crown  of twelve stars.\" These twelve stars are the twelve Imams, who were the  promoters of the Law of Muhammad and the educators of the people, shining  like stars in the heaven of guidance.    Then it is said in the second verse: \"and she being with child cried,\"  meaning that this Law fell into the greatest difficulties and endured  great troubles and afflictions until a perfect offspring was produced--that  is, the coming Manifestation, the Promised One, Who is the perfect  offspring, and Who was reared in the bosom of this Law, which is as its  mother. The child Who is referred to is the Bab, the Primal Point, Who was  in truth born from the Law of Muhammad--that is to say, the Holy Reality,  Who is the child and outcome of the Law of God, His mother, and Who is  promised by that religion, finds a reality in the kingdom of that Law; but  because of the despotism of the dragon the child was carried up to God.  After twelve hundred and sixty days the dragon was destroyed, and the  child of the Law of God, the Promised One, became manifest.    Verses 3 and 4. \"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; and behold a  great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon  his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and  did cast them to the earth.\"(74) These signs are an allusion to the  dynasty of the Umayyads who dominated the Muhammadan religion. Seven heads  and seven crowns mean seven countries and dominions over which the  Umayyads had power: they were the Roman dominion around Damascus; and the  Persian, Arabian and Egyptian dominions, together with the dominion of  Africa--that is to say, Tunis, Morocco and Algeria; the dominion of  Andalusia, which is now Spain; and the dominion of the Turks of  Transoxania. The Umayyads had power over these countries. The ten horns  mean the names of the Umayyad rulers--that is, without repetition, there  were ten names of rulers, meaning ten names of commanders and chiefs--the  first is Abu Sufyan and the last Marvan--but several of them bear the same  name. So there are two Muaviya, three Yazid, two Valid, and two Marvan;  but if the names were counted without repetition there would be ten. The  Umayyads, of whom the first was Abu Sufyan, Amir of Mecca and chief of the  dynasty of the Umayyads, and the last was Marvan, destroyed the third part  of the holy and saintly people of the lineage of Muhammad who were like  the stars of heaven.    Verse 4. \"And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be  delivered, for to devour the child as soon as it was born.\"(75) As we have  before explained, this woman is the Law of God. The dragon was standing  near the woman to devour her child, and this child was the promised  Manifestation, the offspring of the Law of Muhammad. The Umayyads were  always waiting to get possession of the Promised One, Who was to come from  the line of Muhammad, to destroy and annihilate Him; for they much feared  the appearance of the promised Manifestation, and they sought to kill any  of Muhammad's descendants who might be highly esteemed.    Verse 5. \"And she brought forth a man child, Who was to rule all nations  with a rod of iron.\" This great son is the promised Manifestation Who was  born of the Law of God and reared in the bosom of the divine teachings.  The iron rod is a symbol of power and might--it is not a sword--and means  that with divine power and might He will shepherd all the nations of the  earth. This son is the Bab.    Verse 5. \"And her child was caught up unto God, and to His throne.\" This  is a prophecy of the Bab, Who ascended to the heavenly realm, to the  Throne of God, and to the center of His Kingdom. Consider how all this  corresponds to what happened.    Verse 6. \"And the woman fled into the wilderness\"--that is to say, the Law  of God fled to the wilderness, meaning the vast desert of Hijaz, and the  Arabian Peninsula.    Verse 6. \"Where she had a place prepared of God.\"(76) The Arabian  Peninsula became the abode and dwelling place, and the center of the Law  of God.    Verse 6. \"That they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and  threescore days.\" In the terminology of the Holy Book these twelve hundred  and sixty days mean the twelve hundred and sixty years that the Law of God  was set up in the wilderness of Arabia, the great desert: from it the  Promised One has come. After twelve hundred and sixty years that Law will  have no more influence, for the fruit of that tree will have appeared, and  the result will have been produced.    Consider how the prophecies correspond to one another. In the Apocalypse,  the appearance of the Promised One is appointed after forty-two months,  and Daniel expresses it as three times and a half, which is also forty-two  months, which are twelve hundred and sixty days. In another passage of  John's Revelation it is clearly spoken of as twelve hundred and sixty  days, and in the Holy Book it is said that each day signifies one year.  Nothing could be clearer than this agreement of the prophecies with one  another. The Bab appeared in the year 1260 of the Hejira of Muhammad,  which is the beginning of the universal era-reckoning of all Islam. There  are no clearer proofs than this in the Holy Books for any Manifestation.  For him who is just, the agreement of the times indicated by the tongues  of the Great Ones is the most conclusive proof. There is no other possible  explanation of these prophecies. Blessed are the just souls who seek the  truth. But failing justice, the people attack, dispute and openly deny the  evidence, like the Pharisees who, at the manifestation of Christ, denied  with the greatest obstinacy the explanations of Christ and of His"]]]
