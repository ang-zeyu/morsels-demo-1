The antlers can only  have increased in size by very slow degrees, so that the muscles and  bones may have been able to keep pace with their growth in the  individual life, until the requisite germinal variations presented  themselves. In this way a disharmony between the increasing weight of  the antlers and the parts which support and move them would be  avoided, since time would be given for the appropriate germinal  variations to occur, and so to set agoing the _hereditary_ variation  of the muscles, sinews and bones.[42]    I still regard this idea as correct, but I attribute less importance  to \"organic selection\" than I did at that time, in so far that I do  not believe that it _alone_ could effect complex harmonious  adaptations. Germinal selection now seems to me to play the chief part  in bringing about such adaptations. Something the same is true of the  principle I have called _Panmixia_. As I became more and more  convinced, in the course of years, that the _Lamarckian principle_  ought not to be called in to explain the dwindling of disused parts, I  believed that this process might be simply explained as due to the  cessation of the conservative effect of natural selection. I said to  myself that, from the moment in which a part ceases to be of use,  natural selection withdraws its hand from it, and then it must  inevitably fall from the height of its adaptiveness, because inferior  variants would have as good a chance of persisting as better ones,  since all grades of fitness of the part in question would be mingled  with one another indiscriminately. This is undoubtedly true, as  Romanes pointed out ten years before I did, and this mingling of the  bad with the good probably does bring about a deterioration of the  part concerned. But it cannot account for the steady diminution, which  always occurs when a part is in process of becoming rudimentary, and  which goes on until it ultimately disappears altogether. The process  of dwindling cannot therefore be explained as due to panmixia alone:  we can only find a sufficient explanation in germinal selection.      IV. DERIVATIVES OF THE THEORY OF SELECTION    The impetus in all directions given by Darwin through his theory of  selection has been an immeasurable one, and its influence is still  felt. It falls within the province of the historian of science to  enumerate all the ideas which, in the last quarter of the nineteenth  century, grew out of Darwin's theories, in the endeavour to penetrate  more deeply into the problem of the evolution of the organic world.  Within the narrow limits to which this paper is restricted, I cannot  attempt to discuss any of these.      V. ARGUMENTS FOR THE REALITY OF THE PROCESSES OF SELECTION      (_a_) _Sexual Selection_    Sexual selection goes hand in hand with natural selection. From the  very first I have regarded sexual selection as affording an extremely  important and interesting corroboration of natural selection, but,  singularly enough, it is precisely against this theory that an adverse  judgment has been pronounced in so many quarters, and it is only quite  recently, and probably in proportion as the wealth of facts in proof  of it penetrates into a wider circle, that we seem to be approaching a  more general recognition of this side of the problem of adaptations.  Thus Darwin's words in his preface to the second edition (1874) of his  book, _The Descent of Man and Sexual Selection_, are being justified:  \"My conviction as to the operation of natural selection remains  unshaken,\" and further, \"If naturalists were to become more familiar  with the idea of sexual selection, it would, I think, be accepted to a  much greater extent, and already it is fully and favourably accepted  by many competent judges.\" Darwin was able to speak thus because he  was already acquainted with an immense mass of facts, which, taken  together, yield overwhelming evidence of the validity of the principle  of sexual selection.    _Natural selection_ chooses out for reproduction the individuals that  are best equipped for the struggle for existence, and it does so at  every stage of development; it thus improves the species in all its  stages and forms. _Sexual selection_ operates only on individuals  that are already capable of reproduction, and does so only in relation  to the attainment of reproduction. It arises from the rivalry of one  sex, usually the male, for the possession of the other, usually the  female. Its influence can therefore only _directly_ affect one sex, in  that it equips it better for attaining possession of the other. But  the effect may extend indirectly to the female sex, and thus the whole  species may be modified, without, however, becoming any more capable  of resistance in the struggle for existence, for sexual selection only  gives rise to adaptations which are likely to give their possessor the  victory over rivals in the struggle for possession of the female, and  which are therefore peculiar to the wooing sex: the manifold  \"secondary sexual characters.\" The diversity of these characters is so  great that I cannot here attempt to give anything approaching a  complete treatment of them, but I should like to give a sufficient  number of examples to make the principle itself, in its various modes  of expression, quite clear.    One of the chief preliminary postulates of sexual selection is the  unequal number of individuals in the two sexes, for if every male  immediately finds his mate there can be no competition for the  possession of the female. Darwin has shown that, for the most part,  the inequality between the sexes is due simply to the fact that there  are more males than females, and therefore the males must take some  pains to secure a mate. But the inequality does not always depend on  the numerical preponderance of the males, it is often due to polygamy;  for, if one male claims several females, the number of females in  proportion to the rest of the males will be reduced. Since it is  almost always the males that are the wooers, we must expect to find  the occurrence of secondary sexual characters chiefly among them, and  to find it especially frequent in polygamous species. And this is  actually the case.    If we were to try to guess--without knowing the facts--what means the  male animals make use of to overcome their rivals in the struggle for  the possession of the female, we might name many kinds of means, but  it would be difficult to suggest any which is not actually employed in  some animal group of other. I begin with the mere difference in  strength, through which the male of many animals is so sharply  distinguished from the female, as, for instance, the lion, walrus,  \"sea-elephant,\" and others. Among these the males fight violently for  the possession of the female, who falls to the victor in the combat.  In this simple case no one can doubt the operation of selection, and  there is just as little room for doubt as to the selection-value of  the initial stages of the variation. Differences in bodily strength  are apparent even among human beings, although in their case the  struggle for the possession of the female is no longer decided by  bodily strength alone.    Combats between male animals are often violent and obstinate, and the  employment of the natural weapons of the species in this way has led  to perfecting of these, e.g. the tusks of the boar, the antlers of the  stag, and the enormous, antler-like jaws of the stag-beetle. Here  again it is impossible to doubt that variations in these organs  presented themselves, and that these were considerable enough to be  decisive in combat, and so to lead to the improvement of the weapon.    Among many animals, however, the females at first withdraw from the  males; they are coy, and have to be sought out, and sometimes held by  force. This tracking and grasping of the females by the males has  given rise to many different characters in the latter, as, for  instance, the larger eyes of the male bee, and especially of the males  of the Ephemerids (May-flies), some species of which show, in addition  to the usual compound eyes, large, so-called turban-eyes, so that the  whole head is covered with seeing surfaces. In these species the  females are very greatly in the minority (1-100), and it is easy to  understand that a keen competition for them must take place, and that,  when the insects of both sexes are floating freely in the air, an  unusually wide range of vision will carry with it a decided  advantage. Here again the actual adaptations are in accordance with  the preliminary postulates of the theory. We do not know the stages  through which the eye has passed to its present perfected state, but,  since the number of simple eyes (facets) has become very much greater  in the male than in the female, we may assume that their increase is  due to a gradual duplication of the determinants of the ommatidium in  the germ-plasm, as I have already indicated in regard to sense-organs  in general. In this case, again, the selection-value of the initial  stages hardly admits of doubt; better vision _directly_ secures  reproduction.    In many cases _the organ of smell_ shows a similar improvement. Many  lower Crustaceans (Daphnidae) have better developed organs of smell in  the male sex. The difference is often slight and amounts only to one  or two olfactory filaments, but certain species show a difference of  nearly a hundred of these filaments (Leptodora). The same thing occurs  among insects.    We must briefly consider the clasping or grasping organs which have  developed in the males among many lower Crustaceans, but here natural  selection plays its part along with sexual selection, for the union of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22460"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 5, August, 1915 (#12)"],[1,"itself on a line  running from Eski-Hissarlik on the south coast of the peninsula to the  region of Sari-Bair, on the north coast, constituting a front of  approximately twenty miles, within five miles of the west coast. No  progress further than this have the Allies been able to make up to the  present, and the watch at the Dardanelles stands firm as yet.    The attacks of the Anglo-French armies, however, exerted influence on  Turkey's operations in other fields of action. They caused the  complete abandonment of a contemplated invasion of Egypt and compelled  the Turkish troops to go on the defensive in the Caucasian seat of  war. This enabled Russia to call back to Poland troops sorely needed  there, with which they had had to check the Turkish advance on Kars in  January. Since February both battlelines along the Caucasian front  have been weakened and no fighting of any consequence has occurred in  this campaign of merely secondary importance.    The operations in the latest field of action, along the Austro-Italian  frontier, have been going on for but eight weeks, and do not,  therefore, allow any conclusions as to their importance to be made as  yet. So far the Italians have been unable to make any effective  impression on either Austria's Tyrolese frontier or on the front of  the Isonzo. All attempts to break through the Austrian lines have thus  far failed. The aim of Austria's strategy is to maintain a deadlock  until the issue has been decided in Poland.    In determining the results of the first year of the world war the  question as to which side is holding the advantage at the close of  this important period depends entirely upon what were the political  aims of the adversaries. The Teutonic allies' contention has ever  been, rightly or wrongly, that they are not waging a war for  territorial aggrandizement, but purely one in self-defense. From this  point of view they can be well satisfied with the results they have so  far attained.      An American View    By the Military Expert of The New York Times    FIRST PHASE    Opening the Way to France Through Belgium    By Aug. 4, 1914, war had been declared by all the nations now engaged  except Turkey and Italy. Subsequent events have proved that of them  all the Teutonic allies were the only nations actually prepared and  that as between Austria and Germany the preparation of the latter was  much more complete. It was the Germans, therefore, who, with the  entire campaign carefully mapped out in advance, took the initiative.  Germany, too, at the very outset saw the one clear path to victory.    One or the other of her Continental enemies must not only be defeated,  but crushed and eliminated from the conflict before the other could  mobilize against her. One of them, Russia, would probably take the  longer time to effect her mobilization. Russia had started, it is  true, before war was declared. But interior railroads in Russia are  few. Russia, too, is proverbially slow, if for no other reason than by  virtue of her ponderous numbers. France, on the other hand, is checked  and counter-checked by good strategic railroads, and, having no such  vast territory over which her troops would have to be moved, would be  able to mobilize in a much shorter time than her ally. England, for a  few weeks at least, could be disregarded. Deceived as to the extent of  Russian unpreparedness and believing that Russia's slowness would  prevent an active offense for some weeks, Germany selected France as  her first objective, and took immediate steps to hurl twenty-four army  corps across the French border at various points, aiming at Paris.    These twenty-four corps were divided into three armies--the Army of  the Meuse, based on Cologne; the Army of the Moselle, based on Metz  and Coblenz, and the Army of the Rhine, based on Strassburg. All of  these three armies were naturally to converge on Paris. The route of  the Army of the Meuse would pass through Liege, Namur, and Maubeuge,  and would therefore have to cross a part of Belgium; the Army of the  Moselle would take a route through Sedan and Soissons, passing north  of the Verdun fortress, but of necessity crossing the Duchy of  Luxemburg; the Army of the Rhine, after crossing the screen of the  Vosges Mountains, would pass through Nancy and Toul, between the  fortresses of Epinal and Belfort.    It is obvious that the march to Paris would be most quickly achieved  through the flat country of Belgium, where the French frontier is  practically unguarded and only the weakly manned barrier fortresses of  Belgium barred the way. The remainder of the French frontier from  Luxemburg to Switzerland was well fortified, and Germany had no time  to spend in reducing fortified places.    [Illustration: THOMAS A. EDISON    The American Inventor, Now Associated With the Navy Department as  Chief of the Advisory Board of Civilian Inventors and Engineers]    [Illustration: HUDSON MAXIM    American Inventor of High Explosives and Other Materials of War    (_Photo by White._)]    The main advance was therefore to take place through Belgium, the Army  of the Moselle co-operating, while to the Army of the Rhine was  assigned the offensive-defensive role of advancing to the barrier  fortresses of Epinal and Belfort to check any French advance that  might be directed against the communications of the Armies of the  Moselle and the Meuse to the north. The railroad communications  through the Belgian plain were splendidly adapted to this plan, backed  as they were by the military railroads which Germany had constructed  several years before, running through the industrial districts in the  north of the German Empire up to the Belgian border.    Germany's first move was the invasion of Luxemburg, violating the  neutrality of a State which, under the treaty making her independent  and guaranteeing neutrality, (to which treaty Germany was a party,)  was not permitted to maintain an army. Two days later Germany asked  passage for her troops through Belgium, for the purpose of attacking  France. Belgium promptly refused, and on Aug. 4 Germany began the  forcing of this passage by an attack on Liege.    Thus, at the outset the German plan went awry. Although the  contemplated line of advance was through Liege and Namur, it was not  sufficient, with Belgium openly in arms to defend her country, to  reduce only these two towns. The Belgian Army could, and later did,  fall back to the north on Louvain, Brussels, and Antwerp, and so be  directly on the German flank and in a position to strike at the line  of communications. It was therefore necessary to subjugate all of  Belgium either by destroying the Belgian Army or driving it before  them in their advance.    Thus, the German advance was not only doomed to delay, but at least  100,000 troops were needed to garrison a hostile country and to  protect the life lines running to the rear.    Three days after the attack on Liege opened the Germans penetrated  between the outer forts, their infantry advancing in close formation  and sustaining enormous losses. But Liege was worth the price paid.  Some of the forts held out for days, but were finally reduced by the  fire of the 42-centimeter guns--the first of the German surprises. The  Belgian garrison, however, had done its work. The German advance was  delayed for ten precious days, during which the first consignment of  the British expeditionary force had reached the Continent and France  and Russia had largely completed their mobilization.    As soon as it was realized that the unexpected Belgian resistance had  retarded the German advance and in all probability had disarranged the  German plan of campaign, the French, even before the guns of Liege had  cooled, struck at Alsace, through the Belford Gap and over the Vosges  Mountains. At first this French offensive was successful. Points on  the Metz-Strassburg Railroad were taken and the town of Muelhausen  captured. But almost before the news of success reached Paris the  French had been defeated, not only in Alsace but also in Lorraine,  whence French troops had been sent to engage the German Army of the  Moselle. The result was the retirement of the French to the line of  their first defense--a line that had been prepared for just such an  emergency during the years since 1871.    While the German armies of the Moselle and of the Rhine were thus  occupied in repelling the French advance the Army of the Meuse was  forcing its way through Belgium. Throwing out a strong cavalry screen  in its front, this army advanced through Tongres, St. Frond, Laugen,  Haelen, and Terlemont, and finally confronted the Belgians on the line  from Louvain to Namur. Fighting on this front filled almost a week,  when the destruction of the fortifications of Namur forced the  Belgians to fall back, pivoting on Louvain to the line from Louvain to  Wavre, the last line in front of Brussels. On Aug. 20 the Belgians  were defeated at Louvain and the Germans entered Brussels, the Belgian  Government having previously retired to Antwerp. The first phase of  the German advance was thus completed and the way to France was open.    SECOND PHASE    From the Fall of Brussels to von Kluck's Retreat to the Aisne    Immediately following the fall of Namur, which forced the Belgians to  take up the Louvain-Wavre line, the main German Army of the Meuse  started for France, leaving possibly two army corps to drive the  Belgians from Brussels and to protect their flank and their lines of  communication. The German advance first came in contact with the  French and British along a line from Mons to Charleroi, southwest of  Brussels. The British were supposed to have been between two French  armies, but for some reason the army which had been assigned to  position on the British left did not appear. Being outflanked, a  retreat followed, the French being defeated at the same time at  Charleroi. The German Army of"]]]
