Reason at that time darted a ray upon the world through  the gloom of the schools, and the prejudices of popular superstition.  At  last his name spread so universally, that the French were desirous of  bringing him back into his native country by rewards, and accordingly  offered him an annual pension of a thousand crowns.  Upon these hopes  Descartes returned to France; paid the fees of his patent, which was sold  at that time, but no pension was settled upon him.  Thus disappointed, he  returned to his solitude in North Holland, where he again pursued the  study of philosophy, whilst the great Galileo, at fourscore years of age,  was groaning in the prisons of the Inquisition, only for having  demonstrated the earth's motion.    At last Descartes was snatched from the world in the flower of his age at  Stockholm.  His death was owing to a bad regimen, and he expired in the  midst of some literati who were his enemies, and under the hands of a  physician to whom he was odious.    The progress of Sir Isaac Newton's life was quite different.  He lived  happy, and very much honoured in his native country, to the age of  fourscore and five years.    It was his peculiar felicity, not only to be born in a country of  liberty, but in an age when all scholastic impertinences were banished  from the world.  Reason alone was cultivated, and mankind could only be  his pupil, not his enemy.    One very singular difference in the lives of these two great men is, that  Sir Isaac, during the long course of years he enjoyed, was never sensible  to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor  ever had any commerce with women--a circumstance which was assured me by  the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments.    We may admire Sir Isaac Newton on this occasion, but then we must not  censure Descartes.    The opinion that generally prevails in England with regard to these new  philosophers is, that the latter was a dreamer, and the former a sage.    Very few people in England read Descartes, whose works indeed are now  useless.  On the other side, but a small number peruse those of Sir  Isaac, because to do this the student must be deeply skilled in the  mathematics, otherwise those works will be unintelligible to him.  But  notwithstanding this, these great men are the subject of everyone's  discourse.  Sir Isaac Newton is allowed every advantage, whilst Descartes  is not indulged a single one.  According to some, it is to the former  that we owe the discovery of a vacuum, that the air is a heavy body, and  the invention of telescopes.  In a word, Sir Isaac Newton is here as the  Hercules of fabulous story, to whom the ignorant ascribed all the feats  of ancient heroes.    In a critique that was made in London on Mr. de Fontenelle's discourse,  the writer presumed to assert that Descartes was not a great  geometrician.  Those who make such a declaration may justly be reproached  with flying in their master's face.  Descartes extended the limits of  geometry as far beyond the place where he found them, as Sir Isaac did  after him.  The former first taught the method of expressing curves by  equations.  This geometry which, thanks to him for it, is now grown  common, was so abstruse in his time, that not so much as one professor  would undertake to explain it; and Schotten in Holland, and Format in  France, were the only men who understood it.    He applied this geometrical and inventive genius to dioptrics, which,  when treated of by him, became a new art.  And if he was mistaken in some  things, the reason of that is, a man who discovers a new tract of land  cannot at once know all the properties of the soil.  Those who come after  him, and make these lands fruitful, are at least obliged to him for the  discovery.  I will not deny but that there are innumerable errors in the  rest of Descartes' works.    Geometry was a guide he himself had in some measure fashioned, which  would have conducted him safely through the several paths of natural  philosophy.  Nevertheless, he at last abandoned this guide, and gave  entirely into the humour of forming hypotheses; and then philosophy was  no more than an ingenious romance, fit only to amuse the ignorant.  He  was mistaken in the nature of the soul, in the proofs of the existence of  a God, in matter, in the laws of motion, and in the nature of light.  He  admitted innate ideas, he invented new elements, he created a world; he  made man according to his own fancy; and it is justly said, that the man  of Descartes is, in fact, that of Descartes only, very different from the  real one.    He pushed his metaphysical errors so far, as to declare that two and two  make four for no other reason but because God would have it so.  However,  it will not be making him too great a compliment if we affirm that he was  valuable even in his mistakes.  He deceived himself; but then it was at  least in a methodical way.  He destroyed all the absurd chimeras with  which youth had been infatuated for two thousand years.  He taught his  contemporaries how to reason, and enabled them to employ his own weapons  against himself.  If Descartes did not pay in good money, he however did  great service in crying down that of a base alloy.    I indeed believe that very few will presume to compare his philosophy in  any respect with that of Sir Isaac Newton.  The former is an essay, the  latter a masterpiece.  But then the man who first brought us to the path  of truth, was perhaps as great a genius as he who afterwards conducted us  through it.    Descartes gave sight to the blind.  These saw the errors of antiquity and  of the sciences.  The path he struck out is since become boundless.  Rohault's little work was, during some years, a complete system of  physics; but now all the Transactions of the several academies in Europe  put together do not form so much as the beginning of a system.  In  fathoming this abyss no bottom has been found.  We are now to examine  what discoveries Sir Isaac Newton has made in it.        LETTER XV.--ON ATTRACTION      The discoveries which gained Sir Isaac Newton so universal a reputation,  relate to the system of the world, to light, to geometrical infinities;  and, lastly, to chronology, with which he used to amuse himself after the  fatigue of his severer studies.    I will now acquaint you (without prolixity if possible) with the few  things I have been able to comprehend of all these sublime ideas.  With  regard to the system of our world, disputes were a long time maintained,  on the cause that turns the planets, and keeps them in their orbits: and  on those causes which make all bodies here below descend towards the  surface of the earth.    The system of Descartes, explained and improved since his time, seemed to  give a plausible reason for all those phenomena; and this reason seemed  more just, as it is simple and intelligible to all capacities.  But in  philosophy, a student ought to doubt of the things he fancies he  understands too easily, as much as of those he does not understand.    Gravity, the falling of accelerated bodies on the earth, the revolution  of the planets in their orbits, their rotations round their axis, all  this is mere motion.  Now motion cannot perhaps be conceived any  otherwise than by impulsion; therefore all those bodies must be impelled.  But by what are they impelled?  All space is full, it therefore is filled  with a very subtile matter, since this is imperceptible to us; this  matter goes from west to east, since all the planets are carried from  west to east.  Thus from hypothesis to hypothesis, from one appearance to  another, philosophers have imagined a vast whirlpool of subtile matter,  in which the planets are carried round the sun: they also have created  another particular vortex which floats in the great one, and which turns  daily round the planets.  When all this is done, it is pretended that  gravity depends on this diurnal motion; for, say these, the velocity of  the subtile matter that turns round our little vortex, must be seventeen  times more rapid than that of the earth; or, in case its velocity is  seventeen times greater than that of the earth, its centrifugal force  must be vastly greater, and consequently impel all bodies towards the  earth.  This is the cause of gravity, according to the Cartesian system.  But the theorist, before he calculated the centrifugal force and velocity  of the subtile matter, should first have been certain that it existed.    Sir Isaac Newton, seems to have destroyed all these great and little  vortices, both that which carries the planets round the sun, as well as  the other which supposes every planet to turn on its own axis.    First, with regard to the pretended little vortex of the earth, it is  demonstrated that it must lose its motion by insensible degrees; it is  demonstrated, that if the earth swims in a fluid, its density must be  equal to that of the earth; and in case its density be the same, all the  bodies we endeavour to move must meet with an insuperable resistance.    With regard to the great vortices, they are still more chimerical, and it  is impossible to make them agree with Kepler's law, the truth of which  has been demonstrated.  Sir Isaac shows, that the revolution of the fluid  in which Jupiter is supposed to be carried, is not the same with regard  to the revolution of the fluid of the earth, as the revolution of Jupiter  with respect to that of the earth.  He proves, that as the planets make  their revolutions in ellipses, and consequently being at a much greater  distance one from the other in their Aphelia, and a little nearer in  their Perihelia; the earth's velocity, for instance, ought to be greater  when it is nearer Venus and Mars, because the fluid that carries it  along, being then more pressed, ought to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2447"],[0,"Eminent Victorians (#12)"],[1,"consummation.  Was not the Oxford Movement, with its flood of converts, a clear sign of  the Divine will? Had he not himself been the author of that momentous  article on St. Augustine and the Donatists, which had finally convinced  Newman that the Church of England was in schism? And then, had he not  been able to set afoot a Crusade of Prayer throughout Catholic Europe  for the conversion of England?    He awaited the result with eager expectation, and in the meantime he set  himself to smooth away the hostility of his countrymen by delivering  courses of popular lectures on literature and archaeology. He devoted  much time and attention to the ceremonial details of his princely  office. His knowledge of rubric and ritual, and of the symbolical  significations of vestments, has rarely been equalled, and he took a  profound delight in the ordering and the performance of elaborate  processions. During one of these functions, an unexpected difficulty  arose: the Master of Ceremonies suddenly gave the word for a halt, and,  on being asked the reason, replied that he had been instructed that  moment by special revelation to stop the procession. The Cardinal,  however, was not at a loss. 'You may let the procession go on,' he  smilingly replied. 'I have just obtained permission, by special  revelation, to proceed with it.' His leisure hours he spent in the  writing of edifying novels, the composition of acrostics in Latin Verse,  and in playing battledore and shuttlecock with his little nieces. There  was, indeed, only one point in which he resembled Bishop Blougram--his  love of a good table. Some of Newman's disciples were astonished and  grieved to find that he sat down to four courses of fish during Lent. 'I  am sorry to say,' remarked one of them afterwards, 'that there is a  lobster salad side to the Cardinal.'    It was a melancholy fate which ordained that the last years of this  comfortable, easygoing, innocent old man should be distracted and  embittered by the fury of opposing principles and the venom of personal  animosities. But so it was. He had fallen into the hands of one who  cared very little for the gentle pleasures of repose. Left to himself,  Wiseman might have compromised with the Old Catholics and Dr. Errington;  but when Manning had once appeared upon the scene, all compromise became  impossible. The late Archdeacon of Chichester, who had understood so  well and practised with such careful skill the precept of the golden  mean so dear to the heart of the Church of England, now, as Provost of  Westminster, flung himself into the fray with that unyielding intensity  of fervour, that passion for the extreme and the absolute, which is the  very lifeblood of the Church of Rome. Even the redoubtable Dr.  Errington, short, thickset, determined, with his `hawk-like expression  of face', as a contemporary described him, 'as he looked at you through  his blue spectacles', had been known to quail in the presence of his,  antagonist, with his tall and graceful figure, his pale ascetic  features, his compressed and icy lips, his calm and penetrating gaze. As  for the poor Cardinal, he was helpless indeed.    Henceforward, there was to be no paltering with that dangerous spirit of  independence--was it not almost Gallicanism which possessed the Old  Catholic families of England? The supremacy of the Vicar of Christ must  be maintained at all hazards. Compared with such an object, what were  the claims of personal affection and domestic peace? The Cardinal  pleaded in vain; his lifelong friendship with Dr. Errington was plucked  up by the roots, and the harmony of his private life was utterly  destroyed. His own household was turned against him. His favourite  nephew, whom he had placed among the Oblates under Manning's special  care, left the congregation and openly joined the party of Dr.  Errington. His secretary followed suit; but saddest of all was the case  of Monsignor Searle. Monsignor Searle, in the capacity of confidential  man of affairs, had dominated over the Cardinal in private for years  with the autocratic fidelity of a servant who has grown indispensable.  His devotion, in fact, seemed to have taken the form of physical  imitation, for he was hardly less gigantic than his master. The two were  inseparable; their huge figures loomed together like neighbouring  mountains; and on one occasion, meeting them in the street, a gentleman  congratulated Wiseman on 'your Eminence's fine son'. Yet now even this  companionship was broken up. The relentless Provost here too brought a  sword. There were explosions and recriminations. Monsignor Searle,  finding that his power was slipping from him, made scenes and protests,  and at last was foolish enough to accuse Manning of peculation to his  face; after that it was clear that his day was over; he was forced to  slink snarling into the background, while the Cardinal shuddered through  all his immensity, and wished many times that he were already dead.    Yet, he was not altogether without his consolations; Manning took care  to see to that. His piercing eye had detected the secret way into the  recesses of the Cardinal's heart--had discerned the core of simple faith  which underlay that jovial manner and that facile talk. Others were  content to laugh and chatter and transact their business; Manning was  more artistic. He watched his opportunity, and then, when the moment  came, touched with a deft finger the chord of the Conversion of England.  There was an immediate response, and he struck the same chord again, and  yet again. He became the repository of the Cardinal's most intimate  aspirations. He alone sympathised and understood. 'If God gives me  strength to undertake a great wrestling-match with infidelity,' Wiseman  wrote, 'I shall owe it to him.'    But what he really found himself undertaking was a wrestling-match with  Dr. Errington. The struggle over St. Edmund's College grew more and more  acute. There were high words in the Chapter, where Monsignor Searle led  the assault against the Provost, and carried a resolution declaring that  the Oblates of St. Charles had intruded themselves illegally into the  Seminary. The Cardinal quashed the proceedings of the Chapter;  whereupon, the Chapter appealed to Rome. Dr. Errington, carried away by  the fury of the controversy, then appeared as the avowed opponent of the  Provost and the Cardinal. With his own hand he drew up a document  justifying the appeal of the Chapter to Rome by Canon Law and the  decrees of the Council of Trent. Wiseman was deeply pained: 'My own  co-adjutor,' he exclaimed, 'is acting as solicitor against me in a  lawsuit.' There was a rush to Rome, where, for several ensuing years,  the hostile English parties were to wage a furious battle in the  antechambers of the Vatican. But the dispute over the Oblates now sank  into insignificance beside the rage of contention which centred round a  new and far more deadly question; for the position of Dr. Errington  himself was at stake. The Cardinal, in spite of illness, indolence, and  the ties of friendship, had been brought at last to an extraordinary  step--he was petitioning the Pope for nothing less than the deprivation  and removal of the Archbishop of Trebizond.    The precise details of what followed are doubtful. It is only possible  to discern with clearness, amid a vast cloud of official documents and  unofficial correspondences in English, Italian, and Latin, of Papal  decrees and voluminous scritture, of confidential reports of episcopal  whispers and the secret agitations of Cardinals, the form of Manning,  restless and indomitable, scouring like a stormy petrel the angry ocean  of debate. Wiseman, dilatory, unbusinesslike, and infirm, was ready  enough to leave the conduct of affairs in his hands. Nor was it long  before Manning saw where the key of the whole position lay. As in the  old days, at Chichester, he had secured the goodwill of Bishop  Shuttleworth by cultivating the friendship of Archdeacon Hare, so now,  on this vaster scale of operations, his sagacity led him swiftly and  unerringly up the little winding staircase in the Vatican and through  the humble door which opened into the cabinet of Monsignor Talbot, the  private secretary of the Pope. Monsignor Talbot was a priest who  embodied in a singular manner, if not the highest, at least the most  persistent traditions of the Roman Curia. He was a master of various  arts which the practice of ages has brought to perfection under the  friendly shadow of the triple tiara. He could mingle together astuteness  and holiness without any difficulty; he could make innuendoes as  naturally as an ordinary man makes statements of fact; he could apply  flattery with so unsparing a hand that even Princes of the Church found  it sufficient; and, on occasion, he could ring the changes of torture on  a human soul with a tact which called forth universal approbation. With  such accomplishments, it could hardly be expected that Monsignor Talbot  should be remarkable either for a delicate sense of conscientiousness or  for an extreme refinement of feeling, but then it was not for those  qualities that Manning was in search when he went up the winding stair.  He was looking for the man who had the ear of Pio Nono; and, on the  other side of the low-arched door, he found him. Then he put forth all  his efforts; his success was complete; and an alliance began which was  destined to have the profoundest effect upon Manning's career, and was  only dissolved when, many years later, Monsignor Talbot was  unfortunately obliged to exchange his apartment in the Vatican for a  private lunatic asylum at Passy.    It was determined that the coalition should be ratified by the ruin of  Dr. Errington. When the moment of crisis was seen to be approaching,  Wiseman was summoned to Rome, where he began to draw up an immense  scrittura containing his statement of the case. For months "]]]
