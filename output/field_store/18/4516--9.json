[Exeunt.]          SCENE II.--The Parlour         Enter SIR OLIVER and MOSES    MOSES. Well sir, I think as Sir Peter said you have seen Mr. Charles in  high Glory--'tis great Pity He's so extravagant.    SIR OLIVER. True--but he would not sell my Picture--    MOSES. And loves wine and women so much--    SIR OLIVER. But He wouldn't sell my Picture.    MOSES. And game so deep--    SIR OLIVER. But He wouldn't sell my Picture. O--here's Rowley!         Enter ROWLEY    ROWLEY. So--Sir Oliver--I find you have made a Purchase----    SIR OLIVER. Yes--yes--our young Rake has parted with his Ancestors like  old Tapestry--sold Judges and Generals by the foot--and maiden Aunts as  cheap as broken China.--    ROWLEY. And here has he commissioned me to re-deliver you Part of  the purchase-money--I mean tho' in your necessitous character of old  Stanley----    MOSES. Ah! there is the Pity of all! He is so damned charitable.    ROWLEY. And I left a Hosier and two Tailors in the Hall--who I'm sure  won't be paid, and this hundred would satisfy 'em.    SIR OLIVER. Well--well--I'll pay his debts and his Benevolences  too--I'll take care of old Stanley--myself--But now I am no more  a Broker, and you shall introduce me to the elder Brother as Stanley----    ROWLEY. Not yet a while--Sir Peter I know means to call there about this  time.         Enter TRIP    TRIP. O Gentlemen--I beg Pardon for not showing you out--this  way--Moses, a word.         [Exit TRIP with MOSES.]    SIR OLIVER. There's a Fellow for you--Would you believe it that Puppy  intercepted the Jew, on our coming, and wanted to raise money before he  got to his master!    ROWLEY. Indeed!    SIR OLIVER. Yes--they are now planning an annuity Business--Ah Master  Rowley[,] in my Day Servants were content with the Follies of their  Masters when they were worn a little Thread Bare but now they have their  Vices like their Birth Day cloaths with the gloss on.         [Exeunt.]          SCENE III.--A Library         SURFACE and SERVANT    SURFACE. No letter from Lady Teazle?    SERVANT. No Sir--    SURFACE. I am surprised she hasn't sent if she is prevented from  coming--! Sir Peter certainly does not suspect me--yet I wish I may  not lose the Heiress, thro' the scrape I have drawn myself in with the  wife--However, Charles's imprudence and bad character are great Points  in my Favour.    SERVANT. Sir--I believe that must be Lady Teazle--    SURFACE. Hold[!] see--whether it is or not before you go to the Door--I  have a particular Message for you if it should be my Brother.    SERVANT. 'Tis her ladyship Sir--She always leaves her Chair at the  milliner's in the next Street.    SURFACE. Stay--stay--draw that Screen before the Window--that will  do--my opposite Neighbour is a maiden Lady of so curious a temper!--         [SERVANT draws the screen and exit.]    I have a difficult Hand to play in this Affair--Lady Teazle as lately  suspected my Views on Maria--but She must by no means be let into that  secret, at least till I have her more in my Power.         Enter LADY TEAZLE    LADY TEAZLE. What[!] Sentiment in soliloquy--have you been very  impatient now?--O Lud! don't pretend to look grave--I vow I couldn't  come before----    SURFACE. O Madam[,] Punctuality is a species of Constancy, a very  unfashionable quality in a Lady.    LADY TEAZLE. Upon my word you ought to pity me, do you now Sir Peter  is grown so ill-tempered to me of Late! and so jealous! of Charles too  that's the best of the story isn't it?    SURFACE. I am glad my scandalous Friends keep that up. [Aside.]    LADY TEAZLE. I am sure I wish He would let Maria marry him--and then  perhaps He would be convinced--don't you--Mr. Surface?    SURFACE. Indeed I do not.--[Aside.] O certainly I do--for then my dear  Lady Teazle would also be convinced how wrong her suspicions were of my  having any design on the silly Girl----    LADY TEAZLE. Well--well I'm inclined to believe you--besides I really  never could perceive why she should have so any admirers.    SURFACE. O for her Fortune--nothing else--    LADY TEAZLE. I believe so for tho' she is certainly very pretty--yet she  has no conversation in the world--and is so grave and reserved--that I  declare I think she'd have made an excellent wife for Sir Peter.--    SURFACE. So she would.    LADY TEAZLE. Then--one never hears her speak ill of anybody--which you  know is mighty dull--    SURFACE. Yet she doesn't want understanding--    LADY TEAZLE. No more she does--yet one is always disapointed when  one hears [her] speak--For though her Eyes have no kind of meaning in  them--she very seldom talks Nonsense.    SURFACE. Nay--nay surely--she has very fine eyes--    LADY TEAZLE. Why so she has--tho' sometimes one fancies there's a little  sort of a squint--    SURFACE. A squint--O fie--Lady Teazle.    LADY TEAZLE. Yes yes--I vow now--come there is a left-handed Cupid in  one eye--that's the Truth on't.    SURFACE. Well--his aim is very direct however--but Lady Sneerwell has  quite corrupted you.    LADY TEAZLE. No indeed--I have not opinion enough of her to be taught  by her, and I know that she has lately rais'd many scandalous hints of  me--which you know one always hears from one common Friend, or other.    SURFACE. Why to say truth I believe you are not more obliged to her than  others of her acquaintance.    LADY TEAZLE. But isn't [it] provoking to hear the most ill-natured  Things said to one and there's my friend Lady Sneerwell has circulated  I don't know how many scandalous tales of me, and all without any  foundation, too; that's what vexes me.    SURFACE. Aye Madam to be sure that is the Provoking  circumstance--without Foundation--yes yes--there's the mortification  indeed--for when a slanderous story is believed against one--there  certainly is no comfort like the consciousness of having deserved it----    LADY TEAZLE. No to be sure--then I'd forgive their malice--but to attack  me, who am really so innocent--and who never say an ill-natured thing of  anybody--that is, of any Friend--! and then Sir Peter too--to have  him so peevish--and so suspicious--when I know the integrity of my own  Heart--indeed 'tis monstrous.    SURFACE. But my dear Lady Teazle 'tis your own fault if you suffer  it--when a Husband entertains a groundless suspicion of his Wife and  withdraws his confidence from her--the original compact is broke and she  owes it to the Honour of her sex to endeavour to outwit him--    LADY TEAZLE. Indeed--So that if He suspects me without cause it follows  that the best way of curing his jealousy is to give him reason for't--    SURFACE. Undoubtedly--for your Husband [should] never be deceived in  you--and in that case it becomes you to be frail in compliment to his  discernment--    LADY TEAZLE. To be sure what you say is very reasonable--and when the  consciousness of my own Innocence----    SURFACE. Ah: my dear--Madam there is the great mistake--'tis this very  conscious Innocence that is of the greatest Prejudice to you--what is  it makes you negligent of Forms and careless of the world's opinion--why  the consciousness of your Innocence--what makes you thoughtless in  your Conduct and apt to run into a thousand little imprudences--why the  consciousness of your Innocence--what makes you impatient of Sir Peter's  temper, and outrageous at his suspicions--why the consciousness of your  own Innocence--    LADY TEAZLE. 'Tis very true.    SURFACE. Now my dear Lady Teazle if you but once make a trifling Faux  Pas you can't conceive how cautious you would grow, and how ready to  humour and agree with your Husband.    LADY TEAZLE. Do you think so--    SURFACE. O I'm sure on't; and then you'd find all scandal would cease  at once--for in short your Character at Present is like a Person in a  Plethora, absolutely dying of too much Health--    LADY TEAZLE. So--so--then I perceive your Prescription is that I  must sin in my own Defence--and part with my virtue to preserve my  Reputation.--    SURFACE. Exactly so upon my credit Ma'am[.]    LADY TEAZLE. Well certainly this is the oddest Doctrine--and the newest  Receipt for avoiding calumny.    SURFACE. An infallible one believe me--Prudence like experience must be  paid for--    LADY TEAZLE. Why if my understanding were once convinced----    SURFACE. Oh, certainly Madam, your understanding SHOULD be  convinced--yes--yes--Heaven forbid I should persuade you to do anything  you THOUGHT wrong--no--no--I have too much honor to desire it--    LADY TEAZLE. Don't--you think we may as well leave Honor out of the  Argument? [Rises.]    SURFACE. Ah--the ill effects of your country education I see still  remain with you.    LADY TEAZLE. I doubt they do indeed--and I will fairly own to you,  that If I could be persuaded to do wrong it would be by Sir Peter's  ill-usage--sooner than your honourable Logic, after all.    SURFACE. Then by this Hand, which He is unworthy of----         Enter SERVANT    Sdeath, you Blockhead--what do you want?    SERVANT. I beg your Pardon Sir, but I thought you wouldn't chuse Sir  Peter to come up without announcing him?    SURFACE. Sir Peter--Oons--the Devil!    LADY TEAZLE. Sir Peter! O Lud! I'm ruined! I'm ruin'd!    SERVANT. Sir, 'twasn't I let him in.    LADY TEAZLE. O I'm undone--what will become of me now Mr. Logick.--Oh!  mercy, He's on the Stairs--I'll get behind here--and if ever I'm so  imprudent again----         [Goes behind the screen--]    SURFACE. Give me that--Book!----         [Sits down--SERVANT pretends to adjust his Hair--]         Enter SIR PETER    SIR PETER. Aye--ever improving himself!--Mr. Surface--    SURFACE. Oh! my dear Sir Peter--I beg your Pardon--[Gaping and throws  away the Book.] I have been dosing [dozing] over a stupid Book! well--I  am much obliged to you for this Call--You haven't been here I believe  since I fitted up this Room--Books you know are the only Things I am a  Coxcomb in--    SIR PETER. 'Tis very neat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19298"],[0,"The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh (#12)"],[1,"the instruments  essential to its administrative activities, in obtaining from royalty  befitting tributes to the excellence of its teachings, and, finally, in  forcing its grievances upon the attention of the representatives of the  highest Tribunal in the civilized world, and in securing from its members  written affirmations that are tantamount to a tacit recognition of its  religious status and to an express declaration of the justice of its  cause.    Circumscribed though its power as a social force may as yet appear, and  however obvious may seem the present ineffectiveness of its  world-embracing program, we, who stand identified with its blessed name,  cannot but marvel at the measure of its achievements if we but compare  them with the modest accomplishments that have marked the rise of the  Dispensations of the past. Where else, if not in the Revelation of  Baha'u'llah, can the unbiased student of comparative religion cite  instances of a claim as stupendous as that which the Author of that Faith  advanced, foes as relentless as those which He faced, a devotion more  sublime than that which He kindled, a life as eventful and as enthralling  as that which He led? Has Christianity or Islam, has any Dispensation that  preceded them, offered instances of such combinations of courage and  restraint, of magnanimity and power, of broad-mindedness and loyalty, as  those which characterized the conduct of the heroes of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah? Where else do we find evidences of a transformation as swift,  as complete, and as sudden, as those effected in the lives of the apostles  of the Bab? Few, indeed, are the instances recorded in any of the  authenticated annals of the religions of the past of a self-abnegation as  complete, a constancy as firm, a magnanimity as sublime, a loyalty as  uncompromising, as those which bore witness to the character of that  immortal band which stands identified with this Divine Revelation--this  latest and most compelling manifestation of the love and the omnipotence  of the Almighty!          Contrast with Religions of the Past      We may vainly search in the records of the earliest beginnings of any of  the recognized religions of the past for episodes as thrilling in their  details, or as far-reaching in their consequences, as those that illumine  the pages of the history of this Faith. The almost incredible  circumstances attending the martyrdom of that youthful Prince of Glory;  the forces of barbaric repression which this tragedy subsequently  released; the manifestations of unsurpassed heroism to which it gave rise;  the exhortations and warnings which have streamed from the pen of the  Divine Prisoner in His Epistles to the potentates of the Church and the  monarchs and rulers of the world; the undaunted loyalty with which our  brethren are battling in Muslim countries with the forces of religious  orthodoxy--these may be reckoned as the most outstanding features of what  the world will come to recognize as the greatest drama in the world's  spiritual history.    I need not recall, in this connection, the unfortunate episodes that have,  admittedly, and to a very great extent, marred the early history of both  Judaism and Islam. Nor is it necessary to stress the damaging effect of  the excesses, the rivalries and divisions, the fanatical outbursts and  acts of ingratitude that are associated with the early development of the  people of Israel and with the militant career of the ruthless pioneers of  the Faith of Muhammad.    It would be sufficient for my purpose to call attention to the great  number of those who, in the first two centuries of the Christian era,  \"purchased an ignominious life by betraying the holy Scriptures into the  hands of the infidels,\" the scandalous conduct of those bishops who were  thereby branded as traitors, the discord of the African Church, the  gradual infiltration into Christian doctrine of the principles of the  Mithraic cult, of the Alexandrian school of thought, of the precepts of  Zoroastrianism and of Grecian philosophy, and the adoption by the churches  of Greece and of Asia of the institutions of provincial synods of a model  which they borrowed from the representative councils of their respective  countries.    How great was the obstinacy with which the Jewish converts among the early  Christians adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors, and how fervent  their eagerness to impose them on the Gentiles! Were not the first fifteen  bishops of Jerusalem all circumcised Jews, and had not the congregation  over which they presided united the laws of Moses with the doctrine of  Christ? Is it not a fact that no more than a twentieth part of the  subjects of the Roman Empire had enlisted themselves under the standard of  Christ before the conversion of Constantine? Was not the ruin of the  Temple, in the city of Jerusalem, and of the public religion of the Jews,  severely felt by the so-called Nazarenes, who persevered, above a century,  in the practice of the Mosaic Law?    How striking the contrast when we remember, in the light of the  afore-mentioned facts, the number of those followers of Baha'u'llah who,  in Persia and the adjoining countries, had enlisted at the time of His  Ascension as the convinced supporters of His Faith! How encouraging to  observe the undeviating loyalty with which His valiant followers are  guarding the purity and integrity of His clear and unequivocal teachings!  How edifying the spectacle of those who are battling with the forces of a  firmly intrenched orthodoxy in their struggle to emancipate themselves  from the fetters of an outworn creed! How inspiring the conduct of those  Muslim followers of Baha'u'llah who view, not with regret or apathy, but  with feelings of unconcealed satisfaction, the deserved chastisement which  the Almighty has inflicted upon those twin institutions of the Sultanate  and the Caliphate, those engines of despotism and sworn enemies of the  Cause of God!          Fundamental Principle of Religious Truth      Let no one, however, mistake my purpose. The Revelation, of which  Baha'u'llah is the source and center, abrogates none of the religions that  have preceded it, nor does it attempt, in the slightest degree, to distort  their features or to belittle their value. It disclaims any intention of  dwarfing any of the Prophets of the past, or of whittling down the eternal  verity of their teachings. It can, in no wise, conflict with the spirit  that animates their claims, nor does it seek to undermine the basis of any  man's allegiance to their cause. Its declared, its primary purpose is to  enable every adherent of these Faiths to obtain a fuller understanding of  the religion with which he stands identified, and to acquire a clearer  apprehension of its purpose. It is neither eclectic in the presentation of  its truths, nor arrogant in the affirmation of its claims. Its teachings  revolve around the fundamental principle that religious truth is not  absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is progressive, not final.  Unequivocally and without the least reservation it proclaims all  established religions to be divine in origin, identical in their aims,  complementary in their functions, continuous in their purpose,  indispensable in their value to mankind.    \"All the Prophets of God,\" asserts Baha'u'llah in the Kitab-i-Iqan, \"abide  in the same tabernacle, soar in the same heaven, are seated upon the same  throne, utter the same speech, and proclaim the same Faith.\" From the  \"beginning that hath no beginning,\" these Exponents of the Unity of God  and Channels of His incessant utterance have shed the light of the  invisible Beauty upon mankind, and will continue, to the \"end that hath no  end,\" to vouchsafe fresh revelations of His might and additional  experiences of His inconceivable glory. To contend that any particular  religion is final, that \"all Revelation is ended, that the portals of  Divine mercy are closed, that from the daysprings of eternal holiness no  sun shall rise again, that the ocean of everlasting bounty is forever  stilled, and that out of the Tabernacle of ancient glory the Messengers of  God have ceased to be made manifest\" would indeed be nothing less than  sheer blasphemy.    \"They differ,\" explains Baha'u'llah in that same epistle, \"only in the  intensity of their revelation and the comparative potency of their light.\"  And this, not by reason of any inherent incapacity of any one of them to  reveal in a fuller measure the glory of the Message with which He has been  entrusted, but rather because of the immaturity and unpreparedness of the  age He lived in to apprehend and absorb the full potentialities latent in  that Faith.    \"Know of a certainty,\" explains Baha'u'llah, \"that in every Dispensation  the light of Divine Revelation has been vouchsafed to men in direct  proportion to their spiritual capacity. Consider the sun. How feeble its  rays the moment it appears above the horizon. How gradually its warmth and  potency increase as it approaches its zenith, enabling meanwhile all  created things to adapt themselves to the growing intensity of its light.  How steadily it declines until it reaches its setting point. Were it, all  of a sudden, to manifest the energies latent within it, it would, no  doubt, cause injury to all created things.... In like manner, if the Sun  of Truth were suddenly to reveal, at the earliest stages of its  manifestation, the full measure of the potencies which the providence of  the Almighty has bestowed upon it, the earth of human understanding would  waste away and be consumed; for men's hearts would neither sustain the  intensity of its revelation, nor be able to mirror forth the radiance of  its light. Dismayed and overpowered, they would cease to exist.\"    It is for this reason, and this reason only, that those who have  recognized the Light of God in this age, claim no finality for the"]]]
