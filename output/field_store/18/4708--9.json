Now place the skin  fur side up, on the lining and adjust it so an equal margin shows on all  sides and pin it in several places to prevent its slipping while sewing  it fast. To do this turn it felt uppermost and sew around just at the  edge of the skin, in the trimming felt, reversing the stitch previously  used. This hides the short stitch outside and if drawn up evenly will  hardly be noticed if a color of thread has been selected corresponding  somewhat to that of the felt.    If an extra nice finish is desired the lining may be put on with a  decorative briar or cat stitch with some bright colored silkatine.    Brushing away any clay from around the eyes and nose, giving the latter  a touch of the proper color (black for the majority of animals). A coat  of thin shellac to simulate the natural moist appearance and connecting  the dried eyelids with the glass eyes with hot colored wax will about  complete the rug. Waxing around the eyes is done with a small round  artist's brush and adds to the finished appearance of a job.    In mounting a rug head with either full head, closed or open mouth, the  beginner had best use a head form from the dealer for a few times at  least. A little study of one of these will enable him to model an open  mouth head, when a good set of teeth are supplied, and the ready made  article not at hand. It requires considerable time and some natural  ability to set the teeth and model the gums and tongue effectively.    A tongue modeled with clay and tow, covered with several layers of  papier mache and when dry, coated with flesh colored wax is good enough  for any rug, though museum mounting might require that the tongue be  skinned and the skin used to cover the model.    Plaster, putty, papier mache and various plastic cement materials are  used for modeling mouths, of which papier mache is probably the best;  plaster paris is often used in an emergency but is brittle and heavy.  For modeling use finely ground paper pulp mixed with glue and plaster or  whiting. Only practice and experiment will determine just the precise  mixture wanted.    A paper half head form may be the basis and to this wire the jaw bones  with their sets of teeth. Clever work will reproduce the interior of the  mouth, gums and tongue, and when perfectly dry they should be finished  either with paint or colored wax.    The tongue should have its base and lower side coated with glue and have  a brad driven through it into the material between the lower jaw bones.  If the head of this brad is well set in, a drop or two of wax will cover  it.    [Illustration: COYOTE RUG, OPEN MOUTH    (Author's Work.)]    In preparing a skin for mounting an open mouth head the lips should be  pared down and preserved as far as possible as they are to be filled  out and attached to the form by pinning at their edges. Common toilet  pins are used for this, driving them in part way and when the work is  dry cutting them off close down to the surface. After this is done the  lips may be waxed thus joining them to the form completely. Never fear  to use plenty of pins in head mounting. In some places they may be  driven to the head and left covered by the fur, in other places where  there is little or no fur, cut them close and drive down flush.    Of course greater liberties may be taken with a rug skin than one  mounted entire for exhibition, still a competent artist can put a great  amount of expression in even a rug head. The close student of animal  anatomy can produce an appalling snarl of anger on the heads of the  larger carnivora or change the same to a sleepy yawn or grin in a few  minutes' manipulation.    The professional is often called in to repair damaged rugs and  especially those with open mouths. Here the operator must use his own  judgment as no two seem to demand the same treatment. Missing teeth may  have to be supplied and carved from bone, celluloid or antlers. The tips  of broken deer antlers make very good canine teeth and blocks of  celluloid which are much easier to shape than bone, are sold by supply  dealers.    I have dwelt at some length on rug making as it is a branch of taxidermy  which seems to be always in more or less demand with the public. Also it  forms an easy entrance to the more complicated mounting of complete  animals and much of the work is identical with the process of preserving  heads for wall decoration.          CHAPTER XIII.    FUR ROBES AND HOW TO MAKE THEM.      While not usually classed as taxidermy the making and repairing of robes  will bring in many a dollar to the worker in the middle and northern  states. A stitch in time (on a robe) often saves more than the  proverbial nine, and the better the quality the more anxious the owner  to have it put in good order.    The late lamented bison furnished the robe par excellence, few of which  pass through the hands of the taxidermist nowadays. Their place has, in  some degree, been taken by the Galloway and other cattle hides, which  also make a practically one piece robe of good weight leather. These are  too heavy for economical dressing by hand, but the regular tanning  concerns will dress them soft, pliable, and clean for a very reasonable  price.    The regular robe makers do much of their work with the heavy overstitch  sewing machines, but it can be done as well or better by hand at the  expense of more time. Many of the smaller skins, as coyote, raccoon,  fox, opossum, and wild cat make up as handsome carriage robes and sell  at remunerative prices.    Skins of an inferior lustre or that are mutilated are often used. For  instance, the skin of the head may be mounted separately and not  interfere with using the balance in a robe. For use in a robe skins  should be taken off open and stretched in a rectangular shape as near as  possible.    After tanning, sew up all cuts and holes in the skins, dampen the flesh  side with clear water and tack out fur side down on the floor, table  top, or better still on light boards cleated together which may be set  on edge against the wall out of the way. In all sewing on rugs and robes  be sure and use a substantial thread well drawn up, fine stitches are  not essential but good material is, as such things come in for a deal of  rough use unlike mounted specimens which are, or should be seldom  handled. Glovers triangular needles and gilling or carpet thread of  suitable sizes are the necessary tools.    Skins of approximately the same size should be used in making up a robe  or the effect will be bad. After stretching and drying, cut them to  rectangular shape, taking care to get the darker line down the back in  the center of each. A good way is to cut a piece of cardboard to the  required size and mark around it. Gaps in front of and behind the legs  may be filled by sewing in small pieces rather than cut down the skins  too much. The drawing shows coon skin marked to cut for robe. The skin  is poorly stretched yet there are many even worse, altho trappers are  learning to handle the skins in better shape.    [Illustration: COON MARKED TO CUT FOR ROBE]    After the necessary number of skins are cut out they are sewed together  in rows and the rows in turn sewed to each other like a patchwork quilt,  taking care to have the fur all run the same way. The robe should now be  dampened again and stretched and tacked to its full extent to remove any  wrinkles and flatten the seams. This sewing is all done from the back of  the robe using an even over-hand stitch. Just before the final  stretching it is well to apply arsenical solution to the damp skins.    On drying it is ready for the trimming and lining. Sometimes it is  necessary to turn over the upper edge of the skins and baste it down or  it may show the raw edge of the hides on account of the fur laying all  one way.    Strips of felt 3 in. wide, pinked on one edge are used for trimming, and  may be had from the dealers, ready to use, or we can buy the felt by the  yard and easily pink it in the work room. Any one doing much robe work  would find a pinking machine (price about $5.00) a good investment, but  the small hand iron does just as good work.    [Illustration: STRONG HIDE (CATTLE) LAP ROBE.]    A double border of contrasting colors may be used, the upper strip of  which should be 3/4 inch narrower. The border is sewed on from the back  with heavy thread, using the same stitch as that for the lining rugs. An  interlining of cotton wadding is basted in place before the lining is  sewed on. Plush or beaver cloth is to be had in 54 and 60 inch widths  and a variety of colors, of which the darker greens, browns, and blacks  are to be preferred.    Fur robes are usually 48x60; 54x66; 60x70; or 60x84 inches in size, so  linings of the above widths cut without waste.    Single cattle or horse hides may be left with the edges merely  straightened or they may be cut and pieced to regular robe shape. The  bushy tails of such animals as wolf or fox are sometimes used along one  side or both ends as a fringe.    The number of skins required to make a robe are as follows:        Raccoon                    12 to 20      Coyote, wolf or dog         6 to 10      Wild cat                   12 to 16      Woodchuck or opossum       20 to 30      Goat                        4 to  8    Baby carriage robes of angora or lamb skins are lined with quilted satin  and trimmed with felt of some light shade. They usually have either an  opening for the head and shoulders or a pocket for the feet.    [Illustration: COYOTE LAP ROBE, 8 SKINS.    Note tails in center.]    The natives of Patagonia make up many robes of the guanaco and vicuna,  dressing the skins and sewing them together with sinew. Their dressing  is faulty as the skins are apt to stiffen and crack and the sinew  hardens with time until it becomes like wire, though the stitching is  wonderfully even. They have, however, worked out a scheme of joining the  skins in a way to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23280"],[0,"The Shirley Letters from California Mines in 1851-52 (#12)"],[1,"a bunk, though I have no remembrance of it, and  he said that when he offered me some food, I turned from it with  disgust, exclaiming, \"Oh, take it away! give me some cold water and let  me _sleep_, and be sure you don't wake me for the next three weeks.\"  And I _did_ sleep, with a forty slumber-power; and when F. came to me  late in the evening with some tea and toast, I awoke, oh! _so_  refreshed, and perfectly well, for, after all the great fuss which I  had made, there was nothing the matter with me but a little fatigue.    Every one that we met congratulated us upon not having encountered any  Indians, for the paths which we followed were Indian trails, and it is  said they would have killed us for our mules and clothes. A few weeks  ago a Frenchman and his wife were murdered by them. I had thought of  the circumstances when we camped, but was too sick to care what  happened. They generally take women captive, however; and who knows how  narrowly I escaped becoming an Indian chieftainess, and feeding for the  rest of my life upon roasted grasshoppers, acorns, and flower-seeds? By  the way, the last-mentioned article of food strikes me as rather  poetical than otherwise.    After a good night's rest we are perfectly well, and as happy as the  day itself,--which was one of Heaven's own choosing,--and rode to the  \"Wild Yankee's,\" where we breakfasted, and had, among other dainties,  fresh butter and cream.    Soon after we alighted, a _herd_ of Indians, consisting of about a  dozen men and squaws, with an unknown quantity of papooses,--the last  naked as the day they were born,--crowded into the room to stare at us.  It was the most amusing thing in the world to see them finger my  gloves, whip, and hat, in their intense curiosity. One of them had  caught the following line of a song, \"O, carry me back to old  Martinez,\" with which he continued to stun our ears all the time we  remained, repeating it over and over with as much pride and joy as a  mocking-bird exhibits when he has learned a new sound.    On this occasion I was more than ever struck with what I have often  remarked before,--the extreme beauty of the _limbs_ of the Indian  women of California. Though for haggardness of expression and ugliness  of feature they might have been taken for a band of Macbethian witches,  a bronze statue of Cleopatra herself never folded more beautifully  rounded arms above its dusky bosom, or poised upon its pedestal a  slenderer ankle or a more statuesque foot, than those which gleamed  from beneath the dirty blankets of these wretched creatures. There was  one exception, however, to the general hideousness of their faces. A  girl of sixteen, perhaps, with those large, magnificently lustrous, yet  at the same time soft, eyes, so common in novels, so rare in real life,  had shyly glided like a dark, beautiful spirit into the corner of the  room. A fringe of silken jet swept heavily upward from her dusky cheek,  athwart which the richest color came and went like flashes of  lightning. Her flexible lips curved slightly away from teeth like  strips of cocoanut meat, with a mocking grace infinitely bewitching.  She wore a cotton chemise,--disgustingly dirty, I must confess,--girt  about her slender waist with a crimson handkerchief, while over her  night-black hair, carelessly knotted beneath the rounded chin, was a  purple scarf of knotted silk. Her whole appearance was picturesque in  the extreme. She sat upon the ground with her pretty brown fingers  languidly interlaced above her knee, \"round as a _period_,\" (as a  certain American poet has so funnily said of a similar limb in his  Diana,) and smiled up into my face as if we were the dearest friends.    I was perfectly enraptured with this wildwood Cleopatra, and bored F.  almost beyond endurance with exclamations about her starry eyes, her  chiseled limbs, and her beautiful nut-brown cheeks.    I happened to take out of my pocket a paper of pins, when all the women  begged for some of them. This lovely child still remained silent in the  posture of exquisite grace which she had so unconsciously assumed, but,  nevertheless, she looked as pleased as any of them when I gave her,  also, a row of the much-coveted treasures. But I found I had got myself  into business, for all the men wanted pins too, and I distributed the  entire contents of the papers which I happened to have in my pocket,  before they were satisfied, much to the amusement of F., who only  laughs at what he is pleased to call my absurd interest in these poor  creatures; but you know, M., I always _did_ \"take\" to Indians, though  it must be said that those who bear that name here have little resemblance  to the glorious forest heroes that live in the Leatherstocking tales,  and in spite of my desire to find in them something poetical and  interesting, a stern regard for truth compels me to acknowledge that  the dusky beauty above described is the only even moderately _pretty_  squaw that I have ever seen.    At noon we stopped at the Buckeye Rancho for about an hour, and then  pushed merrily on for the Pleasant Valley Rancho, which we expected to  reach about sundown. Will you, _can_ you, believe that we got lost  again? Should you travel over this road, you would not be at all  surprised at the repetition of this misfortune. Two miles this side of  Pleasant Valley, which is very large, there is a wide, bare plain of  red stones which one is compelled to cross in order to reach it, and I  should not think that even in the daytime any one but an Indian could  keep the trail in this place. It was here that, just at dark, we  probably missed the path, and entered, about the center of the valley,  at the opposite side of an extensive grove from that on which the  rancho is situated. When I first began to suspect that we might  possibly have to camp out another night, I Caudleized at a great rate,  but when it became a fixed fact that such was our fate, I was instantly  as mute and patient as the Widow Prettyman when she succeeded to the  throne of the venerated woman referred to above. Indeed, feeling  perfectly well, and not being much fatigued, I should rather have  enjoyed it, had not F., poor fellow, been so grieved at the idea of my  going supperless to a moss-stuffed couch. It was a long time before I  could coax him to give up searching for the rancho, and, in truth, I  should think that we rode round that part of the valley in which we  found ourselves, for more than two hours, trying to find it.    About eleven o'clock we went back into the woods and camped for the  night. Our bed was quite comfortable, and my saddle made an excellent  pillow. Being so much higher in the mountains, we were a little chilly,  and I was disturbed two or three times by a distant noise, which I have  since been told was the growling of grizzly bears, that abounded in  that vicinity. On the whole, we passed a comfortable night, and rose at  sunrise feeling perfectly refreshed and well. In less than an hour we  were eating breakfast at the Pleasant Valley Rancho, which we easily  discovered by daylight.    Here they informed us that \"we had escaped a great marcy,\" as old Jim  used to say in relating his successful run from a wolf, inasmuch as the  grizzlies had not devoured us during the night! But, seriously, dear  M., my heart thrills with gratitude to the Father for his tender care  of us during that journey, which, view it as lightly as we may, was  certainly attended with _some_ danger.    Notwithstanding we had endured so much fatigue, I felt as well as ever  I did, and after breakfast insisted upon pursuing our journey, although  F. anxiously advised me to defer it until next day. But imagine the  horror, the _creme de la creme_ of borosity, of remaining for twelve  mortal hours of wakefulness in a filthy, uncomfortable, flea-haunted  shanty, without books or papers, when Rich Bar--easily attainable  before night, through the loveliest scenery, shining in the yellow  splendor of an autumnal morn--lay before us! _I_ had no idea of any  such absurd self-immolation. So we again started on our strange,  eventful journey.    I wish I could give you some faint idea of the majestic solitudes  through which we passed,--where the pine-trees rise so grandly in their  awful height, that they seem to look into heaven itself. Hardly a  living thing disturbed this solemnly beautiful wilderness. Now and then  a tiny lizard glanced in and out among the mossy roots of the old  trees, or a golden butterfly flitted languidly from blossom to blossom.  Sometimes a saucy little squirrel would gleam along the somber trunk of  some ancient oak, or a bevy of quail, with their pretty tufted heads  and short, quick tread, would trip athwart our path. Two or three  times, in the radiant distance, we descried a stately deer, which,  framed in by embowering leaves, and motionless as a tableau, gazed at  us for a moment with its large, limpid eyes, and then bounded away with  the speed of light into the evergreen depths of those glorious old  woods.    Sometimes we were compelled to cross broad plains, acres in extent,  called chaparrals, covered with low shrubs, which, leafless and  barkless, stand like vegetable skeletons along the dreary waste. You  cannot imagine what a weird effect these eldrich bushes had upon my  mind. Of a ghastly whiteness, they at first reminded me of a plantation  of antlers, and I amused myself by fancying them a herd of crouching  deer; but they grew so wan and ghastly, that I began to look forward to  the creeping across a chaparral (it is no easy task for the mules to  wind through them) with almost a feeling of dread.    But what a lovely sight greeted our enchanted eyes as we stopped for a  few moments on the summit of the hill leading into Rich Bar! Deep in  the shadowy nooks of the far-down valleys, like wasted jewels dropped  from the radiant sky above, lay half a dozen blue-bosomed lagoons,"]]]
