Such imitations are costly, though, of  course, not approaching the value of the real stones; it being no  uncommon thing for valuable jewels to be duplicated in paste, whilst the  originals are kept in the strong room of a bank or safe-deposit.    In all cases, however, a hard file will abrade the surface of the false  stone. In chapter VII. we found that quartz is in the seventh degree of  hardness, and an ordinary file is but a shade harder than this, so that  almost all stones higher than No. 7 are unaffected by a file unless it  is used roughly, so as to break a sharp edge. In order to prepare  artificial diamonds and other stones for the file and various tests,  they are often what is called \"converted\" into \"doublets\" or \"triplets.\"  These are made as follows: the body of the glass is of paste, and on the  \"table\" (see last chapter), and perhaps on the broader facets, there  will be placed a very thin slab of the real stone, attached by cement.  In the case of the diamond, the body is clear, but in the coloured  imitations the paste portion is made somewhat lighter in shade than the  real stone would be, the portion below the girdle being coloured  chemically, or mounted in a coloured backing. Such a stone will, of  course, stand most tests, for the parts usually tested are genuine.    A stone of this nature is called a \"doublet,\" and it is evident that  when it is tested on the underside, it will prove too soft, therefore  the \"triplet\" has been introduced. This is exactly on the lines of the  doublet, except that the collet and perhaps the pavilions are covered  also, so that the girdle, which is generally encased by the mounting,  is the only surface-portion of paste. In other cases the whole of the  crown is genuine, whilst often both the upper and lower portions are  solid and genuine, the saving being effected by using a paste centre at  the girdle, covered by the mounting. Such a stone as this last mentioned  is often difficult to detect without using severe tests and desperate  means, e.g.:--(a) by its crystalline structure (see Chapter III.);  (b) by the cleavage planes (see Chapter IV.); (c) by the polariscope  (see Chapter V.); (d) by the dichroscope (see Chapter VI.); (e) by  specific gravity (see Chapter VIII.); (f) cutting off the mounting,  and examining the girdle; (g) soaking the stone for a minute or so in  a mixture said to have been originally discovered by M. D. Rothschild,  and composed of hydrofluoric acid and ammonia; this will not answer for  all stones, but is safe to use for the diamond and a few others. Should  the jewel be glass, it will be etched, if not completely destroyed, but  if genuine, no change will be apparent; (h) soaking the diamond for a  few minutes in warm or cold water, in alcohol, in chloroform, or in all  these in turn, when, if a doublet, or triplet, it will tumble to pieces  where joined together by the cement, which will have been dissolved. It  is, however, seldom necessary to test so far, for an examination under  the microscope, even with low power, is usually sufficient to detect in  the glass the air-bubbles which are almost inseparable from  glass-mixtures, though they do not detract from the physical properties  of the glass. The higher powers of the same instrument will almost  always define the junction and the layer or layers of cement, no matter  how delicate a film may have been used. Any one of these tests is  sufficient to isolate a false stone.    Some of the softer genuine stones may be fused together with splinters,  dust, and cuttings of the same stones, and of this product is formed a  larger stone, which, though manufactured, is essentially perfectly real,  possessing exactly the same properties as a naturally formed stone. Many  such stones are obtained as large as an ordinary pin's head, and are  much used commercially for cluster-work in rings, brooches, for  watch-jewels, scarf-pins, and the like, and are capable of being cut and  polished exactly like an original stone. This is a means of using up to  great advantage the lapidary's dust, and though these products are real  stones, perhaps a little more enriched in colour chemically, they are  much cheaper than a natural stone of the same size and weight.    Some spurious stones have their colour improved by heat, by being tinged  on the outside, by being tinted throughout with a fixed colour and  placed in a clear setting; others, again, have a setting of a different  hue, so that the reflection of this shall give additional colour and  fire to the stone. For instance, glass diamonds are often set with the  whole of the portion below the girdle hidden, this part of the stone  being silvered like a mirror. Others are set open, being held at the  girdle only, the portion covered by the setting being silvered. Other  glass imitations, such as the opal, have a tolerably good representation  of the \"fiery\" opal given to them by the admixture, in the glass, of a  little oxide of tin, which makes it somewhat opalescent, and in the  setting is placed a backing of red, gold, copper, or fiery-coloured  tinsel, whilst the glass itself, at the back, is painted very thinly  with a paint composed of well washed and dried fish-scales, reduced to  an impalpable powder, mixed with a little pure, refined mastic, or other  colourless varnish. This gives a good imitation of phosphorescence, as  well as a slight pearliness, whilst the tinsel, seen through the paint  and the curious milkiness of the glass, gives good \"fire.\"    A knowledge of the colours natural to precious stones and to jewels  generally is of great service in their rough classification for testing,  even though some stones are found in a variety of colours. An  alphabetical list of the most useful is here appended, together with  their average specific gravities and hardness.

You let me do the talking. She won't have a word to  say when I'm through.\"    \"Hush, Jerry!\" cautioned Irma. \"She'll hear you.\"    They were now entering Miss Archer's living-room office. Marcia Arnold,  who was seated before her desk, intent on the book she held in her hand,  raised her eyes and regarded the quartette with a displeased frown. Then  she addressed them in peremptory tones.    \"Please make less noise, girls. Your voices can be plainly heard in Miss  Archer's office and she is too busy now to be disturbed.\" This last with  a view to discouraging any attempt on their part to see the principal.    \"We didn't come to see Miss Archer,\" was Geraldine Macy's calm retort.  \"We came to see you about Miss Dean's and Miss Stevens' invitations for  the dance. They haven't received them.\"    \"I know nothing whatever about them,\" snapped Miss Arnold, picking up  her book as a sign of dismissal.    \"You ought to know. The invitations were given to you by the boys'  committee,\" was Jerry's pertinent reminder. \"You sent them the list of  names, didn't you? Perhaps you accidentally left out these two names.\"    This was a malicious afterthought on Jerry's part, but it had a potent  effect on Marcia Arnold. A tide of red rose to her sallow face. For a  second her eyes wavered from the four pairs searchingly upon her. Then  she answered with elaborate carelessness: \"It is just possible that  these two names have been omitted. I will go over my list and see.\"    \"Yes, do,\" advised Jerry, laconically. Then she slyly added: \"It seems  funny, doesn't it, that when 'D' and 'S' are so far apart on the  alphabetical list, they should both happen to be overlooked? If the  girls don't receive their invitations by to-morrow night I'll speak to  my brother about it. He's the president of the junior class, you know,  and he'll take it up with the committee. Come on, girls.\"    The three young women obediently following her, Jerry marched from the  room with the air of a conqueror. True to her prediction, Marcia Arnold  had found nothing to say to the stout girl's parting shot.    \"There really wasn't much use in our going. I'm afraid we weren't very  brave. We shouldn't have stood like wooden images and let you fight our  battles, Jerry. It was awfully dear in you, but I do hope Miss Arnold  won't think Constance and I are babies,\" demurred Marjorie.    \"What do you care what she thinks as long as she hunts up your  invitations?\" asked Jerry, with superb contempt. \"What she thinks will  never hurt either of you.\"    The belated invitations were delivered to the two freshmen by Miss  Arnold herself the next day, greatly to Jerry's satisfaction.    \"I saw her give them to you, girls,\" she whispered to Marjorie on the  way to the English class. \"She looked mad as a hatter, too. She thought  she'd hold back your invitations until the last minute; then maybe you  would get mad and not go to the dance.\"    \"But why should she wish to keep us from going?\" asked Marjorie,  wonderingly.    \"Ask Mignon,\" was Jerry's enigmatical answer. \"Very likely she knows  more about it than anyone else.\"    Marjorie found no chance for conversation with Constance until they met  in French class. Even then she had only time to say, \"Be sure to wait  for me this noon,\" before Professor Fontaine called his class to order  and attacked the advance lesson with his usual Latin ardor.    Constance was first at their locker. She had already put on her own hat  and coat and was holding Marjorie's for her, when her friend arrived.    \"What are you going to wear, Constance?\" asked Marjorie, as she put on  her coat and hat.    \"I'm not going,\" was the brief answer.    \"Not going!\" Marjorie stared hard at her friend. Was Constance hurt  because she had not received her invitation? Then she went on, eagerly  apologetic: \"It wasn't the Weston boys' fault that we didn't get our  invitations when the others received theirs. They didn't intend to leave  us out, even though they only knew our names.\"    \"It's not that.\" Constance's voice trembled a little. \"I--I--well, I  haven't a dress fit to wear!\" Her pale cheeks grew pink with shame as  she burst forth with this confession of poverty. \"This blue suit and  three house dresses are all the clothes I have in the world. Don't say  you feel sorry for me. I shall hate you if you do. I sha'n't always be  poor. Some day,\" her eyes grew dreamy, \"I'll have all sorts of lovely  clothes. When I am a----\" She stopped abruptly, then said in her usual  half-sullen tones, \"I can't go, so don't ask me.\"    Marjorie looked curiously at this strange girl. The longer she knew  Constance the better she liked her, but she did not in the least  understand her. Suddenly a bright idea popped into her head. \"I'm so  sorry you can't go to the dance,\" she commented, then promptly dropped  the subject. When she left Constance, however, she remarked innocently:  \"Don't forget, you are coming home with me to-night. Don't say you can't.  You promised, you know.\"    \"I will come,\" promised Constance, brightening. \"Good-bye.\"    The moment Marjorie reached home she made a dash for her room and going  to her closet, emerged a moment afterward with an immense white  pasteboard box in her arms. Stopping only long enough to drop her wraps  on her bed she ran downstairs and burst into the dining-room with: \"I  have found her, Mother. I've found the girl this was made for.\"    \"What is all this commotion about, Lieutenant?\" asked her father,  teasingly. \"Are we about to be attacked by the enemy? Salute your  superior officers and then state your case. Discipline must be preserved  at all costs in the army. Is it a requisition for new uniforms? You  soldiers are dreadfully hard on your clothes. Or is the post about to  move and is that a packing case?\"    Marjorie made a most unsoldierlike rush for him and, throwing her arms  about his neck, kissed his cheek. \"You are a great big tease, and I  choose to salute you this way.\" Then she kissed her mother, saying:  \"I've the loveliest plan, Captain. I'm sure that this dress will fit  Constance. She says she won't go to the school dance because she has no  pretty gown to wear. May I give her this darling blue one?\" She opened  the box and drew forth a dainty frock of pale blue chiffon over silk.  The chiffon was caught up here and there with tiny clusters of  pinky-white rosebuds. The round neck was just low enough to show to  advantage a white girlish throat, while the soft, fluffy sleeves reached  barely to the elbows. It was a particularly beautiful and appropriate  frock for a young girl.    \"You see, General,\" explained Marjorie, \"Aunt Mary sent this to me when  I graduated from grammar school. She hadn't seen me for two years and  didn't know I had grown so fast. She bought it ready made in one of the  New York stores. It was too short and too tight for me and to make it  over meant simply to spoil it. It was so sweet in her to send it that  when I wrote my thank you to her I couldn't bear to tell her that it  didn't fit, so I kept it just to look at. I didn't really need it, for,  thanks to you and mother, I have plenty of others. Don't you think I  ought to make someone else happy when I have the chance? It is right to  share one's spoils with a comrade, isn't it?\"    Her father looked lovingly at the pretty, earnest face of his daughter  as she stood holding up the filmy gown, her eyes bright with unselfish  purpose. \"I am very glad my little girl is so thoughtful of others,\" he  said. \"Whatever your captain says is law. How about it, Captain?\" His  wife and he exchanged glances.    \"You may give your friend the dress if you like, dear,\" consented Mrs.  Dean, \"if you think she will accept it.\"    \"That's just the point, Captain,\" returned Marjorie. \"You know you said  I could bring Constance home for dinner to-night, and she is coming.  Perhaps we can think of some nice way to give it to her while she is  here.\"    Marjorie carefully replaced the gown in its box and ran upstairs with  it. She returned with her hat and coat on her arm, and hanging them on  the hall rack hastened to eat her luncheon.    All afternoon she puzzled as to how she might best offer Constance the  gown. When the four girls strolled homeward together after school she  had still not thought of a way. Jerry and Irma held forth, at length,  with true schoolgirl eloquence, upon the subject of their gowns.  Constance listened gravely without comment. Her small, impassive face  showed no sign of her hopeless longing for the pretty things she had  never possessed.    Once inside the Dean's pleasant home, a flash of appreciation routed her  impassivity as Marjorie conducted her into the comfortable living-room  where Mrs. Dean sat reading, and her face softened under the spell of  the older woman's gentle greeting.    \"I am pleased to know you, Constance,\" said Mrs. Dean, offering her  hand. \"I have been expecting you for some time. Now that I have seen you  I will say that you do look very much like Marjorie's friend Mary.\" She  did not add that this girl's face lacked the good-natured, happy  expression that so perfectly matched Mary Raymond's sunny curls. Yet she  noted that the blue eyes met hers openly and frankly, and that there was  an undeniable air of sincerity and truth about Constance which caused  one instinctively to trust her.    To the formerly friendless girl who had never before been invited to the  home of a Sanford girl, the evening passed like a dream. Under the  genial atmosphere of the Dean household, her reserve melted and before  dinner was over she had forgotten all about herself and was laughing  merrily with Marjorie over Mr. Dean's nonsense. After dinner Mrs. Dean  played on the piano and Constance, who knew how to dance was initiated  into the mysteries of several new steps which were favorites of the  Franklin girls,"]]]
