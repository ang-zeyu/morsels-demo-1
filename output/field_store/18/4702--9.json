I wus too small to work any but I played in de yard wid my  oldes' sister, Katie. She is dead long ago. My mother belonged to ole  man John Griffith an' I belonged to him. His plantation wus down here at  Auburn in Wake County. My father wus named Edmund Rand. He belonged to  Mr. Nat Rand. He lived in Auburn. De plantations wus not fur apart. Dere  wus about twenty-five slaves on de plantation whur mother an' me  stayed.    Marse John used ter take me on his knee an' sing, 'Here is de hammer,  Shing ding. Gimme de Hammer, shing ding.' Marster loved de nigger  chilluns on his plantation. When de war ended father come an' lived with  us at Marse John's plantation. Marster John Griffith named me Emmy. My  grandfather on my fathers side wus named Harden Rand, an' grandmother  wus named Mason Rand. My grandfather on my mother's side wus named Antny  Griffiths an' grandmother wus named Nellie.    Our food wus a plenty and well cooked. Marster fed his niggers good. We  had plenty of homespun dresses and we got shoes once a year, at  Christmas Eve. I ken 'member it just as good. We got Christmas Holidays  an' a stockin' full of candy an' peanuts. Sometimes we got ginger snaps  at Christmas. My grandmother cooked' em. She wus a good cook. My  mother's missus wus Miss Jetsy Griffith and my father's missus wus Lucy  Rand. Dey wus both mighty good women. You know I am ole. I ken 'member  all dem good white folks. Dey give us Fourth July Holidays. Dey come to  town on dat day. Dey wore, let me tell you what dey wore, dey wore  dotted waist blouses an' white pants. Dat wus a big day to ever'body, de  Fourth of July. Dey begun singing at Auburn an' sung till dey reached  Raleigh. Auburn is nine miles from Raleigh. Dere wus a lot of lemonade.  Dey made light bread in big ovens an' had cheese to eat wid it. Some  said just goin' on de fofe to git lemonade an' cheese.    In the winter we had a lot of possums to eat an' a lot of rabbits too.  At Christmas time de men hunted and caught plenty game. We barbecued it  before de fire. I 'members seein' mother an' grandmother swinging  rabbits 'fore de fire to cook 'em. Dey would turn an' turn 'em till dey  wus done. Dey hung some up in de chimbly an' dry 'em out an' keep 'em a  long time an' dat is de reason I won't eat a rabbit today. No Sir! I  won't eat a rabbit. I seed 'em mess wid 'em so much turned me 'ginst  eatin' 'em.    I don't know how much lan' Marster John owned but, Honey, dat wus some  plantation. It reached from Auburn to de Neuse River. Yes Sir, it did,  'cause I been down dere in corn hillin' time an' we fished at twelve  o'clock in Neuse River. Marster John had overseers. Dere wus six of 'em.  Dey rode horses over de fields but I don't 'member dere names.    I never seen a slave whupped but dey wus whupped on de plantation an' I  heard de grown folks talkin' 'bout it. My uncles Nat an' Bert Griffiths  wus both whupped. Uncle Nat would not obey his missus rules an' she had  him whupped. Dey whupped Uncle Bert 'cause he stayed drunk so much. He  loved his licker an' he got drunk an' cut up bad, den dey whupped him.  You could git plenty whiskey den. Twon't like it is now. No sir, it  won't. Whiskey sold fur ten cents a quart. Most ever' body drank it but  you hardly ever seed a man drunk. Slaves wus not whupped for drinkin'.  Dere Marsters give 'em whiskey but dey wus whupped for gittin' drunk.  Dere wus a jail, a kind of stockade built of logs, on de farm to put  slaves in when dey wouldn't mind. I never say any slave put on de block  an' sold, but I saw Aunt Helen Rand cryin' because her Marster Nat Rand  sold her boy, Fab Rand.    No Sir, no readin' an' writin'. You had to work. Ha! ha! You let your  marster or missus ketch you wid a book. Dat wus a strict rule dat no  learnin' wus to be teached. I can't read an' write. If it wus not fur my  mother wit don't know what would become of me. We had prayer meetings  around at de slave houses. I 'member it well. We turned down pots on de  inside of de house at de door to keep marster an' missus from hearin' de  singin' an' prayin'. Marster an' his family lived in de great house an'  de slave quarters wus 'bout two hundred yards away to the back of de  great house. Dey wus arranged in rows. When de war ended we all stayed  on wid de families Griffiths an' Rands till dey died, dat is all 'cept  my father an' me. He lef' an' I lef'. I been in Raleigh forty-five  years. I married Mack Blalock in Raleigh. He been dead seven years.    My mother had two boys, Antny an' Wesley. She had four girls, Katie,  Grissie, Mary Ella an' Emma. I had three chilluns, two are livin' yet.  They both live in Raleigh.    We had big suppers an' dinners at log rollin's an' corn shuckin's in  slavery time ha! ha! plenty of corn licker for ever'body, both white an'  black. Ever'body helped himself. Dr. Tom Busbee, one good ole white man,  looked after us when we got sick, an' he could make you well purty  quick, 'cause he wus good an' 'cause he wus sorry fer you. He wus a  feelin' man. Course we took erbs. I tell you what I took. Scurrey grass,  chana balls dey wus for worms. Scurrey grass worked you out. Dey give us  winter green to clense our blood. We slaves an' a lot of de white folks  drank sassafras tea in de place of coffee. We sweetened it wid brown  sugar, honey, or molasses, just what we had in dat line. I think slavery  wus a right good thing. Plenty to eat an' wear.    When you gits a tooth pulled now it costs two dollars, don't it? Well  in slavery time I had a tooth botherin' me. My mother say, Emma, take  dis egg an' go down to Doctor Busbee an' give it to him an' git your  tooth pulled. I give him one egg. He took it an' pulled my tooth. Try  dat now, if you wants to an' see what happens. Yes, slavery wus a purty  good thing.          N. C. District:     No. 2               [320165]  Worker:             Mary A.

A. Blount, who  owned plantations in several parts of North Carolina.      Yes mam, de days on de plantation wuz de happy days. De marster made us  wuck through de week but on Sadays we uster go swimmin' in de riber an'  do a lot of other things dat we lak ter do.    We didn't mind de wuck so much case de ground wuz soft as ashes an' de  marster let us stop and rest when we got tired. We planted 'taters in de  uplan's and co'n in de lowgroun's nex' de riber. It wuz on de Cape Fear  an' on hot days when we wuz a-pullin' de fodder we'd all stop wuck 'bout  three o'clock in de ebenin' an' go swimmin'.

Dedham  shares in the town often fell into the hands of speculators, and  Sheldon, the careful historian of Deerfield, declares that not a single  Dedham man became a permanent resident of the grant. In 1678 Deerfield  petitioned the General Court as follows:         You may be pleased to know that the very principle & best of       the land; the best for soile; the best for situation; as lying       in y{e} centre & midle of the town: & as to quantity, nere       half, belongs unto eight or 9 proprietors each and every of       which, are never like to come to a settlement amongst us,       which we have formerly found grievous & doe Judge for the       future will be found intollerable if not altered. O{r}       minister, Mr. Mather . . . & we ourselves are much discouraged       as judging the Plantation will be spoiled if thes proprietors       may not be begged, or will not be bought up on very easy terms       outt of their Right . . . Butt as long as the maine of the       plantation Lies in men's hands that can't improve it       themselves, neither are ever like to putt such tenants on to       it as shall be likely to advance the good of y{e} place in       Civill or sacred Respects; he, ourselves, and all others that       think of going to it, are much discouraged.[59:1]    Woodstock, later a Connecticut town, was settled under a grant in the  Nipmuc country made to the town of Roxbury. The settlers, who located  their farms near the trading post about which the Indians still  collected, were called the \"go-ers,\" while the \"stayers\" were those who  remained in Roxbury, and retained half of the new grant; but it should  be added that they paid the go-ers a sum of money to facilitate the  settlement.    This absentee proprietorship and the commercial attitude toward the  lands of new towns became more evident in succeeding years of the  eighteenth century. Leicester, for example, was confirmed by the General  Court in 1713. The twenty shares were divided among twenty-two  proprietors, including Jeremiah Dummer, Paul Dudley (Attorney-General),  William Dudley (like Paul a son of the Governor, Joseph Dudley), Thomas  Hutchinson (father of the later Governor), John Clark (the political  leader), and Samuel Sewall (son of the Chief Justice). These were all  men of influence, and none of the proprietors became inhabitants of  Leicester. The proprietors tried to induce the fifty families, whose  settlement was one of the conditions on which the grant was made, to  occupy the eastern half of the township reserving the rest as their  absolute property.[59:2]    The author of a currency tract, in 1716, entitled \"Some Considerations  upon the Several Sorts of Banks,\" remarks that formerly, when land was  easy to be obtained, good men came over as indentured servants; but now,  he says, they are runaways, thieves, and disorderly persons. The remedy  for this, in his opinion, would be to induce servants to come over by  offering them homes when the terms of indenture should expire.[60:1] He  therefore advocates that townships should be laid out four or five miles  square in which grants of fifty or sixty acres could be made to  servants.[60:2] Concern over the increase of negro slaves in  Massachusetts seems to have been the reason for this proposal. It  indicates that the current practice in disposing of the lands did not  provide for the poorer people.    But Massachusetts did not follow this suggestion of a homestead policy.  On the contrary, the desire to locate towns to create continuous lines  of settlement along the roads between the disconnected frontiers and to  protect boundary claims by granting tiers of towns in the disputed  tract, as well, no doubt, as pressure from financial interests, led the  General Court between 1715 and 1762 to dispose of the remaining public  domain of Massachusetts under conditions that made speculation and  colonization by capitalists important factors.[60:3] When in 1762  Massachusetts sold a group of townships in the Berkshires to the highest  bidders (by whole townships),[60:4] the transfer from the  social-religious to the economic conception was complete, and the  frontier was deeply influenced by the change to \"land mongering.\"    In one respect, however, there was an increasing recognition of the  religious and social element in settling the frontier, due in part, no  doubt, to a desire to provide for the preservation of eastern ideals and  influences in the West. Provisions for reserving lands within the  granted townships for the support of an approved minister, and for  schools, appear in the seventeenth century and become a common feature  of the grants for frontier towns in the eighteenth.[61:1] This practice  with respect to the New England frontier became the foundation for the  system of grants of land from the public domain for the support of  common schools and state universities by the federal government from its  beginning, and has been profoundly influential in later Western States.    Another ground for discontent over land questions was furnished by the  system of granting lands within the town by the commoners. The principle  which in many, if not all, cases guided the proprietors in distributing  the town lots is familiar and is well stated in the Lancaster town  records (1653):         And, whereas Lotts are Now Laid out for the most part Equally       to Rich and poore, Partly to keepe the Towne from Scatering to       farr, and partly out of Charitie and Respect to men of meaner       estate, yet that Equallitie (which is the rule of God) may be       observed, we Covenant and Agree, That in a second Devition and       so through all other Devitions of Land the mater shall be       drawne as neere to _equallitie according to mens estates_ as       wee are able to doe, That he which hath now more then his       estate Deserveth in home Lotts and entervale Lotts shall haue       so much Less: and he that hath Less then his estate Deserveth       shall haue so much more.[62:1]    This peculiar doctrine of \"equality\" had early in the history of the  colony created discontents. Winthrop explained the principle which  governed himself and his colleagues in the case of the Boston committee  of 1634 by saying that their divisions were arranged \"partly to prevent  the neglect of trades.\" This is a pregnant idea; it underlay much of the  later opposition of New England as a manufacturing section to the free  homestead or cheap land policy, demanded by the West and by the labor  party, in the national public domain. The migration of labor to free  lands meant that higher wages must be paid to those who remained. The  use of the town lands by the established classes to promote an approved  form of society naturally must have had some effect on migration.    But a more effective source of disputes was with respect to the relation  of the town proprietors to the public domain of the town in contrast  with the non-proprietors as a class. The need of keeping the town  meeting and the proprietors' meeting separate in the old towns in  earlier years was not so great as it was when the new-comers became  numerous. In an increasing degree these new-comers were either not  granted lands at all, or were not admitted to the body of proprietors  with rights in the possession of the undivided town lands. Contentions  on the part of the town meeting that it had the right of dealing with  the town lands occasionally appear, significantly, in the frontier towns  of Haverhill, Massachusetts, Simsbury, Connecticut, and in the towns of  the Connecticut Valley.[63:1] Jonathan Edwards, in 1751, declared that  there had been in Northampton for forty or fifty years \"two parties  somewhat like the court and country parties of England. . . . The first  party embraced the great proprietors of land, and the parties concerned  about land and other matters.\"[63:2] The tendency to divide up the  common lands among the proprietors in individual possession did not  become marked until the eighteenth century; but the exclusion of some  from possession of the town lands and the \"equality\" in allotment  favoring men with already large estates must have attracted ambitious  men who were not of the favored class to join in the movement to new  towns. Religious dissensions would combine to make frontier society as  it formed early in the eighteenth century more and more democratic,  dissatisfied with the existing order, and less respectful of authority.  We shall not understand the relative radicalism of parts of the  Berkshires, Vermont and interior New Hampshire without enquiry into the  degree in which the control over the lands by a proprietary monopoly  affected the men who settled on the frontier.    The final aspect of this frontier to be examined, is the attitude of the  conservatives of the older sections towards this movement of westward  advance. President Dwight in the era of the War of 1812 was very  critical of the \"foresters,\" but saw in such a movement a safety valve  to the institutions of New England by allowing the escape of the  explosive advocates of \"Innovation.\"[63:3]    Cotton Mather is perhaps not a typical representative of the  conservative sentiment at the close of the seventeenth century, but his  writings may partly reflect the attitude of Boston Bay toward New  England's first Western frontier. Writing in 1694 of \"Wonderful Passages  which have Occurred, First in the Protections and then in the  Afflictions of New England,\" he says:         One while the Enclosing of _Commons_ hath made Neighbours,       that should have been like Sheep, to _Bite and devour one       another_. . . . Again, Do our _Old_ People, any of them _Go       Out_ from the Institutions of God, Swarming into New       Settlements, where they and their Untaught Families are"]]]
